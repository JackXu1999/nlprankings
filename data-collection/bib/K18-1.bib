    abstract = "Complex textual information extraction tasks are often posed as sequence labeling or \textit{shallow parsing}, where fields are extracted using local labels made consistent through probabilistic inference in a graphical model with constrained transitions. Recently, it has become common to locally parametrize these models using rich features extracted by recurrent neural networks (such as LSTM), while enforcing consistent outputs through a simple linear-chain model, representing Markovian dependencies between successive labels. However, the simple graphical model structure belies the often complex non-local constraints between output labels. For example, many fields, such as a first name, can only occur a fixed number of times, or in the presence of other fields. While RNNs have provided increasingly powerful context-aware local features for sequence tagging, they have yet to be integrated with a global graphical model of similar expressivity in the output distribution. Our model goes beyond the linear chain CRF to incorporate multiple hidden states per output label, but parametrizes them parsimoniously with low-rank log-potential scoring matrices, effectively learning an embedding space for hidden states. This augmented latent space of inference variables complements the rich feature representation of the RNN, and allows exact global inference obeying complex, learned non-local output constraints. We experiment with several datasets and show that the model outperforms baseline CRF+RNN models when global output constraints are necessary at inference-time, and explore the interpretable latent structure.",

Practitioners often use pre-trained word vectors, which were trained on large generic text corpora, and which are readily available on the web. However, pre-trained word vectors oftentimes lack important words from specific domains. It is therefore often desirable to extend the vocabulary and embed new words into a set of pre-trained word vectors. In this paper, we present an efficient method for including new words from a specialized corpus, containing new words, into pre-trained generic word embeddings. We build on the established view of word embeddings as matrix factorizations to present a spectral algorithm for this task. Experiments on several domain-specific corpora with specialized vocabularies demonstrate that our method is able to embed the new words efficiently into the original embedding space. Compared to competing methods, our method is faster, parameter-free, and deterministic.",

They are useful for understanding the shortcomings of machine learning models, interpreting their results, and for regularisation.

In this paper, we investigate the problem of automatically generating adversarial examples that violate a set of given First-Order Logic constraints in Natural Language Inference (NLI). We reduce the problem of identifying such adversarial examples to a combinatorial optimisation problem, by maximising a quantity measuring the degree of violation of such constraints and by using a language model for generating linguistically-plausible examples. Furthermore, we propose a method for adversarially regularising neural NLI models for incorporating background knowledge. Our results show that, while the proposed method does not always improve results on the SNLI and MultiNLI datasets, it significantly and consistently increases the predictive accuracy on adversarially-crafted datasets {--} up to a 79.6{\%} relative improvement {--} while drastically reducing the number of background knowledge violations. Furthermore, we show that adversarial examples transfer among model architectures, and that the proposed adversarial training procedure improves the robustness of NLI models to adversarial examples.",

In particular, we investigate whether lexical orthographic neighborhoods take into account transposition and deletion in determining neighbors. If this is the case, it is more likely that the neighborhood effect takes place early during processing, and does not solely rely on similarity of internal representations. We introduce a new neighborhood measure, rd20, which can be used to quantify neighborhood effects over arbitrary feature spaces. We calculate the rd20 over large sets of words in three languages using various feature sets and show that feature sets that do not allow for transposition or deletion explain more variance in Reaction Time (RT) measurements. We also show that the rd20 can be calculated using the hidden state representations of an Multi-Layer Perceptron, and show that these explain less variance than the raw features. We conclude that the neighborhood effect is unlikely to have a perceptual basis, but is more likely to be the result of items co-activating after recognition.

Toward this end, we propose a framework that learns to embed semantic correspondence between text and its extracted semantic knowledge, called semantic frame. One key contributed technique is semantic frame reconstruction used to derive a one-to-one mapping between embedded vectors and their corresponding semantic frames. Embedding into semantically meaningful vectors and computing their distances in vector space provides a simple, but effective way to measure semantic similarities. With the proposed framework, we demonstrate three key areas where the embedding model can be effective: visualization, semantic search and re-ranking.",

However, the discriminator typically results in the instability of the GAN training due to the inadequate training problem: the search space is so huge that sampled translations are not sufficient for discriminator training. To address this issue and stabilize the GAN training, in this paper, we propose a novel Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Network for Neural Machine Translation (BGAN-NMT), which aims to introduce a generator model to act as the discriminator, whereby the discriminator naturally considers the entire translation space so that the inadequate training problem can be alleviated. To satisfy this property, generator and discriminator are both designed to model the joint probability of sentence pairs, with the difference that, the generator decomposes the joint probability with a source language model and a source-to-target translation model, while the discriminator is formulated as a target language model and a target-to-source translation model. To further leverage the symmetry of them, an auxiliary GAN is introduced and adopts generator and discriminator models of original one as its own discriminator and generator respectively. Two GANs are alternately trained to update the parameters. Experiment results on German-English and Chinese-English translation tasks demonstrate that our method not only stabilizes GAN training but also achieves significant improvements over baseline systems.",

However, in many scenarios, not all of the entities are explicitly mentioned in the text. Sometimes they could be inferred from the context or from other indicative words. Consider the following sentence: {``}CMA can easily hydrolyze into free acetic acid.{''} Although water is not mentioned explicitly, one can infer that H2O is an entity involved in the process. In this work, we present the problem of Latent Entities Extraction (LEE). We present several methods for determining whether entities are discussed in a text, even though, potentially, they are not explicitly written. Specifically, we design a neural model that handles extraction of multiple entities jointly. We show that our model, along with multi-task learning approach and a novel task grouping algorithm, reaches high performance in identifying latent entities. Our experiments are conducted on a large biological dataset from the biochemical field. The dataset contains text descriptions of biological processes, and for each process, all of the involved entities in the process are labeled, including implicitly mentioned ones. We believe LEE is a task that will significantly improve many NER and subsequent applications and improve text understanding and inference.",

Addressing these drawbacks, in this paper, we tackle keyphrase extraction from single documents with EmbedRank: a novel unsupervised method, that leverages sentence embeddings. EmbedRank achieves higher F-scores than graph-based state of the art systems on standard datasets and is suitable for real-time processing of large amounts of Web data. With EmbedRank, we also explicitly increase coverage and diversity among the selected keyphrases by introducing an embedding-based maximal marginal relevance (MMR) for new phrases. A user study including over 200 votes showed that, although reducing the phrases{'} semantic overlap leads to no gains in F-score, our high diversity selection is preferred by humans.",

In this paper, we propose a novel Salient-Clue mechanism for Chinese poetry generation.

Besides, our model can be flexibly extended to control the generated poem in different aspects, for example, poetry style, which further enhances the coherence.

A linear transformation that adjusts the similarity order of the model without any external resource can tailor it to achieve better results in those aspects, providing a new perspective on how embeddings encode divergent linguistic information.

However, language also has rich associational structures that can serve as a further resource for achieving successful reference. Here we investigate this use of associational information in a setting where only associational information is available: a simplified version of the popular game Codenames. Using optimal experiment design techniques, we compare a range of models varying in the type of associative information deployed and in level of pragmatic sophistication against human behavior. In this setting we find that listeners{'} behavior reflects direct bigram collocational associations more strongly than word-embedding or semantic knowledge graph-based associations and that there is little evidence for pragmatically sophisticated behavior on the part of either speakers or listeners. More generally, we demonstrate the effective use of simple tasks to derive insights into the nature of complex linguistic phenomena.",

We present results that show, under exhaustive and precise conditions, that one kind of word embeddings and the similarity spaces they define do not encode the properties of intervention similarity in long-distance dependencies, and that therefore they fail to represent this core linguistic notion.",

We conduct a human evaluation of our model on a standard text summarization dataset and show that it performs comparably to a supervised baseline based on grammatical correctness and retention of meaning.

Although we underperform supervised models based on ROUGE scores, our models are competitive with a supervised baseline based on human evaluation for grammatical correctness and retention of meaning.",

Second, we feed the output of a constituency parser into the model directly and integrate linguistic constituents into the network to help it concentrate on chunks of an answer rather than on its single words for generating more natural output.

To study argumentation quality based on this notion, we introduce a new corpus with 1000 editorials from the New York Times, annotated for their perceived effect along with the annotators{'} political orientations.

We next perform adversarial training with each strategy, employing a max-margin approach for negative generative examples. This not only makes the target dialogue model more robust to the adversarial inputs, but also helps it perform significantly better on the original inputs. Moreover, training on all strategies combined achieves further improvements, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance on the original task (also verified via human evaluation). In addition to adversarial training, we also address the robustness task at the model-level, by feeding it subword units as both inputs and outputs, and show that the resulting model is equally competitive, requires only 1/4 of the original vocabulary size, and is robust to one of the adversarial strategies (to which the original model is vulnerable) even without adversarial training.",

We introduce the Lifted Matrix-Space model, which uses a global transformation to map vector word embeddings to matrices, which can then be composed via an operation based on matrix-matrix multiplication. Its composition function effectively transmits a larger number of activations across layers with relatively few model parameters. We evaluate our model on the Stanford NLI corpus, the Multi-Genre NLI corpus, and the Stanford Sentiment Treebank and find that it consistently outperforms TreeLSTM (Tai et al., 2015), the previous best known composition function for tree-structured models.",

The main idea is to consider all possible spans as potential mentions and learn contextual similarity scores over their entity candidates that are useful for both MD and ED decisions. Key components are context-aware mention embeddings, entity embeddings and a probabilistic mention - entity map, without demanding other engineered features. Empirically, we show that our end-to-end method significantly outperforms popular systems on the Gerbil platform when enough training data is available.

Methods for learning semantic spaces, however, are mostly aimed at modelling similarity. In this paper, we argue that there is an inherent trade-off between capturing similarity and faithfully modelling features as directions. Following this observation, we propose a simple method to fine-tune existing semantic spaces, with the aim of improving the quality of their feature directions.

Instead of learning the individual classification layers for the support and target schemes, the proposed method converts the class label of each example on the support scheme into a set of candidate class labels on the target scheme via the class correspondence table, and then uses the candidate labels to learn the classification layer for the target scheme. We evaluate the proposed method on two tasks in NLP.
