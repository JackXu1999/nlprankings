We call such task the spatial placement problem. Our extension particularly focuses on describing the object direction, when the object is placed on the 2D plane. We conducted an annotation experiment in which a corpus of 20 situated dialogues were annotated. The annotation result showed the number of newly introduced tags by our proposal is not negligible. We also implemented an analyser that automatically assigns the proposed tags to the corpus and evaluated its performance. The result showed that the performance for entity tag was quite high ranging from 0.68 to 0.99 in F-measure, but not the case for relation tags, i.e. less than 0.4 in F-measure.",

However, annotation of the full corpus sentence by sentence is resource intensive. In this paper, we propose an approach that iteratively extracts frequent parts of sentences for annotating, and compresses the set of sentences after each round of annotation. Our approach can also be used in preparing training sentences for binary classification (domain-related vs. noise, subjectivity vs. objectivity, etc.), assuming that sentence-type annotation can be predicted by annotation of the most relevant sub-sentences. Two experiments are performed to test our proposal and evaluated in terms of time saved and agreement of annotation.",

    abstract = "Although MWE are relatively morphologically and syntactically fixed expressions, several types of flexibility can be observed in MWE, verbal MWE in particular. Identifying the degree of morphological and syntactic flexibility of MWE is very important for many Lexicographic and NLP tasks. Adding MWE variants/tokens to a dictionary resource requires characterizing the flexibility among other morphosyntactic features. Carrying out the task manually faces several challenges since it is a very laborious task time and effort wise, as well as it will suffer from coverage limitation. The problem is exacerbated in rich morphological languages where the average word in Arabic could have 12 possible inflection forms. Accordingly, in this paper we introduce a semi-automatic Arabic multiwords expressions resource (SAMER). We propose an automated method that identifies the morphological and syntactic flexibility of Arabic Verbal Multiword Expressions (AVMWE). All observed morphological variants and syntactic pattern alternations of an AVMWE are automatically acquired using large scale corpora. We look for three morphosyntactic aspects of AVMWE types investigating derivational and inflectional variations and syntactic templates, namely: 1) inflectional variation (inflectional paradigm) and calculating degree of flexibility; 2) derivational productivity; and 3) identifying and classifying the different syntactic types. We build a comprehensive list of AVMWE. Every token in the AVMWE list is lemmatized and tagged with POS information. We then search Arabic Gigaword and All ATBs for all possible flexible matches. For each AVMWE type we generate: a) a statistically ranked list of MWE-lexeme inflections and syntactic pattern alternations; b) An abstract syntactic template; and c) The most frequent form. Our technique is validated using a Golden MWE annotated list. The results shows that the quality of the generated resource is 80.04{\%}.",
