Our approach extends a deep learning architecture with several contributions: following previous observations that language use differs by gender, it captures and uses gender information through domain adaptation; it captures recency of posts under the hypothesis that more recent posts are more representative of an individual{'}s current risk status; and, lastly, it demonstrates that in this scenario where activity factors are sparsely represented in the data, a bag-of-word neural network model using custom dictionaries of food and activity words performs better than other neural sequence models. Our best model, which incorporates all these contributions, achieves a risk-detection F1 of 41.9, considerably higher than the baseline rate (36.9).",

These online communities are helpful platforms for non-professional medical opinions, yet pose risk of being unreliable in quality and insufficient in quantity to cover the wide range of potential drug reactions. Current approaches to analysing such user-generated content in online forums heavily rely on feature engineering of both documents and users, and often overlook the relationships between posts within a common discussion thread. Inspired by recent advancements, we propose a neural architecture that models the textual content of user-generated documents and user experiences in online communities to predict side effects during treatment. Experimental results show that our proposed architecture outperforms baseline models.",

Previous works show that rule-based methods are still effective, while deep learning methods are reported to be better recently. In order to implement and evaluate an de-identification tool in a practical level, we implemented three methods, rule-based, CRF, and LSTM. We prepared three datasets of pseudo EHRs with de-identification tags manually annoated. These datasets are derived from shared task data to compare with previous works, and our new data to increase training data. Our result shows that our LSTM-based method is better and robust, which leads to our future work that plans to apply our system to actual de-identification tasks in hospitals.",

Currently nurses may need to memorize several hundred subject headings from standardized nursing terminologies when structuring and assigning the right section/subject headings to their text. Our aim is to allow nurses to write in a narrative manner without having to plan and structure the text with respect to sections and subject headings, instead the system should assist with the assignment of subject headings and restructuring afterwards. We hypothesize that this could reduce the time and effort needed for nursing documentation in hospitals. A central component of the system is a text classification model based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network architecture, trained on a large data set of nursing notes. A simple Web-based interface has been implemented for user interaction. To evaluate the system, three nurses write a set of artificial nursing shift notes in a fully unstructured narrative manner, without planning for or consider the use of sections and subject headings. These are then fed to the system which assigns subject headings to each sentence and then groups them into paragraphs. Manual evaluation is conducted by a group of nurses. The results show that about 70{\%} of the sentences are assigned to correct subject headings. The nurses believe that such a system can be of great help in making nursing documentation in hospitals easier and less time consuming. Finally, various measures and approaches for improving the system are discussed.",

We trained context-aware token embeddings on a dataset of biomedical papers using ELMo, and incorporated these embeddings in the LSTM-CRF model used by AllenNLP for named entity recognition. We show these representations improve named entity recognition for different types of biomedical named entities.

    abstract = "For psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, longer durations of untreated psychosis are associated with worse intervention outcomes. Data included in electronic health records (EHRs) can be useful for retrospective clinical studies, but much of this is stored as unstructured text which cannot be directly used in computation. Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods can be used to extract this data, in order to identify symptoms and treatments from mental health records, and temporally anchor the first emergence of these. We are developing an EHR corpus annotated with time expressions, clinical entities and their relations, to be used for NLP development.",

    abstract = "Many applications in biomedical natural language processing rely on sequence tagging as an initial step to perform more complex analysis. To support text analysis in the biomedical domain, we introduce Yet Another SEquence Tagger (YASET), an open-source multi purpose sequence tagger that implements state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms for sequence tagging. Herein, we evaluate YASET on part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition in a variety of text genres including articles from the biomedical literature in English and clinical narratives in French. To further characterize performance, we report distributions over 30 runs and different sizes of training datasets. YASET provides state-of-the-art performance on the CoNLL 2003 NER dataset (F1=0.87), MEDPOST corpus (F1=0.97), MERLoT corpus (F1=0.99) and NCBI disease corpus (F1=0.81). We believe that YASET is a versatile and efficient tool that can be used for sequence tagging in biomedical and clinical texts.",

    abstract = "The Impression section of a radiology report summarizes crucial radiology findings in natural language and plays a central role in communicating these findings to physicians. However, the process of generating impressions by summarizing findings is time-consuming for radiologists and prone to errors. We propose to automate the generation of radiology impressions with neural sequence-to-sequence learning. We further propose a customized neural model for this task which learns to encode the study background information and use this information to guide the decoding process. On a large dataset of radiology reports collected from actual hospital studies, our model outperforms existing non-neural and neural baselines under the ROUGE metrics. In a blind experiment, a board-certified radiologist indicated that 67{\%} of sampled system summaries are at least as good as the corresponding human-written summaries, suggesting significant clinical validity. To our knowledge our work represents the first attempt in this direction.",
