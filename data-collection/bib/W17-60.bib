    abstract = "For practical chatbots, one of the essential factor for improving user experience is the capability of customizing the talking style of the agents, that is, to make chatbots provide responses meeting users{'} preference on language styles, topics, etc. To address this issue, this paper proposes to incorporate linguistic biases, which implicitly involved in the conversation corpora generated by human groups in the Social Network Services (SNS), into the encoder-decoder based response generator. By attaching a specially designed neural component to dynamically control the impact of linguistic biases in response generation, a Group Linguistic Bias Aware Neural Response Generation (GLBA-NRG) model is eventually presented. The experimental results on the dataset from the Chinese SNS show that the proposed architecture outperforms the current response generating models by producing both meaningful and vivid responses with customized styles.",

    abstract = "For Chinese word segmentation, the large-scale annotated corpora mainly focus on newswire and only a handful of annotated data is available in other domains such as patents and literature. Considering the limited amount of annotated target domain data, it is a challenge for segmenters to learn domain-specific information while avoid getting over-fitted at the same time. In this paper, we propose a neural regularized domain adaptation method for Chinese word segmentation. The teacher networks trained in source domain are employed to regularize the training process of the student network by preserving the general knowledge. In the experiments, our neural regularized domain adaptation method achieves a better performance comparing to previous methods.",

In this paper, we hypothesize that in addition to semantic information, sub-character components may also carry emotional information, and that utilizing it should improve performance on sentiment analysis tasks. We conduct a series of experiments on four Chinese sentiment data sets and show that we can significantly improve the performance in various tasks over that of a character-level embeddings baseline. We then focus on qualitatively assessing multiple examples and trying to explain how the sub-character components affect the results in each case.",

    abstract = "Answer extraction is the most important part of a chinese web-based question answering system. In order to enhance the robustness and adaptability of answer extraction to new domains and eliminate the influence of the incomplete and noisy search snippets, we propose two new answer exraction methods. We utilize text patterns to generate Part-of-Speech (POS) patterns. In addition, a method is proposed to construct a POS tree by using these POS patterns. The POS tree is useful to candidate answer extraction of web-based question answering. To retrieve a efficient POS tree, the similarities between questions are used to select the question-answer pairs whose questions are similar to the unanswered question. Then, the POS tree is improved based on these question-answer pairs. In order to rank these candidate answers, the weights of the leaf nodes of the POS tree are calculated using a heuristic method. Moreover, the Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to train the weights. The experimental results of 10-fold crossvalidation show that the weighted POS tree trained by GA can improve the accuracy of answer extraction.",

However, it{'}s a challenging task to translate them correctly for the huge number of pre-existing terms and the endless new terms. To achieve better term translation quality, it is necessary to inject external term knowledge into the underlying MT system. Fortunately, there are plenty of term translation knowledge in parenthetical sentences on the Internet. In this paper, we propose a simple, straightforward and effective framework to improve term translation by learning from parenthetical sentences. This framework includes: (1) a focused web crawler; (2) a parenthetical sentence filter, acquiring parenthetical sentences including bilingual term pairs; (3) a term translation knowledge extractor, extracting bilingual term translation candidates; (4) a probability learner, generating the term translation table for MT decoders. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly improves the translation quality of terms and sentences.",
