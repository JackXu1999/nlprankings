    abstract = "Most scholarly works in the field of computational detection of humour derive their inspiration from the incongruity theory. Incongruity is an indispensable facet in drawing a line between humorous and non-humorous occurrences but is immensely inadequate in shedding light on what actually made the particular occurrence a funny one. Classical theories like Script-based Semantic Theory of Humour and General Verbal Theory of Humour try and achieve this feat to an adequate extent. In this paper we adhere to a more holistic approach towards classification of humour based on these classical theories with a few improvements and revisions. Through experiments based on our linear approach and performed on large data-sets of jokes, we are able to demonstrate the adaptability and show componentizability of our model, and that a host of classification techniques can be used to overcome the challenging problem of distinguishing between various categories and sub-categories of jokes.",

Yet we find that both genders use capitalization in a similar way when expressing sentiment.",

However, with the increased availability of data sets including socio-demographic information and more expressive (neural) models, we have the opportunity to address both issues.

Unfortunately (from a researcher{'}s perspective) only a fraction of Twitter accounts agree to this, and these accounts are likely to have systematic diffences with the general population. This work is an exploratory study of these differences across the full range of Twitter content, and complements previous studies that focus on the English-language subset. Additionally, we compare methods for querying users by self-identified properties, finding that the constrained semantics of the {``}description{''} field provides cleaner, higher-volume results than more complex regular expressions.",

Furthermore, we use the dataset to train and evaluate benchmark personality prediction models, achieving macro F1-scores between 67{\%} and 82{\%} on the individual dimensions and 82{\%} accuracy for exact or one-off accurate type prediction.

Many nationals are also not limited to speaking just one language, such as how Filipinos speak Filipino and English, the two national languages of the Philippines. The addition of several regional/indigenous languages, along with the commonness of code-switching, allow for a Filipino to have a rich vocabulary. This presents an opportunity to create a text-based personality model based on how Filipinos speak, regardless of the language they use. To do so, data was collected from 250 Filipino Twitter users. Different combinations of data processing techniques were experimented upon to create personality models for each of the Big Five. The results for both regression and classification show that Conscientiousness is consistently the easiest trait to model, followed by Extraversion. Classification models for Agreeableness and Neuroticism had subpar performances, but performed better than those of Openness. An analysis on personality trait score representation showed that classifying extreme outliers generally produce better results for all traits except for Neuroticism and Openness.",
