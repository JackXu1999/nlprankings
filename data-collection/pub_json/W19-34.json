We propose a framework that can automatically compose a picture book by understanding story text and visualizing it with painting elements, i.e., characters and backgrounds. For story understanding, we extract key information from a story on both sentence level and paragraph level, including characters, scenes and actions. These concepts are organized and visualized in a way that depicts the development of a story. We collect a set of Chinese stories for children and apply our approach to compose pictures for stories. Extensive experiments are conducted towards story event extraction for visualization to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.","pages":"1--10","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W19-3401","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W19-3401","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Florence, Italy","year":"2019","month":"August","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Second Workshop on Storytelling"},{"id":"W19-3402","title":"{``}My Way of Telling a Story{''}: Persona based Grounded Story Generation","authors":["Chandu, Khyathi","Prabhumoye, Shrimai","Salakhutdinov, Ruslan","Black, Alan W"],"emails":["kchandu@cs.cmu.edu","sprabhum@cs.cmu.edu","rsalakhu@cs.cmu.edu","awb@cs.cmu.edu"],"author_id":["khyathi-chandu","shrimai-prabhumoye","ruslan-salakhutdinov","alan-w-black"],"abstract":"Visual storytelling is the task of generating stories based on a sequence of images. Inspired by the recent works in neural generation focusing on controlling the form of text, this paper explores the idea of generating these stories in different personas. However, one of the main challenges of performing this task is the lack of a dataset of visual stories in different personas. Having said that, there are independent datasets for both visual storytelling and annotated sentences for various persona. In this paper we describe an approach to overcome this by getting labelled persona data from a different task and leveraging those annotations to perform persona based story generation. We inspect various ways of incorporating personality in both the encoder and the decoder representations to steer the generation in the target direction. To this end, we propose five models which are incremental extensions to the baseline model to perform the task at hand. In our experiments we use five different personas to guide the generation process. We find that the models based on our hypotheses perform better at capturing words while generating stories in the target persona.","pages":"11--21","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W19-3402","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W19-3402","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Florence, Italy","year":"2019","month":"August","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Second Workshop on Storytelling"},{"id":"W19-3403","title":"Using Functional Schemas to Understand Social Media Narratives","authors":["Yan, Xinru","Naik, Aakanksha","Jo, Yohan","Rose, Carolyn"],"emails":["xinruyan@cs.cmu.edu","anaik@cs.cmu.edu","yohanj@cs.cmu.edu","cp3a@cs.cmu.edu"],"author_id":["xinru-yan","aakanksha-naik","yohan-jo","carolyn-rose"],"abstract":"We propose a novel take on understanding narratives in social media, focusing on learning {''}functional story schemas{''}, which consist of sets of stereotypical functional structures.

Neural text generation models have been shown to perform well at generating fluent sentences from data, but they usually fail to keep track of the overall coherence of the story after a couple of sentences. Existing work that incorporates a text planning module succeeded in generating recipes and dialogues, but appears quite data-demanding. We propose a novel story generation approach that generates globally coherent stories from a fairly small corpus. The model exploits a symbolic text planning module to produce text plans, thus reducing the demand of data; a neural surface realization module then generates fluent text conditioned on the text plan. Human evaluation showed that our model outperforms various baselines by a wide margin and generates stories which are fluent as well as globally coherent.","pages":"34--45","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W19-3404","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W19-3404","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Florence, Italy","year":"2019","month":"August","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Second Workshop on Storytelling"},{"id":"W19-3405","title":"Guided Neural Language Generation for Automated Storytelling","authors":["Ammanabrolu, Prithviraj","Tien, Ethan","Cheung, Wesley","Luo, Zhaochen","Ma, William","Martin, Lara","Riedl, Mark"],"emails":["raj.ammanabrolu@gatech.edu","etien@gatech.edu","wcheung8@gatech.edu","zluo@gatech.edu","wma61@gatech.edu","ljmartin@gatech.edu","riedl@gatech.edu"],"author_id":["prithviraj-ammanabrolu","ethan-tien","wesley-cheung","zhaochen-luo","william-ma","lara-martin","mark-riedl"],"abstract":"Neural network based approaches to automated story plot generation attempt to learn how to generate novel plots from a corpus of natural language plot summaries. Prior work has shown that a semantic abstraction of sentences called events improves neural plot generation and and allows one to decompose the problem into: (1) the generation of a sequence of events (event-to-event) and (2) the transformation of these events into natural language sentences (event-to-sentence). However, typical neural language generation approaches to event-to-sentence can ignore the event details and produce grammatically-correct but semantically-unrelated sentences. We present an ensemble-based model that generates natural language guided by events. Our method outperforms the baseline sequence-to-sequence model.

The research in automatic storytelling has recently turned towards emotional storytelling, in which characters{'} emotions play an important role in the plot development (Theune et al., 2004; y Perez, 2007; Mendez et al., 2016). However, these studies mainly use emotion to generate propositional statements in the form {``}A feels affection towards B{''} or {``}A confronts B{''}. At the same time, emotional behavior does not boil down to such propositional descriptions, as humans display complex and highly variable patterns in communicating their emotions, both verbally and non-verbally. In this paper, we analyze how emotions are expressed non-verbally in a corpus of fan fiction short stories. Our analysis shows that stories written by humans convey character emotions along various non-verbal channels. We find that some non-verbal channels, such as facial expressions and voice characteristics of the characters, are more strongly associated with joy, while gestures and body postures are more likely to occur with trust. Based on our analysis, we argue that automatic storytelling systems should take variability of emotion into account when generating descriptions of characters{'} emotions.","pages":"56--64","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W19-3406","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W19-3406","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Florence, Italy","year":"2019","month":"August","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Second Workshop on Storytelling"},{"id":"W19-3407","title":"{N}arrative {G}eneration in the {W}ild: {M}ethods from {N}a{N}o{G}en{M}o","authors":["van Stegeren, Judith","Theune, Mari{\\\"e}t"],"emails":["j.e.vanstegeren@utwente.nl","m.theune@utwente.nl"],"author_id":["judith-van-stegeren","mariet-theune"],"abstract":"In text generation, generating long stories is still a challenge.

Using the Recursive feature elimination with cross-validation (RFECV) algorithm, we per- form feature selection experiments on an ex- haustive set of nineteen features (belonging to all the classes mentioned above) extracted from Brown corpus text.
