Alcohol consumption often comes along with social events as it helps people to increase their sociability and to overcome their inhibitions. On the other hand we know that increased alcohol consumption can lead to serious health issues, such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases and diseases of the digestive system, to mention a few. This work examines alcohol consumption during the FIFA Football World Cup 2018, particularly the usage of alcohol related information on Twitter. For this we analyse the tweeting behaviour and show that the tournament strongly increases the interest in beer. Furthermore we show that countries who had to leave the tournament at early stage might have done something good to their fans as the interest in beer decreased again.","pages":"1--4","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W18-5901","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W18-5901","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Brussels, Belgium","year":"2018","month":"October","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2018 {EMNLP} Workshop {SMM}4{H}: The 3rd Social Media Mining for Health Applications Workshop {\\&} Shared Task"},{"id":"W18-5902","title":"Stance-Taking in Topics Extracted from Vaccine-Related Tweets and Discussion Forum Posts","authors":["Skeppstedt, Maria","Stede, Manfred","Kerren, Andreas"],"emails":["maria.skeppstedt@lnu.se","stede@uni-potsdam.de","andreas.kerren@lnu.se"],"author_id":["maria-skeppstedt","manfred-stede","andreas-kerren"],"abstract":"The occurrence of stance-taking towards vaccination was measured in documents extracted by topic modelling from two different corpora, one discussion forum corpus and one tweet corpus.
