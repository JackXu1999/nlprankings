Especially in social media such as Twitter, due to the space constraints, the sources of information that can be mined are even more limited due to character limitations. These limitations constitute a challenge for understanding short social media posts. In this paper, we present an approach that utilizes multiple binary classifiers that represent different affective categories to model Twitter posts (e.g., tweets). We train domain-independent recurrent neural network models without any outside information such as affect lexicons. We then use these domain independent binary ranking models to evaluate the applicability of such deep learning models on the affect identification task. This approach allows different model architectures and parameter settings for each affect category instead of building one single multi-label classifier. The contributions of this paper are two-folds: we show that modeling tweets with a small training set is possible with the use of RNNs and we also prove that formulating affect identification as a binary classification task is highly effective.","pages":"162--166","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/S18-1023","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/S18-1023","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"New Orleans, Louisiana","year":"2018","month":"June","booktitle":"Proceedings of The 12th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation"},{"id":"S18-1024","title":"Tw-{S}t{AR} at {S}em{E}val-2018 Task 1: Preprocessing Impact on Multi-label Emotion Classification","authors":["Mulki, Hala","Bechikh Ali, Chedi","Haddad, Hatem","Babao{\\u{g}}lu, Ismail"],"emails":["halamulki@selcuk.edu.tr","chedi.bechikh@gmail.com","addad@ulb.ac.be","ibabaoglu@selcuk.edu.tr"],"author_id":["hala-mulki","chedi-bechikh-ali","hatem-haddad","ismail-babaoglu"],"abstract":"In this paper, we describe our contribution in SemEval-2018 contest.

Identifying ironic and sarcastic content in text plays a vital role in inferring the actual intention of the user, and is necessary to increase the accuracy of sentiment analysis. This paper describes the work on identifying the irony level in twitter texts. The system developed by the SSN MLRG1 team in SemEval-2018 for task 3 (irony detection) uses rule based approach for feature selection and MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) technique to build the model for multiclass irony classification subtask, which classifies the given text into one of the four class labels.","pages":"633--637","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/S18-1103","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/S18-1103","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"New Orleans, Louisiana","year":"2018","month":"June","booktitle":"Proceedings of The 12th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation"},{"id":"S18-1104","title":"{NLPRL}-{IITBHU} at {S}em{E}val-2018 Task 3: Combining Linguistic Features and Emoji pre-trained {CNN} for Irony Detection in Tweets","authors":["Rangwani, Harsh","Kulshreshtha, Devang","Kumar Singh, Anil"],"emails":["harsh.rangwani.cse15@iitbhu.ac.in","devang.kulshreshtha.cse14@iitbhu.ac.in","aksingh.cse@iitbhu.ac.in"],"author_id":["harsh-rangwani","devang-kulshreshtha","anil-kumar-singh"],"abstract":"This paper describes our participation in SemEval 2018 Task 3 on Irony Detection in Tweets.

We focus on transfer of a sentence encoder to bootstrap more complicated architectures given the small size of the dataset. Our best model uses a pre-trained BiLSTM to encode input sentences, learns task-specific features for the argument and warrants, then performs independent argument-warrant matching. This model achieves mean test set accuracy of 61.31{\\%}. Encoder transfer yields a significant gain to our best model over random initialization. Sharing parameters for independent warrant evaluation provides regularization and effectively doubles the size of the dataset. We demonstrate that regularization comes from ignoring statistical correlations between warrant positions. We also report an experiment with our best model that only matches warrants to reasons, ignoring claims.
