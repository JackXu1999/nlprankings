We focused on the extraction of the ideal answers, and the task was approached as an instance of query-based multi-document summarisation. In particular, this paper focuses on the experiments related to the deep learning and reinforcement learning approaches used in the submitted runs. The best run used a deep learning model under a regression-based framework. The deep learning architecture used features derived from the output of LSTM chains on word embeddings, plus features based on similarity with the query, and sentence position. The reinforcement learning approach was a proof-of-concept prototype that trained a global policy using REINFORCE. The global policy was implemented as a neural network that used tf.idf features encoding the candidate sentence, question, and context.","pages":"22--29","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W18-5303","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W18-5303","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Brussels, Belgium","year":"2018","month":"November","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 6th {B}io{ASQ} Workshop A challenge on large-scale biomedical semantic indexing and question answering"},{"id":"W18-5304","title":"{AUEB} at {B}io{ASQ} 6: Document and Snippet Retrieval","authors":["Brokos, George","Liosis, Polyvios","McDonald, Ryan","Pappas, Dimitris","Androutsopoulos, Ion"],"emails":["","","","",""],"author_id":["george-brokos","polyvios-liosis","ryan-mcdonald","dimitris-pappas","ion-androutsopoulos"],"abstract":"We present system details for AUEB{'}s submissions to the BioASQ 6 Document and Snippet Retrieval challenge (Task 6b Phase A).

To facilitate information retrieval, curators in the National Library of Medicine (NLM) assign a set of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) to each article. MeSH is a hierarchically-organized vocabulary, containing about 28K different concepts, covering the fields from clinical medicine to information sciences. Several automatic MeSH indexing models have been developed to improve the time-consuming and financially expensive manual annotation, including the NLM official tool {--} Medical Text Indexer, and the winner of BioASQ Task5a challenge {--} DeepMeSH. However, these models are complex and not interpretable. We propose a novel end-to-end model, AttentionMeSH, which utilizes deep learning and attention mechanism to index MeSH terms to biomedical text. The attention mechanism enables the model to associate textual evidence with annotations, thus providing interpretability at the word level. The model also uses a novel masking mechanism to enhance accuracy and speed. In the final week of BioASQ Chanllenge Task6a, we ranked 2nd by average MiF using an on-construction model. After the contest, we achieve close to state-of-the-art MiF performance of {\\textasciitilde}0.684 using our final model. Human evaluations show AttentionMeSH also provides high level of interpretability, achieving 0.90@20 recall of all expert-labeled relevant words given an MeSH-article pair.","pages":"47--56","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W18-5306","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W18-5306","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Brussels, Belgium","year":"2018","month":"November","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 6th {B}io{ASQ} Workshop A challenge on large-scale biomedical semantic indexing and question answering"},{"id":"W18-5307","title":"Extraction Meets Abstraction: Ideal Answer Generation for Biomedical Questions","authors":["Li, Yutong","Gekakis, Nicholas","Wu, Qiuze","Li, Boyue","Chandu, Khyathi","Nyberg, Eric"],"emails":["pkalwad@cs.cmu.edu","anareshk@cs.cmu.edu","madhurad@cs.cmu.edu","teruko@cs.cmu.edu","kchandu@cs.cmu.edu","ehn@cs.cmu.edu"],"author_id":["yutong-li","nicholas-gekakis","qiuze-wu","boyue-li","khyathi-chandu","eric-nyberg"],"abstract":"The growing number of biomedical publications is a challenge for human researchers, who invest considerable effort to search for relevant documents and pinpointed answers.
