SyntaViz provides a platform for browsing the ontology of user queries from a syntax-driven perspective, providing quick access to high-impact failure points of the existing intent understanding system and evidence for data-driven decisions in the development cycle. A case study on Xfinity X1 (a voice-enabled entertainment platform from Comcast) reveals that SyntaViz helps developers identify multiple action items in a short amount of time without any special training.

Besides the toolkit, the embeddings of some existing large-scale knowledge graphs pre-trained by OpenKE are also available, which can be directly applied for many applications including information retrieval, personalized recommendation and question answering.

Our system demonstrates multiple competencies towards learning from human-like interactions. These include the ability to be taught reusable conditional procedures, the ability to be taught new knowledge about the world (concepts in an ontology) and the ability to be taught how to ground that knowledge in a set of sensors and effectors. Building such a system highlights design questions regarding the overall architecture that such an agent should have, as well as questions about parsing and grounding language in situational contexts. We outline key properties of this architecture, and demonstrate a prototype that embodies them in the form of a personal assistant on an Android device.","pages":"145--150","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/D18-2025","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/D18-2025","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Brussels, Belgium","year":"2018","month":"November","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing: System Demonstrations"},{"id":"D18-2026","title":"{P}izza{P}al: Conversational Pizza Ordering using a High-Density Conversational {AI} Platform","authors":["Raux, Antoine","Ma, Yi","Yang, Paul","Wong, Felicia"],"emails":["antoine@b4.ai","yi@b4.ai","paul@b4.ai","felicia@b4.ai"],"author_id":["antoine-raux","yi-ma","paul-yang","felicia-wong"],"abstract":"This paper describes PizzaPal, a voice-only agent for ordering pizza, as well as the Conversational AI architecture built at b4.ai.

Our architecture improves on the standard domain-intent-entity classification hierarchy and dialogue management architecture by leveraging shallow semantic parsing. We observe that NLU systems for industry applications often require more structured representations of entity relations than provided by the standard hierarchy, yet without requiring full semantic parses which are often inaccurate on real-world conversational data. We distinguish two kinds of semantic properties that can be provided through shallow semantic parsing: entity groups and entity roles. We also provide live demos of conversational apps built for two different use cases: food ordering and meeting control.","pages":"157--162","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/D18-2027","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/D18-2027","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Brussels, Belgium","year":"2018","month":"November","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing: System Demonstrations"},{"id":"D18-2028","title":"When science journalism meets artificial intelligence : An interactive demonstration","authors":["Vadapalli, Raghuram","Syed, Bakhtiyar","Prabhu, Nishant","Srinivasan, Balaji Vasan","Varma, Vasudeva"],"emails":["raghuram.vadapalli@research.iiit.ac.in","syed.b@research.iiit.ac.in","nishant.prabhu@research.iiit.ac.in","be.com@iiit.ac.in","vv@iiit.ac.in"],"author_id":["raghuram-vadapalli","bakhtiyar-syed","nishant-prabhu","balaji-vasan-srinivasan","vasudeva-varma"],"abstract":"We present an online interactive tool that generates titles of blog titles and thus take the first step toward automating science journalism.
