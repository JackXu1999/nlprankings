Debate posts from six discussion threads on the British parental website Mumsnet were manually annotated for stance {`}against{'} or {`}for{'} vaccination, or as {`}undecided{'}. A support vector machine, trained to detect the three classes, achieved a macro F-score of 0.44, while a macro F-score of 0.62 was obtained by the same type of classifier on the binary classification task of distinguishing stance {`}against{'} vaccination from stance {`}for{'} vaccination. These results show that vaccine stance detection in online forums is a difficult task, at least for the type of model investigated and for the relatively small training corpus that was used. Future work will therefore include an expansion of the training data and an evaluation of other types of classifiers and features.","pages":"1--8","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W17-5801","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Taipei, Taiwan","year":"2017","month":"November","booktitle":"Proceedings of the International Workshop on Digital Disease Detection using Social Media 2017 ({DDDSM}-2017)"},{"id":"W17-5802","title":"Analysing the Causes of Depressed Mood from Depression Vulnerable Individuals","authors":["Abd Yusof, Noor Fazilla","Lin, Chenghua","Guerin, Frank"],"emails":["noorfazilla.yusof@abdn.ac.uk","chenghua.lin@abdn.ac.uk","f.guerin@abdn.ac.uk"],"author_id":["noor-fazilla-abd-yusof","chenghua-lin","frank-guerin"],"abstract":"We develop a computational model to discover the potential causes of depression by analysing the topics in a usergenerated text.

Most of their targets, however, share common characteristics. They are seasonal or global events such as earthquakes and flu pandemics. In contrast, this study targets unseasonal and local disease events. Our system investigates the frequencies of disease-related words such as {``}nausea{''},{``}chill{''},and {``}diarrhea{''} and estimates the number of patients using regression of these word frequencies. Experiments conducted using Japanese 47 areas from January 2017 to April 2017 revealed that the detection of small and unseasonal event is extremely difficult (overall performance: 0.13). However, we found that the event scale and the detection performance show high correlation in the specified cases (in the phase of patient increasing or decreasing). The results also suggest that when 150 and more patients appear in a high population area, we can expect that our social sensors detect this outbreak. Based on these results, we can infer that social sensors can reliably detect unseasonal and local disease events under certain conditions, just as they can for seasonal or global events.","pages":"18--25","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W17-5803","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Taipei, Taiwan","year":"2017","month":"November","booktitle":"Proceedings of the International Workshop on Digital Disease Detection using Social Media 2017 ({DDDSM}-2017)"},{"id":"W17-5804","title":"Incorporating Dependency Trees Improve Identification of Pregnant Women on Social Media Platforms","authors":["Huang, Yi-Jie","Su, Chu Hsien","Chang, Yi-Chun","Ting, Tseng-Hsin","Fu, Tzu-Yuan","Wang, Rou-Min","Dai, Hong-Jie","Chang, Yung-Chun","Jonnagaddala, Jitendra","Hsu, Wen-Lian"],"emails":["","","","","","","","","",""],"author_id":["yi-jie-huang","chu-hsien-su","yi-chun-chang","tseng-hsin-ting","tzu-yuan-fu","rou-min-wang","hong-jie-dai","yung-chun-chang","jitendra-jonnagaddala","wen-lian-hsu"],"abstract":"The increasing popularity of social media lead users to share enormous information on the internet.

In 2016, a digital disease detection competition named ZikaHack was launched. The objective of the competition was for multidisciplinary teams to design, develop and demonstrate innovative digital disease detection solutions to retrospectively detect the 2015-16 Brazilian Zika virus outbreak earlier than traditional surveillance methods. In this paper, an overview of the ZikaHack competition is provided. The challenges and lessons learned in organizing this competition are also discussed for use by other researchers interested in organizing similar competitions.","pages":"39--46","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W17-5806","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Taipei, Taiwan","year":"2017","month":"November","booktitle":"Proceedings of the International Workshop on Digital Disease Detection using Social Media 2017 ({DDDSM}-2017)"},{"id":"W17-5807","title":"A Method to Generate a Machine-Labeled Data for Biomedical Named Entity Recognition with Various Sub-Domains","authors":["Kim, Juae","Kwon, Sunjae","Ko, Youngjoong","Seo, Jungyun"],"emails":["juaekim@sogang.ac.kr","soon91jae@sogang.ac.kr","yungjoong.ko@gmail.com","seojy@sogang.ac.kr"],"author_id":["juae-kim","sunjae-kwon","youngjoong-ko","jungyun-seo"],"abstract":"Biomedical Named Entity (NE) recognition is a core technique for various works in the biomedical domain. In previous studies, using machine learning algorithm shows better performance than dictionary-based and rule-based approaches because there are too many terminological variations of biomedical NEs and new biomedical NEs are constantly generated. To achieve the high performance with a machine-learning algorithm, good-quality corpora are required. However, it is difficult to obtain the good-quality corpora because an-notating a biomedical corpus for ma-chine-learning is extremely time-consuming and costly. In addition, most previous corpora are insufficient for high-level tasks because they cannot cover various domains. Therefore, we propose a method for generating a large amount of machine-labeled data that covers various domains. To generate a large amount of machine-labeled data, firstly we generate an initial machine-labeled data by using a chunker and MetaMap. The chunker is developed to extract only biomedical NEs with manually annotated data. MetaMap is used to annotate the category of bio-medical NE. Then we apply the self-training approach to bootstrap the performance of initial machine-labeled data. In our experiments, the biomedical NE recognition system that is trained with our proposed machine-labeled data achieves much high performance. As a result, our system outperforms biomedical NE recognition system that using MetaMap only with 26.03{\\%}p improvements on F1-score.","pages":"47--51","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W17-5807","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Taipei, Taiwan","year":"2017","month":"November","booktitle":"Proceedings of the International Workshop on Digital Disease Detection using Social Media 2017 ({DDDSM}-2017)"},{"id":"W17-5808","title":"Enhancing Drug-Drug Interaction Classification with Corpus-level Feature and Classifier Ensemble","authors":["Tu, Jing Cyun","Lai, Po-Ting","Tsai, Richard Tzong-Han"],"emails":["","",""],"author_id":["jing-cyun-tu","po-ting-lai","richard-tzong-han-tsai"],"abstract":"The study of drug-drug interaction (DDI) is important in the drug discovering.

Preprocessing of the training data classifies the entity pairs as either related or unrelated to build instance types for both inter-sentential and intra-sentential scenarios. An invariant function is proposed to process and optimally cluster similar patterns for both positive and negative instances. The learning model for CDR pairs is based on the SVM tree kernel approach, which generates feature trees and vectors and is modeled on suitable invariance based patterns, bringing brevity, precision and context to the identifier features.
