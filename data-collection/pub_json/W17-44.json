Probably the best known platform of this kind is Twitch, which has more than 100 million monthly viewers. Despite these numbers, and unlike other platforms featuring short messages (e.g. Twitter), Twitch has not received much attention from the Natural Language Processing community. In this paper we aim at bridging this gap by proposing two important tasks specific to the Twitch platform, namely (1) Emote prediction; and (2) Trolling detection. In our experiments, we evaluate three models: a BOW baseline, a logistic supervised classifiers based on word embeddings, and a bidirectional long short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM).

We explore the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) since they achieved state-of-the-art in various computer vision and NLP applications. However, the robustness of end-to-end models has some limitations such as the availability of a large amount of labeled data and uninterpretability of these models. We investigate the use of CNNs augmented with structured logic rules to overcome or reduce this issue. We developed our system called Churn{\\_}teacher by using an iterative distillation method that transfers the knowledge, extracted using just the combination of three logic rules, directly into the weight of the DNNs.

In this paper, we introduce an algorithm, EntitySpike, that identifies entities that spike in popularity in tweets from a given time period, and constructs an alias list for these spiked entities. EntitySpike uses a temporal heuristic to identify named entities with similar context that occur in the same time period (within minutes) during an event. Each entity is encoded as a vector using this temporal heuristic. We show how these entity-vectors can be used to create a named entity alias list.

We describe two modifications of a basic neural network architecture for sequence tagging. First, we show how we exploit additional labeled data, where the Named Entity tags differ from the target task. Then, we propose a way to incorporate sentence level features. Our system uses both methods and ranked second for entity level annotations, achieving an F1-score of 40.78, and second for surface form annotations, achieving an F1-score of 39.33.","pages":"166--171","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W17-4422","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W17-4422","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Copenhagen, Denmark","year":"2017","month":"September","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Noisy User-generated Text"},{"id":"W17-4423","title":"Context-Sensitive Recognition for Emerging and Rare Entities","authors":["Williams, Jake","Santia, Giovanni"],"emails":["jw3477@drexel.edu","gs495@drexel.edu"],"author_id":["jake-williams","giovanni-santia"],"abstract":"This paper is a shared task system description for the 2017 W-NUT shared task on Rare and Emerging Named Entities.

The paper describes how three initial classifier models were built using Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network. The outputs of these three classifiers were then used as features to train another CRF classifier working as an ensemble. 5-fold cross-validation based on training and development data for the emerging and rare named entity recognition shared task showed precision, recall and F1-score of 66.87{\\%}, 46.75{\\%} and 54.97{\\%}, respectively. For surface form evaluation, the CRF ensemble-based system achieved precision, recall and F1 scores of 65.18{\\%}, 45.20{\\%} and 53.30{\\%}. When applied to unseen test data, the model reached 47.92{\\%} precision, 31.97{\\%} recall and 38.55{\\%} F1-score for entity level evaluation, with the corresponding surface form evaluation values of 44.91{\\%}, 30.47{\\%} and 36.31{\\%}.","pages":"177--181","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W17-4424","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W17-4424","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Copenhagen, Denmark","year":"2017","month":"September","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Noisy User-generated Text"}]
