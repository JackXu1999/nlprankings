Sometimes papers using scientifically sound techniques present raw baselines that could be improved adding simple and cheap features. This work focuses on entity recognition for the clinical domain for three languages: English, Swedish and Spanish. The task is tackled using simple features, starting from the window size, capitalization, prefixes, and moving to POS and semantic tags. This work demonstrates that a simple initial step of feature engineering can improve the baseline results significantly. Hence, the contributions of this paper are: first, a short list of guidelines well supported with experimental results on three languages and, second, a detailed description of the relevance of these features for medical NER.","pages":"1--6","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W16-4201","publisher":"The COLING 2016 Organizing Committee","address":"Osaka, Japan","year":"2016","month":"December","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Clinical Natural Language Processing Workshop ({C}linical{NLP})"},{"id":"W16-4202","title":"Bidirectional {LSTM}-{CRF} for Clinical Concept Extraction","authors":["Chalapathy, Raghavendra","Zare Borzeshi, Ehsan","Piccardi, Massimo"],"emails":["rcha9612@uni.sydney.edu.au","ezborzeshi@cmcrc.com","iccardi@uts.edu.au"],"author_id":["raghavendra-chalapathy","ehsan-zare-borzeshi","massimo-piccardi"],"abstract":"Automated extraction of concepts from patient clinical records is an essential facilitator of clinical research. For this reason, the 2010 i2b2\/VA Natural Language Processing Challenges for Clinical Records introduced a concept extraction task aimed at identifying and classifying concepts into predefined categories (i.e., treatments, tests and problems). State-of-the-art concept extraction approaches heavily rely on handcrafted features and domain-specific resources which are hard to collect and define. For this reason, this paper proposes an alternative, streamlined approach: a recurrent neural network (the bidirectional LSTM with CRF decoding) initialized with general-purpose, off-the-shelf word embeddings. The experimental results achieved on the 2010 i2b2\/VA reference corpora using the proposed framework outperform all recent methods and ranks closely to the best submission from the original 2010 i2b2\/VA challenge.","pages":"7--12","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W16-4202","publisher":"The COLING 2016 Organizing Committee","address":"Osaka, Japan","year":"2016","month":"December","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Clinical Natural Language Processing Workshop ({C}linical{NLP})"},{"id":"W16-4203","title":"{M}ed{NLPD}oc: {J}apanese Shared Task for Clinical {NLP}","authors":["Aramaki, Eiji","Kano, Yoshinobu","Ohkuma, Tomoko","Morita, Mizuki"],"emails":["aramaki@is.naist.jp","kano@inf.shizuoka.ac.jp","tomokoohkuma@gmail.com","mizuki@okayama-u.ac.jp"],"author_id":["eiji-aramaki","yoshinobu-kano","tomoko-ohkuma","mizuki-morita"],"abstract":"Due to the recent replacements of physical documents with electronic medical records (EMR), the importance of information processing in medical fields has been increased.

However, to protect patients{'} privacy, Protected Health Information (PHI) must be removed from the patient notes before they can be legally released, a process known as patient note de-identification. The main objective for a de-identification system is to have the highest possible recall. Recently, the first neural-network-based de-identification system has been proposed, yielding state-of-the-art results. Unlike other systems, it does not rely on human-engineered features, which allows it to be quickly deployed, but does not leverage knowledge from human experts or from electronic health records (EHRs). In this work, we explore a method to incorporate human-engineered features as well as features derived from EHRs to a neural-network-based de-identification system. Our results show that the addition of features, especially the EHR-derived features, further improves the state-of-the-art in patient note de-identification, including for some of the most sensitive PHI types such as patient names. Since in a real-life setting patient notes typically come with EHRs, we recommend developers of de-identification systems to leverage the information EHRs contain.","pages":"17--22","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W16-4204","publisher":"The COLING 2016 Organizing Committee","address":"Osaka, Japan","year":"2016","month":"December","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Clinical Natural Language Processing Workshop ({C}linical{NLP})"},{"id":"W16-4205","title":"Semi-supervised Clustering of Medical Text","authors":["Sahoo, Pracheta","Ekbal, Asif","Saha, Sriparna","Moll{\\'a}, Diego","Nandan, Kaushik"],"emails":["pracheta.sahoo@utdallas.edu","asif@iitp.ac.in","sriparna@iitp.ac.in","diego.molla-aliod@mq.edu.au","kaushalta@gmail.com"],"author_id":["pracheta-sahoo","asif-ekbal","sriparna-saha","diego-molla","kaushik-nandan"],"abstract":"Semi-supervised clustering is an attractive alternative for traditional (unsupervised) clustering in targeted applications.

However, medical records enclose patient Private Health Information (PHI) which can reveal the identities of the patients. In order to retain the privacy of patients, it is mandatory to remove all the PHI information prior to making it publicly available. The aim is to de-identify or encrypt the PHI from the patient medical records. In this paper, we propose an algorithm based on deep learning architecture to solve this problem.

Clinical paraphrase generation is especially vital in building patient-centric clinical decision support (CDS) applications where users are able to understand complex clinical jargons via easily comprehensible alternative paraphrases. This paper presents Neural Clinical Paraphrase Generation (NCPG), a novel approach that casts the task as a monolingual neural machine translation (NMT) problem. We propose an end-to-end neural network built on an attention-based bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture with an encoder-decoder framework to perform the task. Conventional bilingual NMT models mostly rely on word-level modeling and are often limited by out-of-vocabulary (OOV) issues. In contrast, we represent the source and target paraphrase pairs as character sequences to address this limitation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that uses attention-based RNNs for clinical paraphrase generation and also proposes an end-to-end character-level modeling for this task. Extensive experiments on a large curated clinical paraphrase corpus show that the attention-based NCPG models achieve improvements of up to 5.2 BLEU points and 0.5 METEOR points over a non-attention based strong baseline for word-level modeling, whereas further gains of up to 6.1 BLEU points and 1.3 METEOR points are obtained by the character-level NCPG models over their word-level counterparts. Overall, our models demonstrate comparable performance relative to the state-of-the-art phrase-based non-neural models.","pages":"42--53","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W16-4207","publisher":"The COLING 2016 Organizing Committee","address":"Osaka, Japan","year":"2016","month":"December","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Clinical Natural Language Processing Workshop ({C}linical{NLP})"},{"id":"W16-4208","title":"Assessing the Corpus Size vs. Similarity Trade-off for Word Embeddings in Clinical {NLP}","authors":["Roberts, Kirk"],"emails":["kirk.roberts@uth.tmc.edu"],"author_id":["kirk-roberts"],"abstract":"The proliferation of deep learning methods in natural language processing (NLP) and the large amounts of data they often require stands in stark contrast to the relatively data-poor clinical NLP domain.

This forces a choice between building embeddings from small clinical corpora and less representative, larger corpora. This paper explores this trade-off, as well as intermediate compromise solutions. Two standard clinical NLP tasks (the i2b2 2010 concept and assertion tasks) are evaluated with commonly used deep learning models (recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks) using a set of six corpora ranging from the target i2b2 data to large open-domain datasets.

They constitute an ongoing challenge for natural language processing, due to their high compactness and abundance of short forms. German medical texts exhibit numerous ad-hoc abbreviations that terminate with a period character. The disambiguation of period characters is therefore an important task for sentence and abbreviation detection. This task is addressed by a combination of co-occurrence information of word types with trailing period characters, a large domain dictionary, and a simple rule engine, thus merging statistical and dictionary-based disambiguation strategies. An F-measure of 0.95 could be reached by using the unsupervised approach presented in this paper.
