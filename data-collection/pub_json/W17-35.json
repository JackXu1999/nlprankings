The languages in the Bantu language family have their own set of features distinct from other major groups, which therefore severely limits the options to bootstrap an NLG system from existing ones. We present here our first proof-of-concept application for knowledge-to-text NLG as a plugin to the Protege 5.x ontology development system, tailored to Runyankore, a Bantu language indigenous to Uganda. It comprises a basic annotation model for linguistic information such as noun class, an implementation of existing verbalisation rules and a CFG for verbs, and a basic interface for data entry.","pages":"154--155","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W17-3523","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W17-3523","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Santiago de Compostela, Spain","year":"2017","month":"September","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Natural Language Generation"},{"id":"W17-3524","title":"A working, non-trivial, topically indifferent {NLG} System for 17 languages","authors":["Wei{\\ss}graeber, Robert","Madsack, Andreas"],"emails":["robert.weissgraeber@ax-semantics.com","andreas.madsack@ax-semantics.com"],"author_id":["robert-weissgraeber","andreas-madsack"],"abstract":"A fully fledged practical working application for a rule-based NLG system is presented that is able to create non-trivial, human sounding narrative from structured data, in any language and for any topic.","pages":"156--157","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W17-3524","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W17-3524","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Santiago de Compostela, Spain","year":"2017","month":"September","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Natural Language Generation"},{"id":"W17-3525","title":"Generating titles for millions of browse pages on an e-Commerce site","authors":["Mathur, Prashant","Ueffing, Nicola","Leusch, Gregor"],"emails":["","",""],"author_id":["prashant-mathur","nicola-ueffing","gregor-leusch"],"abstract":"We present two approaches to generate titles for browse pages in five different languages, namely English, German, French, Italian and Spanish.

These attributes are related to a syntactico-semantic taxonomy representing the general relationships between conceptual and linguistic knowledge. User models are incorporated by distinguishing different user groups and relating each group to the appropriate conceptual attributes.
