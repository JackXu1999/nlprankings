It is based on conditional random fields (CRF), using local context information as features. We show that this approach can obtain results that, in some cases, approach more sophisticated parser-based MWE identification methods without requiring syntactic trees from a treebank. Moreover, we study how well the CRF can take into account external information coming from a lexicon.","pages":"167--175","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W17-1723","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W17-1723","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Valencia, Spain","year":"2017","month":"April","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 13th Workshop on Multiword Expressions ({MWE} 2017)"},{"id":"W17-1724","title":"Comparing Recurring Lexico-Syntactic Trees ({RLT}s) and Ngram Techniques for Extended Phraseology Extraction","authors":["Tutin, Agn{\\`e}s","Kraif, Olivier"],"emails":["agnes.tutin@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr","olivier.kraif@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr"],"author_id":["agnes-tutin","olivier-kraif"],"abstract":"This paper aims at assessing to what extent a syntax-based method (Recurring Lexico-syntactic Trees (RLT) extraction) allows us to extract large phraseological units such as prefabricated routines, e.g. {``}as previously said{''} or {``}as far as we\/I know{''} in scientific writing. In order to evaluate this method, we compare it to the classical ngram extraction technique, on a subset of recurring segments including speech verbs in a French corpus of scientific writing. Results show that the LRT extraction technique is far more efficient for extended MWEs such as routines or collocations but performs more poorly for surface phenomena such as syntactic constructions or fully frozen expressions.","pages":"176--180","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W17-1724","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W17-1724","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Valencia, Spain","year":"2017","month":"April","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 13th Workshop on Multiword Expressions ({MWE} 2017)"},{"id":"W17-1725","title":"Benchmarking Joint Lexical and Syntactic Analysis on Multiword-Rich Data","authors":["Constant, Matthieu","Martinez Alonso, H{\\'e}ctor"],"emails":["onstant@univ-lorraine.fr","hector.martinez-alonso@inria.fr"],"author_id":["matthieu-constant","hector-martinez-alonso"],"abstract":"This article evaluates the extension of a dependency parser that performs joint syntactic analysis and multiword expression identification.

Furthermore, by comparing against (semi)naive Bayes models, we demonstrate that manually modeling feature interactions is indeed important.
