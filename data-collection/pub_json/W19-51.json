MWEs come in all shapes and forms, including idioms like rock the boat (as cause problems or disturb a situation) and compound nouns like monkey business (as dishonest behaviour). Their accurate detection and understanding may often require more than knowledge about individual words and how they can be combined (Fillmore, 1979), as they may display various degrees of idiosyncrasy, including lexical, syntactic, semantic and statistical (Sag et al., 2002; Baldwin and Kim, 2010), which provide new challenges and opportunities for language processing (Constant et al., 2017). For instance, while for some combinations the meaning can be inferred from their parts like olive oil (oil made of olives) this is not always the case, as in dark horse (meaning an unknown candidate who unexpectedly succeeds), and when processing a sentence some of the challenges are to identify which words form an expression (Ramisch, 2015), and whether the expression is idiomatic (Cordeiro et al., 2019). In this talk I will give an overview of advances on the identification and treatment of multiword expressions, in particular concentrating on techniques for identifying their degree of idiomaticity.","pages":"1","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W19-5101","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W19-5101","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Florence, Italy","year":"2019","month":"August","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Joint Workshop on Multiword Expressions and WordNet (MWE-WN 2019)"},{"id":"W19-5102","title":"Hear about Verbal Multiword Expressions in the {B}ulgarian and the {R}omanian Wordnets Straight from the Horse{'}s Mouth","authors":["Barbu Mititelu, Verginica","Stoyanova, Ivelina","Leseva, Svetlozara","Mitrofan, Maria","Dimitrova, Tsvetana","Todorova, Maria"],"emails":["vergi@racai.ro","iva@dcl.bas.bg","zarka@dcl.bas.bg","maria@racai.ro","cvetana@dcl.bas.bg","maria@dcl.bas.bg"],"author_id":["verginica-barbu-mititelu","ivelina-stoyanova","svetlozara-leseva","maria-mitrofan","tsvetana-dimitrova","maria-todorova"],"abstract":"In this paper we focus on verbal multiword expressions (VMWEs) in Bulgarian and Romanian as reflected in the wordnets of the two languages.

The results show that the combination of dependency triples with raw frequency information is as powerful as the best association measures in most syntactic patterns and languages.

However, recent developments, driven notably by the PARSEME shared task on automatic identification of verbal MWEs, show that this task is harder than related tasks, despite recent contributions both in multilingual corpus annotation and in computational models. In this paper, we analyse possible reasons for this state of affairs. They lie in the nature of the MWE phenomenon, as well as in its distributional properties. We also offer a comparative analysis of the state-of-the-art systems, which exhibit particularly strong sensitivity to unseen data. On this basis, we claim that, in order to make strong headway in MWE identification, the community should bend its mind into coupling identification of MWEs with their discovery, via syntactic MWE lexicons. Such lexicons need not necessarily achieve a linguistically complete modelling of MWEs{'} behavior, but they should provide minimal morphosyntactic information to cover some potential uses, so as to complement existing MWE-annotated corpora. We define requirements for such minimal NLP-oriented lexicon, and we propose a roadmap for the MWE community driven by these requirements.","pages":"79--91","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W19-5110","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W19-5110","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Florence, Italy","year":"2019","month":"August","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Joint Workshop on Multiword Expressions and WordNet (MWE-WN 2019)"},{"id":"W19-5111","title":"A Systematic Comparison of {E}nglish Noun Compound Representations","authors":["Shwartz, Vered"],"emails":["vered1986@gmail.com"],"author_id":["vered-shwartz"],"abstract":"Building meaningful representations of noun compounds is not trivial since many of them scarcely appear in the corpus.

We compare various types of noun compound representations, including distributional, compositional, and paraphrase-based representations, through a series of tasks and analyses, and with an extensive number of underlying word embeddings. We find that indeed, in most cases, composition functions produce higher quality representations than distributional ones, and they improve with computational power.
