In this paper, we propose a novel query strategy for selecting {``}unlabeled{''} samples from a new domain based on sentence embeddings for Arabic. We accelerate the fine-tuning process of the generic model to the target domain. Specifically, our approach estimates the informativeness of instances from the target domain by comparing the distance of their sentence embeddings to embeddings from the generic domain. We perform machine translation experiments (Ar-to-En direction) for comparing a random sampling baseline with our new approach, similar to active learning, using two small update sets for simulating the work of human translators. For the prescribed setting we can save more than 50{\\%} of the annotation costs without loss in quality, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.","pages":"1--10","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W19-4601","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W19-4601","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Florence, Italy","year":"2019","month":"August","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Fourth Arabic Natural Language Processing Workshop"},{"id":"W19-4602","title":"Morphology-aware Word-Segmentation in Dialectal {A}rabic Adaptation of Neural Machine Translation","authors":["Tawfik, Ahmed","Emam, Mahitab","Essam, Khaled","Nabil, Robert","Hassan, Hany"],"emails":["atawfik@microsoft.com","a-maemam@microsoft.com","a-kessa@microsoft.com","a-ronabi@microsoft.com","hanyh@microsoft.com"],"author_id":["ahmed-tawfik","mahitab-emam","khaled-essam","robert-nabil","hany-hassan"],"abstract":"Parallel corpora available for building machine translation (MT) models for dialectal Arabic (DA) are rather limited.

Omitting diacritics leads to an increase in the number of homographs: different words with the same spelling. Diacritic restoration could theoretically help disambiguate these words, but in practice, the increase in overall sparsity leads to performance degradation in NLP applications. In this paper, we propose approaches for automatically marking a subset of words for diacritic restoration, which leads to selective homograph disambiguation. Compared to full or no diacritic restoration, these approaches yield selectively-diacritized datasets that balance sparsity and lexical disambiguation. We evaluate the various selection strategies extrinsically on several downstream applications: neural machine translation, part-of-speech tagging, and semantic textual similarity. Our experiments on Arabic show promising results, where our devised strategies on selective diacritization lead to a more balanced and consistent performance in downstream applications.","pages":"49--59","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W19-4606","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W19-4606","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Florence, Italy","year":"2019","month":"August","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Fourth Arabic Natural Language Processing Workshop"},{"id":"W19-4607","title":"{A}rabic Named Entity Recognition: What Works and What{'}s Next","authors":["Liu, Liyuan","Shang, Jingbo","Han, Jiawei"],"emails":["ll2@illinois.edu","shang7@illinois.edu","hanj@illinois.edu"],"author_id":["liyuan-liu","jingbo-shang","jiawei-han"],"abstract":"This paper presents the winning solution to the Arabic Named Entity Recognition challenge run by Topcoder.com.

In particular, universal language models (ULMs), such as recently developed BERT, have achieved state-of-the-art results in various NLP tasks in English.

The work aims at supporting the hypothesis by developing the first Universal Language Model in Arabic (hULMonA - \u062d\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0627 meaning our dream), demonstrating its use for Arabic classifications tasks, and demonstrating how a pre-trained multi-lingual BERT can also be used for Arabic. We then conduct a benchmark study to evaluate both ULM successes with Arabic sentiment analysis.

Segmentation will improve a system performance by reducing the number of OOVs, help isolate the differences and allow better utilization of the commonalities.
