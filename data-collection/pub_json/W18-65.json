The paper in hand scales down the general bias flipping task to focus on bias flipping for news article headlines. A manual annotation of headlines from each side reveals that headlines are self-informative in general and often convey bias. We apply an autoencoder incorporating information from an article{'}s content to learn how to automatically flip the bias.

For example a recommendation may consist of an explicitly evaluative utterance e.g. {``}Chanpen Thai is the best option.{''}, along with content related by the justification discourse relation, e.g. {``}It has great food and service.{''}, that combines multiple propositions into a single phrase. While neural generation methods integrate sentence planning and surface realization in one end-to-end learning framework, previous work has not shown that neural generators can: (1) perform common sentence planning and discourse structuring operations; (2) make decisions as to whether to realize content in a single sentence or over multiple sentences; (3) generalize sentence planning and discourse relation operations beyond what was seen in training. We systematically create large training corpora that exhibit particular sentence planning operations and then test neural models to see what they learn. We compare models without explicit latent variables for sentence planning with ones that provide explicit supervision during training. We show that only the models with additional supervision can reproduce sentence planning and discourse operations and generalize to situations unseen in training.","pages":"284--295","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W18-6535","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W18-6535","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Tilburg University, The Netherlands","year":"2018","month":"November","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Natural Language Generation"},{"id":"W18-6536","title":"Neural Generation of Diverse Questions using Answer Focus, Contextual and Linguistic Features","authors":["Harrison, Vrindavan","Walker, Marilyn"],"emails":["vharriso@ucsc.edu","mawalker@ucsc.edu"],"author_id":["vrindavan-harrison","marilyn-walker"],"abstract":"Question Generation is the task of automatically creating questions","pages":"296--306","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W18-6536","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W18-6536","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Tilburg University, The Netherlands","year":"2018","month":"November","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Natural Language Generation"},{"id":"W18-6537","title":"Evaluation methodologies in Automatic Question Generation 2013-2018","authors":["Amidei, Jacopo","Piwek, Paul","Willis, Alistair"],"emails":["jacopo.amidei@open.ac.uk","paul.piwek@open.ac.uk","alistair.willis@open.ac.uk"],"author_id":["jacopo-amidei","paul-piwek","alistair-willis"],"abstract":"In the last few years Automatic Question Generation (AQG) has attracted increasing interest.

A referring expression generation algorithm adapted to this task needs to continuously monitor the changes in the field of view of the observer, his relative position to the people being described, and the relative position of these people to any landmarks around them, and to take these changes into account in the referring expressions generated. This task presents two advantages: many of the mechanisms already available for static contexts may be applied with small adaptations, and it introduces the concept of changing conditions into the task of referring expression generation. In this paper we describe the design of an algorithm that takes these aspects into account in order to create descriptions of people within a 3D virtual environment. The evaluation of this algorithm has shown that, by changing the descriptions in real time according to the observers point of view, they are able to identify the described person quickly and effectively.","pages":"329--338","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W18-6540","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W18-6540","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Tilburg University, The Netherlands","year":"2018","month":"November","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Natural Language Generation"},{"id":"W18-6541","title":"{BENGAL}: An Automatic Benchmark Generator for Entity Recognition and Linking","authors":["Ngonga Ngomo, Axel-Cyrille","R{\\\"o}der, Michael","Moussallem, Diego","Usbeck, Ricardo","Speck, Ren{\\'e}"],"emails":["lastname@informatik.uni-leipzig.de","","","","first.lastname@upb.de"],"author_id":["axel-cyrille-ngonga-ngomo","michael-roder","diego-moussallem","ricardo-usbeck","rene-speck"],"abstract":"The manual creation of gold standards for named entity recognition and entity linking is time- and resource-intensive.

The experiments showed that our model outperformed a baseline with respect to both BLEU scores and accuracies in RTE.","pages":"408--414","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W18-6549","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W18-6549","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Tilburg University, The Netherlands","year":"2018","month":"November","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Natural Language Generation"},{"id":"W18-6550","title":"Talking about other people: an endless range of possibilities","authors":["van Miltenburg, Emiel","Elliott, Desmond","Vossen, Piek"],"emails":["iltenburg@uvt.nl","de@di.ku.dk","piek.vossen@vu.nl"],"author_id":["emiel-van-miltenburg","desmond-elliott","piek-vossen"],"abstract":"Image description datasets, such as Flickr30K and MS COCO, show a high degree of variation in the ways that crowd-workers talk about the world.

We then automatically label the training data to allow us to conduct two kinds of experiments with a neural generator. First, we test the effect of training the system with different stylistic partitions and quantify the effect of smaller, but more stylistically controlled training data. Second, we try a method of labeling the style variants during training, and show that we can modify the style of the output to some extent using our stylistic labels. We contrast and compare these methods that can be used with any existing large corpus, showing how they vary in terms of semantic quality and stylistic control.","pages":"441--450","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W18-6554","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W18-6554","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Tilburg University, The Netherlands","year":"2018","month":"November","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Natural Language Generation"},{"id":"W18-6555","title":"Char2char Generation with Reranking for the {E}2{E} {NLG} Challenge","authors":["Agarwal, Shubham","Dymetman, Marc","Gaussier, {\\'E}ric"],"emails":["sa201@hw.ac.uk","marc.dymetman@naverlabs.com","aussier@imag.fr"],"author_id":["shubham-agarwal","marc-dymetman","eric-gaussier"],"abstract":"This paper describes our submission to","pages":"451--456","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W18-6555","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W18-6555","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Tilburg University, The Netherlands","year":"2018","month":"November","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Natural Language Generation"},{"id":"W18-6556","title":"{E}2{E} {NLG} Challenge Submission: Towards Controllable Generation of Diverse Natural Language","authors":["Elder, Henry","Gehrmann, Sebastian","O{'}Connor, Alexander","Liu, Qun"],"emails":["henry.elder@adaptcentre.ie","gehrmann@g.harvard.edu","alexander@pivotusventures.com","qun.liu@adaptcentre.ie"],"author_id":["henry-elder","sebastian-gehrmann","alexander-oconnor","qun-liu"],"abstract":"In natural language generation (NLG), the task is to generate utterances from a more abstract input, such as structured data.

Most work focusses on how to train RNNs, even though also decoding is not necessarily straightforward: previous work on neural MT found seq2seq models to radically prefer short candidates, and has proposed a number of beam search heuristics to deal with this. In this work, we assess decoding strategies for referring expression generation with neural models. Here, expression length is crucial: output should neither contain too much or too little information, in order to be pragmatically adequate. We find that most beam search heuristics developed for MT do not generalize well to referring expression generation (REG), and do not generally outperform greedy decoding. We observe that beam search heuristics for termination seem to override the model{'}s knowledge of what a good stopping point is. Therefore, we also explore a recent approach called trainable decoding, which uses a small network to modify the RNN{'}s hidden state for better decoding results. We find this approach to consistently outperform greedy decoding for REG.","pages":"503--512","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W18-6563","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W18-6563","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Tilburg University, The Netherlands","year":"2018","month":"November","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Natural Language Generation"}]
