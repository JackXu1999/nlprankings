We describe the motivation, setup, and participation of the shared task, provide discussion of some highlighted results, and discuss lessons learned.","pages":"1--10","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W17-5401","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W17-5401","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Copenhagen, Denmark","year":"2017","month":"September","booktitle":"Proceedings of the First Workshop on Building Linguistically Generalizable {NLP} Systems"},{"id":"W17-5402","title":"Analysing Errors of Open Information Extraction Systems","authors":["Schneider, Rudolf","Oberhauser, Tom","Klatt, Tobias","Gers, Felix A.","L{\\\"o}ser, Alexander"],"emails":["rudolf.schneider@beuth-hochschule.de","tom.oberhauser@beuth-hochschule.de","tobias.klatt@beuth-hochschule.de","gers@beuth-hochschule.de","aloeser@beuth-hochschule.de"],"author_id":["rudolf-schneider","tom-oberhauser","tobias-klatt","felix-a-gers","alexander-loser"],"abstract":"We report results on benchmarking Open Information Extraction (OIE) systems using RelVis, a toolkit for benchmarking Open Information Extraction systems. Our comprehensive benchmark contains three data sets from the news domain and one data set from Wikipedia with overall 4522 labeled sentences and 11243 binary or n-ary OIE relations. In our analysis on these data sets we compared the performance of four popular OIE systems, ClausIE, OpenIE 4.2, Stanford OpenIE and PredPatt. In addition, we evaluated the impact of five common error classes on a subset of 749 n-ary tuples. From our deep analysis we unreveal important research directions for a next generation on OIE systems.","pages":"11--18","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W17-5402","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W17-5402","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Copenhagen, Denmark","year":"2017","month":"September","booktitle":"Proceedings of the First Workshop on Building Linguistically Generalizable {NLP} Systems"},{"id":"W17-5403","title":"Massively Multilingual Neural Grapheme-to-Phoneme Conversion","authors":["Peters, Ben","Dehdari, Jon","van Genabith, Josef"],"emails":["benzurdopeters@gmail.com","jon.dehdari@dfki.de","josef.van genabith@dfki.de"],"author_id":["ben-peters","jon-dehdari","josef-van-genabith"],"abstract":"Grapheme-to-phoneme conversion (g2p) is necessary for text-to-speech and automatic speech recognition systems. Most g2p systems are monolingual: they require language-specific data or handcrafting of rules. Such systems are difficult to extend to low resource languages, for which data and handcrafted rules are not available. As an alternative, we present a neural sequence-to-sequence approach to g2p which is trained on spelling{--}pronunciation pairs in hundreds of languages. The system shares a single encoder and decoder across all languages, allowing it to utilize the intrinsic similarities between different writing systems. We show an 11{\\%} improvement in phoneme error rate over an approach based on adapting high-resource monolingual g2p models to low-resource languages. Our model is also much more compact relative to previous approaches.","pages":"19--26","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W17-5403","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W17-5403","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Copenhagen, Denmark","year":"2017","month":"September","booktitle":"Proceedings of the First Workshop on Building Linguistically Generalizable {NLP} Systems"},{"id":"W17-5404","title":"{BIBI} System Description: Building with {CNN}s and Breaking with Deep Reinforcement Learning","authors":["Li, Yitong","Cohn, Trevor","Baldwin, Timothy"],"emails":["yitongl4@student.unimelb.edu.au","tcohn@unimelb.edu.au","tbaldwin@unimelb.edu.au"],"author_id":["yitong-li","trevor-cohn","timothy-baldwin"],"abstract":"This paper describes our submission to the sentiment analysis sub-task of {``}Build It, Break It: The Language Edition (BIBI){''}, on both the builder and breaker sides.

In this task, a query, is a sentence extracted from either a summary or a plot of an episode in a TV show, and the target document consists of transcripts from the corresponding episode. To establish a strong baseline, we employ the current state-of-the-art search engine to perform document retrieval on the dataset collected for this work. We then introduce a structure reranking approach to improve the initial ranking by utilizing syntactic and semantic structures generated by NLP tools. Our evaluation shows an improvement of more than 4{\\%} when the structure reranking is applied, which is very promising.","pages":"48--53","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W17-5407","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W17-5407","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Copenhagen, Denmark","year":"2017","month":"September","booktitle":"Proceedings of the First Workshop on Building Linguistically Generalizable {NLP} Systems"},{"id":"W17-5408","title":"{ACTSA}: Annotated Corpus for {T}elugu Sentiment Analysis","authors":["Mukku, Sandeep Sricharan","Mamidi, Radhika"],"emails":["sandeep.mukku@research.iiit.ac.in","radhika.mamidi@iiit.ac.in"],"author_id":["sandeep-sricharan-mukku","radhika-mamidi"],"abstract":"Sentiment analysis deals with the task of determining the polarity of a document or sentence and has received a lot of attention in recent years for the English language.

In this paper, we describe an effort to build a gold-standard annotated corpus of Telugu sentences to support Telugu Sentiment Analysis.
