That seminal work used word co-occurrence features to represent the meaning of the nouns. Even though the task does not impose any specific type of semantic representation, the vast majority of subsequent approaches resort to feature-based models or to semantic spaces (aka word embeddings). We address this task, with competitive results, by using instead a semantic network to encode lexical semantics, thus providing further evidence for the cognitive plausibility of this approach to model lexical meaning.","pages":"1--5","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W18-2801","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W18-2801","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Melbourne","year":"2018","month":"July","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Eight Workshop on Cognitive Aspects of Computational Language Learning and Processing"},{"id":"W18-2802","title":"Do Speakers Produce Discourse Connectives Rationally?","authors":["Yung, Frances","Demberg, Vera"],"emails":["frances@coli.uni-saarland.de","vera@coli.uni-saarland.de"],"author_id":["frances-yung","vera-demberg"],"abstract":"A number of different discourse connectives can be used to mark the same discourse relation, but it is unclear what factors affect connective choice. One recent account is the Rational Speech Acts theory, which predicts that speakers try to maximize the informativeness of an utterance such that the listener can interpret the intended meaning correctly. Existing prior work uses referential language games to test the rational account of speakers{'} production of concrete meanings, such as identification of objects within a picture. Building on the same paradigm, we design a novel Discourse Continuation Game to investigate speakers{'} production of abstract discourse relations. Experimental results reveal that speakers significantly prefer a more informative connective, in line with predictions of the RSA model.","pages":"6--16","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W18-2802","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W18-2802","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Melbourne","year":"2018","month":"July","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Eight Workshop on Cognitive Aspects of Computational Language Learning and Processing"},{"id":"W18-2803","title":"Language Production Dynamics with Recurrent Neural Networks","authors":["Calvillo, Jes{\\'u}s","Crocker, Matthew"],"emails":["jesusc@coli.uni-saarland.de","crocker@coli.uni-saarland.de"],"author_id":["jesus-calvillo","matthew-crocker"],"abstract":"We present an analysis of the internal mechanism of the recurrent neural model of sentence production presented by Calvillo et al.

However, existing models only read the text once, it cannot describe the situation of repeated reading in reading comprehension. In fact, when reading or analyzing a text, we may read the text several times rather than once if we couldn{'}t well understand it. So, how to model this kind of the reading behavior? To address the issue, we propose a multi-glance mechanism (MGM) for modeling the habit of reading behavior. In the proposed framework, the actual reading process can be fully simulated, and then the obtained information can be consistent with the task. Based on the multi-glance mechanism, we design two types of recurrent neural network models for repeated reading: Glance Cell Model (GCM) and Glance Gate Model (GGM). Visualization analysis of the GCM and the GGM demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-glance mechanisms. Experiments results on the large-scale datasets show that the proposed methods can achieve better performance.","pages":"27--35","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W18-2804","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W18-2804","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Melbourne","year":"2018","month":"July","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Eight Workshop on Cognitive Aspects of Computational Language Learning and Processing"},{"id":"W18-2805","title":"Predicting {J}apanese Word Order in Double Object Constructions","authors":["Asahara, Masayuki","Nambu, Satoshi","Sano, Shin-Ichiro"],"emails":["masayu-a@ninjal.ac.jp","satoshi.nambu@monash.edu","s-sano@keio.jp"],"author_id":["masayuki-asahara","satoshi-nambu","shin-ichiro-sano"],"abstract":"This paper presents a statistical model to predict Japanese word order in the double object constructions.

The first method is applicable to models computing average acceptability ratings. For these models, we propose an extension that simulates a full rating distribution (instead of average ratings) and allows generating individual ratings. Our second method enables Bayesian inference for models generating individual data. To this end, we propose to use the cross-match test (Rosenbaum, 2005) as a likelihood function. We exemplarily present both methods using cognitive models from the domain of spatial language use. For spatial language use, determining linguistic acceptability judgments of a spatial preposition for a depicted spatial relation is assumed to be a crucial process (Logan and Sadler, 1996). Existing models of this process compute an average acceptability rating. We extend the models and {--} based on existing data {--} show that the extended models allow extracting more information from the empirical data and yield more readily interpretable information about model successes and failures. Applying Bayesian inference, we find that model performance relies less on mechanisms of capturing geometrical aspects than on mapping the captured geometry to a rating interval.","pages":"47--55","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W18-2807","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W18-2807","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Melbourne","year":"2018","month":"July","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Eight Workshop on Cognitive Aspects of Computational Language Learning and Processing"},{"id":"W18-2808","title":"The Role of Syntax During Pronoun Resolution: Evidence from f{MRI}","authors":["Li, Jixing","Fabre, Murielle","Luh, Wen-Ming","Hale, John"],"emails":["jl2939@cornell.edu","mf684@cornell.edu","wl358@cornell.edu","jthale@cornell.edu"],"author_id":["jixing-li","murielle-fabre","wen-ming-luh","john-hale"],"abstract":"The current study examined the role of syntactic structure during pronoun resolution.
