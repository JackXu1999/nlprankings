However, annotated healthcare datasets tend to be small and expensive to obtain, which raises the question of how to make maximally efficient uses of the available data. To this end, we develop an LSTM-CRF model for combining unsupervised word representations and hand-built feature representations derived from publicly available healthcare ontologies. We show that this combined model yields superior performance on five datasets of diverse kinds of healthcare text (clinical, social, scientific, commercial). Each involves the labeling of complex, multi-word spans that pick out different healthcare concepts. We also introduce a new labeled dataset for identifying the treatment relations between drugs and diseases.","pages":"1--14","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W19-1901","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W19-1901","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","year":"2019","month":"June","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2nd Clinical Natural Language Processing Workshop"},{"id":"W19-1902","title":"An Analysis of Attention over Clinical Notes for Predictive Tasks","authors":["Jain, Sarthak","Mohammadi, Ramin","Wallace, Byron C."],"emails":["jain.sar@husky.neu.edu","mohammadi.r@husky.neu.edu","b.wallace@northeastern.edu"],"author_id":["sarthak-jain","ramin-mohammadi","byron-c-wallace"],"abstract":"The shift to electronic medical records (EMRs) has engendered research into machine learning and natural language technologies to analyze patient records, and to predict from these clinical outcomes of interest. Two observations motivate our aims here. First, unstructured notes contained within EMR often contain key information, and hence should be exploited by models. Second, while strong predictive performance is important, interpretability of models is perhaps equally so for applications in this domain. Together, these points suggest that neural models for EMR may benefit from incorporation of attention over notes, which one may hope will both yield performance gains and afford transparency in predictions. In this work we perform experiments to explore this question using two EMR corpora and four different predictive tasks, that: (i) inclusion of attention mechanisms is critical for neural encoder modules that operate over notes fields in order to yield competitive performance, but, (ii) unfortunately, while these boost predictive performance, it is decidedly less clear whether they provide meaningful support for predictions.","pages":"15--21","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W19-1902","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W19-1902","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","year":"2019","month":"June","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2nd Clinical Natural Language Processing Workshop"},{"id":"W19-1903","title":"Extracting Adverse Drug Event Information with Minimal Engineering","authors":["Miller, Timothy","Geva, Alon","Dligach, Dmitriy"],"emails":["timothy.miller@childrens.harvard.edu","alon.geva@childrens.harvard.edu","2ddligach@luc.edu"],"author_id":["timothy-miller","alon-geva","dmitriy-dligach"],"abstract":"In this paper we describe an evaluation of the potential of classical information extraction methods to extract drug-related attributes, including adverse drug events, and compare to more recently developed neural methods.
