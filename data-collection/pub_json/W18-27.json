Our empirical observations have showed that when the mt is incorrect, the attention shifts weight toward tokens in the src sentence to properly edit the incorrect translation. The model has been trained and evaluated on the official data from the WMT16 and WMT17 APE IT domain English-German shared tasks. Additionally, we have used the extra 500K artificial data provided by the shared task.

Neural machine translation (NMT) systems often assume this information is captured by an attention mechanism and a decoder that ensures fluency. Recent work has shown that incorporating explicit syntax alleviates the burden of modeling both types of knowledge. However, requiring parses is expensive and does not explore the question of what syntax a model needs during translation. To address both of these issues we introduce a model that simultaneously translates while inducing dependency trees. In this way, we leverage the benefits of structure while investigating what syntax NMT must induce to maximize performance. We show that our dependency trees are 1. language pair dependent and 2. improve translation quality.","pages":"25--35","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W18-2704","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W18-2704","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Melbourne, Australia","year":"2018","month":"July","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Neural Machine Translation and Generation"},{"id":"W18-2705","title":"Regularized Training Objective for Continued Training for Domain Adaptation in Neural Machine Translation","authors":["Khayrallah, Huda","Thompson, Brian","Duh, Kevin","Koehn, Philipp"],"emails":["huda@jhu.edu","brian.thompson@jhu.edu","kevinduh@cs.jhu.edu","phi@cs.jhu.edu"],"author_id":["huda-khayrallah","brian-thompson","kevin-duh","philipp-koehn"],"abstract":"Supervised domain adaptation{---}where a large generic corpus and a smaller in-domain corpus are both available for training{---}is a challenge for neural machine translation (NMT).

Our technique trains a single model for both directions of a language pair, allowing us to back-translate source or target monolingual data without requiring an auxiliary model.

In this paper, we examine approaches for multi-source neural machine translation (NMT) using an incomplete multilingual corpus in which some translations are missing. In practice, many multilingual corpora are not complete due to the difficulty to provide translations in all of the relevant languages (for example, in TED talks, most English talks only have subtitles for a small portion of the languages that TED supports). Existing studies on multi-source translation did not explicitly handle such situations. This study focuses on the use of incomplete multilingual corpora in multi-encoder NMT and mixture of NMT experts and examines a very simple implementation where missing source translations are replaced by a special symbol {\\textless}NULL{\\textgreater}. These methods allow us to use incomplete corpora both at training time and test time.
