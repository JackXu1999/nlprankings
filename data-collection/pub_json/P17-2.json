Some candidates will be a poor match to the training data set, undermining the validity of the predicted grade. For high stakes tests it is essential for such systems not only to grade well, but also to provide a measure of their uncertainty in their predictions, enabling rejection to human graders. Previous work examined Gaussian Process (GP) graders which, though successful, do not scale well with large data sets. Deep Neural Network (DNN) may also be used to provide uncertainty using Monte-Carlo Dropout (MCD). This paper proposes a novel method to yield uncertainty and compares it to GPs and DNNs with MCD. The proposed approach explicitly teaches a DNN to have low uncertainty on training data and high uncertainty on generated artificial data.

We propose a general, novel method for exploiting such resources via weight sharing. Prior work on weight sharing in neural networks has considered it largely as a means of model compression. In contrast, we treat weight sharing as a flexible mechanism for incorporating prior knowledge into neural models. We show that this approach consistently yields improved performance on classification tasks compared to baseline strategies that do not exploit weight sharing.","pages":"155--160","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/P17-2024","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/P17-2024","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Vancouver, Canada","year":"2017","month":"July","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 2: Short Papers)"},{"id":"P17-2025","title":"Improving Neural Parsing by Disentangling Model Combination and Reranking Effects","authors":["Fried, Daniel","Stern, Mitchell","Klein, Dan"],"emails":["dfried@cs.berkeley.edu","mitchell@cs.berkeley.edu","klein@cs.berkeley.edu"],"author_id":["daniel-fried","mitchell-stern","dan-klein"],"abstract":"Recent work has proposed several generative neural models for constituency parsing that achieve state-of-the-art results.

We present two approaches to learn multiple topic-sensitive representations per word by using Hierarchical Dirichlet Process. We observe that by modeling topics and integrating topic distributions for each document we obtain representations that are able to distinguish between different meanings of a given word. Our models yield statistically significant improvements for the lexical substitution task indicating that commonly used single word representations, even when combined with contextual information, are insufficient for this task.","pages":"441--447","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/P17-2070","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/P17-2070","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Vancouver, Canada","year":"2017","month":"July","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 2: Short Papers)"},{"id":"P17-2071","title":"Temporal Word Analogies: Identifying Lexical Replacement with Diachronic Word Embeddings","authors":["Szymanski, Terrence"],"emails":["terrence.szymanski@insight-centre.org"],"author_id":["terrence-szymanski"],"abstract":"This paper introduces the concept of temporal word analogies: pairs of words which occupy the same semantic space at different points in time.
