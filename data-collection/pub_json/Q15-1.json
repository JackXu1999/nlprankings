This paper takes some key steps towards facilitating reasoning about quantities expressed in natural language. We investigate two different tasks of numerical reasoning. First, we consider Quantity Entailment, a new task formulated to understand the role of quantities in general textual inference tasks. Second, we consider the problem of automatically understanding and solving elementary school math word problems. In order to address these quantitative reasoning problems we first develop a computational approach which we show to successfully recognize and normalize textual expressions of quantities. We then use these capabilities to further develop algorithms to assist reasoning in the context of the aforementioned tasks.","pages":"1--13","doi":"10.1162\/tacl_a_00118","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/Q15-1001","year":"2015","volume":"3","journal":"Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics"},{"id":"Q15-1002","title":"Cross-Document Co-Reference Resolution using Sample-Based Clustering with Knowledge Enrichment","authors":["Dutta, Sourav","Weikum, Gerhard"],"emails":["sdutta@mpi-inf.mpg.de","weikum@mpi-inf.mpg.de"],"author_id":["sourav-dutta","gerhard-weikum"],"abstract":"Identifying and linking named entities across information sources is the basis of knowledge acquisition and at the heart of Web search, recommendations, and analytics. An important problem in this context is cross-document co-reference resolution (CCR): computing equivalence classes of textual mentions denoting the same entity, within and across documents. Prior methods employ ranking, clustering, or probabilistic graphical models using syntactic features and distant features from knowledge bases. However, these methods exhibit limitations regarding run-time and robustness. This paper presents the CROCS framework for unsupervised CCR, improving the state of the art in two ways. First, we extend the way knowledge bases are harnessed, by constructing a notion of semantic summaries for intra-document co-reference chains using co-occurring entity mentions belonging to different chains. Second, we reduce the computational cost by a new algorithm that embeds sample-based bisection, using spectral clustering or graph partitioning, in a hierarchical clustering process. This allows scaling up CCR to large corpora. Experiments with three datasets show significant gains in output quality, compared to the best prior methods, and the run-time efficiency of CROCS.","pages":"15--28","doi":"10.1162\/tacl_a_00119","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/Q15-1002","year":"2015","volume":"3","journal":"Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics"},{"id":"Q15-1003","title":"Efficient Inference and Structured Learning for Semantic Role Labeling","authors":["T{\\\"a}ckstr{\\\"o}m, Oscar","Ganchev, Kuzman","Das, Dipanjan"],"emails":["oscart@google.com","kuzman@google.com","dipanjand@google.com"],"author_id":["oscar-tackstrom","kuzman-ganchev","dipanjan-das"],"abstract":"We present a dynamic programming algorithm for efficient constrained inference in semantic role labeling.

For phrase-based models, recent work has shown that on-demand grammar extraction can be greatly accelerated by parallelization on general purpose graphics processing units (GPUs), but these algorithms do not work for hierarchical models, which require matching patterns that contain gaps. We address this limitation by presenting a novel GPU algorithm for on-demand hierarchical grammar extraction that is at least an order of magnitude faster than a comparable CPU algorithm when processing large batches of sentences. In terms of end-to-end translation, with decoding on the CPU, we increase throughput by roughly two thirds on a standard MT evaluation dataset.

Manual annotation is too expensive to scale to a comprehensive set of relations. Distant supervision, which automatically creates training data, only works with relations that already populate a knowledge base (KB). Unfortunately, KBs such as FreeBase rarely cover event relations (e.g. {``}person travels to location{''}). Thus, the problem of extracting a wide range of events {---} e.g., from news streams {---} is an important, open challenge. This paper introduces NewsSpike-RE, a novel, unsupervised algorithm that discovers event relations and then learns to extract them. NewsSpike-RE uses a novel probabilistic graphical model to cluster sentences describing similar events from parallel news streams. These clusters then comprise training data for the extractor.

Our approach relies on two key observations. First, objects can be seen as bundles of attributes, typically expressed as adjectival modifiers (a dog is something furry, brown, etc.), and thus a function trained to map visual representations of objects to nominal labels can implicitly learn to map attributes to adjectives. Second, objects and attributes come together in pictures (the same thing is a dog and it is brown). We can thus achieve better attribute (and object) label retrieval by treating images as {``}visual phrases{''}, and decomposing their linguistic representation into an attribute-denoting adjective and an object-denoting noun.

All this knowledge is then used to estimate the semantic similarity between question and answer candidates.

Using a corpus of 10,000 questions from Yahoo!
