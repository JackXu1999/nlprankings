In this work, we leverage eye movement features from three corpora with recorded gaze information to augment a state-of-the-art neural model for named entity recognition (NER) with gaze embeddings. These corpora were manually annotated with named entity labels. Moreover, we show how gaze features, generalized on word type level, eliminate the need for recorded eye-tracking data at test time. The gaze-augmented models for NER using token-level and type-level features outperform the baselines. We present the benefits of eye-tracking features by evaluating the NER models on both individual datasets as well as in cross-domain settings.","pages":"1--10","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/N19-1001","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/N19-1001","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","year":"2019","month":"June","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North {A}merican Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers)"},{"id":"N19-1002","title":"The emergence of number and syntax units in {LSTM} language models","authors":["Lakretz, Yair","Kruszewski, German","Desbordes, Theo","Hupkes, Dieuwke","Dehaene, Stanislas","Baroni, Marco"],"emails":["yair.lakretz@gmail.com","germank@gmail.com","tdesbordes@fb.com","d.hupkes@uva.nl","stanislas.dehaene@gmail.com","mbaroni@fb.com"],"author_id":["yair-lakretz","german-kruszewski","theo-desbordes","dieuwke-hupkes","stanislas-dehaene","marco-baroni"],"abstract":"Recent work has shown that LSTMs trained on a generic language modeling objective capture syntax-sensitive generalizations such as long-distance number agreement.

In this work, we tackle the above challenges by introducing a new data sampling technique based on spaced repetition that dynamically samples informative and diverse unlabeled instances with respect to individual learner and instance characteristics.

Several time-locked stereotyped EEG responses to word-presentations {--} known collectively as event-related potentials (ERPs) {--} are thought to be markers for semantic or syntactic processes that take place during comprehension. However, the characterization of each individual ERP in terms of what features of a stream of language trigger the response remains controversial. Improving this characterization would make ERPs a more useful tool for studying language comprehension. We take a step towards better understanding the ERPs by finetuning a language model to predict them. This new approach to analysis shows for the first time that all of the ERPs are predictable from embeddings of a stream of language. Prior work has only found two of the ERPs to be predictable. In addition to this analysis, we examine which ERPs benefit from sharing parameters during joint training. We find that two pairs of ERPs previously identified in the literature as being related to each other benefit from joint training, while several other pairs of ERPs that benefit from joint training are suggestive of potential relationships. Extensions of this analysis that further examine what kinds of information in the model embeddings relate to each ERP have the potential to elucidate the processes involved in human language comprehension.","pages":"43--57","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/N19-1005","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/N19-1005","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","year":"2019","month":"June","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North {A}merican Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers)"},{"id":"N19-1006","title":"Pre-training on high-resource speech recognition improves low-resource speech-to-text translation","authors":["Bansal, Sameer","Kamper, Herman","Livescu, Karen","Lopez, Adam","Goldwater, Sharon"],"emails":["sameer.bansal@inf.ed.ac.uk","kamperh@sun.ac.za","klivescu@ttic.edu","alopez@inf.ed.ac.uk","sgwater@inf.ed.ac.uk"],"author_id":["sameer-bansal","herman-kamper","karen-livescu","adam-lopez","sharon-goldwater"],"abstract":"We present a simple approach to improve direct speech-to-text translation (ST) when the source language is low-resource: we pre-train the model on a high-resource automatic speech recognition (ASR) task, and then fine-tune its parameters for ST.

The problem of right-adjunction is more resistant to solution, and has been tackled in the past using revealing-based approaches that often rely either on the higher-order unification over lambda terms (Pareschi and Steedman,1987) or heuristics over dependency representations that do not cover the whole CCGbank (Ambati et al., 2015).

This algorithm can cover the whole CCGbank, with greater incrementality and accuracy than previous proposals.","pages":"228--239","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/N19-1020","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/N19-1020","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","year":"2019","month":"June","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North {A}merican Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers)"},{"id":"N19-1021","title":"Cyclical Annealing Schedule: A Simple Approach to Mitigating {KL} Vanishing","authors":["Fu, Hao","Li, Chunyuan","Liu, Xiaodong","Gao, Jianfeng","Celikyilmaz, Asli","Carin, Lawrence"],"emails":["hao.fu@duke.edu","aslicel@microsoft.com","xiaodl@microsoft.com","jfgao@microsoft.com","chunyl@microsoft.com","lcarin@duke.edu"],"author_id":["hao-fu","chunyuan-li","xiaodong-liu","jianfeng-gao","asli-celikyilmaz","lawrence-carin"],"abstract":"Variational autoencoders (VAE) with an auto-regressive decoder have been applied for many natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

In this paper we study different scheduling schemes for $\\beta$, and show that KL vanishing is caused by the lack of good latent codes in training decoder at the beginning of optimization. To remedy the issue, we propose a cyclical annealing schedule, which simply repeats the process of increasing $\\beta$ multiple times. This new procedure allows us to learn more meaningful latent codes progressively by leveraging the results of previous learning cycles as warm re-restart. The effectiveness of cyclical annealing schedule is validated on a broad range of NLP tasks, including language modeling, dialog response generation and semi-supervised text classification.","pages":"240--250","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/N19-1021","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/N19-1021","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","year":"2019","month":"June","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North {A}merican Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers)"},{"id":"N19-1022","title":"Recurrent models and lower bounds for projective syntactic decoding","authors":["Schluter, Natalie"],"emails":["natschluter@itu.dk"],"author_id":["natalie-schluter"],"abstract":"The current state-of-the-art in neural graph-based parsing uses only approximate decoding at the training phase.

To the best of our knowledge, our work presents the first approach that eliminates the need for world-level negation labels, replacing it instead with document-level sentiment annotations. For this, we present a novel strategy for learning fully interpretable negation rules via weak supervision: we apply reinforcement learning to find a policy that reconstructs negation rules from sentiment predictions at document level. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach for weak supervision can effectively learn negation rules. Furthermore, an out-of-sample evaluation via sentiment analysis reveals consistent improvements (of up to 4.66{\\%}) over both a sentiment analysis with (i) no negation handling and (ii) the use of word-level annotations from humans. Moreover, the inferred negation rules are fully interpretable.","pages":"407--413","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/N19-1038","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/N19-1038","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","year":"2019","month":"June","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North {A}merican Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers)"},{"id":"N19-1039","title":"Simplified Neural Unsupervised Domain Adaptation","authors":["Miller, Timothy"],"emails":["timothy.miller@childrens.harvard.edu"],"author_id":["timothy-miller"],"abstract":"Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is the task of training a statistical model on labeled data from a source domain to achieve better performance on data from a target domain, with access to only unlabeled data in the target domain.

After abstracting away from differences of convention or formalism, we find that most content divergences can be ascribed to: (1) UCCA{'}s distinction between a Scene and a non-Scene; (2) UCCA{'}s distinction between primary relations, secondary ones and participants; (3) different treatment of multi-word expressions, and (4) different treatment of inter-clause linkage.

To better understand controversial issues, one needs to view them from a diverse yet comprehensive set of perspectives. For example, there are many ways to respond to a claim such as {``}animals should have lawful rights{''}, and these responses form a spectrum of perspectives, each with a stance relative to this claim and, ideally, with evidence supporting it. Inherently, this is a natural language understanding task, and we propose to address it as such. Specifically, we propose the task of substantiated perspective discovery where, given a claim, a system is expected to discover a diverse set of well-corroborated perspectives that take a stance with respect to the claim. Each perspective should be substantiated by evidence paragraphs which summarize pertinent results and facts. We construct PERSPECTRUM, a dataset of claims, perspectives and evidence, making use of online debate websites to create the initial data collection, and augmenting it using search engines in order to expand and diversify our dataset.

In order to create novel metaphors, we propose a neural approach to metaphor generation and explore the shared inferential structure of a metaphorical usage and a literal usage of a verb. Our approach does not require any manually annotated metaphors for training. We extract the metaphorically used verbs with their metaphorical senses in an unsupervised way and train a neural language model from wiki corpus. Then we generate metaphors conveying the assigned metaphorical senses with an improved decoding algorithm. Automatic metrics and human evaluations demonstrate that our approach can generate metaphors with good readability and creativity.","pages":"861--871","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/N19-1092","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/N19-1092","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","year":"2019","month":"June","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North {A}merican Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers)"},{"id":"N19-1093","title":"Incorporating Context and External Knowledge for Pronoun Coreference Resolution","authors":["Zhang, Hongming","Song, Yan","Song, Yangqiu"],"emails":["hzhangal@cse.ust.hk","clksong@gmail.com","yqsong@cse.ust.hk"],"author_id":["hongming-zhang","yan-song","yangqiu-song"],"abstract":"Linking pronominal expressions to the correct references requires, in many cases, better analysis of the contextual information and external knowledge.

In this work, we deliver such a study focusing on the variation of two crucial components required for subword-level integration into word representation models: 1) segmentation of words into subword units, and 2) subword composition functions to obtain final word representations.

Our unsupervised mapping approach is motivated by the hypothesis that words preserving their relative distances in different topic semantic sub-spaces constitute robust semantic anchors that define the mappings between them. Aligned cross-topic representations achieve state-of-the-art results for the task of contextual word similarity. Furthermore, evaluation on NLP downstream tasks shows that multiple topic-based embeddings outperform single-prototype models.","pages":"1052--1061","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/N19-1110","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/N19-1110","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","year":"2019","month":"June","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North {A}merican Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers)"},{"id":"N19-1111","title":"What just happened? {E}valuating retrofitted distributional word vectors","authors":["Hayes, Dmetri"],"emails":["dmetri@berkeley.edu"],"author_id":["dmetri-hayes"],"abstract":"Recent work has attempted to enhance vector space representations using information from structured semantic resources. This process, dubbed retrofitting (Faruqui et al., 2015), has yielded improvements in word similarity performance. Research has largely focused on the retrofitting algorithm, or on the kind of structured semantic resources used, but little research has explored why some resources perform better than others. We conducted a fine-grained analysis of the original retrofitting process, and found that the utility of different lexical resources for retrofitting depends on two factors: the coverage of the resource and the evaluation metric. Our assessment suggests that the common practice of using correlation measures to evaluate increases in performance against full word similarity benchmarks 1) obscures the benefits offered by smaller resources, and 2) overlooks incremental gains in word similarity performance. We propose root-mean-square error (RMSE) as an alternative evaluation metric, and demonstrate that correlation measures and RMSE sometimes yield opposite conclusions concerning the efficacy of retrofitting. This point is illustrated by word vectors retrofitted with novel treatments of the FrameNet data (Fillmore and Baker, 2010).","pages":"1062--1072","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/N19-1111","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/N19-1111","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","year":"2019","month":"June","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North {A}merican Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers)"},{"id":"N19-1112","title":"Linguistic Knowledge and Transferability of Contextual Representations","authors":["Liu, Nelson F.","Gardner, Matt","Belinkov, Yonatan","Peters, Matthew E.","Smith, Noah A."],"emails":["nfliu@cs.washington.edu","mattg@allenai.org","belinkov@seas.harvard.edu","matthewp@allenai.org","nasmith@cs.washington.edu"],"author_id":["nelson-f-liu","matt-gardner","yonatan-belinkov","matthew-e-peters","noah-a-smith"],"abstract":"Contextual word representations derived from large-scale neural language models are successful across a diverse set of NLP tasks, suggesting that they encode useful and transferable features of language.

We find that linear models trained on top of frozen contextual representations are competitive with state-of-the-art task-specific models in many cases, but fail on tasks requiring fine-grained linguistic knowledge (e.g., conjunct identification). To investigate the transferability of contextual word representations, we quantify differences in the transferability of individual layers within contextualizers, especially between recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformers. For instance, higher layers of RNNs are more task-specific, while transformer layers do not exhibit the same monotonic trend. In addition, to better understand what makes contextual word representations transferable, we compare language model pretraining with eleven supervised pretraining tasks. For any given task, pretraining on a closely related task yields better performance than language model pretraining (which is better on average) when the pretraining dataset is fixed.

In this paper we show that existing models have surpassed the performance ceiling of the standard evaluation dataset for the purpose, i.e., Stanford Contextual Word Similarity, and highlight its shortcomings. To address the lack of a suitable benchmark, we put forward a large-scale Word in Context dataset, called WiC, based on annotations curated by experts, for generic evaluation of context-sensitive representations.

However, the shielding methods still fall behind performances achieved in non-attack scenarios, which demonstrates the difficulty of dealing with visual attacks.","pages":"1634--1647","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/N19-1165","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/N19-1165","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","year":"2019","month":"June","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North {A}merican Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers)"},{"id":"N19-1166","title":"Something{'}s Brewing!

Thus, the practical advantage of global normalization in the context of modern neural methods remains unclear. In this paper, we attempt to shed light on this problem through an empirical study. We extend an approach for search-aware training via a continuous relaxation of beam search (Goyal et al., 2017b) in order to enable training of globally normalized recurrent sequence models through simple backpropagation. We then use this technique to conduct an empirical study of the interaction between global normalization, high-capacity encoders, and search-aware optimization. We observe that in the context of inexact search, globally normalized neural models are still more effective than their locally normalized counterparts. Further, since our training approach is sensitive to warm-starting with pre-trained models, we also propose a novel initialization strategy based on self-normalization for pre-training globally normalized models.

In this paper, we propose a neural ensemble model that adopts the strengths of these two LSTM variants to learn better long-term dependencies, where each module coupled with an attention mechanism that amplifies the contribution of important elements in the final representation.

In this work, we propose a new robust framework for learning unsupervised multilingual word embeddings that mitigates the instability issues. We learn a shared multilingual embedding space for a variable number of languages by incrementally adding new languages one by one to the current multilingual space. Through the gradual language addition the method can leverage the interdependencies between the new language and all other languages in the current multilingual space. We find that it is beneficial to project more distant languages later in the iterative process. Our fully unsupervised multilingual embedding spaces yield results that are on par with the state-of-the-art methods in the bilingual lexicon induction (BLI) task, and simultaneously obtain state-of-the-art scores on two downstream tasks: multilingual document classification and multilingual dependency parsing, outperforming even supervised baselines.

However, attempts to combine non-parametric or retrieval based approaches with NMT have only been successful on narrow domains, possibly due to over-reliance on sentence level retrieval.

In contrast to the typical approach of attributing the best single frame to each word, we provide a list of frames with disagreement-based scores that express the confidence with which each frame applies to the word. This is based on the idea that inter-annotator disagreement is at least partly caused by ambiguity that is inherent to the text and frames. We have found many examples where the semantics of individual frames overlap sufficiently to make them acceptable alternatives for interpreting a sentence. We have argued that ignoring this ambiguity creates an overly arbitrary target for training and evaluating natural language processing systems - if humans cannot agree, why would we expect the correct answer from a machine to be any different? To process this data we also utilized an expanded lemma-set provided by the Framester system, which merges FN with WordNet to enhance coverage. Our dataset includes annotations of 1,000 sentence-word pairs whose lemmas are not part of FN.

We call this problem Review Reading Comprehension (RRC). To the best of our knowledge, no existing work has been done on RRC. In this work, we first build an RRC dataset called ReviewRC based on a popular benchmark for aspect-based sentiment analysis. Since ReviewRC has limited training examples for RRC (and also for aspect-based sentiment analysis), we then explore a novel post-training approach on the popular language model BERT to enhance the performance of fine-tuning of BERT for RRC.

Then the generator learns to create better features away from the category boundaries by minimizing this discrepancy. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art performance and produce more discriminative features.","pages":"2496--2508","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/N19-1258","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/N19-1258","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","year":"2019","month":"June","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North {A}merican Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers)"},{"id":"N19-1259","title":"Target-oriented Opinion Words Extraction with Target-fused Neural Sequence Labeling","authors":["Fan, Zhifang","Wu, Zhen","Dai, Xin-Yu","Huang, Shujian","Chen, Jiajun"],"emails":["fanzf@nlp.nju.edu.cn","wuz@nlp.nju.edu.cn","daixinyu@nju.edu.cn","huangsj@nju.edu.cn","chenjj@nju.edu.cn"],"author_id":["zhifang-fan","zhen-wu","xinyu-dai","shujian-huang","jiajun-chen"],"abstract":"Opinion target extraction and opinion words extraction are two fundamental subtasks in Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA).

In this paper, we propose a novel sequence labeling subtask for ABSA named TOWE (Target-oriented Opinion Words Extraction), which aims at extracting the corresponding opinion words for a given opinion target. A target-fused sequence labeling neural network model is designed to perform this task. The opinion target information is well encoded into context by an Inward-Outward LSTM.

Learning representations for these spoken utterances is a complex research problem due to the presence of multiple heterogeneous sources of information. Recent advances in multimodal learning have followed the general trend of building more complex models that utilize various attention, memory and recurrent components. In this paper, we propose two simple but strong baselines to learn embeddings of multimodal utterances. The first baseline assumes a conditional factorization of the utterance into unimodal factors. Each unimodal factor is modeled using the simple form of a likelihood function obtained via a linear transformation of the embedding. We show that the optimal embedding can be derived in closed form by taking a weighted average of the unimodal features. In order to capture richer representations, our second baseline extends the first by factorizing into unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal factors, while retaining simplicity and efficiency during learning and inference. From a set of experiments across two tasks, we show strong performance on both supervised and semi-supervised multimodal prediction, as well as significant (10 times) speedups over neural models during inference. Overall, we believe that our strong baseline models offer new benchmarking options for future research in multimodal learning.","pages":"2599--2609","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/N19-1267","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/N19-1267","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","year":"2019","month":"June","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North {A}merican Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers)"},{"id":"N19-1268","title":"Learning to Navigate Unseen Environments: Back Translation with Environmental Dropout","authors":["Tan, Hao","Yu, Licheng","Bansal, Mohit"],"emails":["haotan@cs.unc.edu","licheng@cs.unc.edu","mbansal@cs.unc.edu"],"author_id":["hao-tan","licheng-yu","mohit-bansal"],"abstract":"A grand goal in AI is to build a robot that can accurately navigate based on natural language instructions, which requires the agent to perceive the scene, understand and ground language, and act in the real-world environment.

For evaluation, the proposed method is applied to both synthetic and real data, including two labelling tasks: text classification and textual entailment. Experimental results demonstrate our novel method can not only accurately estimate the reliability of annotators across different instances, but also achieve superior performance in predicting the correct labels and detecting the least reliable annotators compared to state-of-the-art baselines.","pages":"2873--2883","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/N19-1295","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/N19-1295","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","year":"2019","month":"June","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North {A}merican Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers)"},{"id":"N19-1296","title":"Review-Driven Multi-Label Music Style Classification by Exploiting Style Correlations","authors":["Zhao, Guangxiang","Xu, Jingjing","Zeng, Qi","Ren, Xuancheng","Sun, Xu"],"emails":["zhaoguangxiang@pku.edu.cn","jingjingxu@pku.edu.cn","pkuzengqi@pku.edu.cn","renxc@pku.edu.cn","xusun@pku.edu.cn"],"author_id":["guangxiang-zhao","jingjing-xu","qi-zeng","xuancheng-ren","xu-sun"],"abstract":"This paper explores a new natural languageprocessing task, review-driven multi-label musicstyle classification.

Nevertheless, most KBs still suffer from serious incompletion. Researchers proposed many tasks such as knowledge base completion and relation prediction to help build the representation of KBs. However, there are some issues unsettled towards enriching the KBs. Knowledge base completion and relation prediction assume that we know two elements of the fact triples and we are going to predict the missing one. This assumption is too restricted in practice and prevents it from discovering new facts directly. To address this issue, we propose a new task, namely, fact discovery from knowledge base. This task only requires that we know the head entity and the goal is to discover facts associated with the head entity. To tackle this new problem, we propose a novel framework that decomposes the discovery problem into several facet discovery components. We also propose a novel auto-encoder based facet component to estimate some facets of the fact. Besides, we propose a feedback learning component to share the information between each facet. We evaluate our framework using a benchmark dataset and the experimental results show that our framework achieves promising results.

In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism to enable conventional KV-MemNNs models to perform interpretable reasoning for complex questions. To achieve this, we design a new query updating strategy to mask previously-addressed memory information from the query representations, and introduce a novel STOP strategy to avoid invalid or repeated memory reading without strong annotation signals.

Existing approaches need considerable annotation efforts for each language, domain, and author, and often require handcrafted lexicons and features. Additionally, these approaches do not provide a quantifiable measure of how gendered the text is, nor are they applicable at the fine-grained mention level. In this paper, we use existing NLP pipelines to automatically annotate gender of mentions in the text.

This fact has largely been ignored in the evaluations of the growing body of related literature. Using the example of untargeted attacks on machine translation (MT), we propose a new evaluation framework for adversarial attacks on seq2seq models that takes the semantic equivalence of the pre- and post-perturbation input into account. Using this framework, we demonstrate that existing methods may not preserve meaning in general, breaking the aforementioned assumption that source side perturbations should not result in changes in the expected output. We further use this framework to demonstrate that adding additional constraints on attacks allows for adversarial perturbations that are more meaning-preserving, but nonetheless largely change the output sequence. Finally, we show that performing untargeted adversarial training with meaning-preserving attacks is beneficial to the model in terms of adversarial robustness, without hurting test performance.

We evaluate our approach on semantic textual similarity tasks and show that our proposed sentence encoder can continually learn features from new corpora while retaining its competence on previously encountered corpora.","pages":"3274--3279","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/N19-1331","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/N19-1331","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","year":"2019","month":"June","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North {A}merican Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers)"},{"id":"N19-1332","title":"Relation Discovery with Out-of-Relation Knowledge Base as Supervision","authors":["Liang, Yan","Liu, Xin","Zhang, Jianwen","Song, Yangqiu"],"emails":["yliangav@cse.ust.hk","xliucr@cse.ust.hk","jiazhan@microsoft.com","yqsong@cse.ust.hk"],"author_id":["yan-liang","xin-liu","jianwen-zhang","yangqiu-song"],"abstract":"Unsupervised relation discovery aims to discover new relations from a given text corpus without annotated data.

Under deep neural networks, a pre-defined vocabulary is required to vectorize text inputs. The canonical approach to select pre-defined vocabulary is based on the word frequency, where a threshold is selected to cut off the long tail distribution. However, we observed that such a simple approach could easily lead to under-sized vocabulary or over-sized vocabulary issues. Therefore, we are interested in understanding how the end-task classification accuracy is related to the vocabulary size and what is the minimum required vocabulary size to achieve a specific performance. In this paper, we provide a more sophisticated variational vocabulary dropout (VVD) based on variational dropout to perform vocabulary selection, which can intelligently select the subset of the vocabulary to achieve the required performance. To evaluate different algorithms on the newly proposed vocabulary selection problem, we propose two new metrics: Area Under Accuracy-Vocab Curve and Vocab Size under X{\\%} Accuracy Drop.

To address these issues, we present AutoSeM, a two-stage MTL pipeline, where the first stage automatically selects the most useful auxiliary tasks via a Beta-Bernoulli multi-armed bandit with Thompson Sampling, and the second stage learns the training mixing ratio of these selected auxiliary tasks via a Gaussian Process based Bayesian optimization framework.

These concept-based language model features improve classification performance in both English and French separately, and the best result (AUC = 0.89) is achieved using the multilingual training set with a combination of information and language model features.","pages":"3659--3670","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/N19-1367","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/N19-1367","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","year":"2019","month":"June","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North {A}merican Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers)"},{"id":"N19-1368","title":"Ranking and Selecting Multi-Hop Knowledge Paths to Better Predict Human Needs","authors":["Paul, Debjit","Frank, Anette"],"emails":["paul@cl.uni-heidelberg.de","frank@cl.uni-heidelberg.de"],"author_id":["debjit-paul","anette-frank"],"abstract":"To make machines better understand sentiments, research needs to move from polarity identification to understanding the reasons that underlie the expression of sentiment.

Such models have also been recently employed for the task of predicting dialog responses from available background documents (e.g., Holl-E dataset). However, here the documents are longer, thereby rendering these complex models infeasible except in select restricted settings. In order to overcome this, we use standard simple models which do not capture all pairwise interactions, but learn to emulate certain characteristics of a complex teacher network. Specifically, we first investigate the conicity of representations learned by a complex model and observe that it is significantly lower than that of simpler models. Based on this insight, we modify the simple architecture to mimic this characteristic. We go further by using knowledge distillation approaches, where the simple model acts as a student and learns to match the output from the complex teacher network.

Our algorithm is fully unsupervised and takes only source and target monolingual data as input.

Ideally, a model should not be able to perform well on a multi-hop question answering task without doing multi-hop reasoning.

First, we explore sentence-factored models for these tasks; by design, these models cannot do multi-hop reasoning, but they are still able to solve a large number of examples in both datasets. Furthermore, we find spurious correlations in the unmasked version of WikiHop, which make it easy to achieve high performance considering only the questions and answers.

Crucially, it only requires access to individuals{'} names at training time and not at deployment time. We evaluate two variations of our proposed method using a large-scale dataset of online biographies. We find that both variations simultaneously reduce race and gender biases, with almost no reduction in the classifier{'}s overall true positive rate.","pages":"4187--4195","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/N19-1424","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/N19-1424","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","year":"2019","month":"June","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North {A}merican Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers)"}]
