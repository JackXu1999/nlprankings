[{"id":"E17-3001","title":"{COVER}: Covering the Semantically Tractable Questions","authors":["Minock, Michael"],"emails":["minock@kth.se"],"author_id":["michael-minock"],"abstract":"In semantic parsing, natural language questions map to expressions in a meaning representation language (MRL) over some fixed vocabulary of predicates. To do this reliably, one must guarantee that for a wide class of natural language questions (the so called semantically tractable questions), correct interpretations are always in the mapped set of possibilities. In this demonstration, we introduce the system COVER which significantly clarifies, revises and extends the basic notion of semantic tractability. COVER achieves coverage of 89{\\%} while the earlier PRECISE system achieved coverage of 77{\\%} on the well known GeoQuery corpus. Like PRECISE, COVER requires only a simple domain lexicon and integrates off-the-shelf syntactic parsers. Beyond PRECISE, COVER also integrates off-the-shelf theorem provers to provide more accurate results. COVER is written in Python and uses the NLTK.","pages":"1--4","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/E17-3001","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Valencia, Spain","year":"2017","month":"April","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Software Demonstrations of the 15th Conference of the {E}uropean Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics"},{"id":"E17-3002","title":"Common Round: Application of Language Technologies to Large-Scale Web Debates","authors":["Uszkoreit, Hans","Gabryszak, Aleksandra","Hennig, Leonhard","Steffen, J{\\\"o}rg","Ai, Renlong","Busemann, Stephan","Dehdari, Jon","van Genabith, Josef","Heigold, Georg","Rethmeier, Nils","Rubino, Raphael","Schmeier, Sven","Thomas, Philippe","Wang, He","Xu, Feiyu"],"emails":["hans.uszkoreit@dfki.de","aleksandra.gabryszak@dfki.de","leonhard.hennig@dfki.de","j{\\\"o}rg.steffen@dfki.de","renlong.ai@dfki.de","stephan.busemann@dfki.de","jon.dehdari@dfki.de","josef.van genabith@dfki.de","georg.heigold@dfki.de","nils.rethmeier@dfki.de","raphael.rubino@dfki.de","sven.schmeier@dfki.de","philippe.thomas@dfki.de","","feiyu.xu@dfki.de"],"author_id":["hans-uszkoreit","aleksandra-gabryszak","leonhard-hennig","jorg-steffen","renlong-ai","stephan-busemann","jon-dehdari","josef-van-genabith","georg-heigold","nils-rethmeier","raphael-rubino","sven-schmeier","philippe-thomas","he-wang","feiyu-xu"],"abstract":"Web debates play an important role in enabling broad participation of constituencies in social, political and economic decision-taking.

WebVectors can be useful in a very common situation when one has trained a distributional semantics model for one{'}s particular corpus or language (tools for this are now widespread and simple to use), but then there is a need to demonstrate the results to general public over the Web. We show its abilities on the example of the living web services featuring distributional models for English, Norwegian and Russian.","pages":"99--103","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/E17-3025","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Valencia, Spain","year":"2017","month":"April","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Software Demonstrations of the 15th Conference of the {E}uropean Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics"},{"id":"E17-3026","title":"{I}n{T}o{E}vent{S}: An Interactive Toolkit for Discovering and Building Event Schemas","authors":["Ferrero, Germ{\\'a}n","Primadhanty, Audi","Quattoni, Ariadna"],"emails":["ferrero.gf@gmail.com","primadhanty@cs.upc.edu","ariadna.quattoni@xrce.xerox.com"],"author_id":["german-ferrero","audi-primadhanty","ariadna-quattoni"],"abstract":"Event Schema Induction is the task of learning a representation of events (e.g., bombing) and the roles involved in them (e.g, victim and perpetrator). This paper presents InToEventS, an interactive tool for learning these schemas. InToEventS allows users to explore a corpus and discover which kind of events are present. We show how users can create useful event schemas using two interactive clustering steps.","pages":"104--107","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/E17-3026","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Valencia, Spain","year":"2017","month":"April","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Software Demonstrations of the 15th Conference of the {E}uropean Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics"},{"id":"E17-3027","title":"{ICE}: Idiom and Collocation Extractor for Research and Education","authors":["Vuppuluri, Vasanthi","Baki, Shahryar","Nguyen, An","Verma, Rakesh"],"emails":["vuppulurivasanthi@gmail.com","shahryar@cs.uh.com","anqnguyen@outlook.com","rverma@uh.edu"],"author_id":["vasanthi-vuppuluri","shahryar-baki","an-nguyen","rakesh-verma"],"abstract":"Collocation and idiom extraction are well-known challenges with many potential applications in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Our experimental, open-source software system, called ICE, is a python package for flexibly extracting collocations and idioms, currently in English. It also has a competitive POS tagger that can be used alone or as part of collocation\/idiom extraction. ICE is available free of cost for research and educational uses in two user-friendly formats. This paper gives an overview of ICE and its performance, and briefly describes the research underlying the extraction algorithms.","pages":"108--111","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/E17-3027","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Valencia, Spain","year":"2017","month":"April","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Software Demonstrations of the 15th Conference of the {E}uropean Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics"},{"id":"E17-3028","title":"{B}ib2vec: Embedding-based Search System for Bibliographic Information","authors":["Yoneda, Takuma","Mori, Koki","Miwa, Makoto","Sasaki, Yutaka"],"emails":["sd14084@toyota-ti.ac.jp","sd15435@toyota-ti.ac.jp","makoto-miwa@toyota-ti.ac.jp","yutaka.sasaki@toyota-ti.ac.jp"],"author_id":["takuma-yoneda","koki-mori","makoto-miwa","yutaka-sasaki"],"abstract":"We propose a novel embedding model that represents relationships among several elements in bibliographic information with high representation ability and flexibility.
