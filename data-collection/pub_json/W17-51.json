We describe the human processing of this data by the government officials, and the manual tagging of arguments performed by members of our research group. Afterwards we focus on classification tasks that mimic the human processes, comparing linear methods with neural network architectures. The experiments show that some of the manual tasks are suitable for automatization. In particular, the best methods achieve a 90{\\%} top-5 accuracy in a multi-class classification of arguments, and 65{\\%} macro-averaged F1-score for tagging arguments according to a three-part argumentation model.","pages":"1--10","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W17-5101","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W17-5101","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Copenhagen, Denmark","year":"2017","month":"September","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 4th Workshop on Argument Mining"},{"id":"W17-5102","title":"Analyzing the Semantic Types of Claims and Premises in an Online Persuasive Forum","authors":["Hidey, Christopher","Musi, Elena","Hwang, Alyssa","Muresan, Smaranda","McKeown, Kathy"],"emails":["chidey@cs.columbia.edu","em3202@columbia.edu","a.hwang@columbia.edu","smara@columbia.edu","kathy@cs.columbia.edu"],"author_id":["christopher-hidey","elena-musi","alyssa-hwang","smaranda-muresan","kathleen-mckeown"],"abstract":"Argumentative text has been analyzed both theoretically and computationally in terms of argumentative structure that consists of argument components (e.g., claims, premises) and their argumentative relations (e.g., support, attack). Less emphasis has been placed on analyzing the semantic types of argument components. We propose a two-tiered annotation scheme to label claims and premises and their semantic types in an online persuasive forum, Change My View, with the long-term goal of understanding what makes a message persuasive. Premises are annotated with the three types of persuasive modes: ethos, logos, pathos, while claims are labeled as interpretation, evaluation, agreement, or disagreement, the latter two designed to account for the dialogical nature of our corpus. We aim to answer three questions: 1) can humans reliably annotate the semantic types of argument components? 2) are types of premises\/claims positioned in recurrent orders? and 3) are certain types of claims and\/or premises more likely to appear in persuasive messages than in non-persuasive messages?","pages":"11--21","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W17-5102","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W17-5102","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Copenhagen, Denmark","year":"2017","month":"September","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 4th Workshop on Argument Mining"},{"id":"W17-5103","title":"Annotation of argument structure in {J}apanese legal documents","authors":["Yamada, Hiroaki","Teufel, Simone","Tokunaga, Takenobu"],"emails":["yamada.h.ax@m.titech.ac.jp","simone.teufel@cl.cam.ac.uk","take@c.titech.ac.jp"],"author_id":["hiroaki-yamada","simone-teufel","takenobu-tokunaga"],"abstract":"We propose a method for the annotation of Japanese civil judgment documents, with the purpose of creating flexible summaries of these.

The approach presented is based on the way in which we understand an argument being made, not just from the words said, but from existing contextual knowledge and understanding of the broader issues. We leverage high-precision, low-recall techniques in order to automatically build a large corpus of inferential statements related to the text{'}s topic. These statements are then used to produce a matrix representing the inferential relationship between different aspects of the topic. From this matrix, we are able to determine connectedness and directionality of inference between statements in the original text.

The framework allows for the composition of approaches to acquiring, mining, assessing, indexing, querying, retrieving, ranking, and presenting arguments while relying on standard infrastructure and interfaces. Based on the framework, we build a prototype search engine, called args, that relies on an initial, freely accessible index of nearly 300k arguments crawled from reliable web resources.
