Abbreviation Explorer helps to identify long-forms that are easily confused, and to pinpoint likely causes such as limitations of normalization, language switching, or inconsistent typing. It can also support determining which long-forms would benefit from additional input text for unsupervised abbreviation disambiguation. The system provides options for creating corrective rules that merge redundant long-forms with identical meaning. The identified rules can be easily applied to the already existing vector spaces used by UAD to improve disambiguation performance, while also avoiding the cost of retraining.","pages":"1--5","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/N19-4001","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/N19-4001","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","year":"2019","month":"June","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North {A}merican Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Demonstrations)"},{"id":"N19-4002","title":"{ADIDA}: Automatic Dialect Identification for {A}rabic","authors":["Obeid, Ossama","Salameh, Mohammad","Bouamor, Houda","Habash, Nizar"],"emails":["oobeid@nyu.edu","msalameh@cmu.edu","hbouamor@cmu.edu","nizar.habash@nyu.edu"],"author_id":["ossama-obeid","mohammad-salameh","houda-bouamor","nizar-habash"],"abstract":"This demo paper describes ADIDA, a web-based system for automatic dialect identification for Arabic text.

INDRA aggregates multiple sources of causal information and performs assembly to create a coherent knowledge base and assess its reliability.

In order to extract and aggregate this information, we deployed various information extraction and machine learning techniques. The aggregated data can be queried in real time within the Westlaw Edge search engine. In addition to a keyword search for judges, lawyers, law firms, parties and courts, we also implemented a question answering interface that offers targeted questions in order to get to the respective answers quicker.","pages":"116--121","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/N19-4020","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/N19-4020","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","year":"2019","month":"June","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North {A}merican Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Demonstrations)"},{"id":"N19-4021","title":"Community lexical access for an endangered polysynthetic language: An electronic dictionary for St. Lawrence Island Yupik","authors":["Hunt, Benjamin","Chen, Emily","Schreiner, Sylvia L.R.","Schwartz, Lane"],"emails":["bhunt6@gmu.edu","echen41@illinois.edu","sschrei2@gmu.edu","lanes@illinois.edu"],"author_id":["benjamin-hunt","emily-chen","sylvia-l-r-schreiner","lane-schwartz"],"abstract":"In this paper, we introduce a morphologically-aware electronic dictionary for St. Lawrence Island Yupik, an endangered language of the Bering Strait region. Implemented using HTML, Javascript, and CSS, the dictionary is set in an uncluttered interface and permits users to search in Yupik or in English for Yupik root words and Yupik derivational suffixes. For each matching result, our electronic dictionary presents the user with the corresponding entry from the Badten (2008) Yupik-English paper dictionary. Because Yupik is a polysynthetic language, handling of multimorphemic word forms is critical. If a user searches for an inflected Yupik word form, we perform a morphological analysis and return entries for the root word and for any derivational suffixes present in the word. This electronic dictionary should serve not only as a valuable resource for all students and speakers of Yupik, but also for field linguists working towards documentation and conservation of the language.","pages":"122--126","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/N19-4021","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/N19-4021","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","year":"2019","month":"June","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North {A}merican Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Demonstrations)"},{"id":"N19-4022","title":"Visualizing Inferred Morphotactic Systems","authors":["Lepp, Haley","Zamaraeva, Olga","Bender, Emily M."],"emails":["hlepp@uw.edu","olzama@uw.edu","ebender@uw.edu"],"author_id":["haley-lepp","olga-zamaraeva","emily-m-bender"],"abstract":"We present a web-based system that facilitates the exploration of complex morphological patterns found in morphologically very rich languages.

This flexible language and robotic platform takes advantage of existing tools for speech recognition and dialogue management that are compatible with new domains, and implements an inter-agent communication protocol (tactical behavior specification), where verbal instructions are encoded for tasks assigned to the appropriate robot.","pages":"132--137","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/N19-4023","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/N19-4023","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","year":"2019","month":"June","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North {A}merican Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Demonstrations)"},{"id":"N19-4024","title":"Chat-crowd: A Dialog-based Platform for Visual Layout Composition","authors":["Cascante-Bonilla, Paola","Yin, Xuwang","Ordonez, Vicente","Feng, Song"],"emails":["pc9za@virginia.edu","xy4cm@virginia.edu","vicente@virginia.edu","sfeng@us.ibm.com"],"author_id":["paola-cascante-bonilla","xuwang-yin","vicente-ordonez","song-feng"],"abstract":"In this paper we introduce Chat-crowd, an interactive environment for visual layout composition via conversational interactions. Chat-crowd supports multiple agents with two conversational roles: agents who play the role of a designer are in charge of placing objects in an editable canvas according to instructions or commands issued by agents with a director role. The system can be integrated with crowdsourcing platforms for both synchronous and asynchronous data collection and is equipped with comprehensive quality controls on the performance of both types of agents. We expect that this system will be useful to build multimodal goal-oriented dialog tasks that require spatial and geometric reasoning.","pages":"138--142","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/N19-4024","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/N19-4024","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","year":"2019","month":"June","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North {A}merican Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Demonstrations)"}]
