In this paper we compare the performance of an automated speech scoring engine using two corpora: a corpus of almost 700,000 randomly sampled spoken responses with scores assigned by one or two raters during operational scoring, and a corpus of 16,500 exemplar responses with scores reviewed by multiple expert raters. We show that the choice of corpus used for model evaluation has a major effect on estimates of system performance with r varying between 0.64 and 0.80. Surprisingly, this is not the case for the choice of corpus for model training: when the training corpus is sufficiently large, the systems trained on different corpora showed almost identical performance when evaluated on the same corpus. We show that this effect is consistent across several learning algorithms. We conclude that evaluating the model on a corpus of exemplar responses if one is available provides additional evidence about system validity; at the same time, investing effort into creating a corpus of exemplar responses for model training is unlikely to lead to a substantial gain in model performance.","pages":"1--12","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W18-0501","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W18-0501","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"New Orleans, Louisiana","year":"2018","month":"June","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Thirteenth Workshop on Innovative Use of {NLP} for Building Educational Applications"},{"id":"W18-0502","title":"Using Paraphrasing and Memory-Augmented Models to Combat Data Sparsity in Question Interpretation with a Virtual Patient Dialogue System","authors":["Jin, Lifeng","King, David","Hussein, Amad","White, Michael","Danforth, Douglas"],"emails":["jin@ling.osu.edu","king@ling.osu.edu","amadh881@gmail.com","mwhite@ling.osu.edu","doug.danforth@osumc.edu"],"author_id":["lifeng-jin","david-king","amad-hussein","michael-white","douglas-danforth"],"abstract":"When interpreting questions in a virtual patient dialogue system one must inevitably tackle the challenge of a long tail of relatively infrequently asked questions.

In this paper we propose a fully automatic method for generating distractor suggestions for multiple-choice questions used in high-stakes medical exams. The system uses a question stem and the correct answer as an input and produces a list of suggested distractors ranked based on their similarity to the stem and the correct answer. To do this we use a novel approach of combining concept embeddings with information retrieval methods. We frame the evaluation as a prediction task where we aim to {``}predict{''} the human-produced distractors used in large sets of medical questions, i.e. if a distractor generated by our system is good enough it is likely to feature among the list of distractors produced by the human item-writers. The results reveal that combining concept embeddings with information retrieval approaches significantly improves the generation of plausible distractors and enables us to match around 1 in 5 of the human-produced distractors. The approach proposed in this paper is generalisable to all scenarios where the distractors refer to concepts.","pages":"389--398","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W18-0548","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W18-0548","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"New Orleans, Louisiana","year":"2018","month":"June","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Thirteenth Workshop on Innovative Use of {NLP} for Building Educational Applications"},{"id":"W18-0549","title":"Co-Attention Based Neural Network for Source-Dependent Essay Scoring","authors":["Zhang, Haoran","Litman, Diane"],"emails":["colinzhang@cs.pitt.edu","litman@cs.pitt.edu"],"author_id":["haoran-zhang","diane-litman"],"abstract":"This paper presents an investigation of using a co-attention based neural network for source-dependent essay scoring.
