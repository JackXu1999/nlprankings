In the present article, we investigate whether LSA and word2vec capacity to identify relevant semantic relations increases with corpus size. One intuitive hypothesis is that the capacity to identify relevant associations should increase as the amount of data increases. However, if corpus size grows in topics which are not specific to the domain of interest, signal to noise ratio may weaken. Here we investigate the effect of corpus specificity and size in word-embeddings, and for this, we study two ways for progressive elimination of documents: the elimination of random documents vs. the elimination of documents unrelated to a specific task. We show that word2vec can take advantage of all the documents, obtaining its best performance when it is trained with the whole corpus. On the contrary, the specialization (removal of out-of-domain documents) of the training corpus, accompanied by a decrease of dimensionality, can increase LSA word-representation quality while speeding up the processing time. From a cognitive-modeling point of view, we point out that LSA{'}s word-knowledge acquisitions may not be efficiently exploiting higher-order co-occurrences and global relations, whereas word2vec does.","pages":"1--10","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W18-3001","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W18-3001","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Melbourne, Australia","year":"2018","month":"July","booktitle":"Proceedings of The Third Workshop on Representation Learning for {NLP}"},{"id":"W18-3002","title":"Hierarchical Convolutional Attention Networks for Text Classification","authors":["Gao, Shang","Ramanathan, Arvind","Tourassi, Georgia"],"emails":["gaos@ornl.gov","ramanathana@ornl.gov","tourassig@ornl.gov"],"author_id":["shang-gao","arvind-ramanathan","georgia-tourassi"],"abstract":"Recent work in machine translation has demonstrated that self-attention mechanisms can be used in place of recurrent neural networks to increase training speed without sacrificing model accuracy.

In order to address this issue and to realize such smart hybrid dialogue systems, we develop a model to discriminate user utterance between task-oriented and chit-chat conversations. We introduce a hybrid of convolutional neural network (CNN) and a lateral multiple timescale gated recurrent units (LMTGRU) that can represent multiple temporal scale dependencies for the discrimination task.

The word contributes to the overall polarity of a combination of words depending upon which other words it is combined with. This is analogous to the behavior of microscopic particles which exist in all possible states at the same time and interfere with each other to give rise to new states depending upon their relative phases.

Our results are based on a set of 6 European languages.","pages":"175--179","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W18-3023","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W18-3023","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Melbourne, Australia","year":"2018","month":"July","booktitle":"Proceedings of The Third Workshop on Representation Learning for {NLP}"},{"id":"W18-3024","title":"{LSTM}s Exploit Linguistic Attributes of Data","authors":["Liu, Nelson F.","Levy, Omer","Schwartz, Roy","Tan, Chenhao","Smith, Noah A."],"emails":["nfliu@cs.washington.edu","omerlevy@cs.washington.edu","roysch@cs.washington.edu","chenhao.tan@colorado.edu","nasmith@cs.washington.edu"],"author_id":["nelson-f-liu","omer-levy","roy-schwartz","chenhao-tan","noah-a-smith"],"abstract":"While recurrent neural networks have found success in a variety of natural language processing applications, they are general models of sequential data. We investigate how the properties of natural language data affect an LSTM{'}s ability to learn a nonlinguistic task: recalling elements from its input. We find that models trained on natural language data are able to recall tokens from much longer sequences than models trained on non-language sequential data. Furthermore, we show that the LSTM learns to solve the memorization task by explicitly using a subset of its neurons to count timesteps in the input. We hypothesize that the patterns and structure in natural language data enable LSTMs to learn by providing approximate ways of reducing loss, but understanding the effect of different training data on the learnability of LSTMs remains an open question.","pages":"180--186","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W18-3024","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W18-3024","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Melbourne, Australia","year":"2018","month":"July","booktitle":"Proceedings of The Third Workshop on Representation Learning for {NLP}"},{"id":"W18-3025","title":"Learning Distributional Token Representations from Visual Features","authors":["Broscheit, Samuel"],"emails":["lastname@informatik.uni-mannheim.de"],"author_id":["samuel-broscheit"],"abstract":"In this study, we compare token representations constructed from visual features (i.e., pixels) with standard lookup-based embeddings. Our goal is to gain insight about the challenges of encoding a text representation from low-level features, e.g. from characters or pixels. We focus on Chinese, which{---}as a logographic language{---}has properties that make a representation via visual features challenging and interesting. To train and evaluate different models for the token representation, we chose the task of character-based neural machine translation (NMT) from Chinese to English. We found that a token representation computed only from visual features can achieve competitive results to lookup embeddings. However, we also show different strengths and weaknesses in the models{'} performance in a part-of-speech tagging task and also a semantic similarity task. In summary, we show that it is possible to achieve a \\textit{text representation} only from pixels. We hope that this is a useful stepping stone for future studies that exclusively rely on visual input, or aim at exploiting visual features of written language.","pages":"187--194","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W18-3025","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W18-3025","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Melbourne, Australia","year":"2018","month":"July","booktitle":"Proceedings of The Third Workshop on Representation Learning for {NLP}"},{"id":"W18-3026","title":"Jointly Embedding Entities and Text with Distant Supervision","authors":["Newman-Griffis, Denis","Lai, Albert M","Fosler-Lussier, Eric"],"emails":["newman-griffis.1@osu.edu","amlai@wustl.edu","fosler-lussier.1@osu.edu"],"author_id":["denis-newman-griffis","albert-m-lai","eric-fosler-lussier"],"abstract":"Learning representations for knowledge base entities and concepts is becoming increasingly important for NLP applications. However, recent entity embedding methods have relied on structured resources that are expensive to create for new domains and corpora. We present a distantly-supervised method for jointly learning embeddings of entities and text from an unnanotated corpus, using only a list of mappings between entities and surface forms. We learn embeddings from open-domain and biomedical corpora, and compare against prior methods that rely on human-annotated text or large knowledge graph structure. Our embeddings capture entity similarity and relatedness better than prior work, both in existing biomedical datasets and a new Wikipedia-based dataset that we release to the community. Results on analogy completion and entity sense disambiguation indicate that entities and words capture complementary information that can be effectively combined for downstream use.","pages":"195--206","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W18-3026","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W18-3026","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Melbourne, Australia","year":"2018","month":"July","booktitle":"Proceedings of The Third Workshop on Representation Learning for {NLP}"},{"id":"W18-3027","title":"A Sequence-to-Sequence Model for Semantic Role Labeling","authors":["Daza, Angel","Frank, Anette"],"emails":["daza@cl.uni-heidelberg.de","frank@cl.uni-heidelberg.de"],"author_id":["angel-daza","anette-frank"],"abstract":"We explore a novel approach for Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) by casting it as a sequence-to-sequence process. We employ an attention-based model enriched with a copying mechanism to ensure faithful regeneration of the input sequence, while enabling interleaved generation of argument role labels. We apply this model in a monolingual setting, performing PropBank SRL on English language data. The constrained sequence generation set-up enforced with the copying mechanism allows us to analyze the performance and special properties of the model on manually labeled data and benchmarking against state-of-the-art sequence labeling models. We show that our model is able to solve the SRL argument labeling task on English data, yet further structural decoding constraints will need to be added to make the model truly competitive. Our work represents the first step towards more advanced, generative SRL labeling setups.","pages":"207--216","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W18-3027","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W18-3027","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Melbourne, Australia","year":"2018","month":"July","booktitle":"Proceedings of The Third Workshop on Representation Learning for {NLP}"},{"id":"W18-3028","title":"Predicting Concreteness and Imageability of Words Within and Across Languages via Word Embeddings","authors":["Ljube{\\v{s}}i{\\'c}, Nikola","Fi{\\v{s}}er, Darja","Peti-Stanti{\\'c}, Anita"],"emails":["nikola.ljubesic@ijs.si","darja.fiser@ff.uni-lj.si","anita.peti-stantic@ffzg.hr"],"author_id":["nikola-ljubesic","darja-fiser","anita-peti-stantic"],"abstract":"The notions of concreteness and imageability, traditionally important in psycholinguistics, are gaining significance in semantic-oriented natural language processing tasks.
