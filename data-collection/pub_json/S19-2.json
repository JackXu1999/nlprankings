The key idea is to convert a UCCA semantic graph into a constituent tree, in which extra labels are deliberately designed to mark remote edges and discontinuous nodes for future recovery. In this way, we can make use of existing syntactic parsing techniques. Based on the data statistics, we recover discontinuous nodes directly according to the output labels of the constituent parser and use a biaffine classification model to recover the more complex remote edges. The classification model and the constituent parser are simultaneously trained under the multi-task learning framework. We use the multilingual BERT as extra features in the open tracks.

However, the context of dialogue can prove helpful in detection of the emotion. In this task, given a textual dialogue i.e. an utterance along with two previous turns of context, the goal was to infer the underlying emotion of the utterance by choosing from four emotion classes - Happy, Sad, Angry and Others. To facilitate the participation in this task, textual dialogues from user interaction with a conversational agent were taken and annotated for emotion classes after several data processing steps. A training data set of 30160 dialogues, and two evaluation data sets, Test1 and Test2, containing 2755 and 5509 dialogues respectively were released to the participants. A total of 311 teams made submissions to this task. The final leader-board was evaluated on Test2 data set, and the highest ranked submission achieved 79.59 micro-averaged F1 score.

Consequently, such resources are unavailable for many languages and specific domains. This problem can be alleviated by using unsupervised approaches to induce the frames evoked by a collection of documents. That is the objective of the second task of SemEval 2019, which comprises three subtasks: clustering of verbs that evoke the same frame and clustering of arguments into both frame-specific slots and semantic roles. We approach all the subtasks by applying a graph clustering algorithm on contextualized embedding representations of the verbs and arguments. Using such representations is appropriate in the context of this task, since they provide cues for word-sense disambiguation. Thus, they can be used to identify different frames evoked by the same words. Using this approach we were able to outperform all of the baselines reported for the task on the test set in terms of Purity F1, as well as in terms of BCubed F1 in most cases.","pages":"130--136","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/S19-2019","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/S19-2019","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","year":"2019","month":"June","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation"},{"id":"S19-2020","title":"{B}rain{EE} at {S}em{E}val-2019 Task 3: Ensembling Linear Classifiers for Emotion Prediction","authors":["Gratian, Vachagan"],"emails":["vgratian@utopianlab.am"],"author_id":["vachagan-gratian"],"abstract":"The paper describes an ensemble of linear perceptrons trained for emotion classification as part of the SemEval-2019 shared-task 3.

Our approach consists of a change of the space of representation of text into statistical descriptors which characterize the text. In addition, dimensional reduction is performed to 6 characteristics per class in order to make the method suitable for a Big Data environment.

Mining sentiments of customer reviews is an example that has gained momentum due to its potential to gather information that customers are not happy about. Instead of reading millions of reviews, companies prefer sentiment analysis to obtain feedback and to improve their products or services. In this work, we aim to identify information that companies can act on, or other customers can utilize for making their own experience better. This is different from identifying if reviews of a product or service is negative, positive, or neutral. To that end, we classify sentences of a given review as suggestion or not suggestion so that readers of the reviews do not have to go through thousands of reviews but instead can focus on actionable items and applicable suggestions. To identify suggestions within reviews, we employ a hybrid approach that utilizes a recurrent neural network (RNN) along with rule-based features to build a domain-independent suggestion mining model.

Toponym resolution can be roughly divided into two independent steps, i.e., toponym detection and toponym disambiguation. In order to facilitate the study on toponym resolution, the SemEval 2019 task 12 is proposed, which contains three subtasks, i.e., toponym detection, toponym disambiguation and toponym resolution. In this paper, we introduce our system that participated in the SemEval 2019 task 12. For toponym detection, in our approach we use TagLM as the basic model, and explore the use of various features in this task, such as word embeddings extracted from pre-trained language models, POS tags and lexical features extracted from dictionaries. For toponym disambiguation, we propose a heuristics rule-based method using toponym frequency and population.
