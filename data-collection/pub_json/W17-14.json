[{"id":"W17-1401","title":"Toward Pan-{S}lavic {NLP}: Some Experiments with Language Adaptation","authors":["Sharoff, Serge"],"emails":["s.lastname@leeds.ac.uk"],"author_id":["serge-sharoff"],"abstract":"There is great variation in the amount of NLP resources available for Slavonic languages. For example, the Universal Dependency treebank (Nivre et al., 2016) has about 2 MW of training resources for Czech, more than 1 MW for Russian, while only 950 words for Ukrainian and nothing for Belorussian, Bosnian or Macedonian. Similarly, the Autodesk Machine Translation dataset only covers three Slavonic languages (Czech, Polish and Russian). In this talk I will discuss a general approach, which can be called Language Adaptation, similarly to Domain Adaptation. In this approach, a model for a particular language processing task is built by lexical transfer of cognate words and by learning a new feature representation for a lesser-resourced (recipient) language starting from a better-resourced (donor) language. More specifically, I will demonstrate how language adaptation works in such training scenarios as Translation Quality Estimation, Part-of-Speech tagging and Named Entity Recognition.","pages":"1--2","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W17-1401","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W17-1401","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Valencia, Spain","year":"2017","month":"April","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 6th Workshop on {B}alto-{S}lavic Natural Language Processing"},{"id":"W17-1402","title":"Clustering of {R}ussian Adjective-Noun Constructions using Word Embeddings","authors":["Kutuzov, Andrey","Kuzmenko, Elizaveta","Pivovarova, Lidia"],"emails":["eakuzmenko_2@edu.hse.ru","andreku@ifi.uio.no","pivovaro@cs.helsinki.fi"],"author_id":["andrey-kutuzov","elizaveta-kuzmenko","lidia-pivovarova"],"abstract":"This paper presents a method of automatic construction extraction from a large corpus of Russian.

We propose a method of grouping such constructions into semantic classes via 2-step clustering of word vectors in distributional models. We compare it with other clustering techniques and evaluate it against A Russian-English Collocational Dictionary of the Human Body that contains manually annotated groups of constructions with nouns meaning human body parts. The best performing method is used to cluster all adjective-noun bigrams in the Russian National Corpus.
