In order to simulate affordances, which we take to be direct perceptions of context-specific opportunities for action, we preform a distributional analysis dependency relationships between target words and their modifiers and adjuncts. We use these relationships as the basis for generating on-line transformations which project semantic subspaces in which the interpretations of coercive compositions are expected to emerge as salient word-vectors. We offer some preliminary examples of how this model operates on a dataset of sentences involving coercive interactions between verbs and objects specifically designed to evaluate this work.","pages":"1--7","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W19-0501","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Gothenburg, Sweden","year":"2019","month":"23{--}27 May","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Computational Semantics - Short Papers"},{"id":"W19-0502","title":"Natural Language Inference with Monotonicity","authors":["Hu, Hai","Chen, Qi","Moss, Larry"],"emails":["huhai@indiana.edu","qc5@indiana.edu","lsm@cs.indiana.edu"],"author_id":["hai-hu","qi-chen","larry-moss"],"abstract":"This paper describes a working system which performs natural language inference using polarity-marked parse trees.

As lexical representations, they have been said to be fundamentally different from truth-theoretic models of semantics, where meaning is defined as a correspondence relation to the world. There are two main aspects to this difference: a) DSMs are built over corpus data which may or may not reflect {`}what is in the world{'}; b) they are built from word co-occurrences, that is, from lexical types rather than entities and sets. In this paper, we inspect the properties of a distributional model built over a set-theoretic approximation of {`}the real world{'}. To achieve this, we take the annotation a large database of images marked with objects, attributes and relations, convert the data into a representation akin to first-order logic and build several distributional models using various combinations of features. We evaluate those models over both relatedness and similarity datasets, demonstrating their effectiveness in standard evaluations. This allows us to conclude that, despite prior claims, truth-theoretic models are good candidates for building graded lexical representations of meaning.","pages":"16--23","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W19-0503","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Gothenburg, Sweden","year":"2019","month":"23{--}27 May","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Computational Semantics - Short Papers"},{"id":"W19-0504","title":"Linguistic Information in Neural Semantic Parsing with Multiple Encoders","authors":["van Noord, Rik","Toral, Antonio","Bos, Johan"],"emails":["r.i.k.van.noord@rug.nl","a.toral.ruiz@rug.nl","johan.bos@rug.nl"],"author_id":["rik-van-noord","antonio-toral","johan-bos"],"abstract":"Recently, sequence-to-sequence models have achieved impressive performance on a number of semantic parsing tasks.

Research in neural machine translation has shown that employing this information has a lot of potential, especially when using a multi-encoder setup. We employ a range of semantic and syntactic resources to improve performance for the task of Discourse Representation Structure Parsing. We show that (i) linguistic features can be beneficial for neural semantic parsing and (ii) the best method of adding these features is by using multiple encoders.","pages":"24--31","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W19-0504","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Gothenburg, Sweden","year":"2019","month":"23{--}27 May","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Computational Semantics - Short Papers"},{"id":"W19-0505","title":"Making Sense of Conflicting (Defeasible) Rules in the Controlled Natural Language {ACE}: Design of a System with Support for Existential Quantification Using Skolemization","authors":["Diller, Martin","Wyner, Adam","Strass, Hannes"],"emails":["mdiller@kr.tuwien.ac.at","a.z.wyner@swansea.ac.uk","strass@informatik.uni-leipzig.de"],"author_id":["martin-diller","adam-wyner","hannes-strass"],"abstract":"We present the design of a system for making sense of conflicting rules expressed in a fragment of the prominent controlled natural language ACE, yet extended with means of expressing defeasible rules in the form of normality assumptions.

In this work we provide a more fine-grained description of the distributional nature in the corpus- based interaction of verbs and nouns within subcategorisation, by investigating the concreteness of verbs and nouns that are in a specific syntactic relationship with each other, i.e., subject, direct object, and prepositional object. Overall, our experiments show consistent patterns in the distributional representation of subcategorising and subcategorised concrete and abstract words. At the same time, the studies reveal empirical evidence why contextual abstractness represents a valuable indicator for automatic non-literal language identification.","pages":"38--43","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W19-0506","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Gothenburg, Sweden","year":"2019","month":"23{--}27 May","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Computational Semantics - Short Papers"},{"id":"W19-0507","title":"Generating a Novel Dataset of Multimodal Referring Expressions","authors":["Krishnaswamy, Nikhil","Pustejovsky, James"],"emails":["nkrishna@brandeis.edu","jamesp@brandeis.edu"],"author_id":["nikhil-krishnaswamy","james-pustejovsky"],"abstract":"Referring expressions and definite descriptions of objects in space exploit information both about object characteristics and locations. To resolve potential ambiguity, referencing strategies in language can rely on increasingly abstract concepts to distinguish an object in a given location from similar ones elsewhere, yet the description of the intended location may still be imprecise or difficult to interpret. Meanwhile, modalities such as gesture may communicate spatial information such as locations in a more concise manner. In real peer-to-peer communication, humans use language and gesture together to reference entities, with a capacity for mixing and changing modalities where needed. While recent progress in AI and human-computer interaction has created systems where a human can interact with a computer multimodally, computers often lack the capacity to intelligently mix modalities when generating referring expressions. We present a novel dataset of referring expressions combining natural language and gesture, describe its creation and evaluation, and its uses to train computational models for generating and interpreting multimodal referring expressions.","pages":"44--51","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W19-0507","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Gothenburg, Sweden","year":"2019","month":"23{--}27 May","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Computational Semantics - Short Papers"},{"id":"W19-0508","title":"On Learning Word Embeddings From Linguistically Augmented Text Corpora","authors":["Silva, Amila","Amarathunga, Chathurika"],"emails":["amilasilva@smu.edu.sg","chathurikaa@smu.edu.sg"],"author_id":["amila-silva","chathurika-amarathunga"],"abstract":"Word embedding is a technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to map words into vector space representations.

All words are not equally impacted by this internal instability and recent studies have investigated features influencing the stability of word embeddings. This stability can be seen as a clue for the reliability of the semantic representation of a word. In this work, we investigate the influence of the degree of concreteness of nouns on the stability of their semantic representation. We show that for English generic corpora, abstract words are more affected by stability problems than concrete words. We also found that to a certain extent, the difference between the degree of concreteness of a noun and its nearest neighbors can partly explain the stability or instability of its neighbors.","pages":"65--70","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W19-0510","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Gothenburg, Sweden","year":"2019","month":"23{--}27 May","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Computational Semantics - Short Papers"}]
