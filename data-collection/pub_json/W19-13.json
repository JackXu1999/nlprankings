It is often observed that people tend to take a stance; in favor, against or neutral towards a particular topic. The task of assessing the stance taken by the individual became significantly important with the emergence in the usage of online social platforms. Automatic stance detection system understands the user{'}s stance by analyzing the standalone texts against a target entity. Due to the limited contextual information a single sentence provides, it is challenging to solve this task effectively. In this paper, we introduce a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) based deep neural network architecture for automatically detecting stance present in the code-mixed corpus. We apply our approach on Hindi-English code-mixed corpus against the target entity - {``}Demonetisation.{''} Our best model achieved the result with a stance prediction accuracy of 63.2{\\%} which is a 4.5{\\%} overall accuracy improvement compared to the current supervised classification systems developed using the benchmark dataset for code-mixed data stance detection.","pages":"1--5","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W19-1301","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W19-1301","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Minneapolis, USA","year":"2019","month":"June","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Tenth Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment and Social Media Analysis"},{"id":"W19-1302","title":"A Soft Label Strategy for Target-Level Sentiment Classification","authors":["Yin, Da","Liu, Xiao","Wu, Xiuyu","Chang, Baobao"],"emails":["","","wu@pku.edu.cn","chbb@pku.edu.cn"],"author_id":["da-yin","xiao-liu","xiuyu-wu","baobao-chang"],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a soft label approach to target-level sentiment classification task, in which a history-based soft labeling model is proposed to measure the possibility of a context word as an opinion word.

Based on this finding, we analyze differences between embeddings used by these systems in regard to their capability of handling such cases and argue that intensifiers in context of emotion words need special treatment, as is established for sentiment polarity classification, but not for more fine-grained emotion prediction. To resolve this issue, we analyze different aspects of a post-processing pipeline which enriches the word representations of such phrases. This includes expansion of semantic spaces at the phrase level and sub-word level followed by retrofitting to emotion lexicons. We evaluate the impact of these steps with {`}A La Carte and Bag-of-Substrings extensions based on pretrained GloVe,Word2vec, and fastText embeddings against a crowd-sourced corpus of intensity annotations for tweets containing our focus phrases. We show that the fastText-based models do not gain from handling these specific phrases under inspection. For Word2vec embeddings, we show that our post-processing pipeline improves the results by up to 8{\\%} on a novel dataset densly populated with intensifiers while it does not decrease the performance on the established EmoInt dataset.","pages":"25--34","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W19-1304","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W19-1304","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Minneapolis, USA","year":"2019","month":"June","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Tenth Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment and Social Media Analysis"},{"id":"W19-1305","title":"Enhancing the Measurement of Social Effects by Capturing Morality","authors":["Rezapour, Rezvaneh","Shah, Saumil H.","Diesner, Jana"],"emails":["","",""],"author_id":["rezvaneh-rezapour","saumil-h-shah","jana-diesner"],"abstract":"We investigate the relationship between basic principles of human morality and the expression of opinions in user-generated text data.

While personal values and social effects are abstract and complex concepts, they have practical implications and are relevant for a wide range of NLP applications. To extract human values (in this paper, morality) and measure social effects (morality and stance), we empirically evaluate the usage of a morality lexicon that we expanded via a quality controlled, human in the loop process. As a result, we enhanced the Moral Foundations Dictionary in size (from 324 to 4,636 syntactically disambiguated entries) and scope. We used both lexica for feature-based and deep learning classification (SVM, RF, and LSTM) to test their usefulness for measuring social effects. We find that the enhancement of the original lexicon led to measurable improvements in prediction accuracy for the selected NLP tasks.","pages":"35--45","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W19-1305","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W19-1305","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Minneapolis, USA","year":"2019","month":"June","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Tenth Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment and Social Media Analysis"},{"id":"W19-1306","title":"Using Structured Representation and Data: A Hybrid Model for Negation and Sentiment in Customer Service Conversations","authors":["Misra, Amita","Bhuiyan, Mansurul","Mahmud, Jalal","Tripathy, Saurabh"],"emails":["","","","ripathy2@ibm.com"],"author_id":["amita-misra","mansurul-bhuiyan","jalal-mahmud","saurabh-tripathy"],"abstract":"Twitter customer service interactions have recently emerged as an effective platform to respond and engage with customers.

In this work, we analyze the emotions and sentiments associated with words in tweets posted before and after hitchBOT{'}s destruction to answer two questions: Were there any differences in the emotions expressed across the different countries visited by hitchBOT? And how did the public react to the demise of hitchBOT? Our analyses indicate that while there were few cross-cultural differences in sentiment towards hitchBOT, there was a significant negative emotional reaction to its destruction, suggesting that people had formed an emotional connection with hitchBOT and perceived its destruction as morally wrong. We discuss potential implications of anthropomorphism and emotional attachment to robots from the perspective of robot ethics.","pages":"62--71","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W19-1308","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W19-1308","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Minneapolis, USA","year":"2019","month":"June","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Tenth Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment and Social Media Analysis"},{"id":"W19-1309","title":"{``}When Numbers Matter!{''}: Detecting Sarcasm in Numerical Portions of Text","authors":["Dubey, Abhijeet","Kumar, Lakshya","Somani, Arpan","Joshi, Aditya","Bhattacharyya, Pushpak"],"emails":["","","","",""],"author_id":["abhijeet-dubey","lakshya-kumar","arpan-somani","aditya-joshi","pushpak-bhattacharyya"],"abstract":"Research in sarcasm detection spans almost a decade.

Initially, to get an insight into the problem, we implement a rule-based and a statistical machine learning-based (ML) classifier. The rule-based classifier conveys the crux of the numerical sarcasm problem, namely, incongruity arising out of numbers. The statistical ML classifier uncovers the indicators i.e., features of such sarcasm. The actual system in place, however, are two deep learning (DL) models, CNN and attention network that obtains an F-score of 0.93 and 0.91 on our dataset of tweets containing numbers.

An important prerequisite to effectively achieve this aim is considering the limitations in resource-lean languages. In this paper, cross-lingual subjectivity detection on resource lean languages is investigated using two different approaches: a language-model based and a learning-to-rank approach.
