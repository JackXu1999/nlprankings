This paper discusses theoretical and ethical frameworks for using gender as a variable in NLP studies and proposes four guidelines for researchers and practitioners. The principles outlined here should guide practitioners, researchers, and peer reviewers, and they may be applicable to other social categories, such as race, applied to human beings connected to NLP research.","pages":"1--11","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W17-1601","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W17-1601","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Valencia, Spain","year":"2017","month":"April","booktitle":"Proceedings of the First {ACL} Workshop on Ethics in Natural Language Processing"},{"id":"W17-1602","title":"These are not the Stereotypes You are Looking For: Bias and Fairness in Authorial Gender Attribution","authors":["Koolen, Corina","van Cranenburgh, Andreas"],"emails":["c.w.koolen@uva.nl","cranenburgh@phil.hhu.de"],"author_id":["corina-koolen","andreas-van-cranenburgh"],"abstract":"Stylometric and text categorization results show that author gender can be discerned in texts with relatively high accuracy. However, it is difficult to explain what gives rise to these results and there are many possible confounding factors, such as the domain, genre, and target audience of a text. More fundamentally, such classification efforts risk invoking stereotyping and essentialism. We explore this issue in two datasets of Dutch literary novels, using commonly used descriptive (LIWC, topic modeling) and predictive (machine learning) methods. Our results show the importance of controlling for variables in the corpus and we argue for taking care not to overgeneralize from the results.","pages":"12--22","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W17-1602","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W17-1602","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Valencia, Spain","year":"2017","month":"April","booktitle":"Proceedings of the First {ACL} Workshop on Ethics in Natural Language Processing"},{"id":"W17-1603","title":"A Quantitative Study of Data in the {NLP} community","authors":["Mieskes, Margot"],"emails":["margot.mieskes@h-da.de"],"author_id":["margot-mieskes"],"abstract":"We present results on a quantitative analysis of publications in the NLP domain on collecting, publishing and availability of research data.

One natural and necessary question that needs to be addressed in this context, both in research projects and in production settings, is the question how ethical the work is, both regarding the process and its outcome. Towards this end, we articulate a set of issues, propose a set of best practices, notably a process featuring an ethics review board, and sketch and how they could be meaningfully applied. Our main argument is that ethical outcomes ought to be achieved by design, i.e. by following a process aligned by ethical values. We also offer some response options for those facing ethics issues. While a number of previous works exist that discuss ethical issues, in particular around big data and machine learning, to the authors{'} knowledge this is the first account of NLP and ethics from the perspective of a principled process.","pages":"30--40","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W17-1604","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W17-1604","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Valencia, Spain","year":"2017","month":"April","booktitle":"Proceedings of the First {ACL} Workshop on Ethics in Natural Language Processing"},{"id":"W17-1605","title":"Building Better Open-Source Tools to Support Fairness in Automated Scoring","authors":["Madnani, Nitin","Loukina, Anastassia","von Davier, Alina","Burstein, Jill","Cahill, Aoife"],"emails":["nmadnani@ets.org","aloukina@ets.org","avier@act.org","jburstein@ets.org","acahill@ets.org"],"author_id":["nitin-madnani","anastassia-loukina","alina-von-davier","jill-burstein","aoife-cahill"],"abstract":"Automated scoring of written and spoken responses is an NLP application that can significantly impact lives especially when deployed as part of high-stakes tests such as the GRE\u00ae and the TOEFL\u00ae. Ethical considerations require that automated scoring algorithms treat all test-takers fairly. The educational measurement community has done significant research on fairness in assessments and automated scoring systems must incorporate their recommendations. The best way to do that is by making available automated, non-proprietary tools to NLP researchers that directly incorporate these recommendations and generate the analyses needed to help identify and resolve biases in their scoring systems. In this paper, we attempt to provide such a solution.","pages":"41--52","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W17-1605","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W17-1605","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Valencia, Spain","year":"2017","month":"April","booktitle":"Proceedings of the First {ACL} Workshop on Ethics in Natural Language Processing"},{"id":"W17-1606","title":"Gender and Dialect Bias in {Y}ou{T}ube{'}s Automatic Captions","authors":["Tatman, Rachael"],"emails":["rctatman@uw.edu"],"author_id":["rachael-tatman"],"abstract":"This project evaluates the accuracy of YouTube{'}s automatically-generated captions across two genders and five dialect groups.

In this paper, we present a number of ethical issues along with other areas of concern that are related to the competitive nature of shared tasks.
