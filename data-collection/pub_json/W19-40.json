Due to the limited availability of existing corpora annotated for hedging, linguists and other language scientists have been constrained as to the extent they can study this phenomenon. In this paper, we introduce a new method of acquiring hedging annotations via crowdsourcing, based on reformulating the task of labeling hedges as a simple word sense disambiguation task. We also introduce a new hedging corpus we have constructed by applying this method, a collection of forum posts annotated using Amazon Mechanical Turk. We found that the crowdsourced judgments we obtained had an inter-annotator agreement of 92.89{\\%} (Fleiss{'} Kappa=0.751) and, when comparing a subset of these annotations to an expert-annotated gold standard, an accuracy of 96.65{\\%}.","pages":"1--5","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W19-4001","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W19-4001","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Florence, Italy","year":"2019","month":"August","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 13th Linguistic Annotation Workshop"},{"id":"W19-4002","title":"{W}i{R}e57 : A Fine-Grained Benchmark for Open Information Extraction","authors":["Lechelle, William","Gotti, Fabrizio","Langlais, Phillippe"],"emails":["lechellw@iro.umontreal.ca","gottif@iro.umontreal.ca","felipe@iro.umontreal.ca"],"author_id":["william-lechelle1","fabrizio-gotti","philippe-langlais"],"abstract":"We build a reference for the task of Open Information Extraction, on five documents.

However, annotating coherence relations with untrained workers is not trivial. We here propose a novel two-step annotation procedure, which extends an earlier method by Scholman and Demberg (2017a). In our approach, coherence relation labels are inferred from connectives that workers insert into the text.

By using a new annotation scheme, we can produce Sejong-style morphological analysis and part-of-speech tagging results which have been the \\textit{de facto} standard for Korean language processing. We also explore the possibility of doing named-entity recognition and semantic-role labelling for Korean using the new annotation scheme.","pages":"195--202","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W19-4022","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W19-4022","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Florence, Italy","year":"2019","month":"August","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 13th Linguistic Annotation Workshop"},{"id":"W19-4023","title":"A {T}urkish Dataset for Gender Identification of Twitter Users","authors":["Sezerer, Erhan","Polatbilek, Ozan","Tekir, Selma"],"emails":["erhansezerer@iyte.edu.tr","ozanpolatbilek@iyte.edu.tr","selmatekir@iyte.edu.tr"],"author_id":["erhan-sezerer","ozan-polatbilek","selma-tekir"],"abstract":"Author profiling is the identification of an author{'}s gender, age, and language from his\/her texts. With the increasing trend of using Twitter as a means to express thought, profiling the gender of an author from his\/her tweets has become a challenge. Although several datasets in different languages have been released on this problem, there is still a need for multilingualism. In this work, we propose a dataset of tweets of Turkish Twitter users which are labeled with their gender information. The dataset has 3368 users in training set and 1924 users in test set where each user has 100 tweets. The dataset is publicly available.","pages":"203--207","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W19-4023","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W19-4023","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Florence, Italy","year":"2019","month":"August","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 13th Linguistic Annotation Workshop"},{"id":"W19-4024","title":"Comparative judgments are more consistent than binary classification for labelling word complexity","authors":["Gooding, Sian","Kochmar, Ekaterina","Sarkar, Advait","Blackwell, Alan"],"emails":["shg36@cam.ac.uk","ek358@cam.ac.uk","advait@microsoft.com","afb21@cam.ac.uk"],"author_id":["sian-gooding","ekaterina-kochmar","advait-sarkar","alan-blackwell"],"abstract":"Lexical simplification systems replace complex words with simple ones based on a model of which words are complex in context.

They also lack systematic support for hierarchically structured labels, i.e., one label being conceptually more general than another (e.g., anamnesis in relation to family anamnesis). Moreover, as a more fundamental shortcoming of today{'}s tools, they provide no continuous quality con trol mechanisms for the annotation process, an essential feature to intrinsically support iterative cycles in the development of annotation guidelines. We alleviated these problems by developing WAT-SL 2.0, an open-source web-based annotation tool for long-segment labeling, hierarchically structured label sets and built-ins for quality control.","pages":"215--219","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W19-4025","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W19-4025","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Florence, Italy","year":"2019","month":"August","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 13th Linguistic Annotation Workshop"},{"id":"W19-4026","title":"Creation of a corpus with semantic role labels for {H}ungarian","authors":["Nov{\\'a}k, Attila","Laki, L{\\'a}szl{\\'o}","Nov{\\'a}k, Borb{\\'a}la","D{\\\"o}m{\\\"o}t{\\\"o}r, Andrea","Ligeti-Nagy, No{\\'e}mi","Kalivoda, {\\'A}gnes"],"emails":["","","","","surname.firstname@itk.ppke.hu",""],"author_id":["attila-novak","laszlo-laki","borbala-novak","andrea-domotor","noemi-ligeti-nagy","agnes-kalivoda"],"abstract":"In this article, an ongoing research is presented, the immediate goal of which is to create a corpus annotated with semantic role labels for Hungarian that can be used to train a parser-based system capable of formulating relevant questions about the text it processes.

For English, there is a large annotated corpus (with approximately 39K sentences) that supports the research with the representation. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is only one restricted corpus for Portuguese, which contains 1,527 sentences. In this context, this paper presents an effort to build a general purpose AMR-annotated corpus for Brazilian Portuguese by translating and adapting AMR English guidelines. Our results show that such approach is feasible, but there are some challenging phenomena to solve. More than this, efforts are necessary to increase the coverage of the corresponding lexical resource that supports the annotation.","pages":"236--244","doi":"10.18653\/v1\/W19-4028","url":"https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W19-4028","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","address":"Florence, Italy","year":"2019","month":"August","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 13th Linguistic Annotation Workshop"}]
