Abstract

This paper discusses genitive phrases in
Hindi/Urdu in general and puts a particular fo-
cus on genitive scrambling, a process whereby
the basic order of constituents is changed. In
Hindi/Urdu, genitive phrases may not only
occur at different structural positions within
the NP that they modify; under the right
circumstances, they can also be found out-
side of the NP, yielding discontinuous struc-
tures. The theoretical challenge is to identify
and formalize the linguistic constraints that
govern genitive scrambling. Further, a suc-
cessful computational treatment correctly at-
taches the genitive phrase to its head NP. I use
a Lexical-Functional Grammar to solve both
challenges, demonstrating that the constraints
can be aptly formulated using a functional un-
certainty path. Successful attachment further
depends on the morphological agreement of
the genitive phrase with its head. On a the-
oretical level, the present contribution sheds
light on the possibilities of NP discontinu-
ities in a morphologically rich language like
Hindi/Urdu.

1 Introduction

Discontinuous constituents offer particular chal-
lenges for various NLP applications, such as
question-answering, coreference resolution or topic
modeling. This paper relates to an application that
is further up the NLP toolchain: syntactic parsing.
Here, the main challenges lie in:

• adapting the parser to be able to process the dis-
continuous structures;

• reconstruct the dependencies in the analysis,
i.e., attach the discontinuous parts to their syn-
tactic heads.

Third, from a theoretical linguistic point of view,
one would also want to derive generalizations about
what kinds of discontinuities are possible, and what
kinds do not appear. Depending on the language
studied, investigating such constraints is helpful
since they can provide cross-linguistic insight into
the phenomenon of discontinuity, and why it can or
cannot take place.

This paper presents a study of discontinuous NPs
in the morphologically-rich South Asian language
Hindi/Urdu.1 The focus is on genitive NP modi-
fiers, which display a large deal of discontinuity. As
will be seen below, in the right configurations, they
may be scrambled out of their NP domain, removing
them from the heads that they modify. Neither the
phenomenon itself nor the configurations that allow
for it have been previously discussed in the litera-
ture.

The paper contributes to solving all three of the
above challenges. It discusses the empirical prop-
erties of the Hindi/Urdu genitive in general as well
as genitive discontinuity, investigated by collect-
ing data from native speakers and searching the

1The two languages Hindi and Urdu are so closely related
that many researchers in linguistics treat them as a single lan-
guage, Hindi/Urdu. Differences between Urdu and Hindi are
mainly in the script (Urdu uses a version of Arabic script, while
Hindi uses Devanagari) as well as in the vocabulary (Urdu uses
more Persian and Arabic vocabulary, and Hindi evolved from
Sanskrit). There are further minor differences in the phonology
as well as in the derivational morphology; the syntax is almost
identical.

Hindi/Urdu Treebank (Bhatt et al., 2009) (§2,3,4).
I arrive at a couple of theoretical generalizations,
which can be aptly formulated via functional uncer-
tainty within the framework of Lexical-Functional
Grammar (LFG, Dalrymple (2001)). I suggest that
the possibility of the genitive to appear outside its
NP is a result of the rich agreement between the gen-
itive case marker and the NP head. Finally, I de-
scribe how the Hindi/Urdu ParGram grammar (Butt
and King, 2007; Bögel et al., 2009), a computa-
tional LFG grammar developed as part of the Par-
Gram project (Sulger et al., 2013; Butt et al., 2002)
and implemented in XLE (Crouch et al., 2015), is
adapted to parse and correctly attach discontinuous
genitives to their NPs (§5).2 The paper concludes in
§6.
2 General Description

The genitive case in Hindi/Urdu is realized using the
clitic k-, which is attached to a possessor NP. Un-
der the analysis of Hindi/Urdu case in Butt and King
(2004), which I adapt here, all case clitics function-
ally head a KP (case phrase).3 The genitive differs
from other case clitics: it agrees in number, gen-
der and morphological form (nominative or oblique)
with the head noun, the possessum. For the femi-
nine, there is morphological syncretism in that a sin-
gle form ki is used throughout the feminine inflec-
tional pattern. For the masculine, there is syncretism
between the singular oblique and plural nominative
and oblique. Table 1 shows the complete pattern of
the clitic. In (1)–(3), the a. examples are valid NPs,
displaying the correct agreement pattern.

importance here; the interested reader is referred to Butt and
King (2004) for a comprehensive discussion.

Within NPs, the modifying possessor phrase
comes first, then the possessum (i.e., the head of the
NP); this conforms to the general clausal word order
in Hindi/Urdu, which is head-final (Mohanan, 1994;
Butt, 1995). The position of the genitive phrase
varies with respect to other NP modifiers, such as
adjectives or quantifiers; see (4) for an example. NP
modifiers occurring after the NP head are judged as
ungrammatical by the informants; see (4c) for an
example. Another example illustrating the variable
word order inside the NP is shown in (5).

d. kUch hoSyar Ustad=ka talIb-Ilm
e. hoSyar kUch Ustad=ka talIb-Ilm
f. hoSyar Ustad=ka kUch talIb-Ilm

The constraint that NP modifiers have to precede
their head inside the NP is corroborated by data such
as in (6b) (a permutation of (6a)). Here, the genitive
occurs after the NP head, bet.e ‘sons’, which is itself
marked with the ergative case. The fact that (6b) is
ungrammatical is a clear indication that the genitive
phrases cannot be right-adjoined to the NP head.

The Hindi/Urdu genitive has a wide functional
distribution: it appears on adjuncts and nominal
arguments. The LFG analysis of Sulger (to ap-
pear) is assumed here, which argues for a differen-
tiated treatment of the genitive KP in terms of the

grammatical functions (GF) subject/SUBJ (7a), ob-
ject/OBJ (7b) and adjunct/ADJUNCT (7c).4

3 Genitive Scrambling

In addition to the variable word order inside NPs,
there are examples showing that the genitive modi-
fiers can occur outside of the NPs they modify. I will
refer to this as Genitive Scrambling. In (8a), the gen-
itive occurs in the canonical position inside the NP
to the left of the head noun. In (8b), the genitive is
scrambled outside of the subject NP to the end of the
clause; still, it must be analyzed as a modifier of the
head noun dost ‘friend’, since it cannot be argued to
be an argument of the intransitive verb a ‘come’.

(8) a. ram=ka
Ram.M.SG=GEN.M.SG
dost
friend.M.SG.NOM

ay-a
come-PERF.M.SG

‘Ram’s friend came.’ (Butt and
Zinsmeister, 2009)

b. dost
friend.M.SG.NOM

ay-a
come-PERF.M.SG

ram=ka
Ram.M.SG=GEN.M.SG
‘Ram’s friend came.’ (Butt and
Zinsmeister, 2009)

In (9a), the object gar. i ‘car’ is modified by the
genitive Us=ki ‘her/his/its’. The genitive can be

4Due to space limitations, I do not go into detail regarding
the treatment in Sulger (to appear). I will say, however, that
the evidence includes binding of a reflexive pronoun as well as
iterativity/optionality of nominal arguments vs. adjuncts. Note
also that semantically, the genitive may realize various roles as a
modifier, e.g., an agent in (7a), a patient in (7b), and an attribute
in (7c). This semantic variety is known from many languages,
including English; a semantic classification of the genitive is
certainly not within the scope of this paper.

scrambled out of the object to the beginning of the
clause as in (9b). From the morphosyntax, it is clear
that in (9b) the feminine-inflected Us=ki ‘her/his/its’
modifies gar. i ‘car’, since that is the only feminine
nominal in the sentence. A very similar example is
in (10).

Genitives may also be scrambled to the right. In
(11a), a permutation of (9a), the object is topical-
ized to the front of the clause. In (11b), the genitive
phrase modifying the object is scrambled to the right
and occurs after the subject. A similar example is
given in (12), where kIs=ki ‘whose’ modifies kItab
‘book’, but is not in the same constituent.

Recall that the order within NPs is head-final.
As seen in (11)–(12), however, when genitives are
scrambled outside of their NP, this order is not
necessarily preserved. Using the terminology of
Fanselow and Féry (2006), I refer to scrambled gen-
itives that occur before their heads in the sentence
as non-inverted scrambled genitives, and to scram-
bled genitives that occur after their heads as inverted
scrambled genitives.

It is a reasonable assumption that scrambling of
genitive phrases is possible since the genitive dis-
plays rich morphology which agrees with its head,

40



enabling speakers to identify the nominal in the sen-
tence modified by the genitive. Fanselow and Féry
(2006) identify agreement inside NPs as a main
factor influencing the availability of discontinuous
NPs across languages, but there are also counter-
examples against this generalization; Turkish, for
example, has discontinuous NPs, in spite of the ab-
sence of agreement inside nominal projections.

4 Some Preferences and Constraints

The operation of genitive scrambling does not occur
without constraints. This section sums up these con-
straints, which serve as the empirical background for
the XLE implementation of genitive scrambling as
described in §5. Each of the constraints was verified
by intensive consultation with at least three native
speakers.

4.1 Local Attachments are Preferred

Consider (13a), which involves a topicalized object.
The possessor of that object can be scrambled to the
right as in (13b). In cases such as (13b), Us=ki is
either a scrambled genitive modifying gar. i ‘car’ or
a canonical genitive locally attached to bag ‘park’;
the agreement morphology does not rule out ei-
ther. Where the agreement morphology permits both
scrambled as well as locally attached genitives, local
attachments are highly preferred. Here, informants
judge Us=ki ‘his/her’ as modifying bag ‘park’, but
acknowledge that it may also modify gar. i ‘car’.

(13) a. Us=ki
PRON.3.SG.OBL=GEN.F.SG
gar.i
car.F.SG.NOM

nadya=ne
Nadya.F.SG=ERG

bag=mẽ

bag=mẽ
park.F.SG=LOC.IN

dekh-i
see-PERF.F.SG

‘The car, Nadya saw in her park.’
preferred over
‘His/her car, Nadya saw in the park.’

The preference for local attachment is reflected in
a principle well-known from cognitive science, first
discussed by Kimball (1973) as the Right Associa-
tion principle, and reformulated by Gibson (1991)
as the Recency Preference.

4.2 Scrambling and Case

The examples above involve genitives that are
scrambled out of bare NPs. Genitives may also
be scrambled out of NPs that are overtly case-
marked; in this case, inverted scrambled genitives
are ungrammatical, and the genitive has to pre-
cede its head in the clause. Examples are shown
in (14). In both sentences, ram=ke ‘Ram’s’ modi-
fies bAcco=ne ‘children=ERG’, but since the latter is
ergative-marked, the former has to precede it.

(14) a. ram=ke
Ram.M.SG=GEN.M.SG.OBL

A similar example involving a genitive scrambled
from an overtly-marked object NP is given in (15):
ram=ke ‘Ram’s’ needs to precede its head kUt.t.e=ko
‘dog=ACC’.

(15) a. bAcco=ne
child.M.PL.OBL=ERG
ram=ke

see-PERF.M.SG

Recall that genitive KPs modifying nominals in
overtly case-marked KPs need to have oblique nom-
inal morphology. One might assume, then, that ex-
amples such as (15b) are bad simply because there
are several options for the genitive KP to modify
a nominal, given the high amount of syncretism in
genitive case marking for the oblique; e.g., in (15b)
the genitive could modify both bAcco and kUt.t.e. (16)
shows that this cannot be the issue. Here, the geni-
tive can modify both nominals, being in linear prece-
dence to both of them; cf. also (14b), which is un-
grammatical, even though the agreement morphol-
ogy clearly rules out any other possibilities of mod-
ification aside of bAcco.

(16) ram=ke

dekh-a
see-PERF.M.SG

or
‘Ram’s children saw the dog yesterday.’

4.3 Scrambling from Complement Clauses
Another constraint concerns complement clauses.
None of my informants judge possessors scram-
bled out of finite complement clauses as gram-
matical; cf. the ungrammatical examples in (17).
However, a majority of my informants indicate
that it is grammatical to scramble genitive phrases
from within non-finite complement clauses, e.g.,
the clause headed by the modal verb sAk ‘can’ in
(18). This is in line with the findings by Ma-
hajan (1990), Kidwai (1999) as well as Kidwai
(2000), who state that scrambling of arguments from
within finite complement clauses is generally not ac-
cepted, whereas scrambling from infinite comple-
ment clauses is.

4.4 No Scrambling out of Adjuncts

The third constraint concerning genitive scrambling
is that genitive KPs may not be scrambled from
within adjuncts. In (19a), Us=ki ‘her/his/its’ is a
genitive phrase modifying bag ‘park’, which itself
is locative case-marked and an adjunct to the over-
all clause. It is found that the possessor may not be
scrambled from its NP to any other position in the
clause (19b–c).

‘Ram saw an elephant in my park.’

b. * Us=ki ram=ne bag=mẽ hat.hi dekh-a

c. * ram=ne bag=mẽ hat.hi Us=ki dekh-a

Island behavior, i.e., the unavailability of con-
stituents for movement/scrambling, is symptomatic
for clausal adjuncts and is well-known throughout
the literature, first discussed by Ross (1967). It is
also a well-known diagnostic for distinguishing ar-
guments from adjuncts, as discussed by, e.g., Need-
ham and Toivonen (2011) in an LFG setting.

42



4.5 No Scrambling from Deep Within
The last constraint to be discussed here indicates
that it is not possible to scramble genitive phrases
that are selected by nominals further down a path
of grammatical functions. Consider the examples
in (20a). SOhAr ‘husband’ is modified by a genitive
SUBJ orAt=ke ‘the woman’s’. SOhAr=ki, in turn, is
an extrinsic possessor SUBJ modifying the overall
object of the clause, gar. i ‘car’. The structure is as
indicated by the bracketing in (20b). In the similar
example (21), sUrx rAng=ke ‘of red color’ is an AD-
JUNCT modifying mAkan ‘house’.

(20) a. ram=ne
Ram.M.SG=ERG
orAt=ke

SOhAr=ki

Given such situations, consider the examples in
(22)–(23). In (22a–b), orAt=ke ‘the woman’s’, the
SUBJ genitive KP modifying SOhAr ‘husband’, cannot
appear outside of the NP it is embedded in, i.e., out-
side the NP headed by gar. i ‘car’, since it is embed-
ded too far down in that NP, its GF path being (↑ OBJ
SUBJ SUBJ) (starting from the main clause). (23a–b)
show that the same restriction holds for attributive
genitives such as sUrx rAng=ke ‘of red color’, which
has the path (↑ OBJ SUBJ ADJUNCT) here.

5 XLE Implementation

This section describes the implementation of the
Hindi/Urdu genitive as well as its scrambling prop-
erties and resulting discontinuities. The implemen-
tation uses the XLE grammar development plat-
form, which includes an industrial-strength parser
and generator for LFG grammars (Crouch et al.,
2015).

5.1 General Setup
The lexical entry for the feminine genitive case
marker ki is given in (24). Recall the agreement
pattern of the genitive case marker in Table 1; in
XLE, constraining equations can account for the re-
quirements concerning gender, number as well as
morphological form. In (24), the constraints are in
the form of inside-out constraining equations, since
the genitive KP may either be embedded in a SUBJ,
ADJUNCT or in an OBJ f-structure inside the head
noun’s f-structure. The last line in (24) states that
the case marker needs to be inside an f-structure that
has the feature NTYPE; this ensure that the genitive
only occurs as a nominal case (i.e., not on verbal ar-
guments/adjuncts).

(24) kI K * (ˆ CASE) =c gen
(({SUBJ|OBJ|ADJUNCT} ˆ) GEND) =c fem
(({SUBJ|OBJ|ADJUNCT} ˆ) NTYPE).

The XLE grammar rules in (25) construct the KP
and NP. (25a) states that the KP consists of an NP
and an optional case marker K. (25b) states that an
NP may consist of a simple pronoun or a modified
noun (Nadj). In (25b), the use of the shuffle op-
erator (,), separating the KP, AP and N nodes en-
sures that each of these nodes may occur in any or-
der, thereby allowing for different word orders in-
side the NP. The annotation ! <h ˆ (making use
of the head precedence operator <h) indicates that
the currently annotated c-structure node (here: KP

5.2 Generalizing and Implementing Genitive
Scrambling

The genitive scrambling facts can be formalized via
a functional uncertainty path as in (26).6 The expres-
sion is matched by a variety of paths, e.g., SUBJ,

5The rules in the grammar are more complicated than shown
here; e.g., the Nadj rule includes further nodes such as quan-
tifiers, demonstratives etc. The scheme used by the Hindi/Urdu
ParGram grammar for transliterating the Urdu Arabic script is
described in Malik et al. (2010) as well as Bögel (2012).

6Documentation for the implementation of functional uncer-
tainty in XLE is at http://ling.uni-konstanz.de/
pages/xle/doc/notations.html#N4.1.5.

OBJ, XCOMP SUBJ, etc. (XCOMP is the gram-
matical function used for non-finite complement
clauses). Thus, (26) describes exactly those paths
that scrambled genitives may be extracted from; it
does not allow for genitives scrambled from ad-
juncts, finite complement clauses (which are inside
the COMP GF) or from deeper GF paths (e.g., OBJ
SUBJ).

(26) KP-SCRAMBLE-PATH = (XCOMP)
{SUBJ|OBJ|OBL|OBJ-GO|OBJ-TH}.

(27) is the XLE rule template that adds scrambled
genitive KPs to the c-structure tree. Functionally,
they are annotated as subjects, objects or adjuncts
(lines 6–8) inside a path variable instantiated from
KP-SCRAMBLE-PATH (line 2). Lines 3–5 check
the case feature of the head noun; it is either nom-
inative (i.e., a bear NP), in which case there is no
precedence constraint, or it is not nominative (i.e., it
is overtly case-marked), in which case the genitive is
required to precede its head (again implemented us-
ing head precedence, see above). Finally, line 9 adds
an O(ptimality)T(heory) mark to the scrambled gen-
itive, called attach, which marks the analysis as
non-optimal when it is in direct competition with a
local attachment analysis (which does not carry the
OT mark).

(27) KP-SCRAMBLE = KP*: (! CASE) = gen
(ˆ KP-SCRAMBLE-PATH) = %PATH
{(%PATH CASE) =c nom
|(%PATH CASE) ˜= nom
! <h %PATH}

{(%PATH SUBJ) = !
|(%PATH OBJ) = !
|! $ (%PATH ADJUNCT)
@(OT-MARK attach).

5.3 Testsuite Creation
To perform regression tests on the implementation,
a separate testsuite file was created with examples
of vanilla genitives as well as instances of geni-
tive scrambling. The testsuite currently includes 36
grammatical and ungrammatical examples, each be-
tween two and eight words long, and has been man-
ually constructed in close collaboration with the na-
tive speakers. All grammatical sentences are parsed
successfully, while all ungrammatical sentences are
ruled out.7

7One ungrammatical sentence in fact times out with the de-
fault XLE timeout setting of 30 seconds, pending investigation.

44



Given the ambiguity of the genitive discussed in
Section 2, all sentences yield ambiguous parse re-
sults. As an example, reconsider (13b). The sen-
tence is part of the testsuite and yields two optimal as
well as two unoptimal solutions. Under the two op-
timal readings, Us=ki ‘his/her’ locally modifies bag
‘park’ as a subject or an adjunct; under the two un-
optimal readings, Us=ki ‘his/her’ is a scrambled gen-
itive subject or adjunct modifying gar. i ‘car’.

XLE does not display unoptimal solutions by de-
fault; the developer/annotator can select the unopti-
mal solution(s) by clicking the OT mark that con-
trols the (dis)preference. Figure 3 shows the optimal
solution where Us=ki ‘his/her’ is a subject, while
Figure 4 shows the corresponding unoptimal solu-
tion, i.e., the scrambled genitive analysis.8

6 Summary

The paper describes Hindi/Urdu genitives in general
and its scrambling properties in particular. I take
a detailed look at the empirical distribution of this
phenomenon, including its syntactic constraints, and
formulate a generalization using LFG. The general-
ization is implemented in the Hindi/Urdu ParGram
grammar using XLE.

8The c-structures are not shown here due to space limita-
tions. In the c-structure corresponding to the f-structure in Fig-
ure 3, the genitive attaches below the NP headed by bag ‘park’,
while in the c-structure for Figure 4, the genitive attaches to the
clausal node, resulting in a flat structure.

Future theoretical work includes a comparison
with other morphologically-rich languages. An ini-
tial investigation has shown that scrambling data
in Turkish, as discussed by e.g. Kornfilt (2003),
are similar, but display a constraint called the “bar-
rier constraint” by Chomsky (1986), which rules
out possessors that occur directly right-adjoined
to arguments; the constraint does not exist in
Hindi/Urdu. Since ParGram includes a Turkish
grammar (Çetinoglu, 2009), a comparison of the an-
notations necessary to cover the genitive scrambling
facts would be interesting.
