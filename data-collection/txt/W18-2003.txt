What’s XLIFF?

[Do we need this slide? Demographics of the room..]

•XML Localiz(s)ation Interchange File Format

• The only *open standard* *bitext format*

•XLIFF lives in OASIS since 2001

• First fully standardized as XLIFF 1.2 in February 2008

•XLIFF 2.0 August 2014

•XLIFF 2.1 February 2018

What’s new compared to 1.2

Overall: Focus on the “naïve” implementer, don’t assume tribal 
knowledge

• Fixed inline data model [NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE]

• Explicit fragment identification mechanism
-> IANA registration of media type [*.xlf]
provisional for 2.0 -> permanent for 2.1

• Re-segmentation [segmentation modification] capability 
[NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE]

• Better managed extensibility [NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE]

• Advanced Constraints and Processing Requirements
-> Enforceable Conformance Clause

What’s new compared to 2.0

Overall: All XLIFF 2 is and will be backward & forwards compatible

• IANA registration of media type [*.xlf] 
provisional for 2.0 -> permanent as of XLIFF Version 2.1 for 2.0 and 
higher

• Better managed extensibility [since 2.0]
-> Demoted 2.0 Change Tracking Module to an extension
-> Promoted ITS 2.0 extension to a huge and powerful module in 2.1

• Advanced Constraints and Processing Requirements
-> Enforceable Conformance Clause [since 2.0]
-> Translated the human readable conformance requirements into an 
exhaustive set of fully machine readable declarative validation 
artifacts
-> enables complex automated roundtrip workflows relying on strict 
validity

Why should MT implementers care for XLIFF?

• XLIFF has a simple and efficient inline data model capable of 
representing any content formats, well formed or not
• Native code representation – masking

• Powerful annotation mechanism with standoff capability
Localization Note | Terminology | Text Analytics

Subsegment or supersegment Matching | Custom annotations | State and substate

MT Confidence | Localization Quality Issue [MQM] & Rating | Provenance

• XLIFF is bitext, therefore alignment of source and target segments is 
100% guaranteed

• XLIFF is extremely metadata rich, hence suitable for on the fly 
creation of custom corpora

Domain | Terminology | Language tags | Quality | Provenance

XLIFF 2 data model reuse

• Industry and public sector fast to adopt the superior XLIFF 2 data model. 
Desire to unleash the XLIFF 2 data model goodne, free it from XMLisms and 
SGMLisms ;-)

• https://github.com/oasis-tcs/xliff-omos-jliff

• JLIFF feeds into TAPICC Tracks 2 & 3
• Real time exchange of data at unit level
• While XLIFF mandates the whole document structure, JLIFF is 

specifically defined as a *Fragment* Interchange format
[JSON Localization Interchange Fragment Format]
