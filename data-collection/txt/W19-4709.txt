Abstract

This paper introduces a novel method to track
collocational variations in diachronic corpora
that can identify several changes undergone
by these phraseological combinations and to
propose alternative solutions found in later
periods. The strategy consists of extract-
ing syntactically-related candidates of collo-
cations and ranking them using statistical as-
sociation measures. Then, starting from the
first period of the corpus, the system tracks
each combination over time, verifying differ-
ent types of historical variation such as the
loss of one or both lemmas, the disappearance
of the collocation, or its diachronic frequency
trend. Using a distributional semantics strat-
egy, it also suggests linguistic structures that
convey meanings similar to those of extinct
collocations. A case study on historical cor-
pora of Portuguese and Spanish shows that the
system speeds up and facilitates the finding of
some diachronic changes and phraseological
shifts that are harder to identify without using
automated methods.

1 Introduction

One of the main characteristics of natural language
is change, as there is no evidence of any language
which does not show different types of variation.
Change seems to affect all the strata of natural lan-
guages: phonology, morphology, syntax, and se-
mantics. Besides this language-internal perspec-
tive, the study of language variation may also take
into account the external causes of change: that is,
geographical, social, or historical factors, among
others (Chambers and Schilling, 2013).

Historical (diachronic) studies of language, car-
ried out by philologists and historical linguists,
have shown how language evolves over time, find-
ing interesting cross-linguistic generalizations. In
those cases where digitalized resources exist, sev-
eral corpus linguistics and natural language pro-

cessing (NLP) methods have been applied to au-
tomate the discovering of language change, thus
alleviating the effort of searching for linguistic
variation (Curzan, 2008; Dipper, 2008). In this
regard, frequency-based strategies are useful to
identify increases and decreases in the use of some
linguistic phenomena (Hilpert and Gries, 2016).
The rise of distributional semantics methods (both
count-based and neural network approaches) also
allowed researchers to track semantic change in
different time periods (Sagi et al., 2009; Gulordava
and Baroni, 2011; Kulkarni et al., 2015; Hamilton
et al., 2016; Bamler and Mandt, 2017; Gamallo
et al., 2018).

A particular case of diachronic variation is the
evolution of lexical combinations over time. In
this respect, research on the diachrony of com-
plex predicates has provided useful knowledge for
theoretical studies on language evolution (Ander-
son, 2006; Butt and Lahiri, 2013; Elenbaas, 2013).
From a different perspective, historical analyses of
collocational patterns have shown that some lex-
ical restrictions vary diachronically, while some
others seem to be more persistent. Thus, stud-
ies such as Alba-Salas (2007) or Garcı́a-Salido
(2017) explore how Spanish causative verbs such
as hacer (‘to make’) or poner (‘to put’) were re-
placed by dar (literally, ‘to give’) to express causa-
tion with different nouns such as miedo (‘fear’) or
vergüenza (‘embarrasment’): hacer vergüenza⇒
dar vergüenza; poner miedo⇒ dar miedo. These
examples show the asymmetry of collocations, un-
derstood as combinations where one of their lexi-
cal units (LUs) (the COLLOCATE: hacer, poner, or
dar) is lexically selected by the other (the BASE:
miedo, vergüenza) (Mel’čuk, 1998).

Understanding the properties of collocations
and other multiword expressions, both in a spe-
cific period of time and diachronically, is cru-
cial not only to understand how a particular lan-



72

guage evolves, but also to develop computational
methods for language processing (Sag et al., 2002;
Ramisch and Villavicencio, 2018). However, this
type of analyses has benefited less from computa-
tional approaches, whereby NLP systems could fa-
cilitate the automatic identification of variations in
lexical combinations. Tools such as DiaCollo (Ju-
rish, 2015) or JESEME (Hellrich and Hahn, 2017)
are able to track changes in word associations and
lexical semantics, but they are not specifically de-
signed to analyze combinations of syntactically
dependent lexical units like the ones exemplified
above.

Taking the above into account, we present a new
method to analyze, in historical corpora, the di-
achronic distribution of collocations and their in-
ternal components. Besides the period when cer-
tain collocations start to be used, the method iden-
tifies four variation types: (1) the disappearance
of both lexical units of the collocation; the loss of
(2) the base or (3) of the collocate, and (4) the loss
of certain combinations whose constituent lemmas
are still used. In each case, the system searches
for other similar combinations and proposes pos-
sible replacements. Furthermore, it classifies the
increase, decrease, or stability of collocations that
continue to be used.

In order to evaluate the usefulness of the pro-
posed method, we carry out a case study on sev-
eral historical corpora of Spanish and Portuguese.
The analyses, both quantitative and qualitative, in-
dicate that the presented approach allows histori-
cal linguists to rapidly analyze the diachronic evo-
lution of collocations, showing some interesting
changes in lexical combinations of the two lan-
guages. The system is freely available and can
be applied to any historical corpus parsed in a
CoNLL-like format.1

The remainder of this paper is organized as
follows. Section 2 presents some related work
on computational approaches to language change,
and Section 3 briefly discusses the theoretical
properties of collocations. In Section 4 we de-
scribe our method to identify diachronic variation
of these expressions. Then, Section 5 shows the
results of both quantitative and qualitative evalu-
ations of the system as well as an error analysis,
and finally, the conclusions and further work are
addressed in Section 6.

2 Related Work

Besides historical linguistic approaches adopted
by the philological tradition, the availability of
diachronic corpora in digital formats allowed re-
searchers from different areas to implement com-
putational approaches to explore historical lan-
guage change. In this regard, Lieberman et al.
(2007) analyzed the past tense of English verbs
over 1, 200 years, showing that the rate of regu-
larization (i.e., the emergence of an -ed past form)
is directly related to frequency.

Using distributional semantic methods, Sagi
et al. (2009) and Cook and Stevenson (2010) found
examples of meaning shift by working with his-
torical corpora combining quantitative and qual-
itative analyses. The former study identified the
probability of semantic change by measuring the
density of a vector space. The latter concen-
trated on amelioration and pejoration cases, that is,
words that change from negative to positive opin-
ions (e.g., the meaning of nice was ‘foolish’), or
from positive to negative ones (e.g., vulgar meant
‘common’).

More recently, several works have taken advan-
tage of the Google Books Ngrams to train English
distributional models of different periods in order
to find semantic change over time (Gulordava and
Baroni, 2011; Wijaya and Yeniterzi, 2011; Kim
et al., 2014; Kulkarni et al., 2015). Similarly,
Hamilton et al. (2016) defined a methodology to
quantify semantic change using four languages
(Chinese, English, German, and French). The re-
sults of this article suggest that polysemous words
are those with higher rates of semantic change, and
that the meaning of frequent words is more sta-
ble over time. The Google Books Ngrams were
also used to implement dependency-based distri-
butional semantics methods to track the semantic
change in Spanish (Gamallo et al., 2017, 2018). To
avoid the alignment problem between the vector
space of each time period, studies such as Bamler
and Mandt (2017) and Rudolph and Blei (2018)
learn a joint time-aware semantic space by means
of dynamic embeddings.

Designed specifically to explore the diachronic
contexts of words, DiaCollo allows historical lin-
guists to analyze the typical collocates of a given
word over time, providing useful information to
identify potential semantic shifts (Jurish, 2015).
JESEME also takes advantage of historical dis-
tributional semantics models to create diachronic

charts for tracking semantic variation and word
emotion over time (Hellrich and Hahn, 2017).2

Inspired by several of these works, our method
uses natural language processing techniques and
distributional semantics methods to support histor-
ical linguists to find diachronic changes of collo-
cations in different languages.

3 Collocations

There are at least two main views of the concept of
collocation. In the Firthian tradition, collocations
are arbitrary and recurrent co-occurrences of two
or more words within a short space of each other
in a text (Benson, 1990; Sinclair, 1991). From this
point of view, collocations are word combinations
occurring together in a given span with greater
frequency than randomly expected (e.g., “night,
dark”).

Along with this statistical or empirical ap-
proach, in the field of phraseology, authors such
as Hausmann (1989) or Mel’čuk (1998) conceive
collocations as directional combinations of two
syntactically related lexical units. According to
this approach, one of the LUs that form the collo-
cation (the BASE) is often defined as autoseman-
tic, because it is chosen by the speaker due to its
meaning. The base, in turn, restricts the selection
of the other LU (the COLLOCATE), which con-
veys a particular meaning depending on a given
base (e.g., “takeCollocate (a) pictureBase”, “blackC
coffeeB”) and is therefore said to be synsemantic.
This conception of collocations encompasses quite
an ample range of compositional lexical combina-
tions (Mel’čuk, 1998), ranging from support verb
constructions—in which verbs provide a tenuous
lexical meaning (e.g. Peter took a walk ∼ Peter’s
walk)—to other types of idiosyncratic couplings,
where collocates express full meanings, but are not
freely interchangeable with theoretical synonyms
(see the case of Pt. arrenegar with the meaning
‘abjure’ used in some sections of the corpus al-
most exclusively in company of demónio ‘devil’
or diabrura ‘deviltry’ in Section 5).

In spite of the differences between the two ap-
proaches, there have been recent attempts at us-
ing statistical measures to automatically identify
phraseological collocations. For instance, Pecina
(2010) investigates the performance of a large set
of statistical association measures in identifying
phraseological combinations. The target colloca-

2http://jeseme.org/

tions of Pecina are only partially coincident with
the definition given above, as, along with colloca-
tions such as make a decision, they also include
non-compositional combinations. More recently,
Evert et al. (2017) and Uhrig et al. (2018) under-
took a research with similar purposes, but, in con-
trast to Pecina (2010), who started from bigrams,
they used dependency parsing to identify collo-
cation candidates and, instead of manual identifi-
cation of phraseological combinations, they used
collocation dictionaries as gold standards.

This paper also combines the statistical and
phraseological approaches. Whereas phraseolog-
ical collocations seem more interesting for di-
achronic investigations, statistical information can
serve as a tool for identifying collocation candi-
dates. The method proposed takes advantage of
dependency parsing to identificate syntactically-
related base–collocate candidate pairs, and uses
statistical analysis in order to identify collocation
candidates in each historical period.

4 Identification of diachronic changes on
collocations

4.1 Method overview

The strategy for identifying historical variations
on collocations consists of analyzing each of these
combinations over time, starting from the first
epoch when the collocation appears in the cor-
pus. For each collocation, we identify whether it
is still used in the following periods, and if it dis-
appears, we verify what type of change it has un-
dergone: loss of one or both LUs, or loss of the
combination. As the collocation bases are those
elements carrying the bulk of the lexical meaning,
we check different candidates with the same base
(or a very similar one) in those cases where only
the collocate ceased to be used, with a view to
finding examples such as the one referred above
(ponerC miedoB ⇒ darC miedoB). As Section 4.4
will show, other alternatives (e.g., verbs with the
same meaning of the collocations) can also be pro-
posed.

4.2 Resources

In order to analyze the diachrony of collocations,
our system needs historical corpora divided in dif-
ferent periods p1, p2, . . . , pn. Each corpus must
have a CoNLL-like format containing lemmas,
POS-tags and dependency labels. Also, the sys-
tem uses word embeddings models to search for

http://jeseme.org/


74

words with similar distributions. Optionally, it can
take advantage of contemporary resources such
as a dictionary of lemmas and a reference corpus
(e.g., Wikipedia), used to reduce the noise present
in historical corpora.

It is worth noting that in diachronic resources
the same word can be written in different ways,
due to variations in spelling, or because of mor-
phological or phonological changes. For instance,
the above mentioned Spanish word vergüenza
can be found written as berguensa, verguensa,
berguenza, or verguença (among others) in histori-
cal corpora (Vaamonde, 2015). As our objective is
to find phraseological combinations of words, the
system presented in this paper behaves better with
normalized texts, where the lemmas have the same
spelling across the different resources. Neverthe-
less, we take advantage of distributional models
which encode subword information, so they can
effectively tackle rare words present in historical
resources (Bojanowski et al., 2017). In this regard,
Section 5 includes experiments using normalized
corpora (in Portuguese and Spanish) as well as a
non-normalized historical corpus of Portuguese.

4.3 Extraction of collocation candidates
Once we have the analyzed corpora, we extract
head–dependent pairs of the desired syntactic re-
lations in order to identify candidates of colloca-
tions. For example, the verb-object dependency
will extract instances such as ‘eat, sausage’ or
‘take, shower’. These pairs are then ranked using
statistical association measures to identify those
candidates that are more likely to be phraseolog-
ical collocations (Gries, 2013; Carlini et al., 2014;
Evert et al., 2017).

4.4 Diachronic track of collocations
The process of tracking the diachronic evolution
of collocations consists of the following steps:

• Starting from p1, we select the n top colloca-
tions according the defined association mea-
sure and threshold. Optionally, in order to
avoid possible noise in historical corpora, we
select only those collocations whose inter-
nal elements are known (i.e., they appear in
a contemporary dictionary), or have a very
similar distribution (e.g., 0.9 of cosine sim-
ilarity) to known present words.

• We calculate the ratio per period of each col-
location dividing its frequency by the number

of syntactic dependencies with the same rela-
tion (e.g., subject) in the same period.

• Then, for each collocation, we verify whether
it appears in the next more recent period of
the corpus (or ideally, in the reference one).
If the collocation is not currently used:

1. We traverse each period p1+i to identify
when the collocation ceased to be used.

2. Then, we analyze the type of change:
(type 1) both the base and the collocate
are not used anymore in the corpus; (2)
the base, or (3) the collocate do not ap-
pear in further periods; (4) both LUs still
occur, but the combination ceased to ex-
ist. In types 1 and 2 we use the dis-
tributional model to search for replace-
ments for the base (for both types) and
of the collocate (only for type 1). Us-
ing these candidates, we select further
collocations whose base and collocate
have cosine similarities greater than two
given thresholds (base simil and collo-
cate simil). In those cases where the
base still appears in phraseological com-
binations (change 3, and eventually 4),
we search for other combinations with
the same base to find new collocates
with the same lexical function.
In verb-object collocations (e.g., hacer
venganza or tomar vingança, ‘take re-
venge’ in Old Spanish and Portuguese)
we also search (i) for verbs which con-
vey the same meaning (e.g., vingar, ‘re-
venge’ in Portuguese), also using the
word embeddings model, as well as (ii)
for collocations with support verb con-
structions (dar venganza, ‘take revenge’
in Modern Spanish).

• If the collocation is still used in further his-
torical periods, we obtain its frequency trend
using the ratios of each period. This analy-
sis classifies the trend of a collocation as in-
crease, decrease or stable (types 5, 6, and 7,
respectively).

Thus, the output of our system contains, for
each collocation in the corpus (a) the period when
it started to appear, (b) the type of change it un-
dergone (if any), and the time when it happened,



75

as well as (c) the frequency trend of those col-
locations which have not suffered lexical varia-
tions. Additionally, for some combinations, it
shows other expressions (collocations and eventu-
ally verbs) which could be replacements for those
collocations which ceased to be used.

5 Experiments

5.1 Data

To verify the usefulness of the proposed method
for automatically finding changes on collocations,
we carried out a case study on two historical cor-
pora of Portuguese and Spanish (with 648k and
808k tokens of private letters, respectively) from
the P.S. Post Scriptum project (CLUL, 2014; Vaa-
monde, 2015).

Both resources are divided into centuries, from
the 16th to the 19th century, and include ver-
sions with normalized spelling. We used the
provided tokens and lemmas, and applied two
NLP pipelines to POS-tag (LinguaKit, Garcia and
Gamallo (2015)) and parse (UDPipe, Straka and
Straková (2017)) the corpora using Universal De-
pendencies 2.3 (Nivre et al., 2018). As contempo-
rary resources of Portuguese and Spanish, we used
the dictionaries included in LinguaKit, and recent
versions of Portuguese and Spanish Wikipedia
(November, 2018) processed using the same tools
as the corpora.

For computing the distributional similarity we
trained fastText embeddings (Bojanowski et al.,
2017) with mixed historical and present corpora,
of about 250M for each language. For Span-
ish, we used cuentos españoles and romances
españoles;3 for Portuguese, we combined the
Colonia historical corpus (Zampieri and Becker,
2013) with a collection of novels from XIX cen-
tury.4 Apart from that, we randomly selected sen-
tences containing about 200M tokens from the
Wikipedia version of each language. These dis-
tributional models were also used as pre-trained
word embeddings to train the UDPipe parsers
which analyzed the corpora. Ideally, we could
train different distributional models for each time
period, but we decided to use a single model with
data from different epochs due to the lack of large
resources for historical Portuguese and Spanish.

tree/master/spanish

4https://github.com/cligs/
romancesportugueses

For both languages we restricted the analy-
ses to verb-object collocations, and we used log-
likelihood as the association measure (Uhrig et al.,
2018). Moreover, as we deal with historical cor-
pora, we defined a high-coverage approach by se-
lecting candidates with a low log-likelihood value
(>=2.5), and also other very frequent combina-
tions (with a empirically defined ratio per cen-
tury equal or greater than 0.18). The thresholds
base simil and collocate simil were defined to 0.9
and 0.7, respectively.

It is worth mentioning that, since, to our knowl-
edge, there is no gold-standard data on collocation
diachronic variation, we cannot carry out a sys-
tematic analysis of our approach. Thus, we per-
formed a preliminary evaluation aimed at having
an overview of the precision of the system and
knowing how it could help to automatize the work
of historical linguists.

5.2 Results

First, we present some quantitative results ob-
tained by evaluating a random set of the output in
Portuguese and Spanish. Then, we discuss the out-
come from a qualitative perspective, carrying out
a brief analysis using a historical linguistics point
of view. Finally, we also show some results of our
system using a non-normalized diachronic corpus
in Portuguese.

Quantitative analysis: Summing up the data of
the five centuries, the system identified 1, 932 and
1, 980 changes of types 1 through 4 in Spanish and
Portuguese, respectively. Most of these combina-
tions (about 90%) were of type 4, due to the use of
contemporary resources to restrict the analysis of
unknown words. Besides, it extracted the histori-
cal trends (changes 5 to 7) of 3, 129 (Spanish) and
2, 210 (Portuguese) combinations.

To perform the quantitative evaluation we ran-
domly selected the output of 100 collocations of
types 1 to 4 for each language (we did not evalu-
ated the results of types 5, 6, and 7, since they are
obtained from the observed frequencies of the col-
locations). From this sample, we removed those
combinations which were not proper collocation
candidates due to parsing errors (e.g., the Span-
ish llevar plus [el] alférez –literally ‘to take’ plus
‘the sub-lieutenant’— was incorrectly labeled as
an object relation instead of subject), totaling 32%
in Spanish, and 39% in Portuguese (see Table 1).
Note that these values refer to parsing errors in

Evaluation Span. Port. Average
Prec Alt 47.1% 56.8% 52.1%
Prec Dia 62.5% 73.8% 68.8%
Parsing errors 32.4% 39.0% 36.3%

Table 1: Results of the quantitative evaluations in Span-
ish and Portuguese. Prec Alt is the precision of the pro-
posed alternatives, while Prec Dia is the overall preci-
sion of the system. Parsing errors include those source
combinations (not the target ones) which were wrongly
analyzed by the parser. Average is micro-average.

the source combinations (those which suffered a
change), not in the collocations proposed as alter-
natives for each variation type.

Then, we evaluated the output of each collo-
cation as follows. For those collocations where
the system did not give any alternative, we looked
for other examples with the same meaning in the
lists of collocations (false negatives). In those
cases where the system provides alternatives, we
checked whether these results have approximately
the same meaning (e.g., dar [um] alegrão→ ale-
grar, ‘make happy’ in Portuguese). We considered
correct (i) the nonexistence of newer collocations
with similar meanings (in the first case) as well
as (ii) the identification of proper alternatives (in
the second). Otherwise, the output was considered
incorrect. Then, we carried out an error analysis
aimed at knowing into more detail what types of
error produced our method (see Section 5.3 be-
low).

We computed two precision values for each lan-
guage (Table 1). On one hand, Prec Alt evalu-
ates the quality of the proposed alternatives by
dividing the number of correct cases by the total
number of collocations with alternatives (so this
value ignores those cases where the system did not
found expressions with similar meanings). On the
other hand, Prec Dia performs an overall evalu-
ation of the system by taking into account these
cases where it did not provide alternatives (correct
cases divided by all the analyzed cases).

The results in Table 1 show that the perfor-
mance of the system was better in Portuguese,
even if this language had a large number of parsing
errors. The two evaluation approaches had a sim-
ilar behaviour in both languages (with differences
of 15.4% in Spanish and of 17% in Portuguese).

It is worth mentioning that as our method is not
a fully automatic system to identify the changes,
but rather a tool for identifying potential variations

to assist historical linguists, a qualitative evalua-
tion is probably more appropriate than a quantita-
tive one. Thus, qualitative analyses in both lan-
guages were carried out in order to know the use-
fulness of the system.

Qualitative analysis: As pointed out, changes
of type 4 are the most frequently observed in both
Spanish and Portuguese processing of the P.S. Post
Scriptum corpora. In this regard, a manual revi-
sion is in order to evaluate the linguistic interest
of these data. Thus, for instance, some of these
results point to bona fide cases of collocational
changes. That is the case of Portuguese deitar
missa (lit. ‘lay, mass’, ‘say a mass’, lost in the
16th century) and botar [uma] bênção (lit. ‘throw
a blessing’, ‘give a blessing’, until 18th c.) and
Spanish prestar paciencia and aprestar paciencia
(both meaning ‘have patience’).

In our setting, changes of type 1 are the less
common, since we decided to analyze only those
words which are present in further centuries or in
present dictionaries. However, the system found
some intriguing cases of type 1 (i.e., both words of
the collocation do not appear in later periods of the
corpus —but they still appear in current dictionar-
ies), such as the Portuguese obtundir acrimónia
(‘lessen the curtness’, lost in the 18th c.). Curi-
ously enough, the historical Corpus do Português
(Davies and Ferreira, 2006)5 does not have any oc-
currence of the verb obtundir, and only 18 cases of
acrimónia.

The Portuguese data also offers interesting
cases of base loss such as furtar [o] bisalho (‘steal
a bag’) and perdoar [o] enfadamento (‘forgive
an annoyance’). Regarding the latter, the system
correctly proposes the alternative perdoar [o] en-
fado. Besides, it also identified the loss of the verb
arrenegar (‘to abjure’, with a frequency of 3 in
the Corpus do Português), present until the 18th
in combination with bases such as demónio (‘de-
mon’) or diabrura (‘deviltry’), as examples of type
3 (collocate loss).

In Spanish, instances of change 2 (base loss)
correspond to either very infrequent (réprobo
‘reprobate’, requisitorio ‘requisition’) or archaic
nouns (malhecho ‘misdeed’). An interesting case
of collocate loss (type 3) is the verb desenojar ‘to
appease’, which the system indicates that disap-
pears in the 18th century. In the corpus of the
Nuevo diccionario histórico del español (hence-

forth CDH), a larger diachronic corpus of Spanish
accessible only through a web interface (Instituto
de Investigación Rafael Lapesa, 2013), this verb
is mostly attested before 1700. Afterwards, in the
18th century its frequency decreases almost by a
half (from 2.59 to 1.58 occurrences per million
words, opmw), and continues to decrease steeply
in later periods.

Amongst the changes of type 4, one finds the
most relevant cases from a dichronic perspective.
In the case of aprestar|prestar paciencia the
system identifies its loss around the 18th century
and correctly predicts its substitution for the nowa-
days more common light-verb construction tener
paciencia (‘have patience’). In the larger CDH,
prestar paciencia goes from 0.7 opmw in the 16th
and 17th centuries to less than half (0.32) in the
18th c. and keeps decreasing. By the 20th century
it seems almost extinct with only one occurrence
in 1933.

A similar case is meter paz ‘to put peace’, the
last attestations of which are dated by the system
in the 16th century in favor of poner paz. The loss
of this collocation, however, has greater implica-
tions, since a broader semantic change affecting
the verb meter could be at play here. Corominas
and Pascual (1996) (s.v. meter) point out that that
the meanings of meter and poner (‘to put’) were
more or less interchangeable in medieval Spanish.
Nowadays, however, poner conveys the meaning
‘change of position’ and describes non-durative
changes (achievements), whereas meter has a di-
rectional component and a durative interpretation
(accomplishment), according to Cifuentes Hon-
rubia (2004).

Results in a non-normalized corpus: Besides
the previous experiments, we also carried out a
test in a non-normalized and larger historical cor-
pus of Portuguese, Colónia, with 6.2M tokens of
essays from 16th to 20th centuries (Zampieri and
Becker, 2013).6 We analyzed combinations with a
frequency equal or greater than 2 in the first time
period in which it appeared, and used the same as-
sociation measures and parameters as in the previ-
ous experiments.

In this case the system classified 2, 622 changes
of types 1 to 4, in which a brief analysis allowed
us to identify interesting variations in historical
collocational preferences in Portuguese. For in-
stance, examples of type 1 such as desafivelar gor-

jal (‘unfasten, gorjet’, lost in the 19th century), of
type 2 such as fazer soı́do (‘make sound’ or ‘make
noise’, where soı́do is currently replaced by som)
or corromper [a] pudicı́cia (lit. ‘to corrupt the
shyness’) in the 18th and 19th centuries, respec-
tively. Among the observed cases of type 3 there
are interesting verb losses (or at least decreases in
use) in cases such as descantar [o] louvor (‘sing
praises’) or manear [a] arma (‘handle a weapon’),
currently less used than the collocates cantar and
manejar, respectively.

In this analysis, the system also proposed cor-
rect alternatives to changes of type 4, including
the collocation tomar aposento (‘to lodge’) or the
verb carregar (‘to carry’), from fazer aposento
and fazer [a] carregação, respectively.

In sum, this analysis allowed us to verify the
usefulness of the proposed method to rapidly
identify the target language changes also in non-
normalized corpus such as the Colónia. It is worth
recalling that, depending on the corpus properties
and on the objectives of the research, the param-
eters of the system can be configured to suit the
needs of the analysis.

5.3 Error analysis

In order to know in more detail the type of errors
produced by our method we carried out an error
analysis of each of the incorrect outputs of the
quantitative evaluation. The errors were classified
in the following three types, presented by their fre-
quency (see Table 2 for the quantitative results):

1. Different sense of the collocates: the most
common error type was the suggestion of a
collocate with a different sense in those cases
where the base still appears in the corpus, but
in other combinations. For instance, the sys-
tem proposed the combination dar dilación
(literally ‘to give a delay’) as a replacement
for the Spanish sentir dilación (‘to regret a
delay’). In Portuguese, fazer recado (‘to do
an errand’) was suggested as a substitution of
esperar recado (‘to wait for an errand’).

2. Different sense of the verbs: another fre-
quent error, similar to the previous one, was
the suggestion of single-word verb equiva-
lents for collocations with different mean-
ings. In Portuguese, encomendar (‘to order’)
was proposed to replace tomar encomenda
(‘to take an order’), while desacatar (‘to

Error type Span. Port. Average
Collocate sense 50.0% 75.0% 61.8%
Verb sense 38.9% 18.8% 29.4%
Parsing 11.1% 6.3% 8.8%

Table 2: Quantitative results of the error analysis per
language. Average is micro average.

disobey’) was the first suggestion for the
Spanish causar desacato (‘to cause disobe-
dience’).

3. Parsing: a less frequent error type was pro-
duced by incorrect annotations of the depen-
dency parser. As an example, ver auditor (‘to
see an auditor’, in Spanish) was analyzed as a
verb-object relation instead of a subject-verb
(‘the auditor saw [. . . ]’).

Error types 1 and 2 were mainly produced due
to our distributional semantics approach; as col-
locates have a particular meaning depending on
the base they go with, standard distributional se-
mantics models often fail to capture these spe-
cific senses. To avoid these problems, both non-
compositional methods (e.g., representing the col-
locations as multiword units in the distributional
models), or contextualized compositional strate-
gies (which combine the vectors of the elements or
their most prominent contexts) could be applied.

6 Conclusions and further work

In this paper we presented a system aimed at fa-
cilitating the diachronic detection of collocational
variation. The method takes advantage of depen-
dency parsing and of statistical association mea-
sures, together with a base–collocate approach,
to find candidates of phraseological combinations.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ap-
proach focused on the automatic identification of
collocational changes in different languages.

For each collocation in the corpus, the system
identifies the period it starts to appear and veri-
fies whether it continues to be used. Those com-
binations which ceased to occur in later histori-
cal periods are analyzed in order to infer whether
simple lexical substitutions have happened, or if
the lexical restrictions of a collocation base have
shifted. Also, the strategy takes advantage of dis-
tributional semantics methods to propose alterna-
tives for those combinations which ceased to be
used.

A case study on Portuguese and Spanish histor-
ical corpora shows that the system is useful both to
speed up the finding of collocation changes as well
as to detect phraseological and semantic variation
in diachronic resources. In this regard, some in-
teresting collocational and semantic changes have
been pointed out based on a qualitative analysis of
the results. It is worth mentioning that, even if the
system is better suited for normalized historical
corpora, the performed evaluations showed that it
works reasonably well also in non-normalized re-
sources. However, further research is needed to
reduce the parsing errors in both normalized and
non-normalized historical corpora.

Based on an error analysis, in future work
we plan to improve the preprocessing with NLP
tools adapted for non-normalized corpora as well
as with more balanced word embeddings models
trained on historical resources. Another future
line of research could be the use of contextualized
models of distributional semantics able to infer
different senses of a word by the contexts where
it appears. Finally, it would be interesting to em-
bed the system in a visualization tool to support
research in historical linguistics and in digital hu-
manities.
