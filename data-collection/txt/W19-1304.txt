Abstract

Adjective phrases like “a little bit surprised”,
“completely shocked”, or “not stunned at all”
are not handled properly by currently pub-
lished state-of-the-art emotion classification
and intensity prediction systems which use pre-
dominantly non-contextualized word embed-
dings as input. Based on this finding, we ana-
lyze differences between embeddings used by
these systems in regard to their capability of
handling such cases. Furthermore, we argue
that intensifiers in context of emotion words
need special treatment, as is established for
sentiment polarity classification, but not for
more fine-grained emotion prediction. To re-
solve this issue, we analyze different aspects
of a post-processing pipeline which enriches
the word representations of such phrases. This
includes expansion of semantic spaces at the
phrase level and sub-word level followed by
retrofitting to emotion lexica. We evaluate the
impact of these steps with À La Carte and Bag-
of-Substrings extensions based on pretrained
GloVe, Word2vec, and fastText embeddings
against a crowd-sourced corpus of intensity
annotations for tweets containing our focus
phrases. We show that the fastText-based mod-
els do not gain from handling these specific
phrases under inspection. For Word2vec em-
beddings, we show that our post-processing
pipeline improves the results by up to 8% on
a novel dataset densely populated with intensi-
fiers.

1 Introduction

Emotion detection in text includes tasks of mapping
words, sentences, and documents to a discrete set
of emotions following a psychological model such
as those proposed by Ekman (1992) and Plutchik
(1980), or to intensity scores or continuous val-
ues of valence–arousal–dominance (Posner et al.,
2005). The shared task on intensity prediction for

discrete classes proposed to combine both (Moham-
mad et al., 2018; Mohammad and Bravo-Marquez,
2017a). In this task a tweet and an emotion are
given and the goal is to determine an intensity score
between 0 and 1.

Especially, but not only in social media, users
use degree adverbs (also called intensifiers Quirk,
1985), for instance in “I am kinda happy” vs. “I am
very happy.” to express different levels of emotion
intensity. This is a relevant task: 10% of tweets con-
taining an emotion word are modified with such an
adverb in the corpus we describe in Section 3.1. In
this paper, we challenge the assumption that models
developed for intensity prediction perform well on
tweets containing such phrases and analyze which
of the established embedding methods Word2vec
(Mikolov et al., 2013), GloVe (Pennington et al.,
2014), and fastText embeddings (Bojanowski et al.,
2017) performs well when predicting intensities for
tweets containing such phrases. We will see that
the performance of the popular and fast-to-train
Word2vec method can be increased with a simple
postprocessing pipeline which we present in this
paper.

As a motivating example, the DeepMoji model
(Felbo et al., 2017) predicts anger for both the
example sentences “I am not angry.” and “I am
angry.”1. Using the model by Wu et al. (2018)
(one of the state-of-the-art intensity prediction mod-
els from Mohammad et al. (2018), building their
model on top of Word2vec embeddings) we also
obtain anger as having the highest intensity for
both examples. We argue that the models should be
more sensitive to the difference between negations,
downtoners and amplifiers.

With this paper, we contribute to alleviate this
situation in three aspects. Firstly, we provide an
analysis of the distribution of degree adverbs (in-

26

cluding negations) with emotion words and show
that not all such combinations are equally common.
Secondly, we perform a crowdsourcing experiment
in which we collect scores for different combina-
tions of degree adverbs and emotion adjectives. We
use these data, which we make publicly available,
as an additional challenging test set for the task of
intensity prediction for English. Thirdly, we use
a state-of-the-art intensity prediction model (Wu
et al., 2018) on this test set and evaluate two meth-
ods to improve these predictions, namely the inclu-
sion (Zhao et al., 2018) and n-gram embeddings
via À La Carte of additional subword information
with Bag-of-Substrings (Khodak et al., 2018). We
evaluate based on Word2vec, GloVe and fastText
embeddings and show that particularly the first two
benefit from these changes, but to different extents.

2 Related Work

2.1 Degree Adverbs in Linguistics
Adverbs that express intensity are named degree
adverbs, degree modifiers or intensifiers.2 The
entities they intensify are located on an abstract
scale of intensity (Quirk, 1985). The intensifiers
that scale upward are named amplifiers and are
further categorised as maximizers, such as “com-
pletely” and “totally” or boosters, such as “really”
or “truly”. Those that scale downward are called
downtoners and are further classified as approxima-
tors, such as “almost” or “kind of”, compromisers,
such as “fairly”, “pretty” and “quite”, diminish-
ers, such as “slightly” and “a bit”, and minimizers
(Quirk, 1985; Paradis, 1997; Nevalainen and Ris-
sanen, 2002, i. a.). Further distinction of degree
modifiers is concerned with the fact that there are
intensifiers that imply boundaries, such as “totally”,
“fully”, and “completely” and those that do not,
such as “very”, “utterly”, “pretty” (Paradis, 1997,
2001, 2000). Finally, in the context of discourse,
there is the property of expressing focus, which is
present in the so-called focus modifiers, such as
“only” and “just”, which are also further classified
in additives, such as “also” and “too” and restric-
tives, such as “only” and “merely” (Quirk, 1985;
Athanasiadou, 2007).

English degree modifiers have also long history
of research in English studies and more generally
in Language Studies. Most English studies focus
on the incidence and distribution of these adverbs
in different corpora, e.g. Peters (1994) study letters

2In this paper, we will use these terms interchangeably.

from Early Modern English and shows the how
the distributions of boosters change across time.
Nevalainen (2008) study the social variation in in-
tensifier use, with a focus on the suffix -ly. More
recently, Napoli and Ravetto (2017) collect a vol-
ume of papers that explore the process of intensi-
fication following a corpus-based, cross-linguistic
and contrastive approach. The volume contains
various works on the variation in the distribution
and incidence of the intensifiers based on sociolin-
guistic features and in a diachronic fashion. The
work brings in attention intensification in ancient
languages as well as modern languages.

A more recent work investigates the differences
in the use of intensifiers and considers English
speech of adults and teenagers as corpus. It ex-
plores two maximizers in-depth, namely “abso-
lutely” and “totally” and shows that those prove
to be more “flexible“ in the language used by
teenagers (Pertejo and Martı́nez, 2014).

2.2 Modifiers in the context of Sentiment and
Emotion Analysis

In the context of sentiment analysis the discussion
of intensifiers and negations has gained quite some
attention, since those are primarily markers of sub-
jectivity (Athanasiadou, 2007).

Negations, and in particular negation cue detec-
tion (with the goal of scope recognition) have been
the research interest of Councill et al. (2010) and
Reitan et al. (2015), who use a lexicon for nega-
tion cue detection and a linear-chain conditional
random field for scope recognition. In the area of
distributional semantics, the investigation of word
vectors with a focus on negated adjectives (Aina
et al., 2018) is complementary to our work with re-
gards to negation in terms of the methods and data
used. Following this approach, one could build a
distributional semantic model whose vocabulary
includes the modified phrases. In practice, each oc-
currence of a modified adjective by a degree adverb
could be treated as a single token (e. g. “not happy”
would be represented as “not happy”). For a gen-
eral overview of modality and negation in compu-
tational linguistics we refer the interested reader to
the work by Morante and Sporleder (2012).

Furthermore, Zhu et al. (2014) study the effect of
negation words on sentiment and evaluate a neural
composition model. Kiritchenko and Mohammad
(2016a) create a sentiment lexicon of phrases that
include modifiers such as negators, modals, and



27

degree adverbs. The phrases and their constituent
words are annotated manually with the same an-
notation procedure we will discuss in detail. We
follow this work closely and apply the same proce-
dures in the context of emotion analysis.

Dragut and Fellbaum (2014) study the effect of
intensifiers on the sentiment ratings and shows that
the degree adverbs do not carry an inherent senti-
ment polarity but alter the degree of the polarity of
the constituents they modify.

We argue that there is not enough work on trans-
ferring the methods used in sentiment analysis to
the more fine-grained analysis of emotions, except
for Strohm and Klinger (2018), who limit them-
selves to analysis and do not apply state-of-the-art
prediction models for handling degree adverbs, and
Carrillo-de Albornoz and Plaza (2013) who con-
sider modified emotions but predict sentiment.

3 Methods

In the following, we explain how we create the data
sets for our analysis (Section 3.1) and then how we
set up the experiments to measure the impact of À
La Carte and Bag-of-Substrings on the modified
phrases (Section 3.2).

3.1 Data Collection and Annotation

As a basis of our work, we create a compositional
emotion lexicon for English Twitter and retrieve
crowdsourced ratings using Best-Worst Scaling
(Louviere et al., 2015; Kiritchenko and Moham-
mad, 2016b). We show later that these ratings are
by and large independent of context and can there-
fore be interpreted as a labeled emotion lexicon of
compositional phrases.3

3.1.1 Data Collection
Each query we use to retrieve tweets consists of
a pair of an adjective with one or a combination
of several degree adverbs (intensifiers (including
amplifiers and downtoners) and negations), for in-
stance “not at all surprised” or “not very happy”.
We first generate a comprehensive list by map-
ping each of Ekman’s fundamental emotions (Ek-
man, 1992) to their corresponding adjective sad,
happy, disgusted, afraid, surprised, angry and aug-
ment this list to 333 emotion adjectives and their
synonyms from the Oxford Dictionary of English

3Our data is available at https://www.ims.
uni-stuttgart.de/data/modifieremotion.

(Ehrlich, 1980), the New Oxford American Dictio-
nary (Stevenson and Lindberg, 2010) and Macmil-
lan Online English Dictionary4 and further filter
this list to 43 entries which are intersubjectively
agreeable. This filter step is performed via crowd-
sourcing on Prolific5, in which we asked native
speakers of English which emotion is the closest
to each synonym. We only keep those synonyms
where all annotators agreed. The inter-annotator
agreement is  = 0.63 (Fleiss’  over 9 annota-
tors).

The list of degree modifiers is a combination of
Quirk (1985); Paradis (1997); Strohm and Klinger
(2018). From the cartesian product of degree modi-
fiers with emotion adjectives, we keep those which
we find at least 10 times in the general Twitter cor-
pus we discuss below. That leads to 266 phrases.

We base our analysis on a set of 32 million
tweets obtained from Twitter with the official API
between March 2006 and October 2018, using a
combination of diverse search terms corresponding
to isolated emotion word synonyms, those in com-
bination with degree adverbs, and frequent hash-
tags. We filter out retweets and full quotes, tweets
with more than 140 characters and those with less
than 10 tokens, as well as those consisting of more
than 30% hashtags, links, or usernames, which
we replace by generic respective tokens otherwise.
Tweets with more than 30% of non-ASCII charac-
ters are also removed.

3.1.2 Annotation Procedure
For each tweet (t) and emotion (e) we obtain emo-
tion intensity scores st,e 2 [�1, 1] via Best-Worst
Scaling (BWS, Louviere et al., 2015). In general
with BWS, the annotators are shown a subset of a
number of items from a list and are asked to select
the best and worst items (or most and least some
given property of interest). Within our study, we
show four items at once to the annotators. In a first
setting, we show them four tweets that contain the
queries we want to have scores assigned for. In
a second setting, we show them only the queries
without the context (the tweet) in which they were
found. In both scenarios, the annotators need to
select the tweet or the query with the highest and
lowest intensity of each emotion.

These groups of tweets are sampled under
following constraints that have been empirically

proven to lead to reliable scores (Kiritchenko and
Mohammad, 2016c), resulting in 532 samples
(twice the amount of queries): (1) no two sam-
ples have the same four queries (in any order), (2)
no two queries within a sample are identical, (3)
each query occurs in 8 (±1) different samples, (4)
each pair of queries appears in the same number of
samples. We perform two annotation experiments
on the crowdsourcing platform Figure Eight6: In
Experiment 1, we present the whole tweet to the
annotator, in Experiment 2, we only show the query
phrase. This enables us to evaluate the importance
of context, shown in Section 4.2. Each sample was
annotated by three contributors that confirmed to
be English native speakers.

3.2 Adaptations of Embeddings
In the following, we discuss the three methods to
improve the embeddings and later to test if these
improvements add additional information with re-
spect to intensifiers for emotion analysis. The eval-
uation will be on the downstream task of emotion
intensity prediction.

We focus on subword-level information and
phrase-level information, as those, presumably,
capture intensity information.

3.2.1 À La Carte
With this method we learn a representation of yet
unseen phrases within an embedding space through
a linear transformation of the average of the word
embeddings in the feature’s contexts. The method
constructs a representation for a new phrase given
a set of contexts where this phrase occurs in.

Given our Twitter corpus Cw consisting of con-
texts of words w and the pre-trained word embed-
dings vw 2 Rd, of dimension d, our goal is to
construct a representation vq 2 Rd of a query q
given a set Cq of contexts it occurs in.

We learn the transform A 2 Rd⇥d that can re-
cover existing word vectors vw via linear regres-
sion by summing their context embeddings

vw ⇡ A

Using the learned transformation matrix A we can
embed any new query vq in the same semantic
space as the pre-trained word embeddings via

vq = A

3.2.2 Bag-of-Substrings
BoS generalizes pre-trained semantic spaces to un-
seen words. The established approach to represent
word phrases or sentences is to take a bag of words
of word embeddings.

BoS achieves its goal by first learning a mapping
between the subwords present in each word and its
corresponding pre-trained vector. Then, by using
this learned subword transformation, the model is
able to generate new representations for any new
word as a set of its character n-grams. For us this
is relevant, since we can consider our focus phrases
to be character n-grams instead of word n-grams.

Formally, the representation for a word vw from
the lookup table V (which stores the embeddings of
dimension d for each possible substring of length
within a range) is:

vw =
1

|Sw|
X

t2Sw

vt, (3)

where Sw is the set of each possible character n-
grams of length within a given range over w and
vt is the vector in V indexed by t.

The model views the vector of a phrase as the av-
erage vector of all its substrings, which are trained



29

by minimizing the overall mean squared loss be-
tween the generated and given vectors for each
word:

where uw 2 Rd⇥|W | are the target vectors of the
dimension d over the vocabulary W and l(v,u) =

2 .

After training, similarly to the previous method,
one can use the learned space to generate a new
word vector vq as the average of the vectors of all
of its substrings through Equation 3.

Since BoS produces vectors for unknown words
from vectors of substrings of characters contained
in it, this allows to build vectors for misspelled
words and concatenation of words. Particularly
on Twitter data, we benefit from getting a repre-
sentation for phrases like “sooooexcited:)”, “verrry
cheerful”, “soo unhappy:(”. Relevant for our analy-
sis is that BoS uses special characters to mark the
start and the end of the word and thus helps the
model to distinguish morphemes that occur at dif-
ferent word parts, like prefixes or suffixes. Through
that we learn to distinguish morphemes like “un-”,
“-er” and “-est” that are part of our focus phrases.

Note that this method uses the same idea as in
fastText (Bojanowski et al., 2017), but is for our
case computationally more efficient, since the BoS
model is trained directly on top of pre-trained vec-
tors, instead of predicting over text corpora.

3.2.3 Retrofitting
We use the method of retrofitting existing embed-
dings (Faruqui et al., 2015) in order to enrich word
vectors using synonymity constraints provided by
semantic lexicons. The algorithm learns the word
embedding matrix A = {v1,v2, . . . ,vn} with the
objective function:

 (A) =
X

i2V
[↵i||vi�v̂i||2+

X

(i,j)2E

�ij ||v̂i�v̂j ||2]

(5)
where an original word vector is vi, its synonym
vector is vj , and inferred word vector is v̂i.

Our lexicon of synonymity constraints was au-
tomatically constructed from the data we collected
in Section 3.1.1 by adding an entry for each emo-
tion adjective with its synonyms crowdsourced as
previously described. We also added entries for

Table 1: Example queries with their BWS crowd-
sourced scores for the modifiers “so”, “kinda” and the
negation “not”. For every focus phrase we have an
intensity score between �1 and +1 for each emotion.
The focus phrases are shown in groups made around
the emotion adjectives.

the phrases in the lexicon for retrofitting, as fol-
lows, for each emotion phrase according to the
intensifiers classification described in Section 2.1.
For instance, “not happy” had as an entry in the
lexicon the phrases “unhappy” and “not happy at
all” while “completely cheerful” had in its entry
phrases like “totally cheerful”, “totally happy”,
“completely happy”, among others (since “com-
pletely” and “totally” are in the same class). We
apply retrofitting on phrases which origin from the
extension of the space with À La Carte.

4 Results

In the following, we explore the Twitter corpus
described previously, the results of the BWS anno-
tation of the pairs of degree adverbs and adjectives,
and finally we discuss our experimental setting and
evaluation on the downstream task of emotion in-
tensity prediction on the different embedding adap-
tation methods.

4.1 Corpus Analysis

The Twitter corpus described in Section 3.1 con-
tains 34,297,941 tweets out of which 2,948,397
contain emotion phrases. Most dominant are am-



30

plifiers (49%) followed by downtoners (24%) and
negations (19%). Only 8% contain the emotion
adjectives in superlative or comparative.

Figure 2 shows how often the top 30 modifiers
are used with adjectives from the basic set of emo-
tions. We see that disgust is rarely downtoned and
anger, sadness, and surprise are amplified most
often. Joy and fear are relatively equally amplified,
with joy being more negated and fear being more
downtoned. The amplifiers “so” and “really”, as
well as the downtoners “just” and “kind of/kinda”
are frequently used. The downtoner “just” is the
most frequently used downtoner and acts at times
as an amplifier, which could explain its frequent
use. We hypothesize that this is due to their use
as fillers and their grammaticalization (cf. Taglia-
monte, 2006). Most frequently downtoned emotion
is surprise (which is often used in phrases like “a lit-
tle surprised”, “quite surprised”, “a bit surprised”).

In Figure 3 and Figure 4 we observe that the
use of modifiers with respect to an emotion vary a
lot within the same class of modifiers among both
more frequent and less frequent modifiers. In Fig-
ure 3, we observe that the focus modifier “only”
scales downward surprise the least, while all the
other “true” scaling adverbs are more impactful.
Sadness is the emotion that is mostly expressed
through the focus adverb “only” in this setting. The
figure also (implicitly) shows that certain modifiers
prefer certain adjectives, e.g. the adjectives that
express disgust, such as “disgusted” is mostly mod-
ified by “absolutely”, “truly”, “utterly”, “pretty”
and not by “extremely”, “incredibly” or “only”.
This distinction show the “harmony” between ad-
jectives and degree adverbs (Quirk, 1985).

Looking in more depth into the most frequent
used amplifiers and downtoners in Figure 4 we see
that among the top used amplifiers “so”, “really”,
“very” we find that joy, anger, and disgust prefer
“so” over “really” and “very”, the emotions fear
and surprise prefer “very” over “so” and “really”
and sadness is modified rather equally by the three
amplifiers. Between the downtoners “kind of” and
“kinda” there is a notable difference in use for sad-
ness, fear and anger, with “kind of” being prefered
over “kinda” in the context of sadness, with the
opposite holding true for fear.

4.2 Annotation Analysis

Table 1 shows examples of phrases annotated with
real-valued scores following the annotation pro-

Spearman’s rank correlation

cedure described in Section 3.1. We see that we
have scores for each phrase in the context of each
emotion. For instance, “kinda surprised” has the
score �.37 for sadness and +.17. We observe that
the negation “not” paired with any emotion adjec-
tive, excluding happy obtains a positive score for
joy, and a negative score for every other emotion.
The phrase “not happy” obtains a negative score
of only �.52. In the complete annotation results
we include as negations also the phrase “not happy
at all”, which in this case gets closer to the lower
limit of the potential scores.

We measure the reliability by randomly dividing
the sets of 4 responses to each question into two
halves and comparing the Spearman rank correla-
tion coefficient between the two sets (Kiritchenko
and Mohammad, 2016b). Both with and without
having access to context, the annotators mostly
agree regarding their annotations, as Table 2 shows
in the first two columns. Lowest reliability is
achieved for surprise, with .71 Spearman’s rank
correlation and the highest for joy and sadness (.9).
The reliability drops most when context is not avail-
able for fear (by 11 percentage points).

Figure 5 shows the distribution of the scores
assigned through the annotation per emotion. We
observe that disgust is mostly amplified and rarely
negated (only once). The outliers in each boxplot
mostly correspond to negated phrases.

4.3 Embedding Adaptations

build on top of pretrained embeddings obtained
with Word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) (300d, neg-
ative sampling, Google News corpus), fastText

The fastText-based models underperform con-
stantly on our Twitter dataset. For GloVe embed-
dings, À La Carte (ALC) and Bag-of-Substrings
(BoS) lead to a substantial improvement, of 7pp
(see Table 3, G vs. G+ALC) and 8pp (G vs. G+BoS)
over the baseline of using the pretrained embed-
dings unchanged. On Word2vec embeddings BoS
and ALC show the same improvement of 7pp
(W2V vs. W2V+ALC/BoS).

While on average, ALC and BoS can only sub-
stantially contribute based on GloVe and Word2vec,
this is not the case for individual emotions. For
Word2vec, sadness figures to be particularly chal-
lenging, leading to an overall comparably low per-
formance. Most importantly, we observe that our
extensions of the semantic spaces do not negatively
affect the results on the EmoInt dataset.

Unexpectedly, retrofitting does not help in all
settings in our post-processing pipeline except for

quence of using a too small lexicon for retrofitting,
and the method would improve the embeddings
if sentiment or emotion lexicons would be used
instead. However, this needs further investigation.

5 Conclusion & Future Work

With this paper, we presented the first analysis of
the distribution of degree adverbs and negations on
Twitter in the context of emotions. In addition, we
proposed a pipeline with different modules to ex-
pand embeddings particularly for emotion phrases.
Our evaluation shows substantial differences based
on the combination of input embeddings and the
postprocessing method. Our pipeline improves the
results obtained while evaluating the downstream
task of emotion intensity prediction on our dataset.
Finally, we contribute a novel emotion phrase lexi-
con of high precision.

For future work we propose to analyze other
baseline approaches, particularly learning a compo-
sition function over pairs of adjectives with degree
adverbs. The modifiers could be considered as
functions over adjectives and would be represented
as matrices.

Another further improvement of this work would
be to expand this analysis to verbal and nominal
expressions of emotion, which we hypothesize as
also being frequent. In order to obtain meaning-
ful representations for the phrases we focus on,
another natural next step is expanding the post-
processing pipeline and including a comparison
to other adaptation methods such as counterfitting

(Mrkšić et al., 2016). Presumably, this will also
generate additional insights into the aspect that
we were only able to show a limited improvement
based on retrofitting.

Given the recent advances in representing con-
textualized word embeddings as functions comput-
ing dynamically the embeddings for words given
their context, we hypothesize and intend to fur-
ther verify that these embeddings would be a better
choice for input to systems that predict intensity
scores. It would be interesting to compare models
such as word embeddings from language models
(Elmo) (Peters et al., 2018), bidirectional encoder
representations from transformers (BERT) (Devlin
et al., 2018), and generative pre-training OpenAI
(GPT) (Radford et al., 2019) to the ones we already
discussed, since the contextualized embeddings as-
sign a different vector for a word in each given
context. These approaches presumably produce a
different vector for “happy” in the context of “not”
than in the content of “very” or “completely”.

Lastly, we plan to also adjust the lexica created
such that it covers more domains, sources, and
languages.
