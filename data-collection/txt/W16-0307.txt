Abstract

Online social media, such as Reddit, has
become an important resource to share
personal experiences and communicate
with others. Among other personal
information, some social media users
communicate about mental health
problems they are experiencing, with
the intention of getting advice, support
or empathy from other users. Here,
we investigate the language of Reddit
posts specific to mental health, to define
linguistic characteristics that could be
helpful for further applications. The
latter include attempting to identify
posts that need urgent attention due to
their nature, e.g. when someone an-
nounces their intentions of ending their
life by suicide or harming others. Our
results show that there are a variety of
linguistic features that are discriminative
across mental health user communities
and that can be further exploited in
subsequent classification tasks. Fur-
thermore, while negative sentiment
is almost uniformly expressed across
the entire data set, we demonstrate
that there are also condition-specific
vocabularies used in social media
to communicate about particular
disorders. Source code and related ma-
terials are available from: https:

1 Introduction

Mental illnesses are estimated to account for 11%
to 27% of the disability burden in Europe (Wykes
et al., 2015) and mental and substance use disorders
are the leading cause of years lived with disability
worldwide (Whiteford et al., 2013). Our knowledge
about these mental health problems is still more lim-
ited than for many physical conditions, as sufferers
may relapse even after successful treatment or ex-
hibit resistance to different treatments. Most men-
tal health conditions begin early, disrupt education
(Kessler et al., 1995) and may persist over a life-
time, causing disability when those affected would
normally be at their most productive (Kessler and
Frank, 1997). For example, Patel and Knapp (1997)
estimated the aggregate costs of all mental disor-
ders in the United Kingdom at 32 billion (1996/97
prices), 45% of which was due to lost productivity
(Patel and Knapp, 1997). The global burden of men-
tal and substance use disorders increased by 376%
between 1990 and 2010 (Whiteford et al., 2013)
which means it is an international public health pri-
ority to effectively prevent and treat mental health
issues.

In the UK, 17% of adults experience a sub-
threshold common mental disorder (McManus et
al., 2009) and up to 30% of individuals with non-
psychotic common mental disorders have subthresh-
old psychotic symptoms (Kelleher et al., 2012)
showing that a large proportion of mental illness is
unrecognised, but nevertheless has a significant im-
pact upon people’s lives. Those people with con-
ditions that meet criteria for diagnosis are treated
in primary care or by mental health professionals.

63



Studies consistently show that between 50-60% of
all individuals with a serious mental illness receive
treatment for their mental health problem at any
given time (Kessler et al., 2001).

However, most of the pathology tracking and im-
provement assessment is done through question-
naires, e.g. the Personal Health Questionnaire 9
(PHQ9) for depression (Kroenke and Spitzer, 2002),
and require a subjective comment by the patient, e.g.
“How many days have you been bothered with lit-
tle interest or pleasure in doing things in the past
two weeks?”. As with every personal judgement,
the responses are influenced by the environment in
which the person has been asked, the relationship to
the clinician and even the stigma attached to depres-
sion (Malpass et al., 2010). While there are aims
to integrate real-time reporting into a patient’s life
(Ibrahim et al., 2015), these are still based on set
questionnaires and may not fit with the main con-
cerns of a patient.

Social media, such as Twitter1, Facebook2 and
Reddit3, have become an accepted platform to com-
municate about life circumstances and experiences.
A specific example of social media in the context of
illness is PatientsLikeMe (Wicks et al., 2010). Pa-
tientsLikeMe has been developed to enable people
suffering from an illness to exchange information
with others with the same condition, e.g. to find al-
ternative treatment opportunities. It has been shown
that the support received in such online communities
can be empowering by engendering self-respect and
a feeling of being in control of the situation (Barak et
al., 2008). Hence, social media constitutes a tremen-
dous resource for better understanding diseases from
a patient perspective.

Social media data has recently been recognised as
one of the resources to gather knowledge about men-
tal illnesses (Coppersmith et al., 2015a; De Choud-
hury et al., 2013; Kumar et al., 2015). For exam-
ple, Twitter data has been used to develop classi-
fiers to recognise depression in users (De Choud-
hury et al., 2013) and to classify Twitter users who
have attempted suicide from those who have not
and from those who are clinically depressed (Cop-
persmith et al., 2015b). Furthermore, data col-

2https://en-gb.facebook.com/
3https://www.reddit.com/

lected from Reddit pertaining to suicidal ideation
could demonstrate the existence of the Werther ef-
fect (suicide attempts and completions after media
depiction of an individual’s suicide) (Kumar et al.,
2015). Coppersmith and colleagues used Twitter
data to determine language features that could be
used to classify Twitter users into suffering from
mental health problems and unaffected individuals
(Coppersmith et al., 2015a). However, while the au-
thors could identify features that allows the classifi-
cation between healthy and unhealthy Twitter users,
they also note that language differences in commu-
nicating about the different mental health problem
remains an open question. Similarly, Mitchell et al.
(2015) used Twitter data to separate users affected
by schizophrenia from healthy individuals by au-
tomatically identifying characteristic language fea-
tures for schizophrenia (Mitchell et al., 2015). Both
the latter approaches rely on the Linguistic Inquiry
and Word Count (LIWC) (Tausczik and Pennebaker,
2010), but Mitchell et al. also covers features such as
Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Brown Clustering.
Very recently and concurrently with our own work,
De Choudhury and colleagues have shown that lin-
guistic features can be used to predict the likelihood
of individuals transitioning from posting about de-
pression and other mental health issues on Reddit to
suicidal ideation (De Choudhury et al., 2016). This
work showed the ability to make causal inferences
on the basis of language usage and employed a small
subset of the mental health groups on Reddit.

Following on from the promise that such work
holds, our goal was to study language features that
are characteristic for individual mental health con-
ditions using large scale Reddit data. We antici-
pate that our findings can be used to assist in sep-
arating posts pertaining to different mental health
problems and for various language-based applica-
tions involving the better understanding of mental
health conditions. Reddit is particularly suitable
for such research as it has an enormous user base4,
posts and comments are topic-specific and the data
is publicly available. We focussed on subreddits
(communities where users can post/comment in re-
lation to a specific topic, e.g. suicide ideations)

4According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Reddit, Reddit had 234M unique users with 542M monthly
visitors as of 2015

of the Reddit data dump5 that address the follow-
ing mental health problems: Addiction, Anxiety,
Asperger’s, Autism, Bipolar Disorder, Dementia,
Depression, Schizophrenia, self harm and suicide
ideation. These conditions are commonly encoun-
tered by mental health practitioners and contribute
significantly to treatment costs. We aimed to iden-
tify linguistic characteristics that are specific to any
of the mental illnesses covered and can be used for
text classification tasks. The investigated character-
istics include lexical as well as syntactic features,
the uniqueness of vocabularies, and the expression
of sentiment and happiness. Our results suggest that
there are linguistic features that are discriminative
of the user communities used in this study. Fur-
thermore, applying a clustering method on subred-
dits, we could show that subreddits mostly contain
a topic-specific vocabulary. Moreover, we could
also highlight that there are differences in the way
that sentiment is expressed in each of the subred-
dits. Source code and related materials are avail-
able from: https://github.com/gkotsis/
reddit-mental-health.

2 Methods and Materials

As our aim was to define linguistic characteristics
specific to mental health problems, we downloaded
the Reddit data and extracted relevant posts and
comments. These were then further investigated
with respect to specific linguistic features, e.g. sen-
tence structure or unique vocabularies, to determine
characteristics for subsequent classification tasks.
The data set as well as the methods employed are
described in the following subsections.

2.1 Social media data from Reddit

Reddit is a social media network, where registered
users can post requests to a broader community.
Posts are hosted in topic-specific fora, so called sub-
reddits. Subreddits can be created by users based
on the subject they are interested in to communi-
cate. All users can freely join any number of sub-
reddits and participate in discussions. This means
that the posts are sent to a community potentially

redd.it/3bxlg7 (comments) and https://redd.it/
3mg812 (posts).

knowledgeable or at least interested in the topic. We
used this Reddit feature, to determine subreddits tar-
getting specific mental health problems.

For this purpose, we filtered the entire down-
loaded data set for subreddits targeting any of the
10 as relevant identified diseases. The entire data
set as obtained was separated into posts and com-
ments, and we preserved this separation so that anal-
ysis could be executed on either posts, comments or
both combined. Posts are initial textual statements
that initiate a communication with other users. Com-
ments are replies to posts and are organised in a tree-
like structure. Both posts and comments can be writ-
ten be anyone, and even the Reddit user that wrote
the initial post can comment on it. We note here
that the number of users, posts and comments varied
substantially between subreddits (see Table 1). To
refer to sets of both posts and comments (total also
in Table 1), we use the term “communication” in the
following sections.

Table 1: Numbers of posts, comments, ratio of comments over
posts, and the total of posts and comments (called “communica-

tions”) for each mental health-related subreddit included in this

study. Numbers are totalled across all subreddits in the last row

of this table. Extrema for each column are highlighted with a

purple coloured background.

Total 462,807 3,506,575 7.58 3,969,382

As shown in Table 1, the depression subred-
dit contains the largest amount of communications
(1.1M), while the smallest amount is found in the
BipolarSOs subreddit (5K). The number of posts is
always smaller than the number of comments though
the ratio of average number of comments per posts
varies. The highest average rate of comments per
posts can be seen on subreddit opiates, while the
smallest number of replies is observed on the ad-
diction subreddit.

2.2 Determining linguistic features

There are many ways to model communication.
Communication in the form of language use can be
characterised through a variety of feature types. Our
aim is to better understand the nature and depth of
the communication that takes place, and one way
to do this is by the analysis of linguistic features.
These features are particularly relevant in the con-
text of mental health problems, as the abilities of the
sufferer to effectively communicate can be affected
by such problems (Cohen and Elvevåg, 2014). For
example, someone suffering from Bipolar Disorder
may suddenly write a lot, but not necessarily in a co-
hesive manner. In the Iowa Writers’ Workshop study
(Andreasen, 1987) bipolar sufferers reported that
they were unable to work creatively during periods
of depression or mania. During depressive episodes,
cognitive fluency and energy were decreased, and
during manic periods they were too distractible and
disorganized to work effectively, so it would be rea-
sonable to expect this to be reflected in their prose.
Understanding these features and consequently the
nature and content of the posts will allow us to bet-
ter design useful classification systems and predic-
tive models.

Through discussion, we determined an initial fea-
ture set of linguistic characteristics that draws on
previously established measures of psychological
relevance, such as LIWC and Coh-Metrix (Graesser
et al., 2004). However, we note here that in order
to not overload our initial feature set, we selected a
subset of all the available possibilities. In our fea-
ture set, we included linguistic features introduced
by Pitler and Nenkova (Pitler and Nenkova, 2008)
and partially overlapping with those used in Coh-
Metrix for predicting text quality. More specifically,
we adopt features that aim at assessing the read-
ability of textual content. Readability is a measure-
ment that aims to assess the required education level
for a reader to fully appreciate a certain content.
The task of understanding textual content and as-
sessing its quality encompasses various factors that
are captured through the features that we also pro-
pose here (see supplemental material for more in-
formation about the implementation). A subset of
these features have been used successfully to pre-
dict the answers to be marked as accepted in on-

line Community-based Question Answering web-
sites (Gkotsis et al., 2014).

Our first set of features pertains to the usage of
specific words in documents. For instance, we look
at the usage of definite articles, since we believe that
definite articles are used for specific and personal
communications. Similarly, we keep track of pro-
nouns, first-person pronouns, and the ratio between
them, as indicators of the degree of first-person con-
tent.

Additional features in this initial set aimed at ex-
amining text complexity. In our approach, text com-
plexity can scale both horizontally (length, topic
cohesion) and vertically (clauses, composite mean-
ings). For the horizontal assessment, we count the
number of sentences. Another set of features, which
target the understanding of topic continuity and co-
hesion across sentences, is word overlap between
adjacent sentences, either by taking into account all
words, or just nouns and pronouns. For the vertical
assessment, we employ the following features: a) we
count the noun chunks and verb phrases (sequences
of nouns and verbs, respectively) and the number of
words contained within them, b) we construct the
parse tree of each sentence and measure its height,
and c) we count the number of subordinate conjunc-
tions (e.g. “although”, “because” etc.). A parse tree
represents the syntactic structure of a sentence, and
tools such as dependency or constituency parsers are
readily available for utilisation, e.g. as implemented
in the Python module spaCy6.

Finally, we found that a few posts do not contain
any text in their body, apart from their title. This was
typically the case for posts that contained a Uniform
Resource Locator (URL) to a web page of interest
to the community. We believe that the ratio of the
number of these posts over the total number of posts
is associated with the degree of information dissemi-
nation7, as opposed to the personal story-telling that
might occur in other cases, and thus included this as
an additional feature.

2.3 Word-based classification to assess
subreddit uniqueness

For this classification-based approach, we employed
a representation based on individual words, as well
as information on words that frequently co-occurred
together. The aim of this task was to examine how
closely aligned the vocabularies of each subreddit
were, assessed via a pairwise comparison. As high-
lighted in Table 1, the data volume (in terms of posts
and comments) differed significantly for the differ-
ent subreddits. In order to compensate for the differ-
ence in size, we utilised a randomisation process by
repeating the same experiment 10 times with a set
of 5000 randomly drawn posts for each repeat and
individually for each of the two subreddits that were
compared with each other.

In order to compare the vocabularies of two sub-
reddits with each other, we built dictionaries for each
pair of subreddits, by retrieving all words and se-
quences of words (of length 2) occurring in one or
both subreddits. We then used this list of words and
frequently co-occurring words to classify posts into
belonging to one of the two subreddits that are being
compared and recorded the performance for each of
the 10 cycles for each subreddit pair. The classifica-
tion performance was then averaged across all 10 cy-
cles to obtain a representative score for each pair of
subreddits. Using this classification approach, high
performance scores indicate a distinctive vocabulary
while low performance scores suggest a shared vo-
cabulary across both the subreddits. The results of
this pairwise comparison are illustrated in Figure 1.
More details are provided in the supplementary ma-
terials, covering the algorithm and randomisation
steps.

2.4 Detecting sentiment and happiness in posts

One additional aspect that can be assessed when
looking at the linguistic aspect of communications
on social media is the expression of sentiment. Sen-
timent has been noted as a crucial indicator of
how much involved someone is in a specific event
(Tausczik and Pennebaker, 2010; Murphy et al.,
2015), and therefore can also play a role in the ex-
pression of mental illness. Some of the conditions
investigated here may have characteristic mood pat-
terns, e.g. it is likely that someone suffering from

depression will use negative sentiment and express
unhappiness, while someone suffering from Bipolar
Disorder may change between positive and negative
mood expressions over time. However, by assess-
ing sentiment and happiness for a large population
of individuals, novel patterns for individual mental
health problems may evolve.

As part of our investigation, we used two dif-
ferent methods, one to detect sentiment (Nielsen,
2011) and another to detect happiness (Dodds et al.,
2011). Both methods, which were developed for
social media studies, rely on a topic-specific dic-
tionary. For each post in our subreddits, we deter-
mined the sentiment and happiness score by match-
ing words against the dictionaries. We accumulated
these scores on a per post basis and normalised it
by the square root of the number of words in the
post that were identified in the respective dictio-
nary. Scores for happiness were further normalised
to assign them to the same range as the values for
sentiment: negative values are expressions of neg-
ative sentiment/unhappiness, positive values are ex-
pressions of positive sentiment and happiness, and a
value of 0 can be seen as neutral.

We note here that while our aim is to classify both
posts and comments, we limited ourselves in this
task to posts only. Comments could be considered
to be a source of noise, which may mask potential
sentiment and happiness coming from posts, given
that our data set contains a lot more comments than
posts. In future work we would like to experiment
with more sophisticated linguistic methods for iden-
tifying sentiment and emotion.

3 Results

After identifying the subreddits relevant to the men-
tal health problems we were interested in, we deter-
mined linguistic features (related to content of com-
munications) for each of the subreddits. The results
of our investigations are presented in the following
subsections.

3.1 Subreddits exhibit differences in linguistic
features

Table 2 provides a summary of all the linguistic fea-
tures for each of the 16 subreddits, that were as-
sessed as part of this study. From this table, we

67



see that two subreddits stand out in a number of
the assessed criteria: BiPolarSOs and cripplingalco-
holism. BiPolarSOs is a subreddit that provides sup-
port and advice to people in a relationship where ei-
ther one or both partners are affected by Bipolar Dis-
order. Note that this means that users on this subred-
dit may not be affected by the disorder themselves
and may result in different communications from a
subreddit where only people with Bipolar Disorder
are communicating. In our data set it was the small-
est subreddit in terms of total number of commu-
nications (see Table 1). The subreddit cripplingal-
coholism aims to facilitate communication between
people addicted to alcohol. In the description of the
subreddit, there is no emphasis on supporting each
other and people can also share what they may con-
sider positive experiences regarding their condition
(e.g. “On day 8 of a bender that was supposed to
end today because my boss was supposed to send
me a bunch of work on Monday. She just emailed
me and said she won’t be sending it until Wednes-
day! Sweet chocolate Jesus on a bicycle, I did a jig
in my jammies, cracked open a new handle of rye,
and am about to take the dog on a nice drunken walk.
Sobriety, I’ll see you Wednesday. Maybe”).

From Table 2, we see that the BipolarSOs sub-
reddit not only has a higher number of first-person
pronouns and a larger number of definite articles,
but also that the average sentence seems to be more
complex due to a high average height of the sen-
tence parse trees, long verb clauses and a high num-
ber of subordinating conjunctions, while the aver-
age number of sentences per communication is com-
parable to those of the other subreddits. This sug-
gests that people posting on this subreddit explain in
detail their experience or advice. On the contrary,
the cripplingalcoholism subreddit possesses shorter
communications characterised by the lowest number
of sentences per communication, the smallest maxi-
mum height of sentence trees, a low number of sub-
ordinate conjunctions and short verb clauses. Us-
ing word frequency occurrences, we also observed
that here the language seems stronger than on other
subreddits with the most frequently occurring word
being ”fuck” (details of results not provided here8).

The two features relating to lexical cohesion (by
8Available as a wordcloud visualisation of all

subreddits at https://github.com/gkotsis/

means of adjacent sentences using similar words,
LF10 and LF11 in Table 2), show little variation
across all the 16 different subreddits. Though co-
hesion when only taking nouns and pronouns into
consideration improves, the best value obtained is
0.22, indicating a mostly low lexical cohesion across
communications on each of the subreddits. One of
our longer term goals is to be able to classify posts
to individual subreddits, and these scores would not
be sufficiently informative for this goal due to their
low variation.

3.2 Subreddit vocabulary uniqueness through
classification

The word occurrence-based comparison of the sub-
reddits was performed to better determine whether
subreddits can be distinguished based on their lexi-
cal content (see supplementary material for more in-
formation). The results obtained are shown in Fig-
ure 1.

Figure 1: Heatmap of pairwise classification of posts (only) be-
tween subreddits. High values denote high accuracy in classifi-

cation and therefore represent high discriminability in language.

Low values represent low score in classification and therefore

high language proximity between subreddits.

subreddit is mostly unique. OpiateRecovery shows
some vocabulary overlap with the opiates and addic-
tion subreddits, which suggests that there are some
shared topics on these subreddits. One of the excep-
tions is the subreddit addiction. As illustrated in the
heatmap the addiction subreddit shows particularly
low values with other subreddits such as depression
and suicidewatch. This finding is not surprising as
substance addiction can lead to depression and suici-
dal thoughts, which is expected to be also expressed
in the nature of the communication. Note that the
diagonal of the matrix is suppressed to reduce the
matrix dimension.

Among our 16 subreddits, there are some subred-
dits that allude to the same mental health condition,
e.g. BipolarReddit and BipolarSOs both aim to fos-
ter a community to facilitate exchange about Bipo-
lar Disorder. While the subreddit BipolarSOs invites
participation from users that are affected themselves
or are in a relationship with someone affected by
Bipolar Disorder, BipolarReddit is solely focussed
on people suffering from this disorder. In Figure 1,
we can also see that vocabularies seem to be partially
shared (indicated by a lighter colour) across those
subreddits addressing the same mental health prob-

lem. For example, all three subreddits relating to
Bipolar Disorder (bipolar, BipolarReddit and Bipo-
larSOs) show a pairwise score of ∼ 0.6 as opposed
to ∼ 0.9 with other subreddits. Similarly, both the
self-harm subreddits also share a pairwise vocabu-
lary of ∼ 0.6. Interestingly, the subreddits autism
and schizophrenia also indicate a proximity of the
vocabularies and further investigations are required
to assess the shared vocabularies.

3.3 Sentiment/happiness expressions on
subreddits

In order to assess the emotions that Reddit users ex-
press on subreddits related to mental health prob-
lems, we used two different methods: (i) to assess
sentiment and (ii) to specifically assess happiness.
The results obtained by both methods are shown in
Figure 2. This figure illustrates that, on average, a
lot of negative sentiment is expressed across the dif-
ferent subreddits relating to mental health problems.
We can see that posts from the subreddit Suicide-
Watch express the highest rate of negative sentiment,
followed by posts from the Anxiety and self-harm-
related subreddits.

While in the majority of cases both sentiment and

positive sentiments while a large number of subreddits show

predominantly negative sentiments. Positive values in this bar

plot correspond to positive sentiment and happiness, while neg-

ative values indicate negative sentiments or unhappiness.

Sentiment
Happiness

happiness expression possess the same direction (i.e.
either positive or negative), in a number of subred-
dits this is not the case. For example, the subred-
dit cripplingalcoholism shows expressions of hap-
piness as well as the expression of negative senti-
ment. As alluded to earlier, this particular subred-
dit includes people that see alcoholism as a life-
style choice. Though there may be happiness ex-
pressions related to overcoming alcoholism, there
are also happiness expressions relating to the glo-
rification of alcoholism, e.g. “[...] At the bottom
of this pile of clothes is a full pint! How it came to
rest there I don’t know, but thank you Taaka gods for
your gift on this day. [...]”.

Furthermore, Figure 2 shows a small number of
subreddits, where posts seem to express positive
sentiment. For example, the posts extracted from
the subreddit OpiatesRecovery seem to express not
only positive sentiment but also happiness. This
particular subreddit aims to foster a comunity that
focusses on helping each other get through opiate
withdrawals and users can post their progress. While
there are posts that discuss relapses, there are state-
ments such as “[...] I’m happy to say the shiv-
ers/flashes/heebeegeebees are a lot, lot better. Not
100% gone, but gone enough. I can deal with flashes
every 4-6 hours, cant deal with them every 15 min-
utes. [...]” to share the successes made during with-
drawal. The results shown in this figure are aver-
age values, which means that subreddits that show
an overall tendency to happiness and positive sen-
timent, may contain some posts including words of
negative sentiment and unhappiness, e.g. “[...] Buy-
ing garbage from some ignorant thug to put into my
fucking blood knowing how lethal it can be, but oh
it couldn’t happen to me. It’s bizarre that after all
this time of staying away I still can’t fully grasp how
fucking close to death I was every day. [...]” from
OpiateRecovery.

4 Discussion

In our study, we analysed 16 different subreddits
covering a range of mental health problems (see sup-
plementary material for more details). In our selec-
tion, there are subreddits with overlapping content,
e.g. StopSelfHarm and selfharm. We conducted an
analysis based on a selection of linguistic features
and found that most of the subreddits that are topic-
unrelated, possess a unique vocabulary (in terms of
words/word-pairs and the frequencies thereof) and
discriminating lexical and syntactic features. We
also observed differences in sentiment and happi-
ness expressions, which can give further clues about
the nature of a post.

As symptoms are shared across conditions and
more so, some of the mental health problems are co-
occurring (e.g. anxiety and depression), medications
and treatment strategies are shared across the differ-
ent illnesses, too. This, in consequence, means that
part of the vocabulary and thoughts across the differ-
ent subreddits are shared, making it harder to distin-

70



guish between the different subreddits and, conse-
quently, the condition in question. Given the latter,
it is even more surprising that the similarity matrix
shown in Figure 1 shows a good separation of topic-
specific vocabularies on subreddits.

With respect to the expression of sentiment and
emotions, further work is needed. The methods ap-
plied here were developed based on Twitter data and
further investigations are necessary to find the parts
of the dictionary that are overlapping and an expert-
guided assessment as to whether the recognised ex-
pressions are representative and meaningful in the
context of mental health problems. A previous study
has investigated how support is expressed in social
media (Wang et al., 2015) and can be leveraged in
future work to see whether similar support models
hold true for the subreddits concerning mental health
conditions. Moreover, the methods we have used so
far are based on lexica, which lack contextual infor-
mation. In future work, we plan to add more con-
textualised semantic methods for determining senti-
ment and emotions.

One limitation of the work presented here is that
we did not include any subreddits that are unrelated
to mental health. For example, we could have in-
cluded a subreddit such as Showerthoughts into our
subset to assess which of the features are unique to
mental health problems only. However, this would
require the definition of what is a truly unrelated
subreddit and variety of topics so that the control set
is not biased in itself. Furthermore, as our primary
aim was to build a classifier that distinguishes sev-
eral mental health problems based on the findings
reported here, an implicit assumption is that a post
is by default relevant to mental health conditions and
does not need to be classified as such. Nevertheless,
we plan to address this limitation in future work.

5 Conclusions

After extracting data from several subreddits per-
taining to mental health problems, we investigated
a subset of language features to determine discrimi-
natory characteristics for each of the subreddits. Our
results suggest that there are discriminatory linguis-
tic features among subreddits, such as sentence com-
plexity or vocabulary usage. We could also show
that while mostly all subreddits relating to mental

health problems possess highly negative sentiment,
there are a number of subreddits, where positive
sentiment and happiness can be observed in posts.
However, in order to determine the most discrimi-
native features between different mental health con-
ditions, additional work is required continuing from
the results shown here. In conclusion, these results
pave the way for future work on classification of
posts and comments concerning a mental health con-
dition, which in turn could allow the assignment of
urgency markers to address a specific communica-
tion.
