Abstract 

Using rooted, directed and labeled graphs, 

Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) 

abstracts away from syntactic features such 

as word order and does not annotate every 

constituent in a sentence. AMR has been 

specified for English and was not supposed 

to be an Interlingua. However, several 

studies strived to overcome divergences in 

the annotations between English AMRs 

and those of their target languages by 

refining the annotation specification. 

Following this line of research, we have 

started to build the first Turkish AMR 

corpus by hand-annotating 100 sentences 

of the Turkish translation of the novel “The 

Little Prince” and comparing the results 

with the English AMRs available for the 

same corpus. The next step is to prepare the 

Turkish AMR annotation specification for 

training future annotators.  

1 Introduction 

For a long time, semantic annotation of natural 

language sentences was split into subtasks, i.e. 

there were independent semantic annotations for 

named entity recognition, semantic relations, 

temporal entities, etc. The ultimate goal of 

Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) is to 

build a SemBank of English sentences paired with 

their whole-sentence logical meaning. To do this, 

one of the primary rules in AMR annotating 

sentences is to disregard many syntactic 

characteristics to unify the semantic annotations 

into a simple, readable SemBank (Banarescu et 

al., 2013). 

According to the Abstract Meaning 

Representation specification, AMR is not an 

Interlingua. The assertion has attracted 

researchers’ attention to sample AMR formalism 

on different languages. Several researches have 

been done to examine the compatibility of AMR 

framework with other languages such as Chinese 

and Czech (Xue et al., 2014; Hajic et al., 2014; Li 

et al., 2016). Other studies proposed methods to 

generate AMR annotations for languages with no 

gold standard dataset by implementing cross 

lingual and other rule based methods (Damonte 

and Cohen, 2017; Vanderwende et al., 2015).  

In this work, we have manually annotated 

100 sentences from the Turkish translation of the 

novel “The Little Prince” with AMRs to describe 

the differences between these annotations and 

their English counterparts. The next step is to 

prepare the Turkish AMR guideline based on the 

differences extracted in the previous phase for 

training future annotators who wish to construct 

the first Turkish AMR bank by hand-annotating 

1562 sentences of “The Little Prince” for which 

the English AMR bank is available.  

2 Abstract Meaning Representation 

Abstract Meaning Representation is defined as a 

simple readable semantic representation of 

sentences with rooted, directional labeled graphs 

(Flanigan et al., 2014). The main goal was set to 

build a SemBank resembling the proposition bank 

which is independent and disregards syntactic 

idiosyncrasies. 

The building blocks of AMR graphs are 

concepts represented in nodes and relations that 

hold among these concepts as the edges of the 

graph. Thus, instead of using syntactic features, 

AMR focuses on the relationships among 

concepts, some of which are extracted from 

PropBank and other words. Example 1 shows the 

English AMR for the sentence “I have had to 

grow old.” The root of the graph is a reference to 

the sense obligate-01 and is extracted from

AMR does not annotate every single 

word in the sentence since its goal is to represent 

the analysis of a sentence in predicative and 

conceptual levels. Furthermore, AMR does not 

represent inflectional morphology for syntactic 

categories like tense which results in the same 

meaning representation of similar sentences with 

different wordings or word order. For example, 

the two sentences “The boss has decided to fire 

the employee.” and “This is the boss decision to 

fire the employee.” have same AMR annotations. 

3 AMR Resources  

Inspired by the UNL project1, a freely 

downloadable annotated corpus of the novel “The 

Little Prince” containing 1562 sentences has been 

released by the project initiators2. The purpose was 

to release a corpus so that other researchers could 

compare their annotated sentences based on the 

same text. There is another annotated corpus, Bio 

AMR, freely available on the same website which 

contains cancer-related articles including about 

1000 sentences. Moreover, Abstract Meaning 

Representation release 2.0 which contains more 

than 39,260 annotated sentences was developed by 

the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC), 

SDL/language Weaver, Inc., The University of

California and is distributed via the LDC catalog.  

4 AMR Parsing 

The ultimate goal of semantic formalisms such as 

Abstract Meaning Representation in natural 

language processing is to automatically map 

natural language strings to their meaning 

representations. In an AMR parsing system, we 

work on graphs which have their own 

characteristics specified by AMR formalism. 

These properties like reentrancy in which a single 

concept participates in multiple relations or the 

possibility to represent a sentence with different 

word orders by a single AMR make the parsing 

phase challenging. On the bright side, similar to 

dependency trees, AMR has a graph structure in 

which nodes contain concepts and edges represent 

linguistic relationships. 

Several AMR parsing algorithms have 

been proposed so far (Wang et al., 2015; 

Vanderwende et al., 2015; Welch et al., 2018; 

Damonte et al., 2016; Damonte and Cohen, 2016) 

among which JAMR is the first open-source 

automatic parser published by the project 

initiators3. It works based on a two-stage 

algorithm in which concepts and then relations are 

identified using statistical methods. On the other 

hand, the transition-based method which 

transforms the dependency tree to an AMR graph 

seems promising because of its use of available 

dependency trees for different languages (Wang 

et al., 2015).  

Sometimes, in natural language 

processing, due to limited resources or lack of 

NLP tools, researchers seek to discover methods 

to get the most out of it. Cross-lingual Abstract 

Meaning Representation parsing (Damonte and 

Cohen, 2017) for which we do not require a 

standard gold data seems to overcome the 

structural differences between English and a 

target language in AMR annotation process using 

“annotation projection” method. The parser 

works based on annotation projection from 

English to a target language and has been trained 

for Italian, German, Chinese, and Spanish.

politics, and neckties.” and its Turkish translation 

(“Onlarla/them-with briç/bridge, golf/golf, politika/politics 

ve/and boyun bağları/neckties hakkında/about konuştum/I 

talked.”) 

Building a semantically hand-annotated 

corpus like an AMR bank is an arduous time-

consuming task. However, annotating a small 

amount of data manually results in achieving an 

understanding of the formalism, in the first place, 

and facilitating the evaluation of AMR parsers. 

The annotated AMR corpus of this study can be 

utilized in evaluating future Turkish AMR 

parsers. 

5 Turkish AMR 

As AMR is not an interlingua, several studies 

have examined the differences between AMR 

annotations of sentences in languages like 

Chinese and Czech with English AMR 

annotations (Xue et al., 2014; Hajic et al., 2014; 

Li et al., 2016) so far and some have introduced 

cross-lingual and rule based methods to generate 

AMR graphs for languages other than English 

(Damonte and Cohen, 2015; Vanderwende et al., 

2015). However, none of them had ever tackled 

an agglutinative language in which there is a 

possibility to derive and inflect words by 

cascading suffixes indefinitely. 

One of the main challenges in developing 

language models for morphologically rich 

languages with productive derivational 

morphology like Hungarian, Finnish, and modern 

Turkish is the number of word forms that can be 

derived from a root. According to Turkish 

Language Association (TDK)4, 759 root verbs 

exist in Turkish. Moreover, 2380 verbs are 

derived from nouns and 2944 verbs from verbs. 

Thus, there is almost no limit on suffixes a verb 

can take which results in tens of possible word 

formations. 

Another challenge in Turkish processing 

is its free word order that allows sentence 

constituents to move freely at different phrase 

levels. One should note that as the word order 

changes, some pragmatic characteristics such as 

focus and topics change as well. This property of 

Turkish might lead to several challenges such as 

the need for collecting as much data as possible to 

cover all possible word orders. 

For the first step, we have started hand-

annotating the Turkish translation of “The Little 

Prince” aligning to its English AMR annotation

to find out divergences and at the same time 

developing the very first Turkish AMR 

specification based on both English AMR 

guideline and differences between the two 

languages. The sentences were annotated by a 

non-Turkish linguist who aligned the English 

sentences with their literary translation in Turkish 

and created the AMR graphs using the Online 

AMR Editor5. Final annotations were proofread 

by a Turkish speaker.  

We annotated 100 sentences and came up 

with following observations. First, a small 

number of sentences have exactly the same AMR 

structure as their English translation. An example 

is shown in figure 1. As it is illustrated in the 

textual form of the annotation, which is in the 

form of PENMAN notation (Matthiessen and 

Bateman, 1991), concepts and relations are 

aligned, although objects of the two sentences are 

different. 

(t / talk-01 

  :ARG0 (i / i) 

  :ARG1 (a / and 

          :op1 (b / bridge) 

          :op2 (g / golf) 

          :op3 (p / politics) 

          :op4 (n2 / necktie)) 

  :ARG2 (h / he)) 

 

 

 

(k / konuşmak 

      :ARG0 (b / ben) 

      :ARG1 (v / ve 

            :op1 (b2 / briç) 

            :op2 (g / golf) 

            :op3 (p / politika) 

            :op4 (b3 / boyun-bağı)) 

      :ARG2 (o / onlar)) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Second, most of the AMR annotations’ 

divergences were due to different word choices in

Figure 3: The AMR annotation graph for the sentence “I 

pondered deeply” which is translated as (“uzun 

uzun/long long düşündüm/ thought-I.”) 

translating the text. Third, Turkish seems to be 

more expressive as suffixes add nuances to the 

words such as possession markers and 

intensifiers. Figure 2 shows AMR annotations for 

two sentences from the parallel corpus where 

ARG0 of live-01 in English has been changed to 

a non-core role, :poss, which shows possession in 

Turkish. Although there was the possibility to 

ignore the possession marker and list the 

arguments of the predicate, yaşamak (to live), like 

its English counterpart, we chose to leave it as it 

is to highlight the differences between English 

and Turkish as an agglutinative language in AMR 

annotation.  

Another important characteristic of 

Turkish is that unlike English, there are many 

light verbs and multiword expressions. In English 

AMR, we simply remove light verb constructions 

and use onto-notes predicate frames to deal with 

verb-particle combinations. However, due to the 

highly productive nature of Turkish and its 

idiosyncratic features, we need to be more 

cautious dealing with multiword expressions and 

light verb constructions. Figure 3 shows the 

inclination of Turkish toward productivity by 

duplicating the adjective, uzun (long), to be used 

as an adverb.   

In our future study, we will also 

investigate how morphosemantic features like 

case markers might help specifying relations 

between concepts in Turkish and whether adding 

these properties to the AMR annotation structure 

may help achieving more accurate results.

6 Future Work 

We have started the Turkish AMR project by 

annotating the first 100 hundred sentences of our 

parallel corpus, “The Little Prince”, and 

analyzing the divergences between our 

annotations and English AMR annotations. 

Currently, we are developing an AMR annotation 

guideline to construct the first Turkish Abstract 

Meaning Representation standard gold data. 

Finally, based on Turkish language peculiarities, 

we are going to create a transition-based parser to 

generate Turkish AMRs, which will be the first 

AMR parser for an agglutinative language.
