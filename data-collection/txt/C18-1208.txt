Abstract

This paper describes CzEngClass, a bilingual lexical resource being built to investigate verbal
synonymy in bilingual context and to relate semantic roles common to one synonym class to verb
arguments (verb valency). In addition, the resource is linked to existing resources with the same
or a similar aim: English and Czech WordNet, FrameNet, PropBank, VerbNet (SemLink), and
valency lexicons for Czech and English (PDT-Vallex, Vallex and EngVallex). There are several
goals of this work and resource: (a) to provide gold standard data for automatic experiments in the
future (such as automatic discovery of synonym classes, word sense disambiguation, assignment
of classes to occurrences of verbs in text, coreferential linking of verb and event arguments
in text, etc.), (b) to build a core (bilingual) lexicon linked to existing resources, serving for
comparative studies and possibly for training automatic tools, and (c) to enrich the annotation
of a parallel treebank, the Prague Czech English Dependency Treebank, which so far contained
valency annotation but has not linked synonymous senses of verbs together. The method used for
extracting the synonym classes is a semi-automatic process with a substantial amount of manual
work during filtering, role assignment to classes and individual class members’ arguments, and
linking to the external lexical resources. We present the first version with 200 classes (about 1800
verbs) and evaluate interannotator agreement using several metrics.

1 Introduction

Lexical resources, despite the fast progress in building end-to-end systems based on deep learning and
artificial neural networks, are an important piece of the puzzle in Computational Linguistics and Nat-
ural Language Processing (NLP). They provide information that humans need to understand relations
between words as well as the usage of these words in text. In addition, they can help various NLP tasks.
This is why lexicons like WordNet (Miller, 1995; Fellbaum, 1998; Pala et al., 2011), FrameNet (Baker et
al., 1998; Fillmore et al., 2003), VerbNet (Schuler, 2006), PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) or EngVallex
(Cinková, 2006; Cinková et al., 2014) have been created. They are for English, but there are also similar
resources for other languages, often in a multilingual setting: WordNet is available in many languages
(Vossen, 2004; Fellbaum and Vossen, 2012), Predicate Matrix (Lopez de Lacalle et al., 2016) extend
coverage of several verbal resources and adds more romance languages, FrameNet has been extended to
multiple languages (Boas, 2009), or there is the bilingual valency lexicon CzEngVallex for the case of
Czech and English (Urešová et al., 2016).

One might thus question why it is necessary to develop another resource, and not just to connect
some additional information to one or more of existing resources. After a thorough review (cf. also
Sect. 2), it appears that for verbal synonymy, none of those resources fully corresponds to our goal of
providing a lexicon of verbal synonyms based on at least semi-defined/semi-formal criteria, supported
by real (parallel) texts usage. In addition, most of those resources have been first created for English and
as some of the above publications acknowledge, there are then challenges to extend these resources to
other languages (Fellbaum and Vossen, 2012).

In this paper, we describe CzEngClass, a lexical resource containing verbs in synonym groups
(“classes”) that is based on certain criteria that help to determine membership in such classes. These
criteria use information from valency lexicons and semantic frames, and rely on actual examples of use
in a bilingual context. The lexicon is thus built “bottom up”, with emphasis on corpus evidence. In the
resulting lexicon, links to existing lexical resources are added.Through these links, all entries also refer to
examples from real bilingual texts with rich annotation, providing additional syntactic and morphological
information for all CzEngClass entries.

The paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2, related literature is discussed in more detail, while
the resources actually used or referred to are described in Sect. 4. The criteria used for determining
synonym class membership, specifically in bilingual context, are specified in Sect. 3. The resulting
lexicon structure is presented in Sect. 5. Sect. 6 contains a description of the annotation process, while
the interannotator agreement reached so far is analyzed in Sect. 7. We summarize some open questions
and outline future work in Sect. 9.

2 Related work

Due to the needs of various NLP tasks, attention is paid to building interlinked resource(s) which inte-
grates semantic information by mapping semantic knowledge from the individual lexical resources. One
of the goals is to establish semantic interoperability between various semantic databases. As examples,
we can name the SemLink (Palmer, 2009; Bonial et al., 2013) which provides manual mappings of four
lexical resources (PropBank, VerbNet, FrameNet and WordNet), while the Predicate Matrix (Lopez de
Lacalle et al., 2016) integrates and extends semantic information included in SemLink via automatic
methods. BabelNet (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012) integrates the largest multilingual Web encyclope-
dia(s), but mostly concetrates on “facts”. Besides a whole range of monolingual synonym lexicons such
as Roget’s thesaurus (PSI and Associates, 1988) or WordNet (Miller, 1995; Fellbaum, 1998) for En-
glish, there are also cross-lingual synonym resources such as EuroWordNet, linking WordNet synsets
across languages (Fellbaum and Vossen, 2012). WordNet contains a rich network or relations between
its synsets (hyperonymy, hyponymy, ...), however, it does not contain information about syntactic and
compositional semantic behavior, which is a drawback especially in case of verbs.

Our approach to verbal synonymy builds on previous research which also considered multilingual
data (translations) in parallel corpora as an important resource. Translational context is regarded as a
rich source of semantic information (de Jong and Appelo, 1987; Dyvik, 1998; Adamska-Sałaciak, 2013;
Andrade et al., 2013). Parallel corpora have also been used (Resnik, 1997; Ide, 1999; Ide et al., 2002)
for automatic methods for sense induction and disambiguation, for cross-lingual similarity detection and
synonym extraction (Wu et al., 2010; Wu and Palmer, 2011). (Wang and Wu, 2012) studies various
assumptions about synonyms in translation, for the purpose of trend detection from titles. While these
works aim at automatic methods and applications, they share the idea that if two words are semantically
similar in a language, their translations in another language would be also similar. Translations of a word
from another language are often synonyms of one another (Lin et al., 2003; Wu and Zhou, 2003). A
similar idea, i.e., that words sharing translational context are semantically related, can be found in (Plas
and Tiedemann, 2006).

Interannotator agreement evaluation is regularly used in corpus annotation. However, it is much more
scarcely used in lexicon entry creation and annotation, especially in a multilingual setting. For assign-
ment of topics to words in Hindi and English, see (Kanojia et al., 2016). More detailed account on the
influence of semantic lexical granularity within the Context Pattern Analysis paradigm on interannotator
agreement can be found in (Cinková et al., 2012).

3 Synonymy in bilingual context

Synonymy in bilingual context is closely related to translational equivalence, sameness, similarity, mean-
ing, word sense, etc. These terms - and the term synonymy itself - are not always used in an unambiguous
way. We thus discuss the terminology first, and then specify how we define verbal synonymy in bilingual
context in the work on building the CzEngClass lexicon.



2458

3.1 Terminology

Although Cruse (1986) notes that “there is unfortunately no neat way of characterising synonyms”, the
notion of synonymy is mostly seen as “sameness or identity of meaning” (Palmer, 1976; Sparck Jones,
1986). Leech (2012) restricts synonymy to equivalence of conceptual meaning. Synonym is mostly de-
fined as “a same-language equivalent” (Adamska-Sałaciak, 2010; Adamska-Sałaciak, 2013) and “does
not exceed the limits of a single language” (Gouws, 2013), while for bilingual contexts the term trans-
lational equivalent is used. On the other hand, (Martin, 1960; Klégr, 2004; Hahn et al., 2005; Hayashi,
2012; Haiyan, 2015; Dinu et al., 2015) recognize interlingual synonymy and use either the term foreign-
language equivalent, cross-lingual synonym, synonymous translation equivalent or bilingual synonym.

In building CzEngClass, we consider the relationship between the lexical unit of the source language
(SL) and of the target language (TL) unit as a specific type of synonymy, an interlingual synonymy. For
words from different languages which are interlingual synonyms, we prefer to use the term bilingual
synonyms. We understand that the meaning correspondence does not mean absolute equivalence and
automatic interchangeability. We agree with (Louw, 2012) that the translation equivalent might be a
TL item that can only be a substitute for the SL item in one or in some of its uses and each equivalent
has to be supported with additional contextual and co-textual restrictions that will allow the user to
make an appropriate choice of an “equivalent” for a given usage situation. Accordingly, we believe
that interlingual synonymy considerations are essential in the translation process because it is up to the
translator to choose the most suitable expression among (intralingual) synonyms, based on context and
the meaning of the SL text (Catford, 1965; Newmark, 1988).

Intralingual synonyms are often not interchangeable, i.e., not quite equivalent. Synonymy, as viewed
by (Lyons, 1968; Cruse, 1986), has to be seen as a scale of similarity (absolute, near and partial syn-
onymy) and it is generally acknowledged that absolute synonymy is rare in natural languages. There-
fore, it is believed that context must be taken into account (Palmer, 1981). Such synonyms are then called
contextual synonyms (Zeng, 2007) or contextual correlates of synonymy (Rubenstein and Goodenough,
1965) and described as words that are “synonymously” used in certain specific texts.

3.2 Definition of contextual synonymy in CzEngClass

Both types of synonymy (interlingual and intralingual) are captured in the CzEngClass lexicon, which
aims to group verbs into synonym classes both monolingually and cross-lingually. Along with (Palmer,
1981), we believe that synonymy can only be considered in context. We define two (or more) verb
senses to be bilingual synonyms if they both (or all) convey the same meaning in a given particular
context. Similarly, for the intralignual case, we work with the “loose” interpretation of synonymy (Lyons,
1968; Palmer, 1981), and consider context as a key factor that helps to overcome the vagueness of such
“looseness”.

In CzEngClass, context is defined as the set of semantic roles (SRs) that the given verb, as a mem-
ber of a bilingual synonym class, expresses by its arguments and/or adjuncts, or which are implicitly
present, possibly with additional structural or semantic restrictions. Each class has an associated, single
(common) set of SRs while such a set is shared by all its members, even if each SR can be expressed
(mapped to) by a different argument (or by an adjunct, or implicitly or explicitly in the verb’s dependent
substructure) for different verbs as members of that class. Conversely, such mapping must exist at least
for all obligatory valency slots as defined in the two corresponding valency lexicons. To keep each class
focused, only a relatively small set of SRs is usually assigned to it (corresponding roughly to “core”
Frame Elements in FrameNet, even though the labels might not match).1

Such focus then helps to answer the question of candidate verb membership in a particular synonym
class. If a mapping of all arguments to the SRs associated with that class is found, as well as a mapping

1In fact, there is one substantial difference between the intended properties of CzEngClass’s SRs and those found in
FrameNet: while FrameNet explicitly states that SRs (FEs) from one Frame, even if under the same label, should not be
construed as being the same as equally labeled SR (FE) in a different Frame, we would like to use such a set of SRs that is
labeled consistently across CzEngClass classes. For the moment, however, we resort to VerbNet thematic roles for the most
common SR “slots”, such as Agent and to a certain extent also Theme, renaming them in the future consistently once we have
a larger set of classes ready. For more details on the process, see Sect. 6.



2459

of all SRs of that class to the candidate verb arguments, adjuncts (or implicit, or even more deeply
embedded dependents), and it does not violate any of the associated restrictions, then the candidate verb
is considered to be a valid member of such class. Since CzEngClass is built mainly manually,2 it is
important to establish such criteria in order to achieve higher interannotator agreement (IAA) as well as
for guiding the adjudication process. Table 1 illustrates one possible class and the context (SR mappings)
for each member.

4 Resources used

The resources used to create the CzEngClass lexicon are divided into two groups - primary and secondary.
Primary resources are those used for word sense disambiguation and valency information when cre-

ating the class member candidates. We use the parallel Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank 2.0
(PCEDT 2.0) (Hajič et al., 2012) with its associated lexicons. This treebank contains over 1.2 million
words in almost 50,000 sentences for each language. About 90,000 tokens are verbs on each side. The
English part contains the entire Penn Treebank - Wall Street Journal Section (Marcus et al., 1993). The
Czech part is a manual translation of all the Penn Treebank-WSJ texts to Czech. PCEDT is annotated
using The Prague Dependency Treebank style (Hajič et al., 2006; Hajič et al., 2018) manual linguistic
annotation based on the Functional Generative Description framework (Sgall et al., 1986). Our research
benefits primarily from the deep syntactico-semantic (tectogrammatical) dependency trees, interlinked
across the two languages on sentence and node (content word) levels. Each deep syntax verb occurrence
in the PCEDT is linked to the corresponding valency frame (predicate-argument structure frame) in the
associated valency lexicons, PDT-Vallex (Urešová et al., 2014; Urešová, 2011) and EngVallex (Cinková,
2006; Cinková et al., 2014), effectively providing also word sense labeling. The parallel bilingual va-
lency lexicon CzEngVallex (Urešová et al., 2016; Urešová et al., 2015), built over the PCEDT, is also
heavily used, both in the annotation process itself but also for automatic preannotation.

Secondary resources are the well-known English lexical resources: FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998;
Ruppenhofer et al., 2006), FrameNet+ (Pavlick et al., 2015), VerbNet and OntoNotes (Schuler, 2006;
Pradhan et al., 2007), SemLink (Palmer, 2009; Bonial et al., 2012), PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005), and
English WordNet (Miller, 1995; Fellbaum, 1998). For Czech, we use Czech WordNet (Pala and Smrž,
2004) and VALLEX (Lopatková et al., 2016). These resources are used for the extraction of an initial set
of SRs (taken from FrameNet and VerbNet), and most importantly, their entries (if possible to the level of

Czech and English, see Sect. 6.



2460

exact lexical units / frames / synsets) are referred to (explicitly linked) from all the corresponding entries
in the CzEngClass lexicon.

5 Lexicon Structure

The structure of CzEngClass is described in detail (Urešová et al., 2018a; Urešová et al., 2018d; Urešová
et al., 2017a; Urešová et al., 2017b). Here we summarize only its main characteristics.

The CzEngClass lexicon is in principle a set of (bilingual synonym) classes. Each class contains
both Czech and English verbs (class members), identified by their valency frame identifier (i.e., a link
to the Czech and English valency lexicons that served as the initial sense inventory for each verb). For
each class, the lexicon records also the set of semantic roles, which is common for the class. For each
class member, its arguments (valency slots) are mapped to this set (not necessarily 1 : 1 - arbitrary m : n
mappings are allowed). For each member, additional restrictions (for the time being, in the form of a
plain text description) are recorded as well. In addition, the lexicon also records, within each class, the
original verb pairs as found aligned across the two languages in the PCEDT, and their argument alignment
as coming from the CzEngVallex bilingual valency lexicon. All external links (to FrameNet frame(s),
Ontonotes Sense Groupings, VerbNet type(s), WordNet synset(s)) are also recorded (see Sect. 4).

The lexicon, technically a single XML file with external references, also contains a header with all
the SRs used and their description, annotator IDs, bookkeeping information about all the external re-
sources in order to create a URL for each external link, and all entries also contain the usual annotation
information (log with timestamps, etc.).3

6 The lexicon annotation process

First, we automatically aligned Czech verbs with their English verbal translations4 as found in the
PCEDT. There are two phases, each further broken down to several steps.

In Step 1 of the first phase, we have automatically extracted 200 Czech verbs5 and their English
translations. These 200 verbs have been selected to represent both high-, medium- and low-frequency
verbs in the PCEDT. They have been found in 23,769 sentences, covering about half of the corpus.6

Each Czech verb serves as a “seed” in the future bilingual synonym class. The English translations are
the (first-phase, English-language) class member candidates. Using the principles of both intra-lingual
and inter-lingual synonymy (Sect. 3), and with the help of comparing the valency frames of the Czech
verb and the English verb and the English verbs among themselves, we then manually pruned these
candidates, obtaining a list of (English) synonym class members.

In Step 2 of the first phase, we have used these English verbs and added, similarly to Step 1 but in
an opposite direction and using the same corpus, additional Czech synonym class member candidates.
These have been pruned manually again and a result of this pruning was a (first-phase) bilingual synonym
class, built around the original Czech verb.

In the second phase, two tasks had to be carried out for all classes. First, to every class member the
appropriate linking to English and Czech resources had to be provided. Using a dedicated class editor, we
started with mapping every English verb sense in the class to Ontonotes Sense Grouping. Then, links to
FrameNet, PropBank, WordNet and Czech VALLEX have been added.7 Second, core SRs inventory (for
each class) had to be created. We were mostly inspired by FrameNet’s frame elements (FEs) resorting
to more general VerbNet’s thematic roles if FEs were deemed to be specific. For each class member, its
valency arguments (taken from PDT-Vallex for Czech verbs and EngVallex for English ones) have been
mapped to the appropriate SR from the set of SRs assigned to the whole class. So far, this second step
has been performed for the first 60 classes only.

5I.e., 200 verb senses represented by their valency frames as annotated in the data.
6Average number of sentences per Czech verb is 119, median is 26. These sentences may contain also other verbs.
7Links to Czech WordNet will be added later.



2461

The process described above was first tested and fine-tuned by two annotators, and then a detailed
testing (so far, of Step 1 of the first phase), as reported in Sect. 7 below, has been performed by eight
annotators.

7 Evaluation: interannotator agreement

Using the first part of the annotation process (filtering of the precomputed list of English verbs for a
given Czech verb, in a particular sense), an IAA evaluation scheme has been set up (Table 2).

No. of classes No. of English verbs
(Czech verbs) (sum over all clases)

Part 1 15 131
Part 2 15 134
Part 3 17 127
Part 4 13 152
Total 60 544

Table 2: Interannotator agreement experiment setup

As described in Sect. 6, the 60 Czech verbs (senses) have been selected in the PCEDT such that
they represented high-, medium- and low-frequency verbs in roughly the same proportion.8 For those
60 verbs, all their English translational verbal counterparts9 aligned with them have been extracted au-
tomatically from the corpus, with the help of the CzEngVallex lexicon which refers to particular verb
senses.This alignment is however not perfect for our purposes. The task of the annotators was to prune,
for each Czech verb sense (i.e., the potential/future synonym class), the automatically preselected list of
its English verbal translational equivalents so that only synonym candidates corresponding to the mean-
ing of the Czech verbs as it appears in the bilingual corpus are preserved. For this experiment, the
annotators have not been given the full definition of the synonym as presented here in Sect. 3. They have
been instructed, for each pair of the Czech verb and its English synonym candidate, to check the corpus
examples through the CzEngVallex valency argument alignments, i.e., the usage in context as defined in
Sect. 3, but not to validate (yet) against the set of SRs for the given class.10

There have been 8 annotators, each of them annotating 2 different parts. 1 of the annotators is a
professional translator, 2 of them are researchers in the field of Computational linguistics with a Ph.D.
degree, and the remaining 5 are undergraduate students of various language and linguistic programs, all
with high-level fluency in English. All annotations have been treated as equal.

Each English synonym class member candidate verb was annotated by 4 annotators (Table 2). The
annotators have been asked to assign, to each candidate English verb, one of the five labels summarized
in Table 3, corresponding to a scaled decision of how strong the annotators feel about including (or not
including) the English word in the resulting synonym group.

Only the labels have been presented to the annotators, which have been then converted to the scale
used for some of the evaluation metrics, as described below. The data for the interannotator agreement as
described in this paper are available with the previous version of CzEngClass (Urešová et al., 2018b).11

7.1 Interannotator agreement: Cohen’s kappa
Cohen’s kappa, used for comparing annotations pairwise, is defined as follows:

κ = (p0− pe)/(1− pe) (1)
8This selection is to gain insight to the issues with verbs of all frequencies; overall, of course, the verbs with low frequency

will prevail, making the statistics more favorable since classes for these verbs tend to have less members and thus higher IAA.
9We are aware of the fact that many verbs are translated by nouns or other kinds of phrases. These translational counterparts

are not yet part of the CzEngClass.
10We understand this as a first step. The class membership might be–and surely will be–changed in the second step, namely,

when assigning the SR mappings to valency slots. This is the most important “context” criterion defining the class membership
based on our principles of synonymy as defined in Sect. 3, and specifically in Sect. 3.2.

annotators to two values only: Y (if they used labels Y and RY ) and N (if they used labels N, RN and D),
since Cohen’s kappa would be hard to interpret if scaled values are behind the labels used.

Table 4: Interannotator agreement: Cohen’s kappa, pairwise

Due to the distribution of Parts 1-4 to annotators, not all pairs of annotators could be compared (empty
cells in Table 4). The parts in any row or column are different for different annotators.12

While averaging over the annotators is not well defined within such pairwise distribution of data, we
can see quite clearly that A3 has overall the lowest agreement with the others, but the differences are
not that high. The values are low, but this is due to the fact that the label assignment has been biased to
assigning Y (i.e., to keep the verb in) in about an 5:1 ratio.

7.2 Interannotator agreement: Fleiss’ kappa

As opposed to Cohen’s kappa, Fleiss’ kappa can be used in a multiannotator setup with n annotators and
N datapoints (total of English verbs in the 60 classes annotated, i.e., 544 in our case):

κ = (P̄− P̄e)/(1− P̄e) (2)

i=1 niNo. The niYes (niNo) counts are defined as the

number of times the i-th datapoint has been annotated Y and N, respectively (i.e., sum of niYes and niNo
is n). The Ys and Ns have been obtained by the same mapping as in the Cohen’s kappa case: Y and RY
mapped to Y and N, RN and D mapped to N. Table 5 shows the intermediate and final values of Fleiss’
kappa. The 0.45 value characterizes the “global” difficulty of the task; again, we have to stress that the
bias is high (about 5:1), so that any disagreement lowers the kappa value substantially.

12Given the amount of effort available for the annotation, the four parts have been distributed in such a way that at least those
pairs listed in the table could be covered.

Table 5: Interannotator agreement: Fleiss’ kappa, global

Given the low kappa values, we have been interested in numbers that could perhaps be easier to
interpret from the point of view of adjudication, which will inevitably follow to ensure high quality of
the resulting lexicon. In addition, we are not convinced that these widely used interannotator metrics are
appropriate for highly biased lexical task (as opposed for running text annotation in a corpus). We have
thus measured two more things: consensus and deviation from the assumed correct value, both described
below.

7.3 Annotator consensus

As a first step, we have measured consensus. Of the 544 datapoints the annotators assigned the label
(again mapped to Y and N only), in 488 cases a majority consensus could be reached (89.7%); i.e., only
in slightly over 10% of the cases the result was 2:2 (with 4 annotators working on each datapoint). This
number naturally varies with the number of annotators (it would be higher for 2 annotators, and always
100% for an odd number of annotators unless a higher threshold is set for determining consensus), but
when combined with full agreement among the 4 annotators (358 cases out of the 544, or 65.8%), it gives
a good idea of the adjudication effort needed (for 4 annotators, in our case).13

7.4 Comparison based on the annotated scale

Since the annotation of class membership for the candidate English synonym verbs has been in fact on
a scale 0-4 (see Table 3), we tried to compute a global (averaged) score of deviation from a centerpoint,
namely the assumed correct value, computed either as a majority or average value as assigned to every
English verb by the four different annotators that had labelled it. We have used two methods.

In the first method, we have determined the “correct” value by taking the majority annotation, re-
stricted again to two values: Y(es) and N(o) (with mapping from the five different (scaled) annotated
labels as in the kappa computation, Sect. 7.1). For computing the deviation on a particular datapoint,
we use the same mapping. In other words, the deviation can only be 0 (agreement with Y or N) or 3
(disagreement). The averaged (absolute) deviation DevA2 j for an annotator j is then defined as

DevA2 j =
∑Ni=1 |Bi−Si j|

where Bi is the correct value (4 for Y, 1 for N) for verb i (out of N verbs, where N = 544 in our dataset),
and Si j is the mapped value on that i-th verb for annotator j.

The deviation computed on this mapped (Y/N) values is summarized for all annotators in Table 6; the
average over all annotators is 0.27 (within a span of maximum possible difference of 3 (4-1)). Since
the bias towards the Y label in the consensus labeling is about 5:1, giving everything Y would result in
approx. average deviation 1/6×3 = 0.5, so the annotation cut this deviation to half.

Annotator A1 A2 A3 A4 A5 A6 A7 A8 Data avg.
Avg. deviation 0.21 0.20 0.23 0.26 0.41 0.21 0.31 0.31 0.27

Table 6: Deviation from consensus value, mapping to 2 values only (Y/N)

The second method, which is meant for evaluation purposes only, does not select one consensus value,
but simply averages the scaled labels over all (four) labels assigned by the annotators to every datapoint
(verb to annotate) i:

13The total agreement has been measured using all labels; i.e., if 3 annotators assigned N and 1 assigned RN , it did not count
as full agreement.



2464

Pi = (
n

∑
k=1

vik)/n

where n is a number of annotations for a given datapoint (i.e., always four in our case, since each verb
has been annotated by 4 annotators), k runs over all labels assigned to the i-th datapoint, and vik is the
k-th value (0-4, mapped from (D, N, RN , RY , Y; see Table 3) assigned to i-th datapoint.

The deviation for each annotator is then computed as

DevA5 j =
∑Ni=1 |Pi−Ai j|

N
(5)

where Pi is the averaged value as defined above for verb i (out of N verbs, where N = 544 in our
dataset), and Ai j is value assigned to the i-th datapoint by annotator j.

The averaged values are shown in Table 7.

Annotator A1 A2 A3 A4 A5 A6 A7 A8 Data avg.
Avg. deviation 0.32 0.32 0.32 0.32 0.45 0.36 0.37 0.41 0.36

Table 7: Deviation from average assigned value, all 5 values used (0-4)

These deviations are (somewhat surprisingly) larger than the deviations computed after mapping the
labels to the binary (Y/N) values only. In other words, the deviation is smaller when the “unsure” labels
(RY , RN) are mapped to Y and N, and the D value also to N, disregarding the difference between these
two.

Since the final lexicon will not contain any manually assigned weights, i.e., a given verb will be
considered either in a class or not in a class. we believe that the relevant numbers are those in Table 6.

While the two methods of computing interannotator “deviation” compute absolute difference between
the annotator-assigned value and the “truth”, we have been interested yet in another value, namely
whether a given annotator tends to keep the preselected verbs in the class or not. This number thus
does not describe annotator’s distance from the consensus value or the average, but rather his average
positive attitude (prefers to keep many verbs in) or a negative one (prefers to mark verbs as not belonging
to the synonym class in question).

We compute the “truth” as a simple average of the graded labels for every verb:

DevS5 j =
∑Ni=1(Pi−Ai j)

N
(6)

The resulting value can now be also negative, meaning that the annotator assigned lower values on the
0-4 scale than average, and by how much.

Annotator A1 A2 A3 A4 A5 A6 A7 A8
Avg. (signed) deviation 0.09 0.05 0.13 0.08 -0.19 0.07 -0.02 0.11

Table 8: Signed deviation from average assigned value, all 5 values used (0-4)

Table 8 shows the results. The deviation for 2 annotators, A5 and A7 is in the negative territory. These
annotators, and specifically A5, are considered “conservative”, since their annotation keeps the synonym
classes small - they prefer only clear synonyms to become included in the class. Annotator A3, on the
other hand, is the most “liberal” of all and leans towards including more words in the class.

8 Extending CzEngClass to Other Languages

An interesting question is what is necessary in order to create a similar lexical resource–using the ap-
proach described here–for other languages or to extend our resource by another language. Based on our



2465

experience so far, we believe this is the minimal set of necessities to start with: a valency or predicate-
argument lexicon for that language (a corresponding parallel resource - with English, such as our CzEng-
Vallex lexicon - might be helpful but it is not essential) and a word-aligned and (at least automatically)
syntactically analyzed parallel corpus (pairing the language in question to English, or to any language that
is already included in the Class lexicon being extended). In addition, some word-sense-distinguishing
lexicon (e.g., WordNet in that language) is also nice to have to link the class members to. Moreover,
having additional lexical resources in the given language (such as FrameNet) would be an advantage that
will help the consistency of annotation and the usefulness of the final, externally linked synonym lexicon,
but this is not strictly necessary.

9 Conclusions and future work

We have described the first version of a semi-manually built bilingual synonym lexicon of verbs, CzEng-
Class, based on a parallel corpus and existing lexical resources. The process of building the lexicon is
relatively complex, and we have presented results of the first step of “soft” (scaled) lexical unit annotation
by several annotators. We have evaluated their agreement by several metrics, giving us some indication
of how much future effort will be needed for adjudication in order to obtain a high-quality resource.

These first findings indicate that the traditional measures for IAA show low agreement, primarily due
to high bias in the automatic preselection which favors the preselected verbs to be kept (in 5:1 ratio).14

Using a different measure based on deviation from consensus, we found that a full consensus has been
achieved among 4 annotators in almost 2/3rd of test cases, and if we lower the criterion of agreement to
3 of 4 annotators, in 9 of 10 cases (Sect. 7.3). This is only when considering the verb sense and valency;
adding the semantic roles, which is the next step, would likely lower that agreement. For example, we
will explore more the assumption (and try to explicitly define where and when it can be used) that the
valency slots to semantic roles mapping might need to be m:n, which of course greatly influences the
interannotator agreement as opposed to the case where only 1:1 mapping is allowed.

The first version (200 classes, i.e., approx. 1800 class members, Phase 1 annotation) has been released
publicly (Urešová et al., 2018c).15

Phase 2 annotation is ongoing, with semantic role assignment to classes and the detailed mapping of
valency to these roles. Eventually, we will extend CzEngClass to all verbs found in the PCEDT. This is
expected to go smoothly, perhaps with the usual exception of the verbs to be, to have, to become and to
do. Otherwise, since we have already (intentionally) dealt with verbs of various frequencies and degrees
of homonymy, representing a wide range of possible valency-to-semantic-roles mappings, we believe no
substantial issues in the specification nor the annotation process should arise.

For the more distant future, we plan to use the core PCEDT-derived CzEngClass lexicon to do experi-
ments on automatic extraction of synonym classes from other (larger) data, while using CzEngClass as a
gold standard. If successful, we plan to extend CzEngClass to other verbs similarly to what the Predicate
Matrix project did, but with the arguably best system based on the above experiments; in all cases, we
plan for manual pass to obtain consistent classes with those done fully manually.
