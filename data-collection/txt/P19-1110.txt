Abstract

News recommendation can help users find in-
terested news and alleviate information over-
load. The topic information of news is critical
for learning accurate news and user represen-
tations for news recommendation. However, it
is not considered in many existing news rec-
ommendation methods. In this paper, we pro-
pose a neural news recommendation approach
with topic-aware news representations. The
core of our approach is a topic-aware news en-
coder and a user encoder. In the news encoder
we learn representations of news from their ti-
tles via CNN networks and apply attention net-
works to select important words. In addition,
we propose to learn topic-aware news repre-
sentations by jointly training the news encoder
with an auxiliary topic classification task. In
the user encoder we learn the representations
of users from their browsed news and use at-
tention networks to select informative news for
user representation learning. Extensive exper-
iments on a real-world dataset validate the ef-
fectiveness of our approach.

1 Introduction

Online news platforms such as Google News and
MSN News have attracted hundreds of millions
of users to read news online (Das et al., 2007;
Lavie et al., 2010). Massive news are generated
everyday, making it impossible for users to read all
news to find their interested content (Phelan et al.,
2011). Thus, personalized news recommendation
is very important for online news platforms to help
users find their interested news and alleviate infor-
mation overload (IJntema et al., 2010).

Learning accurate representations of news and
users is critical for news recommendation (Wu
et al., 2019b,a). Several deep learning based meth-
ods have been proposed for this task (Okura et al.,
2017; Wang et al., 2018; Kumar et al., 2017; Khat-
tar et al., 2018; Zheng et al., 2018). For example,

Title Topic

Figure 1: Three example news articles.

Okura et al. (2017) proposed to learn news repre-
sentations from news bodies via denoising auto-
encoders, and learn user representations from the
representations of their browsed news via a gated
recurrent unit (GRU) network. Wang et al. (2018)
proposed to learn news representations from news
titles via a knowledge-aware convolutional neu-
ral network (CNN), and learn user representations
from news representations using the similarity be-
tween candidate news and browsed news. How-
ever, these methods do not take the topic informa-
tion of news into consideration.

Our work is motivated by the following obser-
vations. First, the topic information of news is use-
ful for news recommendation. For example, if a
user clicks many news with the topic “sport”, we
can infer she is probably interested in sports. Thus,
exploiting the topic information of news has the
potential to learn more accurate news and user rep-
resentations. Second, not all news articles contain
topic labels, since it is very expensive and time-
consuming to manually annotate the massive news
articles emerging everyday. Thus, it is not suitable
to directly incorporate the topic labels of news as
model input. Third, different words in the same
news may have different informativeness in rep-
resenting news. For example, in Fig. 1 the word
“Airlines” is more informative than “Some”. Be-
sides, different news may also have different im-
portance for user representation. For instance, the
first news in Fig. 1 is more informative than the
third one in inferring the interest of users.

In this paper, we propose a neural news recom-



1155

mendation approach with topic-aware news repre-
sentations (TANR) which exploit the useful topic
information in news. The core of our approach is
a topic-aware news encoder and a user encoder.
In the news encoder, we learn the representations
of news from their titles by capturing the local
contexts via CNNs. Since different words may
have different informativeness for news represen-
tation, we apply attention network to select impor-
tant words for news representation learning. In ad-
dition, we propose to learn topic-aware news rep-
resentations by jointly training the news encoder
with an auxiliary topic classification task. In the
user encoder, we learn representations of users
from the representations of their browsed news.
Since different news may have different informa-
tiveness for user representation, we apply attention
network to select informative news for user repre-
sentation learning. Extensive experiments are con-
ducted on a real-world dataset. The results show
our approach can effectively improve the perfor-
mance of news recommendation.

2 Our Approach

In this section, we first introduce our basic neural
news recommendation model. Then we introduce
how to learn topic-aware news representations.

2.1 Neural News Recommendation Model

The architecture of our basic neural news recom-
mendation model is shown in Fig. 2. It consists
of three major modules, i.e., news encoder, user
encoder and click predictor.

News Encoder. The news encoder module is
used to learn representations of news from their
titles. It contains three layers. The first one is
word embedding, which converts a news title from
a word sequence into a vector sequence. Denote
a news title as [w1, w2, ..., wM ], where M is title
length. It is converted into word vector sequence
[e1, e2, ..., eM ] via a word embedding matrix.

The second layer is a CNN network (Kim,
2014). Local contexts are important for under-
standing news titles. For example, in the news title
“90th Birthday of Mickey mouse”, the local con-
texts of “mouse” such as “Mickey” is useful for
inferring it is a comic character name. Thus, we
use CNN to learn contextual word representations
by capturing local contexts. The CNN layer takes
the word vectors as input, and outputs the contex-
tual word representations [c1, c2, ..., cM ].

The third layer is an attention network. Differ-
ent words in the same news title may have differ-
ent importance in representing news. For example,
in the first news of Fig. 1, the word “Rockets” is
more informative than “over” for news representa-
tion. Thus, we propose to use attention mechanism
to select important words in news titles to learn in-
formative news representations. Denote the atten-
tion weight of the ith word in a news title as αti:

ati = q
T
t tanh(Vt × cti + vt), (1)

αti =
exp(ati)∑M
j=1 exp(a

t
j)
, (2)

where Vt and vt are parameters, qt is the atten-
tion query vector. The final representation of a
news title is the summation of the contextual rep-
resentations of its words weighted by their atten-
tion weight, i.e., r =

∑M
i=1 α

t
ici.

User Encoder. The user encoder module is
used to learn the representations of users from the
representations of their browsed news. Different
news browsed by the same user may have differ-
ent informativeness for representing this user. For
example, the news “The best movies in 2018” is
more informative than the news “Winter storms
next week” in inferring user interests. Therefore,
we apply a news attention network to select im-
portant news to learn more informative user repre-
sentations. Denote the attention weight of the ith
browsed news as αni :

ani = q
T
n tanh(Vn × ri + vn), (3)

αni =
exp(ani )∑N
j=1 exp(a

n
j )
, (4)

where qn, Vn and vn are the parameters, and N
is the number of browsed news. The final repre-



1156

sentation of a user is the summation of the repre-
sentations of her browsed news weighted by their
attentions, i.e., u =

∑N
i=1 α

n
i ri.

Click Predictor. The click predictor module is
used to predict the probability of a user clicking
a candidate news based on their hidden represen-
tations. Denote the representation of a candidate
news Dc as rc. Following (Okura et al., 2017), the
click probability score ŷ is calculated by the inner
product of the representation vectors of the user
and the candidate news, i.e., ŷ = uT rc.

Motivated by (Huang et al., 2013), we propose
to use negative sampling techniques for model
training. For each news browsed by a user (de-
noted as positive sample), we randomly sample
K news displayed in the same impression but
not click by this user as negative samples. We
then jointly predict the click probability scores of
the positive news ŷ+ and the K negative news
[ŷ−1 , ŷ

−
2 , ..., ŷ

−
K ]. In this way, we formulate the

news click prediction problem as a pseudo K +1-
way classification task. The posterior click proba-
bility of a positive sample is calculated as follows:

pi =
exp(ŷ+i )

exp(ŷ+i ) +
∑K

j=1 exp(ŷ
−
i,j)

. (5)

The loss function for news recommendation is
the negative log-likelihood of all positive samples:

LNewsRec = −
∑
i∈S

log(pi), (6)

where S is the set of positive training samples.

2.2 Topic-Aware News Encoder

The topic information of news is useful for news
recommendation. For example, if a user browses
many news with the topic “sport”, then she may
be interested in sports. Thus, exploiting the news
topics has the potential to improve the representa-
tions of news and users. However, not all news in
online news platforms contain topic labels, since
it is very costly and time-consuming to annotate
the massive news emerging everyday. Thus, in-
stead of incorporating news topics as model in-
put, we propose to learn topic-aware news encoder
which can extract topic information from news ti-
tles by jointly training it with an auxiliary news
topic classification task, as shown in Fig. 3. We
propose a news topic classification model for this
task, which consists of a news encoder module
and a topic predictor module. The news encoder

module is shared with the news recommendation
model. The topic predictor is used to predict the
topic probability distribution from news represen-
tation as follows:

t̂ = softmax(Wt × r+ bt), (7)

where Wt and bt are parameters, and t̂ is the pre-
dicted topic distribution. The loss function of the
topic classification task is formulated as follows:

LTopic = −
1

Nt

Nt∑
i=1

Kc∑
k=1

ti,k log(t̂i,k), (8)

where Nt is the number of news with topic labels,
Kc is the number of topic categories, and ti,k and
t̂i,k are the gold and predicted probability of the
ith news in the k-th topic category.

We jointly train the news recommendation and
topic classification tasks. The overall loss function
is a weighted summation of the news recommen-
dation and topic classification losses:

L = LNewsRec + λLTopic, (9)

where λ is a positive coefficient. Since the news
recommendation and the topic classification tasks
share the same news encoder, via joint training,
the news recommendation model can capture the
topic information to learn topic-aware news and
user representations for news recommendation.

3 Experiments

3.1 Datasets and Experimental Settings
We conducted experiments on a real-world dataset
which is collected from MSN News1 logs in one
month (from 12/13/2018 to 01/12/2019). The ba-
sic statistics of this dataset are summarized in Ta-
ble 1. In addition, the topic distributions in our
dataset are illustrated in Fig. 4. We used the logs in
the last week for test, and the rest for training. Be-
sides, we randomly sampled 10% of training data
as the validation set.

In our experiments, word embeddings are 300-
dimensional and were initialized by the pre-
trained Glove embedding (Pennington et al.,
2014). The CNN network has 400 filters, and their
window sizes are 3. The negative sampling ratio
K is 4 and the coefficient λ is 0.2. Adam (Kingma
and Ba, 2014) is used as the optimization algo-
rithm, and the batch size is 64. These hyperpa-
rameters were selected according to the valida-
tion set. The metrics used for result evaluation
in our experiments include AUC, MRR, nDCG@5
and nDCG@10. We repeated each experiment 10
times and reported the average results.

3.2 Performance Evaluation

We evaluate the performance of our TANR ap-
proach by comparing it with several baseline
methods, including: (1) LibFM (Rendle, 2012), a
feature based matrix factorization method for rec-
ommendation; (2) CNN (Kim, 2014), using Kim
CNN to learn news representations from news ti-
tles, and building user representations via max
pooling; (3) DSSM (Huang et al., 2013), using
the deep structured semantic model by regarding
the concatenation of browsed news titles as the
query and candidate news as the documents; (4)
Wide&Deep (Cheng et al., 2016), a combination
of a wide linear channel and a deep neural net-
work channel; (5) DeepFM (Guo et al., 2017), a
combination of factorization machines and neural
networks; (6) DFM (Lian et al., 2018), a deep fu-

sion model by combining dense layers with dif-
ferent depths and using attention mechanism to
select important features; (7) GRU (Okura et al.,
2017), using autoencoders to learn news represen-
tations and using a GRU network to learn user rep-
resentations; (8) DKN (Wang et al., 2018), a neu-
ral news recommendation method which can uti-
lize entity information in knowledge graphs via
a knowledge-aware CNN; (9) TANR-basic, our
basic neural news recommendation model; (10)
TANR, our approach with topic-aware news rep-
resentations. The results of different methods are
summarized in Table 2.

From Table 2, We have several observations.
First, the methods based on neural networks (e.g.,
CNN, DSSM and TANR) outperform LibFM. This
is because neural networks can learn better news
and user representations than traditional matrix
factorization methods. Second, both TANR-basic
and TANR can outperform many baseline methods.
This is because our approaches can select impor-
tant words and news for learning informative news
and user representations via a hierarchical atten-
tion network, which is not considered in baseline
methods. Third, TANR consistently outperforms
TANR-basic. It validates the news topics are use-
ful for news recommendation, and our approach
can effectively exploit the topic information.

Then, we want to evaluate the performance of
our approach in topic classification. The perfor-
mance in Fscore over each topic category is shown
in Fig. 5. From Fig. 5, we find the classification
of most topic classes is satisfactory, except for the
class “kids”. This may be because the training data
in this class is too scarce and difficult to be recog-
nized. These results show that our approach can
capture useful topic information by training the
news encoder with an auxiliary topic classification
task to learn topic-aware news representations.

3.3 Effectiveness of Hierarchical Attention

We conducted experiments to explore the hierar-
chical attentions in our approach. The results are
shown in Fig. 6. We find the news-level atten-
tion network can effectively improve the perfor-
mance of our approach. This is because differ-
ent news usually have different informativeness in
representing users, and selecting important news
can help learn more informative user representa-
tions. In addition, the word-level attention net-
work is also useful. This is because different
words usually have different importance for rep-
resenting news, and our approach can select im-
portant words to learn informative news represen-
tations. Moreover, combining both attention net-
works can further improve the performance of our
approach. These results validate the effectiveness
of hierarchical attentions in our approach.

3.4 Influence of Hyperparameter

In this section, we explore the influence of the co-
efficient λ in Eq. (9) on our approach. It controls
the relative importance of the topic classification
task. The results are shown in Fig. 7. We find if
λ is too small, the performance of our approach

Figure 7: Influence of the hyperparameter λ.

is not optimal, since the useful topic information
is not fully exploited. Thus, the performance im-
proves when λ increases from 0. However, when
λ becomes too large, the performance of our ap-
proach declines. This is because the topic classi-
fication task is over-emphasized and the news rec-
ommendation task is not fully respected. A mod-
erate value of λ (e.g., 0.2) is the most appropriate.

4 Conclusion

In this paper, we propose a neural news recom-
mendation approach with topic-aware news rep-
resentations. In our approach we propose a new
encoder to learn news representations from news
titles, and use attention network to select impor-
tant words. In addition, we propose to train a
topic-aware news encoder via jointly training it
with an auxiliary topic classification task to ex-
tract the topic information in news. In addition,
we propose a user encoder to learn representations
of users from their browsed news, and use atten-
tion network to select important news. Extensive
experiments on a real-world dataset validate the
effectiveness of our approach.
