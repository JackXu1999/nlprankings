Abstract 

This report describes a novel approach to 
modified re-synthesis, by concatenation of 
speech from different speakers. The system 
removes an initial voiceless plosive from one 
utterance, recorded from a child, and replaces 
it with another voiceless plosive selected from 
a database of recordings of other child speak-
ers. Preliminary results from a listener evalua-
tion are reported. 

1 Background 

Modified re-synthesis of recorded speech can be 
used for different purposes. For example, modi-
fication through linear predictive coding (LPC) 
parameter manipulation has been used to create 
ambiguous realizations of speech sounds for ex-
periments of categorical perception, and to create 
extrapolated realizations of speech sounds to ex-
aggerate the difference between two phonemes 
(Protopapas, 1998). A similar technique has also 
been used to generate “corrected” versions of 
children’s deviant /r/ productions (Shuster, 1998). 
Here, children and adolescents listened to re-
cordings of themselves and of other children, 
where half of the words were incorrectly pro-
duced, and the other half “corrected” by LPC 
parameter modification. For each word, the chil-
dren judged the correctness of the /r/ and the 
identity of the speaker. However, as manipula-
tions were done manually, there was a time span 
of 1-2 weeks between recording of the children 
and listening, and this gap could partly explain 
the difficulties the children had recognizing their 
own recordings. Thus, in order to fully under-
stand how children (or adults) react to hearing 
corrected versions of their recorded incorrect 
speech, corrective re-synthesis should preferably 
be done in real-time.  

A method for re-synthesizing segmentally 
modified versions of recorded speech could be 
valuable not only in speech and language inter-
vention for children with deviant speech, but 
could also be used e.g. in second language learn-
ing. However, for these purposes, the technique 
must not only allow modification and re-
synthesis of recorded speech in real-time, but the 
generated speech must also be conceivable reali-
zations of speech that might have been produced 
by the recorded speaker himself/herself. In ear-
lier studies involving re-synthesized speech, 
characteristics other than naturalness and preser-
vation of perceived speaker identity have been 
prioritized, e.g. controlling intonation and syl-
labic rhythm (Ramus & Mehler, 1999) and in-
creasing intelligibility of poorly articulated 
speech (Kain et al, 2007). In these studies, re-
synthesis was done through diphone synthesis 
and formant synthesis, respectively. If natural-
ness and preservation of speaker identity are pri-
oritized, however, other synthesis methods are 
better suited. 

The present study describes a novel approach 
to modified re-synthesis of phonemic segments, 
by standard methods of unit selection and con-
catenative synthesis, but where the concatenated 
speech segments come from different speakers. 
The purpose of the study was to find out if this 
re-synthesis method can be used to generate 
natural and comprehensible speech. 

2 Method 

2.1 Speech data 

A corpus of recordings of 74 children producing 
one word utterances was used as a speech data-
base. The recording script used for all children 
contained 19 words, with 10 beginning with /kV/ 
and the other 9 beginning with /tV/ (see Appen-
dix). The recorded children were 4 to 9 years old.

60 of the children had normal speech and 14 of 
the children were diagnosed with phonological 
impairment (PI), and had problems with deviant 
production of either /k/ or /t/, which were often 
produced as [t] or [k], respectively. 

The recordings were made at different schools 
and pre-schools, and always took place in a sepa-
rate room with limited noise. All recordings were 
made by a Sennheiser m@b 40 headset, using a 
16-kHz sampling rate and 16-bit resolution.  

The total number of utterances in the speech 
corpus was 1406 utterances. 132 of these were 
produced by the children with PI and judged by 
the author as having a deviant initial plosive. 

2.2 Preparation of speech data 

All data in the speech corpus was segmented and 
aligned with the HMM-based nAlign (Sjölander, 
2003). A concatenation position was defined at 
the middle of the first vowel in the utterance. At 
this position, three sets of acoustic features were 
extracted: F0, log power and MFCCs (13 Mel-
Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients).  

2.3 Unit selection 

The task for the unit selector was to find an ini-
tial segment ui-1 in the speech database that 
would best match a given remainder segment ui. 
The concatenation cost Cc between these seg-
ments was calculated as follows (Hunt & Black, 
1996):

Three sub-costs Cj were used in the unit selection 
(i.e. q = 3):   

• Euclidean distance (Taylor, 2008) in F0 

• Euclidean distance in log power 

• Mahalanobis distance (Taylor, 2008) for 
the MFCCs 

Different weights wj were assigned to the differ-
ent sub-costs. These weights were derived from a 
weight optimization procedure (described below). 
High penalties were given to combinations of 
segments where the vowel in ui-1 did not match 
the vowel in ui, to avoid combinations of mis-
matching vowels. The segment ui-1 with the low-
est concatenation cost was then selected from the 
speech corpus as the optimal segment for con-
catenation with ui. 

2.4 Concatenation  

Concatenation positions in ui and ui-1 were ad-
justed to the zero-crossings closest to the middle 
of the vowel (within a range of 15 samples be-
fore or after), where the direction of the slope 
(negative or positive) was the same for ui and ui-1, 
to preserve wave continuation. 

2.5 Weight optimization 

15 original recordings were held out from the 
speech corpus and used as training material. To 
arrive at an optimal set of weights for the sub-
costs for F0, log power and MFCC distance, a 
weight space search (Hunt & Black, 1996) was 
performed. Three different values were at-
tempted for the different weights, in all possible 
combinations (33 = 27). For each weight set, the 
15 training utterances were re-synthesized with 
the best fitting initial segment in the speech cor-
pus. (The initial segments in the training material 
were never eligible for selection.)  

The Mel-Cepstral Distance (MCD; Kubichek, 
1993) was used as an objective measure of the 
difference between synthesized utterances and 
training utterances. MCD was calculated frame-
by-frame, as follows (for the frame k):

where MCx(i,k) and MCy(i,k) are the i

th Mel-
Cepstral coefficients of the vowel in the synthe-
sized and the original (training) utterance, re-
spectively. As the remainder part of the synthe-
sized utterances is always identical to the re-
mainder part of the training utterances, MCD 
was only calculated for the vowel part of the ut-
terances. When the number of frames in the syn-
thesized vowel and the training vowel was dif-
ferent, comparison was only performed up to the 
last frame of the shortest segment. An average 
MCD was calculated for all frames in the vowel 
to represent the difference between the synthe-
sized utterance and the training utterance. The 
weight set that generated the set of synthesized 
utterances that were most similar to the set of 
training utterances was then selected as the opti-
mal weight set. 

2.6 Evaluation 

A listening script of 60 stimuli was generated 
automatically, without supervision, from the 
speech corpus, with the restriction that 20 stimuli

were original recordings (10 normal and 10 devi-
ant), and 40 stimuli were modified. In all modi-
fied stimuli, the initial consonant was replaced 
by a different initial consonant (/t/ for /k/ and 
vice versa). Through this re-synthesis, 20 of the 
modified stimuli were “corrected” and 20 were 
“impaired”. An online listening test was con-
structed to first present 3 training stimuli, and 
then the 60 stimuli in random order (different for 
different listeners). The task for the listeners was 
to report what they heard (by typing) and to 
judge whether the stimulus was an original re-
cording or a modified recording. 38 adult listen-
ers participated in the experiment. 

3 Results 

As a measure of intelligibility of the stimuli, the 
listeners’ identification accuracy of the initial 
consonants was used. (As half of the stimuli 
were produced with deviant speech, and as such, 
most often nonsense words, inconsistency in the 
listeners’ spelling was expected. Therefore, only 
the initial consonant was regarded in the analy-
sis.) Inter-rater agreement of the listeners’ per-
ception of the initial consonants was measured 
by Fleiss’ kappa at 0.64. Figure 1 shows that 
original deviant consonants are ambiguous to the 
listeners, whereas for all other stimulus types, the 
identification accuracy is around 80% or higher. 

As a measure of naturalness, the listeners’ 
judgment of whether a stimulus was an original 
or a modified recording was used. Here, inter-  

rater agreement was measured by Fleiss’ kappa 
at 0.13. As shown in Table 1, 62% of the synthe-
sized stimuli were perceived as original re-
cordings. For comparison, 24% of the original 
recordings were actually perceived as modified.

4 Discussion 

The finding that around 80-90% of the synthe-
sized stimuli are perceived correctly (by their 
initial consonant) indicates that the generated 
speech is intelligible. For the intended use with 
children with deviant speech, the difference in 
consonant identification accuracy between origi-
nal deviant recordings and corrected re-
synthesized recordings is perhaps the most inter-
esting. Whereas the listeners’ perception of the 
initial consonants in original deviant recordings 
is quite equivocal, corrected re-synthesized re-
cordings are perceived as much less ambiguous. 
This suggests that correction by re-synthesis 
could be a way of generating unambiguous 
speech targets for children with deviant speech.

Most of the modified stimuli were perceived as 
original recordings. This finding, together with 
the low degree of agreement between the lis-
teners (Fleiss’ kappa at 0.13), are indications 
that it was difficult for the listeners to distin-
guish between original and modified stimuli. 
Thus, it is indeed possible to generate natural 
speech by concatenating speech from different 
speakers. But even if listeners were able to 
detect that an utterance has been modified, it is 
not clear whether this is really a problem in the 
intended use with children with deviant speech, 
assuming that the generated speech is still in-
telligible.  

An additional conclusion that can be drawn 
from the results in this study is that quite good 
results can be achieved with recordings of sub-
optimal quality. The recordings in this study 
were all done with rather simple recording 
equipment, and in naturalistic settings, rather 
than in a sound-proof studio. As these are con-
ditions one could expect in a clinical setting, 
the technique (together with the speech corpus) 
could easily be implemented into a speech and 
language therapy tool. Such a tool would allow 
the generation of speech production targets 
that are tailor-made for each individual child, 
and for each individual utterance. Assumably, 
this would be a valuable resource in speech 
and language therapy.
