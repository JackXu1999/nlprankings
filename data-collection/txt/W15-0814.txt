Abstract

We describe a system for event extraction
across documents and languages. We devel-
oped a framework for the interoperable se-
mantic interpretation of mentions of events,
participants, locations and time, as well as
the relations between them. Furthermore, we
use a common RDF model to represent in-
stances of events and normalised entities and
dates. We convert multiple mentions of the
same event in English, Spanish and Dutch to a
single representation. We thus resolve cross-
document event and entity coreference within
a language but also across languages. We
tested our system on a Wikinews corpus of
120 English articles that have been manually
translated to Spanish and Dutch. We report
on the cross-lingual cross-document event and
entity extraction comparing the Spanish and
Dutch output with respect to English.

1 Introduction

News reports on events in the world. Applying event
extraction to many different news articles provides
an interesting perspective on event-coreference, as-
suming that different sources in different languages
report on the same events. These texts may partially
provide the same and partly different information
on these events. To deal with cross-document event
coreference, it is necessary to make a formal differ-
ence between the mentions of an event in text and its
representation as single event instance. Ideally, we
want to be able to match event descriptions within
a text, across texts and across languages into a sin-
gle representation. The fact that different sources

provide different information opens new perspec-
tives to study the role of these sources in reporting
on what happened in the world. When we consider
news written in different languages this perspective
becomes more complex but also more interesting.

For such a cross-document and cross-lingual per-
spective it is essential to define a semantically inter-
operable approach that can handle the large variation
of event expressions within and across languages.
In this paper, we report on a system to derive in-
teroperable event representations across documents
and across languages. In particular, we focus on En-
glish, Spanish and Dutch. Firstly, we developed Nat-
ural Language Processing (NLP) pipelines for inter-
preting mentions of events and event components in
text in a uniform way and, secondly, we developed
a method to derive instance representations for these
interpretations in RDF that is agnostic for the lin-
guistic forms of expression. We report on the eval-
uation of the systems on a publicly available corpus
of English Wikinews articles that has been translated
to Spanish and Dutch. We show the capability of
our framework and system to perform cross-lingual
event extraction from multiple documents, which is,
to our knowledge, the first in its kind.

This paper is further structured as follows. In sec-
tion 2, we describe relevant related work and in sec-
tion 3, we describe our approach to aggregate event
information across different mentions in RDF. In
section 4, we explain the interoperability of the NLP
pipelines in the three languages. The conversion of
the NLP output to RDF is then explained in section
5. Finally, we present the evaluation results in sec-
tion 6 and we conclude in section 7.

In Unstructured Information Management Architec-
ture (UIMA) (Ferrucci and Lally, 2004) interoper-
ability is provided by platform independent data rep-
resentations and interfaces. Information is repre-
sented in the Common Analysis Structure (CAS). In
CAS, annotations are defined as typed objects. For
each type, a set of features is defined and an is-a
relation with its supertype from which features are
inherited. The Subject of Analysis (Sofa) method is
used to allow for multiple annotations of the same
object. UIMA uses a layered stand-off representa-
tion for the annotations of text. A similar approach
is followed in the OntoNotes project (Pradhan et al.,
2007). In OntoNotes multiple layers of annotation
defined in a relational database are combined to ar-
rive at semantic interpretations. Both approaches
focus on the generic annotation of text. Howewer,
they do not specifically focus on the representation
of events and they do not present events according to
an RDF model independently of the text as a natural
way of cross-document event representation.

The idea of using Linked Data and RDF to rep-
resent linguistic annotations for achieving interop-
erability among linguistic resources has been dis-
cussed previously (Chiarcos et al., 2012). Follow-
ing Linked Data and RDF principles provides a
way to address conceptual interoperability among
resources, i.e. the ability of heterogeneous NLP
resources and tools to talk and understand each
other. (Ide et al., 2003) explicitly mention RDF
as a possible format to provide semantic coher-
ence in representations. The NLP2RDF initiative
collects a number of efforts for representing NLP
related information in RDF, including notable ef-
forts such as Ontologies for Linguistic Annotation
(OLiA) (Chiarcos, 2008). FRED (Presutti et al.,
2012) also produces automatically RDF/OWL and
linked data from natural language sentences, but its
output is currently limited to English. Still, to our
knowledge, there are relatively few implementations
of RDF-compatible annotation formats that are ac-
tively used or produced by NLP modules. Notable
exceptions are the NLP Interchange Format (NIF)
(Hellmann et al., 2013), which is tightly linked to
OLiA, UIMA Clerezza, and the conversion of GrAF
to RDF by (Cassidy, 2010). NIF has the disadvan-

tage that it is not easy to integrate its representations
in NLP tools, as shown by user evaluations (Hell-
mann et al., 2013). Because linguistic annotations
are linked to strings it is furthermore not practical
for representing hierarchical structures. (Fokkens et
al., 2014) presents a more detailed discussion of the
formal representations of linguistic annotations.

Besides the formal representation of NLP output,
our work relates to the representation of events and
cross-document and cross-lingual event coreference.
Cross-document event coreference so far has been
addressed as a task, in which event markables are
related to each other as coreference sets (Bejan and
Harabagiu, 2010; Lee et al., 2012). For instance,
the ECB corpus represents events and coreference
relations using inline annotations in text and cross-
document identifiers with offset references. Repre-
sentation and evaluation of cross-document event-
coreference is often done using scorers that use
the CONLL-2011 format for expressing coreference
(Pradhan et al., 2011). This format also exploits
a simple token representation and identifiers. To
the best of our knowledge, nobody really addressed
the semantic representation of events as instances,
exploiting interoperable semantic representations of
event instances and entity instances according to Se-
mantic Web practices.

3 The representation of event mentions
and instances

Events can be defined as situations in the world in
which certain entities participate, where this partic-
ipation relation is bound in time and place. In text,
we make reference to these events in many different
ways. Each time we refer to an event in text, the
expression through which we make reference can be
seen as a mention of the event that we consider to be
an instance of a mental representation or real-world
event. Typically, there is a coreference relation be-
tween different mentions of the same event instance.

In many cases, mentions that refer to events are
partial, i.e. not all the details about an event are
given within a single sentence. For example, the
next sentences from a Wikinews1 article make ref-
erence to a single flight but the details are given in

1http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/A380_makes_
maiden_flight_to_US

109



different expressions:

A380 makes maiden flight to US. March 19, 2007.

The Airbus A380, the world’s largest passenger

plane, was set to land in the United States of Amer-

ica on Monday after a test flight. One of the A380s

is flying from Frankfurt to Chicago via New York;

the airplane will be carrying about 500 people.

The main event is the test flight which is mentioned
in the title, at the end of the first sentence and re-
ferred to again in the second sentence as flying. The
carrying is a subevent of the main event, whereas
one could argue whether landing is a subevent or a
following event. The date of the event is given in the
first sentence (Monday), which refers to March 19,
2007, the flight route is given in the second sentence
and passengers are mentioned in the last clause: 500
people through the implicit relation between carry-
ing and flying.

Depending if carrying and landing are different
events, we have in this example 5 mentions of 3
unique events. To aggregate the information for
the flight event, we need to resolve coreference and
combine the information from each coreferential
mention into a single representation for the instance.
To connect the mentions to the instance represen-
tation, we use the Grounded Annotation Frame-
work (GAF) (Fokkens et al., 2013). Within GAF,
instances are represented according to the Simple
Event Model (SEM) (van Hage et al., 2011) using a
unique URI and relations to actors, places and time.
Furthermore, we use the gaf:denotedBy relation to
point to the offset mentions of the event in the text.
When applied to the above example, the event in-
stance for the flight would be represented as follows,
where we abstract from the specific roles of the ac-
tors and places:
:ev17Flight
rdfs:label "maiden flight", "test flight", "flying" ;
gaf:denotedBy
wikinews:A380_makes_maiden_flight_to_US#char=19,25,
wikinews:A380_makes_maiden_flight_to_US#char=174,180,
wikinews:A380_makes_maiden_flight_to_US#char=202,208;

sem:hasTime wikinews:20070319;
sem:hasActor dbp:Airbus_A380, wikinews:500_people;
sem:hasPlace dbp:United_States, dbp:Frankfurt, dbp:Chicago,
dbp:New_York.

Each of the actors, places and points in time is rep-
resented as an entity instance as well, with pointers
to the mentions in the text. Below, we show the rep-
resentation of Airbus as an example with 2 mentions
in the same document:

dbp:Airbus
rdfs:label "Airbus A380", "A380" ;
gaf:denotedBy
wikinews:A380_makes_maiden_flight_to_US#char=415,421,
wikinews:A380_makes_maiden_flight_to_US#char=1132,1138.

In this example, the actors, places and time points
are aggregated from different mentions in a single
representation. If another text is processed, we may
detect more mentions of the same event and the same
entities. In principle, this will lead to the same in-
stance representation for the event where we only
need to extend the gaf:denotedBy relations to the
new mentions and if it happens aggregate more rela-
tions to other entities.

A380 commercial route proving. 19-28 March

2007. Watch the A380 as it makes its first landings

in the United States as part of a 12-day commercial

route proving mission in 2007, performed in con-

junction with Lufthansa. Follow the aircraft as it

flies to New York, Chicago and Washington, D.C.,

as well as Hong Kong, Frankfurt and Munich.

This message partially overlaps with the previous
one but also describes more stops on the route of
the airplane. Establishing coreference across the two
flights and the A380 results in a single event instance
combining the data and pointing to different men-
tions across the two articles:
:ev17Flight
rdfs:label "maiden flight", "test flight", "flying", "flies" ;
gaf:denotedBy

wikinews:A380_makes_maiden_flight_to_US#char=19,25,
wikinews:A380_makes_maiden_flight_to_US#char=174,180,
wikinews:A380_makes_maiden_flight_to_US#char=202,208,

sem:hasPlace dbp:United_States, dbp:Frankfurt,

dbp:Chicago, dbp:New_York, dbp:Washington_D.C.,
dbp:Hong_Kong; dbp:Munich.

Obviously, many similar events are reported which,
however, do not refer to the same event instance.
Consider the next news item2 that reports on another
maiden flight of the Airbus A380 in 2008:

Qantas A380 arrives in LA after maiden flight. Oc-

tober 21, 2008. The first flight of an Airbus A380

by Qantas touched down in Los Angeles today, in-

augurating the Australian carrier’s service using the

world’s biggest commercial jet.

This flight involves a similar participant, Airbus
A380 and a different location: Los Angeles. The

main and only distinguishing feature is the date that
makes it a different event from the previous exam-
ple. Hence, it will get a different instance represen-
tation:
:ev18Flight
rdfs:label "maiden flight", "flight";
gaf:denotedBy

sem:hasTime wikinews:20081021;

sem:hasPlace dbp:United_States, dbp:Los_Angeles.

The above model allows us to combine the informa-
tion across different mentions within and across doc-
uments of the same language. However, the model
is also agnostic of the language in which the infor-
mation is expressed. Likewise, we can use the same
model to represent the information from texts in dif-
ferent languages. In order to achieve that, the pro-
cessing of text across these languages needs to be
semantically interoperable. Since we defined events
as combinations of actions (or relations and prop-
erties), actors, places and time, we also need to
achieve an interoperable interpretation of these el-
ements across languages. This will be discussed in
the next section.

4 The interoperable interpretation of event
and entity mentions across languages

Detecting mentions of events, entities and time ex-
pressions in text in several languages requires the
combination of various Natural Language Process-
ing modules. Our framework and system obtains in-
teroperable representations of the interpretation of
events, the entities that play a role within these
events as well as the time expressions associated
to the events. The output of the language specific
pipelines is represented in the Natural Language
Processing Format (NAF) (Fokkens et al., 2014).
NAF is a standoff layered format for many different
annotations, such as tokens, entities, semantic role
(SR) structures and time expressions, where the el-
ements in the layers point to spans of terms. In the
next examples, we show in NAF entities, a SR struc-
ture with a predicate and several of its roles, and a
time expression for an English text. Each of the ele-
ments has a span element pointing to term identifiers
that mark words and phrases in the text. We see in
the first structure that the expression United States is
detected as a named entity of the type LOCATION

and is disambiguated to a DBpedia entry.3 The SR
element consists of a predicate and roles, where the
predicate has references to various FrameNet frames
(Baker et al., 1998) and WordNet synsets (Fellbaum,
1998) along with the predicate information included
in the Predicate Matrix (Lacalle et al., 2014). The
roles have a PropBank role (Palmer et al., 2005) and
possibly one or more FrameNet elements.4 Finally,
the time expression Monday has been normalised by
reference to a particular date.

First of all, note that the entity in Spanish and Dutch
has been linked to the language-specific DBpedia
URI but also to the cross-lingual and equivalent URI
in English. In the SR layer, we see that predicates
in Spanish and Dutch are matched with FrameNet
frames and Wordnet synsets just as for the English
SR structure. We can thus derive a similar SR struc-
ture across the three languages in the same way as
we can map the DBpedia entity referenced to by the
named entity expressions.5 Finally, we can see that
the time expressions detected have been normalised
in the same way.

A similar output is generated for the all 120 news
articles in the Wikinews corpus across different doc-
uments and languages.6 In the next section, we
explain how this output is converted into a unified
RDF-SEM structure.

5 Event coreference across mentions

The NAF representations explained in the previ-
ous sections represent the cross-lingual and cross-
document interoperable interpretation of entity,
predicate and time mentions in text. In this section,
we explain how we convert them to an RDF format
using the SEM/GAF model. As explained in section

5Note that the English and Spanish predicate is aligned to
multiple synsets, whereas the Dutch predicate only got a single
synset assigned. This difference is the result of the different
ways in which the SR modules have been implemented.

6On-line demos of the pipelines are available at http://
www.newsreader-project.eu/results/demos/

3, different mentions of the same instance are repre-
sented only once. For entities and time expressions
this is automatically achieved by the normalisation
to DBpedia URIs and dates. When converting each
mention of an entity or time expression to RDF, we
create an URI on the basis of its normalised value.
Within the RDF model, these data structures are au-
tomatically merged and the references to the men-
tions are combined, both for cross-document refer-
ences and the cross-language references.

Obviously, for events this is more difficult. We
follow an approach that takes the compositionally
of events as a starting point (Quine, 1985). The
compositionality principle dictates that events are
not just defined by the action but also by the time,
place and participants. For that, we use an algo-
rithm that compares events for all these properties
(Cybulska and Vossen, 2015). Currently, we com-
pare first the events on the basis of the lemma of
the predicates, the FrameNet frames and the Word-
net synsets.7 From a cross-lingual perspective, it
only makes sense to compare events according to
language-neutral classes in FrameNet and WordNet.

The second important element is the time-
reference. We relate all event mentions to time-
expressions in the text, where we first consider the
references in the same sentence, next the surround-
ing sentences (2 before, 1 after the current one) and
finally the publication date of the news article. We
then only compare events anchored to the same tem-
poral reference.

Finally, note that the entity layer and the role layer
are only indirectly aligned through their span refer-
ences. Since the layers are generated by different
software modules, we need to determine the expres-
sion in a role that is attributed to an entity in the
entity layer. We match the output of the layers by
intersecting the spans by calculating the Dice coef-
ficient of the content words in each entity mention
with the role mention. If the overlap is more than
75%, we assign the role to the entity. To be able
to represent matching events through a shared URI
across languages, we create an artificial URI from
the set of WordNet synsets that were associated with
the predicates in the SR from which they are de-

7In fact, the Predicate Matrix provides many other mappings
that could be used, such as PropBank, NomBank, VerbNet or
SUMO

rived. If predicates from different languages have
been matched with intersecting synsets, we consider
the actions to be similar. Note that this can be loos-
ened to other similarity measures. In addition to
event similarity, time and participants need to match
in the same way as described for the cross-document
case described before.

Below, we show the result of applying our cross-
lingual and cross-document event extraction module
to the Airbus A380 article in the three languages.
Our current program creates two flying events from
the first sentences. The first event is represented by
a series of five WordNet synsets all related to fly-
ing. We see a series of RDF subclass relations for
this event to various FrameNet frames. We also see

lopen and vliegen.8 Next, we see mentions from all
three language texts and finally the aggregated re-
lations. Some of these are detected as places and
some as actors. Furthermore, we see some entities
not matched to DBpedia for various reasons, such as
Chicago via New York and Los Angeles LAX com-
ing from the Dutch processing. We can also observe
that some places are detected as actors in the SR,
with roles such as A3 or A4 instead of AM-DIR or
AM-LOC. The same event was detected across the
three languages and the relations have been merged
in a single representation. The basis for the final
merging is the fact that the events share WordNet
references, all of them bound to the same point in
time and also share at least one actor and place.

The complete system for processing text in
English, Spanish and Dutch, as well the cross-
document and cross-language coreference are avail-
able under an open source license and accessible
through GitHub.9 In the next section, we provide
an initial evaluation of the cross-lingual processing.

6 Evaluation on the cross-lingual Wiki
news corpus

We created an evaluation corpus from English
Wikinews articles. We selected four different top-
ics Airbus, Apple, GM-Chrysler-Ford and the stock
market. For each topic, we selected 30 articles
spread over a period of five years. The English cor-
pus was manually annotated for various layers, in-
cluding entities, events, time-expressions, event re-
lations, and coreference relations. We translated the
corpora also to Spanish and Dutch, where the sen-
tences have been aligned.10 The cross-lingual cor-
pora allow for two types of evaluation: 1) we can
evaluate the quality of the NLP modules in each lan-
guage on each corpus, 2) we can apply the RDF-
SEM extraction to the NAF output of each corpus
independently and compare these structures. Cur-
rently, we report on the second evaluation. In the
near future, we also plan to evaluate against the an-
notations in each language and across languages.

Since the corpora are manually translated, we ex-
pect that the same content is expressed in the three
languages. Thus, if our cross-lingual NLP process-
ing is fully interoperable and generates the same
quality across the languages, we expect to obtain ex-
actly the same events across the different languages.
As such the translated corpus provides an excellent

ing to similar guidelines and cross-document coreference rela-
tions are added.

benchmark dataset for evaluating event extraction
across languages. For the evaluation, we applied
the pipelines for English, Spanish and Dutch to all
120 articles in each language. Next, we extracted
the RDF representations from the NAF files in each
topic. Since the final RDF representation is agnos-
tic with respect to its textual realisation in the differ-
ent languages, we can directly compare the extracted
representations. In Table 1, we show the results av-
eraged over the four different topics, where we com-
pare the output from the Spanish and Dutch systems
to the English output as a reference.11

Table 1: Cross-lingual coverage of Spanish and Dutch
RDF data compared to English.

Table 1 provides figures for the DBpedia entities, the
events represented as WordNet synsets and triples
where entities are related to the events either as ac-
tors or as places. For each language, we present the
number of instances (I, unique URIs in the data) and
the number of mentions (M) in triples. For Span-
ish and Dutch, we provide the overlap (O) and the
micro-averaged coverage (C) of the English men-
tions. For entities, we can see that the mentions de-
tected for Spanish is 34.88% of the English ones,
while for Dutch this is 24.46%. We also see that de-
tecting events and triples (which are combinations of
events, entities and a SEM relation) is more difficult.
Spanish coverage of the English events is 26.04%
for events and only 7.07% coverage for full triples.
In general, the Dutch system is performing less com-
pared to Spanish. Obvious explanations for this be-
haviour are the different performance of the Spanish
and Dutch pipelines, and the different coverage of
the resources (both DBpedias and wordnets). As ex-
pected, the drop for the events and triples is bigger
compared to entities. Detecting events correctly is
more complex and challenging than disambiguating
DBpedia references. Also recall that the comparison
of events and triples is based on WordNet equiva-
lences.

11Note that output that does not match with English is not
necessarily incorrect. We are only measuring the coverage of
one language with respect to the English data.

Table 2: Entities most frequent in English data

We also inspected the results for the Airbus cor-
pus by looking at the entities and events that are
most frequently mentioned in the English output.
Table 2 shows the top-frequent entities with the cor-
responding counts for Spanish and Dutch. We in-
spected obvious entities such as Indonesia, France
and Toulouse. It turns out that the NLP mod-
ules did detect these entities: Indonesia (8 Span-
ish and 9 Dutch mentions), France (13 Spanish and
11 Dutch mentions), Toulouse (6 Spanish and 4
Dutch mentions) but that they were not linked to
events and therefore not represented. This points
to a difference and probably lower coverage of the
semantic role module to connect entities to events
in a uniform way. Another case is represented
by United States, United States Air Force(s), and
United States dollar. The latter have high frequen-
cies in English but none in Spanish and Dutch, while
the former has even higher frequencies in Dutch. In
this case, the English system makes a systematic
mistake by not always resolving expressions such
as US to the right URI but to the dollar, while the
other systems do not make this mistake because their
expressions are very distinct: Estados Unidos de
América and de Verenigde Staten van Amerika. A
final type of difference is illustrated by Boeing ver-
sus Boeing 747. Where the English module tends
to prefer more specific entities, the other fall back to
the more generic ones. Such metonymic mismatches
are less of a problem.

Regarding events, the Dutch events are often
linked to other meanings in WordNet that may also
apply (e.g. fly 72 English, 34 Spanish and 8 Dutch
but also buy 10 English, 17 Spanish and 16 Dutch).

Furthermore whereas the English and Spanish mod-
ule often provide more than one synset, the Dutch
system only gives one, lowering the chances to in-
tersect. In a future version, sets of closely related
synsets will be generated for Dutch as well to solve
the fine-grained sense matching problem. Another
option is to fall back on more general event classes
in the PredicateMatrix (e.g. VerbNet, FrameNet,
etc.). Most of the other differences relate to small
differences acorss systems and poor coverage of se-
mantic resources in Spanish and Dutch.

7 Conclusions

We described a system for the cross-document and
cross-lingual event and entity extraction that is
unique in its kind. We use GAF to make a clear
distinction between mentions and instances, where
mentions of events and entities are interpreted ac-
cording to an interoperable RDF framework that
uses URIs, WordNet and FrameNet concepts, nor-
malised time expressions and normalised relations
between entities and events. We developed NLP
pipelines in English, Spanish and Dutch that pro-
cess text according to the shared framework. In ad-
dition, we developed software to convert the output
of the NLP modules to the RDF representation of in-
stances. We showed that we can represent the accu-
mulated information from different articles and even
across languages. We described the first evaluation
results for our system.

The current system leaves room for improve-
ment. The matching of entities across mentions
and languages can be harmonised and the matching
of events through WordNet concepts is not precise
enough. In many cases, the background resources
(DBpedia in different languages and wordnets in dif-
ferent languages) lack the proper mapping. Finally,
the quality of the SR module needs to be improved
to capture more expressions and harmonise the in-
terpretations of these expressions. Nevertheless, the
current work forms an excellent basis to flesh out
these problems without the need to change the fun-
damental cross-lingual architecture. When the trans-
lated corpora are fully annotated, we will be able to
further benchmark the NLP processing in the differ-
ent languages and compare the results in terms of
precision and recall independently of English.
