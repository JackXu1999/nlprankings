Abstract

Spoken language ability is highly heteroge-
neous in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD),
which complicates efforts to identify linguis-
tic markers for use in diagnostic classifica-
tion, clinical characterization, and for research
and clinical outcome measurement. Machine
learning techniques that harness the power of
multivariate statistics and non-linear data anal-
ysis hold promise for modeling this hetero-
geneity, but many models require enormous
datasets, which are unavailable for most psy-
chiatric conditions (including ASD). In lieu of
such datasets, good models can still be built by
leveraging domain knowledge.

In this study, we compare two machine learn-
ing approaches: the first approach incorpo-
rates prior knowledge about language vari-
ation across middle childhood, adolescence,
and adulthood to classify 6-minute naturalis-
tic conversation samples from 140 age- and
IQ-matched participants (81 with ASD), while
the other approach treats all ages the same.
We found that individual age-informed mod-
els were significantly more accurate than a sin-
gle model tasked with building a common al-
gorithm across age groups. Furthermore, pre-
dictive linguistic features differed significantly
by age group, confirming the importance of
considering age-related changes in language
use when classifying ASD. Our results suggest
that limitations imposed by heterogeneity in-
herent to ASD and from developmental change
with age can be (at least partially) overcome
using domain knowledge, such as understand-
ing spoken language development from child-
hood through adulthood.

1 Introduction

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a
neurobiologically-based condition character-
ized by social communication impairments and
restricted, repetitive patterns of behaviors and

interests [1]. Although ASD is a neurodevel-
opmental disorder, it is currently diagnosed
using behavior alone, including spoken language.
For the roughly 70 percent of individuals with
ASD that have average to above-average verbal
abilities [2], language is an important pathway
to social connections. For clinicians and care
providers, spoken language can provide a window
into internal cognitive and social processing.
Given that primary diagnostic tools for ASD often
rely on language-mediated semi-structured inter-
views and play activities to elicit behaviors found
in the condition [3], measuring and quantifying
subtle differences in spoken language between
individuals with ASD and matched typically de-
veloping (TD) controls is important for improving
diagnostic speed and reliability. Furthermore,
since the emergence of spoken language before
age 5 is a critical predictor of later functional
outcomes in ASD [4, 5, 6], characterizing spoken
language development is crucial for understanding
long-term developmental outcomes.

Behavioral heterogeneity in ASD is a persistent
challenge for researchers and clinicians. In fact,
generalizability from one individual to the next
is so low that it is often said, “If you have met
one person with autism, you have met one per-
son with autism”. Wide phenotypic variability has
made it difficult to draw reliable statistical conclu-
sions about ASD, and indeed, has made it chal-
lenging to study the disorder at all [7]. Signifi-
cant variability is similarly present in the verbal
domain, with the spoken language skills of indi-
viduals with ASD ranging from severely impaired
to verbally gifted [8]. As an illustration, a recent
narrative study found that intra-group variability
(ASD alone) was greater than inter-group variabil-
ity (between ASD and TD) [9].

Recent attempts to leverage machine learning
for understanding and classifying individuals with



46

ASD have grappled with this phenotypic variabil-
ity [10, 11]. Unfortunately, many of the most
exciting machine learning models (e.g., models
that are able to capture nonlinear dependencies
across many dimensions), require large, well-
characterized training datasets to function cor-
rectly, which are rare in ASD (and are particu-
larly scarce for children). These two constraints
in ASD research (wide variability in high dimen-
sional spaces, and lack of large datasets), suggest
that it may be useful to proactively incorporate in-
formation that psychiatrists and linguists deem im-
portant, thus guiding machine learning models to
learn relevant dependencies while ignoring irrele-
vant ones.

2 Language in ASD

Prior research suggests that language is a valu-
able metric that can be used to distinguish indi-
viduals with ASD from TD controls. For exam-
ple, the NEPSY narrative retelling test, in which
a child listens to and retells a story while being
evaluated on how many key story elements were
remembered, has been explored for its utility in
supporting ASD identification [12]. In an analy-
sis of 97 children aged 4-8 years, Prud’hommeaux
and colleagues found that children with ASD were
more likely than TD controls to veer off topic and
incorporate their own specialized interests into the
narrative. Similarly, another study showed that TD
children are more likely to use similar words and
semantic concepts to those given in the narrative,
while children with ASD will retell the narrative
with different words and concepts related to their
own specialized interests [9]. Although promis-
ing, these and other studies that focus on one-sided
language samples, rather than more ecologically
valid conversations, miss a potential source of in-
formative variance in language in ASD: the con-
versational partner.

Typically, natural conversations involve dy-
namic adjustments on a variety of levels that facili-
tate rapport and communication; this is called “lin-
guistic accommodation” or “alignment” [13]. In-
creased accommodation is associated with percep-
tions of better conversation [14], but most prior re-
search on language in ASD has used samples from
structured or semi-structured elicitation tasks - or
conversations conducted with an autism specialist
- rather than natural conversations [15]. Thus, it
is unknown whether and how typical (non-expert)

speakers adjust their conversational behaviors to
accommodate social communication differences
in ASD, and whether the extent of accommoda-
tion changes over the course of development. To
explore this new area, the machine learning mod-
els employed in this study include include dyadic
features derived from a natural conversation (such
as turn-taking rates) and interlocutor (conversation
partner) features, as well as features from individ-
uals with ASD.

3 Developmental Changes in
Conversation

Individuals with and without ASD continue to de-
velop socially and cognitively throughout child-
hood, adolescence, and into early adulthood. For
example, although Theory of Mind (or the abil-
ity to take another person’s perspective) emerges
in early childhood [16], it becomes increasingly
sophisticated throughout typical adolescence and
early adulthood [17]. Thus, age-related differ-
ences in conversation (which is inherently social)
are likely to be found.

Physical and emotional changes between child-
hood and adolescence (e.g., puberty [18]) in-
crease the likelihood that people’s preferred topic
of conversation might change over time as well.
Whereas young children may be more likely to
talk about family and school, older children may
be more focused on peer relationships [19], and
adults might naturally gravitate toward talking
about occupations or romantic partners. Unfortu-
nately, few studies have explored natural conversa-
tion across development, and normative expecta-
tions for brief conversations are poorly understood
across developmental phases and ages.

4 Current Study

The purpose of the current study is to test whether
separating a large sample of individuals with and
without ASD into different age groups, namely
middle childhood (8 to 11), adolescence (12 to 17)
and adulthood (18 and up), increases the accuracy
and reliability of a simple machine learning classi-
fication model for classifying ASD vs. TD, despite
inevitable trade-offs in sample size.

Given the likelihood that natural conversation
differs between children and adolescents in a va-
riety of measurable ways (e.g., preferred topics),
and that adolescents also converse differently than
adults, we hypothesized that diagnostic classifica-



47

tion accuracy would improve significantly when
conducted within each age group separately, as
compared to the combined sample. This is in
contrast to generally accepted doctrine in machine
learning (i.e., that more data is better), since in
our study we divide our larger dataset into three
smaller datasets.

We further tested whether the specific features
that best distinguished diagnostic groups differed
significantly by age. Based on prior research and
clinical observation, we hypothesized that the rela-
tive predictive value of specific features would dif-
fer across development.

5 Methods

5.1 Participants

One hundred forty individuals participated in the
present study (ASD: N=81, TD: N=59). Partic-
ipants were categorized by age into three sub-
groups (see Table 1): middle childhood (8-11
years), adolescence (12-17 years) and adulthood
(18-50 years). Diagnoses were confirmed (ASD
group) or ruled out (TD group) using the Clin-
ical Best Estimate process [20] informed by the
Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule - Sec-
ond Edition (ADOS-2) [3] and adhering to DSM-
V criteria for ASD [21]. To control for non-age
related phenotypic heterogeneity, age subgroups
were matched on Full Scale IQ estimates (WASI-
II) [22], verbal and nonverbal IQ estimates, and
sex ratio (Table 1). Participants with ASD were
also matched across age subgroups on autism
symptom severity, based on ADOS-2 Calibrated
Severity Scores [23] and scores on the Social
Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) [24]. All
participants were native English speakers.

5.2 Procedure

All aspects of this study were approved by the In-
stitutional Review Boards of the Children’s Hos-
pital of Philadelphia and the University of Penn-
sylvania. All adult participants and parents of
minor children provided written informed con-
sent for participation. The primary experimental
task for this study was a slightly modified ver-
sion of the Contextual Assessment of Social Skills
(CASS) [25]. The CASS is a semi-structured
assessment of conversational ability designed to
mimic real-life first-time encounters. Participants
engaged in two three-minute face-to-face conver-
sations with two different confederates (research

staff, blind to participant diagnostic status and un-
aware of the dependent variables of interest). In
the first conversation (Interested condition), the
confederate demonstrated social interest by engag-
ing both verbally and non-verbally in the conver-
sation. In the second conversation (Bored con-
dition), the confederate demonstrated boredom
and disengagement both verbally (e.g., one-word
answers, limited follow-up questions) and non-
verbally (e.g., neutral affect, limited eye-contact
and gestures). Prior to each conversation, study
staff provided the following prompt to the partic-
ipants and confederates before leaving the room:
“Thank you both so much for coming in today.
Right now, you will have three minutes to talk and
get to know each other, and then I will come back
into the room.”

CASS confederates included 42 undergraduate
students or BA-level research staff (12 males, 30
females, all native English speakers). Fourteen
confederates interacted with the ASD group, 7
with the TD group, and 21 with both groups.
Confederates were semi-randomly selected, based
on availability and clinical judgment. Confeder-
ate sex ratios did not differ by diagnostic group
(p=n.s.). In order to provide opportunities for par-
ticipants to initiate and develop the conversation,
and in accordance with CASS confederate instruc-
tions [25], confederates in both conditions were
trained to wait 10 seconds before initiating the
conversation and to speak for no more than 50% of
the time. If conversational lapses occurred, con-
federates were trained to wait 5 seconds before
re-initiating the conversation. No specific con-
versational topic prompts were provided to either
speaker.

Audio/video recordings of CASS conversations
were obtained using a specialized “TreeCam”,
built in-house (Figure 1), placed between the par-
ticipant and confederate (seated facing one an-
other) on a floor stand. The TreeCam has two
HD video cameras pointing in opposite directions
to allow simultaneous recording of participant and
confederate, as well as directional microphones to
record audio. For these analyses, the language
sample began when the first word of the CASS was
uttered, after study staff left the room, and ended
when study staff re-entered.

Note: Diagnostic groups did not significantly differ on sex ratio, age, or IQ within age bins, and age bins did not

one another on ADOS-2 calibrated severity scores (CSS) or on SCQ scores (all p=ns). Five participants with ASD
had missing scores on the SCQ (1 child, 4 adults).

5.3 Audio Data Processing

Audio streams were extracted from audio/video
recordings, and saved in lossless .flac format. A
team of reliable annotators produced time-aligned,
verbatim, orthographic transcripts of audio record-
ings in the transcription software XTrans [26].
Each recording was processed by two junior an-
notators and one senior annotator, all of whom
were undergraduate students and native English
speakers. Before becoming junior annotators for
this cohort, each team member received at least
10 hours of training in Quick Transcription [27]
modified for use with clinical interviews of par-
ticipants with ASD [10, 11, 28]. In addition,
annotators achieved reliability (defined as >90%
in common with a Gold Standard transcript) on
segmenting (marking speech start and stop times)
and transcribing (writing down words and sounds
produced, using the modified Quick Transcription
specification) before beginning independent anno-
tation. Training files included audio recordings of
conversations between individuals with and with-

out autism that were not used in this study.
For CASS recordings, one reliable junior an-

notator segmented utterances into pause groups,
while the second transcribed words produced by
each speaker. A senior annotator then thoroughly
reviewed and corrected each file. All senior anno-
tators had at least 6 months of prior transcription
experience. Final language data were exported
from XTrans as tab-delimited files that were batch
imported into R. Annotations marking non-speech
sounds like laughter, indicators of language er-
rors like stutters, and punctuation were removed,
while other disfluencies (including filled pauses
and whole-word repetitions) remained.

5.4 Speech/Language Features

One hundred twenty-three features were calcu-
lated for each speaker (participant, confederate)
in the Bored condition and the Interested condi-
tion separately, using base R [29], qdap [30], and
Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) soft-
ware [31]. There were six main feature groups:
pause/overlap metrics (12), segment/turn metrics
(6), speaking rate/word complexity metrics (9),
LIWC categories (80), lexical entropy/diversity
measures (5), and parts of speech (9). Formality
and polarity (2) were also computed at the con-
versation level for each speaker, using all words
produced by a given speaker in each condition,
leading to a total of 123 linguistic features. Dif-
ferences between speakers were calculated within
each condition (Participant Interested - Confed-
erate Interested, Participant Bored - Confederate
Bored) and within each speaker across conditions
(Participant Interested - Participant Bored, Con-
federate Interested - Confederate Bored), yielding
8× 123 = 984 features.

LIWC [31] is a commonly used software for an-



49

alyzing text-based natural language data. LIWC
relies on a dictionary of words that are grouped by
semantic similarity into lexical categories. These
word-language lexica are designated by a majority
vote by human judges, as are which words that fall
into each, or multiple, of these lexica. This type of
text analysis has been used successfully to analyze
various mental disorders [32], as well as to charac-
terize personality traits from transcribed language
or written text [33].

Lexical features are included in the current
study as they have proven informative in prior
ASD research. For example, the words produced
by interviewing psychologists correlate signifi-
cantly with ASD symptom severity [34]. Bone and
colleagues conducted their analysis across a wide
age range (3.58 to 13.17 years), and interlocutors
were autism experts, but their research nonethe-
less suggests that word choice by conversational
partners could be a potentially sensitive marker of
ASD phenotype. In the current study, confederate
word choice is captured.

Difference metrics were included in our fea-
ture set for two primary reasons. First, the orig-
inal intent of the CASS task was to probe how
individuals with ASD handle variations in con-
versational context, as compared to TD peers.
Thus, within-speaker differences across two con-
texts (Bored interlocutor, Interested interlocutor)
are pertinent relative to the original design. Sec-
ond, interlocutor differences within a given con-
dition were included as a general measure of lin-
guistic accommodation; to study how closely the
speaking rates, pause rates, and preferred conver-
sational topics of the two speakers align. Research
shows that greater linguistic accommodation is as-
sociated with social success [35] and also sug-
gests that reduced accomodation in ASD in child-
hood [36] may improve by adulthood [37].

We recognize that for linear models, introduc-
ing new features as linear combinations of old
features (such as the difference between the In-
terested and Bored conditions) is algebraically
equivalent to not introducing these features at all.
However, by introducing these additional features,
we are guiding the model to learn dependencies
that clinicians deem important and have functional
value in real-world social contexts. This is espe-
cially true when using an automated feature se-
lection technique, such as the f -value employed
here, as these techniques limit the number of di-

mensions that can be used by a model. In the cur-
rent study, rather than requiring our model to learn
to take the difference across two dimensions, we
are giving the model this knowledge a priori, and
thus allowing the model to learn to use this differ-
ence with only one dimension. This type of rea-
soning forms the motivation for sparse coding (see
below).

6 Results and Discussion

6.1 Model Design

Linear logistic regression, also known as the Max-
imum Entropy classifier or the softmax classi-
fier, was used to classify ASD vs. TD. Features
were down-selected before being input into the
model by identifying dimensions with the highest
f -value (largest mean separation between groups).
The model was trained and tested according to
leave one out, with an internal 5-fold cross vali-
dation to determine what percentage of the total
features are kept from the f -value, selected from
0.5%, 1%, 2%, 5%, 10% or 20%. The top scor-
ing f -test values can be seen in Figure 3 for the
different age ranges. We used an `2-regularization
penalty in the cost function in order to smooth out
model coefficients. Our models were implemented
in the Python library SciKit-Learn [38].

We use logistic regression so as to have an in-
terpretable linear model. With more complex non-
parametric and/or non-linear models, it is more
difficult to understand the contribution of different
variables on the model performance. We did not
use a sparsity constraint in the model, such as an
`1 penalty, since we are already imposing sparsity
on the feature space by downsampling the feature
dimension to those features with large f -values.

When designing the model, one may consider
using age or gender as a covariate that automati-
cally adjusts the model parameters, within for ex-
ample a hierarchical Bayes network [39]. There
are at least two difficulties with doing this in a
purely data driven way. First, it introduces many
additional parameters into the model one would
need to learn, which on limited data is subopti-
mal in a statistical sense. Second, such hierar-
chical models are nonlinear, and thus difficult to
interpret, which was an important design crite-
ria for our model. Instead, we chose to use do-
main knowledge from developmental psychology
to strictly define different models for different de-
velopmental age groups.

6.2 Classification Accuracy

Classification accuracy for three age-specific mod-
els, as well as the accuracy of a model for all ages
together (8 and older), are shown in Table 2. Age-
specific models outperformed the single model.
The weighted average of the three age-specific
models, weighted according to number of sam-
ples in each age group, was 0.829. In contrast,
the single model for all ages achieved an accu-
racy of 0.686. Thus, our age-informed approach
resulted in a 20.8% relative increase in accuracy,
p < 0.001 (Figure 2). Again, this is notable as
it contrasts with the standard doctrine in machine
learning that training a model on more data is bet-
ter; in our case we trained three models on roughly
a third of the data each, yielding improved results.

6.3 Distinguishing Features by Age Group

Different linguistic features emerged as important
for distinguishing between TD and ASD partici-

pants in each age group, as seen in Figure 3.

In the 8 to 11 age group, overall pronouns
and personal pronouns predicted diagnostic sta-
tus, such that children with ASD produced smaller
proportions of pronouns than matched TD peers.
In particular, the first person plural pronoun “we”
was used relatively less frequently by the ASD
group, suggesting that children with ASD were
less likely to describe themselves as associat-
ing with others during conversation. Children in
the ASD group also tended to use more out-of-
dictionary words than TD children (i.e., they pro-
duced a smaller percentage of words that were in
the LIWC dictionary, relative to their total word
production), which could be due to children with
ASD talking about specialized, idiosyncratic in-
terests or simply using low-frequency words or
phrases. Finally, children with ASD spoke more
slowly, measured in words per minute with breath
pauses removed, than matched TD children, and
used comparatively fewer verbs (Figure 3a).

Top linguistic features that predicted diagnosis
in the 12 to 17 age group are shown in Figure 3b.
The Bored condition emerged as particularly im-
portant for distinguishing between TD and ASD
adolescents, as did confederate word choice. Pro-
nouns were predictive in this age group as well.
Specifically, the second person personal pronoun
“you” was produced relatively more often by TD
teens in relation to confederates in the Bored con-
dition. This could indicate more attempts by the
TD group to engage with an obviously bored con-
versational partner, and relatively diminished ef-
fort put forth by teens with ASD. Confederates
speaking with autistic teens used words associated
with less authenticity, but greater clout, than when
speaking with TD peers, and responded more of-
ten to TD participants with negations (perhaps in
response to increased questions/comments about
themselves, as indicated by greater use of “you”
by TD teens).

Finally, linguistic features that differentiated be-
tween conversation samples from adults with and
without ASD are shown in Figure 3c. Inter-
estingly, these features were primarily temporal;
for example, top features included the number of
overlapping pauses (interruptions) in the conversa-
tion, as well as the rate of pauses per minute. This
suggests that whereas topics of conversation might
be comparable in ASD and TD adults (i.e., simi-
lar tendencies to discuss occupations or romantic

partners), the way in which conversations occur
may include awkward pauses, interruptions, and
other temporal atypicalities that could negatively
impact conversation quality.

The linguistic features identified in our ma-
chine learning analysis are consistent with prior
research, as well as with observations about ASD
made by clinicians and linguists. Importantly, our
analysis goes a step further by quantifying the ex-
tent to which each of these features is important

for distinguishing diagnostic groups at each age.

6.4 Feature Consistency Across Age Groups

The purpose of this subsection is to quantify which
predictive speech/language features change by age
group (i.e., how many predictive features remain
predictive regardless of age). To do this, we mea-
sured change in the f -value.

Suppose we have age groups (8, 11) and
(12, 17), and would like to compare changes in

f -values between f(8,11) and f(12,17). Since each
participant is associated with 8 × 123 = 984 fea-
tures, as mentioned in Section 6.1, then f(8,11) and
f(12,17) are both 984-dimensional vectors, with
each dimension containing the f -value of its cor-
responding feature. Measuring distances across
dimensions does not make sense in this case, as
each of the individual f -values are calculated in
one dimension independently of each other. Thus,
we use the `1-norm, sometimes referred to as the
Manhattan distance, when measuring these dis-
tances, i.e. ‖f(8,11) − f(12,17)‖1.

Given that the magnitudes ‖f(8,11)‖1 = 1505,
‖f(12,17)‖1 = 1848 and ‖f(18,50)‖1 = 3035, we
see that the changes in magnitude of the feature
importance from one age group to another are pro-
portionally very large, and in fact often exceed, the
magnitude of the features themselves. This tells
us that the specific linguistic features that are im-
portant for distinguishing between ASD and TD,
as defined by the f -test, vary enormously across
age groups, especially when considered against
the scale of the linguistic features themselves (Fig-
ures 4a- 4c, and Table 3).

Table 3: Measuring the extent to which the feature im-
portance changes with the `1-norm, according to each
feature’s f -value, depending on which age group is
under consideration. The p-value corresponds to dis-
tances developed from the null hypothesis where no
age groups are considered, while ensuring correct pro-
portions of ages and classes are kept.

‖f(12,17) − f(18,50)‖1 3108 0.005

7 Discussion

In this study, we demonstrated that machine learn-
ing models for classifying and characterizing ASD
improve significantly after incorporating domain
knowledge. Specifically, we showed that mod-
els accounting for developmental changes in spo-
ken language and conversation are more accurate
for distinguishing ASD from typical development,
relative to models resting on the assumption that
language patterns during natural conversation re-
main consistent across ages. We further showed
that linguistic features most strongly predicting
ASD vary significantly across age groups, sug-
gesting that specific atypicalities in the ways that
individuals with ASD use language (versus TD
controls) are not static across development.

These findings highlight the value of machine
learning models that are clinically informed, par-
ticularly for understanding highly heterogeneous
conditions like ASD. Developing separate mod-
els for different age groups (i.e., middle child-
hood, adolescence, and adulthood), we were able
to significantly improve the models’ classification
performance and reliability, despite reductions in
sample size. This bodes well for future appli-
cations of machine learning for studying psychi-
atric conditions. Future research will incorporate
pitch-related features, extend classification to non-
ASD psychiatric conditions, and explore the use of
more complex nonlinear models for classification
and prediction in larger sample sizes.

8 Conclusions and Future Work

This study has implications for our clinical un-
derstanding of ASD across the lifespan. We have
identified sets of precise, objective linguistic fea-
tures that are highly predictive of ASD at three dif-
ferent developmental stages. These features pro-



53

vide specific, developmentally-informed interven-
tion targets that could be used to improve language
and conversation skills in individuals with ASD.
We anticipate that additional features identified
through machine learning in other domains could
similarly inform future efforts to develop targeted
clinical interventions.

For future work, we would like to use these
techniques in a longitudinal study for measuring
treatment progress. This can be done by track-
ing feature values of an individual as they change
through time. Additionally, we would like to use
these techniques to see if they can be used to dif-
ferentiate between other mental health disorders,
such as anxiety, depression and obsessive compul-
sive disorder.
