Abstract

This  paper  describes  a new Cantonese-Man-
darin  parallel  dependency  treebank.  We dis-
cuss  the extent  to which  the treebank allows
for  comparative  measures  with  the  goal  of
quantifying structural differences between the
two languages. After presenting syntactic dif-
ferences between the two languages, we com-
puted various frequency measures on the tree-
bank.  We  present  the  results  and  discuss
whether they reflect differences in text genre,
differences in annotation scheme design, or ac-
tual  structural  differences.   Finally,  we com-
pare the structural differences to previous ac-
counts of the observed construction. 

1 Introduction

Cantonese is part of the Yue dialect group which
is spoken by more than 55 million people mostly
in Canton,  Hong Kong, Macao,  the  rest  of  the
Pearl River Delta, and overseas Chinese commu-
nities. It is the “most widely known and influen-
tial  variety  of  Chinese  other  than  Mandarin”
(Matthews & Yip 1994), and the early contact of
Cantonese speakers with European explorers has
given rise to the Western “Cantonese” pronunci-
ations of some Chinese cities (e.g. Canton). Can-
tonese is not only used orally or in informal con-
versation, but also in the legislative councils in
Hong Kong and Macao.

The special status of Hong Kong and Macao
and the economic and educational importance of
the region has made Cantonese a relatively well-
studied and well-resourced language. A number
of Cantonese corpora have already been tagged
with  part-of-speech (POS),  including  the  Early
Cantonese  Tagged  Database  (Yiu  2012),  the
Hong Kong Cantonese Child Language Corpus
(CANCORP,  Lee et  al.  1996),  the  Hong Kong

Bilingual  Child  Language  Corpus  (Yip  and
Matthews 2007), the Hong Kong Cantonese Cor-
pus (HKCanCor, Luke & Wong 2015), the Can-
tonese  Chinese  Corpus  of  Oral  Narratives
(CANON, Law et al. 2012), and the Hong Kong
Mid-1990s Newspaper Column Corpus (Li et al.
2016). However, to our best knowledge, no syn-
tactic treebank has been published prior to our
work,  neither  phrase  structure  nor  dependency
based.

This  paper  presents  the  first  parallel  depen-
dency treebank for Cantonese and Mandarin and
analyzes statistical differences between the tree-
banks. The rest of the paper is organized as fol-
lows.  The next section summarizes syntactic dif-
ferences between Cantonese and Mandarin.  Sec-
tion 3 discusses the construction process of the
treebanks.  Section 4 presents statistical analyses
on the treebank.  Finally, Section 5 concludes. 

2 Linguistic background

Cantonese and Mandarin are similar languages in
most major respects, leaving aside pronunciation
and grammatical particles. Some significant lin-
guistic  differences  between  the  two  languages
are  well-established  (Ouyang  1993),  including
phonology, vocabulary, and in particular the rich
Cantonese  system  of  utterance  particles.  Some
differences  of  grammatical  structure  have been
described as  well  but,  due to the  absence of  a
Cantonese treebank and, even less so, of a paral-
lel treebank, descriptions of structural differences
could not be put on empirical grounds so far. We
will show that some of these differences reflect
measures that we can take on our treebank; for
other phenomena our treebank does not yet pro-
vide  enough  data  to  assess  significant  differ-
ences.

2.1 Double objects

Among  the  commonly  known  syntactic  differ-
ences we have to cite is the canonical word order
of monotransitive and ditransitive verb construc-
tions, which is reversed compared to Mandarin:
For a ditransitive verb, in Cantonese we have the
following word order:
verb + direct object + indirect object. 
畀 一枝花 我
Péi yātjīfā ngóh
give a flower 1SG
‘Give me a flower.’

In Mandarin it is 
verb + indirect object + direct object. 
給 我 一枝花ㄦ
Gěi wǒ yīzhīhuār
give 1SG a flower
‘Give me a flower.’

These  two  alternative  constructions  recall  the
English dative shift alternation. 

2.2 Use of the object marker

For  monotransitive  verbs,  the  object  marker
(OM)  being  more  prominent  in  Mandarin,  the
SOV order is more frequent in Cantonese. The
same  word  order  exists  in  Cantonese  but  is
marked. It is used when the speaker wants to put
stress  on  the  object.  The  two  competing  Can-
tonese constructions are:

閂 咗 度 門 啦！
Sāan jó douh mùhn lā!
close PERF CLF door SFP
‘Close the door!’
PERF=perfective particle
CLF=classifier
SFP=sentence final particle

vs.
將 度 門 閂 咗 （佢） 啦！
Jēung douh mùhn sāan jó (kéuih) lā!
OM CLF door close PERF (3SG) SFP
‘the Door, close (it)!’

2.3 Post-verbal modifiers

Another notable difference of the two languages
is  the  structure  of  post-verbal  modifiers:  Com-
pare the following Cantonese sentence (Nr 0_189
of the parallel treebank) with its Mandarin coun-
terpart. 

Cantonese:

Wa! Jáu saai làh?
Wow go all SFP
‘Wow! All of them have gone already’ / ‘They
have all  gone?’ /  ‘They have all  been released
from duty?’

Mandarin:

Dōu xiàbān le ma
all off-duty ASP SFP

The Cantonese post-verbal modifier  晒 saai ‘all’
is  often considered as  a quantifying verb-com-
pound with the verb grammaticalizing to a quan-
tifying particle that can translate as “additionally,
also”. The Mandarin counterpart is an adverb in
the standard preverbal position.

2.4 Coverb constructions

As pointed out by Francis and Matthews (2006),
Cantonese coverbs are actually verbs,  e.g. they
can be used with aspect markers and verbal parti-
cles,  In  contrast,  the  Mandarin  counterpart  is
rather a preposition – a preposition of verbal ori-
gin that has lost all of its verbal properties, ex-
cept that it can still take a (prepositional) object.

Mandarin (0_28):

Wǒ péi nǐmen jìnqù ba
1SG accompany/with 2PL go.inside SFP

267



Cantonese:

Ngóh pùih léihdeih jahpheui ā
1SG accompany 2PL go.inside SFP
‘Let me enter / go into the shop with you!’

Similarly, in beneficial constructions, the English
preposition  for is  translated by the polysemous
character for give.  Its usage in Mandarin is quite
grammaticalized  and it  is  usually  considered  a
preposition,  Cantonese remaining more analyti-
cal.  In  our  Mandarin UD guidelines,  we intro-
duce  a  specific  sub-relation  of  advcl,
advcl:coverb, to account for these constructions.

2.5 Expletives

A last well-known difference between Cantonese
and Mandarin  is  the  existence  of  expletives  in
Cantonese  (annotated  with  the  relation  name
expl),  which  are  completely  absent  from Man-
darin. An example is  佢  kéuih ‘3SG’. The pro-
noun is  part of a grammatical construction and
actually does not refer to anything or anyone, the
condition for qualifying as expletive.1
大家 飲勝 佢！
Daaihgā jámsing kéuih
everyone cheers KEUHI
‘Everyone! Cheers (to it)!’
我 不如 死 咗 佢 好過 啦!
Ngóh bātyùh séi jó kéuih hóugwo lā
1SG had.better die PERF KEUIH better SFP
‘It would be better for me to die.’

3 Treebank construction

Our  corpus  is  based  on  television  programs
broadcast in Hong Kong (Lee, 2011). The Can-
tonese  text  is  thus  semi-planned  spoken  text.
Cantonese TV dramas are widely distributed in
southern  China  and  beyond  and  mostly  have
Mandarin subtitles. The annotation is still ongo-
ing and the texts that still  await  annotation are
taken  from  movies  that  are  distributed  on
Youtube, which will ultimately allow transform-
ing this  part  of  the  treebank into a  completely
free language resource since the creators agreed
to the distribution of the language data. The spo-
1 For further details and examples see http://univer-

saldependencies.org/yue/dep/expl.html

ken Cantonese  was  transcribed  with  traditional
Chinese characters by a native speaker of the lan-
guage. 

Although the subtitles were in traditional Chi-
nese, we added a transcription in simplified Chi-
nese as a separate feature. The reason being that
we need both character sets: The simplified char-
acters are necessary in order to apply parsing and
segmentation tools. And we kept the traditional
characters  because  the  ongoing  alignment  is
more  straightforward  with  identical  character
sets and also because the Hong Kong residents
who are working on the project are more used to
traditional  characters.  Moreover,  the  projection
from traditional to simplified characters is mostly
one-to-one but for some characters many to one,
and  thus  easier  in  the  direction  traditional →
simplified.

The  Cantonese  transcription  was  done  inde-
pendently of the Mandarin subtitles. This has im-
portant  consequences  on  the  measures  that  we
are able to take, because, as we will see, the tree-
bank is not as strictly parallel as we had hoped
because the subtitles are condensed and simpli-
fied versions of the Cantonese original.
The currently annotated part of the corpus con-
sists  of  569 parallel  sentences.  The treebank is
sentence-aligned. As shown in Table 1, the spo-
ken  Cantonese  sentences  are  longer  than  their
counterpart of Mandarin subtitles. 
Language Number of tokens Average sentence 

length

Mandarin 4149 7.29

Cantonese 5428 9.54

3.1 The UD annotation scheme

For the annotation of the parallel  treebank,  we
decided  to  follow  the  Universal  Dependency
(UD, de Marneffe et al., 2014; Nivre et al., 2016)
annotation scheme, as this allows the comparison
of  our  resource  also  with  external  treebanks.
However,  even  for  Mandarin,  no  annotation
guide existed, and the first UD v1 Mandarin tree-
bank does not come with any explanation of the
annotation choices and its  annotation is,  unsur-
prisingly, quite heterogeneous.

The  Mandarin  UD v1  annotation  guide  was
explicitly developed for the UD dependency an-
notation of the Mandarin side of our corpus. Le-
ung et al. (2016) describe the underlying discus-
sions and choices, in particular for Chinese idio-
syncrasies like classifiers, aspectual and sentence
final  particles,  and  light  verb  as  well  as  serial

268



verb  constructions.  In  accordance  with  discus-
sions around the development of this Mandarin
annotation guide, UD v2 explicitly takes into ac-
count a specific clf  ‘classifier’ relation, which is
a unique type of syntactic relations that only ex-
ists  for  languages  that  have  classifiers  –  Man-
darin being the first  language with this  feature
that is described in UD.

The UD v1 guide has been completed during
the  ongoing  annotation  experience  and  then
adapted to v2. The Mandarin-specific part of the
UD documentation is currently one of the most
complete  language  specific  annotation  descrip-
tions2 

The  similarity  of  Cantonese  and  Mandarin
makes it  reasonable  to  conceive the Cantonese
annotation guide on  the  basis  of  the  Mandarin
guide,  with  modifications  wherever  necessary.
The  development  of  this  guide  is  work  in
progress.

The whole semi-automatic annotation process
is done in the Arborator annotation tool (Gerdes
2013),  which allows blind and open annotation
by  multiple  users  as  well  as  integrated  parser
bootstrapping possibilities

3.2 Outline

UD has been conceived with a double objective:
The parallel construction of the treebanks facili-
tates the developments of parsers and other NLP
tools.  And,  more  importantly  for  the  present
study, it allows studies in empirical comparative
syntax.  There  are  some  caveats  to  this  claim,
some  of  which  we  will  discuss  later.  But  any
comparative  measure  on  the  current  UD  tree-
banks will always measure either structural dif-
ferences, genre differences of the underlying cor-
pus, differences in the design of the annotation
scheme, or annotation errors and incoherences of
course. Our corpus is, at least partly different in
this aspect: Being a parallel treebank, the content
of both treebanks is identical and any ascertained
difference should be attributed to a structural dif-
ference. Alas, as we have mentioned before, this
is not completely true, as the Mandarin subtitles
are not precise translations of the original Can-
tonese  words.  Therefore,  the  measured  differ-
ences  can  always  either  be  an  actual  syntactic
difference, or  rather a difference of genre:  The
genre of spoken texts in TV dramas vs. the genre
of  subtitles  in  “Translationese”  –  although  the
pure informational content is mostly identical.
2 The annotation guidelines that we have developed 

can be accessed at: http://universaldependen-
cies.org/zh/overview/introduction.html

The  measured  differences  between  the  two
sides of the parallel treebank that cannot easily
be attributed to the genre variation may either be
new to us or corroborate known syntactic differ-
ences between the two languages.

4 Statistical measures

This section first presents the statistical measures
that will be used to assure the validity of the sig-
nificance of the observations (Section 4.1). Fur-
ther,  various  difference  measures  based  on  the
POS distribution will be presented and discussed
(Section 4.2). Then we move on to differences in
the functional  distribution (Section 4.3) and fi-
nally we mix categorical and functional informa-
tion (Section 4.4).  After a short presentation of
dependency  directional measures  (Section  4.5),
we will conclude with an outlook on the ongoing
annotation and alignment process.

4.1 Fisher Test and Specificity

In order to distinguish significant from insignifi-
cant over- and under-representation of features of
our  parallel  treebank,  we  systematically  apply
the exact Fisher test which is based on the cumu-
lative hypergeometric distribution. The null hy-
pothesis  is  that  the  size  of  the  two corpora  as
well as the number of total words having a spe-
cific category (or syntactic function) being fixed,
the actually observed number of occurrences is
due to chance. The p-value measures the proba-
bility that the observed frequency (or more oc-
currences  if  the  number  is  already  over-repre-
sented or less if already under-represented) actu-
ally  occurred.  To  make  the  probabilities  more
readable, we transform them in specificity values
(Lebart et al. 1991): specificity=−log10(p) if the
observed frequency is higher than the expected
value  and log10(1−p)  if  the  frequency is  lower
than expected.  The expected value is  the equi-
distribution of categories and functions into the
two corpora depending on the size of the corpora
and  the  frequency  of  the  categories  and  func-
tions. This is a well-established method in textual
statistics,  but still  quite rarely used in syntactic
comparisons.

4.2 Categorical differences

Concerning the POS distribution we observe
the following variation between Cantonese and
Mandarin. The first line of Table 2 can be read as
follows:  Cantonese  contains  999  of  the  total
1344  PUNCT(uation)  tokens  in  our  two  tree-
banks.  The  positive  Specificity  value  indicates

269



that  PUNCT  is  over-represented  in  Cantonese.
The probability that this is due to chance is very
low: 1/1031.

Inversely, the last row of Table 2 indicates the
following observation:  Cantonese has only 511
of the total of 1080 ADV(erbial) tokens. This is
less than statistically expected if the POS were
distributed evenly, given that the Cantonese part
of the corpus is larger. The probability that the
observed frequency difference is due to chance is
1/1011. The upper shaded (green) rows of the ta-
ble thus show significant over-representation of
categories in Cantonese, the lower shaded (red)
rows show significant under-representation. The
unshaded rows have over-  or  under-representa-
tion of order 0 or 1 (p~1/10) and thus non-signif-
icant  differences.   The  significantly  lower  fre-
quency of adverbs in Cantonese is likely due to
the prominence of Cantonese post-verbal  parti-
cles where in Mandarin adverbs are often used to
express the same meaning.  For instance, for the
progressive  aspect,  in  Mandarin  the  adverb
zhèngzài 正在 is used (zhèngzài + V) where the
Cantonese counterpart is V-gán in which gán 緊
is a post-verbal aspect particle. (Also cf. section
2.3)

We see that the Cantonese treebank was not
only punctuated very differently than the Man-
darin subtitles.  The Cantonese side contains all
the observed interjections of the whole parallel
treebank as well as a much higher frequency of
particles. This underlines again that the subtitle
translation is actually a condensed, not to say im-
poverished, version that lacks many of the oral

features of the spoken original. The fact that the
POS tag X (words where annotators cannot de-
termine a POS, like the prefix a 阿) only appear
in Cantonese can be attributed to  possible  dis-
agreements  between the  annotators  which  may
be due to the oral character of the transcription as
well as to the underdeveloped formal grammars
of  Cantonese  –  making  the  annotation  task
harder.

Further, we observe the expected under-repre-
sentation of ADP(ositions) in Cantonese due to
the verbal character of many Cantonese equiva-
lents of  Mandarin prepositions,  as  discussed in
section  2.4. It remains to explain why verbs are
nonetheless also under-represented in Cantonese.

The  under-representation  of  PRON(ouns)  in
Cantonese is unexpected. This may be an actual
linguistic difference between the two languages
or it may be due to the less oral character of the
Mandarin translation compared to the Cantonese
transcriptions, leading to less pronoun dropping.
This will have to be examined further.

4.3 Functional differences

Table  3 shows the  significant  differences  in
the distribution of syntactic functions, partly cor-
responds to what has been observed for the POS
(e.g. the high frequency of punct, discourse, and
discourse:sp =  “sentence  final  particle”  rela-
tions),  but  also  shows  a  few  more  interesting
variations: The current Mandarin annotation does
not contain any advcl:coverb relations, which is
due to differences in annotation, but which none-
theless reveals a significant structural difference
between the  languages:  The Mandarin preposi-
tions are of verbal origin but have lost all verbal
properties whereas their Cantonese counterparts
can still be modified by verbal articles and have
thus to be tagged and annotated differently (see
section 2.4). The UD annotation scheme handles
prepositions as case-markers, and thus as depen-

dent from their argument, i.e. what is commonly
called a prepositional object. This results in UD’s

infamous “Turkish” analysis of English preposi-
tions (Chris Manning, 2016, personal communi-
cation). Figure 1 shows the situation for English
(example taken from Gerdes & Kahane 2016, up-
dated to UD 2.0).
The  following pair  of  sentence segments  illus-
trates this point for Chinese. The 1st person sin-
gular pronoun in the Mandarin tree 我 ‘wǒ’ is an
obl:dobj that has a case-marker. In the Cantonese
equivalent, what has been analyzed as a (verbal)
preposition in Mandarin is now a coverb, which
takes its argument as a regular direct object.
Mandarin (sentence 0-7):

Jiù bùyào bǎ wǒ dàng shì
then do.not OM 1SG treat COP

nǐ de nāishū
2SG REL youngest.uncle.on.paternal.side

‘Don’t treat me as your uncle.’

Cantonese:

Dong ngóh haih
treat 1SG COP

léih ge lāaisuk
2SG REL youngest.uncle.on.paternal.side

‘Treat me as your uncle.’

We  end  up  with  structurally  very  different
trees for a simple categorical  choice.  Note that
the proximity between verbs and preposition is
not reserved to Chinese. The English  during or
the French equivalent  pendant are similar cases
where the verbal character of the preposition is
still visible. 

Alternatively, we could have decided to treat
all Cantonese coverbs as prepositions, so that the
Cantonese trees would be in line with the Man-
darin ones. This is a difficult choice as UD seeks

“to maximize parallelism by allowing the same
grammatical relation to be annotated in the same
way across languages, while making enough cru-
cial distinctions to differentiate constructions that
are not the same.” (Nivre 2015 and UD home-

page.  And although prepositions in English are
considered by any syntactic analysis that we are
aware  of  to  be  “crucially”  different  from case
markers  (Osborne  2015),  UD  decided  to  treat
them just like Turkish case markers, leading to
greater  similarity  between Turkish and English
and at the same time to the structurally very dif-
ferent trees for simple and complex prepositions
(Figure 1)

A good syntactic annotation scheme would al-
low  for  slight  structural  differences  to  be  re-
flected by slight differences in the annotation, for
example in the case of Cantonese coverbs by a
different categorization of the coverb, once as a
verb and once as a preposition, but with identical
dependency  structures  in  both  treebanks.  The
“Turkish” analysis  of  prepositions,  on the con-
trary, triggers a structural upheaval, for a small
real  difference:  A  “catastrophe”  in  a  strictly
mathematical  sense of Thom’s catastrophe the-
ory (Saunders 1980, Gerdes & Kahane 2016), i.e.
a brutal structural change in a continuum. This
results  in  measures  of  important  differences
where  there  are  few  (between  Mandarin  and
Cantonese for  example),  and in  the  absence of
annotation  differences  where  syntactic  differ-
ences  actually  occur  (e.g.  English  prepositions
vs. Turkish case markers).
The  UD  annotation  scheme  obliges  all  depen-
dency relations to be taken from a fixed set of 37
functions but it  allows for the creation of idio-
syncratic sub-relations when needed by a given
language.  The  sub-relations  are  separated  by  a
colon from the main relation:  relation:subrela-
tion.  When  grouping  together  subrelations,  we
obtain Table  4, a simpler table with similar sig-
nificant variations between Cantonese and Man-
darin.  Concerning  the  adverbial  clause  (advcl)
relation, we see that its distribution is no longer
significantly  different  between  the  two  lan-
guages: Mandarin had more simple  advcl,  Can-
tonese more coverb constructions which adds up
to an equal distribution.

4.4 Mixed measures

When grouping together the syntactic function
and the POS of the dependent token, we obtain
128 classes of function-POS pairs. Although the
small size of our current parallel corpus makes
most  differences  fall  under  the  significance
threshold,  some couples  are  significantly  over-
and under-represented. See Table 5 for details.

We observe for example that Cantonese parti-
cles are mostly in discourse or advmod relations
whereas  Mandarin  particles  are  mark  (~verbal
complementizers)  and  case  markers  (~preposi-
tions).

Since UD v2.0, the dislocated relation is used
for objects in a non-canonical position “that do
not fulfill the usual core grammatical relations of
a  sentence”  (UD page  for  the  dislocated  rela-
tion3),  so  all  the  obj and  obl relations  in  the
above  list  are  actually  post-verbal.  Since  the
Cantonese data is more oral, the over-representa-
tion of objects could also partially be due to this
distinction and not to an actual difference in the
valency structures of the observed verbal objects.

3 It is not completely clear what is actually meant by
“fulfilling the core grammatical relation” because
a dislocated object usually fills the valency slot of
the  verbal  governor.  Mimicking  what  has  been
done for English and French, we decided to anno-
tate preverbal objects with the dislocated relation.

If  we  go  one  step  further,  we  can  measure
triples POS–func→ POS. The two treebanks con-
tain more than 300 of these triples, the two most
frequent  ones,  with more than 700 occurrences
being  VERB–punct→PUNCT and  VERB–adv-
mod→ADV. 

The most significantly over-represented Can-
tonese triples are shown in Table 6.

The significant over-representation of NOUN–
det→NOUN relations  in  Cantonese  may  seem
surprising and does not seem to follow directly
from  the  POS  distribution.  Note  first  that  the
fixed UD POS tag-set does not include a specific
category  for  classifiers  which  are  therefore
tagged as nouns. What we are actually observing
here  is  that  bare  classifier  noun  phrases  [CLF
NOUN] is a common Cantonese strategy for def-
inite NP constructions. In Cantonese only [CLF
NOUN] and [DET CLF NOUN] are possible for

definite  NPs.  In  Mandarin  we  have  [NOUN],
[DET NOUN], or [DET CLF NOUN].4

Cantonese (sentence 0_2):

Go hōn’gāang sān làih ga
CLF watchman new arrive SFP

Mandarin:

Nà bǎoānyuán shì xīn lái de
CLF watchman COP new arrive SFP

On the lower edge of the table, the most typi-
cally Mandarin triples are these:

In  common copula  constructions,  UD im-
poses the analysis of the copula verb as the de-
4 Note that [CLF NOUN] is also possible in Man-

darin, but only in post-verbal position, and it can
only have an indefinite interpretation, hence it oc-
curs  much less  frequently  than in  Cantonese.  In
Cantonese, [CLF NOUN] can occur in both pre-
verbal  and  postverbal  position,  but  in  preverbal
position it must be definite; in postverbal position,
it can be ambiguous between definite and indefi-
nite.

pendent  of  the  semantically  full  element,
which is commonly a noun or an adjective. In
the new UD v2 annotation scheme however,
the auxiliary is considered the head of the con-
struction if the semantically full argument is a
verb itself, the copula verb becomes the head
of the construction, a decision which attempts
to avoid cases of embedded multiple auxiliary
constructions where the subject can no longer
be  unequivocally  attributed  to  its  governor.
This  explains  the  existence  of  the  AUX–
ccomp→VERB triple,  but it  does not  explain
why  this  construction  is  over-represented  in
Mandarin. This will  have to be explained by
returning on the actual parallel data where the
AUX–ccomp→VERB triple must have a struc-
turally different translation in Cantonese.

4.5 Directional measures

A final set of measures on the treebank is based
on the direction of the dependency link:

This kind of measures has been used in vari-
ous  treebank analysis  methods,  in  particular  in
typological research, where the direction of the
head-daughter relations has been shown to corre-
late with many important language features (Liu
2010, Chen & Gerdes 2017).

Here we just briefly want to point to a few as-
pects that have been mentioned above: We see
that  our annotation scheme only has objects to
the right of its verbal governor – other positions
would  be  annotated  as  dislocated.  For  the
oblique  verbal  argument,  however,  we  observe
an important difference between Cantonese and
Mandarin:  Mandarin  has  around  20%  of  its
oblique arguments to the right of their governor –
Cantonese has 10% more, corresponding to the
aforementioned structural preferences.

The higher number of right-branching advmod
and  aux relations  in  Cantonese,  however,  does
not follow directly from the known language dif-
ferences and should be explored further, prefer-
ably on more, and if possible, less genre depen-
dent parallel data.

5 Conclusion

This  article  presents  a  method  of  empirical
comparative syntax using statistical measures on

a comparatively small  sentence-aligned parallel
dependency  treebank.  The  specificity  measure-
ments, based on the exact Fisher test, are well-
adapted to small corpora because the alternative
test  for  categorical  data,  the  approximating  χ²
test,  gives incorrect  results  for very small  (and
very frequent) occurrences (compared to the size
of  the  corpus)  –  and  the  frequencies  of  most
words in a corpus are very low.

The significant observations can often be ex-
plained  by  actual  differences  in  the  language
structure or  at  least  in  the language annotation
scheme. Since the corpus is parallel, the differ-
ences are not due to different vocabulary etc., but
the subtle genre differences on the two sides of
our  treebank  (transcription  vs  subtitle)  remain
very visible in the resulting measures.

We  can  see  that  Cantonese  has  significant
structural differences with its Mandarin counter-
part, although some of these differences are rein-
forced by the UD annotation scheme while other
actual structural differences may have remained
hidden  from  our  statistical  analysis.  Inversely,
however,  not  all  well-known  structural  differ-
ences  between the languages can be put  under
scrutiny by means of the parallel treebank. The
expletive, for example, is absent from our corpus
– pointing to the fact  that  frequently discussed
phenomena are not necessarily frequent syntactic
phenomena.  The specificity measure allows or-
dering the observed differences by statistical im-
portance, the degree of astonishment, thus empir-
ically guiding the research to actual hotspots of
syntactic variation.

The annotation choices we face with different
stages of preopositional grammaticalization in a
parallel or comparable treebanks can be seen as
part of a more general question about the goal of
the syntactic annotation: The UD choice to favor
similar  structures  whenever  possible  leads  to
skewed  typological  similarity  measures.  Future
UD schemes should be evaluated as to the extent
that they allow avoiding catastrophes and captur-
ing  similarities  between  closely  related  struc-
tures.

The  ongoing  word  alignment  of  the  parallel
treebank will soon allow for more precise queries
concerning the differences or similarity between
the two languages. But just like for the annota-
tion, the word alignment, too, is already a struc-
tural  choice  (one-to-many  alignments?,  one-to-
zero alignments?) that determines which results
can finally be extracted. Ideally the word-align-
ment would allow for complementary measure-
ments that  cannot be obtained on the sole sen-

name advmod aux obj obl
Cantonese 13,74 48,82 100 28,08
Mandarin 3,81 35,16 100 19,67

tence aligned parallel treebank. Work in progress
on  a  parallel  treebank  online  query  tool  could
also benefit from the integration of these types of
statistical measures. It  would allow to not only
search  for  and  count  pre-discovered  structural
discrepancy, but rather permit exploring interest-
ing facts hidden in the raw data.
