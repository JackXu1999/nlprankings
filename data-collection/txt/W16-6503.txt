Abstract

Most previous research on young infants’

spoken word comprehension has focused on

monolinguals. These results may not gen-

eralize to non-monolingual populations be-

cause lexical processing may be more intri-

cate for infants exposed to more than one lan-

guage. Do toddlers learning multiple lan-

guages recognize words similarly to their

monolingual peers? Answering this question

will require extensive efforts, to which we

contribute word comprehension data collected

through a procedure aiming to be both pre-

cise and ecological. French-learning toddlers

(N = 38; age range 1;11-3;4) were tested in

their daycare, using a French-spoken prompt-

to-picture matching task implemented on a

child-friendly touch screen. Our results doc-

ument some differences in accuracy, but not

response time or number of trials completed,

among toddlers differing in the number of lan-

guages they routinely hear. Additionally, these

data suggest that it is feasible to collect good

quality data from multiple children tested at

once in daycares, opening the path to larger-

scale studies. Future research could disen-

tangle the many factors that are often em-

pirically confounded with monolingual versus

bilingual/multilingual status.

1 Introduction

Studying language acquisition among children ex-

posed to multiple languages is interesting for both

scientific and societal reasons. As to the former,

studies on bilingual and multilingual infant language

development could provide answers regarding the

cognitive organization of language, and further our

understanding of the system underlying early lan-

guage acquisition. To take one example, there is an

ongoing discussion regarding the role of the quantity

of input directly addressed to the child in lexical de-

velopment (Shneidman and Goldin-Meadow, 2012).

Children exposed to more than one language will on

average hear fewer words in each than a monolin-

gual peer - that is, provided all else is equal among

the two.

However, all else is frequently not equal when

comparing monolingual children and those routinely

exposed to more than one language. To begin with,

while many bi- and multi-lingual children are ex-

posed simultaneously to more than one language

from birth, for others the acquisition of their addi-

tional language(s) occurs later on, including once

the first language is already well established (de

Houwer, 2009). Particularly in the latter cases, hear-

ing multiple languages is correlated with immigrant

status, itself correlated with lower education and in-

come levels – which is itself correlated with lower

levels of parental speech to the child (Hoff, 2013).

As a result, studying acquisition in such populations

is both complicated, and particularly relevant if one

would hope to strive for equality in educational op-

portunities (Hoff, 2013). These arguments also un-

derline the profound societal relevance of studies on

bilingual acquisition.



Setting these confounds aside for the moment,

there is mounting evidence that monolinguals and

non-monolinguals differ in several ways when lexi-

cal development is considered. Specifically, vocabu-

lary sizes in monolingual preschoolers are compara-

ble to their bilingual peers when both languages are

combined together, and translation equivalents are

considered only once (Pearson et al., 1997). How-

ever, when lexica are evaluated separately, bilingual

children typically score lower than monolingual on

vocabulary tests targeting their common language

(Bialystok et al., 2010). These differences in vocab-

ulary size could be due to a number of reasons, but

by and large it appears that they emerge due to dif-

ferences in input quantity: as noted previously, when

exposed to several languages, bilingual children re-

ceive less input from each language than their mono-

lingual peers (Place and Hoff, 2011). Such differ-

ences in vocabulary size have been documented with

measures ranging from free production to standard-

ized tests of lexical comprehension administered by

an experimenter.

Further research suggests that bilinguals as a pop-

ulation vary on speed of lexical comprehension

in ways that may relate to their vocabulary size.

Marchman and colleagues used a looking-while-

listening task, where two visual referents are pre-

sented on the screen and a spoken prompt asks for

one of them (Marchman et al., 2010). Bilingual tod-

dlers were tested in both their languages, and their

parents were asked to complete a vocabulary check-

list for each language. The authors document a sig-

nificant correlation between speed of word recogni-

tion and vocabulary size within languages but not

across them; i.e., individual variation in parental re-

port of English vocabulary size predicted speed of

recognition for English, but not Spanish, items, and

vice versa. Since bilinguals have a smaller vocabu-

lary than monolinguals when languages are consid-

ered separately, it appears likely that they will also

be slower to recognize words. Although this con-

trast has not been carried out directly, comparison

with other work published by the same group con-

firms the prediction. Whereas bilingual 30-month-

olds averaged 860-870ms response times in either

language, Spanish-learning monolinguals averaged

900ms when tested much earlier, at 24 months (Hur-

tado et al., 2008); and English-learning monolin-

guals displayed these response times even younger,

at 18 months (Fernald et al., 1998).

In sum, previous research on lexical processing

suggests that bilinguals are at a disadvantage com-

pared to monolinguals. However, one recent study

using a laboratory-based touch-screen test found

that Canadian 2-year-olds’ performance (accuracy

and response time) in the common language did

not differ as a function of bilingual status (Poulin-

Dubois et al., 2013). It is possible that this touch-

screen task is a more accurate index of children’s

competence, since it has been separately found to

be a better predictor of later vocabulary than e.g.

parental report (Friend and Keplinger, 2008). If so,

other previous work may have underestimated bilin-

guals’ lexical abilities. An alternative explanation

holds that bilinguals and monolinguals in this sam-

ple may have been better matched on confounded

variables, such as parental socio-economic status,

than the American samples who are more commonly

studied. A final alternative is that the difference does

exist but is small enough to sometimes yield false

negatives. Indeed, Poulin-Dubois and colleagues

briefly point out that the difference is present numer-

ically, but may not have surfaced due to limitations

in statistical power. Teasing these three alternatives

apart requires gathering additional data with a simi-

lar touch-screen test.

Our study sought to contribute to the general line

of research documenting the relationship between

word comprehension and exposure to multiple lan-

guages. For that purpose we tested monolingual,

bilingual, and multilingual French toddlers in their

common language. Our goal was not to assess global

lexicon, but only to compare them on the one lan-

guage they all shared. We were inspired by Friend

et al. (2008)’s Computerized Comprehension Task

(CCT) when developing a two-alternative prompt-

to picture matching test on an iPad

R�
, and thus fol-

lowed their lead on most methodological choices

(Friend and Keplinger, 2008). Most saliently, we

had numerous trials sampling from three word cate-

gories (nouns, verbs, and adjectives) and three lev-

els of difficulties (described in detail in the Meth-

ods) so that our measure was more representative

of word processing in general. Unlike Friend and

colleagues, we used portable technology so as to

bring the test to the childrens natural environment,



the daycare, a setting which may also have leveling

properties by exposing all children (monolinguals

and non-monolinguals) to similar experiences. By

testing in three daycares located in the 13th neigh-

borhood in Paris, France, we were able to assess nat-

ural variation in lexical processing in children ex-

posed to one, two, or more languages. Although our

sample for the latter case is small, we believe there is

some interest in reporting on them separately due to

the scarcity of research on multilinguals (Unsworth,

2013, contains a review in current state of the art

on language acquisition among children exposed to

more than two languages).

2 Method

2.1 Participants

Results are based on data from 38 children (mono-

lingual n = 17; bilingual n = 13; multilingual n = 8;

M age = 2;8 - that is, 2 years and 8 months, range

1;11-3;4). Twenty-five additional toddlers could not

be included for various reasons (parents did not re-

turn the questionnaire for 12 children; 6 were ran

on a pilot version; 3 didn’t want to play with the

experimenters; 1 was absent on all test days; 2

had less than 30% exposure to French). The lin-

guistic background of the toddlers was determined

through a parental questionnaire that takes into ac-

count the amount of exposure and the time period

during which the child learned each language. We

classified as monolingual children who heard French

more than 70% of the time (i.e., other languages less

than 30% of the time). Bilinguals were exposed to

French and exactly one other language (English n =

5; Arabic n = 3; Mandarin Chinese n = 3; Japanese

n = 2; Italian n = 1; Spanish n = 1; German n = 1;

Sonink n = 1), and received these 2 languages be-

tween 30% and 70% of the time. Multilinguals were

children exposed to more than two languages, gen-

erally three or four with at least 30% of French ex-

posure (English n = 6; Hebrew n = 1; Spanish n =

2; Arabic n = 2; Chinese n = 3; Polish n = 1, Italian

n = 1; Tagalog n = 1; Ilocano n = 1; Russian n = 1;

Romanian n = 1; Lingala n = 1; Dutch n = 1; Wolof

n = 1; Creole n = 1).

2.2 Procedure and Stimuli

During the test, each child sat next to an experi-

menter in a quiet environment such as the library

of the daycare. The test was implemented on two

ipads

R�
covered with child-friendly protective cases

(Leader Price

R�
). Since two children were tested

at a time (each accompanied by one experimenter),

during the main task both child-experimenter dyads

wore soundproof age-appropriate headphones, con-

nected to their tablet via a splitter inserted through a

custom-made hole, to ensure accurate sound percep-

tion and minimize interaction across dyads.

The stimuli were selected using a procedure de-

scribed in more detail elsewhere (Maniel, 2016). In

a nutshell, there were a total of 44 pairs of words,

which included nouns (n = 23 pairs), verbs (n = 12)

and adjectives (n = 9) with diverse frequencies of

occurrence: high (n = 17 pairs), moderate (n = 14

pairs), low (n = 13 pairs). The frequency levels were

established as a function of word occurrence in two

public French corpora. Prompts were adapted to the

word category; for instance, for objects they were

”touche le X” touch the X, but for verbs ”touche

celui qui X” touch the one that Xs. Paired visual

stimuli were selected to be subjectively similar in

complexity and color. Pairs were also matched on

the following features: masculine/feminine; singu-

lar/plural; animals/people/objects. The touch-screen

test started with 3 training trials (one from each

word category, all of them high frequency; responses

were excluded from the analysis) followed by 41 test

ones. In each, an on-screen character with a pre-

recorded voice provided a prompt ”touche le X”,

that matched either the left or the right picture. A

correct response resulted in the on-screen charac-

ter providing positive feedback (e.g. one hears ”oui,

c’est ça!” yes, thats it! and the character jumps up

and down). If the touch was to the incorrect referent,

then no feedback was provided. The response time

was logged from the offset of the prompt. Follow-

ing the CCT, responses longer than 7s were excluded

from consideration for both response time and ac-

curacy analyses. The order of presentation of the

different test pairs was pseudo-randomized to avoid

having three trials of the same type in a sequence, or

more than two correct responses on the same side.

The child was free to stop the test early.



3 Results

Since we expected that the variances across the

groups would not be equal, we decided to use non-

parametric analyses. The Kruskal Wallis test was

used for initial comparisons combining all three

groups and, when significant, we followed up with

pairwise Welch’s tests. Scripts and data allowing

reproducibility of these results can be downloaded

from https://osf.io/u2xyc/.

We found no significant difference between the

groups in terms of the number of trials completed

and trials attempted (i.e., where a response was

recorded before 7 s) by the child [�

2
(2) = 2.25, p

= .33], although there was a numerical trend for

lower numbers of trials completed for children ex-

posed to more than one language (bilinguals com-

pleted 31, and attempted 29 on average; multilin-

guals completed 31, and attempted 28) than mono-

linguals (completed 35, and attempted 23).

Following criteria set in advance of data analyses,

only children having produced valid responses for at

least 9 trials were included for the accuracy analyses

(3 children were excluded). In these accuracy analy-

ses, results aligned with predictions made on the ba-

sis of number of languages in the input, with higher

percentages of correct responses for monolinguals

(monolingual, M = 86.93, SD = 13.46) than bilin-

guals (M = 73.86, SD = 19.31), and for the former

than multilinguals (M = 67.31, SD = 16.46; see Fig-

ure 1), differences that were significant in a three-

way comparison [�

2
(2) = 8.1, p = .02]. Pairwise

comparisons involving monolinguals achieved sig-

nificance in one-tailed Welch’s tests [versus bilin-

guals, t(18.95) = 1.99, p = .03; versus multilinguals

[t(12.11) = 2.89, p = .007]; but not that comparing

bilinguals versus multilinguals [t(16.76) = 0.81, p =

.21].

Response times were extracted from all correct

trials, and the median was estimated for children

having at least 4 valid responses, resulting in the

same 35 children being included (see Figure 2).

We report the median as a more accurate mea-

sure since distributions of reaction time are not nor-

mal. There were no significant differences between

groups [�

2
(2) = 2.36, p = .31], with numerically

shorter responses among monolinguals (Mdn = 2121

ms, SD = 379) than bilinguals (Mdn = 2461, SD =

551; t(18.78) = 1.47; p =.08); multilinguals (Mdn =

2401, SD = 565) were not slower than bilinguals.

4 Discussion

We found that all three groups completed over 30 tri-

als on average, a high number given their young age.

Additionally, analyses reported elsewhere (Maniel,

2016) demonstrate that these data are sensitive to a

number of individual characteristics, with strong in-

verse correlations between age and response time,

for instance. This gave us confidence to explore

the relationship between language experiences and

lexical outcome measures. Our results show the

same pattern as the one previous study using touch

screens: Just like Poulin-Dubois et al. (2013), we

find a numerical advantage whereby monolinguals

have higher accuracies and faster responses than

bilinguals, but the difference is not always statisti-

cally significant.

The fact that some of these differences did not

reach significance could be lead to three (mutually

compatible) explanations. First, laboratory-testing

may lead to more sensitive measures than non-

laboratory testing. Second, testing toddlers on just

one of their languages could narrow group differ-

ences compared to when bilingual toddlers have to

complete the same test in both languages, due to in-

terference effects. Neither of these two explanations

fit current data well since they both predict greater

differences in Poulin-Dubois et al. (2013) than here

because they tested bilingual children in both their

languages, and they tested in the lab, unlike us – yet

we obtained similar results. Third, perhaps touch-

based tests are not as sensitive as other measures,

because an overt motor response is required that re-

duces the impact of cognitive differences in process-

ing. Only one study has been carried out compar-

ing visual and touch-based responses, and data per-

tained monolingual 16-month-olds (Hendrickson et

al., 2015). In this (admittedly much younger) sam-

ple, visual and haptic responses were weakly cor-

related (r = .4), but haptic responses were more

strongly correlated with parental vocabulary reports

than visual response times (r = .3 versus r = .15,

respectively), lending no support to the contention

that haptic responses are less sensitive to individual

variation than visual responses (at least in the cur-

rent procedure, with visual and auditory items that

do not repeat, varied in form, etc.).

All this being said, we believe that it is prema-

ture, not to mention statistically inappropriate, to in-

terpret numeric results as evidence for differences

between the groups, or p-values above .05 as evi-

dence for equality between groups. Instead, we con-

tend that the use of such a portable method could al-

low more widespread testing, leading to the larger

sample sizes that are necessary to capture effects

that may be relatively subtle, and that are embedded

in an intrinsically variable population. Indeed, we

observed here that bilinguals tended to have larger

standard deviations than their monolingual peers,

in consonance with the expectation that the former

population contains children growing up in a range

of conditions. In future work, we intend to test more

toddlers so as to increase our statistical power. This

is crucial given that in our sample, as in previous

work on the topic, we observe a wide range of vari-

ation in a number of key factors, such as the rela-

tive proportions in which the languages are present

in the environment and caregivers’ education level.

Although in theory a bigger sample size could al-

low measurements on the impact of specific char-

acteristics of the other languages on the common

language (such as proportion of words that are cog-

nates), we believe we would not be in an ideal posi-

tion to investigate this given the astounding variabil-

ity in terms of the other languages spoken (see Meth-

ods section). This kind of question would benefit

from cross-lab collaborations studying bilingual and

multilingual populations where the other languages

are more stable, such as English-French in Canada

or Quichua-Spanish in Argentina. Getting a better

handle on such empirical variation is a pre-requisite

to attempting a complete answer to key questions on

lexical development, including in the case of chil-

dren exposed to multiple languages.
