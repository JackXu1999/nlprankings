Abstract

Condescending language use is caustic; it can
bring dialogues to an end and bifurcate com-
munities. Thus, systems for condescension de-
tection could have a large positive impact. A
challenge here is that condescension is often
impossible to detect from isolated utterances,
as it depends on the discourse and social con-
text. To address this, we present TALKDOWN,
a new labeled dataset of condescending lin-
guistic acts in context. We show that extending
a language-only model with representations of
the discourse improves performance, and we
motivate techniques for dealing with the low
rates of condescension overall. We also use
our model to estimate condescension rates in
various online communities and relate these
differences to differing community norms.

1 Introduction

Condescending language use can derail conversa-
tions and, over time, disrupt healthy communi-
ties. The caustic nature of this language traces
in part to the ways that it keys into differing so-
cial roles and levels of power (Fournier et al.,
2002). It is common for people to be condescend-
ing without realizing it (Wong et al., 2014), but
a lack of intent only partly mitigates the dam-
age it can cause. Thus, condescension detection
is a potentially high-impact NLP task that could
open the door to many applications and future re-
search directions, including, for example, support-
ing productive interventions in online communi-
ties (Spertus, 1997), educating people who use
condescending language in writing, helping lin-
guists to understand the implicit linguistic acts as-
sociated with condescension, and helping social
scientists to study the relationship between con-
descension and other variables like gender or so-
cioeconomic status.

Progress on this task is currently limited by a

lack of high-quality labeled data. A deeper chal-
lenge is that condescension is often impossible to
detect from isolated utterances. First, a charac-
teristic of condescending language is that it is not
overtly negative or critical – it might even include
(insincere) praise (Huckin, 2002). Second, con-
descension tends to rest on a pair of conflicting
pragmatic presuppositions: a speaker presumption
that the speaker has higher social status than the
listener, and a listener presumption that this is in-
correct. For example, an utterance that is entirely
friendly if said by one friend to another might be
perceived as highly condescending if said by a
customer to a store clerk. In such cases, the social
roles of the participants shape the language in par-
ticular ways to yield two very different outcomes.

In this paper, we seek to facilitate the develop-
ment of models for condescension detection by in-
troducing TALKDOWN, a new labeled dataset of
condescending acts in context. The dataset is de-
rived from Reddit, a thriving set of online commu-
nities that is diverse in content and tone. We focus
on COMMENT and REPLY pairs of the sort given
in Figure 1, in which the REPLY targets a specific
quoted span (QUOTED) in the COMMENT as be-
ing condescending. The examples were multiply-
labeled by crowdsourced workers, which ensures
high-quality labels and allows us to include nu-

anced examples that require human judgment.
Our central hypothesis is that context is decisive

for condescension detection. To test this, we eval-
uate models that seek to make this classification
based only on the QUOTED span in the COMMENT
as well as extensions of those models that include
summary representations of the preceding linguis-
tic context, which we treat as an approximation
of the discourse context in which the condescen-
sion accusation was made. Models with contex-
tual representations are far superior, bolstering the
original hypothesis. In addition, we show that
these models are robust to highly imbalanced test-
ing scenarios that approximate the true low rate of
condescension in the wider world. Such robust-
ness to imbalanced data is an important prerequi-
site for deploying models like this. Finally, we ap-
ply our model to a wide range of subreddits, argu-
ing that our estimated rates of condescension are
related to different community norms.

2 The TALKDOWN Corpus

We chose Reddit as the basis for our corpus for a
few key reasons. First, it is a large, publicly avail-
able dataset from an active set of more than one
million user-created online communities (subred-
dits).1 Second, it varies in both content and tone.
Third, users can develop strong identities on the
site, which could facilitate user-level modeling,
but these identities are generally pseudonymous,
which is useful when studying charged social phe-
nomena (Hamilton et al., 2017; Wang and Jurgens,
2018). Fourth, the subreddit structure of the site
creates opportunities to study the impact of conde-
scension on community structure and norms (Bun-
tain and Golbeck, 2014; Lin et al., 2017; Zhang
et al., 2017; Chandrasekharan et al., 2018).

The basis for our work is the Reddit data
dump 2006–2018.2 We first extracted COM-
MENT/REPLY pairs in which the REPLY contains
a condescension-related word. After further filter-
ing out self-replies and moderator posts, and nor-
malizing links and references, we obtain 2.62M
COMMENT/REPLY pairs.

Not all of these examples truly involve the RE-
PLY saying that the QUOTED span is condescend-
ing. Our simple pattern-based extraction method
is not sufficiently sensitive. To address this, we
conducted an annotation project on Amazon Me-

chanical Turk. Our own initial assessment of 200
examples using a five-point Likert scale revealed
two things that informed this project.

First, we saw a clear split in the positive in-
stances of condescension. In some, specific lin-
guistic acts are labeled as condescending (“This
is really condesending”), whereas others involve
general user-level accusations that are not tied to
specific acts (“You’re so condescending”). We
chose to focus on the specific linguistic acts. They
provide a more objective basis for annotation, and
they can presumably be aggregated to provide an
empirically grounded picture of user-level behav-
ior (or others’ reactions to such behavior). Thus,
for positive instances of condescension, we further
limited our attention to COMMENT/REPLY pairs in
which the REPLY contains a direct quotation from
the COMMENT, using fuzzy match based on Lev-
enshtein distance (Navarro, 2001), as illustrated in
Figure 1. We extracted 66K such examples. Some
statistics on these examples is given in Table 1.

Second, with the above ambiguity addressed,
the signal of condescending or not is mostly clear.
Thus, we designed the annotation project around
a three-way multiple choice question: conde-
scending, not condescending, and cannot decide.
Each task began with instructions and two train-
ing questions, following by 10 different COM-
MENT/REPLY pairs to be labeled. Appendix A.2
provides screenshots of the annotation interface.

To process the annotations, we filtered out the
work of annotators who did not correctly answer
the training questions. The remaining annotators
have moderate to substantial agreement (Fleiss
κ = 0.593; Fleiss 1971; Landis and Koch 1977).
We then used Expectation–Maximization, as in
Dempster et al. 1977, to assign labels. This yields
slightly better quality in our hand-inspection than
labels by majority vote, presumably because it
factors individual worker reliability into the de-
cision making. In the end, we obtained 4,992
valid labeled instances: 65.2% labeled as conde-

scending (henceforth, positive), and 34.8% as non-
condescending (henceforth, negative).3

To fully balance the dataset, we pulled out
one random month’s data for each year in 2011
to 2017. We extracted instances using the
same methods as described above, but we fil-
tered out COMMENT/REPLY pairs in which a
condescension-related word appeared. Our final
dataset thus consists of annotated positive and
negative instances, with supplemental randomly-
sampled negative instances. For our experiments,
we partitioned the data into 80% train, 10% devel-
opment, and 10% test splits. In addition, to simu-
late real-world situations, we built a dataset with a
1:20 ratio of positive to negative instances.4 The
basic statistics of the dataset are shown in Table 2.

3 Experiments

We now establish some baselines for the TALK-
DOWN Corpus and begin to test the hypothesis
that contextual representations are valuable for
this task. To do this, we use the BERT model of
Devlin et al. (2019), which uses a Transformer-
based encoder architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017)
to learn word representations by training against
a masked language modeling task and a next-
sentence prediction task. Our models are initial-
ized with the pretrained representations released
by the BERT team and a fully connected layer on
the top (Figure 4 in Devlin et al. 2019), which is
then fine-tuned to our dataset (Peters et al., 2019).
We explore both BERT Base (BERTB) and BERT
Large (BERTL),5 to determine whether the added
expense of using BERTL is justified. Appendix B
provides details on our process of hyperparameter
tuning and optimization.

3There was just one case where cannot decide was the
chosen label; it was in Spanish, so we excluded it and added
a language classification step to our preprocessing pipeline.

4To the best of our knowledge, there is no prior work
on what percentage of conversations on Reddit (or, more
broadly, in daily conversations) are condescending. Thus, we
chose the ratio based on informal observations on Reddit.

5The whole-word masking model was used as it performs
better than the original one in multiple benchmarks.

dure in Appendix B.

3.1 Predicting Condescension

Table 3 summarizes the results of our core exper-
iments. Input 1 and Input 2 describe the basis
for the feature representations. Thus, for example,
QUOTED∧CONTEXT is a model that uses both the
quoted span and the preceding linguistic context.
We report two testing scenarios: Balanced and Im-
balanced, in which there are 20 negative examples
for each positive example.

The results clearly support our hypothesis that
context matters; using the QUOTED part and CON-
TEXT together give us 3–4% boost in macro-F1 us-
ing the same model architecture. In addition, we
see that increasing the capacity of the model also
helps, though more modestly. It’s noteworthy that
the performance of using the QUOTED part is bet-
ter than that of using CONTEXT alone, though the
QUOTED part is roughly three times shorter. Thus,
there is a strong signal in the QUOTED part – the
replier chose this span for a reason – but the con-
text contains a signal as well.

Figure 2: Condescension rates over time in a selection of subreddits, as predicted by our best model. The time
window is centered around the 2016 U.S. Presidential Elections. We calculate a rolling mean with a window size
of 5 and use July 2016 only for smoothing. We obtain 95% confidence intervals via bootstrapping.

3.2 Imbalanced Testing Scenarios
Imbalanced testing scenarios are more challeng-
ing, but they also better reflect usage rates of con-
descending language in public forums like Red-
dit. To further understand how best to get traction
on this problem, we explored a range of differ-
ent methods for creating training data. Our results
are summarized in Table 4. As expected, the bal-
anced problem is best addressed with a balanced
dataset. For the imbalanced problem, we found
that an oversampling ratio of 2 to 4 yielded the
best performance. Our full QUOTED ∧ CONTEXT
model is again clearly superior in these scenarios.

3.3 Condescension Rates Across Subreddits
Our hope for TALKDOWN is that it will play a role
in developing systems that can help identify con-
descending acts on social media. This will depend
on models trained on TALKDOWN being able to
get an accurate read on condescension at scale. As
a first step towards assessing this capability, we
ran our models on 14 subreddits, over the time pe-
riod of July 2016 to December 2016, which covers
the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election, an event that
we expect to influence condescension rates in var-

ious ways across Reddit. Appendix C lists these
subreddits along with their post counts and esti-
mated average rates of condescension. Figure 2
highlights a selection of them.

As a baseline, we include a 10% random sam-
ple from the top 100 most active subreddits.6

Consistently above this baseline are ‘politics’ and
‘funny’. It makes sense that an overtly political
subreddit would show a high rate of condescen-
sion (as do ‘news’ and ‘worldnews’; Appendix C):
it’s a contentious topic in a contentious time pe-
riod; see also the rising rate for ‘The Donald’ in
the post-election period. It is more surprising that
‘funny’ shows the highest rates. We do not have
a deep understanding of why this is, but it could
trace to our model confusing irony and sarcasm
with condescension.

Below the baseline are ‘AskWomen’ and ‘poke-
mon’. We expect ‘pokemon’ to have low rates
of condescension, as it strikes us as a supportive
community. However, one might be surprised to
see ‘AskWomen’ so low, especially as compared
with ‘AskMen’, which has high rates in general.

6This is derived from the ‘subscribers’ section in http:
//redditlist.com/all, excluding ‘announcements’.

There is wide support for the idea that women ex-
perience more condescension than men do (Hall
and Braunwald, 1981; Harris, 1993; McKechnie
et al., 1998; Cortina et al., 2002; Trix and Psenka,
2003), as reflected in the recent lexical innovation
mansplaining, which can be roughly paraphrased
as ‘a man condescending to a woman’.7 However,
community norms on ‘AskWomen’ and ‘AskMen’
are likely shaping these outcomes. Whereas the
description for ‘AskWomen’ says it is “curated to
promote respectful and on-topic discussions, and
not serve as a debate subreddit”, the description
for ‘AskMen’ ends with “And don’t be an asshole.
Also, go away.”

4 Conclusion

We introduced TALKDOWN, a new annotated
Reddit corpus of condescending linguistic acts in
context. Using BERT, we established baseline
models that suggest this is a challenging task,
and one that benefits from rich contextual repre-
sentations. Finally, in qualitative analyses on di-
verse subreddits, we offered initial evidence that
models trained on TALKDOWN generalize to new
data, a prerequisite for using them to help im-
prove online communities via condescension de-
tection. The full dataset with the pretrained BERT
model is available at http://github.com/
zijwang/talkdown.

A Data

A.1 In-house Annotation Analysis

Figure 3 shows the five-point Likert scale anno-
tations between two in-house annotators. It can
be seen that the signal of condescending or not is
clear, and the agreement level between the two an-
notations is substantial: the Fleiss’ κ is 0.613 for
the five-point scale and 0.732 when normalized to
three-point scale used in the paper (Fleiss, 1971;
Landis and Koch, 1977).

A.2 Annotation Interface

In this section, we show examples of the anno-
tation interface we used on Amazon Mechanical
Turk: Figure 4 and Figure 5.

Annotators were presented with the task name,
the instructions, and two simple training ques-
tions, followed by a warning in red saying they
needed to pass the training questions to proceed
(Figure 4). They had unlimited trials for the train-
ing questions, and explanations (for both correct
and incorrect answers) were presented directly af-
ter each trial. This helped the annotators learn how
to approach the task.

After they passed the training questions, they
were prompted that they could start to do the
test questions (Figure 5). The interface of the
test questions was similar to that of the training
questions, but without explanations after selec-
tions. We explicitly checked that the annotators
had made selections on each test question before
submission, while this was not forced for train-
ing questions. This was to filter out possibly low-
quality annotations, where the annotators did not
pay attention to the instructions.

B Model Hyperparameters

Our BERT models were trained using a set of hy-
perparameters based on the recommendations in
Devlin et al. 2019. Specifically, we set:

• Model Architecture:

– BERTB: Bert Base, Cased
– BERTL: Bert Large, Cased, with whole-

word masking

• Learning rate: {0.5, 0.8, 1, 2, 3, 5} · 10−5

• Epoch: 2, 3

• Batch size: 32

• Max sequence length: 512

When optimizing these models, we set the batch
size to 32 in order to ensure there was at least one
positive instance per mini-batch. Grid search was
performed with different learning rates and over-
sampling ratios, and best models were selected
based on the best performance on the development
set under the imbalanced setting. We found that
oversampling 2 to 4 times the positive class (i.e.,
10%–20% of the number of instances in the nega-
tive class) generally yielded good performance in
all the experiments we ran. For all experiments,
we used the HuggingFace PyTorch implementa-
tion of BERT.8

Table 5: Subreddit experiment statistics. The raw data
are from the Reddit dump from July 2016 to December
2016. ‘Pairs’ are COMMENT/REPLY pairs as defined
in the paper. ‘Mean rate’ is the mean rate of conde-
scension as estimated by our best model, and ‘Std. err’
gives the associated standard error. ‘random’ is a 10%
random sample from the top 100 active subreddits over
the same time period.
