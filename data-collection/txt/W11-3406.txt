Abstract 

 

This paper attempts to report on developing 

a WordNet for Urdu on the basis of Hindi 

WordNet. The resource currently contains 

about 50000 unique words organized in 

28967 synsets.  The paper also discusses the 

problems encountered along the way of 

transliteration from Hindi WordNet and 

manual cleaning. It concludes with the 

planned future work. 

 

1 Introduction 

WordNet is one of the useful and important 

lexical resources based on the formalisms 

developed in lexical semantics. It defines 

different senses associated with the meaning of a 

word and other well-defined lexical relations 

such as synonyms, antonyms, hypernym, 

hyponyms, meronyms and holonyms. WordNet 

is used for many natural language  processing  

and  computational  linguistic  tasks  such  as  

Word  Sense Disambiguation,  Word  Similarity,  

Information  Retrieval  and  Extraction and  

Machine Translation, etc.  

The motivation for the creation of Urdu 

WordNet is to provide a lexical resource that can 

be used as a tool for enhancing the performance 

of machine translation and information retrieval. 

We have attempted to provide a basic resource 

that can be used in above mentioned NLP 

applications. As the manual construction of Urdu 

WordNet from scratch would be very costly and 

time consuming, we have used the WordNet 

expansion approach. Lexical information is 

extracted from Hindi WordNet due to similarity 

between two languages. 

Hindi and Urdu are grammatically similar 

languages but written in two dissimilar scripts 

Devanagri and Arabic respectively. These 

languages share a large number of words, 

morphology, vocabulary, and cultural heritage. It 

is easier for both speakers to verbally understand 

each other but they face the barrier of different 

script incase of written expression. Hindi and 

Urdu are spoken by more than 60 million people 

in India and Pakistan (Language Summary, 

http://www.ethnologue.com/ethno_docs/distribut

ion.asp?by=size). 

The roadmap for the rest of paper is as 

follows: Section 2 discusses Hindi and Urdu 

Scripts along Hindi WordNet. Methodology for 

development of Urdu WordNet is described in 

Section 3 and statistics of system is given in 

Section 4. The current status and future work is 

discussed in Section 5.  Finally section 6 

concludes the paper. 

2 Literature Overview 

Urdu (اردو) is written in Persio-Arabic script and 

normally in Nastaliqb writing style (Hussain, 

2004). It is a right-to-left script and the shape of 

character differ depending on its position in 

word i.e. shape of character would be different 

in initial, middle, and end of word. Urdu is 

written in bidirectional form i.e. letters are 

written from right-to-left and numbers from left-

to-right format. Urdu is written with consonantal 

letters and aerabs. The vocalic content is 

specified by using the aerab with letters. Aerab 

position can be on the top and bottom of letter. A 

sentence illustrating Urdu is given below: 

ی ہ ے۔
 
اب ھی ج 
ه لک ط می 

 
 اردو عرب ی رسم الخ

(Urdu Arbi Rasm-ul-Khat mein likhi jati hay) 

(Urdu is written in Arabic script) 

 

Hindi (हिन्दी) is written in Devanagri script, 
descended from the Brahmi script. It is the 

simplified version of Sanskrit, written in left-to-

31



right direction. In Hindi each consonant letter by 

default inherits vowel which can be altered or 

muted by means of diacritics or matra. Vowels 

can be written as independent letters or by using 

a diacritic marks.  Two or more consonants may 

occur together in clusters called Conjunct.  A 

sentence written in Hindi is given below. 

हिन्दी हििंदसू्तान की कौमी ज़बान िै. 
(Hindi India ki Quomi Zuban hay) 

(Hindi is the national language of India) 

 

Hindi WordNet (HWN) is lexical database 

inspired by the English WordNet (Miller, 

1993).The words in HWN are grouped together 

according to their similarity of meanings. Two 

words that can be interchanged in a context are 

synonymous in that context. Synsets or the 

synonym sets are the basic building blocks of 

HWN.  For each word there is a synonym set, or 

synsets representing one lexical concept.  There 

are 10 relations in HWN; Synonymy, 

Hypernymy / Hyponymy, Antonymy, 

Meronymy / Holonymy, Gradation, Entailment, 

Troponymy and Causative (Dipak , 2002). The 

Hindi WordNet deals only with the open class 

words. Thus, HWN contains the following 

categories of words. The details of Hindi 

WordNet are given in Table 1. 

 

Category Count 

Noun 56623 

Verbs 3894 

Adjectives 13702 

Adverbs 1276 

Synsets 30977 

Table 1: Hindi WordNet 

 

Hindi WordNet is used as a pivot WordNet 

for building WordNet of Ando-Aryan languages 

eg. Marathi WordNet, Sanskrit WordNet 

(Kulkarni, 2010), Nepali WordNet (Chakrabarty, 

2006) , Bengali WordNet. The Expansion 

Approach of WordNet (Vossen, 2002) creation 

is used as method for creation of a new Word 

Nets.  This expansion approach is also being 

used for development of Urdu WordNet by 

Tafseer et.al (Tafseer Ahmed, 2010). 

They developed Urdu WordNet by extracting 

information contained in existing Hindi 

WordNet. To overcome the scriptural barrier 

they used transliteration. The lexical information 

is obtained by using the Hindi WordNet API. 

The gloss with the example sentence and the 

synset description is left out into Urdu WordNet. 

3 Methodology 

Because of the high degree of similarity between 

the Urdu and Hindi, we have picked up the 

Hindi WordNet as the pivot WordNet. The 

HWN offline version of 2.1 is being used that 

provides information of synset and senses. The 

Hindi WordNet database is picked up from 

(http://www.cfilt.iitb.ac.in/wordnet/webhwn/do

wnloaderInfo.php) and transliterated it into 

Urdu. Hindi to Urdu WordNet conversion 

process is shown in Figure 1.    

 

 
Figure 1: Hindi to Urdu WordNet Conversion 

 

For the automatic transliteration we have 

developed the software which transliterates the 

Hindi script into Urdu script. For mapping of 

Hindi consonants, and vowels into Urdu number 

of rules are used depending on the position in the 

word i.e. same Hindi vowel would be mapped to 

different Urdu characters at the start, middle, and 

at the end of word e.g. ə is mapped to Alef ( ا) + 

Zabar   َ  at the start of a word and by Zabar   َ  in 

the middle of a word. These rules are discussed 

in (Abbas Malik, 2008).   

The transliteration system does not resolve 

the problem of multi-equivalences. For example 

the Hindi 'त' can be mapped to 'ت' (Tay) and ' 

 Tuay).  A list of multi-equivalence Hindi)'ط

character is given in Table 2. 

The multi-equivalence problem from Hindi to 

Urdu transliteration is problematic which needs 

32



to be solved. An automated method is applied to 

resolve this by analyzing the Urdu character 

frequency using an Urdu corpus i.e. to resolve 

the above problem the system map 'त' to 'ت' 

(Tay) due to  more frequency of 'ت'(Tay) as 

compared to ' ط'(Tuay) .   

Hindi Urdu 

अ ا، آ (Alif-Mad, Alif) 
त ت، ط(Tuay, Tay) 
स ث،س،ص (Suad, Seen, Say) 

ि ح،ہ(Hay) 
ज़ ز،ذ،ژ،ض،ظ(Zueen, Zuad, Yeh, 

Zaal, Zeh) 

क ق،ک(Kaf) 
Table 2: Multiple Urdu characters for one Hindi 

character 
   

Afterwards, multi-equivalence problem is 

resolved manually by analyzing the text.    

Although Hindi and Urdu are grammatically 

similar languages and share a large number of 

words, morphology, vocabulary and cultural 

heritage. But still there are number of Hindi 

words that are not used in Urdu. Therefore there 

is need to remove the Hindi words like ی رن
 
ت
 
 ان

(Anteeran) (अिंतीरन, fail) from Urdu WordNet. 
There are two steps to do this First find out the 

corresponding Urdu word and Second discard 

original Hindi Word. The deletion of Hindi word 

is shown in Figure 2.

Since it is currently in development phase so, 

new synset will get introduced in UWN. The 

front-end of the tool has been implemented in 

.NET. The application interface is connected at 

the backend with text files of synsets.  The data 

is divided into 4 files i.e. Urdu-common, Urdu-

core, Urdu-full and English.  The synset entry 

format in file is shown in Figure 4. 

 

ID: The synset identifier. 

CAT: The syntactic category of the sense. 

CONCEPT: It explains the concept represented 

by the synset. 

EXAMPLE: It gives the usage of the words of 

the synsets in the sentence 

SYNSET-URDU: It gives the set of synonyms 

for the sense in the Urdu language

At present the offline version of Urdu 

WordNet is available which can be made 

available online after proper security 

implementation. 

 

5 Discission & Future Work 

This paper presents experience of building Urdu 

WordNet by Using the Hindi WordNet. The 

current Urdu WordNet does not provide the full-

fledged lexical information of Urdu Words but, 

it can be used to extract the sense and synset 

information. 

Although new Urdu words are added in Urdu 

WordNet which were missing in Hindi 

WordNet. Still there is need to add more Persian 

and Arabic load Urdu words to cover vocabulary 

of Urdu. 

Diacritics are partially handled in Urdu 

WordNet. Currently there is no clear distinction 

between two words which have same written 

expression in case of no diacritic e.g. the ا ی 
 
َن   ن 

(ban-na)(making) and word ا ی 
 
ُن  (bun-na)(knitting) ن 

are written as ا ی 
 
ن  ban-na) in Urdu WordNet. The) ن 

details of these words are given in Figure 4 & 

Figure 5. The Urdu WordNet system needs to be 

mature enough to handle diacritics. This can be 

achieved by adding up the diacritics in Urdu 

WordNet database.

Figure 6: WordNet Entry for  ا ی 
 
ن  (bun-na)(Knitting) ن 

 

The semantic relations such like antonymy, 

hypernymy, hyponymy, me-ronymy, holonymy, 

troponymy, entailment etc. are ignored in Urdu 

WordNet. These relationships can be added to 

provide complete lexical information of Word. 

The extension of Urdu WordNet further involves 

work in the area of compound words especially 

in the implementation of complex predicates e.g. 

34



ا ل گی 
ک
 
 nikle gaya) (went out). In Urdu 20% verb) ن

forms in the running text are compound verbs 

(Compound Verb, 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_verb). 

So, there is need to add complex predicates 

which are used more frequently than normal 

verb.   

Currently Compound words (Noun, adverbs) 

e.g. ي ست  ي آہ 
ست   Ahista Ahista) (slowely Slowely) are) آہ 

joined using “–“instead of Zero Width noun-

joiner. There is need to add mechanism into 

WordNet tool to handle this issue.  

6 Conclusion  

In this paper, we present a report on 

development of Urdu WordNet by extracting 

information contained in existing Hindi 

WordNet. The scriptural barrier between two 

languages is crossed by using automatic and 

manual transliteration.  Despite the similarity 

between two languages, concept translation is 

employed to remove Hindi words from Urdu 

WordNet.  New Urdu words are also added in 

WordNet which are not present in Hindi 

WordNet.
