Abstract

Social media’s popularity in society and re-
search is gaining momentum and simultane-
ously increasing the importance of short tex-
tual content such as microblogs. Microblogs
are affected by many factors including the
news media, therefore, we exploit sentiments
conveyed from news to detect and classify sen-
timent in microblogs. Given that texts can deal
with the same entity but might not be vastly re-
lated when it comes to sentiment, it becomes
necessary to introduce further measures en-
suring the relatedness of texts while leverag-
ing the contained sentiments. This paper de-
scribes ongoing research introducing distribu-
tional semantics to improve the exploitation
of news-contained sentiment to enhance mi-
croblog sentiment classification.

1 Introduction

In our increasingly digital society, we are subject
to a deluge of unfiltered information not always
objective or unbiased. The popularity of social
media has made it a gateway to digital news con-
tent with 23% of the population in 2017 preferring
this medium as a source of news1. A particular
case is Twitter and with the rise in popularity of
this medium, short texts rich in information and/or
sentiment are becoming a relevant source of infor-
mation for the sharing of news stories (Mitchell
and Page, 2015). However, traditional news are
still important and at least as influential as digital
media; in 2017, 32% of the people worldwide ac-
cessed digital news directly on a news website1.
In Twitter, over 85% of the retweets contain news
mentions (Kwak et al., 2010). The diffusion of in-
formation is also crucial; people view what friends
share leading to a fast diffusion of information
with 75% of the total retweets occurring within a

day (Lerman and Ghosh, 2010; Kwak et al., 2010).
This effect, combined with a higher perceived trust
of shared information by friends, can lead to the
construction of opinions based on already opin-
ionated content (Zhao et al., 2011; Turcotte et al.,
2015).

The importance of microblogs and news arti-
cles, their similar instantaneous availability, and
their topic intersections lead us to explore how
news articles and microblogs affect each other
and, in detail, how the sentiments contained in
both affect each other. This paper presents on-
going research dealing with this question and
utilises distributional semantics, in detail, word
embeddings, the cosine similarity, and the word
mover’s distance, to improve the modeling of the
conveyance of news-contained sentiment on mi-
croblogs, aiming to enhance microblog sentiment
classification.

2 Background

In the financial domain, prior research has shown
the connection between sentiments and the mar-
ket dynamics, exposing the financial domain as a
relevant area for sentiment analysis in text (Van
De Kauter et al., 2015; Kearney and Liu, 2014).
Sentiments are contained in various forms of text
including news and microblogs. It has been shown
that positive news tend to lift markets whereas bad
news tend to lower the markets (Schuster, 2003;
Van De Kauter et al., 2015). Past research mainly
focuses on news, particularly news titles (i.e head-
lines) (Nassirtoussi et al., 2014; Kearney and Liu,
2014). However, not only sentiment contained in
news is an important factor for the markets. For
example, Bollen et al. (2011) linked changes in
public mood to value shifts in the Dow Jones In-
dustrial Index three to four days later. With an in-
creasing magnitude of instantly available informa-

tion, factors affecting people’s sentiment rise. This
includes other people’s textually-expressed senti-
ment since information is not always presented in
a neutral manner. However, the relation between
sentiments across different data sources, how they
affect each other, and how this can be leveraged for
sentiment classification has not been investigated
yet.

2.1 Linking Sentiments Across Data Sources

Daudert et al. (2018) goes a step in this direction
and exploits news sentiment to improve microblog
sentiment classification. Their work utilises an
entity-based approach which, given data anno-
tated with sentiment, an entity e, and a period
p, calculates the average sentiment for entity e
in period p. The authors used a news dataset
and calculated an average sentiment per company
for news published between March 11th and 18th

2016 which was then used as additional informa-
tion. Their assumption that within a certain pe-
riod sentiments regarding the same entity should
be similar across different data sources was ex-
amined. Using the average news sentiment per-
forms well in periods when there is an overall
sentiment other than neutral; in periods when the
overall sentiment is neutral or balanced, a more
sophisticated approach is needed. A neutral over-
all sentiment is achieved when positive and neg-
ative sentiment counteract with each other, inde-
pendently of the number of news where each senti-
ment is expressed, whilst a balanced overall senti-
ment is achieved when the number of positive and
negative news regarding a certain entity is similar.
Given this, it becomes important to take a deeper
look at news and microblogs as not all news are
equally important to each microblog dealing with
the same entity. Therefore, this research employs a
distributional semantics approach to remove noise
in terms of microblog-unrelated news sentiment
although dealing with the same entity. To the
best of our knowledge, only the previously men-
tioned work has started investigating the relations
between the sentiments and leveraged them for mi-
croblog sentiment classification, hence, there is no
research on the use of distributional semantics for
sentiment linking. On the other hand, research tar-
geting the field of semantic enrichment is avail-
able and it is particularly relevant when address-
ing the linking of news and microblogs (e.g. Guo
et al. (2013); Wei et al. (2014); Abel et al. (2011);

Tsagkias et al. (2011)). Abel et al. (2011) sug-
gests five different approaches of linking news to
tweets: 1) a strict URL-based strategy, 2) a lenient
URL-based strategy, 3) a bag-of-words strategy,
4) a hashtag-based strategy, and 5) an entity-based
strategy. Strategy 5) comes close to what has been
explored by Daudert et al. (2018) whereby our ap-
proach is inspired by 3), employing it as an add-
on to 5). Other related research considering the
combination of semantic similarity and sentiment
analysis are (Tang et al., 2016; Poria et al., 2016).
Poria et al. (2016) developed a Latent Dirichlet Al-
location algorithm considering the semantic simi-
larity between word pairs, instead of only utilis-
ing a word frequency measure, thus, capable of
capturing opinions and sentiments that are implic-
itly expressed in a text and, overall, contributing
to improved clustering. Tang et al. (2016) focused
on learning word embeddings defined not only by
context but also by sentiment. Their approach is
able to better capture nearest neighboring vectors
not only through their semantic similarity but also
favoring the same sentiment polarity. This novel
idea of utilising word embeddings to better cap-
ture polarity in documents was initially brought up
by Maas et al. (2011).

The work described in this paper aims to ad-
dress the existing knowledge gap concerning the
application of distributional semantics for senti-
ment linking and assigning.

3 Methodology

The work performed is divided into two parts:
the preparation of the data, and its use in a Ma-
chine Learning (ML) prediction model. Through-
out this paper, we implement the methodology de-
scribed by Daudert et al. (2018), utilising the same
datasets (section 3.1) and experimental setup (sec-
tion 3.4). We extend their previous work by im-
proving the method to link a news sentiment to a
microblog as well as to assign a news sentiment to
a microblog (section 3.2).

The aim of this research is to explore the rela-
tion of sentiments between news and microblogs,
hence, the linking of both data types becomes nec-
essary. To fulfill this task, we leverage a microblog
and a complimentary news dataset covering the
same period and entities. For each microblog in
the dataset, we model the sentiment conveyance
between the news sentiment and the microblogs
sentiment by assigning one news sentiment ac-



109

cording to each of the different methods as de-
scribed in 3.2; these are then used as additional
features for the Support Vector Machine (SVM).

This SVM is trained and tested with the datasets
mentioned in section 3.1, aiming to explore
whether the consideration of textual similarities
for modeling the conveyed news sentiment can
add value to the microblog sentiment classifica-
tion. To investigate this, we compare a classi-
fication (1) purely based on microblog messages
(table 2, MT) with (2) a classification based on
microblog messages and entity-based news sen-
timent (table 2, ES Agg.), and (3) classifications
based on microblog messages and context-based
news sentiment (table 2, columns highlighted in
gray).

entities in the datasets.

3.1 Data

This research makes use of two datasets: a mi-
croblog dataset (M) and a microblogs-related news
dataset (MRN), represented in Figure 1. Dataset
M contains microblogs from Twitter2 as well as
StockTwits3 and was initially created for the Se-
meval 2017 Task 5 - subtask 1 (Cortis et al., 2017);
dataset MRN contains the news titles, urls, time
and date, a sentiment score within the five classes
[-1.0, -0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0], and, if available, a de-
scription. All news in MRN are related to at
least one microblog in dataset M. In total, MRN
contains 106 news covering 18 unique entities in
463 microblogs (defined as subset A below). For
dataset M, the sentiment scores are processed to
cluster data in three classes by transforming sen-
timent scores above 0.0 to 1.0, and scores lower
than 0.0 to -1.0. Moreover, two subsets of dataset
M were created according to the microblogs’ re-

lation to dataset MRN (see Table 1 and Figure 1).
Subset A contains microblogs which have a rela-
tion to one or multiple news; subset B contains mi-
croblogs from subset A which are retrieved from
Twitter. Subset B is necessary as dataset M con-
tains StockTwits not specifically collected in the
same period as the tweets. Figure 2 contains addi-
tional information regarding the annotation of both
dataset as well as subsets.

3.2 Assigning a News Sentiment to
Microblogs

All news in dataset MRN correspond to compa-
nies referred to in a minimum of one microblog
in dataset M. With this information, our goal is to
determine how to model the sentiment conveyance
between the news-contained sentiment and each
microblog given that news and microblogs might
contain the same entities but not be vastly related.
Considering the following example of two news
articles, one about Apple and Tim Cook’s private
life, and another one about Apple and the new
iPhone, the latter one’s sentiment should have a
higher impact on a microblog’s sentiment about
Apple’s new products since they are more related.
Using a purely entity based approach, both news
articles would be linked to the microblog and the
influence of both news on the assigned sentiment
would be equal as they deal with Apple.

This work considers the assumption that
“within a certain period, sentiments regarding the
same entity should be similar across different data
sources” (Daudert et al., 2018) and refines it with
the assumption that sentiments are particularly
similar if the textual context is similar. To lay the
foundation for future research applications and to
ensure a coherent understanding of the terminol-
ogy applied throughout this work, we define core
concepts as follows:

Linking - The linking of sentiment describes the
creation of relations between sentiments,
particularly their literal representations, by

The sentiment is represented by s.

matching pieces of text according to prede-
fined criteria such entities, text intersections,
or a degree of textual similarity. Hereby, we
assume that linked sentiments are either in-
fluenced by the same cause or affecting each
other.

Conveyance - The conveyance of sentiment de-
scribes the influence of the sentiment of one
text on the sentiment of another. Sentiment is
(indirectly) fully or partially transfered from
a piece of text A to a piece of text B.

Assigning - The assigning of sentiment models
the conveyance of sentiment from a text to
another. Given two linked sentiments and
the hypothesis that one is affecting the other,
or both are affected by the same cause, we
model the influence of text A’s sentiment on
text B’s sentiment; improvements of this as-
signment can be measured by an enhanced
sentiment detection for text B.

The aim behind this is the removal of noise in
terms of microblog-unrelated news, although deal-
ing with the same entity, as well as the reduction
of the impact of less-related news on the assigned
sentiment. To explore this, we compare four
context-based approaches with the entity-based
approach. The two context-based approaches em-
ploying a threshold for determining the relevance
of a news to a microblog’s sentiment (approach
1 and 3) aim at improving the sentiment linking
since they fully discard news below a certain simi-
larity value. The remaining two context-based ap-
proaches using a weighting scheme are reducing
the impact of less relevant news on a microblog’s
sentiment and are, hence, aiming at improving
the assigning of sentiment. This occurs in mul-
tiple steps: First, URLs in microblogs as well as
news titles and descriptions are removed. Second,
microblogs are tokenised employing the NLTK
TweetTokenizer (Bird and Loper, 2004); news ti-
tles and descriptions are tokenized using the Stan-
ford CoreNLP Tokenizer (Manning et al., 2014).

news sentiment are represented in gray (columns 4-7).

We choose different tokenizers for microblogs and
news as the TweetTokenizer is specifically made
for microblogs while news require a tokenizer
adapted to a different structure and length. Third,
we convert the Stanford GloVe Twitter model
(Pennington et al., 2014) to Word2Vec (Mikolov
et al., 2013a) and obtain the word embeddings.
Having the word embeddings for microblogs and
news in place, the subsequent processing varied
depending on the context-based approach.

3.3 Context-based Approaches

We define context-based as an approach which
utilises the textual similarity between two data ar-
tifacts as a factor to modify the sentiment of one
of these, aiming at the generation of a sentiment
to be assigned for the other artifact, necessary to
model the sentiment conveyance.

In this work, we use microblog messages and
a concatenation of the news titles and descrip-
tions, if available, as our textual information. We
then measure the textual similarity and utilise it
as a factor to modify the news sentiment and sub-
sequently generate the news sentiment to be as-
signed (NSTBA). This generated sentiment is then
applied to model the sentiment conveyance be-

tween a news and a microblog.

NSTBAm =
s(n1)+s(n2)

2 (1)

The first context-based approach generates the
NSTBA as an average of the sentiments of the
microblog-related news articles. Document em-
beddings are retrieved for each microblog and
news by averaging the word embeddings (Kart-
saklis, 2014). We employ the cosine similarity as
measure since vector offsets have been shown to
be effective (Mikolov et al., 2013b). To be con-
sidered as context-related, a cosine similarity of
at least 0.5 is required. For example, if two news
articles (n1, n2) are context-related to microblog
m, the two news sentiments (s) are added together
and then divided by 2.

NSTBAm =
s(n1)∗sim(n1,m)+s(n2)∗sim(n2,m)

2
(2)

In contrast, the second context-based approach
does not exclude relations with a cosine similarity
lower than 0.5 but it uses the similarity score as
a weighting factor multiplying it with the respec-
tive news sentiment score. Thus, an average of
the similarity-weighted sentiments of the related-
news is created. As an example, if two news arti-
cles (n1, n2) are context-related to microblog m,



112

each news sentiment s(nx) is multiplied with the
respective similarity (sim) score of nx and m and
then divided by 2. The NSTBA is then aggregated
into the classes [-1.0, 0.0, 1.0] as this enhanced the
results.

The third approach utilises the word mover’s
distance (WMD) as described in (Kusner et al.,
2015). We choose the WMD as it is a promis-
ing, recently developed function to measure the
dissimilarity between two text documents. In our
data, the WMDs d are within the range of [3.5,
9.5]. In spirit of equation 1, we use a threshold of
6.5 which is located halfway between both turn-
ing points as a requirement to be considered as
context-related. As previously, the NSTBA has
been aggregated into three classes.

The fourth approach is also based on the WMD.
Since the WMD is not a similarity score but a dis-
tance theoretically ranging from 0 to unlimited, we
transformed it into a similarity score (WMD-S).
For WMDs ranging between [3.5, 9.5] in our data,
we converted them into a similarity score within
[0, 0.955] using the following formula:

sim(d) = 1− 1−0.1(d−9.5)3+1 (3)

Initially, we also experimented with other func-
tions such as 1−d/9.5, however, function 3 repre-
sented a better approximation of a similarity score
for our data. First, word embeddings are used
to create the WMD between each microblog and
news. Then, this distance is transformed into a
similarity score using the formula above. Third
and in the spirit of equation 2, news sentiments are
weighted with the WMD-based similarity score.
However, here we also aggregated the NSTBA.

3.4 Experimental Setup
For consistency, we utilise a similar setup to Daud-
ert et al. (2018) for the preprocessing of the mi-
croblog texts, as well as for the SVM, and perfor-
mance measures. The preprocessing steps are as
follows:

1. URLs were replaced with < url >
2. Numbers were replaced with < number >
3. With WORD representing the original

hastag:

(a) hastags in upper case were replaced with
< hashtag > WORD < allcaps >

(b) the remaining cases were replaced with
< hashtag > WORD

4. Smileys and emoticons were replaced
with a description (e.g., becomes
slightly smiling face) 4

The processed text was then transformed into a un-
igram tf-idf representation.

The SVM model is trained and tested in six dis-
tinct approaches whereby approach three to six
utilise different methods to model the context-
based news sentiment: (1) a feature matrix repre-
senting the microblog messages; (2) a feature ma-
trix representing the microblog messages enriched
with the assigned entity-based news sentiment for
each microblog, and (3)-(6) a feature matrix repre-
senting the microblog messages enriched with the
assigned context-based news sentiment for each
microblog. We chose to balance the class weight
to get as close as possible to a neutral sentiment
setting; the iterations are set to 500 and the ran-
dom state to 42.

To test for statistical significance of the models,
we apply a permutation test under the null hypoth-
esis that the model has no effect in microblog sen-
timent classification (Ojala and Garriga, 2010).

4 Results

Table 2 shows the classification results on dataset
M, subset A, and subset B. Although the use
of an entity-based sentiment is already beneficial
to the results, the addition of textual similarity
measures further improves them. As the table
shows, utilising context-based approaches to in-
fluence to-microblogs-assigned news sentiments
enhances all measures in comparison to only us-
ing an entity-based average news sentiment. The
weighted F1-Score for dataset M is increased by
0.17% and the Euclidean distance is decreased by
7.04%. In comparison to only using the mes-
sage text (MT), the same scores are improved by
3.13% and 13.99%. For the subsets A and B the
weighted F1-Score increases by 1.06% and 3.07%,
and the Euclidean distance is decreased by 1.82%
and 8.25%, respectively. For subset A, in con-
trast to only using MT, the weighted F1-Score and
Euclidean distance are improved by 1.91% and
3.59%. This suggests the benefit of applying dis-
tributional semantics to the linking and assigning
of news sentiment to microblogs, shown by the
improvement on microblog sentiment classifica-

tion. Additionally, all scores improve on dataset
M although only around 18.6% of the microblogs
in the dataset are related to news. Surprisingly,
utilising WMD-S improves all measures for sub-
set B, whereas the cosine similarity between the
document embeddings, together with the applica-
tion of a threshold of 0.5, delivers the best re-
sults for dataset M and subset A. Furthermore, our
approach outperforms the best score achieved in
the SemEval 2017 Task 5 - Track 1 competition
in which microblog sentiment analysis on a con-
tinuous scale was performed. Although our fo-
cus is to show the benefit of leveraging sentiment
across news and microblogs, classifying the sen-
timent into 3 classes, our model reaches a cosine
similarity of 0.869 on dataset M (table 2, column
TS Thr.) whereas Jiang et al. (2017) reach a cosine
similarity of 0.778.

5 Conclusion and Future Work

In this work, we utilise distributional semantics to
model the conveyance of sentiment between news
and microblogs. The achieved results suggest the
benefit of using textual similarities and word em-
beddings to enhance the sentiment linking and as-
signing, culminating in an improved microblog
sentiment classification. Our contributions are
threefold: First, we present novel research util-
ising distributional semantics, specifically, word
embeddings, the cosine similarity, and the word
mover’s distance, for the linking and assigning of
news-contained sentiment to microblogs; second,
we explore the use of the word mover’s distance as
similarity measure and; third, we suggest the bene-
fit of leveraging news sentiment together with sim-
ilarity methods for microblog sentiment classifi-
cation. Comparing the additional use of an entity-
based news sentiment with only the microblog text
as features (columns MT versus ES Agg.), our re-
sults show an improvement on microblog senti-
ment classification on dataset M and subset A,
while achieving a p-value<0.01. In case of sub-
set B, which has the most related news but the
least news in quantity, the performance remains
unchanged (columns MT versus ES Agg.). How-
ever, models utilising context-based news senti-
ment for an enhanced sentiment linking and as-
signing (columns TS Thr. and WMD-S Thr. Agg.)
improve the performance for subset B and also
reach the best scores for all three datasets. This
suggests that applying distributional semantics is

particularly fruitful when entity-based news senti-
ments have less impact on the sentiment analysis
on microblogs; this can be true in three cases:

1. The overall sentiments are neutral or bal-
anced. We balanced all sentiment classes,
however, the classifiers trained on context-
based sentiment outperform the one trained
on average entity-based news sentiment.

2. Only sparse related news exist. A classifier
utilising the average entity-based sentiment
as features achieves better results for dataset
M and subset A than one with only the mes-
sage text as features, however, on the smaller
subset B this does not occur. Furthermore,
when context-based sentiment is used as fea-
ture, the improvement on subset B becomes
the largest. This suggests that each mislead-
ing news sentiment, present on dataset M and
subset A, would have a noticeable impact on
the results.

3. Related news are noisy and contain, apart
from matching entities, unrelated informa-
tion. Nonetheless, training our classifier on
context-based sentiment outperforms the one
trained on the average entity-based senti-
ment, suggesting that more-related news have
a higher influence.

As future work, we aim to create a larger
dataset, referring to a single defined period, link-
ing microblogs and news. In addition, hybrid
models taking into account not only a threshold
for discarding noise but also a weighting scheme
could potentially improve the classification. In
this paper, we utilise the word mover’s distance
and the cosine similarity to measure the similar-
ity between two texts, however, other potentially
adequate methods for this task still require explo-
ration.
