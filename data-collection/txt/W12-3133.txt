Abstract
This paper describes the UPC participation in
the WMT 12 evaluation campaign. All sys-
tems presented are based on standard phrase-
based Moses systems. Variations adopted sev-
eral improvement techniques such as mor-
phology simplification and generation and do-
main adaptation. The morphology simpli-
fication overcomes the data sparsity prob-
lem when translating into morphologically-
rich languages such as Spanish by translat-
ing first to a morphology-simplified language
and secondly leave the morphology gener-
ation to an independent classification task.
The domain adaptation approach improves the
SMT system by adding new translation units
learned from MT-output and reference align-
ment. Results depict an improvement on TER,
METEOR, NIST and BLEU scores compared
to our baseline system, obtaining on the of-
ficial test set more benefits from the domain
adaptation approach than from the morpho-
logical generalization method.

1 Introduction
TALP-UPC (Center of Speech and Language
Applications and Technology at the Universitat
Politècnica de Catalunya) has participated in the
WMT12 shared task translating across two direc-
tions: English to Spanish and Spanish to English
tasks.

For the Spanish to English task we submitted a
baseline system that uses all parallel training data
and a combination of different target language mod-
els (LM) and Part-Of-Speech (POS) language mod-
els. A similar configuration was submitted for the

English to Spanish task as baseline. Our main ap-
proaches enriched the latter baseline in two indepen-
dent ways: morphology simplification and domain
adaptation by deriving new units into the phrase-
table. Furthermore, additional specific strategies
have been addressed on all systems to deal with well
known linguistic phenomena in Spanish such as cli-
tics and contractions.

The paper is presented as follows. Section 2
presents the main rationale for the phrase-based sys-
tem and the main pipeline of our baseline system.
Section 3 presents the approaches taken to improve
the baseline system on the English to Spanish task.
Section 4 presents the obtained results on internal
and official test sets while conclusions and further
work are presented in Section 5.

2 Baseline system: Phrase-Based SMT

Classically, a phrase-based translation system im-
plements a log-linear model in which a foreign lan-
guage sentence f j1 = f1, f2, . . . , fj is translated into
another language sentence eI1 = e1, e2, . . . , eI by
searching for the translation hypothesis that max-
imizes a log-linear combination of feature models
(Brown et al., 1990):

êI1 = arg max

ture functions we used the standard models available

Figure 1: Factored phrase-based MT based on trans-
lation from surface to surface and Part-of-Speech

on Moses, i.e., relative frequencies, lexical weights,
word and phrase penalty, wbe-msd-bidirectional-fe
reordering models and two language models, one for
surface and one for POS tags. Phrase scoring was
computed using Good-Turing discounting (Foster et
al., 2006).

The tuning process was done using MERT (Och,
2003) with Minimum Bayes-Risk decoding (MBR)
(Kumar and Bryne, 2004) on Moses and focusing on
minimizing the BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002)
of the development set. Final translations were also
computed using MBR decoding.

Additionally to the settings mentioned before, we
worked with a factored version of the corpus. Fac-
tored corpora augments surface forms with addi-
tional information, such as POS tags or lemmas as
shown in Figure 1. In that case, factors other than
surface (e.g. POS) are usually less sparse, allowing
to build factor-specific language models with higher-
order n-grams. These higher-order language models
usually help to obtain more syntactically correct out-
put. Concretely we map input source surfaces to tar-
get surfaces and POS tags.

2.1 Corpus used

The baseline system was trained using all paral-
lel corpora, i.e. the European Parliament (EPPS)
(Koehn, 2005), News Commentary and United Na-
tions. Table 1 shows the statistics of the training data
after the cleaning process described later on Subsec-
tion 2.2.

Regarding the monolingual data, there was also
more News corpora separated by years for Spanish
and English and there was the Gigaword monolin-
gual corpus for English. All data can be found on
the Translation Task’s website1. We used all News
corpora (and Gigaword for English) to build the lan-

For internal testing we used the News 2011’s data
and concatenated the remaining three years of News
data as a single parallel corpus for development. Ta-
ble 3 shows the statistics for these two sets and in-
cludes in the last rows the statistics of the official test
set for this year’s translation task.

2.2 Corpus processing
All corpora were processed in order to remove or
normalize ambiguous or special characters such as
quotes and spaces. Among other TALP-UPC spe-
cific scripts, we used a modified version of the
normalized-punctuation script provided by the orga-
nizers in order to skip the reordering rules which in-
volved quotes and stop punctuation signs.

POS-Tagging and tokenization for both Spanish
and English data sets were obtained using FreeLing
(Padró et al., 2010). Freeling tokenization is able
to deal with contractions (“del”! “de el”) and cli-
tics separation (“cómpramelo” ! “compra me lo”)
in Spanish and English. Stemming was performed
using Snowball (Porter, 2001).

Surface text was lowercased conditionally based
on the POS tagging: proper nouns and adjectives
were separated from other POS categories to deter-
mine if a string should be fully lowercased (no spe-
cial property), partially lowercased (proper noun or
adjective) or not lowercased at all (acronym).

Bilingual corpora were cleaned with clean-
corpus-n script of Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) re-
moving all sentence pair with more than 70 words
in any language, considering the already tokenized
data. That script also ensures a maximum length
ratio below of nine (9) words between source and
target sentences.

Postprocessing in both languages consisted of a
recasing step using Moses recaser script. Further-
more we built an additional script in order to check
the casing of output names with respect to source
sentence names and case them accordingly, with ex-
ception of names placed at beginning of the sen-
tence. After recasing, a final detokenization step
was performed using standard Moses tools. Span-
ish postprocessing also included two special scripts
to recover contractions and clitics.

2.3 Language Model and alignment
configuration

Word alignment was performed at stem level with
GIZA++ toolkit (Och and Ney, 2003) and grow-
diag-final-and joint alignment.

Language models were built from the monolin-

gual data provided covering different domains: Eu-
roparl, News and UN. We built them using Kneser-
Ney algorithm (Chen and Goodman, 1999), inter-
polation in order to avoid over-fitting and consider-
ing unknown words. First we built a 5-gram lan-
guage model for each corpus; then, the final LM
was obtained interpolating them all towards the de-
velopment set. We used SRI Language Model (Stol-
cke, 2002) toolkit, which provides compute-best-mix
script for the interpolation.

The POS language model was built analogously
to the surface language with some variants: it was a
7-gram LM, without discounting nor interpolation.

3 Improvement strategies

3.1 Motivations
In order to improve the baseline system we present
two different strategies. First we present an im-
provement strategy based on morphology simplifi-
cation plus generation to deal with the problems
raised by morphological rich languages such as
Spanish. Second we present a domain adaptation
strategy that consists in deriving new units into the
phrase-table.

3.2 Morphology simplification
The first improvement strategy is based on morphol-
ogy simplification when translating from English to
Spanish.

The problems raised when translating from a lan-
guage such as English into richer morphology lan-
guages are well known and are a research line of
interest nowadays (Popovic and Ney, 2004; Koehn
and Hoang, 2007; de Gispert and Mariño, 2008;
Toutanova et al., 2008; Clifton and Sarkar, 2011). In
that direction, inflection causes a very large target-
language lexicon with a significant data sparsity
problem. In addition, system output is limited only
to the inflected phrases available in the parallel train-
ing corpus. Hence, SMT systems cannot gener-
ate proper inflections unless they have learned them
from the appropriate phrases. That would require to
have a parallel corpus containing all possible word
inflections for all phrases available, which it is an
unfeasible task.

The morphology related problems in MT have
been addressed from different approaches and may

be summarized in four categories: i) factored mod-
els (Koehn and Hoang, 2007), enriched input mod-
els (Avramidis and Koehn, 2008; Ueffing and Ney,
2003), segmented translation (Virpioja et al., 2007)
and morphology generation (Toutanova et al., 2008;
de Gispert and Mariño, 2008).

Our strategy for dealing with morphology gener-
ation is based in the latter approach (de Gispert and
Mariño, 2008) (Figure 2). We center our strategy in
simplifying only verb forms as previous studies in-
dicate that they contribute to the main improvement
(Ueffing and Ney, 2003; de Gispert and Mariño,
2008). That strategy makes clear the real impact
of morphology simplification by providing an upper
bound oracle for the studied scenarios.

The approach is as follows: First, target verbs
are simplified substituting them with their sim-
plified forms (Table 4). In this example, the
verb form ‘puede’ (he can) is transformed into
‘VMIPpn0[poder]’, indicating simplified POS and
base form (lemma); where ‘p’ and ‘n’ represent any

person and number once simplified (from 3rd per-
son singular). Secondly, standard MT models are
obtained from English into simplified morphology
Spanish. Morphology prediction acts as a black box,
with its models estimated over a simplified morphol-
ogy parallel texts (including target language model
and lexicon models).

Generation is implemented by Decision Directed
Acyclic Graphs (DDAG) (Platt et al., 2000) com-
pound of binary SVM classifiers. In detail, a DDAG
combines many two-class classifiers to a multi-
classification task (Hernández et al., 2010).

3.3 Domain adaptation
Depending on the available resources, different do-
main adaptation techniques are possible. Usually,
the baseline system is built with a large out-of-
domain corpus (in our case the European Parlia-
ment) and we aim to adapt to another domain that
has limited data, either only monolingual or hope-
fully bilingual as well. The WMT Translation Task
focuses on adapting the system to a news domain,
offering an in-domain parallel corpus to work with.

In case of additional target monolingual data, pre-
vious works have focused on language model inter-
polations (Bulyko et al., 2007; Mohit et al., 2009;
Wu et al., 2008). When parallel in-domain data
is available, the latest researches have focused on
mixture model adaptation of the translation model
(Civera and Juan, 2007; Foster and Kuhn, 2007; Fos-
ter et al., 2010). Our work is closer to the latest ap-

278



proaches. We used the in-domain parallel data to
adapt the translation model, but focusing on the de-
coding errors that the out-of-domain baseline system
made while translating the in-domain corpus. The
idea is to detect where the system made its mistakes
and use the in-domain data to teach it how to correct
them.

Our approach began with a baseline system built
with the Parliament and the United Nations parallel
corpora but without the News parallel corpus. The
rest of the configuration remained the same for the
baseline. With this alternative baseline system, we
translated the source side of the News parallel cor-
pus to obtain a revised corpus of it, as defined in
(Henrı́quez Q. et al., 2011). The revised corpus con-
sists of the source side, the output translation and the
target side, also called the target correction. The out-
put translation and its reference are then compare to
detect possible mistakes that the system caused dur-
ing decoding.

The translation was used as a pivot to find a word-
to-word alignment between the source side and the
target correction. The word-to-word alignment be-
tween source side and translation was provided by
Moses during decoding. The word-to-word align-
ment between the output translation and target cor-
rection was obtained following these steps:

1. Translation Edit Rate (Snover et al., 2006) be-
tween each output translation and target correc-
tion sentence pair was computed to obtain its
edit path and detect which words do not change
between sentences. Words that did not change
were directly linked

2. Going from left to right, for each unaligned
word w

out

on the output translation sentence
and each word w

trg

on the target correction
sentence, a similarity function was computed
between them and w

out

got aligned with the
word w

trg

that maximized this similarity.

The similarity function was defined as a linear
combination of features that considered if the words
w

out

and w
trg

were identical, if the previous or fol-
lowing word of any of them were aligned with each
other and a lexical weight between them using the
bilingual lexical features from the baseline as refer-
ences.

With both word-to-word alignments computed for
a sentence pair, we linked source word w

src

with tar-
get word w

trg

is and only if exists a output transla-
tion word w

out

such that there is a link between w
src

and w
out

and a link between w
out

and w
trg

.
After aligning the corpus, we built the transla-

tion and reordering model of it, using the baseline
settings. We called these translation and reorder-
ing models, revised models. They include phrases
found in the baseline that were correctly chosen dur-
ing decoding and also new phrases that came from
the differences between the output translation and its
correction.

Finally, the revised translation model features
were linearly combined with their corresponding
baseline features to build the final translation model,
called the derived translation model. The combina-
tion was computed in the following way:

hi
d

(s, t) = ↵hi
b

(s, t) + (1� ↵)hi
r

(s, t) (2)

where hi
d

(s, t) is the derived feature function i for
the bilingual phrase (s, t), hi

b

(s, t) is the baseline
feature function of and hi

r

(s, t) the revised feature
function. A value of ↵ = 0.60 was chosen after de-
termining it was the one that maximized the BLEU
score of the development set during tuning. Differ-
ent values for ↵ were considered, between 0.50 and
0.95 with increments of 0.05 between them.

Regarding the reordering model, we added the un-
seen phrases from the revised reordering model into
the baseline reordering model, leaving the remaining
baseline phrase reordering weights intact.

tion strategy may help decreasing the language mod-
els perplexity.

In table 6 we can see the effects of simplification.
Perplexity is computed from the corresponding in-
ternal test sets to the baseline or simplified language
models.

In general terms, the simplification process is
slightly effective, yielding an averaged improvement
of �5.02%.

4.2 Translation performance
Evaluations were performed with different transla-
tion quality measures: BLEU, NIST, TER and ME-
TEOR (Denkowski and Lavie, 2011) which evalu-
ate distinct aspects of the quality of the translations.
First we evaluated the WMT11 test (test11) as an
internal indicator of our systems. Later we did the
same analysis with the WMT12 official test files.

Table 5 presents the obtained results. Experi-
ments began building the baseline system, which
included the special treatment for clitics, contrac-
tions and casing as described in Section 2.2. Once
the baseline was set, we proceeded with two paral-
lel lines, one for morphology simplification and the
other for domain adaptation.

For morphology generation approach (Table 5)

oracles (Morph. Oracle) represent how much gain
we could expect with a perfect generation module
and generation (Morph. Gen.) represent the actual
performance combining simplification and the gen-
eration strategies. Oracles achieve a promising av-
eraged improvement of +1.79% (depending on the
metric or the test set) with respect to the baseline.
However, generation only improves the baseline by
a +0.61%, encouraging us to keep working on that
strategy.

Regarding the domain adaptation approach, we
evaluated the internal test set (test11). As we can
see again on Table 5a the adaptation strategy outper-
forms the baseline on all quality measures starting
with an averaged gain of +0.94%.

Comparing the two approaches, we can see that
the domain adaptation method was better in terms of
BLEU score and TER than the morphology genera-
tion but the latter was better on NIST and METEOR
on our internal test set. This made us decided for the
latter as the primary system submitted, leaving the
domain adaptation approach system as a contrastive
submission. Additionally to the automatic quality
measures, we are particularly interested in the man-
ual evaluation results, as we believe the morphology
generation will be more sensitive to this type of eval-

280



uation than to automatic metrics.
Official results (test12) can be found on Table 5b.

Surprisingly, this time the domain adaptation ap-
proach performed better than the morphology sim-
plification on all metrics: BLEU, NIST, TER and
METEOR, with an averaged gain of +1.04% over
the baseline system, which ranks our submissions
second and third in terms of BLEU scores (con-
trastive and primary respectively) when compared
with all other submissions for the WMT12 transla-
tion task.

5 Conclusions and further work

This papers describes the UPC participation during
the 2012 WMT’s Translation Task. We have partici-
pated with a baseline system for Spanish-to-English,
a baseline system for English-to-Spanish and two in-
dependent enhancements to the baseline system for
English-to-Spanish as well.

Our primary submission applied morphology sim-
plification and generation with the objective of ease
the translation process when dealing with rich mor-
phology languages like Spanish, deferring the mor-
phology generation as an external post-process clas-
sification task.

The second approach focused on domain adapta-
tion. Instead of concatenating the training News par-
allel data together with the European Parliament and
United Nations, a preliminary system was built with
the latter two and separated translation and reorder-
ing models were computed using the News parallel
data. These models were then added to the prelimi-
nary models in order to build the adapted system.

Results showed that both approaches performed
better than the baseline system, being the domain
adaptation configuration the one that performed bet-
ter for 2012 test in terms of all automatic quality
indicators: BLEU, NIST, TER and METEOR. We
look forward the the manual evaluation results as we
believe our primary system may be more sensitive to
this type of human evaluation.

Future work should focus on combining the two
approaches, applying first morphological general-
ization to the training data and then using the domain
adaptation technique on the resulting corpora in or-
der to determine the joined benefits of both strate-
gies.
