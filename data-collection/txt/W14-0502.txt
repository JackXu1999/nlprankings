Abstract 

The paper presents a system for tran-

scribing and annotating phonological in-

formation in Brazilian Portuguese, in-

cluding syllabification. An application of 

this system for the assessment of lan-

guage understanding and production is 

described, following a child longitudi-

nally, comparing expected production 

with observed production. 

1 Introduction 

We present an application of a phonological-

prosodic algorithm which converts Brazilian Por-

tuguese graphemes to phonological symbols. For 

a better understanding, a brief report about the 

origin of the algorithm, altogether with some 

theoretical comments are presented, before the 

case study of the phonological processes found 

in the speech samples of a child. Sessions were 

recorded, until the complete acquisition of all 

Portuguese phonemes by the child, which oc-

curred in the fifth session.  

In 2008, we created the first version of a pho-

nological-prosodic algorithm for Brazilian Por-

tuguese. Actually, it is the functional algorithm 

of the grapheme to phoneme converter Nhenhém 

(Vasilévski, 2008, 2012a, 2012b). It has all writ-

ten Portuguese spelling rules, and also the entire 

Portuguese prosodic system. When that algo-

rithm was built, we kept in mind its usefulness to 

different fields deeply related to phonology, such 

as speech therapy, allowing the study of children 

phonological disorders, and language acquisition. 

We focus here on its application to language 

acquisition, allowing the study of children pho-

nological acquisition processes. Hence, our ob-

jective is to show the phonological-prosodic al-

gorithm usefulness to language survey, from a 

practical point of view, by showing the process 

involved in the last stages of the acquisition of 

Portuguese phonology.  

For a better understanding of the application 

and of the case study, the paper starts with some 

theory on phonological acquisition, then, some 

aspects of Brazilian Portuguese acquisition are 

presented.  

2 Phonological Development 

Studies of first language acquisition tend to sup-

port the view that the ability for language is in-

nate in healthy human beings, and that its ap-

pearance can be predicted as part of the normal 

development of any child, given the right envi-

ronment (Beaken, 1971).  

The greatest expansion of the phonological 

system is observed from 1 year and six months 

old up to 4 years old, when there is an increase of 

the phonetic inventory of most complex syllable 

structures and, therefore, a period characterized 

by the occurrence of omissions, substitutions, as 

well as other phonological processes (Wertzner, 

2004). 

A phonological process is a mental operation 

that applies in speech to substitute, for a class of 

sounds or sound sequences presenting a specific 

common difficulty to the speech capacity of the 

individual, an alternative class identical but lack-

ing the difficult property (Stampe, 1973). 

It is worth remembering that, at the richest 

stage of normal language development (1 year 

and a half to 4 years old, as said), inappropriate 

sound gestures are expected phonological proc-

esses that relate to children’s adaptations, until 

they automate the adult speech patterns. Thus, 

the phonological processes – that are natural and 

inborn – guide the facilitation of complex vocal 

3



gestures and their planning, until children reach 

the adult performance. 

Moreover, the early-acquired competence is 

filtered through an increasing number of phono-

logical transformations to produce, finally, a ma-

ture performance. Although the mature phonemic 

system is acquired at an early stage, articulation 

may not be completely mature until after 7 years. 

Even though most children can be said to have 

mastered the complete set of potential phonemic 

oppositions of adult language by the age of 4 

years – in other words, their phonological com-

petence is established – yet, in adult terms, their 

performance falls short of their competence, in 

that they are unable to produce many of the ges-

tures of mature articulation of the phonemes. 

Development after this stage takes place in the 

maturing of articulation, and in the acquisition of 

the complex transformations which operate on 

the basic acquired competence, to produce forms 

of speech similar to those heard from mature 

speakers (Beaken, 1971). 

2.1 Some Aspects of Brazilian Portuguese 
Phonological Acquisition 

Regarding phonemes, Brazilian Portuguese has 

21 consonants (/p/, /b/, /f/, /v/, /m/, /n/, /t/, /d/, /s/, 

/z/, /l/, /λ/, /r/, /ʀ/, /ʃ/, /ʒ/, /ɲ/, /k/, /g/, and the ar-

chiphonemes |R|, |S|), and 14 vowels (/a/, /e/, /ɛ/, 

/i/, /o/, /ɔ/, /u/, /j/, /w/, /ã/, /ẽ/, /ĩ/, /õ/, /ũ/) (Scliar-

Cabral, 2003a; Câmara Jr., 1986, 1977; Va-

silévski, 2012a).  

Lateral liquid phonemes /l/ and /λ/ and non-

lateral liquid /r/ and /ʀ/ are the latest to be ac-

quired in Brazilian Portuguese. Furthermore, 

such acquisition is marked by intense use of di-

versified phonological processes. What perhaps 

justifies this late acquisition, in Brazilian Portu-

guese as well as in other systems, is that this 

class is very complex, both in articulation and 

phonological aspects (Lamprecht, 2004).  

Within this group of sounds, lateral phonemes 

are acquired before the non-lateral ones. The first 

lateral phoneme to be stabilized by children is /l/, 

which is subdued before the emergence of the 

first non-lateral liquid phoneme /ʀ/. This occurs 

with the phonemes /λ/ – graphically lh – and /r/, 

being the first acquired before the second (Her-

nandorena and Lamprecht, 1997). In Portuguese, 

the phoneme /r/ occurs: 1) forming a syllable 

with an oral or nasal vowel (simple onset); 2) in 

second position of inseparable consonant clus-

ters, preceding oral or nasal vowel (complex on-

set); and 3) in syllable ending (coda, when it is 

the archiphoneme |R|). See Tab.1 for examples. 

In most cases, the acquisition of the phoneme 

/r/ happens initially in the position of simple on-

set (by 4 years old) and then in the position of 

complex onset (by 5 years old), the acquisition of 

the phoneme /r/ in coda position (that is, |R|) oc-

curs by 4 years old (Lamprecht, 2004) either.  

Another linguistic phenomenon to be taken 

into account is diphthongization. It happens 

when one vowel breaks into two segments, 

where the first one matches the original vowel 

and the second (/j/ or /w/) is harmonic with the 

nature of the triggering vowel. In Brazilian Por-

tuguese, one of the conditions when diphthongi-

zation occurs, and that matters here, is thus de-

fined: a stressed vowel, followed by a devoiced 

alveolar fricative [s], in the ending syllable of a 

word, becomes diphthongized by the addition of 

a second segment, an [i] (Cagliari, 2002). Since 

diphthongization is a strengthening process, it 

occurs preferentially with strong vowels, and, in 

Romance languages, /a/ is the strongest vowel, 

and /i/, the weakest (Foley, 1977). The semivow-

els of stressed syllables can be either produced or 

not in speech, both options belonging to Portu-

guese language system (Vasilévski, 2012a). 

From the linguistic point of view, diphthongiza-

tion is strongly related to the geographical dia-

lectal variation (Leiria, 2000).  

3 A Program for Helping Language 
Acquisition Research 

By using Nhenhém phonological-prosodic algo-

rithm, we built Nhenhém Fonoaud – NhFonoaud 

–, an application for assisting speech therapy, 

and so language acquisition. We began covering 

just one phonological process, called “unvoiced-

ness”: a substitution of a voiced sound for an 

unvoiced one (e.g. /b/ → /p/) (Blasi and Va-

silévski, 2011). Soon, we realized that the phono-

logical-prosodic algorithm could cover much 

more. 

 One of the motivations for creating such a 

system is that many Brazilian language acquisi-

tion researchers record their collected data using 

orthographic representation. As a result, those 

transcriptions are idiosyncratic and cannot be 

properly generalized, since they lack patterns. 

Data must be recorded in a phonologic-phonetic 

format, essential for these studies, since they ad-

dress phonological processes.  

According to researchers and speech thera-

pists, there is no similar work in Brazilian Portu-

guese. Probably, there are similar initiatives for 

4



other languages, and we expect to make com-

parisons soon.  

3.1 The decoder Nhenhém Phonological-
prosodic Algorithm 

Nhenhém (/ɲẽ.ˈɲẽϳ/) is a computational program 

that decodes Brazilian’s official writing system 

into phonological symbols and marks prosody 

(Vasilévski, 2008, 2012a). In 2010, we aug-

mented its main algorithm, so the system became 

able of providing the phonological syllabic divi-

sion and the spelling syllabic division, with at 

least 99% of accuracy (see Vasilévski, 2012a, 

2012b for more details). Then we developed an 

automatic syllable parsing (Vasilévski, 2010).  

In 2012, we made some adjustments regarding 

morphology, and solved the unpredictable situa-

tions brought, for example, by the prefix “trans-” 

that can be either decoded as /trãz/ or /trãs/, in 

consequence of resyllabification (see Vasilévski, 

2012a). NhFonoaud benefits of all improvements 

obtained by the basic algorithm.  

3.2 Nhenhém Fonoaud 

The application of Nhenhém phonological-

prosodic algorithm to language acquisition and 

speech therapy has been presented (Blasi and 

Vasilévski, 2011, Vasilévski, 2012a, 2012b), but 

this is the first time that a case study is discussed.  

The first major challenge of working with 

phonemic transcription is the consistency of data. 

Different research questions require different 

levels of representation (Albert et al., 2013). In 

this regard, relying on an orthographic represen-

tation of speech, when dealing with language 

acquisition, does not make sense. 

The program supports the analysis of proc-

esses that occur in the child’s phonological sys-

tem, through the automatic phonological tran-

scription simultaneously to samples of the child 

speech recording. Thus, data relies on a phone-

mic representation of speech, automatically done 

by the algorithm, through Nhenhém Fonoaud.  

NhFonoaud is designed for dealing with pho-

nological tests, using words wittingly grouped to 

analyze specific aspects of speech and phenom-
ena involved in its development. One of the tools 

of the program was the tests battery called Re-

ception and Production of Spoken Language As-

sessment (Scliar-Cabral, 2003b). These tests 

were elaborated for assessing overt symptoms of 

spoken language reception and production prob-

lems. The first step is assessing phonetic features 

perception, namely, the ability of distinguishing 

minimal pairs, what means distinguishing Brazil-

ian Portuguese words.  

The battery is composed by 81 pictures that 

represent specific words in Portuguese. The pic-

tures are grouped into cards of six elements each. 

There are 15 cards, and some pictures appear in 

more than one. Each card is assembled to address 

the perception and production of one specific 

phonetic feature: 1) /v/-/f/, /p/-/b/, /t/-/d/; 2) /k/-

/g/, /ʃ/-/ʒ/, /s/-/z/; 3) /m/-/n/, /t/-/d/, /s/-/f/; 4) /b/-

/g/, /f/-/r/, /k/-/p/; 5) /t/-/k/, |R|-/s/, /l/-/λ/; 6) /t/-

/s/, /k/-|R|, /p/-/f/; 7) /d/-/t/, /t/-/r/, /d/-/s/; 8) /m/-

/b/, /n/-/r/, /z/-/n/; 9) /ɲ/-/λ/, /d/-/n/, /n/-/l/; 10) /r/-

/l/ (in three different contexts); 11) /ɛ/-/ɔ/, /i/-/u/, 

/e/-/o/; 12) /i/-/e/, /ĩ/-/ẽ/, /u/-/o/; 13) /e(j)/-/ɛ/, /o/-

/ɔ/, /ɔ/-/o(w)/; 14) /ɔ/-/a/, /m/-/b/ (in two different 

contexts)/; 15) /ẽ/-/e/, /o/-/õ/, /a/-/ã/.  

In the reception battery, the speech therapist, 

behind the child, says the word and the child 

must point to one of the six pictures in each card. 

In the production battery, the speech therapist 

points to one of the six pictures in each card and 

the child must label it. 

While the child labels the picture, the re-

searcher can edit the canonical transcription pro-

vided by the program to match the child’s pro-

duction. For example, writing the lateral pho-

neme, when the child produces it, instead of the 

vibrating one.  

In principle, four situations may happen dur-

ing the assessment (Fig.1): the child does not 

recognize the  picture  (NR); the  child  gives  the

expected response (Correspondeu); the child 

gives an unexpected response (deviation – Des-

vio); the child translates the word into his/her 

sociolinguistic variety (not deviation – Sócio).  

NhFonoaud stores the records and compares 

them with the transcription expected, for generat-

ing reports. Hence, it is possible to build a cor-

pus, to retrieve it, grouping it according to date, 

situation, child’s age, type of card (test); then it 

is possible the conversion into numbers, using 

different formats, comparing the phonological 

transcription and the correspondent audio, and 

the recorded sessions. Therefore, it facilitates 

child’s progress monitoring. 

In spite of working with words, NhFonoaud 

can be adjusted to work with bigger texts, 

formed by many sentences. For the purpose of 

assessing the child phonemic system, using min-

imal pairs and small sentences is enough. 

3.3 Testing Nhenhém Fonoaud  

The data analysis that we now present refers to a 

child in a clear process of language acquisition. 

It is based on oral emissions of a girl that we will 

call Inês. The 15 cards (Scliar-Cabral, 2003b) 

were applied, covering all the Brazilian Portu-

guese phonemes. Five sessions were recorded, 

starting when Inês was 2 years, 11 months, and 8 

days; until she was 3 years, 8 months and 29 

days.  

Inês was born in Curitiba, Brazil, of Brazilian 

parents. She was not considered to have signifi-

cant hearing loss. The child had developed some 

computer skills. Data was collected by her par-

ents, by showing her the cards at the computer, 

during a daily conversation. Inês had already 

contact with the pictures, and had learned some 

names that were not part of her daily life. The 

sessions were recorded by using the audio re-

sources of the same computer, and the records 

were clear enough to be used in this study.  

3.3.1 Testing results 

The results reveal the phonological processes 

used by Inês. Four were observed in her emis-

sions: two of substitution, one of deletion, and 

one of adding. From the reports generated by 

Nhenhém Fonoaud, we created Tab 1. 

So, at the age of 2y11m8d, three phonological 

processes relate to a single phoneme of her 

mother tongue, the non-lateral, vibrating /r/, and 

another one to diphthongization. Thus, Inês is 

only unable to produce the most complex Portu-

guese phoneme, in anyone of the three cases in 

which it occurs. The first session reveals that the 

child is able to produce all the vowels (14) of her 

mother tongue and 20 consonantal phonemes 

among the 21 of Brazilian Portuguese. No 

changes are observed for about 4 months, but 

this is expected, since progress in language is

never regular; it may proceed at a fast rate for 

some periods while at others very little seems to 

be happening (Beaken, 1971). Then, the sound /r/ 

is emerging, only in simple onset, and she pro-

duces the cluster, but says /tl/ instead of /tr/ 

(3y6m25d). One month later (3y7m24d), she 

starts producing /r/ in coda position and the clus-

ter /tr/, with some difficult yet. The sound /r/ in 

simple onset is naturally produced. One more 

month (3y8m29d), and she is able to naturally 

produce /r/ in all the contexts it happens in Por-

tuguese, and keeps diphthongization.  

Regarding diphthongization, it happens when 

the child inserts the semivowel /j/ between a 

vowel and the coda |S|, creating a diphthong. 

This circumstance advises that the child is ad-

justing her speech according to adult speech, 

since the region where Inês lives is where this 

phonological phenomenon occurs most, consid-

ering the South of Brazil (Leiria, 2000). It is a 

trait of the child’s sociolinguistic variety, de-

pendent upon geographic factor, and so she 

keeps saying it. 

Hence, this research found that Inês completed 

the acquisition of the phonemes of her native 

language at 3 years and 8 months approximately, 

in normal development. 

4 Conclusion and Outlooks 

We briefly presented a system for dealing with 

phonological information in Brazilian Portu-

guese, and a case study from it, that is, the lon-

gitudinal speech recording of a child – the girl 

called Inês. Data allowed to know the last 

processes involved in the acquisition of the 

phonemes of her mother tongue.   
From the preliminary results obtained, it is 

possible to conclude that Nhenhém Fonoaud can 

be helpful to language acquisition research. Nev-

ertheless, the usefulness of the phonological pro-

sodic algorithm has to be proven, by testing it in 

different situations, such as deviant language 

acquisition, speech therapy, and also other re-

searches. This will be our next step.
