Abstract

We present our work on sentiment predic-
tion using the benchmark MOSI dataset
from the CMU-MultimodalDataSDK. Pre-
vious work on multimodal sentiment anal-
ysis have been focused on input-level fea-
ture fusion or decision-level fusion for
multimodal fusion. Here, we propose an
intermediate-level feature fusion, which
merges weights from each modality (au-
dio, video, and text) during training with
subsequent additional training. Moreover,
we tested principle component analysis
(PCA) for feature selection. We found that
applying PCA increases unimodal per-
formance, and multimodal fusion outper-
forms unimodal models. Our experiments
show that our proposed intermediate-level
feature fusion outperforms other fusion
techniques, and it achieves the best per-
formance with an overall binary accu-
racy of 74.0% on video+text modalities.
Our work also improves feature selection
for unimodal sentiment analysis, while
proposing a novel and effective multi-
modal fusion architecture for this task.

1 Introduction

Sentiment analysis is the study on the underly-
ing attitude that one holds towards a certain en-
tity. For a long time, text-based sentiment anal-
ysis has been the staple in this area and only re-
cently are other modalities being considered for
sentiment analysis such as vision and speech (Po-
ria et al., 2015). For text channels, the features
usually include information about word sequences
and meaning (Mikolov et al., 2013). However,
combining information from multiple modalities
can bring additional information to ambiguous

cases. For example, a smile extracted from facial
features could help disambiguate cases such us
“This movie is sick”. Text alone would have trou-
ble interpreting the meaning of the word “sick” in
this context. This motivates the research of multi-
modal sentiment analysis. We seek to exploit the
inter-dependencies between audio, text, and visual
modalities in order to label video segments that ex-
hibit positive or negative sentiment.

In current studies in this field, visual features
often involve salient points of the face or body
(Zadeh et al., 2016a), while low-level descrip-
tors are collected from the speech signal such as
pitch and volume (Zeng et al., 2009). The com-
bination of features which have originated from
text, speech and audio is what forms the basis of
our multimodal classification work. Features from
each modality are modeled, learned, and eventu-
ally fused together at various levels in a classifica-
tion Deep Neural Network (DNN) system. When
the modalities are fused together, this is called
multimodal fusion. DNN multimodal fusion for
binary sentiment classification is an active area
of research that continues to gain momentum and
spark interest due to the challenging nature of the
problem (e.g., Poria et al. (2018)). We explore the
interplay between three modalities: text, video,
and audio. We focus on three fusion techniques
inspired by previous work on multimodal fusion
(Poria et al., 2018; Zadeh et al., 2016b).

We developed and compared three multimodal
fusion architectures: (1) Input-level features fu-
sion, (2) Intermediate features fusion, and (3)
Decision-level fusion (late fusion). The first
method refers to fusing information at the level
of input features, similar to an unweighted con-
catenation of feature vectors, and it is the most
widely used. The second method evokes the no-
tion that each modality can be learned using a uni-
modal DNN. The weights learned through train-



65

ing each unimodal DNN are concatenated together
and training continues before the decision level.
The third method, also known as ensemble fusion
or late fusion, fuses multiple modalities at the de-
cision level. We present our multimodal DNN fu-
sion approaches in detail in our methodology de-
scription in Section 3. where we further analyze
the interactions between modalities. We experi-
mented with combinations of modalities as well
as system architectures that attempt to capture the
interplay between modalities.

2 Related Work

Sentiment analysis has traditionally been a task for
natural language processing and based explicitly
on text data, such as online blog posts (Feng et al.,
2011). Beyond the scope of text-based sentiment
analysis, Chen et al. (1998) provides us with an
early work on audio-visual emotion recognition
and showed that bimodal classifiers can perform
better than unimodal ones alone.

Even though there is a significant amount of re-
search done on audio-visual emotion recognition,
only a few previous efforts have systematically ex-
plored trimodal fusion by combining text data with
audio and visual modalities. Morency et al. (2011)
was one of the first to investigate sentiment analy-
sis on video movie reviews. They analyzed a col-
lection of 47 videos depicting monologues in ad-
dition to the corresponding text that they manually
transcribed from each 30-seconds excerpt. They
evaluated sentiment for each review as a 3-way
classification problem: positive, negative or neu-
tral and achieved an F1 measure of 55.3%, which
is much better than chance.

Furthermore, Wöllmer et al. (2013) attempted
the same type of multimodal sentiment task
for movie reviews using a linear Support Vec-
tor Machines (SVM) for the linguistic features
and a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory
(BLSTM) for the audiovisual ones. Our work con-
tinues this direction of combining data from dif-
ferent modalities and we also used video movie
reviews. However, these related studies used very
small collections of videos, whereas our work uses
more than 2,000 videos.

Poria et al. (2015) provided a novel use of deep
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). They
extracted features from the text modality and then
adopted multiple kernel learning (MKL) for clas-
sifying the multimodal fused feature vectors. Most

previous work has verified that multimodal classi-
fiers perform better than unimodal ones.

More recently, Poria et al. (2018) presented
three fusion techniques for multimodal senti-
ment analysis which achieved high accuracy:
concatenation-based fusion, context-aware fusion
and context-aware fusion with attention. One ma-
jor issue of early fusion is that input-level fea-
ture concatenation will increase the feature space,
which can be potentially problematic for very
large datasets. To account for this, we experi-
mented with principle components analysis (PCA)
as a dimensionality reduction technique.

Existing top-performing systems on the CMU-
MultimodalDataSDK MOSI (Zadeh et al., 2018)
dataset are listed in Table 1, measured by clas-
sification accuracy. The state-of-the-art is Zadeh
et al. (2017) which used tenor-based multimodal
fusion. The C-MKL system of Poria et al. (2015),
as discussed earlier, used a novel approach with
CNNs. We also include a non-DNN system from
Zadeh et al. (2016b) because it used input-level
feature fusion, similar to one of our approaches
in this work. Note that each of these systems
has used slightly different feature selection tech-
niques, which have introduced some inconsisten-
cies between systems making a direct comparison
difficult. Thus, we cannot make a direct system-
to-system comparison between our methods and
previous work.Additional work has been carried
out on unimodal and multimodal sentiment analy-
sis, using datasets different from CMU MOSI (Po-
ria et al., 2016; Ma et al., 2018).

Here we provide the technical specifications of the
DNN architectures and parameters that we used in
this work, followed by details about our three fu-
sion techniques. We then discuss PCA dimension-
ality reduction, which we used in our experiments

as a form of feature selection.

3.1 Data and Task Description
We conducted our experiments on the Multimodal
Opinion level Sentiment Intensity (MOSI) dataset
from CMU-MultimodalDataSDK (Zadeh et al.,
2018).1 The MOSI dataset is a collection of 2199
opinion video clips, each annotated with sentiment
scores in the range [-3,3]: strongly positive (+3),
positive (+2), weakly positive (+1), neutral (0),
weakly negative (-1), negative (-2), strongly neg-
ative (-3). The multimodal observations consist
of transcribed speech and features extracted from
the visual and audio data. This benchmark dataset
provided pre-extracted features on three modali-
ties, a speaker-independent data partition of train
(1283 items), validation (229 items), and test (686
items) sets, and an alignment of text, acoustic and
visual data.

A detailed description of the dataset features
and the sentiment class labels can be found in
Zadeh et al. (2018). We aligned the features to
the text embeddings as a reference and we max-
normalized the feature values on a per-modality
basis, as this allows for a meaningful compari-
son across systems. Due to the different number
of timesteps in each utterance, we were required
to restrict each sentence to a fixed size length by
padding or cropping the sentences, using a maxi-
mum length. We treated this maximum length as a
hyper-parameter and is described in more detail.

Primarily, our prediction task is binary classifi-
cation for sentiment: positive versus negative. An
exemplar with score s > 0 belongs to the positive
class, while scores of s < 0 belong to the negative
class. We transformed all scores to True/False val-
ues, where True corresponds to the positive class.
For performance metrics, we used overall accu-
racy on the held-out test set.

After we identified the best-performing over-
all trimodal fusion system, we conducted addi-
tional experiments to report 5-class accuracy with
F1 measure, as well as regression where we re-
port mean-absolute error (MAE). These additional
metrics allow further comparison of our best sys-
tem to existing systems for this dataset.

3.2 Unimodal classifiers
We describe three types of DNNs that we used
in our experiments for sentiment prediction and

1https://github.com/A2Zadeh/CMU-
MultimodalDataSDK

some of the reasoning behind these selections.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have

been applied to various text-based sentiment and
emotion detection tasks in natural language pro-
cessing (Kim, 2014). Moreover, CNNs were used
in OpenFace (Baltrušaitis et al., 2016), an open-
source face recognition tool which was employed
by MOSI. While there are limited studies that in-
volve using CNNs to predict sentiment directly
from speech, we note that others have success-
fully tested its efficacy by working directly on the
speech spectrogram (Niu et al., 2017).

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs) are pop-
ular with sequence prediction tasks, because they
can capture context from previous steps. LSTMs
also achieved moderate success for video emotion
detection Chen et al. (2017). We expect LSTMs to
be useful in our sentiment prediction task due to
the sequential nature of the video data.

Bidirectional LSTMs (BLSTMs) increase the
amount of available contextual information by in-
cluding both a forward pass and a backward pass
through a sequence. There is growing interest in
applying BLSTMs for emotion detection from vi-
sual and audio features (Ullah et al., 2018).

3.3 Training Hyper-parameters

The activation function we used across all of our
experiments was ReLu (Nair and Hinton, 2010).
The learning rule was Adam (Kingma and Ba,
2014) with standard parameters. For 1D convo-
lution layers, the kernel size was 3. For max
pooling layers, the window size was 2. We var-
ied the number of convolutional layers in [1, 2, 3].
For LSTMs and Bi-directional LSTMs, we set the
number of units to [64] and the number of layers
in [1, 2, 3]. For fully connected layers, we set the
number of units to 100 and explored the number
of layers in [1, 2, 3]. We added dropout (Srivas-
tava et al., 2014) between fully connected layers
with dropout rate in [0.1, 0.2]. In all experiments,
we used early stopping with the stopping crite-
ria set to identify maximum validation accuracy
and patience was set to 10. We varied the maxi-
mum length setting for the video segments in our
dataset, known as maxlen, in [15, 20, 25, 30]. The
experiments employed batch normalization with
batch size set to b = 64 (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015).
Since it is a binary classification task, we use a
single output unit with sigmoid activation. The
loss function we use is binary cross-entropy. We



67

present test set results measuring overall accuracy.

3.4 Input-Level Feature Fusion

Input-level feature fusion (early fusion) refers to
simply concatenating features from all the modal-
ities, after they have been aligned and transformed
to fixed size length. The concatenation is per-
formed on the time step dimension. After input
concatenation, the process follows a standard deep
learning pipeline and we can apply different deep
learning structures on top of the concatenated fea-
tures. In this work, we tested CNNs, LSTMs and
BLSTMs. We explored using one fully connected
hidden layer and one output layer for the final
prediction. In each case, we optimize the hyper-
parameters of the DNN as described earlier.

We experimented with dimensionality reduction
on a per-modality basis, prior to feature concate-
nation. This is motivated by our observation that
many of the visual and audio features were zero
valued. Thus, we attempt to identify the most im-
portant features using PCA. Our system architec-
ture for input-level fusion with and without dimen-
sionality reduction is displayed in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Input-level feature fusion architecture
with and without PCA.

3.5 Intermediate-Level Feature Fusion

In intermediate-level feature fusion, data from
each modality is first input to the best perform-
ing unimodal networks (for video and audio we
use CNN, for text we use BLSTMs) which learn
intermediate features. The intermediate weights
from these unimodal networks are then concate-
nated and we then add fully connected layers to
continue training the concatenated features. The
goal is to capture interactions between modalities.
We experimented with and without PCA on the
input-level features. We show the architecture of
the intermediate-level fusion system in Figure 2.

tecture. PCA for dimensionality reduction is not
shown in this diagram.

PCA for dimensionality reduction is not shown in
this diagram.

3.6 Decision-Level Feature Fusion

Decision-level feature fusion (late fusion) applies
a separate classifier to weight the decisions of uni-
modal DNNs. The idea is that combining the uni-
modal results may improve model robustness. The
most straightforward way of doing decision-level
fusion is to train separate classifiers and weight
their outputs with a tuple: w = (λ1, λ2, λ3).
These weights can either be learned by another
classifier, or set experimentally. No concatena-
tion is performed in decision-level fusion. Com-
pared to intermediate level fusion, which used sub-
networks to extract intermediate features, here we
output the decision of each modality.

Commonly, an SVM or another classifier is
used on top of the decisions of each unimodal
classifier. Our approach is different from exist-
ing literature in that we train 3 separate unimodal
sub-networks such that our final system contains
3 component networks. For an illustration, refer
to Figure 3. The top layer of this network is sim-
ply an output layer that receives the output of each
modality sub-network (so the input is a one dimen-
sional vector of size 3) and assigns a weight for



68

each. This architecture acts as an ensemble of the
3 separate modality classifiers. Although it is not
the case for our experiments, it would be possible
to pre-train each modality on a different dataset, if
more data is available (Wu et al., 1999).

3.7 Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

We applied PCA as a way to select the most valu-
able features, and reduce the dimensionality of the
feature space, and ultimately to increase the uni-
modal performance. Our goal in using PCA was
to find the most effective and least redundant com-
ponents to the unimodal representation of the data
since features are semantically different after they
are max-normalized (Zadeh et al., 2017).

PCA is an important linear transformation tech-
nique for dimensionality reduction. PCA yields
the ordered feature vectors, commonly referred
to as principal components, which maximize the
variance of the data by removing redundant fea-
tures (Abdi and Williams, 2010). As a data reduc-
tion technique, PCA is commonly used for han-
dling high-dimensional visual information in vari-
ous research areas, such as medical images (Bhat
et al., 2017), and has been proved to be an effective
method for feature selection and extraction.

We used the Python Sklearn PCA decomposi-
tion function (Pedregosa et al., 2011) on our train-
ing set. We computed the proportion of variance
explained by the number of principal components
utilized using a scree plot.2 We then inferred a
range of k-components that might be responsible
for a high enough cumulative variance and swept
this range of k-component values (shown in Ta-
ble 2). We applied the PCA fit that we learned
from training data and used it as the PCA trans-
form on our validation and test data. We continued
with the unimodal classifier training according to
the fusion architectures and hyper-parameters de-
scribed earlier. We then examined binary test ac-
curacy on each DNN architecture to determine the
best value for k in PCA. The top-performing sys-
tem is highlighted in bold.

ment classification problem. After experimenting
with the fusion techniques, we identify the best
overall performing systems and further report the

relation.

4.1 Input-Level Feature Fusion

We explored input feature fusion with and with-
out PCA. When we ran early fusion with PCA,
we used the k-PCA components value described
in Table 2. Our experiment results for early fu-
sion are displayed in Table 3. The top-performing
systems for each modality combination are high-
lighted in bold.

69

The gains from PCA for input-level fusion
are particularly small, which is counter-intuitive
considering that early fusion concatenation in-
creases the dimensionality of the data. The best-
performing overall system was a BLSTM using
bimodal text and video data at 72.4% binary ac-
curacy without PCA. The CNN tends to perform
less well across all bimodal/trimodal combina-
tions, and this suggests that emotion prediction
has a sequential aspect. That sequential aspect is
picked up by the other DNNs that we tested.

4.2 Intermediate-Level Feature Fusion

The intermediate features fusion model we pro-
posed adds dense layers on top of the intermedi-
ate weights extracted from each modality. There
are other possible configurations to be explored,
but we experimented with the simplest one. Com-
pared to early fusion, the features for each modal-
ity are first fed to a different network. We have
chosen the best performing network for each sin-
gle modality as described in Table 2 (CNN for au-
dio and video, and BLSTM for text) for the pre-
fusion stages.

Table 4: Bimodal/trimodal binary accuracy for
intermediate feature fusion. Parameters refer to
DNN layers, dropout rate, segment length.

When we applied PCA for intermediate-level
fusion, we applied it either to all modalities or
none. This configuration makes it possible to
make a direct comparison with our other ap-
proaches. Results are summarized in Table 4. We
achieve our highest performance so far which was
the bimodal fusion of video and text with binary
accuracy of 74.0%. We note that this accuracy was
achieved with and without PCA, suggesting either
that our proposed system is robust to noise or that
video and text data was not particularly noisy.

4.3 Decision-Level Fusion

For our decision-level fusion (late fusion) exper-
iments, we kept the pre-fusion network consis-
tent with intermediate fusion (CNN for audio and

video, BLSTM for text). Experiment results are
in Table 5. Our best result is for the trimodal
inputs. We find that the results are not much
different from a carefully trained text only pre-
dictor. Since the video and audio classifiers are
much worse predictors than text. This indicates
that a decision level classifier is not the best ap-
proach for the MOSI dataset. We noticed that the
top-performing decision-level systems used less
segment length context than our previous experi-
ments, even though the performance is compara-
ble. This could be due to the fact that the com-
bination of modalities creates a form of informa-
tion enhancement, so that less context is needed to
make a prediction.

4.4 Detailed Top Performing Systems
To make a comparison to performance reported
in previous work, we provide more specific per-
formance metrics in Table 6, based on the top-
performing systems from each of the 3 fusion
methods that we have discussed. For each top sys-
tem, we report the binary accuracy and F1 score,
the 5-class accuracy, and the regression MAE and
Pearson r correlation (values closer to r = 1 in-
dicate positive correlation, while values closer to
r = −1 indicate negative correlation).

All of our best-performing systems used bi-
modal (text+video) feature fusion instead of tri-
modal. Across all systems, we can general-
ize that leaving out the audio modality improved
performance. Our top input-level fusion system
(Early) was bimodal BLSTM without PCA. Our
top intermediate-level fusion system (Inter.), was
bimodal fusion regardless of PCA. Finally, our
best decision-level system (Late) was bimodal
without PCA.

nary sentiment prediction on this dataset. Further,
we were able to identify text as the single best-
performing and audio as the worst-performing
modality predictor. Although PCA improved uni-
modal performance, it did not have an effect on
the intermediate and decision fusions. This could
be due to inherent noise in the audio data from the
CMU-MultimodalDataSDK, which our feature se-
lection procedure did not remedy.

We present example negative and positive sen-
tences in Table 7 and the scores given by our best
performing classifier. A score above 0.5 classifies
the sentences as positive. This outlines the diffi-
culty of the task and shows that some sentences
are difficult to label even for humans.

6 Conclusions and Future Work

Despite our efforts to reduce feature redundancy
during early fusion, we found an apparent ceiling
in terms of the best binary accuracy, as it never
reached above 74.0%. Our experiments showed
that PCA improves test accuracy in the case of
unimodal models and sometimes the early fusion
model. Interestingly, in our bimodal and trimodal
experiments, we found that leaving out audio and

focusing on video+text features, always yields a
slight improvement. This is consistent with the
state of the art on the MOSI dataset (Zadeh et al.,
2017) which found that audio is the weakest of all
three modalities for this dataset. It would be in-
teresting to disentangle whether or not this consti-
tutes bias in the data or bias in human communi-
cation or perception of emotions.

As the goal of our study was to explore mul-
timodal fusion techniques, we explored 3 differ-
ent fusion architectures that all yield better re-
sults that unimodal classifiers. This indicates that
there are interactions to be learned during the fu-
sion process. We showed that both late decision-
level fusion and early fusion can achieve compa-
rable results. As a task for future work, we en-
courage exploring the best intervention point for
intermediate-level fusion. For example, to vary
the number of fully-connected layers on individual
DNNs before concatenation. Similarly, it should
be investigated how to weigh the DNNs before
concatenation as we know that text is often the best
unimodal predictor of sentiment.

In terms of combining the CNN architecture
with PCA, CNNs will basically learn common
structural components across the input features,
which can be viewed as a redundancy that is re-
moved by PCA. Therefore this combination would
only useful to the extent that it helps with remov-
ing actual noise from the data. Similarly, this com-
bination of CNN+PCA on audio-only data, which
consists primarily of MFCC’s, also creates a type
of redundancy. Given that there could be better
models than PCA, we encourage future work to
systematically explore and compare techniques for
both feature selection and noise reduction on the
CMU MOSI dataset.

In the future, we plan to examine which of the
low-level acoustic descriptors, facial features, and
words are the most effective for sentiment analy-
sis. This would help future studies to learn bet-
ter feature representations for sentiment analysis.
Further, we selected our top-performing models
based on binary classification accuracy, without
a category for “neutral”. It could be the case
that some of our data exemplars were a better fit
for this third category, or that audio features are
predictive of a neutral category, something that
should be investigated in future work.

The MOSI dataset breaks down each movie re-
view into sentences to be classified individually,



71

losing context that might be gained by looking
at the other neighboring sentences. Motivated by
Poria et al. (2017) who suggested contextual sen-
timent analysis, we plan on including additional
contextual information when predicting the senti-
ment of a sentence. Instead of considering each
utterance as a separate entity, we will add contex-
tual information from neighboring sentences be-
longing to the same monologue and study the gain.
