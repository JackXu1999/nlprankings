Abstract
Dialogue contexts are proven helpful in the
spoken language understanding (SLU) system
and they are typically encoded with explicit
memory representations. However, most of
the previous models learn the context mem-
ory with only one objective to maximizing the
SLU performance, leaving the context mem-
ory under-exploited. In this paper, we pro-
pose a new dialogue logistic inference (DLI)
task to consolidate the context memory jointly
with SLU in the multi-task framework. DLI
is defined as sorting a shuffled dialogue ses-
sion into its original logical order and shares
the same memory encoder and retrieval mech-
anism as the SLU model. Our experimental
results show that various popular contextual
SLU models can benefit from our approach,
and improvements are quite impressive, espe-
cially in slot filling.

1 Introduction

Spoken language understanding (SLU) is a key
technique in today’s conversational systems such
as Apple Siri, Amazon Alexa, and Microsoft Cor-
tana. A typical pipeline of SLU includes domain
classification, intent detection, and slot filling(Tur
and De Mori, 2011), to parse user utterances into
semantic frames. Example semantic frames (Chen
et al., 2018) are shown in Figure 1 for a restaurant
reservation.

Traditionally, domain classification and intent
detection are treated as classification tasks with
popular classifiers such as support vector machine
and deep neural network (Haffner et al., 2003;
Sarikaya et al., 2011). They can also be com-
bined into one task if there are not many intents
of each domain(Bai et al., 2018). Slot filling
task is usually treated as a sequence labeling task.
Popular approaches for slot filling include con-
ditional random fields (CRF) and recurrent neu-
ral network (RNN) (Raymond and Riccardi, 2007;

Yao et al., 2014). Considering that pipeline ap-
proaches usually suffer from error propagation,
the joint model for slot filling and intent detec-
tion has been proposed to improve sentence-level
semantics via mutual enhancement between two
tasks (Xu and Sarikaya, 2013; Hakkani-Tür et al.,
2016; Zhang and Wang, 2016; Goo et al., 2018),
which is a direction we follow. To create a more
effective SLU system, the contextual information
has been shown useful (Bhargava et al., 2013;
Xu and Sarikaya, 2014), as natural language ut-
terances are often ambiguous. For example, the
number 6 of utterance u2 in Figure 1 may re-
fer to either B-time or B-people without consid-
ering the context. Popular contextual SLU models
(Chen et al., 2016; Bapna et al., 2017) exploit the
dialogue history with the memory network (We-
ston et al., 2014), which covers all three main
stages of memory process: encoding (write), stor-
age (save) and retrieval (read) (Baddeley, 1976).
With such a memory mechanism, SLU model can
retrieve context knowledge to reduce the ambi-
guity of the current utterance, contributing to a
stronger SLU model. However, the memory con-
solidation, a well-recognized operation for main-
taining and updating memory in cognitive psy-

chology (Sternberg and Sternberg, 2016), is un-
derestimated in previous models. They update
memory with only one objective to maximizing
the SLU performance, leaving the context mem-
ory under-exploited.

In this paper, we propose a multi-task learn-
ing approach for multi-turn SLU by consolidat-
ing context memory with an additional task: di-
alogue logistic inference (DLI), defined as sorting
a shuffled dialogue session into its original logical
order. DLI can be trained with contextual SLU
jointly if utterances are sorted one by one: se-
lecting the right utterance from remaining candi-
dates based on previously sorted context. In other
words, given a response and its context, the DLI
task requires our model to infer whether the re-
sponse is the right one that matches the dialogue
context, similar to the next sentence prediction
task (Logeswaran and Lee, 2018). We conduct
our experiments on the public multi-turn dialogue
dataset KVRET (Eric and Manning, 2017), with
two popular memory based contextual SLU mod-
els. According to our experimental results, no-
ticeable improvements are observed, especially on
slot filling.

2 Model Architecture

This section first explains the memory mechanism
for contextual SLU, including memory encoding
and memory retrieval. Then we introduce the SLU
tagger with context knowledge, the definition of
DLI and how to optimize the SLU and DLI jointly.
The overall model architecture is illustrated in Fig-
ure 2.

Memory Encoding
To represent and store dialogue history
{x1, x2, ...xk}, we first encode them into

memory embedding M = {m1,m2, ...mk} with
a BiGRU (Chung et al., 2014) layer and then
encode the current utterance xk+1 into sentence
embedding c with another BiGRU:

mi = BiGRUm(xi) c = BiGRUc(xk+1) (1)

Memory Retrieval

Memory retrieval refers to formulating contextual
knowledge of the user’s current utterance xk+1 by
recalling dialogue history. There are two popular
memory retrieval methods:

The attention based (Chen et al., 2016) method
first calculates the attention distribution of c over
memories M by taking the inner product followed
by a softmax function. Then the context can be
represented with a weighted sum over M by the
attention distribution:

pi = softmax(cTmi) mws =
∑
i

pimi (2)

where pi is the attention weight of mi. In Chen
et al., they sum mws with utterance embedding c,
then multiplied with a weight matrix Wo to gener-
ate an output knowledge encoding vector h:

h =Wo(c+mws) (3)

The sequential encoder based (Bapna et al.,
2017) method shows another way to calculate h:

gi = sigmoid(FF([c ;mi])) (4)

h = BiGRUg([g1, g2, ..., gk]) (5)

where the function FF() is a fully connected for-
ward layer.

Contextual SLU
Following Bapna et al., our SLU model is a
stacked BiRNN: a BiGRU layer followed by a
BiLSTM layer. However, Bapna et al. only ini-
tializes the BiLSTM layer’s hidden state with h,
resulting in the low participation of context knowl-
edge. In this work, we feed h to the second layer
in every time step:

O1 = BiGRU1(xk+1) (6)

O2 = BiLSTM2([O1;h]) (7)

where O1 = {o11, ..., om1 } is the first layer’s output
and m is the length of xk+1. The second layer
encodes {[o11 ;h], ..., [om1 ;h]} into the final state
s2 = [

−→s2 ;←−s2 ] and outputs O2 = {o12, ..., om2 },
which can be used in the following intent detec-
tion layer and slot tagger layer respectively.

P i = softmax(Us2) P st = softmax(V o
t
2) (8)

where U and V are weight matrices of output lay-
ers and t is the index of each word in utterance
xk+1.

Dialogue Logistic Inference
As described above, the memory mechanism holds
the key to contextual SLU. However, context
memory learned only with SLU objective is under-
exploited. Thus, we design a dialogue logistic in-
ference (DLI) task that can consolidate the context
memory by sharing encoding and retrieval compo-
nents with SLU. DLI is introduced below:

Given a dialogue session X = {x1, x2, ...xn},
where xi is the ith sentence in this conversation,
we can shuffle X into a random order set X ′. It
is not hard for human to restore X ′ to X by deter-
mining which is the first sentence then the second
and so on. This is the basic idea of DLI: choos-
ing the right response given a context and all can-
didates. For each integer j in range k + 1 to n,
training data of DLI can be labelled automatically
by:

P (xj |x1, ..., xk) =
{

1 j = k + 1
0 j 6= k + 1 (9)

where k+1 is the index of the current utterance. In
this work, we calculate the above probability with
a 2-dimension softmax layer:

P (xj |x1, ..., xk) = softmax(Wdh) (10)

where Wd is a weight matrix for dimension trans-
formation.

erage turns per conversation.

Joint Optimization

As we depict in Figure 2, we train DLI and SLU
jointly in order to benefit the memory encoder and
memory retrieval components. Loss functions of
SLU and DLI are as follows.

LSLU = log(p(yI |x1, ..., xk+1))

+
∑
t

log(p(ySt |x1, ..., xk+1))
(11)

LDLI =
∑
xj

log(p(yD|xj , x1, ..., xk)) (12)

where xj is a candidate of the current response,
yI , ySt and y

D are training targets of intent, slot
and DLI respectively. Finally, the overall multi-
task loss function is formulated as

L = (1− λ)LSLU + λLDLI (13)

where λ is a hyper parameter.

3 Experiments

In this section, we first introduce datasets we used,
then present our experimental setup and results on
these datasets.

3.1 Datasets

KVRET (Eric and Manning, 2017) is a multi-turn
task-oriented dialogue dataset for an in-car assis-
tant. This dataset was collected with the Wizard-
of-Oz scheme (Wen et al., 2017) and consists of
3,031 multi-turn dialogues in three distinct do-
mains, and each domain has only one intent, in-
cluding calendar scheduling, weather information
retrieval, and point-of-interest navigation.

However, all dialogue sessions of KVRET are
single domain. Following Bapna et al., we further
construct a multi-domain dataset KVRET* by ran-
domly selecting two dialogue sessions with differ-
ent domain from KVRET and recombining them
into one conversation. The recombining probabil-
ity is set to 50%. Detailed information about these
two datasets is shown in Table 1.

3.2 Experimental Setup

We conduct extensive experiments on intent detec-
tion and slot filling with datasets described above.
The domain classification is skipped because in-
tents and domains are the same for KVRET.

For training model, our training batch size is 64,
and we train all models with Adam optimizer with
default parameters (Kingma and Ba, 2014). For
each model, we conduct training up to 30 epochs
with five epochs’ early stop on validation loss. The
word embedding size is 100, and the hidden size
of all RNN layer is 64. The λ is set to be 0.3. The
dropout rate is set to be 0.3 to avoid over-fitting.

3.3 Results

The following methods are investigated and their
results are shown in Table 2:

NoMem: A single-turn SLU model without
memory mechanism.

MemNet: The model described in Chen et al. ,

with attention based memory retrieval.
SDEN: The model described in Bapna et al. ,

with sequential encoder based memory retrieval.
SDEN†: Similar with SDEN, but the usage of h

is modified with Eq.6.
As we can see from Table 2, all contextual

SLU models with memory mechanism can bene-
fit from our dialogue logistic dependent multi-task
framework, especially on the slot filling task. We
also note that the improvement on intent detection
is trivial, as single turn information has already
trained satisfying intent classifiers according to re-
sults of NoMem in Table 2. Thus, we mainly ana-
lyze DLI’s impact on slot filling task and the prime
metric is the F1 score.

In Table 2, the poorest contextual model is
the SDEN, as its usage of the vector h is too
weak: simply initializes the BiLSTM tagger’s hid-
den state with h, while other models concatenate
h with BiLSTM’s input during each time step.
The more the contextual model is dependent on



5452

h, the more obvious the improvement of the DLI
task is. Comparing the performance of MemNet
with SDEN† on these two datasets, we can find
that our SDEN† is stronger than MemNet after the
dialogue length increased. Finally, we can see
that improvements on KVRET* are higher than
KVRET. This is because retrieving context knowl-
edge from long-distance memory is challenging
and our proposed DLI can help to consolidate the
context memory and improve memory retrieval
ability significantly in such a situation.

We further analyze the training process of
SDEN† on KVRET* to figure out what happens
to our model with DLI training, which is shown in
Figure 3(a). We can see that the validation loss of
SDEN† + DLI falls quickly and its slot F1 score
is relatively higher than the model without DLI
training, indicating the potential of our proposed
method.

To present the influence of hyper-parameter λ,
we show SLU results with λ ranging from 0.1 to
0.9 in Figure 3(b). In this figure, we find that the
improvements of our proposed method are rela-
tively steady when λ is less than 0.8, and 0.3 is the
best one. When λ is higher than 0.8, our model
tends to pay much attention to the DLI task, over-
look detail information within sentences, leading
the SLU model to perform better on the intent de-
tection but failing in slot filling.

4 Conclusions

In this work, we propose a novel dialogue logis-
tic inference task for contextual SLU, with which
memory encoding and retrieval components can
be consolidated and further enhances the SLU
model through multi-task learning. This DLI task
needs no extra labeled data and consumes no ex-
tra inference time. Experiments on two datasets
show that various contextual SLU model can ben-
efit from our proposed method and improvements
are quite impressive, especially on the slot fill-
ing task. Also, DLI is robust to different loss
weight during multi-task training. In future work,
we would like to explore more memory consolida-
tion approaches for SLU and other memory related
tasks.
