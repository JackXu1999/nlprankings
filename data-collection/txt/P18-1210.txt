Abstract

Theories of discourse coherence posit rela-
tions between discourse segments as a key
feature of coherent text. Our prior work
suggests that multiple discourse relations
can be simultaneously operative between
two segments for reasons not predicted by
the literature. Here we test how this joint
presence can lead participants to endorse
seemingly divergent conjunctions (e.g., but
and so) to express the link they see between
two segments. These apparent divergences
are not symptomatic of participant naïveté
or bias, but arise reliably from the concur-
rent availability of multiple relations be-
tween segments – some available through
explicit signals and some via inference. We
believe that these new results can both in-
form future progress in theoretical work
on discourse coherence and lead to higher
levels of performance in discourse parsing.

1 Introduction

A question that remains unresolved in work on
discourse coherence is the nature and number of re-
lations that can hold between clauses in a coherent
text (Halliday and Hasan, 1976; Stede, 2012).

Our earlier work (Rohde et al., 2015, 2016)
showed that, in the presence of explicit discourse
adverbials, people also infer additional discourse
relations that they take to hold jointly with those
associated with the adverbials. For example, in:

(1) It’s too far to walk. Instead let’s take the bus.

people infer a RESULT relation in the context of
the adverbial instead, which itself signals that the
bus stands in a SUBSTITUTION relation to walking.
We showed this using crowdsourced conjunction-
insertion experiments (Rohde et al., 2015, 2016), in
which participants were asked to insert into the gap
between two discourse segments, a conjunction that

best expressed how they took the segments to be re-
lated. Rohde et al. (2017) also asked participants to
select any other conjunctions that they took to con-
vey the same sense as their “best” choice. (More
details of these experiments are given in Section 3.)

All three studies showed participants selecting
conjunctions whose sense differed from that of the
explicit discourse adverbial. But Rohde et al. (2015,
2016) also showed participants often selecting con-
junctions that signal different coherence relations
than those selected by other participants. And Ro-
hde et al. (2017) showed participants often identi-
fying very different conjunctions as conveying the
same meaning. For example, in passage (2), with
the discourse adverbial in other words, one large
fraction of participants chose to insert OR, while
another large fraction inserted SO. Since the two
are neither synonymous nor representative of the
same relation, either the participants have come up
with different analyses of the passages (Section 2)
or something more surprising is at work.

(2) Unfortunately, nearly 75,000 acres of tropical forest
are converted or deforested every day ______ in other
words an area the size of Central Park disappears every
16 minutes. [SO∼OR]

Rohde et al. (2017) noted other cases where dif-
ferent pairs of conjunctions (e.g., BECAUSE and
BUT, BUT and OR, and BECAUSE and OR) ap-
pear systematically across participants and across
passages for particular adverbials, and speculated
on what these odd pairings may reveal, but did
not provide any empirical evidence for why this
happens. Here we present such evidence from an
experiment on three discourse adverbials (in other
words, otherwise, and instead).

After describing related work on multiple dis-
course relations (Section 2) and then our experi-
mental methodology (Section 3), we step through
results for these three adverbials. As a final piece
of evidence, we manipulate the presence and ab-
sence of a fourth adverbial, after all, in order to



2258

demonstrate that inference of the relation(s) be-
tween segments in a passage is not always driven
by the presence of such an adverbial.

2 Related Work

This is not the first work on discourse coherence to
acknowledge the possibility of multiple relations
holding between given discourse segments.

For example, the developers of Rhetorical Struc-
ture Theory acknowledged that even experienced
RST analysts may interpret a text differently in
terms of the relations they take to hold (Mann and
Thompson, 1988, p. 265). But while RST allows
for multiple alternative analyses of a text in terms
of discourse relations, in practice, researchers work-
ing in the RST framework standardly produce a
single analysis of a text, with a single relational
labeling, selecting the analysis that is “most plau-
sible in terms of the perceived goals of the writer”
(Mann et al., 1989, pp. 34–35). If that single an-
alysis is later mapped into a different structure to
support further processing – e.g., a binary branch-
ing tree structure – the mapping does not change
the chosen relational labeling.

Multiple relations may additionally hold in theo-
ries of discourse coherence that posit multiple lev-
els of text analysis. For example, following Grosz
and Sidner (1986), Moore and Pollack (1992) char-
acterized text as having both an informational struc-
ture (relating information conveyed by discourse
segments) and an intentional structure (relating the
functions of those segments with respect to what
the speaker is trying to accomplish through the
text). The kinds of relations at the two levels are
different, as can be seen in the following example
from (Moore and Pollack, 1992, p. 540):

(3) a. George Bush supports big business.
b. He’s sure to veto House Bill 1711.

At the level of intentions, (3a) aims to provide EVI-
DENCE for the claim in (3b), while at an informa-
tional level, (3a) serves as the CAUSE of the situa-
tion in (3b). RST would force annotators to choose
only the analysis that best reflected the perceived
goals of the writer.

Additionally, multiple relations can hold where
there are distinct explicit signals for distinct dis-
course relations holding between a pair of segments
(Cuenca and Marin, 2009; Fraser, 2013), as in:

(4) It’s too far to walk. So instead let’s take the bus.

where the conjunction so signals a RESULT relation
and the adverbial instead signals that taking the bus
stands in an SUBSTITUTION relation to walking.

Finally, a fourth way in which the previous lit-
erature has taken multiple discourse relations to
hold is when a single phrase or lexico-syntactic
construction jointly signals multiple discourse re-
lations as holding over a text – for example, since
as a subordinating conjunction may, in particular
contexts, signal both a TEMPORAL relation and a
CAUSAL relation, rather than just one or the other
(Miltsakaki et al., 2005).

We are aware of only two resources that allow
more than one discourse relation to be annotated
between two segments – the Penn Discourse Tree-
Bank (PDTB; Prasad et al., 2008, 2014) and, more
recently, the BECauSE Corpus 2.0 (Dunietz et al.,
2017). The PDTB allows multiple discourse re-
lations of the third and fourth types noted above.
It also allows them to be annotated if there is no
explicit connective between a pair of segments but
annotators see more than one sense relation as link-
ing them, as in the following variant of (4):

(5) It’s too far to walk. Let’s take the bus.

Here a RESULT relation can be associated with an
implicit token of so between the clauses, while a
SUBSTITUTION relation can be associated with an
implicit token of instead. The above are the main
cases in which PDTB annotates multiple relations.
Relevant to this paper, the PDTB does not anno-
tate implicit conjunction relations where there is
already an explicit discourse adverbial. Thus the
PDTB would either ignore the implicit RESULT re-
lation for (1) or (incorrectly) annotate instead in (1)
as conveying both SUBSTITUTION and RESULT.

Moreover, while the PDTB has been used
in training many (but not all) discourse parsers
(Marcu, 2000; Lin et al., 2014; Feng and Hirst,
2012; Xue et al., 2015, 2016; Ji and Eisenstein,
2014), discourse parsing has for the most part ig-
nored its annotations of multiple concurrent rela-
tions between clauses, except in the case of distinct
explicit connectives expressing distinct relations.
Instead, they have arbitrarily taken just a single re-
lation to hold, even though the relations are simply
recorded in an a priori canonical order. This prac-
tice is problematic because, for example, there may
well be a difference in the properties of segments
where two relations are jointly seen to hold, ver-
sus those segments in which only one or the other
holds. This can result in unwanted noise in the data
and lower the reliability of whatever is induced.

While our previous studies showed another
source of multiple discourse relations holding con-



2259

currently between discourse segments, the work
reported here explains how, in the context of mul-
tiple relations, participants can take very different
conjunctions to be conveying the same relation, and
what can change participants’ selection of a con-
junction to mark the relation they infer alongside
that conveyed by an explicit discourse adverbial.

3 Methodology

A locally crowdsourced conjunction-insertion task
provided a proxy for labelling relations between
adjacent discourse segments within a passage.

Our materials consisted of passages containing
an explicit discourse adverbial, preceded by a gap,
which effectively separated the passage into two
segments. The passages consisted of 16 with in
other words, 16 with instead, 16 with after all, and
48 with otherwise. Participants were asked to read
each passage and choose the conjunction(s) that
best expressed how the two segments link together.
The presentation of conjunction choices varied in
order for each participant, but always consisted of
AND, BECAUSE, BUT, OR, SO, NONE. While
the task admittedly encourages participants to se-
lect one (or more) conjunctions, our prior work
has shown that participants are very willing to use
NONE if no conjunction is appropriate. We there-
fore take their insertion of a conjunction as their en-
dorsement of the relation signaled by that conjunc-
tion. To further control data quality, we included
6 catch trials with an expected correct conjunction
like “To be ______ not to be”.

Three of the explicit discourse adverbials that
we chose are anaphoric: in other words, other-
wise, and instead (Webber et al., 2000). Unlike
conjunctions such as AND, BECAUSE, BUT, OR
and SO, they are not constrained by structure as
to what they establish discourse relations with. So
a conjunction-insertion task can be used to assess
links between the segments (see also Scholman and
Demberg 2017). Our three anaphoric adverbials
share a core meaning of ‘otherness’ via their lexical
semantics and flexibility in the relations they can
participate in, making them a fruitful set to com-
pare. The fourth adverbial, after all, allows us to
test a hypothesis that the inferred connection be-
tween clauses is not driven by the adverbial alone.

These particular adverbials were selected be-
cause they had yielded unexpected combinations
of conjunction insertions in our prior work (e.g.,
OR/SO with in other words). This is in con-

trast to adverbials like therefore and neverthe-
less, for which participants’ conjunction combi-
nations could be attributed to variation in the speci-
ficity of the conjunctions (SO/AND for therefore,
BUT/AND for nevertheless). For our selection of
a set of conjunctions to use as proxies for relation
labels, we included all the coordinating conjunc-
tions in English, as well as the subordinating con-
junction BECAUSE as EXPLANATION relations are
frequent.

All participants (N=28) were monolingual na-
tive English speakers who were selected following
a pre-test to measure their ability to consistently
insert conjunctions that captured the underlying co-
herence relations in a series of passages. All gave
informed consent. They each received £50 for their
time. Each participant saw one of two randomly
ordered lists. Passages were presented in batches
of 34, one batch per day for three days.

The materials were simplified variants of natu-
rally occurring passages. Some were also manipu-
lated systematically, in ways aimed at altering the
availability of different coherence relations. Pas-
sages are available via the “dataset” link on the
paper in the ACL anthology, and predictions about
them are laid out in Sections 4.1–4.4.

4.1 In other words Dataset

Rohde et al. (2016) report an OR∼SO response
split for in other words when participants could in-
sert only their top choice of conjunction. Figure 1
shows SO dominating participants’ choice in all
cases, but OR showing up among their choices in
all but one passage (leftmost vertical bar). Addi-
tionally, several passages elicited BUT as the top
choice of some participants.

The in other words passages of the current ex-
periment tested two linked hypotheses: The first is
that OR∼SO response splits arise from two com-
ponents of the lexical semantics of the adverbial
itself: its sense of an evoked alternative and its
sense of a consequence via restatement, whereby
the truth of the second segment holds because it
provides a reformulated restatement of the first seg-
ment’s content. For passage (2), this corresponds to
the deforestation of 75,000 acres of tropical forest
entailing the disappearance of an area the size of
Central Park every 16 minutes.

The second hypothesis is that the prevalence of
and substitutability between SO and OR in (2) de-
pends on the immediately adjacency of the two seg-
ments. This was suggested by participant choices
of BUT (cf. Figure 1), as well as the observation
that in other words does not always license OR
via its lexical semantics and SO via entailment, as
shown in (6), where BUT has become more avail-
able. Note that none of the relations conveyed by
these conjunctions (CONTRAST or CONCESSION
for BUT, DISJUNCTION for OR, CONSEQUENCE
for SO) are already conveyed by the adverbial itself,
which for in other words) would be RESTATEMENT.

(6) Unfortunately, nearly 75,000 acres of tropical forest are
converted or deforested every day. I don’t know where
I heard that ______ in other words an area the size of
Central Park disappears every 16 minutes.

We tested these hypotheses by creating mini-
mal pairs of 16 passages containing in other words.
The pairs varied in the presence/absence of a meta-
linguistic comment intervening between the origi-
nal description and its reformulation, as in (7)–(8).

(7) Typically, a cast-iron wood-burning stove is 60 percent
efficient ______ in other words 40 percent of the wood
ends up as ash, smoke or lost heat.

(8) Typically, a cast-iron wood-burning stove is 60 percent
efficient. How this is measured is unclear ______ in
other words 40 percent of the wood ends up as ash,
smoke or lost heat.

For each passage, participants identified their
preferred conjunction and then any others that they
took to convey the same sense. Half the partici-
pants saw a given passage with no intervening meta-
linguistic comment, half with.

If our hypotheses are confirmed, it will show
that manipulating the immediately preceding seg-
ment can shift participants’ preference from rela-
tions associated with OR and SO (ALTERNATIVE
and CONSEQUENCE) to relations of CONTRAST or
CONCESSION. This would then be evidence that
adjacency affects what coherence relations partici-
pants take to be available.

4.2 Otherwise Dataset
Rohde et al. (2016) report surprising response splits
amongst BECAUSE∼BUT∼OR for otherwise in
their conjunction-insertion data (Figure 2). Given
that otherwise has several different functions (de-
scribed below), we hypothesize that different re-
sponse splits arise from the lexical semantics of
otherwise, combined with inference as to the func-
tion of the otherwise clause in a given passage.

One function of otherwise is in ARGUMENTA-
TION. Here, an otherwise clause provides a reason
for a given claim, as in (9). Another function is in
ENUMERATION, when the speaker first gives some
preferred or more salient options, the otherwise
clause introduces other alternative options, as in
(10). A third use is in expressing an EXCEPTION to
a generalization. Here, the main clause expresses a
generalization, while otherwise clause specifies an
exception (disjunctive alternative) to it, as in (11).

(9) Proper placement of the testing device is an important
issue ______ otherwise the test results will be inaccu-
rate.

(10) A baked potato, plonked on a side plate with sour
cream flecked with chives, is the perfect accompani-
ment ______ otherwise you could serve a green salad
and some good country bread.

(11) Mr. Lurie and Mr. Jarmusch actually catch a shark, a
thrashing 10-footer ______ otherwise the action is light.

Results presented in (Rohde et al., 2017) for
passages like (9) showed participant judgments of
OR and BECAUSE, but not BUT. Passages like
(10) yielded pairings of OR and BUT, but not
BECAUSE. Lastly, passages like (11) yielded re-
sponse splits between BUT and the less specific
AND (Knott, 1996).

Note that due to overlaps in conjunction choice,
some conjunctions cannot be unambiguously as-
sociated with a single use of otherwise: While
BECAUSE may unambiguously signal that a parti-
cipant has inferred ARGUMENTATION, OR might
indicate inference of either ARGUMENTATION or



2261

ENUMERATION. Thus we probe both participant
choices of connectives and (via paraphrase) the use
of otherwise that they take to hold.

We chose 16 passages for each use of otherwise,
based on our own category judgments. For each
passage, we asked participants to select the con-
junction that best expressed how its two segments
were related, and then any other connectives that
they took to express the same thing.

A paraphrase task was then used as further ev-
idence for the relation participants inferred in the
otherwise passages. After completing a given ses-
sion’s batch of passages, participants were asked
to select which of three options they took to be a
valid paraphrase of the passage. Each use of other-
wise was assigned a distinct paraphrase to link the
left-hand and right-hand segments (LHS, RHS).

• ARGUMENTATION: “A reason for 〈LHS〉 is
〈RHS〉.”

• EXCEPTION: “Generally 〈RHS〉. An excep-
tion is when 〈LHS〉.”

• ENUMERATION: “There’s more than one good
option for 〈goal〉. They are: 〈LHS〉, 〈RHS〉.”

We also allowed participants to choose a second
paraphrase if they thought it appropriate.

4.3 Instead Dataset
Rohde et al. (2016) report a range of participant
choices in conjunction-insertion passages involv-
ing instead (Figure 3). For passages on the left
of the figure, participants uniformly chose BUT,
while the passage on the far right yielded a strong
preference for SO. Elsewhere, some chose BUT
and some chose SO. (For the current experiment,
we ignore the fact that AND can contingently sub-
stitute for either BUT or SO as a connective in text
(Knott, 1996), focussing only on passages where
participants explicitly choose BUT and/or SO.)

Rohde et al. (2017) report even more surpris-
ing participant responses to passages such as (12),
where some participants selected both BUT and
SO as equally expressing how the segments in the
passage were related.
(12) There may not be a flight scheduled to Loja today

______ instead we can go to Cuenca. [BUT∼SO]

Neither the inter-participant split between BUT
and SO in (Rohde et al., 2016) nor the intra-
participant split between them (Rohde et al., 2017)
can be explained in terms of instead itself, since

Figure 3: Stacked bar chart for participants’ (N=28) conjunc-
tion insertions in instead passages (Rohde et al., 2016)

instead simply conveys that what follows is an al-
ternative to an unrealised situation in the context
(Prasad et al., 2008; Webber, 2013). The current
experiment tests the hypothesis that this BUT∼SO
split is a consequence of inference from properties
of the segments themselves.

To test this hypothesis, we created 16 mini-
mal pairs of passages containing instead, one of
which emphasized the information structural par-
allelism between the clauses, as in (13a), and an-
other variant (13b) that de-emphasized that par-
allelism in favor of a causal link implied by a
downward-entailing construction such as too X
(Webber, 2013). For each passage, half the partici-
pants saw the parallelism variant in the conjunction-
insertion task, while half saw the causal variant.

(13) a. There was no flight scheduled to Loja yesterday
______ instead there were several to Cuenca.

b. There were too few flights scheduled to Loja yester-
day ______ instead we went to Cuenca.

4.4 After all Dataset
In (Rohde et al., 2017), we reported a
BECAUSE∼BUT response split for passages
containing after all. We speculated that this may
be because a passage such as (14) below presents
an argument in which the second segment serves
as a REASON (hence, BECAUSE) for the first
segment, but also serves to CONTRAST with it
(hence, BUT).
(14) Yes, I suppose there’s a certain element of danger in it

______ (after all) there’s a certain amount of danger in
living, whatever you do.

We hypothesize that the BECAUSE∼BUT split
cannot be a consequence of the adverbial after all,
which the Cambridge Dictionary indicates is “used
to add information that shows that what you have
just said is true”.1 If REASON and/or CONTRAST

are being conveyed, it can’t be a consequence of
after all. As such, this response split must depend
on the reasoning that supports the inference of co-
herence between the two segments, separate from
the adverbial itself.

We test the hypothesis that the response split is
independent of the presence or absence of after all.
Starting with 16 passages that originally contained
after all, we created a variant of each passage with-
out the adverbial. The conjunction insertion task
was the same as with the other datasets.

5 Results

5.1 In other words: Inference and adjacency

Section 4.1 lays out the joint hypotheses that in-
ferred relations in passages with in other words
reflect two components of the lexical semantics of
the adverbial (leading to the OR∼SO split) and that
the presence of intervening material before in other
words reduces the availability of those relations,
favoring BUT instead.

Figure 4 shows the predicted pattern: The
no-intervening-content condition primarily yields
OR/SO responses (with variation across passages
on the OR-vs.-SO preference) with a relative in-
crease in BUT responses in the intervening-content
condition.2 Passage B corresponds to the pair of
examples (2)/(6), and passage C reflects (7)/(8).

For the analysis here and in Section 5.3, a rele-
vant first-choice conjunction was chosen and the
binary outcome of its insertion was modeled with a
mixed-effect logistic regression. Here, the insertion
of OR indeed varied with the presence/absence of
intervening material (β = −1.569, p < 0.005).

We posit that increases in BUT associated with
the intervening content indicate either an interrup-
tion of the meta-linguistic tangent or an intention
to signal a contrast with the negative affect of the

2For Passage P in Figure 4, participants may have linked
the in other words clause to the intervening material itself.

tangent itself (e.g., “I don’t know where. . . ”, “frus-
trating way of putting it”, “how this is measured is
unclear”). We speculate that the presence of BE-
CAUSE in passages with intervening content may
arise when that content implies that the situation
is somehow surprising, which in turn merits ex-
planation (e.g., “it’s an UNUSUAL role for her”,
“their ability to actually work sensitively is perhaps
QUESTIONABLE”, “it’s STRANGE to think of a
planet being born”). These hypotheses will them-
selves need to be tested.

5.2 Otherwise: Inference from semantic
features of segments

As noted in Section 4.2, passages containing oth-
erwise were used to test how semantic properties
of the segments themselves influenced conjunction
choice. The categorization of passages by the re-
searchers (16 ARGUMENTATION, 16 EXCEPTION,
16 ENUMERATION) predicts the conjunctions cho-
sen by participants. In aggregate, ≈99% of re-
sponses to ARGUMENTATION passages were BE-
CAUSE or OR or both. ≈92% of responses to EX-
CEPTION passages were BUT, AND, or both BUT
and AND. And ≈98% of responses to ENUMER-
ATION passages were BUT, AND, OR, or some
subset thereof. For analysis, a mixed-effect lo-
gistic regression modeled the binary outcome of
BUT insertion and showed significant variation
across the three categories (p < 0.001). This mea-
sure captures the difference between pairs of cate-
gories: ARGUMENTATION permits BECAUSE and
OR (hence BUT is rare) while ENUMERATION per-
mits BUT and OR (hence BUT is present) and EX-
CEPTION favors BUT (hence BUT is very frequent).
All pairwise comparisons yielded a main effect of
category on this dependent measure (p’s < 0.001).

Turning to individual passages, participant
choices are shown in Figures 5–7. For ARGUMEN-
TATION (Figure 5), the effect is uniformly strong,
with all passages showing BECAUSE or OR as

Figure 8: Instead passages, pairing a parallel variant and a causal variant. Each column shows the distribution of participants’
first choice in the conjunction-insertion task. Each participant saw only one variant.

participants’ top choice, with OR or BECAUSE
chosen as equivalent (shown in the columns la-
belled “second”). For EXCEPTION (Figure 6), BUT
is consistently the participants’ top choice.

There are a few deviations from this near uni-
form endorsement of BUT for EXCEPTION (Fig-
ure 6, passages L–P). Any hypotheses, however,
would require further experimentation to test. For
example, in passage M (see (15)) and P (see (16)),
participants rarely identified any conjunction as
conveying the same sense as BUT. However, when
their top choice was BECAUSE, they also selected
OR as conveying the same sense. As noted above,
BECAUSE and OR predominate with otherwise
used in ARGUMENTATION. This raises the question
of why passages M and P lead some participants
to infer ARGUMENTATION and other participants,
either EXCEPTION or ENUMERATION.

(15) Democrats insist that the poor should be the priority,
and that tax relief should be directed at them _____
otherwise they lack a cogent vision of the needs of a
new economy.

(16) He said that the proposed bill would give states more
flexibility in deciding whether they wanted to use the
Federal money for outright grants to municipalities or
to set up loan programs _____ otherwise it left last fall’s
Congressional legislation unchanged.

Finally, though the pattern for ENUMERATION
(Figure 7) is harder to see, combinations of BUT,
OR and AND predominate as participants’ top
choices, with a few tokens of BECAUSE and SO,
but too few to analyse as anything but noise.

The above results reflect researcher-assigned use
labels. However, the confusion matrix in Table 1
shows that on the whole, participants agree with

that assignment. The column labelled Multiple
is for cases where participants offered two para-
phrases. For ARGUMENTATION, at least one para-
phrase always corresponded to EXCEPTION, while
for ENUMERATION, it did so for most of these to-
kens (9/14). We comment on this below.

While there was less agreement when partici-
pants offered multiple paraphrases for researcher-
assigned EXCEPTION, there may be too few to-
kens here to draw any kind of conclusion. In any
case, the results for ARGUMENTATION and ENU-
MERATION agree both across participants (in what
paraphrase they choose when they don’t choose
the researcher-assigned label) and within partici-
pants (in what pairs of paraphrases they gave for
the original passage).

The above results support our hypothesis that
variability in participants’ choice of conjunctions
follows from both the lexical semantics of other-
wise and the relation that participants infer between
the segments in the passage.

5.3 Instead: Inference from a single
manipulated property

On aggregate, participants responded very differ-
ently to the parallel and causal variants of instead
passages (cf. Section 4.3). Figure 8 shows that in
all cases, the parallel variant yielded more BUT re-
sponses, whereas the non-parallel (causal) variant
yielded significantly more SO responses (main ef-
fect of (non-)parallelism: β=−7.0008, p<0.001).3

Some of these results are very strong. For exam-
ple, Passage A (17) drew all BUT responses for the

3We analyzed only 15 passages for instead and after all,
due to a presentation error of the 16th for these adverbials.

[no connective]

Figure 9: Distribution of first choice in conjunction selection task for passages with after all

parallel variant in (17a) and all SO responses for
the causal variant in (17b), as did Passage B. In a
few cases, however, the parallel variant drew vari-
able responses, even while its causal variant drew
strong SO responses. This is true of Passage O,
with parallel and causal variants in (18a–b).

(17) a. They could have been playing football in the village
green _____ instead they played in the street.

b. They didn’t like playing football in the village green
_____ instead they played in the street.

(18) a. Smugglers nowadays don’t use overland passages
_____ instead they use the seas to transport their
goods.

b. Smugglers’ overland passages nowadays are too
visible _____ instead they use the seas to transport
their goods.

One possible explanation is that participants var-
ied in the role they assigned to the positive claim in
the second segment of (18a) – either as a reason for
the negative claim in the first segment (BECAUSE),
as a contrast with that claim (BUT), or as its result
(SO). Although manipulating the segment to en-
hance either parallelism or causality can change
participant responses, it is clear that parallelism
alone doesn’t guarantee contrast.

5.4 After all: Adverb adds little to inference
Figure 9 shows participant choice of conjunction
when after all is present and when it is absent.
Their choice is largely the same for passages A–F
and K–N, with and without the adverbial. As for
passage O, since AND can contingently substitute
for BUT (Knott, 1996), the response pattern can
be considered the same as well. A by-passage cor-
relation between the rate of BUT and BECAUSE
responses across the two conditions confirms this
similarity (R2=.70, F(1,13)=30.98, p<0.001). The
outlier is passage G:
(19) There was a testy moment driving over the George Wash-

ington Bridge when the toll-taker charged him $24 for
his truck and trailer _____ after all it was New York.

With after all, the majority of participants chose
BUT as best expressing how the two segments are
connected, while without it, the majority chose BE-
CAUSE. Whatever explanation we gave here would
be pure speculation. We trust that the fact that the
other 14 passages demonstrate the predicted effect
provides sufficient evidence that splits in partici-
pant responses are not simply a result of the pres-
ence of a discourse adverbial.

6 Conclusion

While our previous work showed that multiple dis-
course relations can hold between two segments
– relations at the same semantic level, simultane-
ously available to a reader – we provided no evi-
dence as to what influences the particular relations
that are taken to be available. Our current experi-
ments have provided some such evidence. Specif-
ically, we have shown that participant responses
to systematically manipulated passages involving
discourse adverbials can be explained in terms of
both the lexical semantics of discourse adverbials
and properties of the passages that contain them.
As the conjunctions chosen by participants con-
vey senses that differ from those of the discourse
adverbials, we also provided evidence for the simul-
taneous availability of multiple coherence relations
that arise from both explicit signals and inference.
We hope the reader is now convinced that, in both
psycholinguistic research on discourse coherence
and computational work on discourse parsing, one
needs to identify and examine evidence for coher-
ence involving more than one discourse relation.
