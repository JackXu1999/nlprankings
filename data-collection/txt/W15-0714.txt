Abstract

We explore the feasibility of applying machine
translation (MT) to the translation of literary
texts. To that end, we measure the translata-
bility of literary texts by analysing parallel
corpora and measuring the degree of freedom
of the translations and the narrowness of the
domain. We then explore the use of domain
adaptation to translate a novel between two re-
lated languages, Spanish and Catalan. This
is the first time that specific MT systems are
built to translate novels. Our best system out-
performs a strong baseline by 4.61 absolute
points (9.38% relative) in terms of BLEU and
is corroborated by other automatic evaluation
metrics. We provide evidence that MT can
be useful to assist with the translation of nov-
els between closely-related languages, namely
(i) the translations produced by our best sys-
tem are equal to the ones produced by a pro-
fessional human translator in almost 20% of
cases with an additional 10% requiring at most
5 character edits, and (ii) a complementary hu-
man evaluation shows that over 60% of the
translations are perceived to be of the same (or
even higher) quality by native speakers.

1 Introduction

The field of Machine Translation (MT) has evolved
very rapidly since the emergence of statistical ap-
proaches almost three decades ago (Brown et al.,
1988; Brown et al., 1990). MT is nowadays a grow-
ing reality throughout the industry, which continues
to adopt this technology as it results in demonstra-
ble improvements in translation productivity, at least

for technical domains (Zhechev, 2012). Meanwhile,
the performance of MT systems in research contin-
ues to improve. In this regard, a recent study looked
at the best-performing systems of the WMT shared
task for seven language pairs during the period be-
tween 2007 and 2012, and estimated the improve-
ment in translation quality during this period to be
around 10% absolute, in terms of both adequacy and
fluency (Graham et al., 2014).

Having reached this level of research maturity and
industrial adoption, in this paper we explore the fea-
sibility of applying the current state-of-the-art MT
technology to literary texts, what might be consid-
ered to be the last bastion of human translation. The
perceived wisdom is that MT is of no use for the
translation of literature. We challenge that view, de-
spite the fact that – to the best of our knowledge
– the applicability of MT to literature has to date
been only partially studied from an empirical point
of view.

In this paper we aim to measure the translatability
of literary text. Our empirical methodology relies on
the fact that the applicability of MT to a given type
of text can be assessed by analysing parallel corpora
of that particular type and measuring (i) the degree
of freedom of the translations (how literal the trans-
lations are), and (ii) the narrowness of the domain
(how specific or general that text is). Hence, we
tackle the problem of measuring the translatability
of literary text by comparing the degree of freedom
of translation and domain narrowness for such texts
to documents in two other domains which have been
widely studied in the area of MT: technical docu-
mentation and news.

123



Furthermore, we assess the usefulness of MT in
translating a novel between two closely-related lan-
guages. We build an MT system using state-of-the-
art domain-adaptation techniques and evaluate its
performance against the professional human transla-
tion, using both automatic metrics and manual eval-
uation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
time that a specific MT system is built to translate
novels.

The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Sec-
tion 2 gives an overview of the current state-of-the-
art in applying MT to literary texts. In Section 3 we
measure the translatability of literary texts. In Sec-
tion 4 we explore the use of MT to translate a novel
between two related languages. Finally, in Section
5 we present our conclusions and outline avenues of
future work.

2 Background

To date, there have been only a few works on ap-
plying MT to literature, for which we provide an
overview here.

Genzel et al. (2010) explored constraining sta-
tistical MT (SMT) systems for poetry to produce
translations that obey particular length, meter and
rhyming rules. Form is preserved at the price of pro-
ducing a worse translation, in terms of the BLEU
automatic metric, which decreases from 0.3533 to
0.1728, a drop of around 50% in real terms. Their
system was trained and evaluated with WMT-09
data1 for French–English.

Greene et al. (2010) also translated poetry, choos-
ing target realisations that conform to the desired
rhythmic patterns. Specifically, they translated
Dante’s Divine Comedy from Italian sonnets into
English iambic pentameter. Instead of constrain-
ing the SMT system, they passed its output lattice
through a FST that maps words to sequences of
stressed and unstressed syllables. These sequences
are finally filtered with a iambic pentameter accep-
tor. Their output translations are evaluated qualita-
tively only.

Voigt and Jurafsky (2012) examined how refer-
ential cohesion is expressed in literary and non-
literary texts, and how this cohesion affects trans-

1http://www.statmt.org/wmt09/
translation-task.html

lation. They found that literary texts have more
dense reference chains and conclude that incorporat-
ing discourse features beyond the level of the sen-
tence is an important direction for applying MT to
literary texts.

Jones and Irvine (2013) used existing MT sys-
tems to translate samples of French literature (prose
and poetry) into English. They then used qualitative
analysis grounded in translation theory on the MT
output to assess the potential of MT in literary trans-
lation and to address what makes literary translation
particularly difficult, e.g. one objective in literary
translation, in contrast to other domains, is to pre-
serve the experience of reading a text when moving
to the target language.

Very recently, Besacier (2014) presented a pilot
study where MT followed by post-editing is ap-
plied to translate a short story from English into
French. In Besacier’s work, post-editing is per-
formed by non-professional translators, and the au-
thor concludes that such a workflow can be a useful
low-cost alternative for translating literary works, al-
beit at the expense of sacrificing translation quality.
According to the opinion of a professional translator,
the main errors had to do with using English syntac-
tic structures and expressions instead of their French
equivalents and not taking into account certain cul-
tural references.

Finally, there are some works that use MT tech-
niques in literary text, but for generation rather than
for translation. He et al. (2012) used SMT to gener-
ate poems in Chinese given a set of keywords. Jiang
and Zhou (2008) used SMT to generate the second
line of Chinese couplets given the first line. In a
similar fashion, Wu et al. (2013) used transduction
grammars to generate rhyming responses in hip-hop
given the original challenges.

This paper contributes to the current state-of-the-
art in two dimensions. On the one hand, we con-
duct a comparative analysis on the translatability
of literary text according to narrowness of the do-
main and freedom of translation. This can be seen
as a more general and complementary analysis to
the one conducted by Voigt and Jurafsky (2012).
On the other hand, and related to Besacier (2014),
we evaluate MT output for literary text. There are
two differences though; first, they translated a short
story, while we do so for a longer type of literary

124



text, namely a novel; second, their MT systems were
evaluated against a post-edited reference produced
by non-professional translators, while we evaluate
our systems against the translation produced by a
professional translator.

3 Translatability

The applicability of SMT to translate a certain text
type for a given pair of languages can be studied
by analysing two properties of the relevant parallel
data.

• Degree of freedom of the translation. While lit-
eral translations can be learnt reasonably well
by the word alignment component of SMT, free
translations may result in problematic align-
ments.

• Narrowness of the domain. Constrained do-
mains lead to good SMT results. This is due
to the fact that in narrow domains lexical selec-
tion is much less of an issue and relevant terms
occur frequently, which allows the SMT model
to learn their translations with good accuracy.

We could say then, that the narrower the domain
and the smaller the degree of freedom of the transla-
tion, the more applicable SMT is. This is, we assert,
why SMT performs well on technical documenta-
tion while results are substantially worse for more
open and unpredictable domains such as news (cf.
WMT translation task series).2

We propose to study the applicability of SMT to
literary text by comparing the degree of freedom and
narrowness of parallel corpora for literature to other
domains widely studied in the area of MT (technical
documentation and news). Such a corpus study can
be carried out by using a set of automatic measures.
The perplexity of the word alignment can be used
as a proxy to measure the degree of freedom of the
translation. The narrowness of the domain can be
assessed by measuring perplexity with respect to a
language model (LM) (Ruiz and Federico, 2014).

Therefore, in order to assess the translatability of
literary text with MT, we contextualise the problem
by comparing it to the translatability of other widely
studied types of text. Instead of considering the

2http://www.statmt.org/wmt14/
translation-task.html

translatability of literature as a whole, we root the
study along two axes:
• Relatedness of the language pair: from pairs

of languages that belong to the same family
(e.g. Romance languages), through languages
that belong to the same group (e.g. Romance
and Germanic languages of the Indo-European
group) to unrelated languages (e.g. Romance
and Finno-Ugric languages).

• Literary genre: novels, poetry, etc.
We hypothesise that the degree of applicability of

SMT to literature depends on these two axes. Be-
tween related languages, translations should be more
literal and complex phenomena (e.g. metaphors)
might simply transfer to the target language, while
they are more likely to require complex translations
between unrelated languages. Regarding literary
genres, in poetry the preservation of form might be
considered relevant while in novels it may be a lesser
constraint.

The following sections detail the experimental
datasets and the experiments conducted regarding
narrowness of the domain and degree of translation
freedom.

3.1 Experimental Setup
In order to carry out our experiment on the translata-
bility of literary texts, we use monolingual datasets
for Spanish and parallel datasets for two language
pairs with varying levels of relatedness: Spanish–
Catalan and Spanish–English.

Regarding the different types of corpora, we con-
sider datasets that fall in the following four groups:
novels, news, technical documentation and Europarl
(EP).

We use two sources for novels: two novels
from Carlos Ruiz Zafón, The Shadow of the Wind
(published originally in Spanish in 2001) and The
Angel’s Game (2008), for Spanish–Catalan and
Spanish–English, referred to as novel1; and two
novels from Gabriel Garcı́a Márquez, Hundred
Years of Solitude (1967) and Love in the Time of
Cholera (1985), for Spanish–English, referred to as
novel2.

We use two sources of news data: a corpus made
of articles from the newspaper El Periódico3 (re-

3http://www.elperiodico.com/

125



ferred to as news1) for Spanish–Catalan, and news-
commentary v84 (referred to as news2) for Spanish–
English.

For technical documentation we use four datasets:
DOGC,5 a corpus from the official journal of the
Catalan Goverment, for Spanish–Catalan; EMEA,6

a corpus from the European Medicines Agency, for
Spanish–English; JRC-Acquis (henceforth referred
as JRC) (Steinberger et al., 2006), made of leg-
islative text of the European Union, for Spanish–
English; and KDE4,7 a corpus of localisation files of
the KDE desktop environment, for the two language
pairs.

Finally, we consider the Europarl corpus
v7 (Koehn, 2005), given it is widely used in the MT
community, for Spanish–English.

All the datasets are pre-processed as fol-
lows. First they are tokenised and truecased with
Moses’ (Koehn et al., 2007) scripts. Truecasing is
carried out with a model trained on the caWaC cor-
pus for Catalan (Ljubešić and Toral, 2014) and News
Crawl 20128 both for English and Spanish.

Parallel datasets not available in a sentence-split
format (novel1 and novel2) are sentence-split using
Freeling (Padró and Stanilovsky, 2012). All paral-
lel datasets are then sentence aligned. We use Hu-
nalign (Varga et al., 2005) and keep only one-to-
one alignments. The dictionaries used for Spanish–
Catalan and Spanish–English are extracted from
Apertium bilingual dictionaries for those language
pairs.9,10 Only sentence pairs for which the confi-
dence score of the alignment is >= 0.4 are kept.11

Although most of the parallel datasets are provided
in sentence-aligned form, we realign them to ensure
that the data used to calculate word alignment per-
plexity are properly aligned at sentence level. This

dence score (Pecina et al., 2012).

is to avoid having high word alignment perplexities
due, not to high degrees of translation freedom, but
to the presence of misaligned parallel data.

3.2 Narrowness of the Domain
As previously mentioned, we use LM perplexity as
a proxy to measure the narrowness of the domain.

We take two random samples without replace-
ment for the Spanish side of each dataset, to be used
for training (200,000 tokens) and testing (20,000 to-
kens). We train an LM of order 3 and improved
Kneser-Ney smoothing (Chen and Goodman, 1996)
with IRSTLM (Federico et al., 2008).

For each LM we report the perplexity on
the testset built from the same dataset in Fig-
ure 1. The two novels considered (perplexities
in the range [230.61, 254.49]) fall somewhere be-
tween news ([359.73, 560.62]) and technical domain
([127.30, 228.38]). Our intuition is that novels cover
a narrow domain, like technical texts, but the vo-
cabulary and language used in novels is richer, thus
leading to higher perplexity than technical texts.
News, on the contrary, covers a large variety of top-
ics. Hence, despite novels possibly using more com-
plex linguistic constructions, news articles are less
predictable.

3.3 Degree of Translation Freedom
We use word alignment perplexity, as in Equation 1,
as a proxy to measure the degree of translation free-
dom. Word alignment perplexity gives an indication
of how well the model fits the data.

log2 PP = −

s

log2 p(es|fs) (1)

The assumption is that the freer the translations
are for a given parallel corpus, the higher the per-

126



plexity of the word alignment model learnt from
such dataset, as the word alignment algorithms
would have more difficulty to find suitable align-
ments.

For each parallel dataset, we randomly select a
set of sentence pairs whose overall size accounts for
500,000 tokens. We then run word alignment with
GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) in both directions,
with the default parameters used in Moses.

For each dataset and language pair, we report in
Figure 2 the perplexity of the word alignment af-
ter the last iteration for each direction. The most
important discriminating variable appears to be the
level of relatedness of the languages involved, i.e.
all the perplexities for Spanish–Catalan are below
10 while all the perplexities for Spanish–English are
well above this number.

4 MT for Literature between Related
Languages

Encouraged by the results obtained for the translata-
bility of novels (cf. Figures 1 and 2), we decided to
carry out an experiment to assess the feasibility of
using MT to assist with the translation of novels be-
tween closely-related languages. In this experiment
we translate a novel, The Prisoner of Heaven (2011)
by Carlos Ruiz Zafón, from Spanish into Catalan.
This language pair is chosen because of the maturity
of applied MT technology, e.g. MT is used along-
side post-editing to translate the newspaper La Van-
guardia (around 70,000 tokens) from Spanish into
Catalan on a daily basis (Martı́n and Serra, 2014).
We expect the results to be similar for other lan-
guages with similar degrees of similarity to Spanish,
e.g. Portuguese and Italian.

Table 1: Datasets used for MT

The translation model (TM) of our baseline sys-
tem is trained with the news1 dataset while the LM is
trained with the concatenation of news1 and caWaC.
The baseline system is tuned on news. On top of
this baseline we then build our domain-adapted sys-
tems. The domain adaptation is carried out by using
two previous novels from the same author that were
translated by the same translator (cf. the dataset
novel1 in Section 3.1). We explore their use for tun-
ing (+inDev), LM (concatenated +inLM and inter-
polated +IinLM) and TM (concatenated +inTM and
interpolated +IinTM). The testset is made of a set
of randomly selected sentence pairs from The Pris-
oner of Heaven. Table 1 provides an overview of the
datasets used for MT.

We train phrase-based SMT systems with Moses
v2.1 using default parameters. Tuning is carried out
with MERT (Och, 2003). LMs are linearly interpo-
lated with SRILM (Stolcke et al., 2011) by means
of perplexity minimisation on the development set
from the novel1 dataset. Similarly, TMs are linearly
interpolated, also by means of perplexity minimisa-
tion (Sennrich, 2012).

4.1 Automatic Evaluation

Our systems are evaluated with a set of state-of-
the-art automatic metrics: BLEU (Papineni et al.,
2002), TER (Snover et al., 2006) and METEOR
1.5 (Denkowski and Lavie, 2014).

Table 2 shows the results obtained by each of
the systems built. For each domain-adapted system

Table 3: Automatic evaluation scores for third-party MT systems

we show its relative improvement over the baseline
(columns diff). The use of in-domain data to adapt
each of the components of the pipeline, tuning (+in-
Dev), LM (+inLM and +IinLM) and TM (+inTM
and +IinTM), results in gains across all the metrics.
Additional gains are achieved when combining the
different in-domain components. Interpolation, both
for LM and TM, results in gains when compared to
the systems that use the same data in a concatenated
manner (e.g. +IinLM vs +inLM) except for the TM
in terms of TER. The best system, with in-domain
data used for all the components and interpolated
TM and LM (+inDev+IinLM+IinTM), yields a rel-
ative improvement over the baseline of 9.38% for
BLEU, 6.92% for TER and 6.5% for METEOR. Fi-
nally we show the scores obtained by a system that
uses solely in-domain data (inTM+inLM+inDev).
While its results are slightly below those of the base-
line, it should be noted that both the TM and TL of
this system are trained with very limited amounts of
data: 21,626 sentence pairs and 22,170 sentences,
respectively (cf. Table 1).

We decided to compare our system also to widely-
used on-line third-party systems, as these are the
ones that a translator could easily have access to.
We consider the following three systems: Google
Translate,12 Apertium (Forcada et al., 2011)13 and

12https://translate.google.com
13http://apertium.org/

Lucy.14 These three systems follow different ap-
proaches; while the first is statistical, the second
and the third are rule-based, classified respectively
as shallow and deep formalisms.

Table 3 shows the results of the third-party sys-
tem and compares their scores with our best domain-
adapted system in terms of relative improvement
(columns diff). The results of the third-party sys-
tems are similar, albeit slighly lower, compared to
our baseline (cf. Table 2).

We conducted statistical significance tests for
BLEU between our best domain-adapted system,
the baseline and the three third-party systems us-
ing paired bootstrap resampling (Koehn, 2004) with
1,000 iterations and p = 0.01. In all cases the im-
provement brought by our best system is found out
to be significant.

Finally we report on the percentage of translations
that are equal in the MT output and in the reference.
These account for 15.3% of the sentences for the
baseline and 19.7% for the best domain-adapted sys-
tem. It should be noted though that these tend to be
short sentences, so if we consider their percentage in
terms of words, they account for 4.97% and 7.15%
of the data, respectively. If we consider also the
translations that can reach the reference in at most
five character editing steps (Volk, 2009), then the
percentage of equal and near-equal translations pro-

14http://www.lucysoftware.com/english/
machine-translation/

128



duced by our best domain-adapted system reaches
29.5% of the sentences.

4.2 Manual Evaluation
To gain further insight on the results, we conducted a
manual evaluation. A common procedure (e.g. con-
ducted in the MT shared task at WMT) consists of
ranking MT translations. Given the source and tar-
get sides of the reference (human) translations, and
two or more outputs from MT systems, these outputs
are ranked according to their quality, i.e. how close
they are to the reference, e.g. in terms of adequacy
and/or fluency.

In our experiment, we are of course not interested
in comparing two MT systems, but rather one MT
system (the best one according to the automatic met-
rics) and the human translation. Hence, we conduct
the rank-based manual evaluation in a slightly mod-
ified setting; we do not provide the target of the ref-
erence translation as reference but as one of the MT
systems to be ranked. The evaluator thus is given
the source-side of the reference and two translations,
one being the human translation and the other the
translation produced by an MT system. The evalua-
tor of course does not know which is which. More-
over, in order to avoid any bias with respect to MT,
they do not know that one of them has been pro-
duced by a human.

Two bilingual speakers in Spanish and Catalan,
with a background in linguistics but without in-
depth knowledge of MT (again, to avoid any bias
with respect to MT) ranked a set of 101 translations.
We carried out this rank-based evaluation with the
Appraise tool (Federmann, 2012), using its 3-way
ranking task type, whereby given two translations A
and B, the evaluator can rank them as A>B (if A
is better than B), A<B (if A is worse than B) and
A=B (if both are of the same quality). Here we re-
produce verbatim the evaluation instructions given
to the evaluators:

“Given the translations by two machine transla-
tion systems A and B, the task is to rank them:
- Rank A higher than B (A>B) if the output of system
A is better than the output of system B
- Rank A lower than B (A<B) if the output of system
A is worse than the output of system B
- Rank both systems equally (A=B) if the outputs of
both systems are of an equivalent level of quality”

The inter-annotator agreement, in terms of Fleiss’
Kappa (Fleiss, 1971), is 0.49, which falls in the
band of moderate agreement [0.41, 0.60] (Landis
and Koch, 1977).

Considering the aggregated 202 judgements, we
have the breakdown shown in Table 4. In most cases
(41.58% of the judgements), both the human trans-
lation (HT) and the MT are considered to be of equal
quality. The HT is considered better than MT in
39.11% of the cases. Perhaps surprisingly, the eval-
uators ranked MT higher than HT in almost 20% of
their judgements.

Judgement Times Percentage
HT=MT 84 41.58%
HT<MT 39 19.31%
HT>MT 79 39.11%

Table 4: Manual Evaluation. Breakdown of ranks (over-
all)

We now delve deeper into the results and show
in Table 5 the breakdown of judgements by evalu-
ator. For around two thirds of the sentences, both
evaluators agreed in their judgement: in 28.71% of
the sentences both for HT=MT and for HT>MT,
and in 9.9% of the sentences for HT<MT. They
disagreed in the remaining one third of the data,
the two main disagreements being between HT=MT
and HT>MT (13.86%) and between HT=MT and
HT<MT (11.88%). The remaining case of disagree-
ment (between HT>MT and HT<MT) is encoun-
tered less frequently (6.93%).

We analyse the sets of sentences where both eval-
uators agree, for HT=MT, HT<MT and HT>MT.
First, we report on their average sentence length in
tokens, as shown in Table 6. We can conclude that

129



Source La habitación tenı́a un pequeño balcón que daba a la plaza.
Gloss The room had a small balcony facing the square.
HT La cofurna tenia un balconet que donava a la plaça.
MT L’habitació tenia un petit balcó que donava a la plaça.
Discussion Habitació (room) is the translation of habitación.

Cofurna (hovel) has slightly different meaning.
Source — ¿Adónde vas?
Gloss — Where are you going?
HT — ¿On vas? — hi vaig afegir.
MT — ¿On vas?
Discussion The snippet “hi vaig afegir” (I added) is not in the original.

Table 6: Manual Evaluation. Avg sentence length per
rank

MT results in translations of good quality for shorter
sentences than the average, while HT remains the
best translation for longer sentences.

We now look at each of these sets of sentences
and carry out a qualitative analysis, aiming at finding
out what types of sentences and translation errors are
predominant.

For most of the HT=MT cases (22), both transla-
tions are exactly the same. In the remaining 7 cases,
up to a few words are different, with both transla-
tions being accurate.

In most of the 10 sentences ranked as HT<MT,
the translator has either added some content that
is not in the original or has used words that have
a slightly different meaning than the corresponding
words in the original, while the MT translation is ac-
curate. Table 7 provides examples of both cases.

Finally, regarding the translations ranked as
HT>MT, the translation as produced by the MT sys-
tems has some errors, in most cases affecting just
one or a few words. The most common errors are
related to:

• OOVs, mainly for verbs that contain a pronoun
as a suffix in Spanish. E.g. “escrutándola”
(scrutinising her).

• Pronouns translated wrongly. E.g. “lo” (him)

wrongly translated as “ho” (that) instead of
“el”.

• Word choice. Either the translation looks un-
natural or its meaning is closely related to the
original but it is not exactly the same.

5 Conclusions and Future Work

This paper has explored the feasibility of applying
MT to the translation of literary texts. To that end,
we measured the translatability of literary texts and
compared it to that of other datasets commonly used
in MT by measuring the degree of freedom of the
translations (using word alignment perplexity) and
the narrowness of the domain (via LM perplexity).
Our results show that novels are less predictable than
texts in the technical domain but more predictable
than news articles. Regarding translation freedom,
the main variable is not related to the type of data
but to the level of relatedness of the pair of languages
involved.

Furthermore, we explored the use of state-of-the-
art domain adaptation techniques in MT to trans-
late a novel between two closely-related languages,
Spanish and Catalan. This is the first time that spe-
cific MT systems are built to translate novels. Our
best domain-adapted system outperforms a strong
baseline by 4.61 absolute points (9.38% relative)
in terms of BLEU. We provided evidence that MT
can be useful to assist with the translation of novels
between closely-related languages, namely (i) the
translations produced by our best system are equal
to the ones produced by a professional human trans-
lator in almost 20% of cases, with an additional 10%
requiring at most 5 character edits, and (ii) over 60%

130



of the translations are perceived to be of the same (or
even higher) quality by native speakers.

As this is the first work where a specific MT sys-
tem has been built to translate novels, a plethora of
research lines remain to be explored. In this work
we have adapted an MT system by learning from
previous novels from the same author. A further
step would be to learn from translators while they
are translating the current novel using incremen-
tal retraining techniques. We would like to experi-
ment with less related language pairs (e.g. Spanish–
English) to assess whether the current setup remains
useful. As pointed out by Voigt and Jurafsky (2012),
and corroborated by our manual evaluation (some
of the MT errors are due to mistranslation of pro-
nouns), we would like to explore using discourse
features. Finally, as the ultimate goal of this work
is to integrate MT in the translation workflow to as-
sist with the translation of literature, we would like
to study which is the best way of doing so, e.g. by
means of post-editing, interactive MT, etc, with real
customers.
