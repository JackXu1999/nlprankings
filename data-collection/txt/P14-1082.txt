Abstract

In this paper we present new research in
translation assistance. We describe a sys-
tem capable of translating native language
(L1) fragments to foreign language (L2)
fragments in an L2 context. Practical ap-
plications of this research can be framed in
the context of second language learning.
The type of translation assistance system
under investigation here encourages lan-
guage learners to write in their target lan-
guage while allowing them to fall back to
their native language in case the correct
word or expression is not known. These
code switches are subsequently translated
to L2 given the L2 context. We study
the feasibility of exploiting cross-lingual
context to obtain high-quality translation
suggestions that improve over statistical
language modelling and word-sense dis-
ambiguation baselines. A classification-
based approach is presented that is in-
deed found to improve significantly over
these baselines by making use of a contex-
tual window spanning a small number of
neighbouring words.

1 Introduction

Whereas machine translation generally concerns
the translation of whole sentences or texts from
one language to the other, this study focusses on
the translation of native language (henceforth L1)
words and phrases, i.e. smaller fragments, in a
foreign language (L2) context. Despite the ma-
jor efforts and improvements, automatic transla-
tion does not yet rival human-level quality. Vex-
ing issues are morphology, word-order change and
long-distance dependencies. Although there is a
morpho-syntactic component in this research, our
scope is more constrained; its focus is on the faith-
ful preservation of meaning from L1 to L2, akin to

the role of the translation model in Statistical Ma-
chine Translation (SMT).

The cross-lingual context in our research ques-
tion may at first seem artificial, but its design ex-
plicitly aims at applications related to computer-
aided language learning (Laghos and Panayiotis,
2005; Levy, 1997) and computer-aided transla-
tion (Barrachina et al., 2009). Currently, lan-
guage learners need to refer to a bilingual dictio-
nary when in doubt about a translation of a word or
phrase. Yet, this problem arises in a context, not
in isolation; the learner may have already trans-
lated successfully a part of the text into L2 leading
up to the problematic word or phrase. Dictionar-
ies are not the best source to look up context; they
may contain example usages, but remain biased to-
wards single words or short expressions.

The proposed application allows code switch-
ing and produces context-sensitive suggestions as
writing progresses. In this research we test the
feasibility of the foundation of this idea.The fol-
lowing examples serve to illustrate the idea and
demonstrate what output the proposed translation
assistance system would ideally produce. The
parts in bold correspond to respectively the in-
serted fragment and the system translation.

• Input (L1=English,L2=Spanish): “Hoy va-
mos a the swimming pool.”
Desired output: “Hoy vamos a la piscina.”

• Input (L1-English, L2=German): “Das wet-
ter ist wirklich abominable.”
Desired output: “Das wetter ist wirklich
ekelhaft.”

• Input (L1=French,L2=English): “I rentre à
la maison because I am tired.”
Desired output: “I return home because I am
tired.”

• Input (L1=Dutch, L2=English): “Workers
are facing a massive aanval op their employ-

871



ment and social rights.”
Desired output: “Workers are facing a mas-
sive attack on their employment and social
rights.”

The main research question in this research is
how to disambiguate an L1 word or phrase to
its L2 translation based on an L2 context, and
whether such cross-lingual contextual approaches
provide added value compared to baseline models
that are not context informed or compared to stan-
dard language models.

2 Data preparation

Preparing the data to build training and test data
for our intended translation assistance system is
not trivial, as the type of interactive translation as-
sistant we aim to develop does not exist yet. We
need to generate training and test data that real-
istically emulates the task. We start with a par-
allel corpus that is tokenised for both L1 and L2.
No further linguistic processing such as part-of-
speech tagging or lemmatisation takes place in our
experiments; adding this remains open for future
research.

The parallel corpus is randomly sampled into
two large and equally-sized parts. One is the basis
for the training set, and the other is the basis for
the test set. The reason for such a large test split
shall become apparent soon.

From each of the splits (S), a phrase-translation
table is constructed automatically in an unsuper-
vised fashion. This is done using the scripts
provided by the Statistical Machine Translation
system Moses (Koehn et al., 2007). It invokes
GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2000) to establish sta-
tistical word alignments based on the IBM Mod-
els and subsequently extracts phrases using the
grow-diag-final algorithm (Och and Ney,
2003). The result, independent for each set, will
be a phrase-translation table (T ) that maps phrases
in L1 to L2. For each phrase-pair (fs, ft) this
phrase-translation table holds the computed trans-
lation probabilities P (fs|ft) and P (ft|fs).

Given these phrase-translation tables, we can
now extract both training data and test data using
the algorithm in Figure 1. In our discourse, the
source language (s) corresponds to L1, the fall-
back language used for by the end-user for insert-
ing fragments, whilst the target language (t) is L2.

Step 4 is effectively a filter: two thresholds
can be configured to discard weak alignments,

1. using phrase-translation table T and par-
allel corpus split S

2. for each aligned sentence pair
(sentences ∈ Ss, sentencet ∈ St)
in the parallel corpus split (Ss,St):

3. for each fragment (fs ∈
sentences, ft ∈ sentencet) where
(fs, ft) ∈ T :

4. if P (fs|ft) · P (ft|fs) ≥ λ1
and P (fs|ft) · P (ft|fs) ≥ λ2 ·
P (fs|fstrongest t) · P (fstrongest t|fs):

5. Output a pair
(sentence′t, sentencet) where
sentence′t is a copy of t but with
fragment ft substituted by fs, i.e. the
introduction of an L1 word or phrase in
an L2 sentence.

test data on the basis of a phrase-translation ta-
ble (T ) and subset/split from a parallel corpus (S).
The indentation indicates the nesting.

i.e. those with low probabilities, from the phrase-
translation table so that only strong couplings
make it into the generated set. The parameter
λ1 adds a constraint based on the product of the
two conditional probabilities (P (ft|fs)·P (fs|ft)),
and sets a threshold that has to be surpassed.
A second parameter λ2 further limits the con-
sidered phrase pairs (fs, ft) to have the prod-
uct of their conditional probabilities not not devi-
ate more than a fraction λ2 from the joint prob-
ability for the strongest possible pairing for fs,
the source fragment. fstrongest t in Figure 1
corresponds to the best scoring translation for a
given source fragment fs. This metric thus effec-
tively prunes weaker alternative translations in the
phrase-translation table from being considered if
there is a much stronger candidate. Nevertheless,
it has to be noted that even with λ1 and λ2, the test
set will include a certain amount of errors. This is
due to the nature of the unsupervised method with
which the phrase-translation table is constructed.
For our purposes however, the test set suffices to
test our hypothesis.

872



In our experiments, we choose fixed values for
these parameters, by manual inspection and judge-
ment of the output. The λ1 parameter was set to
0.01 and λ2 to 0.8. Whilst other thresholds may
possibly produce cleaner sets, this is hard to eval-
uate as finding optimal values causes a prohibitive
increase in complexity of the search space, and
again this is not necessary to test our hypothesis.

The output of the algorithm in Fig-
ure 1 is a modified set of sentence pairs
(sentence′t, sentencet), in which the same
sentence pair may be used multiple times with
different L1 substitutions for different fragments.
The final test set is created by randomly sampling
the desired number of test instances.

Note that the training set and test set are con-
structed on their own respective and indepen-
dently generated phrase-translation tables. This
ensures complete independence of training and
test data. Generating test data using the same
phrase-translation table as the training data would
introduce a bias. The fact that a phrase-translation
table needs to be constructed for the test data is
also the reason that the parallel corpus split from
which the test data is derived has to be large
enough, ensuring better quality.

We concede that our current way of testing is
a mere approximation of the real-world scenario.
An ideal test corpus would consist of L2 sentences
with L1 fallback as crafted by L2 language learn-
ers with an L1 background. However, such cor-
pora do not exist as yet. Nevertheless, we hope to
show that our automated way of test set genera-
tion is sufficient to test the feasibility of our core
hypothesis that L1 fragments can be translated to
L2 using L2 context information.

3 System

We develop a classifier-based system composed of
so-called “classifier experts”. Numerous classi-
fiers are trained and each is an expert in translating
a single word or phrase. In other words, for each
word type or phrase type that occurs as a fragment
in the training set, and which does not map to just a
single translation, a classifier is trained. The clas-
sifier maps the L1 word or phrase in its L2 context
to its L2 translation. Words or phrases that always
map to a single translation are stored in a sim-
ple mapping table, as a classifier would have no
added value in such cases. The classifiers use the
IB1 algorithm (Aha et al., 1991) as implemented

in TiMBL (Daelemans et al., 2009).1 IB1 im-
plements k-nearest neighbour classification. The
choice for this algorithm is motivated by the fact
that it handles multiple classes with ease, but first
and foremost because it has been successfully em-
ployed for word sense disambiguation in other
studies (Hoste et al., 2002; Decadt et al., 2004),
in particular in cross-lingual word sense disam-
biguation, a task closely resembling our current
task (van Gompel and van den Bosch, 2013). It
has also been used in machine translation stud-
ies in which local source context is used to clas-
sify source phrases into target phrases, rather than
looking them up in a phrase table (Stroppa et al.,
2007; Haque et al., 2011). The idea of local phrase
selection with a discriminative machine learning
classifier using additional local (source-language)
context was introduced in parallel to Stroppa et al.
(2007) by Carpuat and Wu (2007) and Giménez
and Márquez (2007); cf. Haque et al. (2011) for
an overview of more recent methods.

The feature vector for the classifiers represents
a local context of neighbouring words, and op-
tionally also global context keywords in a binary-
valued bag-of-words configuration. The local con-
text consists of an X number of L2 words to the
left of the L1 fragment, and Y words to the right.

When presented with test data, in which the
L1 fragment is explicitly marked, we first check
whether there is ambiguity for this L1 fragment
and if a direct translation is available in our sim-
ple mapping table. If so, we are done quickly and
need not rely on context information. If not, we
check for the presence of a classifier expert for the
offered L1 fragment; only then we can proceed by
extracting the desired number of L2 local context
words to the immediate left and right of this frag-
ment and adding those to the feature vector. The
classifier will return a probability distribution of
the most likely translations given the context and
we can replace the L1 fragment with the highest
scoring L2 translation and present it back to the
user.

In addition to local context features, we also ex-
perimented with global context features. These
are a set of L2 contextual keywords for each L1
word/phrase and its L2 translation occurring in the
same sentence, not necessarily in the immediate
neighbourhood of the L1 word/phrase. The key-
words are selected to be indicative for a specific

translation. We used the method of extraction by
Ng and Lee (1996) and encoded all keywords in
a binary bag of words model. The experiments
however showed that inclusion of such keywords
did not make any noticeable impact on any of the
results, so we restrict ourselves to mentioning this
negative result.

Our full system, including the scripts for
data preparation, training, and evaluation, is
implemented in Python and freely available
as open-source from http://github.com/
proycon/colibrita/ . Version tag v0.2.1
is representative for the version used in this re-
search.

3.1 Language Model
We also implement a statistical language model as
an optional component of our classifier-based sys-
tem and also as a baseline to compare our system
to. The language model is a trigram-based back-
off language model with Kneser-Ney smooth-
ing, computed using SRILM (Stolcke, 2002) and
trained on the same training data as the translation
model. No additional external data was brought
in, to keep the comparison fair.

For any given hypothesisH , results from the L1
to L2 classifier are combined with results from the
L2 language model. We do so by normalising the
class probability from the classifier (scoreT (H)),
which is our translation model, and the language
model (scorelm(H)), in such a way that the high-
est classifier score for the alternatives under con-
sideration is always 1.0, and the highest language
model score of the sentence is always 1.0. Take
scoreT (H) and scorelm(H) to be log probabili-
ties, the search for the best (most probable) trans-
lation hypothesis Ĥ can then be expressed as:

Ĥ = arg max
H

(scoreT (H) + scorelm(H)) (1)

If desired, the search can be parametrised with
variables λ3 and λ4, representing the weights we
want to attach to the classifier-based translation
model and the language model, respectively. In
the current study we simply left both weights set to
one, thereby assigning equal importance to trans-
lation model and language model.

4 Evaluation

Several automated metrics exist for the evaluation
of L2 system output against the L2 reference out-

put in the test set. We first measure absolute accu-
racy by simply counting all output fragments that
exactly match the reference fragments, as a frac-
tion of the total amount of fragments. This mea-
sure may be too strict, so we add a more flexible
word accuracy measure which takes into account
partial matches at the word level. If output o is
a subset of reference r then a score of |o||r| is as-
signed for that sentence pair. If instead, r is a sub-
set of o, then a score of |r||o| will be assigned. A
perfect match will result in a score of 1 whereas
a complete lack of overlap will be scored 0. The
word accuracy for the entire set is then computed
by taking the sum of the word accuracies per sen-
tence pair, divided by the total number of sentence
pairs.

We also compute a recall metric that measures
the number of fragments that the system provided
a translation for as a fraction of the total number
of fragments in the input, regardless of whether
the fragment is translated correctly or not. The
system may skip fragments for which it can find
no solution at all.

In addition to these, the system’s output can be
compared against the L2 reference translation(s)
using established Machine Translation evaluation
metrics. We report on BLEU, NIST, METEOR,
and word error rate metrics WER and PER. These
scores should generally be much better than the
typical MT system performances as only local
changes are made to otherwise “perfect” L2 sen-
tences.

5 Baselines

A context-insensitive yet informed baseline was
constructed to assess the impact of L2 context in-
formation in translating L1 fragments. The base-
line selects the most probable L1 fragment per L2
fragment according to the phrase-translation ta-
ble. This baseline, henceforth referred to as the
’most likely fragment’ baseline (MLF) is analo-
gous to the ’most frequent sense’-baseline com-
mon in evaluating WSD systems.

A second baseline was constructed by weigh-
ing the probabilities from the translation table di-
rectly with the L2 language model described ear-
lier. It adds a LM component to the MLF base-
line. This LM baseline allows the comparison of
classification through L1 fragments in an L2 con-
text, with a more traditional L2 context modelling
(i.e. target language modelling) which is also cus-

874



tomary in MT decoders. Computing this base-
line is done in the same fashion as previously il-
lustrated in Equation 1, where scoreT then repre-
sents the normalised p(t|s) score from the phrase-
translation table rather than the class probability
from the classifier.

6 Experiments & Results

The data for our experiments were drawn from
the Europarl parallel corpus (Koehn, 2005) from
which we extracted two sets of 200, 000 sentence
pairs each for several language pairs. These were
used to form the training and test sets. The final
test sets are a randomly sampled 5, 000 sentence
pairs from the 200, 000-sentence test split for each
language pair.

All input data for the experiments in this section
are publicly available2.

Let us first zoom in to convey a sense of scale
on a specific language pair. The actual Europarl
training set we generate for English (L1) to Span-
ish (L2), i.e. English fallback in a Spanish con-
text, consists of 5, 608, 015 sentence pairs. This
number is much larger than the 200, 000 we men-
tioned before because single sentence pairs may be
reused multiple times with different marked frag-
ments. From this training set of sentence pairs
over 100, 000 classifier experts are derived. The
eleven largest classifiers are shown in Table 1,
along with the number of training instances per
classifier. The full table would reveal a Zipfian
distribution.

multiple translations. This implies that such words
and phrases must have occurred at least twice in
the corpus, though this threshold is made config-
urable and could have been set higher to limit the
number of classifiers. The remaining 246, 380 un-
ambiguous mappings are stored in a separate map-
ping table.

For the classifier-based system, we tested var-
ious different feature vector configurations. The
first experiment, of which the results are shown in
Figure 2, sets a fixed and symmetric local context
size across all classifiers, and tests three context
widths. Here we observe that a context width of
one yields the best results. The BLEU scores, not
included in the figure but shown in Table 2, show
a similar trend. This trend holds for all the MT
metrics.

Table 2 shows the results for English to Span-
ish in more detail and adds a comparison with the
two baseline systems. The various lXrY config-
urations use the same feature vector setup for all
classifier experts. HereX indicates the left context
size and Y the right context size. The auto con-
figuration does not uniformly apply the same fea-
ture vector setup to all classifier experts but instead
seeks to find the optimal setup per classifier expert.
This shall be further discussed in Section 6.1.

As expected, the LM baseline substantially out-
performs the context-insensitive MLF baseline.
Second, our classifier approach attains a sub-
stantially higher accuracy than the LM baseline.
Third, we observe that adding the language model
to our classifier leads to another significant gain

(configuration l1r1+LM in the results in Ta-
ble 2). It appears that the classifier approach and
the L2 language model are able to complement
each other.

Statistical significance on the BLEU scores was
tested using pairwise bootstrap sampling (Koehn,
2004). All significance tests were performed
with 5, 000 iterations. We compared the out-
comes of several key configurations. We first
tested l1r1 against both baselines; both differ-
ences are significant at p < 0.01 for both. The
same significance level was found when compar-
ing l1r1+LM against l1r1, auto+LM against
auto, as well as the LM baseline against the MLF
baseline. Automatic feature selection auto was
found to perform statistically better than l1r1,
but only at p < 0.05. Conclusions with regard to
context width may have to be tempered somewhat,
as the performance of the l1r1 configuration was
found to not be significantly better than that of the
l2r2 configuration. However, l1r1 performs
significantly better than l3r3 at p < 0.01, and
l2r2 performs significantly better than l3r3 at
p < 0.01.

In Table 3 we present some illustrative exam-
ples from the English→Spanish Europarl data.
We show the difference between the most-likely-
fragment baseline and our system.

Likewise, Table 4 exemplifies small fragments
from the l1r1 configuration compared to the
same configuration enriched with a language
model. We observe in this data that the language
model often has the added power to choose a cor-
rect translation that is not the first prediction of
the classifier, but one of the weaker alternatives

that nevertheless fits better. Though the classifier
generally works best in the l1r1 configuration,
i.e. with context size one, the trigram-based lan-
guage model allows further left-context informa-
tion to be incorporated that influences the weights
of the classifier output, successfully forcing the
system to select alternatives. This combination
of a classifier with context size one and trigram-
based language model proves to be most effective
and reaches the best results so far. We have not
conducted experiments with language models of
other orders.

6.1 Context optimisation

It has been argued that classifier experts in a word
sense disambiguation ensemble should be individ-
ually optimised (Decadt et al., 2004; van Gompel
and van den Bosch, 2013). The latter study on
cross-lingual WSD finds a positive impact when
conducting feature selection per classifier. This in-
tuitively makes sense; a context of one may seem
to be better than any other when uniformly applied
to all classifier experts, but it may well be that cer-
tain classifiers benefit from different feature selec-
tions. We therefore proceed with this line of inves-
tigation as well.

Automatic configuration selection was done by
performing leave-one-out testing (for small num-
ber of instances) or 10-fold-cross validation (for
larger number of instances, n ≥ 20) on the train-
ing data per classifier expert. Various configura-
tions were tested. Per classifier expert, the best
scoring configuration was selected, referred to as
the auto configuration in Table 2. The auto
configuration improves results over the uniformly

Table 3: Some illustrative examples of MLF-baseline output versus system output, in which system
output matches the correct human reference output. The actual fragments concerned are highlighted in
bold. The first example shows our system correcting for number agreement, the second a correction
in selecting the right preposition, and the third shows that the English word last can be translated in
different ways, only one of which is correct in this context. The last example shows a phrasal translation,
in which the determiner was duplicated in the baseline

applied feature selection. However, if we enable
the language model as we do in the auto+LM
configuration we do not notice an improvement
over l1r1+LM, surprisingly. We suspect the lack
of impact here can be explained by the trigram-
based Language Model having less added value
when the (left) context size of the classifier is two
or three; they are now less complementary.

Table 5 lists what context sizes have been cho-
sen in the automatic feature selection. A context
size of one prevails in the vast majority of cases,
which is not surprising considering the good re-
sults we have already seen with this configuration.

In this study we did not yet conduct optimisa-
tion of the classifier parameters. We used the IB1

this is done, so we do not expect it to make a pos-
itive impact. The second reason for omitting this
is more practical in nature; to do this in combina-
tion with feature selection would add substantial
search complexity, making experiments far more
time consuming, even prohibitively so.

The bottom lines in Table 2 represent results
when all right-context is omitted, emulating a real-
time prediction when no right context is available
yet. This has a substantial negative impact on re-

sults. We experimented with several asymmetric
configurations and found that taking two words to
the left and one to the right yields even better re-
sults than symmetric configurations for this data
set. This result is in line with the positive effect of
adding the LM to the l1r1.

In order to draw accurate conclusions, experi-
ments on a single data set and language pair are not
sufficient. We therefore conducted a number of ex-
periments with other language pairs, and present
the abridged results in Table 6.

There are some noticeable discrepancies for
some experiments in Table 6 when compared to
our earlier results in Table 2. We see that the lan-
guage model baseline for English→French shows
the same substantial improvement over the base-
line as our English→Spanish results. The same
holds for the Chinese→English experiment. How-
ever, for English→Dutch and English→Chinese
we find that the LM baseline actually performs
slightly worse than baseline. Nevertheless, in all
these cases, the positive effect of including a Lan-
guage Model to our classifier-based system again
shows. Also, we note that in all cases our system
performs better than the two baselines.

Another discrepancy is found in the BLEU
scores of the English→Chinese experiments,
where we measure an unexpected drop in BLEU
score under baseline. However, all other scores do
show the expected improvement. The error rate
metrics show improvement as well. We therefore
attach low importance to this deviation in BLEU
here.

In all of the aforementioned experiments, the
system produced a single solution for each of the
fragments, the one it deemed best, or no solution

at all if it could not find any. Alternative evaluation
metrics could allow the system to output multiple
alternatives. Omission of a solution by definition
causes a decrease in recall. In all of our experi-
ments recall is high (well above 90%), mostly be-
cause train and test data lie in the same domain and
have been generated in the same fashion, lower re-
call is expected with more real-world data.

7 Discussion and conclusion

In this study we have shown the feasibility of
a classifier-based translation assistance system in
which L1 fragments are translated in an L2 con-
text, in which the classifier experts are built indi-
vidually per word or phrase. We have shown that
such a translation assistance system scores both
above a context-insensitive baseline, as well as an
L2 language model baseline.

Furthermore, we found that combining this
cross-language context-sensitive technique with
an L2 language model boosts results further.

The presence of a one-word right-hand side
context proves crucial for good results, which has
implications for practical translation assistance ap-
plication that translate as soon as the user finishes
an L1 fragment. Revisiting the translation when
right context becomes available would be advis-
able.

We tested various configurations and conclude
that small context sizes work better than larger
ones. Automated configuration selection had pos-
itive results, yet the system with context size one
and an L2 language model component often pro-
duces the best results. In static configurations, the
failure of a wider context window to be more suc-

Table 6: Results on different datasets and language pairs. The iwslt12ted set is the dataset used in the
IWSLT 2012 Evaluation Campaign (Federico et al., 2012), and is formed by a collection of transcriptions
of TED talks. Here we used of just over 70, 000 sentences for training. Recall for each of the four datasets
is 0.9498 (en-nl), 0.9494 (en-fr), 0.9386 (en-zh), and 0.9366 (zh-en)

cesful may be attributed to the increased sparsity
that comes from such an expansion.

The idea of a comprehensive translation assis-
tance system may extend beyond the translation of
L1 fragments in an L2 context. There are more
NLP components that might play a role if such a
system were to find practical application. Word
completion or predictive editing (in combination
with error correction) would for instance seem an
indispensable part of such a system, and can be
implemented alongside the technique proposed in
this study. A point of more practically-oriented
future research is to see how feasible such combi-
nations are and what techniques can be used.

An application of our idea outside the area of
translation assistance is post-correction of the out-
put of some MT systems that, as a last-resort
heuristic, copy source words or phrases into their
output, producing precisely the kind of input our
system is trained on. Our classification-based ap-
proach may be able to resolve some of these cases
operating as an add-on to a regular MT system –
or as a independent post-correction system.

Our system allows L1 fragments to be of arbi-
trary length. If a fragment was not seen during
training stage, and is therefore not covered by a
classifier expert, then the system will be unable

to translate it. Nevertheless, if a longer L1 frag-
ment can be decomposed into subfragments that
are known, then some recombination of the trans-
lations of said sub-fragments may be a good trans-
lation for the whole. We are currently exploring
this line of investigation, in which the gap with
MT narrows further.

Finally, an important line of future research
is the creation of a more representative test set.
Lacking an interactive system that actually does
what we emulate, we hypothesise that good ap-
proximations would be to use gap exercises, or
cloze tests, that test specific aspects difficulties
in language learning. Similarly, we may use
L2 learner corpora with annotations of code-
switching points or errors. Here we then assume
that places where L2 errors occur may be indica-
tive of places where L2 learners are in some trou-
ble, and might want to fall back to generating L1.
By then manually translating gaps or such prob-
lematic fragments into L1 we hope to establish a
more realistic test set.
