Abstract

This paper presents a pipeline for aspect-
based sentiment analysis of Chinese texts in
the automotive domain. The input to the
pipeline is a string of Chinese characters;
the output is a set of relationships between
evaluations and their targets. The main goal
is to demonstrate how knowledge about sen-
tence structure can increase the precision,
insight value and granularity of the output.
We formulate the task of sentiment analysis
in two steps, namely unit identification and
relation extraction. In unit identification,
we identify fairly well-delimited linguistic
units which describe features, emotions and
evaluations. In relation extraction, we dis-
cover the relations between evaluations and
their “target” features.

1 Introduction

Whereas most work on sentiment analysis, and es-
pecially on less covered languages such as Chi-
nese, is based on probabilistic models and the
use of general sentiment lexica, we believe that
a holistic approach should also take into ac-
count general linguistic knowledge. On the one
hand, this allows to leverage the results of several
decades of research in theoretical linguistics. On
the other hand, the hard-coding of general prin-
ciples of language structure allows us to create a
linguistically adequate training space for further
application of probabilistic models.

In the following, we present the “bottom-up”
component of our sentiment system which builds
opinion representations by a progression along
three levels - the lexical, the phrasal and the sen-
tence level. The system has been conceptualized
manually and bootstrapped on a corpus of about 1
mio. automotive reviews with an average length
of 135 Chinese characters.1 We use a prebuilt lex-

1The reviews were crawled from popular automo-

icon with ca. 2000 entries which contains opin-
ion words, their modifiers, car features as well as
a large number of functional categories relevant
for the syntactic analysis of phrases and sentences.
The performance of the system is evaluated on a
testset of 800 annotated sentences. In practice, the
presented model is complemented by a probabilis-
tic model which performs topic and polarity clas-
sification on the sentence and the document levels;
this component will not be described below due to
space limitations.

The basic assumption on which the model
builds is that language follows rules. Many of
these rules have been extensively studied in the
linguistic literature and have been taken to a level
of abstraction which allows for a straightforward
encoding. Incorporating these rules spares us the
construction of probabilistic models for the dis-
covery of already established general knowledge
about linguistic structure. For example, it has
long been observed that Chinese phrase struc-
ture is largely head-final (Huang 1982, Li 1990,
i. a.): nominal modifiers precede their head nouns,
whereas degree and negation adverbs normally
precede the adjectives or verbs they modify. Due
to the relative rigidity of word order in Chinese
on the phrasal level, a small set of correspond-
ing phrase-level rules achieves a high coverage on
our dataset. Rules do not perform as well on sen-
tence level; nevertheless, some general observa-
tions are possible: for example, AP targets precede
their APs. These high-level observations form the
basis of a sequence classifier which determines
whether a sequence of words between two syntac-
tic phrases establishes or disrupts one of the target
relations between these phrases.

The paper is structured as follows: after a very
brief review of research on aspect-based senti-
ment analysis (henceforth ABSA), we formulate

our task and, specifically, present the output for-
mat of the system (Section 3). In the second step,
we briefly describe the categories used in our lex-
ical resources (Section 4). In the third step, we
describe the three levels of processing (Section 5).
Finally, we present the evaluation of our system
(Section 6).

2 Previous work

ABSA has been exploited as a refined alternative
to sentiment analysis on the sentence and the doc-
ument level: whereas the latter targets the general
sentiment or polarity of a piece of text, ABSA out-
puts a mapping from specific aspects of the dis-
cussed topic to their evaluations. Different ABSA
approaches have been exploited; thus, Popescu
and Etzioni (2005) and Kim and Hovy (2006)
present unsupervised algorithms for extracting as-
pects and determining sentiment in review text.
Ding et al. (2008) and Liu (2012) describe ap-
proaches based on rules of semantic composition
and distance metrics for the identification of rela-
tions between aspects and their opinions. Due to
the relatively fine granularity of the task, parsing-
based approaches have been proposed to capture
the aspect/sentiment relations based on sentence
structure (Jiang et al. 2011, Boiy and Moens 2009,
i. a.). Further, the SemEval-2014 task on ABSA
(Pontiki et al., 2014) has been addressed with a
number of promising approaches and also signif-
icantly contributed to a unified understanding of
ABSA.

Still, most research is focussed on the English
language; for Chinese, most approaches to senti-
ment analysis are targeted on lexicon construction
(e. g. Liu et al. 2013) or sentence/document-level
sentiment classification.2 Only few contributions
aim at a finer-grained analysis at the aspect level
(Ku et al. (2009), Su et al. (2008)).

3 Task

The goal of aspect-based sentiment analysis is
to derive the opinions of a speaker about an entity
and its features (Liu, 2012, p. 58). In our frame-
work, opinions can be subclassified into evalua-
tions and emotions. Evaluations express how the
author evaluates a specific feature (e. g. good, ex-
pensive), whereas emotions express how the au-

ysis organized by the Professional Committee of Information
Retrieval (中文倾向性分析评测委员会) 2008 - 2014.

thor feels about a specific feature (e. g. to please,
angry).

We formulate the task in two stages - the iden-
tification of syntactic units and the extraction of
relations between the syntactic units. Thus, given
an opinion statement on a specific product, we
“translate” the statement into a set of (feature, <
evaluation|emotion > ) pairs in two processing
steps:

1. Build three sets of syntactic units F (fea-
tures), EV (evaluations) and EM (emo-
tions). For convenience, we will use E =
EM ∪ EV in cases where the evalua-
tion/emotion distinction is not relevant.

2. For each e ∈ E, find whether it has an opin-
ion target f ∈ F .

A word is in place about the semantic orga-
nization of evaluations and emotions in our sys-
tem. It has long been observed that many evalu-
ation words come with implicit features; for ex-
ample, the evaluation beautiful implicitly contains
the feature VisualAppearance. In order to preserve
this meaning, we adopt a scalar representation of
evaluations (cf. Kennedy and McNally (2005) for
a linguistic analysis of scalar expressions): eval-
uations are represented as pairs of a feature and
a numerical value which “maps” the evaluation
to some point on the feature scale [-3, 3]. Thus,
beautiful gets the representation (VisualAppear-
ance, 2), whereas ugly gets the representation (Vi-
sualAppearance, -2). Similarly, emotions are also
represented as pairs of the emotion concept and a
numerical value representing the intensity of the
emotion (e. g. angry: (Anger, 2)).

The final mapping goes from sequences of fea-
tures to numerical evaluations. In a feature se-
quence [f1, f2 . . . fn], features are ordered by the
subfeature relation, such that fi (with i > 0) is a
subfeature of fi−1. Consider the following feature
expression:

(1) 方向盘
steering.wheel

的
DE

指针
indicator

the indicator of the steering wheel

Our representation is [SteeringWheel, Indica-
tor], whereby Indicator is interpreted as a subfea-
ture of SteeringWheel.

Further, implicit features that are contained in
associated evaluations are also “moved” into the
feature sequence:

56



(2) 方向盘
steering.wheel

的
DE

指针
indicator

很
very

精准。
precise

The indicator of the steering wheel is very
precise.

This sentence contains the evaluation ‘precise’.
According to the above description, it is decom-
posed into a feature (Precision) and a positive eval-
uation. The feature is moved into the feature se-
quence. The resulting mapping is as follows:

(3) [SteeringWheel, Indicator, Precision] →
+2

Thus, instead of limiting ourselves to entities
and restricted sets of their immediate features, we
adapt a “higher-order” view and allow a hierarchi-
cal feature sequence of arbitrary depth. This struc-
ture seamlessly integrates implicit features and
flexibly captures any granularity that is intended
by the author of the text. At the same time, the
value of the evaluation is reduced to a single nu-
merical value, which allows for a straightforward
aggregation of the final results.

4 Lexical basis

Out lexical resources contain functional and se-
mantic categories. Members of “functional” cat-
egories (e. g. conjunctions, phrase-final markers)
are only relevant for the syntactic analysis. Se-
mantic categories are relevant for the interpreta-
tion of opinions. The top-level semantic categories
are:
• Features, e. g. 外观 (‘look’), 座椅 (‘seat’),
颜色 (‘color’)

• Evaluations:
– with implicit features, e. g. 好看

(‘beautiful’ → VisualAppearance), 便
宜 (‘cheap’→ Price)

– without implicit features, e. g. 不错
(‘not bad’), 一般 (‘ordinary’), 还可以
(‘OK’)

• Emotions, e. g. 赞美 (‘admire’), 烦人 (‘an-
noying’)

• Degree adverbs and negation words, e. g. 非
常 (‘very’),稍微 (‘a little bit’),不 (‘not’)

Each of these categories is in turn subclassified
into more fine-grained classes which capture in-
formation about the linguistic use of the subclass
members.

5 Processing steps

Figure illustrates the in- and output, the three
processing steps as well as the resources involved
in these steps.
5.1 Preprocessing

We use the third-party tool jieba3 for word seg-
mentation and POS tagging; both steps are cus-
tomized in order to achieve a better performance
on domain- and task-specific data. Specifically,
the dictionary provided by the tool is inter-
sected with a user-specified dictionary. This user-
specified dictionary contains all words from our
lexical resources. The user-added words are anno-
tated with customized POS tags, such as ‘F’ for
feature, ‘EV’ for evaluation etc. The following
two examples depict the same sentence as output
by jieba without and with customization:

(4) a. original jieba output without cus-
tomization:

后排/vn
rear.row

空间/n
space

已经/d
already

做/v
make

得/ud
DE

很/d
very

不错/a
not.bad

了/ul
PFV

。/x

The rear space is already quite not
bad.

b. after customization:

后排空间/F
rear.space

已经/d
already

做/v
make

得/ud
DE

很/D
very

不错/EV
not.bad

了/ul
PFV

。/x

The rear space is already quite not
bad.

Thus, we see that the two words 后排 (‘rear
row’) and空间 (‘space’) are merged into one word
in the customized output since this combination
occurs frequently in automotive texts and has a
quasi-lexicalized meaning; the resulting word gets
our custom POS tag ‘F’ (feature). Further, the
POS tag of不错 is changed from the original jieba
tag ‘a’ to the custom tag ‘EV’ (evaluation).

5.2 Unit identification

In the next step, we identify phrasal units corre-
sponding to features, evaluations, emotions. We
use a phrase rule grammar which is based on reg-
ular expressions involving the POS tags of the

words. Figure 2 shows the parsed version of ex-
ample (4b).

In the following, we present some of the most
common phrase structures for features and evalu-
ations/emotions that are used in our system.

Feature phrases Besides simple NPs consisting
only of one feature word, the most frequent types
of feature phrases are phrases with nominal mod-
ifiers, coordinated NPs and NPs with pronominal
modifiers:

(5) NP modifier:

座椅
seat

的
DE

材料
material

the material of the seats

(6) 它
it
的
DE

设计
design

its design

(7) 前排
front.row

（跟/和）
(and)

后排
rear.row

the front and the rear row

Evaluation and emotion chunks The class of
evaluations consists of adjectives, whereas the
class of emotions consists both of adjectives and

verbs. However, evaluations and emotions get a
unified treatment at the unit level, since Chinese
stative verbs behave similarly to adjectives: they
can also be modified by degree adverbs, used in
comparative constructions etc.

Besides simple lexical units, the following are
the most frequent phrase types for the E class:

(8) a. Verb or adjective preceded by nega-
tion or degree adverb:
很
very

难受
difficult.to.bear

very difficult to bear
b. Adjective followed by degree adverb:
小
small

了
PFV

点
a.bit

a bit small

Evaluations can be coordinated in various ways;
for example, coordination can be expressed by
simple juxtaposition, with a comma or in the 又
E1又 E2 construction:

(9) a. juxtaposition / punctuation:
精准
precise

(，)
(,)
灵活
flexible

precise and flexible

58



b. 又 E1又 E2:
又
CONJ

精准
precise

又
CONJ

灵活
flexible

both precise and flexible

Besides, evaluations are often expressed by so-
called “possessed features”: the evaluation value
is derived from the “amount” to which a feature is
possessed by the discussed entity:

(10) 没
NEG

有
have

活力
vigor

not vigorous

5.3 Relation extraction
After identifying the syntactic units of interest, we
proceed with identifying sentence-level relations
between these units. In the literature, there are
two major approaches to the identification of rela-
tions between evaluations and their targets. On the
one hand, some authors recur to parsing and iden-
tify evaluation targets based on dependency rela-
tions (Wu et al. 2009, Jiang et al. 2011, i. a.). On
the other hand, distance metrics can be used (Ding
et al., 2008; Liu, 2012). Since we want to avoid the
overhead of full-fledged syntactic parsing, but also
want to improve the accuracy of simple distance
metrics, we develop a sequence classifier which
determines whether a given sequence of words be-
tween a feature and an evaluation/emotion phrase
indicates a target relation.

The two semantic relations of interest are the
causer and the theme relation. Additionally, the
system analyzes a third non-semantic relation –
the topic – which provides relevant discourse-
structural information on the overall aspect dis-
cussed in a sentence.

The causer relation The causer relation is a
fairly well-delimited relation which describes the
causer of some state of event. In our model, it
is applied to emotions caused by specific features.
In the most basic cases, the causer is expressed as
subject of one of the causative verbs (让,令 etc.):

(11) 动力
power

让
CAUS

我
me
非常
very

失望。
desperate

The power really makes me desperate.

The theme relation The theme relation is ex-
pressed differently for evaluations and emotions.
In the case of evaluations, it can be realized as the
single argument of an AP or the nominal head of
an adjectival modifier:

(12) a. Single argument of an AP:
设计
design

特别
particularly

时尚。
fashionable

The design is particularly fashionable.
b. Nominal head of an adjectival modi-

fier:
特别
particularly

时尚
fashionable

的
DE

设计
design

a particularly fashionable design

With respect to emotions, the theme relation is
only relevant for verbs; the feature targets of ad-
jectives are covered by the causer relation. Thus,
themes can be expressed as (possibly topicalized)
objects of emotion verbs:

(13) a. Object in canonical postverbal posi-
tion:
我
me
很
very

喜欢
like

它
it
的
DE

设计。
design

I like its design a lot.
b. Topicalized object:
设计
design

很
very

喜欢
like

，
,

...

...
The design, I like it a lot, ...

5.4 Relation extraction

In the above examples, relations hold between ad-
joined constituents and can thus be easily recog-
nized. However, in many cases, several words oc-
cur between the evaluation/emotion and its target:

(14) 后排空间
rear.row

已经
space

做
already

得
make

很
DE

不错
very

了。
not.bad PFV
The rear space is already quite not bad.

From our corpus, we bootstrap the most fre-
quent sequences that occur between themes and
emotions/evaluations, emotions and themes as
well as causers and emotions. We then apply a
simple classifier for the classification of unseen se-
quences.

6 Evaluation

The system is evaluated on a testset of 800 sen-
tences annotated for feature, evaluation and emo-
tion phrases and for relations between them. The
annotation was carried out according to previously
developed annotation guidelines; we worked with

59



Precision Recall
F-phrases 87.43% 85.37%
EV-phrases 89.21 % 84.29%
EM-phrases 88.56% 85.32%

Table 1: Results of unit identification

Precision Recall
F-EV relations - theme 89.2% 87.33%
F-EM relations - theme 84.01% 83.10%
F-EM relations - causer 86.49% 87.90%

Table 2: Results of relation extraction

two independent annotators - a native Chinese stu-
dent without specialized linguistic knowledge and
a non-native linguist with very good mastery of
the Chinese language. They proceeded in three
steps: at the phrase level, the total F-score of inter-
annotator agreement was 91.3%. The diverging
items were discussed with a third team member
to create a unified phrase-level annotation. The re-
viewed corpus was then annotated for relations be-
tween opinion and their targets; in this step, inter-
annotator agreement reached 93.4%.

Table 1 shows the results achieved in unit iden-
tification; table 2 shows the results achieved for
relation extraction on the test set with finalized an-
notation of F/EV/EM phrases.
7 Outlook

We have shown that the use of a prebuilt lexicon
together with the application of general language
rules allows to achieve a considerable accuracy in
ABSA for Chinese. Currently, the presented sys-
tem is being extended with a number of more com-
plex sentence-level relations, specifically compar-
ative structures and modal operators. Further,
