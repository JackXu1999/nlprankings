Abstract 

 

 Nowadays in tunisia, the arabic Tunisian Dialect 
(TD) has become progressively used in interviews, 

news and debate programs instead of Modern 

Standard Arabic (MSA). Thus, this gave birth to a 

new kind of language. Indeed, the majority of speech 

is no longer made in MSA but alternates between 

MSA and TD. This situation has important negative 

consequences on Automatic Speech Recognition 

(ASR): since the spoken dialects are not officially 

written and do not have a standard orthography, it is 

very costly to obtain adequate annotated corpora to 

use for training language models and building 

vocabulary.  There are neither parallel corpora 

involving Tunisian dialect and MSA nor dictionaries.  

In this paper, we describe a method for building a 

bilingual dictionary using explicit knowledge about 

the relation between TD and MSA. We also present 

an automatic process for creating Tunisian Dialect 

(TD) corpora.  

1 Introduction 

Recently, due to the changes that have 

occurred in the Arab world, we noticed a new 

remarkable diversity in the media. The Arabic 

dialects used in daily life have become 

progressively used and represented in interviews, 

news and debate programs instead of Modern 

Standard Arabic (MSA). In Tunisia, for example, 

the revolution has affected not only the people 

but also the media.  

 

 

 

For that reason, the media programs have been 

changed: television channels, political debates 

and broadcasts news have been multiplied. This 

gave birth to a new kind of language. Indeed, the 

majority of speech is no longer made in MSA but 

alternates between MSA and Tunisian Dialect 

(TD). Thus, we can distinguish in the same 

speech, MSA words, TD words and MSA-TD 

words such as a word with an MSA component 

(root) and dialectal affixes. This situation poses 

significant challenges to NLP: In fact, applying 

NLP tools designed for MSA to TD yields a 

significantly lower performance, making it 

imperative to direct research towards building 

resources and tools that make it possible to 

process this kind of language. In our case, we 

aim to convert this new language into text. 

However, this process presents a series of 

linguistic and computational challenges. Some of 

these relate to language modeling: studying large 

amounts of text to learn about patterns of words 

in a language. This task is complicated because 

of the total lack of TD resources, whether 

parallel TD-MSA text or dictionaries. In this 

paper, we describe a method that helps to create 

Tunisian Dialect (TD) text corpora and the 

associated lexical resources and also build a 

bilingual MSA-TD dictionary. This paper is 

organized as follows: After discussing related 

work, we present our method to deal with the 

lack of Tunisian resources (Section3). We then 

proceed to discuss the method in details: we 

explain the manner of creating Tunisian verbal 

419



resources (Sections 4 and 5). We present in 

Section 6 a tool for generating dialectal corpora. 

We evaluate and discuss the results in Section 7. 

2 Related work  

Arabic dialects have earned the status of living 

languages in linguistic studies, thus we see the 

emergence of a serious effort to study patterns 

and regularities in these linguistic varieties of 

Arabic (Brustad, 2000; Holes, 2004; Erwin, 

1963).  

To date, most of these studies have been field 

studies or theoretical in nature with limited 

annotated data. In fact, Dialectal Arabic (DA) is 

emerging as the language of the news and of 

many varieties of television programs, and also 

of informal communication online, in emails, 

blogs, discussion forums, chats, SMS, etc. In 

current statistical Natural Language Processing 

(NLP) there is an inherent need for large scale 

annotated resources for a language (Diab et al., 

2010).  

 But, research on computerization of DA is 

still in its early stages especially for TD. Several 

researchers have explored the idea of exploiting 

existing MSA rich resources to build tools for 

DA NLP. For example, (Chiang et al., 2006) 

built syntactic parsers for DA trained on MSA 

Treebanks. Such approaches typically expect the 

presence of tools/resources to relate DA words to 

their MSA variants or translations. Given that 

DA and MSA do not have much parallel in terms 

of corpora to help translate DA-to-MSA, (Abo 

Bakr  et al., 2008) introduced a hybrid approach 

to transfer a sentence from Egyptian Arabic into 

MSA. This hybrid system consisted of a 

statistical system for tokenizing and tagging, and 

a rule-based system for constructing diacritized 

MSA sentences. Moreover, (Al-Sabbagh and 

Girju, 2010) described an approach of mining the 

Web to build an Egyptian-to-MSA lexicon. 

(Diab et al., 2010) presented an information 

retrieval project COLABA (Cross Lingual 

Arabic Blog Alerts) that aims to create resources 

and processing tools for dialectal Arabic blogs. 

The COLABA system consists in taking an MSA 

query and translating it or its component words 

into DA or alternatively converting all DA 

documents in the search collection into MSA 

before searching on them with the MSA query. 

To do so, they created DIRA (Dialectal 

Information Retrieval for Arabic), which is a 

term expansion tool for information retrieval 

over dialectal Arabic collections, especially the 

Egyptian and the Levantine dialects, using 

Modern Standard Arabic queries. (Habash and 

Rombow, 2006) presented MAGEAD 

(Morphological Analyser and Generator of 

Arabic dialect). MAGEAD works both on 

analyzing and generating Egyptian and 

Levantine verbs. The limitation of MAGEAD is 

that it doesn't deal with verbs that change their 

roots when moving from MSA to Dialect. 

(Shaalan et al. 2007) proposed a system for 

translating MSA into the Egyptian dialect. To do 

so, they tried to build a parallel corpus between 

the Egyptian dialect and MSA based on mapping 

rules EGY-MSA. 

As a conclusion, for MSA and its dialects, 

there are no naturally occurring parallel corpora. 

It is this fact that has led researchers to 

investigate the use of explicit linguistic 

knowledge.  

Dialects are under-resourced languages: 

Spoken languages which have no written form 

can be classified as under-resourced languages 

and as a consequence have no annotated 

resources. Therefore, several studies have 

attempted to overcome the problems of lack of 

resources for these languages. In order to 

computerize the existing Swiss dialect, (Scherrer, 

2008) developed a translation system: standard 

German to Swiss German. The system developed 

is based on translating a bilingual lexicon from 

standard German to any variety of the dialect 

continuum of German-speaking Switzerland. 

Moreover, there are several languages from the 

group of under-resourced languages that do not 

have a relation with a well-resourced language. 

Indeed, (Nimaan et al. 2006) presented several 

scenarios to collect corpora in order to 

automatically process the Somali language: 

collecting a corpus from the Web, automatic 

synthesis of texts and machine translation of 

French into Somali. (SENG, 2010) selected news 

sites in Khmer to collect data in order to solicit 

the lack of resources in Khmer. 

Related work vs. the Tunisian dialect: The 

literature shows that there is little work that dealt 

with the Tunisian dialect, the target language of 

this work. (Graja et al., 2011) for example, 

treated the Tunisian dialect for understanding 

speech. To do so, the researchers relied on 

manual transcripts of conversations between 

agents at the train station and travelers. The 

scope of application is limited and so, the 

vocabulary is not very rich. However, a limited 

vocabulary is a problem if we want to model a 

language model for a system of recognition of 

420



television programs with a wide and varied 

vocabulary.  In addition, (Zribi et al., 2013) 

presented OTTA (Orthographic Transcription for 

Tunisian Arabic), a set of guidelines orthography 

to transcribe Tunisian Arabic. This work is 

helpful for our case in that it will facilitate the 

identification of the orthography of the Tunisian 

words that we will build.  

3 Method to create a Tunisian Dialect 
lexicon 

In Arabic, there are almost no parallel corpora 

involving the Tunisian Dialect and MSA. 

Therefore, Machine Translation (MT) is not 

easy, especially when there are no MT resources 

available such as a naturally occurring parallel 

text or a transfer lexicon. So, to deal with this 

problem, we propose to leverage the large 

amount of annotated MSA resources available by 

exploiting MSA/dialect similarities and 

addressing known differences. Our approach 

consists first in studying the morphological, 

syntactic and lexical differences by exploiting 

the Penn Arabic Treebank. Second, we present 

these differences by developing rules and 

building dialectal concepts. Finally, we define a 

lexical data base to store these transformations 

into dictionaries.   

3.1 Tunisian Dialect Vs. MSA 

The Tunisian Arabic dialect is attached to the 

Arab Maghreb and is spoken by twelve million 

people living mainly in Tunisia. It is generally 

known to its speakers as the 'Darija' or 'Tounsi' 

which simply means "Tunisian", to distinguish it 

from Modern Standard Arabic (Baccouche, 

1994). 

The Tunisian dialect is considered as an under-

resourced language. It has neither a standard 

orthographic or written text nor dictionaries. 

Actually, there is no strict separation between 

Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and its dialects, 

but a continuum dominated by mixed forms 

(MSA-Dialect). In the last two years, this dialect 

became the language spoken in most of the 

media instead of standard Arabic. 

But this dialect has a sophisticated form which 

mixes MSA and TD forms. Thus, given the 

similarities between TD and MSA, the resources 

available to MSA can be advantageously used to 

create dialectal resources. 

3.2 Penn Arabic Treebank corpora to 
create a bilingual MSA-TD lexicon   

Treebanks are important resources that allow for 

important research in general NLP applications. 

In the case of Arabic, two important treebanking 

efforts exist: the Penn Arabic Treebank (PATB) 

(Maamouri et al., 2004; Maamouri et al., 2009) 

and the Prague Arabic Dependency Treebank 

(PADT) (Smrž et al., 2008).  The PATB 

provides tokenization, complex POS tags, and 

syntactic structure; it also provides empty 

categories, diacritizations, and lemma choices. 

The ATB consists of 23,611 parse-annotated 

sentences (Bies and Maamouri, 2003; Maamouri 

and Bies, 2004) collected from Arabic newswire 

texts in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). The 

ATB annotation scheme involves 497 different 

POS-tags with morphological information. In 

this work, we attempted to mitigate the genre 

differences by transforming the MSA-ATB to 

look like TD-ATB. This will allow creating in 

tandem a bilingual lexicon with different 

dialectal concepts (Figure1). For this purpose, we  

 

adopted a transformation method based on the 

parts of speech of ATB's words, as discussed in 

the following. 

 

Figure1- Method for creating TD resources 

4 Mapping rules based on verbal 
morphological distinction 

There’s a difference between verb conjugation in 

MSA and that in TD. We find that in TD, the 

gender distinction is not marked. Most Tunisian 

people do not distinguish between masculine and 

feminine with the second person-singular. 

Similarly, we mark the absence of the masculine 

and feminine dual. Another conjugation 

difference is in the passive form of the TD and 

MSA verb.  In fact, the passive form of most 

Tunisian verbs is obtained by preceding the verb 

with the consonant 'ت' [t]. Unlike in MSA, 

passive verbs in TD cause the transformation of 

the structure of the sentence: For example, the 

transformation of the sentence (Active voice)  كال

 klA alTfol AltofeHap/The boy ate the/الطفل التفاحة

421



apple/ is in passive voice “التفاحة تاكلت”/AltofeHa 

teklit/The apple has been eaten/  

In the imperfect, the [t] lies between the root and 

the prefix as in the following: 

 yitekil/ The lunch (M) is edible. Masculin/"يتاكل" 

 titekil/The apple (F) is edible Feminin. In/"تتاكل"/

addition to this type of form, the dialect offers 

another form frequently used as question such as: 

" تاكلشيت "/titekil$y/ Is it edible?  

 In this work, as we aim to build a lexicon for 

Tunisian verbs, we must take into account these 

differences. But to define Tunisian inflected 

forms, we should first define the main concept of 

“Arabic verb” and we will do this by studying 

the morphological and lexical differences that 

may exist between TD verbs and MSA verbs. 

Indeed, in Arabic there are three principal verbal 

concepts: 

1-Root: It is the basic source of all forms of 

Arabic verbs. The root is not a real word; rather, 

it is a sequence of three consonants that can be 

found in all words that are related to it. Most 

roots are composed of three letters; very few are 

composed of four or five consonants. 

2-Pattern: In MSA, patterns are models with 

different structures that are applied to the root to 

create a lemma. For example, for the root خ رج: 

xrj, we can apply different patterns which give 

different lemmas with different meanings:  

Root1: xrj/خ رج/ C1C2C3+ verbal pattern1: 

AistaC1oC2a3 =lemma1  َاْستَْخَرج/ to extract  

Root1: xrj/خ رج/C1C2C3+ verbal pattern2 FoEaL 

(FaEal)=lemma2   ََخَرج / to go out . 

Root1: xrj (خ رج)/C1C2C3+ verbal pattern3 

>aC1oC2aC3=lemma3  َأَْخَرج / to eject 

 3-Lemma: The lemma is a fundamental concept 

in the processing of texts in at least some 

languages. An Arabic word can be analyzed as a 

root inserted into a pattern.   

4.1 Verbal concepts for the Tunisian dialect  

As we aim to adapt MSA tools to TD, we 

tried to build for TD verbs the same concepts as 

those in MSA. Therefore, we focused in this 

work on the study of correspondences that may 

exist among the concepts of MSA verbs and 

dialect verbs. First, we extracted all the verbs 

that exist in ATB, represented in their inflected 

forms. Second, we used a lemmatizer to extract 

lemmas; we obtained as a result 1500 different 

MSA lemmas. Third, we built manually lemmas 

corresponding to TD. Later, we tried to build 

verbal patterns equivalent to those in MSA. 

Finally, since there is no standard definition of 

roots in TD, we opted for a deductive method to 

define root for dialect verbs. Figure 2 illustrates 

this method. 

 
 

               Figure 2: From ATB verb to TD-verb 

 

Building TD-lemmas: Verbs in the ATB corpus 

are presented in their inflected forms. So, we 

extracted lemmas and their roots using the 

morphological analyzer developed by Elexir FM 

(Smrz, 2007). As we are native speakers of TD, 

we associated to each MSA-Lemma a TUN-

Lemma. As a result, we found that 60% of the 

verbs change totally when passing from MSA to 

TD. This is a preliminary step for building 

Tunisian patterns from which we will be able to 

deduct the inflectional forms. So, as we have 

1500 TD-Lemmas, and starting from the fact that 

MSA verbs have patterns describing their 

morphological behavior during conjugation, we 

tried, whenever possible, to define to each TD-

Lemma a TD-Pattern which is similar to the 

MSA-pattern. 

Building TD-patterns: The challenge in 

building TD-patterns was to find patterns similar 

to those in MSA. In MSA, patterns are models 

with different structures that are applied to the 

root to create a lemma.  In fact, for trilateral roots 

there are in MSA ten patterns I: CCC, II: 

CaC~aC, III: CACaC, IV: >aCCaC, V: 

/taCaC~aC, VI: taCACaC,VII:AinCaCaC, 

VIII:AiCtaCaC, IX :  AiCCaC~, X: AistaCCaC. 

 To classify the lemmas that we have already 

built, we focused on the creation of verbal 

patterns for TD verbs. So, we chose three criteria 

that classify verbs from general (without 

considering the vowels of the word) to specific 

(dealing with the different variations of vowels 

in its conjugation). 

 

Classification according to the verb model 

Verb model means the form that the root takes 

after applying the Pattern, for example: 

Root : رج خ  /xrj ;  Pattern: CaCaC; Lemma :  ََخَرج/ 

xaraj ;  Model : CVCVC 

422



Root : ج ر خ  /xrj ;  Pattern: AistaCCaC ; Lemma: 

 Aistaxraj ;  Model : AistaCVCVC/اْستَْخَرج

Classification according to the model of the verb 

consists in studying similarities between verb 

models without considering changes in vowels. 

Indeed, as we have already mentioned, we have 

40% of verbs that do not change their root when 

the pass from MSA to TD. They therefore have 

the same model without considering vowels. To 

do this, we assigned to TD-verbs patterns 

equivalent to those in MSA (1). 

For example:  MSA-lemma:   ََخَرج / xaraj/go out      

Pattern-MSA: CaCaC   Model: CVCVC 

   TD: lemma: xoraj     Model: CVCVC  then   

Pattern-TUN: CoCaC 

Moreover, for verbs that change their root when 

passing to the dialect, we reasoned as follows: 

For a TD verb whose model looks like the model 

of a TD-verb for which we have already assigned 

a Tun-pattern (1), we assign the same Tun-

pattern (2). 

Example1: 

MSA: َصَمت /Samat /be silent  TD:  ْسُكت  /sokut  

Model : CVCVC  looks like the model of  ْخَرج / 

xraj/: go out  : CVCVC. (1) 

We have already assigned to  َْرجخ / xoraj the -

TUN-pattern: CoCaC. Therefore,  ُْكتس / sokut will 

have the pattern -TUN: CoCuC (2).   

In this way, we classified almost all TD verbs 

except a few who have a complex form 

illustrated by a verbal unit plus another lexical 

unit (particle or other...). 

For example, the translation of the MSA verb 

قَ رافَ  /rAfaqa/go with   is in TD: مع-ْمَشى /mo$aY-

moEa. We  associated this type of verb to 

patterns that we called "exception patterns" 

Classification according to the vowel of the 

second consonant of the pattern 

The vowel of the second consonant of the pattern 

(vowel letter ع / E) is a fundamental criterion for 

classifying a verb in MSA (Ouerhani, 2009). In 

fact, according to this criterion, the MSA pattern 

I is divided into six patterns due to the variation 

of the vowel of the second consonant (both in 

past and present tense). These patterns are 

respectively: I-au: CaCa-yaCoCuC ; I-ai : 

CaCaC-yaCiC ; 

I-aa: CaCaC-yaCoCaC, I-ia: CaCiC-yaCoCaC ; 

I-uu: CaCuC-yaCoCuC ;  I-ii: CaCiC-yaCaCiC. 

 

In TD, this variation is very common and it is 

marked not only in the pattern I but in all 

patterns. For this reason, we proposed to divide 

these patterns and to define new patterns in order 

to consolidate the verbs that have the same 

behavior. For example, for the Pattern-TUN II:  

MSA:  Pattern-TUN II: no TD sub-pattern: New 

three sub-patterns: II-aa: CaC~aC/yiCaC~aC ; II-

ai: CaC~aC /yiCaC~iC ; TUN II-ii: CaC~iC 

/yiCaC~iC 

 

Classification according to the Imperfect mark  

The third classification criterion is based on the 

imperfect mark. In MSA, this mark remains 

unchanged in all verbs belonging to the same 

class. In fact, for the MSA pattern I 

CaCaL/yaCCAC, the mark is ي/ya ; for example: 

َكتَب   kataba-yaktubu/write. For the pattern/يَكتُبُ -

III/CACaC/yuCACiC, the mark is   ُي/yu; for 

example يُشاِركُ -شاَرك/$Araka-

yu$Ariqu/participate.  

However, we noticed that in TD, this regularity 

appears especially in the pattern I, so this mark 

can vary even within the same class. For 

example,  يخرج -خرج  / xraj-yuxruj/to go out 

belongs to theTUN –pattern-I-au;  يقول -قال  / QAl-

yiquwl/to say belongs to the TUN-pattern-I-au. 

Note that although these two verbs belong to the 

same class, their imperfect marks are different. 

For this reason, we proposed to extend the TUN- 

pattern-I-au and define more sub-patterns for the 

pattern I.  

In this way, we assigned to  يخرج -خرج  / xraj-

yuxruj the pattern- I -au-u and to  يقول -قال  / QAl-

yiquwl the pattern- I -au-i. 

The result of this classification has allowed 

distinguishing 32 patterns for dialect verbs while 

there were 15 in MSA. 

-TD-root definition 

In Tunisian dialect, there is no standard 

definition for the root. For this reason, dialect 

root construction was not obvious, especially 

when the verb root changes completely from the 

MSA to the dialect. In fact, to define a root for 

TUN verbs, we adopted a deductive method. 

Indeed, in MSA, the rule says: root + pattern 

=Lemma (1). In our case, we have already 

defined the TUN-lemma and the Tun-pattern. 

Following rule (1), the extraction of the root is 

then made easy. For example, we classified the 

lemma إستنى / Aistan ~ aY / Wait in the pattern 

AistaCCaC then root(?) + AistaCCaC= Aistan~ 

Y 

Following (1), the root is "نني" [NNY]. In fact, 

we can say that the definition of roots is a 

problematic issue which could allow more 

discussion. According to (1), it was as if we had 

forced the roots to be [NNY]. However, if we 

423



classify إستنى / Aistann ~ aY under the pattern 

AiCtaCaC, the root in this case must be سنن / snn. 

The root can also be quadrilateral سنني / snnY if 

we classify Aistann ~ aY under the pattern 

AiCCaCaC. But as there's no standard, we did 

our best to be as logical as possible to define 

dialectal root. 

 

4.2 Verbal lexicon structure  

The various verbal transformations described 

above are modeled and stored in a dictionary of 

verbs as follows: to each MSA verbal block 

containing the MSA-lemma, the MSA-pattern 

and the MSA-root will correspond a TD- block 

which contains the TD-lemma, the TD-root- and 

the TD-pattern. So, knowing the pattern and the 

root, we will able to generate automatically 

various inflected forms of the TUN verbs. That’s 

why we also stored in our dictionary the active 

and the passive form of the TD-lemma in 

perfective and imperfective tenses. We also 

stored the inflected forms in the imperative (CV).  

Figure 3 shows the structure that we have 

defined for the dictionary to present the TD-

verbal concepts (in Section 4, we will explain 

how we will automate the enrichment of this 

dictionary).

Figure3- Verbal dictionary structure 

5 Mapping rules based on syntactic 
distinction 

We identified three areas that reflect the specific 

syntax of the dialect: word order, grammatical 

negation and syntactic tools categories. In the 

following section, we will explain how we define 

these dialect structures in our lexicon. 

5.1 Word order 

 The order of the elements in the dialect sentence 

seems to be relatively less important than in 

other languages . However, the canonical word 

order in Tunisian verbal sentences is SVO 

(Subject-Verb-Object) (Baccouche, 2003). 

In contrast, the MSA word order can have the 

following three forms: SVO / VSO / VOS (2). 

(1) TD:       «  ْالْطفُْل ْكتِْب الَدْرس ».SVO 

 (2) MSA:    « كتب الطفل الدرس ».VSO. 

This opposition between MSA and the dialect is 

clearer in the case of proper names. In fact, MSA 

order is VSO (3) while the order in TD is SVO.  

(Mahfoudhi, 2002) 

(3) MSA :    « ضرب موسى عيسى ». 
(4) TD :       « ىموسى ْضَرْب عيس  ». 

There are other types of simple dialect sentences 

named nominal sentences which do not contain a 

verb. They have the same order in both TD and 

MSA. For example:  

MSA: الطقس حار/TaKs HAr/ The weather is hot 

 TD:  ْالطَقْْس ْسُخون /TaKs sxuwn/The weather is hot 

In our work, we discussed some nominal groups 

at the syntactic level. The word order is generally 

reversed when passing to TD. For example  

(1) MSA:   ADV + ADJ   

   muvaK~af/also/ ْمثَقَّف+ayDaA/Also< أيضا

educated 

 TD: ADJ +ADV  

ADJ/ ْمثَقَّف   +ADV/ زاده   

(2) MSA: Noun + ADJ  

MSA:  <-kutubun kavira/many books/ ُكتُب َكثِيرة 

 TD: ADJ + Noun 

TD: برشا كتُب /bar$A ktub 

In the dictionary, we present this kind of rule as 

shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4- Syntactic rule representation in the 

dictionary  

5.2 Grammatical negation 

Negation particles are generally set before the 

verb and can sometimes change the combination. 

For example, if the word أكتب> />ktb /Write in 

MSA is preceded by a negative particle such as 

 :lam (Do not), the verb in the dialect will be/لم

mAktibti$/ماكتبتش=

5.3 Syntactic tool categories 

Tools words or Syntactic tools exist in a large 

amount in the Treebank and all MSA-texts. 

However, their transformation was not trivial and 

required for each tool a study of its different 

contexts.  

A tool word may have different translations 

depending on its context. For example, the 

particle َحتَّى/ HatY/so that:  we found this particle 

in ATB in three contexts. This particle gives a 

new translation whenever it changes context: 

 + (TUN-particle) باش = HatY + verb /َحتَّى -1

TUN_verb 

 (TUN-particle) باش = HatY + NEG_PART /َحتَّى 2

+    TUN_NEG_PART 

      otherwise 

3- َحتَّى   /HatY = َحتَّى   /HatY  

 So, to deal with these transformations, we 

converted them into rules and stored them into a 

lexicon of tool word transformation. 

 

Context dependent transformation  

We mean by context dependent transformation 

the passage MSA-TD which is based on 

transformation rules. Indeed, given the word 

MK, we say that the transformation of MK is 

based on context if it gives a new translation 

whenever it changes context. RTK : X + M + Y 

= TDk 

X = ∑
j=1

m

Mj : POSj ; Y = ∑
i=1

n

Mi : POSi ; k 

varies from 1 to z ;                         

RTk: transformation rules n°k; POS : Part of 

speech ; M: word tool, TDk: Translation n°k 

The transformation of a tool word may depend 

on the words (X) that precede it, or on the 

following word (Y), or both. If none of the 

contexts is presented, then a default translation 

will be assigned to the tool word. In total, we 

defined in the tool words dictionary 316 rules for 

the 146 ATB's tool words.  

In the dictionary, we presented a transformation 

rule. In fact, for each tool word we  defined a set 

of contexts; each context contains one or more 

configurations. The configuration describes the 

position and the part of speech of the words of 

context. Each context corresponds to a new 

translation of the tool word (Figure 5).

Context independent transformation  

In addition to the context-dependent 

transformations, the translation of some tool 

words in the corpus was direct "word to word"; 

the word remained the same regardless of the 

context. Figure 6 shows an example of how we 

represented this kind of translation in the 

dictionary

6 Automatic generation of Tunisian 
Dialect corpora 

To test and improve the developed bilingual 

models, we exploited our dictionaries to 

425



automate the task of converting MSA corpora to 

corpora with a dialect appearance.  

For this purpose, we developed a tool called 

Tunisian Dialect Translator (TDT) which enables 

to produce TD texts and to enrich the MSA-TD 

dictionary (Figure 6). The TDT tool works 

according to the following steps: 

1-Morphosyntactic annotation of MSA texts: 

TDT annotates each MSA text morpho-

syntactically by using the MADA analyzer 

(Morphological Analyser and disambiguisator of 

Arabic) (Habash, 2010).  MADA is a toolkit 

which, given a raw MSA text, adds lexical and 

morphological information. It disambiguisates in 

one operation part-of-speech tags, lexemes, 

diacritizations and full morphological analyses. 

2-Exploiting MSA-TD dictionaries: Based on 

each part of speech of the MSA-word, TDT 

proposes for each MSA structure the 

corresponding TD translation by exploiting the 

MSA-TD dictionaries.  

3-Enriching the lexicon:  As our MSA-TD 

dictionaries do not cover all Arabic words, texts 

resulting from the previous step are not totally 

translated. Therefore, in order to improve the 

quality of translation and to enrich our 

dictionaries, enabling them to be well used even 

in other NLP applications, we added to TDT a 

semi-automatic enrichment module. This module 

filters first all MSA words for which a translation 

has not been provided. Then, TDT assigns to 

them their corresponding MSA-lemmas and 

POS. If the POS is a verb or a noun, the user 

proposes a TD-root and a TD-pattern (described 

in subsection 3.2) and the TDT generates 

automatically the appropriate Tunisian lemma 

and its inflected forms.

Tunisian corpora 

7 Evaluation  

To evaluate translations of verbs occurring in 

our MSA-TD dictionary, we asked 47 judges 

(native speakers) to translate for us a sample 

containing 10% of verbs extracted from the 

dictionary. In this sample, there are 52 verbs that 

don’t change their root when passing to TD and 

98 do otherwise.  The evaluation consists in 

comparing what we have proposed as a 

translation of lexical items taken from the ATB 

with the proposals of judges who are native 

speakers of the Tunisian dialect. The percentage 

of agreement between the judges’ translations 

and the translations proposed in our lexicon is 

calculated. Table 1 shows the results obtained 

Table 1- Evaluation of verb translation 

 

Moreover, as the translation of the majority of 

tool words depends on context, we asked 5 

judges to translate 89 sentences containing 133 

tool words. In this sample, we repeated some tool 

words in the same sentence but in a different 

context. Table (2) gives the percentages of 

agreement between the translations of the judges 

and those in our dictionaries of tools words. The 

variation in percentage is due to the fact that for 

some words, the judges do not agree among 

themselves. The table shows also the percentage 

of disagreement between the judges and the 

dictionaries.

Table 2- Evaluation of tool word translation 

 

In fact, disagreement arises when no judge gives 

a translation similar to the translation proposed 

in the dictionaries. But, by increasing the number 

of judges, the disagreement decreases, which 

proves that our dictionaries contain translations 

accepted by several judges 

8 Conclusion 

This paper presented an effort to create resources 

and translation tools for the Tunisian dialect. 

To deal with the total lack of written resources in 

the Tunisian dialect, we described first a method 

that allowed the creation of bilingual dictionaries 

with in tandem TD-ATB. In fact, TD-ATB will 

serve as a source of insight on the phenomena 

that need to be addressed and as corpora to train 

TD-NLP tools. The verb dictionaries and the 

verbal concepts that we have developed were 

also exploited in order to adapt MAGEAD

and Generator of Arabic Dialect) to the Tunisian 

dialect (Hamdi et al., 2013). 

 We focused second on describing TDT, a tool 

used to generate automatically TD corpora and to 

enrich semi-automatically the dictionaries we 

have built. 

 We plan to continue working on improving the 

TD-resources by studying the transformation of 

nouns. We also plan to validate our approach by 

measuring the ability of a language model, built 

on a corpus translated by our TDT tool, to model 

transcriptions of Tunisian broadcast news.  

Experiments in progress show that the 

integration of translated data improves lexical 

coverage and the perplexity of language models 

significantly.
