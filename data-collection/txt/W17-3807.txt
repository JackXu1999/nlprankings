Abstract 

The mediocrity of sentences generated by 

online translators (Jacqueline, 1998; Hutchins, 

2001) prompts us to try to find a solution to 

have more reliable translations. This is a very 

difficult task due to the ambiguity of natural 

languages and especially the deficiencies of 

translation systems in terms of syntactic and 

semantic knowledge. How can we make 

automatic translation more reliable and 

unambiguous? Our main objective will be to 

generate a text where the translation of French 

verbs into Arabic will be without ambiguities. 

In this contribution, we attempt to formalize a 

particular class of verbs, namely the so-called 

verbs of speech. We shall limit ourselves to the 

treatment of the verb accuser ‘to accuse’ as 

presented in the Dubois & Dubois-Charlier 

(1997) electronic dictionary, Les verbes 

français. We shall take this verb as a prototype 

to show how NooJ can perform a reliable 

machine translation and generate a good text 

without ambiguities.  

1 Introduction 

The process of creating translation machines, 

capable of properly translating verbs, takes place in 

two stages: a theoretical stage and an application 

stage. The first phase allows analyzing and 

interpreting the phenomena studied which is then 

developed in the second phase whose role is to 

produce an automatic translation. In this 

contribution, we will try to automatically treat a 

class of verbs, namely the so-called verbs of speech. 

To do this we have adopted the NooJ platform for 

the syntactic description of the French verb accuser 

‘to accuse’ as an example of speech verbs. Our two 

main objectives, which are in the realm of applied 

linguistics, include:  

 The production of a system of analysis and 
recognition of the syntactic patterns of the verb 

accuser according to the classification of 

French verbs. 

 An adequate and reliable machine translation 
and the generation of sentences into Arabic. 

 Our work will therefore be divided into four parts: 

Derivational and inflectional formalization; 

Syntactic formalization; 

Implementation of the verb accuser in NooJ for 

machine translation; 

Automatic translation and generation of sentences in 

Arabic. 

2 Derivational and inflectional 
formalization 

The NooJ software has its own tools for automatic 

verb analysis and processing (Silberztein, 2003), so 

we need to formalize the linguistic data, in order that 

the program can automatically analyze and process 

the verb accuser in all of its various shades of 

meaning in our corpus, and then accurately translate 

them. 

We will therefore create the necessary paradigms 

to link each derivative or verb conjugated to its 

infinitive form. 

2.1 Creation of derivational paradigms  

We have chosen our verb example from Dubois & 

Dubois-Charlier’s (1997) electronic dictionary, Les 

verbes français (LVF). This work presents 

derivational codes which can be adjectival, such as 



 
 
 
 

44 

 

 

in –able and –ant, or nominal derivations, as in -age, 

–ment, –ion, –eur, and –ure. 

The verb accuser in the LVF has only one 

nominal derivative: accusateur ‘accuser’, we have 

created in NooJ its paradigm that we called  

N1 = accuser<B2> ateur / N. 

The LVF dictionary clearly indicated the different 

derivatives for each verb, but their inflections were 

not mentioned in the feminine nor in the plural, so 

we had to create these inflectional paradigms so that 

NooJ could recognize the inflected derivative forms: 

accusateur = <E> / m + s | s / m + p | <B3> rice / f 

s + | <B3> rices / f + p. 

2.2 Creation of inflectional paradigms 

NooJ will automatically be able to recognize the 

conjugated forms of a verb only when describing the 

conjugation models indicated in LVF with the NooJ 

inflectional operators. For that, Max Silberztein1 

matched the conjugation codes of NooJ. 

Example: the verb aimer ‘to love’ is inflected as:  

Aimer = <E>/INF | <B2>ant/G |   

<B2>é/PP+m+s | <B2>ée/PP+f+s    | 

<B2>és/PP+m+p | <B2>ées/PP+f+p | 

<B>/IP+s+2 | <B2>ons/IP+p+1 | 

<B>z/IP+p+2 | <B>/PR+s+1   | 

<B>s/PR+s+2 | <B>/PR+s+3 | 

<B2>ons/PR+p+1 | <B>z/PR+p+2 | 

<B>nt/PR+p+3 | <B>/S+s+1 | 

<B>s/S+s+2 | <B>/S+s+3 | 

<B2>ions/S+p+1 | <B2>iez/S+p+2 | 

<B>nt/S+p+3 | ais/C+s+1 | 

ais/C+s+2 | ait/C+s+3 | 

ions/C+p+1 | iez/C+p+2 | 

aient/C+p+3. 

For this inflectional paradigm of the verb aimer 

all the tenses, and moods have been described with 

all the personal pronouns using NooJ operators and 

thanks to this model we can conjugate a large 

number of verbs, such as accuser our example verb. 

NooJ can now recognize all the conjugated 

occurrences of the verb accuser in our corpus, 

lemmatize them and link them to the list of the 

various uses.

3 Syntactic formalization  

In this phase, we describe the syntactic schemas, 

which are written in the form of codes, replace the 

codes with the verb and its arguments, and assign 

them semantic features based on their syntactic 

schemas. Syntactic schemas are defined by the 

nature of the constituents of the sentence, their 

properties and their relations, and by the words of 

the lexicon which enter into the various types of 

constituents. 

a. Accuser direct transitive verb 

 [T11b0] CONS = T11b0 + N0VN1PREPN2 + 

N0Hum + V + N1Hum + N2Abst + N2Vinf + 

PREP = « de » 

Ex: La mère accuse son enfant d’avoir oublié 

ses devoirs. ‘The mother reproaches her child 

for having forgotten her homework’. 

 [T1907] CONS = N0VN1 Nhum + VT + 
N1Hum N1Abst+ N1Conc 

Ex: On accuse le sort. ‘We accuse fate’. 

b. Accuser pronominal verb 

 [P10B0] CONS = N0seVPREPN1 + N0Hum + 
VP + N1Hum + N1Abst + N1Vinf + PREP 

=“de” 

Ex: L’enfant s’accuse d’avoir menti ‘The child 

reproaches himself for having lied’. 

After this phase of derivational, inflectional and 

syntactic formalization of the verb accuser with 

NooJ operators, we proceed to the implementation 

of these formal data within NooJ. 

4 Implementation of the verb accuser in 
NooJ for automatic translation 

In this phase of formalization we show how to 

integrate the verbal input accuser in NooJ for 

automatic translation. For this, we created a 

bilingual French Arabic dictionary and formal 

grammars for the different constructions of the verb 

accuser.

4.1 Creation of a bilingual Arabic dictionary 

This phase of implementation of the verb in a 

bilingual French-Arabic dictionary aims first of all 

to reformulate the information of the LVF in terms 

of NooJ operators. This operation consists of 

applying the dictionary to automatically translate the 

text into Arabic. We added the Arabic translation to 

each verb and all the other words in order to generate 

sentences into Arabic without ambiguities. 

In this phase, we reformulate the information of 

the LVF in connection with the verb accuser and 

apply this dictionary to the French-Arabic machine 

translation (Figure 1).

4.2 The creation of formal grammars for the 
different constructions of the verb accuser 

 For a reliable automatic translation of sentences 

containing the verb accuser, we tried to create for-

mal grammars (Figure 2 for T11b0 and P10b0 con-

structions; Figure 3 for T1907 construct) to remove 

the ambiguities of the various syntactic 

constructions. 

 

 
Figure 2: The formal grammars of the constructions T11b0 

and P10b0. 

 

 
Figure 3: The formal grammars of the construction T1907 

Boons et al. (1976) claim that the meaning of the 

verb is related to the type of subject and the 

complement (human, concrete, non-animated, etc.); 

we created formal grammars that take into 

consideration the type of the object and the type of 

the complement. The verb accuser has three 

different syntactic constructs: T11b0 / T1907 / 

P10b0, all have a human subject with a different 

complement: 

 [T11b0] N0VN1PREPN2 + N0Hum + VT + 
N1Hum + N2Abst + N2Vinf + PREP = “de” 

Ex: La mère accuse son enfant de courir. ‘The 

mother accuses her child of running’. 

 [P10B0] = N0seVPREPN1 + N0Hum + VP + 

N1Hum + N1Abst + N1Vinf + PREP =“de” 

Ex: On s’accuse d’avoir menti. ‘One 

reproaches oneself for having lied’. 

 [T1907] = N0VN1 NHum + VT +N1Hum 
N1Abst + N1Conc 

Ex: Le juge accuse le criminel. ‘The judge 

accuses the criminal’. 

For the development of a formal grammar capable 

of correctly recognizing and translating the 

sentences which contain the verb accuser, we have 

to add other electronic dictionary resources and 

dictionaries for the detection of lexical units. We 

used the electronic dictionaries already integrated 

into the NooJ platform, such as: 
 



 
 
 
 

46 

 

 

 

Figure 4: Extraction from the corpus Le Monde and translation of the verb accuser into Arabic 

 The delaf.nod which contains all the inflected 
forms of the single words corresponding to the 

lexical entries of the DELAS (Silberztein 

1993); 

 Le DM dictionary of French words (Trouilleux, 
2011). This linguistic resource is integrated 

into the NooJ platform and itcontains 67,997 

entries composed of determiners, pronouns, 

prepositions, conjunctions, numerals, adverbs, 

nouns, interjections, adjectives and verbs. 

The grammar we have constructed must know all 

possible constructions without any ambiguity. For 

this reason, we chose to create for each syntactic 

construct its path independently of the other 

constructions to remove all the ambiguities using the 

precise semantic traits (concrete, abstract, human 

etc.) of each argument. 

5 Automatic translation and generation of 
verbal predicates into Arabic 

The automatic translation process is applied to the 

communication predicates obtained after the 

analysis and recognition phases. 

We have already tried to implement our process 

of analysis and recognition of syntactic patterns on 

a newspaper corpus of Le Monde. We obtained 

results where the patterns and verbs found are 

disambiguated and annotated simply by the appro-

priate syntactic constructions (Figure 4). 

We can see that the formal grammars allowed us 

not only to automatically recognize the different 

constructions, but also to translate the verb 

automatically into Arabic. However, our system not 

only allows us to translate a single verb but also the 

entire sentence. 

Therefore, we added the grammars of translation 

($v$AR) to each formal grammar. And we obtained 

the translation into Arabic of the different sentences 

that contain the verb accuser in its various 

constructions: 

 Translation of accuser+T11b0+AR= الم 
(Lᾱma) ‘To reproach’ 

Ex: La mère accuse son enfant de courir. 

 م تلوم ابنها على الركضاأل  

 Translation of accuser+P10b0+AR = الم 
(Lᾱma) 

Ex: On s’accuse de mentir. 

  نفسنا على الكذبأنلوم  

 Translation of accuser+T1907+AR= نادأ 

(adᾱna) ‘to accuse’ 

Ex: Le juge accuse le criminel. 

 المجرم  أدان  القاضي  

Our system has succeeded in automatically 

translating the sentences into Arabic taking into 

account the meaning of the verb which varies 

according to the construction.

The software has thus made it possible to generate 

sentences naturally into Arabic without syntactic 

and semantic ambiguities. 

  The naturalness of the generated text is due to an 

automatic semantic syntactic analysis of open 

corpus, based on a broad description of the 

vocabulary. Our example adds to the examples of 

Silberztein (2015, 2016) to confirm that NooJ brings 

a significant qualitative leap for text generation. 

6 Conclusion 

We tried in this contribution to formalize the verb 

accuser as an example of verbs of speech, and to 

integrate it into the NooJ software. Thanks to the 

linguistic richness of the LVF verbal entries which 

helps the computer tools make a syntactic, semantic 

and morphological analysis of the verbs, we 

succeeded in automatically recognizing, extracting, 

and processing cases of accuser in a corpus of 

considerable size, the newspaper Le Monde. 

This formalization was needed in order to obtain 

a reliable automatic translation. Thus, we created 

formal grammars to remove the ambiguity of the 

syntactic construct, since the meaning of the verb 

depends on the type of subject and the complement 

(human, concrete, abstract, etc.). 

These grammars have led to the automatic 

recognition of syntactic constructions, which in turn 

removes ambiguities and generates sentences into 

Arabic taking into account the meaning of the verb 

in its original French context.
