Abstract

The goal of this paper is to conduct an
acoustic phonetic investigation of both pri-
mary and secondary cues that aid in the dis-
tinction between voiced and voiceless gem-
inates in Bangla. Results of the statistical
analyses examining both duration and non-
durational correlates show that besides clo-
sure duration secondary cues such as the am-
plitude of the stop release burst and the fun-
damental frequencies of the vowels immedi-
ately preceding and following the obstruent
are acoustically significant in the distinction
between voiced and voiceless geminates and
singletons. Voiced stops have significantly
greater burst amplitudes than voiceless ones,
and geminates are flanked by vowels with sig-
nificantly higher F0’s than those flanking cor-
responding singletons.

We also briefly explore the effects of gemi-
nation on V-to-V coarticulation. The assump-
tion is that longer consonantal duration will
act as a more effective barrier to V-to-V coar-
ticulation in the case of geminates as opposed
to singletons. Particularly, in the case of
dental geminates, we hypothesize that longer
consonantal duration contributes to lingual
fronting, which manifests itself as greater re-
sistance to V-to-V coarticulation.

1 Introduction

Maintaining voicing in obstruents is articulatorily
challenging. Sufficient transglottal air pressure drop
is required to maintain voicing. This becomes harder
for obstruents, which require rapid increase in intrao-
ral air pressure. The difficulty increases in geminate
obstruents as they have longer closure. (Ohala, 1983)
Hence, crosslinguistically, voiced geminates are rarer
than their voiceless counterparts (Hayes and Steri-
ade, 2004). Bangla, an Eastern Indo-Aryan language
spoken in Bangladesh and the Indian states of West
Bengal, Tripura and Assam, and the fifth most spo-
ken language in the world1 with nearly 300 million

1https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali language

speakers is one of the few languages which have both
voiced and voiceless geminates in their inventory.

Work on gemination in Bangla has been sparse.
The only existing study on Bangla geminates focuses
on voiceless stops and does not take voiced geminates
into account (Lahiri and Hankamer, 1988; Hankamer
et al., 1989). This paper aims to fill that gap by tak-
ing voiced geminates and the effects they might have
on acoustic cues into consideration. It also takes a
look at how vowel to vowel coarticulation might be
affected because of gemination, especially in the case
of dental stops. The articulatory motivation is that
there should be some lingual fronting in the case of
dental geminates, in order to maintain air pressure for
a longer duration, and this fronting should then pose
higher resistance to V-to-V coarticulation.

The rest of the paper is organised as follows: In
Section 2, we cover a brief overview of work done
on geminates and outline the aims and motivations of
the current study. Section 3 presents the materials and
methods used for the study, while Section 4 discusses
the parameters measured in the study. Section 5 elu-
cidates the statistical analysis employed for drawing
inferences from the data. Section 6 deals with the F2
locus equations fitted for investigating the variation
of the degree of coarticulatory resistance. Section 7
collates the results, and Section 8 concludes the work
with a discussion on the inferences drawn from anal-
ysis and explores issues that need further work.

2 Related work

Lahiri and Hankamer (1988) investigated various
acoustic cues and their perceptual relevance on the
distinction between geminates and non-geminates in
Bangla and Turkish. Their study, which focused only
on voiceless stops, confirmed that closure duration
was a perceptually salient cue for distinguishing be-
tween geminates and singletons in Bangla and Turk-
ish, but discounted the fact that V1 duration was a sec-
ondary cue that could be used to identify geminates.
In a subsequent paper (Hankamer et al., 1989), they
concurred that secondary cues do contribute informa-
tion about the distinction between geminates and sin-
gletons when the primary cues are ambiguous. How-
ever, they never explicitly stated exactly what these

413



secondary acoustic cues might be, proposing instead
that the set of secondary features that biased subjects
when the primary cue of consonant duration was am-
biguous, was possibly due to a combination of cues,
each by itself too subtle for their measurements to de-
tect.

The cues that have been found to be consistently
significant in the geminate-singleton distinction in-
clude stop closure duration and the length of the pre-
ceding vowel (V1 duration). Geminates have been
found to have longer stop closure duration and shorter
V1 duration (Esposito and Di Benedetto, 1999;
Stevens and Hajek, 2004). Shortening of V2 dura-
tion in the case of geminates has also been observed.
However, it has not been significantly different from
that of singletons (Esposito and Di Benedetto, 1999).

Voicing has also been observed to have an effect on
stop closure duration in obstruents. Stevens and Ha-
jek (2004) found voiceless geminates to be substan-
tially longer than voiced ones in Sienese Italian.

Studies of word-initial voiceless geminates in lan-
guages like Pattani Malay (Abramson, 1986; Abram-
son, 1987; Abramson, 1992; Abramson, 1999) and
Kelantan Malay (Hamzah, 2013; Hamzah et al.,
2013; Hamzah et al., 2012) show that when listen-
ers do not have the advantage of relying on consonant
duration as an acoustic cue for gemination, they make
use of secondary cues which help in disambiguation.
In particular, amplitude and fundamental frequency
(Abramson, 1992; Abramson, 1999) were found to
be significant cues to word-initial consonant length.
Stevens and Hajek (2004) found that long voiced
stops are often partially devoiced. Moreover, he re-
vealed that in the case of Sienese Italian, voiceless
geminates were preaspirated and their voiced coun-
terparts were devoiced, so that the phonetic contrast
between voiced and voiceless stops no longer man-
ifested in a difference in the presence or absence of
closure voicing, but rather in the absence or presence
of aspiration before the geminated consonant.

F2 locus equations, which are a source of relational
invariance that determine place of articulation, are
also signifiers of the degree of coarticulatory resis-
tance for a given consonant. Fowler and Brancazio
(2000) showed that the more highly resistant a conso-
nant is, the lower its locus equation slope. High coar-
ticulation resistance, measured as a low standard de-
viation of F2 at the consonant normalized by variabil-
ity of F2 across vowels, directly leads to a low locus
equation slope. Low coarticulation resistance would,
by the same logic, directly lead to a locus equation
slope close to 1, since the variability of F2 measured
at consonant release would be nearly the variability
measured at the midpoint of the vowel.(Iskarous et
al., 2010)

Esposito and Di Benedetto (1999) observed that

V1 formant frequencies showed no relationship with
gemination, suggesting that this showed that no ex-
tra vocal effort was required for articulating gemi-
nates. They made no comment about formant tran-
sitions, however, or cast any light on the question of
the variance of coarticulatory resistance in the pres-
ence of geminates.

In a study of the effect of consonant duration on
V-to-V coarticulation in Japanese, Löfqvist (2009)
found no significant effect of consonant closure dura-
tion on the degree of vowel-to-vowel coarticulation.

The aim of this paper is to answer the following
questions:

• What are the major acoustic cues that set voiced
geminates apart from voiceless ones?

• Are the secondary cues employed by word-
medial geminates identical to those employed
by word-initial geminates (in languages that do
have them)?

• If voicing does indeed shorten the duration of
stop closure, and gemination leads to partial de-
voicing (Stevens and Hajek, 2004), how are
voiced geminates differentiated from voiceless
singletons?

• Does gemination affect V-to-V coarticulation?

3 Materials and methods

The Shruti corpus, a Bangla corpus of read speech,
built and maintained by Indian Institute Of Technol-
ogy, Kharagpur (IITKGP) was used as the source
of data for this study. The corpus consists of 7383
unique sentences. There are 34 speakers with ages
varying from 20 to 40 years. 26 of the speakers are
male, and 8 female. The speaker age in the corpus
varies from 20 to 40 yrs. 700 words containing gemi-
nate and singleton stop consonant sequences from the

414



Shruti corpus were hand annotated for word, place
and manner of articulation, consonant burst, and pre-
ceding and following vowels using Praat 2. Each an-
notation file had six tiers of information: the vowel
preceding the consonant, V1, the place of articula-
tion of the stop, POA, the manner of articulation of
the stop, MOA, the release burst, the following vowel,
V2 and the word in which the geminate/singletons se-
quence appears.

The distribution of the data is given in Table 1.

Singleton Geminate
Place of Articulation Voiced Voiceless Voiced Voiceless
Bilabial 32 20 44 10
Dental 44 149 36 165
Retroflex — 48 18 25
Velar 11 59 17 20

Table 1: Distribution of singleton and geminate to-
kens across places of articulation

There are no voiced retroflex singleton tokens be-
cause the voiced retroflex ã does not appear as a sin-
gleton word-medially in Bangla.

4 Measurements

The following parameters were examined:

• Consonant duration

• Duration of the preceding vowel (V1)

• Duration of the following vowel (V2)

• Duration of the stop release burst

• RMS amplitude of the stop release burst

• Fundamental frequency of the preceding vowel

• Fundemental frequency of the following vowel

These measurements were taken for both voiced
and voiceless geminates as well as voiced and voice-
less singletons corresponding to four places of articu-
lation: bilabial, dental, retroflex and velar.

5 Analysis

Three-way ANOVAs were done to test the signifi-
cance of place of articulation, voicing and gemina-
tion on the duration of stop closure and length of the
preceding and following vowels (V1 and V2). The
interaction effects of all three factors on each of the
parameters are given in Figures 2 and 3. In carrying
out all of the following tests, the probability of type I
error, α was fixed at 0.01 (1%).

A three-way ANOVA carried out on V2 duration
revealed that none of the factors appear to have any
effect whatsoever of the duration of the V2.

Two-way ANOVAs were carried out to test the
significance of voicing and gemination on duration
and amplitude of the stop release burst, as well
as the fundamental frequency (F0) of both the pre-
ceding and the following vowels. The effects of
gemination [F(1,817)=19.102, p<0.01] and voicing
[F(1,817)=71.13, p<0.0001] were found to be ex-
tremely significant contributors towards the variance
of burst duration.

It was also found that voicing [F(1,817)=93.661,
p< 0.0001] plays a very significant role in determin-
ing the burst amplitude.

The effect of gemination [F(1,817)=10.273,
p<0.01] was found to be significant on the variation
exhibited by F0 values of the preceding vowel.

For modelling the variation of the degree of coartic-
ulatory resistance of obstruents with gemination, lo-
cus equations of F2onset against F2mid of the vowel
following the obstruent were plotted for both sin-
gleton and geminate tokens. Due to the sparsity of
both inter and intra-speaker data, tokens from a sin-
gle speaker, “Chan”, was chosen for the study. The
preceding vowel was fixed as the high front vowel
/i/ and the obstruent was fixed as the voiceless dental
/t”/. 47 tokens were analysed, 18 of which were gem-
inates and the others singletons. The unequal sample
size is due to the fact that the data was taken from
pre-existing corpus, and was thus subject to corpus-
specific idiosyncrasies.

The second formant measures for the following
vowel (V2) were taken as described in the previous
chapter, with two measures for each formant - one
at the 5% mark of the vowel for F2onset and another
at the 50% mark of the vowel for F2mid. The val-
ues were plotted and a regression line fitted through

416



the data. The regression equation relating F2onset and
F2mid is given by:

F2onset = β + αF2mid

where α is the slope of the regression line, and β is
the intercept.

The fitted regression lines for singletons and gem-
inates (Figure 8) show no significant differences in
their slopes. This implies that, at least for the
given vocalic and consonantal environment, gemina-
tion does not affect the degree of coarticulation. How-
ever, more data from other speakers including dif-
ferent preceding vowels and obstruents is required to
draw stronger conclusions in this regard.

Table 2: The roles of fundamental frequency and
burst amplitude in the voiced-voiceless geminate-
singleton distinction

Voicing has a significant effect on consonant du-
ration, with both voiced singletons and voiced gem-
inates having significantly shorter closure durations
than their voiceless counterparts.

The duration of the preceding vowel is strongly af-
fected by gemination. Geminates have shorter V1
duration. V1 duration is significantly affected by
voicing as well — voiced obstruents are preceded by
longer vowels. V1 duration is also contingent on the
place of articulation, and displays interaction effects
of place of articulation with both voicing and gemi-
nation.

Both gemination and voicing affect the duration of
the stop release burst - burst duration is greater for
geminates. Burst amplitude is significantly affected
by voicing but not gemination — voiced stops have
greater burst amplitude.

Fundamental frequencies of both vowels are af-
fected by gemination. Vowels flanking geminates
have higher fundamental frequency than those flank-
ing singletons. Table 2 shows the variation of burst
amplitude and fundamental frequency of surrounding
vowels with voicing and gemination. Together, these
two cues help in disambiguating voiced and voiceless
singletons and geminates.

The F2 locus equations plotted for voiceless dental
geminates and singletons with V1 fixed as /i/ show
no appreciable difference in their slopes, indicating
that geminates do not, after all, affect V-to-V coartic-
ulation, at least as far as this particular vocalic and
consonantal context is concerned.

8 Conclusion and further work

The perceptual experiments on voiceless geminate
stops carried out by (Lahiri and Hankamer, 1988) and
(Hankamer et al., 1989) focused exclusively on dura-
tional correlates. The presence of secondary acoustic
cues, while acknowledged by them, were not credited
with enough perceptual significance other than serv-
ing to bias listeners only when the primary cue of stop
closure duration was ambiguous. However, the issue
of voicing, the consequent perturbation of closure du-
ration and its effects on the perception of geminates
was left unaddressed in their work.

The results of this study clearly show that burst
amplitude and fundamental frequency, both non-
durational correlates, are significant contributors to-
wards the distinction between voiced and voiceless
geminates. Burst amplitude serves to disambiguate
between voiced and voiceless stops, with the for-
mer having much greater burst amplitude than the
latter. Fundamental frequency, on the other hand,
is a key parameter in distinguishing geminates from
non-geminates - F0 of vowels surrounding geminate
consonants is consistently higher than for singletons.
Burst duration is also a significant indicator for both
gemination and voicing, with voiceless obstruents and
geminates having longer burst duration than voiced
stops and singletons respectively.

These results corroborate the findings of (Abram-
son, 1992; Abramson, 1999) and (Hamzah et al.,
2012; Hamzah et al., 2013) regarding word-initial
geminates in Pattani Malay and Kelantan Malay re-
spectively. Thus, we can safely conclude that ampli-
tude and F0 are powerful secondary cues that affect
both word-initial and word-medial geminates.

We can also conclude that despite voicing shorten-
ing the duration of stop closure, geminates and sin-
gletons are still distinguishable by the fundamental
frequencies of the surrounding vowels, which are sig-
nificantly higher in the case of geminates.

From the preliminary study of the locus equations
of the second formant of the following vowel, no dif-
ference was found between the slopes of the equations
for geminates and singletons, indicating that gemi-
nates do no affect V-to-V coarticulation appreciably,
at least as far as the voiceless dental /t”/ is concerned.
However,more data for other places of articulation
and different vocalic contexts is required in this re-
gard to draw a stronger conclusion.

One of the avenues of investigation that was left
unexplored in this study, and which definitely merits
further research, is a comparison of the degree of de-
voicing (a phenomenon noted in Sienese Italian and
Japanese by Stevens and Hajek (2004) and Kawahara
(2005) respectively) that occurs in voiced geminates
and singletons in Bangla.
