Abstract

In this paper, we study the problem of manu-
ally correcting automatic annotations of natu-
ral language in as efficient a manner as pos-
sible. We introduce a method for automati-
cally segmenting a corpus into chunks such
that many uncertain labels are grouped into
the same chunk, while human supervision
can be omitted altogether for other segments.
A tradeoff must be found for segment sizes.
Choosing short segments allows us to reduce
the number of highly confident labels that are
supervised by the annotator, which is useful
because these labels are often already correct
and supervising correct labels is a waste of
effort. In contrast, long segments reduce the
cognitive effort due to context switches. Our
method helps find the segmentation that opti-
mizes supervision efficiency by defining user
models to predict the cost and utility of su-
pervising each segment and solving a con-
strained optimization problem balancing these
contradictory objectives. A user study demon-
strates noticeable gains over pre-segmented,
confidence-ordered baselines on two natural
language processing tasks: speech transcrip-
tion and word segmentation.

1 Introduction

Many natural language processing (NLP) tasks re-
quire human supervision to be useful in practice,
be it to collect suitable training material or to meet
some desired output quality. Given the high cost of
human intervention, how to minimize the supervi-
sion effort is an important research problem. Previ-
ous works in areas such as active learning, post edit-

ing, and interactive pattern recognition have inves-
tigated this question with notable success (Settles,
2008; Specia, 2011; González-Rubio et al., 2010).

The most common framework for efficient anno-
tation in the NLP context consists of training an NLP
system on a small amount of baseline data, and then
running the system on unannotated data to estimate
confidence scores of the system’s predictions (Set-
tles, 2008). Sentences with the lowest confidence
are then used as the data to be annotated (Figure 1
(a)). However, it has been noted that when the NLP
system in question already has relatively high accu-
racy, annotating entire sentences can be wasteful, as
most words will already be correct (Tomanek and
Hahn, 2009; Neubig et al., 2011). In these cases, it
is possible to achieve much higher benefit per anno-
tated word by annotating sub-sentential units (Fig-
ure 1 (b)).

However, as Settles et al. (2008) point out, sim-
ply maximizing the benefit per annotated instance
is not enough, as the real supervision effort varies

greatly across instances. This is particularly impor-
tant in the context of choosing segments to annotate,
as human annotators heavily rely on semantics and
context information to process language, and intu-
itively, a consecutive sequence of words can be su-
pervised faster and more accurately than the same
number of words spread out over several locations in
a text. This intuition can also be seen in our empiri-
cal data in Figure 2, which shows that for the speech
transcription and word segmentation tasks described
later in Section 5, short segments had a longer anno-
tation time per word. Based on this fact, we argue
it would be desirable to present the annotator with
a segmentation of the data into easily supervisable
chunks that are both large enough to reduce the num-
ber of context switches, and small enough to prevent
unnecessary annotation (Figure 1 (c)).

In this paper, we introduce a new strategy for nat-
ural language supervision tasks that attempts to op-
timize supervision efficiency by choosing an appro-
priate segmentation. It relies on a user model that,
given a specific segment, predicts the cost and the
utility of supervising that segment. Given this user
model, the goal is to find a segmentation that mini-
mizes the total predicted cost while maximizing the
utility. We balance these two criteria by defining a
constrained optimization problem in which one cri-
terion is the optimization objective, while the other
criterion is used as a constraint. Doing so allows
specifying practical optimization goals such as “re-
move as many errors as possible given a limited time
budget,” or “annotate data to obtain some required
classifier accuracy in as little time as possible.”

Solving this optimization task is computationally

difficult, an NP-hard problem. Nevertheless, we
demonstrate that by making realistic assumptions
about the segment length, an optimal solution can
be found using an integer linear programming for-
mulation for mid-sized corpora, as are common for
supervised annotation tasks. For larger corpora, we
provide simple heuristics to obtain an approximate
solution in a reasonable amount of time.

Experiments over two example scenarios demon-
strate the usefulness of our method: Post editing
for speech transcription, and active learning for
Japanese word segmentation. Our model predicts
noticeable efficiency gains, which are confirmed in
experiments with human annotators.

2 Problem Definition

The goal of our method is to find a segmentation
over a corpus of word tokens wN1 that optimizes
supervision efficiency according to some predictive
user model. The user model is denoted as a set of
functions ul,k(wba) that evaluate any possible sub-
sequence wba of tokens in the corpus according to
criteria l2L, and supervision modes k2K.

Let us illustrate this with an example. Sperber et
al. (2013) defined a framework for speech transcrip-
tion in which an initial, erroneous transcript is cre-
ated using automatic speech recognition (ASR), and
an annotator corrects the transcript either by correct-
ing the words by keyboard, by respeaking the con-
tent, or by leaving the words as is. In this case,
we could define K={TYPE, RESPEAK, SKIP}, each
constant representing one of these three supervision
modes. Our method will automatically determine
the appropriate supervision mode for each segment.

The user model in this example might evaluate ev-
ery segment according to two criteria L, a cost crite-
rion (in terms of supervision time) and a utility cri-
terion (in terms of number of removed errors), when
using each mode. Intuitively, respeaking should be
assigned both lower cost (because speaking is faster
than typing), but also lower utility than typing on a
keyboard (because respeaking recognition errors can
occur). The SKIP mode denotes the special, unsuper-
vised mode that always returns 0 cost and 0 utility.

Other possible supervision modes include mul-
tiple input modalities (Suhm et al., 2001), several
human annotators with different expertise and cost

170



(Donmez and Carbonell, 2008), and correction vs.
translation from scratch in machine translation (Spe-
cia, 2011). Similarly, cost could instead be ex-
pressed in monetary terms, or the utility function
could predict the improvement of a classifier when
the resulting annotation is not intended for direct hu-
man consumption, but as training data for a classifier
in an active learning framework.

3 Optimization Framework

Given this setting, we are interested in simulta-
neously finding optimal locations and supervision
modes for all segments, according to the given cri-
teria. Each resulting segment will be assigned ex-
actly one of these supervision modes. We de-
note a segmentation of the N tokens of corpus wN1
into MN segments by specifying segment bound-
ary markers sM+11 =(s1=1, s2, . . . , sM+1=N+1).
Setting a boundary marker si=a means that we
put a segment boundary before the a-th word to-
ken (or the end-of-corpus marker for a=N+1).
Thus our corpus is segmented into token sequences
[(wsj , . . . , wsj+1�1)]

M
j=1. The supervision modes

assigned to each segment are denoted by mj . We
favor those segmentations that minimize the cumu-
lative value

PM
j=1[ul,mj (w

sj+1
sj )] for each criterion l.

For any criterion where larger values are intuitively
better, we flip the sign before defining ul,mj (w

sj+1
sj )

to maintain consistency (e.g. negative number of er-
rors removed).

3.1 Multiple Criteria Optimization

In the case of a single criterion (|L|=1), we obtain
a simple, single-objective unconstrained linear opti-
mization problem, efficiently solvable via dynamic
programming (Terzi and Tsaparas, 2006). However,
in practice one usually encounters several compet-
ing criteria, such as cost and utility, and here we
will focus on this more realistic setting. We balance
competing criteria by using one as an optimization
objective, and the others as constraints.1 Let crite-

1This approach is known as the bounded objective function
method in multi-objective optimization literature (Marler and
Arora, 2004). The very popular weighted sum method merges
criteria into a single efficiency measure, but is problematic in
our case because the number of supervised tokens is unspec-
ified. Unless the weights are carefully chosen, the algorithm
might find, e.g., the completely unsupervised or completely su-

This constrained optimization problem is difficult
to solve. In fact, the NP-hard multiple-choice knap-
sack problem (Pisinger, 1994) corresponds to a spe-
cial case of our problem in which the number of seg-
ments is equal to the number of tokens, implying
that our more general problem is NP-hard as well.

In order to overcome this problem, we refor-
mulate search for the optimal segmentation as a
resource-constrained shortest path problem in a di-
rected, acyclic multigraph. While still not efficiently
solvable in theory, this problem is well studied in
domains such as vehicle routing and crew schedul-
ing (Irnich and Desaulniers, 2005), and it is known
that in many practical situations the problem can
be solved reasonably efficiently using integer linear
programming relaxations (Toth and Vigo, 2001).

In our formalism, the set of nodes V represents
the spaces between neighboring tokens, at which the
algorithm may insert segment boundaries. A node
with index i represents a segment break before the
i-th token, and thus the sequence of the indices in
a path directly corresponds to sM+11 . Edges E de-
note the grouping of tokens between the respective

nodes into one segment. Edges are always directed
from left to right, and labeled with a supervision
mode. In addition, each edge between nodes i and j
is assigned ul,k(w

j�1
i ), the corresponding predicted

value for each criterion l 2 L and supervision mode
k 2 K, indicating that the supervision mode of the
j-th segment in a path directly corresponds to mj .

Figure 3 shows an example of what the result-
ing graph may look like. Our original optimization
problem is now equivalent to finding the shortest
path between the first and last nodes according to
criterion l0, while obeying the given resource con-
straints. According to a widely used formulation for
the resource constrained shortest path problem, we
can define Eij as the set of competing edges between
i and j, and express this optimization problem with
the following integer linear program (ILP):

The variables x={xijk|i, j 2 V , k 2 Eij} denote
the activation of the k’th edge between nodes i and
j. The shortest path according to the minimization
objective (1), that still meets the resource constraints
for the specified criteria (2), is to be computed. The
degree constraints (3,4,5) specify that all but the first
and last nodes must have as many incoming as out-
going edges, while the first node must have exactly
one outgoing, and the last node exactly one incom-
ing edge. Finally, the integrality condition (6) forces
all edges to be either fully activated or fully deacti-
vated. The outlined problem formulation can solved

directly by using off-the-shelf ILP solvers, here we
employ GUROBI (Gurobi Optimization, 2012).

3.2 Heuristics for Approximation

In general, edges are inserted for every supervision
mode between every combination of two nodes. The
search space can be constrained by removing some
of these edges to increase efficiency. In this study,
we only consider edges spanning at most 20 tokens.

For cases in which larger corpora are to be anno-
tated, or when the acceptable delay for delivering re-
sults is small, a suitable segmentation can be found
approximately. The easiest way would be to parti-
tion the corpus, e.g. according to its individual doc-
uments, divide the budget constraints evenly across
all partitions, and then segment each partition inde-
pendently. More sophisticated methods might ap-
proximate the Pareto front for each partition, and
distribute the budgets in an intelligent way.

4 User Modeling

While the proposed framework is able to optimize
the segmentation with respect to each criterion, it
also rests upon the assumption that we can provide
user models ul,k(w

j�1
i ) that accurately evaluate ev-

ery segment according to the specified criteria and
supervision modes. In this section, we discuss our
strategies for estimating three conceivable criteria:
annotation cost, correction of errors, and improve-
ment of a classifier.

4.1 Annotation Cost Modeling

Modeling cost requires solving a regression prob-
lem from features of a candidate segment to annota-
tion cost, for example in terms of supervision time.
Appropriate input features depend on the task, but
should include notions of complexity (e.g. a confi-
dence measure) and length of the segment, as both
are expected to strongly influence supervision time.

We propose using Gaussian process (GP) regres-
sion for cost prediction, a start-of-the-art nonpara-
metric Bayesian regression technique (Rasmussen
and Williams, 2006)2. As reported on a similar
task by Cohn and Specia (2013), and confirmed by
our preliminary experiments, GP regression signifi-
cantly outperforms popular techniques such as sup-

2Code available at http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/

172



port vector regression and least-squares linear re-
gression. We also follow their settings for GP, em-
ploying GP regression with a squared exponential
kernel with automatic relevance determination. De-
pending on the number of users and amount of train-
ing data available for each user, models may be
trained separately for each user (as we do here), or
in a combined fashion via multi-task learning as pro-
posed by Cohn and Specia (2013).

It is also crucial for the predictions to be reliable
throughout the whole relevant space of segments.
If the cost of certain types of segments is system-
atically underpredicted, the segmentation algorithm
might be misled to prefer these, possibly a large
number of times.3 An effective trick to prevent such
underpredictions is to predict the log time instead of
the actual time. In this way, errors in the critical low
end are penalized more strongly, and the time can
never become negative.

4.2 Error Correction Modeling

As one utility measure, we can use the number of
errors corrected, a useful measure for post editing
tasks over automatically produced annotations. In
order to measure how many errors can be removed
by supervising a particular segment, we must es-
timate both how many errors are in the automatic
annotation, and how reliably a human can remove
these for a given supervision mode.

Most machine learning techniques can estimate
confidence scores in the form of posterior probabil-
ities. To estimate the number of errors, we can sum
over one minus the posterior for all tokens, which
estimates the Hamming distance from the reference
annotation. This measure is appropriate for tasks in
which the number of tokens is fixed in advance (e.g.
a part-of-speech estimation task), and a reasonable
approximation for tasks in which the number of to-
kens is not known in advance (e.g. speech transcrip-
tion, cf. Section 5.1.1).

Predicting the particular tokens at which a human
will make a mistake is known to be a difficult task
(Olson and Olson, 1990), but a simplifying constant

3For instance, consider a model that predicts well for seg-
ments of medium size or longer, but underpredicts the supervi-
sion time of single-token segments. This may lead the segmen-
tation algorithm to put every token into its own segment, which
is clearly undesirable.

human error rate can still be useful. For example,
in the task from Section 2, we may suspect a certain
number of errors in a transcript segment, and predict,
say, 95% of those errors to be removed via typing,
but only 85% via respeaking.

4.3 Classifier Improvement Modeling
Another reasonable utility measure is accuracy of a
classifier trained on the data we choose to annotate
in an active learning framework. Confidence scores
have been found useful for ranking particular tokens
with regards to how much they will improve a clas-
sifier (Settles, 2008). Here, we may similarly score
segment utility as the sum of its token confidences,
although care must be taken to normalize and cali-
brate the token confidences to be linearly compara-
ble before doing so. While the resulting utility score
has no interpretation in absolute terms, it can still be
used as an optimization objective (cf. Section 5.2.1).

5 Experiments

In this section, we present experimental results ex-
amining the effectiveness of the proposed method
over two tasks: speech transcription and Japanese
word segmentation.4

5.1 Speech Transcription Experiments
Accurate speech transcripts are a much-demanded
NLP product, useful by themselves, as training ma-
terial for ASR, or as input for follow-up tasks like
speech translation. With recognition accuracies
plateauing, manually correcting (post editing) auto-
matic speech transcripts has become popular. Com-
mon approaches are to identify words (Sanchez-
Cortina et al., 2012) or (sub-)sentences (Sperber et
al., 2013) of low confidence, and have a human edi-
tor correct these.

5.1.1 Experimental Setup
We conduct a user study in which participants

post-edited speech transcripts, given a fixed goal
word error rate. The transcription setup was such
that the transcriber could see the ASR transcript of
parts before and after the segment that he was edit-
ing, providing context if needed. When imprecise
time alignment resulted in segment breaks that were

slightly “off,” as happened occasionally, that context
helped guess what was said. The segment itself was
transcribed from scratch, as opposed to editing the
ASR transcript; besides being arguably more effi-
cient when the ASR transcript contains many mis-
takes (Nanjo et al., 2006; Akita et al., 2009), prelim-
inary experiments also showed that supervision time
is far easier to predict this way. Figure 4 illustrates
what the setup looked like.

We used a self-developed transcription tool to
conduct experiments. It presents our computed seg-
ments one by one, allows convenient input and play-
back via keyboard shortcuts, and logs user interac-
tions with their time stamps. A selection of TED
talks5 (English talks on technology, entertainment,
and design) served as experimental data. While
some of these talks contain jargon such as medi-
cal terms, they are presented by skilled speakers,
making them comparably easy to understand. Initial
transcripts were created using the Janus recognition
toolkit (Soltau et al., 2001) with a standard, TED-
optimized setup. We used confusion networks for
decoding and obtaining confidence scores.

For reasons of simplicity, and better compara-
bility to our baseline, we restricted our experiment
to two supervision modes: TYPE and SKIP. We
conducted experiments with 3 participants, 1 with
several years of experience in transcription, 2 with
none. Each participant received an explanation on
the transcription guidelines, and a short hands-on
training to learn to use our tool. Next, they tran-
scribed a balanced selection of 200 segments of
varying length and quality in random order. This
data was used to train the user models.

Finally, each participant transcribed another 2
TED talks, with word error rate (WER) 19.96%
(predicted: 22.33%). We set a target (predicted)
WER of 15% as our optimization constraint,6 and
minimize the predicted supervision time as our ob-
jective function. Both TED talks were transcribed
once using the baseline strategy, and once using the
proposed strategy. The order of both strategies was
reversed between talks, to minimize learning bias
due to transcribing each talk twice.

The baseline strategy was adopted according to
5www.ted.com
6Depending on the level of accuracy required by our final

application, this target may be set lower or higher.

Sperber et al. (2013): We segmented the talk into
natural, subsentential units, using Matusov et al.
(2006)’s segmenter, which we tuned to reproduce
the TED subtitle segmentation, producing a mean
segment length of 8.6 words. Segments were added
in order of increasing average word confidence, until
the user model predicted a WER<15%. The second
segmentation strategy was the proposed method,
similarly with a resource constraint of WER<15%.

Supervision time was predicted via GP regres-
sion (cf. Section 4.1), using segment length, au-
dio duration, and mean confidence as input features.
The output variable was assumed subject to addi-
tive Gaussian noise with zero mean, a variance of
5 seconds was chosen empirically to minimize the
mean squared error. Utility prediction (cf. Section
4.2) was based on posterior scores obtained from
the confusion networks. We found it important to
calibrate them, as the posteriors were overconfident
especially in the upper range. To do so, we automat-
ically transcribed a development set of TED data,
grouped the recognized words into buckets accord-
ing to their posteriors, and determined the average
number of errors per word in each bucket from an
alignment with the reference transcript. The map-
ping from average posterior to average number of
errors was estimated via GP regression. The result
was summed over all tokens, and multiplied by a
constant human confidence, separately determined
for each participant.7

5.1.2 Simulation Results
To convey a better understanding of the poten-

tial gains afforded by our method, we first present a
simulated experiment. We assume a transcriber who
makes no mistakes, and needs exactly the amount of
time predicted by a user model trained on the data of
a randomly selected participant. We compare three
scenarios: A baseline simulation, in which the base-
line segments are transcribed in ascending order of
confidence; a simulation using the proposed method,
in which we change the WER constraint in small in-
crements; finally, an oracle simulation, which uses

7More elaborate methods for WER estimation exist, such as
by Ogawa et al. (2013), but if our method achieves improve-
ments using simple Hamming distance, incorporating more so-
phisticated measures will likely achieve similar, or even better
accuracy.

the proposed method, but uses a utility model that
knows the actual number of errors in each segment.
For each supervised segment, we simply replace the
ASR output with the reference, and measure the re-
sulting WER.

Figure 5 shows the simulation on an example
TED talk, based on an initial transcript with 21.9%
WER. The proposed method is able to reduce the
WER faster than the baseline, up to a certain point
where they converge. The oracle simulation is even
faster, indicating room for improvement through
better confidence scores.

5.1.3 User Study Results
Table 1 shows the results of the user study. First,

we note that the WER estimation by our utility
model was off by about 2.5%: While the predicted
improvement in WER was from 22.33% to 15.0%,
the actual improvement was from 19.96% to about
12.5%. The actual resulting WER was consistent

across all users, and we observe strong, consistent
reductions in supervision time for all participants.
Prediction of the necessary supervision time was ac-
curate: Averaged over participants, 45:41 minutes
were predicted for the baseline, 44:22 minutes mea-
sured. For the proposed method, 32:11 minutes were
predicted, 33:37 minutes measured. On average,
participants removed 6.68 errors per minute using
the baseline, and 8.93 errors per minute using the
proposed method, a speed-up of 25.2%.

Note that predicted and measured values are not
strictly comparable: In the experiments, to provide
a fair comparison participants transcribed the same
talks twice (once using baseline, once the proposed
method, in alternating order), resulting in a notice-
able learning effect. The user model, on the other
hand, is trained to predict the case in which a tran-
scriber conducts only one transcription pass.

As an interesting finding, without being informed
about the order of baseline and proposed method,
participants reported that transcribing according to
the proposed segmentation seemed harder, as they
found the baseline segmentation more linguistically
reasonable. However, this perceived increase in dif-
ficulty did not show in efficiency numbers.

5.2 Japanese Word Segmentation Experiments

Word segmentation is the first step in NLP for lan-
guages that are commonly written without word
boundaries, such as Japanese and Chinese. We ap-
ply our method to a task in which we domain-adapt a
word segmentation classifier via active learning. In
this experiment, participants annotated whether or
not a word boundary occurred at certain positions in
a Japanese sentence. The tokens to be grouped into
segments are positions between adjacent characters.

175



5.2.1 Experimental Setup
Neubig et al. (2011) have proposed a pointwise

method for Japanese word segmentation that can be
trained using partially annotated sentences, which
makes it attractive in combination with active learn-
ing, as well as our segmentation method. The
authors released their method as a software pack-
age “KyTea” that we employed in this user study.
We used KyTea’s active learning domain adaptation
toolkit8 as a baseline.

For data, we used the Balanced Corpus of Con-
temporary Written Japanese (BCCWJ), created by
Maekawa (2008), with the internet Q&A subcor-
pus as in-domain data, and the whitepaper subcor-
pus as background data, a domain adaptation sce-
nario. Sentences were drawn from the in-domain
corpus, and the manually annotated data was then
used to train KyTea, along with the pre-annotated
background data. The goal (objective function) was
to improve KyTea’s classification accuracy on an in-
domain test set, given a constrained time budget of
30 minutes. There were again 2 supervision modes:
ANNOTATE and SKIP. Note that this is essentially a
batch active learning setup with only one iteration.

We conducted experiments with one expert with
several years of experience with Japanese word seg-
mentation annotation, and three non-expert native
speakers with no prior experience. Japanese word
segmentation is not a trivial task, so we provided
non-experts with training, including explanation of
the segmentation standard, a supervised test with
immediate feedback and explanations, and hands-on
training to get used to the annotation software.

Supervision time was predicted via GP regression
(cf. Section 4.1), using the segment length and mean
confidence as input features. As before, the output
variable was assumed subject to additive Gaussian
noise with zero mean and 5 seconds variance. To ob-
tain training data for these models, each participant
annotated about 500 example instances, drawn from
the adaptation corpus, grouped into segments and
balanced regarding segment length and difficulty.

For utility modeling (cf. Section 4.3), we first nor-
malized KyTea’s confidence scores, which are given
in terms of SVM margin, using a sigmoid function
(Platt, 1999). The normalization parameter was se-

8http://www.phontron.com/kytea/active.html

lected so that the mean confidence on a development
set corresponded to the actual classifier accuracy.
We derive our measure of classifier improvement for
correcting a segment by summing over one minus
the calibrated confidence for each of its tokens. To
analyze how well this measure describes the actual
training utility, we trained KyTea using the back-
ground data plus disjoint groups of 100 in-domain
instances with similar probabilities and measured
the achieved reduction of prediction errors. The cor-
relation between each group’s mean utility and the
achieved error reduction was 0.87. Note that we ig-
nore the decaying returns usually observed as more
data is added to the training set. Also, we did not
attempt to model user errors. Employing a con-
stant base error rate, as in the transcription scenario,
would change segment utilities only by a constant
factor, without changing the resulting segmentation.

After creating the user models, we conducted the
main experiment, in which each participant anno-
tated data that was selected from a pool of 1000
in-domain sentences using two strategies. The first,
baseline strategy was as proposed by Neubig et al.
(2011). Queries are those instances with the low-
est confidence scores. Each query is then extended
to the left and right, until a word boundary is pre-
dicted. This strategy follows similar reasoning as
was the premise to this paper: To decide whether or
not a position in a text corresponds to a word bound-
ary, the annotator has to acquire surrounding context
information. This context acquisition is relatively
time consuming, so he might as well label the sur-
rounding instances with little additional effort. The
second strategy was our proposed, more principled
approach. Queries of both methods were shuffled
to minimize bias due to learning effects. Finally, we
trained KyTea using the results of both methods, and
compared the achieved classifier improvement and
supervision times.

5.2.2 User Study Results
Table 2 summarizes the results of our experi-

ment. It shows that the annotations by each partic-
ipant resulted in a better classifier for the proposed
method than the baseline, but also took up consider-
ably more time, a less clear improvement than for
the transcription task. In fact, the total error for
time predictions was as high as 12.5% on average,

pert and 3 non-expert participants. For each participant,
the resulting classifier accuracy [%] after supervision is
shown, along with the time [min] they needed. The unsu-
pervised accuracy was 95.14%.

where the baseline method tended take less time than
predicted, the proposed method more time. This is
in contrast to a much lower total error (within 1%)
when cross-validating our user model training data.
This is likely due to the fact that the data for train-
ing the user model was selected in a balanced man-
ner, as opposed to selecting difficult examples, as
our method is prone to do. Thus, we may expect
much better predictions when selecting user model
training data that is more similar to the test case.

Plotting classifier accuracy over annotation time
draws a clearer picture. Let us first analyze the re-
sults for the expert annotator. Figure 6 (E.1) shows
that the proposed method resulted in consistently
better results, indicating that time predictions were
still effective. Note that this comparison may put the
proposed method at a slight disadvantage by com-
paring intermediate results despite optimizing glob-
ally.

For the non-experts, the improvement over the
baseline is less consistent, as can be seen in Fig-
ure 6 (N.1) for one representative. According to
our analysis, this can be explained by two factors:
(1) The non-experts’ annotation error (6.5% on av-
erage) was much higher than the expert’s (2.7%),
resulting in a somewhat irregular classifier learn-
ing curve. (2) The variance in annotation time
per segment was consistently higher for the non-
experts than the expert, indicated by an average
per-segment prediction error of 71% vs. 58% rela-
tive to the mean actual value, respectively. Infor-
mally speaking, non-experts made more mistakes,
and were more strongly influenced by the difficulty
of a particular segment (which was higher on av-
erage with the proposed method, as indicated by a

In Figures 6 (2-4) we present a simulation experi-
ment in which we first pretend as if annotators made
no mistakes, then as if they needed exactly as much
time as predicted for each segment, and then both.
This cheating experiment works in favor of the pro-
posed method, especially for the non-expert. We
may conclude that our segmentation approach is ef-
fective for the word segmentation task, but requires
more accurate time predictions. Better user models
will certainly help, although for the presented sce-
nario our method may be most useful for an expert
annotator.

9Note that the non-expert in the figure annotated much faster
than the expert, which explains the comparable classification
result despite making more annotation errors. This is in contrast
to the other non-experts, who were slower.

5.3 Computational Efficiency

Since our segmentation algorithm does not guar-
antee polynomial runtime, computational efficiency
was a concern, but did not turn out problematic.
On a consumer laptop, the solver produced seg-
mentations within a few seconds for a single docu-
ment containing several thousand tokens, and within
hours for corpora consisting of several dozen doc-
uments. Runtime increased roughly quadratically
with respect to the number of segmented tokens. We
feel that this is acceptable, considering that the time
needed for human supervision will likely dominate
the computation time, and reasonable approxima-
tions can be made as noted in Section 3.2.

6 Relation to Prior Work

Efficient supervision strategies have been studied
across a variety of NLP-related research areas, and
received increasing attention in recent years. Ex-
amples include post editing for speech recogni-
tion (Sanchez-Cortina et al., 2012), interactive ma-
chine translation (González-Rubio et al., 2010), ac-
tive learning for machine translation (Haffari et al.,
2009; González-Rubio et al., 2011) and many other
NLP tasks (Olsson, 2009), to name but a few studies.

It has also been recognized by the active learn-
ing community that correcting the most useful parts
first is often not optimal in terms of efficiency, since
these parts tend to be the most difficult to manually
annotate (Settles et al., 2008). The authors advocate
the use of a user model to predict the supervision ef-
fort, and select the instances with best “bang-for-the-
buck.” This prediction of supervision effort was suc-
cessful, and was further refined in other NLP-related
studies (Tomanek et al., 2010; Specia, 2011; Cohn
and Specia, 2013). Our approach to user modeling
using GP regression is inspired by the latter.

Most studies on user models consider only super-
vision effort, while neglecting the accuracy of hu-
man annotations. The view on humans as a perfect
oracle has been criticized (Donmez and Carbonell,
2008), since human errors are common and can
negatively affect supervision utility. Research on
human-computer-interaction has identified the mod-
eling of human errors as very difficult (Olson and
Olson, 1990), depending on factors such as user ex-
perience, cognitive load, user interface design, and

fatigue. Nevertheless, even the simple error model
used in our post editing task was effective.

The active learning community has addressed the
problem of balancing utility and cost in some more
detail. The previously reported “bang-for-the-buck”
approach is a very simple, greedy approach to com-
bine both into one measure. A more theoretically
founded scalar optimization objective is the net ben-
efit (utility minus costs) as proposed by Vijaya-
narasimhan and Grauman (2009), but unfortunately
is restricted to applications where both can be ex-
pressed in terms of the same monetary unit. Vijaya-
narasimhan et al. (2010) and Donmez and Carbonell
(2008) use a more practical approach that specifies a
constrained optimization problem by allowing only
a limited time budget for supervision. Our approach
is a generalization thereof and allows either specify-
ing an upper bound on the predicted cost, or a lower
bound on the predicted utility.

The main novelty of our presented approach is
the explicit modeling and selection of segments of
various sizes, such that annotation efficiency is opti-
mized according to the specified constraints. While
some works (Sassano and Kurohashi, 2010; Neubig
et al., 2011) have proposed using subsentential seg-
ments, we are not aware of any previous work that
explicitly optimizes that segmentation.

7 Conclusion

We presented a method that can effectively choose
a segmentation of a language corpus that optimizes
supervision efficiency, considering not only the ac-
tual usefulness of each segment, but also the anno-
tation cost. We reported noticeable improvements
over strong baselines in two user studies. Future user
experiments with more participants would be desir-
able to verify our observations, and allow further
analysis of different factors such as annotator ex-
pertise. Also, future research may improve the user
modeling, which will be beneficial for our method.
