Abstract

Remarkable success has been achieved in the
last few years on some limited machine read-
ing comprehension (MRC) tasks. However, it
is still difficult to interpret the predictions of
existing MRC models. In this paper, we fo-
cus on extracting evidence sentences that can
explain or support the answers of multiple-
choice MRC tasks, where the majority of an-
swer options cannot be directly extracted from
reference documents.

Due to the lack of ground truth evidence sen-
tence labels in most cases, we apply distant
supervision to generate imperfect labels and
then use them to train an evidence sentence
extractor. To denoise the noisy labels, we
apply a recently proposed deep probabilistic
logic learning framework to incorporate both
sentence-level and cross-sentence linguistic
indicators for indirect supervision. We feed
the extracted evidence sentences into exist-
ing MRC models and evaluate the end-to-end
performance on three challenging multiple-
choice MRC datasets: MultiRC, RACE, and
DREAM, achieving comparable or better per-
formance than the same models that take as in-
put the full reference document. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first work extracting
evidence sentences for multiple-choice MRC.

1 Introduction

Recently, there have been increased interests
in machine reading comprehension (MRC). In
this work, we mainly focus on multiple-choice
MRC (Richardson et al., 2013; Mostafazadeh
et al., 2016; Ostermann et al., 2018): given a
document and a question, the task aims to select
the correct answer option(s) from a small num-
ber of answer options associated with this ques-

tion. Compared to extractive and abstractive MRC
tasks (e.g., (Rajpurkar et al., 2016; Kočiskỳ et al.,
2018; Reddy et al., 2019)) where most questions
can be answered using spans from the reference
documents, the majority of answer options cannot
be directly extracted from the given texts.

Existing multiple-choice MRC models (Wang
et al., 2018b; Radford et al., 2018) take as input the
entire reference document and seldom offer any
explanation, making interpreting their predictions
extremely difficult. It is a natural choice for hu-
man readers to use sentences from a given text to
explain why they select a certain answer option in
reading tests (Bax, 2013). In this paper, as a pre-
liminary attempt, we focus on exacting evidence
sentences that entail or support a question-answer
pair from the given reference document.

For extractive MRC tasks, information retrieval
techniques can be very strong baselines to ex-
tract sentences that contain questions and their an-
swers when questions provide sufficient informa-
tion, and most questions are factoid and answer-
able from the content of a single sentence (Lin
et al., 2018; Min et al., 2018). However, we
face unique challenges to extract evidence sen-
tences for multiple-choice MRC tasks. The correct
answer options of a significant number of ques-
tions (e.g., 87% questions in RACE (Lai et al.,
2017; Sun et al., 2019)) are not extractive, which
may require advanced reading skills such as in-
ference over multiple sentences and utilization of
prior knowledge (Lai et al., 2017; Khashabi et al.,
2018; Ostermann et al., 2018). Besides, the ex-
istence of misleading wrong answer options also
dramatically increases the difficulty of evidence
sentence extraction, especially when a question
provides insufficient information. For example, in
Figure 1, given the reference document and ques-
tion “Which of the following statements is true ac-
cording to the passage?”, almost all the tokens in



697

the wrong answer option B “In 1782, Harvard be-
gan to teach German.” appear in the document
(i.e., sentence S9 and S11) while the question gives
little useful information for locating answers. Fur-
thermore, we notice that even humans sometimes
have difficulty in finding pieces of evidence when
the relationship between a question and its correct
answer option is implicitly indicated in the doc-
ument (e.g., “What is the main idea of this pas-
sage?”). Considering these challenges, we argue
that extracting evidence sentences for multiple-
choice MRC is at least as difficult as that for ex-
tractive MRC or factoid question answering.

Given a question, its associated answer options,
and a reference document, we propose a method
to extract sentences that can potentially support or
explain the (question, correct answer option) pair
from the reference document. Due to the lack of
ground truth evidence sentences in most multiple-
choice MRC tasks, inspired by distant supervision,
we first extract silver standard evidence sentences
based on the lexical features of a question and its
correct answer option (Section 2.2), then we use
these noisy labels to train an evidence sentence
extractor (Section 2.1). To denoise imperfect la-
bels, we also manually design sentence-level and
cross-sentence linguistic indicators such as “adja-
cent sentences tend to have the same label” and
accommodate all the linguistic indicators with a
recently proposed deep probabilistic logic learn-
ing framework (Wang and Poon, 2018) for indirect
supervision (Section 2.3).

Previous extractive MRC and question answer-
ing studies (Min et al., 2018; Lin et al., 2018) indi-
cate that a model should be able to achieve compa-
rable end-to-end performance if it can accurately
predict the evidence sentence(s). Inspired by the
observation, to indirectly evaluate the quality of
the extracted evidence sentences, we only keep the
selected sentences as the new reference document
for each instance and evaluate the performance of
a machine reader (Wang et al., 2018b; Radford
et al., 2018) on three challenging multiple-choice
MRC datasets: MultiRC (Khashabi et al., 2018),
RACE (Lai et al., 2017), and DREAM (Sun et al.,
2019). Experimental results show that we can
achieve comparable or better performance than the
same reader that considers the full context. The
comparison between ground truth evidence sen-
tences and automatically selected sentences indi-
cates that there is still room for improvement.

Our primary contributions are as follows: 1) to
the best of our knowledge, this is the first work
to extract evidence sentences for multiple-choice
MRC; 2) we show that it may be a promising
direction to leverage various sources of linguis-
tic knowledge for denoising noisy evidence sen-
tence labels. We hope our attempts and observa-
tions can encourage the research community to de-
velop more explainable MRC models that simulta-
neously provide predictions and textual evidence.

Figure 1: An overview of our pipeline. The input in-
stance comes from RACE (Lai et al., 2017).

We will present our evidence sentence extrac-
tor (Section 2.1) trained on the noisy training data
generated by distant supervision (Section 2.2) and
denoised by an existing deep probabilistic logic
framework that incorporates different kinds of lin-
guistic indicators (Section 2.3). The extractor is
followed by an independent neural reader for eval-
uation. See an overview in Figure 1.

2.1 Evidence Sentence Extractor
We use a multi-layer multi-head trans-
former (Vaswani et al., 2017) to extract evidence
sentences. Let Ww and Wp be the word (subword)
and position embeddings, respectively. Let M de-
note the total number of layers in the transformer.
Then, the m-th layer hidden state hm of a token is
given by:

hm =

{
Ww +Wp if m = 0
TB(hm−1) if 1 ≤ m ≤ M

(1)

where TB stands for the Transformer Block, which
is a standard module that contains MLP, residual
connections (He et al., 2016) and LayerNorm (Ba
et al., 2016).

Compared to classical transformers, pre-trained
transformers such as GPT (Radford et al., 2018)



698

and BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) capture rich world
and linguistic knowledge from large-scale exter-
nal corpora, and significant improvements are ob-
tained by fine-tuning these pre-trained models on
a variety of downstream tasks. We follow this
promising direction by fine-tuning GPT (Radford
et al., 2018) on a target task. Note that the pre-
trained transformer in our pipeline can also be eas-
ily replaced with other pre-trained models, which
however is not the focus of this paper.

We use (X,Y ) to denote all training data,
(Xi, Yi) to denote each instance, where Xi is a to-
ken sequence, namely, Xi = {X1i , . . . , Xti}where
t equals to the sequence length. For evidence sen-
tence extraction, Xi contains one sentence in a
document, a question, and all answer options as-
sociated with the question. Yi indicates the proba-
bility that sentence in Xi is selected as an evidence
sentence for this question, and

∑N
i=1 Yi = 1,

where N equals to the total number of sentences in
a document. GPT takes as input Xi and produces
the final hidden state hMi of the last token in Xi,
which is further fed into a linear layer followed by
a softmax layer to generate the probability:

Pi =
exp(WyhMi )∑

1≤i≤N exp(Wyh
M
i )

(2)

where Wy is weight matrix of the output layer. We
use Kullback-Leibler divergence loss KL(Y ||P )
as the training criterion.

We first apply distant supervision to gener-
ate noisy evidence sentence labels (Section 2.2).
To denoise the labels, during the training stage,
we use deep probabilistic logic learning (DPL) –
a general framework for combining indirect su-
pervision strategies by composing probabilistic
logic with deep learning (Wang and Poon, 2018).
Here we consider both sentence-level and cross-
sentence linguistic indicators as indirect supervi-
sion strategies (Section 2.3).

As shown in Figure 2, during training, our
evidence sentence extractor contains two com-
ponents: a probabilistic graph containing vari-
ous sources of indirect supervision used as a su-
pervision module and a fine-tuned GPT used as
a prediction module. The two components are
connected via a set of latent variables indicating
whether each sentence is an evidence sentence or
not. We update the model by alternatively opti-
mizing GPT and the probabilistic graph so that
they reach an agreement on latent variables. Af-
ter training, only the fine-tuned GPT is kept to

make predictions for a new instance during test-
ing. We provide more details in Appendix A and
refer readers to Wang and Poon (2018) for how to
apply DPL as a tool in a downstream task such as
relation extraction.

2.2 Silver Standard Evidence Generation

Given correct answer options, we use a distant su-
pervision method to generate the silver standard
evidence sentences.

Inspired by Integer Linear Programming mod-
els (ILP) for summarization (Berg-Kirkpatrick
et al., 2011; Boudin et al., 2015), we model ev-
idence sentence extraction as a maximum cover-
age problem and define the value of a selected
sentence set as the sum of the weights for the
unique words it contains. Formally, let vi denote
the weight of word i, vi = 1 if word i appears in
the correct answer option, vi = 0.1 if it appears in
the question but not in the correct answer option,
and vi = 0 otherwise.1

We use binary variables ci and sj to indicate the
presence of word i and sentence j in the selected
sentence set, respectively. Occi,j is a binary vari-
able indicating the occurrence of word i in sen-
tence j, lj denotes the length of sentence j, and
L is the predefined maximum number of selected
sentences. We formulate the ILP problem as:

max
∑
i

vici s.t.
∑
j

sj ≤ L (3)

sj Occij ≤ ci, ∀i, j
∑
j

sj Occij ≥ ci,∀i (4)

ci ∈ {0, 1} ∀i sj ∈ {0, 1} ∀j

2.3 Linguistic Indicators for Indirect
Supervision

To denoise the imperfect labels generated by dis-
tant supervision (Section 2.2), as a preliminary
attempt, we manually design a small number of
sentence-level and cross-sentence linguistic indi-
cators incorporated in DPL for indirect supervi-
sion. We briefly introduce them as follows and
detail all indicators in Appendix A.3 and imple-
mentation details in Section 3.2.

We assume that a sentence is more likely to
be an evidence sentence if the sentence and the
question have similar meanings, lengths, coher-
ent entity types, same sentiment polarity, or the

parameters vi on the development set.

sentence is true (i.e., entailment) given the ques-
tion. We assume that a good evidence sentence
should be neither too long nor too short (i.e., 5 ≤
# of tokens in sentence ≤ 40) considering infor-
mativeness and conciseness, and an evidence sen-
tence is more likely to lead to the prediction of
the correct answer option (referred as “reward”),
which is motivated by our experiments that ma-
chine readers take as input the silver (or gold)
standard evidence sentences achieve the best per-
formance except for human performance on three
multiple-choice machine reading comprehension
datasets (Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4 in Sec-
tion 3). We rely on both lexical features (e.g.,
lengths and entity types) and semantic features
based on pre-trained word/paraphrase embeddings
and external knowledge graphs to measure the
similarity of meanings. We use existing models or
resources for reward calculation, sentiment analy-
sis and natural language inference.

For cross-sentence indicators, we consider that
the same set of evidence sentences are less likely
to support multiple questions and two evidence
sentences that support the same question should be
within a certain distance (i.e., evidence sentences
for the same question should be within window
size 8 (in sentences)). We also assume that adja-
cent sentences tend to have the same label. We will
have more discussions about these assumptions in
the data analysis (Section 3.6).

3 Experiments

3.1 Datasets

We use the following three latest multiple-choice
machine reading comprehension datasets for eval-
uation. We show data statistics in Table 1.

MultiRC (Khashabi et al., 2018): MultiRC is a
dataset in which questions can only be answered
by considering information from multiple sen-
tences. A question may have multiple correct an-
swer options. Reference documents come from
seven different domains such as elementary school
science and travel guides. For each document,
questions and their associated answer options are
generated and verified by turkers.

RACE (Lai et al., 2017): RACE is a dataset col-
lected from English language exams designed for
middle (RACE-Middle) and high school (RACE-
High) students in China, carefully designed by En-
glish instructors. The proportion of questions that
requires reasoning is 59.2%.

DREAM (Sun et al., 2019): DREAM is a dataset
collected from English exams for Chinese lan-
guage learners. Each instance in DREAM con-
tains a multi-turn multi-party dialogue, and the
correct answer option must be inferred from the
dialogue context. In particular, a large portion of
questions require multi-sentence inference (84%)
and/or commonsense knowledge (34%).

3.2 Implementation Details

We use spaCy (Honnibal and Johnson, 2015) for
tokenization and named entity tagging. We use
the pre-trained transformer (i.e., GPT) released
by Radford et al. (2018) with the same pre-
processing procedure. When GPT is used as the
neural reader, we set training epochs to 4, use eight
P40 GPUs for experiments on RACE, and use one
GPU for experiments on other datasets. When
GPT is used as the evidence sentence extractor,
we set batch size 1 per GPU and dropout rate 0.3.
We keep other parameters default. Depending on
the dataset, training the evidence sentence extrac-
tor generally takes several hours.

For DPL, we adopt the toolkit from Wang
and Poon (2018). During training, we con-
duct message passing in DPL iteratively, which
usually converges within 5 iterations. We use
Vader (Gilbert, 2014) for sentiment analysis and
ParaNMT-50M (Wieting and Gimpel, 2018) to
calculate the paraphrase similarity between two
sentences. We use the knowledge graphs (i.e.,
triples in ConceptNet v5.6 (Speer and Havasi,
2012; Speer et al., 2017)) to incorporate com-
monsense knowledge. To calculate the natural
language inference probability, we first fine-tune
the transformer (Radford et al., 2018) on several
tasks, including SNLI (Bowman et al., 2015), Sci-
Tail (Khot et al., 2018), MultiNLI (Williams et al.,
2018), and QNLI (Wang et al., 2018a).

To calculate the probability that each sentence
leads to the correct answer option, we sample a
subset of sentences and use them to replace the full
context in each instance, and then we feed them
into the transformer fine-tuned with instances with
full context. If a particular combination of sen-
tences S = {s1, . . . , sn} leads to the prediction
of the correct answer option, we reward each sen-
tence inside this set with 1/n. To avoid the combi-
natorial explosion, we assume evidence sentences
lie within window size 3. For another neural
reader Co-Matching (Wang et al., 2018b), we use
its default parameters. For DREAM and RACE,

we set L, the maximum number of silver stan-
dard evidence sentences of a question, to 3. For
MultiRC, we set L to 5 since many questions have
more than 5 ground truth evidence sentences.

3.3 Evaluation on MultiRC
Since its test set is not publicly available, cur-
rently we only evaluate our model on the devel-
opment set (Table 2). The fine-tuned transformer
(GPT) baseline, which takes as input the full docu-
ment, achieves an improvement of 2.2% in macro-
average F1 (F1m) over the previous highest score,
66.5%. If we train our evidence sentence extrac-
tor using the ground truth evidence sentences pro-
vided by turkers, we can obtain a much higher F1m
72.3%, even after we remove nearly 66% of sen-
tences in average per document. We can regard
this result as the supervised upper bound for our
evidence sentence extractor. If we train the evi-
dence sentence extractor with DPL as a supervi-
sion module, we get 70.5% in F1m. The perfor-
mance gap between 70.5% and 72.3% shows there
is still room for improving denoising strategies.

3.4 Evaluation on RACE
As we cannot find any public implementations of
recently published independent sentence selectors,
we compare our evidence sentence extractor with
InferSent released by Conneau et al. (2017) as
previous work (Htut et al., 2018) has shown that
it outperforms many state-of-the-art sophisticated
sentence selectors on a range of tasks. We also in-
vestigate the portability of our evidence sentence
extractor by combing it with two neural readers.
Besides the fine-tuned GPT baseline, we use Co-
Matching (Wang et al., 2018b), another state-of-
the-art neural reader on the RACE dataset.

As shown in Table 3, by using the evidence sen-
tences selected by InferSent, we suffer up to a
1.9% drop in accuracy with Co-Matching and up
to a 4.2% drop with the fine-tuned GPT. In com-
parison, by using the sentences extracted by our
sentence extractor, which is trained with DPL as a

supervision module, we observe a much smaller
decrease (0.1%) in accuracy with the fine-tuned
GPT baseline, and we slightly improve the accu-
racy with the Co-Matching baseline. For ques-
tions in RACE, introducing the content of an-
swer options as additional information for evi-
dence sentence extraction can narrow the accuracy
gap, which might be due to the fact that many
questions are less informative (Xu et al., 2018).
Note that all these results are compared with 59%
reported from Radford et al. (2018), if compared
with our own replication (56.8%), sentence extrac-
tor trained with either DPL or distant supervision
leads to gain up to 2.1%.

Since the problems in RACE are designed for
human participants that require advanced reading
comprehension skills such as the utilization of ex-
ternal world knowledge and in-depth reasoning,
even human annotators sometimes have difficul-
ties in locating evidence sentences (Section 3.6).
Therefore, a limited number of evidence sen-
tences might be insufficient for answering chal-
lenging questions. Instead of removing “non-
relevant” sentences, we keep all the sentences in a
document while adding a special token before and
after the extracted evidence sentences. With DPL
as a supervision module, we see an improvement
in accuracy of 0.9% (from 58.9% to 59.8%).



702

For our current supervised upper bound (i.e., as-
suming we know the correct answer option, we
find the silver evidence sentences from rule-based
distant supervision and then feed them into the
fine-tuned transformer, we get 72.8% in accuracy,
which is quite close to the performance of Ama-
zon Turkers. However, it is still much lower than
the ceiling performance. To answer questions that
require external knowledge, it might be a promis-
ing direction to retrieve evidence sentences from
external resources, compared to only consider-
ing sentences within a reference document for
multiple-choice machine reading comprehension
tasks.

3.5 Evaluation on DREAM

See Table 4 for results on the DREAM dataset.
The fine-tuned GPT baseline, which taks as input
the full document, achieves 55.1% in accuracy on
the test set. If we train our evidence sentence ex-
tractor with DPL as a supervision module and feed
the extracted evidence sentences to the fine-tuned
GPT, we get test accuracy 57.7%. Similarly, if
we train the evidence sentence extractor only with
silver standard evidence sentences extracted from
the rule-based distant supervision method, we ob-
tain test accuracy 56.3%, i.e., 1.4% lower than
that with full supervision. Experiments demon-
strate the effectiveness of our evidence sentence
extractor with denoising strategy, and the useful-
ness of evidence sentences for dialogue-based ma-
chine reading comprehension tasks in which refer-
ence documents are less formal compared to those
in RACE and MultiRC.

3.6 Human Evaluation

Extracted evidence sentences, which help neural
readers to find correct answers, may still fail to

convince human readers. Thus we evaluate the
quality of extracted evidence sentences based on
human annotations (Table 5).

MultiRC 53.0 60.8

notated evidence sentences on the dev set (silver sen-
tences: evidence sentences extracted by ILP (Sec-
tion 2.2); sentences by ESEDPL: evidence sentences ex-
tracted by ESE trained on silver stand ground truth, GT:
ground truth evidence sentences).

MultiRC: Even trained using the noisy labels,
we achieve a macro-average F1 score 60.8% on
MultiRC, indicating the learning and generaliza-
tion capabilities of our evidence sentence extrac-
tor, compared to 53.0%, achieved by using the
noisy silver standard evidence sentences guided by
correct answer options.
RACE: Since RACE does not provide the ground
truth evidence sentences, to get the ground truth
evidence sentences, two human annotators anno-
tate 500 questions from the RACE-Middle devel-
opment set.2 The Cohen’s kappa coefficient be-
tween two annotations is 0.87. For negation ques-
tions which include negation words (e.g., “Which
statement is not true according to the passage?”),
we have two annotation strategies: we can either
find sentences that can directly imply the correct
answer option; or the sentences that support the
wrong answer options. During annotation, for
each question, we use the strategy that leads to
fewer evidence sentences.

We find that even humans have troubles in lo-
cating evidence sentences when the relationship
between a question and its correct answer option
is implicitly implied. For example, a significant
number of questions require the understanding of
the entire document (e.g., “what’s the best title
of this passage” and “this passage mainly tells
us that ”) and/or external knowledge (e.g., “the
writer begins with the four questions in order to
”, “The passage is probably from ” , and “If the

writer continues the article, he would most likely
write about ”). For 10.8% of total questions, at
least one annotator leave the slot blank due to the
challenges mentioned above. 65.2% of total ques-
tions contain at least two evidence sentences, and

2Annotations are available at https://github.
com/nlpdata/evidence.

703

70.9% of these questions contain at least one ad-
jacent sentence pair in their evidence sentences,
which may provide evidence to support our as-
sumption adjacent sentences tend to have the same
label in Section 2.3.

The average and the maximum number of evi-
dence sentences for the remaining questions is 2.1
and 8, respectively. The average number of evi-
dence sentences in the full RACE dataset should
be higher since questions in RACE-High are more
difficult (Lai et al., 2017), and we ignore 10.8% of
the total questions that require the understanding
of the whole context.

3.7 Error Analysis

We analyze the predicted evidence sentences for
instances in RACE for error analysis. Tough with
a high macro-average recall (67.9%), it is likely
that our method extracts sentences that support
distractors. For example, to answer the question
“You lost your keys. You may call ”, our sys-
tem mistakenly extracts sentences “Please call
5016666” that support one of the distractors and
adjacent to the correct evidence sentences “Found
a set of keys. Please call Jane at 5019999.” in
the given document. We may need linguistic con-
straints or indicators to filter out irrelevant selected
sentences instead of simply setting a hard length
constraint such as 5 for all instances in a dataset.

Besides, it is possible that there is no clear sen-
tence in the document for justifying the correct-
ness of the correct answer. For example, to an-
swer the question “What does “figure out” mean
?”, neither “find out” nor the correct answer op-
tion appears in the given document as this question
mainly assesses the vocabulary acquisition of hu-
man readers. Therefore, all the extracted sentences
(e.g., “sometimes... sometimes I feel lonely, like
I’m by myself with no one here.”, “sometimes I feel
excited, like I have some news I have to share!”)
by our methods are inappropriate. A possible solu-
tion is to predict whether a question is answerable
following previous work (e.g., (Hu et al., 2019))
on addressing unanswerable questions in extrac-
tive machine reading comprehension tasks such as
SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2018) before to extract
the evidence sentences for this question.

4 Related Work

4.1 Sentence Selection for Machine Reading
Comprehension and Fact Verification

Previous studies investigate paragraph retrieval for
factoid question answering (Chen et al., 2017;
Wang et al., 2018c; Choi et al., 2017; Lin et al.,
2018), sentence selection for machine reading
comprehension (Hewlett et al., 2017; Min et al.,
2018), and fact verification (Yin and Roth, 2018;
Hanselowski et al., 2018). In these tasks, most
of the factual questions/claims provide sufficient
clues for identifying relevant sentences, thus of-
ten information retrieval combined with filters can
serve as a very strong baseline. For example, in
the FEVER dataset (Thorne et al., 2018), only
16.8% of claims require composition of multi-
ple evidence sentences. For some of the cloze-
style machine reading comprehension tasks such
as CBT (Hill et al., 2016), Kaushik and Lipton
(2018) demonstrate that for some models, compa-
rable performance can be achieved by considering
only the last sentence that usually contains the an-
swer. Different from above work, we exploit infor-
mation in answer options and use various indirect
supervision to train our evidence sentence extrac-
tor, and previous work can actually be a regarded
as a special case for our pipeline. Compared to Lin
et al. (2018), we leverage rich linguistic knowl-
edge for denoising imperfect labels.

Several work also investigate content selection
at the token level (Yu et al., 2017; Seo et al., 2018),
in which some tokens are automatically skipped
by neural models. However, they do not utilize any
linguistic knowledge, and a set of discontinuous
tokens has limited explanation capability.

4.2 Machine Reading Comprehension with
External Linguistic Knowledge

Linguistic knowledge such as coreference res-
olution, frame semantics, and discourse rela-
tions is widely used to improve machine com-
prehension (Wang et al., 2015; Sachan et al.,
2015; Narasimhan and Barzilay, 2015; Sun et al.,
2018) especially when there are only hundreds
of documents available in a dataset such as
MCTest (Richardson et al., 2013). Along with
the creation of large-scale reading comprehension
datasets, recent machine reading comprehension
models rely on end-to-end neural models, and it
primarily uses word embeddings as input. How-
ever, Wang et al. (2016); Dhingra et al. (2017,



704

2018) show that existing neural models do not
fully take advantage of the linguistic knowledge,
which is still valuable for machine reading com-
prehension. Besides widely used lexical fea-
tures such as part-of-speech tags and named entity
types (Wang et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2017; Dhin-
gra et al., 2017, 2018), we consider more diverse
types of external knowledge for performance im-
provements. Moreover, we accommodate exter-
nal knowledge with probabilistic logic to poten-
tially improve the interpretability of MRC models
instead of using external knowledge as additional
features.

4.3 Explainable Machine Reading
Comprehension and Question Answering

To improve the interpretability of question answer-
ing, previous work utilize interpretable internal
representations (Palangi et al., 2017) or reasoning
networks that employ a hop-by-hop reasoning pro-
cess dynamically (Zhou et al., 2018). A research
line focuses on visualizing the whole derivation
process from the natural language utterance to the
final answer for question answering over knowl-
edge bases (Abujabal et al., 2017) or scientific
word algebra problems (Ling et al., 2017). Jansen
et al. (2016) extract explanations that describe the
inference needed for elementary science questions
(e.g., “What form of energy causes an ice cube
to melt”). In comparison, the derivation sequence
is less apparent for open-domain questions, espe-
cially when they require external domain knowl-
edge or multiple-sentence reasoning. To improve
explainability, we can also check the attention map
learned by neural readers (Wang et al., 2016),
however, attention map is learned in end-to-end
fashion, which is different from our work.

A similar work proposed by Sharp et al. (2017)
also uses distant supervision to learn how to ex-
tract informative justifications. However, their ex-
periments are primarily designed for factoid ques-
tion answering, in which it is relatively easy to ex-
tract justifications since most questions are infor-
mative. In comparison, we focus on multi-choice
MRC that requires deep understanding, and we
pay particular attention to denoising strategies.

5 Conclusions

We focus on extracting evidence sentences for
multiple-choice MRC tasks, which has not been
studied before. We propose to apply distant su-

pervision to noisy labels and apply a deep proba-
bilistic logic framework that incorporates linguis-
tic indicators for denoising noisy labels during
training. To indirectly evaluate the quality of the
extracted evidence sentences, we feed extracted
evidence sentences as input to two existing neu-
ral readers. Experimental results show that we
can achieve comparable or better performance on
three multiple-choice MRC datasets, in compari-
son with the same readers taking as input the en-
tire document. However, there still exist signifi-
cant differences between the predicted sentences
and ground truth sentences selected by humans,
indicating the room for further improvements.
