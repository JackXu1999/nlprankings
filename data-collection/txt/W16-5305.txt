Abstract

The identification of semantic relations between terms within texts is a fundamental task in Nat-
ural Language Processing which can support applications requiring a lightweight semantic inter-
pretation model. Currently, semantic relation classification concentrates on relations which are
evaluated over open-domain data. This work provides a critique on the set of abstract relations
used for semantic relation classification with regard to their ability to express relationships be-
tween terms which are found in a domain-specific corpora. Based on this analysis, this work
proposes an alternative semantic relation model based on reusing and extending the set of ab-
stract relations present in the DOLCE ontology. The resulting set of relations is well grounded,
allows to capture a wide range of relations and could thus be used as a foundation for automatic
classification of semantic relations.

1 Introduction

The identification of abstract semantic relations between terms in text has emerged as a Natural Language
Processing technique which is useful in a variety of tasks that depend on the extraction of key semantic
relations from text. In essence, the task of semantic relation classification (SRC) consists in identifying
common abstract relations such as causal, hypernymic and meronymic as relationships between terms in
the text.

This definition puts semantic relation classification in the context of ontology extraction from text,
where the emphasis is on the process of extracting more general and abstract relations, in contrast to
more domain-specific relations.

However, despite the obvious intuition around the utility of the task, the justification on the scoping
of the semantic relations set and their expressive coverage has not been fully grounded with regard to
an ontological framework. In contrast to this situation, the set of relations expressed within foundational
ontologies are more formally axiomatised and built under conceptually well grounded methodologies.

Complementarily, the semantic relation classification task provides a corpus-based analysis on the in-
cidence of these semantic relations on discourse, providing the fine-grained semantic context in which
these abstractions are instantiated. However, when projecting these semantic relations back to the
corpora-level, it can be observed that the majority of the words within a text does not have a direct
semantic relationship connecting them.

Recent semantic interpretation tasks targeting word prediction over broader discourse contexts (Pa-
perno et al., 2016) may require the detection of broader and complex semantic relations. Addressing
these interpretation tasks may strongly benefit from relating terms expressed into the sentence using
compositions of semantic relations.

This work aims at improving the description and the formalisation of the semantic relation classifi-
cation task by grounding it with a foundational ontology and by introducing the concept of composite
semantic relations, in which the relations between terms within a text can be expressed using the com-
position of one or more relations.

This work focuses on the following contributions:

• Examination of the completeness of the set of semantic relations used for the evaluation of semantic
relation classification (SRC) tasks in the context of a domain-specific corpus.

• Contrasting of the relations used in SRC tasks with regard to relations present in the foundational
ontology DOLCE, in the context of a domain-specific corpora.

• Annotation of terms within sentences from a financial corpus with semantic relations, including
composite semantic relations, and creation of a domain-specific test collection for relation classifi-
cation.

The paper is organised as follows: Section 2 lists related work regarding the semantic relation annota-
tion task. Section 3 presents an analysis of current sets of semantic relations, and describes the relations
provided by the foundational ontology DOLCE. Section 4 describes the corpus-based analysis, followed
by the conclusions and future work in Section 5.

2 The Semantic Relation Classification Task

Semantic Relation Classification is usually framed under the context of a supervised classification prob-
lem. Best practices for creating relation inventories have been subject to much discussion (O’Seaghdha,
2007). Inventories can either be organised under a hierarchical (Rosario and Hearst, 2001), (Nastase and
Szpakowicz, 2003), (Masolo et al., 2003) or under a flattened approach (Moldovan et al., 2004).

The number of relations in a given inventory varies widely, ranging from binary classification (Lapata,
2002) to 35 classes (Moldovan et al., 2004) to open (inference-based) approaches (Sabou et al., 2008).

There are several test collections for Semantic Relation Classification. Task 8 in SemEval 2010 (Hen-
drickx et al., 2009) focuses on multi-way semantic relation classification between pairs of nouns. Nine
relations with broad coverage were selected1, with a focus on practical interest. Patterns were used to
collect relation candidates from the web, which were then classified by two annotators. In the context of
Distributional Semantics, BLESS (Baroni and Lenci, 2011) is a test collection which is designed to eval-
uate Distributional Semantic Models (DSMs) on the task of Semantic Relation Classification. BLESS
provides a benchmark for evaluating the lexical semantic capabilities of DSMs: it provides concept,
relation, relatum triples for a large range of common concepts. There are five lexical semantic rela-
tions (co-hyponym, hypernym, meronym, attribute and event) and three random relations (random-noun,
random-verb, random-adjective), which provide additional value for discriminativeness assessments.
Some work has been done on SRC for specific domains, with a focus on the medical domain. Stephens
et al. (2001) distinguish 17 relations holding between genes. Rosario and Hearst (2001) classify relations
between noun compounds in the medical domain, while Rosario et al. (2002) undertake a similar endeav-
our using the MeSH hierarchy. Rosario and Hearst (2004) explore SRC for biomedical texts, focusing
on relations between treatments and diseases such as “prevents”, “cures” or less specific effects.

3 A Critique of Existing Sets of Semantic Relations

3.1 SemEval-2010 Task 8

Although the Semeval-2010 Task 8 semantic relations set was developed with the aim of covering “real
word” situations (Hendrickx et al., 2009), some of the constraints imposed to overcome the structural and
lexical factors that can affect the truth of a relation, described next, can bring considerable limitations. In
those cases, it is necessary to identify other classes of semantic relations between terms covering other
lexical categories.

1Cause-Effect (CE), Instrument-Agency (IA), Product-Producer (PP), Content-Container (CC), Entity-Origin (EO), Entity-
Destination (ED), Component-Whole (CW), Member-Collection (MC), Message-Topic (MT)

31



3.1.1 Focus on Nominals
The first point to be noted refers to the entities involved in the classification: the task focuses on semantic
relations between pairs of nominals, that is, the relation arguments are only noun-phrases where the head
is a common-noun.

3.1.2 Locality Constraint
The data used in the Semeval classification task also relies on a locality constraint, which means that
only nominal expressions considered “local” to one another were chosen, excluding relations whose
arguments occur in separate sentential clauses. Although in a few cases a long distance between the
arguments can indeed indicate the absence of a proper relation, in our financial data we note many
sentences where the concepts are not local to one another, and nevertheless it is possible to assign a
relation to them. For example, consider the pair “debt” and “creditworthiness” in Example 1, or the
concepts “credit union” and “caisse populaire” in Example 2.

(1) “Your debt problem won’t go away, but your creditworthiness will. ”

(2) “In Quebec 70 per cent of the population belongs to a caisse populaire, while in Saskatchewan
close to 60 per cent belongs to a credit union”.

In both cases, the concepts are located in different clauses within the sentences, but it is possible to
identify a relation between them which could be indirect reference and sibling concept, respectively. In
this case, no Semeval relation fits, and custom relations are necessary to better express the relationship.

3.1.3 Focus on Concrete Relations
Although not stated as a constraint, most Semeval relations seems to refer specifically to physical ob-
jects. For example, the relation Content-Container (CC) is described as “An object is physically stored
in a delineated area of space”. In Instrument-Agency (IA), Product-Producer (PP), Entity-Origin (EO)
and Entity-Destination (ED), all the mentioned examples involve physical objects as instruments, a ma-
terial product being produced or a concrete objects physically moving to/from a place. This focus on
concrete relations poses challenges to the classification of semantic relations within certain domains,
since concepts representing abstract entities or quantitative/qualitative roles, such as “credit”, “debit”,
“investment”, “demand”, “profit”, “interest”, “capital” or “price”, to mention a few, are very frequent.

3.1.4 Conditionals
Finally, the exclusion of conditional clauses also imposes unnecessary generality constraints. The Se-
meval task considers, for example, that in Example 3 the presence of the "bleach solution" inside the
"bottle" is a situation being described as holding in a counterfactual hypothetical world, so it is not
possible to assign a relation that can be seen as true regardless of hypothesis confirmation.

(3) “Suppose you were given a bottle that contains 400 grams of a 3.0% bleach solution.”

Conditional clauses are frequent in many domains, for example within the financial domain. This
domain involves many variables and frequently a scenario is being described based on them and the
possible values they can assume. Therefore, condition indeed seems to be a suitable relation between
certain concepts, as in Example 4, where the relation arguments are “term” and “bought”.

(4) “TIPS can be held to maturity and have a minimum term of ownership of 45 days if bought
through TreasuryDirect”

In the light of these limitations, adopting a richer conceptual meta-model, such as the one provided
by the DOLCE ontology (Masolo et al., 2003), allow us to cover a broader range of categories instead
of focusing only on physical objects, and consequently bring us a wider variety of relations to link those
categories. Since all relations have a well defined domain and range, we can also ensure that they are
valid for a given pair of concepts. Our analysis of the dataset has also shown that a complementary
set of custom relations is of substantial importance to express the correct relationship between domain-
specific concepts or even between concepts that, although being very common, interact among them in

32



very domain-specific situations. In Section 3.2 below, we therefore describe the DOLCE ontology and
its relations.

3.2 DOLCE relations

DOLCE (Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering) is an upper level ontology
developed as a module of the WonderWeb library of foundational ontologies (Masolo et al., 2003). It has
a clear cognitive bias, that is, it aims at capturing the ontological categories underlying natural language
and human common sense.

The most fundamental distinction in DOLCE is that between endurants and perdurants. DOLCE
relations are organised in a hierarchical structure.There are two toplevel relations: immediate-relation,
defined as a relation that holds without mediating individuals, and mediated-relation, a relation that (im-
plicitly) composes other relations. Two additional branches, namely immediate-relation-i and mediated-
relation-i, cover all the inverse relations (only 4 relations do not have an inverse, and 14 relations have
themselves as inverse, i.e., they are symmetric).

The immediate-relation branch has 23 sub-relations at its second level, many of them being also subdi-
vided into further levels. Among them are worth highlighting: part, the most general meronym relation;
participant, the immediate relation holding between endurants and perdurants and which, through the
sub-relations of its sub-relation functional-participant, can define the role played by the endurant in the
perdurant, for instance: patient, target, theme, performed-by, instrument, resource, etc. ; and references,
a relation holding between non-physical objects and any other kind of entity (including non-physical
objects themselves), which can be seen as a type of association where the non-physical object carries
some kind of information that involves the referenced entity.

The mediated-relation branch has 25 sub-relations at its second level, with again some of them subdi-
vided into further sub-relations. Among them are worth noting: co-participates-with, a relation between
two endurants participating in the same perdurant; generic-location, a relation defining the physical or
abstract location of an entity; and temporal-relation, a relation between perdurants which, through its
sub-relations, describe how two occurrences are related with respect to their temporal locations: pre-
cedes, temporally-coincides, temporally-includes, temporally-overlaps, etc.

The relations having more generic classes as domain and range, that is, classes at higher levels in the
hierarchy, proved to be more useful for the semantic annotation task (cp. Section 4 below). As most of
the relations have an inverse, it is almost always possible to assign a suitable property regardless of the
arguments order, without the need to indicate the direction of the relation.

DOLCE relations show to be a suitable set for SRC tasks because, as an upper level ontology, DOLCE
aims at covering entities in any domain of knowledge. Since any entity can be mapped to a DOLCE high
level category, it is always possible to find a relation (or a subset of candidate relations) between two
entities, which will be the relation(s) between their upper level DOLCE categories. When the relation
is defined specifically for a class, it determines in a meaningful way what kind of relationship this class
can have with another one. On the other hand, when the relation is inherited from an ancestor class,
the kind of relationship can become too general. To address this issue and avoid the use of semantically
vague relations, a small set of custom relations was proposed to complement the DOLCE relations set
(cp. Section 4.2.1). Notwithstanding, this complementary set was designed to be as domain-independent
as possible, in order to fit not only the context where it was defined, but to be also useful in any SRC
task.

4 Corpus-based Analysis

The analysis methodology presented in this section consists in the annotation of semantic relations with
the help of a corpus. The corpus focuses on financial discourse and was crawled considering two types
of discourse: glossaries and encyclopedic articles.

In the sections below, we describe the construction of our financial corpus including word pair selec-
tion and annotation (Section 4.1) and the extensive manual classification analysis (Section 4.2).

33



4.1 Corpus Construction

We created a financial corpus by crawling two distinct types of sources: a) definitions, comprising three
sources: the Bloomberg financial Glossary2 (8324 definitions; 212,421 tokens), SGM Glossary3 (1007
definitions; 43,638 tokens) and Investopedia Definitions4 (15476 definitions; 2,462,801 tokens), b) ar-
ticles from two sources: Investopedia5 (5890 articles; 5,129,793 tokens) and Wikipedia (articles on
Investment6 and Finance7; 8306 articles; 6,714,129 tokens). Overall, our corpus contains 14,580,803
tokens.

After the creation of the financial corpus, we selected word pairs for relation classification according
to the following methodology: Splitting the corpus into sentences, the first word of the pair was randomly
selected amongst the tokens in the sentence, with the only constraint that it was listed in one of the three
financial glossaries. Then, the second word was manually selected. The sentence context was preserved
for manual classification analysis (see Section 4.2 below).

4.2 Manual Classification Analysis

Our semantic relation classification comprised 300 pairs of words, each associated with a sentence con-
text (see Section 4.1 above). First, for each pair, a class from the foundational ontology DOLCE (Masolo
et al., 2003) was assigned to both concepts. These classes represent the primary, highest level category
that the concept belongs to. This concept-ontology class alignment was performed with the aid of the
WordNet-DOLCE alignment (Gangemi et al., 2003). For each concept, the correct sense and its corre-
sponding DOLCE class were manually identified and assigned to it. For simplicity, all adjectives and
adverbs were assigned the class quality.

After classifying both concepts, it is possible to search for the most suitable relation between them,
which is a property from DOLCE having the classes assigned to the concepts as domain and range. For
example, if one concept represents an agent, and the other one an action, the possible relations between
them could be performs, meaning that the agent performs the action, or prescribes, signifying that the
agent does not perform the action him/herself, but somehow causes it to happen and to be performed
by other agent(s). Besides the domain and range information, the sentence context where the concepts
appear also helps to identify the correct relation. This also means that the relation assigned represents the
relationship between those concepts in a particular sentence; the same pair of words could have different
meanings and/or show a different kind of relationship in other sentence. When no suitable relation could
be found in DOLCE, a new relation or a composite relation was suggested. When suggesting a new
relation, we tried to make it as general as possible, that is, not too tied to a specific context, so it could be
later reused by other concept pairs. The manual classification was performed by an expert in conceptual
modelling and later independently reviewed by a second expert.

Following this methodology, three scenarios occurred: (1) there was a direct relationship between the
two concepts, so either a DOLCE relation or a custom suggested relation could be directly assigned to
them; (2) there were no direct relations, but the concepts were indirectly related through other concepts,
then a composition of (DOLCE or suggested) relations was drawn, building a path made of intermediate
concept pairs linking the concepts; (3) no relation between the two concepts could be found at all, because
they were too far away from each other in the same clause, or because they were in different clauses in
a sentence, or in different sentences in a paragraph. In the final classification, 72. 67% (218 pairs) of
the pairs were assigned a direct relation, 24.67% (74 pairs) were linked through an indirect relation, and
only 2.66% (8 pairs) were not classified. The classification results are summarised in Table 1.

4.2.1 Direct Relations
For most concept pairs it was possible to assign a direct semantic relation. Out of the 218 pairs where
this scenario occurred, 35.32% (77 pairs) were assigned a DOLCE property as a semantic relation, and
for 64.68% (141 pairs) of the pairs no DOLCE property fit, so a suggested relation was assigned to each
of them. The suggested relations are listed in Table 2, and the DOLCE properties are well documented
in the ontology itself8.

Value component One concept represents a measure (something to which a
value can be assigned), and the other one is something that,
along with other parameters, determines its final value

Valuation of life annuities may be performed by calculating the
actuarial present value of the future life contingent payments.

Affects The existence or occurrence of one concept has some kind of
effect on the other concept

If the option they have written gets exercised several things can
happen: for both put and call writers if an option expires unexer-
cised or is bought to close it is treated as a short-term capital gain.

Among the DOLCE relations, the most frequent ones are patient and its inverse patient-of, as well
as target and its inverse target-of, covering around 42% (32 pairs) of the pairs in this scenario. These
relations refer to the association between events and the (abstract or physical) objects they affect. The
patient relation means that the object has a relatively static role in the event. Target is a specialisation of
patient, and can be seen as an object to which an event is more intentionally directed.

This can give us an idea about the most frequent kind of concept that the events in this domain take
as objects. The most common classes occurring as patient or target of an event are legal-possession-
entity, such as “money”, “loan”, “shares”, “income” or “investment”, description, like “deal”, “trend” or
“agreement”, and situation, such as “merger”, “integration” or “asset management”, being affected by
events like “pay”, “buy”, “invest”, “complete”, “manage” and “deliver”, for example.

The suggested relations provide an abstract structural framework to express unnamed (implicit) re-
lations between concepts within the text, without the need to commit to a domain-specific ontological
model. Among the suggested relations, the most recurrent ones are qualifier, indirect target and owner-
ship, accounting for 47.5% (67 pairs) of the pairs in this scenario. The high frequency of the qualifier
relation can give us a hint about what concepts commonly modifies/are modified by other concepts. Ad-
jectives like “solvent”, “failed” and “eligible” are usually associated with social-roles, like “company”
or “bank”, while nouns denoting legal-possession-entities frequently modifies other legal-possession-
entities, specialising them, as in the pairs “mortgage” and “line [of credit]”, and “capital” and “account”.

The indirect target relation reinforces the high frequency of the “affecting-affected entity” pairs ob-
served in the DOLCE-based classification, but in this case having some kind of intermediate between
them, and also accepting (abstract or physical) objects, and not only events, as affecting entity. In this
case, an event serves as intermediate, for example: “accountant” has as indirect target “funds”, mediated
by the event “examination”, that is, “accountant” directly performs the action “examination”, which in
turn has as direct target “funds”. Similarly, “liquidator” has as indirect target “company” through the
event “liquidation”, “recruiters” indirectly targets at “candidate” through “hire”, and so on.

Another frequent suggested relation worth noting is ownership, which is very recurrent between
social-roles, such as “company” and “bank”, or socially-constructed-persons, like “employers”, “sell-
ers” or “manager” as the owner (both classes denote roles, the first being played by a juridical entity, and
the second by a physical person), and legal-possession-entities, such as “assets”, “funds”, “insurance”,
“money” and “account” as the owned entity.

4.2.2 Relation Composition
When no direct relation between the two concepts could be found, the other concepts standing between
them were analysed, and, instead of a single relation, a chain of concept pairs, each of them with its
suitable direct relation, linked the two concepts from the original pair. Note that this scenario is different
from the ones where direct, suggested relations such as indirect target, indirect ownership or indirect
qualifier, for instance, were applied. In those cases, even having other events or objects as intermediates,
a close relationship could be identified between the concepts. A composition of relations was necessary
only when the only cohesive association from one concept to another is achieved by a direct mention of
relation chains.

Considering the 74 concept pairs where only indirect relations applied, the average length of the re-
lations chain is 2.66, that is, this is the average number of concept pairs necessary to link the concepts,
where the first pair contains one of the concepts and the last one contains the other. For example, in Ex-
ample 5, no direct relation between “type” and “month” can be inferred, but, analysing the intermediate
concepts, the following chain can be drawn: “type [references] financing, financing [used-in] payments,
payments [happens-at] month”.

36



(5) “With another type of developer financing you make regular payments each month”

The most common classes in this scenario are event and quality, which means that, even in a short
sentence, sometimes a concept is not affected by an event at all, having only a relatively weak relation
to the one that does. For qualities, the most probable reason is the distance between the concepts, as
qualities are more likely to appear close to the concepts they qualify, having no meaningful relation with
concepts far away within the sentence.

Regarding the relations in the compositions, 53.3% (111 auxiliary pairs) of them were classified using
DOLCE relations, and 43.7% (86 auxiliary pairs) using suggested relations. Again, patient and target,
and their inverses patient-of and target-of are predominant, but here the relation performs also stands out.
As all of these relations have event as domain or range, we can infer that, when no apparent relation exists
between the concepts, possibly an event can help to explain why they co-occur. Among the suggested
relations, qualifier and ownership were the most frequent semantic relations, again, due to the high
occurrence of concepts belonging to the categories quality, what leads to the qualifier relation, and social-
role and socially-constructed-person, which, along with the also frequent category legal-possession-
entity, in this sample showed to be very likely to appear as the “owner-owned entity” pair.

4.3 Correlation between Semantic Relations and Semantic Relatedness
In order to further investigate the properties of the three relation categories direct, composite, unassigned
we correlate them in terms of their semantic relatedness scores. Two human annotators scored each of
the 300 concept pairs for semantic relatedness on a scale from 0 (unrelated) to 10 (identical or highly
related), where the average of their scores was taken as the final score of the concept pair. Note that the
relatedness scoring, unlike the semantic relation assignment, was done without reference to the sentence
context in order to obtain a general semantic relatedness assessment (replicating the methodology of
(Finkelstein et al., 2001)).

If we consider the types of direct relations with regard to semantic relatedness, we find that the
most highly related ones are Specialisation (9.5; custom), Component-of (9; DOLCE), Descriptive-
place-of (9; DOLCE), Product (9; DOLCE), Use-of (8.5; DOLCE), Part-of (8.25; DOLCE), Unit-of
(DOLCE; 8.25). In more general lexical semantic terms, they are instances of hyponymy (Speciali-
sation), meronymy (Component-of, Part-of ), (abstract) location (descriptive-place-of ), and association
(Unit-of, Use-of ) and thus scored as highly related in our annotation schema. The relations whose con-
cepts on average display lowest relatedness are Happens-at (3; DOLCE), Involves (3.5; DOLCE), Result
(3.5; DOLCE), Source (3.66; custom).Happens-at has temporal characteristics, which do not necessi-
tate high relatedness. Involves, Result and Source have a low number of concept pairs in our data (one
instance each for Involves and Result, three for Source), which is why these results do not generalise.

5 Conclusions and Future Work

The semantic relation classification (SRC) task is a fundamental step in the construction of lightweight
semantic models for Natural Language Processing applications. Current SRC tasks focus on very general
relations that deal well with common sense data, but whose expressivity proves to be limited when ap-
plied to domain-specific information. We presented an analysis of the semantic relations from SemEval-
2010 (task 8), a widely used relations set in SRC tasks, evaluating its coverage and ontological soundness
to assess its suitability to domain-specific data.

Given the drawbacks identified in our evaluation and guided by a corpus-based analysis, we proposed a
set of semantic relations made up by the properties of the foundational ontology DOLCE, complemented
by a set of custom relations, and used it to classify a set of 300 pairs of terms from a financial dataset. As
a result, besides the direct ontology-based relations, we introduced the concept of composite relations, a
combination of one or more relations intended to link terms for which no direct relationship exists. The
direct relations show us how the concepts interact and the composite relations help us to explain how
terms that seem to be unrelated interact within a given context.

In addition to the manual relation classification, the pairs also received a score to indicate their se-
mantic relatedness, independent of the context where they appear. Comparing the results of both classi-

fications, we noted that pairs in a direct relationship have, on average, the highest semantic relatedness
scores. The most predominant scenarios express how concrete or abstract objects are targeted by an
event, are owned by an agent, or are modified/qualified by other objects. In contrast, pairs involved in
a composite relationship present, on average, the lowest semantic similarity scores, showing that their
relatedness is highly dependent on the context and can only be determined through a set of intermediate
terms.

This initial classification shows that a conceptually well-grounded set of relations based on an ontolog-
ical model can bring more expressivity and more flexibility for domain-specific data than that provided
by the Semeval relations set. As future work, we intend to expand our analysis also to the correla-
tion between contextual semantic and syntactic relations, as well as to extend our dataset, annotating a
larger number of concept pairs and using this data to train an automatic classifier, capable of identifying
semantic relations in large-scale corpora.
