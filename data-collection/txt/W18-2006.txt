Who in the MT community should care about TAPICC?

• Mike Dillinger (2016 AMTA keynote):
• MT researchers and MT users very different goals

• MT researchers: “Build autonomous translation machines”

• MT users: “Integrate MT with workflow and human expertise”

• To MT researchers who have no desire to integrate their systems into a 
translation workflow: Please take a nap during this presentation!

Why TAPICC?

Proceedings of AMTA 2018 Workshop: The Role of Authoritative Standards in the MT Environment Boston, March 17 - 21, 2018



• Are you a:
• Supplier of MT output to end users?
• System integrator tying a content 

management system (CMS) to a translation 
management system (TMS)?

The Current API Wild West

Proceedings of AMTA 2018 Workshop: The Role of Authoritative Standards in the MT Environment Boston, March 17 - 21, 2018



www.gala-global.org/tapicc

The Current API Wild West

• Unnecessary variation

• Continuous reinvention
of the wheel

• Wasted $$!
• For clients
• For LSPs
• For tools vendors

• Loss of operational freedom

$

Can be a “deal breaker” for making content available worldwide!

Four Tracks

Business metadata for supply chain automation
• Harmonize existing business metadata models

Exchange on unit level
• Pass a segment/unit from an editor to a TM/MT or other tool 

Semantic enrichment of units
• Terminology, TM, MT, layout for “good enough” 

Layout representation level
• Support process with visual context

Track 1: Four Working Groups

1. Business Metadata

• Define wrapper-
level metadata

• Canonical names 
and values

• Workflow relevance

• Harmonization

• Compatibility

2. Payload Specification

• Define types of 
payload

• Define payload-level 
metadata

• Canonical names and 
values

• Harmonization

• Compatibility

3. XLIFF Extraction

• Extraction guidance

• ITS decoration

• XLIFF 
Extractors/Mergers

• XLIFF OM 
representations, e.g. 
JLIFF

4. API Specification

• Protocols

• Transfer, pull and/or 
push

• Define classes

• Code samples/

• snippets

• Specify API

Each WG has co-chairs and 20+ participants.  Join WG groups on GALA’s website:  www.gala-global.org/tapicc
