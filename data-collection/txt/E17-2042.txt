Abstract
This paper presents a new resource, called
Content Types Dataset, to promote the
analysis of texts as a composition of
units with specific semantic and functional
roles. By developing this dataset, we also
introduce a new NLP task for the auto-
matic classification of Content Types. The
annotation scheme and the dataset are de-
scribed together with two sets of classifi-
cation experiments.

1 Introduction

This paper introduces a new resource and task for
NLP, namely the classification of Content Types.
The notion of Content Types differs from stan-
dard discourse relations, either based on rhetorical
structures or lexically-grounded approaches. Con-
tent Types provide cues to access the structure of a
document’s types of functional content. They con-
tribute to the overall message or purpose of a text
and make explicit the functional role of a discourse
segment with respect to its content, i.e. meaning.
Their identification may improve the performance
of more complex NLP tasks by targeting the por-
tions of the documents that are more relevant. For
example, when building a storyline it may be use-
ful to focus on the narrative segments of a text
(Vossen et al., 2015), while for sentiment analy-
sis the identification of evaluative clauses may be
beneficial (Liu, 2015).

Our contribution is threefold: i) we make avail-
able annotation guidelines with high reliability in
terms of inter-annotator agreement and applicable
to texts of different genres and period of publica-
tion; ii) we release the first version of a new dataset
(whose annotation is still in progress) that takes
into consideration both contemporary and histori-
cal texts, paving the way to a new NLP task, i.e.

Content Type Classification; and iii) we present
initial promising results for the automatic classi-
fication of Content Types by using the first ver-
sion of the dataset. All data are made available
on-line1.

The remainder of the paper is structured as fol-
lows: Section 2 illustrates the annotation scheme,
the composition of the dataset, and report the inter-
annotator agreement. Section 3 presents two sets
of experiments to automatically classify Content
Types. Related work is discussed in Section 4. Fi-
nally, conclusion and future work are reported in
Section 5.

2 Dataset Construction

Content Types (henceforth CTs) are text passages
with specific semantic and functional characteris-
tics. Their definition is based on linguistic fea-
tures, and the annotation is performed at clause
level. Clauses are considered as textual constituent
units (Polanyi, 1988), and defined as groups of
words related to each other, containing a finite
or non-finite verb, while the subject may be im-
plicit or shared with other clauses. This granular-
ity level of the mark-up was chosen to provide a
fine-grained annotation of CTs that can character-
ize different portions of the same sentence. Exam-
ple (1) is made of two clauses (divided by “//”):
the first narrates what the author is doing, the sec-
ond describes the place where she is.

(1) I am writing on a fine terrace overlooking
the sea,// where stone benches and tables are
conveniently arranged for our use.

We identify seven classes of CTs, five of which
are based from Werlich’s typology, while the last
two (OTHER and NONE) were introduced in our

scheme to account for undefined or unclear cases:

• NARRATIVE: clauses containing events and
states that can be anchored to a hypothetical
timeline; e.g., We left Cava on Wednesday,//
and made the tour from there to Amalfi.

• EVALUATIVE: clauses with explicit evalua-
tion markers; e.g., Telerate’s two independent
directors have rejected as inadequate.

• DESCRIPTIVE: clauses presenting tangi-
ble and intangible characteristics of entities,
such as objects, persons or locations; e.g.,
The road winds above, beneath, and beside
rugged cliffs of great height.

• EXPOSITORY: clauses expressing general-
izations with respect to a class.; e.g., All Ital-
ians are dandies.

• INSTRUCTIVE: clauses expressing proce-
dural information; e.g., At last you cross that
big road // and strike the limestone rock.

• OTHER: clauses containing text in foreign
languages, phatic expressions, references to
the reader; e.g., Madame est servie.

• NONE: clauses that cannot be labeled with
any of the previous classes; e.g., Chapter IV.

This specific set of classes was selected because
it provides a good level of generalization for char-
acterizing the contents of non-standardized docu-
ments (e.g. news articles vs. scientific article), and
it can be applied across different domains and gen-
res. Each markable has a set of attributes used to:
(i) specify whether a CT is part of a direct or re-
ported speech , (ii) distinguish digressions from
the primary narration, (iii) indicate whether a de-
scription refers to a person, a location or another
kind of entity, and (iv) typify the clauses annotated
as OTHER .

To test the comprehensiveness of this scheme,
we annotate English texts from two different gen-
res and periods of publication: namely, contem-
porary news and travel reports published between
the end of the XIX Century and the beginning of
the XX Century. While the former are taken from
already available datasets, i.e., TempEval-3, Penn
Discourse Treebank, and MASC (UzZaman et al.,
2013; Prasad et al., 2008; Ide et al., 2010), the lat-
ter constitute a novel set of texts extracted from
the Gutenberg project2. The corpus is released un-
der the name of Content Types Dataset version 1.0
(CTD v1). The resource is still being extended
with new annotated texts, but in the remainder of
the paper we will refer to this first version.

The annotation was conducted by two expert
linguists following a multi-step process and us-
ing the web-based tool CAT (Bartalesi Lenzi et
al., 2012). In the first phase, annotators were al-
lowed to discuss disagreements based on a trial
corpus suggesting revisions to improve the guide-
lines. In the second phase, inter-annotator agree-
ment was calculated on a subset of the CTD v1 (a
total of 5,328 tokens and 526 clauses, with 2,500
tokens and about 250 clauses per genre). Table 1
reports the Cohen’s kappa on the number of to-
kens for both text genres. With the exception
of the INSTRUCTIVE CT, all the classes have
high scores, exceeding 0.8, usually set as a thresh-
old that guarantees good annotation quality (Art-
stein and Poesio, 2008). In the final phase, the
whole dataset was annotated using the latest ver-
sion of the guidelines which includes detailed de-
scriptions of the classes, examples for both genres,
and priority rules discriminating when more than
one CT class may apply to clauses. Table 2 illus-
trates the composition of CTD v1. The two gen-
res of texts show, for almost all the CT classes, a
statistically significant difference (at p<0.01 and
calculated with the z test) in their distribution.

3 Experiments

In this section we present initial experiments for
the automatic classification of clauses in CTs. At-
tribute classification was not targeted at this stage.
We conducted two sets of experiments to test dif-
ferent modeling assumptions. In all experiments
we use gold clause boundaries.

3.1 Feature Sets

We experiment two different types of features: the
first relies on distributional information extracted
through sentence embeddings (Le and Mikolov,
2014), while the second is linguistically motivated
and focuses on syntactic and semantic properties
of the main components of the clause, i.e. the
noun phrase(s) and the verb phrase. For the first
type, we extracted embeddings for each clause
using the doc2vec (Le and Mikolov, 2014) im-
plementation in gensim, with vector size = 50
and window = 5. For the second feature type,
all documents were pre-processed at clause level
with Stanford CoreNLP (Manning et al., 2014),
performing tokenization, lemmatization, POS tag-
ging, Named Entity recognition. The extraction
of basic syntactic and semantic properties of the
clause components has been performed with a
syntactic-semantic features toolkit (Friedrich and
Pinkal, 2015). This has allowed us to identify
four blocks of features for: (i) the noun phrase in
subject position (i.e. nsubj and nsubjpass),
(ii) the noun phrase in direct object position (i.e.
dobj and agent), (iii) the noun phrase in any

other syntactic relation, and (iv) the clause verb.
Details for noun phrase and verb phrase compo-
nents are reported in Table 3.

We extended the basic features with prior sen-
timent polarity scores for nouns, verbs, adjec-
tives, and adverbs in the clause via SentiWord-
Net (Baccianella et al., 2010). For each target
POS, polarity scores are aggregated per lemma
and averaged by the number of senses, thus pro-
viding a lemma-based prior polarity. Finally, the
lemma-based polarity scores are normalized by
the clause length and scaled between 0 and 1. Fi-
nally, we introduced a binary feature to mark the
presence/absence of a temporal expression in a
clause. These two additional blocks of features
have been selected following the definition of the
CTs in the annotation guidelines. In particular, the
presence of temporal expressions in a clause can
facilitate the distinction between the NARRATIVE
and the DESCRIPTIVE classes, while the polar-
ity features should facilitate the identification of
the EVALUATIVE class.

3.2 Classification Experiments

We developed our models by dividing the an-
notated data in training (80%) and test sections
(20%), balancing the distribution in each section
across the two genres. The overall amount of
clauses in the training and test data is slightly
lower than the one of the manually annotated
clauses3: indeed, we excluded some clauses be-
cause the pre-processing tools were not able to
extract any relevant features from them. This is
mainly due to a failure of the syntactic-semantic
toolkit to process some gold clauses.

To better evaluate the performance of our mod-
els, we developed a baseline system by assigning
the most frequent CT per text genre on the basis
of the frequencies in the training data. Evaluation
has been computed by means of Precision, Recall,
and F1-score as implemented in scikit-learn (Pe-
dregosa et al., 2011).

Content-based Classification In this set of ex-
periments we aimed at verifying the fitness of
our features by assuming that CTs are indepen-
dent of each other and determined only by their
meaning. We developed four classifiers, by vary-
ing the combination of features, using two dif-
ferent learners, namely Support Vector Machines
(SVM) (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995) and Conditional
Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001):
• clause model has only basic clause fea-

tures plus the polarity scores and the pres-
ence/absence of temporal expressions.
• clause+doc2vec model has the
clause model feature set extended with
the doc2vec clause embeddings.

The SVM models have been implemented us-
ing LIBSVM (Chang and Lin, 2011) with Linear
Kernel. The CRF models have been implemented
with CRF++ toolkit 4 with default parameters.

Content and Functional Structure Classifi-
cation This set of experiments assumes an
alternative modeling strategy by viewing each
sentence as a sequence of CTs, each associated
with a clause. For this second set of experiments
we implemented two linear CRF classifiers by
extending the previously described models with a
context window of [+/-2] for all features.

35,503 vs. 5,536 in the training set; 653 vs. 660 in the test
set.

Results are illustrated in Table 4. The
content-based classification experiments show
that CTs are subject to the functional structure of
the sentence and, more generally, of the document.
Only the CRF classifiers, i.e. sequence labeling
models, can beat the baseline, providing balanced
results for Precision and Recall, and improving
the F1 score by 0.11 (CRF-clauseC) and 0.10
points (CRF-clause+doc2vecC). The SVM
models, on the contrary, fail to beat the baseline.
This could be due to the imbalanced distribution
of CTs, and also to the fact that content features
alone are not enough to discriminate the different
CTs. The contribution of the doc2vec features is,
however, limited: they help increasing the Recall
values (+0.03 points) but have a little effect on
the Precision (+0.01 point) when considering the
CRF models. On the contrary, they do not provide
any improvements with the SVM models.

As for the content and functional structure
classification models, the results indicate that
context features positively contribute to the
improvement of the classification task (the CRF-
clauseCF with context features outperforms
its direct counterpart, CRF-clauseC, in the
content-based classification setting). It is interest-
ing to notice a redundancy between the doc2vec
features and the context window. In this case,
the CRF-clause+doc2vecCF has the lowest
results for Precision and F1, and a slight increase
in Recall (0.68 vs. 0.67).

4 Related Work

The classification of text passages has been stud-
ied in previous works considering different textual
units (e.g., clauses, sentences, and paragraphs) or
language patterns (Kaufer et al., 2004). Several
annotation schemes, often based on genre-specific
taxonomies, have been proposed. This is the case,
for example, of the detection of the main compo-
nents in scholarly publications (Teufel et al., 2009;
Liakata et al., 2012; De Waard and Maat, 2012;
Burns et al., 2016) or the annotation of content
zones, i.e., functional constituents of texts (Bieler
et al., 2007; Stede and Kuhn, 2009; Baiamonte et
al., 2016). On the contrary, the notion of Con-
tent Types that we have adopted applies across
genres. CTs are based on linguistic theories on
discourse/rhetorical strategies but differ from dis-
course relations. Over the years, different typolo-
gies have been proposed (Werlich, 1976; Biber,

ally, with the exception of the work by Cocco et
al. (2011).

The theory of Discourse Modes (DMs) (Smith,
2003) is instead followed by Mavridou et al.
(2015) that apply it to a paragraph-based pilot an-
notation of a variety of documents such as nov-
els, news and European Parliament proceedings.
Annotators intuitively labeled DMs relying on a
very short manual: as a consequence, no formal
guidelines were made available and only a mod-
erate agreement was achieved. Moreover, the fi-
nal dataset is not publicly available and the recog-
nition of DMs has not been automated yet. Our
approach is different: we rely on Werlich’s typol-
ogy, we provide complete annotation guidelines,
we make available the annotated dataset, and we
experiment automatic classification of CTs.

5 Conclusion and Future Work

In this work, we presented a novel resource an-
notated with CTs and a set of experiments aimed
at automatically classifying clauses based on con-
tent and on their functional structure. Although
this work is still in progress, the proposed an-
notation scheme proved sound and the developed
corpus can already provide insights into the func-
tional role of discourse segments with respect to
the clause meaning.

In addition to SVM and CRFs, we experimented
with artificial neural networks (ANN) using the
Keras5 framework running on the TensorFlow im-
plementation (Abadi et al., 2015). We tested dif-
ferent configurations but results are not higher

5https://github.com/fchollet/keras

than those obtained with CRFs. We will investi-
gate the reasons and try other models. Similarly,
we will investigate whether SVM kernels other
than the linear one can do better.

In the future, we will continue the annotation of
the dataset, by introducing documents from other
text genres (e.g. travel guides, news editorials,
school textbooks) so as to re-balance the distri-
butions of the CTs in the dataset. Furthermore,
we plan to study whether information on content
types can contribute to other NLP tasks. For exam-
ple, we believe that identifying NARRATIVE and
EVALUATIVECTs may contribute to discriminat-
ing between clauses useful to build a storyline or a
timeline of events (the former) and clauses bearing
sentiment information (the latter).
