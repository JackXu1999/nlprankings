Abstract

Recent research in cross-lingual word embed-
dings has almost exclusively focused on of-
fline methods, which independently train word
embeddings in different languages and map
them to a shared space through linear trans-
formations. While several authors have ques-
tioned the underlying isomorphism assump-
tion, which states that word embeddings in dif-
ferent languages have approximately the same
structure, it is not clear whether this is an in-
herent limitation of mapping approaches or
a more general issue when learning cross-
lingual embeddings. So as to answer this
question, we experiment with parallel corpora,
which allows us to compare offline mapping
to an extension of skip-gram that jointly learns
both embedding spaces. We observe that, un-
der these ideal conditions, joint learning yields
to more isomorphic embeddings, is less sen-
sitive to hubness, and obtains stronger results
in bilingual lexicon induction. We thus con-
clude that current mapping methods do have
strong limitations, calling for further research
to jointly learn cross-lingual embeddings with
a weaker cross-lingual signal.

1 Introduction

Cross-lingual word embeddings have attracted a
lot of attention in recent times. Existing meth-
ods can be broadly classified into two categories:
joint methods, which simultaneously learn word
representations for multiple languages on parallel
corpora (Gouws et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015),
and mapping methods, which independently train
word embeddings in different languages and map
them to a shared space through linear transforma-
tions (Mikolov et al., 2013a; Artetxe et al., 2018a).
While early work in cross-lingual word embed-
dings was dominated by joint approaches, recent
research has almost exclusively focused on map-
ping methods, which have the advantage of requir-

ing little or no cross-lingual signal (Zhang et al.,
2017; Conneau et al., 2018; Artetxe et al., 2018b).

For mapping methods to work, it is necessary
that embedding spaces in different languages have
a similar structure (i.e. are approximately isomor-
phic), as it would otherwise be hopeless to find
a linear map from one space to another. Several
authors have questioned this assumption, show-
ing that linguistic and domain divergences cause
strong mismatches in embedding spaces, which
in turn heavily hinders the performance of these
methods (Søgaard et al., 2018; Patra et al., 2019).
Nevertheless, it is not clear whether this mismatch
is a consequence of separately training both em-
bedding spaces, and thus an inherent limitation
of mapping approaches, or an insurmountable ob-
stacle that arises from the linguistic divergences
across languages, and hence a more general issue
when learning cross-lingual word embeddings.

The goal of this paper is to shed light on this
matter so as to better understand the nature and
extension of these limitations. For that purpose,
we experiment with parallel corpora, which al-
lows us to compare mapping methods and joint
methods under the exact same conditions, and an-
alyze the properties of the resulting embeddings.
Our results show that, under these conditions, joint
learning yields to more isomorphic embeddings, is
less sensitive to hubness, and obtains stronger re-
sults in Bilingual Lexicon Induction (BLI). This
suggests that, despite the advantage of requir-
ing weaker cross-lingual signal, current mapping
methods do have strong limitations, as they are
not able to leverage the available evidence as ef-
fectively as joint methods under ideal conditions.
We thus conclude that future research should try to
combine the best of both worlds, exploring joint
methods to learn cross-lingual word embeddings
with weaker supervision.

2 Related work

Cross-lingual word embeddings represent words
from multiple languages in a common vector
space. So as to train them, joint methods simulta-
neously learn the embeddings in the different lan-
guages, which requires some form of cross-lingual
supervision. This supervision usually comes from
parallel corpora, which can be aligned at the word
level (Luong et al., 2015), or only at the sentence
level (Gouws et al., 2015). In addition to that,
methods that rely on comparable corpora (Vulić
and Moens, 2016) or large bilingual dictionaries
(Duong et al., 2016) have also been proposed. For
a more detailed survey, the reader is referred to
Ruder et al. (2017).

In contrast, offline mapping approaches work
by aligning separately trained word embeddings in
different languages. For that purpose, early meth-
ods required a training dictionary, which was used
to learn a linear transformation that mapped these
embeddings into a common space (Mikolov et al.,
2013a; Artetxe et al., 2018a). The amount of re-
quired supervision was later reduced through self-
learning methods (Artetxe et al., 2017), and then
completely eliminated through adversarial train-
ing (Zhang et al., 2017; Conneau et al., 2018)
or more robust iterative approaches combined
with initialization heuristics (Artetxe et al., 2018b;
Hoshen and Wolf, 2018).

There are several authors that have discussed
the potential limitations of these mapping ap-
proaches. For instance, Søgaard et al. (2018) ob-
serve that the assumption that separately trained
embeddings are approximately isomorphic is not
true in general, showing that the performance of
mapping methods is conditioned by the language
pair, the comparability of the training corpora, and
the parameters of the word embedding algorithms.
Similarly, Patra et al. (2019) show that the iso-
morphism assumption weakens as the languages
involved become increasingly etymologically dis-
tant. Finally, Nakashole and Flauger (2018) argue
that embedding spaces in different languages are
linearly equivalent only at local regions, but their
global structure is different. Nevertheless, neither
of these works does systematically analyze the ex-
tent to which these limitations are inherent to map-
ping approaches. To the best of our knowledge,
ours is the first work comparing joint and mapping
methods in the exact same conditions, characteriz-
ing the nature and impact of such limitations.

3 Experimental design

We next describe the cross-lingual embedding
methods, evaluation measures and datasets used in
our experiments.

3.1 Cross-lingual embedding methods

We use the following procedure to learn cross-
lingual embeddings, which are representative of
the state-of-the-art in mapping and joint methods:
Mapping: We first train 300-dimensional skip-
gram embeddings for each language using
word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013b) with 10 neg-
ative samples, a sub-sampling threshold of 1e-5
and 5 training iterations. Having done that, we
map the resulting monolingual embeddings to a
cross-lingual space using the unsupervised mode
in VecMap1 (Artetxe et al., 2018b), which builds
an initial solution based on heuristics and itera-
tively improves it through self-learning.
Joint learning: We use the BiVec2 tool proposed
by Luong et al. (2015), an extension of skip-gram
that, given a word aligned parallel corpus, learns
to predict the context of both the source word and
the target word aligned with it. For that purpose,
we first word align our training corpus using Fast-
Text (Dyer et al., 2013). Given that BiVec is a
natural extension of skip-gram, we use the exact
same hyperparameters as for the mapping method.

In both cases, we restrict the vocabulary to the
most frequent 200,000 words.

3.2 Evaluation measures

We use the following measures to characterize
cross-lingual embeddings:
Isomorphism. Intuitively, the notion of isomor-
phism captures the idea of how well the embed-
dings in both languages fit together (i.e. the degree
of their structural similarity). So as to measure it,
we use the eigenvalue similarity metric proposed
by Søgaard et al. (2018). For that purpose, we
first center and normalize the embeddings, cal-
culate the nearest neighbor graphs of the 10, 000
most frequent words in each language, and com-
pute their Laplacian matrices L1 and L2. We then
find the smallest k1 such that the sum of the largest
k1 eigenvalues of L1 is at least 90% of the sum of
all its eigenvalues, and analogously for k2 and L2.
Finally we set k = min(k1, k2), and define the
eigenvalue similarity of the two spaces as the sum

Hubness. Cross-lingual word embeddings are
known to suffer from the hubness problem
(Radovanović et al., 2010a,b; Dinu et al., 2015),
which causes a few points (known as hubs) to
be the nearest neighbors of many other points in
high-dimensional spaces. So as to quantify it, we
measure the minimum percentage of target words
HN that are the nearest neighbor of at least N%
of the source words, where N is a parameter of
the metric.3 For instance, a hubness value of
H10% = 0.3% would indicate that 0.3% of the tar-
get words are the nearest neighbors of 10% of the
source words. This way, lower values of HN are
indicative of a higher level of hubness, and the pa-
rameter N serves to get a more complete picture
of the distribution of hubs. For brevity, we report
results forN = 10% and 100%. While the nearest
neighbor retrieval is usually done according to co-
sine similarity, Conneau et al. (2018) proposed an
alternative measure, called Cross-domain Similar-
ity Local Scaling (CSLS), that penalizes the sim-
ilarity scores of hubs, which in turn reduces the
hubness level. So as to better understand its ef-
fect, we report results for both CSLS and standard
nearest neighbor with cosine similarity (NN).

3Some previous work uses an alternative hubness metric
that computes the hubness level N(t) of each target word t
(i.e. the number of source words whose nearest neighbor is
t) and measures the skewness of the resulting distribution.
However, we find this metric to have two important draw-
backs: 1) its magnitude is not easily interpretable, and 2) it
is invariant to the variance of the distribution, even if higher
variances are indicative of a higher hubness level. For in-
stance, we observed that two very similar spaces (produced
running word2vec twice over the same corpora) mapped to
each other produced unusually high skewness scores, caused
by the scale normalization done in skewness (division by the
standard deviation).

Bilingual Lexicon Induction (BLI). Following
common practice, we induce a bilingual dictio-
nary by linking each word in the source language
with its nearest neighbor in the target language.
So as to evaluate the quality of the induced trans-
lations, we compare them to a gold standard dic-
tionary, and measure the precision at 1. We re-
port results for both nearest neighbor with cosine
similarity (NN) and the aforementioned CSLS re-
trieval. Note that, in addition to having a practi-
cal application, BLI performance is an informa-
tive measure of the quality of the embeddings, as
a good cross-lingual representation should place
equivalent words close to each other.

3.3 Datasets

We experiment with 4 language pairs with En-
glish as the target language, covering 3 rela-
tively close languages (German, Spanish and Ital-
ian) and a non-indoeuropean agglutinative lan-
guage (Finnish). All embeddings were trained on
the BiCleaner v3.0 version of the ParaCrawl cor-
pus,4 a parallel corpus collected through crawling
and filtered according to Sánchez-Cartagena et al.
(2018). The size of this corpus changes from one
language to another: German and Spanish are the
largest (503 and 492 million tokens in the English
side, respectively), followed by Italian (308 mil-
lion tokens), and Finnish (55 million tokens).

As for the evaluation dictionaries for BLI, we
use two datasets that have been widely used in
the literature. The first one, which we call Eparl,
was first introduced by Dinu et al. (2015) and sub-
sequently extended by Artetxe et al. (2017) and
Artetxe et al. (2018a), and consists of 1,500 test
entries extracted from Europarl word alignments

and uniformly distributed in 5 frequency bins. The
second one, which we call MUSE, consists of an-
other 1,500 test entries, and was compiled by Con-
neau et al. (2018) using internal translation tools.

4 Results

Table 1 reports the results of all the evaluation
measures for both cross-lingual embedding ap-
proaches.

The eigenvalue similarity metric shows that
joint learning obtains substantially more isomor-
phic embedding spaces than the mapping ap-
proach, indicating that the representations it learns
for different languages have a more similar struc-
ture. At the same time, it is remarkable that the
eigenvalue similarity for the four language pairs is
very close in the case of joint learning, with val-
ues that range between 26.5 and 32.8. In contrast,
the degree of isomorphism for Finnish-English is
substantially lower than the rest in the case of the
mapping approach, which is likely caused by the
typological differences between these languages
and the smaller size of the training corpus. This
suggests that joint learning is able to appropriately
fit divergent languages together, which is trouble-
some when the embedding spaces are learned sep-
arately and then mapped together.

When it comes to hubness, our results show
that joint learning is generally less sensitive to
this problem, although differences greatly vary de-
pending on the language pair. This way, both ap-
proaches have a similar behavior in German, while
joint learning does moderately better for Spanish
and Italian, and the difference becomes very large
for Finnish. Once again, this suggests that map-
ping methods are more severely affected by lin-
guistic divergences. At the same time, we observe
that CSLS is very effective at reducing the hubness
level, specially for offline mapping.

Finally, we observe that joint learning outper-
forms offline mapping in BLI. This difference is
particularly pronounced for Finnish-English (e.g.
26.3% vs 65.2% for NN on Eparl), which is in
line with the general behavior observed so far. At
the same time, our results show that CSLS is most
helpful with offline mapping, but it even has a neg-
ative impact with joint learning for some language
pairs. This can be partly explained by the fact
that the latter approach is less sensitive to hubness,
which CSLS tries to address.

5 Discussion

Our analysis reveals that, when trained on paral-
lel corpora under the exact same conditions, joint
learning obtains substantially better cross-lingual
representations than offline mapping, yielding to
more isomorphic embeddings that are less sen-
sitive to hubness and obtain stronger results on
BLI. Moreover, our results show that divergences
across languages can be effectively mitigated by
jointly learning their representations, whereas try-
ing to align separately trained embeddings is trou-
blesome when such divergences exist.

Note that this should not be interpreted as a
claim that existing joint methods are superior to
existing mapping methods. In fact, we believe
that both families serve different purposes in that
they require a different degree of supervision (e.g.
mapping methods can exploit monolingual cor-
pora, which is useful in practical settings), so the
choice to use one approach or the other should de-
pend on the resources that are available in each
particular case. Nevertheless, our results do show
that offline mapping has fundamental limitations
that, given the available evidence, seem specific to
this particular approach.

For that reason, we argue that, while recent
research on cross-lingual word embeddings has
almost exclusively focused on mapping meth-
ods, future work should consider alternative ap-
proaches to try to overcome the limitations of this
paradigm. In particular, we believe that an inter-
esting direction would be to adapt joint methods
so they can work with monolingual corpora.

6 Conclusions and future work

In this work, we compare the properties of cross-
lingual word embeddings trained through joint
learning and offline mapping on parallel corpora.
We observe that, under these ideal conditions,
joint learning yields to more isomorphic embed-
dings, is less sensitive to hubness, and obtains
stronger results in bilingual lexicon induction,
concluding that current mapping methods have
strong limitations.

This analysis calls for further research on alter-
natives to current mapping methods, which have
been very successful on unsupervised settings. In
particular, we would like to explore new meth-
ods to jointly learn cross-lingual embeddings on
monolingual corpora.
