Abstract

In this work, we investigate whether the
cultural idiosyncrasies found in human-
human interaction may be transferred to
human-computer interaction. With the
aim of designing a culture-sensitive dia-
logue system, we designed a user study
creating a dialogue in a domain that has
the potential capacity to reveal cultural dif-
ferences. The dialogue contains different
options for the system output according to
cultural differences. We conducted a sur-
vey among Germans and Japanese to in-
vestigate whether the supposed differences
may be applied in human-computer inter-
action. Our results show that there are
indeed differences, but not all results are
consistent with the cultural models.

1 Introduction

Nowadays, intelligent agents are omnipresent.
Furthermore, we live in a globally mobile soci-
ety in which people of widely different cultural
backgrounds live and work together. The number
of people who leave their ancestral cultural envi-
ronment and move to countries with different cul-
ture and language is increasing. This spurs the
need for culturally sensitive conversation agents.
Hence, our aim is to design a culture-aware di-
alogue system which allows a communication in
accordance with the user’s cultural idiosyncrasies.
By adapting the system’s behaviour to the user’s
cultural background, the conversation agent may
appear more familiar and trustworthy.

However, it is unclear whether cultural idiosyn-
crasies found in human-human interaction (HHI)
may be transferred to human-computer interac-
tion (HCI) as it has been shown that there exist
clear differences in HHI and HCI (Doran et al.,
2003). To investigate this, we designed and con-
ducted a user study with a dialogue in German and

Japanese containing cultural relevant system reac-
tions. In every dialogue turn, the study partici-
pants had to indicate their preference concerning
the system output. With the findings of the study,
we demonstrate whether there are different pref-
erences in communication style in HCI and which
concepts of HHI may be applied.

The structure of the remaining paper is as fol-
lows: In Section 2, related work is presented. Sub-
sequently, in Section 3, we present the cultural id-
iosyncrasies which we consider relevant for spo-
ken dialogue systems. In Section 4, we present
cultural differences between Germany and Japan
supposed by the cultural models for HHI. The con-
cept and the results of our study are presented in
Section 5 before concluding in Section 6.

2 Significant Related Work

Brejcha (2015) has described patterns of language
and culture in HCI and has shown why these pat-
terns matter and how to exploit them to design a
better user interface. Furthermore, Traum (2009)
has outlined how cultural aspects may be included
in the design of a visual human-like body and the
intelligent cognition driving action of the body of a
virtual human. Therefore, different cultural mod-
els have been examined and the author points out
steps for a fuller model of culture. Georgila and
Traum (2011) have presented how culture-specific
dialogue policies of virtual humans for negotiation
and in particular for argumentation and persuasion
may be built. A corpus of non-culture specific
dialogues is used to build simulated users which
are then employed to learn negotiation dialogue
policies using Reinforcement Learning. However,
only negotiation specific aspects are taken into ac-
count while we aim to create an overall culture-
sensitive dialogue system which takes into ac-
count cultural idiosyncrasies in every decision and
adapts not only what is said, but also how it is said
to the user’s cultural background.

3 Integrating cultural idiosyncrasies

In a culturally aware intelligent conversation
agent, the Dialogue Management (DM) sitting at
the core of a dialogue system (Minker et al., 2009)
has to be aware of cultural interaction idiosyn-
crasies to generate culturally appropriate output.
Hence, the DM is not only responsible for what is
said next, but also for how it is said. This is what
makes the difference to generic DM where the two
main tasks are to track the dialogue state and to se-
lect the next system action, i.e., what is uttered by
the system (Ultes and Minker, 2014).
According to various cultural models (Hofstede,
2009; Elliott et al., 2016; Kaplan, 1966; Lewis,
2010; Qingxue, 2003), different cultures prefer
different communication styles. There are four di-
mensions which we consider relevant for DM:

Animation/Emotion The display of emotions
and the apparent involvement in a topic can be per-
ceived very differently across cultures. While in
some cultures the people are likely to express their
emotions, in other cultures this is quite unusual.

Directness/Indirectness Information provided
for the user has to be presented suitable so that
the user is more likely to accept it. It has to be de-
cided whether the intent is directly expressed (e.g.
”Drink more water.”) or if an indirect communi-
cation style is chosen (e.g. ”Drinking more water
may help with headaches.”) whereby the listener
has to deduce the intent from the context.

Identity Orientation Internalised self-
perception and certain values influence the
decisions of humans which depend on their cul-
ture. Hence, arguments addressing these values
may be constructed based on the user’s culture.
In some cultures, the people are individualis-
tically oriented which means that the peoples’
personal goals take priority over their allegiance
to groups or group goals and decisions are made
individualistically. In other cultures, the people
are collectivistically oriented which means that
there is a greater emphasis on the views, needs,
and goals for the group rather than oneself and
decisions are often made in relation to obligations
to the group (e.g. family).

Thought Patterns and Rhetorical Style Dif-
ferent cultures use different argumentation styles
(e.g. linear, parallel, circular and digressive). In
a discussion, the way arguments are presented

helps to provide necessary information to the user
in an appropriate way. Additionally, some cul-
tures have low-context communication whereas
other cultures have high-context communication.
In low-context communication, there is a low use
of non-verbal communication. Therefore, the peo-
ple need background information and expect mes-
sages to be detailed. In contrast, in high-context
communication, there is a high use of non-verbal
communication and the people do not require, nor
do they expect much in-depth background infor-
mation. Taking these facts into account means that
the DM has to make a very detailed decision about
how to present the information to the user.

4 Cultural differences

According to the aforementioned cultural models,
various cultural differences are expected to ex-
ist between Germany and Japan. However, con-
cerning Animation/Emotion, both Germans and
Japanese are not expected to be emotionally ex-
pressive. According to (Elliott et al., 2016),
both cultures avoid intensely emotional interac-
tions as they may lead to a loss of self-control.
Lewis (2010) affirms the fact that both Germans
and Japanese don’t like losing their face. Hence,
emotionally expressive communication is not a
preferred mode and the people try to preserve a
friendly appearance.

Regarding Directness/Indirectness, Elliot et
al. (2016) and Lewis (2010) indeed supposes dif-
ferences between Germany and Japan in their cul-
tural model. While Germans tend to speak very
direct about certain things, Japanese prefer an im-
plicit and indirect communication.

According to (Hofstede, 2009; Elliott et al.,
2016; Lewis, 2010; Qingxue, 2003), the Iden-
tity Orientation is also expected to be different
for Germans and Japanese. Germans are sup-
posed to be rather individualistically oriented and
the personal goals take priority over the allegiance
to groups or group goals. In contrast, Japanese
are more collectivistically oriented and often make
their decisions in relation to obligations to their
family or other groups. They tend to be people-
oriented and the self is often subordinated in the
interests of harmony.

In terms of Thought Patterns and Rhetorical
Style, the cultural models also suppose various dif-
ferences between Germans and Japanese. First of
all, Qingxue (2003) states that Germans have a

75



low-context communication while Japanese have
a high-context communication. Therefore, Ger-
mans need background information and expect
messages to be detailed. In contrast, Japanese pro-
vide a lot of information through gestures, the use
of space, and even silence. Most of the informa-
tion is not explicitly transmitted in the verbal part
of the message. Furthermore, according to (El-
liott et al., 2016), the two cultures are expected to
use different argumentation styles. For Germans,
directness in stating the point, purpose, or con-
clusion of a communication is the preferred style
while for Japanese this is not considered appropri-
ate.

5 Concept and Evaluation

Based on the cultural differences in the dimen-
sions Directness/Indirectness, Identity Orientation
and Thought Patterns and Rhetorical Style which
have been presented in Section 4, we have de-
signed a study to investigate if these differences
may be transferred to HCI. We formulated four hy-
potheses:

1. Germans choose options with direct commu-
nication more often than Japanese do.

2. Japanese choose options with motivation us-
ing group oriented arguments more often than
Germans do.

3. Germans choose options with background in-
formation more often than Japanese do.

4. There are differences in the selection of argu-
mentation styles.

Experimental Setting For the study, a dialogue
in the healthcare domain has been created. This
domain has the potential capacity to reveal such
differences as very sensitive subjects are covered.
For every system output, different variations have
been formulated. Each of them has been adapted
according to the supposed cultural differences.
The participants assumed the role of a caregiver
who is caring for their father.

In the beginning of the dialogue, the agent
greets the user. The user also greets him and
tells him that their father doesn’t drink enough.
The agent asks how much he usually drinks and
the answer is that he drinks only one cup of tea
after breakfast. Afterwards, different possibili-
ties for the agent’s output are presented. The
first one doesn’t contain any background infor-
mation: ”You’re right, that’s not enough. Do

you know why your father doesn’t drink enough?”
In contrast, the other four options include some
background information why it is important for
an adult to drink at least 1.5 litres of water per
day. However, they differ in the argumentation
style (parallel, linear, circular, digressive). The
user answers that he doesn’t know why their fa-
ther doesn’t drink enough. Then, the agent has
different proposals how the water-intake may be
increased and there are four different options for
each proposal how it is presented to the user. The
first option contains background information and
expresses the content directly. The second option
is also direct but doesn’t give any background in-
formation. For the third and the fourth options an
indirect communication style is chosen, whereby
one option contains background information and
the other doesn’t. An example for the different
options can be found in Table 1.

Option Formulation

1 Offer him tea instead of water. It tastes good
and is not as bad as soft drinks.

2 Offer him tea instead of water.
3 Offering tea instead of water can help. It tastes

good and is not as bad as soft drinks.
4 Offering tea instead of water can help.

Table 1: There are four different options for each
proposal how it is presented to the user: (1) di-
rect, background information, (2) direct, no back-
ground information, (3) indirect, background in-
formation, (4) indirect, no background informa-
tion.

In the end of the dialogue, the agent tries to
motivate the user. Two different kinds of moti-
vation are formulated and presented by the agent.
The first one uses individualistically oriented ar-
guments (”You’re really doing a great job! It’s im-
pressive that you are able to handle all of this.”)
whereas the second one uses group oriented ar-
guments (”You’re really a big help for your fam-
ily!”). Afterwards, the agent and the user say
goodbye and the dialogue ends.

The survey has been conducted on-line. A video
for each possible system output has been created
using a Spoken Dialogue System with an animated
agent. For all recordings, the same system and
the same agent have been used. In each dialogue
turn, the participants had to watch videos repre-
senting the different variants of the system output
and decide which one they prefer. An example

of this web page is shown in Figure 1. During
the survey, all descriptions have been provided in
English, German and Japanese. The videos have
been recorded in English and subtitled in German
and Japanese. The translations have been made by
German and Japanese native speakers who were
instructed to be aware of the linguistic features and
details of the cultural differences to assure equiva-
lence in the translations.

The survey Altogether, 65 Germans and 46
Japanese participated in the study. They have been
recruited using mailing lists and social networks.
The participants are aged between 15 and 62 years.
The average age of the Germans is 25.7 years
while the average age of the Japanese participants
is 27.9 years. The gender distribution of the par-
ticipants is shown in Table 2. It can be seen that
65 % of the German and only 17 % of the Japanese
participants are female.

Evaluation results The evaluation of the survey
confirms our main hypothesis that Germans and
Japanese have different preferences in communi-
cation style in HCI.

Our first hypotheses says that Germans choose
options with direct communication more often
than Japanese do. The study contains four ques-
tions where the participants have to choose be-

tween direct and indirect options. Figure 2a shows
the mean of how often Germans (dark grey) and
Japanese (light grey) selected the direct option.
The German mean is with 1.89 significantly higher
than the Japanese mean (p < 0.001 using the T-
Test) thus confirming our hypothesis.

Our second hypotheses says that Japanese
choose options with motivation using group ori-
ented arguments more often than Germans do. The
survey includes one system action where the agent
motivates the user. Figure 2b shows the mean
of how often Germans (dark grey) and Japanese
(light grey) selected the motivation with group ori-
ented arguments. It can be seen that the opposite
of the hypothesised effect occurred. On average,
the Germans chose the option with group oriented
arguments more often than the Japanese (p < 0.05
using the T-Test). An explanation for this result
might be that motivation may be dependent on the
topic of the dialogue. In our case, the dialogue is
in the healthcare domain and caring for a family
member is inherently group oriented. Therefore,
it is most likely that motivating using group ori-
ented arguments is more preferred for individual-
istically oriented people. However, if for someone
it is natural to care for a family member because
he is group oriented, then motivation using group
oriented arguments is not needed and individualis-

77



tically oriented arguments seem to be favoured.
Our third hypotheses says that Germans choose

options with background information more often
than Japanese do. The survey comprises five ques-
tions where the participants could select between
system outputs with and without background in-
formation. Figure 2c shows the mean of how of-
ten Germans (dark grey) and Japanese (light grey)
selected the option with background information.
On average, both Germans and Japanese preferred
the options with background information. This
suggests that there is no non-verbal communica-
tion in this kind of HCI which is only based on
speech and does not include other modalities (the
agent in the videos does not produce any output
but the speech). In this case, Japanese tend to miss
the non-verbal communication which they use to
have in HHI and therefore need verbal background
information.

Our last hypotheses says that there are differ-
ences in the selection of argumentation styles. The
survey contains one system output where the par-
ticipants have to choose between different argu-
mentation styles. However, no significant differ-
ence could be found.

Due to the difference in the gender distribution,
it is important to investigate whether this has an ef-
fect on the overall results. As can be seen in Fig-
ure 3, only for Thought Patterns and Rhetorical
Style, a significant difference has been found: on
average, women chose options with background
information more often than men. However, as the
majority of both genders and both cultures chose
the options with background information (Mm >
2.5, Mw > 2.5, MGer > 2.5, MJap > 2.5), the
difference between the genders is not supposed to
effect the result based on the culture.

6 Conclusion and Future Directions

In this work, we presented a study investigating
whether cultural communication idiosyncrasies
found in HHI may also be observed during HCI in
a Spoken Dialogue System context. Therefore, we
have created a dialogue with different options for
the system output according to the supposed dif-
ferences. In an on-line survey on the user’s pref-
erence concerning the different options we have
shown that there are indeed differences between
Germany and Japan. However, not all results are
consistent with the existing cultural models for
HHI. This suggests that the communication pat-

terns are not only influenced by the culture, but
also by the dialogue domain and the user emotion.
Moreover, it is shown that not all cultural idiosyn-
crasies that occur in HHI may be applied for HCI.

In this work, only one specific dialogue has
been considered. To get a more general view and
exclude effects which may depend rather on the
domain than on the culture, in future work other
dialogues from different domains should be exam-
ined. Furthermore, we have to identify how the de-
fined cultural idiosyncrasies may be implemented
in the Dialogue Management to design a culture-
sensitive spoken dialogue system.
