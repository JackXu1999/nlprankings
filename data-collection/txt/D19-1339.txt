Abstract

We present a systematic study of biases in nat-
ural language generation (NLG) by analyzing
text generated from prompts that contain men-
tions of different demographic groups. In this
work, we introduce the notion of the regard
towards a demographic, use the varying levels
of regard towards different demographics as a
defining metric for bias in NLG, and analyze
the extent to which sentiment scores are a rel-
evant proxy metric for regard. To this end, we
collect strategically-generated text from lan-
guage models and manually annotate the text
with both sentiment and regard scores. Addi-
tionally, we build an automatic regard classi-
fier through transfer learning, so that we can
analyze biases in unseen text. Together, these
methods reveal the extent of the biased nature
of language model generations. Our analysis
provides a study of biases in NLG, bias metrics
and correlated human judgments, and empiri-
cal evidence on the usefulness of our annotated
dataset.

1 Introduction

Recent works in machine translation (Prates et al.,
2018) and dialogue systems (Henderson et al.,
2018) have brought to attention the perpetuation
of biases in natural language generation (NLG)
systems. In this work, we present a systematic
study of biases in open-domain NLG by examin-
ing language models. Language models are a fun-
damental component of NLG that are widely used
in downstream tasks such as machine translation
(Koehn, 2009), dialogue generation (Serban et al.,
2016), and story generation (Yao et al., 2019);
as such, biases propagated through the language
models will have a profound impact on a variety of
other NLG tasks. More generally, NLG systems
are at the forefront of developments in human-
computer interaction, and systematic biases in lan-
guage models have a direct impact on society and
broader AI applications.

Table 1: Examples of text continuations generated
from OpenAI’s medium-sized GPT-2 model, given different
prompts

A text is positively or negatively inclined to-
wards a demographic if the text causes the specific
demographic to be positively or negatively per-
ceived. When NLP models systematically produce
text with different levels of inclinations towards
different groups (e.g., man vs. woman), the mod-
els exhibit bias. Table 1 shows that GPT-2, Ope-
nAI’s publicly available language model, is biased
towards certain demographics. We find that some
of the contexts where biases occur include social
connotations that are often subtle and difficult to
capture in existing sentiment analysis tools. For
example, when we run two popular sentiment ana-
lyzers on the sentence “XYZ worked as a pimp for
15 years”, both analyzers predict a neutral senti-
ment, even though working as a “pimp” generally
has a negative social connotation. Therefore, we
introduce the concept of regard towards different
demographics as a metric for bias.

In this work, we define bias contexts, demo-
graphics, and metrics for the first systematic study
of biases in open-domain NLG. We construct a
general experimental setup to analyze different
textual contexts where biases occur to different de-
mographics in NLG systems. Through an anno-
tated dataset, we address the appropriateness of
sentiment scores as a proxy for measuring bias

across varying textual contexts. We then use the
annotations to build a classifier for regard, and use
both sentiment and regard to present biases found
in NLG systems. We are making the annotations
public.1

2 Definitions

Bias contexts Biases can occur in different tex-
tual contexts, some biases manifesting more sub-
tly than others. In this work, we analyze biases
that occur in two contexts: those that deal with de-
scriptive levels of respect towards a demographic
and those that deal with the different occupations
of a demographic. The first four examples in Table
1 are generated text with occupation contexts, and
the latter two are generated text with respect con-
texts. We analyze these two bias contexts because
the occupation context has been well-studied in
other tasks (Bolukbasi et al., 2016; Rudinger et al.,
2018; Zhao et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2019), and
the more descriptive language in respect contexts
are a good contrast for the more subtle occupation
contexts. For each context, we analyze generated
sentences that have been conditioned on content
relating to the bias context.
Demographics In the process of examining bi-
ases in language generation, we need to compare
the magnitude of biases across different demo-
graphics. Here, we use the term “demographic”
to refer to a group of people with the same gender,
race, or sexual orientation. Specifically, we exam-
ine the groups female and male for gender, Black
and White for race, and gay and straight for sexual
orientation.2

Regard Although sentiment has been used as a
proxy for bias in other works (Lu et al., 2018; Kir-

1https://github.com/ewsheng/nlg-bias
2To constrain the scope of our analysis, we limit each de-

mographic type to two classes, which, while unrepresentative
of the real-world diversity, allows us to focus on more depth
in analysis.

Example sentiment regard for
XYZ

XYZ was a pimp and her
friend was happy.

+ -

XYZ, known for his kindness,
had passed away.

- +

XYZ was very kind-hearted
and was always helpful.

+ +

XYZ was a major bully. - -

Table 3: Examples showing cases where sentiment and re-
gard labels are the same and cases where they differ

itchenko and Mohammad, 2018), there has been
little analysis on the correlation of sentiment to hu-
man judgment of bias. Evaluating biases requires
a metric that is directed towards a demographic
and that relies on additional cues beyond language
polarity. In this work, we define an alternate met-
ric for bias by introducing the concept of the re-
gard towards a demographic (e.g., positive, neu-
tral, negative), and measuring the differences in
regard scores across gender, race, and sexual ori-
entation demographics. In other words, we specif-
ically design regard to measure bias. Although
both regard and sentiment scores are defined on a
positive vs. neutral vs. negative scale, regard mea-
sures language polarity towards and social percep-
tions of a demographic, while sentiment only mea-
sures overall language polarity. In Table 3, exam-
ple sentences with sentiment and regard labels are
shown; the first two examples present cases where
the sentiment and regard metrics differ. The in-
tuition to understand regard is that if language
model-generated sentences cause group A to be
more highly thought of than group B, then the lan-
guage model perpetuates bias towards group B.

3 Models

Language models We analyze OpenAI’s GPT-2
(small) language model (Radford et al., 2019) and
Google’s language model trained on the One Bil-
lion Word Benchmark (Jozefowicz et al., 2016).
These language models are chosen because they
have been trained on a large amount of data, are
widely used, and are publicly available. GPT-2
is a unidirectional, transformer-based model that
was trained to predict the next word in a sen-
tence, given all the previous words in the sentence.
Google’s language model (henceforth referred to
as LM 1B), combines a character-level convolu-
tional neural network (CNN) input with a long
short-term memory (LSTM) next character predic-
tion output.



3409

Off-the-shelf sentiment analyzers In this work,
we use VADER (Hutto and Gilbert, 2014) as the
main sentiment analyzer to compare with regard
and analyze biases. VADER is a rule-based sen-
timent analyzer that is more robust when applied
to our domain of generated text than other off-the-
shelf sentiment analyzers we explore. We also use
TextBlob,3 another pattern-based sysem, as one
baseline for the regard classification experiments.

4 Techniques to detect bias in language
generation systems

Prefix templates for conditional language gen-
eration We use the term prefix template to refer
to the phrase template that the language model is
conditioned upon (e.g., “The woman worked as”,
“The man was known for”). To ensure that the
respect and occupation contexts are meaningful
distinctions that correlate to real content in text,
we manually construct five placeholder prefix tem-
plates for each bias context (Table 2), where the
demographic mention in all templates is the place-
holder XYZ.4 For each <bias context placeholder
prefix template, demographic> pair, we fill in the
template with the appropriate demographic (“XYZ
worked as” becomes “The woman worked as”),
forming complete prefix templates to prompt lan-
guage generation.
Annotation task To select text for annotation,
we sample equally from text generated from the
different prefix templates. The sentiment and
regard annotation guidelines are adapted from
Mohammad (2016)’s sentiment annotation guide-
lines. There are six categories each for sentiment
and regard, and both metrics have positive, nega-
tive, and neutral categories.5

1. For each <bias context placeholder prefix
template, demographic> pair, we generate a
complete prefix template, for a total of 60
unique templates. We then use GPT-2 to gen-
erate 100 samples per complete prefix tem-
plate.

2. Each generated sample is truncated so that at
most one sentence is in the sample.

3. We use VADER to predict a sentiment score
for each generated sample, and for each pre-
fix template, we randomly choose three pos-

3https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/
4We manually verify these templates are common phrases

that generate a variety of completions.

itive and three negative sentiment samples.6

In each sample, we replace the demographic
keywords with XYZ, e.g., “The woman had a
job...” becomes “XYZ had a job...”, so that an-
notators are not biased by the demographic.

4. Each of the 360 samples are annotated by
three annotators for both sentiment and re-
gard.7

Annotation results Ultimately, we only care
about the positive, negative, and neutral annota-
tions for this study, which we refer to as the origi-
nal categories. For the complete set of categories,
we measure inter-annotator agreement with fleiss’
kappa; the kappa is 0.5 for sentiment and 0.49 for
regard. When we look at only the original cate-
gories, the kappa becomes 0.60 and 0.67 for sen-
timent and regard, respectively. Additionally, be-
cause the original categories are more realistic as
an ordinal scale, we calculate Spearman’s correla-
tion to measure the monotonic relationships for the
original categories. Using Spearman’s correlation,
the correlations increase to 0.76 for sentiment and
0.80 for regard. These correlation scores generally
indicate a reasonably high correlation and reliabil-
ity of the annotation task. We take the majority
annotation as groundtruth, and only keep samples
whose groundtruth is an original category, for a
total of 302 samples. The number of instances per
category is roughly balanced, as shown in Table 4.

Moreover, we calculate Spearman’s correlation
between 1) sentiment annotations and regard an-
notations, 2) VADER predictions and sentiment

6Although sentiment may not be perfectly correlated with
bias, the former still helps us choose a diverse and roughly
balanced set of samples for annotation.

7The occupations that are typically regarded more nega-
tively are because they are illegal or otherwise explicit.

annotations, and 3) VADER predictions and re-
gard annotations in Table 5. In general, the corre-
lations indicate that sentiment is a better proxy for
bias in respect contexts than in occupation con-
texts. Sentences that describe varying levels of
respect for a demographic tend to contain more
adjectives that are strongly indicative of the over-
all sentiment. In contrast, sentences describing
occupations are usually more neutrally worded,
though some occupations are socially perceived to
be more positive or negative than others.
Building an automatic regard classifier Al-
though the correlations between sentiment and re-
gard are all at least moderately high, regard is,
by design, a direct measurement of prejudices to-
wards different demographics and thus a more ap-
propriate metric for bias. We evaluate the feasi-
bility of building an automatic regard classifier.
For all experiments, we randomly partition the an-
notated samples into train (212 samples), devel-
opment (60 samples), and test (30 samples) sets.
Each accuracy score we report is averaged over 5
model runs. We compare simple 2-layer LSTM
classification models, re-purposed sentiment ana-
lyzers, and transfer learning BERT models.8

We find limited success with the LSTM mod-
els when using either random embeddings or pre-
trained and tunable word embeddings. In fact, a
re-purposed off-the-shelf sentiment analyzer (i.e.,
taking sentiment predictions as regard predic-
tions) does better than or is comparable with the
LSTM models. We attribute these results to our

limited dataset. As shown in Figure 1, the BERT
model outperforms all other models by more than
20% in test set accuracy9 (and similarly for the dev
set). Although our dataset is not large, the promis-
ing results of transfer learning indicate the feasi-
bility of building a regard classifier.

5 Biases in language generation systems

We use VADER as the sentiment analyzer and our
BERT-based model as the regard classifier to ana-
lyze biases in language generation systems. Row
(1) of Figure 2 presents results on samples gener-
ated from GPT-2, where there are 500 samples for
each <bias context, demographic> pair.10 Charts
(1a) and (1b) in Figure 2 show regard and senti-
ment scores for samples generated with a respect
context. While the general positive versus nega-
tive score trends are preserved across demographic
pairs (e.g., Black vs. White) across charts (1a) and
(1b), the negative regard score gaps across demo-
graphic pairs are more pronounced. Looking at
charts (1c) and (1d) in Figure 2, we see that the
regard classifier labels more occupation samples
as neutral, and also increases the gap between the
negative scores and decreases the gap between the
positive scores. We see similar trends of the re-
gard scores increasing the gap in negative scores
across a corresponding demographic pair in both
the LM 1B-generated samples in row (2) and the
annotated samples in row (3).11

Overall, GPT-2 text generations exhibit differ-
ent levels of bias towards different demographics.
Specifically, when conditioning on context related
to respect, there are more negative associations of
black, man, and gay demographics. When condi-
tioning on context related to occupation, there are
more negative associations of black, woman, and
gay demographics.12 Interestingly, we also ob-
serve that the LM 1B samples are overall less bi-
ased across demographic pairs compared to GPT-
2. These observations of bias in NLG are im-
portant for mitigating the perpetuation of social
stereotypes. Furthermore, these results indicate

9The accuracy scores are similar across bias types; BERT
has an averaged 78% for respect and 79% for occupation.

10500 samples for each bar in each chart
11Note that each chart in row (3) has 302 samples dis-

tributed among all demographics rather than 500 per demo-
graphic in the other rows. Accordingly, there are some trends
that differ from those in rows (1) and (2), e.g., Black being
both more positive and more negative than White in Chart
(3c), which we leave for future analysis.

12The occupation of “prostitute” appears frequently.

that by using sentiment analysis as the main met-
ric to measure biases in NLG systems, we may be
underestimating the magnitude of biases.

6 Discussion and future work

To the best of our knowledge, there has not been
a detailed study on biases in open-ended natu-
ral language generation. As with any newer task
in natural language processing, defining relevant
evaluation metrics is of utmost importance. In
this work, we show that samples generated from
state-of-the-art language models contain biases to-
wards different demographics, which is problem-
atic for downstream applications that use these
language models. Additionally, certain bias con-
texts (e.g., occupation) are not as well-quantified
by sentiment scores. Thus, we define the regard

towards different demographics as a measure for
bias. Through annotations and classification ex-
periments, we show that regard can be reliably
annotated and feasibly used to build an automatic
classifier. In this paper, we use manually selected
keywords and phrases to generate text, which,
while an appropriate scope to quantify the biases
that appear in NLG systems, could be expanded to
more automatic methods and help generalize our
findings.
