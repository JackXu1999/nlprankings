Abstract

This paper presents RuSentiment, a new dataset for sentiment analysis of social media posts in
Russian, and a new set of comprehensive annotation guidelines that are extensible to other lan-
guages. RuSentiment is currently the largest in its class for Russian, with 31,185 posts annotated
with Fleiss’ kappa of 0.58 (3 annotations per post). To diversify the dataset, 6,950 posts were
pre-selected with an active learning-style strategy. We report baseline classification results, and
we also release the best-performing word embeddings trained on 3.2B corpus of Russian social
media posts.

1 Introduction

Over the past several years sentiment analysis has been increasingly important in political science (Ceron
et al., 2015) and journalism (Jiang et al., 2017). Such applications necessitate resources for languages
spoken in the conflict zones. Our study focuses on Russian, which to date has little annotated data
(Loukachevitch and Rubtsova, 2016; Koltsova et al., 2016), and no openly available sentiment detection
systems beyond the dictionary-based ones. However, lexical features have time and again shown inferior
performance compared to the supervised learning approaches using annotated data (Gombar et al., 2017),
and lack of such a resource severely limits sentiment analysis applications for Russian.

We present RuSentiment, a dataset of public posts on VKontakte (VK), the largest Russian social
network that currently boasts about 100M monthly active users.1 RuSentiment was developed with
new comprehensive guidelines that enabled light and speedy annotation while maintaining consistent
coverage of a wide range of explicitly and implicitly expressed sentiment. The overall inter-annotator
agreement in terms of Fleiss’ kappa stands at 0.58. In total, 31,185 posts were annotated, 21,268 of
which were selected randomly (including 2,967 for the test set). 6,950 posts were pre-selected with an
active learning-style strategy in order to diversify the data. This makes RuSentiment the largest openly
available sentiment dataset for social media, and the largest general domain sentiment dataset for this
relatively low-resource language.

We also present baseline classification results on the new dataset. The best results were achieved with
a neural network model that made use of word embeddings trained on the VKontakte corpus, which we
also release to enable a fair comparison with our baselines in future work. This model achieved an F1
score of 0.728 in a 5-class classification setup. The dataset, the source code for the baseline classifiers,
and the in-domain word embeddings are available at the project website2.

2 Related Work

Russian is generally not as well resourced as English, and that includes the sentiment analysis data.
RuSentiLex, the largest sentiment lexicon for Russian3 (Loukachevitch and Levchik, 2016), currently
contains 16,057 words, which exceeds the size of such manually constructed English resources as, for
example, SentiStrength (Thelwall and Buckley, 2013). However, there is nothing like SentiWordNet
(Baccianella et al., 2010), SentiWords, (Gatti et al., 2016), or SenticNet (Cambria et al., 2018) for Rus-
sian.

There are also few annotated datasets. The datasets from the SentiRuEval 2015 and 2016 competi-
tions are the largest resource that has been available to date (Loukachevitch and Rubtsova, 2016). The
SentiRuEval 2016 dataset is comprised by 10,890 tweets from the telecom domain and 12,705 from the
banking domain. The Linis project (Koltsova et al., 2016) reports to have crowdsourced annotation for
19,831 blog excerpts, but only 3,327 are currently available on the project website.

The choice of VK social network makes RuSentiment qualitatively different from the above resources.
Unlike Linis, it contains standalone mini-texts, and unlike SentiRuEval, the postings vary by length and
were not pre-selected by topic. We also found the VK data used for our RuSentiment to be more noisy
than SentiRuEval tweets.4 RuSentiment thus fills an existing gap, providing a large annotated dataset of
general-domain posts from the largest Russian social network.

3 Annotation

Our VK data was originally collected for research on political bias, and contained the posts from the
personal “walls” (i.e., posts on personal pages) of the users that were members of anti-Maidan and pro-
Maidan communities during the 2014 Maidan conflict in Ukraine. RuSentiment only includes the posts
that were posted outside these communities, and do not contain political keywords.5 No pre-selection by
topic makes RuSentiment currently the largest manually annotated general domain sentiment dataset for
Russian, exceeded in size only by automatically annotated silver dataset by Rubtsova (2015).

To remove noisy posts, we used the following selection criteria. The posts included in the dataset were
10-800 characters in length, at least 50% of which were alphabetical, and at least 30% used the Russian
Cyrillic alphabet. URLs and VK postcards were excluded. To ensure the meaningfulness of the posts, we
also excluded any posts with over 4 hashtags or less than 2 comments. RuSentiment is distributed without
VK post ids, and only includes posts that were posted publicly.6 The annotation was performed by six
native speakers with backgrounds in linguistics over the course of 5 months. The average annotation
speed was 250-350 posts per hour. A screenshot of our custom web-interface is shown in Figure 1.

3.1 Annotation Policy

Despite the popularity of the sentiment task, the problem of developing comprehensive, yet easy to follow
and “light” guidelines that would ensure high enough agreement is far from being solved. Sentiment is
an extremely multi-faceted phenomenon, and each research team in the end has to make its own choices
about how it would prefer to treat implicit vs. explicit sentiment, subjective feeling and emotion vs.
evaluation, and also irony, sarcasm, and other types of mixed sentiment.

We aimed to develop comprehensive guidelines that would cover the most frequent potentially am-
biguous cases and would be easy to apply consistently. Most of the categories we have used have been
defined and used before (Liu, 2015; Toprak et al., 2010; Wiebe et al., 2005; Thelwall et al., 2010), and
our contribution is mainly their combination that enabled the right balance between coverage and ease
of application.

3There are at least two more projects that attempt to crowdsource sentiment lexicons: SentiBase (http://
web-corpora.net/wsgi/senti\_game.wsgi/rules), and Sentimeter (http://sentimeter.ru/assess/
instruction/). At the moment, both appear to be unfinished.

4Baldwin et al. (2013) did not find significant grammatical or spelling differences between Twitter, Youtube comments, or
blogs, but domain (telecom in SentiRuEval) could impact the ratio of professionally edited commercial or news-like texts.

5The list comprised 169 keywords, including political entities (such as Moscow or Putin) and words coined and used during
the Maidan conflict (such as ukrop “dill”, a Russian derogatory term for Ukrainians).

6This work is covered by an IRB protocol at the authors’ institution.

Figure 1: Annotation web-interface.

Finding this point of balance required multiple pilots and extensive linguistic analysis. This difficulty
is likely the reason why many sentiment annotation projects, including the Russian crowdsourced ini-
tiatives mentioned in Section 2, provide only minimal annotation instructions. Such instructions often
yield very inconsistent data. Our guidelines are available at the project website in English, with Russian
examples.7 We hope that they would be useful for subsequent work in other languages and domains.

We prioritized the speed of annotation over detail, opting for a 3-point scale rather than e.g., the 5-
point scale in SemEval Twitter datasets (Rosenthal et al., 2017). Thus, the task was to rate the prevailing
sentiment in complete posts from VK on a three-point scale (“negative", “neutral”, and “positive”). We
also defined the “skip” class for excluding the posts that were too noisy, unclear, or not in Russian (e.g.,
in Ukrainian). We also made the decision to exclude jokes, poems, song lyrics, and other such content
that was not generated by the users themselves. It could be argued that posting jokes on social media
should be interpreted as an expression of positive mood, but such data is easy to import from existing
web collections.

Although the only sentiment classes we annotated are “positive” and “negative”, RuSentiment guide-
lines address both explicit and implicit forms of expressions for the speaker’s internal emotional state
(mood) and external attitude (evaluation), as shown in Table 1. These distinctions are often not ac-
counted for in sentiment data, including many of the English datasets (Volkova et al., 2013; Abdul-
Mageed and Ungar, 2017). The guidelines cover such cases of implicit sentiment as rhetorical questions,
(non-)desirability, recommendations, and descriptions or mentions of the experiences that most people
would consider positive or negative.

Additionally, we defined a subcategory of positive posts that covers frequent speech acts, such as
expressions of gratitude, greetings, and congratulations. They are very frequent in VK data, and the
sentiment they express is overtly positive, but they are also very formulaic. The separate subcategory
enables excluding them from the category of positive posts, depending on the practical goals of the
analysis. In our binary classification experiments, we chose to exclude this category.

The neutral posts were defined as those that describe something in a matter-of-fact way, without clear
sentiment (e.g., That’s a girl I know.) They also included factual questions, commercial information, plot
summaries, descriptions, etc..

We opted to not define a separate “mixed sentiment” class, as this would not be particularly useful,
and is also difficult for models to capture (Liu, 2015, p. 77). All cases of mixed sentiment were annotated
as either negative or positive. To improve consistency, the guidelines covered 7 frequent cases of mixed
sentiment. For example, irony was annotated with the dominant (usually negative) sentiment (e.g. I

Mode
Target Emotional state Attitude towards some entity

Explicit
• direct statement of one’s mood, emotions,
feelings - either positive or negative
e.g., УРРРРААААААА!!!!!! ))))

Hooray!!!!!! ))))

• direct statement of one’s positive or negative
attitude towards the target
e.g., годный дабстеп, очень годный.

That’s fairly decent dubstep.

• descriptions of experience that most
people would consider positive or negative

So how am I supposed to find it now?

• expressing (non-)desirability of the target,

broke my heels and got drenched on the way back. What a great day.) Generally neutral posts with some
positive formulaic language were annotated as neutral (e.g. Looking to buy a used electric guitar. Please
share this post. Thank you, and have a great day!) In cases of conflict between a speaker’s emotional
state and their attitude towards something, we annotated the mood of the speaker. For example, I miss
you expresses the sadness of the speaker while also implying their high opinion of the addressee, and is
annotated as negative.

Hashtags such as #epicentr (company name) were considered neutral, but those that could agree or
disagree with the general sentiment of the post were treated as sentiment markers. This concerned the
hashtags that expressed the sentiment explicitly (e.g. #ihate, #sad) or implicitly, via experiences that
most people would consider positive or negative (e.g. #beach, #party).

The annotators were instructed to not treat the emoticons as automatic sentiment labels, as done by Go
et al. (2009), Davidov et al. (2010), Sahni et al. (2017), and others. Some emoticons do indeed strengthen
the message (Derks et al., 2008), but others serve to soften its illocutionary force without changing its
content (Ernst and Huschens, 2018).8 A user may end a post with a “hedging” emoticon just to express
friendliness or politeness, and we found that often to be the case for VK data. Therefore, emoticons were
not taken into account when no sentiment was expressed verbally or when they aligned with the content
of the message. Emoticons were considered relevant only when they contradicted the verbal clues of
sentiment. In that case, the annotators were instructed to annotate the dominant overall sentiment of the
post, including the emoticons.

In total, five categories were annotated: “Neutral”, “Negative”, “Positive”, “Speech Act”, and “Skip”.

3.2 Annotating Randomly Selected Posts

In the first stage, 18,453 randomly selected posts were annotated. Fleiss’ kappa for three annotators
in this sample constituted 0.654. A post was deemed to belong to a class if at least 2 of 3 annotators
attributed it to that class. The class distribution is as follows: 41.3% neutral posts, 10.3% negative and
20.5% positive posts, and 9.4% skipped, with an additional 13.9% posts in the speech acts category.
In 4.6% cases, all three annotators disagreed, and we included them in the skipped class as unclear.
Furthermore, we annotated 2,967 random posts to create a test set (Fleiss’ kappa is 0.604).

4 Experiments

4.1 Baseline model selection

We experimented with several classifiers of different types, including logistic regression, linear SVM,
and gradient boosting classifier (Pedregosa et al., 2011). We also implemented a simple neural network
classifier (NNC) consisting of four fully-connected layers with non-linear activation functions between

and Yus (2014).

Table 2: Classifier performance with different post representa-
tions on 5-class classification (20,896 random posts).

The posts were represented either with a
sparse TF-IDF representation (Manning et al.,
2008) or as an average of word vectors for the
constituent tokens. Averaging is by no means
the only way to combine word vectors to obtain
a representation of a sentence (Mitchell and La-
pata, 2010; Baroni et al., 2014; Socher et al.,
2012; Hill et al., 2016), but it is one of the com-
putationally cheapest options that still encodes a
non-trivial amount of information about the sen-
tences (Adi et al., 2016). FastText (Bojanowski
et al., 2017) was chosen for its capacity to repre-
sent subword information. This is beneficial for
a morphologically rich language such as Rus-
sian, especially with a corpus that is as noisy and
full of misspellings as our VK corpus.

We performed experiments using the pub-
lished FastText embeddings trained on Com-
monCrawl (CC)11 and on Russian Wikipedia12

(Wiki). We also trained our own embeddings on 3.2B tokens of VK data. The training corpus included
the posts that are part of RuSentiment, but they constitute less than 0.001% of the data. We trained these
embeddings with the default FastText parameters, with vector size 300 and minimum frequency 100.
Table 2 shows the performance in 5-way classification, for the models trained using the 20,896 posts
annotated without active learning. The best accuracy was achieved by the NNC classifier. The in-domain
VK embeddings consistently improved performance of all models, as could be expected.

4.2 Active Learning Data Selection Strategy

Unbalanced datasets present difficulties in classification, especially when the classes of interest – in this
case, positive and negative sentiment – are in the minority. With the setup described in Section 4.1

we conducted preliminary experiments with 13,764 posts for training and 3,441 for testing13. In these
preliminary experiments, the best-performing model (NNC) reached an F1 of 0.637 for the positive class
vs. the rest and F1 of 0.550 for negative vs. the rest in binary classification. The recall was very low,
0.477 and 0.587, respectively). Figure 2 shows that the distribution of correct labels in each probability
bin was nearly even, which suggests that the classifier did not have a well-formed representation of the
target class. For example, the number of examples correctly assigned to the negative polarity class with
probability of 0.9 was nearly equal to the number of misclassified negative polarity examples which were
assigned the probability of 0.1. Although there were twice as many training examples, the same trend
was present for the positive polarity posts.

To provide the classifier with more examples that it was unsure about, we used NNC to pre-select
additional 3,500 “negative” and 2,500 “positive” posts with certainty sampling (Koncz and Paralič, 2013;
Fu et al., 2013). We drew an equal number of samples from the probability bins 0.3-0.7, annotating
additional 6,950 posts.

Figure 3 shows that the distribution of posi-
tive posts in the pre-selected sample turned
out to be similar to the original one. How-
ever, the classifier was successful in reduc-
ing the number of skipped and speech act
posts, and the ratio of negative posts in-
creased.

Fleiss’ kappa for the pre-selected sam-
ple was much lower (0.449), bringing the
overall number down. The reason was the
higher ratio of posts with agreement of two,
rather than three annotators. We interpret
this as success in bringing more borderline and diverse cases into the dataset, even at the cost of the
overall agreement.

In order to investigate the effects of
adding the pre-selected sample to the
dataset, we conducted additional 5-way
classification experiments using NNC and
VK embeddings. Table 3 shows the com-
parison between the model trained on all
the randomly selected examples and the
model trained on the data in which 6,950
randomly selected examples were replaced
with the ones pre-selected with the active learning strategy described above.14 Replacing randomly se-
lected examples with pre-selected ones yielded consistent, albeit small, improvement, with the recall
being affected the most. Table 3 also shows that the 5-way classification results using the full training
data, including the pre-selected sample, produces the best results. The performance is averaged across
three runs.

4.4 Error Analysis

Figure 4 presents the confusion matrices for RuSentiment test set with the NNC classifier trained in two
settings: (a) using the base randomly selected posts only, and (b) using the additional posts pre-selected
with active learning. There is a clear shift in the distribution of neutral and negative posts. Compared to

13These samples do not intersect with the final test set.
14An additional 463 randomly selected examples were included in this experiment and are released in the final dataset. Out

of these, 372 examples were added to the training set and 91 to the test set. These data came in late from the annotation team,
and additional experiments confirmed that they did not affect the overall pattern of model performance.

the classifier trained only on randomly selected posts, the classifier trained on the entire dataset makes
more errors misclassifying neutral and, to a lesser degree, skipped posts as negative. This suggests that
the pre-selected sample makes the classifier more sensitive to borderline cases, since their amount is
increased. Interestingly, the positive posts category was not affected in the same way, presumably due to
the larger amount of positive posts in the base data.

5 Conclusion

We presented RuSentiment, a new general domain sentiment dataset for Russian social media, built with
data from VK, Russia’s largest social network. RuSentiment includes 31,185 posts, each carrying 3
annotations with Fleiss’ kappa of 0.58, and is currently the largest openly available dataset of its class
for Russian. RuSentiment was developed with new guidelines that enabled light, speedy and consistent
5-class annotation of explicit and implicit sentiment, and could be adapted for other languages.

We also presented 4 baseline models using FastText word embeddings as well as TF-IDF represen-
tation. The best performance was F1 of 0.728 in 5-class classification. It was achieved by a neural net
classifier with in-domain FastText embeddings, which we release to enable fair comparison with future
systems.
