How can we adapt generation to the users cognitive load?

Abstract

As language-based interaction becomes more ubiquitous and is used by in a
larger and larger variety of different situations, the challenge for NLG systems is
to not only convey a certain message correctly, but also do so in a way that is ap-
propriate to the situation and the user. From various studies, we know that humans
adapt the way they formulate their utterances to their conversational partners and
may also change the way they say things as a function of the situation that the
conversational partner is in (e.g. while talking to someone who is driving a car).
Approaches from psycholinguistics (using information-theoretic measures as well
as other complexity metrics) provide a way to formulate and quantify the demands
that a certain formulation places on a hearer. In this talk, I will briefly survey ways
of assessing human cognitive load in realistic settings, present current models of
information density at the content level, and discuss the extent to which these mea-
sures have been found to drive choice of formulation in humans.
