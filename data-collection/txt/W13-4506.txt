Abstract

This paper clarifies the occurrence fac-
tors of commuters unable to return home
and the returning-home decision-making
at the time of the Great East Japan Earth-
quake by using Twitter data. First, to ex-
tract the behavior data from the tweet data,
we identify each user’s returning-home
behavior using support vector machines.
Second, we create non-verbal explanatory
factors using geotag data and verbal ex-
planatory factors using tweet data. Then,
we model users’ returning-home decision-
making by using a discrete choice model
and clarify the factors quantitatively. Fi-
nally, by sensitivity analysis, we show the
effects of the existence of emergency evac-
uation facilities and line of communica-
tion.

1 Introduction

The 2011 earthquake off the Pacific coast of To-
hoku, often referred to in Japan as the Great East
Japan Earthquake, was a magnitude 9.0 under sea
megathrust earthquake that occurred at 14:46JST
(05:46 UTC) on March 11, 2011. The focal re-
gion of this earthquake was widespread, spanning
approximately 500 km north to south from off the
Ibaraki shore to the Iwate shore and approximately
200km east to west. The number of deaths and
missing persons attributed to this disaster totaled
more than 19,000, and the complex, large-scale
disasters of the earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear
power plant accident had a major impact on peo-
ple’s lives. The Tokyo metropolitan area also was
hit by a strong earthquake and various traffic prob-
lems occurred. For example, many railway and
subway services were suspended for maintenance.
Therefore, almost every railway and subway user
was unable to return home easily, and they were

called “victims unable to return home.” According
to (Measures Council for Victims Unable to Re-
turn Home by Earthquake that directly hits Tokyo
Area, 2012), the number of people who were not
able to go home during that day by paralysis of
these transport networks is estimated about 5.15
million people and it is 30% of a going-out people
of the day.

Assessing the problem of “victims unable to
return home” in Tokyo metropolitan area is ex-
tremely important for anti-disaster measures. Al-
though the questionnaire is performed ex post,
it is not yet shown clearly what made going-
home decision-making after the earthquake disas-
ter. Moreover, since it was going-home behavior
in big confusion, the problem that detailed time
and position information are unknown exist.

Some previously studies have examined human
behaviors via analysis of behavior log data at the
time of a large-scale disaster. Because no rapid
and accurate method existed to track population
movements after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti,
(Bengtsson et al., 2011) used position data from
subscriber identity module (SIM) cards from the
largest mobile phone company in Haiti to estimate
the magnitude and trends of population move-
ments after the 2010 Haiti earthquake and the
subsequent cholera outbreak. Their results indi-
cated that estimates of population movements dur-
ing disasters and outbreaks can be acquired rapidly
and with potentially high validity in areas of high
mobile phone usage. (Lu et al., 2012) also used the
same data in Haiti to determine that 19 days after
the earthquake, population movements had caused
the population of the capital Port-au-Prince to de-
crease by approximately 23% and that the destina-
tions of people who left the capital during the first
three weeks after the earthquake were highly cor-
related with their mobility patterns during normal
times and specifically with the locations of people
with whom they had significant social bonds. Lu

et al. concluded that population movements dur-
ing disasters may be significantly more predictable
than previously thought. Overall, these previous
studies clarified human movement over long pe-
riods of time. They showed that people in areas
affected by an earthquake take refuge temporarily
and that the population in the affected area is re-
covered over several months. Behavior log data
should be able to clarify not only such long-term
human behavior but also the human behaviors at
the time of a disaster.

In this research, we analyze tweet data of Twit-
ter as the behavior log data at the time of the Great
East Japan Earthquake. Although tweet data does
not contain actual behavior necessarily, there is
possibility of containing thinking process and be-
havioral factors. We clarify the factors of going-
home behavior in case of the Great East Japan
Earthquake using Twitter data.

2 From Tweet Data To Behavioral Data

2.1 Framework

First, we provide a framework of this research to
analyze users’ going-home behavior using tweet
data and geotag data. Figure 1 shows our frame-
work: (1) behavior inference by tweet data,(2) fea-
ture engineering by geotag and tweet data, (3) es-
timation of behavioral model.

In (1) behavior inference by tweet data part,
we inferred users’ going-home behavior result us-
ing Support vector machine (SVM) and Bag-Of-
Words (BOW) representation. In (2) feature engi-
neering by geotag and tweet data part, we made
explanatory factors of users’ behavior from tweet
data and geotag data. In (3) estimation of be-
havioral model part, we estimated users’ behavior
model (discrete choice model).

2.2 Data

In this section, we provide an outline of our data.
This data is about 180-million tweet by Japanese
in Twitter from March 11, 2011 to March 18,
2011. There are about 280 thousands tweet with
geotag in this data. We sampled tweets whose
timestamp is from 14:00, March 11 to 10:00,
March 12 and whose GPS location is within Tokyo
metropolitan area. The number of these tweet is
24,737 and the number of unique users (account)
is 5,281. To observe users’ trip on the day, we ex-
tracted users that had over 2 geotag tweet and the
number of users is 3,307. We assume that these

users can tweet about the Great East Japan Earth-
quake and their going-home behavior. Therefore,
we analyzed all tweet of these users from 14:00,
March 11 to 10:00 (3,307 users, 132, 989 tweets).

We tagged 300 users’ going-home behavior re-
sult manually to make supervised data. Our label
set is composed of 1) going home by foot, 2) by
train, 3) staying their offices or hotels until tomor-
row morning, 4) other choice (taxi, bus, etc.), 5)
unclear.

2.3 Morphological analysis

Next, we give morphological analysis by MeCab
and obtained BOW representation by each user’s
tweet. To find the relationship between going-
home behavior and each user’s tweet, we use in-
formation gain. Information gain is index which
shows decreasing degree of each class’s entropy
by existing word w. If word w is contained each
user’s tweet, Random variableXw equals 1 and
otherwise Xw = 0. Random variables which in-
dicates each class is c and entropy H(c) is written
as

H(C) = −
∑

c

P (c) log P (c). (1)

And conditional entropy is written as

H(c|Xw = 1) = −
∑

c

P (c|Xw = 1) log P (c|Xw = 1)

H(c|Xw = 0) = −
∑

c

P (c|Xw = 0) log P (c|Xw = 0).

Information gain IG(w) of word w is defined as
average decreasing entropy and written as

IG(w) = H(c) − (P (Xw = 1)H(c|Xw = 1) +
P (Xw = 0)H(c|Xw = 0)) (2)

formation gain is high

2)by train 田園都市線 (Denen-toshi line)奇跡 (miracle)

混雑 (congested)検索 (search) JR (JR line)
乗車 (take a train)満員 (full capacity)

3)stay 明け (daylight)暇 (a spare time)
始発 (first train in the morning)悩む (worry)

4)other Twitpic
5)unclear jishin，skype

We calculated all words information gain
IG(w) by 5 class (walk, train, stay, other, un-
clear). Table 1 shows illustrative examples.
For example, words whose conditional probabil-
ity of walking is high are “half”, “far”, “km”,
“Kawasaki” and “Kannana Street”. They show
user’s location. And “toilet”, “tired” and “dan-
ger” indicates psychological factors during going-
home by foot.

In the case of train, “miracle”, “luckily” is con-
tained and “O-edo line” and “Denen-toshi line”
are the train and subway lines which is operated
in March 11. In the case of stay, “morning”, “day-
light” and “sleep” indicates that users slept at ho-
tel or their offices and “first train in the morn-
ing”, “worry” and “search” shows their going-
home timing. Other choices users, who choose bi-
cycle, taxi etc, and unclear users don’t show the
understandable tendency. However, they submit-
ted pictures for Twitpic, which is photo share site,
and tweeted with #jishin hashtag.

As seen above, the words whose information
gain is high is useful to infer their going-home
behavior. Therefore, we made classifier by using
these words as features.

2.4 SVM and behavior inference

In this section, we infer each user’s behavioral re-
sult by SVM. we use 300 labeled data as super-
vised data and we treat top 500 words of informa-
tion gain as features of SVM. In learning, we did
9-fold cross validation and average accuracy rate
is 73.3%.

train is 359, the number of users staying is 385,
the number of users by other choice is 15 and the
number of users whose choice is unclear is 635.
This result indicates that the ratio of all going-
home users except unclear users is 84, 9%.

To discuss the accuracy of this inference re-
sult, we compare our result with other survey re-
sults. Figure 2 shows the survey result by (Sur-
vey Research Center, 2011) and the survey result
by (Yuhashi, 2012). The result of Survey Re-
search Center says 80.1% of all could get home
and the result of Yuhashi says 78.6% of all could
get home.

3 Behavioral Analysis

3.1 Non-verval factors

Based on the prediction of going-home decision-
making classified by user, nonverbal / verbal ex-
planation factor is created from tweet data or geo-
tag data, and the factor of each individual’s going-
home decision-making is analyzed.

First, the explanation factor about travel behav-
ior is created using the geotag data classified by
user. In this research, for simplicity, we assume
that a position before the earthquake is the lo-
cation of office (origin) and a position of 12:00,
March 12, 2011 is the location of home (destina-
tion). Next, road network distance, the on foot
time required, the station nearest office, the station
nearest home, the railroad time required, railroad
expense, and the number of times of a railroad
change are created using these GPS data. These
are the features created using the network at the
time of usual.

In order to express a spatial spread of people’s
going-home behavior, Figure 3, 4 shows the spa-
tial dstribution of users’ location of before the
earthquake and the next day of the earthquake by
plotting each user’s geotag. As an overall trend,
office distribution and house distribution are spa-
tially different, and home distribution is spread in

Next, the cross tabulation result of going-home

decision-making by the road network distance be-
tween offices and houses is shown in Figure 5.
This result indicates that the rate of on foot de-
creases relatively as distance with a house be-
comes long, but 50% or more of people got home
on foot if their distance is 20 km over.

3.2 Verbal factors

Finally, a verbal explanation factor is gener-
ated. Since it is surmised that a family’s exis-
tence and with or without information has affected
going-home decision-making, the factor which af-
fects going-home decision-making behavior is ex-
tracted from each user’s tweet.

First, we analyze the effect of a safety check
with a family. In this research, the family was
defined as a spouse and children living together.
And 353 of 3,307 persons had spoken existence
of a family living together. We extracted safety
check tweet such as “I got e-mail from my wife!
I felt easy,”, “The telephone led to the wife and
the daughter at last! ” and “My telephone is not
connected to my son’s nursery school. ”

Figure 6, 7 shows the time zone rate of the
safety checked tweet and the safety unidentified
tweet according to going-home decision making.

Safety checked tweets are concentrated before

Figure 5: The relationship between going-home
behavior and the distance

18:00 (42% of on foot, 45% of by train, and 65%
of stay). Safety unidentified tweets are also con-
centrated before 18:00. We assume that the safety
unidentified tweets are strongly reflecting each in-
dividual’s psychological state because they can
perform every time zone until safety checked. If
we assume that the tweet in a earlier time zone is
more important for each user, an on foot going-
home person will regard his/her family’s safety
unidentified situation as more questionable than a
railroad going-home person, and he may make de-
cision of going-home by foot.

Next, the relationship between the information
of train operation again and going-home decision-
making is analyzed. The train line on the day was
resumed one by one after 20:40. It is dependent
on the acquisition existence of railroad resump-
tion information whether he stays in his office or
he goes home using the resumed railroad. Figure
8 shows the relationship between the rate of rail-

to speak of railroad resumption information.

Finally, we analyze the relationship between
individual psychological factor and going-home
decision-making. On March 11, many utterances
about their mental situation were seen. Figure
9 shows the utterance rate of uneasy and going-
home decision-making result. Interestingly, indi-
viduals whose utterance rate of uneasy is under
5% tend to stay at office or hotel but people whose
utterance rate of uneasy is over 5% tend to go
home by foot. This results shows the person who
felt fear tend to walk to home.

4 Behavioral Model

4.1 Discrete choice model

We built discrete choice model based on the ex-
planatory variable generated in 3. Discrete choice
model is a statistical model used in fields, such as
econometrics, travel behavior analysis, and mar-
keting, and is also called Random utility model
((Ben-Akiva and Lerman, 1985); (Train, 2003)).
In this research, Multinomial Logit Model (MNL)
is used and it is the most fundamental model in a
discrete choice model.

Discrete choice models describe decision mak-

ers’ choices among alternatives. A decision
maker, labeled n, faces a choice among J alterna-
tives. The decision maker would obtain a certain
level of utility from each alternative. The utility
that decision maker n obtains from alternative j is
Unj , j = 1, . . . , J . This utility is known to the
decision maker but not, as we see in the following,
by the researcher. The decision maker chooses the
alternative that provides the greatest utility. The
behavioral model is therefore: choose alternative i
if and only if Uni > Unj , ∀j ̸= i.

Consider now the researcher. The researcher
does not observe the decision maker’s utility. The
researcher observes some attributes of the alter-
natives as faced by the decision maker, labeled
xnj ∀j, and some attributes of the decision maker,
labeled sn, and can specify a function that relates
these observed factors to the decision maker’s util-
ity. The function is denoted Vnj = V (xnj , sn) ∀j
and is often called representative utility. Usually,
V depends on parameters that are unknown to the
researcher and therefore estimated statistically.

Since there are aspects of utility that the re-
searcher does not or cannot observe, Vnj = Unj .
Utility is decomposed as Unj = Vnj + εnj , where
εnj captures the factors that affect utility but are
not included in Vnj . This decomposition is fully
general.

The researcher does not know εnj ∀j and there-
fore treats these terms as random. The joint den-
sity of the random vector εn = (εn1, . . . , εnJ) is
denoted f(εnj). With this density, the researcher
can make probabilistic statements about the deci-
sion maker’s choice. The probability that decision

48



maker n chooses alternative i is

Pni = Pr(Uni > Unj ∀j ̸= i)
= Pr(Vni + εni > Vnj + εnj ∀j ̸= i)
= Pr(Vni − Vnj > εnj − εni ∀j ̸= i)(3)

This probability is a cumulative distribution,
namely, the probability that each random term
εnj−εni is below the observed quantity Vni−Vnj .
MNL model is derived under the assumption that
the unobserved portion of utility is distributed iid
extreme value.

f(εnj) = e
−εnje−e

F (εnj) = e
−e−εnj (5)

And decision maker n chooses alternative i is de-
rived as

Pni =

. (6)

This is choice probability of MNL model.

4.2 The setting of utility function

In discrete choice model, observed utility term Vni
is generally defined as Vni = β′xni. β is coeffi-
cient vector and xni is explanatory vector of deci-
sion maker n’s alternative i.

In this research, data set is 2672 samples identi-
fied by SVM except persons unclear and choice set
is on foot, train, other and stay. Explanatory vari-
ables of on foot are required time by foot, the ratio
of uneasy tweets and alternative specific constant.
Explanatory variables of train are required time by
train, log of the distance between office and home,
the ratio of train resumption tweets, the dummy
variables of family safety checked tweets and al-
ternative specific constant. Explanatory variables
of stay are the ratio of uneasy tweets, the ratio of
waiting position tweets, the dummy variables of
family safety checked tweets and alternative spe-
cific constant. We normalized the utility of other
to 0.

Next, we outlines the estimation method of the
coefficient parameter of a utility function. MNL
model’s likelihood function is written as

LL(β) =
N∑

n=1

∑
i

δni ln Pni (7)

where δni is Kronecker delta if decision maker n
choice i, δni = 1 and otherwise δni = 0. This

likelihood function is globally concave (McFad-
den, 1974). Therefore, parameters can be esti-
mated uniquely with a maximum likelihood esti-
mation.

4.3 the results and simulation

Under the above setting, the estimation result is
shown in Table 2. A likelihood ratio index is 0.428
and its goodness of fit is good enough. Moreover,
the result that the coefficient parameter of the re-
quired time is negative and the choice probability
of train increases as the distance between office
and home is far is suitable for basic analysis and
intuition,

Moreover, we estimated parameters of the rate
of the uneasy tweet separately by on foot and stay.
It turns out that the uneasy tweet rate has had big-
ger influence to on foot choice. For example, from
the ratio of parameters, the increase of 5 point un-
easy tweet ratio is equivalent to the increase of 64
minutes required time by foot. From a perspective
of family safety check, decision maker who could
check family’s safety tend to choice stay. There-
fore, family’s safety check is the important factors
for the avoidance of confusion at the great disaster.

A sensitivity analysis is conducted based on this
result. One is the analysis of the effect of the exis-
tence of a stay place on going-home behavior and
another is the analysis of effect of family’s safety
check in the early time zone. Figure 10 shows the
results.

First, we consider the case where all people
have the waiting place. If the ratio of waiting posi-
tion tweets of users who choose by foot, train and
other is same as the average ratio by stay choosers,
the number of choice staying will increase by 1.18

On the other hand, the share of going-home be-

havior such as on foot and train decreases by 3%.
Although 3% of reduction seems to be very small
influence apparently, generally the traffic conges-
tion and confusion in a transport system occur by
exceeding only 10 % of supplied capacity. From
this point, 3% of reduction effects is not few.

Next, we analyzed the influence of the safety
check within a family. It is checked from the
tweets that there are 353 decision makers who
have family living together. When all of these
353 persons was able to check family’s safety by
17:00, as shown in Figure 10, the number of agents
who choice train or stay increase by 1.1 times, and
the number of people who go home by foot de-
crease by 0.95 time. Needless to say, the safety
check within a family at the time of a disaster is
the important information. Since lines of commu-
nication other than a mobile phone carried out the
big contribution by this earthquake disaster, these
communication tools can prevent the confusion of
transport network partially.

5 Conclusions

In this paper, we inferred the going-home behav-
ior in Tokyo metropolitan area after the Great East
Japan Earthquake using tweet data and geotag data
of Twitter and clarified the decision-making fac-
tors. Although the inference method of going-
home behavior and the behavioral model were
the existing techniques, by combining two data
sources and techniques, the going-home behavior
for each individual and its factors were clarified
only from Twitter data. And the virtual scenario
simulation was carried out and we analyzed the ef-
fect of waiting space and communication tools.

In the ex post survey about the behavior in the
earthquake disaster, the orders of samples is about
thousands of people. In this research, the number
of users whose tweets were with geotag is 3,307
people in Tokyo metropolitan area and it is also
same order. However, if we can calculate the sim-

ilarity of users who have geotag and not have geo-
tag from the similarity of users’ tweet, human be-
haviors in the great disaster can be clarified in hun-
dreds thousands of people’s order. We would like
to consider these approach as future tasks.
