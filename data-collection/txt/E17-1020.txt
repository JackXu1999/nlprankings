Abstract

Machine translation (MT) quality is eval-
uated through comparisons between MT
outputs and the human translations (HT).
Traditionally, this evaluation relies on
form related features (e.g. lexicon and syn-
tax) and ignores the transfer of meaning
reflected in HT outputs. Instead, we eval-
uate the quality of MT outputs through
meaning related features (e.g. polarity,
subjectivity) with two experiments. In
the first experiment, the meaning related
features are compared to human rankings
individually. In the second experiment,
combinations of meaning related features
and other quality metrics are utilized to
predict the same human rankings. The re-
sults of our experiments confirm the ben-
efit of these features in predicting hu-
man evaluation of translation quality in ad-
dition to traditional metrics which focus
mainly on form.

1 Introduction

Machine translation (MT) systems translate large
chunks of data automatically across languages.
Although these systems may achieve high level
accuracies using form related features (e.g. lexi-
cal and syntactic), they often fail to carry over the
meaning embracing the form. Example (1) high-
lights the meaning difference between a Human
Translation (HT) and an MT output for the same
source sentence:

Example (1)
HT: “Your feet’s too big.”1

MT: “Your feet is too great.”2

Although the form is often preserved, MT out-
puts may sound “strange” or “different” in com-
parison to HT ones due to the loss of meaning.
Therefore, human translators generally enrich the
text with the appropriate tone, style and sentiments
during translation. Current quality evaluation met-
rics like BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and ME-
TEOR (Lavie and Agarwal, 2007) are based on
form related features and do not directly consider
the transfer of meaning (e.g. sentiment and style)
in MT. Some of these metrics check for synonyms
and paraphrases but this approach is still limited to
the coverage of the corresponding pair tables. In
other words, these metrics do not explicitly evalu-
ate the transfer of meaning in MT. Our main goals
are:

• to find out whether the transfer of meaning
related features (e.g. sentiment and style) in
MT influences the human judgment of trans-
lation quality.

• to compare meaning and form related fea-
tures for quality evaluation of MT.

• to measure whether meaning and form re-
lated features can be combined to improve
the performance of existing MT quality eval-
uation metrics.

tion, segment id:440

By using publicly available parallel corpora
(Tenth Workshop on Statistical Machine Transla-
tion (WMT15)), we achieve our goals with two
experiments described in Section 5. Our results
indicate that combining meaning related features
with form related ones approximates to the hu-
man judged rankings better than the BLEU metric.
These combined features also improve the perfor-
mance of other MT quality evaluation metrics by
0.5-2 percentage points.

2 Related Work

So far, MT studies have focused mostly on fea-
tures related to form (e.g., lexical and syntactic
features) for the automatic evaluation of MT qual-
ity (e.g., BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and ME-
TEOR (Lavie and Agarwal, 2007)). BLEU met-
ric is based on n-gram matching of the HT and
MT texts and used widely in the MT commu-
nity to evaluate the MT quality. METEOR em-
ploys both word matching scores and the linguis-
tic information (e.g., synonyms and stemming) in
contrast to BLEU. Following studies have evalu-
ated MT quality with various features: POS tags
(Dahlmeier et al., 2011), morphemes (Tantuğ et
al., 2008), sentence structure (Li et al., 2012),
named entities (Buck, 2012), semantic textual
similarity (Castillo and Estrella, 2012), paraphras-
ing (Snover et al., 2006), semantic roles (Lo and
Wu, 2011) and language models (Stanojevic and
Simaan, 2014). Recently, Yu et al. (2015) pro-
posed another metric (i.e. DPMFComb) which is
a combination of a syntax-based metric and some
other evaluation metrics in Asiya3. At WMT15,
DPMFComb obtained the best results at the met-
rics task for system-level evaluation of translation
into English tasks.

Although previous methods require human ref-
erence translation, recent methods (e.g. quality
estimation metrics), aim to eliminate the neces-
sity of human translation. These methods apply
Machine Learning (ML) techniques using lexical
(e.g. average source/target token length), syn-
tactic (e.g. ratio of percentage of POS tags in
the source/target sentences), and statistical fea-
tures (e.g. source/target sentence LM probability,
word alignment probabilities, etc.) (Stymne et al.,
2014; Langlois, 2015; Shah et al., 2015). Inter-
ested reader may also benefit from the survey on
MT evaluation metrics by Han and Wong (2016).

Chen and Zhu (2014) explore sentiment con-
sistency between MT and HT texts to improve
the MT quality by incorporating sentiment related
features (e.g. subjectivity, polarity, intensity and
negation). By using these features in their MT sys-
tem, they improved the BLEU score by 1.1 point
on NIST Chinese-to-English translation dataset4.
Mohammad et al. (2015) also investigate the sen-
timent consistency between MT and HT texts with
a different motivation. They improve sentiment
analysis performance for Arabic by translating
available resources (e.g., sentiment lexicon, senti-
ment annotated data) from English to Arabic. Al-
though sentiment analysis of English translations
of Arabic texts obtain competitive results to cur-
rent state-of-the-art Arabic sentiment analysis sys-
tems, they did not evaluate the MT output quality.

There are also studies using MT systems to en-
rich labeled data for sentiment analysis by translat-
ing between languages and leveraging sentiment
scores (Wan, 2009; Demirtaş and Pechenizkiy,
2013; Hiroshi et al., 2004). However, none of
these studies employ meaning related features to
evaluate the MT quality.

3 Data Description

3.1 2015 Workshop on Statistical Machine
Translation

We utilized WMT155 parallel corpora (Bojar et
al., 2015) which include several tasks (e.g., stan-
dard news translation task, a metrics task, a tun-
ing task, a task for run-time estimation of machine
translation quality, and an automatic post-editing
task). 24 institutions participated in the translation
task with a total of 68 machine translation systems.
The WMT15 data includes:

• Source sentences

• Reference human translations (HT)

• Machine translations (MT)

• Human judgments (e.g. from 1 (best) to 5
(worst)) for each MT text.

The data is available for five language pairs:
Czech (ces)-English, French (fre)-English, Ger-
man (deu)-English, Finnish (fin)-English, and
Russian (rus)-English. Domains of the test data
are the same for all languages except for French.
The test data for the French-English language pair
was fetched from a news discussion forum instead
of news texts. Table 1 shows the statistics for the
test data. The target language is English for all
source languages. The domain of source text, the
number of sentences and the number of human
judgments are presented. All data was based on
the news text corpora except for French-English
pair.

In order to evaluate the quality of each MT
system, Bojar et al. (2015) conducted a human
evaluation using Appraise6 (Federmann, 2012)
which is an open source toolkit (similar to Ama-
zon Mechanical Turk7). Each segment consists
of a source sentence in the original language (e.g.
Czech), its corresponding human translation (En-
glish), and 5 anonymous MT system translations
(English).

To make the task more consistent and to in-
crease the number of data points, the organizers
treated almost identical system translations as one.
Even though exactly 5 translations are presented to
each judge in a segment, there may be more than 5
MT systems that are ranked. Judges rate the seg-
ments from 1 (best) to 5 (worst) by the quality of
translated sentences (allowing ties).

Appraise

7https://www.mturk.com/mturk/

In total, there were 29,007 segments, each of
which would have produced at least 10 individ-
ual system comparisons (e.g., A>B, B>C, A=C,
C>B, etc.). To map these individual comparisons
to system scores, the organizers used TrueSkill 8

(Herbrich et al., 2006), a Bayesian skill ranking al-
gorithm (similar to Elo used in Chess (Elo, 1978))
and fed these individual bilateral comparisons to
TrueSkill. A score is produced for each partici-
pated system. In this study, we utilized the HT
texts, MT system translations and human judg-
ments in our experiments.

3.2 Features

Table 2 provides examples of MT errors in com-
parison to HT. All example translations (MT vs.
HT texts) are selected from the WMT15 dataset
based on the lowest (5) rankings by human judges.
Although translations overlap at the word level,
they convey quite different meanings. In exam-
ple (1), the word ’badly’ has disappeared in MT
output and led to a loss of information. In exam-
ple (2), a negated sentence is translated as an affir-
mative sentence by the MT system. Example (3)
illustrates how the MT system generates a more
speculative sentence than HT sentence. The pair
in example (4) differs in terms of formality be-
tween MT vs HT output. MT evaluation metrics
may attribute high scores for these pairs since they
mainly focus on lexical and syntactic matching.
However, as our examples demonstrate, meaning
could easily be lost if we rely only on form related
MT system evaluation metrics.

To investigate the consistency between MT and
HT texts for sentiment and stylistic features, we
make use of sentiment polarity, subjectivity, con-
notation, negation, speculation, readability and
formality to measure how these features influence
the quality of translation with respect to human
rankings.

Sentiment Polarity indicates whether the desig-
nated sentence has an affirmative or negative sen-
timent. To measure the impact of this feature, we
use Vader, a rule based sentiment analysis tool
(Hutto and Gilbert, 2014). It utilizes grammati-
cal and syntactical rules. In the experiments per-
formed by Hutto and Gilbert (2014), Vader out-
performs several competing sentiment analysis ap-
proaches.

Additionally, we trained a machine learning
(ML) based sentiment analyzer using a deep learn-
ing approach described by Yildiz et al. (2016).
Their architecture is a Convolutional Neural Net-
work (CNN) which takes pre-trained word vec-
tors9 as input and applies interleaved convolution
and pooling operations. The top layer in the net-
work is Softmax layer which computes the proba-
bility of assigning a class (positive, negative).

We adopted this architecture and trained a net-
work using Stanford Twitter Sentiment Corpus10.
The training set contains 1.6 million tweets auto-
matically labeled as positive or negative from var-
ious domains while the test set is labeled manu-
ally. This ML based sentiment analyzer achieves
90.1% accuracy and outperforms the SVM classi-
fier reported by Go et al. (2009).

Subjectivity indicates whether a text expresses
an opinion. In order to compute the subjectiv-
ity scores, we trained our architecture using the
sentiment polarity and subjectivity dataset11 (Pang
and Lee, 2004) which includes 5000 subjective
and 5000 objective sentences. We applied 10-fold
cross validation to the data and obtained 91.50%
average accuracy.

Connotation indicates cultural or emotional as-
sociation carried by words that appear in sentences
(Feng et al., 2013). In contrast to the sentiment po-
larity, connotation polarity indicates subtle shades
of sentiment beyond denotative or surface mean-
ing of text. The words which do not express senti-
ment can carry a positive or negative connotation.

For instance, “life” and “home” are consid-
ered neutral with regard to the sentiment analy-
sis. However, they convey a positive connotation

gz

(Carpuat, 2015). We use the connotation polarity
of each word in a sentence to compute connotation
score using a normalized version of the formula-
tion proposed by Carpuat (2015). The connota-
tion polarities of the words are obtained by look-
ing up a lexicon which is constructed by Feng et
al. (2013). We used the following formula to com-
pute the connotation score:

CS =
#positive−#negative

#total
(1)

where CS is the connotation score, #positive indi-
cates the number of the words with positive con-
notation and #negative indicates the number of the
words with negative connotation.

This formula assigns a continuous value be-
tween 1 and −1 to the sentence as a connotation
score. The values close to 1 indicate that a given
sentence carries a positive connotation while the
values close to−1 indicate a negative connotation.
Negation turns an affirmative statement into a
negative one. We also detect the effects of nega-
tion feature in our experiments. Konstantinova et
al. (2012) present a freely available dataset which
contains 400 reviews (50 each from 8 domains
such as movies and consumer products) annotated
by linguists for negation and speculation. We train
our deep learning model with these datasets and
obtain 96.65% accuracy for negation.

Speculation is used to express levels of cer-
tainty. We obtain 95.55% accuracy using the same
dataset and method for negation.

Readability measures the ease of reading and
comprehending a text (Dale and Chall, 1948). For
readability measurement we use Flesch reading-
ease test in which higher scores indicate that the
text is easier to read. The Flesch readability score
(Kincaid et al., 1975) is calculated using the sen-
tence length and the number of syllables per word
as presented in the formula below.

Flesch = 206.835− 1.015A
B
− 84.6C

A
(2)

where A is the number of words, B is the number
of sentences and C is the number of syllables in a
given text.

In addition to the rule based readability mea-
surement, we use an ML based readability met-
ric “simplicity” as described by Vajjala and Meur-
ers (2016). They extract various syntactic, psy-
cholinguistic and lexical features from text and

train a pair-wise classifier using them. The train-
ing data is a sentence-aligned corpus constructed
from news articles and Wikipedia pages and their
simplified versions. The method correctly classi-
fies the simplified and complex sentences in terms
of their reading level with an accuracy of over
80%.

Formality Heylighen and Dewaele (1999) state
formality as the most important dimension of vari-

ation between styles. They define the formality
score as a function of POS tag frequencies. The
formality score is given in Equation 3 where NF
is the frequency of nouns, AdjF is the adjective
frequency, PF is the preposition frequency, ArtF
is the article frequency, PrpF is the proper noun
frequency, VF is the verb frequency, AdvF is the
adverb frequency and IF is the interjection fre-
quency.

Additionally, we use an ML based formality
score obtained by training the mentioned archi-
tecture on the dataset introduced by Pavlick and
Tetreault (2016). We have observed 80.71% accu-
racy through 10-fold cross validation.

All metrics were normalized between (0, 1) ex-
cept the Readability and Formality. Since these
two metrics are formula-based, we avoided inter-
fering with their original scales.

4 Method

In the WMT15 task, the language pairs are divided
into two groups depending on whether English is
the source or the target language. We only utilize
the pairs where English is the target language due
to the richness in resources. For each feature, MT
texts are ranked using the following approach:

1. Compute the score for HT text (e.g., 0.65).

2. Compute the scores for MT texts (e.g. A=.79,
B=.25, C=.20, D=.95, E=.30).

3. Compute the absolute difference between
MT scores and the HT score (e.g., Â =
.14, B̂ = .40, Ĉ = .45, D̂ = .30, Ê =
.35).

4. Rank the systems according to these differ-
ences where a smaller value corresponds to
a better ranking (e.g. 1=A, 2=D, 3=E, 4=B,
5=C).

Figure 1 shows absolute differences for four
features with respect to language and human
rankings of MT system output. For instance,
Subjectivity-RB feature captures the differences
between ranks when the source language is
French but cannot achieve the same performance
for Finnish and Russian translations. More-
over, Readability-RuleBased (RB) and Formality-
MachineLearning (ML) seem to perform well for
all languages whereas Polarity-ML falls short for
French.

Figure 2 illustrates the trend for all features in
which absolute score difference between MT sys-
tem outputs and HT text is low for high rankings
(e.g., 1) and high for the low (e.g., 5) ones. There-
fore, high ranked translations preserve the mean-
ing better than the low ranked ones. Note that both

5 Experiments

5.1 Experiment #1: Impact of Individual
Features on Translation Quality

This experiment investigates the correlation be-
tween each feature and MT translation quality
evaluated by rankings of human judges. Using
the rankings described in Section 4, we followed
the “System-Based Evaluation Methodology” by
Stanojević et al. (2015). After obtaining the rank-
ings for each feature as described in the previous
section, we used TrueSkill to map segment rank-
ings to system-wide scores (see Figure 3). Next,
we compared TrueSkill scores obtained per feature
and human judgments with Pearson’s r correlation
using the scripts provided by the WMT15 Metrics
Task12. As stated in (Stanojević et al., 2015) the
script performs bootstrap resampling of 1000 sam-
ples while calculating the correlation scores and
the 95% confidence intervals.

Table 3: Pearson’s r correlation between Trueskill scores of a metric and human judgments with the
corresponding 95% confidence intervals are shown. Each row represent either a meaning related feature
(top) or a selected metric from WMT15 (bottom). ML stands for machine learning and RB stands for
rule based method.

We have used three metrics from WMT15 Met-
rics Task for comparison, BLEU and METEOR
and DPMFComb. DPMFComb was selected since
it was the best system in overall score in system-
based evaluation of WMT15 Metrics Shared Task
and the best performing evaluation metric for three
out of five languages.

Results Table 3 shows all the Pearson’s corre-
lations. Overall, Formality-RB obtains the high-
est correlation score (80.7%) among all features.
However, DPMFComb (96.2%), BLEU and ME-
TEOR are better than the rest. The excep-
tions are German for BLEU and French for ME-
TEOR. For German, Formality-RB (92.5%) out-
performs BLEU (86.5%). For French, Formality-
RB (97.4%) beats the METEOR score (95.1%). In
addition, Rule-Based (RB) systems perform bet-
ter than Machine Learning (ML) ones. For ex-
ample, Formality-RB and Polarity-RB outperform
Formality-ML and Polarity-ML respectively.

Meaning related features outperform Random
baseline as expected. The random baseline is com-
puted by assigning random ranks (1-5) to each
translation in each segment. We assigned uni-
formly random ranks to all sentences without con-
sidering the language. Although its performance
may vary per language, its overall performance is
0.0 (± 2.9).

5.2 Experiment #2: Impact of Combined
Features on Translation Quality

As discussed in Section 4, our approach is fun-
damentally different than MT evaluation metrics
such as BLEU. Results of our first experiment in-
dicated strong correlations between quality scores
of the features and human rankings. Therefore,
we also investigate whether we can predict hu-
man rankings of MT translated text by combining
these features since they capture different aspects
of translation.

In contrast with Experiment 1, this experi-
ment focuses on training systems that combine
several features to predict human rankings. As
input, BLEU, METEOR and DPMFComb met-
rics are utilized in combination with the feature
scores. We experimented with several classifiers
from RankLib13 to train the ensemble systems
and opted to utilize a Random Forest (Liaw and
Wiener, 2002) based approach which produced the
best 5-fold cross validation score.

First, we obtained scores and rankings for each
translation using the Random Forest classifiers for
the following combinations:

1. All meaning related features

2. All meaning related features + BLEU

corresponding 95% confidence intervals are shown. ALL represents the combination of all meaning
related features.

3. All meaning related features + Meteor

4. All meaning related features + DPMFComb

Then, we calculated the Trueskill scores for trans-
lation systems and finally fed them into WMT15
scrips to obtain Pearson’s r correlation similar to
the first experiment.

Results Combined meaning related features out-
perform the BLEU score (Table 4). Even though
the margin is relatively low, it is a promising indi-
cation. Moreover, combining them with a metric
increases the performance of the metric: 1.9pp for
BLEU, 0.9pp for METEOR and 0.6pp for DPM-
FComb. In other words, these features can utilize
some meaning or style related information which
is not captured by the conventional MT evaluation
metrics.

6 Discussion & Conclusion

In this paper, we investigate how meaning related
features influence the automatic evaluation of MT
systems. Our experiments prove the additional
benefit of these features in predicting human eval-
uation of translation quality. More specifically, we
find that:

• MT systems that are ranked higher by human
judges preserve the meaning (features such
as polarity, formality and readability) better
than the low ranked ones.

• Rankings of MT output generated according
to meaning based features correlate highly
with human rankings on translation quality
(See Figure 2).

• When meaning related features are combined
with form related lexical features, human

evaluation of MT system quality can be pre-
dicted with a higher accuracy. (See Table 4).

Extracting meaning related features from text
and using form related features for MT evalua-
tion have been studied separately. However, in-
tegrating meaning related features into MT qual-
ity evaluation can capture the meaning preserva-
tion from source to target languages. Our experi-
ments prove that this integrated approach achieves
a only slightly better performance than the form
based metrics (e.g. BLEU). Moreover, our exper-
iments indicate that the meaning related features
can boost the performance of BLEU, METEOR
and DPMFComb metrics without even specific op-
timization. Therefore, our method of integrat-
ing meaning related features to MT systems with
ranking components can also improve the perfor-
mances of other metrics instead of only relying on
form based features.

Commonly used evaluation metrics (e.g. BLEU
and METEOR) require a reference human transla-
tion to assess the quality of MT. We also use hu-
man translation as a reference since most meaning
related feature extraction tools are only available
for English and limited for other languages. Al-
though there are studies assessing the quality of
MT systems without human translation, meaning
related features are still not integrated to MT sys-
tems yet. As new tools for other languages become
available, we plan to extend our work to imple-
ment MT quality estimation for these languages
as well. As future work, we will investigate the
ways to develop more ”human-like” MT systems
by employing these meaning related and stylistic
features in the training of MT systems or in post-
processing steps such as parameter tuning.
