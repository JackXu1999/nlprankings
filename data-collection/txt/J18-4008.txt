Conventional topic models are ineffective for topic extraction from microblog messages, because
the data sparseness exhibited in short messages lacking structure and contexts results in poor
message-level word co-occurrence patterns. To address this issue, we organize microblog mes-
sages as conversation trees based on their reposting and replying relations, and propose an
unsupervised model that jointly learns word distributions to represent: (1) different roles of
conversational discourse, and (2) various latent topics in reflecting content information. By
explicitly distinguishing the probabilities of messages with varying discourse roles in containing
topical words, our model is able to discover clusters of discourse words that are indicative of
topical content. In an automatic evaluation on large-scale microblog corpora, our joint model
yields topics with better coherence scores than competitive topic models from previous studies.

Qualitative analysis on model outputs indicates that our model induces meaningful represen-
tations for both discourse and topics. We further present an empirical study on microblog
summarization based on the outputs of our joint model. The results show that the jointly
modeled discourse and topic representations can effectively indicate summary-worthy content
in microblog conversations.

1. Introduction

Over the past two decades, the Internet has been revolutionizing the way we com-
municate. Microblogging, a social networking channel over the Internet, further accel-
erates communication and information exchange. Popular microblog platforms, such
as Twitter1 and Sina Weibo,2 have become important outlets for individuals to share
information and voice opinions, which further benefit downstream applications such
as instant detection of breaking events (Lin et al. 2010; Weng and Lee 2011; Peng et al.
2015), real-time and ad hoc search of microblog messages (Duan et al. 2010; Li et al.
2015b), public opinions and user behavior understanding on societal issues (Pak and
Paroubek 2010; Popescu and Pennacchiotti 2010; Kouloumpis, Wilson, and Moore 2011),
and so forth.

However, the explosive growth of microblog data far outpaces human beings’
speed of reading and understanding. As a consequence, there is a pressing need for
effective natural language processing (NLP) systems that can automatically identify
gist information, and make sense of the unmanageable amount of user-generated so-
cial media content (Farzindar and Inkpen 2015). As one of the important and funda-
mental text analytic approaches, topic models extract key components embedded in
microblog content by clustering words that describe similar semantic meanings to form
latent “topics.” The derived intermediate topic representations have proven beneficial
to many NLP applications for social media, such as summarization (Harabagiu and
Hickl 2011), classification (Phan, Nguyen, and Horiguchi 2008; Zeng et al. 2018a), and
recommendation on microblogs (Zeng et al. 2018b).

Conventionally, probabilistic topic models (e.g., probabilistic latent semantic analy-
sis [Hofmann 1999] and latent Dirichlet allocation [Blei et al. 2003]) have achieved huge
success over the past decade, owing to their fully unsupervised manner and ease of
extension. The semantic structure discovered by these topic models have facilitated the
progress of many research fields, for example, information retrieval (Boyd-Graber, Hu,
and Mimno 2017), data mining (Lin et al. 2015), and NLP (Newman et al. 2010). Never-
theless, ascribing to their reliance on document-level word co-occurrence patterns, the
progress is still limited to formal conventional documents such as news reports (Blei,
Ng, and Jordan 2003) and scientific articles (Rosen-Zvi et al. 2004). The aforementioned
models work poorly when directly applied to short and colloquial texts (e.g., microblog
posts) owing to severe sparsity exhibited in such text genre (Wang and McCallum 2006;
Hong and Davison 2010).

Previous research has proposed several methods to deal with the sparsity issue in
short texts. One common approach is to aggregate short messages into long pseudo-
documents. Many studies heuristically aggregate messages based on authorship

(Hong and Davison 2010; Zhao et al. 2011), shared words (Weng et al. 2010), or hashtags
(Ramage, Dumais, and Liebling 2010; Mehrotra et al. 2013). Quan et al. (2015) propose
self-aggregation-based topic modeling (SATM) that aggregates texts jointly with topic
inference. Another popular solution is to take into account word relations to alleviate
document-level word sparseness. Biterm topic model (BTM) directly models the gener-
ation of word-pair co-occurrence patterns in each individual message (Yan et al. 2013;
Cheng et al. 2014). More recently, word embeddings trained by large-scale external data
are leveraged to capture word relations and improve topic models on short texts (Das,
Zaheer, and Dyer 2015; Nguyen et al. 2015; Li et al. 2016a, 2017a; Shi et al. 2017; Xun
et al. 2017).

To date, most efforts focus on content in messages, but ignore the rich discourse
structure embedded in ubiquitous user interactions on microblog platforms. On mi-
croblogs, which were originally built for user communication and interaction, conver-
sations are freely formed on issues of interests by reposting messages and replying
to others. When joining a conversation, users generally post topically related content,
which naturally provide effective contextual information for topic discovery. Alvarez-
Melis and Saveski (2016) have shown that simply aggregating messages based on
conversations can significantly boost the performance of conventional topic models and
outperform models exploiting hashtag-based and user-based aggregations.

Another important issue ignored in most previous studies is the effective separation
of topical words from non-topic ones (Li et al. 2016b). In microblog content, owing to
its colloquial nature, non-topic words such as sentimental (e.g., “great” and “ToT”),
functional (e.g., “doubt” and “why”), and other non-topic words (e.g., “oh” and “oops”)
are common and usually mixed with topical words. The occurrence of non-topic words
may distract the models from recognizing topical content, which thus leads to the
failure to produce coherent and meaningful topics. In this article, we propose a novel
model that examines the entire context of a conversation and jointly explores word
distributions representing varying types of topical content and discourse roles such as
agreement, question-asking, argument, and other dialogue acts (Ritter, Cherry, and
Dolan 2010).3 Though Ritter, Cherry, and Dolan (2010) separate discourse, topic, and
other words for modeling conversations, their model focuses on dialogue act modeling
and only yields one distribution for topical content. Therefore, their model is unable to
distinguish varying latent topics reflecting message content underlying the corpus. Li
et al. (2016b) leverage conversational discourse structure to detect topical words from
microblog posts, which explicitly explores the probabilities of different discourse roles
that contain topical words. However, Li et al. (2016b) depend on a pre-trained discourse
tagger and acquire a time-consuming and expensive manual annotation process for
annotating conversational discourse roles on microblog messages, which does not scale
for large data sets (Ritter, Cherry, and Dolan 2010; Joty, Carenini, and Lin 2011).

To exploit discourse structure of microblog conversations, we link microblog posts
using reposting and replying relations to build conversation trees. Particularly, the root
of a conversation tree refers to the original post and its edges represent the reposting
or replying relations. To illustrate the interplay between topic and discourse, Figure 1
displays a snippet of Twitter conversation about “Trump administration’s immigration
ban.” From the conversation, we can observe two major components: (1) discourse,

3 In this work, a discourse role refers to a certain type of dialogue act on message level, e.g., agreement or
argument. The discourse structure of a conversation means some combination (or a probability
distribution) of discourse roles.

indicated by the underlined words, describes the intention and pragmatic roles of
messages in conversation structure, such as making a statement or asking a question; (2)
topic, represented by the bold words, captures the topic and focus of the conversation,
such as “racialism” and “Muslims.” As we can see, different discourse roles vary in
probabilities to contain key content reflecting the conversation focus. For example, in
Figure 1, [R5] doubts the assertion of “immigration ban is good,” and raises a new focus
on “racialism.” This in fact contains more topic-related words than [R6], which simply
reacts to its parent. For this reason, in this article, we attempt to identify messages
with “good” discourse roles that tend to describe key focuses and salient topics of a
microblog conversation tree, which enables the discovery of “good” words reflecting
coherent topics. Importantly, our joint model of conversational discourse and latent
topics is fully unsupervised, therefore does not require any manual annotation.

For evaluation, we conduct quantitative and qualitative analysis on large-scale
Twitter and Sina Weibo corpora. Experimental results show that topics induced by
our model are more coherent than existing models. Qualitative analysis on discourse
further shows that our model can yield meaningful clusters of words related to man-
ually crafted discourse categories. In addition, we present an empirical study on
downstream application of microblog conversation summarization. Empirical results
on ROUGE (Lin 2004) show that summaries produced based on our joint model contain
more salient information than state-of-the-art summarization systems. Human evalu-
ation also indicates that our output summaries are competitive with existing unsu-
pervised summarization systems in the aspects of informativeness, conciseness, and
readability.

In summary, our contributions in this article are 3-fold:

• Microblog posts organized as conversation trees for topic modeling. We
propose a novel concept of representing microblog posts as conversation
trees by connecting microblog posts based on reposting and replying

relations for topic modeling. Conversation tree structure helps enrich
context, alleviate data sparseness, and in turn improve topic modeling.

• Exploiting discourse in conversations for topic modeling. Our model
differentiates the generative process of topical and non-topic words,
according to the discourse role of the message where a word is drawn
from being. This helps the model in identifying the topic-specific
information from non-topic background.

• Thorough empirical study on the inferred topic representations. Our
model shows better results than competitive topic models when evaluated
on large-scale, real-world microblog corpora. We also present an effective
method for using our induced results on microblog conversation
summarization.

2. Related Work

This article builds upon diverse streams of previous work in lines of topic modeling,
discourse analysis, and microblog summarization, which are briefly surveyed as follows.

2.1 Topic Models

Topic models aim to discover the latent semantic information, i.e., topics, from texts and
have been extensively studied. This work is built upon the success of latent Dirichlet
allocation (LDA) modeling (Blei et al. 2003; Blei, Ng, and Jordan 2003) and aims to learn
topics in microblog messages. We first briefly introduce LDA in Section 2.1.1 and then
review the related work on topic modeling for microblog content in Section 2.1.2.

2.1.1 LDA: Springboard of Topic Models. Latent Dirichlet allocation (Blei, Ng, and Jordan
2003) is one of the most popular and well-known topic models. It uses Dirichlet pri-
ors to generate document–topic and topic–word distributions, and has shown to be
effective in extracting topics from conventional documents. LDA plays an important
role in semantic representation learning and serves as the springboard of many famous
topic models, e.g., hierarchical latent Dirichlet allocation (Blei et al. 2003), author–topic
modeling (Rosen-Zvi et al. 2004), and so forth. In addition to “topic” modeling, it has
also inspired discourse (Crook, Granell, and Pulman 2009; Ritter, Cherry, and Dolan 2010;
Joty, Carenini, and Lin 2011) detection without supervision or with weak supervision.
However, none of the aforementioned work jointly infers discourse and topics on
microblog conversations, which is a gap the present article fills. Also, to the best of our
knowledge, our work serves as the first attempt to exploit the joint effects of discourse
and topic on unsupervised microblog conversation summarization.

2.1.2 Topic Models for Microblog Posts. Previous research has demonstrated that stan-
dard topic models, essentially focusing on document-level word co-occurrences, are
not suitable for short and informal microblog messages because of the severe data
sparsity exhibited in short texts (Wang and McCallum 2006; Hong and Davison 2010).
As a result, one line of previous work focuses on enriching and exploiting contextual
information. Weng et al. (2010), Hong and Davison (2010), and Zhao et al. (2011) first
heuristically aggregate messages posted by the same user or sharing the same words
before conventional topic models are applied. Their simple strategies, however, pose
some problems. For example, it is common that a user has various interests and thus

723



Computational Linguistics Volume 44, Number 4

posts messages covering a wide range of topics. Ramage, Dumais, and Liebling (2010)
and Mehrotra et al. (2013) use hashtags as labels to train supervised topic models.
Nevertheless, these models depend on large-scale hashtag-labeled data for model train-
ing. Moreover, their performance can be inevitably compromised when facing unseen
topics that are irrelevant to any hashtag in training data. Such phenomena are common
because of the rapid change and wide variety of topics on social media. BTM (Yan et al.
2013; Cheng et al. 2014) directly explores unordered word-pair co-occurrence patterns
in each individual message, which is equivalent to extending short documents into a
biterm set consisting of all combinations of any two distinct words appearing in the
document. SATM (Quan et al. 2015) combines short text aggregation and topic induction
into a unified model. However, in SATM, no prior knowledge is given to ensure the
quality of text aggregation, which will further affect the performance of topic inference.

Different from the aforementioned work, we organize microblog messages as con-
versation trees based on reposting and replying relations. It allows us to explore word
co-occurrence patterns in richer context, as messages in one conversation generally
focus on relevant topics. Even though researchers have started to take the contexts pro-
vided by conversations into account when discovering topics on microblogs (Alvarez-
Melis and Saveski 2016; Li et al. 2016b), there is much less work that jointly predicts the
topical words along with the discourse structure in conversations. Ritter, Cherry, and
Dolan (2010) model dialogue acts in conversations via separating discourse words from
topical words and others. Whereas their model produces only one word distribution
to represent the topical content, our model is capable of generating varying discourse
and topic word distributions. Another main difference is that our model explicitly ex-
plores the probabilities of messages with different discourse roles in containing topical
words for topic representation, whereas their model generates topical words from a
conversation-specific distribution over word types regardless of the different discourse
roles of messages. The work by Li et al. (2016b) serves as another prior effort to leverage
conversation structure, captured by a supervised discourse tagger, on topic induction.
Different from them, our model learns discourse structure for conversations in a fully
unsupervised manner, which does not require annotated data.

Another line of research tackles data sparseness by modeling word relations rather
than word occurrences in documents. For example, recent research work has shown
that distributional similarities of words captured by word embeddings (Mikolov et al.
2013; Mikolov, Yih, and Zweig 2013) are useful in recognizing interpretable topic word
clusters from short texts (Das, Zaheer, and Dyer 2015; Nguyen et al. 2015; Li et al. 2016a,
2017a; Shi et al. 2017; Xun et al. 2017). These topic models heavily rely on meaningful
word embeddings needed to be trained on a large-scale, high-quality external corpus,
which should be both in the same domain and the same language as the data for
topic modeling (Bollegala, Maehara, and Kawarabayashi 2015). However, such external
resource is not always available. For example, to the best of our knowledge, there
currently exists no high-quality word embedding corpus for Chinese social media. In
contrast to these prior methods, our model does not have the prerequisite to an external
resource, whose general applicability in cold-start scenarios is therefore ensured.

2.1.3 Topic Modeling and Summarization. Previous studies have shown that the topic
representation captured by topic models is useful for summarization (Nenkova and
McKeown 2012). Specifically, there are two different purposes of using topic models
in existing summarization systems: (1) to separate summary-worthy content and non-
content background (general information) (Daumé and Marcu 2006; Haghighi and
Vanderwende 2009; Çelikyilmaz and Hakkani-Tür 2010), and (2) to cluster sentences

724



Li et al. A Joint Model of Discourse and Topics on Microblogs

or documents into topics, with summaries then generated from each topic cluster for
minimizing content redundancy (Salton et al. 1997; McKeown et al. 1999; Siddharthan,
Nenkova, and McKeown 2004). Similar techniques have also been applied to summarize
events or opinions on microblogs (Chakrabarti and Punera 2011; Long et al. 2011; Rosa
et al. 2011; Duan et al. 2012; Shen et al. 2013; Meng et al. 2012).

Our downstream application on microblog summarization lies in the research line
of point (1), whereas we integrate the effects of discourse on key content identification,
which has not been studied in any prior work. Also it is worth noting that, following
point (2) to cluster messages before summarization is beyond the scope of this work
because we are focusing on summarizing a single conversation tree, on which there are
limited topics. We leave the potential of using our model to segment topics for multi-
conversation summarization to future work.

2.2 Discourse Analysis

Discourse reflects the architecture of textual structure, where the semantic or pragmatic
relations among text units (e.g., clauses, sentences, paragraphs) are defined. Here we
review prior work on single document discourse analysis in Section 2.2.1, followed by a
description on discourse extension to represent conversation structures in Section 2.2.2.

2.2.1 Traditional View of Discourse. It has been long pointed out that a coherent document,
which gives readers continuity of senses (De Beaugrande and Dressler 1981), is not
simply a collection of independent sentences. Linguists have striven to the study of
discourse analysis ever since ancient Greece (Bakker and Wakker 2009). Early work
shapes the modern concept of discourse (Hovy and Maier 1995) via depicting connec-
tions between text units, which reveals the structural art behind a coherent document.

Rhetorical structure theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson 1988) is one of the most
influential discourse theories. According to its assumption, a coherent document can
be represented by text units at different levels (e.g., clauses, sentences, paragraphs)
in a hierarchical tree structure. In particular, the minimal units in RST (i.e., leaves of
the tree structure) are defined as sub-sentential clauses, namely, elementary discourse
units. Adjacent units are linked by rhetorical relations—condition, comparison, elab-
oration, and so forth. Based on RST, early work uses hand-coded rules for automatic
discourse analysis (Marcu 2000; Thanh, Abeysinghe, and Huyck 2004). Later, thanks to
the development of large-scale discourse corpora—RST corpus (Carlson, Marcu, and
Okurovsky 2001), Graph Bank corpus (Wolf and Gibson 2005), and Penn Discourse
Treebank (Prasad et al. 2008)—data-driven and learning-based discourse parsers that
exploit various manually designed features (Soricut and Marcu 2003; Baldridge and
Lascarides 2005; Fisher and Roark 2007; Lin, Kan, and Ng 2009; Subba and Eugenio
2009; Joty, Carenini, and Ng 2012; Feng and Hirst 2014) and representative learning (Ji
and Eisenstein 2014; Li, Li, and Hovy 2014) became popular.

2.2.2 Discourse Analysis on Conversations. Stolcke et al. (2000) provide one of the first
studies focusing on this problem, and it provides a general schema of understanding
conversations with discourse analysis. Because of the complex structure and informal
language style, discourse parsing on conversations is still a challenging problem (Perret
et al. 2016). Most research focuses on the detection of dialogue acts (DAs),4 which are

4 Dialogue act can be used interchangeably with speech act (Stolcke et al. 2000).

725



Computational Linguistics Volume 44, Number 4

defined in Stolcke et al. (2000) as the first-level conversational discourse structure. It is
worth noting that a DA represents the shallow discourse role that captures illocutionary
meanings of an utterance (“statement,” “question,” “agreement,” etc.).

Automatic dialogue act taggers have been conventionally trained in a super-
vised way with predefined tag inventories and annotated data (Stolcke et al. 2000;
Cohen, Carvalho, and Mitchell 2004; Bangalore, Fabbrizio, and Stent 2006). However,
DA definition is generally domain-specific and usually involves the manual designs
from experts. Also, the data annotation process is slow and expensive, resulting in the
limitation of data available for training DA classifiers (Jurafsky, Shriberg, and Biasca
1997; Dhillon et al. 2004; Ritter, Cherry and Dolan 2010; Joty, Carenini, and Lin 2011).
These issues are pressing with the arrival of the Internet era in which new domains of
conversations and even new types of dialogue act tags have boomed (Ritter, Cherry,
and Dolan 2010; Joty, Carenini, and Lin 2011).

For this reason, researchers have proposed unsupervised or weakly supervised dia-
logue act taggers that identify indicative discourse word clusters based on probabilistic
graphical models (Crook, Granell, and Pulman 2009; Ritter, Cherry, and Dolan 2010;
Joty, Carenini, and Lin 2011). In our work, the discourse detection module is inspired by
these previous models, where discourse roles are represented by word distributions and
recognized in an unsupervised manner. Different from the previous work that focuses
on discourse analysis, we explore the effects of discourse structure of conversations on
distinguishing varying latent topics underlying the given collection, which has not been
studied before. In addition, most existing unsupervised approaches for conversation
modeling follows hidden Markov model convention and induces discourse represen-
tations in conversation threads. Considering that most social media conversations are
in tree structure because one post is likely to spark multiple replying or reposting
messages, our model allows the modeling of discourse roles in tree structure, which
enables richer contexts to be captured. More details will be provided in Section 3.1.

2.3 Microblog Summarization

Microblog summarization can be considered as a special case of text summarization,
which is conventionally defined as discovering essential content from given docu-
ment(s), and producing concise and informative summaries covering important infor-
mation (Radev, Hovy, and McKeown 2002). Summarization techniques can be generally
categorized as extractive or abstractive methods (Das and Martins 2007). Extractive
summarization captures and distills salient content, which are usually sentences, to
form summaries. Abstractive summarization focuses on identifying key text units (e.g.,
words and phrases) and then generates grammatical summaries based on these units.
Our summarization application falls into the category of extractive summarization.

Early work on microblog summarization attempts to apply conventional extractive
summarization models directly—LexRank (Erkan and Radev 2004), the University
of Michigan’s summarization system MEAD (Radev et al. 2004), TF-IDF (Inouye and
Kalita 2011), integer linear programming (Liu, Liu, and Weng 2011; Takamura, Yokono,
and Okumura 2011), graph learning (Sharifi, Hutton, and Kalita 2010), and so on. Later,
researchers found that standard summarization models are not suitable for microblog
posts because of the severe redundancy, noise, and sparsity problems exhibited in short
and colloquial messages (Chang et al. 2013; Li et al. 2015a). To solve these problems,
one common solution is to use social signals such as the user influence and retweet
counts to help summarization (Duan et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2012; Chang et al. 2013).
Different from the aforementioned studies, we do not include external features such

726



Li et al. A Joint Model of Discourse and Topics on Microblogs

as the social network structure, which ensures the general applicability of our approach
when applied to domains without such information.

Discourse has been reported useful to microblog summarization. Zhang et al. (2013)
and Li et al. (2015a) leverage dialogue acts to indicate summary-worthy messages. In
the field of conversation summarization from other domains (e.g., meetings, forums,
and e-mails), it is also popular to leverage the pre-detected discourse structure for
summarization (Murray et al. 2006; McKeown, Shrestha, and Rambow 2007; Wang and
Cardie 2013; Bhatia, Biyani, and Mitra 2014; Bokaei, Sameti, and Liu 2016). Oya and
Carenini (2014) and Qin, Wang, and Kim (2017) address discourse tagging together with
salient content discovery on e-mails and meetings, and show the usefulness of their
relations in summarization. For all the systems mentioned here, manually crafted tags
and annotated data are required for discourse modeling. Instead, the discourse structure
is discovered in a fully unsupervised manner in our model, which is represented by
word distributions and can be different from any human designed discourse inventory.
The effects of such discourse representations on salient content identification have not
been explored in previous work.

3. The Joint Model of Conversational Discourse and Latent Topics

We assume that the given corpus of microblog posts is organized as C conversation
trees, based on reposting and replying relations. Each tree c contains Mc microblog
messages and each message m has Nc,m words in vocabulary. The vocabulary size is
V. We separate three components, discourse, topic, and background, underlying the given
conversations, and use three types of word distributions to represent them.

At the corpus level, there are K topics represented by word distributionφTk ∼ Dir(β)
(k = 1, 2, ..., K). φDd ∼ Dir(β) (d = 1, 2, ..., D) represents the D discourse roles embedded
in the corpus. In addition, we add a background word distribution φB ∼ Dir(β) to
capture general information (e.g., common words) that cannot indicate either discourse
or topic. φTk , φ

D
d , and φ

B are all V-dimensional multinomial word distributions over the
vocabulary. For each conversation tree c, θc ∼ Dir(α) models the mixture of topics and
any message m on c is assumed to contain a single topic zc,m ∈ {1, 2, ..., K}.

3.1 Message-Level Modeling

For each message m on conversation tree c, our model assigns two message-level multi-
nomial variables to it: dc,m representing its discourse role and zc,m reflecting its topic
assignment, whose definitions are given in turn in the following.

Discourse Roles. Our discourse detection is inspired by Ritter, Cherry, and Dolan
(2010), which exploits the discourse dependencies derived from reposting and replying
relations for assigning discourse roles. For example, a “doubt” message is likely to
start controversy thus triggering another “doubt,” (e.g., [R5] and [R8] in Figure 1).
Assuming that the index of m’s parent is pa(m), we use transition probabilities πd ∼
Dir(γ) (d = 1, 2, ..., D) to explicitly model discourse dependency of m to pa(m). πd is a
distribution over the D discourse roles and πd,d′ denotes the probability of m assigned
discourse d′ given the discourse of pa(m) being d. Specifically, dc,m (discourse role of
message m) is generated from discourse transition distribution πdt,pa(m) where dt,pa(m) is
the discourse assignment on pa(m). In particular, to create a unified generation story,
we place a pseudo message emitting no word before the root of each conversation tree

727



Computational Linguistics Volume 44, Number 4

and assign dummy discourse indexing D + 1 to it. πD+1, the discourse transition from
pseudo messages to roots, in fact models the probabilities of different discourse roles
as conversation starter.

Topic Assignments. Messages on one conversation tree focus on related topics. To
exploit such intuition in topic assignments, the topic of each message m on conversation
tree c (i.e., zc,m) is sampled from the topic mixture θc of conversation tree c.

3.2 Word-Level Modeling

To distinguish varying types of word distributions to separately capture discourse, topic,
and background representations, we follow the solutions from previous work to assign
each word as a discrete and exact source that reflects one particular type of word repre-
sentation (Daumé and Marcu 2006; Haghighi and Vanderwende 2009; Ritter, Cherry,
and Dolan 2010). To this end, for each word n in message m and tree c, a ternary
variable xc,m,n ∈ {DISC, TOPIC, BACK} controls word n to fall into one of the three
types: discourse, topic, and background word. In doing so, words in the given collection
are explicitly separated into three types, based on which the word distributions repre-
senting discourse, topic, and background components are separated accordingly.

Discourse words. (DISC) indicate the discourse role of a message; for example, in
Figure 1, “How” and the question mark “?” reflect that [R1] should be assigned the
discourse role of “question.” If xc,m,n = DISC (i.e., n is assigned as a discourse word),
then word wc,m,n is generated from discourse word distribution φDdc,m , where dc,m is m’s
discourse role.

Topic words. (TOPIC) are the core topical words that describe topics being discussed in
a conversation tree, such as “Muslim,” “order,” and “Trump” in Figure 1. When xc,m,n =
TOPIC, i.e., n is assigned as a topic word, word wc,m,n is hence generated from the word
distribution of the topic assigned to message m, i.e., φTzc,m

Background words. (BACK) capture the general words irrelevant to either discourse or
topic, such as “those” and “of” in Figure 1. When word n is assigned as a background
word (xc,m,n = BACK), word wc,m,n is then drawn from background distribution φB.

Switching Among Topic, Discourse, and Background. We assume that messages of dif-
ferent discourse roles may show different distributions of the word types as discourse,
topic, and background. The ternary word type switcher xc,m,n is hence controlled by
the discourse role of message m. In specific, xc,m,n is drawn from the three-dimensional
distribution τdc,m,n ∼ Dir(δ) that captures the appearing probabilities of three types of
words (DISC, TOPIC, BACK), when the discourse assignment to m is dc,m,n, that is,
xc,m,n ∼Multi(τdc,m ). For instance, a statement message (e.g., [R3] in Figure 1) may
contain more content words for topic representation than a question to other users (e.g.,
[R1] in Figure 1). In particular, stop words and punctuation are forced to be labeled as
discourse or background words. By explicitly distinguishing different types of words
with switcher xc,m,n, we can thus separate the three types of word distributions that
reflect discourse, topic, and background information.

3.3 Generative Process and Parameter Estimation

In summary, Figure 2 illustrates the graphical model of our generative process that
jointly explores conversational discourse and latent topics. The following shows the
detailed generative process of the conversation tree c:

• Draw topic mixture of conversation tree θc ∼ Dir(α)

• For message m = 1 to Mc
– Draw discourse role dc,m ∼Multi(πdc,pa(m) )

– Draw topic assignment zc,m ∼Multi(θc)

– For word n = 1 to Nc,m
Draw ternary word type switcher xc,m,n ∼Multi(τdc,m )
If xc,m,n == DISC

Draw wt,s,n ∼Multi(φDdc,m )
If xc,m,n == TOPIC

Draw wc,m,n ∼Multi(φTzc,m )
If xc,m,n == BACK

Draw wc,m,n ∼Multi(φB)

For parameter estimation, we use collapsed Gibbs sampling (Griffiths and Steyvers
2004) to carry out posterior inference for parameter learning. The hidden multinomial
variables (i.e., message-level variables [d and z] and word-level variable [x]) are sampled
in turn, conditioned on a complete assignment of all other hidden variables and hyper-
parameters Θ = (α,β,γ, δ). For more details, we refer the readers to Appendix A.

4. Experiments on Topic Coherence

This section presents an experiment on the coherence of topics yielded by our joint
model of conversational discourse and latent topics.

4.1 Data Collection and Experiment Set-up

Data Sets. To examine the coherence of topics on diverse microblog data sets, we
conduct experiments on data sets collected from two popular microblog Web sites: Twit-
ter and Weibo,5 where the messages are mostly in English and Chinese, respectively.
Table 1 shows the statistics of our five data sets used to evaluate topic coherence. In the
following, we give the details of their collection processes in turn.

For Twitter data, we evaluate the coherence of topics on three data sets: SemEval,
PHEME, and US Election, and tune all models in our experiments on a large-scale
development data set from TREC2011 microblog track.6

• SemEval. We combine the data released for topic-oriented sentiment
analysis task in SemEval 20157 and 2016.8 To recover the missing ancestors
in conversation trees, we use Tweet Search API to retrieve messages with
the “in-reply-to” relations, and collect tweets in a recursive way until all
the ancestors in a conversation are recovered.9

• PHEME. This data set was released by Zubiaga, Liakata, and Procter
(2016), and contains conversations around rumors and non-rumors posted
during five breaking events: Charlie Hebdo, Ferguson, Germanwings Crash,
Ottawa Shooting, and Sydney Siege.

5 Weibo, short for Sina Weibo, is the biggest microblog platform in China and shares the similar market
penetration as Twitter (Rapoza 2011). Similar to Twitter, it has length limitation of 140 Chinese characters.

7 http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2015/task10/.
8 http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2016/task4/.
9 Twitter search API: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/search/api-reference/
get-saved searches-show-id. Twitter has allowed users to add comments in retweets (reposting
messages on Twitter) since 2015, which enables retweets to become part of a conversation. In our data set,
the parents of 91.4% of such retweets can be recovered from the “in reply to status id” field returned by
Twitter search API.

Li et al. A Joint Model of Discourse and Topics on Microblogs

• US Election. Considering that the SemEval and PHEME data sets cover a
relatively wide range of topics, we are interested in studying a more
challenging problem: whether topic models can differentiate latent topics
in a narrow scope. To this end, we take political tweets as an example and
conduct experiments on a data set with Twitter discussions about the U.S.
presidential election 2016. The data set is extended from the one released
by Zeng et al. (2018b) following three steps. First, some raw tweets that are
likely to be in a conversation are collected by searching conversation-type
keywords via Twitter Streaming API,10 which samples and returns tweets
matching the given keywords.11 Second, conversations are recovered via
“in-reply-to” relations as is done to build the SemEval data set. Third, the
relevant conversations are selected where there exist at least one tweet
containing election-related keywords.12

For Weibo data, we track the real-time trending hashtags13 on Sina Weibo and use
the hashtag-search API14 to crawl the posts matching the given hashtag queries. In the
end, we build a large-scale corpus containing messages posted from 2 January 2014
to 31 July 2014. To examine the performance of models on varying topic distributions,
we split the corpus into seven subsets, each containing messages posted in one month.
We report the topic coherence on two randomly selected subsets, Weibo-1 and Weibo-2.
The remaining five data sets are used as development sets.

Comparisons. Our model jointly identifies word clusters of discourse and topics, and
explicitly explores their relations, namely, the probabilities of different discourse roles in
containing topical words (see Section 3.2), which is called the TOPIC+DISC+REL model in
the rest of the article. In comparison, we consider the following established models:
(1) LDA: In this model, we consider each message as a document and directly apply
LDA (Blei et al. 2003; Blei, Ng, and Jordan 2003) on the collection. The implementation
of LDA is based on the public toolkit GibbsLDA++.15 (2) BTM: BTM16 (Yan et al.
2013; Cheng et al. 2014) is a state-of-the-art topic model for short texts. It directly
models the topics of all word pairs (biterms) in each message, which has proven
more effective on social media texts than LDA (Blei et al. 2003; Blei, Ng, and Jordan
2003), one-topic-per-post Dirichlet multinomial mixture (DMM) (Nigam et al. 2000), and
Zhao et al. (2011) (a DMM version on posts aggregated by authorship). According to
the empirical study by Li et al. (2016b), BTM has in general better performance than a
newer SATM model (Quan et al. 2015) on microblog data.

In particular, this article attempts to induce topics with little external resource.
Therefore, we do not compare with either Li et al. (2016b), which depends on human
annotation to train a discourse tagger, or topic models that exploit word embeddings

11 Conversation-type keywords are used to obtain tweets reflecting agreement, disagreement, and response,
which are likely to appear in Twitter conversations. Keyword list: agreement – “agreed,” “great point,”
“agree,” “good point”; disagreement – “wrong,” “bad idea,” “stupid idea,” “disagree”; response –
“understand,” “interesting,” “i see.”

(Das, Zaheer, and Dyer 2015; Nguyen et al. 2015; Li et al. 2016a, 2017a; Shi et al. 2017;
Xun et al. 2017) pre-trained on large-scale external data. The external data in training
embeddings should be in both the same domain and the same language of the given
collection used for topic models, which limits the applicability of topic models in the
scenarios without such data. Also, Li et al. (2016b) have shown that topic models
combining word embeddings trained on internal data result in worse coherence scores
than BTM, which is considered in our comparison.

In addition to the existing models from previous work, we consider the following
variants that explore topics by organizing messages as conversation trees:

• The TOPIC ONLY model aggregates messages from one conversation tree as
a pseudo-document, on which Chemudugunta, Smyth, and Steyvers
(2006) (a model proven better than LDA in topic coherence) is used to
induce topics on conversation aggregations, without modeling discourse
structure. It involves a background word distribution to capture non-topic
words, like our TOPIC+DISC+REL model. However, different from our
TOPIC+DISC+REL model, the background word distribution is controlled
by a general Beta prior without differentiating discourse roles of
messages.

• The TOPIC+DISC model is an extension to Ritter, Cherry, and Dolan (2010),
following which the switcher indicating a word as a discourse, topic, or
background word are drawn from a conversation-level distribution over
word types. Instead, in TOPIC+DISC+REL, word-type switcher depends on
message-level discourse roles (shown in Section 3.2). In terms of topic
generation of TOPIC+DISC, as the model of Ritter, Cherry, and Dolan (2010)
is incapable of differentiating various latent topics, we follow the same
procedure of TOPIC ONLY and TOPIC+DISC+REL models to draw topics
from conversation-level topic mixture. Another difference between
TOPIC+DISC and Ritter, Cherry, and Dolan (2010) is that the discourse roles
of TOPIC+DISC are explored in tree-structured conversations whereas
those in Ritter, Cherry, and Dolan (2010) are captured in context of
conversation treads (paths of the conversation tree).

Hyper-parameters. For the hyper-parameters of our joint TOPIC+DISC+REL model, we
fixα = 50/K,β = 0.01, following the common practice in previous work (Yan et al. 2013;
Cheng et al. 2014). For Twitter corpora, we set the count of discourse roles as D = 10,
according to previous setting in Ritter, Cherry, and Dolan (2010). Because there is no
analog of γ (controlling the prior for discourse role dependencies of children messages
to their parents), δ (controlling the prior of distributions over topic, discourse, and
background words given varying discourse roles), and discourse count D in Chinese
Weibo corpora, we tune them by grid search on development sets and obtain γ = 0.5,
δ = 0.25, and D = 6 on Weibo data.

The hyper-parameters of LDA and BTM are set according to the best hyper-
parameters reported in their original papers. For TOPIC ONLY and TOPIC+DISC models,
the parameter settings are kept the same as TOPIC+DISC +REL, because they are its
variants. And the background switchers are parameterized by symmetric Beta prior on
0.5, following the original setting from Chemudugunta, Smyth, and Steyvers (2006).
We run Gibbs samplings of all models with 1, 000 iterations to ensure convergence,
following Zhao et al. (2011), Yan et al. (2013), and Cheng et al. (2014).

Li et al. A Joint Model of Discourse and Topics on Microblogs

Preprocessing. Before training topic models, we preprocess the data sets as follows.
For Twitter corpora, we (1) filter non-English messages; (2) replace links, mentions (i.e.,
@username), and hashtags with generic tags of “URL,” “MENTION,” and “HASH-
TAG”; (3) tokenize messages and annotate part-of-speech (POS) tags to each word using
Tweet NLP toolkit (Gimpel et al. 2011; Owoputi et al. 2013)17; and (4) normalize all
letters to lowercases. For Weibo corpora, we (1) filter non-Chinese messages; and (2)
use FudanNLP toolkit (Qiu, Zhang, and Huang 2013) for word segmentation. Then, for
each data set from Twitter or Sina Weibo, we generate a vocabulary and remove low-
frequency words (i.e., words occurring fewer than five times).

For our TOPIC+DISC+REL model and its variants TOPIC ONLY and TOPIC+DISC
considering the conversation structure, we only remove digits but retain stop words
and punctuation in the data because: (1) stop words and punctuation can be useful
discourse indicators, such as the question mark “?” and “what” in indicating “question”
messages; (2) these models are equipped with a background distribution φB to separate
general information useless to indicate either discourse or topic, e.g., “do” and “it”; and
(3) we forbid stop words and punctuation to be sampled as topical words by forcing
their word type switcher x 6=TOPIC in word generation (shown in Section 3.2). For LDA
and BTM that cannot separate non-topic information, we filter out stop words and short
messages with fewer than two words in preprocessing, which retains the same common
settings to ensure comparable performance.18

Evaluation Metrics. Topic model evaluation is inherently difficult. Although in many
previous studies perplexity is a popular metric to evaluate the predictive abilities of
topic models given held-out data set with unseen words (Blei, Ng, and Jordan 2003), we
do not consider perplexity here because high perplexity does not necessarily indicate
semantically coherent topics in human perception (Chang et al. 2009).

The quality of topics is commonly measured by UCI (Newman et al. 2010) and
UMass coherence scores (Mimno et al. 2011), assuming that words representing a
coherent topic are likely to co-occur within the same document. We only consider
UMass coherence here as UMass and UCI generally agree with each other, according
to Stevens et al. (2012). We also consider a newer evaluation metric, the CV coherence
measure (Röder, Both, and Hinneburg 2015), as it has been proven to provide the scores
closest to human evaluation compared with other widely used topic coherence metrics,
including UCI and UMass scores.19 For the CV coherence measure, in brief, given a
word list for topic representations (i.e., the top N words by topic–word distribution),
some known topic coherence measures are combined, which estimates how similar their
co-occurrence patterns with other words are in the context of a sliding window from
Wikipedia.

4.2 Main Comparison Results

We evaluate topic models with two sets of K (i.e., the number of topics, K = 50 and
K = 100) following previous settings (Li et al. 2016b). Tables 2 and 3 show the UMass
and CV scores for topics produced on the evaluation corpora, respectively. For UMass

17 http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/TweetNLP/.
18 We also conducted evaluations on the LDA and BTM versions without this preprocessing step, and we

obtained worse coherence scores.

coherence, the top 5, 10, 15, and 20 words of each topic are selected for evaluation.
For CV coherence, the top 5 and 10 words are selected.20 Note that we cannot report
CV scores on Chinese Weibo corpora because CV coherence is calculated based on a
Wikipedia data set, which does not yet have a Chinese version. From the results, we
identify the following observations:

• Conventional topic models cannot perform well on microblog messages.
From all the comparison results, the topic coherence given by LDA is the
worst, which may be because of the sparseness of document-level word
concurrence patterns in short posts.

• Considering conversation structure is useful to topic inference. Using the
contextual information provided by conversations, TOPIC ONLY produced
competitive results compared to the state-of-the-art BTM model on short
text topic modeling. This observation indicates the effectiveness of using
the conversation structure to enrich context and thus results in latent
topics of reasonably good quality.

• Jointly learning discourse information helps produce coherent topics.
TOPIC+DISC and TOPIC+DISC+REL models yield generally better coherence
scores than TOPIC ONLY, which explores topics without considering
discourse. The reason may be that additionally exploring discourse in
non-topic information helps recognize non-topic words, which further
facilitates the separation of topical words from non-topic ones.

• Considering discourse roles of messages in topical word generation is
useful. The results of TOPIC+DISC+REL are the best in most settings. One

20 Palmetto toolkit only allows at most 10 words as input for CV score calculation.

735



Computational Linguistics Volume 44, Number 4

important reason is that TOPIC+DISC+REL explicitly explores the different
probabilities of messages with varying discourse roles in containing
topical or non-topic words, whereas the other models separate topical
content from non-topic information regardless of the different discourse
roles of messages. This observation demonstrates that messages with
different discourse roles do vary in tendencies to cover topical words,
which provides useful clues for key content words to be identified for
topic representation.

4.3 Case Study

To further evaluate the interpretability of the latent topics and discourse roles learned by
our TOPIC+DISC+REL model, we present a qualitative analysis on the output samples.

Sample Latent Topics. We first present a qualitative study on the sample-produced
topics. Table 4 displays the top 15 words of topic “Trump is a racist” induced by different
models on the US election data set given K = 100.21 We have the following observations:

• It is challenging to extract coherent and meaningful topics from short
and informal microblog messages. Without using an effective strategy to
alleviate the data sparsity problem, LDA mixes the generated topic with
non-topic words,22 such as “direct,” “describe,” and “opinion,” which are
also likely to appear in messages whose topics are very different from
“Trump is a racist.”

• By aggregating messages based on conversations, TOPIC ONLY yields the
topic competitive to the one produced by a state-of-the-art BTM model.
The reason behind this observation could be that the conversation context
provides rich word co-occurrence patterns in topic induction, which is
beneficial to alleviate the data sparsity.

• The topics produced by TOPIC+DISC and TOPIC+DISC+REL contain fewer
non-topic words than TOPIC ONLY, which does not consider discourse
information when generating topics, and thus contains many general
words, such as “thing” and “work,” which cannot clearly indicate
“Trump is a racist.”

• The topic generated by TOPIC+DISC+REL best describes the topic “Trump
is a racist” except for a non-topic word “call” at the end of the list. This is
because it successfully discovers messages with discourse roles that are
more likely to cover words describing the key focus in the conversations
centering on “Trump is a racist.” Without capturing such information, the
topic produced by TOPIC+DISC contains some non-topic words like “yeah”
and “agree.”

21 If there are multiple latent topics related to “Trump is a racist,” we pick up the most relevant one and
display its representative words.

22 Non-topic words cannot clearly indicate the corresponding topic. Such words can occur in messages
covering very different topics. For example, in Table 4, the word “opinion” is a non-topic word for
“Trump is a racist,” because an “opinion” can be voiced on diverse people, events, entities, and so on.

Sample Discourse Roles. To show the discourse representation exploited by our
TOPIC+DISC+REL model, we then present the sample discourse roles learned from the
PHEME data set in Table 5. Although this is merely a qualitative human judgment,
there appear to be interesting word clusters that reflect varying discourse roles found by
our model without the guidance from any manual annotation on discourse. In the first
column of Table 5, we intuitively name the sample generated discourse roles, which are
based on our interpretations of the word cluster, and are provided to benefit the reader.
We discuss each displayed discourse role in turn:

• Statement presents arguments and judgments, where words like “should,”
and “need” are widely used in suggestions and “if” occurs when
conditions are given.

737



Computational Linguistics Volume 44, Number 4

• Reaction expresses non-argumentative opinions. Compared with
“statement” messages, “reaction” messages are straightforward and
generally do not contain detailed explanations (e.g., conditions). Examples
include simple feeling expressions, indicated by “oh” and “!!!,” and
acknowledgements, indicated by “thank” or “thanks.”

• Question represents users asking questions to other users, implied by the
question mark “?,” “what,” “why,” and so forth.

• Doubt expresses strong opinions against something. Examples of indicative
words include “but,” “don’t,” “just,” the question mark “?,” and so on.

• Reference is for quoting external resource, which is implied by words like
“from,” colon, and quotation marks. The use of hashtags23 and URLs are
also prominent.

5. Downstream Application: Conversation Summarization on Microblogs

Section 4 has shown that conversational discourse is helpful to recognizing key topical
information from short and informal microblog messages. We are interested in whether
the induced topic and discourse representations can also benefit downstream appli-
cations. Here we take microblog summarization as an example that suffers from the
data sparsity problem (Chang et al. 2013; Li et al. 2015a), similar to topic modeling on
short texts. In this article, we focus on a subtask of microblog summarization, namely,
microblog conversation summarization, and present an empirical study to show how
our output can be used to predict critical content in conversations.

We first present the task description. Given a conversation tree, succinct summaries
should be produced by extracting salient content from the massive reposting and
replying messages in the conversation. It helps users understand the key focus of a
microblog conversation. It is also called microblog context summarization in some
previous work (Chang et al. 2013; Li et al. 2015a), because the produced summaries
capture informative content in the lengthy conversations and provide valuable contexts
to a short post, such as the background information and public opinions. In this task,
the input is a microblog conversation tree, such as the one shown in Figure 1, and the
output is a subset of replying or reposting messages covering salient content of the
input post.

5.1 Data Collection and Experiment Set-up

We conduct an empirical study on the outputs of our joint model on microblog con-
versation summarization, whose data preparation and set-up processes are presented
in this section.

Data Sets. Our experiments are conducted on a large-scale corpus containing ten large
conversation trees collected from Sina Weibo, which is released by our prior work
(Li et al. 2015a) and constructed following the settings described in Chang et al. (2013).
The conversation trees discuss hot events taking place during 2 January to 28 July 2014,

23 On Twitter, a hashtag serves as a special URL, which can link other messages sharing the same hashtag.

and are crawled using the PKUVIS toolkit (Ren et al. 2014). The detailed descriptions
of the ten conversation trees are shown in Table 6. As can be observed, more than 12K
messages on average and covers discussions about social issues, breaking news, jokes,
celebrity scandals, love, and fashion, which matches the official list of typical categories
for microblog posts released by Sina Weibo.24 For each conversation tree, three experi-
enced editors are invited to write summaries. Based on the manual summaries written
by them, we conduct ROUGE evaluation, shown in Section 5.2.

Though compared with many other tasks in the NLP and information retrieval
community, the corpus looks relatively small. However, to the best of our knowledge,
it is currently the only publicly available data set for conversation summarization.25 It
is difficult and time-consuming for human editors to write summaries for conversa-
tion trees because of the substantial number of nodes and complex structure involved
(Chang et al. 2013); in fact, it would be impossible for human editors to reconstruct
conversation trees in a reasonable amount of time. In the evaluation for each tree, we
compute the average ROUGE F1 score between the model-generated summary and the
three human-generated summaries.

Summary Extraction. Here we describe how summaries are produced given the outputs
of topics models. For each conversation tree c, given the latent topics produced by topic
models, we use a content word distribution γc to describe its core focus and topic.
Equation (1) shows the formula to compute γc.

γc,v = Pr(v is a TOPIC word in c) =
K∑

k=1

θc,k ·φTk,v (1)

We further plug in γc to the criterion proposed by Haghighi and Vanderwende (2009).
The goal is to extract L messages to form a summary set E∗c that closely matches

24 d.weibo.com/.
25 The corpus of Chang et al. (2013) is not publicly available.

739

d.weibo.com/


Computational Linguistics Volume 44, Number 4

γc. In our joint model, salient content of tree c is captured without including back-
ground noise (modeled with φB) or discourse indicative words (modeled with δDd ).
Following Haghighi and Vanderwende (2009), conversation summarization is cast into
the following Integer Programming problem:

E∗c = arg min|Ec|=L
KL(γc||U(Ec)) (2)

where U(Ec) denotes the empirical unigram distribution of the candidate summary set
Ec and KL(P||Q) is the Kullback-Lieber (KL) divergence defined as

∑
w P(w) log

P(w)
Q(w) .

26

In implementation, as globally optimizing Equation (2) is exponential in the total num-
ber of messages in a conversation, which is a non-deterministic polynomial-time (NP)
problem, we use the greedy approximation adopted in Haghighi and Vanderwende
(2009) for local optimization. Specifically, messages are greedily added to a summary so
long as they minimize the KL-divergence in the current step.

Comparisons. We consider baselines that rank and select messages by (1) LENGTH; (2)
POPULARITY (# of reposts and replies); (3) USER influence (# of authors’ followers); and
(4) message–message text similarities using LEXRANK (Erkan and Radev 2004). We also
consider two state-of-the-art summarizers in comparison: (1) CHANG ET AL. (2013), a
fully supervised summarizer with manually crafted features; and (2) LI ET AL. (2015A), a
random walk variant summarizer incorporating outputs of supervised discourse tagger.
In addition, we compare the summaries extracted based on the topics yielded by our
TOPIC+DISC+REL model with those based on the outputs of its variants (i.e., TOPIC ONLY
and TOPIC+DISC).

Preprocessing. For baselines and the two state-of-the-art summarizers, we filter out
non-Chinese characters in a preprocessing step following their common settings.27

For summarization systems based on our topic model variants (i.e., TOPIC ONLY,
TOPIC+DISC, and TOPIC+DISC+REL), the hyper-parameters and preprocessing steps
are kept the same as in Section 4.1.

5.2 ROUGE Comparison

We quantitatively evaluate the performance of summarizers using ROUGE scores (Lin
2004) as a benchmark, a widely used standard for automatic summarization evaluation
based on the overlapping units between a produced summary and a gold-standard
reference. Specifically, Table 7 reports ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, and ROUGE-
SU4 output by ROUGE 1.5.5.28 From the results, we can observe that:

26 To ensure the value of KL-divergence to be finite, we smooth U(Ec ) with β, which also serves as the
smoothing parameter of φTk (Section 3).

27 We have also conducted evaluations on the versions without this preprocessing step, and they gave
worse ROUGE scores.

28 github.com/summanlp/evaluation/tree/master/ROUGE-RELEASE-1.5.5. Note that the absolute scores
of comparison models here are different from those reported in Li et al. (2015a). Because the ROUGE
scores reported here are given by ROUGE 1.5.5, whereas Li et al. (2015a) uses the Dragon toolkit (Zhou,
Zhang, and Hu 2007) for ROUGE calculation. Despite the difference in absolute scores, the trends
reported here remain similar to Li et al. (2015a).

Li et al. A Joint Model of Discourse and Topics on Microblogs

• Simple features are not effective for summarization. The poor
performance of all baselines demonstrates that microblog summarization
is a challenging task. It is not possible to trivially rely on simple features
such as length, message popularity, user influence, or text similarities to
identify summary-worthy messages because of the colloquialness, noise,
and redundancy exhibited in microblog texts.

• Discourse can indicate summary-worthy content. The summarization
system based on the TOPIC+DISC+REL model has generally better ROUGE
scores than the TOPIC+DISC based system. It also yields competitive
and even slightly better results than Li et al. (2015a), which relies on a

supervised discourse tagger. These observations demonstrate that
TOPIC+DISC+REL, without requiring gold-standard discourse annotation,
is able to discover the discourse roles that are likely to convey topical
words, which further reflect salient content for conversation
summarization.

• Directly applying the outputs of our joint model of discourse and topics to
summarization might not be perfect. In general, the TOPIC+DISC+REL
based system achieves the best F1 scores in ROUGE comparison, which
implies that the yielded discourse and topic representations can somehow
indicate summary-worthy content, although large margin improvements
are not observed. In Section 5.4, we will analyze the errors and present a
potential solution for further improving summarization results.

5.3 Human Evaluation Results

To further evaluate the generated summaries, we conduct human evaluations on in-
formativeness (Info), conciseness (Conc), and readability (Read) of the extracted sum-
maries. Two native Chinese speakers are invited to read the output summaries and
subjectively rate on a 1–5 Likert scale and in 0.5 units, where a higher rating indicates
better quality. Their overall inter-rater agreement achieves Krippendorff’s α of 0.73,
which indicates reliable results (Krippendorff 2004). Table 8 shows the average ratings
by the two raters and over ten conversation trees.

As can be seen, despite of the closing results produced by supervised and well-
performed unsupervised systems in automatic ROUGE evaluation (shown in Sec-
tion 5.2), when the outputs are judged by humans, supervised systems CHANG ET AL.

Table 8
Overall human ratings on summaries produced by varying summarization systems. Info, Conc,
Read are short forms of informativeness, conciseness, and readability, respectively. The ratings

(2013) and LI ET AL. (2015A), with supervision on summarization and discourse re-
spectively, achieve much higher ratings than unsupervised systems on all three criteria.
This observation demonstrates that microblog conversation summarization is essen-
tially challenging, where manual annotations (although with high cost in time and
efforts involved) can provide useful clues in guiding systems to produce summaries that
will be liked by humans. Particularly, the ratings given to LI ET AL. (2015A) are higher
than all systems in comparison by large margins, which indicates that the human-
annotated discourse can well indicate summary-worthy content and also confirms the
usefulness of considering discourse in microblog conversation summarization.

Among unsupervised methods, the summarization results based on our TOPIC+
DISC+REL model achieves generally better ratings than other comparison methods. The
possible reasons are: (1) When separating topic words from discourse and background
words, it also filters out irrelevant noise and distills important content. (2) It can exploit
the tendencies of messages with varying discourse roles in containing core content, thus
is able to identify “bad” discourse roles that bring redundancy or irrelevant words,
which disturbs reading experience.

To further analyze the generated summaries, we conduct a case study and display a
sample summary, generated based on the TOPIC+DISC+REL model in Table 9. In this
case, the input conversation is about the sexism issue in Chinese college entrance.
As we can see, the produced summary covers salient comments that are helpful in
understanding public opinions toward the gender discrimination problem. However,
taking a closer look at the produced summaries, we observe that the system selects
messages that contain sentiment-only information, such as “Good point! I have to repost
this!,” and therefore affects the quality of the generated summary. The observation from
this summary case suggests that, in addition to discourse and background, a sentiment
component should be effectively captured and well separated for further improving the
summarization results. The potential extension of the current summarization system to
additionally incorporate sentiment will be discussed in Section 5.4.

5.4 Error Analysis and Further Discussions

Taking a closer look at our produced summaries, one major source of incorrect selec-
tion of summary-worthy messages is based on the fact that sentiment is prevalent on
microblog conversations, such as “love” in [R5] and “poor” in [R6] of Figure 1. Without
an additional separation of sentiment-specific information, the yielded topic represen-
tations might be mixed with sentiment components. For example, in Table 4, the topic
generated by the TOPIC+DISC+REL model contains sentiment words like “wrong” and
“hate.” Therefore, a direct use of the topic representations to extract summaries will
unavoidably select messages that mostly reflect sentimental component, which is also
illustrated by the case study in Section 5.3.

Therefore, we argue that reliable estimation of the summary-worthy content in
microblog conversations requires additional consideration of sentiment, because sen-
timent can also be represented by word distributions and captured via topic models in
an unsupervised or weakly supervised manner (Lin and He 2009; Jo and Oh 2011; Lim
and Buntine 2014). In future work, we can propose another model based on our joint
model TOPIC+DISC+REL that can additionally separate sentiment word representations
from discourse and topics. Lazaridou, Titov, and Sporleder (2013) have demonstrated
that sentiment shifts can indicate sentence-level discourse functions in product reviews.
We can then hypothesize that modeling discourse roles of messages can also benefit

Root message of the conversation:

近日，各高校招生录取分数纷纷出炉，国际关系学院等院校分数线设置女高男低，引起了广州一
位女大学生的关注。她认为这种做法对女考生很不公平，于是写信给国家主席习近平，希望能关
注高考录取中的性别歧视现象，重视女性在科技国防军事中的力量。
Recently, the admission criteria for colleges are coming out. Women should get better grades
in College Entrance Exam to go to colleges like University of International Relations. A female
undergraduate student in Guangzhou was concerned about the unfair treatment. She wrote
a letter to President Xi Jinping for reducing gender discrimination in college admission and
emphasized the important role female plays in technology and military.

The produced summary:

以保护之名提高女性受教育门槛，实质上是一种“把女性视为弱者”的社会刻板印象作祟，这违
背了联合国《消除对妇女一切形式歧视公约》中”保护性歧视“的规定。再者，”本专业需要多
熬夜女生吃不消“这一理由并不正当，难道分数线以上考进去的女生的生理健康就不需要保护
了吗？分数高的学生更能熬夜？ Raising the bar for women to get education in order to protect
them is ascribed to a stereotype of “women are weaker sex.” This is “special protections for women” in
“The Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women” released by UN.
Besides, “students in our department should stay up to learn” is not an appropriate reason. What
about their female students? Don’t they have to take care of their physical health? Or students
achieving higher grades don’t need much sleep?
嗯其实. . .要是没有分数差不限制男女比例的话. . .学校里男生又会特别少抱怨的还会是我们妹子
自己啦. . .所以. . .多方面看吧 In fact, we need to use different admission criteria to avoid gender
imbalance. If a college has too few boys, girls will complain. Every coin has two sides.
因为大学都承认男人就是不如女人啊，呵呵 Because colleges admit that women are better than
men, hehe.
以前看到的一则新闻说的是为了调整语言类专业的男女比例，下调男考生的录取分数线。如果像
这样以女生体质为借口，那同样寒窗苦读十二载，女生的成绩分量不应该更重才对么？希望习大
大能看到吧An earlier news reported that men could be admitted with worse grades than women
for encouraging men to study language. If women do have worse physical condition, then it is
more difficult for women to get the same grades as men. Women should have lower bar in college
admission. I hope President Xi can see this.
说怕体力吃不消严格要求体育分也就罢了，文化分数高低能作为一个人适不适合一个工作辛苦
的岗位的理由么？ If they are concerned about physical conditions of women, then they should
require a test in PE. Why use paper based exam to test physical conditions?
说得好！必须转～ Good point! I have to repost this.
哈哈哈，国关课业繁重经常熬夜～ Hahaha, the workload in International Relations is so heavy
that students should stay up to learn.
女性普遍比男生更努力却换来不同的的结果，要我说男女平等，男性角色弱化无可厚非，抱着几
千年的传统观念看今天的男生是不行的，男孩危机是个伪命题，况且真有本事不至于就在学校
受益 Generally, women work harder than men but have worse endings. For gender equality, it is
alright to weaken the role of men. We should have a different view on the boys today. “The boy
crisis” is nonsense. Besides, you can still be a great guy without education.
这难道就是女性为什么越来越优秀，而男性越来越丝的部分原因？呵呵。男同胞要感谢性别
歧视，让他们越来越弱了。 Isn’t this part of the reason why women become more and more
excellent while men go to the opposite direction? Interesting. Men should appreciate for sexism,
which makes them weaker and weaker.

from exploring sentiment shifts in conversations. As it might be out of the scope of
this article to thoroughly explore the joint effects of topic, discourse, and sentiment on
microblog conversation summarization, we hence leave the study on such extended
model to future work.

Li et al. A Joint Model of Discourse and Topics on Microblogs

6. Conclusion and Future Work

In this article, we have presented a novel topic model for microblog messages that
allows the joint induction of conversational discourse and latent topics in a fully un-
supervised manner. By comparing our joint model with a number of competitive topic
models on real-world microblog data sets, we have demonstrated the effectiveness
of using conversational discourse structure to help in identifying topical content em-
bedded in short and colloquial microblog messages. Moreover, our empirical study
on microblog conversation summarization has shown that the produced discourse
and topical representations can also predict summary-worthy content. Both ROUGE
evaluation and human assessment have demonstrated that the summaries generated
based on the outputs of our joint model are informative, concise, and easy-to-read. Error
analysis on the produced summaries has shown that sentiment should be effectively
captured and separated to further advance our current summarization system forward.
As a result, the joint effects of discourse, topic, and sentiment on microblog conversation
summarization is worth exploring in future study.

For other lines of future work, one potential is to extend our joint model to identify
topic hierarchies from microblog conversation trees. In doing so, one could learn how
topics change in a microblog conversation along a certain hierarchical path. Another
potential line is to combine our work with representation learning on social media.
Although some previous studies have provided intriguing approaches to learning rep-
resentations at the level of words (Mikolov et al. 2013; Mikolov, Yih, and Zweig 2013),
sentences (Le and Mikolov 2014), and paragraphs (Kiros et al. 2015), they are limited
in modeling social media content with colloquial relations. Following similar ideas in
this work, where discourse and topics are jointly explored, we can conduct other types
of representation learning, embeddings for words (Li et al. 2017b), messages (Dhingra
et al. 2016), or users (Ding, Bickel, and Pan 2017), in the context of conversations, which
should complement social media representation learning and vice versa.

Appendix A

In this section, we present the key steps for inferring our joint model of conversational
discourse and latent topics. Its generation process has been described in Section 3.
As described in Section 3, we use collapsed Gibbs sampling (Griffiths et al. 2004) for
model inference. Before providing the formula of sampling steps, we first define the
notations of all variables used in the formulations of Gibbs sampling, described in
Table A.1. In particular, the various C variables refer to counts excluding the message m
on conversation tree c.
