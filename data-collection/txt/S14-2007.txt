Abstract

This paper describes the SemEval-2014,
Task 7 on the Analysis of Clinical Text
and presents the evaluation results. It fo-
cused on two subtasks: (i) identification
(Task A) and (ii) normalization (Task B)
of diseases and disorders in clinical reports
as annotated in the Shared Annotated Re-
sources (ShARe)1 corpus. This task was
a follow-up to the ShARe/CLEF eHealth
2013 shared task, subtasks 1a and 1b,2 but
using a larger test set. A total of 21 teams
competed in Task A, and 18 of those also
participated in Task B. For Task A, the
best system had a strict F1-score of 81.3,
with a precision of 84.3 and recall of 78.6.
For Task B, the same group had the best
strict accuracy of 74.1. The organizers
have made the text corpora, annotations,
and evaluation tools available for future re-
search and development at the shared task
website.3

1 Introduction

A large amount of very useful information—both
for medical researchers and patients—is present
in the form of unstructured text within the clin-
ical notes and discharge summaries that form a
patient’s medical history. Adapting and extend-
ing natural language processing (NLP) techniques
to mine this information can open doors to bet-
ter, novel, clinical studies on one hand, and help
patients understand the contents of their clini-
cal records on the other. Organization of this

shared task helps establish state-of-the-art bench-
marks and paves the way for further explorations.
It tackles two important sub-problems in NLP—
named entity recognition and word sense disam-
biguation. Neither of these problems are new to
NLP. Research in general-domain NLP goes back
to about two decades. For an overview of the
development in the field through roughly 2009,
we refer the refer to Nadeau and Sekine (2007).
NLP has also penetrated the field of bimedical
informatics and has been particularly focused on
biomedical literature for over the past decade. Ad-
vances in that sub-field has also been documented
in surveys such as one by Leaman and Gonza-
lez (2008). Word sense disambiguation also has
a long history in the general NLP domain (Nav-
igli, 2009). In spite of word sense annotations in
the biomedical literature, recent work by Savova
et al. (2008) highlights the importance of annotat-
ing them in clinical notes. This is true for many
other clinical and linguistic phenomena as the var-
ious characteristics of the clinical narrative present
a unique challenge to NLP. Recently various ini-
tiatives have led to annotated corpora for clini-
cal NLP research. Probably the first comprehen-
sive annotation performed on a clinical corpora
was by Roberts et al. (2009), but unfortunately
that corpus is not publicly available owing to pri-
vacy regulations. The i2b2 initiative4 challenges
have focused on such topics as concept recog-
nition (Uzuner et al., 2011), coreference resolu-
tion (Uzuner et al., 2012), temporal relations (Sun
et al., 2013) and their datasets are available to the
community. More recently, the Shared Annotated
Resources (ShARe)1 project has created a corpus
annotated with disease/disorder mentions in clini-
cal notes as well as normalized them to a concept
unique identifier (CUI) within the SNOMED-CT
subset of the Unified Medical Language System5

Table 1: Distribution of data in terms of notes and disorder mentions across the training, development
and test sets. The disorders are further split according to two criteria – whether they map to a CUI or
whether they are contiguous.

(UMLS) (Campbell et al., 1998). The task of nor-
malization is a combination of word/phrase sense
disambiguation and semantic similarity where a
phrase is mapped to a unique concept in an on-
tology (based on the description of that concept in
the ontology) after disambiguating potential am-
biguous surface words, or phrases. This is espe-
cially true with abbreviations and acronyms which
are much more common in clinical text (Moon et
al., 2012). The SemEval-2014 task 7 was one of
nine shared tasks organized at the SemEval-2014.
It was designed as a follow up to the shared tasks
organized during the ShARe/CLEF eHealth 2013
evaluation (Suominen et al., 2013; Pradhan et al.,
2013; Pradhan et al., 2014). Like the previous
shared task, we relied on the ShARe corpus, but
with more data for training and a new test set. Fur-
thermore, in this task, we provided the options to
participants to utilize a large corpus of unlabeled
clinical notes. The rest of the paper is organized as
follows. Section 2 describes the characteristics of
the data used in the task. Section 3 describes the
tasks in more detail. Section 4 explains the evalu-
ation criteria for the two tasks. Section 5 lists the
participants of the task. Section 6 discusses the re-
sults on this task and also compares them with the
ShARe/CLEF eHealth 2013 results, and Section 7
concludes.

2 Data

The ShARe corpus comprises annotations over
de-identified clinical reports from a US intensive
care department (version 2.5 of the MIMIC II
database 6) (Saeed et al., 2002). It consists of
discharge summaries, electrocardiogram, echocar-
diogram, and radiology reports. Access to data
was carried out following MIMIC user agreement
requirements for access to de-identified medical

data. Hence, all participants were required to reg-
ister for the evaluation, obtain a US human sub-
jects training certificate7, create an account to the
password-protected MIMIC site, specify the pur-
pose of data usage, accept the data use agree-
ment, and get their account approved. The anno-
tation focus was on disorder mentions, their var-
ious attributes and normalizations to an UMLS
CUI. As such, there were two parts to the annota-
tion: identifying a span of text as a disorder men-
tion and normalizing (or mapping) the span to a
UMLS CUI. The UMLS represents over 130 lex-
icons/thesauri with terms from a variety of lan-
guages and integrates resources used world-wide
in clinical care, public health, and epidemiology.
A disorder mention was defined as any span of text
which can be mapped to a concept in SNOMED-
CT and which belongs to the Disorder semantic
group8. It also provided a semantic network in
which every concept is represented by its CUI
and is semantically typed (Bodenreider and Mc-
Cray, 2003). A concept was in the Disorder se-
mantic group if it belonged to one of the follow-
ing UMLS semantic types: Congenital Abnormal-
ity; Acquired Abnormality; Injury or Poisoning;
Pathologic Function; Disease or Syndrome; Men-
tal or Behavioral Dysfunction; Cell or Molecu-
lar Dysfunction; Experimental Model of Disease;
Anatomical Abnormality; Neoplastic Process; and
Signs and Symptoms. The Finding semantic type
was left out as it is very noisy and our pilot study
showed lower annotation agreement on it. Follow-
ing are the salient aspects of the guidelines used to

annotate the data.

• Annotations represent the most specific dis-
order span. For example, small bowel ob-
struction is preferred over bowel obstruction.
• A disorder mention is a concept in the

SNOMED-CT portion of the Disorder se-
mantic group.
• Negation and temporal modifiers are not con-

sidered part of the disorder mention span.
• All disorder mentions are annotated—even

the ones related to a person other than the pa-
tient and including acronyms and abbrevia-
tions.
• Mentions of disorders that are coreferen-

tial/anaphoric are also annotated.

Following are a few examples of disorder men-
tions from the data.

Patient found to have lower extremity DVT. (E1)

In example (E1), lower extremity DVT is marked
as the disorder. It corresponds to CUI C0340708
(preferred term: Deep vein thrombosis of lower
limb). The span DVT can be mapped to CUI
C0149871 (preferred term: Deep Vein Thrombo-
sis), but this mapping would be incorrect because
it is part of a more specific disorder in the sen-
tence, namely lower extremity DVT.

A tumor was found in the left ovary. (E2)

In example (E2), tumor ... ovary is annotated as a
discontiguous disorder mention. This is the best
method of capturing the exact disorder mention
in clinical notes and its novelty is in the fact that
either such phenomena have not been seen fre-
quently enough in the general domain to gather
particular attention, or the lack of a manually
curated general domain ontology parallel to the
UMLS.

Patient admitted with low blood pressure. (E3)

There are some disorders that do not have a rep-
resentation to a CUI as part of the SNOMED CT
within the UMLS. However, if they were deemed
important by the annotators then they were anno-
tated as CUI-less mentions. In example (E3), low
blood pressure is a finding and is normalized as
a CUI-less disorder. We constructed the annota-
tion guidelines to require that the disorder be a
reasonable synonym of the lexical description of a
SNOMED-CT disorder. There are a few instances
where the disorders are abbreviated or shortened

in the clinical note. One example is w/r/r, which
is an abbreviation for concepts wheezing (CUI
C0043144), rales (CUI C0034642), and ronchi
(CUI C0035508). This abbreviation is also some-
times written as r/w/r and r/r/w. Another is gsw for
gunshot wound and tachy for tachycardia. More
details on the annotation scheme is detailed in the
guidelines9 and in a forthcoming manuscript. The
annotations covered about 336K words. Table 1
shows the quantity of the data and the split across
the training, development and test sets as well as
in terms of the number of notes and the number of
words.

2.1 Annotation Quality

Each note in the training and development set was
annotated by two professional coders trained for
this task, followed by an open adjudication step.
By the time we reached annotating the test data,
the annotators were quite familiar with the anno-
tation and so, in order to save time, we decided
to perform a single annotation pass using a senior
annotator. This was followed by a correction pass
by the same annotator using a checklist of frequent
annotation issues faced earlier. Table 2 shows the
inter-annotator agreement (IAA) statistics for the
adjudicated data. For the disorders we measure the
agreement in terms of the F1-score as traditional
agreement measures such as Cohen’s kappa and
Krippendorf’s alpha are not applicable for measur-
ing agreement for entity mention annotation. We
computed agreements between the two annotators
as well as between each annotator and the final ad-
judicated gold standard. The latter is to give a
sense of the fraction of corrections made in the
process of adjudication. The strict criterion con-
siders two mentions correct if they agree in terms
of the class and the exact string, whereas the re-
laxed criteria considers overlapping strings of the

same class as correct. The reason for checking
the class is as follows. Although we only use the
disorder mention in this task, the corpus has been
annotated with some other UMLS types as well
and therefore there are instances where a differ-
ent UMLS type is assigned to the same character
span in the text by the second annotator. If exact
boundaries are not taken into account then the IAA
agreement score is in the mid-90s. For the task of
normalization to CUIs, we used accuracy to assess
agreement. For the relaxed criterion, all overlap-
ping disorder spans with the same CUI were con-
sidered correct. For the strict criterion, only disor-
der spans with identical spans and the same CUI
were considered correct.

3 Task Description

The participants were evaluated on the following
two tasks:

• Task A – Identification of the character spans
of disorder mentions.

• Task B – Normalizing disorder mentions to
SNOMED-CT subset of UMLS CUIs.

For Task A, participants were instructed to develop
a system that predicts the spans for disorder men-
tions. For Tasks B, participants were instructed
to develop a system that predicts the UMLS CUI
within the SNOMED-CT vocabulary. The input to
Task B were the disorder mention predictions from
Task A. Task B was optional. System outputs ad-
hered to the annotation format. Each participant
was allowed to submit up to three runs. The en-

tire set of unlabeled MIMIC clinical notes (exclud-
ing the test notes) were made available to the par-
ticipants for potential unsupervised approaches to
enhance the performance of their systems. They
were allowed to use additional annotations in their
systems, but this counted towards the total allow-
able runs; systems that used annotations outside
of those provided were evaluated separately. The
evaluation for all tasks was conducted using the
blind, withheld test data. The participants were
provided a training set containing clinical text as
well as pre-annotated spans and named entities for
disorders (Tasks A and B).

4 Evaluation Criteria

The following evaluation criteria were used:

• Task A – The system performance was eval-
uated against the gold standard using the
F1-score of the Precision and Recall values.
There were two variations: (i) Strict; and (ii)
Relaxed. The formulae for computing these
metrics are mentioned below.

Precision = P =
Dtp

Dtp + Dfp
(1)

Recall = R =
Dtp

Dtp + Dfn
(2)

Where, Dtp = Number of true positives dis-
order mentions; Dfp = Number of false pos-
itives disorder mentions; Dfn = Number of
false negative disorder mentions. In the strict
case, a span was counted as correct if it was
identical to the gold standard span, whereas

in the relaxed case, a span overlapping with
the gold standard span was also considered
correct.

• Task B – Accuracy was used as the perfor-
mance measure for Task 1b. It was defined as
follows:

Accuracystrict =
Dtp ∩Ncorrect

Tg
(3)

Accuracyrelaxed =
Dtp ∩Ncorrect

Dtp
(4)

Where, Dtp = Number of true positive disor-
der mentions with identical spans as in the
gold standard; Ncorrect = Number of cor-
rectly normalized disorder mentions; and Tg
= Total number of disorder mentions in the
gold standard. For Task B, the systems were
only evaluated on annotations they identified
in Task A. Relaxed accuracy only measured
the ability to normalize correct spans. There-
fore, it was possible to obtain very high val-
ues for this measure by simply dropping any
mention with a low confidence span.

5 Participants

A total of 21 participants from across the world
participated in Task A and out of them 18 also par-
ticipated in Task B. Unfortunately, although inter-
ested, the ThinkMiners team (Parikh et al., 2014)
could not participate in Task B owing to some
UMLS licensing issues. The participating organi-
zations along with the contact user’s User ID and
their chosen Team ID are mentioned in Table 3.
Eight teams submitted three runs, six submitted
two runs and seven submitted just one run. Out
of these, only 13 submitted system description pa-
pers. We based our analysis on those system de-
scriptions.

6 System Results

Tables 4 and 6 show the performance of the sys-
tems on Tasks A and B. None of the systems used
any additional annotated data so we did not have
to compare them separately. Both tables mention
performance of all the different runs that the sys-
tems submitted. Given the many variables, we de-
liberately left the decision on how many and how
to define these runs to the individual participant.
They used various different ways to differentiate
their runs. Some, for example, UTU (Kaewphan et

al., 2014), did it based on the composition of train-
ing data, i.e., whether they used just the training
data or both the training and the development data
for training the final system, which highlighted
the fact that adding development data to training
bumped the F1-score on Task A by about 2 percent
points. Some participants, however, did not make
use of the development data in training their sys-
tems. This was partially due to the fact that we had
not explicitly mentioned in the task description
that participants were allowed to use the develop-
ment data for training their final models. In order
to be fair, we allowed some users an opportunity
to submit runs post evaluation where they used the
exact same system that they used for evaluation
but used the development data as well. We added
a column to the results tables showing whether the
participant used only the training data (T) or both
training and development data (T+D) for training
their system. It can be seen that even though the
addition of development data helps, there are still
systems that perform in the lower percentile who
have used both training and development data for
training, indicating that both the features and the
machine learning classifier contribute to the mod-
els. A novel aspect of the SemEval-2014 shared
task that differentiates it from the ShARE/CLEF
task—other than the fact that it used more data and
a new test set—is the fact that SemEval-2014 al-
lowed the use of a much larger set of unlabeled
MIMIC notes to inform the models. Surprisingly,
only two of the systems (ULisboa (Leal et al.,
2014) and UniPi (Attardi et al., 2014)) used the
unlabeled MIMIC corpus to generalize the lexical
features. Another team—UTH CCB(Zhang et al.,
2014)—used off-the-shelf Brown clusters10 as op-
posed to training them on the unlabeled MIMIC
II data. For Task B, the accuracy of a system
using the strict metric was positively correlated
with its recall on the disorder mentions that were
input to it (i.e., recall for Task A), and did not
get penalized for lower precision. Therefore one
could essentially gain higher accuracy in Task B
by tuning a system to provide the highest men-
tion recall in Task A potentially at the cost of pre-
cision and the overall F1-score and using those
mentions as input for Task B. This can be seen
from the fact that the run 2 for UTH CCB (Zhang
et al., 2014) system with the lowest F1-score has

the best accuracy for Task B and vice-versa for
run 0 with run 1 in between the two. In order to
fairly compare the performance between two sys-
tems one would have to provide perfect mentions
as input to Task B. One of the systems—UWM
Ghiasvand and Kate (2014)—did run some abla-
tion experiments using gold standard mentions as
input to Task B and obtained a best performance
of 89.5F1-score (Table 5 of Ghiasvand and Kate
(2014)) as opposed to 62.3 F1-score (Table 7) in
the more realistic setting which is a huge differ-
ence. In the upcoming SemEval-2014 where this
same evaluation is going to carried out under Task
14, we plan to perform supplementary evaluation
where gold disorder mentions would be input to
the system while attempting Task B. An inter-
esting outcome of planning a follow-on evalua-
tion to the ShARe/CLEF eHealth 2013 task was
that we could, and did, use the test data from the
ShARe/CLEF eHealth 2013 task as the develop-
ment set for this evaluation. After the main eval-
uation we asked participants to provide the sys-
tem performance on the development set using the
same number and run convention that they submit-
ted for the main evaluation. These results are pre-
sented in Tables 5 and 7. We have inserted the best
performing system score from the ShARe/CLEF
eHealth 2013 task in these tables. For Task A, re-
ferring to Tables 4 and 5, there is a boost of 3.7
absolute percent points for the F1-score over the
same task (Task 1a) in the ShARe/CLEF eHealth
2013. For Task B, referring to Tables 6 and 7, there
is a boost of 13.7 percent points for the F1-score
over the same task (Task 1b) in the ShARe/CLEF
eHealth 2013 evaluation. The participants used
various approaches for tackling the tasks, rang-
ing from purely rule-based/unsupervised (RelA-
gent (Ramanan and Nathan, 2014), (Matos et
al., 2014), KUL11) to a hybrid of rules and ma-
chine learning classifiers. The top performing sys-
tems typically used the latter. Various versions
of the IOB formulation were used for tagging the
disorder mentions. None of the standard varia-
tions on the IOB formulation were explicitly de-
signed or used to handle discontiguous mentions.
Some systems used novel variations on this ap-
proach. Probably the simplest variation was ap-
plied by the UWM team (Ghiasvand and Kate,
2014). In this formulation the following labeled
sequence “the/O left/B atrium/I is/O moderately/O

dilated/I” can be used to represent the discontigu-
ous mention left atrium...dilated, and can be con-
structed as such from the output of the classifica-
tion. The most complex variation was the one used
by the UTH CCB team (Zhang et al., 2014) where
they used the following set of tags—B, I, O, DB,
DI, HB, HI. This variation encodes discontiguous
mentions by adding four more tags to the I, O and
B tags. These are variations of the B and I tags
with either a D or a H prefix. The prefix H indi-
cates that the word or word sequence is the shared
head, and the prefix D indicates otherwise. An-
other intermediate approach used by the ULisboa
team (Leal et al., 2014) with the tagset—S, B, I,
O, E and N. Here, S represents the single token
entity to be recognized, E represents the end of an
entity (which is part of one of the prior IOB vari-
ations) and an N tag to identify non-contiguous
mentions. They don’t provide an explicit exam-
ple usage of this tag set in their paper. Yet another
variation was used by the SZTE-NLP team (Ka-
tona and Farkas, 2014). This used tags B, I, L, O
and U. Here, L is used for the last token similar to
E earlier, and U is used for a unit-token mention,
similar to S earlier. We believe that the only ap-
proach that can distinguish between discontiguous
disorders that share the same head word/phrase is
the one used by the UTH CCB team (Zhang et
al., 2014). The participants used various machine
learning classifiers such as MaxEnt, SVM, CRF in
combination with rich syntactic and semantic fea-
tures to capture the disorder mentions. As men-
tioned earlier, a few participants used the avail-
able unlabeled data and also off-the-shelf clusters
to better generalize features. The use of vector
space models such as cosine similarities as well
as continuous distributed word vector representa-
tions was useful in the normalization task. They
also availed of tools such as MetaMap and cTakes
to generate features as well as candidate CUIs dur-
ing normalizations.

7 Conclusion

We have created a reference standard with high
inter-annotator agreement and evaluated systems
on the task of identification and normalization
of diseases and disorders appearing in clinical
reports. The results have demonstrated that an
NLP system can complete this task with reason-
ably high accuracy. We plan to annotate another
evaluation using the same data as part of the in

the SemEval-2015, Task 1412 adding another task
of template filling where the systems will iden-
tify and normalize ten attributes the identified dis-
ease/disorder mentions.
