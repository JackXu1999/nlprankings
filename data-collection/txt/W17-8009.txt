Abstract

We describe a method which extracts As-
sociation Rules from texts in order to
recognise verbalisations of risk factors.
Usually some basic vocabulary about risk
factors is known but medical conditions
are expressed in clinical narratives with
much higher variety. We propose an ap-
proach for data-driven learning of spe-
cialised medical vocabulary which, once
collected, enables early alerting of po-
tentially affected patients. The method
is illustrated by experimens with clinical
records of patients with Chronic Obstruc-
tive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and co-
morbidity of CORD, Diabetes Melitus and
Schizophrenia. Our input data come from
the Bulgarian Diabetic Register, which is
built using a pseudonymised collection of
outpatient records for about 500,000 di-
abetic patients. The generated Associa-
tion Rules for CORD are analysed in the
context of demographic, gender, and age
information. Valuable anounts of mean-
ingful words, signalling risk factors, are
discovered with high precision and conﬁ-
dence.
Introduction

1
Chronic diseases like Chronic Obstructive Pul-
monary Disease (COPD) and Diabetes Mellitus
are long-lasting disorders with effects that come
with time. They are the result of a combination
of genetic, physiological, environmental and be-
haviours factors, and kill over 40 million people
each year, equivalent to 70% of all deaths glob-
ally1. Prevention is focused on reducing the risk

factors associated with these diseases. Therefore,
establishing the risk rates and early recognition
of potential danger will help to decrease the role
of the common modiﬁable risk factors.
In the
age of big data and given the growing amount of
patient-related texts, we believe that Data Mining
and Text Mining are key technologies which might
help by providing discovery of hidden interdepen-
dencies among words (lexical expressions of indi-
cators and assessment of risks) in patient records.
In this paper we demonstrate how automatic
analysis of clinical narratives in Bulgarian lan-
guage allows to identify verbal expressions of
risks for patients. Our input data come from the
Bulgarian Diabetic Register, which is built using
a pseudonymised collection of outpatient records
for about 500,000 diabetic patients treated in the
period 2010-2016 (Tcharaktchiev et al., 2015).
Together with the structured information, the out-
patient records contain free texts discussing the
patient case history, status, risk factors, treatment
etc. Our tools process both structured data and free
text of outpatient records in order to extract Asso-
ciation Rules for COPD risk factors. Since Dia-
betes Melitus and Schizophrenia are also closely
related, we study their comorbidity and the risk
factors for COPD in patients with Diabetes Meli-
tus and Schizophrenia. By applying unsupervised
Data Mining techniques we try to overcome the
lack of linguistic and ontological resources that
can support successful NLP analysis of clinical
narratives in Bulgarian. Thus we demonstrate how
new lexical resources can be generated, to be used
for better analysis of clinical texts.

The paper is structured as follows. Section 2
overviews related work with focus on the techno-
logical solutions. Section 3 presents the method
we use, section 4 – the experiments and results.
Section 5 contains the conclusion and discusses
future work.

2 Related Work

Many advanced approaches apply Natural Lan-
guage Processing (NLP) as a ﬁrst step in mining
entities from free texts and use the latter as in-
put to subsequent biomedical research or decision
making tasks. Incorporating NLP has advantages:
it systematically links several terms to a concept
using databases that standardise health terminolo-
gies; avoids manual work for searching term varia-
tions; increases the number of patients in the con-
sidered cohorts and thus increases the sensitivity
of the recognition (Liao et al., 2015). A recent re-
view lists 71 clinical NLP systems, which process
free text and generate structured output, in order to
address a wide variety of important clinical and re-
search tasks (Kreimeyer et al., 2017). Signiﬁcant
progress has been made in algorithm development
and resource construction since 2000 (Luo et al.,
2017). Open challenges remain e.g. extraction of
temporal information, normalisation of concepts
to standard terminologies, interpretation etc. De-
spite the limitations the conclusion is that today
NLP engines are powerful components ready for
integration in medical text processing and – due
to expected improvements in the near future, e.g.
more accurate mappings of terms to medical con-
cepts – the importance of NLP as a valuable sup-
porting technology will grow (Liao et al., 2015).
Here we brieﬂy discuss major text analysis tech-
nologies that are applied in biomedical domain.

Data mining (DM) is actively used in the ﬁeld
since the middle of 1990’s. It employs explorative
algorithms to identify meaningful data patterns
with acceptable computational efﬁciency and un-
cover new biomedical and healthcare knowledge
for clinical and administrative decision making.
Furthermore it can generate testable evidence-
based medical hypotheses from large experimental
data, clinical databases, and/or biomedical litera-
ture. Today DM is applied for a variety of tasks
operating on biomedical entities extracted from
free texts. For instance (Luo et al., 2017) states
that NLP is a useful tool for extracting information
related to adverse drug events (ADE) and phar-
maceutical products from electronic health record
(EHR) narratives. Since 2012, DM enables suc-
cessful automation of the ADE discovery so the
“NLP-based ADE detection” (as the authors call
it) can be soon integrated in practical systems.
Moreover, the DM capacity for treatment of het-
erogeneous data sources is increasingly adopted.

(Stubbs et al., 2015) present an overview of the
2014 i2b2/UTHealth NLP shared task focused on
identifying medical risk factors related to Coro-
nary Artery Disease (CAD) in the narratives of
longitudinal medical records of diabetic patients.
Twenty teams participated in this track, and sub-
mitted 49 system runs for evaluation. The most
successful system used a combination of external
lexicons, hand-written rules and Support Vector
Machines (a machine learning method). Other ma-
chine learning techniques n use were Conditional
Random Fields and ensembles of classiﬁers (CRF,
Naïve Bayes, and Maximum Entropy). With six
of the top 10 teams achieving F1 scores over 0.90,
and all 10 achieving F1 scores over 0.87, the au-
thors conclude that identiﬁcation of risk factors
and their progression over time is within the reach
of present automated systems. These examples
show that today DM is a key technology for the
successful NLP-based medical applications.

Text mining (TM) aims at the delivering of
meaningful information from texts, e.g. structur-
ing text units into entities and relationships among
them, via NLP applications for shallow analysis.
A widely used system of this type is the open-
source NLP tool for information extraction from
EHR cTAKES (clinical Text Analysis and Knowl-
edge Extraction System)2. Another open source
system is HITEx (Health Information Text Ex-
traction) which extracts some variables of inter-
est from narrative text
(Goryachev et al., 2006).
We mention here two more examples how text
mining delivers useful information about risk fac-
tors and adverse drug events. In (Jonnagaddala
et al., 2015) the authors present a system that dis-
covers in free text EHRs information about age,
gender, total cholesterol (or low-density lipopro-
teins cholesterol LDL-C), high-density lipopro-
teins cholesterol (HDL-C), blood pressure, dia-
betes history and smoking history for a cohort
of 164 diabetic patients. After that the Framing-
ham risk score is calculated to predict the coro-
nary artery disease (CAD) for these patients. The
performance of the text extraction system is reli-
able, however missing data remain a challenging
issue. Over 40% of patients in the ﬁnal cohort are
at high risk of CAD and over 50% of the popu-
lation ﬁtted in the moderate category. The main
limitation was the lack of a systematic evaluation
of the developed text mining system. In (Harpaz

2Ofﬁcial site http://ctakes.apache.org/

66

et al., 2014) the authors state that TM is sufﬁ-
ciently mature to be applied for the extraction of
useful information concerning ADEs from multi-
ple textual sources. Currently such information is
collected by manual expert analysis of clinical trial
notes and spontaneous reports, and the review of
biomedical literature; but progress depends on a
comprehensive approach that examines a diverse
set of potentially complementing data sources in-
cluding EHRs. Posting in social media are another
source of information about ADEs: 2% of patients
and 6% of caregivers share their experiences on-
line, and 18% of all internet users, 31% of all pa-
tients with chronic conditions, and 38% of care-
givers look at online drug reviews3. Despite the
challenges, a large body of research has demon-
strated that the existing TM tools are capable to
extract useful safety-related information from the
aforementioned textual sources.

(Gindl, 2006).

NER and rule-based approaches evolved dur-
ing the last decades from research prototypes to re-
liable NLP technologies. Mature (and constantly
evolving) systems appeared for processing En-
glish clinical texts, e.g. KnowledgeMap Concept
Identiﬁer which processes clinical notes and re-
turns CUIs (Concept Unique Identiﬁers) for the
recognized UMLS terms (Denny et al., 2003) as
well as NegEx, a tool for identiﬁcation and in-
terpretation of negation in English texts (Chap-
man et al., 2001),
Identiﬁcation
of temporal events is a hot topic in biomedical
NLP. In (Chang et al., 2015) it is proposed to
recognise ﬁrst all temporal expressions and then,
after building a temporal model of the context,
to assign the corresponding time attributes for all
recognised concepts with respect to the creation
time of the records. Disease mentions are identi-
ﬁed after that, along with their corresponding risk
factors and medications.
(Chang et al., 2015)
shows the progress in processing named entities
which represent temporal information. Recently,
with the DM development, classical rule-based
systems like NegEx can be outperformed by statis-
tical methods (Uzuner et al., 2009); on the other
hand the rule-based methods prove to be good in
the production of annotated resources and when
writing rules that emulate the knowledge of a do-
main expert (e.g. in ADE discovery).

3 Methods

Our approach (Fig. 1) has ﬁve main phases: (i)
Structured information processing of the ORs in
the repository; (ii) Risk Factors Association Rules
generation from the training set; (iii) Preprocess-
ing of the test sets; (iv) Risk Factors Association
Rules matching on the test sets; (v) Structured in-
formation processing of the patients in risk.

3.1 Structured Data Analysis Methods
The Diabetes Register contains pseudoanonymous
Outpatient Records (OR) in XML format. Most
data necessary for the health management are
structured in ﬁelds with XML tags which present
the Patient ID, the code of doctors’ medical spe-
cialty, region of practice, Date/Time and ID of
the OR. Several free-text ﬁelds contain impor-
tant explanations about the patient: “Anamnesis”,
“Status”, “Clinical examinations” and “Therapy”.
There are also several XML tags for the main diag-
nose and additional diagnoses with their codes ac-
cording to the International Classiﬁcation of Dis-
eases, 10th Revision (ICD-10)4. Each OR con-
tains a main diagnosis with ICD-10 code and ICD-
10 codes of up to 4 additional disorders, i.e.
in
total from 1 to 5 ICD-10 codes.

The study of disorder comorbidities plays an
important role in detection and prevention of pa-
tients at risk. Chronic diseases constitute a major
cause of mortality according to the World Health
Organization (WHO) reports and their study is of
higher importance for healthcare. For discovering
frequent patterns of chronic diseases we use ret-
rospective analysis of population data, by ﬁltering
events with common properties and similar signif-
icance. One of the major approaches to pattern
search is frequent pattern mining (FPM) viewing
the events (objects) as unordered sets. This pre-
liminary work was done over outpatient records
(ORs) of patients with primary diagnose Diabetes
Melitus Type 2 (ICD-10 code E11) (withdrawn
Self-reference). We extracted relatively high num-
ber of frequent patterns containing different men-
tal disorders – ICD-10 codes F00-F99. This re-
sult motivated us to process collection for patients
with Schizophrenia (ICD-10 code F20). The study
collection SD of patients who suffer from both
Schizophrenia and Diabetes Melitus Type 2 was

automatically extracted from the Diabetes Regis-
ter and contains all ORs for these patient in the pe-
riod 2012-2014 - approx. 200,000 ORs for 4,080
patients.

Let H be a chronic disease and there exist a
frequent itemset F of chronic diseases such that
{H, E11, F 20} ⊆ F . The study collection SD is
split into two subsets SH and ST. The collection
SH contains ORs of all patients in SD that also
have diagnosis H. We will call the set SH a train-
ing set. The set ST is formed as ST = SD − SH.
We will call the set ST a test set.

3.2 Risk Factors Association Rules

Generation

Text Analysis has three main phases:
Itemsets
Generation which converts the text documents
into itemsets, Association Rules Generation based
on frequent pattern mining (FPM) techniques and
elicitation of ARs, and Risk Factors Association
Rules Filtering that ﬁlters rules by using keywords
(Fig. 2).

The system processes input texts in unicode
format and is language independent in principle
(stemming and stopword ﬁltering can be replaced
with modules for another language).

Itemsets Generation

3.2.1
Let SH be the training set. We extract for each
OR its parts in XML tags for Anamnesis (Patient
History) and Status and form separate collections
of ORs Anamnesis texts only - SHa, and ORs Sta-
tus texts only - SHh correspondingly. We process
separately the collections SHa and SHh.

Let S be one collection. Each text in S is turned
to a sequence of word stems in their original order,

using blank spaces and punctuation delimiters as
tokenization separators. Stop words and numbers
may be essential for some patterns so they are pre-
served and generalised - replaced by the constants
STOP and NUM correspondingly. After this step
the punctuation is eliminated. Then we use hash-
ing and substitute each word with an unique num-
ber. In addition some compression and sorting is
applied. This is necessary to speed up the frequent
patterns mining process.
The vocabulary used in all documents of S will
be called items W = {w1, w2, ..., wn}. For the
collection S we extract the set of all different doc-
uments P = {p1, p2, ..., pN}, where pi ⊆ W .
This set corresponds to transactions; the associ-
ated unique transaction identiﬁers (tids) shall be
called pids (patient identiﬁers). Each patient in-
teraction with a doctor is viewed as a single docu-
ment in P.

3.2.2 Association Rules Generation
The ORs are written in telegraphic style with
phrases rather than full sentences. Usually the
ORs list attribute-value (A-V) pairs - anatomical
organ/system and its status/condition. Attribute
names contain phrases and abbreviations in Cyril-
lic and Latin. Values can be long descriptions in
case of status complications. The order of A-V
pairs can vary and parts of the value descriptions
can surround the attributes. It is also possible that
some attributes share the same value. Sample on-
ﬁgurations are shown below.

A1V1, ..., AnVn|V1A1, ..., VnAn

V1...VkAVk+1...Vn

A1, A2, ..., AnV |V A1, A2, ..., An.

68

Figure 2: Risk Factors Association Rules Generation

Thus, when searching for frequent patterns,
we consider a window of more than 10-12 words
around each attribute. The rich terminology and
ﬂexible syntax structure hinder the application
of traditional methods for extraction of collo-
cations with gaps. Usual collocation extraction
approaches would rather ﬁnd the OR clishe
phrases as collocations with highest frequency,
moreover many A-V pairs would be erroneously
considered as n-grams. Some FPs are given below.

E.g.: Positive examples:
общо състояние (general condition)
щитовидна жлеза (thyroid gland)
Negative examples:
удължен експириум (prolonged expiratory time)
има кашлица (has a cough)

Therefore we treat documents as bag of words
they are transformed to

rather than sequences,
itemsets with single word occurrences only.

Given a set of pids S, support of an itemset I
is the number of pids in S that contain I. We de-
note it as supp(I). We deﬁne a threshold called
minsup (minimum support). Frequent itemset (FI)
I is one with at least minimum support count, i.e.
supp(I) ≥ minsup. The task of FPM of S is to
ﬁnd all possible frequent itemsets in S.

Most FPM algorithms generate all possible fre-
quent patterns (FPs). The search space grows ex-
ponentially with the size of W . Summarised infor-
mation for data relations can be extracted as max-
imal frequent itemsets (MFI). The condensed in-
formation not only accelerates the process, reduc-
ing redundancy, but also decreases signiﬁcantly
the number of frequent patterns for post-analysis.

An implication in the form I ⇒ J is called as-
sociation rule, where I ⊂ W, J ⊂ W, I ∩ J = ∅.
I is called antecedent and J is called consequent.
Support of a rule is the number of pids in S that
contain I ∪ J, i.e.

sup(I ⇒ J) = sup(I ∪ J) = P (I ∪ J).
If C% of patient documents in S that contain I,
contain also J, then the association rule I ⇒ J
holds with conﬁdence C in S, i.e. this is the con-
dition probability

conf(I ⇒ J) = P (J|I) = sup(I∪J)

sup(I)

.

The task of ARs mining in collection S is to
generate all ARs with conﬁdence above the user
deﬁned conﬁdence (minconf ) and support above
user deﬁned support (minsup). Rules that sat-
isfy both a minsup and minconf are called strong.
However, even for reasonable values of minsup
and minconf, big datasets yield huge amounts of
strong ARs. So we use an additional ﬁlter called
lift that is deﬁned as the ratio of the conﬁdence of
the rule and the conﬁdence of its consequent.

lif t(I ⇒ J) = P (I∪J)
P (I)P (J).

The lift represents the strenght of the relation
between the consequent and its antecedent. Lift
value < 1 indicates independence between them.
Lift value > 1 means that the antecedent and con-
sequent appear together more often than expected,
i.e. are correlated. Such rules are potentially use-
full for predicting the consequent in new sets.

For ARs generation we use algorithms for min-
ing all association rules with the lift measure in a
transaction database (Agrawal and Srikant, 1994)

69

with implementation at SPMF5. For experiments
is used algorithm for All Association Rule with
FPGrowth with lift
(Han et al., 2004). Let the
two sets of generated ARs for SHa and SHh corre-
spondingly be ARa and ARh.

3.2.3 Risk Factors Association Rules

Filtering

In order to identify ARs for risk factors we
use small lexicon with some keywords - K =
{k1, ..., km}. We convert back the hashed items
from the ARs into words and obtain set ARW. For
the two sets of ARs - ARa and ARh we have ARaW
and ARhW. Thus the results ARs contain words.
We ﬁlter those ARs that contain some of the key-
words from the lexicon by projection.
ARaWk = {I ⇒ J|I ⇒ J ∈ ARaW ∧ ∃k ∈

K, k ∈ I ∨ k ∈ J}

ARhWk = {I ⇒ J|I ⇒ J ∈ ARhW ∧ ∃k ∈

K, k ∈ I ∨ k ∈ J}

3.3 Preprocessing of the test sets

Let ST be the test set of ORs. All Anamnesis (Pa-
tient History) sections formed the text collection
STa, and all ORs Status texts - the collection STh.
We process STa and STh separately. Similarly to
the processing of the training set SH, we apply for
STa and STh the ﬁrst text analysis step - Itemsets
Generation - but exclude the last procedures for
hashing, compression and sorting.

3.4 Risk Factors Association Rules matching

on the test sets

We match the corresponding type ARs to the test
collections, i.e. ARs generated from the Anamne-
sis texts are mapped onto test collections that con-
tain pids for Anamnesis, and the ARs generated
from the Status parts of the ORs are mapped onto
test collections that contain pids for Status. The
result sets contain pids of patients at potential risk
of chronic disease H.
RHak = {p|p ∈ ST a, I ⇒ J ∈ ARaWk, I ⊆

p ∧ J ⊆ p}

RHhk = {p|p ∈ ST h, I ⇒ J ∈ ARhWk, I ⊆

p ∧ J ⊆ p}

viger.com/spmf/index.php?link=algorithms.php

3.5 Structured information processing for

patients at risk

Presence of some symptoms is a necessary but not
sufﬁcient condition for risk of chronic disease H.
Some additional factors need further investigation,
like related diagnosis with similar symptoms. We
also need to study the other current diagnosis of
the patient, to take into account age, gender, de-
mographic information, etc. That’s why we collect
for each patient all pids from RHak and RHhk
and the associated structured information with the
corresponding ORs from the test ST.

4 Experiments and Results

The chronic disease H that we investigate here is
COPD (ICD-10 code J44), i.e. H=J44. The aver-
age prevalence of COPD in Bulgaria is 3.197% for
2014 among all Bulgarian citizens (Fig. 3). The
average prevalence of both Schizophrenia (ICD-
10 code F20) and Diabetes Melitus Type 2 (ICD-
10 code E11) in Bulgaria is 0.688% for 2014
among all Bulgarian citizens (Fig. 4). However
for 2014 the average prevalence of COPD among
patients that suffer by both Schizophrenia and Di-
abetes Melitus Type 2 is relatively higher 5.576%
than the average for the country (Fig. 5).

Some of the typical characteristics of COPD
are: starting at middle age; symptoms develop
slowly; prolonged smoking is a main reason; pa-
tients experience dyspnoea during physical ef-
forts and signiﬁcant irreversible airﬂow limita-
tion. Thus in primary interest are ORs written
by specialists: in Otolaryngology (S14), Pulmol-
ogy (S19) and Endocrinology (S05). But we try
to identify patients at risk, and probably some of
them had no visits and consultations yet to such
specialists. So we consider also collection of ORs
for visits to general practitioners (GP) (S00).

We have 4 text collections with ORs (Table
2): GP (S00), Endocrinology(S05), Otolaryngol-
ogy (S14), and Pulmology (S19). We split these
collections into training and test sets, depending
on whether they are ORs for patients with H=J44
or not. In addition we split them into two "Anam-
nesis" and "Status" sections of the ORs. Both sec-
tions are available for each patients so the train-
ing sets SHa and SHh contain the same number of
pids. This is valid also for the test set STa and STh
for each collection.

We can observe that for SHh (Table 3) the
number of generated FPI and ARs is signiﬁcantly

higher than for SHa (Table 4) even for higher
minsup values, because the text in Status section
is more coherent and contrain less variety of syn-
tax structures. However the projection of these
ARs to the keywords set K shrinks all the ARs sets
in some cases to the ground. And it is not surprice
that the majority of the ﬁltered ARs comes from
S19a and S19h - ORs from Pulmology.

The keywords for symphtoms of J44 are:
K = {тежест, задух, кашлица, хрипове, храчки,
умора, уморяемост физическа, сърцебиене, труд-
но, експекторация, експириум} (Weight, Breathlessness,
Cough, Wheezing, Sputum, Fatigue, Tiredness, Physical, Pal-
pitations, Difﬁcult, Expectoration, Expiratory).

Some generated ARs for COPD risk factors are:
умора експекторац => кашлиц SUP: 17 LIFT: 1.60
(Fatigue Expectoration => Cough)
храчки лесна умора => кашлиц SUP: 17 LIFT: 1.60
(Sputum Easy Fatigue => Cough)
храчки експекторац => задух SUP: 20 LIFT: 2.30
(Sputum Expectoration => Breathlessness)

Patients with potential risk of COPD are identi-
ﬁed after matching the ﬁltered rules of AW aK and
AW hK to STa and STh correspondingly. The total

Table 6: COPD risk factors found in Status

In the following OR excerpt, items from the AR
antecedent are highlighted in light blue color and
the predicted consequent items are highlighted in
pink color.
Association Rule: SUP: 7 LIFT: 9.176
оплаква дишан => затрудн

STOP оплаква STOP честа дразнещ суха кашлиц
STOP белезникав храчки задух затрудн дишан
заморяван отпадналост STOP главоболи
(STOP complain STOP frequent
irritating dry cough
STOP whitish sputum dyspnoea difﬁcult breath tiredness
fainting STOP headache)

Patients that needs to be alerted for COPD risk
factors are selected after analyses of some struc-
tured information in the ORs: age, gender, demo-
graphic region, etc.

COPD develops slowly and usually patient with
age above 40s are at a higher risk . Risks are
gender speciﬁc as well due to the prevalence of
male (6.17%) vs.
female (5.25%) patients. De-
mographic information helps to identify patient
who live in regions with pollution, close to ther-
mal power stations, etc. On Fig. 5 we can see
that such regions in Bulgaria are around the town
of Sliven (15.91%), Vidin (8.70%) and Vratsa
(10.26%) in comparison with the average preva-
lence of COPD in the collection 5.576%. Another
risk factor that needs further analysis is the patient
smoking status because smoking is one of the ma-
jor causes for COPD development. Some diag-

noses related to the CORD symptoms are the fol-
lowing (with the corresponding ICD-10 codes in
the parenthesis): Asthma(J45), Status asthmaticus
(J46), Congestive heart failure (I50.0), Bronchiec-
tasis (J47), Tuberculosis (A15-A19), Bronchitis
(J40-J42), Acute bronchiolitis (J20-J22), Emphy-
sema (J43). So when planning alerts for patients
at risk, one should check whether he/she has some
of the diagnosis listed above and exclude those pa-
tient from the set RH for patients with risk alert.

5 Conclusion and Further Work

Here we show how to construct in a reliable man-
ner a "could" of words signalling risks. This is
important for a language like Bulgarian where
no electornic linguistics resources of medical ter-
minology are available. The existing very large
archive of pseudonymised ORs, a nation-wide col-
lection for 2010-2016, enables unique opportuni-
ties to acquire automatically lexical resources or-
ganised around names of diseases, medical condi-
tions and/or speciﬁc groups of patients. The care-
ful pre-selection of training corpora facilitates the
explication of association rules; in this experiment
we are aware about the comorbidity of CORD and
Schizophrenia therefore we extract ORs for a co-
hort of patients which contains more CORD cases.
the top
rules are a reliable source of information which is
easy to ﬁlter.

Despite the over-generation of ARs,

Another important achievement is the sketch of
a clear procedure for discovery of patients at risk
and issuing alerts to the healthcare authorities who
need to take care about their implementation.

Future work involves processing of more com-
plex linguistic constructions (negation) and con-
sidering typical risk factors (smoking).
