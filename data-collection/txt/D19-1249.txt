Abstract

This paper presents BiPaR, a bilingual parallel
novel-style machine reading comprehension
(MRC) dataset, developed to support multi-
lingual and cross-lingual reading comprehen-
sion. The biggest difference between BiPaR
and existing reading comprehension datasets is
that each triple (Passage, Question, Answer) in
BiPaR is written parallelly in two languages.
We collect 3,667 bilingual parallel paragraphs
from Chinese and English novels, from which
we construct 14,668 parallel question-answer
pairs via crowdsourced workers following a
strict quality control procedure. We analyze
BiPaR in depth and find that BiPaR offers
good diversification in prefixes of questions,
answer types and relationships between ques-
tions and passages. We also observe that
answering questions of novels requires read-
ing comprehension skills of coreference res-
olution, multi-sentence reasoning, and under-
standing of implicit causality, etc. With Bi-
PaR, we build monolingual, multilingual, and
cross-lingual MRC baseline models. Even for
the relatively simple monolingual MRC on this
dataset, experiments show that a strong BERT
baseline is over 30 points behind human in
terms of both EM and F1 score, indicating
that BiPaR provides a challenging testbed for
monolingual, multilingual and cross-lingual
MRC on novels. The dataset is available at
https://multinlp.github.io/BiPaR/.

1 Introduction

Machine reading comprehension is to evaluate
how well computer systems understand natural
language texts, where machines read a given text
passage and answer questions about the passage.
It has been regarded as a crucial technology for
many applications such as question answering, di-
alogue systems (Nguyen et al., 2016; Chen et al.,

multilingual and cross-lingual MRC on the dataset.

2017; Liu et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018) and
so on. In order to enable machine to understand
texts, large-scale reading comprehension datasets
have been developed, such as CNN/Daily Mail
(Hermann et al., 2015), SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al.,
2016), MS MACRO (Nguyen et al., 2016), hot-
potQA (Yang et al., 2018), CoQA (Reddy et al.,
2019), etc.

The majority of such datasets, unfortunately,
are only for monolingual text understanding. To
the best of our knowledge, there is no publicly
available bilingual parallel reading comprehension
dataset, which is exactly what BiPaR is mainly
developed for, as illustrated in Figure 1. BiPaR

produces over 14K Chinese-English parallel ques-
tions from nearly 4K bilingual parallel novel pas-
sages with consecutive word spans from these pas-
sages as answers, following SQuAD (Rajpurkar
et al., 2016). Table 1 shows that BiPaR has two
significant differences in comparison with existing
datasets: (1) each (Passage, Question, Answer)
triple is bilingual parallel, and (2) passages and
questions are from novels. BiPaR’s bilinguality
and novel-based questions provide an interesting
corner and unexplored territory for MRC.

With an in-depth analysis on the manually cre-
ated questions, we observe that answering these
novel-style questions requires challenging skills:
coreference resolution, multi-sentence reasoning,
and understanding of implicit causality, etc. Fur-
ther monolingual MRC experiments on BiPaR
demonstrate that, the English BERT large model
(Devlin et al., 2019) achieves an F1 score of
56.5%, which is 35.4 points behind human per-
formance (91.9%), and the Chinese BERT Base
model achieves an F1 score of 64.1%, which is
28.0 points behind human performance (92.1%),
indicating there is a huge gap to be bridged for
MRC on novels.

More interestingly, the bilinguality of Bi-
PaR supports multilingual and cross-lingual MRC
tasks on this dataset in addition to the traditional
monolingual MRC. It is more cost-effective to
build a single model that can handle machine read-
ing comprehension on multiple languages, than
building multiple MRC systems, one reading sys-
tem for each language. Different from previous
multilingual QA systems that are trained on in-
dependently developed datasets of different lan-
guages and domains, we are able to train a single
multilingual MRC model to do MRC on different
languages, by exploring BiPaR that is built paral-
lelly on two different languages with alignments
between triples of (Passage, Question, Answer) of
the two languages, as shown in Figure 1.

Yet another interesting task that we can do
with BiPaR is cross-lingual reading comprehen-
sion. We define two types of cross-lingual MRC
on BiPaR: (1) using questions in one language to
find answers from passages written in another lan-
guage and (2) finding answers from passages of
two different languages for questions in one lan-
guage. The former is in essence similar to the
early cross-lingual question answering (CLQA)
(Aceves-Pérez et al., 2008; Peñas et al., 2009;
Pérez et al., 2009). The intuitive approaches to
CLQA are to translate the questions into the doc-
ument’s language (Sutcliffe et al., 2005; de Pablo-
Sánchez et al., 2005; Aceves-Pérez et al., 2007),
which, however, suffers from translation errors.
The BiPaR dataset provides a potential opportu-
nity for building cross-lingual MRC that does not
rely on machine translation.

To summarize, our contributions are threefold:

• We build the BiPaR, the first publicly avail-
able bilingual parallel dataset for MRC. The
passages are novel paragraphs, originally
written in Chinese or English and then trans-
lated into the other language. The questions
are manually constructed undergoing a strict
quality control procedure.

• We conduct an in-depth analysis on Bi-
PaR, which reveals that MRC on novels is
very challenging, requiring skills of coref-
erence resolution, inter-sentential reasoning,
implicit causality understanding, etc.

• We build monolingual, multilingual and
cross-lingual MRC baseline models on Bi-
PaR and provides baseline results as well as
human performance on this dataset.

2 Related Work

MRC Datasets and Models Large-scale cloze-
style datasets, such as CNN/Daily Mail (Hermann



2454

et al., 2015), have been automatically developed
in the early days of MRC. Several neural network
models have been proposed and tested on these
datasets, such as ASReader (Kadlec et al., 2016),
StanfordAttentiveReader (Chen et al., 2016),
AoAReader (Cui et al., 2017), etc. However,
Chen et al. (2016) argue that such datasets may
be noisy due to the automatic data creation
method and co-reference errors. Rajpurkar et al.
(2016) propose SQuAD, a dataset created from
English Wikipedia, where questions are manually
generated by crowdsourced workers, and answers
are spans in the Wikipedia passages. Along with
the development of this dataset, a variety of neural
MRC models have been proposed, such as BiDAF
(Seo et al., 2016), R-NET (Wang et al., 2017),
ReasonNet (Shen et al., 2017), DCN (Xiong
et al., 2016), QANet (Yu et al., 2018), SAN
(Liu et al., 2018), etc. Recent years have wit-
nessed substantial progress made on this dataset.
However, there are some limitations on SQuAD,
which lie in that questions are created based on
single passages, that answers are limited to a
single span in passages, and that most questions
can be answered from a single supporting sen-
tence without requiring multi-sentence reasoning
(Chen, 2018). To address these limitations, a
number of datasets have be built recently, such as
MS MARCO (Nguyen et al., 2016), DuReader
(He et al., 2018), TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017),
RACE (Lai et al., 2017), NarrativeQA (Kocisky
et al., 2018), SQuAD2.0 (Rajpurkar et al., 2018),
hotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018), CoQA (Reddy
et al., 2019), etc. These datasets and models are
only for monolingual text understanding. By con-
trast, BiPaR, following these efforts of creating
challenging MRC datasets, aims at setting up a
new benchmark dataset for MRC on novels and
bilingual/cross-lingual MRC.

Multilingual MRC and Datasets Previous stud-
ies on multilingual MRC are very limited. Asai
et al. (2018) propose a multilingual MRC system
by translating the target language into a pivot
language via runtime machine translation. They
still rely on SQuAD to train the MRC model of
the pivot language. No multilingual MRC dataset
is created except that a Japanese and French test
set is created by manually translating the test set
of SQuAD into the two languages.

Multilingual/Cross-lingual QA Answering ques-
tions in multiple languages or retrieving an-
swers from passages that are written in a lan-
guage different from questions is an important
capability for QA systems. To achieve this
goal, QA@CLEF1 has organized a series of
public evaluations for multilingual/cross-lingual
QA (Magnini et al., 2006). Widely-used ap-
proaches to multilingual/cross-lingual QA are to
build monolingual QA systems and then adapt
them to multilingual/cross-lingual settings via ma-
chine translation (Lin et al., 2005). Such QA sys-
tems are prone to being affected by machine trans-
lation errors. Hence, various techniques have been
proposed to reduce the errors of the machine trans-
lation module (Sutcliffe et al., 2005; de Pablo-
Sánchez et al., 2005; Aceves-Pérez et al., 2007).

3 Dataset Creation

In this section, we elaborate on the three stages of
our dataset creation process: collecting bilingual
parallel passages, crowdsourcing question-answer
pairs on those passages, and constructing multiple
answers for the development and test set.

3.1 Bilingual Parallel Passage Collection
We select bilingual parallel passages from six Chi-
nese and English novels with different topics, in-
cluding Chinese martial arts, science fictions, fan-
tasy literature, etc. These novels are either writ-
ten in Chinese and translated into English or vice
versa. Automatic paragraph alignments between
Chinese and English are available for these nov-
els. The number of words in each Chinese pas-
sage in parallel passages is limited in the range
of [120, 600], to make the passage not too short
or too long for crowdsourced workers to construct
questions. As some of bilingual parallel passages
are very difficult to understand and create parallel
questions, we need to consider the appropriateness
of these passages. The following rules are used to
select bilingual parallel passages:

• The Chinese passage shall not contain poetry,
couplets, or classical Chinese words/phrases.

• The passage shall not contain too much dia-
logue, where speakers are difficult to recog-
nize without global context.

• The Chinese passage shall not contain full-
passage description of Kongfu fighting. Such

1http://www.clef-initiative.eu/track/qaclef



2455

descriptions on fighting are hard to translate
in a direct way into a target language (i.e.,
English in this dataset).

• In order to ensure the correct alignments of
Chinese and English passages, if an English
passage has over 10 words fewer than its Chi-
nese counterpart, such automatically aligned
bilingual passages shall not be selected as
they are normally not translations of each
other.

Following these selection rules, we finally col-
lect 3,667 bilingual parallel passages. Table 2 pro-
vides the number of selected passages from each
novel.

3.2 Question-Answer Pair Crowdsourcing

We then ask our bilingual crowdsourced workers
to create questions and answers on these collected
passages. We develop a crowdsourcing annotation
system and 150 bilingual workers, 3 bilingual re-
viewers and 1 expert participate in the data annota-
tion process. The collected bilingual parallel pas-
sages are divided into 150 groups and randomly
assigned to the bilingual workers. They will create
bilingual parallel questions and find corresponding
answers to the questions after reading the bilin-
gual parallel passages. Particularly, we encourage
workers to create questions according to the fol-
lowing rules:

• For each parallel passage, at least three bilin-
gual question-answer pairs are to be created.

• If the answers in Chinese and English are not
parallel (i.e., not translations of each other),
the corresponding questions shall be deleted
and new questions shall be created.

• Answers have to be consecutive spans in pas-
sages.

• If possible, questions of how and why are
preferred.

• It is not suggested to directly copy words
from passages for creating questions.

In order to guarantee the quality of created
question-answer pairs, we use a strict quality con-
trol procedure during data annotation. In particu-
lar, 30% annotated data from each group are ran-
domly sampled and passed to the three reviewers

who will review all answers created by the work-
ers and correct answers if they consider they are
wrong. Then, 5% of the reviewed data will be
further sampled from each reviewer. The sam-
pled data will be checked again by the expert. If
the accuracy is lower than 95%, the corresponding
workers and reviewers need to revise the answers
again. This quality control loop is executed three
times.

At last, we collect 14,668 question-answer pairs
along with their corresponding passages. We ran-
domly partition the annotated data into a train-
ing set (with 11,668 QA pairs), a development set
(1,500 QA pairs), and a test set (1,500 QA pairs).

3.3 Multiple Answers Construction

In order to make evaluation more robust, we ask
crowdsourced workers to create at least two addi-
tional answers for each question in the develop-
ment and test sets, similar to SQuAD (Rajpurkar
et al., 2016). But differently, we make the answers
from the crowdsourced workers visible to each
other, and encourage them to annotate different but
reasonable answers. The reason for creating mul-
tiple amswers is that we often encounter situations
where multiple answers are correct. Consider the
following example from SQuAD2:

P: Official corporal punishment, often by can-
ing, remains commonplace in schools in some
Asian, African and Caribbean countries. For de-
tails of individual countries see School corporal
punishment.

Q:What countries is corporal punishment still a
normal practice?

The ground truth answers of the question are
some Asian, African and Caribbean countries /

Asian, African and Caribbean countries. In fact,
the machine-predicted result is also correct. How-
ever, it will be considered as a wrong answer if the
exact match metric is used since the answer is not
in the ground truth answer list. Such cases can be
avoided if multiple reasonable answers are anno-
tated.

4 Dataset Analysis

In this section, we analyze the the types of ques-
tions and answers, the relationships of questions
with passages as well as reading skills covered in
BiPaR. Due to the bilingual parallelism of BiPaR,
we choose the English part of the dataset for anal-
yses.

4.1 Prefixes of Questions
Figure 2 shows the distribution of trigram prefixes
of questions in BiPaR. Unlike SQuAD (Rajpurkar
et al., 2018) where nearly half of questions are
dominated by what questions, the question type
distribution in BiPaR is of better dispersion over
multiple question types. In particular, BiPaR has
15.6% why and 9.5% how questions. Since in the
novel texts, causality is usually not represented
by explicit expressions such as “why”, “because”,
and “the reason for”, answering these questions
in BiPaR requires the MRC models to understand
implicit causality (Section 4.3). The why and how
questions, which account for considerable propor-
tions, undoubtedly make BiPaR a very challenging

4.2 Answers Types
We sample 100 examples from the development
set, and present the types of answers in Table 3.
As is shown, BiPaR covers a broad range of an-
swer types, which matches our analysis on ques-
tions contribution. Moreover, we find that a large
number of questions require some descriptive sen-
tences to answer (37%), which are generally com-
plete sentences or summary statements, etc (See
the third example in Table 4). These answers are
usually corresponding to what/why/how questions,
for instances:

1) What is Ding Yi doing?
2) Why is fighting so much less fun?
3) How did the protagonist treat her?

4.3 Relationships of Questions with Passages
and Reading Comprehension Skills

In order to assess how difficult to answer ques-
tions in BiPaR, we further analyze the relation-
ships between questions and corresponding pas-
sages as well as reading comprehension skills re-
quired to detect answers for BiPaR questions. We
sample 100 samples from the development set and
annotate them with various reasoning phenomena
as shown in Table 4.

Inspired by Reddy et al. (2019), we group ques-
tions into several categories in terms of their re-
lationships with passages. If a question contains
more than one content word that appears in the
passage, we label it as lexical match. These ac-
count for 49.0% of all the questions. One might
think that if a lot of words in a question overlap
with those in a passage, the answer may be eas-
ily detected from the matched sentence in the pas-
sage. However, this is not the case at all in BiPaR.
As the first example in Table 4 shows, the ques-
tion is almost the same to the sentence in passage.
However, the answer is far away from the matched

sentence. Actually, correctly answering this ques-
tion requires very complicated reading compre-
hension skills, such as multi-sentence reasoning,
ellipsis/co-reference resolution, etc. We’ve found
43 examples of this case among the 49 lexical-
match samples.

If there is no lexical match between a question
and the corresponding passage but we can find
a semantically matched sentence to the question
from the passage, we regard this case as para-
phrasing. Such questions account for 27.0% of the
questions. Interestingly, we find questions in Bi-
PaR that are not found in other datasets. We refer
to these questions as summary questions, which
account for 24% of the sampled questions. In or-
der to answer these questions, MRC models need
to read the entire passage to detect summative
statements. Examples of the summary questions
are:

1) What is the situation of the Old Majesty?
2) What features does Oboi’s bedroom show?
In addition, we also analyze the reading

comprehension skills required to answer ques-
tions. We find that coreference resolution, multi-
sentence reasoning and implicit causality under-

standing frequently appear in answering questions
in BiPaR. What deserves our special attention here
is the implicit causality, which rarely appears in
other datasets. For some questions, it is crucial to
understand causality that is not represented by ex-
plicit expressions such as “why”, “because”, and
“the reason for”. As demonstrated in the last ex-
ample in Table 4, to correctly answer the question,
we must understand the implicit causality: Quid-
ditch practice −→ Harry, however, was shaken
awake several hours earlier than he would have
liked by Oliver Wood, Captain of the Gryffindor
Quidditch team.

5 MRC Task Formulation on BiPaR

With aligned passage-question-answer triples,
we can define three MRC tasks (monolingual,
multilingual and cross-lingual) with seven dif-
ferent forms on this dataset, as demonstrated in
Figure 1. Since our goal is to provide benchmark
results on this new dataset, we either directly
train state-of-the-art MRC models on these tasks
or use a straightforward way to adapt existing
approaches to the defined tasks in this paper.
We leave new approaches, especially those for



2458

multilingual and cross-lingual MRC to our future
work.

Monolingual MRC: (Pen, Qen, Aen) or (Pzh,
Qzh, Azh). With these two monolingual MRC
forms, we can investigate the performance
variation of the same MRC model trained on
two different languages with equivalent training
instances. In our experiments, we directly train
off-the-shelf MRC models on the two mono-
lingual tasks to evaluate their performance on
Chinese and English.

Multilingual MRC: (Pen, Qen, Aen, Pzh, Qzh,
Azh). Similar to multilingual neural machine
translation (Johnson et al., 2017), we can build a
single MRC model to handle MRC of multiple
languages on BiPaR. In our benchmark test, we
directly mix training instances of the two lan-
guages into a single training set. Correspondingly,
the two vocabularies are also combined into one
vocabulary for both languages. After that, we train
MRC models on this language-mixed dataset to
endow them with the multilingual comprehension
capacity.

Cross-lingual MRC: The first two forms of cross-
lingual MRC are (Pen, Qzh, Aen) or (Pzh, Qen,
Azh), in which we use questions in one language
to extract answers from passages written in an-
other language. The other two forms are (Pen,
Pzh, Qzh, Azh, Aen) or (Pzh, Pen, Qen, Aen,
Azh), in which we use questions written in one
language to extract answers from passages writ-
ten in multiple languages. For the first two forms
of cross-lingual MRC, we use Google Translate3

to translate questions into the language of pas-
sages, and then treat them as a monolingual MRC
task. For the second two forms of cross-lingual
MRC, such as (Pzh, Pen, Qen, Aen, Azh), we first
obtain Aen through a monolingual MRC model,
then use the word alignment tool fast align4 to ob-
tain the aligned Azh from Pzh. Alternative ap-
proaches that do not rely on machine translation or
word alignments for the cross-lingual MRC tasks
are to directly build cross-lingual MRC models
on language-mixed training instances constructed
from BiPaR or to explore multi-task learning on
multiple languages (Dong et al., 2015).

6 Experiments

We carried out experiments with state-of-the-art
MRC models on BiPaR to provide machine results
for these 7 MRC tasks defined above. We also pro-
vide human performance on the monolingual tasks
and demonstrate the performance trajectory of hu-
man and machine in answering BiPaR questions.

6.1 Evaluation Metric

Like evaluations on other extraction-based
datasets, we used EM and F1 to evaluate model
accuracy on BiPaR. Particularly, we used the
evaluation program of SQuAD1.1 for the English
dataset in BiPaR, and the evaluation program5 of
CMRC2018 for the Chinese dataset in BiPaR.

6.2 Human Performance Evaluation

In order to assess human performance on BiPaR,
we hired three other bilingual crowdsourced work-
ers to independently answer questions (both Chi-
nese and English) on the test set which contains
three answers per question as described in Section
3.3. We then calculated the average results of the
three human workers as the final human perfor-
mance on this dataset, which are shown in Table
5.

6.3 Baseline models

We adapted the following state-of-the-art models
to the dataset and MRC tasks as described in Sec-
tion 4.
DrQA6: DrQA (Chen et al., 2017) is a simple but
effective neural network model for reading com-
prehension.
BERT7: BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) is a strong
method for pre-training language representations,
which obtains the state-of-the-art results on many
reading comprehension datasets. We used the
multilingual model of BERT trained on multiple
languages for the evaluation of our multilingual
MRC task.

6.4 Experimental Setup

All the baselines were tested using their default
hyper-parameters except BERT. We only changed
the batch size to 8 for BERT base and 6 for
BERT large due to the memory limit of our

(Pen, Qzh, Aen), (Pzh, Qen, Azh), (Pen, Pzh, Qzh, Azh, Aen), (Pzh, Pen, Qen, Aen, Azh). For the 6th and 7th
task, we mainly explored the word-alignment method. Hence, EM and F1 scores were evaluated on Aen or Azh.

GPUs8. We used spaCy9 to tokenize sentences and
generate part-of-speech and named entity tags that
were used to train the DrQA model. We down-
loaded Chinese models10 for spaCy to preprocess
Chinese datasets. The 300-dimensional Glove
word embeddings trained from 840B Web crawl
data (Pennington et al., 2014) were used as our
pre-trained English word embeddings while the
300-dimensional SGNS word embeddings trained
from mixed-sources data (Li et al., 2018) as our
pre-trained Chinese word embeddings.

6.5 Evaluation Results
Table 5 presents the results of the models on the
development and the test data. As BERT large is
currently not available for Chinese, results on the
tasks that need to use BERT large on Chinese are
not provided.

BERT vs. Human: In the monolingual MRC
task, the English BERT large model achieves an
F1 score of 56.5%, which is 35.4 points behind
human performance (91.9%), and the Chinese
BERT base model achieves an F1 score of 64.1%,
which is 28.0 points behind human performance
(92.1%), indicating that these tasks are difficult to
accomplish with current state-of-the-art models.
We also tested the English BERT large model on
a subset of the SQuAD data, which contains the
same number of training instances as BiPaR. The
F1 score is 86.5%, much more higher than that on

8The original batch sizes used in BERT base/BERT large
are 12/24.

anderson/Chinese models for SpaCy

BiPaR. This further suggests that BiPaR provides
a very challenging dataset for MRC.

English vs. Chinese: On the monolingual and
cross-lingual tasks, Chinese results are almost
better than the English results of the same MRC
model. This does not mean that Chinese MRC is
easier than English. One possible reason for this
may be that novels originally written in Chinese
contribute to 68.5% passages of BiPaR. In the
future, we plan to make the dataset more balanced
between the two languages.

Monolingual vs. Multilingual: For the DrQA
model, we observe that the multilingual training
significantly improves the performance on En-
glish comparing with the monolingual training
with only the English dataset. However, we do
not observe this trend on BERT. This suggests
that more should be explored on the multilingual
MRC setting. We believe that BiPaR opens a
door to new MRC approaches that are devoted to
using a single model to handle MRC on multiple
languages.

Monolingual vs. Cross-lingual: The two simple
strategies via machine translation and word align-
ments for the cross-lingual MRC perform very bad
on the four forms of cross-lingual tasks compared
to the monolingual task. For (Pen, Qzh, Aen) and
(Pzh, Qen, Azh), the major problem is the low-
quality translations of questions, especially for
questions from martial arts novels. For the other
two cross-lingual tasks, word alignment errors di-
rectly result in wrong answers found in passages

of the other language.

6.6 Analysis of BERT and Human in
Answering Different BiPaR Questions

Table 6 presents a fine-grained comparison analy-
sis of BERT base and human results on the En-
glish and Chinese monolingual task in terms of
both answer types and question categories defined
in Section 4.3. We observe that humans have abso-
lute advantages over machines in all answer types
and reasoning phenomena. However, humans ex-
hibit different capabilities on answering differ-
ent questions. They perform worse on answering
paraphrasing questions, questions with description
answers and questions requiring reading compre-
hension skills of multi-sentence reasoning than an-
swering other questions.

The performance of BERT base on questions
with description answers is much worse than other
questions, e.g., questions with person/location an-
swers. As described in Section 4.2, descriptive an-
swers are often complete sentences or summary
statements, which are very long and difficult for
machines to detect.

In terms of the relationships between questions
and passages, it is clearly observed that the BERT
MRC model achieves better performance on an-
swering lexical-match questions than answering
paraphrasing and summary questions. In BiPaR,
we have more than 50% questions that are para-
phrasing and summary questions as described in
Section 4.3. Answering them requires a deep un-
derstanding of both questions and passages.

As described in Section 4.3, BiPaR produces
questions that involve higher-order reading com-
prehension skills, such as co-reference resolution,
multi-sentence reasoning, and understanding of
implicit causality. It can be seen from Table 6
that the BERT model is worse on multi-sentence
reasoning and implicit causality than co-reference
resolution.

7 Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper, we have presented the BiPaR, a
bilingual parallel machine reading comprehension
dataset on novels. From bilingual parallel pas-
sages of Chinese and English novels, we manu-
ally created diversified parallel questions and an-
swers of different types via crowdsourced work-
ers with a multi-layer quality control system. Al-
though BiPaR is an extractive MRC dataset, in-

Table 6: Fine-grained results in terms of different an-
swer types and question categories on the monolingual
task. The left side of the slash is the F1 score on the En-
glish data, while the right is on Chinese. All F1 scores
are calculated on the 100 questions as described in Sec-
tion 4.3.

depth analyses demonstrate that the dataset is very
challenging for state-of-the-art MRC models (per-
forming far behind human) as reading compre-
hension skills of co-reference resolution, inter-
sentential reasoning are needed to answer BiPaR
questions. We further define seven types of MRC
tasks supported by BiPaR and build baseline mod-
els of monolingual, multilingual and cross-lingual
MRC on BiPaR.

BiPaR can be extended in several ways. First,
we would like to create more parallel triples by
adding more novels to make instances more bal-
anced between the two languages. Second, we
want to create questions with non-extractive an-
swers. Third, we are also interested in adding
multi-passage questions or questions based on the
entire novels to BiPaR.
