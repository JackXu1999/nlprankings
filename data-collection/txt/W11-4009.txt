Bringing Multilingual Information Extraction to the User
(invited talk)

Abstract

The speaker will give an overview of how various text mining tools (information extraction, aggrega-
tion of multilingual information, document classification, trend analysis, and more) are combined in
the Europe Media Monitor (EMM) family of applications to help users in their daily work. EMM was
developed by the European Commissionâ€™s Joint Research Centre (JRC), whose users include EU In-
stitutions, national EU member state organisations, international organisations such as United Nations
sub-organisations, and selected international partners (e.g. in the USA, in Canada and in China). The
presentation will thus have an overview character rather than going into much technical detail. EMM
applications are publicly accessible at http://emm.newsbrief.eu/overview.html. For sci-
entific details and publications, see http://langtech.jrc.ec.europa.eu/.
