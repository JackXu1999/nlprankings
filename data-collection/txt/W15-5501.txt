Cross-lingual Event Detection in Discourse

Abstract

We describe a system for event extraction
across documents and languages. We de-
veloped a framework for the interopera-
ble semantic interpretation of mentions of
events, participants, locations and time, as
well as the relations between them.

Furthermore, we use a common RDF
model to represent instances of events and
normalised entities and dates. We con-
vert multiple mentions of the same event in
English and Spanish to a single represen-
tation. We thus resolve cross-document
event and entity coreference within a lan-
guage but also across languages. We tested
our system on a Wikinews corpus of 120
English articles that have been manually
translated to Spanish.

We report on the cross-lingual cross-
document event and entity extraction com-
paring the Spanish output with respect to
English.

ence by the Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya
(UPC). Formerly member of the Computer Sci-
ence department at the UPC and member of the

teaching at the Computer Science Faculty of the
EHU as an Associate Professor. He has published
more than hundred-refereed articles and confer-
ence papers in the area of Natural Language Pro-
cessing, and in particular Acquisition of Lexical
Knowledge, Word Sense Disambiguation, Seman-
tic Processing and Inferencing.

He has been involved in several European re-
search projects (ESPRIT BRA ACQUILEX, AC-
QUILEX II, LE EUROWORDNET, LE NAMIC,

MEANING, KYOTO, PATHS, OpeNER and
NewsReader). He coordinated the 5th Framework
MEANING project (IST-2001-34460) and the lo-
cal groups for NAMIC, KYOTO and OpeNER.
Currently, he is coordinating the local group for
NewsReader (FP7-ICT-2011-8-316404).

He has been also involved in several Span-
ish National research projects (ITEM, HERMES,
SENSEM, KNOW, KNOW2 and SKaTer). Cur-
rently, he is coordinating the local group of
the SKaTer project. He served as PC member
and reviewer of the main international confer-
ences and workshops in NLP and AI including
ACL, EACL, NAACL, COLING, AAAI, ECAI,
IJCAI, EMNLP, IJCNLP, CoNLL, TSD, SENSE-
VAL/SEMEVAL and IWC.

He also served as reviewer of International Jour-
nals including: Computers and the Humanities,
Journal of Natural Language Engineering, Jour-
nal of Artificial Intelligence Research and Artifi-
cial Intelligence. He has also participated in all
editions of the international competition of SEN-
