Abstract 

In this paper, for the purpose of enhancing 
Universal Dependencies for the Korean 
language, we propose a modified method 
for mapping Korean Part-of-Speech(POS) 
tagset in relation to Universal Part-of-
Speech (UPOS) tagset in order to enhance 
the Universal Dependencies for the Korean 
Language. Previous studies suggest that 
UPOS reflects several issues that influence 
dependency annotation by using the POS 
of Korean predicates, particularly the 
distinctiveness in using verb, adjective, and 
copula. 

1 Introduction 

The Universal Dependencies (UD) approach aims 
to find morphological and syntactic characteristics 
that can be applied to several languages for cross-
lingual language processing. This approach  
converts the language resources of each language 
has into one unified format (CoNLL U-Format) in 
order to simplify general language processing. 

The number of language resources varies among 
all languages. Designed with a focus on the 
characteristics of resource-rich languages, the  
CoNLL U-Format does not completely reflect the 
distinctiveness of Korean annotation. The CoNLL 
U-Format sets up minimum processing unit based 
on eojeol (white space), However, in Korean, the 
basic unit for language processing is not only 
eojeol but the also morphemes with eojeol. 
Therefore, an analysis of the Korean language with 
white space as the minimum unit may lead to the 
omission of some important information, or yield 
inaccurate results. 

In Korean, the unit divided by white space is 
called eojeol, this is composed of a noun or verb 
stem combined with a postposition (josa) or ending

(eomi) that function as inflectional and 
derivational particles. Significantly, based on the 
type of ending with which the stem of the predicate 
is combined to form an eojeol, the eojeol takes on 
different functions. Therefore, this paper suggests 
that Universal Part-of-speech (UPOS) be analyzed 
by taking this characteristic into consideration. 

The CoNLL U-Format assigns a UPOS to each 
eojeol, and marks it with a language-specific part-
of-speech tag (XPOS) beside it. This paper 
suggests a methodology that is able to clarify the 
UPOS and Dependency annotation by using  
XPOS after processing the Korean language. 

For the purpose of enhancing Korean UD, the 
focus should be on the processing of predicates. In 
the Korean, most predicates consist of the 
combination of a stem and an ending, which is 
similar to Japanese predicate construction but 
differs from that of English and European 
languages. However, unlike Japanese text which 
can be segmented into stem and ending separately 
to give UPOS, as there is no white space in the 
language itself, Korean text includes a white space 
unit which has a construction that is different from 
English, and thus, we should consider this specific 
property. 

This paper suggests a scheme for the mapping 
of part-of-speech that forms Korean predicates on 
UPOS, as well as suggests a method of annotating 
the dependency relations in case of verb sequences. 
In section 2, we examine the attempts to convert 
and build Korean language resources into UD. 
Furthermore, based on an analysis of the contents 
of previous Part-of-Speech (POS) annotations and 
dependency annotations, we search for the 
necessary areas of improvement for Korean 
annotation. In section 3, we suggest a UPOS for 
several issues that can have influences the 
dependency annotation by using XPOS of Korean 
predicates. In section 4, we will suggest a Korean

dependency annotation modified through the 
suggested UPOS. 

2 Previous works 

Since the late 1990s, there have been attempts to 
build a syntactic parsing corpus of the Korean 
language based on the dependency structure. 
Korean National Corpus in the 21st Century 
Sejong Project (KNC), which has been established 
and is the most well-known syntactic parsing 
corpus, is based on the binary phrase structure and 
can easily to be converted to have a dependency 
structure. In fact, the dependency structure analysis 
corpus has been used widely in Korean language 
processing, and with a recent attempt  to unify its 
form with UD. The efforts to apply current tag 
system of UD to the Korean language began with 
the Google Universal Dependency Treebank (UDT) 
Project (McDonald et al., 2013), which attempted 
to combine the Stanford Tag System and the 
Google System. 

This paper discusses a total of three corpora: the 
Google Korean Universal Dependency Treebank 
(GKT), the Parallel Universal Korean Dependency 
Treebank (PUD), and the KAIST Korean 
Universal Dependency Treebank (KTB). All of the 
three corpora were tagged in CoNLL U-Format. 
The Google Korean Universal Dependency 
Treebank was first converted from the Universal 
Dependency Treebank v2.0 (legacy), and then 
enhanced by Chun et al. (2018). The KAIST 
Korean Universal Dependency Treebank was 
generated by Chun et al. (2018) from the 
constituency-based trees in the KAIST Tree-
Tagging Corpus. The Parallel Universal 
Dependencies (PUD) treebanks are created from 
Raw Text to Universal Dependencies for the 
CoNLL 2017 shared task on Multilingual Parsing. 

As stated in the Introduction, it is necessary to 
focus on predicate processing for enhanced Korean 
UD. Therefore, in section 2, this paper, examines 
GKT, PUD, and KTB centered on predicates; In 
2.1, we will compare and analyze POS annotation 
methods of eojeols containing predicates in three 
corpora; and in 2.2, we will examine the 
Dependency annotation methods of these three 
corpora for eojeols containing predicates. 

2.1 Part-of-speech annotation  
For the POS annotation of eojeols containing 
predicates, all GKT, PUD, and KTB currently 

published on the UD Website follow the types of 
predicates contained in the eojeols without 
considering the function of the eojeols. It 
designates itself as VERB if the predicate in the 
eojeol is a verb and designates itself as ADJ if the 
predicate in the eojeol is an adjective, similar to the 
process of lemmatization. 
 
(1) GKT Example - UPOS annotation as VERB for 
verb (VV) contained eojeol 

# text = 조화가 잘 되어 아담한 감을 준다. 
 

 조화+가 잘 되+어 아담하+ㄴ 감+을 주+ㄴ다 . 
 jo-hwa-ga jal doe-eo a-dam-han gam-eul jun-da  

 “Harmony + tpc” “well” “become” “neat” 
“Impression 

+ obj” make  

UPOS NOUN ADV VERB ADJ NOUN VERB PUNCT 
XPOS   VV+EC          VV+EF  
 

For copula, GKT and KTB adopt a similar 
methods of POS annotation while PUD takes 
different one. GKT and KTB label all eojeols that 
contain copula as VERB; however, PUD segments 
the copula from eojeols and assigns an AUX.  
 
(2) GKT Example - UPOS annotation as VERB for 
copula (VCP) contained eojeol 
 

# text =  바로 이곳입니다. 
 바로 이곳+이+ㅂ니다 . 
 ba-lo i-gos-ib-ni-da  
 “exactly” “here”  

UPOS ADV VERB PUNCT 
XPOS  NP+VCP+EF  

 

 

# text =  설립 이사장인 청암 박태준 
 설립 이사장+이+ㄴ 청암 박태준 

 seol-lib i-sa-jang-in cheong-am park- tae-jun 

 “Establishing” “chairman” “Cheongahm” “Park Tae jun” 
UPOS NOUN VERB NOUN NOUN 
XPOS NNG+VCP+ETM  

 

 
(3) PUD Example - UPOS annotation as AUX for 
copula(VCP) contained eojeol 

 
# text = 비협조적인 사람이며 

 비협조적 이+ㄴ 사람 이+며 
 bi-hyeob-jo-jeog in sa-lam i-myeo 
 “Uncooperative” “is” “person” “is” 

UPOS NOUN AUX NOUN AUX 
XPOS  VCP+ETM  VCP+EC 

 

 

In addition, GKT and PUD tag both the main 
predicate as well as the auxiliary predicate as 
VERB. On the other hand, KTB gives an AUX tag 



110

to auxiliary predicates to differentiate between 
main predicates and auxiliary predicates. 
 

(4) GKT Example - UPOS annotation as VERB for 
eojeol containing auxiliary verb(VX)  
 

# text =  사용이 두드러지고 있다. 
 사용+이 두드러지+고 있+다 . 
 sa-yong-i du-deu-leo-ji-go iss-da  
 “Use+tpc” “prominent” “is”  

UPOS NOUN VERB VERB PUNCT 
XPOS  VV+EC VX+EF  

 

 
(5) KTB Example - UPOS annotation as AUX for 
eojeol containing auxiliary verb(VX)  
 

# text =  현판이 달려 있었습니다. 
 현판+이 달리+어 있+었+습니다 . 
 hyeon-pan-i dal-lyeo iss-eoss-seub-ni-da  
 “Signboard+tpc” “hang” “being”  

UPOS NOUN VERB AUX PUNCT 
XPOS  VV+EC VX+EF  

 

 

2.2 Dependency annotation 
Of the 37 universal syntactic relations labels that 
represent Universal Dependency Relations, GKT, 
PUD, and KTB show the biggest difference in the 
aux (Auxiliary) and labels related to MEW (multi-
word-expression), compound (Compound), 
fixed (Fixed Multiword Expression), and flat 
(Flat Multiword Expression). GKT demonstrates 
quite a low frequency of aux, which is because 
auxiliary predicates are not classified separately in 
the POS annotation process but are processed with 
VERB. Since an auxiliary predicate is not used 
alone but appears next to the main predicate, AUX 
which is a POS tag, and aux, which is a label and 
syntactic tag, should be proportional to each other. 
As such, it is natural for aux to show high 
frequency, as is the case with KTB. Instead, a 
flat label appears in GKT with high frequency 
whereas it appears with low frequency in other 
corpus as the relationship between the auxiliary 
predicate and the main predicate is processed as 
flat. 

In this way, the Korean language has a predicate 
formed with continual eojeols in several cases; 
therefore it becomes critical to establish 
dependency relations between eojeols that form a 
predicate in the Korean language.

(7) KTB Example –  tags VX as(with) aux 
 

3 Part-of-speech annotation 

The target of this paper is limited only to the POS 
that can be used as a predicate in a sentence. In the 
Korean language, the POS applicable to the 
predicates are verb, adjective, copula, and auxiliary. 
The predicates of the Korean language can be 
composed of either a single eojeol or multiple ones. 
In the former case, one eojeol composed of a stem 
and ending with a verb or adjective functions as a 
predicate; alternatively, noun and copula combined 
with ending form an eojeol. In the latter case, stems 
of the main verb and auxiliary verbs are combined 
with an ending forming two or more eojeols in 
sequence, or many types of main verb stems are 
combined with an ending forming two or more 
eojeols in a sequence. 

In this manner, the Korean language is very 
diverse in terms of predicate configurations; as the 
morphological and syntactic functions of 
predicate-related POS contained in these 
configurations are different, the POS annotation 
method in the prior process of parsing becomes an 
important issue that influences clear dependency 
annotation thereafter. 



111

3.1 Verb 
A Korean verb stem cannot be used alone in a 
sentence; it must be combined with an ending to 
form an eojeol. The types of ending are broadly 
categorized into final endings, connective endings, 
and conversion endings, and the function of an 
eojeol in a sentence is dependent on the ending 
with which the stem is combined. When combined 
with a final or connective ending, it has the 
function of a predicate, whereas it has the function 
of a modifier or substantive on being combined 
with a conversion ending. 

As described in section 2, in GKT, KTB, and 
PUD, eojeols that contain Korean verbs are mostly 
tagged as VERB regardless of the type of ending 
that is combined with the verb stem. This simple 
labeling method does not consider the actual 
function of an eojeol in which the verb is contained. 
When this approach is used, the POS annotation is 
very likely to become redundant, which does not 
improve the accuracy of the dependency 
annotation. 

This paper suggests that POS annotation should 
be performed according to the function of each 
eojeol within a sentence. In an eojeol where the 
verb stem functions as a predicate by being 
combined with a final or connective ending, the 
POS tag of VERB can be given. On the other hand, 
in an eojeol where the verb stem functions as 
modifying the following noun by being combined 
with an adnominal ending, the POS tag of ADJ can 
be given. When a verb stem is combined with a 
nominal ending, the function of the eojeol can be 
changed according to the type of combined 
inflectional particle.  

Therefore, the POS tag of the eojeol follows the 
type of the combined inflectional particle. For 
helpful information in deciding the POS 
annotation of each eojeol, we can refer to the KNC 
POS tagset, which analyzes eojeol in morpheme 
units. Specifically, if the morpheme unit annotation 
of an eojeol is “VV (verb) + EF (final ending)” or 
“VV + EC (connective ending)”, the UPOS of 
VERB is allotted; if the morpheme unit annotation 
is “VV + ETM (adnominal ending)”, the tag ADJ 
is allotted.  

However, among other connective endings 
combined with verb stem, “-게 (-ge)” provides an 
adverbial function to the eojeol, and it can often be 
tagged as ADV rather than VERB. It is the same in 
the case of the adjective and copula below. An 
eojeol made with a verb stem combined with a 

nominal ending and inflectional particle can be 
tagged with NOUN if it is “VV + ETN (nominal 
ending) + {JKS (subjective case particle), JKC 
(compliment case particle), JKO (objective case 
particle), JC (conjunctive particle)},” with ADJ if 
“VV + ETN + JKG (adjective case particle)”, and 
with ADV if “VV + ETN + JKB (adverbial case 
particle)”. The POS assignment method described 
above is applied only when the eojeol is not a part 
of a paragraph that presupposes a subject-predicate 
relation.  

By following this method, more accurate UPOS 
annotation can be obtained by using morphological 
annotation information of the existing KNC. The 
UPOS established in this way would also be 
helpful in determining the dependencies relations.

yeog ga-neun gil 

 “Bicycle” “ride” “Daejeon Station” “go” “way” 

UPOS NOUN VERB NOUN ADJ NOUN 
XPOS  VV+EC  VV+ETM  

 

3.2 Adjective 
Unlike English adjectives, Korean adjectives 

are sometimes classified as stative verbs, because 
a Korean adjective can function as predicate 
without a support verb. Therefore, it is hard to 
apply ADJ of UPOS to intact Korean adjectives. 
An English adjective does not change its form 
depending on whether it takes the role of predicate 
or modifier, and it can even form an eojeol on its 
own. Hence, it does not result in problem if it is 
tagged as ADJ. However, a Korean adjective stem, 
just like a verb, can complete an eojeol and be used 
in a sentence only when it is combined with an 
ending, and its function within the sentence can be 
changed based on the type of ending it is combined 
with. 

In GKT, PUD, and KTB, eojeols that contain 
Korean adjectives are mostly tagged as ADJ 
regardless of the type of ending that is combined 
with the adjective stem in the sentence, or the 
function of the eojeol, in which the adjective is 
contained. Sometimes, an eojeol that functions as 
a predicate rather than a modifier is tagged as ADJ; 
and if this eojeol containing an adjective which 
functions as a predicate by being combined with a 



112

final ending or connective ending, is tagged as 
POS of ADJ, the sentence becomes a non-sentence, 
as it does not have a predicate. 

Focusing on this characteristic of Korean 
adjectives, this paper suggests performing POS 
annotation for an eojeol that contains an adjective 
based on the function of the eojeol within the 
sentence. The approach is to annotate an eojeol in 
which an adjective stem functions as a predicate 
within a sentence when combined with a final or 
connective ending as VERB, and to annotate an 
eojeol in which an adjective stem functions as a 
modifier within sentence by being combined with 
adnominal ending as ADJ.  

As stated above, Korean adjectives are analogous 
with stative verbs;  hence, if one is combined with a 
final or connective ending, it functions as a predicate 
within a sentence. Therefore, a UPOS annotation as 
VERB is not irrational in the least, and it is suitable 
to give an ADJ tag to an eojeol that modifies a 
following eojeol by being combined with an 
adnominal ending. In addition, if an adjective stem 
is combined with a nominal ending, in the manner 
described in section 3.1, its function is changes 
according to the type of postposition with which it is 
combined; therefore, the POS of the eojeol can be 
determined according to the type of postposition.

 “Most” “close” “Starbucks +tpc” “where” “be” 

UPOS NOUN ADJ NOUN NOUN VERB 
XPOS  VA+ETM   VA+EF 

 

 
An eojeol containing an adjective can also be 

annotated by referring to the KNC POS tagset that 
performs analysis in morpheme units. This 
information will be helpful in clarifying the 
dependency relations of a sentence by being used in 
dependency annotation. 

3.3 Copula 
The Korean copula “-이-(-i-)” is a unique POS that 
gives a predicate function to a noun. It appears with 
a noun and is similar to the English verb “be,” as it 
has the function of a predicate. But unlike the verb 
“be” which functions as a predicate alone by 
forming an eojeol without a noun, it can form an 
eojeol only by forming a “noun+copula+ending” 

structure. In addition, Korean copula, just like verb 
stem or adjective stem, can function as a predicate 
by combining it with a final or connective ending, 
or as a modifier or substantive by combining with 
a conversion ending. 

In GKT and KTB, eojeols that contain copula 
are mostly tagged as VERB regardless of the type 
of ending that is combined with copula, similar to 
the eojeols that contain a Korean verb; in PUD, a 
copula is segmented from the eojeol and tagged as 
AUX. The former does not consider the actual 
function of the eojeol containing the copula, and 
the latter takes a method out of UD’s POS 
annotation guideline, which considers the eojeol as 
a basic unit. 

This paper suggests differentiating the POS 
annotation of eojeols that contain copula according 
to the function of the eojeol in a sentence, just like 
the Korean verb or adjective stated above. To be 
specific, if an ending that completes an eojeol 
located next to a “noun+copula” structure is a final 
or connective ending when the eojeol functions as 
a predicate within the sentence, it is tagged as 
VERB; if the adnominal ending functions as a 
modifier, it is tagged as ADJ; and if combined with 
a nominal ending, POS annotation is done 
according to the type of inflectional particle. Here, 
we can also refer to the KNC POS tagset that 
annotates Korean language in morpheme units. 
Unlike Korean verbs or adjectives, the KNC POS 
tagset analysis on the eojeol containing copula that 
forms an eojeol by combining it  with a noun would 
be like “NN* (noun) + VCP (copula) + E* 
(ending).”

XPOS NNG+VCP+ETM  

 

3.4 Auxiliary 
The Korean auxiliary verb is different from the 
English auxiliary verb in several respects. Firstly,  
most English auxiliary verbs take forms that are 
different from main verbs; however in several 
cases, Korean auxiliary verbs are homonyms that 
take the same forms as the main verbs. 
Additionally, unlike English, which has 



113

completely different figures of “main 
verb||auxiliary verb” combinations and “main 
verb||main verb” combinations, in the Korean 
language the “main verb||auxiliary verb” 
combinations and “main verb||main verb” 
combinations, these combinations have the same 
syntactic structure in the Korean Language. Finally, 
in principle the Korean auxiliary verb is written 
with a space separating it from the main verb in 
order to form a separate eojeol, but sometimes it 
forms one eojeol with main verb in order to take 
the function of one predicate.

 “Use+tpc” “prominent” “is”  

XPOS  VV+EC VX+EF  
 

 
In GKT and PUD, eojeols that contain the main 

verb and auxiliary verb are not divided; however, 
both of them are tagged as VERB. In this case, 
“main verb||main verb” combinations and “main 
verb||auxiliary verb” combinations are not 
distinguished, and in the case of the “main 
verb||auxiliary verb” combinations, it is hard to 
understand which one of two eojeols takes the role 
of the main predicate and which one takes the 
auxiliary function. In addition, “main verb||main 
verb” combinations and “main verb||auxiliary verb” 
combinations form different dependency relations. 
If POS annotation is unable to give this 
information properly, the whole sentence has to be 
analyzed again in the dependency annotation 
process. 

This paper suggests applying different tags to 
the “main verb||main verb” combinations as wel as 
the  “main verb||auxiliary verb” combinations by 
strictly classifying both of them. Sometimes the 
form of a Korean auxiliary verb is difficult to be 
distinguished from the main verb, but it is a closed 
set and small in number. In the KNC POS tagset 
that analyzes the Korean language in morpheme 
units, the main verb stem is tagged as VV or VA 
while the auxiliary verb is tagged as VX; Using this 

information, we can clearly and simply classify 
main verbs and auxiliary verbs in UD POS 
annotation. Therefore, the main verb can be tagged 
by VERB and the auxiliary verb by AUX, and 
when a main verb and an auxiliary verb form an 
eojeol, it can be tagged as VERB without 
segmenting the eojeol.

Because the UPOS is based on information of 
XPOS inside CoNLL U-Format, it can be 
automatically converted. The eojeol contaning VV 
showed the highest conversion rates to ADJ and 
ADV. And for eojeols contaning VA, the 
conversion rates to VERB and ADV was highest. 
In the case of eojeols contaning VCP, the 
conversion rates to VERB and ADJ was highest. 
Most eojeols starting with VX were converted to 
AUX. 

4 Dependency annotation  

4.1 Head final  
Unlike English, Korean language is a head-final 
language in which complement comes first 
followed by a head of verb phrase. This head is 
marked as root in the tag system of Universal 
Dependency Relations. This root is the core of 
dependency annotation as other sentence 
components are subordinated to this label. There 
are two kinds of Korean sentences; simple 
sentences and compound-complex. Compound-
complex sentences can be divided into compound 
sentences that contain two consecutive simple 
sentences, and complex sentences that contain 
clauses with various kinds of sentence functions. It 
is easy to set up the root for a simple sentence, as 
there is only one predicate in the sentence.  

However, it is difficult to determine the head of 
the sentence in compound-complex sentences. In 
the case of complex sentences, the last predicate is 
likely to be the head, but in the case of compound 
sentences, it is hard to assign a head as the ranks of 
two predicates within the sentence are equal. 
Accordingly, we would like to apply the head-final 
principle to compound sentences based on the 
cases of simple sentence and complex sentences.  

In the Japanese language, there is a tendency of 
setting up the right-most predicate stem in a 
sentence as the root while examining GSD, PUD, 
Modern, BCCWJ, and KTC corpora revealed by 
UD. In Korean, based on this criterion, it is 
necessary to set up the right-most eojeol containing 
a predicate as the root. This can be used to 
minimize confusion in the Korean language, which 
has a complex sentence structure.  

Korean predicates play various role by being 
combined with endings; therefore, it is essential to 
first check whether the eojeol actually plays the 
role of predicate, upon setting up a predicate 
located in places other than the sentence final as 

the root. The error rate can increase if this process 
is omitted. The error rate can increase if this 
process is omitted. Therefore, following the 
principle of head final will reduce analysis errors 
and increase the efficiency of the processing.

4.2 Verb sequence separated by white space 
If two or more consecutive eojeols take on the 
same role of predicate within a sentence, the 
relationship between these eojeols should be 
revealed. Predicate eojeols are combined in the 
following cases: combination of main predicate 
with auxiliary predicate; and combination of two 
main predicate and main predicate.  

In the first case, root is assigned to the main 
predicate and aux is assigned to the auxiliary 
predicate. In the existing dependency syntactic 
parsing or structure analysis, if the head final is

provided, head position is allotted to the auxiliary 
predicate; however, following the UD system, aux 
position is given to the auxiliary predicate and the 
head position is not. This shows that the auxiliary 
predicate does not describe actual contents of a 
sentence, but takes on an auxiliary function. 
Through this processing, we can resolve the 
controversy over whether to accept the Korean 
language should be accepted as a head final 
language.  

In the case of a combination of two main 
predicates, the relationship is determined by the 
ending of the preceding main predicate. The 
following main predicate is labeled as root. 
However, if the preceding main predicate is 
combined with a connective ending, it can be 
assigned as flat; if the preceding main predicate 
is combined with an adverbial ending, it can be 
designated as advcl or advmod, depending on 
the combination relationship of the preceding 
Eojeol. Based on the KNC tagset, the connective 
ending is tagged by EC, and if the morpheme is “-
게,” it can be considered as an adverbial ending. In 
the case of an adnominal ending, there is an extra 
label of ETM in the KNC tagset.

5 Conclusion and Future works 

This paper aimed to suggest a plan for improving 
UD Tagging by focusing on the predicate. A 
Korean eojeol consists of nouns and verbs 
combined with propositions and endings that 
function as inflectional and derivational particles. 
The function of the stem of predicate depends on 
which ending is combined with the eojeol. 
Therefore, we proposed modified UPOS tagging 
and dependency annotation to reflect the syntactic 
characteristics of the Korean language using 
language-specific XPOS.  

This paper developed the discussion by focusing 
only on predicates-related contents. eojeols with 
other functions that were not considered in this 
paper will be examined in future studies.
