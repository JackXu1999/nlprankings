Abstract

Neural sequence to sequence learning re-
cently became a very promising paradigm
in machine translation, achieving compet-
itive results with statistical phrase-based
systems. In this system description pa-
per, we attempt to utilize several recently
published methods used for neural se-
quential learning in order to build sys-
tems for WMT 2016 shared tasks of Au-
tomatic Post-Editing and Multimodal Ma-
chine Translation.

1 Introduction

Neural sequence to sequence models are currently
used for variety of tasks in Natural Language Pro-
cessing including machine translation (Sutskever
et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2014), text sum-
marization (Rush et al., 2015), natural language
generation (Wen et al., 2015), and others. This
was enabled by the capability of recurrent neu-
ral networks to model temporal structure in data,
including the long-distance dependencies in case
of gated networks (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber,
1997; Cho et al., 2014).

The deep learning models’ ability to learn a
dense representation of the input in the form of
a real-valued vector recently allowed researchers
to combine machine vision and natural language
processing into tasks believed to be extremely dif-
ficult only few years ago. The distributed rep-
resentations of words, sentences and images can
be understood as a kind of common data type for
language and images within the models. This is
then used in tasks like automatic image captioning
(Vinyals et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2015), visual ques-
tion answering (Antol et al., 2015) or in attempts
to ground lexical semantics in vision (Kiela and
Clark, 2015).

In this system description paper, we bring
a summary of the Recurrent Neural Network
(RNN)-based system we have submitted to the au-
tomatic post-editing task and to the multimodal
translation task. Section 2 describes the archi-
tecture of the networks we have used. Section 3
summarizes related work on the task of automatic
post-editing of machine translation output and de-
scribes our submission to the Workshop of Ma-
chine Translation (WMT) competition. In a sim-
ilar fashion, Section 4 refers to the task of multi-
modal translation. Conclusions and ideas for fur-
ther work are given in Section 5.

2 Model Description

We use the neural translation model with attention
(Bahdanau et al., 2014) and extend it to include
multiple encoders, see Figure 1 for an illustration.
Each input sentence enters the system simultane-
ously in several representations xi. An encoder
used for the i-th representation Xi = (x1i , . . . , x

k
i )

of k words, each stored as a one-hot vector xji , is
a bidirectional RNN implementing a function

f(Xi) = Hi = (h
1
i , . . . , h

k
i ) (1)

where the states hji are concatenations of the out-
puts of the forward and backward networks after
processing the j-th token in the respective order.

The initial state of the decoder is computed as a
weighted combination of the encoders’ final states.

The decoder is an RNN which receives an em-
bedding of the previously produced word as an
input in every time step together with the hidden
state from the previous time step. The RNN’s out-
put is then used to compute the attention and the
next word distribution.

The attention is computed over each encoder
separately as described by Bahdanau et al. (2014).
The attention vector ami of the i-th encoder in the

where the weights αmi is a distribution estimated
as

αmi = softmax
(
vT · tanh(sm +WHiHi)

)
(3)

with sm being the hidden state of the decoder in
time m. Vector v and matrix WHi are learned pa-
rameters for projecting the encoder states.

The probability of the decoder emitting
the word ym in the j-th step, denoted as
P (ym|H1, . . . ,Hn,Y0..m−1), is proportional to

)

where Hi are hidden states from the i-th encoder
and Y0..m−1 is the already decoded target sen-
tence (represented as matrix, one-hot vector for
each produced word). Matrices Wo and Wai are
learned parameters; Wo determines the recurrent
dependence on the decoder’s state and Wai deter-
mine the dependence on the (attention-weighted)
encoders’ states.

For image captioning, we do not use the at-
tention model because of its high computational
demands and rely on the basic model by Vinyals

et al. (2015) instead. We use Gated Recurrent
Units (Cho et al., 2014) and apply the dropout of
0.5 on the inputs and the outputs of the recurrent
layers (Zaremba et al., 2014) and L2 regulariza-
tion of 10−8 on all parameters. The decoding is
done using a beam search of width 10. Both the
decoders and encoders have hidden states of 500
neurons, word embeddings have the dimension of
300. The model is optimized using the Adam op-
timizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with learning rate
of 10−3.

We experimented with recently published im-
provements of neural sequence to sequence learn-
ing: scheduled sampling (Bengio et al., 2015),
noisy activation function (Gülçehre et al., 2016),
linguistic coverage model (Tu et al., 2016). None
of them were able to improve the systems’ perfor-
mance, so we do not include them in our submis-
sions.

Since the target language for both the task was
German, we also did language dependent pre- and
post-processing of the text. For the training we
split the contracted prepositions and articles (am
↔ an dem, zur↔ zu der, . . . ) and separated some
pronouns from their case ending (keinem ↔ kein
-em, unserer↔ unser -er, . . . ). We also tried split-
ting compound nouns into smaller units, but on the
relatively small data sets we have worked with, it
did not bring any improvement.

3 Automatic Post-Editing

The task of automatic post-editing (APE) aims at
improving the quality of a machine translation sys-
tem treated as black box. The input of an APE
system is a pair of sentences – the original input
sentence in the source language and the translation
generated by the machine translation (MT) sys-
tem. This scheme allows to use any MT system
without any prior knowledge of the system itself.
The goal of this task is to perform automatic cor-
rections on the translated sentences and generate a
better translation (using the source sentence as an
additional source of information).

For the APE task, the organizers provided to-
kenized data from the IT domain (Turchi et al.,
2016). The training data consist of 12,000 triplets
of the source sentence, its automatic translation
and a reference sentence. The reference sentences
are manually post-edited automatic translations.
Additional 1,000 sentences were provided for val-
idation, and another 2,000 sentences for final eval-
uation. Throughout the paper, we report scores
on the validation set; reference sentences for final
evaluation were not released for obvious reasons.

The performance of the systems is measured us-
ing Translation Error Rate (Snover et al., 2006)
from the manually post-edited sentences. We thus
call the score HTER. This means that the goal of
the task is more to simulate manual post-editing,
rather than to reconstruct the original unknown
reference sentence.

3.1 Related Work

In the previous year’s competition (Bojar et al.,
2015), most of the systems were based on the
phrase-base statistical machine translation (SMT)
in a monolingual setting (Simard et al., 2007).

There were also several rule-based post-editing
systems benefiting from the fact that errors intro-
duced by statistical and rule-based systems are of
a different type (Rosa, 2014; Mohaghegh et al.,
2013).

Although the use of neural sequential model is
very straightforward in this case, to the best of our
knowledge, there have not been experiments with
RNNs for this task.

3.2 Experiments & Results

The input sentence is fed to our system in a form of
multiple input sequences without explicitly telling
which sentence is the source one and which one

is the MT output. It is up to the network to dis-
cover their best use when producing the (single)
target sequence. The initial experiments showed
that the network struggles to learn that one of
the source sequences is almost correct (even if it
shares the vocabulary and word embeddings with
the expected target sequence). Instead, the net-
work seemed to learn to paraphrase the input.

To make the network focus more on editing
of the source sentence instead of preserving the
meaning of the sentences, we represented the tar-
get sentence as a minimum-length sequence of edit
operations needed to turn the machine-translated
sentence into the reference post-edit. We extended
the vocabulary by two special tokens keep and
delete and then encoded the reference as a se-
quence of keep, delete and insert operations with
the insert operation defined by the placing the
word itself. See Figure 2 for an example.

After applying the generated edit operations on
the machine-translated sentences in the test phase,
we perform a few rule-based orthographic fixes
for punctuation. The performance of the system is
given in Table 1. The system was able to slightly
improve upon the baseline (keeping the translation
as it is) in both the HTER and BLEU score. The
system was able to deal very well with the fre-
quent error of keeping a word from the source in
the translated sentence. Although neural sequen-
tial models usually learn the basic output structure
very quickly, in this case it made a lot of errors in
pairing parentheses correctly. We ascribe this to
the edit-operation notation which obfuscated the
basic orthographic patterns in the target sentences.

4 Multimodal Translation

The goal of the multimodal translation task is to
generate an image caption in a target language
(German) given the image itself and one or more
captions in the source language (English).

Recent experiments of Elliott et al. (2015)
showed that including the information from the
images can help disambiguate the source-language
captions.

The participants were provided with the
Multi30k dataset (Elliott et al., 2016) which is an
extension of the Flickr30k dataset (Plummer et al.,
2015). In the original dataset, 31,014 images were
taken from the users collections on the image host-
ing service Flickr. Each of the images were given
five independent crowd-sourced captions in En-
glish. For the Multi30k dataset, one of the English
captions for each image was translated into Ger-
man and five other independent German captions
were provided. The data are split into a training set
of 29,000 images, a validation set of 1,014 images
and a test set with 1,000 images.

The two ways in which the image annotation
were collected also lead to two sub-tasks. The
first one is called Multimodal Translation and its
goal is to generate a translation of an image cap-
tion to the target language given the caption in
source language and the image itself. The sec-
ond task is the Cross-Lingual Image Captioning.
In this setting, the system is provided five cap-
tions in the source language and it should generate
one caption in target language given both source-
language captions and the image itself. Both tasks
are evaluated using the BLEU (Papineni et al.,
2002) score and METEOR score (Denkowski and
Lavie, 2011). The translation task is evaluated
against a single reference sentence which is the di-
rect human translation of the source sentence. The
cross-lingual captioning task is evaluated against
the five reference captions in the target language
created independently of the source captions.

4.1 Related Work

The state-of-the-art image caption generators use
a remarkable property of the Convolutional Neu-
ral Network (CNN) models originally designed
for ImageNet classification to capture the seman-
tic features of the images. Although the images in
ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009; Russakovsky et al.,
2015) always contain a single object to classify,
the networks manage to learn a representation that
is usable in many other cases including image cap-
tioning which usually concerns multiple objects in
the image and also needs to describe complex ac-
tions and spacial and temporal relations within the
image.

Prior to CNN models, image classification used
to be based on finding some visual primitives
in the image and transcribing automatically esti-
mated relations between the primitives. Soon af-
ter Kiros et al. (2014) showed that the CNN fea-
tures could be used in a neural language model,
Vinyals et al. (2015) developed a model that used
an RNN decoder known from neural MT for gen-
erating captions from the image features instead of
the vector encoding the source sentence. Xu et al.
(2015) later even improved the model by adapt-
ing the soft alignment model (Bahdanau et al.,
2014) nowadays known as the attention model.
Since then, these models have become a bench-
mark for works trying to improve neural sequence
to sequence models (Bengio et al., 2015; Gülçehre
et al., 2016; Ranzato et al., 2015).

4.2 Phrase-Based System

For the translation task, we trained Moses SMT
(Koehn et al., 2007) with additional language
models based on coarse bitoken classes. We
follow the approach of Stewart et al. (2014):
Based on the word alignment, each target word

is concatenated with its aligned source word into
one bitoken (e.g.“Katze-cat”). For unaligned tar-
get words, we create a bitoken with NULL as
the source word (e.g. “wird-NULL”). Unaligned
source words are dropped. For more than one-to-
one alignments, we join all aligned word pairs into
one bitoken (e.g. “hat-had+gehabt-had”). These
word-level bitokens are afterwards clustered into
coarse classes (Brown et al., 1992) and a stan-
dard n-gram language model is trained on these
classes. Following the notation of Stewart et al.
(2014), “400bi” indicates a LM trained on 400
bitoken classes, “200bi” stands for 200 bitoken
classes, etc. Besides bitokens based on aligned
words, we also use class-level bitokens. For ex-
ample “(200,400)” means that we clustered source
words into 200 classes and target words into 400
classes and only then used the alignment to ex-
tract bitokens of these coarser words. The last
type is “100bi(200,400)”, a combination of both
independent clustering in the source and target
“(200,400)” and the bitoken clustering “100bi”.

Altogether, we tried 26 configurations com-
bining various coarse language models. The
best three were “200bi” (a single bitoken LM),
“200bi&(1600,200)&100tgt” (three LMs, each
with its own weight, where 100tgt means a lan-
guage model over 100 word classes trained on the
target side only) and “200bi&100tgt”.

Manual inspection of these three best configura-
tions reveals almost no differences; often the out-
puts are identical. Comparing to the baseline (a
single word-based LM), it is evident that coarse
models prefer to ensure agreement and are much
more likely to allow for a different word or prepo-
sition choice to satisfy the agreement.

4.3 Neural System

For the multimodal translation task, we combine
the RNN encoders with image features. The image
features are extracted from the 4096-dimensional
penultimate layer (fc7) of the VGG-16 Imagenet
network Simonyan and Zisserman (2014) before
applying non-linearity. We keep the weights of
the convolutional network fixed during the train-
ing. We do not use attention over the image fea-
tures, so the image information is fed to the net-
work only via the initial state.

We also try a system combination and add an
encoder for the phrase-based output. The SMT
encoder shares the vocabulary and word embed-
dings with the decoder. For the combination with
SMT output, we experimented with the CopyNet
architecture (Gu et al., 2016) and with encoding
the sequence the way as in the APE task (see Sec-
tion 3.2). Since neither of these variations seems
to have any effect on the performance, we report
only the results of the simple encoder combina-

tion.
Systems targeted for the multimodal translation

task have a single English caption (and eventually
its SMT and the image representation) on its input
and produce a single sentence which is a transla-
tion of the original caption. Every input appears
exactly once in the training data paired with ex-
actly one target sentence. On the other hand, sys-
tems targeted for the cross-lingual captioning use
all five reference sentences as a target, i.e. every
input is present five times in the training data with
five different target sentences, which are all inde-
pendent captions in German. In case of the cross-
lingual captioning, we use five parallel encoders
sharing all weights combined with the image fea-
tures in the initial state.

Results of the experiments with different input
combinations are summarized in the next section.

4.4 Results

The results of both the tasks are given in Table 2.
Our system significantly improved since the com-
petition submission, therefore we report both the
performance of the current system and of the sub-
mitted systems. Examples of the system output
can be found in Figure 3.

The best performance has been achieved by
the neural system that combined all available in-
put both for the multimodal translation and cross-
lingual captioning. Although, using the image as
the only source of information led to poor results,
adding the image information helped to improve

the performance in both tasks. This supports the
hypothesis that for the translation of an image cap-
tion, knowing the image can add substantial piece
of information.

The system for cross-lingual captioning tended
to generate very short descriptions, which were
usually true statements about the images, but the
sentences were often too general or missing im-
portant information. We also needed to truncate
the vocabulary which brought out-of-vocabulary
tokens to the system output. Unlike the transla-
tion task where the vocabulary size was around
20,000 different forms for both languages, having
5 source and 5 reference sentences increased the
vocabulary size more than twice.

Similarly to the automatic postediting task, we
were not able to come up with a setting where the
combination with the phrase-based system would
improve over the very strong Moses system with
bitoken-classes language model. We can therefore
hypothesize that the weakest point of the mod-
els is the weighted combination of the inputs for
the initial state of the decoder. The difficulty of
learning relatively big combination weighting ma-
trices which are used just once during the model
execution (unlike the recurrent connections hav-
ing approximately the same number of parame-
ters) probably over-weighted the benefits of hav-
ing more information on the input. In case of
system combination, more careful exploration of
explicit copy mechanism as CopyNet (Gu et al.,
2016) may be useful.

5 Conclusion

We applied state-of-the art neural machine transla-
tion models to two WMT shared tasks. We showed
that neural sequential models could be success-
fully applied to the APE task. We also showed that
information from the image can significantly help
while producing a translation of an image caption.
Still, with the limited amount of data provided,
the neural system performed comparably to a very
well tuned SMT system.

There is still a big room for improvement of the
performance using model ensembles or recently
introduced techniques for neural sequence to se-
quence learning. An extensive hyper-parameter
testing could be also helpful.
