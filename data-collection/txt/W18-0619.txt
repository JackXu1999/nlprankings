Abstract

Trustfulness — one’s general tendency to have
confidence in unknown people or situations —
predicts many important real-world outcomes
such as mental health and likelihood to cooper-
ate with others such as clinicians. While data-
driven measures of interpersonal trust have
previously been introduced, here, we develop
the first language-based assessment of the per-
sonality trait of trustfulness by fitting one’s
language to an accepted questionnaire-based
trust score. Further, using trustfulness as a
type of case study, we explore the role of ques-
tionnaire size as well as word count in de-
veloping language-based predictive models of
users’ psychological traits. We find that lever-
aging a longer questionnaire can yield greater
test set accuracy, while, for training, we find
it beneficial to include users who took smaller
questionnaires which offers more observations
for training. Similarly, after noting a decrease
in individual prediction error as word count
increased, we found a word count-weighted
training scheme was helpful when there were
very few users in the first place.

1 Introduction

Trust, in general, indicates confidence that an en-
tity or entities will behave in an expected man-
ner (Singh and Bawa, 2007). While trust has been
computationally explored as a property of rela-
tionships between people, i.e. interpersonal trust
(Golbeck et al., 2003; Colquitt et al., 2007; Murray
et al., 2012), few have considered trustfulness – a
personality trait of an individual indicating their
tendency, outside of any other context, to trust
in people, institutions, and situations (Nannestad,
2008).

Trustfulness is tied to many real world and so-
cial outcomes. For example, it predicts individ-
ual health (Helliwell and Wang, 2010), and how

likely one is to join or to cooperate in diverse so-
cial groups (Uslaner, 2002; Stolle, 2002), and in-
dividual mental health and well-being (Helliwell
and Wang, 2010). The importance of trustfulness
is thought to be increasing as modern societies
are increasingly interacting online with unknown
people (Dinesen and Bekkers, 2016). This sug-
gests it could be increasingly important in a clin-
ical domain where has been shown to be essen-
tial in securing a strong and effective patient-client
bond (Brennan et al., 2013; Lambert and Bar-
ley, 2001). Trait trustfulness also relates to self-
disclosure which in turn greatly aids the clinician
in her provision of care (Steel, 1991). Provider
trust also likely is important to effectively treat a
patient, especially in online therapeutic sessions,
as it signals trustworthiness and care, but research
on this topic remains sparse.

Unfortunately, traditional trustfulness measure-
ment options (e.g. surveys) are expensive to
scale to large populations and repeated assess-
ment (i.e. in clinical practice) and they carry
biases (Baumeister et al., 2007; Youyou et al.,
2017). Researchers are actively searching for
alternative behavior-based methods of measure-
ment (Nannestad, 2008).

Language use in social media offers a behav-
ior from which one can measure psychological
traits like trust. Over the last five years, more and
more researchers are turning to Facebook or Twit-
ter language to develop psychological trait predic-
tors, fitting user language to psychological scores
from questionnaires (Schwartz and Ungar, 2015).
According to standard psychometric validity tests,
such language-based approaches have been found
to rival other accepted measures, such as question-
naires and assessments from friends (Park et al.,
2015). However, while language-based predictive
models for many traits now exist, none have con-
sidered a model for trustfulness— a trait which

174



some have argued is now of marked importance as
modern societies are increasingly interacting on-
line with unknown people (Dinesen and Bekkers,
2016). Further, across such trait prediction work,
little attention has been paid to the role of (1)
questionnaire-size – how many questions are used
to assess an individual’s trait, and (2) word count –
how many words the user has written from which
the language-based predictions are made.1

Here, we answer the call for more behavior-
based trait measurement (Baumeister et al., 2007;
Youyou et al., 2017), by developing language-
based (a behavior) predictive model of trustfulness
fit to questionnaire scores, and we seek to draw
insights into the role of word count and question-
naire size in predictive modeling.

Contributions. This work makes several
key contributions. First, we introduce the first
language-based assessment of trustfulness (hence-
forth “trust”), evaluated over out-of-sample trust
questionnaires, enabling large-scale or frequently
repeated trust measurement. We also (2) study the
number of questions in the psychological survey to
which one fits our model (in other words, finding
which one matters more: number of questions in
questionnaires or number of users who took it?),
(3) explore the relationship between users’ word
count and model error, and (4) introduce a weight-
ing scheme to train on low word count users. All
together, we add trustfulness, an important trait for
clinical care, to an increasing battery of language-
based assessments.

2 Background

Previous computational work on trust has focused
on interpersonal trust – an expectation of trust
concerning future behaviour of a specific person
toward another known person. (Bamberger, 2010).
Interpersonal trust is primarily focused on situa-
tions in which there are two known individuals
(the truster and trustee) who share a history of
previous interactions. Such trust, requires study
of a history of interactions indicating how well
each member participant might understand the
others’ personalities (Kelton et al., 2008; Golbeck
et al., 2003). Interpersonal trust has been stud-
ied especially in the context of online social net-
works where it is sometimes possible to track users

1One often imposes a word count limitation — e.g. users
must write at least 1,000 words (Schwartz et al., 2013) — but
few have studied the relationship between word count and
accuracy as we do here.

from first interactions (Kuter and Golbeck, 2007;
DuBois et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2014, 2008). While
some of these works have considered the amount
of communication (Adali et al., 2010), content is
rarely considered and none of these past works
have attempted to measure the trait, trustfulness,
as we do here.

Trustfulness (also referred to as “generalized
trust”), in contrast with interpersonal trust, mea-
sures trust between strangers. As Stolle (2002)
put it:

[Trustfulness] indicates the potential
readiness of citizens to cooperate with
each other and to abstract prepared-
ness to engage in civic endeavors with
each other. Attitudes of trustfulness ex-
tend beyond the boundaries of face-to-
face interactions and incorporate peo-
ple who are not personally known.

This version of trust has been tied to the belief in
the average goodness of human nature (Yamagishi
and Yamagishi, 1994), and it involves a willing-
ness to be vulnerable and engage with random oth-
ers despite interpersonal risks (Mayer and Davis,
1999; Rousseau et al., 1998). It has been shown
predictive of individual mental health and phys-
ical well-being (Abbott and Freeth, 2008; Helli-
well and Wang, 2010). For communities, trust is
a key indicator of social capital (Coleman, 1988;
Putnam, 1993), and it is highly predictive of eco-
nomic growth (Delhey and Newton, 2005; Knack
and Zak, 2003)

2.1 Trustfulness from Questionnaires

Trustfulness, just like other personality traits is
typically measured with either questionnaires or
behavioral observations during experiments (Er-
misch et al., 2009). Data linking experiments on
trust with individual linguistic data is not available
or easily acquired, so we fit our langauge-based
model of trust to a gold-standard of questionnaire-
based trust. A variety of such questionnaires exist
with high inter-correlation, including the Faith in
People scale (Rosenberg, 1957), Yamagishi & Ya-
magishis (1999) Trust Scale, and the Trust Facet of
the Agreeableness trait in the Big Five personality
questionnaire (Goldberg et al., 2006). Here, due to
its availability, we chose to fit our language-based
trust predictor to the later of these questionnaires
– the trust personality facet.

3 Data Set.

We use trust facet scores from the trait question-
naire of consenting participants of the MyPerson-
ality study (Kosinski et al., 2015).2 From this
dataset we derive two versions of trust measure-
ment scores: (1) using 10 questions of trustful-
ness (referred to as 10-question trust), or (2) using
a subset of 3 questions (referred to as 3-question
trust). Participants can either answer all 10 ques-
tions (as part of larger set of over 300 questions)
or just answer the 3-question version (as part of a
100 questions). Each question is on a scale of 1 to
5, from totally disagree to completely agree. For
example, the following are the questions for the
3-item version:

• I believe that others have good intentions.
• I suspect hidden motives in others.∗

• I trust what people say.

Some questions (e.g. ∗ above) are “reverse scored”
so a 1 becomes a 5 and vice-versa. One’s final
trust score is based on taking the mean of the re-
sponses to the individual trust questions. Although
3-question trust is less accurate,3 it may be useful
to enable training data from more users.

From MyPersonality, we used a dataset con-
taining 19, 455 Facebook users who wrote at least
1, 000 words across all of their status updates. We
additionally included 6, 590 users who had less
than 1, 000 words in some experiments. Totally
26, 045 users took the Big Five questionnaire, an-
swering at least the 3 trust-focused questions in
it (short version). Among all the users, only 621
had completely answered all of the 10 trust related
question (long version). Table 3 represents num-
ber of users in detail. It is worth mentioning that
not only the participants consent for their Face-
book and questionnaire data to be used in research,
but also the data has been anonymized.

4 Method

We build a language-based model for the trait
of trustfulness. From Facebook status updates,

2Procedures were approved by an academic institutional
review board, and volunteers agreed to share their data for
research purposes via informed consent.

3 Based on an experiment across 1, 041 participants on
Amazon Mechanical Turk, 3-question trust had a Pearson
correlation of 0.916 with 10-question trust, indicating it is
a reasonable approximation (Buffone et al., 2017)

short version questionnaire based on their word counts.

trust score, and short version includes users who had

we extracted two types of user-level lexical fea-
tures, which have previously been shown to be
effective for trait prediction (Park et al., 2015):
(a) ngrams of length 1 to 3 and (b) LDA top-
ics. To extract the ngrams from the text we used
the HappierFunTokenizer. We did not apply any
text normalization, as past work has found that of-
ten the forms in which people choose to write a
word ends up being predictive about their person-
ality (Schwartz et al., 2013). Two types of ngrams
were extracted: one containing relative frequen-
cies of each ngram (freq(ngram,user)freq(∗,user) ) and the other
simply a binary indicator of whether the user men-
tioned each ngram at all. Considering ngrams
mentioned by at least 1% of the users, we ob-
tained 50, 166 ngrams features for each of the two
types of ngrams. Topic features were derived from
posteriors of Latent Dirichlet Allocation. We use
the 2, 000 LDA topic posteriors publicly available
from Schwartz et al. (2013).4.

We use a series of steps to avoid high dimen-
sional issues and prevent overfitting. First, an oc-
currence threshold is applied to remove words that
were used by less than 1% of people. Second,
we select features with at least a small relation-
ship with our trust labels according to having a
univariate family-wise error rate < 60. Third,
we ran a singular value decomposition (in ran-
domized batches) to effectively decrease the size
of feature space and reduce colinearity across di-
mensions(Boutsidis et al., 2015). We performed
this process based on the training data, and then
applied the resulting feature reduction on the test
data.

Each type of feature (i.e. ngram relative
frequencies, booleans, and topics) is qualita-
tively and distributionally different from each
other (Almodaresi et al., 2017). Thus, we perform

ing, are available from http://wwbp.org/data.html

reduction technique on ngrams, boolean ngrams
and topics separately. This is so the comparatively
few topic features are not likely to get lost among
the relatively plentiful ngrams. At the end, we
merge both types of features to build a single fea-
ture matrix (or an embedding with approximately
5% of the number of training observations). Sim-
ilar feature reduction pipelines have been shown
to perform well in language based predictive ana-
lytics (Zamani and Schwartz, 2017). We then use
ridge regression to fit our dimensionally reduced
feature set to the trust labels from the Big Five
questionnaires.

Questionnaire Size and Word Count. While
the 10-question trust score is more accurate, we
have less than 1, 000 users with this label. Our
default setup has the users with 10-question trust
as the test set while we train over the much larger
set of users with only 3-question trust. We then
experiment to determine if this setup is ideal.

Previous work has suggested user attribute pre-
diction benefits from an approximate minimum
threshold of 1, 000 words per user in order to get
accurate estimates of one’s personality (Schwartz
et al., 2013). Since our dataset contains 6, 590
users with less than 1, 000 words, we explore if
we can include these users in an effective way to
improve the model. To this end, we weight each
users’ contribution to the loss function proportion-
ate to the number of words she or he has written.
We used two different weighting schemes, linear
and logistic, as shown below, wherewc is the word
count, and Tmax and Tmin are 1, 000 and 200 re-
spectively.

Wlinear =
min(Tmax,max(0, wc− Tmin))

Tmax − Tmin

Wlogistic =
1

1 + exp(−Wlinear)
Thus, users with more than 1, 000 words are

weighted 1 while those with less than 200 words
are weighted 0 (we settled on these min and max
values based on our study of the mean error per
word count – Figure 1).

5 Evaluation

We focus on evaluating our language model by
comparing the performance of our model on pre-
diction of 10-question trust vs. 3-question trust

labels. We did this comparison in 3 settings: (1)
train and test on 10-question trust score, (2) train
and test on 3-question trust score, and (3) train on
3-question and test on 10-question trust score.

For the first setting, where all users answered
the same number of questions, we performed a 10-
fold cross-validation. For the second and third set-
tings, we consider all users with 10-question trust
score as our test group and the remaining users
which only had 3-question trust score but not the
10-question trust as the train group. This enables
us to first determine how well a model trained on
3-question trust performs in not only predicting 3-
question trust itself, but also the 10-question trust,
and compare the later with the model which is
trained on small group of users with 10-question
trust. In all these three experiments, we consid-
ered 1, 000 as the threshold for word count, and
used the same group of users as the test group.
We present result as both mean squared error and
disattenuated correlation which accounts for mea-
surement error: rdis(a,b) =

ra,b√
ra,arb,b

where ra,a =
.70 the reliability of the trust questionnaire (Kosin-
ski et al., 2015) and rb,b = .70 the expected re-
liability of the trust language-based measurement
based on evaluations of language-based personal-
ity assessment reliability (Park et al., 2015) (every
r on the right-hand side of the equation is a Pear-
son product-moment correlation coefficient).

train label test label Pearson rdis MSE
10-question 10-question 0.259 0.719
3-question 3-question 0.426 0.776
3-question 10-question 0.494 0.662

Table 2: Comparing the language model performance
on 3-question trust score vs. 10-question trust score.
Pearson rdis is dissattenuated Pearson r and MSE is
the mean squared error.

As shown in table 2, our model’s rdis with only
limited 10-item data is 0.259, suggesting we can-
not learn a very accurate model by training on such
a small number of users. Comparing the second
and third settings, we see the result of testing on
10-question trust score outperforms the 3-question
trust score by 0.07 margin in dissattenuated Pear-
son r and MSE by a margin of 0.11. To further
understand why 10-question trust seems to be eas-
ier to predict, we calculate the variance for both 3-
question and 10-question trust, yielding σ2 = 0.85
and σ2 = 0.72 respectively. This suggests that 10-
question trust has less noise than 3-question trust.
Due to these results, in all of the following experi-

177



Features Pearson rdis MSE
sentiment (baseline) 0.279 0.717
ngr r 0.453 0.681
ngr b 0.411 0.688
topics 0.458 0.677
word2vec 0.449 0.678
ngr r + ngr b +topics 0.494 0.662
ngr r + ngr b +topics+sent 0.483 0.666

ture sets: ngr r: ngrams as relative frequencie, ngr b:
ngrams as boolean variables. Bold indicates the best
performance. Pearson rdis is dissattenuated Pearson r
and MSE is the mean squared error.

ments we only train on 3-question trust labels and
test on 10-question trust labels.

We next evaluate the performance of our trust
model by comparing to two baseline models. Be-
cause positiveness is associated with trust (Hel-
liwell and Wang, 2010), we consider a baseline
of sentiment scores using the NRC hashtag sen-
timent lexicon, an integral part of the best system
participating in SemEval-2013 (Mohammad et al.,
2013). We also compare it to clusters of words de-
rived from word2vec embeddings (Mikolov et al.,
2013) using spectral clustering (Preoţiuc-Pietro
et al., 2015).

Figure 1: Effect of word count on error rate of the lan-
guage model: ngr b stands for binary-ngrams and ngr r
stands for relative-ngrams.

Table 3 demonstrates the predictive perfor-
mance of our model in comparison to the senti-
ment and word2vec baselines. Our best model

(ngr r + ngr b+ topics) had an 8% reduction in
mean squared error over sentiment, and achieved
a Pearson correlation coefficient of rdis = .494
which is considered a large relationship between
a behavior (language use) and a psychological
trait (Meyer et al., 2001) and just below state-of-
the-art language-based assessments of other per-
sonality traits (Park et al., 2015).

In the next experiment we present how the er-
ror rate changes as a function of word count per
user using various combinations of features. We
trained 4 models using (1) relative-ngrams, (2)
binary-ngrams, (3) topics, and (4) all features to-
gether. We predict the 10-question trust score of
our test users and plot the test users error rate
with respect to their word count, which is shown
in figure 1. Overall, users’ trust score is more
predictable as they use more words flattening out
after 1000 words. Additionally, for users with
few words, relative-ngrams and binary-ngrams are
equally predictive and better than topics. For users
with many words, the prediction power of binary-
ngrams fades out, likely reflecting features being
primarily ones. Similarly, topic-based models per-
form better for talkative users, likely because more
words means better topic estimation.

Figure 2: Effect of increasing the number of train-
ing users, who have more than 1, 000 word count,
while there are 6, 590 users with less than 1, 000
word count in train set: “Threshold-1000” is training
ridge-regression on users with at least 1, 000 words,
“threshold-200” is training ridge-regression on users
with at least 200 words, “linear” is training weighted
ridge-regression on users with at least 200 words, and
finally “logistic” is training weighted ridge-regression
on users with at least 200 words.

178



Figure 3: Unigrams most distinguish trust according to absolute value of (a) positive correlation and (b) negative
correlated with 3-question trust score. Size of word indicates correlation strength, while color indicates frequency.
All unigrams listed are significantly correlated at Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p < .05.

Now that we know word count is correlated
with prediction error, we explore a word count
weighting scheme that enables us to include 6, 590
users with fewer than 1, 000 words in training.
Such users are included in three different ways, (1)
without using any weight, (2) using linear weight-
ing, and (3) using logistic weighting.

In figure 2 we compare the various model train-
ing setups at different training sizes. As shown,
when we have just a few users with more than
1, 000 words, including more users, but with low
word count, improves the performance, no matter
which models we exploit. However, as the num-
ber of users with more than 1, 000 word count in-
creases, injecting low word count users hurts the
performance. In addition, the weighting scheme
does not seem to help at all in this situation.

To get an idea of the type of features signalling
high and low trust predictions, we ran a differential
language analysis (Schwartz et al., 2013) to iden-
tify the top 50, independently, most predictive fea-
tures. Figure 3 show the word-clouds of both pos-
itively correlated and negatively correlated with
3-question trust score, limited to those passing a
Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery rate alpha
of 0.01 (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). Many of
the ngrams correspond with the definition of trust-
fulness, such as the pro-social words in the posi-
tive predictors (e.g. ‘friends’ ‘family’, ‘thanks’).
On the other hand, many curse words can be seen
among negative predictors.

6 Conclusion

We introduced the first language-based model for
measuring trustfulness from language, and used it
to study novel and useful aspects of the predictive
modeling of user traits. First, we found that lan-
guage use in social media can be used to predict
trustfulness about as accurate as other personality
traits. Then, we found that, in order to build a lan-
guage model over questionnaires, including more
users who took a shorter questionnaire can lead
to improvement, in comparison to using less users
who took a longer questionnaire. We also showed
that the language model usually performs better in
predicting users with more total word count, with
error flattening out around 1, 000 words, and that
when there are few users (i.e < 1, 000) it is worth
lowering the minimum word count threshold to in-
clude more users for training purpose. However,
using a weighting scheme was not helpful.

Our scaleable measure of trust enables future
work to investigate some interesting questions
about trust, such as those involved in large-scale
or frequent assessments. For example, this may al-
low for large-scale assessments of trait trustfulness
of different patient populations or of samples of
clinicians. Also, if clients were to opt into sharing
of social media, therapists may be able to use this
model to detect drops in patient trust which may
help to understand when one is more receptive or
not. Trends over time may help to signal interper-
sonal improvements or regressions, as well as neg-
ative interactions with others. It should be noted

179



that while trust is thought of as a relatively stable
personality aspect or trait, some research suggests
that it is malleable over time (Jones and George,
1998), so changes in trust over time could be
another meaningful exploration for future study.
Thus, the present model may be helpful for the
generation of trustful chat bots, such as virtual as-
sistants or therapeutic aids.
