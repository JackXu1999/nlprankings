Abstract

Controversial claims are abundant in online
media and discussion forums. A better
understanding of such claims requires an-
alyzing them from different perspectives.
Stance classification is a necessary step
for inferring these perspectives in terms of
supporting or opposing the claim. In this
work, we present a neural network model
for stance classification leveraging BERT
representations and augmenting them with a
novel consistency constraint. Experiments on
the Perspectrum dataset, consisting of claims
and users’ perspectives from various debate
websites, demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach over state-of-the-art baselines.

1 Introduction

There is an abundance of contentious claims
on the Web including controversial statements
from politicians, biased news reports, rumors,
etc. People express their perspectives about these
controversial claims through various channels like
editorials, blog posts, social media, and discussion
forums. To achieve a deeper understanding
of these claims, we need to understand users’
perspectives and stance towards the claims.
Recent research (FNC-1, 2016; Baly et al., 2018;
Chen et al., 2019) has shown stance classification
to be a critical step for information credibility and
automated fact-checking.

Prior Work and Limitations: Prior ap-
proaches for stance classification proposed in
Somasundaran and Wiebe (2010); Anand et al.
(2011); Walker et al. (2012); Hasan and Ng (2013,
2014); Sridhar et al. (2015); Sun et al. (2018)
rely on various linguistic features, e.g., n-grams,
dependency parse tree, opinion lexicons, and
sentiment to determine the stance of perspectives
regarding controversial topics. Ferreira and Vla-
chos (2016) further incorporate natural language

claims and propose a logistic regression model
using the lexical and semantic features of claims
and perspectives. SemEval tasks (Mohammad
et al., 2016; Kochkina et al., 2017) and other
approaches (Chen and Ku, 2016; Lukasik et al.,
2016; Sobhani et al., 2017) have focused on
determining stance only in Tweets.

Bar-Haim et al. (2017) propose classifiers based
on hand-crafted lexicons to identify important
phrases in perspectives and their consistency with
the claim to predict the stance However, their
model critically relies on manual lexicons and
assumes that the important phrases in claims are
already identified.

Neural-network-based approaches for stance
classification learn the claim and perspective
representations separately and later combine them
with conditional LSTM encoding (Augenstein
et al., 2016), attention mechanisms (Du et al.,
2017) or memory networks (Mohtarami et al.,
2018). Some neural network models also
incorporate lexical features (Riedel et al., 2017;
Hanselowski et al., 2018). None of these
approaches leverage knowledge acquired from
massive external corpora.

Approach and Contributions: To overcome
the limitations of prior works, we present
STANCY, a neural network model for stance
classification. Given an input pair of a claim
and a user’s perspective, our model predicts
whether the perspective is supporting or opposing
the claim. For example, the claim “You have
nothing to worry about surveillance, if you
have done nothing wrong” is supported by the
user perspective “Information gathered through
surveillance could be used to fight terrorism”
and opposed by another user perspective “With
surveillance, the user privacy will go away!”.

Our model for stance classification leverages

neural network model (Devlin et al., 2019). BERT
is trained on huge text corpora and serves as
background knowledge. We fine-tune BERT
for our task which also allows us to jointly
model claims and perspectives. Furthermore,
we enhance our model by augmenting it with a
novel consistency constraint to capture agreement
between the claim and perspective.

Key contributions of this paper are:

• Model: A neural network model for stance
classification leveraging BERT representa-
tions learned over massive external corpora
and a novel consistency constraint to jointly
model claims and perspectives.

• Interpretability: A simple approach to
interpret the contribution of perspective tokens
in deciding their stance towards the claim.

• Experiments: Experiments on a recent
dataset, Perspectrum, highlighting the effec-
tiveness of our approach with error analysis.

2 BERT-based Approaches

In this section, first we describe the base
model, BERTBASE, that is adapted for the stance
classification (Chen et al., 2019). Thereafter, we
present our consistency-aware model, BERTCONS.

2.1 Adapting BERT for Stance Classification

The goal of the stance classification task is to
determine the stance of the user Perspective (P )
with respect to the Claim (C). Since this task
involves a pair of sentences (C and P ), we follow
the approach for sentence pair classification task
as proposed in Devlin et al. (2019); Chen et al.
(2019).

In order to obtain the representation XP |C of
P with respect to C, this sentence pair is fused
into a single input sequence by using a special

classification token ([CLS]) and a separator token
([SEP]): [CLS] Ctoks [SEP] Ptoks [SEP].
The input sequences are tokenized using Word-
Piece tokenization. The final hidden state
representation corresponding to the [CLS] token
is used as XP |C ∈ RH . The classification
probability is given by passing this representation
through the softmax layer:

ŷ = softmax(XP |CW T ) (1)

where softmax layer weights W ∈ RH×K
and K is the number of stance (classification)
labels. All the parameters of BERT and W are
fine-tuned jointly by minimizing the cross-entropy
loss (lossce). The architecture of this model,
BERTBASE, is shown in Figure 1a.

2.2 Consistency-aware Stance Classification

In this setting, we want to incorporate the
consistency between the claim (C) and perspective
(P ) representations. We hypothesize that the
latent representations of claim and perspective
should be dissimilar if the perspective opposes
the claim, whereas their representations should
be similar if the claim is supported by the
perspective. We capture this with the following
components.

Claim Representation: To capture the latent
representation of the claim, we use only the
claim text as the input sequence to BERT, i.e.,
[CLS] C [SEP]. The final hidden state of the
first input token ([CLS]) is used as the claim’s
representation XC ∈ RH .

Perspective Representation: Latent represen-
tation of the perspective (with respect to the
claim) is captured by fusing the two sequences as
described in Section 2.1. We pack the claim and
perspective pair as a single input sequence and use
the final hidden state of the first input token as the
perspective representation XP |C ∈ RH .

Table 1: Perspectrum data statistics.

Capturing Consistency: To incorporate the
consistency between claim and perspective repre-
sentations, we use the cosine embedding loss:

losscos =

{
1− cos(XC , XP |C) ysim = 1
max(0, cos(XC , XP |C)) ysim = −1

where cos(.) is the cosine similarity function.
ysim is equal to 1 if the perspective is supporting
the claim (similar representations), and −1 if the
claim is opposed by the perspective (dissimilar
representations).

Joint Loss: The classification probabilities
are determined by concatenating XP |C and
cos(XC , XP |C) and passing it through a softmax
layer. However, unlike the BERTBASE con-
figuration, parameters of the consistency-aware
model are learned by optimizing the joint loss
function: loss = lossce + losscos. With this joint
loss function, we enforce consistency between
latent representations of the claim and perspective.
The architecture of this consistency-aware model,
BERTCONS, is shown in Figure 1b.

3 Experimental Setup

For our experiments, we consider the base version
of BERT1 with 12 layers, 768 hidden size, and
12 attention heads. We fine-tune BERT-based
models using the Adam optimizer with learning
rates {1, 3, 5} × 10−5 and training batch sizes
{24, 28, 32}. We choose the best parameters based
on the development split of the dataset. For
measuring the performance, we use per-class and
macro-averaged Precision/Recall/F1.

3.1 Dataset
We evaluate our approach on the Perspectrum
dataset (Chen et al., 2019). Perspectrum contains
claims and users’ perspectives from various
online debate websites like idebate.com,
debatewise.org, and procon.org. Each
claim has different perspectives along with the
stance (supporting or opposing the claim). We

1BERT implementation: https://git.io/fhbJQ

use the same train/dev/test split as provided in the
released dataset. Statistics of the dataset is shown
in Table 1.

3.2 Baselines
We use the following baselines:

LSTM: A long short-term memory (LSTM)
model, in which we pass the claim and perspective
word representations (using GloVE-6B word
embeddings of size 300) through a bidirectional
LSTM. Then we concatenate the final hidden
states of the claim and perspective, and pass it
through dense layers with ReLU activations.

ESIM: An enhanced sequential inference model
(ESIM) for natural language inference proposed in
Chen et al. (2017).

MLP: Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) based model
using lexical and similarity-based features –
presented as a simple but tough-to-beat baseline
for stance detection in Riedel et al. (2017).

WordAttn: Our implementation of word-by-word
attention-based model using long short-term
memory networks (Rocktäschel et al., 2016).

LangFeat: A random forest classifier using
linguistic lexicons like NRC lexicon (Mohammad
and Turney, 2010), hedges (e.g., possibly, might,
etc.), positive/negative sentiment words (Hu and
Liu, 2004), MPQA subjective lexicon (Wilson
et al., 2005) and bias lexicon (Recasens et al.,
2013) along with sentiment scores as features.

BERTBASE: Approach proposed in Chen et al.
(2019) (as described in Section 2.1).

Human: Human performance on this task as
reported in Chen et al. (2019).

4 Results and Discussion

Stance classification performance of our model
and the baselines on the test split of the
Perspectrum dataset are presented in Table 2. Our
consistency-aware model BERTCONS outperforms
all the other baselines. It achieves a performance
improvement of about 2 points in F1-score
over the strong baseline corresponding to the
BERTBASE model (p-value of 4.985e−4 as per
the McNemar test). This highlights the value
addition achieved by incorporating consistency
cues. Since the BERT-based models incorporate
the knowledge acquired from massive external
corpora, our model, BERTCONS, captures better
semantics and outperforms the other baselines.

4.1 Interpreting Token-level Contribution

Due to the massive structure of BERT with a
complex attention mechanism, it is difficult to
interpret the significance of different lexical units
in the text. Therefore, we propose a simple
technique to interpret the contribution of each
token in the text in determining the stance.

Given the claim (C) and perspective (P ) pair,
we tokenize P into phrases. We record the change
in stance classification probabilities by adding one
perspective phrase at a time to the input:

∆i = |BERTCONS(C,Pi)−BERTCONS(C,Pi−1)|
where Pi is the prefix of P up to the ith phrase.
This helps us in understanding the contribution of
each perspective phrase towards determining the
stance – the larger the change in the classification
probabilities, the larger the contribution. For this
analysis, we consider unigrams and chunks from
a shallow parser as phrases. The top contributing
phrases for the supporting and opposing classes
are shown in Table 3.

4.2 Error Analysis

In this section, we analyze why the task of
stance classification is challenging and why the
performance of the best model configuration is
far from human performance as observed by the
performance gap in Table 2.

Negations: One of the major challenges in solving
this task is understanding negations and their
scope. For example, given the claim “College
education is worth it”, the perspective “Many
college graduates are employed in jobs that do
not require college degrees” is opposing the claim.
However, our model is not able to capture that
the negation phrase ‘do not require’ opposes the
claim. On the other hand, the presence of negation
in the perspective does not necessarily imply that it
is opposing the claim. Contrast this with the claim
“Chess must be at the Olympics” and perspective
“Chess is currently not an Olympic sport, but it
should be” – where the negation is merely a part
of the statement and the stance is given by the
discourse segment following ‘but’.
Commonsense: Determining the stance may
require commonsense knowledge. For example,
the claim “Chess must be at the Olympics” is
opposed by the perspective “Olympic sports are
supposed to be physical”. To understand this, the
model should have the background knowledge that
chess is not a physical sport.
Semantics: Understanding the stance also
involves a deeper understanding of semantics. For
example, given the claim “Make all museums free
of charge” is opposed by the perspective “State
funding should be used elsewhere”. Here, the
word ‘elsewhere’ is the key cue which determines
the stance. However, the presence of the word
‘elsewhere’ does not necessarily imply that the
perspective is opposing the claim. For instance,
the perspective “We could spend the money
elsewhere” is supporting the claim “The EU
should significantly reduce the amount it spends
on agricultural production subsidies”. Hence, the
polarity of the word ‘elsewhere’ is determined by
the context and semantics of the statement.

5 Conclusion

In this work, we propose a consistency-aware
neural network model for stance classification.
Our model leverages representations from the
BERT model trained over massive external
corpora and a novel consistency constraint to
jointly model claims and perspectives. Our
experiments on a recent benchmark highlight the
advantages of our approach. We also study the gap
in human performance and the performance of the
best model for stance classification.
