Abstract

We address the question whether children
can acquire mature use of higher-level
grammatical choices from the linguistic
input, given only general prior knowledge
and learning biases. We do so on the ba-
sis of a case study with the dative alterna-
tion in English, building on a study by de
Marneffe et al. (2012) who model the pro-
duction of the dative alternation by seven
young children, using data from the Child
Language Data Exchange System corpus.
Using mixed-effects logistic modelling on
the aggregated data of these children, De
Marneffe et al. report that the children’s
choices can be predicted both by their own
utterances and by child-directed speech.
Here we bring the computational model-
ing down to the individual child, using
memory-based learning and incremental
learning curve studies. We observe that
for all children, their dative choices are
best predicted by a model trained on child-
directed speech. Yet, models trained on
two individual children for which suffi-
cient data is available are about as accu-
rate. Furthermore, models trained on the
dative alternations of these children pro-
vide approximations of dative alternations
in caregiver speech that are about as ac-
curate as training and testing on caregiver
data only.

1 Introduction

The production of language is the result of a great
number of choices made by the individual speaker,
where each choice may be affected by various
factors that, according to a large body of work,
range from simple word frequencies to subtle se-
mantic factors. For instance, which variant of

the dative alternation speakers produce has been
shown in a corpus study to be partially affected
by the animacy and givenness of the recipient and
theme (Bresnan et al., 2007). An inanimate recip-
ient tends to co-occur with a prepositional dative
construction (“bring more jobs and more federal
spending to their little area”).

Somehow and at some point in language ac-
quisition, children learn these preferences, but it
takes several years before children approximate
adult language use. Monitoring and modeling
this process of development may shed light on
the inner workings of language learning in gen-
eral, but to keep experiments under control, most
studies, including the one presented here, zoom
in on a representative but specific phenomenon.
The dative alternation has been the topic of sev-
eral studies in which computational models are
trained on naturalistic data (Perfors et al., 2010;
Parisien and Stevenson, 2010; Villavicencio et
al., 2013; Conwell et al., 2011), such as of-
fered by the Child Language Data Exchange Sys-
tem (CHILDES) (MacWhinney, 2000), a publicly
available database of children’s speech produced
in a natural environment. These approaches ad-
dress what is conventionally known as “Baker’s
paradox” (Baker, 1979; Pinker, 1989), which can
be phrased as the question how children learn not
to generalize a syntactic alternation to cases that
block alternation, such as the verb ’donate’, which
only allows the prepositional dative construction.

In contrast, the present contribution continues a
line of research introduced by de Marneffe et al.
(2012), who formulate three research questions:
(1) do children show sensitivity to linguistic prob-
ability in their own syntactic choices, and if so, (2)
are those probabilities driven by the same factors
that affect adult production? And finally, (3) do
children assign the same weight to various factors
as their caretakers? If so, then this may support
the hypothesis that from early on children are sen-

103



sitive to (complex) variable distributional patterns.
At the highest theoretical level, the present

study addresses the question whether children can
acquire mature use of higher-level grammatical
choices from the linguistic input, given only gen-
eral prior knowledge and learning biases—or is a
rich system of domain-specific abstract linguistic
knowledge required from the outset? See, for ex-
ample, Ambridge and Lieven (2015; Pine et al.
(2013; Yang (2013; Conwell et al. (2011; Perfors
et al. (2010), for a recent sample of the debate.

The present study addresses this question by ap-
plying a well-developed exemplar-based machine
learning model incrementally to children’s linguis-
tic experiences, represented by samples of child
and caregiver productions from the CHILDES cor-
pora (MacWhinney, 2000), gathered for the prior
study of de Marneffe et al. (2012). In terms
of computational theory, the model used in the
present study is one of the class of mathemati-
cal kernel methods from Machine Learning theory,
which encompass classical learning models such
as exemplar theory (Jäkel et al., 2009; Nosofsky,
1986).

More generally, we compare the predictions of
an exemplar-based machine learning method to
choices made by individual human subjects as a
direct test of the model’s cognitive plausibility for
learning. Following Jäkel et al. (2009) we use the
tools-to-theories heuristic of Gigerenzer (1991) in
that we see our model as a mathematically and
computationally simple and transparent emulation
of the complex individual subject. What we em-
ulate is the subject trying to model the data he or
she observes as examples stored in memory (Jäkel
et al., 2009).

2 The dative construction in English

Syntactic alternations such as the genitive, da-
tive, or locative alternation in English are choices
that speakers have in generating different syntactic
forms that carry approximately the same meaning.
Monitoring speakers and observing which partic-
ular choices they make in which context allows us
to explore the predictive components in this con-
text from which we can guess which choice is go-
ing to be made.

The English dative alternation, the focus of this
contribution, refers to the choice between a prepo-
sitional dative construction (NP PP) as in “I gave
the duck to my Mommy”, where the NP is the

theme and the PP contains the recipient, and a dou-
ble object construction (NP NP) as in “I gave my
Mommy the duck”, where the first NP is the recip-
ient and the second NP is the theme. A robust find-
ing accross studies is that inanimate, indefinite,
nominal, or longer arguments tend to be placed in
the final complement position of the dative con-
struction, while animate, definite, pronominal, or
shorter arguments are placed next to the verb, pre-
ceding the other complement (de Marneffe et al.,
2012). This means, for instance, that if a recipi-
ent of the dative construction is pronominal, such
as me, it will tend to occur immediately after the
verb, triggering a double object dative.

The dative construction is frequently used by
children as well as their caregivers in child-
directed speech (Campbell and Tomasello, 2001);
this makes it a suitable focus for the computational
modeling of syntactic alternations in child produc-
tion.

While de Marneffe et al. (2012) use mixed-
effects logistic regression to model dative alterna-
tion in children’s speech, Theijssen (2012) com-
pares regression-based and memory-based learn-
ing accounts of the dative alternation choice in
adults. Theijssen’s dataset consisted of 11,784
adult constructions of both types extracted from
the British National Corpus (Burnard, 2000),
7,757 of which occur in transcribed spoken utter-
ances, and 4,027 in written sentences. Her mixed-
effects logistic regression approach uses automat-
ically extracted higher-level determinants: ani-
macy, definiteness, givenness, pronominality, and
person of the recipient, and definiteness, given-
ness, and pronominality of the theme. Alterna-
tively, Theijssen applied a memory-based learning
classifier (Daelemans and Van den Bosch, 2005)
which we also apply in this study. The memory-
based approach she used included lexical informa-
tion only: the identity (stem) of the verb, the recip-
ient, and the theme.

Theijssen reports that MBL classifies unseen
cases about as accurately (93.1% correct) into the
two dative choices as regression analysis does,
which attains a fit of 93.5%, while MBL does so
without the higher-level features. According to
Theijssen, the main factors for the success of the
simple MBL approach are the strong licensing of
one or the other dative construction by particular
verbs, and the significant effect of length differ-
ence between recipient and theme. Both aspects of

104



the input can be learned directly from from lexical
input, while they remain hidden in the higher-level
features. In this study we keep the available fea-
tures identical to the earlier approach introduced
by de Marneffe et al. (2012) in order to stay close
to this particular study, which focused on datives
with two verbs only (give and show).

3 Modeling learning curves of individual
children

3.1 Memory-based learning

Memory-based learning is a computational ap-
proach to solving natural language processing
problems. The approach is based on the com-
bination of a memory component and a process-
ing component. Learning happens by storing at-
tested examples of the problem in memory. New
unseen examples of the same problem are solved
through similarity-based reasoning on the basis
of the stored examples (Daelemans and Van den
Bosch, 2005). In other words, memory-based
learning offers a computational implementation of
example-based or exemplar-based language pro-
cessing.

Van den Bosch and Daelemans (2013) argue
that from a cognitive perspective the approach is
attractive as a model for human language pro-
cessing because it does not make any assumptions
about the way abstractions are shaped, nor does it
make any a priori distinction between regular and
exceptional exemplars, allowing it to explain fluid-
ity of linguistic categories, and both regularization
and irregularization in processing.

As a software tool for our experiments we use
TiMBL1 (Daelemans et al., 2010). In all our ex-
periments we use the default setting of this imple-
mentation, which is based on the IB1 algorithm
(Aha et al., 1991) and which adds an information-
theoretic feature weighting metric. When the
memory-based learning algorithm is asked to pre-
dict the class of an unseen test exemplar, it com-
pares it to all training exemplars in memory, and
constructs a ranking of the k nearest (or most sim-
ilar) neighbors. The class that the algorithm pre-
dicts for the new exemplar is the majority class
found among the k nearest neighbors.

To compute the similarity between an unseen
test exemplar and a single training exemplar, the

1TiMBL, Tilburg Memory-Based Learner, is an open-
source toolkit available from http://ilk.uvt.nl/
timbl. We used version 6.4.5.

Overlap similarity function is used, weighted by
gain ratio (Daelemans et al., 2010), expressed in
Equation 1:

∆(X,Y ) =
n∑

i=1

wi δ(xi, yi) (1)

where:

δ(xi, yi) =

{
0 if xi = yi
1 if xi 6= yi (2)

and wi represents the gain-ratio weight of fea-
ture i:

wi =
H(C)−∑v∈Vi P (v)×H(C|v)

si(i)
(3)

Where C is the set of class labels, H(C) =
−∑c∈C P (c) log2 P (c) is the entropy of the class
labels, Vi is the set of values for feature i, and
H(C|v) is the conditional entropy of the subset
of the training examples that have value v on fea-
ture i. The probabilities are estimated from rela-
tive frequencies in the training set. Finally, si(i) is
the so-called split info, or the entropy of the val-
ues, of feature i (Quinlan, 1993):

si(i) = −
∑
v∈Vi

P (v) log2 P (v) (4)

The gain ratio weighting assigns higher weights
to features that are more predictive with respect
to the class. It is more robust than the simpler
information gain metric, which overestimates the
importance of features with many values (such as
lexical features); the split info, the entropy of the
values, acts as a penalty for a feature with many
values. One effect of this weighting in the simi-
larity function is that mismatches on features with
a large gain ratio cause memory exemplars to be
more distant than when the mismatch is on fea-
tures with a small gain ratio. On the other hand,
the gain ratio weight of a feature may be so promi-
nent that it promotes a memory exemplar with a
matching value on that feature to the top-ranking
k nearest neighbors, despite the fact that other less
important features carry non-matching values.

Memory-based learning can be likened to local
regression or locally-weighted learning (Atkeson
et al., 1997). It has similar issues with feature
collinearity (gain ratio weights are computed sep-
arately for each feature; redundancy is not taken

105



into account), but by limiting its decision to lo-
cal evidence found close to the test exemplar, the
algorithm is sensitive to subtle co-occurences of
matching features in the k nearest neighbors.

The default version of TiMBL, used in this
study, sets the number of neighbors to k = 1,
which implies that an unseen test vector is com-
pared to all training exemplars, and the dative
choice label of the single most similar training ex-
emplar is taken as the prediction of the test exem-
plar.

4 Experimental setup

4.1 Data collection

We used the same data as de Marneffe et al.
(2012), which were extracted from the CHILDES
database (MacWhinney, 2000). De Marneffe et al.
focused on seven children: Abe, Adam, Naomi,
Nina, Sarah, Shem, and Trevor, based on the
amount of data available for them compared to
other children, in terms of both their total number
of utterances and the number of utterances con-
taining one of the variants of the dative alternation.
The utterances were taken from the children’s pro-
duction between the ages of 2–5 years. The data
yielded a sufficient number of utterances to inves-
tigate two verbs in depth, give and show, which
are the only ones considered in this study. On
top of this filtering, De Marneffe et al. selected
only dative constructions following the “verb NP
NP” (double object) construction or “verb NP PP”
(prepositional dative) construction.

For all seven children, conversations with care-
givers were included as well. Table 1 lists the basic
statistics of available child and child-directed ut-
terances with dative alternations, and the age range
of the individual children (in days). For two chil-
dren, Adam and Nina, we have more than one hun-
dred dative attestations in their own speech. For
both children we also have more than one hun-
dred datives in the speech directed to them by their
caregivers; for a third child, Shem, we also have
over a hundred caregiver utterances containing da-
tives.

Following the encoding of the data by De Marn-
effe et al. in their computational modeling experi-
ment with mixed-effects logistic regression, all at-
testations of both dative constructions in their ut-
terance context are converted to feature vectors.
Each vector (examplar) is metadated with the ex-
act day of attestation, and labeled with the dative

choice made by the child (i.e. a binary choice
between the double object construction and the
prepositional dative). Each vector is composed
of fourteen feature values; the fourteen underlying
features are listed in Table 2.

The Theme and Recipient length features are
manually corrected due to the fact that in the orig-
inal data used by De Marneffe et al. some recip-
ients and themes mistakenly included other mate-
rial such as adverbials.

The third column of Table 3 lists the gain ratio
weights for each feature (cf. Equation 3). These
weights seem to suggest four groups of features:

1. Theme pronoun status and Recipient pronoun
status are by far the most predictive features.
Theme pronoun status has a weight about 2.5
times higher than that of Recipient pronoun
status, and over three times higher than the
third highest weight;

2. There is a second-tier group of informative
features with a gain ratio of about 0.07−0.08:
Prime, Theme, Recipient, Recipient given-
ness levels, Theme corrected lenght, and Re-
cipient corrected length;

3. A third-tier group of features has weights in
the range of 0.02 − 0.05: Theme givenness
levels, Theme animacy, and Recipient toy an-
imacy;

4. A fourth-tier group has near-zero weights,
carrying hardly any predictive information:
Verb, Recipient animacy, and Theme toy ani-
macy.

Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, the identity of
the verb (give or show) is virtually unrelated to the

dative choice. In other words, the identity of the
verb does not license one of the dative construc-
tions.2 The high weights for the pronoun status
features imply that the likelihood of being a near-
est neighbor is large when it has the same values
on either of these features as the test exemplar.
Yet, the weights of the other features, especially
those in the second-tier group, are large enough to
outweigh a mismatch on the pronoun features.

4.2 Learning curve evaluation

Our experiments are run per individual child, in an
iterative experiment that tracks the child on a day-
by-day basis and computes a learning curve. Fig-
ure 1 illustrates how the iterative learning curve
experiment takes its first steps. At each point of
the curve, all dative choices attested so far consti-
tute the training set, while all new dative choices
attested in the single next day on which datives are
observed constitute the test set. Hence, the first

2This may be different for other verbs than give or show.

training set is the first day on which the child gen-
erated one or more dative constructions; the first
test set is derived from the next day the child pro-
duced datives. In the second step, the test set of
the first step is added to the training data, and the
next test set consists of all datives produced by the
child on a next day.

At each step the incrementally learning
memory-based classifier adds the new examples
to memory, after which it classifies the new test
set, which may only contain one or a handful of
attestations. All single predictions per day are
recorded as a sequence of predictions and whether
these predictions were correct or incorrect. At
each point of the curve a correctness score can
be produced that aggregates over all predictions
so far. At the end of the curve we achieve an
aggregate score over all predictions.

The desired outcome of a learning curve exper-
iment is obviously a metric expressing the success
of predicting the right choices. In order for indi-

in the first day of attestations, and the test material

material is added to the training set, and the third
day of attestations is now the test set.

vidual experimental outcomes to be comparable,
they should not be based on different skews in the
distribution between the two dative choices. Ac-
curacy (the percentage of correct predictions) will
not do, as it is biased to the majority class. When
a child would choose one dative construction in
90% of the cases, a classifier trained on that child
would easily score 90% accurate predictions by
only guessing the majority outcome, while a clas-
sifier that is able to attain 80% correct predictions
for a child that chooses between the two alterna-
tions in a 50%–50% distribution is intrinsically
more successful and interesting.

To eliminate the effect that class skew may have
on our evaluation metric we evaluate our classifier
predictions in the learning curve experiments with
the area under the curve (AUC) metric (Fawcett,
2004). The AUC metric computes, per class, the
surface under a curve or a point classifier in the
two-dimensional receiver operation characteristic
(ROC) space, where the one dimension is the true
positive rate (or recall) of predicting the class,
and the other dimension is the false positive rate
of mispredicting the class. Figure 2 displays the
AUC score of the outcome of a classifier (a point
classifier as it produces a single score rather than
a curve) on a class, depicted by the large dot; the
AUC score is the area of the gray surface.

choices, and take the micro-average of the two
AUC scores; i.e. each score is weighted by the rel-
ative proportion of occurrence of its choice. The
resulting number is a score between 0.5 and 1.0
that is insensitive to the skew between the two da-
tive choices in a particular child’s data, where 0.5
means baseline performance (random or majority
guessing), and 1.0 means perfect prediction.

5 Results

As an illustration of the measurements taken dur-
ing learning curve experiments, Figure 3 displays
the curves for Adam and Nina, the children with
most observations. Starting at 100% AUC score,
the curves of both children initially drop consider-
ably, and then rise to a score that appears to stabi-
lize, at least for Adam for whom data is available
into his fifth year. Later points in the curve are
based on more training data.

At the end of each curve, the aggregated score
can be measured, which in the best case would be a
good approximation of the stabilized score we saw
with Adam. Table 3 lists the aggregated score at
the end of the curve for all seven children. Adam’s
dative choices can be predicted at an AUC score
of 0.80, while Nina’s choices are predicted with
an AUC score of 0.71. For all other children the
available data is insufficient to arrive at any above-
chance performance.

To arrive at a sufficient amount of data per child
we can add the data from all other children to all
points of the learning curve, mixing the child’s
own data with substantially more data from other
children. The fourth column of Table 3 shows that

this leads to above-chance performance of 0.7 or
higher for all children except for Naomi (0.52).
However, Adam’s score is slightly lower after this
mix (0.77 versus 0.80 on Adam’s own data).

As De Marneffe et al.’s study suggests, it makes
sense to predict the children’s dative choices from
child-directed speech, which represents one of
the major sources of language input a child re-
ceives. To avoid any effects of alignment (such as
the child repeating the caregiver), we constructed
training sets for all children that exclude the utter-
ances of their own caregivers. The fifth column
of Table 3 lists the AUC scores obtained with this
experiment. This leads to improved scores for all
children, except for Adam; the score of 0.80 based
on his own data is not surpassed.

Finally, the sixth column of Table 3 displays
the scores at the end of the learning curve when
all available data is used as additional data dur-
ing all points of the curve, including all child-
directed speech from other children and all other
children’s data. Surprisingly the advantage of hav-
ing the maximal amount of training data is not vis-
ible in the scores, which are mostly lower, except
for Adam (stable at 0.80) and Nina, the other child
for which sufficient data was available (0.79).

Overall, the individual scores for all children
range between 0.79 and 0.88, which could be con-
sidered accurate. For comparison, De Marneffe
et al report a C score of 0.89 by their aggregate
model. The C score (Harrell, 2001) is typically
used for measuring the fit of regression models,
and is to regression what AUC is to classification.
It should be noted, though, that their C score is a

fit, i.e. a test on the training data, whereas we test
un unseen data only.3 If memory-based learning
is applied to classify its training data, its score is
trivally 100%, as it memorizes all training exem-
plars.4

It is also possible to reverse the roles in the
training and testing regimen, and test the predic-
tive value of children’s datives on caregiver da-
tives. This experiment would show how well an
child’s speech approximates that of adults. Fig-
ure 4 displays learning curves (AUC scores) when
training on increasing amounts of datives pro-
duced by Adam and Nina, tested on the caregiver
speech of other children. The score starts out low,
then increases, peaks (with both children) and then
slowly decreases in the case of Adam.

To put the outcomes of these two learning
curves in perspective, Table 4 compares their ag-
gregrate score against a control experiment. The
second column of Table 4 lists the end points of
the aggregrate learning curves displayed in Fig-

3After reporting on the C score, de Marneffe et al. (2012)
note that they do not know whether their model overfits. They
then introduce a new experiment on two new children and
datives with three verbs: give, show, and a new verb bring,
and split the data into a 90% training set and 10% test set.
On all three verbs they report a classification accuracy (not
AUC, unfortunately) on the test set of 91.2% against a major-
ity baseline of 68.4%. On the new verb bring the accuracy is
72.9%.

4Classification accuracy when testing on the training set
may be lower than 100% when identical training exemplars
exist with different dative choice labels.

Training on Adam’s datives, of which we have
a higher number (221) than of Nina (146), we see
at the end of the learning curve that datives in
the child-directed speech of other children are pre-
dicted less accurately (0.76) than when training on
Nina’s datives (0.85). As the third column shows,
the different caregiver input directed at the two
children, when used as training data, does not dif-
fer notably in the approximation of child-directed
speech directed at other children; more interest-
ingly, we see that the AUC yielded by training
on Nina’s data (0.85) is about as high as train-
ing and testing on child-directed speech data (0.84
and 0.86). In other words, Nina’s output is slightly
harder to predict than Adam’s (cf. Table 3), but it
approximates adult caregiver output better.

6 Discussion

In this contribution we explored the notion of
building a predictive computational, exemplar-
based model for individual children. Despite the
fact that we were only able to work with a lim-
ited number of children for which sufficient data
was available, we believe we have delivered a
proof of concept: we can model individual learn-

ing curves, and when sufficient data is available,
the results indicate that models trained on this data
have competing generalization performance to ag-
gregate models trained on data from multiple indi-
viduals.

What is more, our results indicate that training
on other children does not produce the best pre-
dictive models. Training on child-directed speech,
however, does lead to the overall best general-
ization performances. This partially confirms De
Marneffe et al.’s conclusions. Although we used
the same data, we cannot directly compare to this
work because, as noted before, De Marneffe et al.
fit their models on the training data, whereas we
test on unseen data not included in training.

We estimated to what extent the data from the
children for which we had sufficient data, Adam
and Nina, could be used as training data to pre-
dict caregiver datives. The comparisons produce
slightly different results. Comparing Tables 3
and 4, we observe that Nina’s dative choices are
harder to predict than Adam’s, but they approxi-
mate adult caregiver dative choices better. A com-
parative study of Nina’s and Adam’s productions
may explain this difference, but goes beyond the
scope of this paper. We restrict ourselves to noting
that we observe more varied predictors in Nina’s
output than in Adam’s, that she uses significantly
more pronouns, and that the variance in the length
of the themes used by Nina is significantly greater
than Adam’s.

Overall, both Adam’s and Nina’s datives can be
said to approximate and predict caregiver datives
about as accurately as adult data does.

7 Conclusion

Our case study shows that the computational mod-
elling of a language acquisition phenomenon at
the level of the individual is possible. The re-
sults indicate that models trained on individual
data have competing generalization performance
to aggregate models trained on data from multi-
ple individuals. For two children, sufficient data
was available to show that training a memory-
based model on their own data produced about as
accurate predictions as training on child-directed
speech, which de Marneffe et al. (2012) had shown
before, but with data aggregated over children.

We argue that memory-based learning is a suit-
able method for this type of micro-modelling. It
can work with very small amounts of training data,
and it can learn incrementally. In contrast, most
non-local regression methods and supervised ma-
chine learning methods require complete retrain-
ing when training data changes (e.g. when new
examples come in). Furthermore, as an imple-
mentation of exemplar-based reasoning it offers a
computational, objectively testable, reproducible,
and arguably cognitively plausible (Van den Bosch
and Daelemans, 2013) exemplar-based account of
language acquisition and processing (Jäkel et al.,
2009).

This proof-of-concept case study suggests sev-
eral strands of future work. First, different syntac-
tic alternations could be studied in the same way
based on the same data, such as the genitive al-
ternation in English. Second, our present study
copied the features of de Marneffe et al. (2012),
but there is some evidence from studies on adult
data that the dative alternation can also be pre-
dicted with memory-based learning on lexical sur-
face features (words) only (Theijssen, 2012). It
would be interesting to repeat this study only with
the Theme and Recipient surface lexical features.

As a more general goal, we hope to arrive at
a new framework for modeling language produc-
tion processes in which we can address existing
research questions at the individual level, so that
we can start to address the contrast between idi-
olectal data and aggregated data—an issue that has
so far been largely theoretical and has been rarely
addressed empirically (Louwerse, 2004; Mollin,
2009; Stoop and Van den Bosch, 2014).
