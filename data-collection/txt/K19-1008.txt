Abstract

Computational research on error detection
in second language speakers has mainly ad-
dressed clear grammatical anomalies typical to
learners at the beginner-to-intermediate level.
We focus instead on acquisition of subtle se-
mantic nuances of English indefinite pronouns
by non-native speakers at varying levels of
proficiency. We first lay out theoretical, lin-
guistically motivated hypotheses, and support-
ing empirical evidence on the nature of the
challenges posed by indefinite pronouns to En-
glish learners. We then suggest and evaluate an
automatic approach for detection of atypical
usage patterns, demonstrating that deep learn-
ing architectures are promising for this task in-
volving nuanced semantic anomalies.

1 Introduction

The ubiquity of English as an online lingua franca
offers a rich opportunity for computational re-
search on second language acquisition and on
tools for aiding non-native speakers. Most com-
putational research in second language (L2) has
focused on spelling and grammar errors, and
has been conducted on learners with beginner-to-
intermediate proficiency level (henceforth, “learn-
ers”) (e.g. Ji et al., 2017; Sakaguchi et al., 2017;
Rozovskaya et al., 2017; Lo et al., 2018). Lit-
tle empirical work has looked at semantic errors,
with existing research mostly focusing on colloca-
tions (e.g., Dahlmeier and Ng, 2011; Vecchi et al.,
2011; Kochmar and Briscoe, 2013). Also, highly
proficient, advanced L2 speakers (henceforth, “ad-
vanced L2s”) have received little attention (though
see Daudaravicius et al., 2016). In contrast to
learners, these speakers rarely violate grammati-
cal norms of the L2, but rather deviate from native
usage in much more nuanced ways, often exhibit-
ing mild infelicities rather than outright errors.

We aim to explore an elusive aspect of master-
ing the subtle contours of a word’s meaning that
are shaped by its context. Specifically, we in-
vestigate patterns of acquisition of English indefi-
nite pronouns by L2 speakers. Indefinite pronouns
(IPs) are linguistic devices that refer to an entity
(such as a person or thing) that has not yet been
introduced in discourse. In English, examples are
words like someone, anything, and nobody. Con-
sider the following sentences, taken verbatim from
corpora of L2 speakers (original pronoun is bold-
faced; less felicitous usages marked with ‘?’).1

1. Do you know someone/anyone who was dis-
criminated based on gender?

2. It was a little amazing, because they didn’t stole
?something/anything.

3. ??Anyone/Someone told me the company has
millions in debts and isn’t able to pay it.

Clearly, mastery of IPs in English relies on recog-
nizing subtle factors that determine their appropri-
ate usage in various contexts.

Here, in Section 2, we develop a linguistic anal-
ysis with detailed hypotheses on precisely how
the tangled relations between some- and any- pro-
nouns, exemplified above, pose a challenge for L2
learners. In Sections 3 and 4, we perform a large-
scale investigation of these linguistic predictions
using productions of both learners and advanced
L2s, and find that the predicted infelicities occur
not only in the language of the former but also the
latter, albeit (as expected) to a lesser extent.

A practical goal of this work is to gain predic-
tive power regarding the nuanced semantic diffi-
culties that L2 speakers face. As a first step in that
direction, in Section 5 we consider the ability of
deep learning language models (LMs) – shown to
be adept at capturing grammatical phenomena (Ji

1We refer to either less preferred or unacceptable occur-
rences of an IP, as in (2) and (3), as infelicitous usages.

Linzen, 2018; Goldberg, 2019) – to identify the
subtle infelicities that stem from the semantic con-
fusion introduced by some- and any- IPs. We show
that while state-of-the-art models obtain encour-
aging initial results on this task, they leave room
for future improvement (possibly informed by our
linguistic findings) in mastering the semantic nu-
ances of the system of English IPs.

The contribution of this work is thus three-fold:
First, to our knowledge, we develop the first large-
scale empirical investigation of second-language
acquisition of indefinite pronouns, constituting a
case study of taking a computational approach in
linguistic analysis to yield novel insights into chal-
lenges in L2 acquisition. Second, we suggest and
evaluate an automatic approach to detect infelic-
ities stemming from these challenges in a large
collection of L2 productions. Finally, in both
cases, we extend our experiments to utterances of
highly proficient L2 speakers – a population that
has heretofore received little attention in the con-
text of automatic error/infelicity detection.2

2 Linguistic Insights into English IPs

Previous work has suggested that the English sys-
tem of IPs is crosslinguistically atypical, with pre-
cise analogues to some- and any- unusual across
languages (Haspelmath, 1997; Beekhuizen et al.,
2017). Building on a suggestion from Beekhuizen
et al. (2017), we analyze the factors that could lead
to difficulty in learning these IPs, and develop de-
tailed hypotheses concerning the challenges that
L2 speakers are predicted to face.

Our analysis is based on patterns of colexifica-
tion (Franois, 2008): that is, how usages express-
ing different semantics are grouped (or not) in var-
ious combinations under a single word. As the ba-
sis for our analysis, we first need to specify the

2All code and data are available at https://github.
com/ellarabi/indefinite-pronouns

allowable semantic and syntactic usages of IPs.
These usage classes are adapted from Haspelmath
(1997), who outlines a universal set of IP semantic
functions across all languages.3 Our usage classes
are shown in Table 1, with an indication of the
classes that some- and any- can express.

Table 1 illustrates a striking fact about colexifi-
cation of the usage classes in English: some- and
any- each cover a very broad range of classes, with
a high degree of overlap. This level of overlap in
languages appears to be very rare: in the 40 lan-
guages studied by Haspelmath (1997), we find that
only some 10% of languages have IPs that overlap
over such a broad area of the semantic space.4

Within any of these classes, some seman-
tic/syntactic contexts call for just one of some- or
any-, while others allow both, but with differing
meanings (and frequencies/preferences). For ex-
ample, these similar contexts allow both, but the
preferred pronoun differs:

1. ...people care a lot if something is a repost...

2. ...before you know if anything is wrong...

We thus predict a difficulty for English L2 speak-
ers in having to choose between two (not inter-
changeable) terms that can be used in highly sim-
ilar semantic/syntactic environments.

In addition to looking at difficulties posed by
the colexification of IPs within English, we can
consider crosslinguistic patterns of colexification
for further insight. Semantic typologists have pro-
posed (and empirically supported, across many
domains) that the more two underlying concepts
are colexified across languages, the more similar
those two concepts are (e.g., Anderson, 1982). In

3Haspelmath’s functions are determined by syntactic, se-
mantic, and pragmatic factors. Our usage classes emphasize
the syntactic context, for ease of automatic identification and
consistent annotation.

functions, therefore, not strictly comparable to the slightly
different notation of usage classes in this work.

Figure 1: Layout of usage classes in crosslinguistic semantic
space; light blue illustrates the scope of English any-, pink
illustrates the natural grouping of QU/CD with SP/NS.

this way, crosslinguistic patterns of colexification
can be used to deduce pairwise similarity among
concepts, yielding a universal semantic similarity
space for a domain (e.g., Berlin and Kay, 1969;
Levinson et al., 2003).

Here, we derive such a similarity space over the
IP usage classes of Table 1, using the colexifica-
tion data across 40 languages, from Haspelmath
(1997).5 We form a distance matrix (found in sup-
plemental materials, A.1) by recording, for every
pair of usage classes, the number of languages that
have a term subsuming both those classes (indi-
cating their relative similarity). We then use Mul-
tidimensional Scaling (MDS) to project the space
onto two dimensions, as exemplified in Figure 1.6

Figure 1 demonstrates, first, that SP, FC, and
DN form three natural “extremes” of the semantic
space. In English, these correspond to the canon-
ical uses of the IPs some-, any-, and no-, respec-
tively; thus some- is anchored at SP and any- at
FC (cf. Table 1). Moreover, we find that the usage
classes of QU and CD are very close to SP and NS,
indicating that QU and CD are most frequently
colexified with SP/NS, in particular, much more
so than with FC. For English, this means that it is
much more natural for some- to express QU/CD
than for any- to do so.

To summarize, our linguistic analysis reveals
two potential challenges of English some- and
any-: their confusability across many classes, and
the particular difficulty of any- in the QU/CD
classes. We further find empirically that some-
IPs are more frequent than any- in native English

5For this, we map our classes to Haspelmath’s functions.
6The relative distances slightly differ, but remain highly

similar across many such projections we produce.

text, suggesting that some- will be easier for L2
speakers, and that they may overgeneralize it when
faced with uncertainty of which pronoun to use.
Collectively, these findings motivate:

Hypothesis 1: The unusually large and overlap-
ping extents of some- and any- are expected to
pose difficulty for L2 speakers; any- is predicted to
be especially difficult due to its lower frequency.

Hypothesis 2: Due to greater naturalness of
grouping QU and CD with other classes subsumed
by some-, we predict that QU and CD usages of
any- will be particularly difficult for L2 speakers.

In exploring each of these hypotheses, we look
for evidence in two forms: overuse of some- com-
pared to native speakers, and more errors involv-
ing any-. We focus on the frequent semantic cate-
gories of people and things, specifically the set of
IPs someone, anyone, something, and anything.7

3 Materials and Methods

3.1 Datasets

We expect that mastery of IPs will depend on
a speaker’s command of English, and there-
fore consider language productions both of learn-
ers (largely beginner-to-intermediate), and of L2
speakers on Reddit (shown to be highly proficient,
almost on par with Reddit natives; Rabinovich
et al. 2018). Our learner dataset comprises sev-
eral sub-corpora: EFCAMDAT (Geertzen et al.,
2013), TOEFL11 (Blanchard et al., 2013), and
the freely available part of the FCE corpus (Yan-
nakoudakis et al., 2011). The advanced L2 dataset
includes online posts by advanced non-native En-
glish speakers from the L2-Reddit corpus (re-
leased by Rabinovich et al., 2018, and com-
prising utterances by native as well as highly-
proficient non-native speakers, published on the
Reddit platform). We extended the L2-Reddit cor-
pus (originally collected in 2017) with data pub-
lished through September 2018; the final dataset
includes over 320M native and L2 English sen-
tences. Table 2 presents details of the two corpora.

3.2 Classification of IP Usages

Evaluating our hypotheses in Section 2 depends
on assessing which usage class an utterance with
a some-/any- pronoun belongs to, so we can
compare patterns of usage and infelicities across
classes. In English, the IP usage classes are of-
ten associated with particular lexical or syntactic
cues in the clause with the IP – e.g., a negative ad-
verb for DN (I don’t want anything from this col-
lection.), or a question mark for QU (Would you
like to buy something online?). This enabled us to
develop a rule-based classifier (see supplemental
materials (A.3) for details), using a parser (Kitaev
and Klein, 2018) and a set of heuristic rules.

We evaluated the classifier on sentences man-
ually annotated by three in-house native English
speakers with a background in linguistics. A
sample of 750 sentences produced by Reddit na-
tive English speakers was selected for annotation,
and the annotators assigned a label to each sen-
tence from within the set of {DN, QU, CD, CP,
MIXED}, where the MIXED class comprises the
SP, NS, FC, and IN classes (cf. Table 1). The
MIXED grouping contains classes that are (1) dif-
ficult to distinguish using simple lexical and syn-
tactic cues (essentially, an “other” class), and (2)
predicted by our linguistic analysis to be relatively
similar in their error patterns. Average annotator
agreement on our task was κ = 0.932; detailed
annotation guidelines can be found in supplemen-
tal materials (A.2).

Table 3 shows that our rule-based classification
is a reliable way to categorize a sentence with an
IP (five-way classification baseline is 0.2). Be-
cause we use a subset of sentences associated with
each usage class throughout our experiments, we
focus on classification precision, while maintain-
ing recall. We use this classifier to automatically
label L2 sentences by usage class.

R 0.723 0.789 0.853 0.962 0.874
F1 0.775 0.833 0.853 0.893 0.861

Table 3: Evaluation of classification of IP usage classes.

3.3 Annotation of (In)felicitous Usages

We used the FigureEight crowdsourcing platform
for collecting annotations to be used as ground
truth of L2 infelicities. We extracted a randomly

sampled set of 3, 711 sentences from our learner
corpus representing a balanced distribution over
the five usage classes,8 and a similar set of 10, 000
sentences from our advanced L2 (Reddit) corpus,
each containing a usage of someone, something,
anyone, or anything.9 Each sentence was anno-
tated by five native English speakers in a choice-
based annotation scheme. The occurrence of the
IP in the sentence was replaced with a blank line,
and each annotator marked their preference for the
some- or any- pronoun in that context (or “other”),
reflecting the most natural choice between the two.
The gold annotation for each sentence was deter-
mined by its majority choice, and the confidence
score was computed based on the number of se-
lections (out of five annotators) of each of the two
pronouns. Annotation guidelines and a sample of
500 manually annotated sentences can be found in
the supplemental materials (A.4).

Table 4 presents example sentences produced
by learners and L2 Reddit authors where the ma-
jority annotation unanimously differed from the
original pronoun (as indicated). The utterances
are provided verbatim, maintaining grammatical
errors typical to productions in our corpora.

Sentences with a confidence level ≤ 0.6 are
considered close to equally felicitous with either
pronoun, while the confidence of 1 represents a
unanimous preference for one of the alternatives.
Because we used a forced-choice task, if both pro-
nouns were acceptable (e.g., Did you see some-
thing/anything you like?), we expect that the con-
fidence score will indicate the level of naturalness
or typicality of the pronoun in that context. For
this reason, we only consider an example infelici-
tous when it differs from annotator choice with a
confidence ≥ 0.8, which indicates a stronger pref-
erence for one pronoun over the other.

The final annotation results include 50% (1556)
and 77% (2857) of sentences with a confidence of
1.0 and of ≥ 0.8, respectively, for learners. Our
advanced L2 data has 56% (5639) of sentences
with a confidence of 1.0 and 81% (8079) of≥ 0.8.

A question arises as to how meaningful it is to
label an IP usage as infelicitous – i.e., the preferred
IP in annotation differed from the original – if both
some- and any- are in fact acceptable. To explore
this, we also got crowdsourced annotations on 500

in the QU and CP classes in our learner data, respectively.

taining IPs from this work; see supplemental materials (A.5).

native utterances from Reddit, and compared the
percentages of usages annotated as infelicitous to
those of 500 randomly sampled sentences by ad-
vanced L2s. We found that 3% of native utterances
were annotated as infelicitous at a confidence level
of ≥ 0.8, indicating a high agreement among na-
tive writers and our annotators, while for advanced
L2s, the percentage was around twice that high –
6.7%. Despite acceptable variation in some-/any-
usage in a given context, even advanced L2 speak-
ers differ from natives in their relative preferences.

4 Analysis of IP Infelicities in L2

4.1 Distribution of IPs by Usage Types
First, considering Hypothesis 1 from Section 2,
we expect the confusability of some- and any- to
be reflected in overgeneralization of some- due to
its higher frequency. The subtle distinction be-
tween these pronoun types is assumed to be better
mastered by advanced L2 speakers, so we expect
the divergence from the native distribution to be
amplified in learners’ productions.

Figure 2 presents relative frequencies of some-
and any- pronouns in a random sample of 5M na-
tive, advanced L2, and learner productions, both
in the entire sample (left) and distributed by us-
age class (right). In line with our predictions,
we find in Figure 2 (left) that overall, L2 speak-
ers use some- pronouns more than any- pronouns
compared to native speakers. We can further see
in Figure 2 (right), and discussed in detail below,
that this pattern occurs in almost all the IP usage
classes, especially pronounced for learners.

Elaborating on Hypothesis 1, we further sug-
gest that in addition to general overuse of some-
vs. any- (which may partly be due to avoidance
of any-), L2 speakers are also expected in their
infelicities to more often use some- where native
speakers would use any-, than vice versa. This

prediction is also supported by our annotated data:
In cases where the preferred pronoun is some-,
learners infelicitously use any- 8.4% of the time,
but in cases where the preferred pronoun is any-,
learners infelicitously use some- almost 23% of
the time. That is, learners have almost three times
as many infelicities of using some- instead of any-
than the reverse. Our advanced L2s speakers also
show more infelicities using some- instead of any-
than vice versa, but the difference is less pro-
nounced (5.8% and 10.1% respectively), as we ex-
pect given their greater proficiency.

4.2 Distribution of Infelicitous Usages

Next we turn to Hypothesis 2 from Section 2,
which further predicts that the precise extent of
deviation from native-like usage patterns will not
be distributed uniformly across the different usage
classes, but rather there will be a higher degree of
deviation in classes that are atypically grouped un-
der any- – that is, QU and CD – than in those that
introduce less of a semantic challenge (DN, CP,
and those in the MIXED class). L2 speakers are
expected to exhibit both more overuse of some-
and more infelicities in the QU and CD classes.

Our predictions regarding the non-uniform
overuse of some- are largely borne out in Figure
2: the classes expected to be most difficult for L2
speakers – QU and CD – show a significant differ-
ence not only for learners, but even for advanced
L2 speakers compared to natives, while DN and
CP show only a difference for learners.

A few observations from Figure 2 do not fol-
low our hypothesis. First, the difference in learner
usage of some- vs. any- for DN goes in the direc-
tion opposite to the prediction: i.e., learners use
any- more than some- pronouns in direct negation.
We attribute this to the sheer frequency of any-
in direct negation, such that learners are overgen-

eralizing any- here. Second, the MIXED group-
ing also shows a difference for the advanced L2
speakers, although these usages are not predicted
to be especially difficult by our linguistic analy-
sis. This class contains a very large and diverse
set of usages, making it difficult to predict what
is driving this effect, and we leave this for future
work. Finally, the largest gap in overuse of some-
vs. any- is observed in the CP class for learners,
thereby not complying with our prediction of the
highest difficulty being introduced by the QU and
CD classes. Note, however, that this result is based
on a relatively small amount of data in the CP class
for learners (only 124 sentences; see Table 5).

To consider the pattern of infelicities across the
usage classes, Table 5 shows the results from our
crowdsourced annotation of IP usages of learners
(top) and advanced L2s (bottom), separated by the
classes. As expected, learners exhibit a very high
percentage of infelicities in the QU class (24%);
the CD class is not nearly as bad (12%), but is
still higher than the other three (8–9%). Although
advanced L2s have much fewer infelicities than
learners, they also have more in the QU and CD
classes (7% and over 9% respectively) than in the
others (5–6%). Thus, as with Hypothesis 1, Hy-
pothesis 2 is largely borne out by the data, and we
find additional evidence that the IP system of En-
glish is particularly challenging for beginning to
intermediate learners.

5 Automatic Detection of Infelicities

Our motivation for the above analysis is to use
these insights to drive development of tools for L2

learners. Here we consider the first step, that of de-
tection of infelicities with a language model (LM).

Neural network based approaches are currently
among the most successful LMs. While being eas-
ily applied to a wide range of tasks, they provide
significant improvements over classic backoff n-
gram models. A common use of a pre-trained LM
– typically trained on an extremely large corpus
– is to predict the likelihood of an ‘unseen’ sam-
ple of text: The higher the score (or the lower the
perplexity) a text is assigned, the more probable it
is, given the model. In particular, a fluent, well-
formed text is likely to be scored higher by an LM
than a text containing linguistic anomalies.

Encouraged by results on the task of grammat-
ical error detection (Yuan and Briscoe, 2016; Ji
et al., 2017), we adhere to a similar approach, cast-
ing the detection of infelicities as a binary classi-
fication scenario: An LM is applied on a sentence
with an original pronoun (e.g., something) and on
the same sentence where the pronoun is substi-
tuted with its alternative (e.g., anything); then the
one predicted as more probable (scored highest) is
chosen as a model decision.

5.1 Models

Aiming to test the effect of various factors, such
as training data size and register, on the predic-
tive power of LMs in our task, we used both pre-
trained models and models trained locally on in-
domain, albeit much smaller, data.

Gulordava et al.: A successful variant of
RNNs, the long short-term memory model
(LSTM, Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997), used
for syntactic error detection in Gulordava et al.
(2018). We trained the model using a similar set of
parameters to Gulordava et al. (2018),10 on 10M
sentences by native English speakers of Reddit
(see Section 3), using a 20K sentence validation
set and a 50K sentence test set. This model allows
us to test the benefits of using in-domain data (for
advanced L2s), despite its significantly lower vol-
ume, compared to other models.

Google 1B: A very large publicly available LM
released by Jozefowicz et al. (2016). This fine-
tuned language model, trained on a billion-word
corpus (Chelba et al., 2013), requires a massive
infrastructure for training. It achieves impressive
perplexity scores on common benchmarks, and
has been shown effective on a range of NLP tasks.

BERT: A recent bidirectional encoder represen-
tations from transformers (BERT) LM released by
Google (Devlin et al., 2018). Proven highly effec-
tive in several language modeling tasks, it achieves
state-of-the-art results in syntax-sensitive scenar-
ios (Goldberg, 2019), pushing the limits of what is
feasible with current language modeling tools.

We report the models’ precision, recall and F1
scores for infelicitous and correct classes sepa-
rately. We also report the overall accuracy of each,
computed as the ratio of correctly classified cases
out of all sentences. Following the intuition laid
out in Section 3.3, we conducted two sets of exper-
iments: (1) considering cases where annotators’
confidence score was 0.8 or higher, and (2) consid-
ering cases with confidence of 1. Sentences with
a lower confidence score (i.e., where both some-
and any- were roughly equally preferred) were ex-
cluded from these experiments.

10Specifically, we used two hidden layers of 200 units per
layer, dropout rate of 0.2, batch size of 20, and initial learning
rate of 20, and trained for 40 epochs (until the validation set
perplexity converged).

5.2 Results and discussion

Tables 6 and 7 present the results for learners and
advanced L2 speakers, each split by the degree of
annotation confidence. Baseline accuracy is com-
puted as the ratio of felicitous usages (the ma-
jority class) out of all instances. The Gulordava
et al. LM yields results inferior to the baseline,
despite training on in-domain (but much smaller)
data. BERT performs best overall, and both it and
Google 1B exceed the baseline for learners, but
BERT performs only at baseline for advanced L2s,
confirming the extreme difficulty of this task. Re-
sults obtained for the correct class are far superior
to those for the infelicitous class, suggestive of the
inherent difficulty of the latter cases, compared to
(occasionally clear-cut) correct usage patterns.

Systematically higher scores obtained for
learner utterances (Table 6), compared to ad-
vanced L2s (Table 7), imply that the mild infe-
licities of the latter pose a higher challenge to
automatic tools. That is, not only do advanced
L2s show fewer errors, but their errors are likely
more subtle and more difficult to detect. The high-
confidence setup (= 1.0) yields results superior
to those produced by the lower-confidence setup
(≥ 0.8), further supporting that clear-cut infelici-
ties are more easily captured by an LM.

Returning to our linguistic predictions, the pref-
erence of some- over any- predicted by Hypoth-
esis 1 and shown for non-native speakers (Sec-
tion 4.1) does not hold for our best-performing
LM. We found a roughly equal rate (up to two per-
cent points) of infelicities in model preferences in
cases with some- vs. any- gold annotations, show-
ing that the model (unlike non-natives) does not
have greater difficulty with any- overall.

We also consider the non-uniform difficulty
of IPs across various usage cases, predicted by
Hypothesis 2 and shown for non-natives (Sec-
tion 4.2). To address this question, we test BERT
for infelicitous choices compared to annotators’
decisions: That is, for each sentence, we compare
the pronoun preferred by the model to the gold an-
notation. Table 8 presents statistics across usage
classes, for learners and advanced L2s (taken from
Table 5), as well as for BERT. The top panel refers
to learner data; the bottom panel, to advanced L2
data. While (expectedly) outperforming the two
non-native populations, the model exhibits simi-
lar distributional patterns, with more infelicities
in the CD and QU classes. The model also has

6 Related Work

Computational approaches to grammatical error
correction (GEC) in learners’ productions has
been a prolific field of research in recent years.
A standard approach to dealing with grammar and
spelling errors makes use of a machine-learning
classification paradigm; a comprehensive survey
of these methods can be found in Ng et al. (2014).
Recent advances in the field of GEC were achieved
by using neural models (Yuan and Briscoe, 2016;
Ji et al., 2017; Sakaguchi et al., 2017; Lo et al.,

2018). Most studies used a supervised setup for
selecting a correct choice (e.g., a preposition) out
of a set of multiple alternatives, rendering our ex-
perimental setup not directly comparable.

Another line of work has assessed the capability
of neural LMs to capture errors stemming from vi-
olation of syntax-sensitive dependencies (Linzen
et al., 2016; Gulordava et al., 2018; Marvin and
Linzen, 2018). The recent BERT model (Devlin
et al., 2018) has been shown to be highly effec-
tive for detection of syntactic anomalies stemming
from subject-verb disagreement (Goldberg, 2019).

Most research on L2 error correction focuses
on function words, such as prepositions and de-
terminers. Very little work has been done on
detecting and correcting incorrect usage of con-
tent words. Most has been focused on the fe-
licity of word combinations, such as identifying
disfluencies stemming from L1 paraphrases (e.g.,
eat medicine or look movies, Brooke and Hirst,
2011; Dahlmeier and Ng, 2011), or using mod-
els of compositionality to detect semantically de-
viant pairs (residential steak, Vecchi et al., 2011)
or infelicitous collocations (?big importance vs.
great importance, Kochmar and Briscoe, 2013). A
shared task on automatic evaluation of scientific
writing (Daudaravicius et al., 2016) addressed au-
tomatic detection of a variety of grammatical er-
rors (e.g., misuse of an article or punctuation) and
lexical infelicities (e.g., phrasing choices stem-



85

ming from style requirements of the genre) in sci-
entific papers, edited by a professional company.

While most closely related to the field of se-
mantic error detection, our work deals with sub-
tle linguistic choices that shape the ultimate attain-
ment of L2 in non-native speakers. Compared to
grammatical and semantic anomalies explored in
previous work, the choice of indefinite pronoun
is often guided by implicit contextual clues that
are not necessarily reflected in superficial colloca-
tional patterns, thereby posing a higher challenge
for automatic techniques.

7 Conclusion

We develop and evaluate linguistic hypotheses on
the difficulties for second language learners of the
atypical system of English indefinite pronouns.
We find that the tangled relation between some-
and any- pronouns pose challenges that are evident
in the productions of both learners and advanced
L2 speakers. This work thus demonstrates the
promise of extending computational approaches
for error-detection in L2 productions to more sub-
tle semantic usages. Moreover, our results reveal
the challenges that these subtleties can pose for
even advanced non-native speakers.

Much research in second language acquisition
establishes native language transfer as one of the
major factors that shape productions of non-native
speakers. While the work here addresses univer-
sal (i.e., native-language independent) challenges
posed to L2 speakers, a plausible assumption is
that mastery of English IPs is also affected by the
proximity of the analogous system in a speaker’s
L1. We leave this direction for future research.

We also evaluate here the ability of language
models to detect the errors arising in the use of En-
glish indefinite pronouns in L2 productions. Not
surprisingly, we find that the more clearcut errors
exhibited by learners are easier to automatically
identify than the potentially more subtle errors that
arise with advanced L2 speakers. The best per-
forming language model shows a varying match to
human patterns of difficulty, raising issues for fur-
ther research regarding the factors that influence
difficulty for both humans and language models.

The practical impact of this work will be in fa-
cilitating the development of educational applica-
tions for L2 English speakers at various levels of
proficiency. At present, most error correction and
detection tools focus on explicit spelling or gram-

mar errors. Enriching these tools with the ability
to capture subtle semantic infelicities in the usage
of IPs would advance the current state of the art in
educational applications for language learners.
