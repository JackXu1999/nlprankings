Abstract

A major challenge in paraphrase research
is the lack of parallel corpora. In this pa-
per, we present a new method to collect
large-scale sentential paraphrases from
Twitter by linking tweets through shared
URLs. The main advantage of our method
is its simplicity, as it gets rid of the classi-
fier or human in the loop needed to select
data before annotation and subsequent ap-
plication of paraphrase identification algo-
rithms in the previous work. We present
the largest human-labeled paraphrase cor-
pus to date of 51,524 sentence pairs and
the first cross-domain benchmarking for
automatic paraphrase identification. In ad-
dition, we show that more than 30,000
new sentential paraphrases can be easily
and continuously captured every month
at ∼70% precision, and demonstrate their
utility for downstream NLP tasks through
phrasal paraphrase extraction. We make
our code and data freely available.1

1 Introduction

A paraphrase is a restatement of meaning using
different expressions (Bhagat and Hovy, 2013). It
is a fundamental semantic relation in human lan-
guage, as formalized in the Meaning-Text linguis-
tic theory which defines meaning as ‘invariant of
paraphrases’ (Milićević, 2006). Researchers have
shown benefits of using paraphrases in a wide
range of applications (Madnani and Dorr, 2010),
including question answering (Fader et al., 2013),
semantic parsing (Berant and Liang, 2014), in-
formation extraction (Sekine, 2006; Zhang et al.,

2015), machine translation (Mehdizadeh Seraj
et al., 2015), textual entailment (Dagan et al.,
2006; Bjerva et al., 2014; Marelli et al., 2014; Iza-
dinia et al., 2015), vector semantics (Faruqui et al.,
2015; Wieting et al., 2015), and semantic textual
similarity (Agirre et al., 2015; Li and Srikumar,
2016). Studying paraphrases in Twitter can also
help track unfolding events (Vosoughi and Roy,
2016) or the spread of information (Bakshy et al.,
2011) on social networks.

In this paper, we address a major challenge
in paraphrase research — the lack of parallel
corpora. There are only two publicly available
datasets of naturally occurring sentential para-
phrases and non-paraphrases:2 the MSRP corpus
derived from clustered news articles (Dolan and
Brockett, 2005) and the PIT-2015 corpus from
Twitter trending topics (Xu et al., 2014, 2015).
Our goal is not only to create a new annotated
paraphrase corpus, but to identify a new data
source and method that can narrow down the
search space of paraphrases without using the
classifier-biased or human-in-the-loop data selec-
tion as in MSRP and PIT-2015. This is so that sen-
tential paraphrases can be conveniently and con-
tinuously harvested in large quantities to benefit
downstream applications.

We present an effective method to collect sen-
tential paraphrases from tweets that refer to the
same URL and contribute a new gold-standard an-
notated corpus of 51,524 sentence pairs, which is
the largest to date (Table 1). We show the differ-
ent characteristics of this new dataset contrasting
the two existing corpora through the first system-

2Meaningful non-paraphrases (pairs of sentences that
have similar wordings or topics but different meanings, and
that are not randomly or artificially generated) have been very
difficult to obtain but are very important, because they serve
as necessary distractors in training and evaluation.

atic study of paraphrase identification across mul-
tiple datasets. Our new corpus is complementary
to previous work, as the corpus contains multiple
references of both formal well-edited and informal
user-generated texts. This is also the first work
that provides a continuously growing collection,
with more than 30,000 new sentential paraphrases
per month automatically labeled at ∼70% preci-
sion. We demonstrate that up-to-date phrasal para-
phrases can then be extracted via word alignment
(see examples in Table 2). We plan to continue
collecting paraphrases using our method and re-
lease a constantly updating paraphrase resource.

2 Existing Paraphrase Corpora and
Their Limitations

To date, there exist only two publicly available
corpora of both sentential paraphrases and non-
paraphrases:

MSR Paraphrase Corpus [MSRP] (Dolan
et al., 2004; Dolan and Brockett, 2005) This cor-
pus contains 5,801 pairs of sentences from news
articles, with 4,076 for training and the remaining
1,725 for testing. It was created from clustered
news articles by using an SVM classifier (using

to their offensive nature.

features including string similarity and WordNet
synonyms) to gather likely paraphrases, then an-
notated by human on semantic equivalence. The
MSRP corpus has a known deficiency skewed to-
ward over-identification (Das and Smith, 2009),
because the “purpose was not to evaluate the po-
tential effectiveness of the classifier itself, but to
identify a reasonably large set of both positive and
plausible ‘near-miss’ negative examples” (Dolan
and Brockett, 2005). It contains a large portion of
sentence pairs with many ngrams shared in com-
mon.

Twitter Paraphrase Corpus [PIT-2015] (Xu
et al., 2014, 2015) This corpus was derived from
Twitter’s trending topic data. The training set con-
tains 13,063 sentence pairs on 400 distinct top-
ics, and the test set contains 972 sentence pairs
on 20 topics. As numerous Twitter users sponta-
neously talk about varied topics, this dataset con-
tains many lexically divergent paraphrases. How-
ever, this method requires a manual step of select-
ing topics to ensure the quality of collected para-
phrases, because many topics detected automati-
cally are either incorrect or too broad. For exam-
ple, the topic “New York” relates to tweets with a
wide range of information and cannot narrow the
search space down enough for human annotation
and the subsequent application of classification al-
gorithms.

3 Constructing the Twitter URL
Paraphrase Corpus

For paraphrase acquisition, it has been crucial to
find a simple and effective way to locate para-
phrase candidates (see related work in Section 6).
We show the efficacy of tracking URLs in Twit-
ter. This method does not rely on automatic news
clustering as in MSRP or topic detection as in PIT-
2015, but it keeps collecting good candidate para-
phrase pairs in large quantities.

Twitter News URL Corpus

#Samsung temporarily suspended production of its Galaxy #Note7 devices following reports
News hit that @Samsung is temporarily halting production of the #GalaxyNote7.

PLODING .

Table 4: A representative set of tweets linked by a URL in streaming data (generally poor readability).

3.1 Data Source: News Tweets vs. Streaming

We extracted the embedded URL in each tweet
and used Twitter’s Search API to retrieve all tweets
that contain the same URL. Some tweets use short-
ened URLs, which we resolve as full URLs. We
tracked 22 English news accounts in Twitter to
create the paraphrase corpus in this paper (see ex-
amples in Table 3). We will extend the corpus
to include other languages and domains in future
work.

As shown in Table 5, nearly all the tweets
posted by news agencies have embedded URLs.
About 51.17% of posts contain two URLs, usually
one pointing to a news article and the other to me-
dia such as a photo or video. Although close to
half of the tweets in Twitter streaming data4 con-
tain at least one URL, most of them are very hard
to read (see examples in Table 4).

Data Source tweets avg #url avg # url

Streaming Data 55.8% 0.52 per tweet

@NBCNews 1.1% 1.63 0.989

Table 5: Statistics of tweets in Twitter’s streaming
data and news account data. Many tweets contain
more than one URL because media such as photo
or video is also represented by URLs.

4We used Twitters Streaming API which provided a real-
time stream of public tweets posted on Twitter.

3.2 Filtering of Retweets

Retweeting is an important feature in Twitter.
There are two types: automatic and manual
retweets. An automatic retweet is done by click-
ing the retweet button on Twitter and is easy to
remove using the Twitter API. A manual retweet
occurs when the user creates a new tweet by copy-
ing and pasting the original tweet and possibly
adding some extras, such as hashtags, usernames
or comments. It is crucial to remove these re-
dundant tweets with minor variations, which oth-
erwise represent a significant portion of the data
(Table 6). We preprocessed the tweets using a tok-
enizer5 (Gimpel et al., 2011) and an in-house sen-
tence splitter. We then filtered out manual retweets
using a set of rules, checking if one tweet was a
sub- string of the other, or if it only differed in
punctuation, or the contents of the “twitter:title” or
“twitter:description” tag in the linked HTML file
of the news article.

Table 6 shows the effectiveness of the filter-
ing. We used PINC, a standard paraphrase met-
ric, to measure ngram-based dissimilarity (Chen
and Dolan, 2011), and Jaccard metric to measure
token-based string similarity (Jaccard, 1912). Af-
ter filtering, the dataset contains tweets with more
significant rephrasing as indicated by higher PINC
and lower Jaccard scores.

3.3 Gold Standard Corpus

To get the gold-standard paraphrase corpus, we
obtained human labels on Amazon Mechanical
Turk. We showed annotators an original sentence,
and asked them to select sentences with the same
meaning from 10 candidate sentences. For each
question, we recruited 6 annotators and paid $0.03
to each worker.6 On average, each question took
about 53 seconds to finish. For each sentence pair,
we aggregated the paraphrase and non-paraphrase
labels using the majority vote.

We constructed the largest gold standard para-
phrase corpus to date, with 42,200 tweets of 4,272
distinct URLs annotated in the training set and
9,324 tweets of 915 distinct URLs in the test
set. The training data was collected between
10/10/2016 and 11/22/2016, and testing data be-
tween 01/09/2017 and 01/19/2017. In Section 4,
we contrast the characteristics of our data against
existing paraphrase corpora.

Quality Control We evaluated the annotation
quality of each worker using Cohen’s kappa agree-
ment (Artstein and Poesio, 2008) against the ma-
jority vote of other workers. We asked the best
workers (the top 528 out of 876) to label more
data by republishing the questions done by work-
ers with low reliability (Cohen’s kappa <0.4).

Inter-Annotator Agreement In addition, we
had 300 sampled sentence pairs independently an-
notated by an expert. The annotated agreement is
0.739 by Cohen’s kappa between the expert and
the majority vote of 6 crowdsourcing workers. If
we assume the expert annotation is gold, the pre-
cision of worker vote is 0.871, the recall is 0.787,
and F1 is 0.827, similar to those of PIT-2015.

3.4 Continuous Harvesting of Sentential
Paraphrases

Since our method directly applies to raw tweets,
it can continuously extract sentential paraphrases
from Twitter. In Section 4, we show that this ap-
proach can produce a silver-standard paraphrase
corpus at about 70% precision that grows by more
than 30,000 new sentential paraphrases per month.
Section 5 presents experiments demonstrating the
utility of these automatically identified sentential
paraphrases.

6The low pricing helps to not attract spammers to this
easy-to-finish task. We gave bonus to workers based on qual-
ity and the average hourly pay for each worker is about $7.

4 Comparison of Paraphrase Corpora

Though paraphrasing has been widely studied,
supporting analyses and experiments have thus far
often only been conducted on a single dataset. In
this section, we present a comparative analysis of
our newly constructed gold-standard corpus with
two existing corpora by 1) individually examin-
ing the instances of paraphrase phenomena and
2) benchmarking a range of automatic paraphrase
identification approaches.

4.1 Paraphrase Phenomena

In order to show the differences across these three
datasets, we sampled 100 sentential paraphrases
from each training set and counted occurrences
of each phenomenon in the following categories:
Elaboration (textual pairs can differ in total infor-
mation content, such as Trump’s ex-wife Ivana and
Ivana Trump), Phrasal (alternates of phrases, such
as taking over and replaces), Spelling (spelling
variants, such as Trump and Trumpf ), Synonym
(such as said and told), Anaphora (a full noun
phrase in one sentence that corresponds to the
counterpart, such as @MarkKirk and Kirk) and
Reordering (when a word, phrase or the whole
sentence reorders, or even logically reordered,
such as Matthew Fishbein questioned him and un-
der questioning by Matthew Fishbein). We report
the average number of occurrences of each para-
phrase type per sentence pair for each corpus in
Table 7. As sentences tend to be longer in MSRP
and shorter in PIT-2015, we also normalized the
numbers by the length of sentences to be more
comparable to the URL dataset.

These three datasets exhibit distinct and com-
plementary compositions of paraphrase phenom-

per sentence MSRP PIT-2015 URL

ena. MSRP has more synonyms, because au-
thors of different news articles may use different
and rather sophisticated words. PIT-2015 con-
tains many phrasal paraphrases, probably due to
the fact that most tweets under the same trend-
ing topic are written spontaneously and indepen-
dently. Our URL dataset shows more elabora-
tion, spelling and anaphora paraphrase phenom-
ena, showing that many URL-embedded tweets
are created by users with a conscious intention to
rephrase the original news headline.

4.2 Automatic Paraphrase Identification

We provide a benchmark on paraphrase identifica-
tion to better understand various models, as well
as the characteristics of our new corpus compared
to the existing ones. We focus on binary classi-
fication of paraphrase/non-paraphrase, and report
the maximum F1 measure of any point on the
precision-recall curve.

4.2.1 Models
We chose several representative technical ap-
proaches for automatic paraphrase identification:

GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014) This is a word
representation model trained on aggregated global
word-word co-occurrence statistics from a corpus.
We used 300-dimensional word vectors trained on
Common Crawl and Twitter, summed the vectors
for each sentence, and computed the cosine simi-
larity.

LR The logistic regression (LR) model incorpo-
rates 18 features based on 1-3 gram overlaps be-
tween two sentences (s1 and s2) (Das and Smith,
2009). The features are of the form precisionn
(number of n-gram matches divided by the num-
ber of n-grams in s1), recalln (number of n-gram
matches divided by the number of n-grams in s2),
and Fn (harmonic mean of recall and precision).
The model also includes lemmatized versions of
these features.

WMF/OrMF Weighted Matrix Factorization
(WMF) (Guo and Diab, 2012) is an unsupervised
latent space model. The unobserved words are
carefully handled, which results in more robust
embeddings for short texts. Orthogonal Matrix
Factorization (OrMF) (Guo et al., 2014) is the
extension of WMF, with an additional objective
to obtain nearly orthogonal dimensions in matrix
factorization to discount redundant information.

(a) Twitter URL (b) PIT-2015 (c) MSRP

Figure 1: Comparison of ngram dissimilarity (PINC score) in sentential paraphrases across three corpora.
The MSRP contains sentential paraphrases with more ngram overlaps (low PINC). Our URL corpus and
PIT-2015 contain more lexically divergent paraphrases (high PINC).

Specifically, for the (vec) version, vectors of a pair
of sentences ~v1 and ~v2 are converted into one fea-
ture vector, [~v1 + ~v2, |~v1 − ~v2|], by concatenating
the element-wise sum ~v1 + ~v2 and absolute differ-
ence |~v1 − ~v2|. We also provide the (sim) varia-
tion, which directly uses the single cosine similar-
ity score between two sentence vectors.

LEX-WMF/LEX-OrMF This is an open-
sourced adaptation (Xu et al., 2014) of LEXDIS-
CRIM (Ji and Eisenstein, 2013) that have
shown comparable performance. It combines
WMF/OrMF with n-gram overlapping features to
train a LR classifier.

MultiP MultiP (Xu et al., 2014) is a multi-
instance learning model suited for short messages
on Twitter. The at-least-one-anchor assumption in
this model looks for two sentences that have a top-
ical phrase in common, plus at least one pair of an-
chor words that carry a similar key meaning. This
model achieved the best performance in the PIT-
2015 (Xu et al., 2014) dataset.

DeepPairwiseWord He et al. (2016) developed
a deep neural network model that focuses on im-
portant pairwise word interactions across input
sentences. This model innovates in proposing a
similarity focus layer and a 19-layer very deep
convolutional neural network to guide model at-
tention to important word pairs. It has shown state-
of-the-art performance on several textual similar-
ity measurement datasets.

4.2.2 Model Performance and Dataset
Difference

The results on three benchmark paraphrase cor-
pora are shown in Table 8, 9 and 10. The ran-
dom baseline reflects that close to 80% sentence

pairs are paraphrases in the MSPR corpus. This is
atypical in the real-world text data and may cause
falsely positive predictions.

Both the edit distance and the LR models ex-
ploit surface word features. In particular, the LR
model that uses lemmatization and ngram overlap
features achieves very competitive performance
on all datasets. Figure 1 shows a closer look
at ngram differences across datasets measured by
the PINC metric (Chen and Dolan, 2011), which
is the opposite of BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002).
MSRP consists of paraphrases with more ngram
overlap (lower PINC), while PIT-2015 contains
shorter and more lexically dissimilar sentences.
Our new URL corpus is in between the two, and
is more similar to PIT-2015. It includes user’s in-
tentional rephrasing of an original tweet from a
news agency with some words untouched, as well
as some dramatic paraphrases that are challenging
for any automatic identification methods, such as
CO2 levels mark ‘new era’ in the world’s chang-
ing climate and CO2 levels haven’t been this high
for 3 to 5 million years.

MultiP exploits a restrictive constraint that the
candidate sentence pairs share a same topical
phrase. It achieves the best performance on PIT-
2015, which naturally contains such phrases. For
MSRP and URL datasets, we uses the named en-
tity tagged with the longest span as an approxima-
tion of a shared topic phrase and thus suffered a
performance drop.

Both Glove and WMT/OrMF utilize the under-
lying co-occurrence statistics of the text corpus.
WMT/OrMF use global matrix factorization to
project sentences into lower dimension and show
great advantages on measuring sentence-level se-
mantic similarities over Glove, which focuses on

word representations. Figure 2 shows that the fine-
grained distribution of the OrMF-based cosine
similarities and that the URL-linked Twitter data
works well with OrMF to yield sentential para-
phrases. Once combined with ngram overlap fea-
tures, LEX-WMF and LEX-OrMF show consis-
tently high performance across different datasets,
close to the more complicated DeepPairwiseWord.
The similarity focus mechanism on important pair-
wise word interactions in DeepPairwiseWord is
more helpful for the two Twitter datasets, due to
the fact that they contain lexically divergent para-
phrases while MSRP has an artificial bias toward
sentences with high n-gram overlap.

5 Extracting Phrasal Paraphrases

We can apply paraphrase identification models
trained on our gold standard corpus to unlabeled
Twitter data and continuously harvest sentential
paraphrases in large quantities. We used the open-
sourced LEX-OrMF model and obtained 114,025
sentential paraphrases (system predicted probabil-
ity ≥ 0.5 and average precision = 69.08%) from
raw 1% free Twitter data between 10/10/2016 and
01/10/2017. To demonstrate the utility, we show
that we can extract up-to-date lexical and phrasal
paraphrases from this data.

5.1 Phrase Extraction and Ranking

One of the most successful ideas to obtain lexi-
cal and phrasal paraphrases in large quantities is
through word alignment, then ranking for better
quality. This approach was proposed by Bannard
(Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005) and previ-
ously applied to bilingual parallel data to create
PPDB (Ganitkevitch et al., 2013; Pavlick et al.,
2015). There has been little previous work utiliz-
ing monolingual parallel data to learn paraphrases
since it is not as naturally available as bitexts.

We used the GIZA++ word aligner in the Moses
machine translation toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007)
and extracted 245,686 phrasal paraphrases. Some
examples are shown in Table 2. We additionally
explored two supervised monolingual aligners: Ja-
cana aligner (Yao et al., 2013) and Md Sultan’s
aligner (Sultan et al., 2014). We ranked the phrase
pairs using four different scores:

• Language Model Score Let w−2w−1pw1w2
be the context of the phrase p. We consid-
ered a phrase p′ to be a good substitute for
p if w−2w−1p′w1w2 is a likely sequence ac-
cording to a language model (Heafield, 2011)
trained on Twitter data.

• Translation Score Moses provides transla-
tion probabilities ϕ(p|p′).
• Glove Score We used Glove (Penning-

ton et al., 2014) pretrained 100-dimensional
Twitter word vectors and cosine similarity.

• Our Score We trained a supervised SVM re-
gression model using 500 phrase pairs with
human ratings. We used the language model,
translation, and glove scores as features, and
additionally used the inverse phrase trans-
lation probability ϕ(p′|p), lexical weighting
lex(p|p′), and lex(p′|p) from Moses.

Figure 3 compares the different ranking meth-
ods against the human judgments on 200 phrase
pairs randomly sampled from GIZA++.

5.2 Paraphrase Quality Evaluation

We compared the quality of paraphrases extracted
by our method with the closest previous work
(BUCC-2013) (Xu et al., 2013), in which a sim-
ilar phrase table was created using Moses from
monolingual parallel tweets that contain the same
named entity and calendar date. We randomly

(ρ = 0.5720)

sampled 500 phrase pairs from each phrase ta-
ble and collected human judgements on a 5-
point Likert scale, as described in Callison-Burch
(Callison-Burch, 2008). Table 11 shows the eval-
uation results. We focused on the highest-quality
paraphrases that rated as 5 (“all of the meaning
of the original phrase is retained, and nothing is
added”) and their presence among all extracted
paraphrases sorted by ranking scores.

We were also interested in how these phrasal
paraphrases compared with those in PPDB. We
sampled an equal amount of 420 paraphrase pairs
from our phrase tables and PPDB, and then
checked what percentage out of the total 840 could
be found in our phrase tables and PPDB, respec-
tively. As shown in Table 12, there is little overlap
between URL data and PPDB, only 1.3% (51.3-
50%) plus 0.8% (50.8-50%). Our Twitter URL
data complements well with the existing para-
phrase resources, such as PPDB, which are pri-
marily derived from well-edited texts.

6 Related Work

Sentential Paraphrase Data Researchers have
found several data sources from which to collect
sentential paraphrases: multiple news agencies
reporting the same event (MSRP) (Dolan et al.,
2004; Dolan and Brockett, 2005), multiple trans-

lated versions of a foreign novel (Barzilay and
Elhadad, 2003; Barzilay and Lee, 2003) or other
texts (Cohn et al., 2008), multiple definitions of
the same concept (Hashimoto et al., 2011), de-
scriptions of the same video clip from multiple
workers (Chen and Dolan, 2011) or rephrased sen-
tences (Burrows et al., 2013; Toutanova et al.,
2016). However, all these data collection methods
are incapable of obtaining sentential paraphrases
on a large scale (i.e. limited number of news agen-
cies or books with multiple translated versions),
and/or lack meaningful negative examples. Both
of these properties are crucial for developing ma-
chine learning models that identify paraphrases
and measure semantic similarities.

Non-sentential Paraphrase Data There are
other phrasal and syntactic paraphrase data, such
as DIRT (Lin and Pantel, 2001), POLY (Grycner
et al., 2016), PATTY (Nakashole et al., 2012), DE-
FIE (Bovi et al., 2015), and PPDB (Ganitkevitch
et al., 2013; Pavlick et al., 2015). Most of these
works focus on news or web data. Other earlier
works on Twitter paraphrase extraction used unsu-
pervised approaches (Xu et al., 2013; Wang et al.,
2013) or small datasets (Zanzotto et al., 2011; An-
toniak et al., 2015).

7 Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper, we show how a simple method can
effectively and continuously collect large-scale

1231



sentential paraphrases from Twitter. We rigor-
ously evaluated our data with automatic identifi-
cation classification models and various measure-
ments. We will share our new dataset with the
research community; this dataset includes 51,524
sentence pairs manually labeled and a monthly
growth of 30,000 sentential paraphrases automati-
cally labeled. Future work could include expand-
ing into many different languages present in social
media and developing language-independent auto-
matic paraphrase identification models.
