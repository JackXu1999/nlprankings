An introduction first...

• JNCL-NCLIS
• Founded 1974 by ACTFL, AATF, AATG, AATI, AATSEEL, AATSP, ATJ, MLA, NCLG, 

NMFLTA, TESOL

• Works to develop policy recommendations (JNCL) and advocate for them to 
the US Government and business community (NCLIS)

• 140+ member organizations

• Exec. Dir., Dr. Rivers, served as founding chair of ASTM F43, 2011-
2017

Industry Consensus Standards

• Voluntary

• Negotiated to consensus among stakeholders

• Providers

• Purchasers

• Regulators & researchers

• Consensus ≠ unanimity, BUT

• Due process is guaranteed

• Started with steel (1898); quality management and services added in the past ~35 
years

What is ASTM? ISO?

• ASTM: formerly the American Society for Testing and Materials

• Founded in 1898

• outgrowth of early efforts at industry consensus standards

• Oldest international standards development body

• Based in US but international in scope

• Membership open to all; individual and organizational members

• International Standards Organisation:

• Established 1947

• International NGO

• Membership is at the national level (ANSI, BSI, Standards Canada)

Types of Standards for T & I

• ASTM
– Standard Practice: Can be

• Referenced in a contract, audited by one or another party

• Organization can be certified to a Standard Practice by a third 
party, irrespective of a specific contract/project

– Standard Guide:
• Serves as information on “best practices”

• Organizations may indicate that the adhere to a Standard Guide

• Cannot be certified 

• ISO: 
– International Standard: All ISs are certifiable at the 

organizational level, by third party certifying bodies

61

Proceedings of AMTA 2018 Workshop: The Role of Authoritative Standards in the MT Environment Boston, March 17 - 21, 2018



Current Standards
• ASTM

• Under the jurisdiction of ASTM F43 on Language Services and 
Products

– ASTM F2575-14, Standard Guide for Quality Assurance in Translation
– ASTM WK54884, Standard Practice for Linguistic Quality Assessment 

Framework

• ISO: Under the jurisdiction of ISO TC 37, Committee on Language and 
Terminology, SC 5 on Translation and Interpreting

– International Standard: ISO 17100:2015, Translation Services: 
Requirements for Translation Services

– International Standard: ISO 18587:2017, Translation Services — Post-
editing of Machine Translation Output — Requirements

ASTM F2575 Standard Practice for 
Language Translation

Important issues:

▪ Definition of translation
▪ Indicators of translator competence
▪ Other participants in process
▪ Translation technology
▪ Services related to translation
▪ Post-project review

ASTM WK54884, Standard Practice for 
Linguistic Quality Assessment
• Establishes a practice for graduated, holistic rating of quality of translation

• Four categories:

• Readability (P/F)

• Accuracy

• Linguistic conformity

• Absence of fatal errors

• Error typology-agnostic

• Crowd-sourced, subjective, and statistically analyzed 

• Expert or non-expert 

• Major clients using this now (Fortune 100; ACA en español)

65

Proceedings of AMTA 2018 Workshop: The Role of Authoritative Standards in the MT Environment Boston, March 17 - 21, 2018



Common principles

• ASTM F2575 & ISO standards seek to assure quality through 
standardization of the delivery of the service
• Personnel qualifications

• Project specifications

• Agreed-upon delivery and satisfaction criteria

• Anomaly reporting & correction

• ASTM WK54884 seeks to standardize the assessment of translation 
output

66

Proceedings of AMTA 2018 Workshop: The Role of Authoritative Standards in the MT Environment Boston, March 17 - 21, 2018



Ok, but some of the Standard won’t 
work for our situation

• In general: exceptions to the standard must be 
documented and justified:
– E.g., personnel qualifications in low-density languages

• Systematic/organizational vs. specific/situational 
exceptions 

• Longer term: work on improving the standard
– Join ASTM F43 (open to all)

– Let the US Technical Advisory Group to ISO TC37 know 
what needs work
