Abstract

In this paper, we propose a novel embedding
model, named ConvKB, for knowledge base
completion. Our model ConvKB advances
state-of-the-art models by employing a convo-
lutional neural network, so that it can capture
global relationships and transitional character-
istics between entities and relations in knowl-
edge bases. In ConvKB, each triple (head en-
tity, relation, tail entity) is represented as a 3-
column matrix where each column vector rep-
resents a triple element. This 3-column matrix
is then fed to a convolution layer where multi-
ple filters are operated on the matrix to gener-
ate different feature maps. These feature maps
are then concatenated into a single feature vec-
tor representing the input triple. The feature
vector is multiplied with a weight vector via
a dot product to return a score. This score
is then used to predict whether the triple is
valid or not. Experiments show that ConvKB
achieves better link prediction performance
than previous state-of-the-art embedding mod-
els on two benchmark datasets WN18RR and
FB15k-237.

1 Introduction

Large-scale knowledge bases (KBs), such as
YAGO (Suchanek et al., 2007), Freebase (Bol-
lacker et al., 2008) and DBpedia (Lehmann et al.,
2015), are usually databases of triples represent-
ing the relationships between entities in the form
of fact (head entity, relation, tail entity) denoted as
(h, r, t), e.g., (Melbourne, cityOf, Australia). These
KBs are useful resources in many applications
such as semantic searching and ranking (Kasneci
et al., 2008; Schuhmacher and Ponzetto, 2014;
Xiong et al., 2017), question answering (Zhang
et al., 2016; Hao et al., 2017) and machine reading
(Yang and Mitchell, 2017). However, the KBs are

still incomplete, i.e., missing a lot of valid triples
(Socher et al., 2013; West et al., 2014). There-
fore, much research work has been devoted to-
wards knowledge base completion or link predic-
tion to predict whether a triple (h, r, t) is valid or
not (Bordes et al., 2011).

Many embedding models have proposed to
learn vector or matrix representations for entities
and relations, obtaining state-of-the-art (SOTA)
link prediction results (Nickel et al., 2016a).
In these embedding models, valid triples obtain
lower implausibility scores than invalid triples.
Let us take the well-known embedding model
TransE (Bordes et al., 2013) as an example. In
TransE, entities and relations are represented by k-
dimensional vector embeddings. TransE employs
a transitional characteristic to model relationships
between entities, in which it assumes that if (h, r, t)
is a valid fact, the embedding of head entity h plus
the embedding of relation r should be close to the
embedding of tail entity t, i.e. vh + vr ≈ vt (here,
vh, vr and vt are embeddings of h, r and t respec-
tively). That is, a TransE score ‖vh + vr − vt‖p
of the valid triple (h, r, t) should be close to 0 and
smaller than a score ‖vh′ + vr′ − vt′‖p of an in-
valid triple (h’, r’, t’). The transitional characteris-
tic in TransE also implies the global relationships
among same dimensional entries of vh, vr and vt.

Other transition-based models extend TransE to
additionally use projection vectors or matrices to
translate head and tail embeddings into the rela-
tion vector space, such as: TransH (Wang et al.,
2014), TransR (Lin et al., 2015b), TransD (Ji
et al., 2015), STransE (Nguyen et al., 2016b) and
TranSparse (Ji et al., 2016). Furthermore, DIST-
MULT (Yang et al., 2015) and ComplEx (Trouil-
lon et al., 2016) use a tri-linear dot product to com-
pute the score for each triple. Recent research

has shown that using relation paths between en-
tities in the KBs could help to get contextual in-
formation for improving KB completion perfor-
mance (Lin et al., 2015a; Luo et al., 2015; Guu
et al., 2015; Toutanova et al., 2016; Nguyen et al.,
2016a). See other embedding models for KB com-
pletion in Nguyen (2017).

Recently, convolutional neural networks
(CNNs), originally designed for computer vision
(LeCun et al., 1998), have significantly received
research attention in natural language processing
(Collobert et al., 2011; Kim, 2014). CNN learns
non-linear features to capture complex relation-
ships with a remarkably less number of parameters
compared to fully connected neural networks.
Inspired from the success in computer vision,
Dettmers et al. (2018) proposed ConvE—the first
model applying CNN for the KB completion task.
In ConvE, only vh and vr are reshaped and then
concatenated into an input matrix which is fed to
the convolution layer. Different filters of the same
3 × 3 shape are operated over the input matrix
to output feature map tensors. These feature
map tensors are then vectorized and mapped into
a vector via a linear transformation. Then this
vector is computed with vt via a dot product to
return a score for (h, r, t). See a formal definition
of the ConvE score function in Table 1. It is
worth noting that ConvE focuses on the local
relationships among different dimensional entries
in each of vh or vr, i.e., ConvE does not observe
the global relationships among same dimensional
entries of an embedding triple (vh, vr, vt), so that
ConvE ignores the transitional characteristic in
transition-based models, which is one of the most
useful intuitions for the task.

In this paper, we present ConvKB—an embed-
ding model which proposes a novel use of CNN
for the KB completion task. In ConvKB, each
entity or relation is associated with an unique k-
dimensional embedding. Let vh, vr and vt denote
k-dimensional embeddings of h, r and t, respec-
tively. For each triple (h, r, t), the corresponding
triple of k-dimensional embeddings (vh, vr, vt)
is represented as a k × 3 input matrix. This in-
put matrix is fed to the convolution layer where
different filters of the same 1 × 3 shape are used
to extract the global relationships among same di-
mensional entries of the embedding triple. That
is, these filters are repeatedly operated over ev-
ery row of the input matrix to produce different

feature maps. The feature maps are concatenated
into a single feature vector which is then computed
with a weight vector via a dot product to produce
a score for the triple (h, r, t). This score is used to
infer whether the triple (h, r, t) is valid or not.

Our contributions in this paper are as follows:

• We introduce ConvKB—a novel embedding
model of entities and relationships for knowl-
edge base completion. ConvKB models the
relationships among same dimensional en-
tries of the embeddings. This implies that
ConvKB generalizes transitional characteris-
tics in transition-based embedding models.

• We evaluate ConvKB on two benchmark
datasets: WN18RR (Dettmers et al., 2018)
and FB15k-237 (Toutanova and Chen, 2015).
Experimental results show that ConvKB ob-
tains better link prediction performance than
previous SOTA embedding models. In partic-
ular, ConvKB obtains the best mean rank and
the highest Hits@10 on WN18RR, and pro-
duces the highest mean reciprocal rank and
highest Hits@10 on FB15k-237.

2 Proposed ConvKB model

A knowledge base G is a collection of valid fac-
tual triples in the form of (head entity, relation,
tail entity) denoted as (h, r, t) such that h, t ∈ E
and r ∈ R where E is a set of entities and R is a
set of relations. Embedding models aim to define a
score function f giving an implausibility score for
each triple (h, r, t) such that valid triples receive
lower scores than invalid triples. Table 1 presents
score functions in previous SOTA models.

We denote the dimensionality of embeddings by
k such that each embedding triple (vh, vr, vt) are

viewed as a matrix A = [vh,vr,vt] ∈ Rk×3. And
Ai,: ∈ R1×3 denotes the i-th row of A. Suppose
that we use a filter ω ∈ R1×3 operated on the
convolution layer. ω is not only aimed to exam-
ine the global relationships between same dimen-
sional entries of the embedding triple (vh, vr, vt),
but also to generalize the transitional characteris-
tics in the transition-based models. ω is repeatedly
operated over every row of A to finally generate a
feature map v = [v1, v2, ..., vk] ∈ Rk as:

vi = g (ω ·Ai,: + b)

where b ∈ R is a bias term and g is some activation
function such as ReLU.

Our ConvKB uses different filters ∈ R1×3 to
generate different feature maps. Let Ω and τ de-
note the set of filters and the number of filters,
respectively, i.e. τ = |Ω|, resulting in τ feature
maps. These τ feature maps are concatenated into
a single vector ∈ Rτk×1 which is then computed
with a weight vector w ∈ Rτk×1 via a dot prod-
uct to give a score for the triple (h, r, t). Figure 1
illustrates the computation process in ConvKB.

Formally, we define the ConvKB score function
f as follows:

f(h, r, t) = concat (g ([vh,vr,vt] ∗Ω)) ·w

where Ω and w are shared parameters, indepen-

dent of h, r and t; ∗ denotes a convolution opera-
tor; and concat denotes a concatenation operator.

If we only use one filter ω (i.e. using τ = 1)
with a fixed bias term b = 0 and the activa-
tion function g(x) = |x| or g(x) = x2, and fix
ω = [1, 1,−1] and w = 1 during training, Con-
vKB reduces to the plain TransE model (Bordes
et al., 2013). So our ConvKB model can be viewed
as an extension of TransE to further model global
relationships.

We use the Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba,
2014) to train ConvKB by minimizing the loss
function L (Trouillon et al., 2016) with L2 regu-
larization on the weight vector w of the model:

here G′ is a collection of invalid triples generated
by corrupting valid triples in G.

3 Experiments

3.1 Datasets

We evaluate ConvKB on two benchmark datasets:
WN18RR (Dettmers et al., 2018) and FB15k-
237 (Toutanova and Chen, 2015). WN18RR and
FB15k-237 are correspondingly subsets of two
common datasets WN18 and FB15k (Bordes et al.,
2013). As noted by Toutanova and Chen (2015),
WN18 and FB15k are easy because they contain
many reversible relations. So knowing relations
are reversible allows us to easily predict the ma-
jority of test triples, e.g. state-of-the-art results
on both WN18 and FB15k are obtained by us-
ing a simple reversal rule as shown in Dettmers
et al. (2018). Therefore, WN18RR and FB15k-
237 are created to not suffer from this reversible
relation problem in WN18 and FB15k, for which
the knowledge base completion task is more real-
istic. Table 2 presents the statistics of WN18RR
and FB15k-237.

about relation paths (KBLRN , R-GCN+ and Neural LP) or textual mentions derived from a large external corpus
(Node+LinkFeat). The best score is in bold, while the second best score is in underline.

3.2 Evaluation protocol
In the KB completion or link prediction task (Bor-
des et al., 2013), the purpose is to predict a missing
entity given a relation and another entity, i.e, infer-
ring h given (r, t) or inferring t given (h, r). The
results are calculated based on ranking the scores
produced by the score function f on test triples.

Following Bordes et al. (2013), for each valid
test triple (h, r, t), we replace either h or t by
each of other entities in E to create a set of cor-
rupted triples. We use the “Filtered” setting pro-
tocol (Bordes et al., 2013), i.e., not taking any
corrupted triples that appear in the KB into ac-
counts. We rank the valid test triple and corrupted
triples in ascending order of their scores. We em-
ploy three common evaluation metrics: mean rank
(MR), mean reciprocal rank (MRR), and Hits@10
(i.e., the proportion of the valid test triples ranking
in top 10 predictions). Lower MR, higher MRR or
higher Hits@10 indicate better performance.

3.3 Training protocol
We use the common Bernoulli trick (Wang et al.,
2014; Lin et al., 2015b) to generate the head or
tail entities when sampling invalid triples. We also
use entity and relation embeddings produced by
TransE to initialize entity and relation embeddings
in ConvKB. We employ a TransE implementation
available at: https://github.com/datquocnguyen/
STransE. We train TransE using a grid search
of hyper-parameters: the dimensionality of em-
beddings k ∈ {50, 100}, SGD learning rate

∈ {1e−4, 5e−4, 1e−3, 5e−3}, l1-norm or l2-norm,
and margin γ ∈ {1, 3, 5, 7}. The highest Hits@10
scores on the validation set are when using l1-
norm, learning rate at 5e−4, γ = 5 and k = 50
for WN18RR, and using l1-norm, learning rate at
5e−4, γ = 1 and k = 100 for FB15k-237.

To learn our model parameters including en-
tity and relation embeddings, filters ω and the
weight vector w, we use Adam (Kingma and
Ba, 2014) and select its initial learning rate ∈
{5e−6, 1e−5, 5e−5, 1e−4, 5e−4}. We use ReLU
as the activation function g. We fix the batch
size at 256 and set the L2-regularizer λ at 0.001
in our objective function. The filters ω are ini-
tialized by a truncated normal distribution or by
[0.1, 0.1,−0.1]. We select the number of filters
τ ∈ {50, 100, 200, 400, 500}. We run ConvKB
up to 200 epochs and use outputs from the last
epoch for evaluation. The highest Hits@10 scores
on the validation set are obtained when using k
= 50, τ = 500, the truncated normal distribu-
tion for filter initialization, and the initial learning
rate at 1e−4 on WN18RR; and k = 100, τ = 50,
[0.1, 0.1,−0.1] for filter initialization, and the ini-
tial learning rate at 5e−6 on FB15k-237.

3.4 Main experimental results

Table 3 compares the experimental results of our
ConvKB model with previous published results,
using the same experimental setup. Table 3 shows
that ConvKB obtains the best MR and highest
Hits@10 scores on WN18RR and also the highest

330



MRR and Hits@10 scores on FB15k-237.
ConvKB does better than the closely related

model TransE on both experimental datasets, es-
pecially on FB15k-237 where ConvKB gains sig-
nificant improvements of 347 − 257 = 90 in
MR (which is about 26% relative improvement)
and 0.396 − 0.294 = 0.102 in MRR (which
is 34+% relative improvement), and also ob-
tains 51.7 − 46.5 = 5.2% absolute improve-
ment in Hits@10. Previous work shows that
TransE obtains very competitive results (Lin et al.,
2015a; Nickel et al., 2016b; Trouillon et al., 2016;
Nguyen et al., 2016a). However, when compar-
ing the CNN-based embedding model ConvE with
other models, Dettmers et al. (2018) did not exper-
iment with TransE. We reconfirm previous find-
ings that TransE in fact is a strong baseline model,
e.g., TransE obtains better MR and Hits@10 than
ConvE on WN18RR.

ConvKB obtains better scores than ConvE on
both datasets (except MRR on WN18RR and MR
on FB15k-237), thus showing the usefulness of
taking transitional characteristics into accounts. In
particular, on FB15k-237, ConvKB achieves im-
provements of 0.394 − 0.316 = 0.078 in MRR
(which is about 25% relative improvement) and
51.7 − 49.1 = 2.6% in Hits@10, while both
ConvKB and ConvE produce similar MR scores.
ConvKB also obtains 25% relatively higher MRR
score than the relation path-based model KBLRN
on FB15k-237. In addition, ConvKB gives bet-
ter Hits@10 than KBLRN , however, KBLRN gives
better MR than ConvKB. We plan to extend Con-
vKB with relation path information to obtain bet-
ter link prediction performance in future work.

4 Conclusion

In this paper, we propose a novel embedding
model ConvKB for the knowledge base comple-
tion task. ConvKB applies the convolutional neu-
ral network to explore the global relationships
among same dimensional entries of the entity and
relation embeddings, so that ConvKB generalizes
the transitional characteristics in the transition-
based embedding models. Experimental results
show that our model ConvKB outperforms other
state-of-the-art models on two benchmark datasets
WN18RR and FB15k-237. Our code is available
at: https://github.com/daiquocnguyen/ConvKB.

We also plan to extend ConvKB for a new appli-
cation where we could formulate data in the form

of triples. For example, inspired from the work
by Vu et al. (2017) for search personalization, we
can also apply ConvKB to model user-oriented re-
lationships between submitted queries and docu-
ments returned by search engines, i.e. modeling
triple representations (query, user, document).
