Abstract

Despite advances in open-domain dialogue
systems, automatic evaluation of such systems
is still a challenging problem. Traditional
reference-based metrics such as BLEU are in-
effective because there could be many valid
responses for a given context that share no
common words with reference responses. A
recent work proposed Referenced metric and
Unreferenced metric Blended Evaluation Rou-
tine (RUBER) to combine a learning-based
metric, which predicts relatedness between a
generated response and a given query, with
reference-based metric; it showed high corre-
lation with human judgments. In this paper,
we explore using contextualized word embed-
dings to compute more accurate relatedness
scores, thus better evaluation metrics. Experi-
ments show that our evaluation metrics outper-
form RUBER, which is trained on static em-
beddings.

1 Introduction

Recent advances in open-domain dialogue sys-
tems (i.e. chatbots) highlight the difficulties in
automatically evaluating them. This kind of eval-
uation inherits a characteristic challenge of NLG
evaluation - given a context, there might be a
diverse range of acceptable responses (Gatt and
Krahmer, 2018).

Metrics based on n-gram overlaps such as
BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and ROUGE (Lin,
2004), originally designed for evaluating machine
translation and summarization, have been adopted
to evaluate dialogue systems (Sordoni et al., 2015;
Li et al., 2016; Su et al., 2018). However, Liu
et al. (2016) found a weak segment-level correla-
tion between these metrics and human judgments

Dialogue Context
Speaker 1: Hey! What are you doing here?
Speaker 2: I’m just shopping.
Query: What are you shopping for?
Generated Response: Some new clothes.
Reference Response: I want buy gift for my mom!

Table 1: An example of zero BLEU score for an accept-
able generated response in multi-turn dialogue system

of response quality. As shown in Table 1, high-
quality responses can have low or even no n-gram
overlap with a reference response, showing that
these metrics are not suitable for dialogue evalu-
ation (Novikova et al., 2017; Lowe et al., 2017).

Due to the lack of strong automatic evalua-
tion metrics, many researchers resort primarily
to human evaluation for assessing their dialogue
systems performances (Shang et al., 2015; Sor-
doni et al., 2015; Shao et al., 2017). There are
two main problems with human annotation: 1)
it is time-consuming and expensive, and 2) it
does not facilitate comparisons across research pa-
pers. For certain research questions that involve
hyper-parameter tuning or architecture searches,
the amount of human annotation makes such stud-
ies infeasible (Britz et al., 2017; Melis et al.,
2018). Therefore, developing reliable automatic
evaluation metrics for open-domain dialog sys-
tems is imperative.

The Referenced metric and Unreferenced met-
ric Blended Evaluation Routine (RUBER) (Tao
et al., 2018) stands out from recent work in au-
tomatic dialogue evaluation, relying minimally
on human-annotated datasets of response quality
for training. RUBER evaluates responses with a
blending of scores from two metrics:

Figure 1: An illustration of changes applied to RUBER’s unreferenced metric’s architecture. Red dotted double
arrows show three main changes. The leftmost section is related to substituting word2vec embeddings with BERT
embeddings. The middle section replaces Bi-RNNs with simple pooling strategies to get sentence representations.
The rightmost section switches ranking loss function to MLP classifier with cross entropy loss function.

• an Unreferenced metric, which computes the
relevancy of a response to a given query in-
spired by Grice (1975)’s theory that the qual-
ity of a response is determined by its related-
ness and appropriateness, among other prop-
erties. This model is trained with negative
sampling.

• a Referenced metric, which determines the
similarities between generated and reference
responses using word embeddings.

Both metrics strongly depend on learned word em-
beddings. We propose to explore the use of con-
textualized embeddings, specifically BERT em-
beddings (Devlin et al., 2018), in composing eval-
uation metrics. Our contributions in this work are
as follows:

• We explore the efficiency of contextualized
word embeddings on training unreferenced
models for open-domain dialog system eval-
uation.

• We explore different network architectures
and objective functions to better utilize con-
textualized word embeddings, and show their
positive effects.

2 Proposed models

We conduct the research under the RUBER
metric’s referenced and unreferenced framework,
where we replace their static word embeddings
with pretrained BERT contextualized embeddings
and compare the performances. We identify three
points of variation with two options each in the

unreferenced component of RUBER. The main
changes are in the word embeddings, sentence rep-
resentation, and training objectives that will be ex-
plained with details in the following section. Our
experiment follows a 2x2x2 factorial design.

2.1 Unreferenced Metric
The unreferenced metric predicts how much a gen-
erated response is related to a given query. Fig-
ure 1 presents RUBER’s unreferenced metric over-
laid with our proposed changes in three parts of the
architecture. Changes are illustrated by red dotted
double arrows and include word embeddings, sen-
tence representation and the loss function.

2.1.1 Word Embeddings
Static and contextualized embeddings are two dif-
ferent types of word embeddings that we explored.

• Word2vec. Recent works on learnable eval-
uation metrics use simple word embeddings
such as word2vec and GLoVe as input to
their models (Tao et al., 2018; Lowe et al.,
2017; Kannan and Vinyals, 2017). Since
these static embeddings have a fixed context-
independent representation for each word,
they cannot represent the rich semantics of
words in contexts.

• BERT. Contextualized word embeddings are
recently shown to be beneficial in many NLP
tasks (Devlin et al., 2018; Radford et al.,
2018; Peters et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019). A
noticeable contextualized word embeddings,
BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), is shown to per-



84

form competitively among other contextual-
ized embeddings, thus we explore the ef-
fect of BERT embeddings on open domain
dialogue systems evaluation task. Specif-
ically, we substitute the word2vec embed-
dings with BERT embeddings in RUBER’s
unreferenced score as shown in the leftmost
section of Figure 1.

2.1.2 Sentence Representation
This section composes a single vector representa-
tion for both a query and a response.

• Bi-RNN. In the RUBER model, Bidirectional
Recurrent Neural Networks (Bi-RNNs) are
trained for this purpose.

• Pooling. We explore the effect of replacing
Bi-RNNs with some simple pooling strate-
gies on top of words BERT embeddings
(middle dotted section in Figure 1). The in-
tuition behind this is that BERT embeddings
are pre-trained on bidirectional transformers
and they include complete information about
word’s context, therefore, another layer of bi-
RNNs could just blow up the number of pa-
rameters with no real gains.

2.1.3 MLP Network
Multilayer Perceptron Network (MLP) is the last
section of RUBER’s unreferenced model that is
trained by applying negative sampling technique
to add some random responses for each query into
training dataset.

• Ranking loss. The objective is to maximize
the difference between relatedness score pre-
dicted for positive and randomly added pairs.
We refer to this objective function as a rank-
ing loss function. The sigmoid function used
in the last layer of MLP assigns a score to
each pair of query and response, which indi-
cates how much the response is related to a
given query.

• Cross entropy loss. We explore the effi-
ciency of using a simpler loss function such
as cross entropy. In fact, we consider unref-
erenced score prediction as a binary classifi-
cation problem and replace baseline trained
MLP with MLP classifier (right dotted sec-
tion in Figure 1). Since we do not have a
human labeled dataset, we use negative sam-
pling strategy to add randomly selected re-
sponses to queries in training dataset. We as-
sign label 1 to original pairs of queries and

responses and 0 to the negative samples. The
output of softmax function in the last layer of
MLP classifier indicates the relatedness score
for each pair of query and response.

2.2 Referenced Metric

The referenced metric computes the similarity be-
tween generated and reference responses. RU-
BER achieves this by applying pooling strategies
on static word embeddings to get sentence embed-
dings for both generated and reference responses.
In our metric, we replace the word2vec embed-
dings with BERT embeddings (red dotted section
in Figure 2) to explore the effect of contextualized
embeddings on calculating the referenced score.
We refer to this metric as BERT-based referenced
metric.

3 Dataset

We used the DailyDialog dataset1 which contains
high quality multi-turn conversations about daily
life including various topics (Li et al., 2017), to
train our dialogue system as well as the evalu-
ation metrics. This dataset includes almost 13k
multi-turn dialogues between two parties splitted
into 42,000/3,700/3,900 query-response pairs for
train/test/validation sets. We divided these sets
into two parts, the first part for training dialogue
system and the second part for training unrefer-
neced metric.

3.1 Generated responses

We used the first part of train/test/validation sets
with overall 20,000/1,900/1,800 query-response

pairs to train an attention-based sequence-to-
sequence (seq2seq) model (Bahdanau et al., 2014)
and generate responses for evaluation. We used
OpenNMT (Klein et al., 2017) toolkit to train the
model. The encoder and decoder are Bi-LSTMs
with 2 layers each containing 500-dimensional
hidden units. We used 300-dimensional pretrained
word2vec embeddings as our word embeddings.
The model was trained by using SGD optimizer
with learning rate of 1. We used random sample
with temperature control and set temperature value
to 0.01 empirically to get grammatical and diverse
responses.

3.2 Human Judgments

We collected human annotations on generated re-
sponses in order to compute the correlation be-
tween human judgments and automatic evaluation
metrics. Human annotations were collected from
Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT). AMT workers
were provided a set of query-response pairs and
asked to rate each pair based on the appropriate-
ness of the response for the given query on a scale
of 1-5 (not appropriate to very appropriate). Each
survey included 5 query-response pairs with an ex-
tra pair for attention checking. We removed all
pairs that were rated by workers who failed to cor-
rectly answer attention-check tests. Each pair was
annotated by 3 individual turkers. Table 2 demon-
strates three query-response pairs rated by three
AMT workers. In total 300 utterance pairs were
rated from contributions of 106 unique workers.

4 Experimental Setup

4.1 Static Embeddings

To compare how the word embeddings affect the
evaluation metric, which is the main focus of
this paper, we used word2vec as static embed-
ddings trained on about 100 billion words of
Google News Corpus. These 300 dimensional
word embeddings include almost 3 million words
and phrases. We applied these pretrained embed-

dings as input to dialogue generation, referenced
and unreferenced metrics.

4.2 Contextualized Embeddings

In order to explore the effects of contextual-
ized embedding on evaluation metrics, we used
the BERT base model with 768 vector dimen-
sions pretrained on Books Corpus and English
Wikipedia with 3,300M words (Devlin et al.,
2018).

4.3 Training Unreferenced model

We used the second part of the DailyDi-
alog dataset composed of 22,000/1,800/2,100
train/test/validation pairs to train and tune the
unreferenced model, which is implemented with
Tensorflow. For sentence encoder, we used 2
layers of bidirectional gated recurrent unit (Bi-
GRU) with 128-dimensional hidden unit. We
used three layers for MLP with 256, 512 and
128-dimensional hidden units and tanh as activa-
tion function for computing both ranking loss and
cross-entropy loss. We used Adam (Kingma and
Ba, 2015) optimizer with initial learning rate of
10−4 and applied learning rate decay when no im-
provement was observed on validation data for five
consecutive epochs. We applied early stop mecha-
nism and stopped training process after observing
20 epochs with no reduction in loss value.

5 Results

We first present the unreferenced metrics’ per-
formances. Then, we present results on the full
RUBER’s framework - combining unreferenced
and referenced metrics. To evaluate the perfor-
mance of our metrics, we calculated the Pearson
and Spearman correlations between learned met-
ric scores and human judgments on 300 query-
response pairs collected from AMT. The Pearson
coefficient measures a linear correlation between
two ordinal variables, while the Spearman coeffi-
cient measures any monotonic relationship. The

5.1 Unreferenced Metrics Results

This section analyzes the performance of unrefer-
enced metrics which are trained based on various
word embeddings, sentence representations and
objective functions. The results in the upper sec-
tion of Table 3 are all based on word2vec embed-
dings while the lower section are based on BERT
embeddings. The first row of table 3 corresponds
to RUBER’s unreferenced model and the five fol-
lowing rows are our exploration of different unref-
erenced models based on word2vec embeddings,
for fair comparison with BERT embedding-based
ones. Table 3 demonstrates that unreferenced met-
rics based on BERT embeddings have higher cor-
relation and similarity with human scores. Con-
textualized embeddings have been found to carry
richer information and the inclusion of these vec-
tors in the unreferenced metric generally leads to
better performance (Liu et al., 2019).

Comparing different sentence encoding strate-
gies (Bi-RNN v.s. Pooling) by keeping other vari-
ations constant, we observe that pooling of BERT
embeddings yields better performance. This
would be because of BERT embeddings are pre-
trained on deep bidirectional transformers and us-
ing pooling mechanisms is enough to assign rich
representations to sentences. In contrast, the
models based on word2vec embeddings benefit

from Bi-RNN based sentence encoder. Across
settings, max pooling always outperforms mean
pooling. Regarding the choice of objective func-
tions, ranking loss generally performs better for
models based on word2vec embeddings, while the
best model with BERT embeddings is obtained by
using cross-entropy loss. We consider this as an
interesting observation and leave further investi-
gation for future research.

5.2 Unreferenced + Referenced Metrics
Results

This section analyzes the performance of integrat-
ing variants of unreferenced metrics into the full
RUBER framework which is the combination of
unreferenced and referenced metrics. We only
considered the best unreferenced models from Ta-
ble 3. As it is shown in Table 4, across dif-
ferent settings, max combinations of referenced
and unereferenced metrics yields the best perfor-
mance. We see that metrics based on BERT em-
beddings have higher Pearson and Spearman cor-
relations with human scores than RUBER (the first
row of Table 4) which is based on word2vec em-
beddings.

In comparison with purely unreferenced met-
rics (Table 3), correlations decreased across the
board. This suggests that the addition of the ref-
erenced component is not beneficial, contradicting
RUBER’s findings (Tao et al., 2018). We hypothe-
size that this could be due to data and/or language
differences, and leave further investigation for fu-
ture work.

6 Related Work

Due to the impressive development of open do-
main dialogue systems, existence of automatic
evaluation metrics can be particularly desirable to
easily compare the quality of several models.

6.1 Automatic Heuristic Evaluation Metrics

In some group of language generation tasks such
as machine translation and text summarization, n-
grams overlapping metrics have a high correlation
with human evaluation. BLEU and METEOR are
primarily used for evaluating the quality of trans-
lated sentence based on computing n-gram preci-
sions and harmonic mean of precision and recall,
respectively (Papineni et al., 2002; Banerjee and
Lavie, 2005). ROUGE computes F-measure based
on the longest common subsequence and is highly
applicable for evaluating text summarization (Lin,
2004). The main drawback of mentioned n-gram
overlap metrics, which makes them inapplicable in
dialogue system evaluation is that they don’t con-
sider the semantic similarity between sentences
(Liu et al., 2016; Novikova et al., 2017; Lowe
et al., 2017). These word overlapping metrics are
not compatible with the nature of language genera-
tion, which allows a concept to be appeared in dif-
ferent sentences with no common n-grams, while
they all share the same meaning.

6.2 Automatic Learnable Evaluation Metrics

Beside the heuristic metrics, researchers recently
tried to develop some trainable metrics for au-
tomatically checking the quality of generated re-
sponses. Lowe et al. (2017) trained a hierarchi-
cal neural network model called Automatic Dia-
logue Evaluation Model (ADEM) to predict the
appropriateness score of dialogue responses. For
this purpose, they collected a training dataset by
asking human about the informativeness score for
various responses of a given context. However,

ADEM predicts highly correlated scores with hu-
man judgments in both sentence and system level,
collecting human annotation by itself is an effort-
ful and laborious task.

Kannan and Vinyals (2017) followed the GAN
model’s structure and trained a discriminator that
tries to discriminate the model’s generated re-
sponse from human responses. Even though they
found discriminator can be useful for automatic
evaluation systems, they mentioned that it can not
completely address the evaluation challenges in
dialogue systems.

RUBER is another learnable metric, which con-
siders both relevancy and similarity concepts for
evaluation process (Tao et al., 2018). Referenced
metric of RUBER measures the similarity between
vectors of generated and reference responses com-
puted by pooling word embeddings, while unref-
erenced metric uses negative sampling to train the
relevancy score of generated response to a given
query. Despite ADEM score, which is trained on
human annotated dataset, RUBER is not limited
to any human annotation. In fact, training with
negative samples makes RUBER to be more gen-
eral. It is obvious that both referenced and unref-
erenced metrics are under the influence of word
embeddings information. In this work, we show
that contextualized embeddings that include much
more information about words and their context
can have good effects on the accuracy of evalua-
tion metrics.

6.3 Static and Contextualized Words
Embeddings

Recently, there has been significant progress in
word embedding methods. Unlike previous static
word embeddings like word2vec 2, which maps
words to constant embeddings, contextualized em-
beddings such as ELMo, OpenAI GPT and BERT

2https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/



88

consider word embeddings as a function of the
word’s context in which the word is appeared
(McCann et al., 2017; Peters et al., 2018; Rad-
ford et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2018). ELMo
learns word vectors from a deep language model
pretrained on a large text corpus (Peters et al.,
2018). OpenAI GPT uses transformers to learn a
language model and also to fine-tune it for spe-
cific natural language understanding tasks (Rad-
ford et al., 2018). BERT learns words’ representa-
tions by jointly conditioning on both left and right
context in training all levels of deep bidirectional
transformers (Devlin et al., 2018). In this paper,
we show that beside positive effects of contex-
ualized embeddings on many NLP tasks includ-
ing question answering, sentiment analysis and se-
mantic similarity, BERT embeddings also have the
potential to help evaluate open domain dialogue
systems closer to what would human do.

7 Conclusion and Future work

In this paper, we explored applying contextual-
ized word embeddings to automatic evaluation of
open-domain dialogue systems. The experiments
showed that the unreferenced scores of RUBER
metric can be improved by considering contextu-
alized word embeddings which include richer rep-
resentations of words and their context.

In the future, we plan to extend the work to
evaluate multi-turn dialogue systems, as well as
adding other aspects, such as creativity and nov-
elty into consideration in our evaluation metrics.
