Abstract

While generative models such as Latent
Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) have proven fruit-
ful in topic modeling, they often require de-
tailed assumptions and careful specification of
hyperparameters. Such model complexity is-
sues only compound when trying to general-
ize generative models to incorporate human
input. We introduce Correlation Explanation
(CorEx), an alternative approach to topic mod-
eling that does not assume an underlying gen-
erative model, and instead learns maximally
informative topics through an information-
theoretic framework. This framework nat-
urally generalizes to hierarchical and semi-
supervised extensions with no additional mod-
eling assumptions. In particular, word-level
domain knowledge can be flexibly incorpo-
rated within CorEx through anchor words, al-
lowing topic separability and representation to
be promoted with minimal human interven-
tion. Across a variety of datasets, metrics,
and experiments, we demonstrate that CorEx
produces topics that are comparable in quality
to those produced by unsupervised and semi-
supervised variants of LDA.

1 Introduction

The majority of topic modeling approaches utilize
probabilistic generative models, models which spec-
ify mechanisms for how documents are written in
order to infer latent topics. These mechanisms may
be explicitly stated, as in Latent Dirichlet Alloca-
tion (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003), or implicitly stated,
as with matrix factorization techniques (Hofmann,

1999; Ding et al., 2008; Buntine and Jakulin, 2006).
The core generative mechanisms of LDA, in par-
ticular, have inspired numerous generalizations that
account for additional information, such as the au-
thorship (Rosen-Zvi et al., 2004), document labels
(McAuliffe and Blei, 2008), or hierarchical structure
(Griffiths et al., 2004).

However, these generalizations come at the cost
of increasingly elaborate and unwieldy generative
assumptions. While these assumptions allow topic
inference to be tractable in the face of additional
metadata, they progressively constrain topics to a
narrower view of what a topic can be. Such assump-
tions are undesirable in contexts where one wishes to
minimize model complexity and learn topics with-
out preexisting notions of how those topics origi-
nated.

For these reasons, we propose topic modeling
by way of Correlation Explanation (CorEx),1 an
information-theoretic approach to learning latent
topics over documents. Unlike LDA, CorEx does
not assume a particular data generating model, and
instead searches for topics that are “maximally in-
formative” about a set of documents. By learning
informative topics rather than generated topics, we
avoid specifying the structure and nature of topics
ahead of time.

In addition, the lightweight framework underly-
ing CorEx is versatile and naturally extends to hier-
archical and semi-supervised variants with no addi-
tional modeling assumptions. More specifically, we

may flexibly incorporate word-level domain knowl-
edge within the CorEx topic model. Topic models
are often susceptible to portraying only dominant
themes of documents. Injecting a topic model, such
as CorEx, with domain knowledge can help guide it
towards otherwise underrepresented topics that are
of importance to the user. By incorporating rele-
vant domain words, we might encourage our topic
model to recognize a rare disease that would other-
wise be missed in clinical health notes, focus more
attention to topics from news articles that can guide
relief workers in distributing aid more effectively, or
disambiguate aspects of a complex social issue.

Our contributions are as follows: first, we frame
CorEx as a topic model and derive an efficient alter-
ation to the CorEx algorithm to exploit sparse data,
such as word counts in documents, for dramatic
speedups. Second, we show how domain knowledge
can be naturally integrated into CorEx through “an-
chor words” and the information bottleneck. Third,
we demonstrate that CorEx and anchored CorEx
produce topics of comparable quality to unsuper-
vised and semi-supervised variants of LDA over sev-
eral datasets and metrics. Finally, we carefully detail
several anchoring strategies that highlight the versa-
tility of anchored CorEx on a variety of tasks.

2 Methods

2.1 CorEx: Correlation Explanation

Here we review the fundamentals of Correlation Ex-
planation (CorEx), and adopt the notation used by
Ver Steeg and Galstyan in their original presenta-
tion of the model (2014). Let X be a discrete ran-
dom variable that takes on a finite number of val-
ues, indicated with lowercase, x. Furthermore, if
we have n such random variables, let XG denote
a sub-collection of them, where G ⊆ {1, . . . , n}.
The probability of observing XG = xG is written
as p(XG = xG), which is typically abbreviated to
p(xG). The entropy ofX is written asH(X) and the
mutual information of two random variables X1 and
X2 is given by I(X1 : X2) = H(X1) + H(X2) −
H(X1, X2).

The total correlation, or multivariate mutual in-
formation, of a group of random variables XG is ex-

pressed as

TC(XG) =
∑

i∈G
H(Xi)−H(XG) (1)

= DKL

(
p(xG)||

∏

i∈G
p(xi)

)
. (2)

We see that Eq. 1 does not quantify “correlation” in
the modern sense of the word, and so it can be help-
ful to conceptualize total correlation as a measure of
total dependence. Indeed, Eq. 2 shows that total cor-
relation can be expressed using the Kullback-Leibler
Divergence and, therefore, it is zero if and only if
the joint distribution of XG factorizes, or, in other
words, there is no dependence between the random
variables.

The total correlation can be written when condi-
tioning on another random variable Y , TC(XG |
Y ) =

∑
i∈GH(Xi | Y )−H(XG | Y ). So, we can

consider the reduction in the total correlation when
conditioning on Y .

TC(XG;Y ) = TC(XG)− TC(XG | Y ) (3)
=
∑

i∈G
I(Xi : Y )− I(XG : Y ) (4)

The quantity expressed in Eq. 3 acts as a lower
bound of TC(XG) (Ver Steeg and Galstyan, 2015),
as readily verified by noting that TC(XG) and
TC(XG|Y ) are always non-negative. Also note, the
joint distribution of XG factorizes conditional on Y
if and only if TC(XG | Y ) = 0. If this is the case,
then TC(XG;Y ) is maximized, and Y explains all
of the dependencies in XG.

In the context of topic modeling, XG represents
a group of word types and Y represents a topic to
be learned. Since we are always interested in group-
ing multiple sets of words into multiple topics, we
will denote the binary latent topics as Y1, . . . Ym and
their corresponding groups of word types as XGj
for j = 1, . . . ,m respectively. The CorEx topic
model seeks to maximally explain the dependencies
of words in documents through latent topics by max-
imizing TC(X;Y1, . . . , Ym). To do this, we maxi-
mize the following lower bound on this expression:

max
Gj ,p(yj |xGj )

m∑

j=1

TC(XGj ;Yj). (5)

530



As we describe in the following section, this ob-
jective can be efficiently approximated, despite the
search occurring over an exponentially large proba-
bility space (Ver Steeg and Galstyan, 2014).

Since each topic explains a certain portion of the
overall total correlation, we may choose the number
of topics by observing diminishing returns to the ob-
jective. Furthermore, since the CorEx implementa-
tion depends on a random initialization (as described
shortly), one may restart the CorEx topic model sev-
eral times and choose the one that explains the most
total correlation.

The latent factors, Yj , are optimized to be infor-
mative about dependencies in the data and do not
require generative modeling assumptions. Note that
the discovered factors, Y , can be used as inputs to
construct new latent factors, Z, and so on leading
to a hierarchy of topics. Although this extension is
quite natural, we focus our analysis on the first level
of topic representations for easier interpretation and
evaluation.

2.2 CorEx Implementation
We summarize the implementation of CorEx as pre-
sented by Ver Steeg and Galstyan (2014) in prepa-
ration for innovations introduced in the subsequent
sections. The numerical optimization for CorEx be-
gins with a random initialization of parameters and
then proceeds via an iterative update scheme simi-
lar to EM. For computational tractability, we subject
the optimization in Eq. 5 to the constraint that the
groups, Gj , do not overlap, i.e. we enforce single-
membership of words within topics. The optimiza-
tion entails a combinatorial search over groups, so
instead we look for a form that is more amenable to
smooth optimization. We rewrite the objective using
the alternate form in Eq. 4 while introducing indica-
tor variables αi,j which are equal to 1 if and only if
word Xi appears in topic Yj (i.e. i ∈ Gj).

max
αi,j ,p(yj |x)

m∑

j=1

(
n∑

i=1

αi,jI(Xi : Yj)− I(X : Yj)
)

s.t. αi,j = I[j = arg max
j̄
I(Xi : Yj̄)].

(6)

Note that the constraint on non-overlapping groups
now becomes a constraint on α. To make the opti-
mization smooth we should relax the constraint so

that αi,j ∈ [0, 1]. To do so, we replace the second
line with a softmax function. The update for α at
iteration t becomes,

αti,j = exp

(
λt(I(Xi : Yj)−max

j̄
I(Xi : Yj̄))

)
.

Now α ∈ [0, 1] and the parameter λ controls the
sharpness of the softmax function. Early in the opti-
mization we use a small value of λ, then increase it
later in the optimization to enforce a hard constraint.
The objective in Eq. 6 only lower bounds total cor-
relation in the hard max limit. The constraint on α
forces competition among latent factors to explain
certain words, while setting λ = 0 results in all fac-
tors learning the same thing. Holding α fixed, taking
the derivative of the objective (with respect to the
variables p(yj |x), and setting it equal to zero leads
to a fixed point equation. We use this fixed point to
define update equations at iteration t.

pt(yj) =
∑

x̄

pt(yj |x̄)p(x̄) (7)

pt(xi|yj) =
∑

log pt(yj)+
n∑

i=1

αti,j log
pt(x

`
i | yj)

p(x`i)
− logZj(x`)

The first two lines just define the marginals in terms
of the optimization parameter, pt(yj |x). We take
p(x) to be the empirical distribution defined by some
observed samples, x`, ` = 1, . . . , N . The third line
updates pt(yj |x`), the probabilistic labels for each
latent factor, Yj , for a given sample, x`. Note that an
easily calculated constant, Zj(x`), appears to ensure
the normalization of pt(yj |x`) for each sample. We
iterate through these updates until convergence.

After convergence, we use the mutual information
terms I(Xi : Yj) to rank which words are most in-
formative for each factor. The objective is a sum
of terms for each latent factor and this allows us to
rank the contribution of each factor toward our lower
bound on the total correlation. The expected log of
the normalization constant, often called the free en-
ergy, E[logZj(x)], plays an important role since its
expectation provides a free estimate of the i-th term
in the objective (Ver Steeg and Galstyan, 2015), as

531



can be seen by taking the expectation of Eq. 8 at
convergence and comparing it to Eq. 6. Because our
sample estimate of the objective is just the mean of
contributions from individual sample points, x`, we
refer to logZj(x`) as the pointwise total correlation
explained by factor j for sample `. Pointwise TC
can be used to localize which samples are particu-
larly informative about specific latent factors.

2.3 Sparsity Optimization
2.3.1 Derivation

To alter the CorEx optimization procedure to ex-
ploit sparsity in the data, we now assume that all
variables, xi, yj , are binary and x is a binary vector
where X`i = 1 if word i occurs in document ` and
X`i = 0 otherwise. Since all variables are binary,
the marginal distribution, p(xi|yj), is just a two by
two table of probabilities and can be estimated effi-
ciently. The time-consuming part of training is the
subsequent update of the document labels in Eq. 8
for each document `. The computation of the log
likelihood ratio for all n words over all documents is
not efficient, as most words do not appear in a given
document. We rewrite the logarithm in the interior
of the sum.

log
pt(x

`
i | yj)

p(x`i)
= log

pt(Xi = 0 | yj)
p(Xi = 0)

+ (9)

xli log

(
pt(X

`
i = 1 | yj)p(Xi = 0)

pt(Xi = 0 | yj)p(X`i = 1)

)

Note, when the word does not appear in the docu-
ment, only the leading term of Eq. 9 will be nonzero.
However, when the word does appear, everything
but logP (X`i = 1 | yj)/p(X`i = 1) cancels out. So,
we have taken advantage of the fact that the CorEx
topic model binarizes documents to assume by de-
fault that a word does not appear in the document,
and then correct the contribution to the update if the
word does appear.

Thus, when substituting back into Eq. 8, the sum
becomes a matrix multiplication between a matrix
with dimensions of the number of variables by the
number of documents and entries x`i that is as-
sumed to be sparse and a dense matrix with di-
mensions of the number of variables by the num-
ber of latent factors. Given n variables, N sam-
ples, and ρ nonzero entries in the data matrix, the

Number of Words
(5000 Documents Fixed)

Figure 1: Speed comparisons to a fixed number of itera-
tions as the number of documents and words vary. New
York Times articles and PubMed abstracts were collected
from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (Lichman,
2013). The disaster relief articles are described in section
4.1, and represented simply as bags of words, not phrases.

asymptotic scaling for CorEx goes from O(Nn) to
O(n)+O(N)+O(ρ) exploiting sparsity. Latent tree
modeling approaches are quadratic in n or worse, so
we expect CorEx’s computational advantage to in-
crease for larger datasets.

2.3.2 Optimization Evaluation

We perform experiments comparing the running
time of CorEx before and after implementing the im-
provements which exploit sparsity. We also compare
with Scikit-Learn’s simple batch implementation of
LDA using the variational Bayes algorithm (Hoff-
man et al., 2013). Experiments were performed on a
four core, Intel i5 chip running at 4 GHz with 32 GB
RAM. We show run time when varying the data size
in terms of the number of word types and the num-
ber of documents. We used 50 topics for all runs and
set the number of iterations for each run to 10 itera-
tions for LDA and 50 iterations for CorEx. Results
are shown in Figure 1. We see that CorEx exploit-
ing sparsity is orders of magnitude faster than the

532



naive version and is generally comparable to LDA
as the number of documents scales. The slope on
the log-log plot suggests a linear dependence of run-
ning time on the dataset size, as expected.

2.4 Anchor Words via the Bottleneck
The information bottleneck formulates a trade-off
between compressing data X into a representation
Y , and preserving the information in X that is rel-
evant to Z (typically labels in a supervised learning
task) (Tishby et al., 1999; Friedman et al., 2001).
More formally, the information bottleneck is ex-
pressed as

max
p(y|x)

βI(Z : Y )− I(X : Y ), (10)

where β is a parameter controlling the trade-off be-
tween compressing X and preserving information
about the relevance variable, Z.

To see the connection with CorEx, we compare
the CorEx objective as written in Eq. 6 with the
bottleneck in Eq. 10. We see that we have exactly
the same compression term for each latent factor,
I(X : Yj), but the relevance variables now corre-
spond to Z ≡ Xi. If we want to learn represen-
tations that are more relevant to specific keywords,
we can simply anchor a word type Xi to topic Yj ,
by constraining our optimization so that αi,j = βi,j ,
where βi,j ≥ 1 controls the anchor strength. Oth-
erwise, the updates on α remain the same. This
schema is a natural extension of the CorEx optimiza-
tion and it is flexible, allowing for multiple word
types to be anchored to one topic, for one word type
to be anchored to multiple topics, or for any com-
bination of these semi-supervised anchoring strate-
gies.

3 Related Work

With respect to integrating domain knowledge into
topic models, we draw inspiration from Arora et
al. (2012), who used anchor words in the con-
text of non-negative matrix factorization. Using an
assumption of separability, these anchor words act
as high precision markers of particular topics and,
thus, help discern the topics from one another. Al-
though the original algorithm proposed by Arora et
al. (2012), and subsequent improvements to their
approach, find these anchor words automatically

(Arora et al., 2013; Lee and Mimno, 2014), recent
adaptations allow manual insertion of anchor words
and other metadata (Nguyen et al., 2014; Nguyen et
al., 2015). Our work is similar to the latter, where we
treat anchor words as fuzzy logic markers and em-
bed them into the topic model in a semi-supervised
fashion. In this sense, our work is closest to Halpern
et al. (2014; 2015), who have also made use of do-
main expertise and semi-supervised anchored words
in devising topic models.

There is an adjacent line of work that has focused
on incorporating word-level information into LDA-
based models. Jagarlamudi et al. (2012) proposed
SeededLDA, a model that seeds words into given
topics and guides, but does not force, these topics
towards these integrated words. Andrzejewski and
Zhu (2009) presented a model that makes use of “z-
labels,” words that are known to pertain to specific
topics and that are restricted to appearing in some
subset of all the possible topics. Although the z-
labels can be leveraged to place different senses of a
word into different topics, it requires additional ef-
fort to determine when these different senses occur.
Our anchoring approach allows a user to more easily
anchor one word to multiple topics, allowing CorEx
to naturally find topics that revolve around different
senses of a word.

Andrzejewski et al. (2009) presented a second
model which allows specification of Must-Link and
Cannot-Link relationships between words that help
partition otherwise muddled topics. These logical
constraints help enforce topic separability, though
these mechanisms less directly address how to an-
chor a single word or set of words to help a topic
emerge. More generally, the Must/Cannot link
and z-label topic models have been expressed in a
powerful first-order-logic framework that allows the
specification of arbitrary domain knowledge through
logical rules (Andrzejewski et al., 2011). Others
have built off this first-order-logic approach to au-
tomatically learn rule weights (Mei et al., 2014)
and incorporate additional latent variable informa-
tion (Foulds et al., 2015).

Mathematically, CorEx topic models most closely
resemble topic models based on latent tree recon-
struction (Chen et al., 2016). In Chen et al.’s (2016)
analysis, their own latent tree approach and CorEx
both report significantly better perplexity than hi-

533



erarchical topic models based on the hierarchical
Dirichlet process and the Chinese restaurant process.
CorEx has also been investigated as a way to find
“surprising” documents (Hodas et al., 2015).

4 Data and Evaluation Methods

4.1 Data

We use two challenging datasets with corresponding
domain knowledge lexicons to evaluate anchored
CorEx. Our first dataset consists of 504,000 human-
itarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR) arti-
cles covering 21 disaster types collected from Re-
liefWeb, an HA/DR news article aggregator spon-
sored by the United Nations. To mitigate over-
whelming label imbalances during anchoring, we
both restrict ourselves to documents in English with
one label, and randomly subsample 2,000 articles
from each of the largest disaster type labels. This
leaves us with a corpus of 18,943 articles.2

We accompany these articles with an HA/DR lex-
icon of approximately 34,000 words and phrases.
The lexicon was curated by first gathering 40–60
seed terms per disaster type from HA/DR domain
experts and CrisisLex. This term list was then ex-
panded by creating word embeddings for each dis-
aster type, and taking terms within a specified co-
sine similarity of the seed words. These lists were
then filtered by removing names, places, non-ASCII
characters, and terms with fewer than three charac-
ters. Finally, the extracted terms were audited using
CrowdFlower, where users rated the relevance of the
terms on a Likert scale. Low relevance terms were
dropped from the lexicon. Of these terms 11,891
types appear in the HA/DR articles.

Our second dataset consists of 1,237 deidentified
clinical discharge summaries from the Informatics
for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) 2008
Obesity Challenge.3 These summaries are labeled
by clinical experts with 15 conditions frequently
associated with obesity. For these documents, we
leverage a text pipeline that extracts common med-
ical terms and phrases (Dai et al., 2008; Chapman
et al., 2001), which yields 3,231 such term types.

http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/TGOPRU

3Data available upon data use agreement at https://
www.i2b2.org/NLP/Obesity/

For both sets of documents, we use their respective
lexicons to break the documents down into bags of
words and phrases.

We also make use of the 20 Newsgroups dataset,
as provided and preprocessed in the Scikit-Learn li-
brary (Pedregosa et al., 2011).

4.2 Evaluation

CorEx does not explicitly attempt to learn a genera-
tive model and, thus, traditional measures such as
perplexity are not appropriate for model compari-
son against LDA. Furthermore, it is well-known that
perplexity and held-out log-likelihood do not neces-
sarily correlate with human evaluation of semantic
topic quality (Chang et al., 2009). Therefore, we
measure the semantic topic quality using Mimno et
al.’s (2011) UMass automatic topic coherence score,
which correlates with human judgments.

We also evaluate the models in terms of multi-
class logistic regression document classification (Pe-
dregosa et al., 2011), where the feature set of each
document is its topic distribution. We perform all
document classification tasks using a 60/40 training-
test split.

Finally, we measure how well each topic model
does at clustering documents. We obtain a cluster-
ing by assigning each document to the topic that oc-
curs with the highest probability. We then measure
the quality within clusters (homogeneity) and across
clusters (adjusted mutual information). The highest
possible value for both measures is one. We do not
report clustering metrics on the clinical health notes
because the documents are multi-label and, in that
case, the metrics are not well-defined.

4.3 Choosing Anchor Words

We wish to systematically test the effect of anchor
words given the domain-specific lexicons. To do so,
we follow the approach used by Jagarlamudi et al.
(2012) to automatically generate anchor words: for
each label in a data set, we find the words that have
the highest mutual information with the label. For
word w and label L, this is computed as

I(L : w) = H(L)−H(L | w), (11)

where for each document of label L we consider if
the word w appears or not.

and clustering on three different datasets as the number
of topics vary. Points are the average of 30 runs of a topic
model. Confidence intervals are plotted but are so small
that they are not distinguishable. CorEx is trained using
binary data, while LDA is trained on count data. Ho-
mogeneity is not well-defined on the multi-label clinical
health notes, so it is omitted.

5 Results

5.1 LDA Baseline Comparison

We compare CorEx to LDA in terms of topic coher-
ence, document classification, and document clus-
tering across three datasets. CorEx is trained on bi-
nary data, while LDA is trained on count data. While
not reported here, CorEx consistently outperformed
LDA trained on binary data. In doing these compar-
isons, we use the Gensim implementation of LDA
(Řehůřek and Sojka, 2010). The results of compar-
ing CorEx to LDA as a function of the number of
topics are presented in Figure 2.

Across all three datasets, we find that the topics
produced by CorEx yield document classification re-
sults that are on par with or better than those pro-
duced by LDA topics. In terms of clustering, CorEx
consistently produces document clusters of higher

notes, it is particularly striking that CorEx is able
to produce high quality topics while only leverag-
ing binary count data. Examples of these topics are
shown in Table 1. Despite the binary counts limi-
tation, CorEx still finds meaningfully coherent and
competitive structure in the data.

5.2 Anchored CorEx Analysis

We now examine the effects and benefits of guiding
CorEx through anchor words. In doing so, we also
compare anchored CorEx to other semi-supervised
topic models.

5.2.1 Anchoring for Topic Separability
We are first interested in how anchoring can be

used to encourage topic separability so that docu-
ments cluster well. We focus on the HA/DR articles
and 20 newsgroups datasets, since traditional clus-
tering metrics are not well-defined on the multi-label
clinical health notes. For both datasets, we fix the

Table 2: Examples of topics learned by CorEx when
simultaneously anchoring many topics with anchoring
parameter β = 2. Anchor words are shown in bold.
Words are ranked according to mutual information with
the topic, and topics are ranked according to the amount
of total correlation they explain. Topic models were run
with 21 topics on the Reliefweb articles and 20 topics on
the 20 Newsgroups dataset.

number of topics to be equal to the number of doc-
ument labels. It is in this context that we compare
anchored CorEx to two other semi-supervised topic
models: z-labels LDA and must/cannot link LDA.

Using the method described in Section 4.3, we au-
tomatically retrieve the top five anchors for each dis-
aster type and newsgroup. We then filter these lists
of any words that are ambiguous, i.e. words that
are anchor words for more than one document label.
For anchored CorEx and z-labels LDA we simulta-
neously assign each set of anchor words to exactly
one topic each. For must/cannot link LDA, we cre-
ate must-links within the words of the same anchor

group, and create cannot-links between words of dif-
ferent anchor groups.

Since we are simultaneously anchoring to many
topics, we use a weak anchoring parameter β = 2
for anchored CorEx. Using the notation from their
original papers, we use η = 1 for z-labels LDA,
and η = 1000 for must/cannot link LDA. For both
LDA variants, we use α = 0.5, β = 0.1 and take
2,000 samples, and estimate the models using code
implemented by the original authors.

The results of this comparison are shown in Fig-
ure 3, and examples of anchored CorEx topics are
shown in Table 2. Across all measures CorEx and
anchored CorEx outperform LDA. We find that an-
chored CorEx always improves cluster quality ver-
sus CorEx in terms of homogeneity and adjusted
mutual information. Compared to CorEx, multiple
simultaneous anchoring neither harms nor benefits
the topic coherence of anchored CorEx. Together
these metrics suggest that anchored CorEx is find-
ing topics that are of equivalent coherence to CorEx,
but more relevant to the document labels since gains
are seen in terms of document clustering.

Against the other semi-supervised topic models,
anchored CorEx compares favorably. The document
clustering of anchored CorEx is similar to, or bet-
ter than, that of z-labels LDA and must/cannot link
LDA. Across the disaster relief articles, anchored
CorEx finds less coherent topics than the two LDA
variants, while it finds similarly coherent topics as
must/cannot link LDA on the 20 newsgroup dataset.

5.2.2 Anchoring for Topic Representation
We now turn to studying how domain knowledge

can be anchored to a single topic to help an other-
wise dominated topic emerge, and how the anchor-
ing parameter β affects that emergence. To discern
this effect, we focus just on anchored CorEx along
with the HA/DR articles and clinical health notes,
datasets for which we have a domain expert lexicon.

We devise the following experiment: first, we de-
termine the top five anchor words for each docu-
ment label using the methodology described in Sec-
tion 4.3. Unlike in the previous section, we do not
filter these lists of ambiguous anchor words. Sec-
ond, for each document label, we run an anchored
CorEx topic model with that label’s anchor words
anchored to exactly one topic. We compare this an-

chored topic model to an unsupervised CorEx topic
model using the same random seeds, thus creating a
matched pair where the only difference is the treat-
ment of anchor words. Finally, this matched pairs
process is repeated 30 times, yielding a distribution
for each metric over each label.

We use 50 topics when modeling the ReliefWeb
articles and 30 topics when modeling the i2b2 clin-
ical health notes. These values were chosen by ob-
serving diminishing returns to the total correlation
explained by additional topics.

In Figure 4 we show how the results of this ex-
periment vary as a function of the anchoring pa-
rameter β for each disaster and disease type in the
two data sets. Since there is heavy variance across
document labels for each metric, we also examine a
more detailed cross section of these results in Fig-
ure 5, where we set β = 5 for the clinical health
notes and set β = 10 for the disaster relief arti-
cles. As we show momentarily, disaster and disease
types that benefit the most from anchoring were un-

Figure 5: Cross-section results of the anchoring metrics from fixing β = 5 for the clinical health notes, and β = 10 for
the disaster relief articles. Disaster and disease types are sorted by frequency, with the most frequent document labels
appearing at the top. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. The color bars provide context for each metric:
topic overlap pre-anchoring, proportion of topic model runs where the anchored topic was the most predictive topic,
and F1 score pre-anchoring.

derrepresented pre-anchoring. Document labels that
were well-represented prior to anchoring achieve
only marginal gain. This results in the variance seen
in Figure 4.

A priori we do not know that anchoring will cause
the anchor words to appear at the top of topics. So,
we first measure how the topic overlap, the propor-
tion of the top ten mutual information words that ap-
pear within the top ten words of the topics, changes
before and after anchoring. From Figure 4 (row
1) we see that as β increases, more of these rel-
evant words consistently appear within the topics.
For the disaster relief articles, many disaster types
see about two more words introduced, while in the
clinical health notes the overlap increases by up to
four words. Analyzing the cross section in Fig-
ure 5 (column 1), we see many of these gains come
from disaster and disease types that appeared less
in the topics pre-anchoring. Thus, we can sway the
topic model towards less dominant themes through
anchoring. Document labels that occur the most
frequently are those for which the topic overlap
changes the least.

Next, we examine whether these anchored topics

are more coherent topics. To do so, we compare the
coherence of the anchored topic with that of the most
predictive topic pre-anchoring, i.e. the topic with the
largest corresponding coefficient in magnitude of the
logistic regression, when the anchored topic itself is
most predictive. From Figure 4 (row 2), we see these
results have more variance, but largely the anchored
topics are more coherent. In some cases, the coher-
ence is 1.5 to 2 times that of pre-anchoring. Fur-
thermore, by colors of the central panel of Figure 5,
we find that the anchored topics are, indeed, often
the most predictive topics for each document label.
Similar to topic overlap, the labels that see the least
improvement are those that appear the most and are
already well-represented in the topic model.

Finally, we find that the anchored, more coherent
topics can lead to modest gains in document clas-
sification. For the disaster relief articles, Figure 4
(row 3) shows that there are mixed results in terms
of F1 score improvement, with some disaster types
performing consistently better, and others perform-
ing consistently worse. The results are more consis-
tent for the clinical health notes, where there is an
average increase of about 0.1 in the F1 score, and

538



some disease types see an increase of up to 0.3 in
F1. Given that we are only anchoring 5 words to the
topic model, these are significant gains in predictive
power.

Unlike the gains in topic overlap and coherence,
the F1 score increases do not simply correlate with
which document labels appeared most frequently.
For example, we see in Figure 5 (column 3) that
Tropical Cyclone exhibits the largest increase in pre-
dictive performance, even though it is also one of the
most frequently appearing document labels. Simi-
larly, some of the major gains in F1 for the disease
types, and major losses in F1 for the disaster types,
do not come from the most or least frequent docu-
ment labels. Thus, if using anchoring single topics
within CorEx for document classification, it is im-
portant to examine how the anchoring affects pre-
diction for individual document labels.

5.2.3 Anchoring for Topic Aspects
Finding topics that revolve around a word, such

as a name or location, or a group of words can aid
in understanding how a particular subject or event
has been framed. We finish with a qualitative ex-
periment where we disambiguate aspects of a topic
by anchoring a set of words to multiple topics within
the CorEx topic model. Note, must/cannot link LDA
cannot be used in this manner, and z-labels LDA
would require us to know these aspects beforehand.

We consider tweets containing #Ferguson (case-
insensitive), which detail reactions to the shooting
of Black teenager Michael Brown by White po-
lice officer Darren Wilson on August 9th, 2014 in
Ferguson, Missouri. These tweets were collected
from the Twitter Gardenhose, a 10% random sam-
ple of all tweets, over the period August 9th, 2014 to
November 30th, 2014. Since CorEx will seek max-
imally informative topics by exploiting redundan-
cies, we remove duplicates of retweets, leaving us
with 869,091 tweets. We filter these tweets of punc-
tuation, stop words, hyperlinks, usernames, and the
‘RT’ retweet symbol, and use the top 20,000 word
types.

In the wake of both the shooting and the eventual
non-indictment of Darren Wilson, several protests
occurred. Some onlookers supported and encour-
aged such protests, while others characterized the
protests as violent “riots.” To disambiguate these

different depictions, we train a CorEx topic model
with 55 topics, anchoring “protest” and “protests”
together to five topics, and “riot” and “riots” to-
gether to five topics with β = 2. These anchored
topics are presented in Table 3.

The anchored topics reflect different aspects of
the framing of the “protests” and “riots,” and are
generally interpretable, despite the typical difficulty
of extracting coherent topics from short documents
using LDA (Tang et al., 2014). The “protest” topic
aspects describe protests in St. Louis, Oakland, Bev-
erly Hills, and parts of New York City (topics 1,
3, 4, 5), resistance by law enforcement (topics 3
and 4), and discussion of whether the protests were
peaceful (topic 1). Topic 2 revolves around hip-hop
artists who marched in solidarity with protesters.

539



The “riot” topic aspects discuss racial dynamics of
the protests (topic 7) and suggest the demonstrations
are dangerous (topics 8 and 9). Topic 10 describes
the “riot” gear used in the militarized response to
the Ferguson protesters, and Topic 7 also hints at
aspects of conservatism through the hashtags #tcot
(Top Conservatives on Twitter) and #pjnet (Patriot
Journalist Network).

As we see, anchored CorEx finds several in-
teresting, non-trivial aspects around “protest” and
“riot” that could spark additional qualitative inves-
tigation. Retrieving topic aspects through anchor
words in this manner allows the user to explore dif-
ferent frames of complex issues, events, or discus-
sions within documents. As with the other anchor-
ing strategies, this has the potential to supplement
qualitative research done by researchers within the
social sciences and digital humanities.

6 Discussion

We have introduced an information-theoretic topic
model, CorEx, that does not rely on any of the gener-
ative assumptions of LDA-based topic models. This
topic model seeks maximally informative topics as
encoded by their total correlation. We also derived
a flexible method for anchoring word-level domain
knowledge in the CorEx topic model through the in-
formation bottleneck. Anchored CorEx guides the
topic model towards themes that do not naturally
emerge, and often produces more coherent and pre-
dictive topics. Both CorEx and anchored CorEx
consistently produce topics that are of comparable
quality to LDA-based methods, despite only making
use of binarized word counts.

Anchored CorEx is more flexible than previous
attempts at integrating word-level information into
topic models. Topic separability can be enforced by
lightly anchoring disjoint groups of words to sepa-
rate topics, topic representation can be promoted by
assertively anchoring a group of words to a single
topic, and topic aspects can be unveiled by anchor-
ing a single group of words to multiple topics. The
flexibility of anchoring through the information bot-
tleneck lends itself to many other possible creative
anchoring strategies that could guide the topic model
in different ways. Different goals may call for dif-
ferent anchoring strategies, and domain experts can

shape these strategies to their needs.
While we have demonstrated several advantages

of the CorEx topic model to LDA, it does have some
technical shortcomings. Most notably, CorEx re-
lies on binary count data in its sparsity optimiza-
tion, rather than the standard count data that is used
as input into LDA and other topic models. While
we have demonstrated CorEx performs at the level
of LDA despite this limitation, its effect would be
more noticeable on longer documents. This can be
partly overcome if one chunks such longer docu-
ments into shorter subdocuments prior to running
the topic model. Our implementation also requires
that each word appears in only one topic. These lim-
itations are not fundamental limitations of the the-
ory, but a matter of computational efficiency. In
future work, we hope to remove these restrictions
while preserving the speed of the sparse CorEx topic
modeling algorithm.

As we have demonstrated, the information-
theoretic approach provided via CorEx has rich po-
tential for finding meaningful structure in docu-
ments, particularly in a way that can help domain
experts guide topic models with minimal interven-
tion to capture otherwise eclipsed themes. The
lightweight and versatile framework of anchored
CorEx leaves open possibilities for theoretical ex-
tensions and novel applications within the realm of
topic modeling.
