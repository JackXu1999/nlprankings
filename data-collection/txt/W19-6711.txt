Abstract

Despite the importance of trust in any work
environment, this concept has rarely been
investigated for MT. The present contri-
bution aims at filling this gap by present-
ing a post-editing experiment carried out
with translator trainees. An institutional
academic text was translated from Italian
into English. All participants worked on
the same target text. Half of them were
told that the text was a human translation
needing revision, while the other half was
told that it was an MT output to be post-
edited. Temporal and technical effort were
measured based on words per second and
HTER. Results were complemented with a
manual analysis of a subset of the observa-
tions.

1 Introduction

In the last few years, neural machine translation
(NMT) has become the state-of-the-art paradigm
in the field of machine translation (MT). This fast-
paced progress has shaken the translation industry
and the research world, causing different reactions.
Part of the research world has responded with en-
thusiastic claims about the quality achieved with
this new architecture (Hassan et al., 2018; Wu et
al., 2016), while other studies have tempered such
enthusiasm, reporting less clear-cut improvements
(Toral and Sánchez-Cartagena, 2017; Castilho et
al., 2017).

Companies and individual professionals have
started to exploit MT more than in previous years.

As testified by the 2018 Language Industry Sur-
vey1, for the first time more than half of companies
and individual language professionals have stated
that they use MT in their workflow. In the same
survey repeated in 20192, only generic MT engines
(Google Translate and DeepL) were chosen among
the 20 most-used tools in companies’ workflow.

In this uncertain scenario, translators’ opinion
on MT is likely to be mixed. In the 2019 Language
Industry Survey3, MT was identified as a negative
trend by 20% and as a positive one by 30% of the
respondents. Lack of training in MT low output
quality resulting from adoption of general purpose
engines, and a potential downward trend in trans-
lation rates may all explain the negative opinion
(some) translators have of MT (Läubli and Orrego-
Carmona, 2017), and their limited trust, leading to
non-adoption of MT suggestions (Cadwell et al.,
2018). Investigating how trust towards MT in-
fluences translator trainees’ behaviour towards the
output, along the lines of Martindale and Carpuat
(2018), is thus crucial to evaluate the likelihood
that translators convincingly embrace MT.

In this contribution, we ask whether translators’
trust changes based on the task they are working
on, i.e. if they behave differently when they be-
lieve they are revising a human translation (HT) vs.
post-editing an MT output. We see trust as strictly
related to productivity: when post-editors/revisers
do not trust a text, they are likely to carry out time-
consuming and potentially unnecessary searches,
or perform unnecessary edits.

In our study, 47 students from a Master’s in

translation of an Italian university, revised/post-
edited the same English translation of an Italian
source text composed of two academic module de-
scriptions. Half of them were told that the trans-
lation was an MT output, while the other half was
told that the text had been translated by a human
translator. We measured the time each participant
spent on each sentence, and the number and ex-
tent of changes they made. In what follows we
summarise previous work on post-editing (PE) and
trust (Sect. 2), describe the experimental setting
and method (Sect. 3), outline results (Sect. 4) and
draw some conclusions (Sect. 5).

2.1 Post-editing of MT

To the best of our knowledge, no work has been
published yet on the assessment of trust towards
MT as measured in a PE task. Martindale and
Carpuat (2018) conducted a survey among non-
professionals to understand how their trust was in-
fluenced by fluency and adequacy. The former is-
sue is found to have a stronger negative impact on
non-professional translators. More recently, Cad-
well et al. (2018) interviewed two groups of in-
stitutional translators to investigate the reasons for
adoption or rejection of MT suggestions. Both
groups mentioned lack of trust toward MT as one
of the reasons for rejecting MT segments.

Focusing on PE tasks in different languages,
a number of papers have analysed how perfor-
mance changes for different subjects or in different
work environments, and using one or more effort
categories among those listed by Krings (2001):
temporal, technical and cognitive. Moorkens and
O’Brien (2015) used edit distance and speed to
compare the productivity of professionals and stu-
dents in a PE (En–De) task, whose aim was to
evaluate the suitability of the latter for translation
user studies. Daems et al. (2017) examined how
10 Master’s students and 13 professional transla-
tors coped with translation from scratch and PE of
newspaper articles (En–Nl), measuring translation
speed and cognitive load. Moorkens and O’Brien
(2015) found that students have a less negative at-
titude towards technology, but their productivity
cannot be compared to that of professionals; by
contrast, according to Daems et al. (2017) the per-
formance of the two groups was not as different as
could be expected, and indeed students were more
at ease with PE than professionals.

Yamada (2019) compared perceived cognitive
effort, amount of editing and final quality between
two PE tasks carried out by students, one using
an NMT output and one a PBMT output (En–Ja).
While the cognitive effort was similar for the NMT
and PBMT tasks, NMT output required less edit-
ing effort and led to a better final quality.

Rossetti and Gaspari (2017) measured perceived
and real effort of six MA students when translat-
ing with translation memories (TMs) and in a PE
scenario, triangulating time measurements, think-
aloud protocols (TAPs) and retrospective inter-
views. Results show that only suggestions coming
from the TM had a positive impact on perceived
task complexity and temporal effort.

Despite growing interest in PE, to the best of
our knowledge trust has not been investigated in
such task. Furthermore, our language combina-
tion (It–En) is relatively under-represented in PE
experiments, and the text domain we are focusing
on (university module descriptions) is a novel one
in this scenario.

2.2 Trust

The notion of trust is a multifaceted one, which has
been studied in a host of different fields. McKnight
et al. (2001) report that, in three different mono-
lingual English dictionaries, on average 17 differ-
ent definitions of trust are provided. Lee and See
(2004) define trust as “the attitude that an agent
will help achieve an individual’s goal in a situation
characterised by uncertainty and vulnerability”.

Even though human-machine relationships may
develop in the same way as human-human ones
(Madhavan and Wiegmann, 2007), the constructs
developed to describe trust between human beings
do not fully transfer to human-machine interac-
tions (Lee and See, 2004). First, human beings,
behave intentionally. Second, interpersonal trust
depends on how both parties perceive the coun-
terpart’s behaviour, which does not happen when
one of the parties involved is a machine. In this
case, trust follows from observation of technology
performance, from understanding of its underly-
ing architecture, and from intended use (Lee and
See, 2004). Translators’ lack of trust toward MT
might therefore be influenced by different factors,
including inconsistency/unpredictability of its out-
put (especially true of NMT), or misconceived ex-
pectations about its functioning.

Since several academic programs have recently

Proceedings of MT Summit XVII, volume 2 Dublin, Aug. 19-23, 2019 | p. 74



started to offer courses on MT, the next generation
of translators will be the first to enter the market
with some knowledge of it. Whether their trust in
the technology is likely to increase as a result is
still an open question.

3 Experimental setup

3.1 Goals and variables

Post-editors’ productivity was analysed with re-
spect to the following variables: (a) translation
method (students are told that the text is an MT
output vs. a HT); (b) translation correctness (the
translation is correct and needs to be confirmed vs.
it is incorrect and needs to be edited).

3.2 Participants

47 students of the Master’s in Specialised Transla-
tion of the University of Bologna took part in the
experiment. 23 participants worked on the PE task
and 24 on the revision task.

Native languages of the participants working
on MT were Italian (69.6%), English (4.3%) and
other (26.1%). The native language of participants
working on the purported revision of a HT was
Italian (79.2%), English (8.3%) and other (15.5%).
Although translating into English as L2 is not com-
mon practice for experiments in this field, the real-
ity of the profession is quite different. Two surveys
quoted by Pokorn (2016) revealed, respectively,
that for 24% of the respondents the ability of trans-
lating into an L2 is essential or important for newly
employed translators4 and that more than 50% of
780 free-lance translators working in 80 states (in-
cluding Italy) translate into L2 5

All students belonged to the same cohort. This
allowed us to control for (i) their PE/translation ex-
perience; (ii) their knowledge of the text type and
disciplinary domains of the texts; (iii) their knowl-
edge of English.

Regarding (i), students attended hands-on mod-
ules on CAT tools and on MT and PE as part of
their syllabus. One week before the experiment,
they received training on the use of MateCat,6 the
tool used for the task (see Sect. 3.3). Also, in
a pre-experiment questionnaire, they were asked

how much experience they had with the revision
of a HT or PEMT in a professional setting. Pos-
sible answers were: None, Little, i.e. from 1 to
5 professional tasks or Much, i.e. more than 5
professional tasks. Results are reported in Table
1 and show that the degree of expertise is similar
in both groups, since the vast majority of the par-
ticipants had no or little professional experience.
Regarding (ii), all subjects are likely to be familiar
with the text type, since course unit descriptions
address students, and are unlikely to be acquainted
with the domains (pharmacy and chemistry), since
their academic background is in languages and lin-
guistics. Concerning (iii), all students are tested
upon enrollment in the Master’s, a minimum of C1
CEFR being required for admission.7

To collect data on participants’ opinion regard-
ing MT, in the pre-experiment questionnaire they
were asked how useful they thought MT is for
translators. Results in Table 1 suggest that all par-
ticipants have a positive opinion on MT, confirm-
ing the results described by Daems et al. (2017)
and Moorkens and O’Brien (2015) (see Sect 2.1).

3.3 Task

The same text was used for both the MT PE task
and the HT revision task. It was composed of two
course unit descriptions – for a course on chem-
istry and one on pharmacy – written in Italian. The
English version was produced with a state-of-the-
art off-the-shelf NMT system, which ensures the
high-quality of the target text used for the experi-
ment.

The final version of the text was the result of a
two-step procedure. First, to make sure the text
could be believed to be a HT, we checked for pos-
sible mistakes typical of MT systems. To estab-
lish which sentences were (in)correct, three eval-
uators were asked to assign each sentence to one

7https://bit.ly/2pVyffz

Proceedings of MT Summit XVII, volume 2 Dublin, Aug. 19-23, 2019 | p. 75



of the following categories: (i) correct (the mean-
ing of the source sentence is conveyed in the target
text and no editing is required); (ii) incorrect (the
meaning of the source sentence is conveyed in the
target text but edits are required. In this case, eval-
uators were asked to annotate the part of the sen-
tence that should be edited); (iii) wrong (the mean-
ing of the source sentence is not conveyed in the
target text). The final decision as to the correct-
ness of each sentence was made by majority vote.
None of the sentences was labelled as wrong.

A small amount of edits were performed in order
to have half correct sentences and half incorrect
ones in the data set (see Sect. 3.1). At the end
of this procedure, the text consisted of 60 sentence
pairs, corresponding approximately to 670 source
words in total.

Participants worked in MateCat. A project – in-
cluding a termbase – was assigned to each of them.

A week before, students were given basic in-
formation about the experiment.8 After read-
ing the instructions, students started working au-
tonomously. In the instructions they were invited
to work as they normally would. They were asked
to deliver a target text of publishable quality, but
encouraged to use the provided target text as much
as possible and not to over-edit. Researchers were
present in the lab throughout.

3.4 Evaluation methods
Productivity was measured in terms of HTER
(Snover et al., 2006) between the original text and
the participants’ edited version, and in terms of
words per second (WPS). The latter was obtained
by converting MateCat time measurements on a
segment level into seconds and dividing them by
the number of words in the target text.

Two separate linear mixed models were built,
one for each dependent variable, i.e. HTER and
WPS. In both cases, the independent variables
(or fixed effects) are categorical, i.e. translation
method (MT/HT), and translation correctness (cor-
rect/incorrect). We included in the model an inter-
action of the two, with participant and segment as
random effects.

Random effects were tested for significance us-
ing the likelihood ratio test. Following Gries
(2015), a model including all fixed and random
effects was built and compared using ANOVAs
8Students were told that the final aim was to compare PE and
revision, that data would be collected anonymously and that
taking part in the experiment was not compulsory.

against different models, each excluding one of the
random effects. If the difference between the two
models was significant (p < 0.05), the random ef-
fect was kept in the model.

4 Results

Tables 2 and 3 summarise significance and esti-
mates for the effects of the two linear mixed mod-
els. Figure 1 shows the distribution of HTER and
WPS values for individual segments split by trans-
lation method and correctness.

4.1 HTER analysis

As expected, in Figure 1 HTER is higher for incor-
rect sentences overall. While differences between
PEMT and HT revision in both cases are small,
HTER values for correct MT sentences are slightly
higher than values for correct HT sentences.

Moving on to results of our linear mixed model,
the two random effects participant and segment
do have a statistically significant impact on the
HTER scores (see Table 2), i.e. the observations
for the same segment or for the same participant
are strongly correlated. Using a mixed model guar-
antees that the effect of these correlations on the
dependent variable is controlled for. Translation
correctness is the only fixed effect with a statis-
tically significant impact on HTER, while neither
translation method nor its interaction with transla-
tion correctness significantly impact on it.

The model thus shows that the number of edits
changes significantly only between correct and in-
correct sentences, while the amount of edits per-
formed on HT and MT sentences does not dif-
fer significantly. The effect of the interaction was
not significant either, i.e. no significant change in
HTER scores is observed in HT revision and MT
PE across translation correctness conditions.

Table 3: Estimates of the two linear mixed models for
HTER and WPS. HTER goes up when more edits are per-
formed. WPS goes up when productivity increases.

The similarity of the HTER values is confirmed
by estimates in Table 3, where HTER is only
slightly higher for MT sentences (+ 1.702), while
the opposite happens in incorrect sentences, where
HTER is higher for HT revised sentences (+1.799).
We conclude that HTER does not provide evidence
of a lack of trust toward MT and that behaviours
observed for both translation methods are similar.

4.2 Words per second analysis

Figure 1 shows that WPS is higher for correct sen-
tences than for incorrect ones, while it is similar
for PE and revision in the two conditions.

As in Sect. 4.1, the p values in the WPS col-
umn of Table 2 confirm the statistically significant
effect of the two random effects (participant and
segment) on the dependent variable. However, in
this case neither the two fixed effects (translation
correctness and translation method), nor their in-
teraction have a significant effect. This means that
differences in terms of WPS between correct and
incorrect sentences are not statistically significant.
Similarly, significant differences between HT revi-
sion and PE were not found. When considering the
interaction of translation method and translation
correctness, WPS does not change significantly.

Looking at Table 3 we can see that, as expected,
participants were more productive on correct sen-
tences than on incorrect ones, but values do not
vary substantially. WPS is higher (+ 0.106) for cor-
rect MT sentences than for correct HT sentences,
while for incorrect sentences productivity in terms
of WPS is higher (+ 0.010) for HT than for MT.

Combining these results with those in Sect. 4.1,
we can confirm that students did not trust MT less
than HT or vice versa.

4.3 Qualitative analysis

Given that neither translation method nor its inter-
action with translation correctness were found to
significantly affect technical and temporal effort,
we performed a qualitative analysis on a subset of

the sentences. Segments with the highest differ-
ence between MT and HT in terms of mean HTER
were examined.

Concerning Example 1 in Table 4, in both re-
vision and PE, the same number of participants
made the right decision, i.e. no edits. In the HT
condition most of the participants who edited the
sentence only changed the preposition. In the MT
condition, terms were changed as well, resulting
in a higher HTER score for MT (25.6) than for HT
(17.3). Simlarly in Example 2, most post-editors
changed verb tenses or nominalised verbs. Mean
HTER was 11.4 for MT and 6.79 for HT: most re-
visers did not edit the sentence.

Regarding incorrect sentences that were edited
less in PE than revision, it would seem that revis-
ers paid more attention to issues in the text than
post-editors did. For example, all three occur-
rences of reaction in Example 3 should be plu-
ral and the term provided by the termbase is Alkyl
halides rather than Haloalkane. 58.3% of the re-
visers spotted both issues, while only 34.78% of
the post-editors did. As a result, mean HTER was
57.2 for HT revision and 43.4 for PE.

In Example 4, it would be sufficient to add the
word examination at the end. However, in the HT
condition most of the participants (54%) carried
out a number of other edits applying to the whole
sentence. Post-editors carried out unnecessary ed-
its to a lesser extent (4.8%), such that mean HTER
was 48.9 for HT and 43.8 for MT.

5 Discussion and limitations

In this contribution we have compared post-editor
and reviser trainees’ trust towards MT and HT
based on HTER and WPS (see Table 2 and 3). Ac-
cording to two linear models, significant changes
were only found between HTER on correct and in-
correct sentences.

No evidence of a lack of trust towards MT
emerged. This behaviour confirms the positive
opinion on MT stated in the pre-experiment ques-

tionnaire (see Table 1). This constructive attitude
and the ability to interact with technology may be
the result of greater awareness of the limits and
strengths of MT and PE practice, acquired as part
of their academic education (see Sect. 1 and 3.2).

While not significant, differences do exist, and
they can provide interesting insights for future
work. In correct sentences an increase in HTER
corresponds to an increase in WPS – and thus
in productivity – and in incorrect sentences a de-
crease in HTER corresponds to a decrease in WPS.
These fluctuations are to be expected, since HTER
is based on the number of edits, while WPS is
also related to cognitive effort. High HTER scores
are often linked to simple preferential changes
(see Sect. 4.3), e.g. nominalizations and stylis-
tic vocabulary variation. Such changes may be
costly in terms of HTER, but do not require long
searches or sentence restructuring – which would
be costly in terms of WPS as well. If segments
with complex terms are thoroughly checked with
a focus on terminology, edits are less costly in
terms of HTER than WPS, and discrepancies arise
between WPS and HTER. Since participants are
not expert in pharmacy or chemistry, terminology
searches would not suggest distrust, while prefer-
ential changes would. To investigate the presence
of preferential changes in the edits, future work
might focus on a more thorough qualitative analy-
sis, categorizing the changes introduced in the dif-
ferent conditions and the attention-needing points
in the raw output. A longer task would also be nec-
essary, which would however increase fatigue and
lead to possible adverse effects, especially since
volunteer translator trainees are involved.

In Sect. 3.2 we have seen that students’ profes-

sional experience is similar in both tasks, and that
they are acquainted with the basic notions of PE
practice. Their familiarity with revision is cer-
tainly greater, though, as this is a standard com-
ponent in translation courses at both BA and MA
level. The more limited familiarity with PE might
explain the WPS values obtained, which are high-
est for MT correct and lowest for MT incorrect.
When a mistake is spotted in an MT-translated sen-
tence, more time is spent choosing a strategy to
edit it whereas, when a sentence is correct, it is
quickly confirmed, as productivity is of the essence
in PE. For HT revision, WPS results are more sim-
ilar in both correctness conditions than is the case
in MT. The lowest productivity observed in the
MT incorrect condition would suggest that there
is still scope for improving translators/post-editors
trust in machine translation. More studies would
be needed to shed light on the complex and multi-
dimensional nature of trust. For example, pre-
and post-experiment questionnaires and interviews
could better clarify what participants expect from
a HT vs. an MT output, and why.

These observations and limitations should not
hide the main finding of this study, namely that
there are no significant differences between post-
editors’ and revisers’ trust. We would like to in-
terpret this as a sign that, after receiving train-
ing on this new technology and before entering
the translation industry, a new generation of trans-
lators does not seem to be affected by prejudice
against PEMT as much as one could expect.
