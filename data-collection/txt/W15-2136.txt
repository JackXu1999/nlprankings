Abstract

This paper analyses several points of inter-
lingual dependency mismatch on the ma-
terial of a parallel Czech-English depen-
dency treebank. Particularly, the points
of alignment mismatch between the va-
lency frame arguments of the correspond-
ing verbs are observed and described. The
attention is drawn to the question whether
such mismatches stem from the inherent
semantic properties of the individual lan-
guages, or from the character of the used
linguistic theory. Comments are made on
the possible shifts in meaning. The authors
use the findings to make predictions about
possible machine translation implementa-
tion of the data.

1 Introduction

In Machine translation tasks lately, paraphrases
have been used and studied intensely. They ba-
sically serve to improve the evaluation metrics of
MT systems. The ability to generate valid para-
phrases also plays an important role in informa-
tion retrieval tasks, textual entailment etc. The
so-called paraphrase tables can be automatically
extracted from parallel corpora (Denkowski and
Lavie, 2010; Ganitkevitch et al., 2013).

So far, only lexical paraphrases have been ex-
plored for Czech (Barančíková et al., 2014), with
syntactic (structural) paraphrases intended for fu-
ture enhancement of the systems. For English,
experiments with both lexical and syntactic para-
phrases are employed (Dorr et al., 2004).

This paper presents a preliminary linguistic
analysis of structural paraphrases based on va-
lency representations. It appears that certain
types of paraphrases affect the valency structure
of verbs, and possibly the semantic structure of

the sentence, in terms of foregrounding or back-
grounding different arguments.1

We believe that the analysis of possible syntac-
tic variation within paraphrases, especially such
that involves a kind of “disproportion”, in the par-
allel treebank data, would be beneficial for further
MT experiments.

By a disproportion in dependencies, we mean
such structural configurations that involve differ-
ent number of dependencies in corresponding syn-
tactic structures, i.e., an alignment of “something”
on one side of the translation to “nothing” on the
other side. For the purposes of this paper, we call
it a “zero alignment”.

2 Related Work

The analysis in this paper goes in a similar direc-
tion as that of (Sanguinetti et al., 2013), though
our interest in what they call a “translation shift”
is of a different kind. The authors claim that de-
pendency structures are finely apt to account for
the alignment of syntactically different treelets be-
tween languages, because of the subtree structures
constituting similar semantic units. We take their
findings as our starting point and provide a lin-
guistic analysis of some of the well-identified cat-
egories of translation shift from their research, in
order to get a better understanding of different lin-
guistic grounds for different syntactic structures
for a parallel semantic content. Also, our analy-
sis is based on the deep syntactic layer (in con-
trast to the surface structure alignments used in
the paper mentioned above), therefore it does not
have to deal with those structural phenomena that
might not have important semantic consequences,
but only serve for topic-focus hierarchization pur-
poses (such as word order variation, simple pas-
sivization etc.).

1Here, we use the label "argument" in a simplifying man-
ner. Any element which is included in the valency frame is
referred to as an argument.

Our research is also inspired by (Bojar et al.,
2013), an attempt to generate as many possible
translation paraphrases as possible, in order to en-
large the reference set of translations for MT eval-
uation purposes. The experiment described in the
paper used mostly a flat approach, and was car-
ried out with substantial work provided by human
annotators. We believe that our research might
help establish rules for automatic extraction of true
syntactic paraphrases (without unnecessary noise)
from parallel corpora, based on the valency pat-
terns of words, so that most of the work could be
done automatically, with minimal human control.

3 Methodology and Data

In the research, we took the advantage of the ex-
istence of Czech-English parallel data, namely the
Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank 2.5
(PCEDT 2.5) (Hajič et al., 2012).2

It is a collection of about 50 000 sentences,
taken from the Wall Street Journal part of
Penn treebank (Marcus et al., 1993),3 trans-
lated manually to Czech, transformed into de-
pendency trees and annotated at the level of
deep syntactic relations (called tectogrammatic
layer). In short, the tectogrammatic layer con-
tains mostly content words (with several defined
exceptions) connected with oriented edges and la-
belled with syntactico-semantic functors accord-
ing to the Functional Generative Description ap-
proach (FGD), see (Sgall et al., 1986). Ellipsis
and anaphora resolution is also included, as well
as automatic alignment of corresponding nodes.
The PCEDT 2.5 is annotated according to the the
FGD valency theory (FGDVT) and two valency
lexicons (one for each language) are part of the
release.

PDT-Vallex4 (Hajič et al., 2003; Urešová, 2011)
has been developed as a resource for annotating ar-
gument relations in the Prague Dependency Tree-
bank (Hajič et al., 2006). The version used here
contains 11,933 valency frames for 7,121 verbs.
Each valency frame in the PDT-Vallex represents
a distinct verb meaning. Valency frames consist
of argument slots represented by tectogrammatic
functors (slots). Each slot is marked as obligatory

PDT-Vallex

or facultative and its typical morphological real-
ization forms are listed. Frame entries are supple-
mented with illustrative sentence examples.

EngVallex5 (Cinková, 2006) was created as an
adaptation of an already existing resource of En-
glish verb argument structure characteristics, the
Propbank (Palmer et al., 2005). The original Prop-
bank argument structure frames have been adapted
to the FGD scheme, so that it currently bears the
structure of the PDT-Vallex, though some minor
deflections from the original scheme have been al-
lowed in order to save some important theoretical
features of the original Propbank annotation. This
lexicon includes 7,148 valency frames for 4,337
verbs.

PDT-Vallex and EngVallex have been inter-
linked together into a new resource called CzEng-
Vallex (Urešová et al., 2015a; Urešová et al.,
2015). Beside the complete data of the two
lexicons, the CzEngVallex contains a database
of frame-to-frame, and subsequently, argument-
to-argument pairs for the purposes of machine
translation experiments (Urešová et al., 2015b).
PCEDT and the CzEngVallex data have already
been used successfully in several MT experiments
aimed at valency frame detection and selection
(Dušek et al., 2014) and also for word sense dis-
ambiguation (Dušek et al., 2015).

The interlinking of CzEngVallex frames was
carried out via an annotation over the PCEDT.
First, an automatic alignment procedure was run
over the data, which suggested translational links
between nodes of the tectogrammatic layer. Cor-
responding verb pairs6 and argument pairs were
highlighted. Then, manual revision and correction
of the alignments by two annotators was carried
out. Thus, as a by-product of building the lexicon,
a collection of illustrative annotated tree pairs is
available for each verb pair of the CzEngVallex.

4 Zero Alignment in the Data

In the following sections, we will describe the
most important, consistent and frequent points of
zero alignment found in the data. For each section,
we will comment on the linguistic background of
the phenomena described and the possible conse-
quences for semantic interpretation in the individ-
ual languages.

6As a basic stage of building the CzEngVallex, only verb-
verb pairs were taken into account.

4.1 Catenative Verbs - Single vs. Double
Object Interpretation

One of the prominent points of alignment dispro-
portion in the data are sentences with catenative
verbs. Catenative verbs are usually defined as
those combining with non-finite verbal forms. Be-
tween the finite catenative verb and the non-finite
verb form, there might appear an intervening NP
that might be interpreted as the subject of the de-
pendent verbal form. In this section, we will be
concerned with exactly those verbs allowing the
sequence of a finite catenative verb – NP – a non-
finite catenative verb.

4.1.1 ECM Constructions, Raising to Object
Most Czech linguistic approaches do not recog-
nize the term Exceptional Case Marking (ECM)
in the sense of “raising to object”, instead they
generally address similar constructions under the
label “accusative with infinitive”. The difference
between ECM and control verbs is not being taken
into account in most of Czech grammars. In
short, raising and ECM are generally considered a
marginal phenomenon in Czech and are not being
treated conceptually (Panevová, 1996), except for
several attempts to describe agreement issues, e.g.,
the morphological behaviour of predicative com-
plements described in a phrase structure grammar
formalism (Przepiórkowski and Rosen, 2005).

The reason for this negligent approach to ECM
is probably rooted in the low frequency of ECM
constructions in Czech. Czech sentences corre-
sponding to English sentences with ECM mostly
do not allow catenative constructions. They usu-
ally involve a standard dependent clause with a fi-
nite verb, see Fig.1,7 or they include a nominaliza-
tion, thus keeping the structures strictly parallel.

The only exception are verbs of perception (see,
hear), which usually allow both ways of Czech
translation – with an accusative NP followed by
a non-finite verb form (1a), or with a dependent
clause (1b), not speaking about the third possibil-
ity involving an accusative NP followed by a de-
pendent clause (1c).

In this type of accusative-infinitive sequence,
the accusative element is in FGDVT analysed con-
sistently as the direct object of the matrix verb (the
PATient argument) and the non-finite verb form
then as the predicative complement of the verb
(the EFFect argument).

The PCEDT annotation of verbs of perception
is shown in Fig. 2, with frame arguments mapped
in the following way:

ACT→ACT; PAT→EFF; ---→PAT
The literature mentions two ways of ECM struc-

tural analysis, a flat one, representing the NP as
dependent on the matrix verb, and a layered one,
representing the intervening NP as the subject of
the dependent verb. This mirrors the opinion that
verbs allowing ECM usually have three syntactic,
but only two semantic arguments. It is then a mat-
ter of decision between a syntactic and semantic
approach to tree construction.

The English part of the PCEDT data was anno-
tated in the layered manner,8 thus most of the pairs
in the treebank appear as strictly parallel. The con-
sistency of structures is one of the most impor-

8The annotation followed the original phrasal annotation
of the data in the Penn Treebank.

tant advantages of the layered approach; there is
no need of having two distinct valency frames for
the two syntactic constructions of the verb, there-
fore, the semantic relatedness of the verb forms is
kept. Also, there are other specific constructions
supporting the layered analysis for English, like
the there-constructions intervening instead of the
NP, see (2).

(2) We expected there to be slow growth.

On the other hand, the Czech part of the PCEDT
data uses flat annotation, partly because the cate-
native construction with raising structure is fairly
uncommon in Czech (cf. Sect. 4.1.1). The flat
structure is easier to interpret, or translate in a
morphologically correct way to the surface real-
ization, but it requires multiple frames for seman-
tically similar verb forms (the instances of the verb
to see in see the house fall and see the house are
in the FGD valency approach considered two dis-
tinct lexical units) and it also leaves alignment
mismatches in the parallel data.

The treatment of ECM constructions in English
and in Czech is different. It reflects both the dif-
ferences internal to the languages and their conse-
quences in theoretical thinking. Contrary to En-
glish, Czech nouns carry strong indicators of mor-
phology – case, number and gender. The rules
for the subject-verb agreement block overt realiza-
tion of subjects of the infinitives. The accusative

ending naturally leads to the interpretation of the
presumed subject of the infinitive as the object
of the matrix verb. The morphosyntactic repre-
sentation is taken as a strong argument for us-
ing a flat structure in the semantic representation,
and a covert co-referential element for filling the
“empty” ACTor position of the infinitive. In En-
glish, in general, there is no such strong indication
and therefore the layered structure is preferred in
the semantic representation.

4.1.2 Object Control Verbs, Equi Verbs,
Causatives

Contrary to the ECM constructions, object control
verbs constructions (OCV), involving verbs such
as make, cause, or get, are analyzed strictly as
double-object in both languages, i.e., the interven-
ing NP is dependent on the matrix verb (and li-
censed by it) and there is usually a co-referential
empty element of some kind in the valency struc-
ture of the dependent verb form. OCV construc-
tions are similarly frequent in Czech and English
and their alignment in the PCEDT data is bal-
anced, see Fig. 3.9

Interestingly, it is sometimes the case that En-
glish control verbs in the treebank are trans-
lated with non-control, non-catenative verbs on
the Czech side, and the intervening NP is trans-
formed to a dependent of the lower verb of the de-
pendent clause (see Fig. 4), or even a more com-
plex nominalization of the dependent structure is
used.

The verb involved in this kind of translation
shift may be either a more remote synonym, or a
conversive verb.10

Such a translation shift brings about (at least a
slight) semantic shift in the interpretation, usually
in the sense of de-causativisation of the meaning
(prompt→lead to).11 Nevertheless, this type of se-
mantic shift does not prevent the use of the struc-

9In Fig. 3, English ACT of run does not show the coref-
erence link to water since the annotation of coreferential re-
lations has not yet been completed on the English side of the
PCEDT, as opposed to the Czech side (cf. the coreference
link from ACT of téci to voda).

10Semantic conversion in our understanding relates differ-
ent lexical units, or different meanings of the same lexical
unit, which share the same situational meaning. The valency
frames of conversive verbs can differ in the number and type
of valency complementations, their obligatoriness or mor-
phemic forms. Prototypically, semantic conversion involves
permutation of situational participants.

11Note that the de-causativisation process is possible with-
out objections whereas the reverse shift, from non-control
verb to a control verb, is rare if it at all exists.

ture as a sufficiently equivalent expression of the
semantic content. We approach this as an inherent
property of (any) language to suppress certain as-
pects of meaning without losing the general sense
of synonymity.

4.2 Complex Predication
By “complex predication” we mean a combination
of two lexical units, usually a (semantically empty,
or “light”) verb and a noun (carrying main lexi-
cal meaning and marked with CPHR functor in the
data), forming a predicate with a single semantic
reference, e.g., to make an announcement, to un-
dertake preparations, to get an order. There are
some direct consequences for the syntactically an-
notated parallel data.

First type of zero alignment is connected to the
fact that a complex predication in one language
can be easily translated with a one-word reference,
and consequently aligned to a one-word predica-
tion, in the other language. This is quite a triv-
ial case. In the data, then, one component of the
complex predication remains unaligned. There are
basically two ways of resolving such cases: either
one can align the light verb with the full verb in
the other language, or one can align the full verb

Figure 4: Alignment of English OCV with Czech
non-OCV construction

with the dependent noun in the complex predica-
tion, based on the similarity of semantic content.
In the CzEngVallex, the decision was to align the
verbs, reflecting the fact that the verb and the noun
phrase form a single unit from the semantic point
of view.

The second type of zero alignment is connected
to the presence of a “third” valency argument
within the complex predication structure, e.g., En:
placed weight on retailing - Cz: klást důraz na
prodej, see Fig. 5.

Complex predicates have been annotated ac-
cording to quite a complicated set of rules on the
Czech side of the PCEDT data (for details, see
(Mikulová et al., 2006)). Those rules include also
the so-called dual function of a valency modifica-
tion. There are two possible dependency positions
for the “third” valency argument of the complex
predicate: either it is modelled as the dependent
of the semantically empty verb, or as a dependent
of the nominal component. The decision between
the two positions rely on multiple factors, such as
valency structure of the semantically full use of
the verb, valency structure of the noun in other
contexts, behaviour of synonymous verbs etc. On
the Czech side, the “third” valency argument was
strongly preferred to be a dependent of the nomi-
nal component.

On the English side of the PCEDT, the preferred
decision was different. The “third” argument was
annotated as a direct dependent of the light verb

Figure 5: Mismatch due to complex predication
solution

(probably due to lower confidence of non-native
speaker annotators in judging verb valency issues).

There is probably no chance of dealing with the
dependencies in one of the two above stated ways
only. The class of complex predicates in the data is
wide and heterogeneous with respect to semantic
and morphosyntactic qualities. Nevertheless, the
data suggest several points of interesting inconsis-
tencies stemming from the imperfection or lack of
reliability of the theoretical guidelines. For exam-
ple, the dependency of the valency complementa-
tion of the complex predicate klást důraz ‘place
emphasis’, as can be seen in Fig. 5, is solved as
a dependency on the nominal component, whereas
in the complex predicate klást požadavek ‘place
claim’, the valency lexicon entry involves a direct
dependency on the verb. Keeping in mind that the
verb klást ‘to place’ has three arguments in its se-
mantically full occurrences, we would expect di-
rect dependency on the verb in both cases.

4.3 Conversive Verbs

A considerable number of unaligned arguments in
the data is caused by the translator’s choice of a
verb in a conversive relation to the verb used in
the original language. For some reason (e.g., fre-
quency of the verbal lexical unit, topic-focus artic-
ulation etc.), the translator decides not to use the

syntactically most similar lexical unit, but uses a
conversive one (cf. also Sect. 4.1.2), thus caus-
ing the arguments to relocate in the deep syntactic
structure, see Fig. 6.

Figure 6: Mismatch due to the the use of conver-
sive verbs

The relocation of arguments frequently goes
together with backgrounding of one of the ar-
guments, which then either disappears from the
translation, or is transformed into an adjunct, or
into a dependent argument embedded even lower
in the structure.

The first argument (actant)12 in the FGD ap-
proach is strongly underspecified. It is mostly de-
limited by its position in the tectogrammatic anno-
tation. Its prevalent morphosyntactic realization is
nominative case, but certain exceptions are recog-
nized (verbs of feeling etc.). Also, the ACT posi-
tion (first actant) is subject to the process called
“shifting of cognitive roles” (Panevová, 1974),
i.e., other semantic roles can take the nominative
case and the corresponding place in the structure

12Under the term “actant”, FGDVT distinguishes five core
constituting valency complementations, ACT, PAT, ADDR,
EFF, and ORIG.

in case there is no semantic agent in the structure.
Thus we get semantically quite different elements
(e.g., +anim vs. -anim) in the ACT position, even
with formally identical verb instances, see the En-
glish side of Figs. 7 and 8.

Figure 7: Conflict due to the underspecification of
the ACT position

This formal feature of the FGDVT gives rise
to a number of conflicts in the parallel structures
considering structures that undergo semantic de-
agentization or (milder) de-concretization of the
agent.

Here the question arises, whether such verb in-
stances correspond to different meanings of the
verb (represented by different verb frames), or
whether they correspond to a single meaning (rep-
resented by a single valency frame). It is often the
case, that the Czech data tend to overgeneralize the
valency frames through considering the different
instances as realizations of a single deep syntactic
valency frame, when there is no other modification
intervening in the frame. Therefore, this approach
chosen for the Czech annotation sometimes shows
a conflict, as in Fig. 7.

The valency structure for both instances of base
is identical, only in the first case, the verb is used
in active voice, whereas in the second case, it takes
passive morphology. There are three semantic ar-

guments in the structure. We will call them the
Person that expresses an opinion, the Expressed
Opinion and the Resource for the opinion. The
Person bases the Expressed Opinion on the Re-
source. With the English verb, the Expressed
Opinion always takes the PAT position and the Re-
source the ORIGin position in the valency struc-
ture. On the other hand, on the Czech side of the
data, there is a conflict. In both cases, there are
seemingly only two arguments. In the first case,
the Expressed Opinion is sort of backgrounded
from the semantic structure. If there were a need
of overtizing it, it would probably appear with
locative morphology, as an adjunct: Wertheimer
se v tomto opírá o prohlášení... ‘Wertheimer in
this relies on a statement’ (see also an authentic
example from the data in Fig. 9). In the sec-
ond case, on the other hand, the structure follows
the passivized English structure in backgrounding
the Person (note that the se morpheme does NOT
stand for a passive morphology here). If there
were a need for expressing the Person, it would

The problem of the status of a Czech verbal-
adjoining se-morpheme is a complex one and there
is no clear scientific consensus in this respect. The
se-morpheme in Czech has a variety of functions,
e.g., a passivization morpheme for the so-called
“reflexive passive” form, a “dispositional diathe-
sis” morpheme, a reflexive morpheme for lexical
derivation of impersonal verbal variants, or an ac-
cusative reflexive pronoun.

These variants differ with respect to the way
they are reflected in the data and in the lexicon.
Some are treated as individual verb lemmas, some
as surface variants of a common non-reflexive
lemma.

The conflicts in annotation have a substantial
reason – the ways in which English and Czech
express backgrounding of the agent are multiple
and they differ across the languages. Czech uses
the se-morphemization often, in order to preserve
the topic focus articulation (information) struc-
ture, whereas English does not have such a mor-
pheme to work with, so it often uses simple pas-
sivization, or middle construction.

Moreover, the first valency position in Czech
is often overgeneralized, allowing a multitude of
semantically different arguments, which is, due
to “economy of description”, sometimes not re-
flected in the linguistic theory.

4.4 Arguments Mapped to Adjuncts

In the previous section, we have described the
bilingual treebank data manifestation of the fact
that languages have different means of express-
ing a content, and we have noted that these can
also variate between argument and adjunct inter-
pretation. This variation appears both within a
single language (one language expresses a largely
synonymous content with either argument or ad-
junct means) and across languages (a direct con-
sequence of the former case: an argument (actant)
in one language can be translated into another lan-
guage using an adjunct construction). Languages
may differ in the preference for either of the pos-
sibilities.

Observing such mismatches in a parallel tree-
bank occasionally leads us to hesitate whether our
interpretation of a word (or phrase) as an argu-
ment or an adjunct is proper or justifiable. There
may be two possible consequences drawn from
the observation of a mismatch – either there are
some (rather subtle) semantic reasons for structur-
ing a word as an argument/adjunct, or there might
be some imperfection in our theoretical thinking
about the internal system of a particular language.

The theoretical distinction between arguments
and adjuncts is subject to serious debates in the
world of linguistics (Hwang, 2011; Tutunjian and
Boland, 2008), and so far there is no approach
known to us that would overcome this problem
easily. Still, we can see that the real data indicate
some remarkable points that stand at the roots of
the argument/adjunct distinction problem. Most
prominently - the nature of the relation between
the form of the argument and its semantics.

In the parallel treebank, we find cases (among

337



others) such as alignment of an actor with a tem-
poral adjunct (4) or an actor with a causal adjunct
(5), etc.

The interpretation of the argument in the above
stated examples is driven mainly by its morpho-
logical form, which is a surprising finding consid-
ering that we are dealing with deep syntax, or even
semantics.

It is believed that the form of the expression
more or less mirrors its function in the language.
The width of the paraphrasing range though, both
within and across languages, leads us to question-
ing whether it is appropriate to lay much stress on
the difference between arguments and adjuncts in
the description of a language.

5 Conclusion

We have encountered several reasons for the pres-
ence of a zero alignment in the data. Though these
reasons have different grounds they tend to be in-
terconnected in the language.

1. Language is flexible in paraphrasing linguis-
tic content with different syntactic means.
Even pairs of sentences which include se-
mantic backgrounding or foregrounding of
different arguments are easily interpreted as
synonymous.

2. It is possible to use predicates that are in a
conversive relation, or predicates of different
complexity.

3. The backgrounding and foregrounding of ar-
guments leads to syntactic relocation of other
arguments in the structure, and consequently

to the shift in their morphosyntactic proper-
ties, to the shift in their valency status, or
even to their complete disappearance from
the structure.

4. The FGD, having been built on a morpholog-
ically rich Czech language, relies strongly on
the morphosyntactic form of the individual
arguments. Therefore, disproportions of the
zero alignment or argument mismatch kind
must appear when it is applied to other lan-
guages with different typological properties.

Points 1, 2 and 3 belong among inherent deeply
rooted properties of (perhaps any) natural lan-
guage. Such differences are not to be overcome
by means of possible theoretical unification of de-
scription.

Point 4, on the other hand, belongs to the prop-
erties of a certain linguistic theory. We will leave
it open, whether it were appropriate to change the
very roots of a linguistic theory in order to make
it more flexible for use across different languages.
Nevertheless, it appears that it is at least possible
to change those aspects that cause individual and
otherwise unjustifiable conflicts in the data.
