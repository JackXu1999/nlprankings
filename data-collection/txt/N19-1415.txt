Abstract

While idiosyncrasies of the Chinese classi-
fier system have been a richly studied topic
among linguists (Adams and Conklin, 1973;
Erbaugh, 1986; Lakoff, 1986), not much work
has been done to quantify them with statisti-
cal methods. In this paper, we introduce an
information-theoretic approach to measuring
idiosyncrasy; we examine how much the un-
certainty in Mandarin Chinese classifiers can
be reduced by knowing semantic information
about the nouns that the classifiers modify.
Using the empirical distribution of classifiers
from the parsed Chinese Gigaword corpus
(Graff et al., 2005), we compute the mutual
information (in bits) between the distribution
over classifiers and distributions over other lin-
guistic quantities. We investigate whether se-
mantic classes of nouns and adjectives differ
in how much they reduce uncertainty in classi-
fier choice, and find that it is not fully idiosyn-
cratic; while there are no obvious trends for the
majority of semantic classes, shape nouns re-
duce uncertainty in classifier choice the most.

1 Introduction

Many of the world’s languages make use of nu-
meral classifiers (Aikhenvald, 2000). While theo-
retical debate still rages on the function of numeral
classifiers (Krifka, 1995; Ahrens and Huang, 1996;
Cheng et al., 1998; Chierchia, 1998; Li, 2000; Nis-
bett, 2004; Bale and Coon, 2014), it is generally ac-
cepted that they need to be present for nouns to be
modified by numerals, quantifiers, demonstratives,
or other qualifiers (Li and Thompson, 1981, 104).
In Mandarin Chinese, for instance, the phrase one
person translates as一个人 (yı̄ gè rén); the classi-
fier个 (gè) has no clear translation in English, yet,
nevertheless, it is necessary to place it between the
numeral一 (yı̄) and the word for person人 (rén).

There are hundreds of numeral classifiers in
the Mandarin lexicon (Po-Ching and Rimmington,

Classifier Pı̄nyı̄n Semantic Class

个 gè objects, general-purpose
件 jiàn matters
头 tóu domesticated animals
只 zhı̄ general animals
张 zhāng flat objects
条 tiáo long, narrow objects
项 xiàng items, projects

顿 dùn meals

Table 1: Examples of Mandarin classifiers. Classi-
fiers’ simplified Mandarin Chinese characters (1st col-
umn), pı̄nyı̄n pronunciations (2nd column), and com-
monly modified noun types (3rd column) are listed.

2015, Table 1 gives some canonical examples), and
classifier choices are often argued to be based on
inherent, possibly universal, semantic properties
associated with the noun, such as shape (Kuo and
Sera, 2009; Zhang and Jiang, 2016). Indeed, in
a summary article, Tai (1994) writes: “Chinese
classifier systems are cognitively based, rather than
arbitrary systems of classification.” If classifier
choice were solely based on conceptual features of
a given noun, then we might expect it to be nearly
determinate—like gender-marking on nouns in
German, Slavic, or Romance languages (Erbaugh,
1986, 400)—and perhaps even fixed for all of a
given noun’s synonyms.

However, selecting which classifers go with
nouns in practice is an idiosyncratic process, often
with several grammatical options (see Table 2
for two examples). Moreover, knowing what a
noun means doesn’t always mean you can guess
the classifier. For example, most nouns referring
to animals, such as 驴 (lú̈u, donkey) or 羊 (yáng,
goat), use the classifier只 (zhı̄). However, horses

位 (wèi) 0.4838 0.0058

chéng, project). Most of the probability mass is allo-
cated to only a few classifiers for both nouns (bolded).

cannot use 只 (zhı̄), despite being semantically
similar to goats and donkeys, and instead must
appear with匹 (pı̌). Conversely, knowing which
particular subset of noun meaning is reflected in
the classifer also doesn’t mean that you can use
that classifier with any noun that seems to have
the right semantics. For example, classifier 条
(tiáo) can be used with nouns referring to long and
narrow objects, like rivers, snakes, fish, pants, and
certain breeds of dogs—but never cats, regardless
of how long and narrow they might be! In general,
classifiers carve up the semantic space in a very
idiosyncratic manner that is neither fully arbitrary,
nor fully predictable from semantic features.

Given this, we can ask: precisely how idiosyn-
cratic is the Mandarin Chinese classifier system?
For a given noun, how predictable is the set of
classifiers that can be grammatically employed?
For instance, had we not known that the Mandarin
word for horse 马 (mǎ) predominantly takes the
classifier匹 (pı̌), how likely would we have been
to guess it over the much more common animal
classifier 只 (zhı̄)? Is it more important to know
that a noun is马 (mǎ) or simply that the noun is
an animal noun? We address these questions by
computing how much the uncertainty in the distri-
bution over classifiers can be reduced by knowing
information about nouns and noun semantics. We
quantify this notion of classifier idiosyncrasy by
calculating the mutual information between clas-
sifiers and nouns, and also between classifiers and
several sets that are relevant to noun meaning (i.e.,
categories of noun senses, sets of noun synonyms,
adjectives, and categories of adjective senses). Our
results yield concrete, quantitative measures of
idiosyncrasy in bits, that can supplement existing
hand-annotated, intuition-based approaches that
organize Mandarin classifiers into an ontology.

Why investigate the idiosyncrasy of the Man-
darin Chinese classifier system? How idiosyncratic
or predictable natural language is has captivated
researchers since Shannon (1951) originally pro-
posed the question in the context of printed En-
glish text. Indeed, looking at predictability directly
relates to the complexity of language—a funda-
mental question in linguistics (Newmeyer and Pre-
ston, 2014; Dingemanse et al., 2015)—which has
also been claimed to have consequences learnabil-
ity and processing. For example, how hard it is
for a learner to master irregularity, say, in the En-
glish past tense (Rumelhart and McClelland, 1987;
Pinker and Prince, 1994; Pinker and Ullman, 2002;
Kirov and Cotterell, 2018) might be affected by pre-
dictability, and highly predictable noun-adjacent
words, such as gender affixes in German and pre-
nominal adjectives in English, are also shown to
confer online processing advantages (Dye et al.,
2016, 2017, 2018). Within the Chinese classifier
system itself, the very common, general-purpose
classifier个 (gè) is acquired by children earlier than
rarer, more semantically rich ones (Hu, 1993). Gen-
eral classifiers are also found to occur more often
in corpora with nouns that are less predictable in
context (i.e., nouns with high surprisal; Hale 2001)
(Zhan and Levy, 2018), providing initial evidence
that predictability likely plays a role in classifier-
noun pairing more generally. Furthermore, pro-
viding classifiers improves participants’ recall
of nouns in laboratory experiments (Zhang and
Schmitt, 1998; Gao and Malt, 2009) (but see Huang
and Chen 2014)—but, it isn’t known whether clas-
sifiers do so by modulating noun predictability.

2 Quantifying Classifier Idiosyncrasy

We take an information-theoretic approach to
statistically quantify the idiosyncrasy of the Man-
darin Chinese classifier system, and measure the
uncertainty (entropy) reduction—or mutual infor-
mation (MI) (Cover and Thomas, 2012)—between
classifiers and other linguistic quantities, like
nouns or adjectives. Intuitively, MI lets us directly
measure classifier “idiosyncrasy”, because it tells
us how much information (in bits) about a classifier
we can get by observing another linguistic quantity.
If classifiers were completely independent from
other quantities, knowing them would give us no
information about classifier choice.

Notation. Let C be a classifier-valued random
variable with range C, the set of Mandarin Chinese



4102

classifiers. Let X be a second random variable,
which models a second linguistic quantity, with
range X . Mutual information (MI) is defined as

I(C;X) ≡ H(C)−H(C | X) (1a)

=
∑

c∈C,x∈X
p(c, x) log

p(c, x)

p(c)p(x)
(1b)

LetN and A denote the sets of nouns and adjec-
tives, respectively, with N and A be noun- and
adjective-valued random variables, respectively.
Let Ni and Ai denote the sets of nouns and adjec-
tives in ith SemCor supersense category for nouns
(Tsvetkov et al., 2015) and adjectives (Tsvetkov
et al., 2014), respectively, with their random vari-
ables being Ni and Ai, respectively. Let S be the
set of all English WordNet (Miller, 1998) senses
of nouns, with S be the WordNet sense-valued ran-
dom variable. Given the formula above and any
choice for X ∈ {N,A,Ni, Ai, S}, we can calcu-
late the mutual information between classifiers and
other relevant linguistic quantities.

2.1 MI between Classifiers and Nouns
Mutual information between classifiers and nouns
(I(C;N)) shows how much uncertainty (i.e., en-
tropy) in classifiers can be reduced once we know
the noun, and vice versa. Because only a few classi-
fiers are suitable to modify a given noun (again, see
Table 2) and the entropy of classifiers for a given
noun is predicted to be close to zero, MI between
classifiers and nouns is expected to be high.

2.2 MI Between Classifiers and Adjectives
The distribution over adjectives that modify a noun
in a large corpus give us a language-internal peek
into a word’s lexical semantics. Moreover, adjec-
tives have been found to increase the predictability
of nouns (Dye et al., 2018), so we ask whether
they might affect classifier predictability too. We
compute MI between classifiers and adjectives
(I(C;A)) that modify the same nouns to inves-
tigate their relationship. If both adjectives and
classifiers track comparable portions of the noun’s
semantics, we expect I(C;A) to be significantly
greater than zero, which implies mutual depen-
dence between classifier C and adjective A.

2.3 MI between Classifiers and Noun
Supersenses

To uncover which nouns are able to reduce the
uncertainty in classifiers more, we divide them

into 26 SemCor supersense categories (Tsvetkov
et al., 2015), and then compute I(C;Ni) (i ∈
{1, 2, ..., 26}) for each supersense category. The
supersense categories (e.g., animal, plant, person,
artifact, etc.) provide a semantic classification sys-
tem for English nouns. Since there are no known
supersense categories for Mandarin, we need to
translate Chinese nouns into English to perform our
analysis. We use SemCor supersense categories
instead of WordNet hypernyms because different
“basic levels” for each noun make it difficult to
determine the “correct” category for each noun.

2.4 MI between Classifiers and Adjective
Supersenses

We translated and divided the adjectives into 12
supersense categories (Tsvetkov et al., 2014),
and compute mutual information I(C;Ai) (i ∈
{1, 2, ..., 12}) for each category separately to de-
termine which categories have more mutual depen-
dence on classifiers. Adjective supersenses are de-
fined as categories describing certain properties of
nouns. For example, adjectives in MIND category
describe intelligence and awareness, while those
in the PERCEPTION category focus on, e.g., color,
brightness, and taste. Examining the distribution
over adjectives is a language-specific measure of
noun meaning, albeit an imperfect one, because
only certain adjectives modify any given noun.

2.5 MI between Classifiers and Noun Synsets

We also compute the mutual information I(C;S)
between classifiers and nouns’ WordNet (Miller,
1998) synonym sets (synsets), assuming that each
synset is independent. For nouns with multiple
synsets, we assume that all synsets are equally prob-
able for simplicity. If classifiers are fully semanti-
cally determined, then knowing a noun’s synsets
should enable one to know the appropriate classi-
fier(s), resulting in high MI. If classifiers are largely
idiosyncratic, then noun synsets should have lower
MI with classifiers. We do not use WordNet to
attempt to capture word polysemy here.

3 Data and Experiments

Data Provenance. We apply an existing neural
Mandarin word segmenter (Cai et al., 2017) to the
Chinese Gigaword corpus (Graff et al., 2005), and
then feed the segmented corpus to a neural depen-
dency parser, using Google’s pretrained Parsey Uni-

is compared to their entropies.

versal model on Mandarin.1 The model is trained
on Universal Dependencies datasets v1.3.2 We ex-
tract classifier-noun pairs and adjective-classifier-
noun triples from sentences, where the adjective
and the classifier modify the same noun—this is
easily determined from the parse. We also record
the tuple counts, and use them to compute an empir-
ical distribution over classifiers that modify nouns,
and noun-adjective pairs, respectively.

Data Preprocessing. Since no annotated super-
sense list exists for Mandarin, we first use CC-
CEDICT3 as a Mandarin Chinese-to-English dic-
tionary to translate nouns and adjectives into En-
glish. Acknowledging that translating might intro-
duce noise, we subsequently categorize our words
into different senses using the SemCor supersense
data for nouns (Miller et al., 1993; Tsvetkov et al.,
2015), and adjectives (Tsvetkov et al., 2014). Af-
ter that, we calculate the mutual information under
each noun, and adjective supersense.

Modeling Assumptions. As this contribution is
the first to investigate classifier predictability, we
make several simplifying assumptions. Extracting
distributions over classifiers from a large corpus,
as we do, ignores sentential context, which means
we ignore the fact that some nouns (i.e., relational
nouns, like māmā, Mom) are more likely to be
found in verb frames or other constructions where
classifiers are not needed. We also ignore singular-
plural, which might affect classifier choice, and the
mass-count distinction (Cheng et al., 1998; Bale
and Coon, 2014), to the extent that it is not en-
coded in noun superset categories (e.g., substance
includes mass nouns).

We also assume that every classifier-noun or
classifier-adjective pairing we extract is equally ac-
ceptable to native speakers. However, it’s possible
that native speakers differ in either their knowl-
edge of classifier-noun distributions or confidence

in particular combinations. Whether and how such
human knowledge interacts with our calculations
would be an interesting future avenue.

4 Results and Analysis

4.1 MI between Classifiers and Nouns, Noun
Synsets, and Adjectives

Table 3 shows MI between classifiers and other
linguistic quantities. As we can see, I(C;N) >
I(C;A) > I(C;S). As expected, knowing the
noun greatly reduces classifier uncertainty; the
noun and classifier have high MI (4.95 bits). Clas-
sifier MI with noun synsets (1.47 bits) is not com-
parable to with nouns (4.95 bits), suggesting that
knowing a synset does not greatly reduce classi-
fier uncertainty, leaving >3/5 of the entropy unac-
counted for. We also see that adjectives (2.08 bits)
reduce the uncertainty in classifiers more than noun
synsets (1.47 bits), but less than nouns (4.95 bits).

4.2 MI between Classifiers and Noun
Supersenses

Noun supersense results are in Figure 1. Natural
categories are helpful, but are far from completely
predictive of the classifier distribution: knowing
that a noun is a plant helps, but cannot account
for about 1/3 of the original entropy for the
distribution over classifiers, and knowing that a
noun is a location leaves >1/2 unexplained. The
three supersenses with highest I(C;N) are body,
artifact, and shape. Of particular interest is the
shape category. Knowing that a noun refers to a
shape (e.g.,角度; jiǎo dù, angle), makes the choice
of classifier relatively predictable. This result sheds
new light on psychological findings that Mandarin
speakers are more likely to classify words as
similar based on shape than English speakers (Kuo
and Sera, 2009), by uncovering a possible role for
information structure in shape-based choice. It
also accords with Chien et al. (2003) and Li et al.
(2010, 216) that show that children as young as
three know classifiers often delineate categories
of objects with similar shapes.

4.3 MI between Classifiers and Adjectives
Supersenses

Adjective supersense results are in Figure 2.
Interestingly, the top three senses that have the
highest mutual information between their adjec-
tives and classifiers—MIND, BODY (constitution,
appearance) and PERCEPTION—are all involved
with people’s subjective views. With respect
to Kuo and Sera (2009), adjectives from the
SPATIAL sense pick out shape nouns in our results.
Although it does not make it into the top three, MI
for the SPATIAL sense is still significant.

5 Conclusion

While classifier choice is known to be idiosyncratic,
no extant study has precisely quantified this. To
do so, we measure the mutual information between
classifiers and other linguistic quantities, and find
that classifiers are highly mutually dependent on
nouns, but are less mutually dependent on adjec-
tives and noun synsets. Furthermore, knowing
which noun or adjective supersense a word comes
from helps, often significantly, but still leaves much
of the original entropy in the classifier distribu-
tion unexplained, providing quantitative support
for the notion that classifier choice is largely id-
iosyncratic. Although the amount of mutual de-
pendence is highly variable across the semantic

classes we investigate, we find that knowing a noun
refers to a shape reduces uncertainty in classifier
choice more than knowing it falls into any other
semantic class, arguing for a role for information
structure in Mandarin speakers’ reliance on shape
(Kuo and Sera, 2009). This result might have im-
plications for second language pedagogy, adducing
additional, tentative evidence in favor of colloca-
tional approaches to teaching classifiers (Zhang and
Lu, 2013) that encourages memorizing classifiers
and nouns together. Investigating classifiers might
also provide cognitive scientific insights into con-
ceptual categorization (Lakoff, 1986)—often con-
sidered crucial for language use (Ungerer, 1996;
Taylor, 2002; Croft and Cruse, 2004). Studies like
this one opens up avenues for comparisons with
other phenomena long argued to be idiosyncratic,
such as grammatical gender, or declension class.
