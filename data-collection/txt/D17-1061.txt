Abstract

Search engines play an important role in
our everyday lives by assisting us in find-
ing the information we need. When we
input a complex query, however, results
are often far from satisfactory. In this
work, we introduce a query reformula-
tion system based on a neural network that
rewrites a query to maximize the number
of relevant documents returned. We train
this neural network with reinforcement
learning. The actions correspond to select-
ing terms to build a reformulated query,
and the reward is the document recall. We
evaluate our approach on three datasets
against strong baselines and show a rel-
ative improvement of 5-20% in terms of
recall. Furthermore, we present a simple
method to estimate a conservative upper-
bound performance of a model in a partic-
ular environment and verify that there is
still large room for improvements.

1 Introduction

Search engines help us find what we need among
the vast array of available data. When we request
some information using a long or inexact descrip-
tion of it, these systems, however, often fail to de-
liver relevant items. In this case, what typically
follows is an iterative process in which we try to
express our need differently in the hope that the
system will return what we want. This is a major
issue in information retrieval. For instance, Huang
and Efthimiadis (2009) estimate that 28-52% of
all the web queries are modifications of previous
ones.

To a certain extent, this problem occurs be-
cause search engines rely on matching words in
the query with words in relevant documents, to

Figure 1: A graphical illustration of the proposed
framework for query reformulation. A set of doc-
uments D0 is retrieved from a search engine using
the initial query q0. Our reformulator selects terms
from q0 and D0 to produce a reformulated query
q′ which is then sent to the search engine. Docu-
ments D′ are returned, and a reward is computed
against the set of ground-truth documents. The re-
formulator is trained with reinforcement learning
to produce a query, or a series of queries, to maxi-
mize the expected return.

perform retrieval. If there is a mismatch between
them, a relevant document may be missed.

One way to address this problem is to automati-
cally rewrite a query so that it becomes more likely
to retrieve relevant documents. This technique is
known as automatic query reformulation. It typi-
cally expands the original query by adding terms
from, for instance, dictionaries of synonyms such
as WordNet (Miller, 1995), or from the initial set
of retrieved documents (Xu and Croft, 1996). This
latter type of reformulation is known as pseudo (or
blind) relevance feedback (PRF), in which the rel-
evance of each term of the retrieved documents is
automatically inferred.

The proposed method is built on top of PRF but
differs from previous works as we frame the query

574



reformulation problem as a reinforcement learn-
ing (RL) problem. An initial query is the natural
language expression of the desired goal, and an
agent (i.e. reformulator) learns to reformulate an
initial query to maximize the expected return (i.e.
retrieval performance) through actions (i.e. select-
ing terms for a new query). The environment is a
search engine which produces a new state (i.e. re-
trieved documents). Our framework is illustrated
in Fig. 1.

The most important implication of this frame-
work is that a search engine is treated as a black
box that an agent learns to use in order to retrieve
more relevant items. This opens the possibility
of training an agent to use a search engine for a
task other than the one it was originally intended
for. To support this claim, we evaluate our agent
on the task of question answering (Q&A), citation
recommendation, and passage/snippet retrieval.

As for training data, we use two publicly avail-
able datasets (TREC-CAR and Jeopardy) and in-
troduce a new one (MS Academic) with hundreds
of thousands of query/relevant document pairs
from the academic domain.

Furthermore, we present a method to estimate
the upper bound performance of our RL-based
model. Based on the estimated upper bound, we
claim that this framework has a strong potential
for future improvements.

Here we summarize our main contributions:

• A reinforcement learning framework for au-
tomatic query reformulation.

• A simple method to estimate the upper-bound
performance of an RL-based model in a given
environment.

• A new large dataset with hundreds of thou-
sands of query/relevant document pairs.1

2 A Reinforcement Learning Approach

2.1 Model Description

In this section we describe the proposed method,
illustrated in Fig. 2.

The inputs are a query q0 consisting of a se-
quence of words (w1, ..., wn) and a candidate term
ti with some context words (ti−k, ..., ti+k), where
k ≥ 0 is the context window size. Candidate terms

are from q0 ∪ D0, the union of the terms in the
original query and those from the documents D0
retrieved using q0.

We use a dictionary of pretrained word embed-
dings (Mikolov et al., 2013) to convert the sym-
bolic terms wj and ti to their vector representa-
tions vj and ei ∈ Rd, respectively. We map out-
of-vocabulary terms to an additional vector that is
learned during training.

We convert the sequence {vj} to a fixed-size
vector φa(v) by using either a Convolutional Neu-
ral Network (CNN) followed by a max pooling op-
eration over the entire sequence (Kim, 2014) or by
using the last hidden state of a Recurrent Neural
Network (RNN).2

Similarly, we fed the candidate term vectors
ei to a CNN or RNN to obtain a vector repre-
sentation φb(ei) for each term ti. The convolu-
tional/recurrent layers serve an important role of
capturing context information, especially for out-
of-vocabulary and rare terms. CNNs can pro-
cess candidate terms in parallel, and, therefore, are
faster for our application than RNNs. RNNs, on
the other hand, can encode longer contexts.

Finally, we compute the probability of selecting

pad smaller ones with zeros on both ends so they end up as
long as the largest sample in the mini-batch.

ti as:

P (ti|q0) = σ(UT tanh(W (φa(v)‖φb(ei)) + b)),
(1)

where σ is the sigmoid function, ‖ is the vector
concatenation operation, W ∈ Rd×2d and U ∈ Rd
are weights, and b ∈ R is a bias.

At test time, we define the set of terms used in
the reformulated query as T = {ti | P (ti|q0) >
�}, where � is a hyper-parameter. At training time,
we sample the terms according to their probability
distribution, T = {ti | α = 1∧α ∼ P (ti|q0)}. We
concatenate the terms in T to form a reformulated
query q′, which will then be used to retrieve a new
set of documents D′.

2.2 Sequence Generation
One problem with the method previously de-
scribed is that terms are selected independently.
This may result in a reformulated query that con-
tains duplicated terms since the same term can ap-
pear multiple times in the feedback documents.
Another problem is that the reformulated query
can be very long, resulting in a slow retrieval.

To solve these problems, we extend the model to
sequentially generate a reformulated query, as pro-
posed by Buck et al. (2017). We use a Recurrent
Neural Network (RNN) that selects one term at a
time from the pool of candidate terms and stops
when a special token is selected. The advantage of
this approach is that the model can remember the
terms previously selected through its hidden state.
It can, therefore, produce more concise queries.

We define the probability of selecting ti as the
k-th term of a reformulated query as:

P (tki |q0) ∝ exp(φb(ei)Thk), (2)
where hk is the hidden state vector at the k-th step,
computed as:

hk = tanh(Waφa(v) +Wbφb(tk−1) +Whhk−1),
(3)

where tk−1 is the term selected in the previous
step and Wa ∈ Rd×d, Wb ∈ Rd×d, and Wh ∈
Rd×d are weight matrices. In practice, we use an
LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) to en-
code the hidden state as this variant is known to
perform better than a vanilla RNN.

We avoid normalizing over a large vocabulary
by using only terms from the retrieved documents.
This makes inference faster and training practi-
cal since learning to select words from the whole

vocabulary might be too slow with reinforcement
learning, although we leave this experiment for a
future work.

2.3 Training
We train the proposed model using REIN-
FORCE (Williams, 1992) algorithm. The per-
example stochastic objective is defined as

Ca = (R− R̄)
∑
t∈T
− logP (t|q0), (4)

where R is the reward and R̄ is the baseline, com-
puted by the value network as:

R̄ = σ(ST tanh(V (φa(v)‖ē) + b)), (5)
where ē = 1N

∑N
i=1 φb(ei), N = |q0 ∪ D0|, V ∈

Rd×2d and S ∈ Rd are weights and b ∈ R is a
bias. We train the value network to minimize

Cb = α||R− R̄||2, (6)
where α is a small constant (e.g. 0.1) multiplied to
the loss in order to stabilize learning. We conjec-
ture that the stability is due to the slowly evolving
value network which directly affects the learning
of the policy. This effectively prevents the value
network to fit extreme cases (unexpectedly high or
low reward.)

We minimize Ca and Cb using stochastic gra-
dient descent (SGD) with the gradient computed
by backpropagation (Rumelhart et al., 1988). This
allows the entire model to be trained end-to-end
directly to optimize the retrieval performance.

Entropy Regularization We observed that the
probability distribution in Eq.(1) became highly
peaked in preliminary experiments. This phe-
nomenon led to the trained model not being able
to explore new terms that could lead to a better-
reformulated query. We address this issue by reg-
ularizing the negative entropy of the probability
distribution. We add the following regularization
term to the original cost function in Eq. (4):

CH = −λ
∑

t∈q0∪D0
P (t|q0) logP (t|q0), (7)

where λ is a regularization coefficient.

3 Related Work

Query reformulation techniques are either based
on a global method, which ignores a set of doc-
uments returned by the original query, or a local

576



method, which adjusts a query relative to the doc-
uments that initially appear to match the query. In
this work, we focus on local methods.

A popular instantiation of a local method
is the relevance model, which incorporates
pseudo-relevance feedback into a language model
form (Lavrenko and Croft, 2001). The proba-
bility of adding a term to an expanded query is
proportional to its probability of being generated
by the language models obtained from the orig-
inal query and the document the term occurs in.
This framework has the advantage of not requiring
query/relevant documents pairs as training data
since inference is based on word co-occurrence
statistics.

Unlike the relevance model, algorithms can
be trained with supervised learning, as proposed
by Cao et al. (2008). A training dataset is auto-
matically created by labeling each candidate term
as relevant or not based on their individual contri-
bution to the retrieval performance. Then a binary
classifier is trained to select expansion terms. In
Section 4, we present a neural network-based im-
plementation of this supervised approach.

A generalization of this supervised framework
is to iteratively reformulate the query by selecting
one candidate term at each retrieval step. This can
be viewed as navigating a graph where the nodes
represent queries and associated retrieved results
and edges exist between nodes whose queries are
simple reformulations of each other (Diaz, 2016).
However, it can be slow to reformulate a query this
way as the search engine must be queried for each
newly added term. In our method, on the con-
trary, the search engine is queried with multiple
new terms at once.

An alternative technique based on supervised
learning is to learn a common latent representation
of queries and relevant documents terms by us-
ing a click-through dataset (Sordoni et al., 2014).
Neighboring document terms of a query in the la-
tent space are selected to form an expanded query.
Instead of using a click-through dataset, which is
often proprietary, it is possible to use an alterna-
tive dataset consisting of anchor text/title pairs. In
contrast, our approach does not require a dataset of
paired queries as it learns term selection strategies
via reinforcement learning.

Perhaps the closest work to ours is that by
Narasimhan et al. (2016), in which a reinforce-
ment learning based approach is used to reformu-

late queries iteratively. A key difference is that
in their work the reformulation component uses
domain-specific template queries. Our method, on
the other hand, assumes open-domain queries.

4 Experiments

In this section we describe our experimental setup,
including baselines against which we compare the
proposed method, metrics, reward for RL-based
models, datasets and implementation details.

4.1 Baseline Methods

Raw: The original query is given to a search
engine without any modification. We evaluate
two search engines in their default configura-
tion: Lucene3 (Raw-Lucene) and Google Search4

(Raw-Google).

Pseudo Relevance Feedback (PRF-TFIDF):
A query is expanded with terms from the docu-
ments retrieved by a search engine using the orig-
inal query. In this work, the top-N TF-IDF terms
from each of the top-K retrieved documents are
added to the original query, where N and K are
selected by a grid search on the validation data.

PRF-Relevance Model (PRF-RM): This is a
popular relevance model for query expansion
by Lavrenko and Croft (2001). The probability of
using a term t in an expanded query is given by:

P (t|q0) = (1− λ)P ′(t|q0)
+ λ

∑
d∈D0

P (d)P (t|d)P (q0|d), (8)

where P (d) is the probability of retrieving the
document d, assumed uniform over the set, P (t|d)
and P (q0|d) are the probabilities assigned by the
language model obtained from d to t and q0, re-
spectively. P ′(t|q0) = tf(t∈q)|q| , where tf(t, d) is the
term frequency of t in d. We set the interpolation
parameter λ to 0.5, following Zhai and Lafferty
(2001).

We use a Dirichlet smoothed language
model (Zhai and Lafferty, 2001) to compute a
language model from a document d ∈ D0:

P (t|d) = tf(t, d) + uP (t|C)|d|+ u , (9)

3https://lucene.apache.org/
4https://cse.google.com/cse/

577



where u is a scalar constant (u = 1500 in our ex-
periments), and P (t|C) is the probability of t oc-
curring in the entire corpus C.

We use the N terms with the highest P (t|q0) in
an expanded query, whereN is a hyper-parameter.

Embeddings Similarity: Inspired by the meth-
ods proposed by Roy et al. (2016) and Kuzi et al.
(2016), the top-N terms are selected based on
the cosine similarity of their embeddings against
the original query embedding. Candidate terms
come from documents retrieved using the orig-
inal query (PRF-Emb), or from a fixed vocab-
ulary (Vocab-Emb). We use pretrained embed-
dings from Mikolov et al. (2013), and it contains
374,000 words.

4.2 Proposed Methods
Supervised Learning (SL): Here we detail a
deep learning-based variant of the method pro-
posed by Cao et al. (2008). It assumes that query
terms contribute independently to the retrieval per-
formance. We thus train a binary classifier to se-
lect a term if the retrieval performance increases
beyond a preset threshold when that term is added
to the original query. More specifically, we mark a
term as relevant if (R′ −R)/R > 0.005, where R
and R′ are the retrieval performances of the orig-
inal query and the query expanded with the term,
respectively.

We experiment with two variants of this
method: one in which we use a convolutional net-
work for both original query and candidate terms
(SL-CNN), and the other in which we replace the
convolutional network with a single hidden layer
feed-forward neural network (SL-FF). In this vari-
ant, we average the output vectors of the neural
network to obtain a fixed size representation of q0.

Reinforcement Learning (RL): We use multi-
ple variants of the proposed RL method. RL-CNN
and RL-RNN are the models described in Sec-
tion 2.1, in which the former uses CNNs to encode
query and term features and the latter uses RNNs
(more specifically, bidirectional LSTMs). RL-FF
is the model in which term and query vectors are
encoded by single hidden layer feed-forward neu-
ral networks. In the RL-RNN-SEQ model, we add
the sequential generator described in Section 2.2
to the RL-RNN variant.

4.3 Datasets
We summarize in Table 1 the datasets.

TREC - Complex Answer Retrieval (TREC-
CAR) This is a publicly available dataset auto-
matically created from Wikipedia whose goal is
to encourage the development of methods that re-
spond to more complex queries with longer an-
swers (Dietz and Ben, 2017). A query is the con-
catenation of an article title and one of its section
titles. The ground-truth documents are the para-
graphs within that section. For example, a query
is “Sea Turtle, Diet” and the ground truth docu-
ments are the paragraphs in the section “Diet” of
the “Sea Turtle” article. The corpus consists of all
the English Wikipedia paragraphs, except the ab-
stracts. The released dataset has five predefined
folds, and we use the first three as the training set
and the remaining two as validation and test sets,
respectively.

Jeopardy This is a publicly available Q&A
dataset introduced by Nogueira and Cho (2016). A
query is a question from the Jeopardy! TV Show
and the corresponding document is a Wikipedia
article whose title is the answer. For example,
a query is “For the last eight years of his life,
Galileo was under house arrest for espousing this
mans theory” and the answer is the Wikipedia arti-
cle titled “Nicolaus Copernicus”. The corpus con-
sists of all the articles in the English Wikipedia.

Microsoft Academic (MSA) This dataset con-
sists of academic papers crawled from Microsoft
Academic API.5 The crawler started at the pa-
per Silver et al. (2016) and traversed the graph of
references until 500,000 papers were crawled. We
then removed papers that had no reference within
or whose abstract had less than 100 characters. We
ended up with 480,000 papers.

A query is the title of a paper, and the ground-
truth answer consists of the papers cited within.
Each document in the corpus consists of its title
and abstract.6

4.4 Metrics and Reward

Three metrics are used to evaluate performance:

Recall@K: Recall of the top-K retrieved docu-
ments:

R@K =
|DK ∩D∗|
|D∗| , (10)

us/academic-knowledge-api

6This was done to avoid a large computational overhead
for indexing full papers.

where DK are the top-K retrieved documents and
D∗ are the relevant documents. Since one of the
goals of query reformulation is to increase the pro-
portion of relevant documents returned, recall is
our main metric.

Precision@K: Precision of the top-K retrieved
documents:

P@K =
|DK ∩D∗|
|DK | (11)

Precision captures the proportion of relevant doc-
uments among the returned ones. Despite not be-
ing the main goal of a reformulation method, im-
provements in precision are also expected with a
good query reformulation method. Therefore, we
include this metric.

Mean Average Precision: The average preci-
sion of the top-K retrieved documents is defined
as:

AP@K =
∑K

k=1 P@k × rel(k)
|D∗| , (12)

where

rel(k) =

{
1, if the k-th document is relevant;
0, otherwise.

(13)

The mean average precision of a set of queries Q
is then:

MAP@K =
1
|Q|

∑
q∈Q

AP@Kq, (14)

where AP@Kq is the average precision at K for a
query q. This metric values the position of a rele-
vant document in a returned list and is, therefore,
complementary to precision and recall.

Reward We use R@K as a reward when train-
ing the proposed RL-based models as this metric
has shown to be effective in improving the other
metrics as well.

SL-Oracle In addition to the baseline methods
and proposed reinforcement learning approach,
we report two oracle performance bounds. The
first oracle is a supervised learning oracle (SL-
Oracle). It is a classifier that perfectly selects
terms that will increase performance according to
the procedure described in Section 4.2. This mea-
sure serves as an upper-bound for the supervised
methods. Notice that this heuristic assumes that
each term contributes independently from all the
other terms to the retrieval performance. There
may be, however, other ways to explore the de-
pendency of terms that would lead to a higher per-
formance.

SL-Oracle 13% 5% 11%
RL-Oracle 29% 27% 31%

Table 3: Percentage of relevant terms over all the
candidate terms according to SL- and RL-Oracle.

RL-Oracle Second, we introduce a reinforce-
ment learning oracle (RL-Oracle) which estimates
a conservative upper-bound performance for the
RL models. Unlike the SL-Oracle, it does not
assume that each term contributes independently
to the retrieval performance. It works as follows:
first, the validation or test set is divided into N
small subsets {Ai}Ni=1 (each with 100 examples,
for instance). An RL model is trained on each sub-
set Ai until it overfits, that is, until the reward R∗i
stops increasing or an early stop mechanism ends
training.7 Finally, we compute the oracle perfor-
mance R∗ as the average reward over all the sub-
sets: R∗ = 1N

∑N
i=1R

∗
i .

This upper bound by the RL-Oracle is, however,
conservative since there might exist better refor-
mulation strategies that the RL model was not able
to discover.

4.5 Implementation Details
Search engine We use Lucene and BM25 as the
search engine and the ranking function, respec-
tively, for all PRF, SL and RL methods. For Raw-
Google, we restrict the search to the wikipedia.org
domain when evaluating its performance on the
Jeopardy dataset. We could not apply the same re-
striction to the two other datasets as Google does
not index Wikipedia paragraphs, and as it is not
trivial to match papers from MS Academic to the
ones returned by Google Search.

Candidate terms We use Wikipedia articles as
a source for candidate terms since it is a well cu-
rated, clean corpus, with diverse topics.

At training and test times of SL methods,
and at test time of RL methods, the candidate
terms are from the first M words of the top-K
Wikipedia articles retrieved. We select M and
K using grid search on the validation set over
{50, 100, 200, 300} and {1, 3, 5, 7}, respectively.
The best values are M = 300 and K = 7. These
correspond to the maximum number of terms we
could fit in a single GPU.

7The subset should be small enough, or the model should
be large enough so it can overfit.

Figure 3: Our RL-based model continues to im-
prove recall as more candidate terms are added,
whereas a classical PRF method saturates.

At training time of an RL model, we use only
one document uniformly sampled from the top-K
retrieved ones as a source for candidate terms, as
this leads to a faster learning.

For the PRF methods, the top-M terms ac-
cording to a relevance metric (i.e., TF-IDF for
PRF-TFIDF, cosine similarity for PRF-Emb, and
conditional probability for PRF-RM) from each
of the top-K retrieved documents are added to
the original query. We select M and K using
grid search over {10, 50, 100, 200, 300, 500} and
{1, 3, 5, 9, 11}, respectively. The best values are
M = 300 and K = 9.

Multiple Reformulation Rounds Although our
framework supports multiple rounds of search and
reformulation, we did not find any significant im-
provement in reformulating a query more than
once. Therefore, the numbers reported in the re-
sults section were all obtained from models run-
ning two rounds of search and reformulation.

Neural Network Setup For SL-CNN and RL-
CNN variants, we use a 2-layer convolutional net-
work for the original query. Each layer has a win-
dow size of 3 and 256 filters. We use a 2-layer con-
volutional network for candidate terms with win-
dow sizes of 9 and 3, respectively, and 256 filters
in each layer. We set the dimension d of the weight
matrices W,S,U , and V to 256. For the opti-
mizer, we use ADAM (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with
α = 10−4, β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.999, and � = 10−8.
We set the entropy regularization coefficient λ to
10−3.

For RL-RNN and RL-RNN-SEQ, we use a 2-
layer bidirectional LSTM with 256 hidden units
in each layer. We clip the gradients to unit norm.
For RL-RNN-SEQ, we set the maximum possible

number of generated terms to 50 and we use beam
search of size four at test time.

We fix the dictionary of pre-trained word em-
beddings during training, except the vector for out-
of-vocabulary words. We found that this led to
faster convergence and observed no difference in
the overall performance when compared to learn-
ing embeddings during training.

5 Results and Discussion

Table 2 shows the main result. As expected, re-
formulation based methods work better than us-
ing the original query alone. Supervised methods
(SL-FF and SL-CNN) have in general a better per-
formance than unsupervised ones (PRF-TFIDF,
PRF-RM, PRF-Emb, and Emb-Vocab), but per-
form worse than RL-based models (RL-FF, RL-
CNN, RL-RNN, and RL-RNN-SEQ).

RL-RNN-SEQ performs slightly worse than
RL-RNN but produces queries that are three times
shorter, on average (15 vs 47 words). Thus, RL-
RNN-SEQ is faster in retrieving documents and
therefore might be a better candidate for a produc-
tion implementation.

The performance gap between the oracle and
best performing method (Table 2, RL-Oracle vs.
RL-RNN) suggests that there is a large room for
improvement. The cause for this gap is unknown
but we suspect, for instance, an inherent difficulty
in learning a good selection strategy and the par-
tial observability from using a black box search
engine.

5.1 Relevant Terms per Document

The proportion of relevant terms selected by the
SL- and RL-Oracles over the total number of can-
didate terms (Table 3) indicates that only a small
subset of terms are useful for the reformulation.
Thus, we may conclude that the proposed method
was able to learn an efficient term selection strat-
egy in an environment where relevant terms are
infrequent.

5.2 Scalability: Number of Terms vs Recall

Fig. 3 shows the improvement in recall as more
candidate terms are provided to a reformulation
method. The RL-based model benefits from
more candidate terms, whereas the classical PRF
method quickly saturates. In our experiments, the
best performing RL-based model uses the maxi-
mum number of candidate terms that we could fit

provements with more computational resources.

5.3 Qualitative Analysis

We show two examples of queries and the proba-
bilities of each candidate term of being selected by
the RL-CNN model in Fig. 4.

Notice that terms that are more related to the
query have higher probabilities, although common
words such as ”the” are also selected. This is a
consequence of our choice of a reward that does

not penalize the selection of neutral terms.
In Table 4 we show an original and reformu-

lated query examples extracted from the MS Aca-
demic and TREC-CAR datasets, and their top-3
retrieved documents. Notice that the reformulated
query retrieves more relevant documents than the
original one. As we conjectured earlier, we see
that a search engine tends to return a document
simply with the largest overlap in the text, neces-
sitating the reformulation of a query to retrieve se-
mantically relevant documents.

Same query, different tasks We compare in Ta-
ble 5 the reformulation of a sample query made by
models trained on different datasets. The model
trained on TREC-CAR selects terms that are sim-
ilar to the ones in the original query, such as
“serves” and “accreditation”. These selections are
expected for this task since similar terms can be
effective in retrieving similar paragraphs. On the
other hand, the model trained on Jeopardy prefers
to select proper nouns, such as “Tunxis”, as these
have a higher chance of being an answer to the
question. The model trained on MSA selects terms
that cover different aspects of the entity being
queried, such as “arts center” and “library”, since
retrieving a diverse set of documents is necessary
for the task the of citation recommendation.

5.4 Training and Inference Times

Our best model, RL-RNN, takes 8-10 days to train
on a single K80 GPU. At inference time, it takes

approximately one second to reformulate a batch
of 64 queries. Approximately 40% of this time is
to retrieve documents from the search engine.

6 Conclusion

We introduced a reinforcement learning frame-
work for task-oriented automatic query reformu-
lation. An appealing aspect of this framework is
that an agent can be trained to use a search en-
gine for a specific task. The empirical evaluation
has confirmed that the proposed approach outper-
forms strong baselines in the three separate tasks.
The analysis based on two oracle approaches has
revealed that there is a meaningful room for fur-
ther development. In the future, more research is
necessary in the directions of (1) iterative refor-
mulation under the proposed framework, (2) using
information from modalities other than text, and
(3) better reinforcement learning algorithms for a
partially-observable environment.
