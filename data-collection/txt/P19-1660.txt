Abstract

In this work, we propose a novel approach that
predicts the relationships between various en-
tities in an image in a weakly supervised man-
ner by relying on image captions and object
bounding box annotations as the sole source
of supervision. Our proposed approach uses
a top-down attention mechanism to align en-
tities in captions to objects in the image, and
then leverage the syntactic structure of the cap-
tions to align the relations. We use these
alignments to train a relation classification net-
work, thereby obtaining both grounded cap-
tions and dense relationships. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our model on the Visual
Genome dataset by achieving a recall@50 of
15% and recall@100 of 25% on the relation-
ships present in the image. We also show that
the model successfully predicts relations that
are not present in the corresponding captions.

1 Introduction

Scene graphs serve as a convenient representation
to capture the entities in an image and the relation-
ships between them, and are useful in a variety of
settings (for example, Johnson et al. (2015); Ander-
son et al. (2016); Liu et al. (2017)). While the last
few years have seen considerable progress in classi-
fying the contents of an image and segmenting the
entities of interest without much supervision (He
et al., 2017), the task of identifying and understand-
ing the way in which entities in an image interact
with each other without much supervision remains
little explored.

Recognizing relationships between entities is
non-trivial because the space of possible relation-
ships is immense, and because there are O(n2)
relationships possible when n objects are present
in an image. On the other hand, while image
captions are easier to obtain, they are often not

completely descriptive of an image (Krishna et al.,
2017). Thus, simply parsing a caption to extract
relationships from them is likely to not sufficiently
capture the rich content and detailed spatial rela-
tionships present in an image.

Since different images have different objects and
captions, we believe it is possible to get the informa-
tion that is not present in the caption of one image
from other similar images which have the same
objects and their captions. In this work, we thus
aim to learn the relationships between entities in an
image by utilizing only image captions and object
locations as the source of supervision. Given that
generating a good caption in an image requires one
to understand the various entities and the relation-
ships between them, we hypothesize that an image
caption can serve as an effective weak supervisory
signal for relationship prediction.

2 Related work

The task of Visual Relationship Detection has been
the main focus of several recent works (Lu et al.,
2016; Li et al., 2017a; Zhang et al., 2017a; Dai
et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2017; Liang et al., 2017;
Yin et al., 2018). The goal is to detect a generic
<subject, predicate, object> triplet present in an
image. Various techniques have been proposed to
solve this task, such as by using language priors
(Lu et al., 2016; Yatskar et al., 2016), deep net-
work models (Zhang et al., 2017a; Dai et al., 2017;
Zhu and Jiang, 2018; Yin et al., 2018), referring
expressions (Hu et al., 2017; Cirik et al., 2018) and
reinforcement learning (Liang et al., 2017). Recent
work has also studied the closely related problem of
Scene Graph Generation, (Li et al., 2017b; Newell
and Deng, 2017; Xu et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2017,
2018). The major limitation of the aforementioned
techniques is that they are supervised, and require
the presence of ground truth scene graphs or rela-

tion annotations. Obtaining these annotations can
be an extremely tedious and time consuming pro-
cess that often needs to be done manually. Our
model in contrast does the same task through weak
supervision, which makes this annotation signifi-
cantly easier.

Most similar to our current task is work in the do-
main of Weakly Supervised Relationship Detection.
Peyre et al. (2017) uses weak supervision to learn
the visual relations between the pairs of objects in
an image using a weakly supervised discriminative
clustering objective function (Bach and Harchaoui,
2008), while Zhang et al. (2017b) uses a region-
based fully convolutional network neural network
to perform the same task. They both use <subject,
predicate, object> annotations without any explicit
grounding in the images as the source of weak su-
pervision, but require these annotations in the form
of image-level triplets. Our task, however, is more
challenging, because free-form captions can poten-
tially be both extremely unstructured and signifi-
cantly less informative than annotated structured
relations.

3 Proposed Approach

Our proposed approach consists of three sequential
modules: a feature extraction module, a grounding
module and a relation classifier module. Given the
alignments found by the grounding module, we
train the relation classifier module, which takes in
a pair of object features and classifies the relation
between them.

3.1 Feature Extraction
Given an image I with n objects and their ground
truth bounding boxes {b1, b2, . . . , bn}, the feature
extraction module extracts their feature representa-
tions F = {f1, f2, . . . , fn}. To avoid using ground
truth instance-level class annotations that would
be required to train an object detector, we use a
ResNet-152 network pre-trained on ImageNet as
our feature extractor. For every object i, we crop
and resize the portion of the image I corresponding
to the bounding box bi and feed it to the ResNet
model to get its feature representation fi. fi is a
dense d-dimensional vector capturing the semantic
information of the ith object. Note that we do not
fine-tune the ResNet architecture.

3.2 Grounding Caption Words to Object
Features

Given an image I , its caption consisting of words
W = {w1, w2 . . . , wk} and the feature represen-
tations F obtained above, the grounding module
aligns the entities and relations found in the cap-
tions with the objects’ features and the features
corresponding to pairs of objects in the image. It
thus aims to find the subset of words in the cap-
tion corresponding to entities E ✓ W | E =
{ei1 , ei2 , . . . , eim}, and to ground each such word
with its best matching object feature fij . It also
aims to find the subset of relational words R ✓
W | R = {ri1 , ri2 , . . . , ril} and to ground each
relation to a pair of object features {fi,subj , fi,obj}
which correspond to the subject and object of that
relation.



6599

To identify and ground the relations between
entities in an image, we propose C-GEARD
(Captioning-Grounding via Entity Attention for Re-
lation Detection). C-GEARD passes the caption
through the Stanford Scene Graph Parser (Schus-
ter et al., 2015) to get the set of triplets T =
{(s1, p1, o1), (s2, p2, o2), . . . , (sg, pg, og)}. Each
triplet corresponds to one relation present in the
caption. For (si, pi, oi) 2 T , si, pi and oi denote
subject, predicate and object respectively. The en-
tity and relation subsets are then constructed as:

E =
[

(si,pi,oi)2T

{si, oi} R =
[

(si,pi,oi)2T

{pi}

Captioning using visual attention has proven to
be very successful in aligning the words in a cap-
tion to their corresponding visual features, such
as in Anderson et al. (2018). As shown in Figure
1, we adopt the two-layer LSTM architecture in
Anderson et al. (2018); our end goal, however, is to
associate each word with the closest object feature
rather than producing a caption.

The lower Attention LSTM cell takes in the
words and the global image context vector (f̄ , the
mean of all features F ), and its hidden state hat acts
as a query vector. This query vector is used to at-
tend over the object features F = {f1, f2, . . . , fn}
(serving as both key and value vectors) to produce
an attention vector which summarizes the key vi-
sual information needed for predicting the next
word. The Attention module is parameterized as in
Bahdanau et al. (2014). The concatenation of the
query vector and the attention vector is passed as an
input to the upper LM-LSTM cell, which predicts
the next word of the caption.

The model is trained by minimizing the standard
negative log-likelihood loss.

3.3 Relation Classifier
We run the grounding module C-GEARD over the
training captions to generate a “grounded” relation-
ship dataset consisting of tuples {((fi, fj), pi,j)},
where fi and fj are two object features and pi,j
refers to the corresponding aligned predicates.
These predicates occur in free form; however, the
relations in the test set are restricted to only the top
50 relation classes. We manually annotate the cor-
respondence between the 300 most frequent parsed
predicates and their closest relation class. For ex-
ample, we map the parsed predicates dress in, sit-
ting in and inside to the canonical relation class
in. Using this mapping we get tuples of the form
{((fi, fj), ci,j)} where ci,j denotes the canonical
class corresponding to pi,j

Since this dataset is generated by applying the
grounding module on the set of all images and
the corresponding captions, it pools the relation
information from across the whole dataset, which
we then use to train our relation classifier.

We parameterize the relation classifier with a
2-layer MLP. Given the feature vectors of any two
objects fi and fj , the relation classifier is trained
to classify the relation ci,j between them.

3.4 Model at Inference
During inference, the features extracted from each
pair of objects is passed through the relation classi-
fier to predict the relation between them.

4 Experiments

4.1 Dataset
We use the MS COCO (Lin et al., 2014) dataset
for training and the Visual Genome (Krishna et al.,
2017) dataset for evaluation. MS COCO has im-
ages and their captions, and Visual Genome con-
tains images and their associated scene graphs.
The Visual Genome dataset consists in part of MS
COCO images, and since we require ground truth
captions and bounding boxes during training, we
filter the Visual Genome dataset by considering
only those images which are part of the original
MS COCO dataset. Similar to Xu et al. (2017),
we manually remove poor quality and overlapping
bounding boxes with ambiguous object names, and
filter to keep the 150 most frequent object cate-
gories and 50 most frequent predicates. Our final
dataset thus comprises of 41,731 images with 150
unique objects and 50 unique relations. We use
a 70-30 train-validation split. We use the same

test set as Xu et al. (2017), so that the results are
comparable with other supervised baselines.

4.2 Baselines
Since, to the best of our knowledge, this work
is the first to introduce the task of weakly super-
vised relationship prediction solely using captions
and bounding boxes, we do not have any directly
comparable baselines, i.e., all other work is either
completely supervised or relies on all ground truth
entity-relation triplets being present at train time.
Consequently, we construct baselines relying solely
on captions and ground truth bounding box loca-
tions that are comparable to our task. In particular,
running the Stanford Scene Graph Parser (Schuster
et al., 2015) on ground truth captions constructs a
scene graph just from the image captions (which
almost never capture all the information present in
an image). We use this baseline as a lower bound,
and to obtain insight into the limitations of scene
graphs directly generated from captions. On the
other hand, we use supervised scene graph genera-
tion baselines (Yang et al., 2018; Newell and Deng,
2017) to upper bound our performance, since we
rely on far less information and data.

4.3 Evaluation Metric
As our primary objective is to detect relations be-
tween entities, we use the PredCls evaluation met-
ric (Xu et al., 2017), defined as the performance of
recognizing the relation between two objects given
their ground truth locations. We only use the entity
bounding boxes’ locations without knowing the
ground truth objects they contain. We show results
on Recall@k (the fraction of top k relations pre-
dicted by the model contained in the ground truth)
for k = 50 and 100. The predicted relations are
ranked over all objects pairs for all relation classes
by the relation classifier’s model confidence.

5 Results and Discussion

5.1 Performance
We show the performance of C-GEARD in Table 1.
We compare its performance with various super-

vised baselines, as well as a baseline which parses
relations from just the caption using Stanford Scene
Graph Parser (Schuster et al., 2015) (caption-only
baseline), on the PredCls metric. Our proposed
method substantially outperforms the caption-only
baseline. This shows that our model predicts re-
lationships more successfully than by purely re-
lying on captions, which contain limited informa-
tion. This in turn supports our hypothesis that it
is possible to detect relations by pooling informa-
tion from captions across images, without requiring
all ground truth relationship annotations for every
image.

Note that our model is at a significant disad-
vantage when compared to supervised approaches.
First, we use pre-trained ResNet features (trained
on a classification task) without any fine-tuning;
supervised methods, however, use Faster RCNN
(Ren et al., 2015), whose features are likely much
better suited for multiple objects. Second, super-
vised methods likely have a better global view than
C-GEARD, because Faster RCNN provides a sig-
nificantly larger number of proposals, while we
rely on ground truth regions which are far fewer in
number. Third, and most significant, we have no
ground truth relationship or class information, re-
lying purely on weak supervision from captions to
provide this information. Finally, since we require
captions, we use significantly less data, training on
the subset of Visual Genome overlapping with MS
COCO (and has ground truth captions as a result).

5.2 Relation Classification

We train the relation classifier on image features
of entity pairs and using the relations found in the
caption as the only source of supervision. On the
validation set, we obtain a relation classification
accuracy of 22%.

We compute the top relations that the model gets
most confused about, shown in Table 2. We observe
that even when the predictions are not correct, they
are semantically close to the ground truth relation
class.

5.3 Visualizations

Three images with their captions are given in Fig-
ure 2. We can see that C-GEARD generates pre-
cise entity groundings, and that the Stanford Scene
Graph Parser generates correct relations. This re-
sults in the correct grounding of the entities and
relations which yields accurate training samples for
the relation classifier.

6 Conclusion

In this work, we propose a novel task of weakly-
supervised relation prediction, with the objective
of detecting relations between entities in an image
purely from captions and object-level bounding box
annotations without class information. Our pro-
posed method builds upon top-down attention (An-
derson et al., 2018), which generates captions and
grounds word in these captions to entities in images.

We leverage this along with structure found from
the captions by the Stanford Scene Graph Parser
(Schuster et al., 2015) to allow for the classifica-
tion of relations between pairs of objects without
having ground truth information for the task. Our
proposed approaches thus allow weakly-supervised
relation detection.

There are several interesting avenues for future
work. One possible line of work involves removing
the requirement of ground truth bounding boxes
altogether by leveraging a recent line of work
that does weakly-supervised object detection (such
as (Oquab et al., 2015; Bilen and Vedaldi, 2016;
Zhang et al., 2018; Bai and Liu, 2017; Arun et al.,
2018)). This would reduce the amount of supervi-
sion required even further. An orthogonal line of
future work might involve using a Visual Question
Answering (VQA) task (such as in Krishna et al.
(2017)), either on its own replacing the caption-
ing task, or in conjunction with the captioning task
with a multi-task learning objective.
