Abstract 

We developed a Chinese spelling check 
system for error detection and error cor-
rection subtasks in the 2013 SIGHAN-7 
Chinese Spelling Check Bake-off. By us-
ing the resources of Chinese phonology 
and orthographic components, our system 
contains four parts: high confidence pat-
tern matcher, the detection module, the 
correction module, and the merger. We 
submitted 2 official runs for both sub-
tasks. The evaluation result show that our 
system achieved 0.6016 in error detection 
F-score of subtask 1, and 0.448 in correc-
tion accuracy of subtask 2.1 

1 Introduction 
Chinese spelling check is a task which detects 
and corrects errors in text. These errors may re-
sult from writing, optical character recognition 
(OCR), typing, and so on. Chinese spelling check 
has been considered useful in many area such as 
language learning or error-tolerated language 
processing, and there are many researches 
around this topic (Y.-Z. Chen, Wu, Yang, Ku, & 

                                                 
* Authors with equal contributions. 

Chen, 2011; Liu et al., 2011; Wu, Chen, Yang, 
Ku, & Liu, 2010). 

The SIGHAN Bake-off 2013 Chinese Spelling 
Check contains two subtasks. The first subtask 
requires each team to detect whether a sentence 
contains errors. If the answer is yes, the error 
location(s) should be provided. For each sen-
tence in subtask2, there is at least one error. Par-
ticipants have to locate and correct those errors 
in the sentence. 

The organization of this paper is as follows. 
Section 2 describes the architecture and different 
modules in our spelling check system. Section 3 
shows our evaluation results and some discussion. 
Lastly, Section 4 concludes this work and shares 
some insights we gained participating this Bake-
off. 

2 Method 
Our system can be divided into four parts. They 
are high confidence pattern matcher, detection 
module, correction module and merger. High 
confidence pattern matcher finds patterns that are 
very unlikely to contain any error, and exclude 
them from the rest of the process. Detection 
module is used to detect the error locations in a 
sentence. Correction module generates sugges-
tions for erroneous words. Merger receives these 
suggestions and chooses the most possible result. 
Figure 1 shows the structure of our system.

2.3 Correction Module 
Possible error positions from detection modules 
are received by the following correction modules 
to generate candidates for corrections. Both simi-
lar pronunciation and shape correcting process 
will be activated, and the results will be sent to 
the merger for the final decision. 

Homophone Dictionary and N-gram Correc-
tion 

We check the received error locations and gener-
ate possible corrections by using homophones 
and Google web 1T n-gram frequency. For ex-
ample, there is an error "書貴" and the detection 
modules say that "貴" is an error. This module 
will generate possible candidates by finding all 
homophones of "貴 ". The frequency of each 
candidate in Google web 1T n-gram is used as 
the confidence. In this case, the frequency of "書
櫃" (bookcase) is higher than the frequency of 
the original text, and all other homophones. Thus, 
a correction for "書貴" is given by this module 
as "書櫃". 

Errors with Similar Shape 

Shape correction module utilized data from 
Xiaoxuetang Chinese character database 
(National-Taiwan-University & Academia-Sinica, 
2013), which consists of decomposed compo-
nents of almost every Chinese character, to find 
corrections with similar shapes. We retrieved the 
components of each character that were marked 
as a possible error by the detection module, and 
calculate the Damerau-Levenshtein edit distance 
(Damerau, 1964; Levenshtein, 1966) between 
this character and all other characters. We slight-
ly altered this edit distance formula to favor 
those with identical parts regardless of the order. 
For example, a character with parts (A, B) are 
considered more similar to (B, A) than to (A, D). 
From our observation of the training data, this 
method can better rank the most similar charac-
ters. We then select those characters that have an 
edit distance score less than 1, and filter out the 
ones that do not form a word with its neighbor-
ing 1 to 3 characters using a dictionary (Ministry 
of Education, 1994). 

Across-the-board Search and Correction 

This process will only be activated when no an-
swer was provided by any previous modules. It 
checks all locations which are not covered by 
high confidence pattern matcher, and generates 

suggestions that have similar shapes to the char-
acters in these locations using the shape correc-
tion module. We do not consider phonetic errors 
in this step because we assume phonetic errors 
can be detected by previous modules. 

2.4 Merger 
The merger receives all suggestions from the 
aforementioned correction modules, and decides 
whether a suggestion is accepted or not. In our 
system, we used a probabilistic language model 
trained by LDC news corpus as the kernel of this 
merger. This module generates possible combi-
nations of suggestions and calculates scores. The 
combination of suggestions with the best score is 
selected as our answer. 

3 Experimental Results 
We submitted two runs to compare the effect of 
high confidence patterns. Run 1 used patterns 
which have a confidence level of 50% or higher, 
and run 2 used those having over 80%. Table 1

and 2 are our experimental results for subtask 1 
and 2, respectively. Bold typed numbers indicate 
that our performance is above the average. 

We can see that, generally speaking, our per-
formance of both subtasks is above average 
among participants. The effect of the confidence 
level of our high confidence patterns can be ob-
served when we compare the results of our 2 
runs. Using a higher confidence threshold (run 2) 
would yield a higher accuracy, while a lower 
threshold (run 1) would sometimes yield a higher 
recall. 

4 Conclusion 
This paper introduced our Sinica-IASL Chinese 
spelling checking system, implemented for the 
2013 SIGHAN-7 Bake-off. By using phonologi-
cal and orthographical data of Chinese characters, 
dictionaries and frequent error data, we were able 
to achieve reasonable performances. During the 
process of our work, we noticed that about 80% 
of the texts are covered by all words in our dic-
tionary. The minimum coverage of a sentence is 
50%. It implies that we can handle at least 50% 
of the text by only using a dictionary. If we use 
frequent n-grams, the coverage is over 90%. A 
method for finding useful n-grams is a way to 
boost our performance. The experimental results 
showed that there is plenty of room for im-
provement in our system's ability to detect errors. 
Further works also include using a web corpus to 
find frequent errors, possible error locations and 
corrections. In conclusion, our system can bene-
fit from more resources in order to become a 
more competitive Chinese spelling checker.
