Abstract

Linguistic Code Switching (CS) is a phe-
nomenon that occurs when multilingual speak-
ers alternate between two or more lan-
guages/dialects within a single conversation.
Processing CS data is especially challeng-
ing in intra-sentential data given state-of-the-
art monolingual NLP technologies since such
technologies are geared toward the process-
ing of one language at a time. In this paper,
we address the problem of Part-of-Speech tag-
ging (POS) in the context of linguistic code
switching (CS). We explore leveraging mul-
tiple neural network architectures to measure
the impact of different pre-trained embeddings
methods on POS tagging CS data. We in-
vestigate the landscape in four CS language
pairs, Spanish-English, Hindi-English, Mod-
ern Standard Arabic- Egyptian Arabic dialect
(MSA-EGY), and Modern Standard Arabic-
Levantine Arabic dialect (MSA-LEV). Our re-
sults show that multilingual embedding (e.g.,
MSA-EGY and MSA-LEV) helps closely re-
lated languages (EGY/LEV) but adds noise to
the languages that are distant (SPA/HIN). Fi-
nally, we show that our proposed models out-
perform state-of-the-art CS taggers for MSA-
EGY language pair.

1 Introduction

Code Switching (CS) is a common linguistic be-
havior where two or more languages/dialects are
used interchangeably in either spoken or written
form. CS is typically present at various levels
of linguistic structure: across sentence bound-
aries (i.e., inter-sentential), within the same utter-
ances, mixing two or more languages (i.e., intra-
sentential), or at the words/morphemes level. The
CS phenomenon is noticeable and common in
countries that have large immigrant groups, nat-
urally leading to bilingualism. Typically peo-
ple who code switch master two (or more) lan-

guages: a common first language (lang1) and an-
other prevalent language as a second language
(lang2). The languages could be completely dis-
tinct such as Mandarin and English, or Hindi and
English, or they can be variants of one another
such as in the case of Modern Standard Arabic
(MSA) and Arabic regional dialects (e.g. Egyptian
dialect-EGY). CS is traditionally prevalent in the
spoken modality but with the ubiquity of the In-
ternet and proliferation of social media, CS is be-
coming ubiquitous in written modalities and gen-
res (Vyas et al., 2014a; Danet and Herring, 2007;
Cárdenas-Claros and Isharyanti, 2009). This new
situation has created an unusual deluge of CS tex-
tual data on the Internet. This data brings in its
wake new opportunities, but it poses serious chal-
lenges for different NLP tasks; traditional tech-
niques trained for one language tend to break
down when the input text happens to include two
or more languages. The performance of NLP mod-
els that are currently expected to yield good results
(e.g., Part-of-Speech Tagging) would degrade at
a rate proportional to the amount and level of
mixed-language present. This is a result of out-of-
vocabulary words in one language and new hybrid
grammar structures, and in some cases shared cog-
nates or ambiguous words that exist in both lan-
guage lexicons.

POS tagging is a vital component of any Nat-
ural Language Understanding system, and one of
the first tasks researchers employ to process data.
POS tagging is an enabling technology needed by
higher-up NLP tools such as chunkers and parsers
– syntactic, semantic and discourse level process-
ing; all of which are used for such applications as
sentiment analysis and subjectivity, text summa-
rization, information extraction, automatic speech
recognition, and machine translation among oth-
ers. As such, it is crucial that POS taggers be able
to process CS textual data.

In this paper, we address the problem of Part-
of-Speech tagging (POS) for CS data on the intra-
sentential level for multiple language pairs. We
explore the effect of using various embeddings se-
tups and multiple neural network architectures in
order to mitigate the problem of the scarcity of CS
annotated data. We propose multiple word embed-
ding techniques that could help in tackling POS
tagging of CS data.

In order to examine the generalization of our ap-
proaches across language pairs, we conduct our
study on four different evaluation CS data sets,
covering four language pairs: Modern Standard
Arabic and the Egyptian Arabic dialect (MSA-
EGY), Modern Standard Arabic- and the Levan-
tine Arabic dialect (MSA-LEV), Spanish-English
(SPA-ENG) and Hindi-English (HIN-ENG). We
use the same POS tag sets for all language pairs,
namely, the Universal POS tag set (Petrov et al.,
2011). Our contributions are the following: a) We
use a state-of-the-art bidirectional recurrent neu-
ral networks; b) We explore different strategies
to leverage raw textual resources for creating pre-
trained embeddings for POS tagging CS data; c)
We examine the effect of language identifiers for
joint POS tagging and language identification; d)
We present the first empirical evaluation on POS
tagging with four different language pairs. All of
the previous work focused on a single or two lan-
guage pair combinations.

2 Related Work

Developing CS text processing NLP techniques
for analyzing user generated content as well as
cater for needs of multilingual societies is vital
(Vyas et al., 2014b). Previous studies that address
the problem of POS tagging of CS data first at-
tempt to identify the correct language of a word
before feeding it into an appropriate monolingual
tagger (Solorio and Liu, 2008; Vyas et al., 2014a;
AlGhamdi et al., 2016). As is typically the case
in NLP, such pipelines suffer from the problem
of error propagation; e.g., failure of the language
identification will cause problems in the POS tag
prediction. Other approaches have trained su-
pervised models on POS-annotated, CS data re-
sources which are expensive to create and unavail-
able for most language pairs. (AlGhamdi et al.,
2016; Solorio and Liu, 2008; Jamatia et al., 2015;
Barman et al., 2016) Solorio and Liu (2008), pro-
posed the first statistical approach to POS tagging

of CS data where they employ several heuristics
to combine monolingual taggers with limited suc-
cess, achieving 86% accuracy when choosing the
output of a monolingual tagger based on the dic-
tionary language ID of each token. However, an
SVM trained on the output of the monolingual
taggers performed better than their oracle, reach-
ing 93.48% accuracy. Royal Sequiera (2015) in-
troduces a ML-based approach with a number of
new features for HIN-ENG POS tagging for Twit-
ter and Facebook chat messages. The new feature
set considers the transliteration problem inherent
in social media. Their system achieves an accu-
racy of 84%. Jamatia et al. (2015) use both a fine-
grained and coarse-grained POS tag set in their
study. They introduce a comparison between the
performance of a combination of language specific
taggers and a machine learning based approach
that uses a range of different features. They con-
clude that the machine learning approach failed to
outperform the language specific combination tag-
gers. AlGhamdi et al. (2016) examine seven POS
tagging strategies to leverage the available mono-
lingual resources for CS data. They conducted
their study on two language pairs, namely MSA-
EGY and SPA-ENG. The proposed strategies are
divided into combined conditions and integrated
conditions. Three of the combined conditions con-
sist of running monolingual POS taggers and lan-
guage ID taggers in a different order and combin-
ing the outputs in a single multilingual prediction.
The fourth combined condition involved training
an SVM model using the output of the mono-
lingual taggers. The three integrated approaches
trained a monolingual state-of-the-art POS tagger
on a) CS corpus; b) the union of two monolingual
corpora of the languages included in the CS; c)
the union of the corpora used in a and b. Both
combined and integrated conditions outperformed
the baseline systems. The SVM approach con-
sistently outperformed the integrated approaches
achieving the highest accuracy results for both lan-
guage pairs. Soto and Hirschberg (2018) propose
a new approach to POS tagging for code switching
SPA-ENG language pair based on recurrent neural
network (RNN) as a way of providing better tools
for better code switching data processing, includ-
ing POS taggers. The authors use an experimen-
tal approach of POS tagging for CS utterances en-
tailing use of state-of-the-art bi-directional RNN
to extensively study effects of language identi-



101

fiers. For the Boolean features, a bi-directional
Long short-term memory (BiLSTM) state-of-the-
art neural network with suffix, prefix, and word
embeddings, the results show that the neural POS
tagging model proposed by the authors performs
comparatively higher than other state of the art CS
taggers, their system yields a POS tagging accu-
racy of 96.34%, while joint POS and language ID
tagging yields an accuracy of 96.39% for POS tag-
ging and language ID accuracy of 98.78% (Soto
and Hirschberg, 2018). Language Modeling (LM)
on HIN-ENG language texts has been proposed
by (Chandu et al., 2018). (Pratapa et al., 2018)
propose the use of a computational technique to
create artificial code mixed data that is grammat-
ically valid based on the ECT (Equivalence Con-
straint Theory) to solve the challenge of scarcity
of CS training language models using an exper-
imental approach. (Pratapa et al., 2018) uses two
bilingual embedding techniques, namely Bilingual
Compositional Model (BiCVM) and Correlation
Based Embeddings (BiCCA) (Faruqui and Dyer,
2014; Blunsom and Hermann, 2014). Word em-
bedding results in improved semantic and syn-
tactic CS processing tasks. BiCVM at the sen-
tence level only yields better performance for
semantic tasks. BiCCA also only do well on
semantic tasks because they make use of word
alignments. Furthermore, g-skip embedding out-
performed BiCCA and BiCVM, performing well
across syntactic and semantic tasks. The study
by Pratapa et al. (2018) illustrates that using pre-
trained embeddings learned from CS data outper-
forms pretrained embeddings learned from stan-
dard bilingual embeddings. Bhat et al. (2018)
introduce a dependency parser developed specif-
ically for HIN-ENG CS data. They adopted the
neural stacking architecture proposed by (Zhang
and Weiss, 2016; Chen et al., 2016) for learning
POS tagging and parsing and for transferring the
knowledge from bilingual models trained on Hindi
and English UD treebanks. The stack-prop tagger,
the model proposed by (Zhang and Weiss, 2016),
achieves the highest accuracy of 90.53. To identify
the language ID, they train a multilayer perceptron
(MLP) stacked on top of a recurrent bidirectional
LSTM (Bi-LSTM) network. The results of their
system is 97.39 %.

3 Approach

Pretrained word embeddings enable models to ex-
ploit the raw textual data which is in all languages
larger than annotated data. In recent times, there
has been some interest in embedding approaches,
e.g., multilingual embeddings and bilingual word
embeddings, where two monolingual embeddings
of two languages are mapped to a shared em-
beddings space. The main advantage of bilin-
gual and multilingual embeddings is in solving
tasks involving reasoning across two languages,
such as Machine Translation (MT) (Vulić and
Moens, 2016; Zou et al., 2013), as well as enabling
transfer of models learned on a resource-rich
language onto a resource-poor language (Adams
et al., 2017). One of the potential applications of
bilingual and multilingual embeddings is in the
processing of code switching language. In this
section, we compare leveraging multiple neural
network architectures for POS tagging CS data.
Moreover, we explore different embedding setups
to investigate the optimal way of tackling the POS
tagging of CS data. First, we illustrate the tool
used for training the embeddings layer. Second,
we present the neural network models. Then we
list the embedding setups.

Pretrained Word Embedding Model Most
successful methods for learning word embeddings
(Mikolov et al., 2013c; Pennington et al., 2014;
Bojanowski et al., 2017) rely on the distributional
hypothesis (Mikolov et al., 2013b), i.e., words
occurring in similar contexts tend to have simi-
lar meanings. Among all word embedding tech-
niques, we choose the FastText tool developed by
Facebook (Bojanowski et al., 2017). Our choice of
FastText is motivated by the fact that social media
networks are the primary source of our unlabeled
data. This type of data exhibits huge variations
of spelling and misspellings. FastText takes ad-
vantage of subword (i.e., n-gram) information. It
creates vector representations for misspelling re-
placement candidates absent from the trained em-
bedding space, by summing the vectors of the
character n-grams. All word embedding tech-
niques aim to capture the relation of the words that
tend to appear in similar context. These relations
occur on the sentential level for most of the NLP
applications trained for monolingual data. How-
ever, the lack of having sufficient context in CS
data makes learning these kinds of relations a diffi-



102

cult task as they occur on the sub-sentential (intra-
sentential) level. Hence, we resort to using Fast-
Text due to its principle approach of leveraging
subword (i.e., n-gram) information. The n-gram
approach resolves the problem of modeling lan-
guages with rare word inflections by using char-
acter n-grams. On the other hand, other embed-
ding techniques, e.g., word2vec and glove, lack
subword information and hence struggle with mor-
phologically rich languages such as Arabic and
noisy data such as Twitter data (Mikolov et al.,
2013a; Pennington et al., 2014).

A Model for Neural POS Tagging For our ex-
periments we use three neural networks archi-
tectures: a) a BiLSTM-CRF architecture similar
to the one proposed by (Reimers and Gurevych,
2017) for POS tagging; b) a multi-task learning
model for learning jointly POS tagging for related
language pairs; and, c) a multi-task learning model
for learning jointly POS and Language ID tagging.

• We train a BiLSTM network with a condi-
tional random field objective (Reimers and
Gurevych, 2017) that obtain the probability
distribution over all labels by jointly model-
ing the probability of the entire tag sequence
score. We initialize the embedding layer
with the pre-trained FastText word embed-
dings and feed the output sequence from this
layer to the BiLSTM layer. The BiLSTM
hidden layer has 200 units for each direction
and dropout of 0.2. We use early stopping
(Chollet et al., 2015) based on performance
on validation sets. We refer to this model as
BiLSTM-CRF POS Tagger for the rest of the
article and in our tables.

• Our second model is a multi-task learning
model that learns simultaneously POS tag-
ging for related code switching language
pairs. The architecture of this model follows
the BiLSTM-CRF architecture (Reimers and
Gurevych, 2017). We add a second CRF out-
put layer for predicting the POS tag for the re-
lated language pair (e.g., MSA-LEV), while
the first CRF output layer is for predicting the
POS tag for the other related language pair
(e.g., MSA-EGY). The two output layers of
POS tagging tasks for the two language pairs
are independent and are connected by their
weight matrices to the hidden layer, and both
loss functions are given the same weight. We

refer to this model as MTL-POS Tagger for
the rest of the article and in our tables.

• The third model is a multi-task learning
model. The model learns simultaneously
POS and language id tags with the aim of
boosting the performance of POS tagging
task. The architecture of this model follows
MTL-POS Tagger architecture. The differ-
ence is that one output layer is for predicting
the POS tagging, and the other output layer is
for predicting language id task. This model is
referred to as MTL-POS+LID Tagger.

Experimental Conditions

Monolingual embedding (baseline): We train
word embeddings using the monolingual corpora
for each language involved in the four language
pairs. The results of this approach are six separate
pre-trained embeddings, MSA, EGY, LEV, ENG,
SPA, and HIN pre-trained embeddings. For each
language, we train a BiLSTM-CRF model using
one of the six pre-trained embeddings. We con-
sider these models as baseline systems. The base-
line performance is the POS tagging accuracy of
the monolingual models with no special training
for CS data.

Merged Bilingual embeddings:

Combined filtered monolingual corpora
(CFM): To leverage the inter-sentential code
switching type, we train a model using a pre-
trained word embedding trained on monolingual
data only. The assumption is that the data in
MSA is purely MSA and that in EGY is purely
EGY. This condition yields an inter-sentential CS
pre-trained embeddings. None of the sentences
reflect intra-sentential CS data.

Pure Code switched corpora (PCS): To lever-
age the intra-sentential code switching type, we
train a model using a pre-trained word embedding
trained on CS data only. The assumption is that
the data used to train the embeddings exhibit the
CS phenomenon. This condition yields an intra-
sentential CS type. None of the sentences reflect
inter-sentential CS data.

(Pseudo) Combined monolingual and CS cor-
pora (PseudoCS): To address both code switch-
ing types, the intra-sentential and inter-sentential,
we combine the pure code switched corpora and
combined filtered monolingual corpora to form

dings.

guage pairs

Merged multilingual embeddings: We train a
multilingual embedding for language pairs that
have one language in common (pivot language).
To do so, we combine the corpora used to train
the word embeddings of the language pairs that
share one common language. For MSA-EGY and
MSA-LEV language pairs, we have a common
language, which is MSA, while ENG is a com-
mon language between SPA-ENG and HIN-ENG.
To leverage this commonality between each of the
two language pairs, we merge all the previous cor-
pora: PCS, Mono, and PseudoCS for each lan-
guage pair to form one corpus used to train merged
multilingual embeddings model for MSA-EGY-
LEV languages and another corpus for SPA-HIN-
ENG. The intuition of this embeddings is to cap-
ture word usage in the context of each language
and eliminates the ambiguity for the words that
have the same surface form in multiple languages.

Projected bilingual embedding Projected
bilingual embeddings are vector representations
of two languages mapped into shared space,
such that translated word pairs have similar
vectors. There are three approaches to learn
bilingual embeddings: 1) by mapping the space
of both monolingual embeddings into a single
shared space; 2) monolingual adaptation of one
language’s embedding space into another’s; 3)
Bilingual Training by bootstrapping the tar-
get representations learned from well-trained
embeddings space of a source language. We
train individual CS and monolingual embedding
models separately before mapping them into a
shared embedding space. To do so, We use MUSE
(Conneau et al., 2017), state-of-the-art model for
creating a projected bilingual embedding that uses
the monolingual adaptation technique to create
the shared space embedding. MUSE is equipped
to learn either via supervision or no supervision.
In our study, we utilize the unsupervised version

of MUSE.

4 Evaluation

4.1 Data sets

Throughout our experiments, we use one evalu-
ation dataset for each language pair and various
corpora for training the embeddings layer. Table-1
shows the distribution of the evaluation data sets.

MSA-EGY We use the LDC Egyptian Ara-
bic Treebanks 1-5 (ARZ1-5) (Maamouri et al.,
2012). The ARZ1-5 data is from the discussion
forums genre mostly in the Egyptian Arabic di-
alect (EGY). The total number of sentences in the
corpus is 13,698 while the number of words is
174,967 words.

To train pre-trained embeddings, we crawl
Egyptian tweets from some of the Egyptian pub-
lic figures’ Twitter accounts. The rest of the
Egyptian raw textual data comes from the follow-
ing sources: (Zaidan and Callison-Burch, 2011)’s
Egyptian online news commentary corpus, the
Egyptian tweets used in the CS shared tasks
(Solorio et al., 2014; Molina et al., 2016; Aguilar
et al., 2018), portion of MSA Gigaword (Parker
et al., 2011), and LDC Arabic tree bank corpora
(MSA) (Maamouri et al., 2004; Diab et al., 2013).
To identify the language id of MSA-EGY tokens,
we use the Automatic Identification of Dialectal
Arabic (AIDA2) tool (Al-Badrashiny et al., 2015)
to perform token level language identification for
the EGY and MSA tokens in context.

MSA-LEV We use the Curras Corpus of Pales-
tinian Arabic as the MSA-LEV textual CS data
(Jarrar et al., 2017). Palestinian Arabic is a sub-
dialect of Levantine Arabic. The corpus comprises
57,000 words, half of which come from transcripts
of a TV show and the rest of which comes from
various sources such as Facebook, discussing fo-
rums, Twitter, and blogs. The corpus is morpho-
logically annotated by Eskander et al. (2016) us-
ing the same guidelines utilized for annotating the
Egyptian ARZ corpus. We annotate the MSA-
LEV evaluation data set with language id using the
guidelines and tool proposed by (Diab et al., 2016;
AlGhamdi and Diab, 2018).

To train pre-trained embeddings, we crawl
tweets from Levantine public figures. Moreover,
we compile Levantine and MSA raw textual data
from multiple resources: online news commentary
corpus from (Zaidan and Callison-Burch, 2011),



104

weblogs from COLABA (Diab et al., 2010), com-
mentaries and tweets from Cotterell and Callison-
Burch (2014), the Levantine portion of the PADIC
data set (Meftouh et al., 2015), portion of MSA
Gigaword (Parker et al., 2011), and LDC Arabic
tree bank corpora (MSA) (Maamouri et al., 2004;
Diab et al., 2013).

SPA-ENG The Miami Bangor (MB) corpus is a
conversational speech corpus recorded from bilin-
gual Spanish-English speakers living in Miami,
FL. It includes 56 conversations recorded from 84
speakers (Soto and Hirschberg, 2017). The cor-
pus consists of 242,475 words (333,069 includ-
ing punctuation tokens) and 35 hours of recorded
conversation. The language markers in the corpus
were manually annotated.

To train pre-trained embeddings for Spanish and
English language, we use the English Universal
Dependencies (UD) corpus (Silveira et al., 2014)
and the Spanish UD corpus (McDonald et al.,
2013). Universal Dependencies (UD) is a project
to develop cross-linguistically consistent treebank
annotations for many languages. Moreover, we
use some other English monolingual data from
various resources. The English monolingual data
contains around 250M sentences.

HIN-ENG The Hindi-English Code switching
treebank is based on CS tweets of Hindi and En-
glish multilingual speakers (mostly Indian) (Bhat
et al., 2017). The treebank is manually anno-
tated using UD scheme. The corpus contains data
from Twitter. The corpus contains 1,852 tweets
and 26,224 tokens. To train pre-trained embed-
dings for Hindi and English language, we use
the English Universal Dependencies (UD) corpus
(Silveira et al., 2014) and the Hindi UD corpus
(Bhat et al.; Palmer et al., 2009). Also, we use
some other Hindi monolingual data from various
resources. The word representations are learned
using Skip-gram model with negative sampling
which is implemented in FastText toolkit for all
language.

Baseline Results The baseline performance is
the POS tagging accuracy of the monolingual
models with no special training for CS data.
Therefore, our baselines are the neural network
models trained using the monolingual embed-
dings. If CS data do not pose any particular chal-
lenge to monolingual POS taggers, then we should
not expect a major degradation in performance.

Table-2 shows the performance of the different
baseline POS tagging systems on the test data. For
each language pair, there are two baseline systems.

For MSA-EGY, the baseline accuracies are
85.40 when the baseline system utilizes the
MSA pre-trained embeddings, and 81.06 when
BiLSTM-CRF uses the EGY pre-trained embed-
dings. Similarly, we report the baseline results for
MSA-LEV, SPA-ENG and HIN-ENG language
pairs.

4.2 Results

In this section, we present the results of our exper-
iments using the neural network models and em-
beddings approach introduced in Section 3 and the
datasets from Section 4.1. Also, we show the re-
sults of three neural network models when the em-
beddings are randomly initialized. Table-2 shows
the POS tagging accuracy results of all language
pairs, while Table-3 shows the LID accuracy re-
sults of all language pairs using MTL-POS+LID
Tagger. To evaluate the performance of our ap-
proaches we report the accuracy of each condition
by comparing the output POS tags generated from
each condition against the available gold POS tags
for each data set. We consistently apply the differ-
ent experimental conditions on the same test set
per language pair: for MSA-EGY we report re-
sults on MSA-EGY test set, for MSA-LEV we re-
port results on MSA-LEV test set, and for SPA-
ENG, we report results on Miami Bangor corpus
(SPA-ENG) test set, and finally for HIN-ENG, we
report on UD-HIN-ENG (HIN-ENG) test set. The
highest accuracy results for MSA-EGY and MSA-
LEV language pairs are 92.90% and 92.92%, re-
spectively. These results are achieved by MTL-
POS Tagger+Merged Bilingual PseudoCS embed-
dings. Our best model for MSA-EGY outperform
state-of-the-art system by ∼ 2% (AlGhamdi et al.,
2016). We could not compare our best system
for MSA-LEV language pair to any previous sys-
tems as we map the original POS tag set (Buck-
walter POS tag set) of the MSA-LEV dataset into
UD POS tag set. BiLSTM-CRF+Merged Bilin-
gual PseudoCS embeddings yield the highest ac-
curacy results for both SPA-ENG and HIN-ENG
language pairs. The SPA-ENG model’s accuracy,
96.55%, is comparable to the state-of-the-art sys-
tem, 96.63% (Soto and Hirschberg, 2018). On the
other hand, the accuracy of our best HIN-ENG
model (86.01%) underperforms the state-of-the-

5 Discussion

Multilingual embedding (e.g., MSA-EGY and
MSA-LEV) helps closely related languages
(EGY/LEV) but adds noise to the languages that
are distant (SPA/HIN). Similarly, learning jointly
POS tagging for closely related languages yields
the highest accuracy results for MSA-EGY and
MSA-LEV as opposed to the languages that are
distant (SPA/HIN). The accuracy results of MSA-
EGY and MSA-LEV language pairs are the high-
est results in all experimental setups. The im-
provement could be attributed to the significant

number of homographs some of which are cog-
nates.

The CS behavior can be different depending
on the medium of communication, topic, speak-
ers (or authors), and the languages being mixed
among other factors. Hence, we believe that
the difference in the genre of the evaluation data
sets of SPA-ENG and HIN-ENG language pairs
is one of the potential reasons that make both
language pairs not to benefit from the multilin-
gual embedding and learning jointly POS tagging
for both language pairs. On the other hand, the
MTL-POS-LID Tagger that learns simultaneously
POS and language id tags with the aim of boost-
ing the performance of POS tagging task bene-
fit distant (SPA/HIN) more than closely related
languages (EGY/LEV). We define code switching
points as the points within a sentence where the
languages of the words on the two sides are dif-

ferent. We observe a sharp jump in the accuracy
for SPA-ENG corpus. We believe the major fac-
tor of this jump is the low percentage of the CS
points, ∼ 6%, while the percentage of CS points
in the MSA-EGY, MSA-LEV, and HIN-ENG
datasets are relatively high, 38.78%, 30.12%,
and 15.17%. The low percentage of CS points
in the SPA-ENG corpus leads the models that
address the inter-sentential code switching type
(BiLSTM-CRF+Merged BilingualMerged Bilin-
gual CFM and MTL+Merged BilingualMerged
Bilingual CFM) to score the second highest accu-
racy results, 95.40% and 95.42%.

The two key advantages of the Merged Bilin-
gual PseudoCS embeddings and Multilingual em-
beddings are, 1) it enables the learned embeddings
to capture the interactions between the words in
different languages; 2) It captures the word us-
age in the context of each language and eliminates
the ambiguity for the words that have the same
surface form in multiple languages. Hence, the
OOV percentage and ambiguity of words are re-
duced. Using multilingual embeddings for MSA-
EGY and MSA-LEV, reduced the percentage of
OOV of MSA-EGY and MSA-LEV from 10% and
13% to 8% and 10%, respectively. Similarly, with
SPA-ENG and HIN-ENG language pairs, the rate
of OOV is decreased from 12% and 15% to 9%
and 11%, respectively.

One of the common CS intra-sentential patterns
we notice in our data sets is insertion patterns.
This pattern involves inserting material (lexical
items, or entire constituents) from one language
into a structure from the other language (Muysken
et al., 2000). To evaluate the effect of the CS in-
sertion pattern we define the CS fragment (CSF)
of those test sentences. We define a CSF as the
minimum contiguous span of words where a CS
occurs (Soto and Hirschberg, 2018). The average
length of the CS fragments in the SPA-ENG test
set is 2.16, and 6.1 in the HIN-ENG test set. The
average length of the CS fragments is 5.1 in MSA-
LEV, and 5.8 in MSA-EGY test set. We observe
that the length of the CS fragments impacts the

overall performance of the classifiers. For exam-
ple, short CS fragments confuse the best classifiers
of almost all language pairs. We noticed that a ma-
jority of CS sentences that have one or two lexical
elements inserted had been miss-classified by al-
most all models in all language pairs.

Using bilingual embeddings outperform the
baseline systems, but it did not achieve the highest
results achieved by the other proposed models for
all language pairs. The experiment results show
a promising direction towards obtaining bilingual
embeddings for CS tasks. Our explanation for
this performance is that the sense distribution of
polysemous words can differ widely between a
monolingual (mono) corpus and Merged Bilingual
PseudoCS corpus. For instance, the word ‘bank’
in English has several meanings such as (a) the
land alongside or sloping, (b) a financial insti-
tution, and (c) a set or series of similar things.
However, in a Spanish dominant sentence or cor-
pus, ’bank’ is primarily, if not only, used in sense
(a). Our experiments show that standard bilingual
embeddings are not well suited, in general, for
CS tasks; embeddings learned from CS data yield
better results which are aligned with our findings
(Pratapa et al., 2018).

Table 4 shows the most common errors for the
best systems for each language pairs. We observe
almost the same trends across both MSA-EGY and
MSA-LEV language pairs, while the common er-
rors are relatively different between SPA-ENG and
HIN-ENG.

6 Conclusion

In this paper, we present a detailed study of var-
ious strategies for POS tagging of CS data in
four language pairs. We explore multiple strate-
gies of measuring the impact of pretrained em-
beddings on POS tagging of CS data. We find
that related language pairs, e.g., MSA-EGY and
MSA-LEV, benefit from both jointly learning POS
tagging as well as merged multilingual embed-
dings (i.e., pivot embedding), while distant lan-
guage pairs, e.g., SPA-ENG and HIN-ENG, bene-



107

fit from a multi-task learning model that learns two
different tasks, e.g., POS tagging and language
identification. Furthermore, we compared our
results to the previous state-of-the-art POS tag-
ger for MSA-EGY, SPA-ENG, and HIN-ENG and
showed that our classifiers outperform the MSA-
EGY state-of-the-art system in every configura-
tion (AlGhamdi et al., 2016). The results achieved
by BiLSTM-CRF+Merged Bilingual PseudoCS
embeddings model is comparable to Soto and
Hirschberg (2018). We will explore several direc-
tions in the future. First, we will study the theo-
retical aspects of word embedding learning. Sec-
ond, we will investigate the proposed word em-
beddings on other downstream NLP applications,
such as segmentation and parsing.
