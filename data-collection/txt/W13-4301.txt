Abstract

Bilingual corpora play an important
role as resources not only for machine
translation research and development but
also for studying tasks in comparative
linguistics. Manual annotation of word
alignments is of significance to provide
a gold-standard for developing and
evaluating machine translation models
and comparative linguistics tasks. This
paper presents research on building an
English-Vietnamese parallel corpus,
which is constructed for building a
Vietnamese-English machine translation
system. We describe the specification of
collecting data for the corpus, linguistic
tagging, bilingual annotation, and the
tools specially developed for the manual
annotation. An English-Vietnamese
bilingual corpus of over 800,000 sentence
pairs and 10,000,000 English words
as well as Vietnamese words has been
collected and aligned at the sentence level,
and over 45,000 sentence pairs of this
corpus have been aligned at the word
level. Moreover, the 45,000 sentence pairs
have been tagged using other linguistics
tags, including word segmentation for
Vietnamese text, chunker and named
entity tags.

1 Introduction

Recent years have seen a move beyond
traditionally inline annotated single-layered

corpora towards new multi-layer architectures,
deeper and more diverse annotations. There are
several studies which are background for building
multi-layer corpora. These studies include
building tools (A. Zeldes et al., 2009; C. Muller
and M. Strube, 2006; Q. Hung and W. Winiwarter,
2012a), annotation progress (A. Burchardt et al.,
2008; Hansen Schirra et al., 2006; Ludeling et al.,
2005), and data representation (A. Burchardt et
al., 2008; Stefanie Dipper, 2005). Despite intense
work on data representations and annotation tools,
there has been comparatively less work on the
development of architectures affording convenient
access to such data.

Moreover, several research works have been
carried out to build English-Vietnamese corpora
at many different levels, for example, a study
on building POS-tagger for bilingual corpora
or building a bilingual corpus for word sense
disambiguation of Dinh Dien and co-authors (D.
Dien, 2002a; D. Dien et al., 2002b; D. Dien and
H. Kiem, 2003). Other research efforts for this
language pair are building English-Vietnamese
corpora (B. Van et al., 2007; Q. Hung et al., 2012b;
Q. Hung and W. Winiwarter, 2012c).

The present paper shows the process of building
a multi-layer bilingual corpus, including four
main modules: (1) bitext alignment, (2) word
alignment, (3) linguistic tagging, and (4) mapping
and annotation (as shown in Figure 1). In
particular, the bitext alignment (1) includes
paragraph and sentence matching. This step also
needs annotation to ensure that the result of this
step are English-Vietnamese sentence pairs. These
bilingual sentence pairs are aligned at the word

Figure 1: Overview of building EVBCorpus

level by a word alignment module (2). Then,
these bilingual sentences are tagged linguistically
and independently by the specific tagging modules
(3), including English chunking, Vietnamese
chunking, and Named Entity recognition. Finally,
the aligned source and target text can be corrected
as alignment result, word segmentation, chunking
result, as well as named entity recognition result
at the mapping and correction stage (4).

Moreover, we also suggest that annotating
factors in a multi-layer corpus can afford corpus
designers several advantages:

• Linguistics tagging for the corpus has to be
carried out layer-by-layer based on specific
tags and existing tagging tools.

• Distributing annotation work collaboratively,
so that annotators can specialize on specific
subtasks and work concurrently.

• Using different level annotation tools suited
to different tasks in tagging linguistics tags.

• Allowing multiple annotations of the same
type to be created and evaluated, which
is important for controversial layers with
different possible tag sets or low inter-
annotator agreement.

The remainder of this paper describes the
details of our approach to build a multi-layer
bilingual corpus. Firstly we describe the
data source for corpus building in Section 2.
Next, we demonstrate a procedure for linguis-
tic tagging and mapping English linguistic tags

into Vietnamese tags in Section 3. Section 4 ad-
dresses the annotation process with the BiCAT
tool. Conclusion and future work appear in Sec-
tion 5.

2 Data Sources

The EVBCorpus consists of both original English
text and its Vietnamese translations, and original
Vietnamese text and its English translations. The
original data is from books, fictions or short
stories, law documents, and newspaper articles.
The original articles were translated by skilled
translators or by contribution authors and were
checked again by skilled translators. The details
of the EVBCorpus corpus are listed in Table 1.

EVBNews 1,000 45,531 740,534

Total 1,365 814,476 10,431,592

Each article was translated one to one at
the whole article level, so we first need to
align paragraph to paragraph and then sentence
to sentence. At the paragraph stage, aligning
is simply moving the sentences up or down
and detecting the separator position between
paragraphs of both articles by using the BiCAT1

tool, an annotation tool for building bilingual
corpora (see Section 4 and Figure 7) (Q. Hung and
W. Winiwarter, 2012a).

At the sentence stage, however, aligning is more
complex and it depends on the translated articles
which are translated by one-by-one method or a
literal meaning-based method. In many cases (as
common in literature text), several sentences are
merged into one sentence to create the one-by-one
alignment of sentences.

The data source for multi-layer linguistic
tagging is a part of the EVBCorpus which consists
of both original English text and its Vietnamese
translations. It contains 1,000 news articles
defined as the EVBNews part of the EVBCorpus.
This corpus is also aligned semi-automatically at
the word level.

Sentences 45,531 45,531
Words 740,534 832,441
Words in Alignments 654,060 768,031

In particular, each article was translated one
to one at the whole article level, so we align
sentence to sentence. Then, sentences are aligned
at the word level semi-automatically, including
automatic alignment by class-based method and
use of the BiCAT tool to correct the alignments
manually. The details of the corpus are listed in
Table 1 and Table 2.

Parallel documents are also chosen and
classified into categories, such as economics,
entertainment (art and music), health, science,
social, politics, and technology (details of each
category are shown in Table 3).

3 Linguistic Tagging

In our project, the corpus has four information
layers, (1) word segmentation, (2) part-of-speech,
(3) chunker, and (4) named entity tags (as shown
in Figure 2).

For linguistic tagging, we tag chunks for both
English and Vietnamese text. English-Vietnamese
sentence pairs are also aligned word-by-word to
create the connections between the two languages
(as shown in Figure 3).

3.1 Word Alignment in Bilingual Corpus

In a bilingual corpus, word alignment is very
important because it demonstrates the connection
between two languages. In our corpus, we apply
a class-based word alignment approach to align
words in the English-Vietnamese pairs. Our
approach is based on the result of Dinh Dien
and co-authors (D. Dien et al., 2002b). This
approach originates from the English-Chinese
word alignment approach of Ker and Chang (Sue
Ker and Jason Chang, 1997). The class-based
word alignment approach uses two layers to
align words in a bilingual pair, dictionary-based
alignment and semantic class-based alignment.

The dictionary used for the dictionary-based
stage is a general machine-readable bilingual
dictionary while the dictionary used for the
class-based stage is the Longman Lexicon
of Contemporary English (LLOCE) dictionary,
which is a type of semantic class dictionary. The
result of the word alignment is indexed based on
token positions in both sentences. For example:

English: I had rarely seen him so animated .
Vietnamese: Ít khi tôi thấy hắn sôi nổi như thế .
The word alignment result is [1-3], [3-1,2], [4-4],
[5-5], [6-8,9], [7-6,7], [8-10] and these alignments

3.2 Chunking for English

There are several available chunking systems for
English text, such as CRFChunker2 by Xuan-Hieu
Phan or OpenNLP3 (which is an open source
NLP project and one of SharpNLP’s modules) of
Jason Baldridge et al. However, we focus on
parser modules to build an aligned bilingual tree-
bank in future. Based on Rimell ’s evaluation
of 5 state-of-the-art parsers (Rimell et al., 2009),
the Stanford parser is not the parser with the
highest score. However, the Stanford parser4

supports both parse trees in bracket format and
dependencies representation (Dan Klein, 2003;
Marneffe et al., 2006). We chose the Stanford
parser not only for this reason but also because it
is updated frequently, and to provide for the ability
of our corpus for semantic tagging in future.

2http://crfchunker.sourceforge.net/
3http://opennlp.apache.org/
4http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml

In our project, the full parse result of an
English sentence is considered to extract phrases
as chunking result for the corpus. For example,
for the English sentence ”Products permitted for
import, export through Vietnam’s border-gates or
across Vietnam’s borders.”, the extracted chunks
based on the Stanford parser result are:

[Products]NP [permitted]V P [for]PP [im-
port]NP , [export]NP [through]PP [Vietnam’s
border-gates]NP [or]PP [across]PP [Vietnam’s
borders]NP .

3.3 Chunking for Vietnamese

There are several chunking systems for
Vietnamese text, such as noun phrase chunking of
(Le Nguyen et al., 2008) or full phrase chunking
of (Nguyen H. Thao et al., 2009). In our system,
we use the phrase chunker of (Le Nguyen et al.,
2009) to chunk Vietnamese sentences. This is
module SP8.4 in the VLSP project.

The VLSP project5 is a KC01.01/06-10 national
project named ”Building Basic Resources and
Tools for Vietnamese Language and Speech
Processing”. This project involves active
research groups from universities and institutes
in Vietnam and Japan, and focuses on building
a corpus and toolkit for Vietnamese language
processing, including word segmentation, part-of-
speech tagger, chunker, and parser.

The chunking result also includes the word
segmentation and the part-of-speech tagger result.
These results are based on the result of word
segmentation by (Le H. Phuong et al., 2008). The
tagset of chunking includes 5 tags: NP, VP, ADJP,
ADVP, and PP.

For example, the chunking result for the
sentence "Các sản phẩm được phép xuất
khẩu, nhập khẩu qua cửa khẩu, biên giới
Việt Nam." is [Các sản phẩm]V P [được]V P
[phép]NP [xuất_khẩu]V P , [nhập_khẩu qua]V P
[cửa_khẩu]NP , [biên_giới Việt_Nam]NP .” (see
Figure 5).

(In English: “[Products]NP [permitted]V P
[for]PP [import]NP , [export]NP [through]PP
[Vietnam’s border-gates]NP [or]PP [across]PP
[Vietnam’s borders]NP .”)

3.4 Named Entity Recognition

Several Named Entity recognition systems for
English text are available online. For traditional

Figure 5: Result of the Vietnamese chunking

NER, the most popular publicly available systems
are: OpenNLP NameFinder6, Illinois NER7

system (Ratinov and Roth, 2009), Stanford NER8

system by the NLP Group at Stanford University
(Finkel et al., 2005), and Lingpipe NER9 system
by Aspasia Beneti and co-authors (A. Beneti et
al., 2006). The Stanford NER reports 86.86 F1 on
the CoNLL03 NER shared task data. We chose
the Stanford NER to provide for the ability of
our corpus for tagging with multi-type, such as 3
classes, 4 classes, and 7 classes.

For Vietnamese text, there are also several
studies on Named Entity Recognition, such as
Nguyen Dat and co-authors (Nguyen Dat et al.,
2010) or Tri Tran and co-authors (Tran Q. Tri et
al., 2007). However, there is no available system
to download for tagging on Vietnamese text. In
this project, therefore, we carry out mapping
English named entities into Vietnamese text based
on corrected English-Vietnamese word alignments
to get basic Vietnamese named entities. These
entities will be corrected by annotators in the next
stage.

4 Annotation

In our project, we use an annotation tool, BiCAT,
which is a tool for tagging and correcting a corpus
visually, quickly, and effectively (Q. Hung and W.
Winiwarter, 2012a). This tool has the following
main annotation stages:

• Bitext Alignment: This first stage of
annotation is a bitext alignment, which aligns
paragraph by paragraph and then sentence by
sentence.

• Word Alignment: This stage allows
annotators to modify word alignments
between English tokens/words and
Vietnamese tokens in each sentence pair
at the chunk level (see Figure 6).

7http://cogcomp.cs.illinois.edu/page/software view/4
8http://nlp.stanford.edu/ner/index.shtml
9http://alias-i.com/lingpipe/index.html

• Word Segmentation: In general, only
Vietnamese text is considered for correcting
word segmentation.

• POS Tagger: The annotation tool supports
annotating and correcting POS tags for both
English and Vietnamese text as shown in
Figure 6. However, in our project, we use the
POS result of chunking modules as the final
results for our corpus.

• Chunker: This stage is based on combining
English chunking, Vietnamese chunking, and
word alignment results in the comparison
between English and Vietnamese structures
(as shown in Figure 6).

• Named Entity Recognition: This stage
is based on combining English NER and
mapping English entities into Vietnamese
text to get Vietnamese entities.

Figure 6: Combine English chunking (a),
Vietnamese chunking(c), and word alignment (b)

With the visualization provided by the BiCAT
tool, annotators review whole phrase structures
of English and Vietnamese sentences. They
can compare the English chunking result with
the Vietnamese result and correct them in both
sentences. Moreover, mistakes regarding word
segmentation for Vietnamese, POS tagging for

assistant panels

English and Vietnamese, and English-Vietnamese
word alignment can be detected and corrected
through drag, drop, and edit label operations
(actions). Based on drag and drop on labels
and tags, annotators can change the results of the
tagging modules visually, quickly, and effectively.

As shown in Figure 7, the annotation includes
forms for (1) bitext alignment, (2) word alignment,
POS/Chunk tagging. This tool also has several (3)
assistant panels based on context of tagging words
and tags. Assistant panels of the annotation tool
are:

• Looking up the bilingual dictionary for
meanings and part-of-speech of words to
correct translation text and word alignments.

• Searching similar phrase for suggesting
and correcting translation text and word
alignments.

• State of the word alignment of sentences in
whole document for detecting sentence pairs
with less alignments.

• Statistics of named entities as a named
entity map for detecting unbalanced number
of named entities between English and
Vietnamese text in the document.

5 Results and Analysis

5.1 Aligned Bilingual Corpus

The annotation process costs a lot of time and
effort, especially with a corpus of over 10 million
words of each language. In our evaluation,
we annotated 1,000 news articles of EVBNews
with 45,531 sentence pairs, and 740,534 English
words (832,441 Vietnamese words and 1,082,051
Vietnamese tokens), as shown in Table 4. The data
is tagged and aligned automatically at the word
level between English and Vietnamese.

Possible Alignments 560,215 560,215

Alignments are annotated with both sure
alignments S and possible alignments P. These
two types of alignments are annotated to evaluate
the alignment models with the Alignment Error
Rates (AER) (Och and Ney, 2003). In 1,000
aligned news articles, there are 447,906 sure

6



alignments, accounting for 80% of 560,215
possible alignments (as shown in Table 4). These
sure alignments mainly come from nouns, verbs,
adverbs, and adjectives which are meaningful
words in sentences. On the other hand, the
20% remaining possible alignments are mainly
from prepositions in both English words and
Vietnamese words.

5.2 Bilingual Corpus with Linguistic Tags

The first step of linguistic tagging for bilingual
corpus is Vietnamese word segmentation. In
general, the EVBNews corpus is chosen to practise
for building the multi-layer bilingual corpus. This
corpus is aligned at the word level as mentioned in
Section 5.1.

For Vietnamese, the word segmentation
module and the part-of-speech tagger module
are packaged into the chunking module. We
used vnTokenizer10 tool (a Vietnamese word
segmentation based on a hybrid approach between
maximal matching strategy and the linear interpo-
lation smoothing technique) (Le H. Phuong et al.,
2008), and vnTagger11 tool (an automatic part-
of-speech tagger for tagging Vietnamese texts)
(Le H. Phuong et al., 2010). On the other hand,
part-of-speech tagger and chunker of English text
can be extracted from the Stanford Parser module
as mentioned in Section 3.1. All tagged texts,
then, are corrected manually by annotators with
the BiCAT tool.

Table 5: Top 5 chunks of EVBNews corpus
Chunk Tags En. Chunks Vn. Chunks

NP 238,134 239,286
VP 101,234 138,413

ADVP 20,681 563

PP 88,722 77,906
Total 458,375 472,364

The tagset of English chunking includes 9
chunk tags12 while the Vietnamese chunk tagset
has 5 tags: NP, VP, ADJP, ADVP, and PP. Table
5 shows top 5 English and Vietnamese chunks of
1,000 news articles of the EVBNews corpus. In
general, the number of English and Vietnamese

12ftp://ftp.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/pub/corpora/chunker-

tagset-english.txt

chunks are nearly equal, however, there is a
slight difference between the adjective and adverb
chunk of English and Vietnamese. The number of
adverb phrases is twice as much as the number of
adjective phrases in English text while Vietnamese
text mainly uses adjectives to subordinate nouns
and verbs.

5.3 Bilingual Named Entity Corpus
As a next layer of the EVBCorpus, Vietnamese
named entity tags are tagged for the 1,000 news
articles of the EVBNews. Named entities include
six tags, Location (LOC), Person (PER), Organi-
zation (ORG), Time including date tags (TIM),
Money (MON), and Percentage (PCT). English
text is tagged with English NER tags by Stanford
NER and then mapped to Vietnamese text. Next,
Vietnamese entity tags are corrected manually.

In total, there are 32,454 English named entities
and 33,338 Vietnamese named entities in the
EVBNews corpus (see Table 6). We just focus
on the set of alignments and amount of annotation
rather than evaluate the quality of the Word
Alignment module.

Table 6: Number of entities at each stage
Entity En. Entities Vn. Entities
LOC 10,406 11,343
PER 7,201 7,205
ORG 8,177 8,218
TIM 4,478 4,417
MON 998 985
PCT 1,194 1,170
Total 32,454 33,338

There is a difference between the number of
English entities and the number of Vietnamese
entities. This difference occurs because several
English words are not considered as entities
while a part of their translation in Vietnamese
is considered as entities. For example, the
word ”Vietnamese” in the sentence ”Nowadays,
Vietnamese food is more popular.” is not an entity
in the English sentence, while in its Vietnamese
translation ”Thức ăn Việt Nam ngày càng được
biết đến nhiều hơn.”, the word ”Việt Nam” is a
LOC entity.

6 Conclusions

In this paper, we have introduced a complete
workflow to build a multi-layer English-

Figure 8: Combine and align full English-Vietnamese parse trees

Vietnamese bilingual corpus, from collecting
data, aligning words in bilingual text, tagging
chunks and named entities, and developing an
annotation tool for bilingual corpora. We showed
that the size of the EVBCorpus with over 800,000
English-Vietnamese aligned pairs at the sentence
level and 45,531 aligned sentence pairs at the
word level is a valuable contribution to study
other tasks in comparative linguistics. We pointed
out that linguistic information tagging based on
our procedure, including tagging and annotation,
so far, stops at the chunk level. A part of this
corpus and the annotation tool are published at
http://code.google.com/p/evbcorpus/.

However, one potential model of full parser
alignment is to combine full parse trees and
word or chunk alignments as shown in Figure 8.
In addition, 45,531 aligned sentence pairs with
tagged named entities have been also used to map
other linguistic tags (such as co-reference chunks
and semantic tags) from English to Vietnamese
text.
