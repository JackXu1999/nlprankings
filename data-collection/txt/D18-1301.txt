Abstract

In this paper, we provide empirical ev-
idence based on a rigourously studied
mathematical model for bi-populated net-
works, that a glass ceiling within the
field of NLP has developed since the mid
2000s.

1 Introduction
The glass ceiling is a powerful metaphor for the
unethical, invisible, and yet virtually impenetrable
barrier that prevents highly achieving women and
minorities from obtaining equal access to senior
career opportunities. The existence of a glass ceil-
ing is well documented both in STEM1 and specif-
ically in Computer Science (Moss-Racusin et al.,
2012; Shen, 2013; Larivière et al., 2013; Van der
Lee and Ellemers, 2015; Way et al., 2016, for ex-
ample). To date there has been no published study
on this topic for the field of NLP.

In most countries, Computer Science has long
been struggling to support female researchers suf-
ficiently: female representation in Computer Sci-
ence is not only disproportional to the population,
but it is lower than the average STEM field. More-
over, as opposed to STEM fields in general, the
proportion of women in Computer Science has
been on a marked decline for the past two decades
(Sax et al., 2017; Williams et al., 2017), placing
the entire the tech field in a diversity crisis today.

The discussion of gender representation or even
the existence of a glass ceiling is rather more com-
plex for NLP due to its fundamental interdisci-
plinarity especially across the fields of Linguis-
tics, Computer Science, and Statistics. That is,
much mainstream research in NLP follows trends
that are heavily situated in one of the main sub-
disciplines. Can we witness any emergent glass

ceiling for female researchers in the wake of an in-
creasing concentration on deep learning engineer-
ing techniques applied to NLP problems? What
about the preceding Machine Learning wave from
the mid 2000s? In this paper we answer this ques-
tion in the affirmative.

We acquired a gender-annotated co-author
dataset covering arguably the most central ACL
publication venues for the past 52 years. We carry
out basic data analysis over this dataset and the bi-
populated (female and male researcher) mentor-
mentee network derived from it. We make the fol-
lowing concerning empirical observations:

1. There is a growing mentor gender gap. There
is a growing disparity between the propor-
tions of female and male NLP researchers who
achieve mentor status, with a higher proportion
of male researchers becoming mentors, espe-
cially since the mid 2000s.

2. There is a significant time gap to mentor sta-
tus across genders. Female NLP researchers
must wait a considerable time longer to achieve
mentor status than their male colleagues.

3. In-gender mentorship correlates with future
success. Female NLP researchers who take a
male supervisor will have greater difficulty in
becoming a mentor than if they take a female
supervisor, on average.

4. Homophily is on the rise. There is con-
sistently increasing homophily in our field–
the preference to establish in-gender mentor-
mentee relationships.

Following this analysis, we employ Avin et al.
(2015)’s rigorously studied conditions for power
inequality and the glass-ceiling effect for complex
systems data structured like ours to show that these
empirical observations indicate quite precisely the
existence of a glass ceiling effect for the field of
NLP.

thresholds of “mentor seniority”. A disparity in these proportions has been increasing since the 1990s,
which follows the general field of Computer Science. The whiter the background the more significant
the difference in proportions for the corresponding year, with the p-value for 2017 in the title.

2 Acquiring a gender-annotated
mentor-mentee network

We scraped all meta-information available from
the ACL Anthology2 for arguably the most cen-
tral publication venues in NLP. This includes all
papers from CoNLL, EACL, TACL, CL, ACL,
EMNLP, COLING, ANLP, NAACL, *Sem/Se-
mEval from 1965 to 2017: 19,552 papers in total.

We carried out some normalisation of the author
names scraped by lower-casing, normalising for
order (first name then last name), removing middle
initials and title abbreviations, and removing ac-
cents and punctuation, collapsing the extracted list
of 18,437 author names to a list of 17,232 author
names. Following this, we applied several gen-
dered first-name lists to automatically annotate a
large portion of the author names with gender.3

This resulted in 13,435 automatically annotated
author names. Of the remaining 3797 unannotated
names, we automatically label as ’unknown’ all
author names with only an initial standing for the
first name, effectively filtering out a further 565
author names. The remaining 3232 author names

were annotated by the current authors by manually
inspecting the results of Google Image queries for
the full name.

The resulting dataset spans 52 years and in-
cludes 17,232 authors, of which we labeled 10,382
as male, 5,227 as female and 1,623 whose gen-
der we could not identify. In what remains of our
study, we discard these latter authors. This leaves
a total of 15,609 researchers.

Power in academia. In our study, we need to
account for mentor status–a type of seniority and
power. As in many other fields, in NLP it is cus-
tomary for mentors to take the last-authorship po-
sition of papers. Though there can be exceptions
to this custom, the assumption of mentor last-
authorship is simple, and with this large dataset,
we believe it provides a robust approximation of
mentorship in the absence of other more precise
indications like centralised supervision logs. This
method was also adopted by Avin et al. (2015).

We use the assumption of mentor last-
authorship to provide an empirical definition of
a mentor in our dataset. We say that after
t last-authored papers for some threshold t ∈
{1, . . . , 10}, and excluding all sole-author papers,

http://www.aclweb.org/anthology

a researcher is considered to hold mentor standing
with seniority threshold t.

We model the interactions between researchers
by creating the bi-populated (for female and male
populations) mentor-mentee network. The net-
work’s nodes therefore are researchers and there
is an edge between two co-authors of a paper in
our dataset if and only if one of the co-authors is
the last author. This leaves a mentor-mentee net-
work with 14248 nodes, 25211 edges, and average
degree 3.539. This network allows us to observe
whether the current system of mentor-mentee rela-
tionships entails a glass ceiling effect in the mod-
eled community. We now present the results of
this analysis.

3 Evidence of a rising gender gap
We provide some basic empirical evidence which
could be indicative of the presence of a glass ceil-
ing effect in NLP. In Section 4, we then prove that
there is indeed a glass ceiling.

3.1 Growing mentor standing disparity
A researcher who has achieved some seniority is
generally eligible to become a mentor and super-
vise students. As such, the rise to becoming a
mentor is a measurable criterion of success for
a researcher in academia. Concretely, in some
countries, the mentor role is reserved for perma-
nent/tenured faculty (for example, in Denmark).
Therefore a barrier to mentor standing for females
can lead to an important under-representation of
women. This under-representation in turn may
perpetuate itself through the lower availability of
same-gender advisors for female students, which
we show to be of central importance for rising
NLP researchers (in Section 3.3).

Figure 2: The proportion of female researchers
(blue line) in NLP has been gradually increasing
since 1965, but seems to be leveling off at around
33.5%, with a very slight decrease since 2014. A
corresponding decrease is observed for male NLP
researchers (red line).

For thresholds of “mentor seniority” t ∈
{2, . . . , 10} we examined the proportion of men-
tors with respect to the pool of researchers of the
same gender over time from 1966 to today. Fig-
ure 1 shows the resulting time series. Across
all thresholds, we observe that the proportion of
male supervisors with respect to the total num-
ber of male researchers is increasing faster than
the proportion of female supervisors within the
general pool of female researchers. In fact, the
discrepancy between these two proportions seems
to slowly close until the early-to-mid 2000s after
which it steadily increases again. And in almost all
cases this difference in proportions develops into a
statistically significant difference (with a 1-sided
z-test for proportions, and p-value 0.05). This is
despite there being no corresponding development
in mentor-mentee proportions as shown in Figure
2.

3.2 Time to seniority gap
We further investigate the subset of female re-
searchers who achieved mentor standing, and
compare their difficulty in doing so with that of
the respective pool of male researchers. One mea-
surable factor from our dataset is time. Isolat-
ing a substantially larger delay to achieving men-
tor standing for female researchers is one way to
use our dataset to measure the difficulty in transi-
tioning female researchers from mentee to mentor
standing. We consider the average time it takes
to achieve mentor standing between the two pop-
ulations. For consecutive periods of two years,
we compute the average number of years for re-
searchers to achieve mentor standing at thresh-
old t ∈ {2, . . . , 10}. We provide a visualisation
of the results in Figure 3. We do a two sample
t-test to expose the statistical significance in the
non-equality of the respective means. We observe
that across all thresholds for mentor standing, fe-
male researchers are substantially more delayed
than male researchers in becoming mentors. For
the most recent numbers, the result is most sig-
nificant where there is the most data, at seniority
t = 3, with p-level 0.04. However we note the
general whitening of the plots (indicating statisti-
cal significance) after the mid-2000s.

3.3 The effects of in-gender supervision
The availability of female mentors been has shown
to correlate with mentees’ future success–in par-
ticular, females in Chemistry who are mentored by

difference in means, the whiter the background.

various thresholds t.

female supervisors are considerably more likely
to become faculty themselves (Gaule and Piacen-
tini, 2018). In Table 1 we observe a similar trend

for in-gender mentorship. In particular, female
researchers who have female mentors are much
more likely to become mentors themselves. This
is a particular problem if, as Sections 3.1 and 3.2
show, the proportion of female NLP mentors is not
increasing at the same rate as that of male NLP
researchers, possibly due in part to the added de-
lay in achieving mentor status for women. Indeed
this delay in access, perpetuated due to the lack of
in-gender supervision, can be the result of a glass
ceiling in NLP. In the next section we investigate
the likelihood of such a glass ceiling.

4 The glass ceiling effect in NLP
In order to understand better how the population
of female researchers in NLP can be increasing,
but the growth level of seniority/mentor standing
still falls significantly below that of the male pop-
ulation and that this gap is widening, we turn to
an investigation of power inequality and the glass
ceiling effect.

First three key observations can be made of the
mentor-mentee network introduced in Section 2
vis-à-vis three well-accepted mechanisms of ob-
served human behavior.

(O1) Minority-majority partition. Figure 2 shows
the resulting proportion of male and female re-
searchers in NLP through the 52 years. Our
network displays a minority-majority partition:
the proportion of females has hovered around
33.5% for the past decade now.

(O2) Homophily is the is the tendency of individuals
to associate with people similar to them.
Easley and Kleinberg (2010) provide the fol-
lowing test for homophily. Given the propor-
tions of male and female ended edges in the
network, we should be able to calculate the ap-
proximate proportion of mixed edges (the prob-
ability that we select a mixed-gendered edge at
random). If the true fraction is significantly be-
low the expected amount, the network is ex-
hibiting homophily. Figure 4 shows that ho-
mophily is a consistently worsening problem in
the NLP community. All numbers are signifi-
cant with p-value virtually 0 (1-sided z-test for
proportions). Note that the plot includes error
bars, which are so small they are not visible.

(O3) The “rich-get-richer” feedback mechanism
describes and explains the process of wealth
concentration, by which the future distribution
of wealth is predictable from empirical data



2797

based on the current wealth distribution.
In our network, the degree of a node captures
its level of social wealth: people may try to
connect more often to people who already have
many connections, either in order to profit from
their social wealth or because they are more
visible in the network. In our NLP mentor-
mentee network, the average degree for male
researcher nodes is 3.356, while for females
it is 3.186. Hence our mentor-mentee net-
work exhibits a “rich-get-richer” mechanism in
favour of male researchers.

Figure 4: Evidence of ever-increasing homophily.
The expected number of mixed-gender interac-
tions is higher than the observed.

The biased preferential attachment model.
Avin et al. (2015) extend Barabási and Albert
(1999)’s preferential attachment model that was
originally based on the “rich-get-richer” feedback
mechanism to a biased preferential attachment
model of mentor-mentee dynamics, G(n, f, p),
where there further is (1) a minority-majority par-
tition (the proportion of female nodes is less than
half, f < 12 ) and (2) homophily. The model
works as follows, instantiated to our context. Over
time, a sequence of bi-populated mentor-mentee
networks is constructed, Gt = (Vt, Et), like the
one described in Section 2. Vt = Ft ∪Mt is the
set of Gt’s nodes, and Et its edges, where Ft(Mt)
is the set of female (male) nodes. G0 is the empty
graph. At each time t > 0 a mentee enters the net-
work. The mentee is a female with probability f
and a male with probabilitym = 1−f . Assuming
a rich-get-richer mechanism, the mentee chooses a
potential mentor according to that mentor’s impor-
tance in the network: with probability δt(u)∑

v∈Vt
δt(v)

where δt(v) is the degree of v ∈ Vt. If this su-
pervision is in-gender, then a relation (edge) is es-
tablished. However if genders differ, then the re-
lation (edge) is established according to the prob-
ability of homophily (p); otherwise (with proba-

bility (1 − p)) it is rejected and the mentee must
restart the process of finding a mentor. Once an ad-
visor for the mentee has been found, t increments
to the next time step.

We now introduce definitions and the main the-
orem established by (Avin et al., 2015) for con-
ditions of the existence of power inequality and a
glass ceiling effect in bi-populated networks. Then
we empirically check for these conditions in our
NLP mentor-mentee network for the main result.
Power inequality definition. The sequence of
mentor-mentee networks Gt is said to exhibit
a power inequality effect for females if the
average power of a female node is strictly
bounded by the power of a male node: i.e.,

limt→∞
1

|Ft|
∑

v∈Ft
δt(v)

1
|Mt|

∑
v∈Mt

δt(v)
< 1.

Tail and moment glass ceiling definitions. Let
topk(Ft) (topk(Mt)) denote the number of female
(male) nodes that have degree of at least k in Gt–
this is the group of scholars whose wealth in re-
lations in the network is at level at least k; this
wealth of relations is a form of power. The glass
ceiling effect for the minority of females describes
a process by which the proportion of access to this
wealth of relations is limited for females but not
for males. Formally, the sequence Gt is said to
exhibit a tail glass ceiling effect for the female
nodes (the minority) if there exists an increasing
sequence kt such that limt→∞ topkt(Mt) = ∞
and limt→∞

topkt (Ft)
topkt (Mt)

= 0. Gt exhibits a mo-
ment glass ceiling g for the female nodes, if g =

limt→∞
1

|Ft|
∑

v∈Ft
δt(v)2

1
|Mt|

∑
v∈Mt

δt(v)2
. And if g = 0, Gt has a

strong glass ceiling effect.

The main result: Power inequality and glass
ceiling. Avin et al. (2015) proved that if 0 <
f < 12 and 0 < p < 1, then for G(n, f, p)
produced by the biased preferential attachment
model, G(n, f, p) exhibits both power inequality
and a tail and strong glass ceiling effects. In ob-
servations (O2) and (O3), we identified the con-
ditions f = 0.335 < 0.5 and the existence of
homophily (i.e., 0 < p < 1) in our NLP mentor-
mentee network. We have therefore shown there to
exist power inequality and a glass ceiling in NLP.

5 Concluding remarks
Given our study of the mentee-mentor network for
NLP, we have shown that there is a glass ceiling
for female researchers in NLP that has taken a hold
of the field since the mid-2000s.
