Abstract

In this work, we train an Automatic Post-
Editing (APE) model and use it to reveal bi-
ases in standard Machine Translation (MT)
evaluation procedures. The goal of our APE
model is to correct typical errors introduced
by the translation process, and convert the
“translationese” output into natural text. Our
APE model is trained entirely on monolin-
gual data that has been round-trip translated
through English, to mimic errors that are
similar to the ones introduced by NMT. We
apply our model to the output of existing
NMT systems, and demonstrate that, while the
human-judged quality improves in all cases,
BLEU scores drop with forward-translated test
sets. We verify these results for the WMT18
English→German, WMT15 English→French,
and WMT16 English→Romanian tasks. Fur-
thermore, we selectively apply our APE model
on the output of the top submissions of the
most recent WMT evaluation campaigns. We
see quality improvements on all tasks of up to
2.5 BLEU points.

1 Introduction

Neural Machine Translation (NMT) (Bahdanau
et al., 2015; Gehring et al., 2017; Vaswani et al.,
2017) is currently the most popular approach in
Machine Translation leading to state-of-the-art
performance for many tasks. NMT relies mainly
on parallel training data, which can be an expen-
sive and scarce resource. There are several ap-
proaches to leverage monolingual data for NMT:
Language model fusion for both phrase-based
(Brants et al., 2007) and neural MT (Gülçehre
et al., 2015, 2017), back-translation (Sennrich
et al., 2016b), unsupervised NMT (Lample et al.,
2018a; Artetxe et al., 2018a), dual learning (Cheng
et al., 2016; He et al., 2016; Xia et al., 2017), and
multi-task learning (Domhan and Hieber, 2017).

In this paper, we present a different approach to
leverage monolingual data, which can be used as
a post-processor for any existing translation. The
idea is to train an Automatic Post-Editing (APE)
system that is only trained on a large amount
of synthetic data, to fix typical errors introduced
by the translation process. During training, our
model uses a noisy version of each sentence as
input and learns how to reconstruct the origi-
nal sentence. In this work, we model the noise
with round-trip translations (RTT) through En-
glish, translating a sentence in the target language
into English, then translating the result back into
the original language. We train our APE model
with a standard transformer model on the WMT18
English→German, WMT15 English→French and
WMT16 English→Romanian monolingual News
Crawl data and apply this model on the output of
NMT models that are either trained on all avail-
able bitext or trained on a combination of bitext
and back-translated monolingual data. Further-
more, we show that our APE model can be used as
a post-processor for the best output of the recent
WMT evaluation campaigns, where it improves
even the output of these well engineered transla-
tion systems.

In addition to measuring quality in terms of
BLEU scores on the standard WMT test sets,
we split each test set into two subsets based
on whether the source or target is the origi-
nal sentence (each sentence is either originally
written in the source or target language and
human-translated into the other). We call these
the source-language-original and target-language-
original halves, respectively. We find that evaluat-
ing our post-edited output on the source-language-
original half actually decreases the BLEU scores,
whereas the BLEU scores improve for the target-
language-original half. This is in line with results
from Koppel and Ordan (2011), who demonstrate



35

that the mere fact of being translated plays a cru-
cial role in the makeup of a translated text, mak-
ing the actual (human) translation a less natural
example of the target language. We hypothesize
that, given these findings, the consistent decreases
in BLEU scores on test sets whose source side are
natural text does not mean that the actual output
is of lower quality. To verify this hypothesis, we
run human evaluations for different outputs with
and without APE. The human ratings demonstrate
that the output of the APE model is both consis-
tently more accurate and consistently more fluent,
regardless of whether the source or the target lan-
guage is the original language, contradicting the
corresponding BLEU scores.

To summarize the contributions of the paper:

• We introduce an APE model trained only on
synthetic data generated with RTT for fixing
typical translation errors from NMT output
and investigate its scalability. To the best of
our knowledge, this paper is the first to study
the effect of an APE system trained at scale
and only on synthetic data.

• We improve the BLEU of top submissions of
the recent WMT evaluation campaigns.

• We show that the BLEU scores of the APE
output only correlate well with human ratings
when they are calculated with target-original
references.

• We propose separately reporting scores on
test sets whose source sentences are trans-
lated and whose target sentences are trans-
lated, and call for higher-quality test sets.

2 APE with RTT

2.1 Definition and Training
We formalize our APE model as a translation
model from synthetic “translationese” (Geller-
stam, 1986) text in one language to natural text
in the same language. For a language pair (X , Y )
and a monolingual corpus MY in language Y , the
training procedure is as follows:

1. Train two translation models on bitext for
X→Y and Y→X

2. Use these models to generate round-trip
translations for every target-language sen-
tence y in MY , resulting in the synthetic
dataset RTT(MY ).

3. Train a translation model on pairs of
(RTT(y), y), that translates from the round-
tripped version of a sentence to its original
form.

This procedure is illustrated in Figure 1.

2.2 Application
Given a trained translation model and a trained
APE model, the procedure is simply to a) trans-
late any source text from language X to language
Y with the translation model, and b) post-edit the
output of the translation by passing it through the
APE model. In this sense, the APE model may
also be viewed as a paraphrasing model to produce
“naturalized” text. This procedure is illustrated in
Figure 2.

3 Experimental Setup

3.1 Architecture
For the translation models, we use the trans-
former implementation in lingvo (Shen et al.,
2019), using the transformer-base model size for
Romanian→English and transformer-big model
size (Vaswani et al., 2017) for German→English
and French→English. The reverse mod-
els, English→Romanian, English→German and
English→French, are all transformer-big. All use
a vocabulary of 32k subword units, and exponen-
tially moving averaging of checkpoints (EMA de-
cay) with the weight decrease parameter set to
α = 0.999 (Buduma and Locascio, 2017).

The APE models are also transformer models
with 32k subword units and EMA decay trained



36

with lingvo. For the German and the French APE
models, we use the transformer-big size, whereas
for the Romanian APE model, we use the smaller
transformer-base setup as we have less monolin-
gual data.

3.2 Evaluation
We report BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and human
evaluations. All BLEU scores are calculated with
sacreBLEU (Post, 2018)1.

Since 2014, the organizers of the WMT evalua-
tion campaign (Bojar et al., 2017) have created test
sets with the following method: first, they crawled
monolingual data in both English and the target
language from news stories from online sources.
Thereafter they took about 1500 English sentences
and translated them into the target language, and
an additional 1500 sentences from the target lan-
guage and translated them into English. This re-
sults in test sets of about 3000 sentences for each
English-X language pair. The sgm files of each
WMT test set include the original language for
each sentence.

Therefore, in addition to reporting overall
BLEU scores on the different test sets, we also re-
port results on the two subsets (based on the orig-
inal language) of each newstest20XX, which we
call the {German,French,Romanian}-original and
English-original halves of the test set. This is mo-
tivated by Koppel and Ordan (2011), who demon-
strated that they can train a simple classifier to
distinguish human-translated text from natural text
with high accuracy. These text categorization ex-
periments suggest that both the source language
and the mere fact of being translated play a cru-
cial role in the makeup of a translated text. One of
the major goals of our APE model is to rephrase
the NMT output in a more natural way, aiming to
remove undesirable translation artifacts that have
been introduced.

To collect human rankings, we present each out-
put to crowd-workers, who were asked to score
each sentence on a 5-point scale for:

• fluency: How do you judge the overall natu-
ralness of the utterance in terms of its gram-
matical correctness and fluency?

Further, we included the source sentence and
asked the raters to evaluate each sentence on a 2-
point scale (binary decision) for:

1sacreBLEU signatures: BLEU+case.mixed+lang.en-
LANG+numrefs.1+smooth.exp+SET+tok.intl+version.1.2.20

• accuracy: Does the statement factually con-
tradict anything in the reference information?

Each task was given to three different raters.
Consequently, each output has a separate score for
each question that is the average of 3 different rat-
ings.

3.3 Data
For the round-trip experiments we use the mono-
lingual News Crawl data from the WMT evalua-
tion campaign. We remove duplicates and apply a
max-length filter on the source sentences and the
round-trip translations, filtering to the minimum of
500 characters or 70 tokens. For German, we con-
catenate all News Crawl data from 2007 to 2017,
comprising 216.5M sentences after filtering and
removing duplicates. For Romanian, we use News
Crawl ’16, comprising 2.2M sentences after filter-
ing and deduplication. For French, we concatenate
News Crawl data from 2007 to 2014, comprising
34M sentences after filtering.

Our translation models are trained on WMT18
(∼5M sentences for German after filtering),
WMT16 (∼0.5M sentences for Romanian after fil-
tering) and WMT15 (∼41M sentences for French)
bitext. For Romanian and German we filter sen-
tence pairs that have empty source or target, that
have source or target longer than 250 tokens, or
the ratio of whose length is greater than 2.0. For
English→German and English→French, we also
build a system based on noised back-translation,
as in Edunov et al. (2018). We use the same mono-
lingual sentences that we used for the APE model
to generate the noisy back-translation data.

4 Experiments

4.1 English→German
The results of our English→German experiments
are shown in Table 1. We trained the APE
model on RTT produced by English→German
and German→English NMT models that are only
trained on bitext. Applying the APE model on the
output of our NMT model also trained on only bi-
text improves the BLEU scores by up to 1.5 BLEU
points for newstest2014 and 0.7 BLEU points for
newstest2017. Nevertheless, the score drops by
1.4 points on newstest2016. To investigate the dif-
fering impact on the test sets, we split each test set
by its original language (Table 2). The APE model
consistently increases the BLEU on the German-
original half of the test set, but decreases the BLEU

on the English-original half. Consequentially, we
applied our APE model only on the sentences with
original language in German (+RTT APE de-orig
only in Table 1) and see consistent improvements
over all test sets with an average BLEU improve-
ment of 2.2 points.

To verify that the drop in BLEU score is be-
cause of the unnatural reference translations, we
run a human evaluation (see Section 3.2) for
both fluency/grammatical correctness and accu-
racy. Based on the human ratings (Table 3), our
APE model also improves on the English-original
half of the test set (which is a more realistic use
case).

Without re-training, we use the APE model that
is trained on the bitext RTT and apply it to a
stronger NMT system that also includes all the
available monolingual data in the form of noised
back-translation. We see a very similar pattern
to the previous experiments. Regarding auto-
matic scores, our APE model only improves on
the German-original part of the test sets, with an
average improvement of 1.3 BLEU points. The hu-
man evaluations show the same inconsistency with
the automatic scores for the English-original half.
As with the weaker baseline, humans rate the out-
put of our APE model at least as fluent and accu-
rate as the original output of the NMT model (Ta-
ble 3). Further, we also run a human evaluation on



38

the reference sentences and found that the scores
for both fluency and accuracy are only minimally
higher than for our APE NBT output.

Comparing only the BLEU scores from our bi-
text and NBT models in Table 2 reveals that aug-
menting the parallel data with back-translated data
also mostly improves the BLEU scores on the
German-original half of the test set. This is in line
with the results of our APE model and opens the
question of how much of the original bitext data is
natural on the target side.

As our APE model seems agnostic to the model
which produced the RTT, we applied it to the
best submissions of the recent WMT18 evalua-
tion campaign, applying to German-original half
of the test set only. Table 4 shows the results
for the 2 top submissions of Microsoft (Junczys-
Dowmunt, 2018) and Cambridge (Stahlberg et al.,
2018). Both systems improved by up to 0.8 points
in BLEU.

Table 4: BLEU scores for WMT18 English→German
newstest2018. We apply our APE model only on the
German-original half of the test set. BLEU scores are
calculated on the full newstest2018 set and the English-
original half is just copied from the submission.

Finally, we train our APE model on different
random subsets of the available 216.5M monolin-
gual data (see Figure 3). The average BLEU scores
on newstest2014-newstest2017 show that we can
achieve similar performance by using 24 million
training examples only, and that large improve-
ments are seen using as few as 4M training ex-
amples.

4.2 English→Romanian
Experimental results for the WMT16
English→Romanian task are summarized in
Table 5. By applying our APE model on top of
a baseline that is only trained on bitext, we see
improvements of 3.0 BLEU (dev) and 0.3 BLEU
(test) over our baseline system when we automat-
ically post edit only to the Romanian-original half
of the test set. Similar to English→German, we
apply our APE model on the top 2 submissions of
the WMT16 evaluation campaign (Table 6). Both

Experimental results for English→French are

dency as we saw for German and Romanian.
When applying our APE system on the output
of the bitext baseline, we get a small improve-
ment of 0.1 BLEU. By only post-editing the
French-original half, we get an improvement of
1.0 BLEU points. The same effect can be seen
on the English→French system that is trained with
Noised BT. We yield quality improvements of 0.8
BLEU by applying our APE model on the French-
original half of the test set only.

5 Example Output

We would like to highlight a few short exam-
ples where our APE model improves the NMT
translation in German. Although our APE model
is also quite helpful for long sentences, we will
focus on short examples for the sake of sim-
plicity. In Table 8 there are examples from the
English→German noised back-translated (NBT)
setup (see Table 1), with and without automatic
post editing. In the first example, NMT translates
club (i.e. cudgel) incorrectly into Club (i.e. orga-
nization). Based on the context of the sentence,
our APE model learned that club has to be trans-
lated into Schlagstock (i.e. cudgel). The next two
examples are very similar as our APE model im-
proves the word choice of the translations by tak-
ing the context of the sentence into account. The
NMT translations of the last two examples make
little sense and our APE model rephrases the out-
put into a fluent, meaningful sentence.

6 Discussion

In this section, we focus on the results on
target-language-original test sets, like the English-
original subset of newstest2016 (Table 2 and Ta-
ble 3), where the APE model lowered the score by
6 BLEU, yet improved human evaluations. A naı̈ve
take-away from this result would be that evalua-
tion sets whose target side is natural text are inher-
ently superior. However, translating from transla-
tionese also has its own problems, including 1) it
does not represent any real-world translation task,
and 2) translationese sources may be much easier
to translate “correctly”, and reward MT biases like
word-for-word translation. The take-away, there-
fore, must be to report scores both on the source-
language-original and the target-language-original
test sets, rather than lumping two test-sets together
into one as has heretofore been done. This gives
a higher-precision glimpse into the strengths and

weaknesses of different modeling techniques, and
may prevent some effects (like improvements in
naturalness of output) from being hidden.

Going forward, our results should also be seen
as a call for higher-quality test sets. Multi refer-
ence BLEU is one option and less likely to suffer
these biases as acutely, and has previously been
used in the NIST projects. Another option could
be to align sentence pairs from monolingual data
sets in two languages and run human evaluation to
exclude bad sentence pairs.

7 Related Work

Automatic Post-Editing
Probably most similar to our work, Junczys-
Dowmunt and Grundkiewicz (2016, 2018) uses
RTT as additional training data for the automatic
post-editing (APE) task of the WMT evaluation
campaign (Chatterjee et al., 2018). They claimed
that the provided post-editing data is orders of
magnitude too small to train neural models, and
combined the training data with artificial training
data generated with RTT. They found that the addi-
tional artificial data helps against early overfitting
and makes it possible to overcome the problem of
too little training data. In contrast to our work,
they do not report results for models only trained
on the artificial RTT data. Further, their RTT data
is much smaller (10M sentences) compared to ours
(up to 200M sentences) and they only report re-
sults for the APE subtask.

There have been several earlier approaches us-
ing RTT for APE. Hermet and Alain (2009) used
RTT to improve a standard preposition error de-
tection system. Although their evaluation corpus
was limited to 133 prepositions, the hybrid system
outperformed their standard method by roughly
13%. Madnani et al. (2012) combined RTT ob-
tained from Google Translate via 8 different pivot
languages into a lattice for grammatical error cor-
rection. Similar to system combination, their final
output is extracted by the shortest path scored by
different features. They claimed that their prelim-
inary experiments yield fairly satisfactory results
but leave significant room for improvement.

Back-translation
Back-translation (Sennrich et al., 2016b; Ponce-
las et al., 2018) augments relatively scarce par-
allel data with plentiful monolingual data, allow-
ing one to train source-to-target (S2T) models with
the help of target-to-source (T2S) models. Specif-

ically, given a set of sentences in the target lan-
guage, a pre-constructed T2S translation system
is used to generate translations to the source lan-
guage. These synthetic sentence pairs are com-
bined with the original bilingual data when train-
ing the S2T NMT model.

Iterative Back-translation
Iterative back-translation (Zhang et al., 2018; Cot-
terell and Kreutzer, 2018; Hoang et al., 2018) is
a joint training algorithm to enhance the effect of
monolingual source and target data by iteratively
boosting the source-to-target and target-to-source
translation models. The joint training method uses
the monolingual data and updates NMT models
through several iterations. A variety of flavors of
iterative back-translation have been proposed, in-
cluding Niu et al. (2018), who simultaneously per-
form iterative S2T and T2S back-translation in a
multilingual model, and He et al. (2016); Xia et al.
(2017), who combine dual learning with phases of
back- and forward-translation.

Artetxe et al. (2018a,b) and Lample et al.
(2018a,b) used iterative back-translation to train
two unsupervised translation systems in both di-
rections (X→Y and Y→X) in parallel. Further,
they used back-translation to generate a synthetic
source to construct a dev set for tuning the parame-
ters of their unsupervised statistical machine trans-
lation system. In a similar formulation, Cheng
et al. (2016) jointly learn a translation system with
a round-trip autoencoder.

Round-tripping and Paraphrasing
Round-trip translation has seen success as a

method to generate paraphrases. Bannard and
Callison-Burch (2005) extracted paraphrases by
using alternative phase translations from bilingual
phrase tables from Statistical Machine Transla-
tion. Mallinson et al. (2017) presented PARANET,
a neural paraphrasing model based on round-trip
translations with NMT. They showed that their
paraphrase model outperforms all traditional para-
phrase models.

Wu et al. (2018) train a paraphrasing model
on (X,RTT(X)) pairs, translating from natural
text into a simplified version. They apply this
sentence-simplifier on the source sentences of the
training data and report quality gains for IWSLT.

Translationese and Artifacts from NMT
The difference between translated sentence pairs
based on whether the source or the target is the
original sentence has long been recognized by the
human translation community, but only partially
investigated by the machine translation commu-
nity. An introduction to the latter is presented
in Koppel and Ordan (2011), who train a high-
accuracy classifier to distinguish human-translated
text from natural text in the Europarl corpus. This
is in line with research from the professional trans-
lation community, which has seen various works
investigating both systematic biases inherent to
translated texts (Baker, 1993; Selinker, 1972), as
well as biases resulting specifically from interfer-
ence from the source text (Toury, 1995). There
has similarly long been a focus on the conflict be-
tween Fidelity (the extent to which the translation
is faithful to the source) and Transparency (the ex-



41

tent to which the translation appears to be a natu-
ral sentence in the target language) (Warner, 2018;
Schleiermacher, 1816; Dryden, 1685). To frame
our hypotheses in these terms, the present work
hypothesizes that outputs from NMT systems of-
ten err on the side of disfluent fidelity, or word-by-
word translation.

There are a few papers that discuss the effect of
translationese on MT models. Lembersky et al.
(2012); Stymne (2017) explored how the trans-
lation direction for statistical machine translation
affects the translation result. They found that
using training and tuning data translated in the
same direction as the translation systems tends
to give the best results. Holmqvist et al. (2009)
noted that the original language of the test sen-
tences influences the BLEU score of translations.
They showed that the BLEU scores for target-
original sentences are on average higher than sen-
tences that have their original source in a differ-
ent language. Popel (2018) split the WMT Czech-
English test set based on the original language.
They found that when training on synthetic data,
the model performs much better on the Czech-
original half than on the non Czech-original half.
When trained on authentic data, it is the other way
round. Fomicheva et al. (2017) found that both the
average score and Pearson correlation with human
judgments is substantially higher when both the
MT output and human translation were generated
from the same source language.

8 Ablation

8.1 Iterative APE

We can apply our APE model in an iterative fash-
ion several times on the same output. In Table 9,
we applied our APE model on the already post-
edited output to see if we can further naturalize the
sentences. As a result, 75% of the sentences did
not change. The remaining sentences lowered the
BLEU scores on average by 0.1 points for German-
original half and by 0.7 points for the English-
original half of the test sets.

8.2 Reverse APE

Instead of training an APE model on (RTT(y), y)
sentence pairs (see Section 2), we train in this
section a reverse APE model that flips source
and target and is trained on (y,RTT(y)) sentence
pairs. Experimental results can be seen in Ta-
ble 10. Overall, the performance decreases on

both the German-original half and the English-
original half. Interestingly, the BLEU scores of the
reverse APE model on the English-original half
are higher than those of the normal APE model.
This demonstrates again that sentences evaluated
on the English-original half prefer output that is
biased by the translation process.

8.3 Inside the black box of RTT

In this subsection we are interested in how much
RTT changes translation outputs. We calculate
the BLEU scores of all English→German test sets
(11,175 sentences in total) by taking the original
German sentences as references and their RTT as
hypotheses. Although the RTT hypotheses are a
less clean (paraphrased) version of the references,
having been forward-translated from an already
noisy back-translated source, the BLEU score is
40.9, with unigram precision of 72.3%, bigram
precision of 48.9%, trigram precision of 35.6%
and 4gram precision of 26.6%.

We further found that the original sentences
use a larger vocabulary than the artificial RTT
data. While the output of the RTT has only
29,635 unique tokens, the original sentences con-
tain 33,814 unique tokens. Even more interest-
ing, the NMT output (from the model trained only



42

on bitext) of the same test sets has a vocabulary
size of 30,540, but after running our APE on the
same test sets the vocabulary size increases to
31,471. The NMT output from the NBT model
has a vocabulary size of 32,170 and its post-edited
version increases the number of unique words to
32,283. Overall, we see that both the RTT and
the NMT output have a smaller vocabulary size
than the original or post-edited versions, and that
BLEU score grows directly with increased number
of unique tokens in the target side.

9 Conclusion

We propose an APE model that is only trained on
RTT and increases the quality of NMT transla-
tions, measured both by BLEU and human evalu-
ation. We see improvements both when automati-
cally post editing our model translations and when
automatically post editing outputs from the win-
ning submissions to the WMT competition. Our
APE has the advantage that it is agnostic to the
model which produced the translations, and so can
be used on top of any new advance in the field,
without need for re-training. Further, we demon-
strate that we need only a subset of 24M training
examples to train our APE model. We further-
more use this model as a tool to reveal system-
atic problems with reference translations, and pro-
pose finer-grained BLEU reporting on both source-
language-original test sets and target-language-
original test sets, as well as calling for higher-
quality and multi-reference test sets.
