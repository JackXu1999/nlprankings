Abstract

A spoken language understanding (SLU) sys-
tem includes two main tasks, slot filling (SF)
and intent detection (ID). The joint model for
the two tasks is becoming a tendency in SLU.
But the bi-directional interrelated connections
between the intent and slots are not established
in the existing joint models. In this paper,
we propose a novel bi-directional interrelated
model for joint intent detection and slot fill-
ing. We introduce an SF-ID network to es-
tablish direct connections for the two tasks
to help them promote each other mutually.
Besides, we design an entirely new iteration
mechanism inside the SF-ID network to en-
hance the bi-directional interrelated connec-
tions. The experimental results show that the
relative improvement in the sentence-level se-
mantic frame accuracy of our model is 3.79%
and 5.42% on ATIS and Snips datasets, respec-
tively, compared to the state-of-the-art model.

1 Introduction

Spoken language understanding plays an impor-
tant role in spoken dialogue system. SLU aims
at extracting the semantics from user utterances.
Concretely, it identifies the intent and captures se-
mantic constituents. These two tasks are known as
intent detection and slot filling (Tur and De Mori,
2011), respectively. For instance, the sentence
‘what flights leave from phoenix’ sampled from
the ATIS corpus is shown in Table 1. It can be
seen that each word in the sentence corresponds to
one slot label, and a specific intent is assigned for
the whole sentence.

Traditional pipeline approaches manage the two
mentioned tasks separately. Intent detection is
seen as a semantic classification problem to pre-
dict the intent label. General approaches such
as support vector machine (SVM) (Haffner et al.,
2003) and recurrent neural network (RNN) (Lai
et al., 2015) can be applied. Slot filling is re-
garded as a sequence labeling task. Popular ap-
proaches include conditional random field (CRF)
(Raymond and Riccardi, 2007), long short-term
memory (LSTM) networks (Yao et al., 2014).

Considering the unsatisfactory performance of
pipeline approaches caused by error propagation,
the tendency is to develop a joint model (Chen
et al., 2016a; Zhang and Wang, 2016) for intent de-
tection and slot filling tasks. Liu and Lane (2016)
proposed an attention-based RNN model. How-
ever, it just applied a joint loss function to link the
two tasks implicitly. Hakkani-Tür et al. (2016) in-
troduced a RNN-LSTM model where the explicit
relationships between the slots and intent are not
established. Goo et al. (2018) proposed a slot-
gated model which applies the intent information
to slot filling task and achieved superior perfor-
mance. But the slot information is not used in in-
tent detection task. The bi-directional direct con-
nections are still not established. In fact, the slots
and intent are correlative, and the two tasks can
mutually reinforce each other. This paper pro-
poses an SF-ID network which consists of an SF
subnet and an ID subnet. The SF subnet applies
intent information to slot filling task while the ID
subnet uses slot information in intent detection
task. In this case, the bi-directional interrelated
connections for the two tasks can be established.
Our contributions are summarized as follows: 1)
We propose an SF-ID network to establish the in-
terrelated mechanism for slot filling and intent de-
tection tasks. Specially, a novel ID subnet is pro-
posed to apply the slot information to intent detec-

tion task. 2) We establish a novel iteration mecha-
nism inside the SF-ID network in order to enhance
the connections between the intent and slots. 3)
The experiments on two benchmark datasets show
the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed
model.

2 Proposed Approaches

This section first introduces how we acquire the
integration of context of slots and intent by atten-
tion mechanism. And then it presents an SF-ID
network which establishes the direct connections
between intent and slots. The model architecture
based on bi-directional LSTM (BLSTM) is shown
in Figure 2.1

2.1 Integration of Context

In SLU, word tags are determined not only by the
corresponding terms, but also the context (Chen
et al., 2016b). The intent label is also relevant with
every element in the utterance. To capture such de-
pendencies, attention mechanism is introduced.
Slot filling: The ith slot context vector cislot is
computed as the weighted sum of BLSTM’s hid-
den states (h1, ..., ht):

cislot =

T∑
j=1

αSi,jhj (1)

where the attention weight α is acquired the same
way as in (Liu and Lane, 2016).
Intent detection: The intent context vector cinte
is calculated as the same way as cslot, in particu-
lar, it just generates one intent label for the whole
sentence.

2.2 SF-ID Network
The SF-ID network consists of an SF subnet and
an ID subnet. The order of the SF and ID subnets
can be customized. Depending on the order of the
two subnets, the model have two modes: SF-First
and ID-First. The former subnet can produce ac-
tive effects to the latter one by a medium vector.

2.2.1 SF-First Mode
In the SF-First mode, the SF subnet is executed
first. We apply the intent context vector cinte and
slot context vector cslot in the SF subnet and gener-
ate the slot reinforce vector rslot. Then, the newly-
formed vector rslot is fed to the ID subnet to bring
the slot information.
SF subnet: The SF subnet applies the intent and
slot information (i.e. cinte and cslot) in the calcu-
lation of a correlation factor f which can indicate
the relationship of the intent and slots. This corre-
lation factor f is defined by:

f =
∑

V ∗ tanh(cislot +W ∗ cinte) (2)

In addition, we introduce a slot reinforce vector
rslot defined by (3), and it is fed to the ID subnet
to bring slot information.

rislot = f · cislot (3)

ID subnet: We introduce a novel ID subnet which
applies the slot information to the intent detection
task. We believe that the slots represent the word-
level information while the intent stands for the
sentence-level. The hybrid information can ben-
efit the intent detection task. The slot reinforce
vector rslot is fed to the ID subnet to generate the
reinforce vector r, which is defined by:

r =
T∑
i=1

αi · rislot (4)

Figure 2: Illustration of the ID subnet

where the weight αi of rislot is computed as:

αi =
exp(ei,i)∑T
j=1 exp(ei,j)

(5)

ei,j =W ∗ tanh(V1 ∗ rislot + V2 ∗ hj + b) (6)

We also introduce an intent reinforce vector rinte
which is computed as the sum of the reinforce vec-
tor r and intent context vector rinte.

rinte = r + cinte (7)

Iteration Mechanism: The intent reinforce vector
rinte can also be fed into the SF subnet. In fact,
this intent reinforce vector rinte can improve the
effect of relation factor f because it contains the
hybrid information of intent and slots, and (2) can
be replaced by:

f =
∑

V ∗ tanh(cislot +W ∗ rinte) (8)

With the change in the relation factor f , a new
slot reinforce vector rslot is acquired. Thus, the
ID subnet can takes a new rslot and exports a new
rinte. In this case, both SF subnet and ID subnet
are updated, one iteration is completed.

In theory, the interaction between the SF sub-
net and ID subnet can repeat endlessly, which is
denoted as the iteration mechanism in our model.
The intent and slot reinforce vectors act as the
links between the SF subnet and the ID subnet and
their values continuously change during the itera-
tion process.

After the iteration mechanism, the rinte and
rslot participate in the final prediction of intent and
slots, respectively. For the intent detection task,
the intent reinforce vector rinte and the last hidden
state hT of BLSTM are utilized in the final intent
prediction:

yinte = softmax(W
hy
inteconcat(hT , rinte)) (9)

For the slot filling task, the hidden state hi com-
bined with its corresponding slot reinforce vector
rislot are used in the i

th slot label prediction. The
final expression without CRF layer is:

yislot = softmax(W
hy
slotconcat(hi, r

i
slot)) (10)

2.2.2 ID-First Mode
In the ID-First mode, the ID subnet is performed
before the SF subnet. In this case, there are some
differences in the calculation of ID subnet in the
first iteration.
ID subnet: Unlike the Slot-First mode, the rein-
force vector r is acquired by the hidden states and
the context vectors of BLSTM. Thus, (4) (5) (6)
can be replaced by:

r =
T∑
i=1

αi · hi (11)

αi =
exp(ei,i)∑T
j=1 exp(ei,j)

(12)

ei,j =W ∗ σ(V1 ∗ hi + V2 ∗ cjslot + b) (13)

The intent reinforce vector rinte is still defined by
(7), and it is fed to the SF subnet.
SF subnet: The intent reinforce vector rinte is fed
to the SF subnet and the relation factor f is calcu-
lated the same way as (8). Other algorithm details
are the same as in SF-First mode.
Iteration Mechanism: Iteration mechanism in
ID-First mode is almost the same as that in SF-
First mode except for the order of the two subnets.

2.3 CRF layer
Slot filling is essentially a sequence labeling prob-
lem. For the sequence labeling task, it is beneficial
to consider the correlations between the labels in
neighborhoods. Therefore, we add the CRF layer
above the SF subnet outputs to jointly decode the
best chain of labels of the utterance.

3 Experiment

Dataset: We conducted experiments using two
public datasets, the widely-used ATIS dataset
(Hemphill et al., 1990) and custom-intent-engine
dataset called the Snips (Coucke et al., 2018),
which is collected by Snips personal voice assis-
tant. Compared with the ATIS dataset, the Snips
dataset is more complex due to its large vocabu-
lary and cross-domain intents.
Evaluation Metrics: We use three evaluation

metrics in the experiments. For the slot filling
task, the F1-score is applied. For the intent de-
tection task, the accuracy is utilized. Besides, the
sentence-level semantic frame accuracy (sentence
accuracy) is used to indicate the general perfor-
mance of both tasks, which refers to proportion
of the sentence whose slots and intent are both
correctly-predicted in the whole corpus.
Training Details: In our experiments, the layer
size for the BLSTM networks is set to 64. Dur-
ing training, the adam optimization (Kingma and
Ba, 2014) is applied. Besides, the learning rate is
updated by ηt = η0/(1 + pt) with a decay rate of
p = 0.05 and an initial learning rate of η0 = 0.01,
and t denotes the number of completed steps.
Model Performance: The performance of the
models are given in Table 2, wherein it can be
seen that our model outperforms the baselines in
all three aspects: slot filling (F1), intent detection
(Acc) and sentence accuracy (Acc). Specially, on
the sentence-level semantic frame results, the rel-
ative improvement is around 3.79% and 5.42% for
ATIS and Snips respectively, indicating that SF-
ID network can benefit the SLU performance sig-
nificantly by introducing the bi-directional interre-
lated mechanism between the slots and intent.
Analysis of Seperate Subnets: We analyze the
effect of seperate subnets, and the obtained results
are given in Table 3. The experiments are con-
ducted when the CRF layer is added. As we can

Figure 3: Effect of iteration number on the model per-
formance in SF-First mode

see, both models including only the SF subnet or
the ID subnet have acheived better results than the
BLSTM model. Therefore, we believe that both
SF subnet and ID subnet have significance in per-
formance improvement.

Beside, we also analyse the condition with inde-
pendent SF and ID subnet, in other words, when
there is no interaction in SF and ID subnet. We
can see it also obtains good results. However, the
SF-ID network which allows the two subnets inter-
act with each other achieve better results. This is
because the bi-directional interrelated mechanism
help the two subnets promote each other mutually,
which improves the performance in both tasks.
Analysis of Model Mode: In Table 2, it can be
seen that the ID-First mode achieves better perfor-
mance in the slot filling task. This is because the
ID-First mode treats the slot filling task as a more
important task, because the SF subnet can utilize
the intent information output from the ID subnet.
Similarly, the SF-First mode performs better in the
intent detection task. In general, the difference be-
tween the two modes is minor.
Iteration Mechanism: The effect of iteration
mechanism is shown in Figure 3. The experiments
are conducted in SF-First mode. Sentence accu-
racy is applied as the performance measure be-
cause it can reflect the overall model performance.
It increases gradually and reaches the maximum
value when the iteration number is three on both
ATIS and Snips dataset, indicating the effective-



5471

ness of iteration mechanism. It may credit to the
iteration mechanism which can enhance the con-
nections between intent and slots. After that, the
sentence accuracy gradually gets stabilized with
minor drop. On balance, the iteration mechanism
with proper iteration number can benefit the SLU
performance.
CRF Layer: From Table 2 it can be seen that
the CRF layer has a positive effect on the general
model performance. This is because the CRF layer
can obtain the maximum possible label sequence
on the sentence level. However, CRF layer mainly
focuses on sequence labeling problems. So the
improvement of the slot filling task obviously ex-
ceeds that of the intent detection task. In general,
the performance is improved by the CRF layer.

4 Conclusion

In this paper, we propose a novel SF-ID network
which provides a bi-directional interrelated mech-
anism for intent detection and slot filling tasks.
And an iteration mechanism is proposed to en-
hance the interrelated connections between the
intent and slots. The bi-directional interrelated
model helps the two tasks promote each other mu-
tually. Our model outperforms the baselines on
two public datasets greatly. This bi-directional
interrelated mechanism between slots and intent
provides guidance for the future SLU work.
