Abstract

We present a novel technique for learn-
ing semantic representations, which ex-
tends the distributional hypothesis to mul-
tilingual data and joint-space embeddings.
Our models leverage parallel data and
learn to strongly align the embeddings of
semantically equivalent sentences, while
maintaining sufficient distance between
those of dissimilar sentences. The mod-
els do not rely on word alignments or
any syntactic information and are success-
fully applied to a number of diverse lan-
guages. We extend our approach to learn
semantic representations at the document
level, too. We evaluate these models on
two cross-lingual document classification
tasks, outperforming the prior state of the
art. Through qualitative analysis and the
study of pivoting effects we demonstrate
that our representations are semantically
plausible and can capture semantic rela-
tionships across languages without paral-
lel data.

1 Introduction

Distributed representations of words provide the
basis for many state-of-the-art approaches to var-
ious problems in natural language processing to-
day. Such word embeddings are naturally richer
representations than those of symbolic or discrete
models, and have been shown to be able to capture
both syntactic and semantic information. Success-
ful applications of such models include language
modelling (Bengio et al., 2003), paraphrase detec-
tion (Erk and Padó, 2008), and dialogue analysis
(Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013).

Within a monolingual context, the distributional
hypothesis (Firth, 1957) forms the basis of most
approaches for learning word representations. In

Figure 1: Model with parallel input sentences a and b. The
model minimises the distance between the sentence level en-
coding of the bitext. Any composition functions (CVM) can
be used to generate the compositional sentence level repre-
sentations.

this work, we extend this hypothesis to multilin-
gual data and joint-space embeddings. We present
a novel unsupervised technique for learning se-
mantic representations that leverages parallel cor-
pora and employs semantic transfer through com-
positional representations. Unlike most methods
for learning word representations, which are re-
stricted to a single language, our approach learns
to represent meaning across languages in a shared
multilingual semantic space.

We present experiments on two corpora. First,
we show that for cross-lingual document clas-
sification on the Reuters RCV1/RCV2 corpora
(Lewis et al., 2004), we outperform the prior state
of the art (Klementiev et al., 2012). Second,
we also present classification results on a mas-
sively multilingual corpus which we derive from
the TED corpus (Cettolo et al., 2012). The re-
sults on this task, in comparison with a number of
strong baselines, further demonstrate the relevance
of our approach and the success of our method
in learning multilingual semantic representations
over a wide range of languages.

2 Overview

Distributed representation learning describes the
task of learning continuous representations for dis-
crete objects. Here, we focus on learning seman-
tic representations and investigate how the use of
multilingual data can improve learning such rep-
resentations at the word and higher level. We
present a model that learns to represent each
word in a lexicon by a continuous vector in Rd.
Such distributed representations allow a model to
share meaning between similar words, and have
been used to capture semantic, syntactic and mor-
phological content (Collobert and Weston, 2008;
Turian et al., 2010, inter alia).

We describe a multilingual objective function
that uses a noise-contrastive update between se-
mantic representations of different languages to
learn these word embeddings. As part of this, we
use a compositional vector model (CVM, hence-
forth) to compute semantic representations of sen-
tences and documents. A CVM learns seman-
tic representations of larger syntactic units given
the semantic representations of their constituents
(Clark and Pulman, 2007; Mitchell and Lapata,
2008; Baroni and Zamparelli, 2010; Grefenstette
and Sadrzadeh, 2011; Socher et al., 2012; Her-
mann and Blunsom, 2013, inter alia).

A key difference between our approach and
those listed above is that we only require sentence-
aligned parallel data in our otherwise unsuper-
vised learning function. This removes a number of
constraints that normally come with CVM mod-
els, such as the need for syntactic parse trees, word
alignment or annotated data as a training signal.
At the same time, by using multiple CVMs to
transfer information between languages, we en-
able our models to capture a broader semantic con-
text than would otherwise be possible.

The idea of extracting semantics from multilin-
gual data stems from prior work in the field of
semantic grounding. Language acquisition in hu-
mans is widely seen as grounded in sensory-motor
experience (Bloom, 2001; Roy, 2003). Based
on this idea, there have been some attempts at
using multi-modal data for learning better vec-
tor representations of words (e.g. Srivastava and
Salakhutdinov (2012)). Such methods, however,
are not easily scalable across languages or to large
amounts of data for which no secondary or tertiary
representation might exist.

Parallel data in multiple languages provides an

alternative to such secondary representations, as
parallel texts share their semantics, and thus one
language can be used to ground the other. Some
work has exploited this idea for transferring lin-
guistic knowledge into low-resource languages or
to learn distributed representations at the word
level (Klementiev et al., 2012; Zou et al., 2013;
Lauly et al., 2013, inter alia). So far almost all
of this work has been focused on learning multi-
lingual representations at the word level. As dis-
tributed representations of larger expressions have
been shown to be highly useful for a number of
tasks, it seems to be a natural next step to attempt
to induce these, too, cross-lingually.

3 Approach

Most prior work on learning compositional se-
mantic representations employs parse trees on
their training data to structure their composition
functions (Socher et al., 2012; Hermann and Blun-
som, 2013, inter alia). Further, these approaches
typically depend on specific semantic signals such
as sentiment- or topic-labels for their objective
functions. While these methods have been shown
to work in some cases, the need for parse trees and
annotated data limits such approaches to resource-
fortunate languages. Our novel method for learn-
ing compositional vectors removes these require-
ments, and as such can more easily be applied to
low-resource languages.

Specifically, we attempt to learn semantics from
multilingual data. The idea is that, given enough
parallel data, a shared representation of two paral-
lel sentences would be forced to capture the com-
mon elements between these two sentences. What
parallel sentences share, of course, are their se-
mantics. Naturally, different languages express
meaning in different ways. We utilise this di-
versity to abstract further from mono-lingual sur-
face realisations to deeper semantic representa-
tions. We exploit this semantic similarity across
languages by defining a bilingual (and trivially
multilingual) energy as follows.

Assume two functions f : X → Rd and
g : Y → Rd, which map sentences from lan-
guages x and y onto distributed semantic
representations in Rd. Given a parallel corpus C,
we then define the energy of the model given two
sentences (a, b) ∈ C as:

Ebi(a, b) = ‖f(a)− g(b)‖2 (1)

59



We want to minimize Ebi for all semantically
equivalent sentences in the corpus. In order to
prevent the model from degenerating, we fur-
ther introduce a noise-constrastive large-margin
update which ensures that the representations of
non-aligned sentences observe a certain margin
from each other. For every pair of parallel sen-
tences (a, b) we sample a number of additional
sentence pairs (·, n) ∈ C, where n—with high
probability—is not semantically equivalent to a.
We use these noise samples as follows:

Ehl(a, b, n) = [m+ Ebi(a, b)− Ebi(a, n)]+
where [x]+ = max(x, 0) denotes the standard
hinge loss and m is the margin. This results in
the following objective function:

J(θ) =
∑

(a,b)∈C

(
k∑

i=1

Ehl(a, b, ni) +
λ

2
‖θ‖2

)
(2)

where θ is the set of all model variables.

3.1 Two Composition Models
The objective function in Equation 2 could be cou-
pled with any two given vector composition func-
tions f, g from the literature. As we aim to apply
our approach to a wide range of languages, we fo-
cus on composition functions that do not require
any syntactic information. We evaluate the follow-
ing two composition functions.

The first model, ADD, represents a sentence by
the sum of its word vectors. This is a distributed
bag-of-words approach as sentence ordering is not
taken into account by the model.

Second, the BI model is designed to capture bi-
gram information, using a non-linearity over bi-
gram pairs in its composition function:

f(x) =
n∑

i=1

tanh (xi−1 + xi) (3)

The use of a non-linearity enables the model to
learn interesting interactions between words in a
document, which the bag-of-words approach of
ADD is not capable of learning. We use the hy-
perbolic tangent as activation function.

3.2 Document-level Semantics
For a number of tasks, such as topic modelling,
representations of objects beyond the sentence
level are required. While most approaches to com-
positional distributed semantics end at the word

Figure 2: Description of a parallel document-level composi-
tional vector model (DOC). The model recursively computes
semantic representations for each sentence of a document and
then for the document itself, treating the sentence vectors as
inputs for a second CVM.

level, our model extends to document-level learn-
ing quite naturally, by recursively applying the
composition and objective function (Equation 2)
to compose sentences into documents. This is
achieved by first computing semantic representa-
tions for each sentence in a document. Next, these
representations are used as inputs in a higher-level
CVM, computing a semantic representation of a
document (Figure 2).

This recursive approach integrates document-
level representations into the learning process.
We can thus use corpora of parallel documents—
regardless of whether they are sentence aligned or
not—to propagate a semantic signal back to the
individual words. If sentence alignment is avail-
able, of course, the document-signal can simply
be combined with the sentence-signal, as we did
with the experiments described in §5.3.

This concept of learning compositional repre-
sentations for documents contrasts with prior work
(Socher et al., 2011; Klementiev et al., 2012, inter
alia) who rely on summing or averaging sentence-
vectors if representations beyond the sentence-
level are required for a particular task.

We evaluate the models presented in this paper
both with and without the document-level signal.
We refer to the individual models used as ADD and
BI if used without, and as DOC/ADD and DOC/BI
is used with the additional document composition
function and error signal.

4 Corpora

We use two corpora for learning semantic rep-
resentations and performing the experiments de-
scribed in this paper.

60



The Europarl corpus v71 (Koehn, 2005) was
used during initial development and testing of
our approach, as well as to learn the representa-
tions used for the Cross-Lingual Document Clas-
sification task described in §5.2. We considered
the English-German and English-French language
pairs from this corpus. From each pair the final
100,000 sentences were reserved for development.

Second, we developed a massively multilin-
gual corpus based on the TED corpus2 for IWSLT
2013 (Cettolo et al., 2012). This corpus contains
English transcriptions and multilingual, sentence-
aligned translations of talks from the TED confer-
ence. While the corpus is aimed at machine trans-
lation tasks, we use the keywords associated with
each talk to build a subsidiary corpus for multilin-
gual document classification as follows.3

The development sections provided with the
IWSLT 2013 corpus were again reserved for de-
velopment. We removed approximately 10 per-
cent of the training data in each language to cre-
ate a test corpus (all talks with id ≥ 1,400). The
new training corpus consists of a total of 12,078
parallel documents distributed across 12 language
pairs4. In total, this amounts to 1,678,219 non-
English sentences (the number of unique English
sentences is smaller as many documents are trans-
lated into multiple languages and thus appear re-
peatedly in the corpus). Each document (talk) con-
tains one or several keywords. We used the 15
most frequent keywords for the topic classification
experiments described in section §5.3.

Both corpora were pre-processed using the set
of tools provided by cdec5 for tokenizing and low-
ercasing the data. Further, all empty sentences and
their translations were removed from the corpus.

5 Experiments

We report results on two experiments. First, we
replicate the cross-lingual document classification
task of Klementiev et al. (2012), learning dis-
tributed representations on the Europarl corpus
and evaluating on documents from the Reuters
RCV1/RCV2 corpora. Subsequently, we design a

multi-label classification task using the TED cor-
pus, both for training and evaluating. The use of
a wider range of languages in the second experi-
ments allows us to better evaluate our models’ ca-
pabilities in learning a shared multilingual seman-
tic representation. We also investigate the learned
embeddings from a qualitative perspective in §5.4.
5.1 Learning
All model weights were randomly initialised us-
ing a Gaussian distribution (µ=0, σ2=0.1). We
used the available development data to set our
model parameters. For each positive sample we
used a number of noise samples (k ∈ {1, 10, 50}),
randomly drawn from the corpus at each training
epoch. All our embeddings have dimensionality
d=128, with the margin set to m=d.6 Further, we
use L2 regularization with λ=1 and step-size in
{0.01, 0.05}. We use 100 iterations for the RCV
task, 500 for the TED single and 5 for the joint
corpora. We use the adaptive gradient method,
AdaGrad (Duchi et al., 2011), for updating the
weights of our models, in a mini-batch setting (b ∈
{10, 50}). All settings, our model implementation
and scripts to replicate our experiments are avail-
able at http://www.karlmoritz.com/.

5.2 RCV1/RCV2 Document Classification
We evaluate our models on the cross-lingual doc-
ument classification (CLDC, henceforth) task first
described in Klementiev et al. (2012). This task in-
volves learning language independent embeddings
which are then used for document classification
across the English-German language pair. For this,
CLDC employs a particular kind of supervision,
namely using supervised training data in one lan-
guage and evaluating without further supervision
in another. Thus, CLDC can be used to establish
whether our learned representations are semanti-
cally useful across multiple languages.

We follow the experimental setup described in
Klementiev et al. (2012), with the exception that
we learn our embeddings using solely the Europarl
data and use the Reuters corpora only during for
classifier training and testing. Each document in
the classification task is represented by the aver-
age of the d-dimensional representations of all its
sentences. We train the multiclass classifier using
an averaged perceptron (Collins, 2002) with the
same settings as in Klementiev et al. (2012).

6On the RCV task we also report results for d=40 which
matches the dimensionality of Klementiev et al. (2012).

2012) translated (MT) and glossed (Glossed) word baselines,
and the majority class baseline. The baseline results are from
Klementiev et al. (2012).

We present results from four models. The ADD
model is trained on 500k sentence pairs of the
English-German parallel section of the Europarl
corpus. The ADD+ model uses an additional 500k
parallel sentences from the English-French cor-
pus, resulting in one million English sentences,
each paired up with either a German or a French
sentence, with BI and BI+ trained accordingly.
The motivation behind ADD+ and BI+ is to inves-
tigate whether we can learn better embeddings by
introducing additional data from other languages.
A similar idea exists in machine translation where
English is frequently used to pivot between other
languages (Cohn and Lapata, 2007).

The actual CLDC experiments are performed
by training on English and testing on German doc-
uments and vice versa. Following prior work, we
use varying sizes between 100 and 10,000 docu-
ments when training the multiclass classifier. The
results of this task across training sizes are in Fig-
ure 3. Table 1 shows the results for training on
1,000 documents compared with the results pub-
lished in Klementiev et al. (2012). Our models
outperform the prior state of the art, with the BI
models performing slightly better than the ADD
models. As the relative results indicate, the addi-
tion of a second language improves model perfor-

mance. It it interesting to note that results improve
in both directions of the task, even though no addi-
tional German data was used for the ‘+‘ models.

5.3 TED Corpus Experiments

Here we describe our experiments on the TED cor-
pus, which enables us to scale up to multilingual
learning. Consisting of a large number of rela-
tively short and parallel documents, this corpus al-
lows us to evaluate the performance of the DOC
model described in §3.2.

We use the training data of the corpus to learn
distributed representations across 12 languages.
Training is performed in two settings. In the sin-
gle mode, vectors are learnt from a single lan-
guage pair (en-X), while in the joint mode vector-
learning is performed on all parallel sub-corpora
simultaneously. This setting causes words from
all languages to be embedded in a single semantic
space.

First, we evaluate the effect of the document-
level error signal (DOC, described in §3.2), as well
as whether our multilingual learning method can
extend to a larger variety of languages. We train
DOC models, using both ADD and BI as CVM
(DOC/ADD, DOC/BI), both in the single and joint
mode. For comparison, we also train ADD and
DOC models without the document-level error sig-
nal. The resulting document-level representations
are used to train classifiers (system and settings as
in §5.2) for each language, which are then evalu-
ated in the paired language. In the English case
we train twelve individual classifiers, each using
the training data of a single language pair only.
As described in §4, we use 15 keywords for the
classification task. Due to space limitations, we
report cumulative results in the form of F1-scores
throughout this paper.

MT System We develop a machine translation
baseline as follows. We train a machine translation
tool on the parallel training data, using the devel-
opment data of each language pair to optimize the
translation system. We use the cdec decoder (Dyer
et al., 2010) with default settings for this purpose.
With this system we translate the test data, and
then use a Naı̈ve Bayes classifier7 for the actual
experiments. To exemplify, this means the de→ar
result is produced by training a translation system
from Arabic to German. The Arabic test set is
translated into German. A classifier is then trained

7We use the implementation in Mallet (McCallum, 2002)

on the German training data and evaluated on the
translated Arabic. While we developed this system
as a baseline, it must be noted that the classifier of
this system has access to significantly more infor-
mation (all words in the document) as opposed to
our models (one embedding per document), and
we do not expect to necessarily beat this system.

The results of this experiment are in Table 2.
When comparing the results between the ADD
model and the models trained using the document-
level error signal, the benefit of this additional sig-
nal becomes clear. The joint training mode leads
to a relative improvement when training on En-
glish data and evaluating in a second language.
This suggests that the joint mode improves the
quality of the English embeddings more than it
affects the L2-embeddings. More surprising, per-
haps, is the relative performance between the ADD
and BI composition functions, especially when
compared to the results in §5.2, where the BI mod-
els relatively consistently performed better. We
suspect that the better performance of the additive
composition function on this task is related to the
smaller amount of training data available which
could cause sparsity issues for the bigram model.

As expected, the MT system slightly outper-
forms our models on most language pairs. How-
ever, the overall performance of the models is
comparable to that of the MT system. Consider-
ing the relative amount of information available
during the classifier training phase, this indicates
that our learned representations are semantically
useful, capturing almost the same amount of infor-
mation as available to the Naı̈ve Bayes classifier.

We next investigate linguistic transfer across

languages. We re-use the embeddings learned
with the DOC/ADD joint model from the previ-
ous experiment for this purpose, and train clas-
sifiers on all non-English languages using those
embeddings. Subsequently, we evaluate their per-
formance in classifying documents in the remain-
ing languages. Results for this task are in Table 3.
While the results across language-pairs might not
be very insightful, the overall good performance
compared with the results in Table 2 implies that
we learnt semantically meaningful vectors and in
fact a joint embedding space across thirteen lan-
guages.

In a third evaluation (Table 4), we apply the em-
beddings learnt with out models to a monolingual
classification task, enabling us to compare with
prior work on distributed representation learning.
In this experiment a classifier is trained in one lan-
guage and then evaluated in the same. We again
use a Naı̈ve Bayes classifier on the raw data to es-
tablish a reasonable upper bound.

We compare our embeddings with the SENNA
embeddings, which achieve state of the art per-
formance on a number of tasks (Collobert et al.,
2011). Additionally, we use the Polyglot embed-
dings of Al-Rfou’ et al. (2013), who published
word embeddings across 100 languages, including
all languages considered in this paper. We repre-
sent each document by the mean of its word vec-
tors and then apply the same classifier training and
testing regime as with our models. Even though
both of these sets of embeddings were trained on
much larger datasets than ours, our models outper-
form these baselines on all languages—even out-
performing the Naı̈ve Bayes system on on several

though the model did not use any parallel French-German
data during training, it learns semantic similarity between
these two languages using English as a pivot, and semanti-
cally clusters words across all languages.

languages. While this may partly be attributed to
the fact that our vectors were learned on in-domain
data, this is still a very positive outcome.

5.4 Linguistic Analysis

While the classification experiments focused on
establishing the semantic content of the sentence
level representations, we also want to briefly in-
vestigate the induced word embeddings. We use
the BI+ model trained on the Europarl corpus for
this purpose. Figure 4 shows the t-SNE projec-
tions for a number of English, French and German
words. Even though the model did not use any par-
allel French-German data during training, it still
managed to learn semantic word-word similarity
across these two languages.

Going one step further, Figure 5 shows t-SNE
projections for a number of short phrases in these
three languages. We use the English the presi-

dent and gender-specific expressions Mr President
and Madam President as well as gender-specific
equivalents in French and German. The projec-
tion demonstrates a number of interesting results:
First, the model correctly clusters the words into
three groups, corresponding to the three English
forms and their associated translations. Second, a
separation between genders can be observed, with
male forms on the bottom half of the chart and fe-
male forms on the top, with the neutral the presi-
dent in the vertical middle. Finally, if we assume
a horizontal line going through the president, this
line could be interpreted as a “gender divide”, with
male and female versions of one expression mir-
roring each other on that line. In the case of the
president and its translations, this effect becomes
even clearer, with the neutral English expression
being projected close to the mid-point between
each other language’s gender-specific versions.

These results further support our hypothesis that
the bilingual contrastive error function can learn
semantically plausible embeddings and further-
more, that it can abstract away from mono-lingual
surface realisations into a shared semantic space
across languages.

6 Related Work

Distributed Representations Distributed repre-
sentations can be learned through a number of ap-
proaches. In their simplest form, distributional in-
formation from large corpora can be used to learn
embeddings, where the words appearing within a
certain window of the target word are used to com-
pute that word’s embedding. This is related to
topic-modelling techniques such as LSA (Dumais
et al., 1988), LSI, and LDA (Blei et al., 2003), but
these methods use a document-level context, and
tend to capture the topics a word is used in rather
than its more immediate syntactic context.

Neural language models are another popular ap-
proach for inducing distributed word representa-
tions (Bengio et al., 2003). They have received a
lot of attention in recent years (Collobert and We-
ston, 2008; Mnih and Hinton, 2009; Mikolov et
al., 2010, inter alia) and have achieved state of the
art performance in language modelling. Collobert
et al. (2011) further popularised using neural net-
work architectures for learning word embeddings
from large amounts of largely unlabelled data by
showing the embeddings can then be used to im-
prove standard supervised tasks.

Unsupervised word representations can easily
be plugged into a variety of NLP related tasks.
Tasks, where the use of distributed representations
has resulted in improvements include topic mod-
elling (Blei et al., 2003) or named entity recogni-
tion (Turian et al., 2010; Collobert et al., 2011).

Compositional Vector Models For a number of
important problems, semantic representations of
individual words do not suffice, but instead a se-
mantic representation of a larger structure—e.g. a
phrase or a sentence—is required. Self-evidently,
sparsity prevents the learning of such representa-
tions using the same collocational methods as ap-
plied to the word level. Most literature instead fo-
cuses on learning composition functions that rep-
resent the semantics of a larger structure as a func-
tion of the representations of its parts.

Very simple composition functions have been
shown to suffice for tasks such as judging bi-
gram semantic similarity (Mitchell and Lapata,
2008). More complex composition functions us-
ing matrix-vector composition, convolutional neu-
ral networks or tensor composition have proved
useful in tasks such as sentiment analysis (Socher
et al., 2011; Hermann and Blunsom, 2013), rela-
tional similarity (Turney, 2012) or dialogue analy-
sis (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013).

Multilingual Representation Learning Most
research on distributed representation induction
has focused on single languages. English, with its
large number of annotated resources, has enjoyed
most attention. However, there exists a corpus of
prior work on learning multilingual embeddings
or on using parallel data to transfer linguistic in-
formation across languages. One has to differen-
tiate between approaches such as Al-Rfou’ et al.
(2013), that learn embeddings across a large va-
riety of languages and models such as ours, that
learn joint embeddings, that is a projection into a
shared semantic space across multiple languages.

Related to our work, Yih et al. (2011) proposed
S2Nets to learn joint embeddings of tf-idf vectors
for comparable documents. Their architecture op-
timises the cosine similarity of documents, using
relative semantic similarity scores during learn-
ing. More recently, Lauly et al. (2013) proposed a
bag-of-words autoencoder model, where the bag-
of-words representation in one language is used to
train the embeddings in another. By placing their
vocabulary in a binary branching tree, the prob-
abilistic setup of this model is similar to that of

Mnih and Hinton (2009). Similarly, Sarath Chan-
dar et al. (2013) train a cross-lingual encoder,
where an autoencoder is used to recreate words in
two languages in parallel. This is effectively the
linguistic extension of Ngiam et al. (2011), who
used a similar method for audio and video data.
Hermann and Blunsom (2014) propose a large-
margin learner for multilingual word representa-
tions, similar to the basic additive model proposed
here, which, like the approaches above, relies on a
bag-of-words model for sentence representations.

Klementiev et al. (2012), our baseline in §5.2,
use a form of multi-agent learning on word-
aligned parallel data to transfer embeddings from
one language to another. Earlier work, Haghighi
et al. (2008), proposed a method for inducing
bilingual lexica using monolingual feature repre-
sentations and a small initial lexicon to bootstrap
with. This approach has recently been extended
by Mikolov et al. (2013a), Mikolov et al. (2013b),
who developed a method for learning transforma-
tion matrices to convert semantic vectors of one
language into those of another. Is was demon-
strated that this approach can be applied to im-
prove tasks related to machine translation. Their
CBOW model is also worth noting for its sim-
ilarities to the ADD composition function used
here. Using a slightly different approach, Zou et
al. (2013), also learned bilingual embeddings for
machine translation.

7 Conclusion

To summarize, we have presented a novel method
for learning multilingual word embeddings using
parallel data in conjunction with a multilingual ob-
jective function for compositional vector models.
This approach extends the distributional hypoth-
esis to multilingual joint-space representations.
Coupled with very simple composition functions,
vectors learned with this method outperform the
state of the art on the task of cross-lingual docu-
ment classification. Further experiments and anal-
ysis support our hypothesis that bilingual signals
are a useful tool for learning distributed represen-
tations by enabling models to abstract away from
mono-lingual surface realisations into a deeper se-
mantic space.
