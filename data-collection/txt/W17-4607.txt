Abstract

Vast amounts of speech data collected for
language documentation and research re-
main untranscribed and unsearchable, but
often a small amount of speech may have
text translations available. We present a
method for partially labeling additional
speech with translations in this scenario.
We modify an unsupervised speech-to-
translation alignment model and obtain
prototype speech segments that match the
translation words, which are in turn used
to discover terms in the unlabelled data.
We evaluate our method on a Spanish-
English speech translation corpus and on
two corpora of endangered languages,
Arapaho and Ainu, demonstrating its ap-
propriateness and applicability in an actual
very-low-resource scenario.

1 Introduction

Language documentation efforts over the last 50–
60 years have resulted in audio recordings of na-
tive speakers in a large number of languages, many
of which are available online. However, due to the
enormous effort required for transcription, much
of the data remains unannotated and unsearch-
able.1 For example, out of the 137 unrestricted
collections in the Archive of the Indigenous Lan-
guages of Latin America, about half (49%) contain
no transcriptions at all, and only 7% are fully tran-
scribed.2 As a result, some recent documentation
efforts have begun to focus instead on annotating
with translations, often with the help of bilingual

native speakers themselves (Bird et al., 2014; Bla-
chon et al., 2016; Adda et al., 2016).

Nevertheless, even translation takes time and
language knowledge, so there may still be little
translated data relative to the amount of recorded
audio. An important goal, then, is to bootstrap lan-
guage technology from this small parallel corpus
in order to provide tools to annotate more data or
make the data more searchable.

We build on the approach of Anastasopoulos
et al. (2016), who developed a system that per-
forms joint inference to identify recurring seg-
ments of audio and cluster them while aligning
them to words in a text translation. Here, we ex-
tend the method to be able to search for new in-
stances of the latent clusters within the unlabeled
audio, effectively providing keyword translations
for some of the unlabeled speech. We evaluate our
method on a Spanish-English corpus used in pre-
vious work, and on two datasets from endangered
languages (narratives in Arapaho and Ainu). No
previous computational methods have been tested
on the latter data, to our knowledge. We show that
in all cases, our system outperforms a recent base-
line targeted at the same very low-resource setting
(Bansal et al., 2017b), also showing robustness to
audio quality and preprocessing decisions.

2 Related work

Our work joins a handful of other recent proposals
aimed at low-resource speech-to-text alignment
and translation. These include those of Duong
et al. (2016) and Anastasopoulos et al. (2016), who
performed alignment only; Bérard et al. (2016),
who used synthetic rather than real speech; and
Adams et al. (2016) and Godard et al. (2016), who
worked from phone lattices and phone sequences,
respectively; Stahlberg et al. (2013), who per-
form phone-to-translation alignment for pronunci-

ation extraction. Weiss et al. (2017) presented a
sequence-to-sequence neural model that learned a
direct mapping from speech to translated text with
impressive results, but was trained on roughly 140
hours of parallel data—far more than is available
for most endangered languages.

The only previous system we know of to ad-
dress the same very-low-resource scenario and
provide translation terms for unlabeled audio
is that of Bansal et al. (2017b) (henceforth
UTD-align), who used an unsupervised term dis-
covery system (Jansen et al., 2010) to cluster re-
curring audio segments into pseudowords. The
pseudowords occurring in the parallel section of
the corpus were then aligned to the translation
text using IBM Model 1, and used to translate in-
stances occurring in the test (audio-only) section.

3 Method

The main difference between our method and
UTD-align is that UTD-align clusters the audio
prior to aligning with the translations, whereas we
start by performing joint alignment and clustering
using an improved version of the method proposed
by Anastasopoulos et al. (2016) (henceforth s2t).
The resulting aligned clusters are represented by
one or more prototype speech segments. We ex-
tend s2t to identify new instances of those pro-
totypes in the unlabeled speech, using a modified
version of ZRTools, the same UTD toolkit used
by UTD-align.3 (Jansen et al., 2010)

Previous work has indicated that using trans-
lation text to inform acoustic clustering pro-
vides more accurate clusters than just using UTD
(Bansal et al., 2017a), so we initially expected
that this straightforward extension of s2t would
work better than UTD-align. However, early ex-
periments indicated that the text had too much in-
fluence on clustering, yielding clusters with highly
diverse audio, and thus poor prototypes. Thus,
we modified s2t4 in order to account for this is-
sue, obtaining prototypes of higher quality (§3.1),
which we search for in the unlabeled audio (§3.2).
3.1 Aligning speech to translation
The s2t model is an extension of IBM Model
2 for word alignment (Brown et al., 1993),
combined with K-means clustering using Dy-
namic Time Warping (DTW) (Berndt and Clifford,

3https://github.com/arenjansen/ZRTools
4The code is available at

https://bitbucket.org/ndnlp/translationTermDiscovery

1994) as a distance measure. It uses expectation-
maximization (EM) to align speech segments to
words in the parallel text, while jointly clustering
the segments. Each translation word is aligned to
an acoustic segment, with overlapping alignments
and unaligned speech spans being allowed.

In the original implementation, every transla-
tion word was represented by a fixed number (2)
of acoustic sub-clusters, with a single prototype
representing each.5 The prototypes are averages of
the segments in the cluster, computed using DTW
Barycenter Averaging (Petitjean et al., 2011). At
the E-step, each segment was assigned to its clos-
est sub-cluster, and at the M-step the sub-cluster’s
prototype was re-computed. However, the orig-
inal choice of two subclusters was fairly arbi-
trary, and we found it doesn’t sufficiently account
for the wide acoustic variability due to gender or
speaker. We thus modify s2t so that, before the
M-step, each cluster’s segments are grouped into
sub-clusters using connected components cluster-
ing with a similarity threshold δ, following Park
and Glass (2008). That way, the number of sub-
clusters and prototypes for each translation word
is determined automatically based on the acoustic
similarity of the segments.

Our preliminary analysis showed that shorter
alignments tend to introduce significantly more
noise than longer ones. Therefore, in the final M-
step of s2t, we discard all segments shorter than
a length threshold t before computing the proto-
types. We use the default values for the rest of the
s2t parameters.

Another pragmatic choice we made based on
the performance of our method was to remove the
stopwords from the translations, following Bansal
et al. (2017b). The rationale is that translation
stopwords would not be particularly useful for la-
belling speech in our envisioned use cases.

3.2 Keyword Search

In the second stage, we use the approximate DTW-
based pattern matching method of ZRTools to
search for the obtained prototypes in the test data.
We require that each discovered term matches at
least k% of a prototype’s length and that its DTW
similarity score is higher than a threshold s. By
varying s we can control the number of discov-
ered terms, trading off precision and recall. Also,
we do not allow overlapping matches; in the case

54



of an overlap, we output the match with the higher
score.

4 Experiments

The CALLHOME Spanish Speech dataset
(LDC2014T23) with English translations (Post
et al., 2013) has been used in almost all ground-
laying previous work, treating Spanish as a
low-resource language. As a collection of tele-
phone conversations between relatives (about 20
total hours of audio), it doesn’t match our lan-
guage documentation scenario, but we use it in
order to compare our method with previous work.

We shuffle the utterances and split them into
training, dev, and test sets with 70%, 10%, and
20% of the data, respectively. We filter the ac-
tive audio regions using energy-based voice ac-
tivity detection (VAD). We obtain prototypes in
the training set and tune the values of the length
threshold t, the similarity threshold d, and the par-
tial overlap threshold k on the development set us-
ing grid search. The best parameter combination
is t = 300 ms, d = 90%, and k = 80%, while
s = 0.90 returns the highest F-score. We evaluate
our discovered translation terms on the test set us-
ing precision, recall, and F-score at the token level
over the correct bag-of-words translations.

We also evaluate our method on two low-
resource endangered languages, Arapaho and
Ainu. For these experiments, we only have a train-
ing and test set, so we use the same preprocessing
and hyperparameter settings as in CALLHOME.

Arapaho is an Algonquian language with about
1,000 native speakers, mostly in Wyoming. We
use 8 narratives published at The Arapaho Lan-
guage Project,6 which provides the narratives’ au-
dio along with English translations, among other
language learning resources.

Hokkaido Ainu is the sole surviving member of
the Ainu language family and is generally consid-
ered a language isolate. As of 2007, only ten native
speakers were alive. The Glossed Audio Corpus
of Ainu Folklore provides 10 narratives with au-
dio and translations in English.7 More information
and statistics on the Arapaho and Ainu corpora is
provided in Tables 4 and 5.

Table 1: Results of our method and baseline work
on the CALLHOME dataset. Our method im-
proves over UTD-align whether inferring align-
ments or using oracle (silver) alignments.

4.1 Results on CALLHOME

We first evaluate the effect of our modifications
to the s2t method, by calculating alignment F-
score on links between speech frames and transla-
tion words.8 The intermediate sub-clustering step
between the E- and M-steps results in a more in-
formed selection of the number of sub-clusters that
increases the alignment F-score by 1.5%. Also,
removing translation stopwords further leads to
higher alignment precision by +4%. Alignment re-
call is lower since it’s computed over the align-
ments of both content and stopwords. Although
both improvements are small, the higher align-
ment precision leads to better prototypes.

In addition, Duong et al. (2016) created “silver”
standard speech-to-translation alignments by com-
bining the forced speech-to-transcription align-
ments and the transcription-to-translation word
alignments. These are useful for evaluating how
well the prototype creation and matching could
work, given oracle speech-to-translation align-
ments. In Table 1, we report precision, recall, and
F-score on the discovered translation terms (at the
token level) using prototypes from both “silver”
and noisy alignments. We also report the percent-
age of active audio that is labelled (coverage).
In both cases we outperform UTD-align.9 Even
though there is room for improvement, using the
translation information at the alignment stage cer-
tainly improves the clustering, as anticipated. An-
other advantage of our method over UTD-align
is its significantly improved coverage of the active
audio, as shown in the last column of Table 1. The
precision-recall curve obtained by varying the out-
put similarity threshold s is shown in Figure 1.

4.2 Results on Arapaho and Ainu

Out of the eight Arapaho narratives, we select the
longest (18 minutes of audio, 233 English word
types) for training, using the other seven (32 min-
utes total) for evaluation. The Ainu collection pro-
vides ten narratives, so we use the first two for
training (24 minutes of audio, 494 English word
types) and the rest (133 minutes total) as test data.

Treating each narrative as a bag of words, the
precision and recall results at the token level are
shown in Tables 2 and 3. The last columns of these
Tables correspond to the highest possible recall
that we could get if we discovered all the train-
ing terms that also appear in the test set. Precision-
recall curves can be seen in Figure 1.

On both corpora, UTD-align identifies hardly
any translation terms, with recall scores below
1% and average F-scores of 0.8% and 0.2% for
Arapaho and Ainu, respectively. Preprocessing
with the same VAD script as for our method,
UTD-align produced too many spurious matches

(millions); we then used a more aggressive filter-
ing which removed more parts of the audio, but it
resulted in too few discovered matches (as shown
here). In principle, it should be possible to tailor
the preprocessing parameters for each corpus and
improve results for UTD-align.

Our method, instead, outputs several terms per
narrative without the need to readjust preprocess-
ing decisions, with F-scores of 8.4% (Arapaho)
and 7.2% (Ainu). Two exceptions are Arapaho
narratives #6 and #8, which, unlike our training
data, are narrated by a woman. Although there is
clearly room for improvement in terms of recall, as
shown by the last columns of Tables 2 and 3, we
are generally able to identify meaningful terms.

For most of the Arapaho stories we discover
named entities such as Ghost and Strong Bear,
content nouns like tipis and mountains, or verbs
such as hunting. In Ainu we discover more terms,
but the narratives are also longer. A larger domain
shift between training and test (small overlap on
named entities and other content words) leads to
lower recall compared to Arapaho. Our method
correctly identifies mostly common terms in the
Ainu narratives, like village, food, as well as verbs
used in narration such as said, went, or came.

5 Conclusion

We propose a method that modifies and ex-
tends a speech-to-translation alignment method
and can be used for identifying translation terms
in unlabeled audio, appropriate for extremely
small datasets. On CALLHOME, we show small

56



improvements over a recent baseline. We also
demonstrate the applicability of our method on
language documentation scenarios, by applying it
on two endangered language datasets. Speaker dif-
ferences are still an issue, but our method is more
robust to differences in acoustic quality than the
previous method.
