Abstract

Despite considerable theoretical work in
social sciences, ready to use resources are
very limited compared to digitally avail-
able mass media resources. Thus, this
project creates a political protest database
from online news resources in Brazil that
will be used to explain Brazilian welfare
state policy changes. In this paper we
present the preliminary results of a system
that automatically crawls digital resources
and produces a protest database, which in-
cludes events such as strikes, rallies, boy-
cotts, protests, and riots, as well as their at-
tributes such as location, participants, and
ideology.

1 Introduction

Social assistance programs in Brazil have largely
expanded during the last two decades. The work
presented in this paper is part of a project, which
hypothesizes that this social assistance expansion
in Brazil is a political response of the Brazilian
state to the changes in social movements, par-
ticularly to the growing political radicalism of
the poor and ethnic/racial minorities. Demon-
strating a causal chain between social movements
and social welfare outcomes in a systematic way
has often been a difficult task. This is partly
because of the lack of quantitative data on so-
cial movements beyond labour strike statistics and
the field is marked by more or less informed
speculation (Hutter, 2014). Using computational
linguistics based methods and online newspaper
archives, this study will create a holistic protest
event database for Brazil for the period since the

mid-1980s, when new social assistance programs
began to emerge. This database will be used in
pooled cross-sectional time-series regression anal-
ysis to explain welfare policy changes.

The protest database will count the number of
events such as strikes, rallies, boycotts, protests,
riots, and demonstrations, i.e. the “repertoire of
contention” (Tarrow, 1994; Tilly, 1984). It will
also indicate the location, city, neighbourhood of
the event, ethnicity, religion, political identity of
participants and organizers, the number of partici-
pants, death and casualty if occurred. We will col-
lect data on all protest events and operationalize
protest events of the poor by including (i) sponta-
neous or organized protests that take place in poor
urban and rural areas, (ii) protests led by organiza-
tions (political, ethnic, religious or criminal) that
work among the poor, independently of the loca-
tion of the protest event.

The research does not intend to produce an ex-
haustive count for all, or for even most incidences
of political events, since newspapers report on a
fraction of the events that occurred (Davenport,
2009; Earl et al., 2004; Ortiz et al., 2005). The
assumption is that during times of strong social
movements, newspapers report social events more
than usual (Silver, 2003). Therefore, the database
will count each time that an event is reported in
order to differentiate events in terms of their im-
portance. It intends to create a measure of the
changing levels of grassroots politics events over
time and space during the welfare transformation.
It is interested in the waves of contentious political
activities with a comparison between the poor and
other social groups.

Newspaper archives are the most reliable source
from which to create protest databases, i.e. to

106



transform “words to numbers” as they provide ac-
cess, selectivity, reliability, continuity over time
and ease of coding (Hutter, 2014; Franzosi, 2004).
International news wires and newspapers are not
the best source in cross-national research because
of the low level of incidence reported on each
country, undermining the representativeness of
each case (Imig, 2001). Yoruk (2012) has already
created a protest database for Turkey that records
and classifies protest activities spanning the whole
period from 1970 on by leading a research team
that manually surveyed microfilm archives. This
database shows that grassroots politics in Turkey
has shifted from the formal working class to the
informal working class and from Turks to Kurds,
which explains the shift in Turkish welfare poli-
cies from social insurance to social assistance and
the disproportional targeting of the Kurdish poor
in social assistance provision.

The protest database, the initial phase of which
is introduced in this paper, will be the first compa-
rable protest event database on emerging markets,
created using local news sources and, ambitiously,
using computational methods of natural language
processing and machine learning.

The protest database includes events and event
properties (Table 1).

Table 1: Event Attributes

In this paper, we present the article classifica-
tion and entity tagging results of a system that tar-
gets producing a protest database automatically,
using newspaper articles/archives from previous
decades. We develop a classification module that
classifies newspaper articles as reporting or not re-
porting a protest event. The articles that are clas-
sified as reporting a protest event are further pro-
cessed and the entity mentions are extracted us-
ing our supervised maximum entropy tagger. The
classification and entity tagging methods are eval-
uated using a manually annotated data set. In
addition, the results of running the classification
method on 200k newspaper articles are reported.

2 Methodology

First, we compile a newswire data set that includes
daily news articles in textual form from a local
newspaper. Next, we develop a classification sys-
tem that filters out news articles that do not include
any protest events. Lastly, we build an entity ex-
traction system that identifies entity mentions such
as the location or participants of an event.

2.1 Newswire Data Set
In the manually produced Turkish protest
database (Yoruk, 2012), an average of three
protest events per day for 365 days during the last
30 years, yielded a 30 thousand entry database.

We collected publicly available news articles
that had been digitized and are available at the
newspaper archives from Brazilian daily Folha de
São Paulo1. The Folha Digital News Archives are
available beginning from early 1920s. However,
only after 1994 articles are available in text for-
mat, older archives are only available in pdf (of
image) format.

We collected 200 thousand news articles in Por-
tuguese, published between 2004 and 2015 at
Folha de São Paulo. The number of articles be-
tween the years 2007 and 2011 are shown in Ta-
ble 2. We only collected the articles from specific
categories such as daily and politics. Our Por-
tuguese Newswire data set is publicly available2.

2.2 Classification

Classification is an important step in our system.
Newspaper archives include several news articles,
and keyword based search yields thousands of ir-
relevant articles besides the few relevant ones.
Given the news articles, we trained a binary clas-
sifier to differentiate protest-related news articles
from others.

We converted the data into feature vectors us-
ing Weka ”StringToWordVector” function and se-
lected top 50 words for each class using tf and idf
transformations on word count3.

We compared different classifiers using our
manually annotated newswire data set, namely,
Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines
(LIBSVM) (Chang and Lin, 2011), John Platt’s se-
quential minimal optimization algorithm for train-
ing a support vector machine classifier (SMO)
(Platt, 1999), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), C4.5
decision tree (DT), Voted Perceptron (VP), Naive
Bayes (NB), and Naive Bayes with kernel estima-
tor (NB-K). The performance results of each clas-
sifier are available in Section 3.

2.3 Data Set Annotation

The system first classifies protest related news and
secondly extracts components of protest informa-
tion (participants, place, ethnicity etc.) via entity
tagging.

For news article classification, 1000 news ar-
ticles (500 reporting protest events, 500 not re-
porting protest events) are manually annotated and
used for training and evaluation.

For entity tagging, 500 news articles are man-
ually annotated following the ACE 2005 anno-
tation guideline (Consortium and others, 2005).
ACE is a comprehensive annotation standard that
aims to annotate entities, events, and relations
within a variety of documents in a consistent man-
ner (Aguilar et al., 2014). We used the BRAT an-
notation tool (Stenetorp et al., 2012) for annotat-
ing the corpus (See Figure 1). Brat4 is based on a
visualizer and was initially developed to visualize
BioNLP’11 Shared Task data.

2.4 Entity Tagging

For entity tagging we used a maximum entropy
model (Berger et al., 1996). We used the maxent5

(Maximum Entropy Modeling Toolkit) library to
built our entity tagger with BIO scheme and tex-
tual features.

3 Preliminary Results

The results of each article classifier computed us-
ing the Weka tool (Hall et al., 2009) are shown
in Table 3. These results are obtained using 10-
fold cross-validation over the 1000 manually an-
notated news articles described in Section 2.3. The
best performance with an F-measure of 95.4% is
achieved by the Random Forest model.

Table 3: Comparison of different classifiers on the
news article classification data set

We ran the Random Forest classifier over the
200 thousand news articles that we compiled from
Brazilian daily Folha de São Paulo. The classifier
identified 20 thousand articles as reporting protest
events. Figure 2 shows the first tentative results of
our analysis, indicating the changes in the number
of total monthly protest events in Brazil between
2004 and 2011.

We used 10-fold cross-validation over the 500
news articles manually annotated for events to
evaluate our entity tagger. The accuracy obtained
is 76.25%.

4 Discussion and Future Work

The focus in this paper is Brazil and Brazillian
Portuguese newswire text. However, our ultimate
goal is to build our system in a way that will pro-
duce protest databases for other emerging coun-
tries using local newspaper archives.

The future work will be a further modifica-
tion, where we will form a language independent

tool. Then, we will use the language indepen-
dent tool on news sources in English and Spanish
languages, for which state-of-the-art in language
processing and language resources is much more
developed than for Portuguese. A tool for Turk-
ish will also be produced by utilizing the manu-
ally created protest database in (Yoruk, 2012) for
training and evaluation.

A comparative analysis of protest behaviour us-
ing quantified indicators from newspaper archives
from each country will be a novelty in the litera-
ture. The collected data will be analyzed both as
time-series indicator and independent variable in a
pooled cross-sectional time-series multivariate re-
gression analysis to establish causal relations be-
tween protest waves and welfare policy changes.
