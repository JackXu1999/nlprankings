Abstract

Words undergo various changes when en-
tering new languages. Based on the as-
sumption that these linguistic changes fol-
low certain rules, we propose a method
for automatically detecting pairs of cog-
nates employing an orthographic align-
ment method which proved relevant for se-
quence alignment in computational biol-
ogy. We use aligned subsequences as fea-
tures for machine learning algorithms in
order to infer rules for linguistic changes
undergone by words when entering new
languages and to discriminate between
cognates and non-cognates. Given a list
of known cognates, our approach does not
require any other linguistic information.
However, it can be customized to integrate
historical information regarding language
evolution.

1 Introduction

Cognates are words in different languages having
the same etymology and a common ancestor. In-
vestigating pairs of cognates is very useful in his-
torical and comparative linguistics, in the study
of language relatedness (Ng et al., 2010), phy-
logenetic inference (Atkinson et al., 2005) and
in identifying how and to what extent languages
change over time. In other several research ar-
eas, such as language acquisition, bilingual word
recognition (Dijkstra et al., 2012), corpus lin-
guistics (Simard et al., 1992), cross-lingual infor-
mation retrieval (Buckley et al., 1997) and ma-
chine translation (Kondrak et al., 2003), the con-
dition of common etymology is usually not essen-
tial and cognates are regarded as words with high
cross-lingual meaning and orthographic or pho-
netic similarity.

The wide range of applications in which cog-
nates prove useful attracted more and more at-

tention on methods for detecting such related
pairs of words. This task is most challenging
for resource-poor languages, for which etymologi-
cally related information is not accessible. There-
fore, the research (Inkpen et al., 2005; Mulloni and
Pekar, 2006; Hauer and Kondrak, 2011) focused
on automatic identification of cognate pairs, start-
ing from lists of known cognates.

In this paper, we propose a method for automat-
ically determining pairs of cognates across lan-
guages. The proposed method requires a list of
known cognates and, for languages for which ad-
ditional linguistic information is available, it can
be customized to integrate historical information
regarding the evolution of the language. The rest
of the paper is organized as follows: in Section
2 we present and analyze alternative methods and
related work in this area. In Section 3 we intro-
duce our approach for detection of cognates us-
ing orthographic alignment. In Section 4 we de-
scribe the experiments we conduct and we report
and analyze the results, together with a compari-
son with previous methods. Finally, in Section 5
we draw the conclusions of our study and describe
our plans for extending the method.

2 Related Work

There are three important aspects widely investi-
gated in the task of cognate identification: seman-
tic, phonetic and orthographic similarity. They
were employed both individually (Simard et al.,
1992; Inkpen et al., 2005; Church, 1993) and com-
bined (Kondrak, 2004; Steiner et al., 2011) in or-
der to detect pairs of cognates across languages.
For determining semantic similarity, external lexi-
cal resources, such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998),
or large corpora, might be necessary. For measur-
ing phonetic and orthographic proximity of cog-
nate candidates, string similarity metrics can be
applied, using the phonetic or orthographic word
forms as input. Various measures were investi-

99



gated and compared (Inkpen et al., 2005; Hall and
Klein, 2010); Levenshtein distance (Levenshtein,
1965), XDice (Brew and McKelvie, 1996) and
the longest common subsequence ratio (Melamed,
1995) are among the most frequently used metrics
in this field. Gomes and Lopes (2011) proposed
SpSim, a more complex method for computing the
similarity of cognate pairs which tolerates learned
transitions between words.

Algorithms for string alignment were success-
fully used for identifying cognates based on both
their forms, orthographic and phonetic. Delmestri
and Cristianini (2010) used basic sequence align-
ment algorithms (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970;
Smith and Waterman, 1981; Gotoh, 1982) to ob-
tain orthographic alignment scores for cognate
candidates. Kondrak (2000) developed the ALINE
system, which aligns words’ phonetic transcrip-
tions based on multiple phonetic features and com-
putes similarity scores using dynamic program-
ming. List (2012) proposed a framework for au-
tomatic detection of cognate pairs, LexStat, which
combines different approaches to sequence com-
parison and alignment derived from those used in
historical linguistics and evolutionary biology.

The changes undergone by words when enter-
ing from one language into another and the trans-
formation rules they follow have been successfully
employed in various approaches to cognate detec-
tion (Koehn and Knight, 2000; Mulloni and Pekar,
2006; Navlea and Todirascu, 2011). These ortho-
graphic changes have also been used in cognate
production, which is closely related to the task of
cognate detection, but has not yet been as inten-
sively studied. While the purpose of cognate de-
tection is to determine whether two given words
form a cognate pair, the aim of cognate produc-
tion is, given a word in a source language, to
automatically produce its cognate pair in a tar-
get language. Beinborn et al. (2013) proposed a
method for cognate production relying on statis-
tical character-based machine translation, learn-
ing orthographic production patterns, and Mul-
loni (2007) introduced an algorithm for cognate
production based on edit distance alignment and
the identification of orthographic cues when words
enter a new language.

3 Our Approach

Although there are multiple aspects that are rel-
evant in the study of language relatedness, such

as orthographic, phonetic, syntactic and semantic
differences, in this paper we focus only on lexical
evidence. The orthographic approach relies on the
idea that sound changes leave traces in the orthog-
raphy and alphabetic character correspondences
represent, to a fairly large extent, sound correspon-
dences (Delmestri and Cristianini, 2010).

Words undergo various changes when entering
new languages. We assume that rules for adapting
foreign words to the orthographic system of the
target languages might not have been very well
defined in their period of early development, but
they may have since become complex and proba-
bly language-specific. Detecting pairs of cognates
based on etymology is useful and reliable, but, for
resource-poor languages, methods which require
less linguistic knowledge might be necessary. Ac-
cording to Gusfield (1997), an edit transcript (rep-
resenting the conversion of one string to another)
and an alignment are mathematically equivalent
ways of describing relationships between strings.
Therefore, because the edit distance was widely
used in this research area and produced good re-
sults, we are encouraged to employ orthographic
alignment for identifying pairs of cognates, not
only to compute similarity scores, as was previ-
ously done, but to use aligned subsequences as
features for machine learning algorithms. Our in-
tuition is that inferring language-specific rules for
aligning words will lead to better performance in
the task of cognate identification.

3.1 Orthographic Alignment

String alignment is closely related to the task
of sequence alignment in computational biology.
Therefore, to align pairs of words we employ the
Needleman-Wunsch global alignment algorithm
(Needleman and Wunsch, 1970), which is mainly
used for aligning sequences of proteins or nu-
cleotides. Global sequence alignment aims at de-
termining the best alignment over the entire length
of the input sequences. The algorithm uses dy-
namic programming and, thus, guarantees to find
the optimal alignment. Its main idea is that any
partial path of the alignment along the optimal
path should be the optimal path leading up to that
point. Therefore, the optimal path can be deter-
mined by incremental extension of the optimal
subpaths (Schuler, 2002). For orthographic align-
ment, we consider words as input sequences and
we use a very simple substitution matrix, which

100



gives equal scores to all substitutions, disregard-
ing diacritics (e.g., we ensure that e and è are
matched).

3.2 Feature Extraction

Using aligned pairs of words as input, we extract
features around mismatches in the alignments.
There are three types of mismatches, correspond-
ing to the following operations: insertion, deletion
and substitution. For example, for the Romanian
word exhaustiv and its Italian cognate pair esaus-
tivo, the alignment is as follows:

e x h a u s t i v -
e s - a u s t i v o

The first mismatch (between x and s) is caused
by a substitution, the second mismatch (between
h and -) is caused by a deletion from source lan-
guage to target language, and the third mismatch
(between - and o) is caused by an insertion from
source language to target language. The features
we use are character n-grams around mismatches.
We experiment with two types of features:

i) n-grams around gaps, i.e., we account only
for insertions and deletions;

ii) n-grams around any type of mismatch, i.e.,
we account for all three types of mismatches.

The second alternative leads to better perfor-
mance, so we account for all mismatches. As
for the length of the grams, we experiment with
n ∈ {1, 2, 3}. We achieve slight improvements by
combining n-grams, i.e., for a given n, we use all
i-grams, where i ∈ {1, ..., n}. In order to provide
information regarding the position of the features,
we mark the beginning and the end of the word
with a $ symbol. Thus, for the above-mentioned
pair of cognates, (exhaustiv, esaustivo), we extract
the following features when n = 2:

x>s ex>es xh>s-
h>- xh>s- ha>-a
->o v->vo -$>o$

For identical features we account only once.
Therefore, because there is one feature (xh>s-)
which occurs twice in our example, we have 8 fea-
tures for the pair (exhaustiv, esaustivo).

3.3 Learning Algorithms

We use Naive Bayes as a baseline and we exper-
iment with Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to

learn orthographic changes and to discriminate be-
tween pairs of cognates and non-cognates. We
put our system together using the Weka work-
bench (Hall et al., 2009), a suite of machine learn-
ing algorithms and tools. For SVM, we use the
wrapper provided by Weka for LibSVM (Chang
and Lin, 2011). We use the radial basis function
kernel (RBF), which can handle the case when
the relation between class labels and attributes is
non-linear, as it maps samples non-linearly into a
higher dimensional space. Given two instances xi
and xj , where xi ∈ Rn, the RBF kernel function
for xi and xj is defined as follows:

K(xi, xj) = exp(−γ||xi − xj ||2), γ > 0,
where γ is a kernel parameter.

We split the data in two subsets, for training
and testing, with a 3:1 ratio, and we perform grid
search and 3-fold cross validation over the train-
ing set in order to optimize hyperparameters c
and γ. We search over {1, 2, ..., 10} for c and
over {10−5, 10−4, ..., 104, 105} for γ. The values
which optimize accuracy on the training set are re-
ported, for each pair of languages, in Table 3.

4 Experiments

4.1 Data
We apply our method on an automatically ex-
tracted dataset of cognates for four pairs of
languages: Romanian-French, Romanian-Italian,
Romanian-Spanish and Romanian-Portuguese. In
order to build the dataset, we apply the method-
ology proposed by Ciobanu and Dinu (2014) on
the DexOnline1 machine-readable dictionary for
Romanian. We discard pairs of words for which
the forms across languages are identical (i.e., the
Romanian word matrice and its Italian cognate
pair matrice, having the same form), because these
pairs do not provide any orthographic changes to
be learned. For each pair of languages we de-
termine a number of non-cognate pairs equal to
the number of cognate pairs. Finally, we ob-
tain 445 pairs of cognates for Romanian-French2,
3,477 for Romanian-Italian, 5,113 for Romanian-
Spanish and 7,858 for Romanian-Portuguese. Be-
cause we need sets of approximately equal size for

2The number of pairs of cognates is much lower for

French than for the other languages because there are numer-
ous Romanian words which have French etymology and, in
this paper, we do not consider these words to be cognate can-
didates.

comparison across languages, we keep 400 pairs
of cognates and 400 pairs of non-cognates for each
pair of languages. In Tables 1 and 2 we provide,
for each pair of languages, the five most relevant
2-gram orthographic changes, determined using
the χ2 distribution implemented in Weka, and the
five most frequent 2-gram orthographic changes in
the cognate pairs from our dataset3. None of the
top ranked orthographic cues occurs at the begin-
ning of the word, while many of them occur at the
end of the word. The most frequent operation in
Tables 1 and 2 is substitution.

4.2 Results Analysis

We propose a method for automatic detection
of cognate pairs using orthographic alignment.
We experiment with two machine-learning ap-
proaches: Naive Bayes and SVM. In Table 3 we
report the results of our research. We report the
n-gram values for which the best results are ob-
tained and the hyperparameters for SVM, c and γ.
The best results are obtained for French and Span-
ish, while the lowest accuracy is obtained for Por-
tuguese. The SVM produces better results for all
languages except Portuguese, where the accuracy
is equal. For Portuguese, both Naive Bayes and
SVM misclassify more non-cognates as cognates

3For brevity, we use in the tables the ISO 639-1 codes for
language abbreviation. We denote pairs of languages by the
target language, given the fact that Romanian is always the
source language in our experiments.

than viceversa. A possible explanation might be
the occurrence, in the dataset, of more remotely
related words, which are not labeled as cognates.
We plan to investigate this assumption and to ap-
ply the proposed method on other datasets in our
future work.

4.3 Comparison with Previous Methods
We investigate the performance of the method we
propose in comparison to previous approaches for
automatic detection of cognate pairs based on or-
thographic similarity. We employ several ortho-
graphic metrics widely used in this research area:
the edit distance (Levenshtein, 1965), the longest
common subsequence ratio (Melamed, 1995) and
the XDice metric (Brew and McKelvie, 1996)4.
In addition, we use SpSim (Gomes and Lopes,
2011), which outperformed the longest common
subsequence ratio and a similarity measure based
on the edit distance in previous experiments. To
evaluate these metrics on our dataset, we use the
same train/test sets as we did in our previous ex-
periments and we follow the strategy described in
(Inkpen et al., 2005). First, we compute the pair-
wise distances between pairs of words for each
orthographic metric individually, as a single fea-
ture5. In order to detect the best threshold for dis-
criminating between cognates and non-cognates,
we run a decision stump classifier (provided by
Weka) on the training set for each pair of lan-
guages and for each metric. A decision stump is a
decision tree classifier with only one internal node
and two leaves corresponding to our two class la-
bels. Using the best threshold value selected for
each metric and pair of languages, we further clas-
sify the pairs of words in our test sets as cognates
or non-cognates. In Table 4 we report the results
for each approach. Our method performs better
than the orthographic metrics considered as indi-
vidual features. Out of the four similarity met-
rics, SpSim obtains, overall, the best performance.
These results support the relevance of accounting
for orthographic cues in cognate identification.

4We use normalized similarity metrics. For the edit dis-
tance, we subtract the normalized value from 1 in order to
obtain similarity.

5SpSim cannot be computed directly, as the other metrics,
so we introduce an additional step in which we use 1/3 of the
training set (only cognates are needed) to learn orthographic
changes. In order to maintain a stratified dataset, we discard
an equal number of non-cognates in the training set and then
we compute the distances for the rest of the training set and
for the test set. We use the remaining of the initial training
set for the next step of the procedure.

5 Conclusions and Future Work

In this paper we proposed a method for automatic
detection of cognates based on orthographic align-
ment. We employed the Needleman-Wunsch al-
gorithm (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970) for se-
quence alignment widely-used in computational
biology and we used aligned pairs of words to
extract rules for lexical changes occurring when
words enter new languages. We applied our
method on an automatically extracted dataset of
cognates for four pairs of languages.

As future work, we plan to extend our method
on a few levels. In this paper we used a very
simple substitution matrix for the alignment algo-
rithm, but the method can be adapted to integrate
historical information regarding language evolu-
tion. The substitution matrix for the alignment al-
gorithm can be customized with language-specific
information, in order to reflect the probability of
a character to change into another. An important
achievement in this direction belongs to Delmestri
and Cristianini (2010), who introduced PAM-like
matrices, linguistic-inspired substitution matrices
which are based on information regarding ortho-
graphic changes. We plan to investigate the con-
tribution of using this type of substitution matrices
for our method.

We intend to investigate other approaches to
string alignment, such as local alignment (Smith

and Waterman, 1981), and other learning algo-
rithms for discriminating between cognates and
non-cognates. We plan to extend our analysis with
more language-specific features, where linguistic
knowledge is available. First, we intend to use the
part of speech as an additional feature. We assume
that some orthographic changes are dependent on
the part of speech of the words. Secondly, we want
to investigate whether accounting for the common
ancestor language influences the results. We are
interested to find out if the orthographic rules de-
pend on the source language, or if they are rather
specific to the target language. Finally, we plan to
make a performance comparison on cognate pairs
versus word-etymon pairs and to investigate false
friends (Nakov et al., 2007).

We further intend to adapt our method for cog-
nate detection to a closely related task, namely
cognate production, i.e., given an input word w,
a related language L and a set of learned rules for
orthographic changes, to produce the cognate pair
of w in L.
