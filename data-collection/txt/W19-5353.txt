Abstract

We present a test set for evaluating an MT sys-
tem’s capability to translate ambiguous con-
junctions depending on the sentence struc-
ture. We concentrate on the English conjunc-
tion ”but” and its French equivalent ”mais”
which can be translated into two different Ger-
man conjunctions. We evaluate all English-to-
German and French-to-German submissions
to the WMT 2019 shared translation task. The
evaluation is done mainly automatically, with
additional fast manual inspection of unclear
cases.

All systems almost perfectly recognise the tar-
get conjunction ”aber”, whereas accuracies for
the other target conjunction ”sondern” range
from 78% to 97%, and the errors are mostly
caused by replacing it with the alternative con-
junction ”aber”. The best performing system
for both language pairs is a multilingual Trans-
former TartuNLP system trained on all WMT
2019 language pairs which use the Latin script,
indicating that the multilingual approach is
beneficial for conjunction disambiguation. As
for other system features, such as using syn-
thetic back-translated data, context-aware, hy-
brid, etc., no particular (dis)advantages can be
observed.

Qualitative manual inspection of translation
hypotheses shown that highly ranked systems
generally produce translations with high ade-
quacy and fluency, meaning that these systems
are not only capable of capturing the right con-
junction whereas the rest of the translation hy-
pothesis is poor. On the other hand, the low
ranked systems generally exhibit lower fluency
and poor adequacy.

1 Introduction

Ambiguous words are often difficult to translate
automatically, even by the current state-of-the-art
neural machine (NMT) systems. Whereas NMT
systems produce more fluent (grammatical and

natural) translations than the previous state-of-the-
art statistical phrase-based (PBMT) models, the
semantic faithfulness of the translation to the orig-
inal (adequacy) is still often problematic (Castilho
et al., 2017; Klubička et al., 2018). Adequacy
is even more problematic for ambiguous words
which have two or more meanings depending on
the context. Whereas the ambiguity of nouns,
verbs and pronouns has been evaluated extensively
in the recent years (Burchardt et al., 2017; Müller
et al., 2018; Rios Gonzales et al., 2017, 2018), no
results for conjunctions have been reported so far,
and conjunctions can be ambiguous, too. It should
be noted, though, that the conjunction ambiguity is
more structural than lexical: it is mainly related to
certain aspects of grammar involving the arrange-
ment of words and word types. Therefore, the con-
junction ambiguity is related more to fluency than
to adequacy. The only work dealing with conjunc-
tions and machine translation (Huang, 1983) ex-
plores conjunction scope for rule-based MT sys-
tems and does not address the ambiguity.

Our aim is to enable quantitative analysis of
translating ambiguous conjunctions in a repro-
ducible and semi-automatic way and to compare
different types of systems in this respect. Our
test sets for WMT 2019 are designed for the En-
glish ambiguous conjunction ”but” and its French
equivalent ”mais”, each of which can be translated
into two different German conjunctions, ”aber” or
”sondern”. The content is mainly based on gen-
eral domain from subtitles (Tiedemann, 2012). In-
stead of comparing the translation hypotheses with
a reference translation, we base the evaluation on
the presence or absence of the correct conjunction
in the target language. For unclear cases (about
1% of segments), manual inspection is carried out.
We report results on all English→German and
French→German submissions to the WMT 2019
shared translation task.

In addition to German, the test sets can be used
for any target language which has these two vari-
ants of the conjunction ”but” (for example Spanish
or Croatian).

2 German equivalents of ”but”/”mais”

The English coordinating conjunction ”but” and
its French equivalent ”mais” are ambiguous when
translated into certain target languages such as
German. In German, there are two possible vari-
ants, ”aber” and ”sondern”. ”Aber” can be used
after either a positive or a negative clause. On the
other hand, ”sondern” is only used after a nega-
tive clause when expressing a contradiction. The
first clause in the sentence must contain a negation
marker, and the second part of the sentence must
contradict the first part of the sentence.

Three examples can be seen in Table 1. The
sentences on the left have the same context, same
or similar meanining, and contain similar words as
the sentences on the right. Nevertheless, the con-
junction ”but” in all sentences on the left should
be translated as ”aber” and in those on the right
as ”sondern”. This illustrates the statement from
the previous section about the structural nature of
conjunction ambiguity.

Generally, sentences with ”aber” can be found
more frequently in the data. Table 2 presents the
distribution of the two types of sentences in the
WMT 2019 News Commentary training corpus.
In addition, it can be noted that both types of sen-
tences occure rarely in the News corpus (less than
4% in total).

3 Test sets

3.1 Preparation

The test sets are generated semi-automatically us-
ing the bilingual subtitles corpora1 according to
the following requirements: (i) include only short
segments (up to 20 words) (ii) remove all noise
(iii) avoid complex words and rare name entities
which could introduce additional effects.

First step was to extract all short segments con-
taining the desired conjunctions in the source (En-
glish and French) and the target (German) lan-
guage, and the second step was manual elimina-
tion or rephrasing complex and noisy parts. In this
way, about 1000 sentences for each of the source

1http://opus.nlpl.eu/OpenSubtitles-v2018.php

languages were prepared, containing about 800 in-
stances of ”sondern” and 200 instances of ”aber”.
Since our preliminary experiments shown that the
sentences requiring ”aber” are less difficult for MT
systems, we concentrate more on the performance
for the conjunction ”sondern”.

A detailed corpus statistics is presented in Ta-
ble 3. It can be seen that the segments are rel-
atively short, and the vocabulary size relatively
low – the vocabulary size of the standard English
test set from WMT 2018 is more than double,
about 5000 distinct words, and the average sen-
tence length is 22.5. Apart from this, it can be
seen that the average segment length of the easier
”aber” instances is slightly lower.

It should be noted that, although the basis for
the generation of the test sets was a bilingual cor-
pus, the resulting test sets do not contain any ref-
erence translations. The reason for this is twofold:
on the one hand, bilingual manual filtering of
noisy and complex content would be very time
and resource consuming. On the other hand, ref-
erence translations are not really needed – since
we are interesting only in conjunction disambigua-
tion, checking the conjunction in the translation
hypothesis is sufficient and it can be carried out
without a reference translation.

3.2 Evaluation
The vast majority of checks is performed automat-
ically, however for a small number of sentences
(usually 1-2%) a manual inspection is needed. For
each sentence, there are four possible outcomes of
the automatic evaluation:

• only the correct conjunction is found
⇒ correct

• only the opposite conjunction is found
⇒ incorrect

• both conjunctions are found
⇒ manual inspection

• none of the two conjunctions is found
⇒ manual inspection

Manual inspection is carried out in the following
way: if the structure of a sentence with additional
or without any conjunctions is correct, then the
sentence is considered correct. All errors which
are not related to the conjunction are ignored, both
by automatic and by manual evaluation.

4 MT Systems

4.1 English-to-German
All English-to-German systems are trained on the
constraint data except en-de-task and PROMT-
NMT. For the en-de-task system, as well as the
Microsoft-doc/sent level systems, no additional in-
formation is available.

All other systems are based on the Transformer
architecture, and UCAM uses the phrase-based ap-
proach too, thus being the only hybrid system.

All systems used BPE2 segmentation except
eTranslation which used SentencePiece3 segmen-
tation.

MSRA.MADL, TartuNLP and UdS-DFKI were
trained only on natural parallel data, whereas all
other systems used synthetic back-translated data,
too. JHU, NEU and UCAM performed back-
translation more than once.

The LMU and UdS-DFKI systems are context
aware, UdS-DFKI being coreference aware.

MSRA.MADL used multi-agent dual learning
(MADL)4.

The only multilingual system is TartuNLP, one
and the same Transformer system trained on all
WMT language pairs which use Latin script.

4.2 French-to-German
All French-to-German systems are based on the
Transformer architecture and used the constrained
data.

2https://github.com/rsennrich/subword-nmt
3https://github.com/google/sentencepiece
4https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HyGhN2A5tm

All systems used BPE units except eTranslation
which used SentencePiece units.

MSRA.MADL and TartuNLP are trained only on
natural parallel data, whereas eTranslation, LIUM
and MLLP-UPV used additional synthetic back-
translated data.

MSRA.MADL again used multi-agent dual
learning (MADL).

TartuNLP is again the only multilingual system,
the same one used for the English-to-German task.

5 Results

The results are presented in Table 4 in the form of
percentage of sentences automatically identified as
correct (”aut.”), identified as correct after both au-
tomatic check and manual inspection (”full”), and
automatically identified as incorrect because the
source conjunction is translated into the opposite
conjunction (”opposite”). The systems are ranked
by the full accuracy of the conjunction ”sondern”.

5.1 General observations

Generally, the same tendencies are observed for
both language pairs.

First of all, in can be noted that the results of
our preliminary experiments mentioned in Sec-
tion 2 are confirmed on the large scale: translating
sentences requiring the conjunction ”aber” is not
problematic for any of the systems: the percent-
age of correct sentences is 100%, or in the worst
cases, close to 100%, for both language pairs and
all systems.

As for the ”difficult” conjunction ”sondern”, the
majority of the systems translates it correctly in
90-95% of cases, and the predominant problem for
the rest is translating it as ”aber” (5-10%). Other
types of errors are found in only very small num-
ber of cases (for example, parts of the sentences
left untranslated, or completely incorrect sentence
structure).

For the sentences with both conjunctions or
without any of the two conjunctions, manual in-

spection is carried out. For English-to-German
systems, only a small number of sentences fall into
these two categories, so that manual inspection has
no or very little effect on ranking. For four ”on-
line” French-to-German systems, online-A, -B, -
G and -Y, however, a larger number of sentence
without conjunctions is found.

Both conjunctions: Manual inspection re-
vealed that this is not problematic: it can happen
if ”however”, ”yet” or similar word which can be
translated as ”aber” is present in the source sen-
tence. Two examples can be seen in Table 5.

No conjunctions: For the English source, it
can happen for a small number of sentences with
structure ”not only X, but Y, too”, whereas for the
French source a number of other sentence struc-
tures was paraphrased, too. Some of these para-
phrased translations are perfect, whereas some of
them are not as fluent as they would be if the con-
struction with conjunction were used, but are nev-
ertheless considered as correct. Two examples can
be seen in Table 6.

5.2 Differences between the systems

The first and very interesting observation is that
the best performing system for both language pairs
is the multilingual TartuNLP system. The advan-
tage of a multilingual system is probably its ability
to get a signal for different structures from many
languages, so that the information about differ-
ent variants of the target conjunction necessary for
different source sentence structures is better cap-
tured.

As for other system features, no particular dif-
ferences can be spotted. For example, the best
system TartuNLP is trained only on natural paral-
lel data, the other system without back-translation
MSRA.MADL performed very well, one system
using multiple back-translation NEU is ranked

mais un humain.

source (en gloss) It is not a robot,
but a human.

French-to-German systems).

as second and two other such systems JHU and
UCAM in the middle, so no (dis)advantage of
synthetic parallel data can be observed. Further-
more, two context-aware English-to-German sys-
tems LMU and UdS-DFKI as well as the hybrid
UCAM system are ranged in the middle, thus no
clear (dis)advangates of either of the approaches
can be noted.
Qualitative analysis of overall performance
In order to check whether the best ranked systems
maybe produce generally poor translations and
only capture the conjunctions correctly, as well as
other way round (maybe the lowest ranked sys-
tems produce fluent and adequate translations), we
carried out a manual qualitative inspection of five
highest and five lowest ranked hypotheses. The
most important finding is that the best ranked sys-
tems produce decent translations both in terms of
adequacy and fluency, meaning that these systems
are not only capable of choosing the right conjunc-
tion while generating poor translations. As for the
low ranked systems, they all have much lower flu-
ency and adequacy, especially the lowest ranked
en-de-task system with very low adequacy and a
number of non-existing words.

Of course, to draw stabler conclusions, a
systematic quantitative analysis of correlation
between conjunction disambiguation and ade-
quacy/fluency should be carried out in future
work.

6 Conclusions

We present a targeted evaluation of 21 English-
to-German and 10 French-to-German MT systems
regarding their performance in lexical choice for
ambiguous source conjunction ”but”/”mais”. We
observe that all systems almost perfectly recog-
nise the target conjunction ”aber”, whereas accu-
racies for the other target conjunction ”sondern”
range from 78% to 97%, and the errors are mostly
caused by replacing it with the alternative conjunc-
tion ”aber”.

The best performing system on the ”difficult”
target variant ”sondern” for both source languages
is based on the multilingual transformer model
trained on all WMT language pairs using Latin
script. The advantage of a multilingual system
might be a better ability to learn the relation
between different sentence structures and corre-
sponding conjunctions. Apart of this, there are no
other clear differences between the systems.

Qualitative analysis of translation hypotheses
shown that highly ranked systems generally pro-
duce translations with high adequacy and fluency,
meaning that they are not only capable of captur-
ing the right conjunction whereas the rest of the
translation hypothesis is poor. On the other hand,
the low ranked systems generally exhibit lower
fluency and poor adequacy. Quantitative analy-
sis of correlation between the conjunction disam-
biguation and overall performance should be a part
of future work.

The current study is focused on only one am-
biguous conjunction and only one target language.
In future, we plan to extend the test set with more
conjunctions (and variants), and possibly, to more
language pairs.
