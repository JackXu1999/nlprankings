Abstract

Classification of texts by genre is an impor-
tant application of natural language process-
ing to literary corpora but remains understud-
ied for premodern and non-English traditions.
We develop a stylometric feature set for an-
cient Greek that enables identification of texts
as prose or verse. The set contains over 20
primarily syntactic features, which are calcu-
lated according to custom, language-specific
heuristics. Using these features, we classify
almost all surviving classical Greek literature
as prose or verse with >97% accuracy and F1
score, and further classify a selection of the
verse texts into the traditional genres of epic
and drama.

1 Introduction

Classification of large corpora of documents into
coherent groups is an important application of nat-
ural language processing. Research on document
organization has led to a variety of successful
methods for automatic genre classification (Sta-
matatos et al., 2000; Santini, 2007). Computa-
tional analysis of genre has most often involved
material from a single source (e.g., a newspaper
corpus, for which the goal is to distinguish be-
tween news articles and opinion pieces) or from
standard, well-curated test corpora that contain
primarily non-literary texts (e.g., the Brown cor-
pus or equivalents in other languages) (Kessler
et al., 1997; Petrenz and Webber, 2011; Amasyali
and Diri, 2006).

Notions of genre are also of substantial impor-
tance to the study of literature. For instance, ex-
amination of the distinctive characteristics of var-
ious forms of poetry dates to classical Greece and
Rome (for instance, by Aristotle and Quintilian)
and remains an active area of humanistic research
today (Frow, 2015). A number of computational

analyses of literary genre have been reported, us-
ing both English and non-English corpora such
as classical Malay poetry, German novels, and
Arabic religious texts (Tizhoosh et al., 2008; Ku-
mar and Minz, 2014; Jamal et al., 2012; Hettinger
et al., 2015; Al-Yahya, 2018). However, computa-
tional prediction of even relatively coarse generic
distinctions (such as between prose and poetry) re-
mains unexplored for classical Greek literature.

Encompassing the epic poems of Homer, the
tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides,
the historical writings of Herodotus, and the phi-
losophy of Plato and Aristotle, the surviving lit-
erature of ancient Greece is foundational for the
Western literary tradition. Here we report a com-
putational analysis of genre involving the whole of
the classical Greek literary tradition. Using a cus-
tom set of language-specific stylometric features,
we classify texts as prose or verse and, for the
verse texts, as epic or drama with >97% accuracy.
An important advantage of our approach is that all
of the features can be computed without syntactic
parsing, which remains in an early phase of de-
velopment for ancient Greek. As such, our work
illustrates how computational modeling of liter-
ary texts, where research has concentrated over-
whelmingly on modern English literature (Elson
et al., 2010; Elsner, 2012; Bamman et al., 2014;
Chaturvedi et al., 2016; Wilkens, 2016), can be ex-
tended to premodern, non-Anglophone traditions.

2 Stylometric feature set for ancient
Greek

The feature set is composed of 23 features cov-
ering four broad grammatical and syntactical cat-
egories. The majority of the features are func-
tion or non-content words, such as pronouns and
syntactical markers; a minority concern rhetorical
functions, such as questions and uses of superla-

tive adjectives and adverbs. Function words are
standard features in stylometric research on En-
glish (Stamatatos, 2009; Hughes et al., 2012) and
have also been used in studies of ancient Greek lit-
erature (Gorman and Gorman, 2016). Our feature
selection is not drawn from a prior source but has
been devised based on three criteria: amenabil-
ity to exact or approximate calculation without
use of syntactic parsing, substantial applicability
to the corpus, and diversity of function. The fea-
ture set is listed in Table 1. The first restric-
tion is necessary because a general-purpose syn-
tactic parser remains to be developed for classi-
cal Greek (notwithstanding promising early-stage
research through the open-source Classical Lan-
guage Toolkit and other projects). All features are
per-character frequencies with the exception of a
handful that are normalized by sentence (indicated
in the table by “sentences with...”).

in standard studies of English stylistics, such as
pronouns, others are specific to ancient Greek. At-
tention to language-specific features enhances sty-
lometric methods developed for the English lan-
guage and not directly transferable to languages
possessing a different structure (Rybicki and Eder,
2011; Kestemont, 2014). Greek particles, for ex-
ample, are uninflected adverbs used for a wide
range of logical and emotional expressions; in En-
glish their equivalent meaning is often expressed
by a phrase or, in speech, tone. In order to avoid
significant problems arising from dialectical vari-
ation, including a large increase in homonyms, we
restrict features to the Attic dialect, in which the
majority of classical Greek texts were composed.
Many features are computed by counting all in-
flected forms of the appropriate word(s), which
can be found in any standard ancient Greek text-
book or grammar such as Smyth (1956). A de-
tailed description of the methods for computing
the features is given in Appendix A.

Calculation of five features relies on heuris-
tics to disambiguate between words of similar
morphology. (All other features can be calcu-
lated exactly.) To assess the effectiveness of
these heuristics, we hand-annotate the five features
in a representative sub-corpus containing three
verse (Homer’s Odyssey 6, Quintus of Smyrna’s
Posthomerica 12, and Euripides’ Cyclops) and two
prose (Lysias 7 and Plutarch’s Caius Gracchus)
texts. Table 2 lists the precision and recall of each
feature on the aggregated verse and prose texts. In
every instance, the precision is > 0.95 and the re-
call is > 0.85.

3 Experimental setup

3.1 Dataset

We use a corpus of ancient Greek text files, which
was assembled by the Perseus Digital Library
and further processed by Tesserae Project (Crane,
1996; Coffee et al., 2012). A full list of texts is
provided in Appendix B. Each file typically con-
tains either an entire work of literature (e.g., a play
or a short philosophical treatise) or one book of a
longer work (e.g., Book 1 of Homer’s Iliad). 29
files are composites of multiple books included
elsewhere in the Tesserae corpus and are omitted
from our analysis, leaving 751 files. In total, this
corpus contains essentially all surviving classical
Greek literature and spans from the 8th century
BCE to the 6th century CE.

For our first experiment, we hand-annotate the
full set of texts as prose (610 files) or verse
(141 files) according to standard conventions (Ap-
pendix B). For the second experiment, we hand-
annotate the verse texts as epic (82 files) and
drama (45 files), setting aside 14 files that contain
poems of other genres (Appendix C).

3.2 Feature extraction

All text processing is done using Python 3.6.5.
We first tokenize the files from the Tesserae cor-
pus into either words or sentences using the Nat-
ural Language Toolkit (NLTK; v. 3.3.0) (Bird
et al., 2009). For sentence tokenization, we
use the PunktSentenceTokenizer class of NLTK
Greek (Kiss and Strunk, 2006). After tokeniza-
tion, the features are calculated either by tabu-
lating instances of signal n-grams or (for length-
based features) counting characters exclusive of
whitespace, as described in Appendix A.

3.3 Supervised learning

All supervised learning is done using Python
3.6.5. For each experiment, we use the scikit-learn
(v. 0.19.2) implementation of the random forest
classifier. A full list of hyperparameters and other
settings is given in Appendix D. For each binary
classification experiment (prose vs. verse and epic
vs. drama), we perform 400 trials of stratified 5-
fold cross-validation; each trial has a unique com-
bination of two random seeds, one used to initial-
ize the classifier and the other to initialize the data
splitter. Feature rankings are determined by the
average Gini importance across the 400 trials.

4 Results

4.1 Prose vs. verse classification

Using the workflow described in Section 3.3, we
classify each of the literary texts in the corpus
as prose or verse. Table 3 lists the accuracy and
weighted F1 score for a sample cross-validation
trial, along with the mean for that trial and overall
mean across the 400 trials. We find that the texts
can be classified as prose or verse with extremely
high accuracy using the set of 23 stylometric fea-
tures and that, despite the small size of the corpus,
classifier performance is robust to the choice of
cross-validation partition. The five highest-ranked
features are given in Table 4. Outside of these five,
no other feature has a Gini importance of > 0.05.
All five features predominate in prose rather than
poetry, of which three are pronouns or pronom-
inal adjectives. The sustained discussions com-
monly found in various prose genres may favor
the use of pronouns to avoid extensive repetition of
nouns and proper names. The high ranking of con-
junctions is plausibly connected to the longer sen-
tences characteristic of most prose (mean length
205 characters, compared to 166 characters for po-
etry).

4.2 Classification of poems as epic or drama

The genres of epic and drama are in certain re-
spects quite distinct: they differ in length and po-
etic meter, and the vocabulary of Aristophanes’
comic plays is unlike either epic or tragedy. In
other aspects of form and content, however, they
have much in common, including passages of di-
rect speech, high register diction, and mytholog-
ical subject matter. The playwright Aeschylus
is even reported to have described his tragedies
as “slices from the great banquets of Homer”
(Athenaeus, Deipnosophistae 8.347E). The sim-
ilarities between epic and drama thus present an
intuitively greater challenge for classification.

Table 5 summarizes the results of the epic vs.
drama experiment, for which we achieve perfor-
mance comparable to that of the prose vs. verse
experiment. Table 6 lists the top features, which
reflect several important differences between the
genres. The most important feature - sentence
length - highlights the relatively shorter sentences
of drama compared to epic, which can be ex-
plained at least in part by the rapid exchanges be-
tween speakers that occur throughout both tragedy
and comedy. Although sentence length is a fea-
ture that can be affected by modern editorial prac-
tice, the difference between drama and epic on
this score is sufficiently large that it cannot be ex-
plained by variations in editorial practice alone (<
80 characters/sentence on average across dramatic
texts, > 150 characters/sentence for epic). The im-
portance of demonstrative pronouns, ranked sec-
ond, plausibly captures a different side of drama
- the habit of characters referring, often indexi-
cally, to persons or objects in the plot (e.g., ἐκε͂ινος
ὁ͂υτός ἐιμι, ekeinos houtos eimi, “I am that very
man,” Euripides, Cyclops 105, which uses two

demonstrative pronouns in succession). Another
typical characteristic of dramatic plot and dialogue
accounts for the third highly-ranked feature - in-
terrogative sentences - since both tragedies and
comedies often show characters in a state of uncer-
tainty or ignorance, or making inquiries of other
characters. Although many of the features in the
full set are correlated (e.g., sentence length and
various markers of subordinate clauses), none of
the top 5 plausibly are, suggesting that the analy-
sis identifies a diverse set of stylistic markers for
epic and drama.

4.3 Misclassifications
For epic vs. drama, no text is misclassified in
more than 12% of the trials. For prose vs. verse,
only five texts are misclassified in >50% of the tri-
als (Demades, On the Twelve Years; Dionysius of
Halicarnassus, De Antiquis Oratoribus Reliquiae
2; Plato, Epistle 1; Aristotle, Virtues and Vices;
Sophocles, Ichneutae). Most of the common mis-
classifications result from highly fragmentary or
short texts. Almost half the speech of Demades,
for example, contains short or incomplete sen-
tences. The misclassified text of Dionysius of
Halicarnassus amounts to only a few unconnected
sentences; Sophocles’ Ichneutae (the only verse
text misclassified in over half the trials) is also
fragmentary. The third most frequently misclas-
sified text, Plato’s First Epistle, in fact highlights
the classifier’s effectiveness, as it contains several
verse quotations, which (given the short length of
the text) plausibly account for the error.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we demonstrate that ancient Greek
literature can be classified by genre using a
straightforward supervised learning approach and
stylometric features calculated without syntactic
parsing. Our work suggests a number of natu-
ral follow-up analyses, especially extension of the
experiments to encompass the full range of tradi-



56

tional prose genres (such as historiography, philos-
ophy, and oratory) and application of the feature
set to other questions in classical literary criticism.
In addition, we hope that our heuristic approach
will motivate and inform analogous work on other
premodern traditions for which natural language
processing research remains at an early stage.

A Details of stylometric features for
ancient Greek

A.1 Pronouns and non-content adjectives
• ἄλλος (allos, “other”) is computed by count-

ing all inflected forms of ἄλλος, -η, -ο.

• αὐτός (autos, “self” or “him/her/it”) is com-
puted by counting all inflected forms of
αὐτός, -ή, -ό.

• Demonstrative pronouns are computed by
counting all inflected forms of the three
Greek demonstrative pronouns οὗτος, αὕτη,
τοῦτο (houtos, haute, touto, “this”), ὅδε,
ἥδε, τόδε (hode, hede, tode, “this”), and
ἐκεῖνος, ἐκεῖνη, ἐκεῖνο (ekeinos, ekeine,
ekeino, “that”).

• Selected indefinite pronouns are computed by
counting all inflected forms of τις, τις, τι (tis,
tis, ti, “any”) in non-interrogative sentences.
Interrogative sentences are excluded because
the Greek interrogative pronoun (τίς) is often
identical in form to the indefinite pronoun.

• Personal pronouns are computed by counting
all inflected forms of the pronouns ἐγώ (ego,
“I”) and σύ (su, “you”).

• Reflexive pronouns are computed by count-
ing all inflected forms of ἐμαυτοῦ (emautou,
“he himself”).

A.2 Conjunctions and particles
• Conjunctions are computed by counting all

instances of the common conjunctions τε, τ΄
(te or t, “and”), καί, καὶ (kai, “and”), ἀλλά,
ἀλλὰ (alla, “but”), καίτοι (kaitoi, “and in-
deed”), οὐδέ, οὐδὲ, οὐδ΄ (oude or oud, “and
not”), μηδέ, μηδὲ, μηδ΄ (mede or med, “and
not”), οὔτε, οὔτ΄ (oute or out, “and not”),
μήτε, μήτ΄ (mete or met, “and not”), and ἤ,
ἢ (e, “or”).

• μέν (men, “indeed”) is computed by counting
all instances of μέν and μὲν.

• Particles are computed by counting all in-
stances of ἄν, ἂν (an, a particle used to ex-
press uncertainty or possibility), ἆρα (ara,
“then”), γέ, γ΄ (ge or g, “at least”), δ΄, δέ,
δὲ (d or de, “but”), δή, δὴ (de, “indeed”),
ἕως (heos, “until”), κ΄, κε, κέ, κὲ, κέν, κὲν,
κεν (k, ke, ken, a particle used to express

A.3 Subordinate clauses
• Circumstantial markers are computed by

counting all instances of ἔπειτα, ἔπειτ΄ (epeita
or epeit, “then”), ὅμως (homos, “all the
same”), ὁμῶς (homos, “equally”), καίπερ
(kaiper, “although”), and ἅτε, ἅτ΄ (hate or hat,
“seeing that”).

• Conditional markers are computed by count-
ing all instances of εἰ, εἴ, εἲ, ἐάν, and ἐὰν (ei,
ei, ei, ean, ean, all translated “if”).

• ἵνα (hina, an adverb of place often translated
“where” or a conjunction indicating purpose
often translated “in order that”) is computed
by counting all instances of ἵνα and ἵν΄ (hin).

• ὅπως (hopos, an adverb of manner often
translated “how” or a conjunction indicating
purpose often translated “in order that”) is
computed by counting all instances of ὅπως.

• Fraction of sentences with a relative clause is
determined by counting sentences that have
one or more of the inflected forms of the
Greek relative pronouns ὅς, ἥ, ὅ (hos, he, ho,
“who” or “which”).

• Temporal and causal markers are computed
by counting all instances of μέκρι (mekri,
“until”), ἕως (heos, “until”), πρίν (prin, “be-
fore”), ἐπεί (epei, “when”), ἐπειδή (epeide,
“after” or “since”), ἐπειδάν (epeiden, “when-
ever”), ὅτε (hote, “when”), and ὅταν (hotan,
“whenever”).

• ὥστε (hoste, a conjunction used to indicate a
result, “so as to”) not preceded by ἤ is cal-
culated by counting all instances of ὥστε not
immediately preceded by ἤ. This limitation is
imposed to exclude instances in which ὥστε
is part of a comparative phrase.

• The mean length of relative clauses is deter-
mined by counting the number of characters
between each relative pronoun and the next
punctuation mark.

A.4 Miscellaneous

• Interrogative sentences are computed by
counting all instances of “;” (the Greek ques-
tion mark).

• Regular superlatives adjectives are computed
by counting all instances of -τατος, -τάτου,
-τάτῳ, -τατον, -τατοι, -τάτων, -τάτοις, -
τάτους, -τάτη, -τάτης, -τάτῃ, -τάτην, -
τάταις, -τάτας, -τατα, -τατά, and τατε at
word end. One inflected form, -ταται, is
excluded so as to avoid confusion with the
Homeric third person singular middle/passive
indicative verb ending -αται. This method
does not detect certain irregular superlatives,
such as ἄριστος (aristos, “best”) or πρῶτος
(protos, “first”), which would be significantly
harder to disambiguate from non-superlative
forms.

• Sentences with ὦ exclamations is determined
by identifying sentences that have at least one
instance of ὦ (o, “O”), a Greek exclamation.

• ὡς (hos, an adverb of manner often trans-
lated “how” or a conjunction often translated
as “that,” “so that,” or “since,” among several

other possibilities) is computed by counting
all instances of ὡς.

• Mean and variance of sentence length is de-
termined by counting the number of char-
acters in each tokenized sentence (see Sec-
tion 3.2 of main paper).
