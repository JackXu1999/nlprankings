Abstract

We present TriviaQA, a challenging
reading comprehension dataset contain-
ing over 650K question-answer-evidence
triples. TriviaQA includes 95K question-
answer pairs authored by trivia enthusi-
asts and independently gathered evidence
documents, six per question on average,
that provide high quality distant super-
vision for answering the questions. We
show that, in comparison to other recently
introduced large-scale datasets, TriviaQA
(1) has relatively complex, compositional
questions, (2) has considerable syntactic
and lexical variability between questions
and corresponding answer-evidence sen-
tences, and (3) requires more cross sen-
tence reasoning to find answers. We also
present two baseline algorithms: a feature-
based classifier and a state-of-the-art neu-
ral network, that performs well on SQuAD
reading comprehension. Neither approach
comes close to human performance (23%
and 40% vs. 80%), suggesting that Trivi-
aQA is a challenging testbed that is worth
significant future study.1

1 Introduction

Reading comprehension (RC) systems aim to an-
swer any question that could be posed against the
facts in some reference text. This goal is challeng-
ing for a number of reasons: (1) the questions can
be complex (e.g. have highly compositional se-
mantics), (2) finding the correct answer can re-
quire complex reasoning (e.g. combining facts
from multiple sentences or background knowl-
edge) and (3) individual facts can be difficult to

Question: The Dodecanese Campaign of WWII that
was an attempt by the Allied forces to capture islands in
the Aegean Sea was the inspiration for which acclaimed
1961 commando film?
Answer: The Guns of Navarone
Excerpt: The Dodecanese Campaign of World War II
was an attempt by Allied forces to capture the Italian-
held Dodecanese islands in the Aegean Sea following
the surrender of Italy in September 1943, and use them
as bases against the German-controlled Balkans. The
failed campaign, and in particular the Battle of Leros,
inspired the 1957 novel The Guns of Navarone and
the successful 1961 movie of the same name.

Question: American Callan Pinckney’s eponymously
named system became a best-selling (1980s-2000s)
book/video franchise in what genre?
Answer: Fitness
Excerpt: Callan Pinckney was an American fitness pro-
fessional. She achieved unprecedented success with her
Callanetics exercises. Her 9 books all became inter-
national best-sellers and the video series that followed
went on to sell over 6 million copies. Pinckney’s first
video release ”Callanetics: 10 Years Younger In 10
Hours” outsold every other fitness video in the US.

recover from text (e.g. due to lexical and syntactic
variation). Figure 1 shows examples of all these
phenomena. This paper presents TriviaQA, a new
reading comprehension dataset designed to simul-
taneously test all of these challenges.

Recently, significant progress has been made
by introducing large new reading comprehension
datasets that primarily focus on one of the chal-
lenges listed above, for example by crowdsourc-
ing the gathering of question answer pairs (Ra-
jpurkar et al., 2016) or using cloze-style sentences
instead of questions (Hermann et al., 2015; Onishi
et al., 2016) (see Table 1 for more examples). In
general, system performance has improved rapidly
as each resource is released. The best models of-

ten achieve near-human performance levels within
months or a year, fueling a continual need to build
ever more difficult datasets. We argue that Triv-
iaQA is such a dataset, by demonstrating that a
high percentage of its questions require solving
these challenges and showing that there is a large
gap between state-of-the-art methods and human
performance levels.

TriviaQA contains over 650K question-answer-
evidence triples, that are derived by combining
95K Trivia enthusiast authored question-answer
pairs with on average six supporting evidence doc-
uments per question. To our knowledge, TriviaQA
is the first dataset where full-sentence questions
are authored organically (i.e. independently of an
NLP task) and evidence documents are collected
retrospectively from Wikipedia and the Web. This
decoupling of question generation from evidence
collection allows us to control for potential bias
in question style or content, while offering organi-
cally generated questions from various topics. De-
signed to engage humans, TriviaQA presents a
new challenge for RC models. They should be
able to deal with large amount of text from var-
ious sources such as news articles, encyclopedic
entries and blog articles, and should handle infer-
ence over multiple sentences. For example, our
dataset contains three times as many questions that
require inference over multiple sentences than the
recently released SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016)
dataset. Section 4 present a more detailed discus-
sion of these challenges.

Finally, we present baseline experiments on the
TriviaQA dataset, including a linear classifier in-
spired by work on CNN Dailymail and MCTest
(Chen et al., 2016; Richardson et al., 2013) and a
state-of-the-art neural network baseline (Seo et al.,
2017). The neural model performs best, but only
achieves 40% for TriviaQA in comparison to 68%

on SQuAD, perhaps due to the challenges listed
above. The baseline results also fall far short of
human performance levels, 79.7%, suggesting sig-
nificant room for the future work. In summary, we
make the following contributions.

• We collect over 650K question-answer-
evidence triples, with questions originat-
ing from trivia enthusiasts independent of
the evidence documents. A high percent-
age of the questions are challenging, with
substantial syntactic and lexical variabil-
ity and often requiring multi-sentence rea-
soning. The dataset and code are avail-
able at http://nlp.cs.washington.
edu/triviaqa/, offering resources for
training new reading-comprehension models.

• We present a manual analysis quantifying the
quality of the dataset and the challenges in-
volved in solving the task.

• We present experiments with two baseline
methods, demonstrating that the TriviaQA
tasks are not easily solved and are worthy of
future study.

• In addition to the automatically gath-
ered large-scale (but noisy) dataset, we
present a clean, human-annotated subset
of 1975 question-document-answer triples
whose documents are certified to contain all
facts required to answer the questions.

2 Overview

Problem Formulation We frame reading com-
prehension as the problem of answering a ques-
tion q given the textual evidence provided by doc-
ument set D. We assume access to a dataset
of tuples {(qi, ai, Di)|i = 1 . . . n} where ai
is a text string that defines the correct answer

1602



to question qi. Following recent formulations
(Rajpurkar et al., 2016), we further assume that ai
appears as a substring for some document in the
set Di.2 However, we differ by setting Di as a
set of documents, where previous work assumed
a single document (Hermann et al., 2015) or even
just a short paragraph (Rajpurkar et al., 2016).

Data and Distant Supervision Our evidence
documents are automatically gathered from either
Wikipedia or more general Web search results (de-
tails in Section 3). Because we gather evidence
using an automated process, the documents are
not guaranteed to contain all facts needed to an-
swer the question. Therefore, they are best seen
as a source of distant supervision, based on the
assumption that the presence of the answer string
in an evidence document implies that the docu-
ment does answer the question.3 Section 4 shows
that this assumption is valid over 75% of the time,
making evidence documents a strong source of
distant supervision for training machine reading
systems.

In particular, we consider two types of distant
supervision, depending on the source of our doc-
uments. For web search results, we expect the
documents that contain the correct answer a to be
highly redundant, and therefore let each question-
answer-document tuple be an independent data
point. (|Di| = 1 for all i and qi = qj for many
i, j pairs). However, in Wikipedia we generally
expect most facts to be stated only once, so we in-
stead pool all of the evidence documents and never
repeat the same question in the dataset (|Di| = 1.8
on average and qi 6= qj for all i, j). In other words,
each question (paired with the union of all of its
evidence documents) is a single data point.

These are far from the only assumptions that
could be made in this distant supervision setup.
For example, our data would also support multi-
instance learning, which makes the at least once
assumption, from relation extraction (Riedel et al.,
2010; Hoffmann et al., 2011) or many other pos-
sibilities. However, the experiments in Section 6
show that these assumptions do present a strong

2The data we will present in Section 3 would further sup-
port a task formulation where some documents D do not have
the correct answer and the model must learn when to abstain.
We leave this to future work.

3An example context for the first question in Figure 1
where such an assumption fails would be the following ev-
idence string: The Guns of Navarone is a 1961 British-
American epic adventure war film directed by J. Lee Thomp-
son.

signal for learning; we believe the data will fuel
significant future study.

3 Dataset Collection

We collected a large dataset to support the read-
ing comprehension task described above. First we
gathered question-answer pairs from 14 trivia and
quiz-league websites. We removed questions with
less than four tokens, since these were generally
either too simple or too vague.

We then collected textual evidence to answer
questions using two sources: documents from
Web search results and Wikipedia articles for en-
tities in the question. To collect the former, we
posed each question4 as a search query to the Bing
Web search API, and collected the top 50 search
result URLs. To exclude the trivia websites, we
removed from the results all pages from the trivia
websites we scraped and any page whose url in-
cluded the keywords trivia, question, or answer.
We then crawled the top 10 search result Web
pages and pruned PDF and other ill formatted doc-
uments. The search output includes a diverse set
of documents such as blog articles, news articles,
and encyclopedic entries.

Wikipedia pages for entities mentioned in the
question often provide useful information. We
therefore collected an additional set of evidence
documents by applying TAGME, an off-the-shelf
entity linker (Ferragina and Scaiella, 2010), to find
Wikipedia entities mentioned in the question, and
added the corresponding pages as evidence docu-
ments.

Finally, to support learning from distant super-
vision, we further filtered the evidence documents
to exclude those missing the correct answer string
and formed evidence document sets as described
in Section 2. This left us with 95K question-
answer pairs organized into (1) 650K training ex-
amples for the Web search results, each contain-

query to avoid biasing the results.

4 Dataset Analysis

A quantitative and qualitative analysis of Trivi-
aQA shows it contains complex questions about a
diverse set of entities, which are answerable using
the evidence documents.

Question and answer analysis TriviaQA ques-
tions, authored by trivia enthusiasts, cover various
topics of people’s interest. The average question
length is 14 tokens indicating that many questions
are highly compositional. For qualitative analy-

sis, we sampled 200 question answer pairs and
manually analysed their properties. About 73.5%
of these questions contain phrases that describe a
fine grained category to which the answer belongs,
while 15.5% hint at a coarse grained category (one
of person, organization, location, and miscella-
neous). Questions often involve reasoning over
time frames, as well as making comparisons. A
summary of the analysis is presented in Table 3.

Answers in TriviaQA belong to a diverse set
of types. 92.85% of the answers are titles
in Wikipedia,5 4.17% are numerical expressions
(e.g., 9 kilometres) while the rest are open ended
noun and verb phrases. A coarse grained type

sented in Table 4. It should be noted that not
all Wikipedia titles are named entities; many are
common phrases such as barber or soup. Fig-
ure 2 shows diverse topics indicated by WordNet
synsets of answer entities.

Evidence analysis A qualitative analysis of
TriviaQA shows that the evidence contains an-
swers for 79.7% and 75.4% of questions from
the Wikipedia and Web domains respectively. To
analyse the quality of evidence and evaluate base-
lines, we asked a human annotator to answer 986
and 1345 (dev and test set) questions from the
Wikipedia and Web domains respectively. Trivia

dence sentence(s) exhibit syntactic and lexical variation with respect to questions. Answers are indicated
by boldfaced text.

questions contain multiple clues about the an-
swer(s) not all of which are referenced in the docu-
ments. The annotator was asked to answer a ques-
tion if the minimal set of facts (ignoring temporal
references like this year) required to answer the
question are present in the document, and abstain
otherwise. For example, it is possible to answer
the question, Who became president of the Mor-
mons in 1844, organised settlement of the Mor-
mons in Utah 1847 and founded Salt Lake City?
using only the fact that Salt Lake City was founded
by Brigham Young. We found that the accu-
racy (evaluated using the original answers) for the
Wikipedia and Web domains was 79.6 and 75.3
respectively. We use the correctly answered ques-
tions (and documents) as verified sets for evalua-
tion (section 6).

Challenging problem A comparison of evi-
dence with respect to the questions shows a
high proportion of questions require reason-
ing over multiple sentences. To compare our
dataset against previous datasets, we classified 100
question-evidence pairs each from Wikipedia and
the Web according to the form of reasoning re-
quired to answer them. We focus the analysis on
Wikipedia since the analysis on Web documents
are similar. Categories are not mutually exclusive:
single example can fall into multiple categories. A
summary of the analysis is presented in Table 5.

On comparing evidence sentences with their
corresponding questions, we found that 69% of
the questions had a different syntactic structure
while 41% were lexically different. For 40% of
the questions, we found that the information re-

1605



quired to answer them was scattered over multi-
ple sentences. Compared to SQuAD, over three
times as many questions in TriviaQA require rea-
soning over multiple sentences. Moreover, 17%
of the examples required some form of world
knowledge. Question-evidence pairs in Trivi-
aQA display more lexical and syntactic variance
than SQuAD. This supports our earlier assertion
that decoupling question generation from evidence
collection results in a more challenging problem.

5 Baseline methods

To quantify the difficulty level of the dataset for
current methods, we present results on neural and
other models. We used a random entity base-
line and a simple classifier inspired from previ-
ous work (Wang et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2016),
and compare these to BiDAF (Seo et al., 2017),
one of the best performing models for the SQuAD
dataset.

5.1 Random entity baseline
We developed the random entity baseline for the
Wikipedia domain since the provided documents
can be directly mapped to candidate answers. In
this heuristic approach, we first construct a candi-
date answer set using the entities associated with
the provided Wikipedia pages for a given question
(on average 1.8 per question). We then randomly
pick a candidate that does not occur in the ques-
tion. If no such candidate exists, we pick any ran-
dom candidate from the candidate set.

5.2 Entity classifier
We also frame the task as a ranking problem over
candidate answers in the documents. More for-
mally, given a question qi, an answer a+i , and a
evidence document Di, we want to learn a scoring
function score, such that

score(a+i |qi, Di) > score(a−i |qi, Di)

where a−i is any candidate other than the answer.
The function score is learnt using LambdaMART
(Wu et al., 2010),6 a boosted tree based ranking
algorithm.

This is similar to previous entity-centric classi-
fiers for QA (Chen et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2015),
and uses context and Wikipedia catalog based fea-
tures. To construct the candidate answer set, we

6We use the RankLib implementation https://
sourceforge.net/p/lemur/wiki/RankLib/

consider sentences that contain at least one word
in common with the question. We then add every
n-gram (n ∈ [1, 5]) that occurs in these sentences
and is a title of some Wikipedia article.7

5.3 Neural model

Recurrent neural network models (RNNs) (Her-
mann et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2016) have been
very effective for reading comprehension. For our
task, we modified the BiDAF model (Seo et al.,
2017), which takes a sequence of context words as
input and outputs the start and end positions of the
predicted answer in the context. The model uti-
lizes an RNN at the character level, token level,
and phrase level to encode context and question
and uses attention mechanism between question
and context.

Authored independently from the evidence doc-
ument, TriviaQA does not contain the exact spans
of the answers. We approximate the answer span
by finding the first match of answer string in
the evidence document. Developed for a dataset
where the evidence document is a single paragraph
(average 122 words), the BiDAF model does not
scale to long documents. To overcome this, we
truncate the evidence document to the first 800
words.8

When the data contains more than one evidence
document, as in our Wikipedia domain, we predict
for each document separately and aggregate the
predictions by taking a sum of confidence scores.
More specifically, when the model outputs a can-
didate answer Ai from n documents Di,1, ...Di,n
with confidences ci,1, ...ci,n, the score of Ai is
given by

score(Ai) =
∑

k

ci,k

We select candidate answer with the highest score.

6 Experiments

An evaluation of our baselines shows that both of
our tasks are challenging, and that the TriviaQA
dataset supports significant future work.

7Using a named entity recognition system to generate can-
didate entities is not feasible as answers can be common
nouns or phrases.

8We found that splitting documents into smaller sub doc-
uments degrades performance since a majority of sub docu-
ments do not contain the answer.

Wikipedia domain is evaluated over questions
while the web domain is evaluated over docu-
ments.

6.1 Evaluation Metrics

We use the same evaluation metrics as SQuAD –
exact match (EM) and F1 over words in the an-
swer(s). For questions that have Numerical and
FreeForm answers, we use a single given answer
as ground truth. For questions that have Wikipedia
entities as answers, we use Wikipedia aliases as
valid answer along with the given answer.

Since Wikipedia and the web are vastly differ-
ent in terms of style and content, we report per-
formance on each source separately. While us-
ing Wikipedia, we evaluate at the question level
since facts needed to answer a question are gen-
erally stated only once. On the other hand, due
to high information redundancy in web documents
(around 6 documents per question), we report doc-
ument level accuracy and F1 when evaluating on
web documents. Lastly, in addition to distant su-
pervision, we also report evaluation on the clean
dev and test questions collection using a human
annotator (section 4)

6.2 Experimental Setup

We randomly partition QA pairs in the dataset
into train (80%), development (10%), and test set
(10%). In addition to distant supervision evalua-
tion, we also evaluate baselines on verified subsets
(see section 4) of the dev and test partitions. Table
6 contains the number of questions and documents
for each task. We trained the entity classifier on a
random sample of 50,000 questions from the train-
ing set. For training BiDAF on the web domain,
we first randomly sampled 80,000 documents. For
both domains, we used only those (training) doc-
uments where the answer appears in the first 400
tokens to keep training time manageable. Design-
ing scalable techniques that can use the entirety of
the data is an interesting direction for future work.

6.3 Results
The performance of the proposed models is sum-
marized in Table 7. The poor performance of the
random entity baseline shows that the task is not
already solved by information retrieval. For both
Wikipedia and web documents, BiDAF (40%) out-
performs the classifier (23%). The oracle score
is the upper bound on the exact match accuracy.9

All models lag significantly behind the human
baseline of 79.7% on the Wikipedia domain, and
75.4% on the web domain.

We analyse the performance of BiDAF on the
development set using Wikipedia as the evidence
source by question length and answer type. The
accuracy of the system steadily decreased as the
length of the questions increased – with 50% for
questions with 5 or fewer words to 32% for 20 or
more words. This suggests that longer composi-
tional questions are harder for current methods.

6.4 Error analysis
Our qualitative error analysis reveals that compo-
sitionality in questions and lexical variation and
low signal-to-noise ratio in (full) documents is still
a challenge for current methods. We randomly
sampled 100 incorrect BiDAF predictions from
the development set and used Wikipedia evidence
documents for manual analysis. We found that 19
examples lacked evidence in any of the provided
documents, 3 had incorrect ground truth, and 3
were valid answers that were not included in the
answer key. Furthermore, 12 predictions were par-
tially correct (Napoleonic vs Napoleonic Wars).
This seems to be consistent with human perfor-
mance of 79.7%.

For the rest, we classified each example into one
or more categories listed in Table 8. Distractor en-
tities refers to the presence of entities similar to
ground truth. E.g., for the question, Rebecca Front
plays Detective Chief Superintendent Innocent in
which TV series?, the evidence describes all roles
played by Rebecca Front.

The first two rows suggest that long and noisy
documents make the question answering task
more difficult, as compared for example to the
short passages in SQuAD. Furthermore, a high
proportion of errors are caused by paraphrasing,
and the answer is sometimes stated indirectly. For

9A question q is considered answerable for the oracle
score if the correct answer is found in the evidence D or,
in case of the classifier, is a part of the candidate set. Since
we truncate documents, the upper bound is not 100%.

example, the evidence for the question What was
Truman Capote’s last name before he was adopted
by his stepfather? consists of the following text
Truman Garcia Capote born Truman Streckfus
Persons, was an American ... In 1933, he moved
to New York City to live with his mother and her
second husband, Joseph Capote, who adopted him
as his stepson and renamed him Truman Garca
Capote.

7 Related work

Recent interest in question answering has resulted
in the creation of several datasets. However, they
are either limited in scale or suffer from biases
stemming from their construction process. We
group existing datasets according to their associ-
ated tasks, and compare them against TriviaQA.
The analysis is summarized in Table 1.

7.1 Reading comprehension

Reading comprehension tasks aims to test the abil-
ity of a system to understand a document using
questions based upon its contents. Researchers
have constructed cloze-style datasets (Hill et al.,
2015; Hermann et al., 2015; Paperno et al., 2016;
Onishi et al., 2016), where the task is to pre-
dict missing words, often entities, in a docu-
ment. Cloze-style datasets, while easier to con-
struct large-scale automatically, do not contain
natural language questions.

Datasets with natural language questions in-
clude MCTest (Richardson et al., 2013), SQuAD
(Rajpurkar et al., 2016), and NewsQA (Trischler
et al., 2016). MCTest is limited in scale with
only 2640 multiple choice questions. SQuAD con-
tains 100K crowdsourced questions and answers
paired with short Wikipedia passages. NewsQA
uses crowdsourcing to create questions solely
from news article summaries in order to control
potential bias. The crucial difference between
SQuAD/NewsQA and TriviaQA is that TriviaQA
questions have not been crowdsourced from pre-
selected passages. Additionally, our evidence set
consists of web documents, while SQuAD and
NewsQA are limited to Wikipedia and news arti-
cles respectively. Other recently released datasets
include (Lai et al., 2017).

7.2 Open domain question answering
The recently released MS Marco dataset (Nguyen
et al., 2016) also contains independently authored
questions and documents drawn from the search
results. However, the questions in the dataset
are derived from search logs and the answers are
crowdsourced. On the other hand, trivia enthusi-
asts provided both questions and answers for our
dataset.

Knowledge base question answering involves
converting natural language questions to logical
forms that can be executed over a KB. Proposed
datasets (Cai and Yates, 2013; Berant et al., 2013;
Bordes et al., 2015) are either limited in scale or in
the complexity of questions, and can only retrieve
facts covered by the KB.

A standard task for open domain IR-style QA
is the annual TREC competitions (Voorhees and
Tice, 2000), which contains questions from var-
ious domains but is limited in size. Many ad-
vances from the TREC competitions were used in
the IBM Watson system for Jeopardy! (Ferrucci
et al., 2010). Other datasets includes SearchQA

1608



(Dunn et al., 2017) where Jeopardy! questions
are paired with search engine snippets, the Wik-
iQA dataset (Yang et al., 2015) for answer sen-
tence selection, and the Chinese language WebQA
(Li et al., 2016) dataset, which focuses on the task
of answer phrase extraction. TriviaQA contains
examples that could be used for both stages of the
pipeline, although our focus on this paper is in-
stead on using the data for reading comprehension
where the answer is always present.

Other recent approaches attempt to combine
structured high precision KBs with semi-
structured information sources like OpenIE
triples (Fader et al., 2014), HTML tables
(Pasupat and Liang, 2015), and large (and noisy)
corpora (Sawant and Chakrabarti, 2013; Joshi
et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2015). TriviaQA, which has
Wikipedia entities as answers, makes it possible
to leverage structured KBs like Freebase, which
we leave to future work. Furthermore, about 7%
of the TriviaQA questions have answers in HTML
tables and lists, which could be used to augment
these existing resources.

Trivia questions from quiz bowl have been pre-
viously used in other question answering tasks
(Boyd-Graber et al., 2012). Quiz bowl questions
are paragraph length and pyramidal.10 A num-
ber of different aspects of this problem have been
carefully studied, typically using classifiers over
a pre-defined set of answers (Iyyer et al., 2014)
and studying incremental answering to answer as
quickly as possible (Boyd-Graber et al., 2012) or
using reinforcement learning to model opponent
behavior (He et al., 2016). These competitive chal-
lenges are not present in our single-sentence ques-
tion setting. Developing joint models for multi-
sentence reasoning for questions and answer doc-
uments is an important area for future work.

8 Conclusion and Future Work

We present TriviaQA, a new dataset of 650K
question-document-evidence triples. To our
knowledge, TriviaQA is the first dataset where
questions are authored by trivia enthusiasts, inde-
pendently of the evidence documents. The evi-
dence documents come from two domains – Web
search results and Wikipedia pages – with highly
differing levels of information redundancy. Re-
sults from current state-of-the-art baselines indi-

10Pyramidal questions consist of a series of clues about the
answer arranged in order from most to least difficult.

cate that TriviaQA is a challenging testbed that de-
serves significant future study.

While not the focus of this paper, TriviaQA also
provides a provides a benchmark for a variety of
other tasks such as IR-style question answering,
QA over structured KBs and joint modeling of
KBs and text, with much more data than previ-
ously available.
