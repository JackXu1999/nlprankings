Abstract

An effective method to improve neural ma-
chine translation with monolingual data is
to augment the parallel training corpus with
back-translations of target language sentences.
This work broadens the understanding of
back-translation and investigates a number
of methods to generate synthetic source sen-
tences. We find that in all but resource poor
settings back-translations obtained via sam-
pling or noised beam outputs are most effec-
tive. Our analysis shows that sampling or
noisy synthetic data gives a much stronger
training signal than data generated by beam or
greedy search. We also compare how synthetic
data compares to genuine bitext and study var-
ious domain effects. Finally, we scale to hun-
dreds of millions of monolingual sentences
and achieve a new state of the art of 35 BLEU
on the WMT’14 English-German test set.

1 Introduction

Machine translation relies on the statistics of large
parallel corpora, i.e. datasets of paired sentences
in both the source and target language. However,
bitext is limited and there is a much larger amount
of monolingual data available. Monolingual data
has been traditionally used to train language mod-
els which improved the fluency of statistical ma-
chine translation (Koehn, 2010).

In the context of neural machine translation
(NMT; Bahdanau et al. 2015; Gehring et al. 2017;
Vaswani et al. 2017), there has been extensive
work to improve models with monolingual data,
including language model fusion (Gulcehre et al.,
2015, 2017), back-translation (Sennrich et al.,
2016a) and dual learning (Cheng et al., 2016; He
et al., 2016a). These methods have different ad-
vantages and can be combined to reach high accu-
racy (Hassan et al., 2018).

*Work done while at Facebook AI Research.

We focus on back-translation (BT) which oper-
ates in a semi-supervised setup where both bilin-
gual and monolingual data in the target language
are available. Back-translation first trains an inter-
mediate system on the parallel data which is used
to translate the target monolingual data into the
source language. The result is a parallel corpus
where the source side is synthetic machine transla-
tion output while the target is genuine text written
by humans. The synthetic parallel corpus is then
simply added to the real bitext in order to train a fi-
nal system that will translate from the source to the
target language. Although simple, this method has
been shown to be helpful for phrase-based transla-
tion (Bojar and Tamchyna, 2011), NMT (Sennrich
et al., 2016a; Poncelas et al., 2018) as well as un-
supervised MT (Lample et al., 2018a).

In this paper, we investigate back-translation
for neural machine translation at a large scale
by adding hundreds of millions of back-translated
sentences to the bitext. Our experiments are based
on strong baseline models trained on the public bi-
text of the WMT competition. We extend previous
analysis (Sennrich et al., 2016a; Poncelas et al.,
2018) of back-translation in several ways. We pro-
vide a comprehensive analysis of different meth-
ods to generate synthetic source sentences and we
show that this choice matters: sampling from the
model distribution or noising beam outputs out-
performs pure beam search, which is typically
used, by 1.7 BLEU on average across several test
sets. Our analysis shows that synthetic data based
on sampling and noised beam search provides a
stronger training signal than synthetic data based
on argmax inference. We also study how adding
synthetic data compares to adding real bitext in
a controlled setup with the surprising finding that
synthetic data can sometimes match the accuracy
of real bitext. Our best setup achieves 35 BLEU
on the WMT’14 English-German test set by rely-



490

ing only on public WMT bitext as well as 226M
monolingual sentences. This outperforms the sys-
tem of DeepL by 1.7 BLEU who train on large
amounts of high quality non-benchmark data. On
WMT’14 English-French we achieve 45.6 BLEU.

This section describes prior work in machine
translation with neural networks as well as semi-
supervised machine translation.

2.1 Neural machine translation

We build upon recent work on neural machine
translation which is typically a neural network
with an encoder/decoder architecture. The en-
coder infers a continuous space representation of
the source sentence, while the decoder is a neural
language model conditioned on the encoder out-
put. The parameters of both models are learned
jointly to maximize the likelihood of the target
sentences given the corresponding source sen-
tences from a parallel corpus (Sutskever et al.,
2014; Cho et al., 2014). At inference, a target sen-
tence is generated by left-to-right decoding.

Different neural architectures have been pro-
posed with the goal of improving efficiency
and/or effectiveness. This includes recurrent net-
works (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al.,
2015; Luong et al., 2015), convolutional net-
works (Kalchbrenner et al., 2016; Gehring et al.,
2017; Kaiser et al., 2017) and transformer net-
works (Vaswani et al., 2017). Recent work re-
lies on attention mechanisms where the encoder
produces a sequence of vectors and, for each
target token, the decoder attends to the most
relevant part of the source through a context-
dependent weighted-sum of the encoder vec-
tors (Bahdanau et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015).
Attention has been refined with multi-hop atten-
tion (Gehring et al., 2017), self-attention (Vaswani
et al., 2017; Paulus et al., 2018) and multi-head
attention (Vaswani et al., 2017). We use a trans-
former architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017).

2.2 Semi-supervised NMT

Monolingual target data has been used to improve
the fluency of machine translations since the early
IBM models (Brown et al., 1990). In phrase-based
systems, language models (LM) in the target lan-
guage increase the score of fluent outputs during
decoding (Koehn et al., 2003; Brants et al., 2007).

A similar strategy can be applied to NMT (He
et al., 2016b). Besides improving accuracy during
decoding, neural LM and NMT can benefit from
deeper integration, e.g. by combining the hid-
den states of both models (Gulcehre et al., 2017).
Neural architecture also allows multi-task learning
and parameter sharing between MT and target-side
LM (Domhan and Hieber, 2017).

Back-translation (BT) is an alternative to lever-
age monolingual data. BT is simple and easy to
apply as it does not require modification to the MT
training algorithms. It requires training a target-
to-source system in order to generate additional
synthetic parallel data from the monolingual tar-
get data. This data complements human bitext to
train the desired source-to-target system. BT has
been applied earlier to phrase-base systems (Bo-
jar and Tamchyna, 2011). For these systems, BT
has also been successful in leveraging monolin-
gual data for domain adaptation (Bertoldi and Fed-
erico, 2009; Lambert et al., 2011). Recently, BT
has been shown beneficial for NMT (Sennrich
et al., 2016a; Poncelas et al., 2018). It has been
found to be particularly useful when parallel data
is scarce (Karakanta et al., 2017).

Currey et al. (2017) show that low resource
language pairs can also be improved with syn-
thetic data where the source is simply a copy of
the monolingual target data. Concurrently to our
work, Imamura et al. (2018) show that sampling
synthetic sources is more effective than beam
search. Specifically, they sample multiple sources
for each target whereas we draw only a single sam-
ple, opting to train on a larger number of target
sentences instead. Hoang et al. (2018) and Cot-
terell and Kreutzer (2018) suggest an iterative pro-
cedure which continuously improves the quality of
the back-translation and final systems. Niu et al.
(2018) experiment with a multilingual model that
does both the forward and backward translation
which is continuously trained with new synthetic
data.

There has also been work using source-side
monolingual data (Zhang and Zong, 2016). Fur-
thermore, Cheng et al. (2016); He et al. (2016a);
Xia et al. (2017) show how monolingual text from
both languages can be leveraged by extending
back-translation to dual learning: when training
both source-to-target and target-to-source models
jointly, one can use back-translation in both direc-
tions and perform multiple rounds of BT. A simi-



491

lar idea is applied in unsupervised NMT (Lample
et al., 2018a,b). Besides monolingual data, var-
ious approaches have been introduced to benefit
from parallel data in other language pairs (Johnson
et al., 2017; Firat et al., 2016a,b; Ha et al., 2016;
Gu et al., 2018).

Data augmentation is an established technique
in computer vision where a labeled dataset is sup-
plemented with cropped or rotated input images.
Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs)
have been successfully used to the same end (An-
toniou et al., 2017; Perez and Wang, 2017) as well
as models that learn distributions over image trans-
formations (Hauberg et al., 2016).

3 Generating synthetic sources

Back-translation typically uses beam search (Sen-
nrich et al., 2016a) or just greedy search (Lample
et al., 2018a,b) to generate synthetic source sen-
tences. Both are approximate algorithms to iden-
tify the maximum a-posteriori (MAP) output, i.e.
the sentence with the largest estimated probabil-
ity given an input. Beam is generally successful in
finding high probability outputs (Ott et al., 2018a).

However, MAP prediction can lead to less rich
translations (Ott et al., 2018a) since it always fa-
vors the most likely alternative in case of ambigu-
ity. This is particularly problematic in tasks where
there is a high level of uncertainty such as dia-
log (Serban et al., 2016) and story generation (Fan
et al., 2018). We argue that this is also problem-
atic for a data augmentation scheme such as back-
translation. Beam and greedy focus on the head of
the model distribution which results in very regu-
lar synthetic source sentences that do not properly
cover the true data distribution.

As alternative, we consider sampling from the
model distribution as well as adding noise to beam
search outputs. First, we explore unrestricted sam-
pling which generates outputs that are very di-
verse but sometimes highly unlikely. Second,
we investigate sampling restricted to the most
likely words (Graves, 2013; Ott et al., 2018a; Fan
et al., 2018). At each time step, we select the k
most likely tokens from the output distribution, re-
normalize and then sample from this restricted set.
This is a middle ground between MAP and unre-
stricted sampling.

As a third alternative, we apply noising Lam-
ple et al. (2018a) to beam search outputs. Adding
noise to input sentences has been very benefi-

cial for the autoencoder setups of (Lample et al.,
2018a; Hill et al., 2016) which is inspired by de-
noising autoencoders (Vincent et al., 2008). In
particular, we transform source sentences with
three types of noise: deleting words with proba-
bility 0.1, replacing words by a filler token with
probability 0.1, and swapping words which is im-
plemented as a random permutation over the to-
kens, drawn from the uniform distribution but re-
stricted to swapping words no further than three
positions apart.

4 Experimental setup

4.1 Datasets
The majority of our experiments are based on data
from the WMT’18 English-German news transla-
tion task. We train on all available bitext exclud-
ing the ParaCrawl corpus and remove sentences
longer than 250 words as well as sentence-pairs
with a source/target length ratio exceeding 1.5.
This results in 5.18M sentence pairs. For the back-
translation experiments we use the German mono-
lingual newscrawl data distributed with WMT’18
comprising 226M sentences after removing dupli-
cates. We tokenize all data with the Moses tok-
enizer (Koehn et al., 2007) and learn a joint source
and target Byte-Pair-Encoding (BPE; Sennrich et
al., 2016) with 35K types. We develop on new-
stest2012 and report final results on newstest2013-
2017; additionally we consider a held-out set from
the training data of 52K sentence-pairs.

We also experiment on the larger WMT’14
English-French task which we filter in the same
way as WMT’18 English-German. This results in
35.7M sentence-pairs for training and we learn a
joint BPE vocabulary of 44K types. As monolin-
gual data we use newscrawl2010-2014, compris-
ing 31M sentences after language identification
(Lui and Baldwin, 2012). We use newstest2012
as development set and report final results on
newstest2013-2015.

The majority of results in this paper are in terms
of case-sensitive tokenized BLEU (Papineni et al.,
2002) but we also report test accuracy with de-
tokenized BLEU using sacreBLEU (Post, 2018).

4.2 Model and hyperparameters
We re-implemented the Transformer model in py-
torch using the fairseq toolkit.1 All experiments

are based on the Big Transformer architecture with
6 blocks in the encoder and decoder. We use the
same hyper-parameters for all experiments, i.e.,
word representations of size 1024, feed-forward
layers with inner dimension 4096. Dropout is set
to 0.3 for En-De and 0.1 for En-Fr, we use 16 at-
tention heads, and we average the checkpoints of
the last ten epochs. Models are optimized with
Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2015) using β1 = 0.9,
β2 = 0.98, and � = 1e − 8 and we use the same
learning rate schedule as Vaswani et al. (2017). All
models use label smoothing with a uniform prior
distribution over the vocabulary � = 0.1 (Szegedy
et al., 2015; Pereyra et al., 2017). We run exper-
iments on DGX-1 machines with 8 Nvidia V100
GPUs and machines are interconnected by Infini-
band. Experiments are run on 16 machines and
we perform 30K synchronous updates. We also
use the NCCL2 library and the torch distributed
package for inter-GPU communication. We train
models with 16-bit floating point operations, fol-
lowing Ott et al. (2018b). For final evaluation,
we generate translations with a beam of size 5 and
with no length penalty.

5 Results

Our evaluation first compares the accuracy of
back-translation generation methods (§5.1) and
analyzes the results (§5.2). Next, we simulate a
low-resource setup to experiment further with dif-
ferent generation methods (§5.3). We also com-
pare synthetic bitext to genuine parallel data and
examine domain effects arising in back-translation
(§5.4). We also measure the effect of upsampling
bitext during training (§5.5). Finally, we scale to a
very large setup of up to 226M monolingual sen-
tences and compare to previous research (§5.6).

5.1 Synthetic data generation methods

We first investigate different methods to gener-
ate synthetic source translations given a back-
translation model, i.e., a model trained in the
reverse language direction (Section 5.1). We
consider two types of MAP prediction: greedy
search (greedy) and beam search with beam size 5
(beam). Non-MAP methods include unrestricted
sampling from the model distribution (sampling),
restricting sampling to the k highest scoring out-
puts at every time step with k = 10 (top10) as well
as adding noise to the beam outputs (beam+noise).
Restricted sampling is a middle-ground between

beam search and unrestricted sampling, it is less
likely to pick very low scoring outputs but still
preserves some randomness. Preliminary experi-
ments with top5, top20, top50 gave similar results
to top10.

We also vary the amount of synthetic data and
perform 30K updates during training for the bi-
text only, 50K updates when adding 3M synthetic
sentences, 75K updates for 6M and 12M sen-
tences and 100K updates for 24M sentences. For
each setting, this corresponds to enough updates to
reach convergence in terms of held-out loss. In our
128 GPU setup, training of the final models takes
3h 20min for the bitext only model, 7h 30min for
6M and 12M synthetic sentences, and 10h 15min
for 24M sentences. During training we also sam-
ple the bitext more frequently than the synthetic
data and we analyze the effect of this in more de-
tail in §5.5.

Figure 1 shows that sampling and beam+noise
outperform the MAP methods (pure beam search
and greedy) by 0.8-1.1 BLEU. Sampling and
beam+noise improve over bitext-only (5M) by be-
tween 1.7-2 BLEU in the largest data setting.
Restricted sampling (top10) performs better than
beam and greedy but is not as effective as unre-
stricted sampling (sampling) or beam+noise.

test sets (newstest2013-2017). Sampling and
beam+noise perform roughly equal and we adopt
sampling for the remaining experiments.

5.2 Analysis of generation methods

The previous experiment showed that synthetic
source sentences generated via sampling and beam
with noise perform significantly better than those
obtained by pure MAP methods. Why is this?

Beam search focuses on very likely outputs
which reduces the diversity and richness of the
generated source translations. Adding noise to
beam outputs and sampling do not have this prob-
lem: Noisy source sentences make it harder to pre-
dict the target translations which may help learn-
ing, similar to denoising autoencoders (Vincent
et al., 2008). Sampling is known to better approx-
imate the data distribution which is richer than the
argmax model outputs (Ott et al., 2018a). There-

erated by beam search is most predictable.

fore, sampling is also more likely to provide a
richer training signal than argmax sequences.

To get a better sense of the training signal pro-
vided by each method, we compare the loss on
the training data for each method. We report the
cross entropy loss averaged over all tokens and
separate the loss over the synthetic data and the
real bitext data. Specifically, we choose the setup
with 24M synthetic sentences. At the end of each
epoch we measure the loss over 500K sentence
pairs sub-sampled from the synthetic data as well
as an equally sized subset of the bitext. For each
generation method we choose the same sentences
except for the bitext which is disjoint from the syn-
thetic data. This means that losses over the syn-
thetic data are measured over the same target to-
kens because the generation methods only differ
in the source sentences. We found it helpful to up-
sample the frequency with which we observe the
bitext compared to the synthetic data (§5.5) but we
do not upsample for this experiment to keep condi-
tions as similar as possible. We assume that when
the training loss is low, then the model can easily
fit the training data without extracting much learn-
ing signal compared to data which is harder to fit.

greedy or beam is much easier to fit compared to
data from sampling, top10, beam+noise and the
bitext. In fact, the perplexity on beam data falls
below 2 after only 5 epochs. Except for sampling,
we find that the perplexity on the training data is
somewhat correlated to the end-model accuracy
(cf. Figure 1) and that all methods except sam-
pling have a lower loss than real bitext.

These results suggest that synthetic data ob-
tained with argmax inference does not provide
as rich a training signal as sampling or adding
noise. We conjecture that the regularity of syn-
thetic data obtained with argmax inference is not
optimal. Sampling and noised argmax both expose
the model to a wider range of source sentences
which makes the model more robust to reorder-
ing and substitutions that happen naturally, even if
the model of reordering and substitution through
noising is not very realistic.

Next we analyze the richness of synthetic out-
puts and train a language model on real human text
and score synthetic source sentences generated by
beam search, sampling, top10 and beam+noise.
We hypothesize that data that is very regular
should be more predictable by the language model
and therefore receive low perplexity. We elimi-
nate a possible domain mismatch effect between
the language model training data and the synthetic
data by splitting the parallel corpus into three non-
overlapping parts:

1. On 640K sentences pairs, we train a back-
translation model,

2. On 4.1M sentence pairs, we take the source
side and train a 5-gram Kneser-Ney language
model (Heafield et al., 2013),

3. On the remaining 450K sentences, we apply
the back-translation system using beam, sam-
pling and top10 generation.

For the last set, we have genuine source sen-
tences as well as synthetic sources from different
generation techniques. We report the perplexity of
our language model on all versions of the source
data in Table 2. The results show that beam out-
puts receive higher probability by the language
model compared to sampling, beam+noise and
real source sentences. This indicates that beam
search outputs are not as rich as sampling outputs
or beam+noise. This lack of variability probably
explains in part why back-translations from pure
beam search provide a weaker training signal than
alternatives.

Closer inspection of the synthetic sources (Ta-
ble 3) reveals that sampled and noised beam out-
puts are sometimes not very adequate, much more
so than MAP outputs, e.g., sampling often in-
troduces target words which have no counterpart
in the source. This happens because sampling
sometimes picks highly unlikely outputs which are
harder to fit (cf. Figure 2).

5.3 Low resource vs. high resource setup
The experiments so far are based on a setup with a
large bilingual corpus. However, in resource poor
settings the back-translation model is of much
lower quality. Are non-MAP methods still more
effective in such a setup? To answer this ques-
tion, we simulate such setups by sub-sampling
the training data to either 80K sentence-pairs or
640K sentence-pairs and then add synthetic data
from sampling and beam search. We compare
these smaller setups to our original 5.2M sen-
tence bitext configuration. The accuracy of the

German-English back-translation systems steadily
increases with more training data: On new-
stest2012 we measure 13.5 BLEU for 80K bitext,
24.3 BLEU for 640K and 28.3 BLEU for 5M.

Figure 3 shows that sampling is more effective
than beam for larger setups (640K and 5.2M bi-
texts) while the opposite is true for resource poor
settings (80K bitext). This is likely because the
back-translations in the 80K setup are of very poor
quality and the noise of sampling and beam+noise
is too detrimental for this brittle low-resource set-
ting. When the setup is very small the very regu-
lar MAP outputs still provide useful training signal
while the noise from sampling becomes harmful.

5.4 Domain of synthetic data

Next, we turn to two different questions: How
does real human bitext compare to synthetic data
in terms of final model accuracy? And how does
the domain of the monolingual data affect results?

To answer these questions, we subsample 640K
sentence-pairs of the bitext and train a back-
translation system on this set. To train a forward
model, we consider three alternative types of data
to add to this 640K training set. We either add:

• the remaining parallel data (bitext),

• the back-translated target side of the remain-
ing parallel data (BT-bitext),

• back-translated newscrawl data (BT-news).

The back-translated data is generated via sam-
pling. This setup allows us to compare synthetic
data to genuine data since BT-bitext and bitext
share the same target side. It also allows us to
estimate the value of BT data for domain adap-
tation since the newscrawl corpus (BT-news) is
pure news whereas the bitext is a mixture of eu-
roparl and commoncrawl with only a small news-
commentary portion. To assess domain adaptation
effects, we measure accuracy on two held-out sets:

• newstest2012, i.e. pure newswire data.

• a held-out set of the WMT training data
(valid-mixed), which is a mixture of eu-
roparl, commoncrawl and the small news-
commentary portion.

Figure 4 shows the results on both validation
sets. Most strikingly, BT-news performs almost
as well as bitext on newstest2012 (Figure 4a) and
improves the baseline (640K) by 2.6 BLEU. BT-
bitext improves by 2.2 BLEU, achieving 83% of
the improvement with real bitext. This shows that
synthetic data can be nearly as effective as real hu-
man translated data when the domains match.

Figure 4b shows the accuracy on valid-mixed,
the mixed domain valid set. The accuracy of BT-
news is not as good as before since the domain of
the BT data and the test set do not match. How-
ever, BT-news still improves the baseline by up to
1.2 BLEU. On the other hand, BT-bitext matches
the domain of valid-mixed and improves by 2.7
BLEU. This trails the real bitext by only 1.3 BLEU
and corresponds to 67% of the gain achieved with
real human bitext.

In summary, synthetic data performs remark-
ably well, coming close to the improvements
achieved with real bitext for newswire test data,
or trailing real bitext by only 1.3 BLEU for valid-
mixed. In absence of a large parallel corpus for
news, back-translation therefore offers a simple,
yet very effective domain adaptation technique.

5.5 Upsampling the bitext

We found it beneficial to adjust the ratio of bitext
to synthetic data observed during training. In par-
ticular, we tuned the rate at which we sample data
from the bitext compared to synthetic data. For
example, in a setup of 5M bitext sentences and
10M synthetic sentences, an upsampling rate of 2
means that we double the frequency at which we

visit bitext, i.e. training batches contain on aver-
age an equal amount of bitext and synthetic data
as opposed to 1/3 bitext and 2/3 synthetic data.

Figure 5 shows the accuracy of various upsam-
pling rates for different generation methods in a
setup with 5M bitext sentences and 24M synthetic
sentences. Beam and greedy benefit a lot from
higher rates which results in training more on the
bitext data. This is likely because synthetic beam
and greedy data does not provide as much training
signal as the bitext which has more variation and
is harder to fit. On the other hand, sampling and
beam+noise require no upsampling of the bitext,
which is likely because the synthetic data is al-
ready hard enough to fit and thus provides a strong
training signal (§5.2).

5.6 Large scale results

To confirm our findings we experiment on
WMT’14 English-French translation where we
show results on newstest2013-2015. We augment
the large bitext of 35.7M sentence pairs by 31M
newscrawl sentences generated by sampling. To
train this system we perform 300K training up-
dates in 27h 40min on 128 GPUs; we do not up-
sample the bitext for this experiment. Table 4
shows tokenized BLEU and Table 5 shows deto-
kenized BLEU.2 To our knowledge, our baseline

is the best reported result in the literature for new-
stest2014, and back-translation further improves
upon this by 2.6 BLEU (tokenized).

Finally, for WMT English-German we train
on all 226M available monolingual training sen-
tences and perform 250K updates in 22.5 hours
on 128 GPUs. We upsample the bitext with a
rate of 16 so that we observe every bitext sentence

35 BLEU on newstest2014 by using only WMT
benchmark data. For comparison, DeepL, a com-
mercial translation engine relying on high qual-
ity bilingual training data, achieves 33.3 tokenized
BLEU .4 Table 6 summarizes our results and com-
pares to other work in the literature. This shows
that back-translation with sampling can result in
high-quality translation models based on bench-
mark data only.

6 Conclusions and future work

Back-translation is a very effective data augmen-
tation technique for neural machine translation.
Generating synthetic sources by sampling or by
adding noise to beam outputs leads to higher ac-
curacy than argmax inference which is typically
used. In particular, sampling and noised beam
outperforms pure beam by 1.7 BLEU on average
on newstest2013-2017 for WMT English-German
translation. Both methods provide a richer train-
ing signal for all but resource poor setups. We
also find that synthetic data can achieve up to 83%
of the performance attainable with real bitext. Fi-
nally, we achieve a new state of the art result of 35
BLEU on the WMT’14 English-German test set
by using publicly available benchmark data only.

In future work, we would like to investigate
an end-to-end approach where the back-translation
model is optimized to output synthetic sources that
are most helpful to the final forward model.
