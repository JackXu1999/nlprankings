ABSTRACT

In recent years, social media has become a customer touch-point for the business functions
of marketing, sales and customer service. We aim to show that intention analysis might be
useful to these business functions and that it can be performed effectively on short texts (at
the granularity level of a single sentence). We demonstrate a scheme of categorization of
intentions that is amenable to automation using simple machine learning techniques that are
language-independent. We discuss the grounding that this scheme of categorization has in
speech act theory. In the demonstration we go over a number of usage scenarios in an attempt
to show that the use of automatic intention detection tools would benefit the business functions
of sales, marketing and service. We also show that social media can be used not just to convey
pleasure or displeasure (that is, to express sentiment) but also to discuss personal needs and to
report problems (to express intentions). We evaluate methods for automatically discovering
intentions in text, and establish that it is possible to perform intention analysis on social media
with an accuracy of 66.97%± 0.10%.

KEYWORDS: intention analysis, intent analysis, social media, speech act theory, sentiment
analysis, emotion analysis, intention.

1 Introduction

In this paper and the accompanying demonstration, we present and attempt to demonstrate
the effectiveness of a method of categorization of intentions that is based on the needs of
the marketing, sales and service functions of a business which are, according to Smith et al.
(2011), the functions most impacted by social media. The categories of intention that we use
are purchase, inquire, complain, criticise, praise, direct, quit, compare, wish and sell. We also use
an other category consisting of sentences that do not express intentions.

In the demonstration, we show that the intention categories purchase, sell and wish are valuable
to sales, that the inquire category can be used for outbound marketing, that criticise, compare
and praise can be used for inbound marketing, and that complain, direct and quit can be used
for customer service.

This does not mean that these categories are only of use to business. The intention to complain
and the intention to quit have been studied extensively by Hirschman (1970) in the context of
a wide range of social, political and economic phenomena. A game theoretic framework for
the work of Hirschman (1970) has been proposed by Gehlbach (2006) and used to model the
mechanism of collapse of communism in East Germany.

In Section 2 we describe the theoretical underpinnings of the present work and in Section 3 we
go over related research. In Section 4 we discuss the quantity of social media messages that
contain the categories of intentions that are the subject of the present study (we compare the
quantities of intentions expressed with the quantities of expressions of sentiment). In Section 5
we describe and evaluate machine learning algorithms for automated intention analysis.

2 Background

2.1 Speech Act Theory

Austin (1975), in the theory of speech acts, distinguished between utterances that are statements
(whose truth or falsity is verifiable) and utterances that are not statements. He observed that,
“there are, traditionally, besides (grammarians’) statements, also questions and exclamations,
and sentences expressing commands or wishes or concessions.”

In our work we deal with certain types of speech acts that can be called ‘intentions’ according
to one common dictionary definition of the word ‘intention’, which is, “an aim or plan”. In
particular, we focus on the ten categories of intention (excluding other) in Table 1.

Another concept from speech act theory (Searle, 1983) is the ‘direction of fit’ of a speech act or
intentional state. The direction of fit is said to be ‘mind-to-world’ if through the performance of
the speech act, a mental state is established, revealed or altered. The direction of fit of a speech
act or intentional state is said to be ‘world-to-mind’ if the performance of the speech act alters
the state of the world.

Seven of the ten categories of intentions in our annotation scheme have the world-to-mind
direction of fit (they are desires or intentions) and three have the mind-to-world direction of
fit (beliefs). The three categories that have the mind-to-world direction of fit correspond to
categories used in opinion mining (namely ‘praise’, ‘criticize’ and ‘compare’).

2.2 Discourse Theory

In the introducton to the collection “Intentions in Communication” Cohen et al. (1990) suggest
that any theory that purports to explain communication and discourse “will have to place a
strong emphasis on issues of intention”. To illustrate the point, they offer a sample dialog
between a customer looking for some meat and a butcher selling the same:

• Customer: “Where are the chuck steaks you advertised for 88 cents per pound?”
• Butcher: “How many do you want?”

The butcher’s response would be perfectly natural in a scenario where the steaks are behind the
counter where customers are not allowed, and the plausibility of this conversation shows that
people infer intention, just as the butcher infers the intention of the customer to be a purchase
intention (in this case, possibly as much from the context as from the language).

Georgeff et al. (1999) discuss the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) Model of Agency based on the
work of Bratman (1987). In the present work, the term “intentions” loosely corresponds to the
sense of “desire” as well as “intention” in the BDI model.

3 Related Research

3.1 Wishes in Reviews and Discussions

Goldberg et al. (2009) developed a corpus of wishes from a set of New Year’s Day wishes and
through evaluation of learning algorithms for the domains ‘products’ and ‘politics’, showed that
even though the content of wishes might be domain-specific, the manner in which wishes are
expressed is not entirely so. The definition of the word ‘wish’ used by Goldberg et al. (2009) is
“a desire or hope for something to happen”.

The wish to purchase and the wish to suggest improvements are studied in Ramanand et al.
(2010). Ramanand et al. (2010) propose rules for identifying both kinds of wishes and test
the collection of rules using a corpus that includes product reviews, customer surveys and
comments from consumer forums. In addition, they evaluate their system on the WISH corpus
of Goldberg et al. (2009). Wu and He (2011) also study the wish to suggest and the wish to
purchase using variants of Class Sequential Rules (CSRs).

3.2 Requests and Promises in Email

Lampert et al. (2010) study the identification of requests in email messages and obtain an
accuracy of 83.76%. A study of email communications by Carvalho and Cohen (2006) and
Cohen et al. (2004) focuses on discovering speech acts in email, building upon earlier work on
illocutionary speech acts (Searle, 1975; Winograd, 1987).

3.3 Speech Acts in Conversations

Bouchet (2009) describes the construction of a corpus of user requests for assistance, annotated
with the illocutionary speech acts assertive, commissive, directive, expressive, declarative, and an
other category for utterances that cannot be classified into one of those. Ravi and Kim (2007) use
rules to identify threads that may have unanswered questions and therefore require instructor
attention. In their approach, each message is classified as a question, answer, elaboration and
correction.

3.4 Sentiment and Emotion

Three of the intentions in the present study, namely the intention to praise something, to criticize
something, and to compare something with something else, have been studied by researchers in
connection with sentiment analysis.

The detection of comparisons in text has been studied by Jindal and Liu (2006), and the use of
comparative sentences in opinion mining has been studied by Ganapathibhotla and Liu (2008).
Yang and Ko (2011) proposed a method to automatically identify 7 categories of comparatives
in Korean. Li et al. (2010) used a weakly supervised method to identify comparative questions
from a large online question archive. Different perspectives might be reflected in contrastive
opinions, and these are studied by Fang et al. (2012) in the context of political texts using the
Cross-Perspective Topic model.

The mining of opinion features and the creation of review summaries is studied in Hu and Liu
(2006, 2004). A study of sentiment classification is reported in Pang et al. (2002), and the use
of subjectivity detection in sentiment classification is reported in Pang and Lee (2004).

Studies to detect emotions in internet chat conversations have been described in Wu et al.
(2002); Holzman and Pottenger (2003); Shashank and Bhattacharyya (2010). Minato et al.
(2008) describe the creation of an emotions corpus in the Japanese language. Vidrascu and
Devillers (2005) attempt to detect emotions in speech data from call center recordings.

4 Distribution of Intentions

Table 1 lists the categories of intentions that are the subject of the present study, their mapping
to concepts from speech act theory, namely direction of fit, intentional state (desire/belief) and
illocutionary point, and their counts in a corpus of sentences from social media.

Intention Direction of fit Des/Bel Illocution Business Fn Count
wish mind-to-world desire directive marketing 543
purchase mind-to-world desire directive sales 2221
inquire mind-to-world desire directive marketing 2972
compare world-to-mind belief representative research 508
praise world-to-mind belief representative research 1574
criticize world-to-mind belief representative research 2031
complain mind-to-world desire representative service 2107
quit mind-to-world desire commissive service 744
direct mind-to-world desire directive service 706
sell mind-to-world desire directive procurement 524
other 2775

Table 1: Categories annotated in the corpus.

Only 4113 sentences belonged to categories related to opinion (praise, criticize and compare),
demonstrating that other speech acts are prevalent on social media in certain contexts.

5 Experimental Evaluation

A set of experiments was performed using naive bayes classification, maximum entropy classifi-
cation, and support vector machine classification to see if intention analysis could be automated,
and to see what features might be used to tell categories of intentions apart.

36



5.1 Corpus Slices

The experiments were performed using three slices of categories from the corpus. The first slice
(Slice 1) consisted of the categories purchase, inquire, complain, criticize, praise and other, (6
categories) all of which number greater than 1500 in the corpus. The second slice (Slice 2)
consisted of direct and quit (both of which have more than 700 each in the corpus) in addition
to the above categories, for a total of 8 categories. The last slice (Slice 3) consisted of sell,
compare and wish (which have more than 500 occurrences each in the corpus) in addition to
the 8 categories mentioned above, for a total of 11 categories.

5.2 Automatic Classification

Naive bayesian (NB) classifiers, maximum entropy (ME) classifiers, and support vector machine
(SVM) classifiers were evaluated on the corpus of intentions. The features used were n-grams
(all n-grams containing keywords used to crawl the social media text were discarded).

Features NB ME SVM (RBF)
unigrams 60.97± 0.01 68.24± 0.02 68.96± 0.02
bigrams 60.07± 0.02 65.38± 0.01 65.19± 0.01

Accuracy scores for Slices 1, 2 and 3 are listed in Table 2, Table 3 and Table 4 and Table 5.

6 Demonstration

We will demonstrate the use of intention analysis in a number of usage scenarios to establish its
value to sales, marketing and customer service.

6.1 Identifying Leads for Sales

The ability to find customers who have a need for a particular product or service is valuable
to the sales function of a business. We demonstrate how customers who wish to buy certain
products may be identified by monitoring conversations on social media.

6.2 Identifying Needs for Marketing

Marketing can use inquiries on social media to identify interested persons and educate them
about pertinent offerings. Political teams can use inquiries to educate voters. They can also
use intentions expressed on social media to identify needs and wants. In this segment of the
demonstration, we show how inquiries about a product or service, and expressions of interest
may be detected.

6.3 Identifying Issues for Customer Service

Customer service might be able to better respond to criticism and complaints if it can spot
customers who are dissatisfied or have problems. In this segment of the demonstration, we
show how complaints and criticism of a product or a service may be detected.

7 Conclusion

In this study, we have proposed a way of categorizing text in terms of the intentions expressed.
We have argued that such a set of categories might be useful to numerous business functions.
We have shown that these categories are encountered frequently on social media, and demon-
strated the value of using intention analysis in marketing, sales and customer service scenarios.
Furthermore, we have shown that it is possible to achieve an accuracy of 66.97%± 0.10% at
the task of classifying sentence-length texts into the intention categories described in this paper.
