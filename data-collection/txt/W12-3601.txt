Abstract

As NLP confronts the challenge of Big Data for natural language text, the role played by linguis-
tically annotated data in training machine learning algorithms is reaching a critical question. Namely,
what role can annotated corpora play for supervised learning algorithms when the datasets become
significantly outsized, compared to the gold standards used for training? The use of semi-supervised
learning techniques to help solve this problem is a good next step, one that requires not less adher-
ence to annotated data, but an even stricter adherence to linguistic models and the features that are
derived from these models for subsequent annotation.
