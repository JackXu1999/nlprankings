Abstract

We offer a critical review of the current
state of opinion role extraction involving
opinion verbs. We argue that neither the
currently available lexical resources nor
the manually annotated text corpora are
sufficient to appropriately study this task.
We introduce a new corpus focusing on
opinion roles of opinion verbs from the
Subjectivity Lexicon and show potential
benefits of this corpus. We also demon-
strate that state-of-the-art classifiers per-
form rather poorly on this new dataset
compared to the standard dataset for the
task showing that there still remains sig-
nificant research to be done.

1 Introduction

We present a critical review of previous research
in opinion holder and target extraction. Opinion
holders (OH) are the entities that express an opin-
ion, while opinion targets (OT) are the entities or
propositions at which sentiment is directed. The
union of opinion holders and opinion targets are
referred to as opinion roles.

In this work we focus on opinion roles evoked
by verbs. We examine verbs since opinion role
extraction is considered a lexical semantics task
and for such tasks verbs are the central focus.

We argue for more lexical resources and corpora
that are less biased by domain artifacts. The com-
mon practice for producing labeled corpora has so
far mostly been extracting contiguous sentences
from a particular domain and then labeling those
sentences with regard to the entities that were in-
tended to be extracted, i.e. opinion holders and/or
opinion targets. In this paper we argue that cer-
tain important aspects of the task of opinion role
extraction get overlooked if one exclusively con-
siders those corpora that are currently available.

We particularly focus on the relationship between
opinion roles and their syntactic argument realiza-
tion. Previous work hardly addressed this issue
since either little variation between opinion roles
and their syntactic arguments was perceived on the
corpora on which this task was examined, or there
were other domain-specific properties that could
be used in order to extract opinion roles correctly
without the knowledge about opinion role realiza-
tion.

Currently, there exists only one commonly ac-
cepted corpus for English containing manual an-
notation of both opinion holders and targets, i.e.
the MPQA corpus (Deng and Wiebe, 2015). Apart
from that, not a single lexical resource for that
specific task is available. Moreover, there does
not exist any publicly available tool that supports
both opinion holder and target extraction. Typi-
cal applications, such as opinion summarization,
however, require both components simultaneously
(Stoyanov and Cardie, 2011). These facts indicate
that there definitely needs to be more research on
the task of opinion role extraction.

In order to stimulate more research in this di-
rection, we present a verb-based corpus for opin-
ion role extraction. The difference to previous
datasets is that it has been sampled in such a way
that all opinion verbs of a common sentiment lexi-
con are widely represented. Previous corpora have
a bias towards those opinion expressions that are
frequent in a particular domain. We demonstrate
on two opinion holder extraction systems that per-
formance on the new corpus massively drops com-
pared to their performance on a standard dataset.
This shows that current systems are not fit for
open-domain classification.

2 Opinion Roles and Lexical Semantics

Conventional syntactic or semantic levels of rep-
resentation do not capture sufficient information
that allows a reliable prediction in what argument

148



positions an opinion role may be realized. This
is illustrated by (1) and (2) which show that, even
with the PropBank-like semantic roles (i.e. agent,
patient1) assigned to the entities, one may not be
able to discriminate between the opinion roles.

(1) [Peter]OHagent dislikes [Mary]
OT
patient.

(2) [Peter]OTagent disappoints [Mary]
OH
patient.

We assume that it is lexical information that de-
cides in what argument position opinion roles are
realized. That is, a verb, such as dislike, believe
or applaud, belongs to a group with different lin-
guistic properties than verbs, such as disappoint,
interest or frighten. However, the realizations of
opinion roles observed in (1) and (2) are not the
only possibilities. In (3), there is no explicitly
mentioned opinion holder while the target is the
agent. Such cases are triggered by verbs, such as
gossip, blossom or decay.

(3) [These people]OTagent are gossiping a lot.

Another type of opinion verb is presented in (4)
and (5) where two viewpoints are evoked by the
same verb in the same sentence. (4) denotes the
sentiment view of Peter towards Mary while (5)
represents the sentiment view of Mary towards Pe-
ter (i.e. Peter made Mary feel better).

(4) [Peter]OHagent consoles [Mary]
OT
patient.

(5) [Peter]OTagent consoles [Mary]
OH
patient.

These types of selectional preferences (1)-(5)
have been observed before including the case
of multiple viewpoint evocation (4)-(5), most
prominently by Ruppenhofer et al. (2008). Yet lit-
tle research on opinion role extraction has actu-
ally paid attention to this issue. One exception is
Wiegand and Klakow (2012) who experiment with
an induction approach to distinguish cases like (1)
and (2). Nonetheless, datasets and lists of types of
opinion verbs have not been publicly released.

The above analysis suggests more research on
lexical resources is required. In the following, we
show that existing resources are not suitable to
provide the type of information we are looking for.
As a reference of opinion verbs, we use the set of
1175 verbs contained in the Subjectivity Lexicon
(Wilson et al., 2005). Our main assumption is that
the opinion verbs from that lexicon can be consid-
ered a representative choice of all kinds of opinion
expressions that exists in the English language.

1By agent and patient, we mean constituents labeled as
A0 and A1 in PropBank (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002).

3 On the Potential of Existing Lexical
Resources

In §2, we demonstrated the need for acquiring
more lexical knowledge about opinion verbs for
open-domain opinion role extraction. This raises
the question whether existing general-purpose re-
sources could be exploited for this purpose. If
one considers the plethora of different lexical re-
sources developed for sentiment analysis, i.e. sen-
timent lexicons listing subjective expressions and
their prior polarity (Wilson et al., 2005; Bac-
cianella et al., 2010; Taboada et al., 2011), emo-
tion lexicons (Mohammad and Turney, 2013) or
connotation lexicons (Kang et al., 2014), one
finds, however, that with respect to opinion role
extraction there is a gap. What is missing is a lex-
icon that states for each opinion verb in which ar-
gument position an opinion role can be found.

3.1 Sparsity and Other Shortcomings of
FrameNet

One resource that has previously been examined
for this task is FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998). The
idea is to identify in frames (which predominantly
contain opinion expressions) those frame elements
that typically contain either opinion holders or
opinion targets. Once this mapping has been es-
tablished, a FrameNet-parser, such as Semafor
(Das et al., 2010), could be used to automati-
cally recognize frame structures in natural lan-
guage text. By consulting the mapping from frame
elements to opinion roles, specific opinion roles
could be extracted. Kim and Hovy (2006) fol-
lowed this approach for a set of opinion verbs and
adjectives. Thus, they were able to correctly re-
solve some problems which cannot be solved with
the help of syntactic parsing or PropBank-like se-
mantic roles, such as the role distinctions in (1)
and (2). For instance, while the opinion holders in
(6) and (7) map to the same frame element EX-
PERIENCER, the PropBank-like semantic roles
differ. Unfortunately, the resulting mapping lists
from that work are not publicly available.

(6) [Peter EXPERIENCER ]OHagent dislikes [Mary]
OT
patient.

(7) [Peter]OTagent disappoints [Mary EXPERIENCER ]
OH
patient.

Table 1 shows some statistics of our opinion
verbs with regard to matched frames and frame el-
ements. Considering that there are 615 different
frame elements associated to the different frames2

2This count conflates frame elements of the same name
that occur in different frames.

# opinion verbs with at least one frame 691
# different frames associated with opinion verbs 306
# different frame elements associated with opinion verbs 615

Table 1: Statistics of opinion verbs w.r.t frames
and frame elements from FrameNet.

containing at least one of our opinion verbs, it
becomes obvious that mapping opinion roles to
frame elements is a challenging undertaking.

One major shortcoming of the FrameNet-
approach for opinion role extraction is that the cur-
rent FrameNet (version 1.5) still severely suffers
from a data-sparsity problem. For example, ap-
proximately 45% of the opinion verbs from the
Subjectivity Lexicon are missing from FrameNet
(Table 1). Even though there exist ways to ex-
pand the knowledge contained in FrameNet (Das
and Smith, 2012), there are also conceptual prob-
lems with the current FrameNet-ontology (Rup-
penhofer and Rehbein, 2012). Since FrameNet
is a general-purpose resource, there is no guar-
antee that frame structures perfectly match selec-
tional preferences of opinion roles. For instance,
we found that there are many frames that con-
tain opinion verbs with different selectional pref-
erences. The frame SCRUTINY, for example, typ-
ically contains many verbs that take an opinion
holder in agent position and an opinion target in
patient position (e.g. investigate or analyse). How-
ever, it also contains different verbs, such as pry.
Prying means to be interested in someone’s per-
sonal life in a way that is annoying or offensive
(Macmillan Dictionary). Given this definition, we
must note that this verb also contains another opin-
ion view (in addition to the one also conveyed by
the other verbs in this frame – as exemplified by
(8) and (9)), namely that of the speaker of the ut-
terance (condemning the behaviour of the agent of
pry). As a consequence, the agent of pry is also an
opinion target while its respective opinion holder
is the speaker of the utterance (10).

(8) [The police]OH investigated [her]OT thoroughly.
(9) [The press]OH continues to pry [into their affairs]OT .

(10) [The press]OT continues to pry into their affairs. (OH: speaker of the
utterance)

3.2 WordNet Lacking Syntactic Knowledge

At first glance, using WordNet (Miller et al.,
1990) as a way to acquire knowledge for selec-
tional preferences of opinion verbs seems a bet-
ter alternative. This resource has a far greater
lexical coverage than FrameNet (for example, the
set of opinion verbs from the Subjectivity Lexi-

con are all contained in WordNet). A straightfor-
ward solution for using that resource in the cur-
rent task would be to group opinion verbs that
share the same selectional preferences for opin-
ion holders and targets with the help of the Word-
Net ontology graph. One common way of doing
so would be the application of some bootstrap-
ping method in which one defines seed opinion
verbs with distinct selectional preferences (for in-
stance, one defines as one group opinion verbs that
take agents as opinion holders, such as dislike, as
another group verbs that take patients as opinion
holders, such as disappoint, and so on) and prop-
agate their labels to the remaining opinion verbs
via the WordNet graph. Such bootstrapping on
WordNet has been effectively used for the induc-
tion of sentiment lexicons (Esuli and Sebastiani,
2006; Rao and Ravichandran, 2009) or effect pred-
icates (Choi and Wiebe, 2014). It relies on a good
similarity metric in order to propagate the labels
from labeled seed words to unlabeled words.

We experimented with the metrics in Word-
Net::Similarity (Pedersen et al., 2004) and found
that the opinion verbs most similar to a specified
opinion verb do not necessarily share the same
syntactic properties. For example, Table 2 lists
the 12 opinion verbs most similar to outrage and
please, which are typical opinion verbs that take
an opinion holder in patient position and an opin-
ion target in agent position.3 (They would be plau-
sible candidates for verb seeds for that verb cat-
egory.) Unfortunately, among the list of similar
verbs, we find many opinion verbs which have
opinion holder and target in a different argument
position, such as hate on the list for outrage:

(11) [Mary]OTagent outrages/appals/scandalizes/... [Peter]
OH
patient.

(12) [Peter]OHagent hates/fears/loves/... [Mary]
OT
agent .

From a semantic point of view, the similarities
obtained look reasonable. rage, hate and dread
bear a semantic resemblance to outrage. How-
ever, the syntactic properties, i.e. the selectional
(argument) preferences, which are vital for opin-
ion role extraction, differ from outrage. Word-
Net is a primarily semantic resource (mainly with
a view towards lexical relations rather than va-
lence or argument structure), syntactic aspects that
would be necessary in order to induce selectional
preferences, are missing. Therefore, we suspect
that, by itself, WordNet is not a useful resource
for the extraction of opinion roles.

3We employ the metric by Wu and Palmer (1994).

outrage: appall, scandalize, anger, rage, sicken, temper, hate, fear, love,
alarm, dread, tingle

please: delight, enthral, enchant, gratify, signify, obviate, madden,
blind, avoid, despair, disagree, crush

derlined verbs do not share the selectional prefer-

4 Text Corpora for Fine-Grained
Sentiment Analysis

The previous section suggested that none of those
existing lexical resources yield the type of infor-
mation that is required for opinion role extraction.
We now also look at available text corpora and ex-
amine whether they reflect opinion verbs in such
a way that the problem of opinion role extraction
can be appropriately evaluated on them. We start
by looking at the review domain.

4.1 Why the review domain is not suitable for
studying opinion role extraction for verbs

There has been a lot of research on the review
domain, which also means that there are several
datasets from different domains allowing cross-
domain sentiment analysis. However, for more in-
depth opinion role extraction evoked by verb pred-
icates, these types of texts seem to be less suitable
– despite the plethora of previous publications on
opinion target extraction (Hu and Liu, 2004; Jakob
and Gurevych, 2010; Liu et al., 2013b; Liu et al.,
2013a; Liu et al., 2014). We identified the follow-
ing reasons for that:

Firstly, the subtask of opinion holder extraction
is not really relevant on this text type. Product
reviews typically reflect the author’s views on a
particular product. Therefore, the overwhelming
majority of explicitly mentioned opinion holders

Table 4: Proportion of relationships between opin-
ion targets and opinion verbs in the Darmstadt Ser-
vice Review Corpus (DSRC).

refer to the author of the pertaining review.
Secondly, opinion roles evoked by opinion

verbs are less frequent. We extracted all sentences
with opinion targets from the Darmstadt Service
Review Corpus (DSRC) (Toprak et al., 2010)4 and
counted the parts of speech of the corresponding
opinion expressions. Table 3 compares the fre-
quency of opinion adjectives and verbs. It shows
that adjectives are much more frequent than verbs.

Thirdly, the review domain is typically focused
on products, e.g. movies, books, electronic devices
etc. This also means that only specific semantic
types are eligible for opinion holders and targets,
e.g. persons are less likely to be opinion targets.
Therefore, much of the research in opinion target
extraction relies on entity priors. By that we mean
that (supervised) classifiers learn weights for spe-
cific entities (typically nouns or noun phrases) of
how likely they represent a priori an opinion tar-
get (Zhuang et al., 2006; Qiu et al., 2011; Liu
et al., 2013b; Liu et al., 2014). For example, in
the movie domain Psycho is very likely to be an
opinion target as will be iPhone in the electronics
domain. However, as such features do not trans-
fer to other domains, they distract research efforts
from the universally applicable feature of selec-
tional preferences. Table 4, for example, shows
the proportion of different relationships between
opinion targets and opinion verbs on DSRC. It
shows that there is a considerable number of tar-
gets in both agent position (14) and patient posi-
tion (13) & (15). So, it is not trivial to detect opin-
ion targets here. However, if one looks at typical
sentences that fall into these two classes, one finds
that entity priors and a few other heuristics would
help to solve this extraction problem.

For example, all a supervised classifier would
need to learn is that the personal pronoun I can
never be an opinion target (13) – in the review
domain it is typically an opinion holder. (This is
a typical entity prior that can be learned.) Oth-
erwise, agents are preferred opinion targets (14)
but if the agent is not realized, we simply tag the
patient (15). We found that these simple heuris-
tics would manage to correctly identify more than
70% of opinion targets on DSRC (being a depen-
dent of some opinion verb). Under these circum-
stances, one does not need to know that recom-
mend and stink have different selectional prefer-

4We chose this corpus as a typical representative corpus
for sentiment analysis in the review domain.

ences on opinion targets.

(13) I recommend [this site]OTpatient to anyone.
(14) [Their programs]OTagent stink.

(15) Avoid [this institution]OTpatient if you are a Canadian student!

These heuristics may work on review datasets,
but they become misleading when used in a cross-
domain setting, since their predictiveness may be
confined to specific domains. For example, in a
novel written in the first person, the mere occur-
rence of I is not telling. No mention of I in Sen-
tence (16) (taken from Gulliver’s Travels) repre-
sents an opinion holder.

(16) When [I] left Mr. Bates, [I] went down to my father: where [...] [I] got
forty pounds, and a promise of thirty pounds a year to maintain me at
Leyden: there [I] studied physic two years and seven months [...]

4.2 Is the news domain any better?

While we think that the review domain is less suit-
able for opinion role extraction, the conditions we
find on news corpora seem more promising. Typ-
ically, news corpora tend to be multi-topic. As
a consequence, opinion targets can be of differ-
ent semantic types. Persons can function both
as opinion holders and targets. In other words,
corpus artifacts like the ones mentioned in §4.1
are less likely to be helpful in solving the task.
The fact that the only corpus with a significant
amount of both opinion holders and targets anno-
tated, namely MPQA 3.0 (Deng and Wiebe, 2015),
consists of news text, further lends itself to the us-
age of that domain. Moreover, we do not have a
bias towards adjectives. On the MPQA corpus,
for example, we actually found that there are 10%
more opinion verb mentions than opinion adjec-
tive mentions. This analysis may suggest that the
existing MPQA corpus would be suitable for our
studies. Yet in the next sections, we show why for
the study of opinion roles of opinion verbs, it is
advisable to consider yet another corpus.

5 Our New Opinion Verb Corpus

With our new corpus for fine-grained analysis, we
mainly pursue three goals that, as discussed above,
are not sufficiently met by previous resources:

1. Our corpus is designed for the evaluation of opinion role extraction
systems focusing on mentions of opinion verbs.

2. It should widely represent various types of selectional preferences.
3. It should appropriately represent multiple viewpoint evocation.

Our new corpus was sampled from the North
American News Text Corpus (LDC95T21). The
dataset comprising 1073 sentences contains 753
opinion holders, 745 opinion targets and 499 opin-
ion targets of a speaker view (e.g. as in (3)). We
sampled in such a way that all opinion verbs from
the Subjectivity Lexicon were contained (Goal 1).
To compare: In the MPQA corpus, almost every
second opinion verb is unattested.

In order to demonstrate that our new corpus
is a more suitable resource in order to study se-
lectional preferences (Goal 2) and multiple view-
point evocation (Goal 3), we prepared some statis-
tics regarding mentions of opinion verbs and their
properties in the MPQA corpus and our corpus
(denoted by VERB). Due to the unavailability of
MPQA 3.0, we had to use MPQA 2.0, whose
annotation with regard to opinion targets is in-
complete. We therefore compare opinion verbs
only with regard to their opinion holders. How-
ever, given the strong interrelations between opin-
ion holders and targets (Yang and Cardie, 2013),
we think that if it is shown that our corpus better
represents the versatility of opinion holders, this
should (almost) equally also apply for opinion tar-
gets.

Table 5 examines the types of argument posi-
tions in which an opinion holder is realized. We
distinguish between three different roles (already
informally introduced in §2): the holder is in
agent position (example: dislike), the holder is
in patient position (example: disappoint) or the
holder is not an argument at all (example: gos-
sip). The latter are cases in which the speaker (or
some nested source) is the opinion holder. Table
5 also shows the proportion of verbs with multiple
viewpoint evocation and the average frequency of
individual opinion verbs. The table clearly shows
that on MPQA opinion verbs selecting opinion
holders in an agent position are predominant. We
think that this is just an artifact of having a corpus
of contiguous sentences whereby frequent verbs
predominate. VERB, like MPQA, originates from
the news domain. The only difference is that
it has been sampled so that all opinion verbs of
the Subjectivity Lexicon are equally represented
(and not only the frequent ones). A look at our
new corpus, which represents the set of opinion

152



verbs of the Subjectivity Lexicon, shows that other
types of opinion verbs are actually underrepre-
sented in MPQA. The same can be said about mul-
tiple viewpoint evocation. (The number for this
latter phenomenon is surprisingly high. We found
that the reason of this is that there are many verbs
that follow the pattern of pry (9)-(10), i.e. convey-
ing both a view of its agent and another view of
the speaker, such as idealize, moan, overempha-
size, patronize, snub, swindle or trivialize.)

We should wonder what impact this bias of
opinion role realizations has on building classi-
fiers. If one just focuses on MPQA, then always
considering opinion holders in agent position will
mean being right in almost 80% of the cases. Sim-
ilarly, there is no need to consider multiple view-
point evocation. So, this explains why previous
research paid little attention to these issues.

6 Details on Annotation

We followed the annotation scheme of Ruppen-
hofer et al. (2014). It is based on SalsaTigerXML
(Erk and Padó, 2004), an annotation scheme origi-
nally devised for representing FrameNet-like se-
mantic roles. On a sample of 200 sentences,
we measured an interannotation agreement of Co-
hen’s κ=0.69 for opinion holders and κ=0.63 for
opinion targets. The corpus is going to be made
publicly available to the research community.

7 Some Baselines

We now empirically prove that further research on
opinion role extraction is needed. For this proof,
we consider the two previously discussed corpora,
MPQA and VERB. MPQA is chosen as a train-
ing set.5 It is also the largest corpus. We want
to show that despite its size, open-domain opin-
ion role extraction requires some information that
is still not contained in that corpus. Almost every
second opinion verb from the Subjectivity Lexicon
is not contained in that corpus.

In this evaluation, we only consider opinion
holders. One reason for this is that opinion hold-
ers are less controversial to annotate (this also usu-
ally results in a higher interannotation agreement
(§6)). Another reason is that there is no publicly
available extraction system that covers targets.

For our experiments, we use the sequence la-
beler from Johansson and Moschitti (2013), Mul-

5The split-up of training and test set on the MPQA corpus
follows the specification of Johansson and Moschitti (2013).

tiRel. We chose this classifier since it is currently
the most sophisticated system for opinion holder
extraction and it is publicly available. MultiRel in-
corporates relational features taking into account
interactions between multiple opinion cues. In ad-
dition to MultiRel, we also consider convolution
kernels (CK) from Wiegand and Klakow (2012).
We include that classifier since it achieved overall
better performance than the traditional CRFs on
a wide set of experiments (Wiegand and Klakow,
2012) including on cross-domain settings.

In the evaluation, we only consider the opinion
holders of our opinion verbs. Recall that we are
only interested in the study of opinion roles asso-
ciated with opinion verbs.

Table 6 shows the results. MultiRel produces
the best performance on MPQA, but on VERB
suffers from a similar domain-mismatch as CK.
This drop in performance is not only due to the fact
that many opinion verbs do not occur in MPQA,
but also because the selectional preferences of
these uncovered verbs differ from the majority ob-
served in MPQA (Table 5).

8 Conclusion

We have argued for more research regarding opin-
ion role extraction involving opinion verbs. We
showed that with existing corpora, certain prob-
lems, such as the differences in selectional pref-
erences among opinion verbs cannot be properly
addressed. One cause for this is that corpora avail-
able contain opinion verbs with predominantly
one selectional preference. Another is that the cor-
pora have certain characteristics that happen to al-
low inferring opinion roles for specific text types
in the corpus (e.g. entity priors in reviews) but
which are not transferable to other text types. In
order to study the issue of opinion role realiza-
tion more thoroughly, we have created a small
dataset of sentences in which the opinion roles of
opinion verbs from the Subjectivity Lexicon have
been annotated. With two state-of-the-art classi-
fiers trained on the large MPQA corpus, we could
only produce comparatively poor results on opin-
ion role extractions. This shows that further re-
search on that research task is required.
