Abstract

We present a mobile app that provides a reading environment for learners of Chinese as a for-
eign language. The app includes a text database that offers over 500K articles from Chinese
Wikipedia. These articles have been word-segmented; each word is linked to its entry in a
Chinese-English dictionary, and to automatically-generated review exercises. The app estimates
the reading proficiency of the user based on a “to-learn” list of vocabulary items. It automatically
constructs and maintains this list by tracking the user’s dictionary lookup behavior and perfor-
mance in review exercises. When a user searches for articles to read, search results are filtered
such that the proportion of unknown words does not exceed a user-specified threshold.

1 Introduction

“Free voluntary reading” — i.e., recreational reading, or reading for pleasure — promotes reading com-
petence and vocabulary development (Krashen, 2005). Since it plays such an important role in second
language acquisition, students benefit from reading a wide range of texts, inside and outside the class-
room.

We present a mobile app that facilitates reading among learners of Chinese as a foreign language. The
app includes a text database that offers over 500K articles from Chinese Wikipedia, covering a wide range
of topics. These articles have been word-segmented. The app provides a supportive reading environment
by linking each word to its entry in a Chinese-English dictionary. It also automatically generates review
exercises for each word. Further, the app estimates the reading proficiency of the user based on his “to-
learn” list of vocabulary items, and maintains this list by tracking user behavior in dictionary lookup and
performance in review exercises. When a user searches for articles to read, search results are filtered
such that the proportion of unknown words does not exceed a user-specified threshold.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes the features of the app; these
features rely on a user proficiency model, which is presented in Section 3. Section 4 then describes
implementation details and evaluates the quality of the review exercises. Section 5 compares this app
with other computer-assisted language learning systems. Finally, Section 6 concludes.

2 System Features

The app toggles among three modes — Search, Read, and Review. In addition, there is a “Settings” page
for user customization.

2.1 Search Mode
The start page of the app presents a search interface for reading materials (Figure 1a). The user can enter
keywords to search for articles on the desired topic. Below the search field, the page displays words that
are currently in the user’s personal “to-learn” list. By highlighting these keywords, the app steers the
user to articles that can reinforce or expand his vocabulary knowledge.

Figure 1: From left to right: (a) Search Mode (Section 2.1): The user enters the keyword ji suan yu
yan xue ‘computational linguistics’ to search for articles on that topic; below the search field, the user’s
personal “to-learn” list is shown to provide suggested keywords. (b) Read Mode (Section 2.2): One of
the retrieved articles is displayed with word segmentation. Words predicted to be unknown to the user
are highlighted in orange. The user taps on the word kai duan ‘beginning’ to consult its dictionary entry
in English. (c) Settings page (Section 2.4): The user views his “to-learn” list, to which the word kai
duan has been added. (d) Review Mode (Section 2.3): A fill-in-the-blank item is offered for the word
kai duan, with three other distractors.

Previous research suggests that learners need to know 95% to 98% of the words in a text in order to
understand it well (Laufer, 1989; Hu and Nation, 2000; Schmitt et al., 2011). While the user should not be
overwhelmed with difficulty words, he might nonetheless desire articles that stretch his vocabulary. By
default, the search results are filtered such that the proportion of unknown words does not exceed 20%.
This percentage can be adjusted by the user to suit his preference (Section 2.4). The app dynamically
estimates the user’s vocabulary level (Section 3), so that search results keep pace with his increasing
proficiency.

2.2 Read Mode
When the user taps on a search result, the app enters the Read Mode and initially displays plain text with
no reading aid. The user may choose to request word segmentation and English translations for Chinese
words. As shown in Figure 1b, word boundaries are indicated with space, and words predicted to be
unknown to the user are highlighted in yellow. When the user taps on a Chinese word, the app shows
its English translation at the bottom, and also prompts the user to add the Chinese word to his “to-learn”
list.

2.3 Review Mode
At any time, the user can request review exercises for words in his “to-learn” list. We will refer to the
word being reviewed as the “target word”. The app offers two kinds of exercises:

• Translation exercises: The user is shown the target word and three possible choices of its En-
glish translation. One of these choices is the definition extracted from the English dictionary (Sec-
tion 4.1). The other three are distractors, drawn randomly among other entries in the dictionary.
These exercises start with easy words in the “to-learn” list and proceed to the more difficult ones,
as estimated by word frequencies in Chinese Wikipedia.

• Fill-in-the-blank exercises: The system randomly draws a sentence from the text database (Sec-
tion 4.1) that contains the target word. It blanks out the target word and offers four choices. One

12



choice is the target word itself; the other three are distractors, chosen such that they have the same
part-of-speech and similar word frequencies as the target word (Coniam, 1997). Figure 1d shows a
fill-in-the-blank item for the word kai duan ’beginning’.

If the user picks the right answer for either exercise, the target word is removed from the “to-learn”
list, and the user proficiency model is updated (Section 3).

2.4 Settings
On the Settings page, the user can view and adjust three parameters:

• “To-learn” list. The user can view and optionally remove words from the “to-learn” list (Figure 1c).
• Vocabulary coverage percentage: This parameter specifies the minimum percentage of words that

must be known to the user in an article, to filter out reading material that would require excessive
dictionary lookup. It is set at 80% by default and can be adjusted by the user.

• User proficiency level: The app estimates the user’s vocabulary proficiency level (Section 3). The
level is shown to the user on a 20-level scale. Level 1 assumes knowledge of the 1000 most frequent
words in Chinese Wikipedia. Each subsequent level adds the 1000 next most frequent words, up to
Level 20. At this highest level, with the default vocabulary coverage percentage of 80%, the user
would be able to read 82.2% of the articles in Chinese Wikipedia. The user can manually adjust his
proficiency level in order to obtain easier or more difficult reading material.

3 User Proficiency Model

In order to retrieve texts that challenge the user, yet not overwhelmingly difficult, the app attempts to
estimate the user’s proficiency level. Automatic proficiency assessment is a difficult task and needs to
consider a wide range of factors. Since previous research has shown significant correlation between
proficiency and vocabulary level (Laufer and Nation, 1995; Coniam, 1999), we focus on the user’s
vocabulary size. Specifically, the app estimates the number of Chinese words that the user knows. We
rank the words in the user’s “to-learn” list according to their frequency in Chinese Wikipedia. The user
is then estimated to know all words that have higher frequency than the median word in the list.

A new user is estimated to know 5000 words, the breadth required for the highest level of the Hanyu
Shuiping Kaoshi (HSK), a widely adopted proficiency test for Chinese. The estimate then dynamically
changes according to the set of words in the “to-learn” list. In Read Mode, when the user looks up the
English translation of a Chinese word, that word is added to the list. In Review Mode, when the user
successfully completes an exercise on a target word, that word is removed from the list. The user can
also directly edit the “to-learn” list and/or the proficiency level in the Settings page (Section 2.4).

4 Implementation

4.1 Text Database
We used Solr, a high performance search server that supports full-text search, to construct our database.
We extracted a total of 524,543 articles from Chinese Wikipedia to be included in the database. On
average, each article has 370 characters and 12 sentences. We segmented all texts with the Stanford
Chinese segmenter (Manning et al., 2014). CC-CEDICT, a Chinese to English dictionary with 114,291
entries, supplies English translations for Chinese words in the texts.

4.2 Fill-in-the-blank Exercises
For each target word, the app generates fill-in-the-blank items (Section 2.3). Each item consists of a
carrier sentence with a blank, and four choices for the blank. The generation process is as follows:

• Carrier sentence selection: The sentence must contain the target word, and must be between 10
and 20 words long. Further, other words in the sentence must not be more difficult (i.e., have lower
frequency) than the target word. Within these constraints, for each target word, ten sentences are
selected as carrier sentences.

13



• Distractor generation: While the key for the item is the target word, the three distractors must be
generated. We follow largely the same criteria as Coniam (1997), requiring the distractors to have
similar word frequency and the same part-of-speech as the key. It is crucial that a distractor be an
unacceptable answer. We evaluated 100 fill-in-the-blank items, randomly chosen from all 20 levels.
Overall, 92% of these items had a unique answer (i.e., the target word), while the remaining 8%
contained two correct answers.

5 Previous Work

Current systems that support reading in a foreign language mostly focus on English. The user can
search for web pages with the Read-X tool, which classifies them in real time according to theme and
to difficulty level (Miltsakaki and Troutt, 2008); the text is then displayed in the Toreador tool, which
underlines unknown vocabulary according to the user-specified grade level. Another system, REAP,
allows the user to search a database of downloaded web pages (Heilman et al., 2008). Similar to our
system, REAP offers fill-in-the-blank exercises, but they are human-crafted rather than automatically
generated.

Fewer systems are available to learners of Chinese as a foreign language. Many focus mainly on
teaching characters and words (Shei and Hsieh, 2012). Others, such as Clavis Sinica (clavisinica.com)
and Du Chinese (duchinese.net), use pre-selected texts, vocabulary exercises and translations. The Smart
Chinese Reader (nlptool.com) allows the user to input any text, and then automatically performs word
segmentation and links the words to CC-CEDICT. In addition, it supports automatic sentence translation,
and helps the user maintain a “to-learn” word list. Distinct to the systems cited above, our system
automatically generates vocabulary review exercises (Section 2.3), and dynamically estimates the user’s
proficiency level to personalize search results (Section 3).

6 Conclusions and Future work

We have presented an app that offers a reading environment for learners of Chinese as a foreign lan-
guage. It helps the user search for reading material at an appropriate vocabulary level, and automatically
generates review exercises. In future work, we would like to further develop this app in a number of
areas. First, we intend to implement more sophisticated criteria for choosing sentences for the review
exercises (Kilgarriff et al., 2008). Second, we aim to refine the estimation procedure for the user’s vo-
cabulary level (Miltsakaki and Troutt, 2008; Ehara et al., 2012; Ehara et al., 2013). Lastly, we plan to
take into account the syntactic complexity of a text when assessing its difficulty level (Heilman et al.,
2007).
