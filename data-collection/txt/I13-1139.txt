Abstract 

Bilingual lexicons of proper names play a vital 
role in machine translation and cross-language 
information retrieval. Word alignment ap-
proaches are generally used to construct bilin-
gual lexicons automatically from parallel cor-
pora. Aligning proper names is a task particu-
larly difficult when the source and target lan-
guages of the parallel corpus do not share a 
same written script. We present in this paper a 
system to transliterate automatically proper 
names from Arabic to Latin script, and a tool 
to align single and compound words from 
English-Arabic parallel texts. We particularly 
focus on the impact of using transliteration to 
improve the performance of the word align-
ment tool. We have evaluated the word align-
ment tool integrating transliteration of proper 
names from Arabic to Latin script using two 
methods: A manual evaluation of the align-
ment quality and an evaluation of the impact 
of this alignment on the translation quality by 
using the open source statistical machine 
translation system Moses. Experiments show 
that integrating transliteration of proper names 
into the alignment process improves the F-
measure of word alignment from 72% to 81% 
and the translation BLEU score from 20.15% 
to 20.63%. 

1 Introduction 

Bilingual lexicons of proper names play a vital 
role in Machine Translation (MT) and Cross-
Language Information Retrieval (CLIR). Word 
alignment approaches are generally used to con-
struct bilingual lexicons automatically from par-
allel corpora. Aligning proper names requires 
both recognition of the proper names present in 

the parallel corpus and their alignment (Abuleil 
and Evens, 2004). This task is particularly diffi-
cult when the source and target languages of the 
parallel corpus do not share a same written 
script. A solution to this issue consists in writing 
the proper names present in the parallel corpus in 
the same written script. This operation is named 
transliteration and consists in replacing each 
grapheme of a writing system by another graph-
eme or a group of graphemes of another writing 
system, regardless of pronunciation. 

In order to study the impact of using translit-
eration to improve the performance of a word 
alignment tool, we present in this paper a system 
to transliterate automatically proper names from 
Arabic to Latin script, and a tool to align single 
and compound words from English-Arabic paral-
lel texts. 

The remainder of the paper is organized as fol-
lows: Section 2 recalls in some previous work 
addressing tasks of transliteration and bilingual 
lexicon extraction from parallel corpora. In sec-
tion 3, we present briefly the system for automat-
ic transliteration of proper names from Arabic to 
Latin script. Section 4 describes the process of 
using transliteration in the word alignment tool. 
We present in section 5 the experimental proto-
col we followed and discuss the obtained results. 
We finally conclude and present directions for 
future work in section 6. 

2 Related Work 

In order to build bilingual lexicons from parallel 
corpora automatically, several word alignment 
approaches have been explored (Daille et al., 
1994; Blank, 2000; Barbu, 2004). These ap-
proaches align proper names correctly when the 
source and target languages of the parallel corpus 

1022



share a same written script. Recent research 
works for aligning proper names when the source 
and target languages do not share a same written 
script have focused on automatic alignment of 
transliterations in order to enrich bilingual lexi-
cons of named entities. These include (Al-
Onaizan and Knight, 2002) and (Sherif and Kon-
drak, 2007) who worked on the Arabic-English 
alignment, (Tao et al., 2006) who worked on Ar-
abic, Chinese and English, and (Shao and Ng, 
2004) who used the information resulted from 
transliterations based on pronunciation. They 
combined the obtained information from the 
translation context and those generated from 
Chinese and English transliteration. This tech-
nique allowed processing some specific infre-
quent words. Some other systems assign for a 
given name only one transliteration such as the 
generative model for English words written in 
Japanese (Katakana) to Latin transcription 
(Knight and Graehl, 1997). This approach was 
adapted by (Stalls and Knight, 1998) to translate 
English words written in Arabic into English. 
(AbdulJaleel and Larkey, 2003) proposed a sys-
tem based on a statistical approach to translit-
erate English names into Arabic. This system has 
several limitations as it uses the computation of 
the most probable form supposed to be the cor-
rect one. Indeed, this hypothesis is not always 
valid in all the Arab countries and dialects. To 
avoid pronunciation and dialect varieties, (Al-
ghamdi, 2005) proposed a system to transliterate 
vowelized Arabic names into English. This sys-
tem is based on a dictionary of Arabic names in 
which the pronunciation is set using vowels add-
ed to listed names with an indication of their 
equivalents in English. This approach has a 
strong limitation when used in word alignment as 
it proposes only one transliteration for a given 
name. Recently, (Saadane et al., 2012) proposed 
an approach to transliterate proper names from 
Arabic to Latin script which takes into account 
phonological and linguistic aspects. The authors 
reported an improvement of the F-measure of 
their French-Arabic word alignment tool from 
82% to 86%. 

3 Transliteration of Proper Names from 
Arabic to Latin Script 

The transliteration system of proper names from 
Arabic to Latin script used in this study (Saadane 
et al., 2012) is based on a finite-state automaton. 
This automaton switches from one state to an-
other according to the outward transitions of the 

current state and the currently processed letter of 
the Arabic word. The transliteration process is 
composed of the following main steps: 

1. Transliteration: Each proper name is, 
first, split or not into several elements 
according to its type and the particles 
which do not compose the name itself 
are transcribed. Then, transliteration 
rules are applied to transliterate the 
names themselves. These rules are ap-
plied in a certain order based on the 
number of consonants of the proper 
name. For example, the compound name 
 + ال + 	��“ is, first, split into ”	�� ا�����“
 ”ال“ ” and	��second, the particles “ ,”ر���
are transcribed into “abd” and “al”, and 
finally the name “ر���” is transliterated 
into rachid, rashid, etc.  

2. Normalization: This step consists in per-
forming some post-processing on the 
generated transliterations such as chang-
ing the first letter into capital. 

3. Weighting: This step consists in assign-
ing weights to the rules used to generate 
the list of transliterations in order to dis-
play the results sorted from the most 
likely to the least likely. Results of some 
search engines are exploited to compute 
these weights based on the number of 
occurrences for each generated translit-
eration of the proper name. 

4 Alignment of Proper Names from 
English-Arabic Corpora 

Word alignment from parallel corpora consists, 
on the one hand, in identifying words present in 
the source and target texts, and, on the other 
hand, in establishing correspondences between 
these words. The word alignment tool evaluated 
in this study (Semmar et al., 2010), first, identi-
fies single words and compound words present in 
the parallel corpus using the linguistic analyzer 
LIMA (Besançon et al., 2010), and, second, es-
tablishes correspondence relations between these 
words using the following steps: 

1. Look-up of words which are present in 
an existing English-Arabic lexicon com-
posed of 149495 entries; 

2. Matching of words which are cognates; 
3. Matching of words which have the same 

grammatical categories; 
4. Establishing correspondence relations 

between compound words. 

1023



We describe below only the step 2 which illus-
trates the process of using transliteration of prop-
er names from Arabic to Latin script in English-
Arabic word alignment. 

Proper names alignment consists, first, in 
searching words present in the source and target 
sentences which have the grammatical category 
“Proper Name” by using the results of the lin-
guistic analyzer LIMA, and, second, in identify-
ing words which are cognates. Several research 
works have shown that using cognates can im-
prove both sentence alignment (Simard et al., 
1993) and word alignment (Kondrak, 2005). In 
our implementation, we consider, in a first step, 
that pairs of words which share the first four 
characters as cognates. This step uses the results 
of the transliteration into Latin script of all the 
proper names present in the Arabic corpus and 
can identify, for example, that the proper name 
"Kosovo" and the transliteration of the Arabic 
word "�-kosoufou") are cognates. How") "آ���
ever, this step does not detect pairs of words such 
as "Algeria" and "aljazair" (transliteration of the 
Arabic word “ا���ا��”). To take into account this 
kind of pairs of words, we used the Jaro–Winkler 
distance DJW (Winkler, 1990), a similarity 
measure based on the number of letters in com-
mon between the string of the word of the source 
language ws and the string of the word of the 
target language wt. 

 
where: 

• m is the number of matching characters. 
Two characters from ws and wt respec-
tively, are considered matching only if 
they are the same and not farther than: 

 

• t is the number of transpositions which is 
equal to the half of number of characters 
in ws that do not line up (by index in the 
matched subsequence) with identical char-
acters in wt. 

• |ws|, |wt| are lengths of the strings corre-
sponding to the words ws and wt. 

 
Jaro–Winkler similarity measure is a variant 

of the Jaro distance metric DJ (Jaro, 1989). 
 

 

where: 

• l is the length of common prefix at the 
start of the string up to a maximum of 4 
characters. 

• p is a constant scaling factor for how 
much the score is adjusted upwards for 
having common prefixes. 

In order to identify the values of l and p which 
provide the best alignment, we checked manually 
the result of the transliteration of 254 proper 
names. This evaluation showed that, if l is equal 
to 2 and p is equal to 0.1, the words ws and wt 
are cognates when the value of the Jaro–Winkler 
distance is the highest. Table 1 presents results 
after running our word alignment tool on the 
English sentence “Condemning all violations of 
human rights in Kosovo which have affected all 
ethnic groups in Kosovo.” and its Arabic transla-
tion “ ار�%$ # آ���� �� ا"! �آ�ت ����ق وإذ ���� آ� �� 
.� .”ا3"�2ن ��0/ .-�, ا�+*�ت ا�(�)�' # آ���

The word "Kosovo" was aligned using cog-
nates matching after transliteration, the words 
"condemn", "human", "affect" and “group” were 
aligned using grammatical categories matching 
and the other single words exist in the English-
Arabic lexicon. The compound words “viola-
tion_human_right”, “ِإْ"ِ!َ �ك_َ;:_إْ"�2َن”, “hu-
man_right”, “إْ"�2َن_:;َ”, “ethnic_group” and 
“'<�(ِ�َ	َ_'*َِ” are first recognized by LIMA respec-
tively from the source sentence and the target 
sentence, and then aligned using lexical and syn-
tactic transfer rules between source and target 
languages (Ozdowska, 2004).

5 Experimental Results and Evaluation 

The impact of using transliteration of proper 
names on the quality of alignment and machine 
translation has been evaluated according to the 
two following approaches: 

• A manual evaluation comparing the re-
sults of our word aligner with a reference 
alignment; 

• An automatic evaluation by integrating 
the results of our word aligner tool in the 
training corpus used to build the transla-
tion table of the statistical MT system 
Moses (Koehn et al., 2007). 

In order to evaluate the alignment quality 
manually, we used 500 English-Arabic aligned 
sentences extracted from the MT evaluation 
MEDAR1 package and we followed the evalua-
tion framework defined in (Mihalcea and Peder-
sen, 2003). Table 2 summarizes the results of our 
word aligner in terms of precision and recall. The 
first line describes the performance of the word 
aligner when it does not integrate transliteration 
and the second line mentions its performance 
when it uses transliteration. As we can see, the 
results demonstrate that using transliteration im-
proves both precision and recall of word align-
ment. These results confirm those obtained by 
(Sajjad et al., 2003) related to the improvement 
of alignment quality when integrating translitera-
tion into the GIZA++ word aligner.

compound words alignment 
 
The unavailability of a reference alignment of 

a significant size for single and compound words 
does not allow us to compare our approach with 
the state-of-the-art work. That's why we decided 
to study the impact of the use of transliteration in 
word alignment by integrating the results of our 
word aligner in the training corpus used to ex-
tract the translation model of Moses. The initial 
training corpus is composed of 75000 pairs of 
English-Arabic sentences extracted from the 

                                                 
1 The MT evaluation MEDAR package is available on 
http://www.medar.info/index.php. 

MEDAR corpus (2631654 English words and 
2344878 Arabic words). We added to this corpus 
around 28000 pairs of single and compound 
words corresponding to the results of our word 
aligner which integrates transliteration applied 
on 1000 pairs of English-Arabic sentences. We 
also specified a language model for the target 
language using a corpus composed of 100000 
Arabic sentences (3155516 words). The perfor-
mance of the statistical machine translation sys-
tem Moses is evaluated using the BLEU score on 
a test corpus composed of 500 pairs of sentences. 
Note that we consider one reference per sen-
tence. The obtained results show that the inclu-
sion in the training corpus of word alignment 
results integrating transliteration has improved 
the translation BLEU score from 20.15 to 20.63 
(a gain of 0.48 points). 

In order to assess statistical significance of the 
obtained results, we use the paired bootstrap 
resampling method (Koehn, 2004) which esti-
mates the probability (p-value) that a measured 
difference in BLEU scores arose by chance by 
repeatedly (10 times) creating new virtual test 
sets by drawing sentences with replacement from 
a given collection of translated sentences. We 
carry out experiments using this method to com-
pare the translation results without using translit-
eration and with the use of transliteration. At a 
95% confidence interval (CI), the results vary 
from insignificant (at p > 0.05) to highly signifi-
cant. The p-value obtained is equal to 0.02 and 
therefore the improvement achieved by using 
transliteration is statistically significant. 

6 Conclusion 

We presented briefly in this paper a system to 
transliterate proper names from Arabic to Latin 
script and we proposed a tool to automatically 
align word pairs from an English-Arabic parallel 
corpus. We integrated the transliterated proper 
names into the cognates matching step and we 
obtained a gain of 9% on word alignment F-
measure and a gain of 0.48 points in translation 
BLEU score. These encouraging results can be 
improved in a number of ways. First, we plan to 
affect a weight for each word pair in order to fil-
ter the word alignment results and to integrate 
them directly in the translation table of Moses. 
We also plan to use, on the one hand, the linguis-
tic analyzer LIMA to lemmatize texts of the bi-
lingual corpus, and on the other hand, factored 
models and a flexor to generate adequate surface 
forms from lemmas.
