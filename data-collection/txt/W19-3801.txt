Abstract

The 1st ACL workshop on Gender Bias in Nat-
ural Language Processing included a shared
task on gendered ambiguous pronoun (GAP)
resolution. This task was based on the coref-
erence challenge defined in Webster et al.
(2018), designed to benchmark the ability of
systems to resolve pronouns in real-world con-
texts in a gender-fair way. 263 teams com-
peted via a Kaggle competition, with the win-
ning system achieving logloss of 0.13667 and
near gender parity. We review the approaches
of eleven systems with accepted description
papers, noting their effective use of BERT (De-
vlin et al., 2019), both via fine-tuning and for
feature extraction, as well as ensembling.

1 Introduction

Gender bias is one of the typologies of social bias
(e.g. race, politics) that is alarming the Natural
Language Processing (NLP) community. An il-
lustration of the problematic behaviour are the re-
currently appearing occupational stereotypes that
homemaker is to woman as programmer is to man
(Bolukbasi et al., 2016). Recent studies have
aimed to detect, analyse and mitigate gender bias
in different NLP tools and applications including
word embeddings (Bolukbasi et al., 2016; Go-
nen and Goldberg, 2019), coreference resolution
(Rudinger et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2018), senti-
ment analysis (Park et al., 2018; Bhaskaran and
Bhallamudi, 2019) and machine translation (Van-
massenhove et al., 2018; Font and Costa-jussà,
2019). One of the main sources of gender bias
is believed to be societal artefacts in the data from
which our algorithms learn. To address this, many
have created gender-labelled and gender-balanced
datasets (Rudinger et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2018;
Vanmassenhove et al., 2018).

We present the results of a shared task eval-
uation conducted at the 1st Workshop on Gen-
der Bias in Natural Language Processing at the

ACL 2019 conference. The shared task is based
on the gender-balanced GAP coreference dataset
(Webster et al., 2018) and allows us to test the
hypothesis that fair datasets would be enough to
solve the gender bias challenge in NLP.

The strong results of submitted systems tend
to support this hypothesis and gives the com-
munity a great starting point for mitigating bias
in models. Indeed, the enthusiastic participation
we saw for this shared task has yielded systems
which achieve near-human accuracy while achiev-
ing near gender-parity at 0.99, measured by the ra-
tio between F1 scores on feminine and masculine
examples. We are excited for future work extend-
ing this success to more languages, domains, and
tasks. However, we especially note future work
in algorithms which achieve fair outcomes given
biased data, given the wealth of information from
existing unbalanced datasets.

2 Task

The goal of our shared task was to encourage re-
search in gender-fair models for NLP by providing
a well-defined task that is known to be sensitive to
gender bias and an evaluation procedure address-
ing this issue. We chose the GAP resolution task
(Webster et al., 2018), which measures the abil-
ity of systems to resolve gendered pronoun ref-
erence from real-world contexts in a gender-fair
way. Specifically, GAP asks systems to resolve
a target personal pronoun to one of two names,
or neither name. For instance, a perfect resolver
would resolve that she refers to Fujisawa and not
to Mari Motohashi in the Wikipedia excerpt:

(1) In May, Fujisawa joined Mari Motohashi’s rink as
the team’s skip, moving back from Karuizawa to Ki-
tami where she had spent her junior days.

The original GAP challenge encourages fairness by
balancing its datasets by the gender of the pro-
noun, as well as using disaggregated evaluation



2

with separate scores for masculine and feminine
examples. To simplify evaluation, we did not dis-
aggregate evaluation for this shared task, but in-
stead encouraged fairness by not releasing the bal-
ance of masculine to feminine examples in the fi-
nal evaluation data.1

The competition was run on Kaggle2, a well-
known platform for competitive data science and
machine learning projects with an active commu-
nity of participants and support.

2.1 Setting
The original GAP challenge defines four evalua-
tion settings, depending on whether the candidate
systems have to identify potential antecedents or
are given a fixed choice of antecedent candidates,
and whether or not they have access to the en-
tire Wikipedia page from which the example was
extracted. Our task was run in gold-two-mention
with page-context. This means that, for our task,
systems had access to the two names being evalu-
ated at inference time, so that the systems were not
required to do mention detection and full coref-
erence resolution. For each example, the sys-
tems had to consider whether the target pronoun
was coreferent with the first, the second or nei-
ther of the two given antecedent candidates. A
valid submission consisted of a probability esti-
mate for each of these three cases. The systems
were also given the source URL for the text snip-
pet (a Wikipedia page), enabling unlimited access
to context. This minimized the chance that sys-
tems could cheat, intentionally or inadvertently, by
accessing information outside the task setting.

2.2 Data
To ensure blind evaluation, we sourced 760 new
annotated examples for official evaluation3 using
the same techniques from the original GAP work
(Webster et al., 2018), with three changes. To en-
sure the highest quality of annotations for this task,
we (i) only accepted examples on which the three
raters provided unanimous judgement, (ii) added
heuristics to remove cases with errors in entity
span labeling, and (iii) did an additional, manual
round to remove assorted errors. The final set of

Table 1: Performance of prize-winning submissions on
the blind Kaggle evaluation set. logloss was the official
task metric, and correlates well with F1 score, which
was used in the original GAP work.

760 clean examples was dispersed in a larger set
of 11,599 unlabeled examples to produce a set of
12,359 examples that competing systems had to
rate. This augmentation was to discourage sub-
missions based on manual labeling.

We note many competing systems used the orig-
inal GAP evaluation data4 as training data for this
task, given that the two have the same format, base
domain (Wikipedia), and task definition.

2.3 Evaluation

The original GAP work defined two official evalu-
ation metrics, F1 score and Bias, the ratio between
the F1 scores on feminine and masculine exam-
ples. Bias takes a value of 1 at gender parity; a
value below 1 indicates that masculine entities are
resolved more accurately than feminine ones.

In contrast, the official evaluation metric of the
competition was the logloss of the submitted prob-
ability estimates:

logloss =− 1
N

N

∑
i=1

M

∑
j=1

yi j log pi j, (1)

where N is the number of samples in the test set,
M = 3 is the number of classes to be predicted, yi j
is 1 if observation i belongs to class j according
to the gold-standard annotations and 0 otherwise,
and pi j is the probability estimated by the system
that observation i belongs to class j.

Table 1 tabulates results based on the original
and shared task metrics. Logloss and GAP F1 both
place the winners in the same order.

2.4 Prizes

A total prize pool of USD 25,000 was provided
by Google. The pool was broken down into prizes
of USD 12,000, 8,000, and 5,000 for the top three
systems, respectively. This attracted submissions

from 263 teams, covering a wide diversity of geo-
graphic locations and affiliations, see Section 3.1.
Table 1 lists results for the three prize-winning
systems: Attree (2019), Wang (2019), and Abza-
liev (2019).

3 Submissions

In this section, we describe the diverse set of teams
who competed in the shared task, and the systems
they designed for the GAP challenge. We note
effective use of BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), both
via fine-tuning and for feature extraction, and en-
sembling. Despite very little modeling targeted at
debiasing for gender, the submitted systems nar-
rowed the gender gap to near parity at 0.99, while
achieving remarkably strong performance.

3.1 Teams

We accepted ten system description papers, from
11 of the 263 teams who competed (Ionita et al.
(2019) is a combined submission from the teams
placing 5 and 22). Table 2 characterises the teams
by their number of members, whether their affili-
ation is to industry or an academic institution, and
the geographic location of their affiliation. Details
about participant gender were not collected.

Our first observation is that 7 of the top 10 teams
submitted system descriptions, which allows us
good insight into what approaches work well for
the GAP task (see next, Section 3.2). Also, All
these teams publicly release their code, promoting
transparency and further development.

We note the geographic diversity of teams:
there is at least one team from each of Africa,
Asia, Europe, and USA, and one team collab-
orating across regions (Europe and USA). Five
teams had industry affiliations and four academic;
the geographically diverse team was diverse here
also, comprising both academic and industry re-
searchers.

There is a correlation between team size and af-
filiation: industry submissions were all from in-
dividual contributors, while academic researchers
worked in groups. This correlation is somewhat
indicative of performance: individual contributors
from industry won all three monetary prizes, and
only one academic group featured in the top ten
submissions. A possible factor in this was the con-
current timing of the competition with other con-
ference deadlines.

3.2 Systems

All system descriptions were from teams who
used BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), a method to
create context-sensitive word embeddings by pre-
training a deep self-attention neural network on
a training objective optimizing for cloze word
prediction and recognition of adjacent sentences.
This is perhaps not surprising, given the recent
success of BERT for modeling a wide range of
NLP tasks (Tenney et al., 2019; Kwiatkowski et al.,
2019) and the small amount of training data avail-
able for GAP resolution (which makes LM pre-
training particularly attractive). The different
models built from BERT are summarized in Ta-
ble 3.

Eight of the eleven system descriptions used
BERT via fine-tuning, the technique recommended
in Devlin et al. (2019). To do this, the origi-
nal GAP data release was used as a tuning set to
learn a classifier on top of BERT to predict whether
the target pronoun referred to Name A, Name B,
or Neither. Abzaliev (2019) also made use of
the available datasets for coreference resolution:
OntoNotes 5.0 (Pradhan and Xue, 2009), Wino-
Bias (Zhao et al., 2018), WinoGender (Rudinger
et al., 2018), and the Definite Pronoun Resolution
Dataset (Rahman and Ng, 2012). Given the multi-
ple BERT models available, it was possible to learn
multiple such classifiers; teams marked ensemble
fine-tuned multiple base BERT models and ensem-
bled their predictions, while teams marked single
produced just one, from a BERT-Large variant.

An alternative way to use BERT in NLP model-
ing is as a feature extractor. Teams using BERT
in this capacity represented mention spans as in-
put vectors to a neural structure (typically a linear
structure, e.g. feed-forward network) that learned
some sort of mention compatibility, via interaction
or feature crossing. To derive mention-span repre-
sentations from BERT subtoken encodings, Wang
(2019) found that pooling using an attention-
mediated process was more effective than simple
mean-pooling; most teams pooled using AllenAI’s
SelfAttentionSpanExtractor5. An interesting find-
ing was that certain BERT layers were more suit-
able for feature extraction than others (see Abza-
liev (2019); Yang et al. (2019) for an exploration).

The winning solution (Attree, 2019) used a

novel evidence pooling technique, which used the
output of off-the-shelf coreference resolvers in a
way that combines aspects of ensembling and fea-
ture crossing. This perhaps explains the system’s
impressive performance despite its relative sim-
plicity. Two other systems stood out as novel in
their approach to the task: Chada (2019) reformu-
lated GAP reference resolution as a question an-
swering task, and Lois et al. (2019) used BERT in
a third way, directly applying the masked language
modeling task to predicting resolutions.

Despite the scarcity of data for this challenge,
there was little use of extra resources. Only two
teams made use of the URL given in the example,
with Attree (2019) using it only indirectly as part
of a coreference heuristic fed into evidence pool-
ing. Two teams augmented the GAP data by using
name substitutions (Liu, 2019; Lois et al., 2019)

and two automatically created extra examples of
the minority label Neither (Attree, 2019; Bao and
Qiao, 2019).

4 Discussion

Running the GAP shared task has taught us many
valuable things about reference, gender, and BERT
models. Based on these, we make recommenda-
tions for future work expanding from this shared
task into different languages and domains.

GAP Given the incredibly strong performance
of the submitted systems, it is tempting to ask
whether GAP resolution is solved. We suggest the
answer is no. Firstly, the shared task only tested
one of the four original GAP settings. A more chal-
lenging setting would be snippet-context, in which
use of Wikipedia is not allowed, which we would



5

extend to LM pre-training. Also, GAP only targets
particular types of pronoun usage, and the time
is ripe for exploring others. We are particularly
excited for future work in languages with differ-
ent pronoun systems (esp. prodrop languages in-
cluding Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese), and gen-
der neutral personal pronouns, e.g. English they,
Spanish su or Turkish o.

Gender It is encouraging to see submitted sys-
tems improve the gender gap so close to parity at
0.99, particularly as no special modeling strate-
gies were required. Indeed, Abzaliev (2019) re-
ported that a handcrafted pronoun gender feature
had no impact. Moreover, Bao and Qiao (2019) re-
port that BERT encodings show no significant gen-
der bias on either WEAT (Caliskan et al., 2017)
or SEAT (May et al., 2019). We look forward to
studies considering potential biases in BERT across
more tasks and dimensions of diversity.

BERT The teams competing in the shared task
made effective use of BERT in at least three dis-
tinct methods: fine-tuning, feature extraction, and
masked language modeling. Many system papers
noted the incredible power of the model (see, e.g.
Attree (2019) for a good analysis), particularly
when compared to hand-crafted features (Abza-
liev, 2019). We also believe the widespread use of
BERT is related to the low rate of external data us-
age, as it is easier for most teams to reuse an exist-
ing model than to clean and integrate new data. As
well as the phenomenal modeling power of BERT,
one possible reason for this observation is that the
public releases of BERT are trained on the same
domain as the GAP examples, Wikipedia. Future
work could benchmark non-Wikipedia BERT mod-
els on the shared task examples, or collect more
GAP examples from different domains.

5 Conclusion

This paper describes the insights of shared task on
GAP coreference resolution held as part of the 1st
ACL workshop on Gender Bias in Natural Lan-
guage Processing. The task drew a generous prize
pool from Google and saw enthusiastic participa-
tion across a diverse set of researchers. Winning
systems made effective use of BERT and ensem-
bling, achieving near human accuracy and gender
parity despite little efforts targeted at mitigating
gender bias. We learned where the next research
challenges in gender-fair pronoun resolution lie,

as well as promising directions for testing the ro-
bustness of powerful language model pre-training
methods, especially BERT.
