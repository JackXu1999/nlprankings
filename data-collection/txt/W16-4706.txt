Abstract

The extraction of data exemplifying relations between terms can make use, at least to a large
extent, of techniques that are similar to those used in standard hybrid term candidate extraction,
namely basic corpus analysis tools (e.g. tagging, lemmatization, parsing), as well as morpholog-
ical analysis of complex words (compounds and derived items). In this article, we discuss the
use of such techniques for the extraction of raw material for a description of relations between
terms, and we provide internal evaluation data for the devices developed.
We claim that user-generated content is a rich source of term variation through paraphrasing and
reformulation, and that these provide relational data at the same time as term variants. Germanic
languages with their rich word formation morphology may be particularly good candidates for
the approach advocated here.

1 Introduction

While term candidate extraction from texts typically targets domain objects, a fuller domain model, as
needed for terminological, lexicographic or text classification purposes, requires in addition the provision
of data on hyponymy relations between domain objects (taxonomic relations), on properties of domain
objects and on events that involve these domain objects.

The objective of this paper is to provide an assessment of the applicability of standard state-of-the-art
computational linguistic tools for the task of extracting evidence from which taxonomic relations be-
tween domain objects, as well as events involving the domain objects can be derived. We work with
German data, but we expect most of our results to be generalizable to other Germanic languages. The
tools in question are (i) basic corpus preprocessing tools (tokenizing, pos-tagging, lemmatization, pars-
ing) as well as coreference resolution, (ii) query tools applicable to the preprocessed corpora and (iii)
word formation analyzers. We use these tools, because we also carry out term candidate extraction on the
basis of this same infrastructure and intend to explore to which degree one and the same standard hybrid
approach can be used both to extract term candidates and to extract evidence for relations between them.
In this paper, we do not address actual ontology construction.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the background of our ex-
periments: the text collection used, as well as the tools for pre-processing, data extraction and ranking
of term candidates. In Section 3, we discuss the extraction of evidence for relations between domain
objects, in terms of relevant linguistic phenomena, different extraction techniques and, for each one, first
evaluation results. Section 4 is structured in parallel to Section 3 and deals with raw material for verb-
derived events involving domain objects. A comparison with the state of the art follows in Section 5 and
we conclude in Section 6.

2 Background and objectives

2.1 Text basis
We use a corpus of German forum posts collected from several online forums in the domain of do-it-
yourself (DIY) projects, e.g. work with wood or stone. The posts have been contributed in part by

domain experts (giving e.g. advice on techniques, tools, etc.) and in part by end users describing their
own projects1. Alongside, we use texts from a few professional sources, such as an online encyclopedia
and a wiki for DIY work, tools and techniques. The corpus used for the work described here totals ca.
11 M words, with 20% expert text vs. 80% end-user data.

Forum data, as most user-generated content, presents properties of orality (in the sense of Koch and
Oesterreicher (1985)): greeting forms (hallo, tschüss), contracted forms (verb+pronoun: hamse for
haben sie etc.), orthographic, morphological and syntactic deviance. We also find elements typical of
computer-mediated communication, such as addressing (@Peter: ...) or emoticons. The texts contain
deviant orthography, spelling errors, compounds written in two chunks instead of one (Bohrer Spitze for
Bohrerspitze, drill bit) etc., covered partly by normalization at tokenizing time. We cannot yet quantify
the loss in recall due to these deviances, as far as e.g. parsing-based data extraction is concerned (cf.
however Section 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 for precision figures). Terminology in these texts is characterized (i)
by term variation ((morpho-) syntactic, in Daille (2007)’s terms) and (ii) by considerable amounts of
specialized terms also retrievable from conceptually oral texts2.

2.2 A standard hybrid term candidate extractor and its computational linguistic components

The extraction of relations between terms presupposes a preceding step of term candidate extraction.
Our system uses a standard hybrid approach (cf. Schäfer et al. (2015)): on the basis of either tagged and
lemmatized or of parsed text (“preprocessing” in Figure 1), it first applies symbolic patterns (pos-patterns
or (morpho-)syntactic patterns) to extract all candidates that follow a given pattern (“pattern search” in
Figure 1), before computing termhood measures (such as Ahmad et al. (1992)’s weirdness ratio) to rank
candidates by comparison with a general-language corpus (SdeWaC (Faaß and Eckart, 2013)). In the
standard term candidate extraction mode, domain experts are then asked to verify the term candidates.
Variant recognition is an optional part of the same architecture.

Figure 1: Steps in term candidate extraction: overview

The texts are tokenized and normalized (homogeneous orthography of e.g. numeric indications, cf.
60x40 cm), tagged and lemmatized using RFTagger (Schmid and Laws, 2008), and dependency parsed
using the mate parser (Bohnet, 2010). An automatic correction step is applied for lemmatization. De-
pendency parses are in addition annotated with phrase boundaries and heads, such that information cor-
responding to both techniques, constituent and dependency parsing, is available: the full verb of each
sentence, its subject and complements, as well as adjuncts and negation are annotated and thus retrievable
as context parameters.

An additional step of linguistic annotation is coreference resolution and discourse processing. We
use IMS HotCoref DE (Rösiger and Kuhn, 2016), a state-of-the-art coreference resolver for German.
In a post-processing step, we annotate personal, possessive, demonstrative and relative pronouns with
the closest non-pronominal antecedent identified by the resolver. Experiments on the use of coreference
resolution to enhance recall in the extraction of verbs and their arguments can be found in Section 4.2.3.

For compound splitting we use CompoST (Cap, 2014), a compound splitter which combines the use
of a rule-based morphology system (SMOR (Schmid et al., 2004)) with morpheme verification in cor-
pus data, thereby extending and improving on the approach proposed by Koehn and Knight (2003) for
statistical machine translation. For all components of a compound, including those which are complex
themselves, the tool verifies the presence and number of occurrences in a (set of) texts. In our application,
the do-it-yourself corpus is used as a knowledge source for this check, in addition to a (newspaper-based)
general language corpus. Splits that involve implausible or rare components are dispreferred.

1A typical forum of this type is “1-2-do.com”
2Work on quantifying the terminological richness of more vs. less oral/CMC texts is under way.

Pattern-based search on all levels, with the exception of coreference resolution, is performed by use
of the Corpus Workbench (CWB) system (Evert and Hardie, 2011).

2.3 Objective: Assessment of applicability for the extraction of evidence for relations
The architecture and tools described above may be combined to support the search and retrieval of
evidence for relations between objects and for events. The objective for the present article is to provide
an assessment of the precision of the standard tools when applied to relation extraction. An assessment
of recall requires the availability of gold standard data; while work on manual annotation of relations is
ongoing, this resource is not yet complete.

Figure 2 shows the collection of semantic relations for the exemplary term Bohrer (drill). The different
arrows represent the source of the semantic relation as well as its type. The remainder of the paper will
present the techniques used and evaluations of these techniques.

ciated events), dotted lines= GermaNet (hyponymy). Not included due to space restrictions are verbs
and their arguments.

3 Identifying relations between domain objects

3.1 Relevant phenomena
Taxonomic relations between domain objects: Taxonomic (= hyponymy) relations can be extracted
from definition-like sentences (“an X is a Y which ...”) and from list-like enumerations (“Xs, such as
Y1, Y2 ...”), as first discussed for English by Hearst (1992). Such relations may also be extracted from
parsed text by use of verbal predicates which denote class membership (e.g. gehören zu (“belong to”),
zählen zu (“be part of”) etc.).

Similarly, determinative compounds can be interpreted as hyponyms of their morphological heads
(Band|säge→ Säge, “band|saw”→ “saw”).

Figure 3: A subset of relations found for Bohrer using Hearst patterns; arrows indicate a relation of
hyponymy, e.g. “Bohrer is-a Schneidewerkzeug”.

Figures 3 and 4 show an exemplary subset of taxonomic relations for the term Bohrer (drill). The
figures show partial hierarchies derived from result data of each procedure. As Figure 4 shows, no

43



Figure 4: A subset of relations found for Bohrer by compound analysis; arrows indicate a relation of
hyponymy, e.g. “Holzbohrer is-a Bohrer”.

inferencing or synonym search has yet been applied (we consider such techniques to be part of the
actual ontology construction work), so that e.g. 10er-Bohrer and 10-mm-Bohrer are not identified as
synonymous, and Akkubohrer is not related with Akkuschlagbohrer.

Non-taxonomic relations between domain objects: In our texts, many compound terms are para-
phrased by means of NP+PP constructions where the preposition makes the relation explicit which exists
between the compound head and its modifier. Obviously, prepositions themselves may be ambiguous,
in unrestricted contexts, with respect to the relation they indicate; this problem is however less acute
within the discourse domain of DIY projects (“one sense per discourse”): the most frequent paraphrase
tends to be the adequate one.

Thus, we get, for example, corpus occurrences for both, compounds and their paraphrases:

- Kupferschraube↔ Schraube aus Kupfer (material: “copper screw”)
- Befestigungsschraube↔ Schraube zur Befestigung (purpose: “fixation screw”)
- Senkkopfschraube↔ Schraube mit Senkkopf (property (or: part/whole): “countersunk screw”)

Figure 5: A subset of relations found by assigning compounds NP+PP paraphrases; arrows indicate
quasi-synonymy, e.g. “Holzbohrer equals Bohrer für Holz.

Alongside the isa-relation (“copper screw”→ “screw”), we can thus also extract further meaningful
relations from paraphrases of compounds, cf. Figure 5. The same holds for complex NPs (Holz der Fichte
↔ Holz aus Fichte (↔ Fichtenholz), “spruce wood”). Obviously, some ambiguity remains: Holzfarbe
may be paraphrased by Farbe von Holz (“color of wood”), as well as by Farbe für Holz (“color applicable
to wood(en surfaces)”).

3.2 Extraction and evaluation
3.2.1 Hearst-type sentences
To verify the applicability of Hearst (1992)’s approach, we implemented a German version of the clas-
sical hypernym patterns. We reproduce abstract queries (shown here in a simplified regular expression
notation) in the following (where Nsup is the superordinate, Nsub the subordinate term3):

– Nsub1 , Nsub2 (und|oder) (ander.*|vergleichbar.*|sonstig.*|weiter.*) (Adj)? Nsup
– (Adj)? Nsup (,)? insbesondere (Adj)? Nsub

3The German conjunctions, adjectives and adverbs are, in sequential order “and|or”, “other”,“comparable”, “further”; “in
particular”; “including”; “such as”, “and|or|as well as”.

44



– (Adj)? Nsup (,)? einschließlich (Adj)? Nsub
– (Adi) Nsupwie Nsub1 (,)? Nsub2 ((’und|oder|sowie’) (Adj) Nsub3))*

The patterns are not mere translations of the original English patterns, but have been carefully adapted
to German, including many additional constraints on the part-of-speech and lemma level to filter out
wrong candidates. For example, while the EN version of pattern four (Nsup such as Nsub) is highly
effective, the German adaptation results in many wrong pairs, as in Hubzahl wie für Baustahl (“stroke
frequency as (used) for structural steel”). Thus, we excluded e.g. results where “wie” was followed by a
preposition.

Parsing is not required to identify these patterns; they can equally well be extracted from POS-tagged
and lemmatized data. However, for the extraction of verbal predicates which denote class membership
we have also implemented an extraction from parsed text. There, we search for the two predicates zählen
(“be part of”) and gehören (“belong to”) and extract the head of their p-object as the hypernym while the
head of the subject is considered to be the hyponym. We also extract predicate constructions in the form
of (Xsub is a Ysup).

In a first evaluation, we only evaluated the POS-based nominal patterns described above. We are
currently planning an evaluation of the verbal patterns4.

We evaluated the top 200 search result pairs sorted by frequency regarding the question whether the
hyponymy relation holds. This is true for 163 out of the 200 pairs, i.e. the accuracy of this technique is
about 82%. Errors typically occur in pairs extracted by the fourth pattern, e.g. as in Unterschied wie Tag
und Nacht (“difference as night and day”).

In a second version, we filtered out pairs in which none of the two nouns is a term (i.e. not in the gold
standard list), sorted by frequency. We then performed a two-fold evaluation. In the first step, we looked
at the validity of the hyponymy relation: do the pairs establish plausible hyponym-hypernym pairs. Out
of 200 pairs, 164 were considered valid (82% accuracy). Regarding the question whether the pairs are
also domain relevant, 151 out of the 164 valid pairs turned out to be domain relevant (92%).

Overall, the impression in our data is that the quality of the extracted pairs is acceptable, and many of
the pairs are relevant for our domain5.

3.2.2 Compounds
Compound analysis for taxonomic relations We split compounds using the compound splitting tool
CompoST (Cap, 2014), see above. We consider the head as the superordinate, and the compounds as
subtypes of their heads: Säge (saw) has subordinates such as Kreissäge (buzz saw), Bandsäge (bandsaw).
The implementation is aware of complex non-heads, i.e. we check for attested morpheme combinations
in our specialized corpus as well as in a large general language corpus to exclude wrong splits. For
example, for Eigenbaubandsäge (“self-constructed bandsaw”), we first split into morphemes (Eigen|
bau | band | säge) and then check for attested combinations: Bandsäge (valid, found), Baubandsäge (not
found), Eigenbau-X (valid, found), resulting in the correct split Eigenbau| Bandsäge.

A script sorts all heads together with their compounds and builds a partial hierarchical structure for
every head. An example hierarchy is given in Figure 4.

While these hierarchies have not yet been evaluated, their accuracy is solely dependent on the perfor-
mance of the compound splitting tool. We are currently planning a comparative evaluation of several
compound splitting tools to assess the quality of the compound splits. Overall, the impression when
looking at a small set of these hierarchies is that they very rarely contain wrong hyponyms.

Compound analysis and paraphrases for non-taxonomic relations We acquire paraphrases for
compounds of the form Noun1+Noun2 with nominal heads by querying Noun2+preposition+Noun1 or
Noun2+determiner+Noun1 (in genitive case) in the 11M corpus. Finding nominal paraphrases for heads
and non-heads of compounds helps us determine the relation between the parts of the compound. It
can also help us disambiguate between possibly ambiguous relations, e.g. to decide whether a drill is

Metallbohrer (metal drill) Bohrer für Metall (for) purpose
Diamantbohrer (diamond drill) Bohrer aus Diamant (made of) material

Kellerraum (basement room) Raum im Keller (in) location
Schutzfolie (protection film) Folie zum Schutz (for) purpose
Aluprofil (aluminium profile) Profil aus Alu (made of) material
Pendelhubstichsäge (scroll jigsaw) *Stichsäge ohne Pendelhub (without) –
Wasserhaus (water house) *Haus unter Wasser (under) –

Table 1: Some exemplary paraphrases found in our data and the relations they indicate

(partially) made of a certain material (Diamantbohrer – Bohrer aus Diamant, diamond drill- drill made
of diamond) or used to drill a specific material (Steinbohrer – Bohrer für Stein, stone drill - drill made
for drilling stone). Further examples are given in Table 1. We indicate the compound, the paraphrase
found in the corpus and the relation inferred by rule from the preposition. Certain prepositions, like for
example ohne (without), are excluded as they almost never lead to relevant paraphrases.

In a precision-based evaluation, we manually evaluated the top 200 paraphrase-compound pairs, sorted
by compound frequency. 157 out of 200 candidate paraphrases were valid paraphrases, resulting in 79%
type accuracy. Errors are mainly due to implausible prepositions, such as Rest im Holz (rest in the wood)
for Holzrest (scrap wood). Taking into account the frequencies of the paraphrases for every compound,
814 paraphrases out of 959 total paraphrase occurrences turned out to be valid paraphrases, resulting in
a token accuracy of 85%.

4 Identifying events involving domain objects

4.1 Relevant phenomena
Predicate+argument-structures To find events involving the domain objects, we extract predicates
and their subjects and complements as well as context information in the form of negation and adverbs.

Based on dependency output as produced by mate (Bohnet, 2010), we can extract the following cate-
gories:

• Verb object pairs:
Holz bohren (to drill wood), einen Kreis bohren (to drill a circle), ...

• Subject verb pairs:
Holz verzieht sich (wood warps), eine Absaugeeinrichtung spart Zeit (a suction device saves time)

• Verb-dependent and adjunct PPs:
auf Gehrung sägen (to miter), für Stabilität sorgen (to ensure stability),
mit der Stichsäge ausschneiden (to cut with a jigsaw)

• Negation:
die Sicherheitskappe nicht abziehen (do not remove the safety cap)

• Adverbs:
heiß verleimen (to hot glue), trocken reiben (to rub dry), dünn beschichten (to coat thinly)

• Predicative constructions: X is Y (Y can be adjectival or nominal):
Bohrer ist ein Elektrowerkzeug (drill is a power tool)
Spitze ist besonders dünn (tip is very thin)

We can also combine these extractors to search for longer patterns, including negation or adverbs.
Subj V Obj: Holzspiralbohrer haben eine lange Zentrierspitze (wood drills have long lathe centers);
Subj V PP: Beton besteht aus Zement und Wasser (concrete is made of cement and water) ;
Subj V Obj +Negation:Kupfer benötigt keinen schützenden Anstrich (copper requires no protective coat).

46



Verb-derived items as a source of relational data Many morphologically complex words are derived
from verbal (or adjectival) predicates. German is rich in noun compounds whose heads are nominal-
izations of verbs or adjectives (e.g. Holzoberflächengestaltung “design of wooden surface(s)”, Anwend-
barkeit der Magnetfarbe “applicability of magnetic colour”). Compound participles are equally pro-
ductive and allow for an analysis of the underlying verbal element in terms of its predicate-argument
structure (cf. alumimiumbeschichtete Oberfläche, “aluminium-coated surface”).
Also here, the combination of compound splitting and search in syntactically annotated data pro-
vides pairs of terms and their paraphrases, where the latter make the relations explicit that exist be-
tween the items involved (see Figure 6). Alongside the above mentioned complex NPs, we also
find verb+complement constructions, such as HolzoberflächeObj+ gestalten (to design a wooden sur-
face), MagnetfarbeObj+anwenden (apply magnetic color) or OberflächeObj+ mit Aluminium beschichten
(coat surface with aluminium). We exploit not only verb+object pairs, but also verb+PP groups, sub-
ject+verb groups and predicative constructions. In all cases, we start from morphologically complex
items and search their paraphrases. In addition, paraphrase patterns can also be exploited, in the sense
of “knowledge-rich contexts” (Meyer, 2001) as models or types of events with instances which do not
correspond, in the available data, to morphologically complex items: compound participles of the type
aluminiumbeschichtet correspond to a pattern such as X[agent] beschichtet Y[target] mit Z[coating],
where the expressions in brackets are taken to be informally noted participant roles similar to Frame
Elements of FrameNet (cf. Ruppenhofer et al. (2013)) . This pattern provides a large number of pairs of
domain objects related by the ad-hoc relation “coated with”, most of which are relevant for the domain
and correctly recognized6.

arrows indicate a corresponding event.

4.2 Extraction and evaluation
4.2.1 Verb and object
This section describes the evaluation of verb object pairs, such as Dübelloch bohren (drill dowel hole),
Sägeblatt verwenden (use saw blade), or Fliesen verlegen (lay tiles).

We first evaluated whether the extracted verb object pairs are syntactically valid. Thus, we manually
checked the top 250 pairs ranked according to their termhood measure (in this case: domain specificity
value (Ahmad et al., 1992)), only looking at pairs with a frequency > 5. The decision is made given
an example sentence. Out of the 250 top pairs, 15 are syntactically invalid due to pre-processing and
parsing errors. This means that 94% of the extracted pairs are syntactically plausible. Therefore, the
parsing quality, although not trained on data from the DIY domain, seems well-suited as a basis to
extract data.

A second evaluation looks at the question of domain relevance. Again, we analyze the 250 top ranking
pairs V-O candidate pairs sorted by the ranking measure, excluding the verbs haben, sein and geben
(have, be, give). The decision in this case was made between the categories “term”, “no term” and “pre-
processing error”. 27 errors occurred (10%) due to preprocessing or parsing errors. 150 out of the 250
candidates are good terms (60%), whereas 73 bad terms (30%) are not relevant for our domain. Bad
terms very often occur only because part of the subcategorization of the verb has not been covered by
the extraction pattern, such as in
Werfen Sie Elektrowerkzeuge nicht in den Hausmüll⇒ElektrowerkzeugeOBJ+werfen V

6An evaluation is ongoing. Results will be available by December.

47



(Do not throw power tools into the trash⇒ throwV+ power toolsOBJ)
These cases can be excluded by using longer patterns involving PPs and negation. Sometimes, the area
between terms and non-terms is blurred, e.g. in Alurohr umdrehen (turn aluminium tubes), Fliesenkleber
benötigen (require tile cement), Kochfeld einbauen (assemble hob). While these may not be top terms,
they definitely are not general terms, either.

4.2.2 Verb and p-object
We performed a top 200 precision-based evaluation, assessing the verb PP pairs according to the question
whether the pairs are syntactically valid. We found that 191 of 200 are syntactically plausible, resulting
in an accuracy of 96%.
Most of the extracted pairs are very relevant to the domain, such as

für festen Halt sorgen (ensure stability), zum Lieferumfang gehören (belong to delivered items), auf
Gehrung sägen (to miter), mit Kies beschweren (weigh down with gravel), auf Rechtwinkligkeit achten
(ensure perpendicularity).

Almost all bad pairs are PP attachment problems, such as in Ich suche ein Gerät mit Akkubetrieb (I’m
looking for a device with battery operation) – [suchen mit Akkubetrieb]. The user generated content is
also clearly visible in the extracted pairs, for example in um einen Hammer abwerten – Ich werte um
einen Hammer ab wegen der schlechten Bedienung (Giving this one hammer less due to bad usability)
or in an die Schraube glauben – Ich glaube an die Schraube (I believe in this screw).

4.2.3 The role of coreference resolution
for the enhancement of recall in the extraction of predicate argument structures
Many times, arguments of verbs are pronominalized. In order to make use of them for relation extraction,
we need to resolve them using a coreference resolver. Thus, we performed some experiments on the
use of a state-of-the-coreference resolver (IMS HotCoref (Rösiger and Kuhn, 2016)) for verb object
extraction. Coreference resolution in user-generated texts is considered difficult, as there is a decrease in
performance of the pre-processing tools when they are used on non-standard data. We only evaluate the
quality of coreference resolution indirectly, by looking at the verb object pairs extracted.
We found that, in our data, about 40% of the verb object pairs contained pronominalized objects. One
assumption about using coreference resolution therefore was that we can get more candidate pairs. This
is true, as the number of verb object pairs rose from 3996 to 4189 candidates (+5%). We further checked
whether the newly found candidates are good candidates. We found 82% of the 193 new candidates
relevant to the domain, e.g. 120er-Schleifpapier verwenden (use 120-grit sandpaper), 6-mm-Loch bohren
(drill 6-mm hole). We also found more evidence for pairs already retrieved from the version without
coreference resolution, in the form of higher frequencies. We expect the assumptions proven to be true
for verb object pairs to be true for other arguments as well, such as subjects or p-objects.
4.2.4 Compound analysis and verbal paraphrases
For compounds with nominalized verbs as heads, we can search for verbs and their respective object as
the non-head of the compound. If we find a match, this is evidence that the compound describes an event
corresponding to the verb and its object.

Compound Paraphrase
Abflussreiniger (drain cleaner) Abfluss reinigen (clear drain)
Bodendämmung (floor insulation) Boden dämmen (insulate floors)
Fensterisolierung (window insulation) Fenster isolieren (insulate windows)
Betonbohrung (concrete drilling) Beton bohren (drill concrete)
Leimverteilung (paste distribution) Leim verteilen (distribute paste)

We evaluated the 125 most frequent and the 125 least frequent compounds for which a verb+object
paraphrase was found with respect to the question whether the verb object-paraphrase was valid for the
given compound. The analysis of the top 125 resulted in an accuracy of 74%, for the bottom 125 the
accuracy was 82%.

5 Related work

Our work applies a set of strategies that have been introduced in the literature on German user-generated
and expert text. Corpus-driven ontology creation has been proposed in many papers, e.g. in Barrière
(2004), Auger and Barrière (2008) or Manser (2012), to name only a few. However, to the best of our
knowledge, we are not aware of any papers that test and extend these strategies on German texts.

Similar to our strategy is the approach by Gillam et al. (2005) which is also based on hybrid termi-
nology extraction; cf. also Drouin (2003)’s approach. They apply a number of collocation and linguistic
patterns to extract relations between terms from specialized English texts. Arnold and Rahm (2014) ex-
tract semantic concept relations for German terms from Wikipedia definitions. However, this approach is
dependent on Wikipedia sites (i.e. expert text) and not easily applicable to user-generated text. Joslyn et
al. (2008) present a distributional semantics approach, where they apply the lattice theoretical technology
of Formal Concept Analysis to relations of predicates extracted from a corpus. Even though 11M words
is a comparatively “large” amount of material for specialized texts, it may not necessarily be enough for
a distributional approach. We also intend to be able to work on smaller corpora.

There are many papers building on the patterns described by Hearst (1992). In the approach by Snow
et al. (2005), hypernym-hyponym-pairs are collected firstly by using WordNet. Then a corpus is used to
find sentences in which both nouns of the pair occur. The dependency paths of the matched sentences
are extracted and used as features for a classifier to determine if an unseen pair of nouns describes
a taxonomic relation. Fundel et al. (2007) focus on the extraction of biomedical relations, e.g. the
interaction between proteins. Dependency paths connecting the proteins of a given pair are extracted
before a set of rules for filtering information is applied. This, of course, extracts relations beyond standard
taxonomic ones, such as “A regulates B”, but the dependency parse based approach is also applicable
on the hypernym-hyponym pair detection. Maynard et al. (2009) differentiate between instance-class
and subclass-superclass relations. Only persons, organizations and locations are considered as instances
whereas other noun phrases are classes, extracted by patterns including “classification verbs” like fall
into, group into or contain (cf. zählen, gehören zu, above). Zouaq et al. (2012) claim that the extraction
of relations with lexico-syntactic patterns is an important basic step in structuring data that requires post-
processing steps of filtering operations. Their patterns are classified into hierarchical relation patterns
(also reusing Hearst Patterns) and patterns for conceptual relationships. e.g. verb (subject, object)-
relations. Evaluations showed that the hierarchical patterns achieved the highest precision without post-
processing of the results.

The approach described in Ritter et al. (2009) also starts with the extraction of relations using Hearst
Patterns. They then filter the matches by using different methods. As applying a frequency based classi-
fier is not sufficient, a SVM classifier is implemented to rate every extracted pair in terms of correctness.
As features, a variety of frequencies is used. Finally, they develop an HMM language model to make an
evaluation possible even if a certain noun does not have a match with any of the Hearst Patterns.

6 Conclusions and future work

We presented a set of techniques to acquire semantic relations between terms and showed that overall, one
can achieve acceptable precision when applying standard tools to relation extraction. Future work will
include more morpho-syntactic patterns to extract such relations, as well as external knowledge sources
such as e.g. BabelNet. While our work focused on precision-based evaluations of highly frequent cases
for the single techniques, more detailed evaluations are planned on the combination of the approaches
presented here, as well as the creation of a gold standard, to also be able to assess recall.
