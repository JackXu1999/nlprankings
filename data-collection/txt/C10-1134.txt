Introduction

In recent years, sentiment analysis has attracted
considerable attention in the NLP community. It
is the task of mining positive and negative
opinions from natural language, which can be
applied to many research fields. Previous work
on this problem falls into three groups: opinion
mining of documents, sentiment classification of
sentences and polarity prediction of words.

The most frequently explored task at the word
level is to determine the polarity of words, in
which most work centers on assigning a prior
polarity to words or word senses in the lexicon
out of context. However, for some words, the
polarity varies strongly with context, making it
hard to attach each to a fixed sentiment category
in the lexicon. For example, the word “low”has
a positive orientation in “low cost” but a
negative orientation in “low salary”. We call
these words
like “low” dynamic sentiment

Littman (2003) claim that DSAAs cannot be

unfortunately, DSAAs are discarded by most
research concerning sentiment analysis.

real-world

In this paper, we

are devoted to the
challenging task of disambiguating DSAAs. The
task is to automatically determine the semantic
orientation (SO) of DSAAs within context. We
limit our work to 14 frequently used adjectives
in Chinese, such as “large, small, many, few,
high,
low”, which all have the meaning of
measurement. Although the number of such
ambiguous adjectives is not
they are
frequently used in real text, especially in the
texts expressing opinions and emotions. As
demonstrated by the experimental results in this
paper,
the disambiguation of 14 DSAAs can
obviously improve the performance of sentiment
classification of product reviews.

The task of disambiguating DSAAs is reduced
to sentiment classification of nouns. Previous
studies classify nouns into three categories:

2.1 Word-level Sentiment Analysis
Recently there has been extensive research in
sentiment analysis, for which Pang and Lee
(2008) give an in-depth survey of literature.
Closer to our study is the large body of work on
automatic
words
(Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Turney
and Littman, 2003; Kim and Hovy, 2004;
Andreevskaia
but
unfortunately they all discard DSAAs in their
research. In recent years, some studies go a step
further, attaching SO to senses instead of word
forms (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006; Wiebe and
Mihalcea, 2006; Su and Markert 2008), but their
work is still limited in lexicon out of context.

Bergler,

2006),

The most relevant work is Ding et al. (2008),
in which DSAAs are named as
context
dependant opinions. They argue that there is no
way to know the SO of DSAAs without prior
knowledge, and asking a domain expert
to
provider such knowledge is scalable. They adopt
a holistic lexicon-based approach to solve this
problem, which exploits external
information
and evidences in other sentences and other
reviews. On the contrary in this paper, we obtain
the prior knowledge of a product by mining the
web, and then use such knowledge to determine
the SO of DSAAs. The prior knowledge of a
product, which is closer
to the sentiment
expectation of nouns described in this paper, is

an important research issue in itself and has
many applications in sentiment analysis, as
discussed in section 3.2.

Pattern-based Method

2.3
Previous
studies have applied pattern-based
method to sentiment analysis (Riloff and Wiebe,
2003; Wiebe et al., 2004; Riloff et al., 2005;
Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006; Andreevskaia and
Berger; 2006). The differences with our method
lie in two aspects: the used resources (corpus
versus web) and the research target (subjective
expressions versus sentiment expectation).

2.4 Character-based Method
Chinese characters carry semantic information
that is indicative of semantic properties of words.
Previous studies have exploited the character-
based model to predict the semantic categories
of Chinese unknown words (Chen, 2004; Lu,
2007). Yuen et al. (2004) presents a method to

words. The work by Ku et al. (2006) is similar to
ours because they also define the sentiment score
of a word by its composite characters. However,
their algorithm is based only on frequency, while
we exploit point mutual
information that can
capture the character-sentiment association.

3 Determining SO of Adjective by

Target Noun

3.1 Classification of DSAAs
The frequently used DSAAs are given below.
We group them into two categories: positive-like
adjectives and negative-like adjectives. These
adjectives are neutral out of context, but positive
or negative emotion will be evoked when they
co-occur with some target nouns, making it hard
to assign each to a fixed sentiment category in
lexicon.
(1) Positive-like adjectives (Pa) = {大 da|large,
多 duo|many, 高 gao|high, 厚 hou|thick, 深
shen|deep, 重 zhong|heavy, 巨大 ju-da|huge, 重
大 zhong-da|great}
(2) Negative-like adjectives (Na) ={小
xiao|small, 少 shao |few, 低 di|low, 薄 bao|thin,
浅 qian|shallow, 轻 qing|light}

Sentiment Expectation of Noun

3.2
The SO of most DSAAs can be determined by
target nouns in noun-adjective phrases, as shown
in Table 1. For example, the word “high”has a
positive orientation when the target noun is
“salary” but a negative orientation when the
target noun is “price”. Therefore, the task can be
reduced to sentiment classification of nouns.
Positive

工资高|salary is high

assigned as neutral, as the two terms are

noun to be bigger, higher or happen frequently.
On the contrary, for a negative expectation noun,
people usually expect the thing referred to by the
noun to be smaller, lower or don’t happen . For
example, “价 格 jia-ge|price” is a negative
expectation noun, as most people in most cases
expect
the product prices become low,
whereas “工 资 gong-zi|salary” is a positive
expectation noun, as most people in most cases
their salaries become high. The

(negative) terms correspond to positive (negative)
expectation terms, but some neutral terms may

traditional

Su and Markert (2008) argue that polarity can
also be attached to objective words. The
difference with our scheme is that, for example,
“价 格 jia-ge|price” is attached to negative
expectation in our scheme while is still neutral in
Su and Markert’s method.

The distinction between positive and negative
expectation nouns is vital to determine the SO of
some phrases. Using it to disambiguate DSAAs
is a good example. Another application is the
phrase containing verbs with the meaning of
status change. For example, “工资上涨了|salary
has been raised” will evoke positive emotion,
while “价格上涨了 jiage-shangzhang-le|prices
have gone up”will evoke negative emotion. As
far as we are aware, this is the first sentiment
analysis scheme that tries to exploit people’s
expectation towards nouns.

3.3 Determination of DSAAs
The SO of DSAAs in a given phrase can be
calculated by Eq. (1).

C(a) =

C(n) =

1
if a is positive-like


-1 if a is negative-like

1
if n is positive expectation


-1 if n is negative expectation


(1)

SO(a)=C(a)*C(n)
If adverb=“不 bu|not”, SO(a)= -SO(a)
Where C(a) denotes the category of DSAAs; C(n)
denotes the sentiment expectation of nouns;
SO(a) is the SO of DSAAs in a give noun-
adjective phrase. When the adverb is
the
negation term “不 bu|not”, the SO is reversed.

For example:

The pattern “<n> 有点 <a>” carries a strong

a man is saying “工资有点低| Salary is a little
low”,
indicates that he wishes his “工 资

man is saying “价格有点高| price is a little
high”, it
indicates that he wishes “价格 |price”
to go down. As a result, “工 资 |salary” has
positive expectation while “价 格 |price” has
negative expectation.

Using

But the sentiment expectation of some nouns
cannot be predicted with the pattern-based
method, mainly due to the reason that
these
nouns don’t occur in the listed patterns in Table
2. An alternate way is to exploit the semantic
knowledge of Chinese characters. It is assumed
that there is a strong association between the
sentiment category of a word and its component
characters. For example, the three words “罪恶
zui’e|evil, 罪 行
zuixing|crime, 罪 过
zuiguo|fault”, which all contain the character “罪
zui|sin” that carries negative meaning, are all
negative expectation nouns.

Chinese Gigaword (Second Edition) released by
LDC. The texts were
automatically word-
segmented and POS-tagged using the open
software ICTCLAS4. In order to concentrate on
the disambiguation of DSAAs, and reduce the
noise introduced by the parser, we extracted
sentences containing strings in pattern of (7),
where the target noun is modified by the
adjective in most cases.

(7) noun+adverb+adjective (adjective∈DSAAs)
e.g. 成本/n 较/d 低/a | the cost is low.

Another small part of data was extracted from
the Web. Using the search engine Google5, we

DSAAs in the data were assigned as positive,
independently by two
negative or neutral,
annotators. Since we focus on the distinction
between positive and negative categories,
the
neutral instances were removed. Table 5 gives
statistics of the data, and the inter-annotator
agreement is in a high level with a kappa of 0.91.
After cases with disagreement were negotiated
between the two annotators, a gold standard
annotation was agreed upon. In this paper, 3066
instances were divided randomly into three parts,
1/3 of which were used as the development data,
and 2/3 were the test data.

The proposed methods in this paper all yield
results that are substantially better than two
types of baseline. The pattern-based method, as
straightforward as it is, achieves promising result
with an f-score of 73.69%, which is 12.49%
higher than the simple baseline. The pattern-

method (combined) by 4.82% in precision and
0.73% in recall. The performance of
the
character-based method based on Sentiment
BaiduHit
is competitive with that based on
Sentiment HowNet, which again proves the
effectiveness of the pattern-based method. The
character-based method combining the two
lexicons outperforms each lexicon with small

classification of product reviews. Following the
work of Wan (2008), we selected the same
dataset. The dataset contains 886 Chinese
product reviews, which are manually annotated
with polarity labels: positive or negative. Also,
the files are automatically word-segmented and
POS-tagged using ICTCLAS. We extracted the
files that contain the following strings, where the
nouns are modified by DSAAs in most cases.

5.2.2 Methods
Our goal is not to propose a new method, but
instead to test the performance gain by adding
the disambiguation of DSAAs. We adopted the
same algorithm with Wan (2008), and also used
Sentiment-HowNet. But
in our experiment,
Negation_Dic contains only one term “不
bu|not”, for the sake of repeatable experiments.

The baseline algorithm is illustrated by the
non-italic part in Figure 1, where we set the
parameters with Wan’s
same
approach:
PosValue=1, NegValue=-2, q=2, ρ=2.

We added the disambiguation of DSAAs to
the algorithm, as illustrated by the italic part in
Figure 1. When a word is a DSAA, compute its
SO with the proposed integrated method, rather
than using its prior polarity specified in HowNet.
For Dy_PosValue and Dy_NegValue, we first set
Dy_PosValue=1 and Dy_NegValue=-2, just the
same as PosValue and NegValue. In the second
attempt, in order to further intensify the polarity
of DSAAs, we set Dy_PosValue=1.5 and
Dy_NegValue=-2.5. Other parameters were set
the same as baseline.

Algorithm Compute_SO:
1. Tokenize document d into sentence set S, and each
sentence s∈S is tokenized into word set Ws;
2. For any word w in a sentence s∈S, compute its
value SO(w) as follows:

1) if w∈DSAAs, compute SO(w) with the

integrated method.

If SO(w)=1, SO(w)=Dy_PosValue;
If SO(w)=-1, SO(w)=Dy_NegValue;

2) if w∈Positive_Dict, SO(w)=PosValue;
3) If w∈Negative_Dict, SO(w)=NegValue;
4) Otherwise, SO(w)=0;
5) Within the window of q words previous to w, if

there is a term w'∈Negation_Dict,
SO(w)= –SO(w);

6) Within the window of q words previous to w, if

there is a term w'∈Intensifier_Dict,

Table 7: The experimental results at document level

As an example, the following review, which
consists of only one sentence,
is correctly
classified as positive by DSAAs method, but is
classified as negative by the baseline approach.
(10) 体 积 小 , 重 量 轻 ,

携 带 很

便 。

| Small size, light weight, and easy to carry.

According to HowNet, as shown in Table 8, the
sentence contains
two negative words “小
|small”and “轻|light”and one positive word “方
便 fangbian|easy”, resulting the overall negative
prediction. In our approach, “体积 tiji|size”and
“重 量 zhongliang|weight” are assigned as
negative expectation, and consequently both “体
积小|small size”and “重量轻|light weight”have

positive meaning, resulting the overall positive
prediction.
Pos. 大 |large, 高 |high, 厚 |thick, 深 |deep,

重|heavy, 重大|great

Neg. 小 |small, 低 |low, 薄 |thin, 浅 |shallow,

轻|light

OOV 多|many, 少|few, 巨大|huge
Table 8: The SO of DSAAs described in HowNet

Adding the disambiguation of DSAAs, our
method obviously outperforms the baseline by
4.44% in f-score and 8.02% in accuracy. The
improvement
is especially obvious.
When intensifying the polarity of DSAAs by
setting Dy_PosValue=1.5 and Dy_NegValue=-
2.5, the recall is improved by 9.26% for positive
category and 6.73% for negative category.
