Abstract

Across disciplines, researchers are eager to
gain insight into empirical features of abstract
vs. concrete concepts. In this work, we pro-
vide a detailed characterisation of the distri-
butional nature of abstract and concrete words
across 16,620 English nouns, verbs and ad-
jectives. Specifically, we investigate the fol-
lowing questions: (1) What is the distribu-
tion of concreteness in the contexts of con-
crete and abstract target words? (2) What are
the differences between concrete and abstract
words in terms of contextual semantic diver-
sity? (3) How does the entropy of concrete
and abstract word contexts differ? Overall, our
studies show consistent differences in the dis-
tributional representation of concrete and ab-
stract words, thus challenging existing theories
of cognition and providing a more fine-grained
description of their nature.

1 Introduction

The complete understanding of the cognitive
mechanisms behind the processing of concrete
and abstract meanings represents a key and still
open question in cognitive science (Barsalou and
Wiemer-Hastings, 2005). More specifically, the
psycholinguistic literature reports extensive analy-
ses of how concrete concepts are processed, how-
ever there is still little consensus about the na-
ture of abstract concepts (Barsalou and Wiemer-
Hastings, 2005; McRae and Jones, 2013; Hill
et al., 2014; Vigliocco et al., 2014).

The Context Availability Theory represents one
of the earliest theoretical approaches aiming to ac-
count for the differences between concrete and
abstract concepts (Schwanenflugel and Shoben,
1983). This theory suggests that meaning arises
from the ability to create an appropriate context
for a concept, which has proven to be more chal-
lenging (i.e., enforcing higher reaction times and

larger number of errors) for abstract than for con-
crete concepts. In a computational study, Hill
et al. (2014) quantitatively analysed the distinc-
tion between concrete and abstract words in a
large corpus. Overall, they showed that abstract
words occur within a broad range of context words
while concrete words occur within a smaller set of
context words. Similarly, Hoffman et al. (2013)
and Hoffman and Woollams (2015) analysed the
concrete vs. abstract dichotomy in terms of their
semantic diversity, demonstrating that concrete
words occur within highly similar contexts while
abstract words occur in a broad range of less asso-
ciated contexts (i.e., exhibiting high semantic di-
versity). These computational findings are fully
in line with the Context Availability Theory: the
processing time of concrete words is generally
shorter than the processing time of abstract words,
as abstract words are attached to a broad range of
loosely associated words.

More recently, embodied theories of cogni-
tion have suggested that word meanings are
grounded in the sensory-motor system (Barsa-
lou and Wiemer-Hastings, 2005; Glenberg and
Kaschak, 2002; Hill et al., 2014; Pecher et al.,
2011). According to this account, concrete con-
cepts have a direct referent in the real world,
while abstract concepts have to activate a series of
concrete concepts that provide the necessary sit-
uational context required to successfully process
their meanings (Barsalou, 1999).

These interdisciplinary outcomes are not fully
supported by recent computational studies show-
ing different contextual patterns for concrete and
abstract words in text compared to the literature
(Bhaskar et al., 2017; Frassinelli et al., 2017). It
is becoming clear, however, that the inclusion of
information regarding the concreteness of words
plays a key role in the automatic identification of
non-literal language usage (Turney et al., 2011;

76



Köper and Schulte im Walde, 2016, 2017).
The aim of the current study is thus to provide

a contextual description of the distributional rep-
resentation of these two classes of words, to gain
insight into empirical features of abstract vs. con-
crete concepts. This would represent an essential
contribution to the resolution of the debate about
meaning representation within the human mind,
and thereby also help to enhance computationally
derived models that are concerned with meaning
derivation from text.

2 Hypotheses

Based on the existing psycholinguistic and com-
putational evidence reported in the previous sec-
tion, we formulate three hypotheses regarding
the distributional nature of concrete and abstract
words that we will test in the following studies.

(1) The contexts of both concrete and abstract
words are mainly composed of concrete
words.

This first hypothesis directly tests the general
claim of grounding theories: both concrete and
abstract words require the activation of a layer
of situational (concrete) information in order to
be successfully processed (Barsalou and Wiemer-
Hastings, 2005). According to the Distributional
Hypothesis (Harris, 1954; Firth, 1968), similar lin-
guistic contexts tend to imply similar meanings of
words. Thus, we suggest to perform a distribu-
tional semantic analysis in order to quantitatively
investigate the contexts that concrete and abstract
words frequently co-occur within.

(2) Abstract words occur in a broad range of dis-
tinct contexts whereas concrete words appear
in a limited set of contexts.

Based on the computational study by Hill et al.
(2014), we expect to find concrete words appear-
ing in a more restricted set of contexts in compar-
ison to abstract words, which should occur in a
broad range of contexts. This second hypothesis
is explored by providing two fine-grained analyses
of the extension and variety in contexts of concrete
and abstract words.

(3) Abstract words are more difficult to predict
than concrete words, due to their higher con-
textual variability.

Building upon the previous hypothesis and on the
studies by Hoffman et al. (2013) and Hoffman and
Woollams (2015), we aim to show that concrete
words are easier to predict than abstract words.
Specifically, we expect higher entropy values for
abstract than for concrete contexts, indicating that
on average, we need more information to uniquely
encode an abstract word than a concrete word
(Shannon, 2001). The reason resides within the
high context variability of abstract words: there is
a large number of highly probable words satisfy-
ing these contexts. In contrast, we expect concrete
words to occur in a limited set of different contexts
because there is only a restricted amount of words
that have a high probability to fit a specific con-
text. Thus, we estimate the entropy value of con-
crete contexts to be lower than the entropy value
of abstract contexts.

In the three studies reported in this paper, we
systematically test these three hypotheses regard-
ing concrete vs. abstract words, by performing
quantitative analyses of the distributional repre-
sentations across the word classes of nouns, verbs
and adjectives.

3 Materials and Method

For our studies, we selected nouns, verbs and ad-
jectives from the Brysbaert et al. (2014) collection
of concreteness ratings for 40,000 English words.
In total we used 16,620 target words including
9,240 nouns, 3,976 verbs and 3,404 adjectives.1

Each word in this collection has been scored by
humans according to its concreteness on a scale
from 1 (abstract) to 5 (concrete).

Our distributional semantic representations
of the target words were built by extracting
co-occurrences from the POS-tagged version
(Schmid, 1994) of the sentence-shuffled English
COW corpus ENCOW16AX (Schäfer and Bild-
hauer, 2012). We originally constructed three dif-
ferent spaces with window sizes of 2, 10, and
20 context words surrounding the target, and per-
formed parallel analyses for all the three spaces.
Since we did not find any relevant differences be-
tween the three spaces, we will report only the
analyses based on the distributional space from a
window size of 20 context words. Moreover, we

1The reason why we only used a subset of the available
targets was that these were also covered in an extensive selec-
tion of behavioural measures, such as valency scores (War-
riner et al., 2013) and reaction times (Balota et al., 2007)
which we aim to include in further analyses.

77



restricted the dimensions in our matrix to 16,620
× 16,620 (target words × context words). By us-
ing the target words also as context words, we had
knowledge about the concreteness score of each
context word. In a follow-up study, we performed
the same analyses extracting co-occurrences from
the British National Corpus (Burnard, 2000). Even
though both the size and the nature of these two
corpora are extremely different, the results did not
show any significant difference.

In order to get a clearer picture about empirical
distributional differences for concrete vs. abstract
targets, we focused some of our analyses only on
the most concrete and abstract targets, expecting
words with mid-range concreteness scores to be
more difficult in their generation by humans and
consequently noisier in their distributional repre-
sentation. For this reason, we analysed the 1,000
most concrete (concreteness range: 4.82 - 5.00)
and the 1,000 most abstract (1.07 - 2.17) nouns,
the 500 most concrete (4.71 - 5.00) and most ab-
stract (1.12 - 2.21) verbs, and the 200 most con-
crete (4.34 - 5.00) and most abstract (1.19 - 1.64)
adjectives. On the other hand, context was not
subset and consisted of the complete set of 16,620
nouns, verbs and adjectives.

4 Study 1: Analysis of Concrete vs.
Abstract Co-Occurrences

In this study we test the validity of hypothesis (1):
the contexts of both concrete and abstract words
are mainly concrete. For this purpose, we analyse
the distributions of the 16,620 context dimensions
for their concreteness, by the parts-of-speech of
target and context words.

Noun Targets Figure 1 reports the distribution
of noun, verb and adjective contexts for the 1,000
most abstract target nouns (Figure 1a) in com-
parison to the 1,000 most concrete target nouns
(Figure 1b). As clearly shown in Figure 1a, the
majority of contexts of an abstract noun are also
abstract: noun, verb and adjective context words
all show the maximum peak at low concreteness
scores. On the contrary, the distributions of the
contexts of concrete nouns shown in Figure 1b
vary according to POS. The nouns in the context
of concrete noun targets are also very concrete as
shown by the high red bar at concreteness 4.5–5.

On the other hand, verbs and adjectives show a
similar pattern to Figure 1a: a greater distribution
with low concreteness scores.

Verb Targets Figure 2 shows a very compara-
ble pattern to the one described for noun targets.
Contexts of abstract verbs are, on average, also ab-
stract, regardless of their POS. On the other hand,
the verbs and adjectives in the contexts of concrete
verb targets are mainly abstract, while the nouns
are mainly concrete.

same pattern as the one reported for nouns and
verbs.

Discussion Table 1 reports an overview of the
outcomes of this first study. The “X” indicates
the predominant contextual class (abstract vs. con-
crete words) for each target class by POS. All
in all, our results partly disagree with our first
hypothesis induced from observations in the lit-
erature, within the scope of which we expected
the context of concrete and abstract words to be
mostly composed of concrete words.

Table 1: Evaluation of hypothesis (1).

More specifically, our first hypothesis is con-
firmed, on the one hand, by the contextual distri-
bution of concrete target nouns, due to the fact that
they frequently appear with other concrete nouns.
On the contrary, it is rejected by the contextual
ratio of abstract nouns as they primarily co-occur
with other abstract nouns. Thus, as we based our
hypothesis on the theory of embodied cognition,
the observed contextual pattern of abstract nouns
challenges this theory.

Another evidence in favour of our hypothesis
comes from the nouns in the context of concrete
verbs and adjectives that are mainly concrete. In
contrast, concrete and abstract nouns, verbs and
adjectives elicit the same contextual pattern re-
garding context verbs and adjectives. They co-
occur with abstract verbs and abstract adjectives
to a large extent, which does not support the ex-
pectations based on the existing literature.

5 Study 2: Semantic Diversity of Context

In this study, we test our second hypothesis: ab-
stract words occur in a broad range of distinct con-
texts whereas concrete words appear in a limited
set of different contexts. In the following sections
we report two studies where we analyse (i) the
number of non-zero dimensions in the represen-
tation of concrete vs. abstract words, and (ii) the
degree of semantic variability in their contexts.

5.1 Non-Zero Dimensions
The analysis of the number of non-zero dimen-
sions in the vector representation of concrete and
abstract words provides a first indicator of the
contextual richness of our targets. Based on Hill
et al. (2014), we expect concrete target words to
have significantly less diverse context dimensions
than abstract target words, as the former should
co-occur within a restricted set of context words.
Therefore, we expect the portion of non-zero con-
text dimensions to be smaller for concrete than for
abstract target words.

79



The following analyses compare the propor-
tions of non-zero context dimensions between the
1,000 highly concrete (blue boxes) and highly ab-
stract (red boxes) target nouns, 500 verbs, and 200
adjectives, based on raw frequency counts. For
each POS, we compared the proportion of non-
zero dimensions in the full vectors of 16,620 con-
text words for concrete and abstract target words
(left side), and the number of non-zero dimensions
with the same part-of-speech of the target (respec-
tively, 9,240 context nouns, 3,976 context verbs,
3,404 context adjectives). The star (?) indicates
the mean number of non-zero dimensions.

Noun Targets As shown in Figure 4, the com-
parison of non-zero context dimensions of con-
crete (M = 57.80, SD = 23.07) and abstract
(M = 57.78, SD = 22.57) target nouns does not
show any significant difference (t(33238) = -0.02,
p = 0.98). This result indicates that concrete
and abstract target nouns co-occur with a simi-
lar amount of context words. We can observe
the exact same pattern when we restrict the con-
texts to nouns only: no significant difference be-
tween the number of non-zero context noun di-
mensions for concrete (M = 32.12, SD = 12.98)
and abstract (M = 31.78, SD = 12.76) target nouns
(t(18478) = -0.59, p = 0.56).

Verb Targets Figure 5 reports the number of
non-zero dimensions for concrete and abstract
verbs. When considering the full set of con-
texts (left side), concrete words (M = 37.93,
SD = 22.5) have significantly less active con-
texts than abstract words (M = 64.2, SD = 25.73;
t(33238) = 17.18, p < 0.001). The exact same out-
come is shown when focusing only on verbs as
contexts (t(7950) = 16.3, p < 0.001).

Adjective Targets The analysis of the adjectives
in Figure 6 indicates that the number of non-zero
dimensions for concrete and abstract adjectives
follows the same pattern as the verbs. When con-
sidering the full set of contexts (left side), con-
crete adjectives (M = 40.4, SD = 24.7) have sig-
nificantly less active contexts than abstract adjec-
tives (M = 59.46, SD = 19.11, t(33238) = 8.63,
p < 0.001). The exact same outcome is shown
when focusing only on adjectives as contexts
(t(6806) = 10.15, p < 0.001).

5.2 Semantic Diversity of Context
Based on hypothesis (2), we expect the contexts
of concrete words to be more similar among them-
selves than the contexts of abstract words. We test
this hypothesis by computing the semantic diver-

80



sity of the contexts of concrete and abstract tar-
gets. Semantic diversity corresponds to the inverse
of the average semantic similarity of each pair
of context dimensions of a word (Hoffman et al.,
2013). In order to control for pure frequency ef-
fects, we transformed the co-occurrence frequency
counts into local mutual information (LMI) scores
(Evert, 2005).

The study reports the average cosine similarity
between context dimensions for concrete and ab-
stract words; the analysis is conducted incremen-
tally, including the top-k most associated context
dimensions (from 5 to 16,620 associates) sorted by
their LMI scores.

Noun Targets Figure 7 reports the average se-
mantic similarity between the context dimensions
of the 1,000 most concrete (blue boxes) and the
1,000 most abstract (red boxes) target nouns. The
analysis is performed step-wise from left to right,
starting with the average similarity between the 5
most associated contexts and moving up to the av-
erage similarity between all 16,620 context dimen-
sions. Overall, while increasing the number of di-
mensions, both the mean similarity and also the
differences in mean between concrete and abstract
words drop, while remaining significant. The dif-
ference between the mean cosine similarity of the
most associated contexts of concrete (M = 0.32,
SD = 0.14 at k = 5) and abstract (M = 0.20,
SD = 0.13 at k = 5) target nouns is significant
(p < 0.001 at k = 5).

Verb Targets As shown in Figure 8, there are
no significant differences (p = 0.38 at k = 5) in
the similarity of the context dimensions of the 500
most concrete (M = 0.23, SD = 0.15 at k = 5) and
most abstract (M = 0.23, SD = 0.16 at k = 5) verb
targets.

Adjective Targets When analysing the similar-
ity of the contexts of the 200 most concrete and
abstract adjectives we see (Figure 9) the same pat-
tern as shown for nouns. The average similar-
ity of the most associated contexts is significantly
higher (p<0.001 at k = 5) for concrete (M = 0.26,
SD = 0.14 at k = 5) than for abstract (M = 0.17,
SD = 0.12 at k = 5) target adjectives.

5.3 Discussion

According to hypothesis (2), we expected abstract
words to occur in a broader range of distinct con-
texts and concrete words to appear in a more lim-

81



ited set of different contexts. Moreover, the con-
texts of concrete words should be more restricted
and more similar to each other compared to the
contexts of abstract words. The results discussed
only partially support this hypothesis.

The analysis of the number of non-zero context
dimensions for concrete and abstract target verbs
and adjectives show results in line with hypothe-
sis (2). On the contrary, concrete and abstract tar-
get nouns share the same number of non-zero di-
mensions. The analysis of the similarity between
contexts of concrete and abstract target nouns and
adjectives supports our hypothesis; while we do
not see any significant difference when analysing
the verbs.

6 Study 3: Entropy of Concrete and
Abstract Words

In this study we test our third hypothesis: abstract
words are more difficult to predict than concrete
words, due to their higher contextual variability. In
study 2 we already started investigating this phe-
nomenon using semantic diversity. In the current
study we will use entropy as a measure of variabil-
ity (Shannon, 2001):

H(X) = −
∑

x∈X
p(x)log2p(x) (1)

Based on the assumption that abstract words oc-
cur within a high number of distinct contexts, we
expect the entropy of abstract words to be higher
than the entropy of concrete words.

Noun Targets Figure 10 reports the average en-
tropy in the context of the top 1,000 most abstract
(on the left side) and most concrete (on the right
side) target nouns. Regarding the 1,000 most ab-
stract target nouns, the entropy of the 1,000 most
abstract context nouns (M = 7.42, SD = 0.58)
is significantly higher (p < 0.001) than the en-
tropy of the 1,000 most concrete context nouns
(M = 6.44, SD = 0.77). A similar pattern emerges
in the analysis of the entropy of the contexts of
the 1,000 most concrete target nouns: the differ-
ence between concrete (M = 6.64, SD = 0.61) and
abstract contexts (M = 7.21, SD = 0.54) is statisti-
cally significant (p < 0.001).

Verb Targets Similarly to nouns (see Fig-
ure 11), also the abstract contexts of both con-
crete and abstract target verbs show significantly

stract target: M = 5.50, SD = 0.86).

the entropy of target concrete and abstract ad-
jectives. Abstract contexts show significantly
(p < 0.001) higher entropy (concrete target:
M = 3.5, SD = 0.88; abstract target: M = 4.73,
SD = 0.61) than the entropy of their concrete con-
texts (concrete target: M = 3.50, SD = 0.98; ab-
stract target: M = 3.81, SD = 0.87).

Discussion The results of this study support the
predictions of hypothesis (3): concrete contexts
have significantly lower entropy than abstract con-
texts irrespective of the POS of their target words.

7 Conclusions

The aim of this work was to provide a very de-
tailed description of the contextual representation
of concrete and abstract English nouns, verbs and
adjectives. Table 2 summarises the most impor-
tant findings. 1) Concrete target nouns, verbs and
adjectives mainly co-occur with concrete nouns
and with abstract verbs and adjectives, while ab-
stract target words always co-occur with abstract
words. 2a) The contexts of abstract target verbs
and adjectives are broader (less non-zero dimen-
sions) than those of concrete targets verbs and
adjectives. On the other hand, concrete and ab-
stract target nouns have a similar number of non-
zero dimensions. 2b) The most associated con-
texts of concrete nouns and adjectives are signifi-
cantly more similar to each other than the contexts
of abstract nouns and adjectives. However, no dif-
ference emerges between the contexts of verbs. 3)
The concrete contexts of concrete and abstract tar-
gets (nouns, verbs, adjectives) have significantly
lower entropy values than their abstract contexts.
Overall, hypotheses (1) and (2) are not fully sup-
ported by our analyses; on the contrary, the pre-
dictions made in hypothesis (3) are confirmed.

The three studies described in this paper thus
show consistent differences in the contexts of con-
crete and abstract words and yield patterns that
challenge the grounding theory of cognition. In
their analyses on noun and verb comprehension,
Barsalou (1999) and Richardson et al. (2003) sug-
gest that humans process abstract concepts by cre-
ating a perceptual representation. These represen-
tations are inherently concrete because they are
stored as “experiential traces” generated through
the exposure to real world situations using our five
senses (Van Dam et al., 2010). In the instructions
of their norming study, Brysbaert et al. (2014, p.
906) describe concrete words in a similar way:

“some words refer to things or actions in reality,
which you can experience directly through one of
the five senses”. On the contrary, our study is
aligned more with recent theories claiming a rep-
resentational pluralism that includes both percep-
tual and non-perceptual features (Dove, 2009).

While the reported cognitive theories describe
general patterns emerging from the distinction be-
tween concrete and abstract words, the novelty of
our study is to provide a fine-grained analysis of
the distributional nature of these words and an at-
tempt to explain their similarities and differences
from a data-driven perspective. In our opinion, the
detection of the precise properties of concrete and
abstract words makes an extremely valuable con-
tribution to the long-lasting debate about meaning
representation in the human mind and to the use of
this knowledge to significantly improve the perfor-
mance of computational models.
