Abstract 

 

This paper introduces the task of Chinese per-

sonal name disambiguation of the Second 

CIPS-SIGHAN Joint Conference on Chinese 

Language Processing (CLP) 2012 that Natural 

Language Processing Laboratory of 

Zhengzhou University took part in. In this task, 

we mainly use the Vector Space Model to dis-

ambiguate Chinese personal name. We extract 

different named entity features from diverse 

names information, and give different weights 

to various named entity features with the im-

portance. First of all, we classify all the name 

documents, and then we cluster the documents 

that cannot be mapped to names that have 

been defined. Eventually the results of classi-

fication and the clustering are combined. In 

the test corpus experiments, the accuracy rate 

is 0.6778, the recall rate is 0.7205 and the F 

value is 0.6985 for all names. 

1 Introduction 

Named Entity is the fundamental information 

elements in text, and is the basis for understand-

ing the text correctly. Named Entities include 

person names, organization names, place names, 

time, date, and digital. Named Entity Recogni-

tion is to identify the entities in the text and de-

termine what category it is. Such as 方正 fang-

zheng ‘Fang Zheng’，maybe the name is an 

associate professor at the Department of Me-

chanical and Electrical Engineering, Physics and 

Electrical and Mechanical Engineering College 

of Xiamen University, or it may be Peking Uni-

versity Founder Group Corp that was established 

by Peking University. It needs to associate with 

context for disambiguating the entity Fang Zheng. 

For example, Fang Zheng who is an associate 

professor at Xiamen University can be extracted 

with the feature that Xiamen University, Me-

chanical and Electrical Engineering College or 

associate professor, which can eliminate ambigu-

ity. 

2 Related Research 

In the early stages of Named Entity Disambigua-

tion, Bagga and Baldwin (1998) use Vector 

Space Model to resolve ambiguities between 

people having the same personal name. Han and 

Zhao (2010) proposed a knowledge-based me-

thod that captures structural semantic knowledge 

in multiple knowledge sources to disambiguate 

personal entities. Han and Sun (2011) proposed a 

generative Entity-Mention model that leverages 

heterogeneous entity knowledge for the entity 

linking task. In Chinese person name disambigu-

ation, Li, et al (2010) carried out the first confe-

rence, Chinese Language Processing (CLP-2010), 

which contains Chinese person names disambig-

uation task. In this task Shi, et al (2011) pro-

posed a post-processing method that is based on 

multiple entity recognition system integration 

152



 

and heuristic rules, Zhang, et al (2010) proposed 

a method that extracts various person features to 

identify different person names, and according to 

the Chinese word segmentation, we constructed 

artificially rules that identify the names correctly. 

We propose a method that is based on various 

entities recognition and initialize evaluation for 

the features that are the common characteristics 

of different names, and then take Vector Space 

Model to calculate it. In the end, the documents 

that cannot be mapped to names that have been 

defined in the knowledge base are clustered into 

different types. 

CLP2012 Named Entity disambiguation is a 

task pre-classification and later clustering prob-

lems. The task provides a knowledge base of 

Chinese names which include multiple defini-

tions of personal names, and some documents 

about person names. It is the purpose of the task 

that makes each name that appears in documents 

to link corresponding definition of the know-

ledge base, and makes the documents that cannot 

link to corresponding definition of the know-

ledge base to cluster which two documents have 

the same named Entity feature. Task input: 

Names knowledge base of named Entity, text set 

corresponding each name. Task output: if the 

name of each text links to the knowledge base of 

a definition, then output the corresponding id, if 

the name of each text is ordinary words, then 

output “other”, if the name of each text does not 

belong to the above two kinds, then output Num-

bers: Out_XX that have been put into. 

This paper is organized as follows: in section 

3 we will introduce the method that extract the 

named entities related to figures. In section 4 we 

will introduce the calculation model of the 

named entities. In section 5 we will describe ex-

periments and results. In the last section we will 

make conclusions and future work. 

3 Extract the Named Entities Related to 
Figures  

3.1 Character works 

Works have the originality and are the intellec-

tual creations that can be copied in a certain 

physical form in the field of literature and 

science.
1
 Works include literature works, music, 

drama, folk art forms, dance works, photographs, 

films, television, video works, etc. Character 

works is the significant characteristic to identify 

figures. In evaluation corpus, it is generally that a 

                                                 
1 http://baike.baidu.com/view/94574.htm 

character works correspond to one specific cha-

racter. Therefore, it is character works that plays 

an important role to eliminate name disambigua-

tion. 

Extraction method: we extract character works 

from each figure corpus; in other words, we ex-

tract all the contents of quotation marks. 

Format the character works: 

1) If there is 之 Zhi that appears in the work, 

then we split the work with 之 Zhi. 
For example: 

白云(孙皓晖先生的长篇小说《大秦帝国之

黑色裂变》中所虚构的女主角) 
Bai-Yun(Sun-hao-hui-xian-sheng-de-chang-

pian-xiao-shuo-da-qin-di-guo-zhi-hei-se-lie-bian-

zhong-suo-xu-gou-de-nv-zhu-jiao) 

Bai-Yun(she is the fictional actress in the 

Danqin Empire with The Black Fission that is 

Mr.Sun Haohui‟s novel) 

We will extract 大秦帝国之黑色裂变 da-qin-
di-guo-zhi-hei-se-lie-bian „Danqin Empire with 

The Black Fission‟ that is the work, however the 

work cannot be identified. As 大秦帝国之黑色

裂变 da-qin-di-guo-zhi-hei-se-lie-bian „Danqin 
Empire with The Black Fission‟ is only the first 

novel of 大秦帝国 da-qin-di-guo „Danqin Em-

pire‟ in literature works.
2
 We split 大秦帝国之

黑 色 裂 变 da-qin-di-guo-zhi-hei-se-lie-bian 

„Danqin Empire with The Black Fission‟ into 大

秦帝国 da-qin-di-guo „Danqin Empire‟  and 黑

色裂变 hei-se-lie-bian „The Black Fission‟with

之 Zhi, and then they can be identified correctly. 
2) If the length of works' name is less than 2, 

it is required to extract works and quota-

tion marks. 

Eg:马啸担任河南卫视《旅游》栏目主持人. 
Ma-xiao-dan-ren-hen-nan-wei-shi-lv-you-lan-

mu-zhu-chi-ren „Ma Xiao is appointed host of 

Traveling program in Henan TV‟In this sentence 

旅游 lv-you „Traveling‟ is the work name. It is 
known that Traveling has different part of speech, 

which can be a verb or noun. The Traveling is a 

TV program in the sentence, which is a noun. It 

will reduce accuracy rate that we take Traveling 

as the feature. 

3.2 Character Aliases 

Aliases are the names other than the formal or 

specific. They are used in writing, oral.
3
 Charac-

ter aliases are an essential feature for eliminating

the disambiguation. We define that each file-

name in KB folder is the figure‟s original name, 

others are character aliases. We use the methods 

that are based on pattern matching to extract cha-

racter aliases Lu and HOU (2006), as is shown 

below following methods: 

1) Synonymy keywords + Synonyms + End 
identifier 

Synonymy keywords: 本 名 | 别 号 | ， 字

|^(字)|，号|^(号) |又号|^(名)|笔名|自号

|又名|乳名|别名|原名|艺名|本名|曾用名|

俗称|亦称|又称, the symbol “|”means choose, 
“^”means that matches the beginning of the 

string. 

End identifier: it means the end of extracting 

the synonyms, the end signs are always (，or,) 

and (。or .), which mean comma symbol and full 
stop. If we extract character aliases equal with 

original names, then we should use the feature 

that synonyms combine with synonymy. 

Eg:白云(原名杨维汉，广东省潮安县人) 
Bai-Yun(Yuan-ming-yang-wei-han-guang-zhou-

chao-an-xian-ren) Bai-Yun(Her original family 

name is Yang Weihan and she was born in 

ChaoAn Guangdong Province). 

According to the first method that we could 

extract 杨维汉 yang-wei-han „Yang Weihan‟ 
that it is character aliase.   However, the content 

of 白雪 bai-xue 'Bai Xue' that 白百何，中国内

地女演员，别名白雪  Bai-bai-he-zhong-guo-
nei-di-nv-yan-yuan-bie-ming-bai-xue „Bai baihe 

is Chinese mainland actress and her aliase is Bai 

Xue‟ and 陈大威，号白雪，碧松斋主人 chen-
da-wei-hao-bai-xue-bi-song-zhai-zhu-ren „Chen 

Dawei's art-name is Bai Xue and he is the host of 

Bi-Song-Zhai‟, we could extract 白雪 Bai Xue 
that it is character aliase, which we cannot make 

a distinction between the two characters. As a 

result we take 别名白雪 bie-ming-bai-xue „aliase 

is Bai Xue‟ and 号白雪 hao-bai-xue „art-name is 
Bai Xue‟ as the features to eliminate disambigua-

tion. 

2) (Original family name|^(Chinese sur-
names))+ name+ end identifier 

Original family name: we take original family 

name as prefix. 

^ (Chinese surnames): it means the beginning 

of the Chinese; Zhang, et al (2008) found out that 

the top 400 Chinese surnames have covered 99%. 

End identifier: it is the same define as the first 

method. 

If the length of character aliases are less than 2 

or more than 3, and then they will be extracted. 

Eg1: the content of 白雪 Bai Xue that 白百

何，中国内地女演员，别名白雪 Bai-bai-he-
zhong-guo-nei-di-nv-yan-yuan-bie-ming-bai-xue 

„Bai baihe is Chinese mainland actress and her 

aliase is Bai Xue‟ in the sentence the family 

name of Bai Xue is Bai. End identifier is 

“,” ,then we could extract “白百何” as charac-
ter aliase from the first method. 

Eg2: the content of Baixue that 陈大威，号白

雪，碧松斋主人 chen-da-wei-hao-bai-xue-bi-
song-zhai-zhu-ren „Chen Dawei's art-name Bai 

Xue and he is the host of Bi-Song-Zhai‟, in this 

sentence the family name of Bai Xue is Bai,and 

we know that 陈大威(Chen Dawei) is character 

aliase, the family Bai is different from 陈 Chen. 
Therefore, according to second method we use 

the family name Chen. End identifier is “,” ,then 

we extract character aliase as Chen Dawei. 

3.3 Named Entity 

Named Entity is the feature to discriminate fig-

ures. The features related to figure, Learning 

Unit, organizations, living space, and other enti-

ties, can mark different figures. In this task, we 

primarily extract features learning unit, organiza-

tions, living space, and other entities. 

1) Learning unit 
Learning unit include university and college. 

Extraction rules: (prefix end identifier | ns) + 

University name+ (University| college) 

Prefix end identifier: it means the prefix end 

identifier of extracting learning unit; the same 

methods are used in character aliases. 

Ns: it means place name. 

Extraction process is shown as the following: 

First, we use Peking University participle 

software to segment the character information 

corpora Yu, et al (2002). 

Second, in order to judge the beginning of 

string we add “#” to the beginning of each cha-

racter definition. 

Third, we index the keywords “University” or 

“college” in the corpora. 

Fourth, it is the direction that university‟s or 

college‟s prefix to loop for each participle units. 

Fifth, if the next participle units contain “ns” 

or “#”, the loop will stop. 

Sixth, get the Chinese string that is between 

the beginning and the end index. 

2) Organization and other entities 
We use “nt” to express organization, and use 

“nz” to express other entities Yu, et al (2002). 

Then the Chinese words contain “nt” and “nz” 

will be extracted. 

154



 

3) Living space 
We mainly extract the highest frequency Chinese 

words in participle information; the word fre-

quency determines the related degree about fig-

ure. 

3.4 Figure Title 

Title is the name that is set up, which refers to 

marriage, social relations, the status, and occupa-

tion. Such as professor, chief, director, etc. Title 

can help to distinguish different profession and 

status, which is essential for distinguishing vari-

ous figures. 

The figure title resource is part of Hownet
4
 in 

this task, which contains 240 titles. We delete 28 

titles that they reduce accuracy rate from title 

resource and add 8 titles that increase accuracy 

rate as title resources. As is shown in table 1: 

Type Titles 
 Be Deleted 代表 演员 领导 教授

Table 1: The titles of be deleted and added 

Finally, we get a title resource that contains 

220 titles. We will extract the titles that appear in 

title resource and in figures‟ definition, which 

will be title features, or it will be null. 

4 Calculation Model 

4.1 Vector Space Model 

Vector Space Model (VSM) is algebraic model 

for representing text documents as vectors of 

identifiers. It is using vectors of identifiers that 

greatly improve computability of documents. In 

VSM each document can be expressed as N-

dimensional vectors of identifiers, each dimen-

sional can be chosen keywords as vector, which 

is shown as the following: 

1 2 3, , , ,T nD T T T T   

                                                 
4 http://www.keenage.com/ 

iT  represents the i
th
 item in document. i  

represents weight of iT , which is shown as the 
following: 

1 2 3, , , , nD       
4.2 Feature Weight Calculation 

Feature weight is used to reflect the importance 

for feature item in the document. Originally we 

calculate feature weight with Boolean weight 

that if the feature appears in the document, then 

the feature weight is 1, otherwise 0. However, 

this calculation method cannot reflect the impor-

tance of feature, and then we use Term Frequen-

cy (TF) and Relative Word Frequency to calcu-

late, TF is the method that get frequency of fea-

ture item. Relative Word Frequency refers to the 

TF-IDF method. 

But owing to the fact that each character in-

formation text is short, the above three kinds of 

feature weight calculation methods cannot effec-

tively reflect importance of different characters. 

According to the section 3 that there are seven 

character information features: character works, 

character aliases, learning unit, organization, 

other entities, living space, and character title, 

which face the different importance of character 

features, we initialize weight for each character 

features. i  represents weight of the ith charac-
ter feature.  Each document can be expressed as 

seven character features in the following: 

1 2 3 4 5 6 7, , , , , ,D          
Generally, the experience parameters are for: 

1=10，2=6，3=3，4=2，5=2，6=5，

7=3, we use two methods to disambiguate Chi-

nese personal name.

4.3 Documents Clustering 

We cluster the documents from the number re-

sults of section 4.2 are “other”. The steps are 

shown as the following: 

 We extract the documents from the clas-
sification number results of section 4.2 

as “other”. 

 We extract the character features, cha-
racter work, character aliases, learning 

unit, and character title, from the docu-

ments by using the same method in sec-

tion three. 

 Boolean weighting 

If two documents have the same feature that it 

is one of all, we cluster the two documents to one 

kind; otherwise, the document corresponds to the 

classification number of “other”. 

 Merge the results of section 4.2 and the 
results of section 4.3.In other words, the 

results of section 4.3 replace the classifi-

cation number of “other” of the results of 

section 4.2. 

5 Experiments 

5.1 Experimental Data 

We use the texts in the training corpus and test 

corpus of CLP2012. There are 16 character 

names and 1634 documents in training corpus, 

and 32 character names and 5503 documents in 

test corpus. The corpus has two kinds: 

1) Knowledge base of named entity 
It will provide a knowledge base for each 

name. For example, the name Fang Zheng re-

fers to 12 entities, some of them are shown be-

low: 

 Fang Zheng(Comedian) 

 Fang Zheng(Peking University Founder 
Group Corp) 

 Fang Zheng (Associate professor) 

2) It will provide a text set for each Name 

5.2 Evaluation Method 

We still take Fang Zheng as an example. It is 

defined as 12 kinds of entity in a knowledge base. 

The test document set that contain Fang Zheng is 

T. The reference answer marks the texts that con-

tain Fang Zheng: 

There are kinds of definition for Fang Zheng 

in the knowledge base. Each definition belongs 

to a class, which is expressed as L_XX(01≤XX

≤12), “XX” represents the definition of the XXth 
entity. 

If Fang Zheng is not an entity name but a 

common word, it belongs to the class of “other”. 

Fang Zheng is an entity name, but it has no de-

finition in the knowledge base, then it belongs to 

Out_XX, XX represents id. Out_XX represents 

respectively Out_01, Out_02… 

We always assume that when Fang Zheng ap-

pears in a text many times and their mark is the 

same. Therefore, a text is only given a marked 

result. This system marks the results that contain 

Fang Zheng with SL_XX, SOther, and SOut_XX 

respectively, and each text is only marked by one 

class. Then we calculate the precision rate and 

recall rate for each text are as follows: 

1) If Fang Zheng that includes t is divided to 
SL_XX, then it is taken as definition of 

the knowledge base to calculate precision 

rate and recall rate are as follows: 

| _ _ |
Pr ( )

| _ _ |
Re ( )

SL XX L XX

2) If Fang Zheng that includes t is divided to 
SOther, it is taken as a common word to 

calculate precision rate and recall rate are 

as follows:

3) If Fang Zheng that includes t is put into

reference answer, the precision rate and 

recall rate are as follows:

5.3 Experimental Results 

We use two methods that Term Frequency (TF) 

and Vectorial Angle Cosine (VAC) to disambi-

guate Chinese personal name. Two methods re-

sults are shown in Table 2.  

 

Method Pre Rec F 

TF 0.6399 0.6795 0.6590 

VAC 0.5972 0.6079 0.6025 
 

Table 2: The results of two methods 

We can see that TF method is superior to Vec-

torial Angle Cosine (VAC) method from table 2. 

Therefore, we mainly use TF method to elimi-

nate discrimination on test corpus. The results 

are shown as table 3: 

 

Method Pre Rec F 

TF 0.6778 0.7205 0.6985 
 

Table 3: The results of test corpus 

First, we can see the recall rate of the test cor-

pus is not ideal from table 3. The problem is that 

we cannot extract enough named entity features 

in the content. Such as company name, and verb 

structures, etc. Second, the precision rate is low. 

The problem is that the estimation of initial 

weight of each named entity features and the 

clustering algorithm. 

6 Conclusions and Future work 

In this task we extract different named entities 

features from diverse names information, and 

give different weights to various named entities 

features with the importance of various named 

entities. Firstly, we classify each name docu-

ments. Secondly, we cluster the documents that 

cannot be mapped to names that have been de-

fined. Finally, the results of classification and the 

clustering are combined. However, it is only the 

experience weight for the estimation of initial 

weight of each named entity features, then dif-

ferent weights have different effects. The Boo-

lean method cannot fully reflect the importance 

of all kinds of named entities features. 

In the future, we can expand the named entity 

features, such as company name, verb structures, 

and the noun near character name in the docu-

ments. Then we choose more effective named 

entity initial weights, and use various clustering 

methods for character documents (Sun, et 

al2008).
