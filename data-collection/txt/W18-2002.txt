Fragmentation, Heterogeneity, and Non-
Interoperability

• Fragmentation, heterogeneity and a lack of interoperability between 
methods, tools and data sets (Jen’s first slide)

• Applicable for termbase design as well

• Issues
• TBX only viable for coherent data models

• Prevalence of non-complying models

• Lack of guidance regarding viable models

• Need for coordination with XLIFF 

• Need for xmlns documentation

• Outdated link handling

Increasing Collaboration of MT and CAT

• Agile combinations and recombinations of MT 
and Computer Assisted Translation (CAT)—
difficult to separate out approaches except for 
limited evaluation of tools
• MT as an option in CAT

• Predictive MT in CAT

• Role of terminology management in governing 
human interaction with MT and TM

• Potential issue: interface between TBX & LMF

ISO 30042 – TermBase eXchange

• Issued in 2009, but subject to ongoing development

• New Draft International standard currently in ballot

• Archiving the information in a termbase

• Exchanging information between systems
• Authoring (send monolingual information from a termbase to an authoring 

tool)

• Translation (send a subset of the information from a termbase to a translator)

• Data mining (export most/all information from a termbase for analysis using 
XML)

• Guiding the design of a new termbase for interoperability

ISO 30042 :2009– TermBase eXchange

• Positives
• Powerful and flexible enough to express almost any termbase model

• Viable for exchange among like data models & systems

• Negatives
• Not widely used for exchange between divergent systems

• Applications outputs not true TBX 

• TBX as a moving target

• Exchange impossible between incompatible data models

• Incompatibility with some modern xml solutions

29

TBX-Basic

• The localization industry solution to a normalized format

• “Dialect” of TBX consisting of a defined data model and a 
specified set of data categories

• Positive: 
• Standardized data model & selection of data categories (datcats) 

• Recognized user community

• Negative: 
• Rich, but restricted data category set

• Need for reliable support tools

• Some outdated XML conventions

TBX-Basic should be exchangeable and 
manageable with tbxinfo.net tools.

Upgrading and Empowering TBX
• ISO 30042:2018 and beyond

• Coordination with XLIFF terminology markup

• Use of xml namespaces

• Modernizing hypertext representations
• TEI Term (ancestor of TBX) predated HTML & modern idref/href notations

• /cross-reference/ envisioned as a datcat

• Enabled by its own linking features

33

Proceedings of AMTA 2018 Workshop: The Role of Authoritative Standards in the MT Environment Boston, March 17 - 21, 2018



When TBX-Basic is not enough

• TBX-Linguist
• Additional data categories

• /figure/ added at the language level

• /cross-reference/ swapped out for /related concept/ and /related term/

• /register/

• /grammaticalNumber/

• /transferComment/

• ja-specific datcats (reading, readingNote)

Creating a New Dialect

• Start from TBX Basic
• Even if you don’t want to use all of it!

•Add additional DCs to data model
• Map any name changes 
• Edit data model for all languages, all terms, and synonyms 

for each language
• Activate datcats in the respective model levels

40

Proceedings of AMTA 2018 Workshop: The Role of Authoritative Standards in the MT Environment Boston, March 17 - 21, 2018



Creating a New Dialect

• Update 
• Data model (previous slide)

• Layout model (replicate additions at all levels)

• Input model
• You can leave out items you don’t want to use in a given iteration

• But keep them in the core data model & in layout

• Edit TBX-Basic output xml as needed (datcat names)

• Import seamlessly into new data model

41

Proceedings of AMTA 2018 Workshop: The Role of Authoritative Standards in the MT Environment Boston, March 17 - 21, 2018



Honor the telescope!

• TBX Core + TBXMin  + TBXBasic + TBXLinguist Modules = TBX-Linguist Dialect

• Each successive dialect is a superset of what comes before

• All subordinate dialects can be imported into the final component

• Additional data categories in the final component are identified and 
can if desired be manipulated by conversion routines.

TBXCore
TBXMin

TBXBasic
TBXLinguist

42

Proceedings of AMTA 2018 Workshop: The Role of Authoritative Standards in the MT Environment Boston, March 17 - 21, 2018



Structural Integrity

• TBX-Basic fully included sub-set of TBX-Linguist

• Some names changed—mapped to existing names

• Cross-reference involves a structural change

• Some items could be omitted from an input model or display 
(e.g., /term location/, (term) source)

• Slides 9 & 10 illustrate smooth import

43

Proceedings of AMTA 2018 Workshop: The Role of Authoritative Standards in the MT Environment Boston, March 17 - 21, 2018



Tools Issues

•Modify support tools to accommodate new data 
profile as a superset of TBXBasic

• Lean to rich (if properly mapped) facilitates clean 
exchange

•Rich to lean – possible tool to convert missing datcats 
to notes

•Possible if the tool knows about the other dialect

44

Proceedings of AMTA 2018 Workshop: The Role of Authoritative Standards in the MT Environment Boston, March 17 - 21, 2018



Additional Issues

• Concept relations (I-Term, Coreon) and knowledge modeling datcats 
are currently excluded from the TBX master file.

• Bibliography entries incorporated in termbases are not part of the 
encoding scheme.

• Coordination with MT component of hybrid CAT/MT?

• Coordination with LMF?
