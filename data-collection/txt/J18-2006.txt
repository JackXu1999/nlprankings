Understanding time as expressed in text is an important goal of natural language
understanding and extremely important for many applications, including information
extraction, information retrieval, and question answering. This book provides a com-
prehensive overview, the challenges, available data resources, and existing systems for
the task, with a special emphasis on sensitivity of temporal tagging to domains. This
is a well-written book with contents well structured and organized. The discussions
on temporal tagging for different domains are valuable and inspirational not only to
readers interested in the specific subject of temporal tagging, but also to a broader
range of readers interested in Natural Language Processing (NLP) in general. Although
it is well known that domain changes often cause significant performance reductions of
various NLP systems, little work has been conducted to understand and further explain
specific ways such influences have been applied. To a great extent, this book fills the gap
in the context of temporal tagging.

This book consists of six chapters, which I will group into three parts. The first
three chapters give a clear introduction to temporal tagging, including subtasks, char-
acteristics of time, realizations of temporal expressions, data annotation standards, data
sets, and evaluation metrics. This initial part provides sufficent background knowledge
for further discussion of domain influences on temporal tagging. The fourth chapter is
the core of the book, and it identifies four major domains—news-style, narrative-style,
colloquial-style, and autonomic-style documents—and elaborates on unique character-
istics of each domain and their implications on temporal tagging. The last two chapters
describe a list of temporal taggers (full-fledged or focusing on one stage of temporal
tagging), compare their designs (rule-based vs. learning-based) and their capabilities of
addressing multiple domains and even multiple languages, and conclude with future
directions of temporal tagging.

Chapter 1 specifies the two subtasks of temporal tagging, temporal expression
extraction, and normalization, and explains that temporal tagging can be viewed as
a specific type of named entity recognition and normalization. Chapter 1 also briefly
describes several temporal tagging applications, including information extraction,
information retrieval, and question answering.

Chapter 2 clearly describes key characteristics of time. Specifically, time can be
normalized and temporal information can be organized in a hierarchical structure based

on their granularities. The chapter goes on to describe four categories of temporal
expressions in real text (i.e., date, time, duration, and set). I found the discussion on
differences between a point in time that may have a duration and a duration of time
very interesting. The subsection on realizations of temporal expressions is at the core of
this chapter, and clearly defines four types of temporal expressions—explicit, implicit,
relative, and underspecified expressions. It is important to distinguish between these
types before we examine differences of temporal tagging across domains. Note that
recognizing and normalizing each type of temporal expression requires different strate-
gies and is at a different difficulty level. Meanwhile, the authors discuss uncertainty or
fuzziness of some temporal expressions. For instance, in “He visited Germany in 2010,”
it is rather unlikely that the visit took place the whole year. The exact point or period
in 2010 is not known.

Chapter 3 surveys annotation standards, describes several evaluation metrics, and
provides a comprehensive list of research competitions and annotated news-style cor-
pora. Although I found the description of annotation standards to be generally well
thought out and organized, I occasionally felt it was difficult to understand some
of the description. For instance, it is difficult to immediately understand the major
differences between TIMEX2 and TIMEX3, the description of TIMEX3, and its various
tags and abstract tags with no extent in TIMEX3. More examples would be helpful.
Instead of sequentially reading each section in this chapter, it may help to first read
Section 3.4 on annotated corpora. This chapter also includes an extensive description of
different metrics used for measuring temporal tagging performance. The list of research
competitions covers all the recent major efforts that were indicated by their adopted
corpora, including news-style corpora (MUC, ACE, and TempEval), biomedical texts,
QA TempEval (news, wiki, and blogs), and multi-language annotated corpora.

Chapter 4 is the core of the book, and defines four major types of domains, ex-
amines their unique characteristics, and discusses strategies of temporal tagging for
each domain. The chapter starts by describing specific characteristics of news-style
documents, which is the dominant type in most studies on temporal tagging. This
is followed by a general discussion of genres or domains, covering news, Wikipedia,
dialogs, short messages, and clinical reports. Specifically, this book defines a domain
as a group of documents that have the same characteristics relevant for the task of
temporal tagging. After providing a list of annotated corpora that includes non-news
texts, the chapter identifies four broad types of domains—news-style, narrative-style,
colloquial-style, and autonomic-style documents—which I found fascinating, especially
the fourth domain that features unresolvable time expressions due to local time frames.
The discussions of unique features for each domain with respect to temporal tagging are
clear and well organized, and directly lead to strategies as suggested by the authors for
addressing the task in each domain. Note that each domain is defined in a broad sense
and covers texts created in several scenarios. For instance, the news-style documents
include “not only news articles but also many other types of documents (e.g., letters
and formal blog posts), which are written similarly and thus belong to the same domain
from a temporal tagging point of view.”

Chapter 5 describes several widely used temporal taggers, both rule-based and
learning-based taggers, and compares their temporal tagging performance on docu-
ments in different domains. Clearly, taggers prepared or trained for a particular domain
do not perform well when applied to a different domain. Consistent with the authors’
vision, this chapter emphasizes that temporal taggers developed with all the domains
in mind are preferable. This chapter also argues for developing highly multilingual
temporal taggers.

Book Review

Chapter 6 concludes the book by pointing out more directions for the future work of
temporal tagging, in order to achieve accurate and complete temporal understanding.

To summarize, this book provides timely references to most recent advances of tem-
poral tagging, including both annotated corpora from different domains and systems,
as well as insightful discussions and vision in terms of categorizing effects of domains
and designing generalized temporal taggers. This book is recommended not only to
students, researchers, and developers who work in the field of temporal tagging, but
also to a wide range of readers interested in NLP in general.
