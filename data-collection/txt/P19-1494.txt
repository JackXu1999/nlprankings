Abstract
A recent research line has obtained strong re-
sults on bilingual lexicon induction by align-
ing independently trained word embeddings in
two languages and using the resulting cross-
lingual embeddings to induce word translation
pairs through nearest neighbor or related re-
trieval methods. In this paper, we propose an
alternative approach to this problem that builds
on the recent work on unsupervised machine
translation. This way, instead of directly in-
ducing a bilingual lexicon from cross-lingual
embeddings, we use them to build a phrase-
table, combine it with a language model, and
use the resulting machine translation system
to generate a synthetic parallel corpus, from
which we extract the bilingual lexicon us-
ing statistical word alignment techniques. As
such, our method can work with any word em-
bedding and cross-lingual mapping technique,
and it does not require any additional resource
besides the monolingual corpus used to train
the embeddings. When evaluated on the exact
same cross-lingual embeddings, our proposed
method obtains an average improvement of 6
accuracy points over nearest neighbor and 4
points over CSLS retrieval, establishing a new
state-of-the-art in the standard MUSE dataset.

1 Introduction

Cross-lingual word embedding mappings have at-
tracted a lot of attention in recent times. These
methods work by independently training word
embeddings in different languages, and mapping
them to a shared space through linear transforma-
tions. While early methods required a training dic-
tionary to find the initial alignment (Mikolov et al.,
2013), fully unsupervised methods have managed
to obtain comparable results based on either ad-
versarial training (Conneau et al., 2018) or self-
learning (Artetxe et al., 2018b).

A prominent application of these methods is
Bilingual Lexicon Induction (BLI), that is, using

the resulting cross-lingual embeddings to build a
bilingual dictionary. For that purpose, one would
typically induce the translation of each source
word by taking its corresponding nearest neigh-
bor in the target language. However, it has been
argued that this basic approach suffers from the
hubness problem1, which has motivated alterna-
tive retrieval methods like inverted nearest neigh-
bor2 (Dinu et al., 2015), inverted softmax (Smith
et al., 2017), and Cross-domain Similarity Local
Scaling (CSLS) (Conneau et al., 2018).

In this paper, we go one step further and,
rather than directly inducing the bilingual dictio-
nary from the cross-lingual word embeddings, we
use them to build an unsupervised machine trans-
lation system, and extract a bilingual dictionary
from a synthetic parallel corpus generated with
it. This allows us to take advantage of a strong
language model and naturally extract translation
equivalences through statistical word alignment.
At the same time, our method can be used as a
drop-in replacement of traditional retrieval tech-
niques, as it can work with any cross-lingual word
embeddings and it does not require any additional
resource besides the monolingual corpus used to
train them. Our experiments show the effective-
ness of this alternative approach, which outper-
forms the previous best retrieval method by 4 ac-
curacy points on average, establishing a new state-
of-the-art in the standard MUSE dataset. As such,
we conclude that, contrary to recent trend, future
research in BLI should not focus exclusively on
direct retrieval methods.

1Hubness (Radovanović et al., 2010a,b) refers to the phe-
nomenon of a few points being the nearest neighbors of many
other points in high-dimensional spaces, which has been re-
ported to severely affect cross-lingual embedding mappings
(Dinu et al., 2015).

2The original paper refers to this method as globally cor-
rected retrieval.

2 Proposed method

The input of our method is a set of cross-lingual
word embeddings and the monolingual corpora
used to train them. In our experiments, we use
fastText embeddings (Bojanowski et al., 2017)
mapped through VecMap (Artetxe et al., 2018b),
but the algorithm described next can also work
with any other word embedding and cross-lingual
mapping method.

The general idea of our method is to to build
an unsupervised phrase-based statistical machine
translation system (Lample et al., 2018; Artetxe
et al., 2018c, 2019), and use it to generate a syn-
thetic parallel corpus from which to extract a bilin-
gual dictionary. For that purpose, we first derive
phrase embeddings from the input word embed-
dings by taking the 400,000 most frequent bigrams
and and the 400,000 most frequent trigrams in
each language, and assigning them the centroid of
the words they contain. Having done that, we use
the resulting cross-lingual phrase embeddings to
build a phrase-table as described in Artetxe et al.
(2018c). More concretely, we extract translation
candidates by taking the 100 nearest-neighbors of
each source phrase, and score them with the soft-
max function over their cosine similarities:

φ(f̄ |ē) =
exp

(
cos(ē, f̄)/τ

)∑
f̄ ′ exp

(
cos(ē, f̄ ′)/τ

)
where the temperature τ is estimated using max-
imum likelihood estimation over a dictionary in-
duced in the reverse direction. In addition to the
phrase translation probabilities in both directions,
we also estimate the forward and reverse lexi-
cal weightings by aligning each word in the tar-
get phrase with the one in the source phrase most
likely generating it, and taking the product of their
respective translation probabilities.

We then combine this phrase-table with a dis-
tortion model and a 5-gram language model es-
timated in the target language corpus, which re-
sults in a phrase-based machine translation sys-
tem. So as to optimize the weights of the resulting
model, we use the unsupervised tuning procedure
proposed by Artetxe et al. (2019), which combines
a cyclic consistency loss and a language modeling
loss over a subset of 2,000 sentences from each
monolingual corpora.

Having done that, we generate a synthetic par-
allel corpus by translating the source language
monolingual corpus with the resulting machine

translation system.3 We then word align this
corpus using FastAlign (Dyer et al., 2013) with
default hyperparameters and the grow-diag-final-
and symmetrization heuristic. Finally, we build
a phrase-table from the word aligned corpus, and
extract a bilingual dictionary from it by discarding
all non-unigram entries. For words with more than
one entry, we rank translation candidates accord-
ing to their direct translation probability.

3 Experimental settings

In order to compare our proposed method head-
to-head with other BLI methods, the experimen-
tal setting needs to fix the monolingual embed-
ding training method, as well as the cross-lingual
mapping algorithm and the evaluation dictionar-
ies. In addition, in order to avoid any advantage,
our method should not see any further monolin-
gual corpora than those used to train the mono-
lingual embeddings. Unfortunately, existing BLI
datasets distribute pre-trained word embeddings
alone, but not the monolingual corpora used to
train them. For that reason, we decide to use the
evaluation dictionaries from the standard MUSE
dataset (Conneau et al., 2018) but, instead of us-
ing the pre-trained Wikipedia embeddings dis-
tributed with it, we extract monolingual corpora
from Wikipedia ourselves and train our own em-
beddings trying to be as faithful as possible to the
original settings. This allows us to compare our
proposed method to previous retrieval techniques
in the exact same conditions, while keeping our
results as comparable as possible to previous work
reporting results for the MUSE dataset.

More concretely, we use WikiExtractor4 to ex-
tract plain text from Wikipedia dumps, and pre-
process the resulting corpus using standard Moses
tools (Koehn et al., 2007) by applying sentence
splitting, punctuation normalization, tokenization
with aggressive hyphen splitting, and lowercasing.
We then train word embeddings for each language
using the skip-gram implementation of fastText
(Bojanowski et al., 2017) with default hyperpa-
rameters, restricting the vocabulary to the 200,000
most frequent tokens. The official embeddings in

3For efficiency purposes, we restricted the size of the syn-
thetic parallel corpus to a maximum of 10 million sentences,
and use cube-pruning for faster decoding. As such, our re-
sults could likely be improved by translating the full mono-
lingual corpus with standard decoding.

the MUSE dataset were trained using these exact
same settings, so our embeddings only differ in the
Wikipedia dump used to extract the training cor-
pus and the pre-processing applied to it, which is
not documented in the original dataset.

Having done that, we map these word embed-
dings to a cross-lingual space using the unsuper-
vised mode in VecMap (Artetxe et al., 2018b),
which builds an initial solution based on the intra-
lingual similarity distribution of the embeddings
and iteratively improves it through self-learning.
Finally, we induce a bilingual dictionary using
our proposed method and evaluate it in compari-
son to previous retrieval methods (standard nearest
neighbor, inverted nearest neighbor, inverted soft-
max5 and CSLS). Following common practice, we
use precision at 1 as our evaluation measure.6

4 Results and discussion

Table 1 reports the results of our proposed sys-
tem in comparison to previous retrieval methods.
As it can be seen, our method obtains the best
results in all language pairs and directions, with
an average improvement of 6 points over near-
est neighbor and 4 points over CSLS, which is
the best performing previous method. These re-
sults are very consistent across all translation di-
rections, with an absolute improvement between
2.7 and 6.3 points over CSLS. Interestingly, nei-
ther inverted nearest neighbor nor inverted soft-

5Inverted softmax has a temperature hyperparameter T ,
which is typically tuned in the training dictionary. Given that
we do not have any training dictionary in our fully unsuper-
vised settings, we use a fixed temperature of T = 30, which
was also used by some previous authors (Lample et al., 2018).
While we tried other values in our preliminary experiments,
but we did not observe any significant difference.

6We find a few out-of-vocabularies in the evaluation dic-
tionary that are likely caused by minor pre-processing differ-
ences. In those cases, we use copying as a back-off strategy
(i.e. if a given word is not found in our induced dictionary,
we simply leave it unchanged). In any case, the percentage
of out-of-vocabularies is always below 1%, so this has a neg-
ligible effect in the reported results.

max are able to outperform standard nearest neigh-
bor, presumably because our cross-lingual embed-
dings are less sensitive to hubness thanks to the
symmetric re-weighting in VecMap (Artetxe et al.,
2018a). At the same time, CSLS obtains an abso-
lute improvement of 2 points over nearest neigh-
bor, only a third of what our method achieves.
This suggests that, while previous retrieval meth-
ods have almost exclusively focused on addressing
the hubness problem, there is a substantial margin
of improvement beyond this phenomenon.

So as to put these numbers into perspective, Ta-
ble 2 compares our method to previous results re-
ported in the literature.7 As it can be seen, our pro-
posed method obtains the best published results
in all language pairs and directions, outperform-
ing the previous state-of-the-art by a substantial
margin. Note, moreover, that these previous sys-
tems mostly differ in their cross-lingual mapping
algorithm and not the retrieval method, so our im-
provements are orthogonal.

We believe that, beyond the substantial gains
in this particular task, our work has important
implications for future research in cross-lingual
word embedding mappings. While most work in
this topic uses BLI as the only evaluation task,
Glavas et al. (2019) recently showed that BLI
results do not always correlate well with down-
stream performance. In particular, they observe
that some mapping methods that are specifically
designed for BLI perform poorly in other tasks.
Our work shows that, besides their poor perfor-
mance in those tasks, these BLI-centric mapping
methods might not even be the optimal approach
to BLI, as our alternative method, which relies on
unsupervised machine translation instead of direct

7Note that previous results are based on the pre-trained
embeddings of the MUSE dataset, while we had to train our
embeddings to have a controlled experiment (see Section 3).
In any case, our embeddings are trained following the official
dataset setting, using Wikipedia, the same system and hyper-
parameters, so our results should be roughly comparable.

retrieval over mapped embeddings, obtains sub-
stantially better results without requiring any ad-
ditional resource. As such, we argue that 1) future
work in cross-lingual word embeddings should
consider other evaluation tasks in addition to BLI,
and 2) future work in BLI should consider other al-
ternatives in addition to direct retrieval over cross-
lingual embedding mappings.

5 Related work

While BLI has been previously tackled us-
ing count-based vector space models (Vulić and
Moens, 2013) and statistical decipherment (Ravi
and Knight, 2011; Dou and Knight, 2012), these
methods have recently been superseded by cross-
lingual embedding mappings, which work by
aligning independently trained word embeddings
in different languages. For that purpose, early
methods required a training dictionary, which
was used to learn a linear transformation that
mapped these embeddings into a shared cross-
lingual space (Mikolov et al., 2013; Artetxe et al.,
2018a). The resulting cross-lingual embeddings
are then used to induce the translations of words
that were missing in the training dictionary by tak-
ing their nearest neighbor in the target language.

The amount of required supervision was later
reduced through self-learning methods (Artetxe
et al., 2017), and then completely eliminated
through adversarial training (Zhang et al., 2017a;
Conneau et al., 2018) or more robust iterative ap-
proaches combined with initialization heuristics
(Artetxe et al., 2018b; Hoshen and Wolf, 2018). At
the same time, several recent methods have formu-
lated embedding mappings as an optimal transport
problem (Zhang et al., 2017b; Grave et al., 2018;
Alvarez-Melis and Jaakkola, 2018).

In addition to that, a large body of work has
focused on addressing the hubness problem that
arises when directly inducing bilingual dictionar-
ies from cross-lingual embeddings, either through
the retrieval method (Dinu et al., 2015; Smith
et al., 2017; Conneau et al., 2018) or the map-
ping itself (Lazaridou et al., 2015; Shigeto et al.,
2015; Joulin et al., 2018). While all these pre-
vious methods directly induce bilingual dictionar-
ies from cross-lingually mapped embeddings, our
proposed method combines them with unsuper-
vised machine translation techniques, outperform-
ing them all by a substantial margin.

6 Conclusions and future work

We propose a new approach to BLI which, instead
of directly inducing bilingual dictionaries from
cross-lingual embedding mappings, uses them to
build an unsupervised machine translation system,
which is then used to generate a synthetic paral-
lel corpus from which to extract bilingual lexica.
Our approach does not require any additional re-
source besides the monolingual corpora used to
train the embeddings, and outperforms traditional
retrieval techniques by a substantial margin. We
thus conclude that, contrary to recent trend, future
work in BLI should not focus exclusively in direct
retrieval approaches, nor should BLI be the only
evaluation task for cross-lingual embeddings. Our
code is available at https://github.com/
artetxem/monoses.

In the future, we would like to further improve
our method by incorporating additional ideas from
unsupervised machine translation such as joint re-
finement and neural hybridization (Artetxe et al.,
2019). In addition to that, we would like to inte-
grate our induced dictionaries in other downstream
