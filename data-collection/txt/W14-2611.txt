Abstract of the talk 

In the past years, there has been an increasing 

amount of research done in the field of Sentiment 

Analysis. This was motivated by the growth in the 

volume of user-generated online data, the infor-

mation flood in Social Media and the applications 

Sentiment Analysis has to different fields – Mar-

keting, Business Intelligence, e-Law Making, De-

cision Support Systems, etc. Although many 

methods have been proposed to deal with senti-

ment detection and classification in diverse types 

of texts and languages, many challenges still arise 

when passing these methods from the research 

settings to real-life applications.  

 

In this talk, we will describe the manner in which 

we employed machine translation together with 

human-annotated data to extend a sentiment anal-

ysis system to various languages. Additionally, 

we will describe how a joint multilingual model 

that detects and classifies sentiments expressed in 

texts from Social Media has been developed (at 

this point for Twitter and Facebook) and demo its 

use in a real-life application: a project aimed at 

detecting the citizens’ attitude on Science and 

Technology.
