Abstract

The GLUE benchmark (Wang et al., 2019b) is
a suite of language understanding tasks which
has seen dramatic progress in the past year,
with average performance moving from 70.0
at launch to 83.9, state of the art at the time of
writing (May 24, 2019). Here, we measure hu-
man performance on the benchmark, in order
to learn whether significant headroom remains
for further progress. We provide a conser-
vative estimate of human performance on the
benchmark through crowdsourcing: Our an-
notators are non-experts who must learn each
task from a brief set of instructions and 20 ex-
amples. In spite of limited training, these an-
notators robustly outperform the state of the
art on six of the nine GLUE tasks and achieve
an average score of 87.1. Given the fast pace
of progress however, the headroom we ob-
serve is quite limited. To reproduce the data-
poor setting that our annotators must learn in,
we also train the BERT model (Devlin et al.,
2019) in limited-data regimes, and conclude
that low-resource sentence classification re-
mains a challenge for modern neural network
approaches to text understanding.

1 Introduction

This past year has seen tremendous progress in
building general purpose models that can learn
good language representations across a range of
tasks and domains (McCann et al., 2017; Peters
et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2019; Howard and
Ruder, 2018; Liu et al., 2019). Reusable models
like these can be readily adapted to different lan-
guage understanding tasks and genres. The Gen-
eral Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE;
Wang et al., 2019b) benchmark is designed to
evaluate such models. GLUE is built around
nine sentence-level natural language understand-
ing (NLU) tasks and datasets, including instances

of natural language inference, sentiment analysis,
acceptability judgment, sentence similarity, and
common sense reasoning.

The recent BigBird model (Liu et al., 2019)
—a fine-tuned variant of the BERT model (De-
vlin et al., 2019)—is state-of-the-art on GLUE at
the time of writing, with the original BERT right
at its heels. Both models perform impressively
enough on GLUE to prompt some increasingly
urgent questions: How much better are humans
at these NLP tasks? Do standard benchmarks
have enough headroom to meaningfully measure
further progress? In the case of one prominent
language understanding task with a known hu-
man performance number, SQuAD 2.0 (Rajpurkar
et al., 2018), models built on BERT come ex-
tremely close to human performance.1 On the
recent Situations With Adversarial Generations
(SWAG; Zellers et al., 2018) dataset, BERT out-
performs individual expert human annotators. In
this work, we estimate human performance on the
GLUE test set to determine which tasks see sub-
stantial remaining headroom between human and
machine performance.

While human performance or interannotator
agreement numbers have been reported on some
GLUE tasks, the data collection methods used
to establish those baselines vary substantially.
To maintain consistency in our reported baseline
numbers, and to ensure that our results are at least
roughly comparable to numbers for submitted ma-
chine learning models, we collect annotations us-
ing a uniform method for all nine tasks.

We hire crowdworker annotators: For each of
the nine tasks, we give the workers a brief training
exercise on the task, ask them to annotate a ran-
dom subset of the test data, and then collect major-
ity vote labels from five annotators for each exam-

Table 1: GLUE test set results. The Human baseline numbers are estimated using no more than 500 test examples.
All the BERT scores are for BERT-LARGE. As in the original GLUE paper, we report the Matthews correlation
coefficient for CoLA. For MRPC and Quora, we report accuracy then F1. For STS-B, we report Pearson then
Spearman correlation. For MNLI, we report accuracy on the matched then mismatched test sets. For all other tasks
we report accuracy. The Avg column shows the overall GLUE score: an average across each row, weighting each
task equally. The ∆bert and ∆bird rows show the difference between the Human performance baseline and BERT
and BigBird respectively. The starred(*) numbers for BigBird on QNLI show performance on the new version of
QNLI, while all other QNLI numbers are on the original version. The second section shows Human and BERT
performance on the subset of the test set where there is unanimous, 5-way annotator agreement, the ∆ row is the
difference between them. Training Size gives the number of examples in the full training set for each task. The
BERT-5000/1000/500 rows show test set results for BERT fine-tuned on no more than 5k, 1k, and 500 examples
respectively. Though MRPC and RTE have fewer than 5k examples, we rerun BERT fine-tuning and report these
results in the BERT-5000 row.

ple in the subset. Comparing these labels with the
ground-truth test labels yields an overall GLUE
score of 87.1—well above BERT’s 80.5 and Big-
Bird’s 82.9—and yields single-task scores that are
substantially better than both on six of nine tasks.
However, in light of the pace of recent progress
made on GLUE, the gap in most tasks is relatively
small. The one striking exception is the data-poor
Winograd Schema NLI Corpus (WNLI; based on
Levesque et al., 2012), in which humans outper-
form machines by over 30 percentage points.

To reproduce the data-poor training regime of
our annotators, and of WNLI, we investigate
BERT’s performance on data-poor versions of the
other GLUE tasks and find that it suffers consid-
erably in these low-resource settings. Ultimately
however, BERT’s performance seems genuinely
close to human performance and leaves limited
headroom in GLUE.

2 Background and Related Work

GLUE GLUE (Wang et al., 2019b) is composed
of nine sentence or sentence-pair classification or
regression tasks: MultiNLI (Williams et al., 2018),
RTE (competition releases 1–3 and 5, merged and
treated as a single binary classification task; Da-
gan et al. 2006, Bar Haim et al. 2006, Giampic-
colo et al. 2007, Bentivogli et al. 2009), QNLI (an
answer sentence selection task based on SQuAD;
Rajpurkar et al. 2016),2 and WNLI test natural
language inference. WNLI is derived from pri-
vate data created for the Winograd Schema Chal-
lenge (Levesque et al., 2012), which specifically
tests for common sense reasoning. The Microsoft

2Our human performance numbers for QNLI are on the
original test set since we collected data before the release
of the slightly revised second test set. BERT-LARGE’s per-
formance went up by 1.6 percentage points on the new test
set, and BERT-BASE’s performance saw a 0.5 point increase.
This suggests that our human performance number repre-
sents a reasonable—if very conservative—approximation of
human performance on QNLI.

Research Paraphrase Corpus (MRPC; Dolan and
Brockett, 2005), the Semantic Textual Similar-
ity Benchmark (STS-B; Cer et al., 2017), and
Quora Question Pairs (QQP)3 test paraphrase and
sentence similarity evaluation. The Corpus of
Linguistic Acceptability (CoLA; Warstadt et al.,
2018) tests grammatical acceptability judgment.
Finally, the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST;
Socher et al., 2013) tests sentiment analysis.

Human Evaluations on GLUE Tasks Warstadt
et al. (2018) report human performance numbers
on CoLA as well. Using the majority decision
from five expert annotators on 200 examples, they
get a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of
71.3. Bender (2015) also estimates human perfor-
mance on the original public Winograd Schema
Challenge (WSC) data. They use crowdworkers
and report an average accuracy of 92.1%. The
RTE corpus papers report inter-annotator agree-
ment numbers on their test sets: 80% on RTE-1,
89.2% on RTE-2, 87.8% on RTE-3, and 97.02%
on RTE-5. Wang et al. (2019b) report human per-
formance numbers on GLUE’s manually curated
diagnostic test set. The examples in this test set
are natural language inference sentence pairs that
are tagged for a set of linguistic phenomena. They
use expert annotators and report an average R3 co-
efficient of 0.8.

3 Data Collection Method

To establish human performance on GLUE, we
hire annotators through the Hybrid4 data collec-
tion platform, which is similar to Amazon’s Me-
chanical Turk. Each worker first completes a short
training procedure then moves on to the main an-
notation task. For the annotation phase, we tune
the pay rate for each task, with an average rate of
$17/hr. The training phase has a lower, standard
pay rate, with an average pay of $7.6/hr.

Training In the training phase for each GLUE
task, each worker answers 20 random examples
from the task development set. Each training page
links to instructions that are tailored to the task,
and shows five examples.5 The answers to these
examples can be revealed by clicking on a “Show”

button at the bottom of the page. We ask the work-
ers to label each set of examples and check their
work so they can familiarize themselves with the
task. Workers who get less than 65% of the exam-
ples correct during training do not qualify for the
main task. This is an intentionally low threshold
meant only to encourage a reasonable effort. Our
platform cannot fully prevent workers from chang-
ing their answers after viewing the correct labels,
so we cannot use the training phase as a substan-
tial filter. (See Appendix A.1 for details on the
training phase.)

Annotation We randomly sample 500 examples
from each task’s test set for annotation, with the
exception of WNLI where we sample 145 of the
147 available test examples (the two missing ex-
amples are the result of a data preparation error).
For each of these sampled data points, we collect
five annotations from five different workers (see
Appendix A.2). We use the test set since the test
and development sets are qualitatively different for
some tasks, and we wish to compare our results di-
rectly with those on the GLUE leaderboard.

4 Results and Discussions

To calculate the human performance baseline, we
take the majority vote across the five crowd-
sourced annotations. In the case of MultiNLI,
since there are three possible labels—entailment,
neutral, and contradiction—about 2% of exam-
ples see a tie between two labels. For these ties,
we take the label that is more frequent in the de-
velopment set. In the case of STS-B, we take an
average of the scalar annotator labels. Since we
only collect annotations for a subset of the data,
we cannot access the test set through the GLUE
leaderboard interface, we instead submit our pre-
dictions to the GLUE organizers privately.

We compare human performance to BERT and
BigBird. The human performance numbers in Ta-
ble 1 shows that overall our annotators stick it
to the Muppets on GLUE. However on MRPC,
QQP, and QNLI, Bigbird and BERT outperform
our annotators. The results on QQP are particu-
larly surprising: BERT and BigBird score over 12
F1 points better than our annotators. Our annota-
tors, however, are only given 20 examples and a
short set of instructions for training, while BERT
and BigBird are fine-tuned on the 364k-example
QQP training set. In addition, we find it difficult
to compose concise instructions for QQP that ac-

tually match the supplied labels. We do not have
access to the material used to create the dataset,
and we find it difficult to infer simple instructions
from the data (sample provided in Appendix B).
If given more training data, it is possible that our
annotators could better learn relatively subtle label
definitions that better fit the corpus.

Unanimous Vote To investigate the possible ef-
fect of ambiguous label definitions, we look at hu-
man performance when there is 5-way annotator
agreement. Using unanimous agreement, rather
than majority agreement, has the potential effect
of filtering out examples of two kinds: those for
which our supplied annotation guidelines don’t
provide clear advice and those for which humans
understand the expectations of the task but find the
example genuinely difficult or uncertain. To dis-
entangle the two effects, we also look at BERT re-
sults on this subset of the test set, as BERT’s use of
large training sets means that it should only suffer
in the latter cases. We get consent from the authors
of BERT to work in cooperation with the GLUE
team to measure BERT’s performance on this sub-
set, which we show in Table 1. Overall, we see the
gap widen between the human baseline and BERT
by 3.1 points. The largest shifts in performance
are on CoLA, MRPC, QQP, and WNLI. The rel-
ative jumps in performance on MRPC and QQP
support the claim that human performance is hurt
by imprecise guidelines and that the use of sub-
stantially more training data gives BERT an edge
on our annotators.

In general, BERT needs large datasets to fine-
tune on. This is further evidenced by its perfor-
mance discrepancy between MultiNLI and RTE:
human performance is similar for the two, whereas
BERT shows a 16.2 percentage point gap between
the two datasets. Both MultiNLI and RTE are
textual entailment datasets, but MultiNLI’s train-
ing set is quite large at 393k examples, while the
GLUE version of RTE has only 2.5k examples.
However, BigBird does not show as large a gap,
which may be because it employs a multi-task
learning approach which fine-tunes the model for
all sentence-pair tasks jointly. Their RTE classi-
fier, for example, benefits from the large training
dataset for the closely related MultiNLI task.

Low-Resource BERT Baseline To understand
the impact of abundant target tasks on the lim-
ited headroom that we observe, we train several

additional baselines. In these, we fine-tune BERT
on 5k, 1k, and 500 examples for each GLUE task
(or fewer for tasks with fewer training examples).
We use BERT for this analysis because the authors
have released their code and have provided pre-
trained weights for the model. We use their pub-
licly available implementation of BERT-LARGE,
their pretrained weights as the initialization for
fine-tuning on the GLUE tasks, and the hyperpa-
rameters they report. We see a precipitous drop
in performance on most tasks with large datasets,
with the exception of QNLI. A possible partial ex-
planation is that both QNLI and the BERT training
data come from English Wikipedia. On MRPC
and QQP however, BERT’s performance drops
below human performance in the 1k- and 500-
example settings. On the whole, we find that
BERT suffers in low-resource settings. These re-
sults are in agreement with the findings in Phang
et al. (2019) who conduct essentially the same ex-
periment.

CoLA Our human performance number on
CoLA is 4.9 points below what was reported in
Warstadt et al. (2018). We believe this discrepancy
is because they use linguistics PhD students as ex-
pert annotators while we use crowdworkers. This
further supports our belief that our human perfor-
mance baseline is a conservative estimate, and that
higher performance is possible, particularly with
more training.

WNLI No system on the GLUE leaderboard has
managed to exceed the performance of the most-
frequent-class baseline on WNLI, and several pa-
pers that propose methods for GLUE justify their
poor performance by asserting that the task must
be somehow broken.6 WNLI’s source Winograd
Schema data was constructed so as not to include
any statistical cues that a simple machine learning
system can exploit, which can make it quite dif-
ficult. The WNLI test set shows one of the high-
est human performance scores of the nine GLUE
tasks, reflecting its status as a corpus constructed
and vetted by artificial intelligence experts. This
affirms that tasks like WNLI with small training
sets (634 sentence pairs) and no simple cues re-
main a serious (and sometimes unacknowledged)
blind spot for modern neural network sentence un-
derstanding methods.

6Devlin et al. (2019), for example, mention that they avoid
“the problematic WNLI set”.

5 Conclusion

This paper presents a conservative estimate of hu-
man performance to serve as a target for the GLUE
sentence understanding benchmark. We obtain
this baseline with the help of crowdworker anno-
tators. We find that state-of-the-art models like
BERT are not far behind human performance on
most GLUE tasks. But we also note that, when
trained in low-resource settings, BERT’s perfor-
mance falls considerably. Given these results, and
the continued difficulty neural methods have with
the Winograd Schema Challenge, we argue that
future work on GLUE-style sentence understand-
ing tasks might benefit from a focus on learning
from smaller training sets. In work subsequent to
the main results of this paper, we have prepared
such a benchmark in the GLUE follow-up Super-
GLUE (Wang et al., 2019a).

A Crowd-Sourced Data Collection

A.1 Training Phase
During training, we provide a link to task-specific
instructions. As an example, the instructions for
CoLA are shown in Table 2. The instructions for
each task follows the same format: briefly describ-
ing the annotator’s job, explaining the labels, and
providing at least one example.

In addition to the task-specific instructions, we
provide general instructions about the training
phase. An example is given in Table 3. Lastly,
we provide a link to an FAQ page. The FAQ page
addresses the balance of the data. If the labels
are balanced, we tell the annotators so. If the la-
bels are not balanced, we assure the annotators
that they need not worry about assigning one la-
bel more frequently. For most tasks we also de-
scribe where the data comes from, e.g. news arti-
cles. All of the task specific instructions and FAQ
pages can be found at nyu-mll.github.io/
GLUE-human-performance/.

On each training page, each annotator is given
five examples to annotate. At the bottom of the
page, there is a “Show” button which reveals the
ground truth labels. If their submitted answer is
incorrect, the label is shown in red, otherwise it
is shown in black. In the instructions, the annota-
tor is asked to check their work with this button.
Given this procedure, we cannot prevent the an-
notators from changing their answer after viewing
the ground truth labels.

A.2 Annotation Phase
In the main data collection phase we provide the
annotators with a link to the same task-specific in-
structions (Table 2) and FAQ page used during the
training phase. We enforce the training phase as a
qualification for annotation, so crowdworkers can-
not participate in annotation without first complet-
ing the associated training.

B QQP Example

The 25 randomly sampled examples from the QQP
development set are given in Tables 4, 5, and 6.

New York University’s Center for Data Science is
collecting your answers for use in research on com-
puter understanding of English. Thank you for your
help!
We will present you with a sentence someone spoke.
Your job is to figure out, based on this sentence,
if the speaker is a native speaker of English. You
should ignore the general topic of the sentence and
focus on the fluency of the sentence.

• Choose correct if you think the sentence sounds
fluent and you think it was spoken by a native-
English speaker. Examples:

“A hundred men surrounded the fort.
“Everybody who attended last weeks huge
rally, whoever they were, signed the peti-
tion.”
“Where did you go and who ate what?”

• Choose incorrect if you think the sentence does
not sound completely fluent and may have been
spoken by a non-native English speaker. Exam-
ples:

“Sue gave to Bill a book.
“Mary came to be introduced by the bar-
tender and I also came to be.”
“The problem perceives easily.”

This project is a training task that needs to be completed before working on the main project on
Hybrid named Human Performance: CoLA. For this CoLA task, we have the true label and we
want to get information on how well people do on the task. This training is short but is designed to
help you get a sense of the questions and the expected labels.
Please note that the pay per HIT for this training task is also lower than it is for the main project
Human Performance: CoLA. Once you are done with the training, please proceed to the main task!
In this training, you must answer all the questions on the page and then, to see how you did, click
the Show button at the bottom of the page before moving onto the next HIT. The Show button will
reveal the true labels. If you answered correctly, the revealed label will be in black, otherwise it
will be in red. Please use this training and the provided answers to build an understanding of what
the answers to these questions looks like (the main project, Human Performance: CoLA, does not
have the answers on the page).

Table 3: Instructions about the training phase provided to workers. This example is for CoLA training. The only
change in instructions for other tasks is the name of the task.
