Abstract

We propose a simple yet effective
approach to learning bilingual word
embeddings (BWEs) from non-parallel
document-aligned data (based on the
omnipresent skip-gram model), and its
application to bilingual lexicon induction
(BLI). We demonstrate the utility of
the induced BWEs in the BLI task by
reporting on benchmarking BLI datasets
for three language pairs: (1) We show
that our BWE-based BLI models signifi-
cantly outperform the MuPTM-based and
context-counting models in this setting,
and obtain the best reported BLI results
for all three tested language pairs; (2)
We also show that our BWE-based BLI
models outperform other BLI models
based on recently proposed BWEs that
require parallel data for bilingual training.

1 Introduction

Dense real-valued vectors known as distributed
representations of words or word embeddings
(WEs) (Bengio et al., 2003; Collobert and We-
ston, 2008; Mikolov et al., 2013a; Pennington
et al., 2014) have been introduced recently as
part of neural network architectures for statisti-
cal language modeling. Recent studies (Levy and
Goldberg, 2014; Levy et al., 2015) have show-
cased a direct link and comparable performance to
“more traditional” distributional models (Turney
and Pantel, 2010), but the skip-gram model with
negative sampling (SGNS) (Mikolov et al., 2013c)
is still established as the state-of-the-art word rep-
resentation model, due to its simplicity, fast train-
ing, as well as its solid and robust performance
across a wide variety of semantic tasks (Baroni et
al., 2014; Levy et al., 2015).

A natural extension of interest from monolin-
gual to multilingual word embeddings has oc-

curred recently (Klementiev et al., 2012; Zou et
al., 2013; Mikolov et al., 2013b; Hermann and
Blunsom, 2014a; Hermann and Blunsom, 2014b;
Gouws et al., 2014; Chandar et al., 2014; Soyer
et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015). When operat-
ing in multilingual settings, it is highly desirable to
learn embeddings for words denoting similar con-
cepts that are very close in the shared inter-lingual
embedding space (e.g., the representations for the
English word school and the Spanish word es-
cuela should be very similar). These shared inter-
lingual embedding spaces may then be used in a
myriad of multilingual natural language process-
ing tasks, such as fundamental tasks of comput-
ing cross-lingual and multilingual semantic word
similarity and bilingual lexicon induction (BLI),
etc. However, all these models critically require at
least sentence-aligned parallel data and/or readily-
available translation dictionaries to induce bilin-
gual word embeddings (BWEs) that are consistent
and closely aligned over languages in the same se-
mantic space.

Contributions In this work, we alleviate the re-
quirements: (1) We present the first model that
is able to induce bilingual word embeddings from
non-parallel data without any other readily avail-
able translation resources such as pre-given bilin-
gual lexicons; (2) We demonstrate the utility of
BWEs induced by this simple yet effective model
in the BLI task from comparable Wikipedia data
on benchmarking datasets for three language pairs
(Vulić and Moens, 2013b). Our BLI model based
on our novel BWEs significantly outperforms a se-
ries of strong baselines that reported previous best
scores on these datasets in the same learning set-
ting, as well as other BLI models based on re-
cently proposed BWE induction models (Gouws
et al., 2014; Chandar et al., 2014). The focus of
the work is on learning lexicons from document-
aligned comparable corpora (e.g., Wikipedia arti-
cles aligned through inter-wiki links).

Figure 1: The architecture of our BWE Skip-Gram model for learning bilingual word embeddings from
document-aligned comparable data. Source language words and documents are drawn as gray boxes,
while target language words and documents are drawn as blue boxes. The right side of the figure (sepa-
rated by a vertical dashed line) illustrates how a pseudo-bilingual document is constructed from a pair of
two aligned documents; two documents are first merged, and then words in the pseudo-bilingual docu-
ment are randomly shuffled to ensure that both source and target language words occur as context words.

2 Model Architecture

In the following architecture description, we as-
sume that the reader is familiar with the main
assumptions and training procedure of SGNS
(Mikolov et al., 2013a; Mikolov et al., 2013c).
We extend the SGNS model to work with bilingual
document-aligned comparable data. An overview
of our architecture for learning BWEs from such
comparable data is given in fig. 1.

Let us assume that we possess a document-
aligned comparable corpus which is defined as
C = {d1, d2, . . . , dN} = {(dS1 , dT1 ), (dS2 , dT2 ),
. . . , (dSN , d

T
D)}, where dj = (dSj , dTj ) denotes a

pair of aligned documents in the source language
LS and the target language LT , respectively, and
N is the number of documents in the corpus.
V S and V T are vocabularies associated with lan-
guages LS and LT . The goal is to learn word em-
beddings for all words in both V S and V T that will
be semantically coherent and closely aligned over
languages in a shared cross-lingual word embed-
ding space.

In the first step, we merge two documents dSj
and dTj from the aligned document pair dj into
a single “pseudo-bilingual” document d′j and re-
move sentence boundaries. Following that, we
randomly shuffle the newly constructed pseudo-
bilingual document. The intuition behind this pre-
training completely random shuffling step1 (see

1In this paper, we investigate only the random shuffling
procedure and show that the model is fairly robust to different

fig. 1) is to assure that each word w, regardless
of its actual language, obtains word collocates
from both vocabularies. The idea of having bilin-
gual contexts for each pivot word in each pseudo-
bilingual document will steer the final model to-
wards constructing a shared inter-lingual embed-
ding space. Since the model depends on the align-
ment at the document level, in order to ensure
the bilingual contexts instead of monolingual con-
texts, it is intuitive to assume that larger window
sizes will lead to better bilingual embeddings. We
test this hypothesis and the effect of window size
in sect. 4.

The final model called BWE Skip-Gram
(BWESG) then relies on the monolingual vari-
ant of skip-gram trained on the shuffled pseudo-
bilingual documents.2 The model learns word em-
beddings for source and target language words
that are aligned over the d embedding dimen-
sions and may be represented in the same shared
cross-lingual embedding space. The BWESG-
based representation of word w, regardless of its
actual language, is then a d-dimensional vector:
~w = [f1, . . . , fk, . . . , fd], where fk ∈ R denotes
the score for the k-th inter-lingual feature within
the d-dimensional shared embedding space. Since
all words share the embedding space, semantic
similarity between words may be computed both

outputs of the procedure if the window size is large enough.
As one line of future work, we plan to investigate other, more
systematic and deterministic shuffling algorithms.

2We were also experimenting with GloVe and CBOW, but
they were falling behind SGNS on average.

monolingually and across languages. Given w,
the most similar word cross-lingually should be its
one-to-one translation, and we may use this intu-
ition to induce one-to-one bilingual lexicons from
comparable data.

In another interpretation, BWESG actually
builds BWEs based on (pseudo-bilingual) docu-
ment level co-occurrence. The window size pa-
rameter then just controls the amount of random
data dropout. With larger windows, the model
becomes prohibitively computationally expensive,
but in sect. 4 we show that the BLI performance
flattens out for “reasonably large” windows.

3 Experimental Setup

Training Data We use comparable Wikipedia data
introduced in (Vulić and Moens, 2013a; Vulić and
Moens, 2013b) available in three language pairs
to induce bilingual word embeddings: (i) a collec-
tion of 13, 696 Spanish-English Wikipedia article
pairs (ES-EN), (ii) a collection of 18, 898 Italian-
English Wikipedia article pairs (IT-EN), and (iii) a
collection of 7, 612 Dutch-English Wikipedia arti-
cle pairs (NL-EN). All corpora are theme-aligned
comparable corpora, that is, the aligned docu-
ment pairs discuss similar themes, but are in gen-
eral not direct translations. Following prior work
(Haghighi et al., 2008; Prochasson and Fung,
2011; Vulić and Moens, 2013b), we retain only
nouns that occur at least 5 times in the corpus.
Lemmatized word forms are recorded when avail-
able, and original forms otherwise. TreeTag-
ger (Schmid, 1994) is used for POS tagging and
lemmatization. After the preprocessing vocabular-
ies comprise between 7,000 and 13,000 noun types
for each language in each language pair. Exactly
the same training data and vocabularies are used to
induce bilingual lexicons with all other BLI mod-
els in comparison.
BWESG Training Setup We have trained the
BWESG model with random shuffling on 10 ran-
dom corpora shuffles for all three training cor-
pora with the following parameters from the
word2vec package (Mikolov et al., 2013c):
stochastic gradient descent with a default learning
rate of 0.025, negative sampling with 25 samples,
and a subsampling rate of value 1e−4. All models
are trained for 15 epochs. We have varied the num-
ber of embedding dimensions: d = 100, 200, 300,
and have also trained the model with d = 40 to
be directly comparable to pre-trained state-of-the-

art BWEs from (Gouws et al., 2014; Chandar et
al., 2014). Moreover, in order to test the effect of
window size on final results, we have varied the
maximum window size cs from 4 to 60 in steps of
4.3 Since cosine is used for all similarity compu-
tations in the BLI task, we call our new BLI model
BWESG+cos.
Baseline BLI Models We compare BWESG+cos
to a series of state-of-the-art BLI models from
document-aligned comparable data:
(1) BiLDA-BLI - A BLI model that relies on the
induction of latent cross-lingual topics (Mimno et
al., 2009) by the bilingual LDA model and repre-
sents words as probability distributions over these
topics (Vulić et al., 2011).
(2) Assoc-BLI - A BLI model that represents
words as vectors of association norms (Roller and
Schulte im Walde, 2013) over both vocabularies,
where these norms are computed using a multilin-
gual topic model (Vulić and Moens, 2013a).
(3) PPMI+cos - A standard distributional model
for BLI relying on positive pointwise mutual infor-
mation and cosine similarity (Bullinaria and Levy,
2007). The seed lexicon is bootstrapped using the
method from (Peirsman and Padó, 2011; Vulić and
Moens, 2013b).

All parameters of the baseline BLI models (i.e.,
topic models and their settings, the number of
dimensions K, feature pruning values, window
size) are set to their optimal values according to
suggestions in prior work (Steyvers and Griffiths,
2007; Vulić and Moens, 2013a; Vulić and Moens,
2013b; Kiela and Clark, 2014). Due to space con-
straints, for (much) more details about the base-
lines we point to the relevant literature (Peirsman
and Padó, 2011; Tamura et al., 2012; Vulić and
Moens, 2013a; Vulić and Moens, 2013b).
Test Data For each language pair, we evaluate on
standard 1,000 ground truth one-to-one translation
pairs built for the three language pairs (ES/IT/NL-
EN) (Vulić and Moens, 2013a; Vulić and Moens,
2013b). Translation direction is ES/IT/NL→ EN.
Evaluation Metrics Since we can build a one-
to-one bilingual lexicon by harvesting one-to-one
translation pairs, the lexicon qualiy is best re-
flected in the Acc1 score, that is, the number
of source language (ES/IT/NL) words wSi from
ground truth translation pairs for which the top
ranked word cross-lingually is the correct trans-

4 Results and Discussion

Exp 0: Qualitative Analysis Tab. 1 displays
top 10 semantically similar words monolingually,
across-languages and combined/multilingually for
one ES, IT and NL word. The BWESG+cos model
is able to find semantically coherent lists of words
for all three directions of similarity (i.e., mono-
lingual, cross-lingual, multilingual). In the com-
bined (multilingual) ranked lists, words from both
languages are represented as top similar words.
This initial qualitative analysis already demon-
strates the ability of BWESG to induce a shared
cross-lingual embedding space using only docu-
ment alignments as bilingual signals.
Exp I: BWESG+cos vs. Baseline Models In the
first experiment, we test whether our BWESG+cos
BLI model produces better results than the base-
line BLI models which obtain current state-of-the-
art results for BLI from comparable data on these
test sets. Tab. 2 summarizes the BLI results.

As the most striking finding, the results reveal
superior performance of the BWESG-cos model
for BLI which relies on our new framework for in-
ducing bilingual word embeddings over other BLI
models relying on previously used bilingual word
representations. The relative increase in Acc1
scores over the best scoring baseline BLI mod-
els from comparable data is 19.4% for the ES-EN
pair, 6.1% for IT-EN (significant at p < 0.05 us-
ing McNemar’s test) and 65.4% for NL-EN. For
large enough values for cs (cs ≥ 20) (see also

Table 2: BLI performance for all tested BLI
models for ES/IT/NL-EN, with all bilingual word
representations except CHANDAR and GOUWS
learned from comparable Wikipedia data. The
scores for BWESG+cos are computed as post-hoc
averages over 10 random shuffles.

fig. 2(a)-2(c)), almost all BWESG+cos models for
all language pairs outperform the highest baseline
results. We may also observe that the performance
of BWESG+cos is fairly stable for all models with
larger values for cs (cs ≥ 20). This finding re-
veals that even a coarse tuning of these parameters
might lead to optimal or near-optimal scores in the
BLI task with BWESG+cos.
Exp II: Shuffling and Window Size Since our
BWESG model relies on the pre-training random
shuffling procedure, we also test whether the shuf-
fling has significant or rather minor impact on the
induction of BWEs and final BLI scores. There-
fore, in fig. 2, we present maximum, minimum,
and average Acc1 scores for all three language
pairs obtained using 10 different random corpora
shuffles with d = 100, 200, 300 and varying val-

ues for cs. Results reveal that random shuffling
affects the overall BLI scores, but the variance of
results is minimal and often highly insignificant. It
is important to mark that even the minimum Acc1
scores over these 10 different random shuffles are
typically higher than the previous state-of-the-art
baseline scores for large enough values for d and
cs (compare the results in tab. 2 and fig. 2(a)-2(c)).
A comparison with the BWESG model without
shuffling (NOS on fig. 2) reveals that shuffling is
useful even for larger cs-s.
Exp III: BWESG+cos vs. BWE-Based BLI We
also compare our BWESG BLI model with two
other models that are most similar to ours in spirit,
as they also induce shared cross-lingual word em-
bedding spaces (Chandar et al., 2014; Gouws et
al., 2014), proven superior to or on a par with
the BLI model from (Mikolov et al., 2013b). We
use their pre-trained BWEs (obtained from the au-
thors) and report the BLI scores in tab. 2. To
make the comparison fair, we search for transla-
tions over the same vocabulary as with all other
models. The results clearly reveal that, although
both other BWE models critically rely on paral-
lel Europarl data for training, and Gouws et al.
(2014) in addition train on entire monolingual
Wikipedias in both languages, our simple BWE in-
duction model trained on much smaller amounts of
document-aligned non-parallel data produces sig-
nificantly higher BLI scores for IT-EN and ES-EN
with sufficiently large windows.

However, the results for NL-EN with all BLI
models from comparable data from tab. 2 are sig-
nificantly lower than with the GOUWS BWEs. We
attribute it to using less (and clearly insufficient)
document-aligned training data for NL-EN (i.e.,
training corpora for ES-EN and IT-EN are almost
double or triple the size of training corpora for NL-
EN, see sect. 3).

5 Conclusions and Future Work
We have proposed Bilingual Word Embeddings
Skip-Gram (BWESG), a simple yet effective
model that is able to learn bilingual word em-
beddings solely on the basis of document-aligned
comparable data. We have demonstrated its utility
in the task of bilingual lexicon induction from such
comparable data, where our new BWESG-based
BLI model outperforms state-of-the-art models for
BLI from document-aligned comparable data and
related BWE induction models.

The low-cost BWEs may be used in other (se-
mantic) tasks besides the ones discussed here, and
it would be interesting to experiment with other
types of context aggregation and selection beyond
random shuffling, and other objective functions.
Preliminary studies also demonstrate the utility of
the BWEs in monolingual and cross-lingual infor-
mation retrieval (Vulić and Moens, 2015).

Finally, we may use the knowledge of BWEs
obtained by BWESG from document-aligned data
to learn bilingual correspondences (e.g., word
translation pairs or lists of semantically simi-
lar words across languages) which may in turn
be used for representation learning from large
unaligned multilingual datasets as proposed in
(Haghighi et al., 2008; Mikolov et al., 2013b;
Vulić and Moens, 2013b). In the long run, this
idea may lead to large-scale fully data-driven rep-
resentation learning models from huge amounts of
multilingual data without any “pre-requirement”
for parallel data or manually built lexicons.
