MT Tiered Model Introduction

Proceedings of AMTA 2018, vol. 2: MT Users' Track Boston, March 17 - 21, 2018   |   Page 154



What is MT Tiered Model

For different languages and content types, 
apply different Machine Translation + Post 
Editing strategy, to get expected quality with 
reasonable cost and time saving.

1st Pilot

CONFIDENTIAL 11

Plan

• Languages
• Sample content
• Identify

stakeholders
• Tool (the Timer)

development

Execution

• Online PE
• Same content by

different linguists
• Same scope by

different linguists

Evaluation

• End users to
evaluate if the
MTPE content is
acceptable

Conclusion

• Result based on
the Evaluation

Proceedings of AMTA 2018, vol. 2: MT Users' Track Boston, March 17 - 21, 2018   |   Page 160



Tool: the Timer

CONFIDENTIAL 12

A productivity tracking tool embedded in 
the online editor.

Timer Status change:
• manually(by three buttons)

o Start 
o Pause/Finish 
o Resume

• automatically:
o Auto start after segment editor in active
o Auto pause after 3 min idle time
o Auto save every 1 min.

Data captured (per file or per user):
• Total Word Count
• Total Segments
• Avg. Segment Size (in words)
• Total Time (in min.)
• Cost Time/1k Words  (in min.)
• Productivity (words/hour)

Evaluation Result from End Users

CONFIDENTIAL 14

Do you like the Chinese 
translation of this material (MPE)?

YES. The translation 
looks good to me.

Do you like the Spanish  translation 
of this material (LPE)?

NO. There are too many grammar 
issues and the translation is hard to 
be understandable.

Next Steps

CONFIDENTIAL 15

• Use MPE in Simplified Chinese – start from the lowest page-view pages.

• Re-evaluate the quality expectation and LPE guideline for Spanish.

• Evolve the XPE guidelines per language.

• Further develop the productivity tool for continuous tracking.

• NMT impact?
