Abstract

We describe two projects funded by the
Connecting Europe Facility, Provision of
Web-Scale Parallel Corpora for Official
European Languages (2016-EU-IA-0114,
completed) and Broader Web-Scale Pro-
vision of Parallel Corpora for European
Languages (2017-EU-IA-0178, ongoing),
which aim at harvesting parallel corpora
from the Internet for languages used in the
European Union. In addition to parallel
corpora, the project releases successive ver-
sions of the free/open-source web crawling
software used.

1 Introduction

Two projects are described in this abstract: Pro-
vision of Web-Scale Parallel Corpora for Offi-
cial European Languages (Action 2016-EU-IA-
0114, September 2017–March 2019, completed)
or Paracrawl, and Broader Web-Scale Provision of
Parallel Corpora for European Languages (Action
2017-EU-IA-0178, September 2018–September
2020, ongoing), or Paracrawl-2. Both are funded
by the Connecting Europe Facility and have the
same objective: to harvest parallel data from the
Internet for languages used in the European Union.
Namely, the first action focuses on parallel data be-
tween English and the other 23 official languages of
the European Union, while the second one includes
new pairs of languages, such as the pairs consist-
ing of Spanish and the three regional languages
recognized by Spain (Catalan, Basque, and Gali-
cian) or the two Norwegian languages (Bokml and
Nynorsk). In addition to parallel corpora (see sec-
tion 2, the project periodically releases versions of

the free/open-source web-crawling software used,
Bitextor (see section 3).

1.1 The consortium
Five partners are involved in these projects; two
academic partners and three companies: The
University of Edinburgh (coordinator), Edinburgh
(UK); Universitat d’Alacant, Alacant (Spain);
Prompsit Language Engineering S.L., Elx (Spain);
TAUS B.V, Amsterdam (the Netherlands); Omni-
scien Technologies (trading) B.V., Zoetermeer (the
Netherlands, only Paracrawl2).

2 Corpora built

Table 1 summarizes the most recent release, ver-
sion 4, of parallel data between English and the
remaining 23 languages of the European Union.

ParaCrawl corpora are publicly available under
the Creative Commons CC0 license and can be
found at the ParaCrawl website1 and the ELRC-
share repository. 2

Random samples of 2,000 sentences for each
language combination were validated by language
experts for version 3 of the corpora allowing to
tackle some of the most prominent issues before
the release of version 4. Also, an extrinsic evalua-
tion through MT was performed for some language
pairs. It consistently confirms the positive impact
of adding ParaCrawl corpora to baseline systems.3

3 Free/open-source crawling pipeline

One of the outputs of these projects is the free/open-
source pipeline implemented to build the corpora in
Table 1. The last version of this pipeline has been

Table 1: Statistics for the Paracrawl corpus, version 4

released as version 7 of the parallel-data-crawling
tool Bitextor.4 This pipeline covers all the stages
from crawling data from websites on the Internet
to delivering a clean parallel corpus. Namely, the
stages included in this process are: (1) download-
ing HTML documents from the Internet; (2) pre-
processing, normalizing and augmenting informa-
tion from these documents; (3) aligning documents
that are parallel; (4) aligning the segments in each
of the document pairs identified; (5) filtering noisy
data, deduplicating and formatting the output.

From the beginning of Paracrawl actions, sev-
eral tools and modules have been contributed by
the partners of the consortium and integrated in
Bitextor. After a partial re-implementation of the
pipeline control module (workflow manager), the
tool is now highly configurable, allowing to run
the pipeline using alternative components for the
different stages of processing. Bitextor 7 was de-
signed for high scalability in order to tackle the
challenges of dealing with large amounts of data
coming from thousands, or hundreds of thousands,

4https://github.com/bitextor/bitextor

of websites crawled from the Internet. It is built
to work with distributed clusters such as SLURM
and PBS Pro and cloud computing, with specific
support for Azure.

It is also worth to mention Bicleaner,5 a tool to
filter parallel data that has been integrated in the Bi-
textor pipeline. This tool, which ranked among the
best systems in the shared task on parallel corpora
cleaning at WMT 2018 (Sánchez-Cartagena et al.,
2018), is especially useful when dealing with noisy
corpora such as those obtained through massive
crawling from the Internet.

All the modules released as part of Bitextor 7
can be used within the pipeline or independently, to
create new pipelines for specific purposes.

4 Future work

Paracrawl2 action is ongoing; some of the most
relevant objectives for the next months of project
are: adding Icelandic, Norwegian (Bokmål and
Nynorsk), Basque, Catalan/Valencian, and Gali-
cian to the languages already covered languages;
covering formats different to HTML (PDF, DOCX,
ODT, etc.);including domain identification to sup-
port the extraction of relevant data from ParaCrawl
corpora; processing the Internet Archive6 to gather
new parallel data; improving Bitextor by improv-
ing document and segment alignment and corpus
cleaning; improving data exploitation by repair-
ing rather than simply discarding and by segment-
ing too long sentences into clauses; delivering ran-
domised, anonymised, partially omitted and mixed
data sets to extend their usage; formalising human
and automatic evaluation for quality testing.

In addition to the work covered in the ongoing
action, four of the partners of the Paracrawl2 consor-
tium have recently been awarded a new Connecting
Europe Facility action, Continued Web-Scale Provi-
sion of Parallel Corpora for European Languages
(Action 2018-EU-IA-0063, Paracrawl-3), which
will extend the results of the previous projects.
