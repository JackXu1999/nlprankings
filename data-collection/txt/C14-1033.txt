Abstract

In this paper we present a readability assessment system for Basque, ErreXail, which is going
to be the preprocessing module of a Text Simplification system. To that end we compile two
corpora, one of simple texts and another one of complex texts. To analyse those texts, we imple-
ment global, lexical, morphological, morpho-syntactic, syntactic and pragmatic features based
on other languages and specially considered for Basque. We combine these feature types and we
train our classifiers. After testing the classifiers, we detect the features that perform best and the
most predictive ones.

1 Introduction

Readability assessment is a research line that aims to grade the difficulty or the ease of the texts. It has
been a remarkable question in the educational domain during the last century and is of great importance
in Natural Language Processing (NLP) during the last decade. Classical readability formulae like Flesh
formula (Flesch, 1948), Dale-Chall formula (Chall and Dale, 1995) and The Gunning FOG index (Gun-
ning, 1968) take into account raw and lexical features and frequency counts. NLP techniques, on the
other hand, make possible the consideration of more complex features.

Recent research in NLP (Si and Callan, 2001; Petersen and Ostendorf, 2009; Feng, 2009) has demon-
strated that classical readability formulae are unreliable. Moreover, those metrics are language specific.

Readability assessment is also used as a preprocess or evaluation in Text Simplification (TS) systems
e.g. for English (Feng et al., 2010), Portuguese (Aluı́sio et al., 2010), Italian (Dell’Orletta et al., 2011),
German (Hancke et al., 2012) and Spanish (Štajner and Saggion, 2013). Given a text the aim of these
systems is to decide whether a text is complex or not. So, in case of being difficult, the given text should
be simplified.

As far as we know no specific metric has been used to calculate the complexity of Basque texts. The
only exception we find is a system for the auto-evaluation of essays Idazlanen Autoebaluaziorako Sistema
(IAS) (Aldabe et al., 2012) which includes metrics similar to those used in readability assessment. IAS
analyses Basque texts after several criteria focused on educational correction such as the clause number
in a sentence, types of sentences, word types and lemma number among others. It was foreseen to use
this tool in the Basque TS system (Aranzabe et al., 2012). The present work means to add to IAS the
capacity of evaluating the complexity of texts by means of new linguistic features and criteria.

In this paper we present ErreXail, a readability assessment system for Basque, a Pre-Indo-European
agglutinative head-final pro-drop language, which displays a rich inflectional morphology and whose
orthography is phonemic. ErreXail classifies the texts and decides if they should be simplified or not.
This work has two objectives: to build a classifier which will be the preprocess of the TS system and to
know which are the most predictive features that differ in complex and simple texts. The study of the
most predictive features will help in the linguistic analysis of the complex structures of Basque as well.

This paper is organised as follows: In section 2 we offer an overview about this topic. We present the
corpora we gathered and its processing in section 3. In section 4 we summarise the linguistic features we

implemented and we present the experiments and their results in section 5. The present system, ErreXail,
is described in section 6 and in section 7 we compare our work with other studies. Finally, we conclude
and outline the future work (section 8).

2 Related work

In the last years new methods have been proposed to assess the readability in NLP. For English, Si
and Callan (2001) use statistical models, exactly unigram language models, combined with traditional
readability features like sentence length and number of syllables per word. Coh-Metrix (Graesser et al.,
2004) is a tool that analyses multiple characteristics and levels of language-discourse such us narrativity,
word concreteness or noun overlap. In the 3.0 version1 108 indices are available. Pitler and Nenkova
(2008) use lexical, syntactic, and discourse features emphasising the importance of discourse features as
well. Schwarm and Ostendorf (2005) combine features from statistical language models, parse features,
and other traditional features using support vector machines.

It is very interesting to take a look at readability systems for other languages as well. Some readability
metrics take them into account special characteristics linked to languages. For example, in Chinese the
number of strokes is considered (Pang, 2006), in Japanese the different characters (Sato et al., 2008), in
German the word formation (vor der Brück et al., 2008), in French the passé simple (François and Fairon,
2012) and the orthographic neighbourhood (Gala et al., 2013) and in Swedish vocabulary resources
(Sjöholm, 2012; Falkenjack et al., 2013) among many other features. For Portuguese, Coh-metrix has
been adapted (Scarton and Aluı́sio, 2010) and in Arabic language-specific formulae have been used (Al-
Ajlan et al., 2008; Daud et al., 2013). Looking at free word order, head final and rich morphology
languages, Sinha et al. (2012) propose two new measures for Hindi and for Bangla based on English
formulae. Other systems use only machine learning techniques, e.g. for Chinese (Chen et al., 2011).

The systems whose motivation is Text Simplification analyse linguistic features of the text and then
they use machine learning techniques to build the classifiers. These systems have been created for English
(Feng et al., 2010), Portuguese (Aluı́sio et al., 2010), Italian (Dell’Orletta et al., 2011) and German
(Hancke et al., 2012). We follow the similar methodology for Basque since we share the same aim.

Readability assessment can be focused on different domains such as legal, medical, education and so
on. Interesting points about readability are presented in DuBay (2004) and an analysis of the methods
and a review of the systems is presented in Benjamin (2012) and Zamanian and Heydari (2012).

3 Corpora

Being our aim to build a model to distinguish simple and complex texts and to know which are the
most predictive features based on NLP techniques, we needed to collect the corpora. We gathered texts
from the web and compiled two corpora. The first corpus, henceforth T-comp, is composed by 200
texts (100 articles and 100 analysis) from the Elhuyar aldizkaria2, a monthly journal about science and
technology in Basque. T-comp is meant to be the complex corpus. The second corpus, henceforth T-simp,
is composed by 200 texts from ZerNola3, a website to popularise science among children up to 12 years
and the texts we collected are articles. To find texts specially written for children was really challenging.
Main statistics about both corpora are presented in Table 1.

Corpus Docs. Sentences Tokens Verbs Nouns
T-comp 200 8593 161161 52229 59510
T-simp 200 2363 39565 12203 13447

4 Linguistic features

In this section we summarise the linguistic features implemented to analyse the complexity of the texts.
We distinguish different groups of features: global, lexical, morphological, morpho-syntactic, syntactic
and pragmatic features. There are in total 94 features. Most of the features we present have already been
included in systems for other languages but others have been specially considered for Basque.

4.1 Global features
Global features take into account the document as whole and serve to give an overview of the texts. They
are presented in Table 2.

Averages
Average of words per sentence
Average of clauses per sentence

Average of letters per word

Table 2: Global features

These features are based on classical readability formulae and in the criteria taken on the simplification
study (Gonzalez-Dios, 2011), namely the sentence length and the clause number per sentence. They are
also included in IAS (Aldabe et al., 2012).

4.2 Lexical features
Lexical features are based on lemmas. We calculate the ratios of all the POS tags and different kinds of
abbreviations and symbols. We concentrate on particular types of substantives and verbs as well. Part of
theses ratios are shown in Table 3. In total there are 39 ratios in this group.

Ratios
Unique lemmas / all the lemmas

Each POS / all the words
Proper Nouns / all the nouns
Named entities / all the nouns

Verbal nouns / all the verbs
Modal verbs / all the verbs

Causative verbs / all the verbs
Intransitive verbs with one arg. (Nor verbs) / all the verbs

Intransitive verbs with two arg. (Nor-Nori verbs) / all the verbs
Transitive verbs with two arg. (Nor-Nork verbs) / all the verbs

Transitive verbs with three arg. (Nor-Nori-Nork) verbs / all the verbs
Acronyms / all the words

Abbreviations / all the words
Symbols / all the words

Table 3: Lexical features

Among those features, we want to point out the causative verbs and the intransitive or transitive verbs
with one, two or three arguments (arg.) as features related to Basque. Causative verbs are verbs with the

336



suffix -arazi and they are usually translated as “to make someone + verb”, e.g. edanarazi, that stands
for “to make someone drink”. Other factitive verbs are translated without using that paraphrase like
jakinarazi that means “to notify”, lit. “to make know”. The transitivity classification is due to the fact
that Basque verb agrees with three grammatical cases (ergative Nork, absolutive Nor and dative Nori)
and therefore verbs are grouped according to the arguments they take in Basque grammars.

4.3 Morphological features

Morphological features analyse the different ways lemmas can be realised. These features are sum-
marised in Table 4 and there are 24 ratios in total.

Ratios
Each case ending / all the case endings

Each verb aspect / all the verbs
Each verb tense / all the verbs
Each verb mood / all the verbs

Words with ellipsis / all the words
Each type of words with ellipsis / all the words with ellipsis

Table 4: Morphological features

Basque has 18 case endings (absolutive, ergative, inessive, allative, genitive...), that is, 18 different
endings can be attached to the end of the noun phrases. For example, if we attach the inessive -n to
the noun phrase etxea “the house”, we get etxean “at home”. The verb features considered the forms
obtained with the inflection.

Verb morphology is very rich in Basque as well. The aspect is attached to the part of the verb which
contains the lexical information. There are 4 aspects: puntual (aoristic), perfective, imperfective and
future aspect. Verb tenses are usually marked in the auxiliary verb and there are four tenses: present,
past, irreal and archaic future4. The verbal moods are indicative, subjunctive, imperative and potential.
The latter is used to express permissibility or possible circumstances.

Due to the typology of Basque, ellipsis5 is a normal phenomenon and ellipsis can be even found
within a word (verbs, nouns, adjective...); for instance, dioguna which means “what we say”. This kind
of ellipsis occurs e.g. in English, Spanish, French and German as well but in these languages it is realised
as a sentence; but it is expressed only by a word in Basque.

4.4 Morpho-syntactic features

Morpho-syntactic features are based on the shallow parsing (chunks6) and in the apposition detection
(appositions). These features are presented in Table 5.

Ratios
Noun phrases (chunks) / all the phrases

Noun phrases (chunks) / all the sentences
Verb phrases / all the phrases
Appositions / all the phrases

Appositions / all the noun phrases (chunks)

Table 5: Morpho-syntactic features

Contrary to the features so far presented, the morpho-syntactic features take into account mainly more
than a word. About apposition, there are 2 types in Basque (Gonzalez-Dios et al., 2013) but we consider
all the instances together in this work.

4The archaic future we also take into account is not used anymore, but it can be found in old texts. Nowadays, the aspect is
used to express actions in the future.

5Basque is a pro-drop language and it is very normal to omit the subject, the object and the indirect object because they are
marked in the verb. We do not treat this kind of ellipsis in the present work.

6Chunks are a continuum of elements with a head and syntactic sense that do not overlap (Abney, 1991).

337



4.5 Syntactic features
Syntactic features consider average of the subordinate clauses and types of subordinate clauses. They
are outlined in Table 6 and there are 10 ratios in total. The types of adverbial clauses are temporal,
causal, conditional, modal, concessive, consecutive and modal-temporal. The latter is a clause type
which expresses manner and simultaneity of the action in reference to the main clause.

Ratios
Subordinate clauses / all the clauses

Relative clauses / subordinate clauses
Completive clauses / subordinate clauses
Adverbial clauses / subordinate clauses

Each type of adverbial clause / subordinate clauses

Table 6: Syntactic features

In this first approach we decided not to use dependency based features like dependency depth or
distance from dependent to head because dependency parsing is time consuming and slows down the
preprocessing. Moreover, the importance of syntax is under discussion: Petersen and Ostendorf (2009)
find that syntax does not have too much influence while Sjöholm (2012) shows that dependencies are
not necessary. Pitler and Nenkova (2008) pointed out the importance of syntax. but Dell’Orletta et
al. (2011) demonstrate that for document classification reliable results can be found without syntax.
Anyway, syntax is necessary for sentence classification.

4.6 Pragmatic features
In our cases, the pragmatic features we examine are the cohesive devices. These features are summed up
in Table 7. There are 12 ratios in total.

Ratios
Each type of conjunction / all the conjunctions

Each type of sentence connector / all the sentence connectors

Table 7: Pragmatic features

Conjunction types are additive, adversative and disjuntive. Sentence connector types are additive,
adversative, disjuntive, clarificative, causal, consecutive, concessive and modal.

5 Experiments

We performed two experiments, the first one to build a classifier and the second one to know which are
the most predictive features. For both tasks we used the WEKA tool (Hall et al., 2009).

In the first experiment we ran 5 classifiers and evaluated their performance. Those classifiers were
Random Forest (Breiman, 2001), the J48 decision tree (Quinlan, 1993), K-Nearest Neighbour, IBk (Aha
et al., 1991), Naı̈ve Bayes (John and Langley, 1995) and Support Vector Machine with SMO algorithm
(Platt, 1998). We used 10 fold cross-validation, similar to what has been done in other studies.

Taking into account all the features presented in section 4, the best results were obtained using SMO.
This way, 89.50 % of the instances were correctly classified. The F -measure for complex text was 0.899
%, for simple texts was 0.891 % and the MAE was 0.105 %. The results using all the features are shown
in Table 8.

Random Forest J48 IBk Naı̈ve Bayes SMO
88.50 84.75 72.00 84.50 89.50

Table 8: Classification results using all the features

We classified each feature type on their own as well and the best results were obtained using only
lexical features, 90.75 %. The classification results according to their feature group are presented in
Table 9. We only present the classifiers with the best results and these are remarked in bold.

Synt. 71.25 73.75 67.75
Prag. 67.50 70.50 65.75

Table 9: Classification results of each feature type

We also made different combinations of feature types and the accuracy was improved. The best com-
bination group was the one formed by lexical, morphological, morpho-syntactic and syntactic features
and they obtain 93.50 % with SMO. Best results are show in Table 10.

Lex+Morph+Morph-sint+Sintax+Prag 88.50 90.25

Sintax+Prag 78.25 73.50

Table 10: Classification results using different feature combinations

Combining the feature types, SMO is the best classifier in most of the cases but Random Forest out-
performs the results when there are no lexical features.

In the second experiment, we analysed which were the most predictive linguistic features in each
group. We used Weka’s Information Gain (InfoGain AttributeEval) to create the ranking and we ran it
for each feature group. In Table 11 we present the 10 most predictive features taking all the features
groups into account.

The results of this experiment are interesting for the linguistic studies on Text Simplification. It shows
us indeed which phenomena we should work on next. In these experiment we notice as well the relevance
of the lexical features and that syntactic features are not so decisive in document classification.

The features with relevance 0 have been analysed as well. Some of them are e.g. the ratio of the
inessive among all the case endings, the ratio of the indicative mood among all the verbal moods, the
ratio of the adjectives among all the words and the ratio of the ratio of the present tense among all the
verbal tenses.

We also performed a classification experiment with the top 10 features and J48 is the best classifier
(its best performance as well). These results are presented in Table 12.

To sum up, our best results are obtained using a combination of features (Lex+Morph+Morph-
sint+Sintax). We want to remark the importance of lexical features as well, since they alone outperform
all the features and 5 of them are among the top ten features.

6 System overview

The readability system for Basque ErreXail has a three-stage architecture (Figure 1).
So, given a Basque written text, we follow next steps:

1. The linguistic analysis will be carried out, that is, morpho-syntactic tagging, lemmatisation, syntac-
tic function identification, named entity recognition, shallow parsing, sentence and clause bound-
aries determination and apposition identification will be performed. We will use the tools presented
in section 3.

339



Feature and group Relevance
Proper nouns / common nouns ratio (Lex.) 0.2744

Appositions / noun phrases ratio (Morpho-synt.) 0.2529
Appositions / all phrases ratio (Morpho-synt.) 0.2529
Named entities / common nouns ratio (Lex.) 0.2436
Unique lemmas / all the lemmas ratio (Lex.) 0.2394

Acronyms / all the words ratio (Lex.) 0.2376
Causative verbs / all the verbs ratio (Lex.) 0.2099

Modal-temporal clauses / subordinate clauses ratio (Synt.) 0.2056
Destinative case endings / all the case endings ratio (Morph.) 0.1968
Connectors of clarification / all the connectors ratio (Prag.) 0.1957

2. Texts will be analysed according to the features and measures presented in section 4.

3. We will use the SMO Support Vector Machine as classification model, since that was the best
classifier in the experiments exposed in section 5. To speed up the process for Text Simplification,
we will analyse only the combination of lexical, morphological, morpho-syntactic and syntactic
(Lex+Morph+Morph-sint+Sintax) features.

Although the first application of this system will be the preprocessing of texts for the Basque TS
system, the system we present in this paper is independent and can be used for any other application. We
want to remark that this study, as it is based on other languages, could be applied to any other language
as well provided that the text could be analysed similar to us.

7 Discussion

The task of text classification has been carried out by several studies before. Due to our small corpus
we were only able to discriminate between complex and simple texts like Dell’Orletta et al. (2011) and
Hancke et al. (2012), other studies have classified more complexity levels (Schwarm and Ostendorf,
2005; Aluı́sio et al., 2010; François and Fairon, 2012). In this section we are going to compare our
system with other systems that share our same goal, namely to know which texts should be simplified.

Comparing our experiment with studies that classify two grades and use SMO, Hancke et al. (2012)
obtain an accuracy of 89.7 % with a 10 fold cross-validation. These results are very close to ours, al-
though their data compiles 4603 documents and ours 400. According to the feature type, their best type
is the morphological, obtaining 85.4 % of accuracy. Combining lexical, language model and morpho-
logical features they obtain 89.4 % of accuracy. To analyse their 10 most predictive features, they use
Information Gain as well but we do not share any feature in common.

Dell’Orletta et al. (2011) perform three different experiments but only their first experiment is similar
to our work. For that classification experiment they use 638 documents and follow a 5 fold cross-
validation process of the Euclidian distance between vectors. Taking into account all the features the
accuracy of their system is 97.02 %. However, their best performance is 98.12 % when they only use the
combination of raw, lexical and morpho-syntactic features.

340



Aluı́sio et al. (2010) assess the readability of the texts according to three levels: rudimentary, basic
and advanced. In total they compile 592 texts. Using SMO, 10 fold cross-validation and standard classi-
fication, they obtain 0.276 MAE taking into account all the features. The F -measure for original texts is
0.913, for natural simplification 0.483 and for strong simplification 0.732. They experiment with feature
types as well but they obtain their best results using all the features. Among their highly correlated fea-
tures they present the incidence of apposition in second place as we do here. We do not have any other
feature in common.

Among other readability assessment whose motivation is TS, Feng et al. (2010) use LIBSVM (Chang
and Lin, 2001) and Logistic Regression from WEKA and 10 fold cross-validation. They assess the
readability of grade texts and obtain as best results 59.63 % with LIBSVM and 57.59 % with Logistic
Regression. Since they assess different grades and use other classifiers it is impossible to compare with
our results but we find that we share predictive features. They found out that named entity density and
and nouns have predictive power as well.

8 Conclusion and perspectives

In this paper we have presented the first readability assessment system for the Basque language. We
have implemented 94 ratios based on linguistic features similar to those used in other languages and
specially defined for Basque and we have built a classifier which is able to discriminate between difficult
and easy texts. We have also determined which are the most predictive features. From our experiments
we conclude that using only lexical features or a combination of features types we obtain better results
than using all the features. Moreover, we deduce that we do not need to use time consuming resources
like dependency parsing or big corpora to obtain good results.

For the future, we could implement new features like word formation or word ordering both based in
other languages and in neurolinguistic studies that are being carried out for Basque. Other machine learn-
ing techniques can be used, e.g. language models and in the case of getting a bigger corpora or a graded
one, we could even try to differentiate more reading levels. We also envisage readability assessment at
sentence level in near future.
