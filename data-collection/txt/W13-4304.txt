Abstract

The paper discusses HPSG as a framework

for the computational analysis of Man-

darin Chinese. We point out the main char-

acteristics of the framework and show how

they can be exploited to target language-

specific issues, describe existing grammar

engineering work for Chinese and present

our own effort in the implementation of

a grammar for Chinese. The grammar

is illustrated with two fields of phenom-

ena, namely semantic and syntactic mark-

ing and valence alternations. We aim at the

integration of work in theoretical linguis-

tics into computational applications in or-

der to complement statistical methods and

thus increase their accuracy and scalabil-

ity.

1 Introduction

This paper presents a grammar fragment of Chi-

nese which is built in the framework of HPSG

Pollard and Sag (1994) and implemented in the

grammar development system Trale Meurers et al.

(2002a). We consider the use of the framework

from an NLP perspective; at present, large-scale

NLP applications are mostly based on statistical

and machine-learning methods with a minimum

of theoretical linguistic analysis and information.

We believe that the use of a more powerful formal

theory in combination with machine learning and

induction methods will significantly increase the

accuracy of the existing systems and reduce the

gap between theoretical linguistics and NLP.

The advantages of the HPSG framework for the

computational analysis of Chinese are as follows:

*This research is supported by the Deutsche Forschungs-
gemeinschaft under the grant nr. DFG (MU 2822/5-1).

• HPSG provides a range of powerful for-

mal tools for the description of linguistic

expressions which are embedded into the

model-theoretical framework of Typed Fea-

ture Structure Logic Carpenter (1992) and

allow a seamless implementation in logical

programming paradigms.

• HPSG minimizes the use of theory-internal

statements about the empiricial properties of

linguistic signs. Since Chinese is a language

that cannot be straightforwardly explained

using the terminology and assumptions of the

Western linguistic tradition, HPSG thus pro-

vides us with a ‘neutral’ framework for the

formalization of language-specific phenom-

ena based on which more general principles

can be derived.

• In contrast to most formal theories, HPSG

is not a syntax-first framework; the different

levels of linguistic representation – phonol-

ogy, syntax, semantics, pragmatics – have

equal weight. This is especially beneficial

for Chinese, which has a poor morphological

system and exhibits a high degree of surface

ambiguity. The use of a powerful semantic-

pragmatic module with fine-grained defini-

tions of semantic types and selectional re-

strictions and preferences significantly helps

disambiguation.

In the following, we first introduce the basic

feature architecture and principles of the gram-

mar formalism. Then, we review existing work

in HPSG and grammar development for Chinese.

The last part contains a synopsis of the covered

phenomena; the main analytical choices are exem-

plified by treatments of two groups of phenomena,

namely valence and marking.

2 Framework and implementation

This part provides a very brief overview over the

main principles and components of HPSG; for

more detailed expositions, the reader is referred to

the standard makeup described in Pollard and Sag

(1994) as well as Pollard and Sag (1987), Müller

(2008) and Sag et al. (2003). The two main sys-

tems used for grammar engineering with HPSG

are Trale Meurers et al. (2002b); Müller (2007)

and LKB Copestake (2002); the implementation

presented in this paper uses the Trale system. The

semantics follows Minimal Recursion Semantics

as described in Copestake et al. (2005).

The main characteristics of the HPSG frame-

work are as follows:

• Feature-based: the universal format of repre-

sentation are typed feature structures Carpen-

ter (1992).

• Constraint-based: generalizations on linguis-

tic objects are formulated as declarative con-

straints; there are no transformations.

• Lexicalist: a great part of linguistic informa-

tion, especially information about syntactic

combination, is stored in the lexicon.

• Monostratal: multiple levels of linguistic

representation (phonology, syntax and mor-

phology, semantic, pragmatics and informa-

tion structure) are modelled in parallel; no

formal priority is given to the structural level.

Formally, an HPSG grammar consists of three

parts:

• Signature: type hierarchy with feature speci-

fications for the types

• Lexicon (constraints on linguistic signs of

type word):

– Lexical entries

– Lexical rules, specifying systematic re-

lationships holding between classes of

lexical items

• Grammar (constraints on linguistic signs of

type phrase): constraints on linguistic objects

of type phrase

– Small set of broad-range principles

holding of large subtypes of phrase

(Head Feature Principle, Subcategoriza-

tion Principle, Semantics Principle)

– Immediate dominance schemata, speci-

fying the constituency of phrases

– Linear precedence rules, specifying lin-

ear constituent order

A linguistic sign is modelled with feature struc-

tures built according to a standardized architec-

ture. The feature structures are sets of feature-

value pairs; the value of a feature is either atomic

or in itself a feature structure. The signature spec-

ifies the types of values acceptable for a feature.

The following figure shows the basic formal setup

of a linguistic sign:

At the highest level, there is a separation be-

tween the phonological and the syntactic and se-

mantic properties of the sign. This separation is

relevant with respect to syntactic selection: heads

may only specify the SYNSEM properties of the

signs they select. SYNSEM is divided local and

nonlocal properties; NONLOC being reserved for

the modelling of long-distance dependencies, our

following exposition mainly focusses on the LOC

feature. LOC contains syntactic and semantic

properties (CAT(EGORY) and CONT(ENT), respec-

tively); CAT specifies the part-of-speech specific

HEAD features which are propagated by a lexical

head to the mother node. It also contains the va-

lence features SPR and COMPS, which specify the

valents of the sign. The CONT attribute contains an

index variable, which identifies a referential or sit-

uational argument, and a set of relations specify-

ing the semantic contributions of the lexical items

that compose the sign.

3 Previous work

In this section, we give an overview of the

work done so far in HPSG for Chinese. On

the one hand, since the 90’s, several stud-

ies have provided theoretical HPSG analyses of

specific phenomena of Chinese. Formal treat-

ments have been proposed for the NP (Gao,

1993; Xue and McFetridge, 1995; Ng, 1999), se-

rial verb constructions (Lipenkova, 2009; Müller
28



and Lipenkova, 2009) and the well-known bǎ-

construction (Ding, 2000; Lipenkova, 2011). Be-

sides, two dissertations, namely Gang (1997) and

Gao (2000), provide overall sketches of HPSG

grammars for Chinese.

On the other hand, there are two ongoing efforts

in grammar development for Chinese, presented

in Wang et al. (2009); Yu et al. (2010) and Zhang

et al. (2011, 2012). Both are oriented towards a

large-scale data-driven grammar implementation;

they attempt to stay close to the original version of

the framework and minimize the use of language-

specific postulates. Our grammar aims to comple-

ment these efforts and to refine some of the anal-

yses by grounding them on findings from recent

descriptive and theoretical research.

3.1 Joint grammar and treebank

development

Zhang et al. (2011) and Zhang et al. (2012) use

the HPSG framework to combine grammar en-

gineering and treebank compilation. The gram-

mar mainly builds on a part-of-speech hierarchy

and the valence specification. The assumed part-

of-speech hierarchy is similar to the classification

presented in Pollard and Sag (1994). There are

two valence features for the arguments of predi-

cates, namely SUBJ for subjects and COMPS for

complements. Elements on the COMPS feature

have a boolean feature which specifies whether

they appear to the right or to the left of the head.

Besides basic clause structures, the grammar

covers the structure of NPs and locative phrases,

topic constructions, coverbs, resultative verb com-

pounds and simple bǎ- and bèi-constructions.

3.2 HPSG grammar and treebank conversion

In Wang et al. (2009) and Yu et al. (2010), the au-

thors adopt a data-driven approach with the aim

of developing a HPSG parser for Chinese. Start-

ing out with a small set of assumptions about the

grammar (sign structure, grammatical principles

and schemata), they manually convert a Chinese

treebank into an HPSG treebank; the resulting

treebank is used for the extraction of a large-scale

lexicon of Chinese.

The analyses are based on a rather informal

assumption of three levels of sentence structure

which is borrowed from traditional Chinese lin-

guistics, namely the predicative part, the sim-

ple and the complex sentence. The ‘predicative’

part contains a verb with its objects and com-

plements. At the simple sentence level, the au-

thors distinguish between sentences with a sub-

ject and subject-less sentences, which correspond

to a ‘standalone’ predicative part. Complex sen-

tences subsume coordinated sentences, sentences

containing serial verb constructions and topic sen-

tences.

In order to provide a formal representation of

these sentence structures, the authors use nine

phrase structure schemata which determine both

constituency and linear order. There are two

predicate-argument schemata which are used for

the combination of the verb with its arguments.

It is assumed that the subject appears before the

verb (specifier-head schema), whereas the ob-

ject appears after the verb (head-object schema).

Adjunction is also analyzed with two schemata,

namely the modifier-head schema and the head-

modifier schema, which differ only in linear order.

Problemtatically, postverbal elements marked by

得, which have a modifier semantics but syntacti-

cally behave on a par with complements, are also

analyzed via the head-modifier schema; the pro-

posed framework does not provide a schema for

the syntactic analysis of these structures as com-

plements.

Further, a filler-head structure is proposed for

structures with unmarked object preposing. There

are two varieties, namely the pre-object-as-subject

schema, which is used for unmarked passives (2a),

and the pre-object-as-topic schema which is used

for topicalizations (2b):

(2) a. 苹果

Pı́ngguǒ

apple

吃

chı̄

eat

了。

le.

PFV

‘The apple was eaten.’

b. 苹果

Pı́ngguǒ

apple

他

tā

he

吃

chı̄

eat

了。

le.

PFV

‘The apple, he ate it.’

However, in HPSG, the filler-head schema has

been posited for the analysis of nonlocal depen-

dencies (Pollard and Sag, 1994, p. 164). The mo-

tivation behind its use for the analysis of unmarked

passives is unclear.

A general shortcoming of the proposed imple-

mentation is the heavy use of different phrase

structure schemata in order to capture alterna-

tions in valence and linear order. For example, a
29



predicate-argument structure consisting of a verb

and its object can be analyzed via the head-object

schema if it occurs in the canonical VO order, a

specifier-head schema if the object is preposed and

marked by bǎ and a filler-head schema if the ob-

ject is preposed into the sentence-initial position,

giving rise to an unmarked passive. In the original

version of the framework, information about con-

stituency, linear order and valence is cleanly dis-

tributed between immediate dominance schemata,

linear precedence rules and lexicon. The proposed

set of schemata mixes up these different types of

information and thus obscures the original purpose

of immediate dominance schemata; at the same

time, it does not exploit the expressive power of

the lexicon and of linear precedence rules.

4 The coverage of the grammar

Our grammar is contains a syntactic component

which specifies linear order and constituency, a

lexicon with about 900 lexical items and a number

of lexical rules, as well as a set of macros which

are used as ‘abbreviations’ for recurring descrip-

tions of linguistic objects to ease the work of the

grammar writer. The grammar is tested against a

testsuite which currently contains 300 phrasal and

clausal items which represent different constituent

and clause structures of Chinese. At present, we

are testing the grammar against a larger corpus

of empirical examples of the covered phenomena

and extending the lexicon and the grammar as new

items and structures arise. The phenomena that

can be currently analyzed are:

• NP structure:

– Internal structure, combination with de-

terminers, numerals and classifiers

– Prenominal modification: adjectival and

possessive modifiers, relative clauses

with subject, object and adjunct extrac-

tion

• Morphological variation: compounding,

reduplication, affixation

• Basic clause structures and valence alterna-

tions: transitive, intransitive and ditransi-

tive frames; bǎ- and bèi-construction; se-

rial verb constructions; topic structures; un-

marked passives

• Syntactic marking: nominal de-adjunction

(的); verbal de-adjunction (地); de-

complementation (得)

• Mood and aspect marking

• Locative and temporal adjuncts

• Resultative constructions

In the following, we outline our analyses of two

fields of phenomena, namely valence, incl. ar-

gument alternations, and marking. We will see

that different formal means provided by the frame-

work are suitable for different types of phenom-

ena. Thus, valence is mostly treated in the lexicon,

whereas different types of marking are analyzed

via one immediate dominance schema, namely the

head-marker schema.

5 Example analyses

5.1 Valence alternations and argument

realization: a lexicalist analysis

The coverage of the valence ‘module’ is as fol-

lows:

• Unmarked verbal frames in active voice (in-

transitive, transitive, ditransitive), including

differentiation between syntactically obliga-

tory and optional internal arguments; these

frames are entirely specified in the lexical hi-

erarchy. Using multiple inheritance, verbs

with optional internal arguments can inherit

from multiple frames.

• Alternations in argument realization (dative

alternation, object preposing with and with-

out subject omission) are captured by lexical

rules which act on the valence features of the

item. The lexical argument structure is not

changed and thus remains accessible to se-

mantic mechanisms such as binding.

• bǎ- and bèi-constructions: we do not adopt

the marker analysis of bǎ and bèi which

is mostly adopted in formal studies. As

shown in Sybesma (1999), Bender (2000)

and Lipenkova (2011), i. a., the role of these

morphemes in sentence formation is more

prominent than the role of a normal marker:

they can be used with a range of different ar-

gument distributions, may select their own

arguments and impose semantic constraints
30



on the predicate and its complement which

would be difficult to capture in a marker anal-

ysis. In our implementation, bǎ and bèi are

analyzed as clausal heads.

In the feature architecture, valence is captured

by three list-valued features which contain the va-

lents in order of decreasing obliqueness. All signs

have the two valence features SPR (external argu-

ment) and COMPS (internal arguments):

(3)





CAT

[

SPR list

]





These features contain lists of the elements that

the sign must combine with in order to grow into

a saturated well-formed phrase. The features are

dynamic: the Subcategorization Principle (Pollard

and Sag, 1994, p. 35) ensures that elements that

have already been realized are deleted from the va-

lence lists at the next higher node.

Lexical items have the additional feature ARG-

ST. Its value is a fixed list that specifies the depen-

dents lexically selected by the word. In the ‘basic’

makeup of a lexical item that has not undergone a

lexical rule, ARG-ST is the concatenation of SPR

and COMPS:











Thus, to summarize, ARG-ST tells us which

dependents are to be realized, whereas SPR and

COMPS determine how they are realized.

Marked valence patterns, such as valence al-

ternations and the bǎ- and bèi-constructions, re-

quire additional machinery. Valence alternations

which do not come with additional lexical mate-

rial to which we could tie structural information

are analyzed with lexical rules. The formal prop-

erties of lexical rules are described in Flickinger

(1987), Briscoe and Copestake (1999), Meurers

(2000), Meurers (2001) and Müller (2006), inter

alia. We use lexical rules for valence reduction (e.

g. unmarked passives), valence augmentation (e.

g. resultative complements) and valence alterna-

tion (e. g. dative shift). The following illustrates

a simple lexical rule for the use of transitive verbs

in the unmarked passive:

(5) Reduced valence in unmarked passive:

Note that the output of the lexical rule only specifies fea-
tures whose value is changed by the rule.

‘The apple was eaten.’

We see that the output of the lexical entry ac-

commodates the original complement in the spec-

ifier position; the original specifier no longer ap-

pears on the valence lists and thus cannot be real-

ized.

Besides valence alternations which are not

marked by specific morphology, Chinese has two

argument structure constructions with additional

lexical material, namely the bèi- and the bǎ-

construction. In these constructions, the mor-

phemes bǎ and bèi determine the argument struc-

ture of the clause. bǎ preposes an argument of the

verb which appears postverbally in the canonical

SVO order (6a). Bèi either appears alone or marks

the external argument of the verb; in any case, bèi

promotes its internal argument into the subject po-

sition (6b):

(6) a. 他

Tā

bèi

BEI

(他)

(tā)

he

吃

chı̄

eat

了。

le.

PFV

‘The apple was eaten (by him).’

These constructions are only used with transi-

tive and ditransitive predicates that describe events

loosely associated with the semantic concept of

‘affectedness’.

Whereas the structual scope of a normal marker

is limited to the element it marks, the use of bǎ

or bèi impacts on the overall formation and well-

formedness constraints on a sentence. In order

to accommodate this information, we analyze bǎ

and bèi as heads which select for an almost sat-

urated verbal complement and ‘attract’ the yet

unrealized argument of that complement in or-

der to realize it in the sentence-initial position.

Thus, bǎ canonically attracts the external argu-

ment, whereas bèi attracts the internal argument.

In the canonical case, bǎ does not make a se-

mantic contribution; thus, it inherits the content of

the verbal complement in order to ensure correct

semantic composition at the mother node of the

sentence.

Fig. 1 illustrates the syntactic combination for

(6a).

5.2 Use of the head-marker structure for

different types of marking

As we have said, Chinese has a poor morphology.

The lack of expressive force on the morphological

level is partially compensated by a rich class of

markers. In the following, we distinguish between

two kinds of marking; on the one hand, semantic

markers mark the aspect of a VP (perfective了 le,

durative 着 zhe, experiential 过 guo) or the mode

of a sentence (interrogative 吗 ma, imperative 吧

ba, change-of-state了 le). On the other hand, syn-

tactic markers make constituents eligible for spe-

cific syntactic positions without altering their se-

mantics (three de’s: 得，的，地).

Structures with markers are analyzed via the

head-marker schema:

]

As part of the HEAD feature, which contains

properties specific to a particular part of speech,

the marker has a feature SPEC(IFIED) which con-

strains the marked constituent. Additionally, the

feature MARKING ensures that the marker is vis-

ible at the top node. This feature takes the value

unmarked for lexical items that are not markers;

for markers, it takes a subtype of marked, which

subsumes individual values contributed by specific

markers.

bǎ also allows for other argument distributions in which
it indeed may contribute additional relations and event argu-
ments; cf. ? and Sybesma (1999), inter alia.

5.2.1 Semantic marking

Chinese has three postverbal aspect markers, as il-

lustrated in the following example:

(9) 他

Tā

he

看

kàn

read

了

le

PFV

/

/

/

着

zhe

PROG

/

/

/

过

guo

EXP

书。

shū.

book

‘He read / is reading / once read the book.’

These markers mark the perfective, durative and

experiential aspect, respectively. They markers

naturally differ in the range of semantic classes

of verbs with which they combine; however, the

syntactic distribution of aspect markers is identi-

cal: they immediately follow the verb. The fol-

lowing AVM shows the supertype constraint for

aspect markers:

With this supertype in place, the entries for the

individual markers only specify information about

the semantic relation contributed by the marker.

of the verb with the aspect marker:

5.2.2 Syntactic marking

In this section, we consider the syntactic markers

的 de, 得 de and 地 de. These markers do not

carry semantic content; they are used to make con-

stituents eligible for specific syntactic positions.

The following examples illustrate:

(13) a. 很

hěn

very

快

kuài

fast

的

de

MK.DE1

car

‘a very fast car’

b. 他

Tā

he

pǎo

rung

得

MK.DE3

很

hěn

very

快。

kuài.

fast

‘He runs very quickly.’

DE1 is used for marking prenominal modifiers

(APs, relative clauses, possessives and other NP

modifiers). DE2 is used to mark postverbal com-

plements that denote the manner, degree of inten-

sity or result of an action. DE3 is used for the

marking of preverbal manner adjuncts.

There appears to be a semantic overlap between postver-
bal manner complements with DE2 and preverbal adjuncts
with DE3. The structures are mainly distinguished in terms
of syntactic status of the manner constituent (complement for
DE, adjunct for DE) and information structure. Thus, un-

The constraint on the lexical entry of a syntactic

marker is as follows:

We can see that the marker does not make a se-

mantic contribution. The marking type syn has

three subtypes which correspond to the three de’s.

Now, in order to account for the syntactic combi-

nation, we posit relational constraints on the re-

sulting head-marker structures. These constraints

relate the marker with the type of constituent that

selects or is modified by the head-marker struc-

ture:

(15) a.

[

head-marker-structure

HEAD | MOD N
MARKED de1

]

b.

[

head-marker-structure

HEAD | MOD V
MARKED de2

]

De3-complements are selected by the verb; the

Thus, we provide a unified analysis of the

three markers which builds on the head-marker

schema and the MARKING feature. MARKING de-

termines syntactic combination: modifiers relate

the MARKING feature to the syntactic type of the

der the assumption that the sentence-final position accom-
modates the focus, the speaker has the choice between two
structures that focus either the action or the manner in which
it is conducted.

6 Conclusion

In this paper, we have presented a HPSG imple-

mentation of a Chinese grammar fragment; the

framework HPSG is well-suited for the analy-

sis of Chinese since it makes a minimal num-

ber of empirical assumptions about linguistic ob-

jects while providing the grammar writer with

a model-theoretically grounded set of descriptive

tools. Since the empirical notions and assumptions

used in Western linguistics cannot be readily trans-

ferred to Chinese, HPSG thus gives us the possi-

bility to formulate theory-neutral analyses which

can then be used to derive broader generalizations

about the language. In the present paper, we have

focussed on two sets of phenomena, marking and

valence alternation, and shown how they can be

analyzed in a unified manner using the mecha-

nisms provided by the framework.
