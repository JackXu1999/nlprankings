Invited Speaker Abstract

Early computational linguists supplied much of theoretical basis that the ALPAC report said was needed
for research on the practical problem of machine translation. The result of their efforts turned out to be
more fundamental in that it provided a general theoretical basis for the study of language use as a process,
giving rise eventually to constraint-based grammatical formalisms for syntax, finite-state approaches to
morphology and phonology, and a host of models how speakers might assemble sentences, and hearers
take them apart. Recently, an entirely new enterprise, based on machine learning and big data, has sprung
on the scene and challenged the ALPAC committee’s finding that linguistic processing must have a firm
basis in linguistic theory. In this talk, I will show that the long-term development of linguistic processing
requires linguistic theory, sophisticated statistical manipulation of big data, and a third component which
is not linguistic at all.
