Abstract 

[We report of the procedures of developing a large representative corpus of 50,000 sentences 
taken from clinical notes. Previous reports of annotated corpus of clinical notes have been 
small and they do not represent the whole domain of clinical notes. The sentences included in 
this corpus have been selected from a very large raw corpus of ten thousand documents. These 
ten thousand documents are sampled from an internal repository of more than 700,000 docu-
ments taken from multiple health care providers. Each of the documents is de-identified to re-
move any PHI data. Using the Penn Treebank tagging guidelines with a bit of modifications, 
we annotate this corpus manually with an average inter-annotator agreement of more than 
98%. The goal is to create a parts of speech annotated corpus in the clinical domain that is 
comparable to the Penn Treebank and also represents the totality of the contemporary text as 
used in the clinical domain. We also report the output of the TnT tagger trained on the initial 
21,000 annotated sentences reaching a preliminary accuracy of above 96%.] 

1 Introduction 
Automated parts of speech (PoS) annotation have been an active field of research for more than 40 
years now. Obviously, there are quite a few of tools already available with an impressive accuracy re-
turns (Toutanova et al, 2003; Shen et al. , 2007; Spoustov´a et al., 2009; Søgaard, 2010). This is true in 
the general domain text such as news reports or general domain articles. But when it comes to a niche 
area like clinical domain, no automated parts of speech taggers are readily available nor has there been 
any report of any such large corpus developed that meet the standards as set out in the general domain.  
Interest has grown now as NLP is sought after in the clinical domain, particularly for the task of in-
formation extraction from clinical notes. 

There have been previous attempts for creating PoS annotated corpus in the clinical domain (Tateisi 
et al., 2004; Pakhomov et al, 2006; Albright et al., 2013). All of these corpora are relatively small and 
the PoS taggers trained on them have not been shown to reach above 96% in the clinical domain. At-
tempts at adapting a general domain PoS tagger to work better for clinical domain include Easy Adapt 
(Daumé H., 2007) and ClinAdapt (Ferraro et al., 2013). But none of these two adaptation methods en-
hance the accuracy levels to more than 95%. 

Given that the text in clinical notes is radically different from what appears in the general domain, 
the general domain English PoS tagger models do not perform well on the clinical text. Our experi-
ments with three such general domain taggers, namely Charniak (Charniak and Johnson, 2005), Stan-
ford (Klein and Manning, 2003) and OpenNLP, yielded not more than 95% accuracy. This motivated 
us to take a radical step of developing a fresh parts of speech annotated corpus comparable to the Penn 
Treebank. Well, we are aware that it is going to take a lot of money, time and effort. But we also be-
lieve that it is necessary if we need better NLP tools for this domain. 

2 The Representative Corpus  
To ensure that we have a representative corpus, we sampled a corpus of more than 750,000 documents 
from 119 providers (hospitals and specialty clinics). The biggest challenge was to take a representative 
sample of documents from various specialties and different work types. Thanks to the metadata infor-
mation available in our internal repository, this was solved in a rather easier way although we did need 
to look for information on classification and sub-classification of the domain manually.

2.1 Sampling Task 
Out of these 750,000 documents, we selected only ten hospitals for document sampling as they were 
large providers with a greater number of note count and provided a diversity of the specialty doc-
tors/providers dictating the clinical notes.  These ten hospitals amounted to a total of 237,110 docu-
ments written by 508 doctors of roughly 97 clinical specialties. A summary of this is given in Appen-
dix A. 

2.2 Sentence Clustering 
We have used 237,110 documents for the process of selecting the sample sentences undergoing the 
PoS annotation. All of these documents were classified into different categories based on their work 
types (operative notes, admission notes, discharge summaries etc.), service line (cardiology, oncology, 
medicine, ambulatory etc.), section headers (History of Present Illness, Chief Complaints, Physical 
Examination, Laboratory Data etc.). Based on this classification, we have selected a sample of 10,000 
documents fairly representing the 237,110 documents selected in the first phase. 

These 10,000 documents were parsed using the Charniak’s full syntactic parser (Charniak & John-
son, 2005). After some modifications, the Charniak parser on clinical data gives an accuracy of about 
95% at the PoS level. A graph based string similarity algorithm was used to find similar sentences 
from these 10,000 documents. A summary of what it yielded is as follows: 

Total Number of Sentences: 704,271 
Total Number of Unique Sentences:  365,518 
Total Number of Unique Patterns:  234,909 

The unique patterns were clustered together using a hierarchical clustering algorithm. Patterns were 
grouped together by calculating the Euclidean distance with a threshold similarity of 80 or more. Fol-
lowing this method, we got a total of 3,768 patterns that represented all of the unique patterns. We call 
them pattern heads. 

By giving a proportional weightage to each of these pattern heads as per their occurrence in the 
unique patterns, we derived a total of 56,632 sentences. While no two sentences selected are same, 
about 41% of the patterns in the sample corpus have a frequency of more than 1. 

Appendix B shows example pairs of sentences having the same tag pattern and Appendix C shows 
example pairs of sentences having similar pattern. 

The final selected candidate sentences also contained quite a  few junk sentences (which came of 
course from the clinical notes themselves) or some very frequent smaller patterns (e.g. date patterns), 
we manually removed them to get a total of 49,278 sentences with a total word count of 491,690 and 
an average per sentence word count of 9.97. The greatest number of token for a sentence was found to 
be 221 in the sampled corpus (while the same in the original, actual corpus is 395). 

3 Annotation Method 
As against the common practice of semi-automatic method of annotating text, we purposely chose to 
annotate the text from scratch. It has been reported that tools do affect the decisions of the annotators 
(Marcus et al., 1993). We asked the annotators to use simple notepad and for each of the tokens they 
had to key in the appropriate PoS label. Tokenization and sentence boundary detection were automati-
cally done before it went to the annotators. 

As against the common practice of engaging annotators with a medical background and training 
them into linguistic annotation (Pakhomov et al., 2006; Fan et al. , 2011), we purposely chose to en-
gage linguists and train them into medical language. The annotators were all graduate level researchers 
in linguistics and had a deep knowledge of theoretical syntax. As next step in linguistics analysis after 
PoS tagging is syntactic parsing or chunking, the linguists were also motivated to learn about the goals 
of this task i.e. we informed them about our interests in developing a chunker and a parser afterwards. 
This information helps the annotators to think in terms of making syntactic tree while assigning a PoS 
tag. For example, there is always confusion among the tag pairs IN/RP, VBN/JJ and so on. But if one 
can try drawing a syntactic tree, the confusion gets cleared. While training annotators with medical 
background in linguistics for the task of PoS tagging may seem rather easy, the same cannot be said 
for syntactic tree formation. Besides, the linguists always had the choice of consulting medical experts 

88



(medical coders, medical transcriptionists with more than 5 years of experience) in case any phrase 
had to be explained in terms of its meaning. 

Training sessions were held for linguists for first 15 days during which differences were brought to 
fore and a consensus was reached. This period was strictly for training purposes and text annotated 
during this period was validated more than thrice before getting included in the final corpus. After this 
training period, an inter-annotator agreement round was run with 10,000 sentences distributed to four 
annotators in turn. Each file was annotated by at least two annotators. The differences were then com-
pared and arbitrated by a third annotator who discussed the conflicting cases with the initial annotators 
and brought a consensus among them. 

Inter-annotator agreement at the start of this phase was 93% to 95%. This after a month increased to 
a consistent 97% to 100%. We are at the end of this phase and the accuracy is consistently close to 
99%. Also of note is the fact that apart from the initial 5 days of face-to-face training session, the an-
notators never sit together and they work remotely from the convenience of their location and have a 
flexible time. We also ensured that they do not work long hours at a stretch doing this job as we know 
that this is a tedious job and cannot be done in a hurry. For a full-time annotator, the target goal was 
annotation of 1600 word per day (8 hours) and for the part-time annotators, it was half of that. They 
were always encouraged to come up with any issues for a weekly discussion on the conflicting or con-
fusing cases. 

For the later phases of annotation process, it is ensured that each annotation is validated by at least 
one other annotator. If disagreements arise, arbitration is done by involving a third annotator following 
a discussion. 

As the text might contain tokenization errors, sentence boundary detection errors and other gram-
matical or typographical mistakes, the annotators are asked to document them in a separate spread-
sheet. The sentences themselves are sacrosanct to the annotators and they can at the most make 
changes in separating the hyphenated words if they are not properly hyphenated by the tokenizer and 
document this change. 

4 Annotation Guideline 
Barring a couple of new tags, the annotation guideline largely follows the Penn Treebank PoS annota-
tion guidelines (Santorini, B., 1990) and takes inputs from various other guidelines such as the Penn 
Treebank II parsing guidelines (Bies et al., 1995) and MiPACQ guidelines (Warner et al., 2012). A 
new tag that we have added on top of the Penn tagset looks for marking a difference between the ex-
pletive “it” and the pronominal “it” as it helps in tasks like anaphora resolution. The new tag for the 
expletive use of ‘it’ is given as “EXP”. The tagset contains a total of 41 tags. The other four tags are 
HYPH, AFX, GW and XX. These tags are well described in the MiPACQ guideline. 

As we have also seen the PoS labels given to the Penn Treebank data, we find that we are differing 
in assigning the tag to some of the words. For example, for the temporal expressions like “today”, 
“yesterday” and “tomorrow”, the tag in Penn corpus is invariably NN while we make a difference in 
their adverbial use and nominal use and assign the tag accordingly as “RB” or “NN”. 

5 Initial Training Results 
After 4 months of annotation, we achieved a total of 21 thousand sentences annotated. For an experi-
mental run, we trained a tagger to test how far we can go with this data. We implemented a modified 
version of the TnT (Trigram and Tag) (Brants, 2000) algorithm to train a PoS tagger. This tagger was 
given an input of 17,586 sentences containing a total of 158,330 words and was tested against 3,924 
sentences containing a total of 38,143 words. 

Without giving any extra features apart from the ones mentioned in Brants, we got a total of 2,621 
sentences and 36,234 words annotated correctly. That is the TnT out-of-the-box accuracy was 95.00% 
as against the Charniak out-of-the-box accuracy of 91.36%. 

We also compared the same test data against the Charniak parser (without the resource of tag dic-
tionary and the rules). We find that the current tagger was actually performing better. Results im-
proved by 0.33% if we modified the algorithm to handle unknown words using suffixes from the 
medical domain. These suffixes were collected specifically from the medical domain and were such 
for which a single tag could be given. 

89



We also experimented with another method for improvements. This included using a dictionary of 
unambiguous words (words having single tags invariably, for adjectives and verbs only) and resetting 
the emission probability to 1 for them. These two improvement techniques combined enhanced the 
results by 1.24% to push the accuracy to 96.24%. 

Given that a fraction of our corpus is giving us 95% accuracy which is at par with or better than re-
ported anywhere else for PoS tagging task in the domain of clinical NLP, we believe that the results 
should only improve once we increase the training data and apply the improvement techniques avail-
able in the book. 

6 Conclusion 
There is a paucity of good and large enough annotated corpus in the domain of clinical NLP. The ex-
isting corpora are small although extensive analysis has been done on them. Our effort through this 
project is to fill the gap of having a large corpus comparable to the Penn Treebank. 

In this paper we described an ongoing effort to create a sample corpus of clinical notes across most 
of the sub-domains and including all the different types of linguistic styles in this domain. We have 
also used a novel method for creation of a representative corpus which can be said to represent the 
whole of the clinical text in current practice across providers within United States. 

As compared to semi-automated methods of annotation practiced even in big corpus like the Penn 
Treebank, we are following a fully manual process of annotation where the annotators are only given 
contextual information and no other help or props are provided apart from the guidelines to fasten the 
annotation process. We obtain an inter-annotator agreement of 98.93 and we believe that this is the 
best approach to go for this task. 

Using the basic TnT algorithm we also train a tagger using 30% of our data (17,500 sentences) an-
notated in the initial 3 months of the project and achieve a baseline accuracy of 95%. We expect that 
our accuracy should improve to more than 98% once we train the same algorithm on all the 50,000 
annotated sentences. 

After the completion of the project, we may release this corpus for research use.
