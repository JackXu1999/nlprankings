Abstract

Image description is a new natural lan-
guage generation task, where the aim is to
generate a human-like description of an im-
age. The evaluation of computer-generated
text is a notoriously difficult problem, how-
ever, the quality of image descriptions has
typically been measured using unigram
BLEU and human judgements. The focus
of this paper is to determine the correlation
of automatic measures with human judge-
ments for this task. We estimate the correla-
tion of unigram and Smoothed BLEU, TER,
ROUGE-SU4, and Meteor against human
judgements on two data sets. The main
finding is that unigram BLEU has a weak
correlation, and Meteor has the strongest
correlation with human judgements.

1 Introduction

Recent advances in computer vision and natural
language processing have led to an upsurge of re-
search on tasks involving both vision and language.
State of the art visual detectors have made it possi-
ble to hypothesise what is in an image (Guillaumin
et al., 2009; Felzenszwalb et al., 2010), paving
the way for automatic image description systems.
The aim of such systems is to extract and reason
about visual aspects of images to generate a human-
like description. An example of the type of image
and gold-standard descriptions available can be
seen in Figure 1. Recent approaches to this task
have been based on slot-filling (Yang et al., 2011;
Elliott and Keller, 2013), combining web-scale n-
grams (Li et al., 2011), syntactic tree substitution
(Mitchell et al., 2012), and description-by-retrieval
(Farhadi et al., 2010; Ordonez et al., 2011; Hodosh
et al., 2013). Image description has been compared
to translating an image into text (Li et al., 2011;
Kulkarni et al., 2011) or summarising an image

1. An older woman with a small dog in the snow.

2. A woman and a cat are outside in the snow.

3. A woman in a brown vest is walking on the
snow with an animal.

4. A woman with a red scarf covering her head
walks with her cat on snow-covered ground.

5. Heavy set woman in snow with a cat.

Figure 1: An image from the Flickr8K data set and
five human-written descriptions. These descrip-
tions vary in the adjectives or prepositional phrases
that describe the woman (1, 3, 4, 5), incorrect or un-
certain identification of the cat (1, 3), and include
a sentence without a verb (5).

(Yang et al., 2011), resulting in the adoption of the
evaluation measures from those communities.

In this paper we estimate the correlation of hu-
man judgements with five automatic evaluation
measures on two image description data sets. Our
work extends previous studies of evaluation mea-
sures for image description (Hodosh et al., 2013),
which focused on unigram-based measures and re-
ported agreement scores such as Cohen’s κ rather
than correlations. The main finding of our analysis
is that TER and unigram BLEU are weakly corre-

452



lated against human judgements, ROUGE-SU4 and
Smoothed BLEU are moderately correlated, and the
strongest correlation is found with Meteor.

2 Methodology

We estimate Spearman’s ρ for five different auto-
matic evaluation measures against human judge-
ments for the automatic image description task.
Spearman’s ρ is a non-parametric correlation co-
efficient that restricts the ability of outlier data
points to skew the co-efficient value. The automatic
measures are calculated on the sentence level and
correlated against human judgements of semantic
correctness.

2.1 Data

We perform the correlation analysis on the Flickr8K
data set of Hodosh et al. (2013), and the data set of
Elliott and Keller (2013).

The test data of the Flickr8K data set contains
1,000 images paired with five reference descrip-
tions. The images were retrieved from Flickr, the
reference descriptions were collected from Me-
chanical Turk, and the human judgements were
collected from expert annotators as follows: each
image in the test data was paired with the highest
scoring sentence(s) retrieved from all possible test
sentences by the TRI5SEM model in Hodosh et al.
(2013). Each image–description pairing in the test
data was judged for semantic correctness by three
expert human judges on a scale of 1–4. We calcu-
late automatic measures for each image–retrieved
sentence pair against the five reference descriptions
for the original image.

The test data of Elliott and Keller (2013) con-
tains 101 images paired with three reference de-
scriptions. The images were taken from the PAS-
CAL VOC Action Recognition Task, the reference
descriptions were collected from Mechanical Turk,
and the judgements were also collected from Me-
chanical Turk. Elliott and Keller (2013) gener-
ated two-sentence descriptions for each of the test
images using four variants of a slot-filling model,
and collected five human judgements of the se-
mantic correctness and grammatical correctness of
the description on a scale of 1–5 for each image–
description pair, resulting in a total of 2,042 human
judgement–description pairings. In this analysis,
we use only the first sentence of the description,
which describes the event depicted in the image.

2.2 Automatic Evaluation Measures

BLEU measures the effective overlap between a
reference sentence X and a candidate sentence Y .
It is defined as the geometric mean of the effective
n-gram precision scores, multiplied by the brevity
penalty factor BP to penalise short translations. pn
measures the effective overlap by calculating the
proportion of the maximum number of n-grams
co-occurring between a candidate and a reference
and the total number of n-grams in the candidate
text. More formally,

BLEU = BP · exp
(

N

n=1

)

pn =

∑

count(ngram)

BP =
{

1 if c > r
e(1−r/c) if c≤ r

Unigram BLEU without a brevity penalty has been
reported by Kulkarni et al. (2011), Li et al. (2011),
Ordonez et al. (2011), and Kuznetsova et al. (2012);
to the best of our knowledge, the only image de-
scription work to use higher-order n-grams with
BLEU is Elliott and Keller (2013). In this paper we
use the smoothed BLEU implementation of Clark et
al. (2011) to perform a sentence-level analysis, set-
ting n = 1 and no brevity penalty to get the unigram
BLEU measure, or n = 4 with the brevity penalty
to get the Smoothed BLEU measure. We note that a
higher BLEU score is better.

ROUGE measures the longest common subse-
quence of tokens between a candidate Y and refer-
ence X . There is also a variant that measures the co-
occurrence of pairs of tokens in both the candidate
and reference (a skip-bigram): ROUGE-SU*. The
skip-bigram calculation is parameterised with dskip,
the maximum number of tokens between the words
in the skip-bigram. Setting dskip to 0 is equivalent to
bigram overlap and setting dskip to ∞ means tokens
can be any distance apart. If α = |SKIP2(X ,Y )|
is the number of matching skip-bigrams between
the reference and the candidate, then skip-bigram
ROUGE is formally defined as:

RSKIP2 = α /
(

α
2

)

453



ROUGE has been used by only Yang et al. (2011)
to measure the quality of generated descriptions,
using a variant they describe as ROUGE-1. We set
dskip = 4 and award partial credit for unigram only
matches, otherwise known as ROUGE-SU4. We use
ROUGE v.1.5.5 for the analysis, and configure the
evaluation script to return the result for the average
score for matching between the candidate and the
references. A higher ROUGE score is better.

TER measures the number of modifications a hu-
man would need to make to transform a candidate
Y into a reference X . The modifications available
are insertion, deletion, substitute a single word, and
shift a word an arbitrary distance. TER is expressed
as the percentage of the sentence that needs to be
changed, and can be greater than 100 if the candi-
date is longer than the reference. More formally,

TER =
|edits|

|reference tokens|
TER has not yet been used to evaluate image de-
scription models. We use v.0.8.0 of the TER evalu-
ation tool, and a lower TER is better.

Meteor is the harmonic mean of unigram preci-
sion and recall that allows for exact, synonym, and
paraphrase matchings between candidates and ref-
erences. It is calculated by generating an alignment
between the tokens in the candidate and reference
sentences, with the aim of a 1:1 alignment between
tokens and minimising the number of chunks ch
of contiguous and identically ordered tokens in the
sentence pair. The alignment is based on exact to-
ken matching, followed by Wordnet synonyms, and
then stemmed tokens. We can calculate precision,
recall, and F-measure, where m is the number of
aligned unigrams between candidate and reference.
Meteor is defined as:

M = (1−Pen) ·Fmean

Pen = γ
(

ch
m

)θ
Fmean =

PR
αP+(1−α)R

P =
|m|

|unigrams in candidate|
R =

|unigrams in reference|

We calculated the Meteor scores using release 1.4.0
with the package-provided free parameter settings
of 0.85, 0.2, 0.6, and 0.75 for the matching compo-
nents. Meteor has not yet been reported to evaluate

the performance of different models on the image
description task; a higher Meteor score is better.

2.3 Protocol
We performed the correlation analysis as follows.
The sentence-level evaluation measures were cal-
culated for each image–description–reference tu-
ple. We collected the BLEU, TER, and Meteor
scores using MultEval (Clark et al., 2011), and the
ROUGE-SU4 scores using the RELEASE-1.5.5.pl
script. The evaluation measure scores were then
compared with the human judgements using Spear-
man’s correlation estimated at the sentence-level.

3 Results

Table 1 shows the correlation co-efficients between
automatic measures and human judgements and
Figures 2(a) and (b) show the distribution of scores
for each measure against human judgements. To
classify the strength of the correlations, we fol-
lowed the guidance of Dancey and Reidy (2011),
who posit that a co-efficient of 0.0–0.1 is uncor-
related, 0.11–0.4 is weak, 0.41–0.7 is moderate,
0.71–0.90 is strong, and 0.91–1.0 is perfect.

On the Flickr8k data set, all evaluation measures
can be classified as either weakly correlated or mod-
erately correlated with human judgements and all
results are significant. TER is only weakly cor-
related with human judgements but could prove
useful in comparing the types of differences be-
tween models. An analysis of the distribution of
TER scores in Figure 2(a) shows that differences in
candidate and reference length are prevalent in the
image description task. Unigram BLEU is also only
weakly correlated against human judgements, even
though it has been reported extensively for this task.

Figure 2: Distribution of automatic evaluation measures against human judgements. ρ is the correlation
between human judgements and the automatic measure. The intensity of each point indicates the number
of occurrences that fall into that range.

Figure 2(a) shows an almost uniform distribution
of unigram BLEU scores, regardless of the human
judgement. Smoothed BLEU and ROUGE-SU4 are
moderately correlated with human judgements, and
the correlation is stronger than with unigram BLEU.
Finally, Meteor is most strongly correlated mea-
sure against human judgements. A similar pattern
is observed in the Elliott and Keller (2013) data set,
though the correlations are lower across all mea-
sures. This could be caused by the smaller sample
size or because the descriptions were generated
by a computer, and not retrieved from a collection
of human-written descriptions containing the gold-
standard text, as in the Flickr8K data set.

Qualitative Analysis

Figure 3 shows two images from the test collec-
tion of the Flickr8K data set with a low Meteor
score and a maximum human judgement of seman-
tic correctness. The main difference between the
candidates and references are in deciding what to
describe (content selection), and how to describe it
(realisation). We can hypothesise that in both trans-
lation and summarisation, the source text acts as a
lexical and semantic framework within which the
translation or summarisation process takes place.
In Figure 3(a), the authors of the descriptions made
different decisions on what to describe. A decision

has been made to describe the role of the officials in
the candidate text, and not in the reference text. The
underlying cause of this is an active area of research
in the human vision literature and can be attributed
to bottom-up effects, such as saliency (Itti et al.,
1998), top-down contextual effects (Torralba et al.,
2006), or rapidly-obtained scene properties (Oliva
and Torralba, 2001). In (b), we can see the problem
of deciding how to describe the selected content.
The reference uses a more specific noun to describe
the person on the bicycle than the candidate.

4 Discussion

There are several differences between our analysis
and that of Hodosh et al. (2013). First, we report
Spearman’s ρ correlation coefficient of automatic
measures against human judgements, whereas they
report agreement between judgements and auto-
matic measures in terms of Cohen’s κ. The use of
κ requires the transformation of real-valued scores
into categorical values, and thus loses informa-
tion; we use the judgement and evaluation measure
scores in their original forms. Second, our use of
Spearman’s ρ means we can readily use all of the
available data for the correlation analysis, whereas
Hodosh et al. (2013) report agreement on thresh-
olded subsets of the data. Third, we report the corre-
lation coefficients against five evaluation measures,

test something to collaborating officials.

is holding both hands up.

bicycle.

Figure 3: Examples in the test data with low Meteor scores and the maximum expert human judgement.

some of which go beyond unigram matchings be-
tween references and candidates, whereas they only
report unigram BLEU and unigram ROUGE. It is
therefore difficult to directly compare the results
of our correlation analysis against Hodosh et al.’s
agreement analysis, but they also reach the conclu-
sion that unigram BLEU is not an appropriate mea-
sure of image description performance. However,
we do find stronger correlations with Smoothed
BLEU, skip-bigram ROUGE, and Meteor.

In contrast to the results presented here, Reiter
and Belz (2009) found no significant correlations
of automatic evaluation measures against human
judgements of the accuracy of machine-generated
weather forecasts. They did, however, find signif-
icant correlations of automatic measures against
fluency judgements. There are no fluency judge-
ments available for Flickr8K, but Elliott and Keller
(2013) report grammaticality judgements for their
data, which are comparable to fluency ratings. We
failed to find significant correlations between gram-
matlicality judgements and any of the automatic
measures on the Elliott and Keller (2013) data. This
discrepancy could be explained in terms of the dif-
ferences between the weather forecast generation
and image description tasks, or because the image
description data sets contain thousands of texts and
a few human judgements per text, whereas the data
sets of Reiter and Belz (2009) included hundreds
of texts with 30 human judges.

5 Conclusions

In this paper we performed a sentence-level corre-
lation analysis of automatic evaluation measures
against expert human judgements for the automatic
image description task. We found that sentence-
level unigram BLEU is only weakly correlated with
human judgements, even though it has extensively
reported in the literature for this task. Meteor was
found to have the highest correlation with human
judgements, but it requires Wordnet and paraphrase
resources that are not available for all languages.
Our findings held when judgements were made on
human-written or computer-generated descriptions.

The variability in what and how people describe
images will cause problems for all of the measures
compared in this paper. Nevertheless, we propose
that unigram BLEU should no longer be used as
an objective function for automatic image descrip-
tion because it has a weak correlation with human
accuracy judgements. We recommend adopting
either Meteor, Smoothed BLEU, or ROUGE-SU4 be-
cause they show stronger correlations with human
judgements. We believe these suggestions are also
applicable to the ranking tasks proposed in Hodosh
et al. (2013), where automatic evaluation scores
could act as features to a ranking function.
