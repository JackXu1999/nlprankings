Abstract

This paper presents the results of the
WMT15 Metrics Shared Task. We asked
participants of this task to score the out-
puts of the MT systems involved in the
WMT15 Shared Translation Task. We col-
lected scores of 46 metrics from 11 re-
search groups. In addition to that, we
computed scores of 7 standard metrics
(BLEU, SentBLEU, NIST, WER, PER,
TER and CDER) as baselines. The col-
lected scores were evaluated in terms of
system level correlation (how well each
metric’s scores correlate with WMT15 of-
ficial manual ranking of systems) and in
terms of segment level correlation (how
often a metric agrees with humans in com-
paring two translations of a particular sen-
tence).

1 Introduction

Automatic machine translation metrics play a very
important role in the development of MT systems
and their evaluation. There are many different
metrics of diverse nature and one would like to
assess their quality. For this reason, the Met-
rics Shared Task is held annually at the Work-
shop of Statistical Machine Translation1, starting
with Koehn and Monz (2006) and following up to
Macháček and Bojar (2014).

The systems’ outputs, human judgements and
evaluated metrics are described in Section 2. The
quality of the metrics in terms of system level cor-
relation is reported in Section 3. Section 4 is de-
voted to segment level correlation.

2 Data

We used the translations of MT systems involved
in WMT15 Shared Translation Task (Bojar et al.,

1http://www.statmt.org/wmt15

2015) together with reference translations as the
test set for the Metrics Task. This dataset con-
sists of 87 systems’ outputs and 10 reference trans-
lations in 10 translation directions (English from
and into Czech, Finnish, French, German and Rus-
sian). The number of sentences in system and ref-
erence translations varies among language pairs
ranging from 1370 for Finnish-English to 2818 for
Russian-English. For more details, please see the
WMT15 overview paper (Bojar et al., 2015).

2.1 Manual MT Quality Judgements

During the WMT15 Translation Task, a large scale
manual annotation was conducted to compare the
translation quality of participating systems. We
used these collected human judgements for the
evaluation of the automatic metrics.

The participants in the manual annotation were
asked to evaluate system outputs by ranking trans-
lated sentences relative to each other. For each
source segment that was included in the proce-
dure, the annotator was shown five different out-
puts to which he or she was supposed to assign
ranks. Ties were allowed.

These collected rank labels for each five-tuple
of outputs were then interpreted as pairwise com-
parisons of systems and used to assign each sys-
tem a score that reflects how high that system was
usually ranked by the annotators. Several meth-
ods have been tested in the past for the exact score
calculation and WMT15 has adopted TrueSkill as
the official one. Please see the WMT15 overview
paper for details on how this score is computed.

For the metrics task in 2014, we were still using
the “Pre-TrueSkill” method called “> Others”, see
Bojar et al. (2011). Since we are now moving to
the golden truth calculated by TrueSkill, we report
also the average “Pre-TrueSkill” score in the rele-
vant tables for comparison.

2.2 Participants of the Metrics Shared Task

Table 1 lists the participants of the WMT15 Shared
Metrics Task, along with their metrics. We have
collected 46 metrics from a total of 11 research
groups.

Here we give a short description of each metric
that performed the best on at least one language
pair.

2.2.1 BEER and BEER TREEPEL
BEER is a trained metric, a linear model that
combines features capturing character n-grams
and permutation trees. BEER has participated
last year in sentence-level evalution. The main
additions this year are corpus-level aggregation
of sentence-level scores and a syntactic version
called BEER TREEPEL. BEER TREEPEL in-
cludes features checking the match of each type
of arc in the dependency trees of the hypothesis
and the reference.

BEER was the best for en-de and en-ru at the
system level and en-fi and en-ru at the sentence
level. BEER TREEPEL was the best for system-
level evaluation of ru-en.

2.2.2 BS
The metric BS has no corresponding paper, so
we include a summary by Mark Fishel here: The
BS metric was an attempt of moving in a dif-
ferent direction than most state-of-the-art metrics
and reduce complexity and language resource de-
pendence to the minimum. The score is obtained
from the number and lengths of “bad segments”:
continuous subsequences of words that are present
only in the hypothesis or the reference, but not
both. To account for morphologically complex
languages and smooth the score for sparse word
forms poor man’s lemmatization is added: the
floor of one third of each word’s characters are re-

moved from the word’s end. The final score is ei-
ther the log-sum of the bad segment lengths (BS)
or a simple sum (TOTAL-BS).

BS and DPMF were the best for system-level
English-French evaluation.

2.2.3 CHRF3
CHRF3 calculates a simple F-score combination of
the precision and recall of character n-grams of
length 6. The F-score is calculated with β = 3,
giving triple the weight to recall.

CHRF3 was the best for en-fi and en-cs at the
system level and en-cs at the sentence level.

2.2.4 DPMF and DPMFCOMB
DPMF is a syntax-based metric but unlike many
syntax-based metrics, it does not compute score
on substructures of the tree returned by a syntac-
tic parser. Instead, DPMF parses the reference
translation with a standard parser and trains a new
parser on the tree of the reference translation. This
new parser is then used for scoring the hypothesis.
Additionally, DPMF uses F-score of unigrams in
combination with the syntactic score.

DPMFCOMB is a combination of DPMF with
several other metrics available in the evaluation
tool Asiya2.

DPMF and BS were the best for system-level
evaluation of English-French. DPMF also tied
for the best place with UOW-LSTM for French-
English. DPMFCOMB was the best for fi-en, de-
en and cs-en at the sentence level.

2.2.5 DREEM
DREEM uses distributed word and sentence rep-
resentations of three different kinds: one-hot rep-
resentation, a distributed representation learned
with a neural network and a distributed sentence

2http://asiya-faust.cs.upc.edu/

257



representation learned with a recursive autoen-
coder. The final score is the cosine similarity of
the representation of the hypothesis and the refer-
ence, multiplied with a length penalty.

DREEM was the best for fi-en system-level
evaluation.

2.2.6 LEBLEU-OPTIMIZED
LEBLEU is a relaxation of the strict word n-gram
matching that is used in standard BLEU. Unlike
other similar relaxations, LEBLEU uses fuzzy
matching of longer chunks of text that allows, for
example, to match two independent words with a
compound. LEBLEU-OPTIMIZED applies fuzzy
match threshold and n-gram length optimized for
each language pair.

LEBLEU-OPTIMIZED was the best for en-de at
the sentence level.

2.2.7 RATATOUILLE
RATATOUILLE is a metric combination of
BLEU, BEER, Meteor and few more metrics out
of which METEOR-WSD is a novel contribution.
METEOR-WSD is an extension of Meteor that in-
cludes synonym mappings to languages other than
English based on alignments and rewards seman-
tically adequate translations in context.

RATATOUILLE was the best for sentence-
level French-English evaluation in both directions.

2.2.8 UOW-LSTM
UOW-LSTM uses dependency-tree recursive neu-
ral network to represent both the hypothesis and
the reference with a dense vector. The final
score is obtained from a neural network trained on
judgements from previous years converted to sim-
ilarity scores, taking into account both the distance
and angle of the two representations.

UOW-LSTM tied for the best place in fr-en
system-level evaluation with DPMF.

2.2.9 UPF-COBALT
UPF-COBALT pays an increased attention to syn-
tactic context (for example arguments, comple-
ments, modifiers etc.) both in aligning the words
of the hypothesis and reference as well as in scor-
ing of the matched words. It relies on additional
resources including stemmers, WordNet synsets,
paraphrase databases and distributed word repre-
sentations. UPF-COBALT system-level score was
calculated by taking the ratio of sentences in
which each system from a set of competitors was
assigned the highest sentence-level score.

UPF-COBALT was the best on system-level eval-
uation for de-en and, together with VERTA-
70ADEQ30FLU, for cs-en.

2.2.10 VERTA-70ADEQ30FLU
VERTA-70ADEQ30FLU aims at the combination
of adequacy and fluency features that use many
sources of different linguistic information: syn-
onyms, lemmas, PoS tags, dependency parses and
language models. On previous works VERTA’s
linguistic features combination were set depend-
ing on whether adequacy or fluency was evaluated.
VERTA-70ADEQ30FLU is a weighted combina-
tion of VERTA setups for adequacy (0.70) and flu-
ency (0.30).

VERTA-70ADEQ30FLU was, together with
UPF-COBALT, the best on cs-en on system level.

2.2.11 Baseline Metrics
In addition to the submitted metrics, we have com-
puted the following two groups of standard met-
rics as baselines for the system level:

• Mteval. The metrics BLEU (Papineni
et al., 2002) and NIST (Dodding-
ton, 2002) were computed using the
script mteval-v13a.pl3 which is
used in the OpenMT Evaluation Cam-
paign and includes its own tokeniza-
tion. We run mteval with the flag
--international-tokenization
since it performs slightly better (Macháček
and Bojar, 2013).

• Moses Scorer. The metrics TER (Snover et
al., 2006), WER, PER and CDER (Leusch et
al., 2006) were computed using the Moses
scorer which is used in Moses model opti-
mization. To tokenize the sentences, we used
the standard tokenizer script as available in
Moses toolkit.

For segment level baseline, we have used the
following modified version of BLEU:

• SentBLEU. The metric SentBLEU is com-
puted using the script sentence-bleu, part of
the Moses toolkit. It is a smoothed version
of BLEU that correlates better with human
judgements for segment level.

tools/

258



We have normalized all metrics’ scores such
that better translations get higher scores.

For computing the scores we used the same
script from the last year metric task.

3 System-Level Results

Same as last year, we used Pearson correlation co-
efficient as the main measure for system level met-
rics correlation. We use the following formula to
compute the Pearson’s r for each metric and trans-
lation direction:

r =
∑n

i=1(Hi − H̄)(Mi − M̄)√∑n
i=1(Hi − H̄)2

√∑n
i=1(Mi − M̄)2

(1)
where H is the vector of human scores of all

systems translating in the given direction, M is the
vector of the corresponding scores as predicted by
the given metric. H̄ and M̄ are their means re-
spectively.

Since we have normalized all metrics such that
better translations get higher score, we consider
metrics with values of Pearson’s r closer to 1 as
better.

You can find the system-level correlations for
translations into English in Table 2 and for transla-
tions out of English in Table 3. Each row in the ta-
bles contains correlations of a metric in each of the
examined translation directions. The upper part of
each table lists metrics that participated in all lan-
guage pairs and it is sorted by average Pearson cor-
relation coefficient across translation directions.
The lower part contains metrics limited to a subset
of the language pairs, so the average correlation
cannot be directly compared with other metrics
any more. The best results in each direction are in
bold. The reported empirical confidence intervals
of system level correlations were obtained through
bootstrap resampling of 1000 samples (confidence
level of 95%).

The move to TrueSkill golden truth slightly in-
creased the correlations and changed the rank-
ing of the metrics a little, but the general pat-
terns hold. (The correlation between “Average”
and “Pre-TrueSkill Average” is .999 for both di-
rections.)

Both tables also include the average Spearman’s
rank correlation, which used to be the evaluation
measure in the past. Spearman’s rank correlation
considers only the ranking of the systems and not

the distances between them. It is thus more sus-
ceptible to instability if several systems have sim-
ilar scores.

3.1 System-Level Discussion

As in the previous years, many metrics outperform
BLEU both into as well as out of English. Note
that the original BLEU was designed to work with
4 references and WMT provides just one; see Bo-
jar et al. (2013) for details on BLEU correlation
with varying number of references, up to several
thousands. This year, BLEU with one reference
reaches the average correlation of .92 into English
or .78 out of English. The best performing metrics
get up to .98 into English and .92 out of English.
CDER is the best of the baselines, reaching .94
into English and .81 out of English.

The winning metric for each language pair is
different, with interesting outliers: DREEM per-
formed best when evaluating English translations
from Finnish but on average, 12 other metrics
into English performed better and DREEM appears
to be among the worst metrics out of English.
RATATOUILLE is fifth to tenth when evaluated
by average Pearson but wins in both directions in
average Spearman’s rank correlation.

Two metrics confirm the effectiveness of
character-level measures, esp. the winners for out
of English evaluation: CHRF3 and BEER. The
metric CHRF3 is particularly interesting because
it does not require any resources whatsoever. It is
defined as a simple F-measure of character-level 6-
grams (spaces are ignored), with recall weighted 3
times more than precision. The balance between
the precision and recall seems important depend-
ing on morphological richness of the target lan-
guage: for evaluations into English, CHRF (equal
weights) performs better than CHRF3.

As we already observed in the past, the winning
metrics are trained on previous years of WMT.
This holds for DPMFCOMB, UOW-LSTM and
BEER including BEER TREEPEL. DPMF and
UPF-COBALT are not combination or trained met-
rics of any kind, DPMF is based on dependency
analysis of the candidate and reference sentences
and UPF-COBALT uses contextual information of
compared words in the candidate and the refer-
ence.

We see an interesting difference in the perfor-
mance of UOW-LSTM. It is the second metric in
system-level correlation but falls among the worst

259



ones in segment-level correlations, see Table 4 be-
low. Gupta et al. (2015b) suggest that the discrep-
ancy in performance could be based by low inter-
annotator agreement and Kendall’s τ not reflecting
the distances in translation quality between candi-
dates, an issue similar to what we see with Pearson
vs. Spearman’s rank correlations.

Another dense-representation metric, DREEM,
seems to suffer a similar discrepancy when evalu-
ating into English. Out of English, DREEM did
not perform very well.

An untested speculation is that the dense
sentence-level representation present in some
form in both UOW-LSTM as well as in DREEM
confuses the metrics in their judgements of indi-
vidual sentences.

3.2 Comparison with BLEU

In Appendix A, we provide two correlation plots
for each language pair. The first plot visualizes
the correlation of BLEU and manual judgements,
the second plot shows the correlation for the best
performing metric for that pair.

The BLEU plots include grey ellipses to indi-
cate the confidence intervals of both BLEU as well
as manual judgements. The ellipses are tilted only
to indicate that BLEU and the manual score are
dependent variables. Only the width and height
of each ellipse represent a value, that is the confi-
dence interval in each direction. The same verti-
cal confidence intervals hold for plots in the right-
hand column, but since we don’t have any con-
fidence estimates for the individual metrics, we
omit them.

Czech-English plots indicate that UPF-COBALT
was able to account for the very different be-
haviour of the transfer-based deep-syntactic sys-
tem CU-TECTO. It was also able to appreciate the
higher translation quality of montreal, UEDIN-*
and online-b. The big cluster of systems labelled
TT-* are submissions to the WMT15 Tuning Task
(Stanojević et al., 2015).

For English-Czech, we see that UEDIN-JHU and
MONTREAL are overfit for BLEU. In terms of
BLEU, they are very close to the winning system
CU-CHIMERA (a combination of CU-TECTO and
phrase-based Moses, followed by automatic post-
editing). CHRF3 is able to recognize the overfitting
for MONTREAL, a neural-network based system,
but not for UEDIN-JHU. CHRF3 also better recog-
nizes the distance in quality between larger sys-

tems (from COMMERCIAL1 above) and the small-
data tuning task systems.

For German-English, we see the same over-
fit of UEDIN-JHU towards BLEU. While neither
UPF-COBALT nor CHRF3 could recognize this for
translations involving Czech, the issue is spot-
ted by UPF-COBALT for systems involving Ger-
man. Syntax-based systems like UEDIN-SYNTAX
for English-German and (presumably) ONLINE-B
for German-English are among those where the
correlation got most improved over BLEU.

The French dataset was in a different domain,
which may explain why the best performing met-
ric DPMF does actually not improve much above
BLEU. DPMF uses a syntactic parser on the ref-
erence, and the performance of parsers on discus-
sions is likely to be lower than the generally used
news domain.

In Finnish results, we see again UEDIN-JHU and
ABUMATRAN (Rubino et al., 2015) overvalued by
BLEU. DREEM based on distributed representa-
tion of words and sentences is able to recognize
this for translation into English but it falls among
the worst metrics in the other direction. For trans-
lation into Finnish, character-based n-grams of
CHRF3 are much more reliable. Variants of ABU-
MATRAN were again those most overvalued by
BLEU. ABUMATRAN uses several types of mor-
phological segmentation and reconstructs Finnish
words from the segments by concatenation. ABU-
MATRAN is loaded with many other features, like
web-crawled data and domain handling, and sys-
tem combination of several approaches. The opti-
mization towards BLEU (unreliable for Finnish, as
we have learned in this task), could be among the
main reasons behind the comparably lower man-
ual scores.

For Russian, BEER is the best metric, in its
syntax-aware variant BEER TREEPEL for evalu-
ating English. Compared to BLEU, the improve-
ment in correlation is not that striking for Russian-
English. (It would be interesting to know whether
ONLINE-G is better than ONLINE-B because of En-
glish syntax or addressing source-side morphol-
ogy better. BEER TREEPEL captures both as-
pects.) In the other direction, targetting Russian,
BLEU was effectively unable to rank the systems
at all. It is probably the character-level features in
BEER that allow it to reach a very good correla-
tion, .97.

4 Segment-Level Results

We measure the quality of metrics’ segment-level
scores using Kendall’s τ rank correlation coeffi-
cient. In this type of evaluation, a metric is ex-
pected to predict the result of the manual pairwise
comparison of two systems. Note that the golden
truth is obtained from a compact annotation of five
systems at once, while an experiment with text-to-
speech evaluation techniques by Vazquez-Alvarez
and Huckvale (2002) suggest that a genuine pair-
wise comparison is likely to lead to more stable
results.

The basic formula for Kendall’s τ is:

τ =
|Concordant| − |Discordant|
|Concordant| + |Discordant| (2)

where Concordant is the set of all human com-
parisons for which a given metric suggests the
same order and Discordant is the set of all human
comparisons for which a given metric disagrees.
The formula is not specific with respect to ties, i.e.
cases where the annotation says that the two out-
puts are equally good.

The way in which ties (both in human and
metric judgment) were incorporated in comput-
ing Kendall τ changed each year of WMT metric
tasks. Here we adopt the version from WMT14.
For a detailed discussion on other options, see
Macháček and Bojar (2014).

The method is formally described using the fol-
lowing matrix:

Metric
< = >

H
um

an < 1 0 -1
= X X X
> -1 0 1

Given such a matrix Ch,m where h, m ∈ {<,=
, >}4 and a metric, we compute the Kendall’s τ for
the metric the following way:

We insert each extracted human pairwise com-
parison into exactly one of the nine sets Sh,m ac-
cording to human and metric ranks. For example
the set S<,> contains all comparisons where the
left-hand system was ranked better than right-hand
system by humans and it was ranked the other way
round by the metric in question.

To compute the numerator of Kendall’s τ , we
take the coefficients from the matrix Ch,m, use

4Here the relation < always means ”is better than“ even
for metrics where the better system receives a higher score.

them to multiply the sizes of the corresponding
sets Sh,m and then sum them up. We do not in-
clude sets for which the value of Ch,m is X. To
compute the denominator of Kendall’s τ , we sim-
ply sum the sizes of all the sets Sh,m except those
where Ch,m = X. To define it formally:

τ =

∑
h,m∈{<,=,>}

Ch,m ̸=X

Ch,m|Sh,m|

∑
h,m∈{<,=,>}

Ch,m ̸=X

|Sh,m| (3)

To summarize, the WMT14 matrix specifies to:

• exclude all human ties,
• count metric’s ties only for the denominator

of Kendall τ (thus giving no credit for giving
a tie),

• all cases of disagreement between hu-
man and metric judgements are counted as
Discordant,

• all cases of agreement between human
and metric judgements are counted as
Concordant.

You can find the system-level correlations for
translations into English in Table 4 and for trans-
lations out of English in Table 5. Again, the upper
part of each table contains metrics participating in
all language pairs and it is sorted by average τ
across translation directions. The lower part con-
tains metrics limited to a subset of the language
pairs, so the average cannot be directly compared
with other metrics any more.

4.1 Segment-Level Discussion
As usual, segment-level correlations are signifi-
cantly lower than system-level ones. The highest
correlation is reached by DPMFCOMB on Czech-
to-English: .495 of Kendall’s τ . The correlations
reach on average .447 into English and .400 out of
English.

DPMFCOMB is the clear winner into English,
followed by BEER TREEPEL, both of which con-
sider syntactic structure of the sentence, combined
with several other independent features or metrics.

RATATOUILLE, also a combined metric, is
the best option for evaluation to and from French.

Metrics considering character-level n-grams
(BEER and CHRF3) are particularly good for

Table 6: Kendall’s τ scores for two metrics across
years.

evaluation out of English and their margin seems
to the highest for English-to-Finnish, up to .06
points.

Only two segment-level metrics took part in
2014 and 2015, BEER in a slightly improved
implementation (with some small effect on the
scores) and SENTBLEU in exactly the same im-
plementation. Table 6 documents that this year,
the scores are on average slightly higher. The main
reason lies probably in the test set, which may be
somewhat easier this year. French is different, the
correlations decreased somewhat this year, which
can be easily explained by the domain change:
news in 2014 and discussions in 2015. The in-
crease should not be caused by the redundancy
cleanup of WMT manual rankings, see Bojar et al.
(2015), since the collapsed systems get a tie after
expanding and our implementation ignores all tied
manual comparisons.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we summarized the results of the
WMT15 Metrics Shared Task, which assesses the
quality of various automatic machine translation
metrics. As in previous years, human judgements
collected in WMT15 serve as the golden truth and
we check how well the metrics predict the judge-
ments at the level of individual sentences as well
as at the level of the whole test set (system-level).

Across the two types of evaluation and the
10 language pairs, we saw great performance

of trained and combined metrics (DPMFCOMB,
BEER, RATATOUILLE and others). Neural net-
works for continuous word and sentence repre-
sentations have also shown their generalization
power, with an interesting discrepancy in system-
vs. segment-level performance of UOW-LSTM
and to a smaller degree of DREEM.

We value high the metric CHRF or CHRF3 for
its extreme simplicity and very good performance
at both system and segment level and especially
out of English. We are curious to see if CHRF3
has the potential of becoming “the BLEU for the
next five years”. It would be very interesting to test
its usability in system tuning. It is known that in
tuning, metrics putting too much attention to recall
can be easily tricked, but perhaps a careful setting
of CHRF’s β will be sufficient.

The WMT Metrics Task again attracted a good
number of participants and the majority of submit-
ted metrics are actually new ones. This is good
news, indicating that MT metrics are an active
field of research. Most, if not all metrics come
with the source code, so it should be relatively
easy to use them in own experiments. Still, we
would expect much wider adoption of the metrics,
if they made it for example to the standard Moses
scorer or at least to the Asyia toolkit.
