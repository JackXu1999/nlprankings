Abstract

This paper evaluates the impact of vari-
ous event extraction systems on automatic
pathway curation using the popular mTOR
pathway. We quantify the impact of train-
ing data sets as well as different machine
learning classifiers and show that some
improve the quality of automatically ex-
tracted pathways.

1 Introduction

Biological pathways encode sequences of biolog-
ical reactions, such as phosphorylation, activa-
tion etc, involving various biological species, such
as genes, proteins (Aldridge et al., 2006; Kitano,
2002). Studying and analyzing pathways is cru-
cial to understanding biological systems and for
the development of effective disease treatments
and drugs (Creixell et al., 2015; Khatri et al.,
2012). There have been numerous efforts to re-
construct detailed process-based and disease level
pathway maps such as Parkinson disease map (Fu-
jita et al., 2014), Alzheimers disease Map (Mizuno
et al., 2012), mTOR pathway Map (Caron et al.,
2010), and the TLR pathway map (Oda and Ki-
tano, 2006). Traditionally, these maps are con-
structed and curated by expert pathway curators
who manually read numerous biomedical docu-
ments, comprehend and assimilate the knowledge
in them and construct the pathway.

With increasing number of scientific publica-
tions manual pathway curation is becoming more
and more impossible. Therefore, Automated Path-
way Curation (APC) and semi-automated biolog-
ical knowledge extraction has been an active re-
search area (Ananiadou et al., 2010; Ohta et al.,
2013; Szostak et al., 2015) trying to overcome
the limitations of manual curation using vari-
ous techniques from hand-crafted NLP systems

(Allen et al., 2015) to machine learning techniques
(Björne et al., 2011). Machine-learning NLP sys-
tems, in particular, show good performance in
BioNLP tasks, but they are still performing less
good in automated pathway curation, partly be-
cause there have been few attempts to measure the
performance of NLP systems for APC directly.

Recently, there has been some attempt at rem-
edying the situation and new datasets and eval-
uation measures have been proposed. For in-
stance, Spranger et al. (2016) use the popu-
lar human-generated mTOR pathway map (Caron
et al., 2010; Efeyan and Sabatini, 2010; Katiyar
et al., 2009) and quantify the performance of a par-
ticular APC system and its ability to recreate the
complete pathway automatically. Results reported
were mixed.

One of the key components in such APC sys-
tems is identification of triggers, events and their
relationships. These machine learning-based sys-
tems are essentially just supervised classification
components.

This paper explores whether we can improve
results of automated pathway curation for mTOR
pathway by using different training datasets and
learning algorithms. We show that the choice of
event extraction classifiers increases F-score by up
to 20% compared to state-of-the-art system. Our
results also show that within limits the choice of
training data has significantly less impact on re-
sults than the choice of classifier. Our results
also suggest that additional research is necessary
to solve the problem of APC.

2 Automatic Pathway Curation

We constructed an automatic pathway curation
system that take as input scientific articles in PDF
format and transforms them into SBML encoded,
annotated pathway maps. The pipeline has multi-

247



ple steps.

1. PDFs are translated into pure text files using
the cermine1 tool.

2. Preprocessing provides tokenization, POS
tagging, dependency and syntax parsing.

3. An event extraction system extracts the men-
tions of entities (genes, proteins etc), reac-
tions (e.g. phosphorylation) and their argu-
ments (theme, cause, product).

4. A converter constructs pathways from the in-
formation provided by the event extraction
system.

5. An annotation system maps extracted entities
and events to Entrez gene identifiers and SBO
terms.

The following sections detail steps 3 to 5.

2.1 Event Extraction

We used the TURKU Event Extraction System
(TEES) for event extraction (Björne et al., 2010).
This system is one of the most successful BioNLP
systems. It has not only won 1st place in BioNLP
competitions but was also the only one NLP sys-
tem that participated in all BioNLP-ST 2013 tasks
(Björne et al., 2012). The system combines var-
ious NLP techniques to extract information from
text. TEES workflow consists of four steps:

1. Trigger Detection - detection of named enti-
ties and event triggers in a given sentence to
construct nodes of the event graph.

2. Edge detection - construction of complex
events linking few triggers to create event
graph. Output produced during this step is
often a directed, typed edge connecting two
entity nodes.

3. Unmerging - event nodes from merged event
graph are duplicated in order to separate ar-
guments into valid combinations. This step
is needed for evaluation of final results in
BioNLP Shared Task standard.

4. Modifiers detection - final component that
defines additional attributes for events such
as speculation and negation modifiers.

By default TEES trains a different instance of
multiclass Support Vector Machines (SVM) for
each step. Recent versions of TEES (Björne and

1http://cermine.ceon.pl/index.html

Salakoski, 2015) allow to easily exchange the
SVM classifiers with other supervised classifica-
tion algorithms. For example, all scikit-learn mul-
ticlass, supervised learning algorithms that sup-
port sparse feature matrices can be applied (Pe-
dregosa et al., 2011). Thanks to this it is possi-
ble to test different algorithms for event extraction
task and automatic pathway extraction. For this
paper, we exchanges classifiers in all steps 1-4s
as described in Section 3. The output of TEES is
a standoff formatted representation of entities and
events.

2.2 Conversion Standoff to SBML pathways

In principle events and entities extracted by TEES
correspond to biological species and reactions.
We translate the NLP representation into SBML
– the standard, XML-based markup language
for representing biological models (Hucka et al.,
2003). SBML essentially encodes models us-
ing biological players called sbml:species2.
sbml:species can participate in interac-
tions, called sbml:reaction. Species par-
ticipate in interaction as sbml:reactant,
sbml:product and sbml:modifier. The
basic idea being that some quantity of reactant is
consumed to produce a product. Reactions are
influenced by modifiers. The mapping algorithm
is adopted from and described in more detail in
Spranger et al. (2015).

2.3 SBO/GO, Entrez Gene Annotations

The SBML encoded, automatically extracted path-
way is further annotated using Systems Biology
Ontology (SBO) (Le Novère, 2006) and Gene On-
tology (GO) terms. SBO also provides a class hi-
erarchy for reaction types. For instance, the NLP
system identify phosphorylation reactions, which
are a subclass of conversion reactions. All reac-
tions in the data are automatically annotated with
SBO/GO term (coverage 100%) using an annota-
tion scheme detailed in (Spranger et al., 2015).

Species (e.g. proteins, genes) were annotated
using the gene/protein named entity recognition
and normalization software GNAT (Hakenberg
et al., 2011) - a publicly available gene/protein
normalization tool. GNAT returns a set of En-
trez Gene identifiers (Maglott et al., 2005) for each
input string. Species were annotated using all
returned Entrez Gene identifiers for a particular

species (organism human). We call the set of En-
trez Gene identifiers returned by GNAT for each
species Entrez Gene signature.

3 Classifiers for Event Extraction

In this paper we evaluate classifiers for event ex-
traction (Section 2.1) and their impact on the over-
all performance of the automatic pathway extrac-
tion system. We compare the following classifiers:

• Support Vector Machines (SVM) is the de-
fault TEES classifier (Joachims, 1999). It
was optimized for linear classification and its
performance scales linearly with the number
of training examples.

• Decision Tree (DT) creates a model that can
predict the target value by learning simple de-
cision rules inferred from the training data.
Compared to the other techniques they are
relatively fast, cost of using tree is logarith-
mic in the number of examples. We use Gini
impurity criterion to evaluate quality of the
split.

• Random Forest (RF) classifiers fit a number
of ensembled decision tree classifiers, each
built from a bootstrap sample of a training
set. The best split of node is chosen only from
a random subset of the features, not all fea-
tures. Final classifiers are combined by av-
eraging their probabilistic prediction. Single
tree have a higher bias but, due to averaging
variance of the random forest as a whole de-
creases.

• Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNNB) This is
an implementation of the naive Bayes algo-
rithm for multinomial data which is one of
the classic variants used in classification of
discrete features (e.g. text classification).
Additive smoothing parameter was set to 1.

• Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) MLP is a
feedforward neural network model. We use
hidden layer with 100 neurons and rectified
linear unit activation function. We optimize
for logarithmic loss using stochastic gradient
descent. Learning rate is constant and equal
to 0.001.

For DT, RF, MNNB and MLP we use imple-
mentations from scikit-learn Python library (Pe-
dregosa et al., 2011).

4 Datasets

4.1 Training Datasets

In order to quantify the impact of training data, we
test the following three training sets.

• ANN - consists of 60 abstracts of scien-
tific papers from Pubmed database related to
the mTORpathway map. This dataset was
human-annotated for NLP system training
(Ohta et al., 2011, Corpus annotations (c)
GENIA Project) .

249



• GE11 consists of 908 abstracts and full texts
of scientific papers used in BioNLP ST 2011
GENIA Event Extraction task as training data
(Kim et al., 2012).

• PC13 consists of 260 abstracts of scientific
papers used in BioNLP ST 2013 Pathway
Curation task as training data (Ohta et al.,
2013). The task goal was to evaluate the ap-
plicability of event extraction systems to sup-
port the automatic curation and evaluation of
biomolecular pathway models.

The overall corpora statistics are summarized in
Table 1. GE11 and PC13 have the largest number
of annotated events. ANN is much smaller in com-
parison. Also, the distribution of event types dif-
fers between data sets (Table 2). GE11 uses more
general terms (Binding, Regulation) compared to
PC13 where some specific events appear only a
few times (Deacetylation, Hydroxylation, Methy-
lation).

We train classifiers on four combinations of
the three training datasets: 1) standalone GE11;
2) GE11+ANN - combined GE11 and ANN; 3)
combined GE11+PC13+ANN - GE11, PC13 and
ANN; 4) PC13+ANN - combined PC13 and ANN.
For instance, DT+GE11 refers to a decision tree
classifier trained on GE11.

We use GE11-Devel BioNLP ST2011 dataset
for hyperparameter optimization of all classifiers.

4.2 Test Data
Performance of classifiers is tested on the mTOR
pathway map (Caron et al., 2010). The map was
constructed by expert human curators using 522
full text papers from the PubMed database. The
experts curated a single large map using CellDe-
signer (Funahashi et al., 2008) - a software for
modeling and executing mechanistic models of
pathways. CellDesigner represents information
using a heavily customized XML-based SBML
format (Hucka et al., 2003).

Target Human expert data We translate the
curator map into standard SBML and further en-
rich the information using SBO/GO and Entrez
Gene annotations. For SBO/GO, we use existing
annotations provided by curators and extend them
by automatic annotations deduced from reactants
and products of reactions. For example, if a phos-
phoryl group is added in a reaction, it is annotated
using the SBO term for phosphorylation. Each re-
action may be annotated with multiple SBO/GO

terms. Also we annotate the curated map with En-
trez gene identifiers (similar to the automatic ex-
traction data). We call this pathway TARGET.

Testing classifiers The 522 full text papers –
used by human curators for the construction of the
mTOR pathway – are used for evaluating the dif-
ferent text mining classifiers. For this, we plug
in (trained) classifiers into the automatic pathway
extraction pipeline which performs preprocessing,
event extraction, conversion to SBML and anno-
tation (see also Section 2). The output of this is
an annotated SBML file that is subsequently com-
pared to human-curated SBML-encoded pathway
data.

5 Evaluation

Evaluation of the classifiers (and the system as
a whole) is performed by comparing the auto-
matically extracted pathway with the hand-curated
pathway. Spranger et al. (2016) propose a num-
ber of graph overlap algorithms for quantifying the
difference and similarity of two pathways. Here
we employ the same measures. The following
summarizes the strategies.

Species In order to decide whether species in
two pathways are the same, we use the name of
the identifiers and their Entrez gene signatures.

nmeq: Two species are equal if their names are
exactly equal. We remove certain prefixes
from the names (e.g. phosphorylated).

appeq: Two species are equal if their names
are approximately equal. Two names are
approximately equal iff their Levenshtein-
based string distance is above 90 (Leven-
shtein, 1966)

enteq: Two species are equal if their entrez gene
identifiers are exactly equal. This basically
translates to the two species bqbiol:is identi-
fier sets being exactly the same (order does
not matter).

entov: Two species are equal if their entrez gene
identifiers sets overlap. This basically trans-
lates to the two species bqbiol:is identifier
sets overlapping.

wc: Human curated data contains complex
species that contain other species as con-
stituents (species that consist of various pro-
teins etc). wc allows species to match with
constituents of complexes.

Reaction match based on their SBO/GO anno-
tations

250



sboeq: Two reactions are equal iff their signa-
tures are exactly the same. That is, the whole
set of SBO/GO terms of one reaction is the
same as of the other reaction.

sboov: Two reactions are equal, iff their signa-
tures overlap. That is, the intersection of the
set of SBO/GO terms of one reaction is with
the set of SBO/GO terms of the other reaction
is not empty.

sobisa: Two reactions are equal, iff there is at
least one SBO/GO term in each signature that
relate in a is a relationship in the SBO re-
action type hierarchy. For instance, if there
is a phosphorylation reaction and a conver-
sion reaction, then sboisa will match because
phosphorylation is a subclass of conversion
according to the SBO type hierarchy.

Edges only match if their labels are strictly
equal. So if an edge is a reactant, then it has to
be a reactant in the other pathway. Same holds for
products and modifiers.

Subgraph matching strategies are combina-
tions of matching strategies for species, reactions
(and for edges which is always the same). For in-
stance, the matching strategy nmeq, sboeq is the
most strict and requires that species names are ex-
actly equal and that SBO/GO signatures of reac-
tions are exactly equal. The matching strategy
appeq/enteq/wc, sboisa is the most loose strategy.
In this strategy, two species match if their names
are approximately equal or if their Entrez gene
identifiers overlap or if any of this applies to one of
the constituents of the two species. Two reactions
match if any of their SBO/GO terms are in a is a
relationship. We compare a total of 24 matching
strategies.

Subgraph overlap is computed as follows.
For each subgraph in the extracted pathway we
search for subgraphs in the human curated data
that match according to some subgraph matching
strategy. We use micro-averaged F-score, preci-
sion and recall (Sokolova and Lapalme, 2009) for
quantifying the retrieval results. F-score is used
to quantify the overlap of species, reactions and
edges. We then macro-average these results to get
a total F-score quantifying performance of the ex-
traction system as a whole.

6 Results

Some classifiers take long to train, so we only have
partial results for MLP. However, all other classi-

fiers (DT, MNNB, RF, SVM) finished training on
all selected combinations of training data sets.

Since we tested 24 subgraph overlap measures
with 18 classifiers, we receive a lot of data that
cannot be discussed in detail in this paper. Here,
we concentrate on general trends in the data. Code
and datasets are published as appropriate3.

6.1 Extraction Results: Species, Reactions,
Subgraphs

Generally speaking the extracted pathways con-
tain two order of magnitudes more species reac-
tions, and edges than the TARGET pathway (see
Table 3 for all results). This is normal since the
extracted pathways consist of all combinations of
entity and event mentions in text. The same enti-
ties may occur more often in the text then they are
referenced in the actual pathway.

Our results show that extraction classifiers per-
form inconsistent with respect to the identification
of compartments. While some classifiers retrieve
a lot of compartment information (via localization
events), others (especially MNNB trained on ANN
and PC13 datasets) do not extract any compart-
ments. MNNB with our parameter choice might
not be able to learn many different event types so
it skips least frequent reaction types (one of which
is localization event).

Measuring how many subgraphs there are per
pathway, we can see that more than half of all
species extracted by classifiers are isolated and not
connected to any reactions. Similarly we see many
(small) subgraphs being extracted by the classi-
fiers, whereas TARGET consists of essentially one
large connected graph (with a few modeling mis-
takes).

6.2 General Trends Subgraphs overlap
Let us first concentrate on overall performance
especially with respect to previous results. For
this we compute the best classifiers and their
score for different matching strategies. For each
matching strategy, we evaluate all classifiers and
then choose the best performing one and com-
pare it with the results reported in Spranger et al.
(2016)/Spr16. Table 4 shows that the best classi-
fiers outperform Spr16 in all cases and for some
subgraph overlap measures by 10 points.

If we analyze the classifiers from this paper in
more detail, results (Figure 1, Table 5) show that

(with 14 precision, 13 recall scores). For the loos-
est strategy (appeq/entov/wc, sboisa) this goes up
to F-score 52 (47 precision, 66 recall). These re-
sults show that when it comes to exact extraction
the classifiers fail badly, whereas with more looser
overlap strategies, performance becomes reason-
able and there is some overlap between the ex-

252



tracted and the human-curated data. Of course,
this also entails that the automatically extracted
pathway does not completely capture what hu-
mans are constructing from the text.

Generally speaking overlap strategies that are
loose with respect to constituents of complex
species (wc) outperform their non wc counterparts.
For instance, nmeq/wc, sboeq performs much bet-
ter than nmeq, sboeq. This shows that complex
species are important for the mTOR pathway but
their extraction is not very detailed - which is why
the overlap matching strategy has to be lenient
with respect to complex species constituents. The
increase in F-score for wc matching strategies is
primarily driven by an increase in recall score. For
instance, the difference between nmeq, sboeq and
nmeq/wc, sboeq is more than 20 points, whereas
precision does not improve that much. The rea-
sons for that is that the same subgraphs in the ex-
tracted pathway overlap with more subgraphs in
TARGET. So it is not the case that other subgraphs
in the extracted pathway overlap with TARGET.

Results also show that recall is in general much
higher than precision for looser strategies. For
instance, wc strategies (right hand side of Figure
1) double the recall score w.r.t to their precision
scores. This also shows that in principle loosen-
ing matching strategies impacts mostly recall as
the same subgraphs in the extracted data overlap
with the human curated data.

6.3 Classifier Performance in Detail

The bottom figure in Figure 2 shows the best clas-
sifiers in terms of precision, recall and F-score. We
measured how often a classifier is the best classi-
fier (for each of the 24 subgraph overlap strate-
gies). It is clear that overall Random Forest classi-
fier (RF) performance is the best. For all 24 match-
ing strategies it is a Random Forest classifier that
is better than any other competitor with RF trained
on PC13 and ANN being the most frequent best
classifier overall. Second place is Random For-
est trained simply on GE11 (the largest dataset in
terms of entities and events). No other classifiers
(SVM, MLP, MNNB, DT) outperform RF. Train-
ing on all datasets (RF+GE11+PC13+ANN) does
not seem to increase success significantly. Perfor-
mance across different RF classifiers is on par and
good (see Table 5)

Results in the top figure of Figure 2 show
that RF has the best precision performance.

togram is generated by counting how often a clas-
sifier is the best for a particular subgraph matching
strategy.

RF+PC13+ANN is the most frequent best
classifier w.r.t precision. RF+GE11 and
RF+GE11+PC13+ANN also performing compa-
rably. Compared to recall this means that RF wins
F-score because they are best in precision.

No RF classifier performs best in recall. Results
show that MLP, DT and SVM all perform well for
certain subgraph overlap strategies with SVM be-

ing most often the best classifier, followed by var-
ious DT-based classifiers and MLP.

Figure 3 gives results for all classifiers across
all matching strategies. Looser strategies give the
max and strict matching strategies the min data
points. We can see that performance is primar-
ily driven by the choice of classifier as the F-score
mostly varies with the type of classifier used (even
though there are a few outliers). Situation is a bit
more varied for precision and recall. Interestingly
choice of dataset seems to have less impact. Gen-
erally speaking MNNB are the least successful.
RF clearly dominate precision on average but are
close enough to DT and SVM on recall.

7 Conclusion

This paper continues the current trend of extend-
ing NLP systems for APC and building more com-
plete systems that allow evaluation with respect
to some external standard - here the hand curated
mTOR pathway.

We measured the impact of different classifiers
on retrieval performance and showed that certain
classifiers have the potential to increase retrieval
performance. Especially Random Forest classi-
fiers perform much better on mTOR than previ-
ously tried Support Vector Machines. On the other
hand, the training data choice seems to have lit-
tle impact (at least for the tested ANN, GE11 and
PC13 training datasets).

Spranger et al. (2016) argue that not all of the
problems of APC can be overcome by using more
training data on event extraction systems. They ar-
gue that additions such as complex species recog-
nition, co-reference resolution and pathway con-
struction are needed to ultimately solve the prob-
lem posed by APC. This certainly remains true and
is not directly questioned by results in this paper.
The system described here does not automatically
compose single pathway maps from the extracted
data. Nevertheless, our results suggest that a lot of
progress can be made by improving on the event
extraction part of the pipeline.

This paper focuses on evaluating current ma-
chine learning techniques for event extraction. We
are currently in the process of evaluating other sys-
tems including rule-based ones.
