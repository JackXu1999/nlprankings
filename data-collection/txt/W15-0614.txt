Abstract

We present the Jinan Chinese Learner Cor-
pus, a large collection of L2 Chinese texts pro-
duced by learners that can be used for edu-
cational tasks. The present work introduces
the data and provides a detailed description.
Currently, the corpus contains approximately
6 million Chinese characters written by stu-
dents from over 50 different L1 backgrounds.
This is a large-scale corpus of learner Chinese
texts which is freely available to researchers
either through a web interface or as a set of
raw texts. The data can be used in NLP tasks
including automatic essay grading, language
transfer analysis and error detection and cor-
rection. It can also be used in applied and cor-
pus linguistics to support Second Language
Acquisition (SLA) research and the develop-
ment of pedagogical resources. Practical ap-
plications of the data and future directions are
discussed.

1 Introduction

Despite the rapid growth of learner corpus research
in recent years (Dı́az-Negrillo et al., 2013), no large-
scale corpus of second language (L2) Chinese has
been made readily available to the research commu-
nity.

Learner corpora are often used to investigate
learner language production in an exploratory man-
ner in order to generate hypotheses about learner
language. Recently, learner corpora have also been
utilized in various educational NLP tasks includ-
ing error detection and correction (Gamon et al.,

2013), Native Language Identification (Tetreault et
al., 2013) and language transfer hypothesis formula-
tion (Swanson and Charniak, 2014).

While such corpus-based studies have become an
accepted standard in SLA research and relevant NLP
tasks, there remains a paucity of large-scale L2 cor-
pora. For L2 English, the two main datasets are the
ICLE (Granger, 2003) and TOEFL11 (Blanchard et
al., 2013) corpora, with the latter being the largest
publicly available corpus of non-native English writ-
ing.1 However, this data scarcity is far more acute
for L2 other than English and this has not gone
unnoticed by the research community (Lozano and
Mendikoetxea, 2013; Abuhakema et al., 2008).

The present work attempts to address this gap by
making available the Jinan Chinese Learner Corpus
(JCLC), an L2 Chinese corpus designed for use in
NLP, corpus linguistics and other educational do-
mains. This corpus stands out for its considerable
size and breadth of data collection. Furthermore, the
corpus – an ongoing project since 2006 – continues
to be expanded with new data. In releasing this data
we hope to equip researchers with the data to sup-
port numerous research directions2 going forward.

The JCLC is freely available to the research com-
munity and accessible via our website.3 It can be
used via a web-based interface for querying the data.
Alternatively, the original texts can be downloaded
in text format for more advanced tasks.

1TOEFL11 contains over 4 million tokens in 12,100 texts.

2 Background

Interest in learning Chinese is rapidly growing, lead-
ing to increased research in Teaching Chinese as a
Foreign Language (TCFL) and the development of
related resources such as learner corpora (Chen et
al., 2010).

This booming growth in Chinese language learn-
ing (Rose and Carson, 2014; Zhao and Huang,
2010), related to the dramatic globalization of the
past few decades and a shift in the global language
order (Tsung and Cruickshank, 2011), has brought
with it learners from diverse backgrounds. Conse-
quently, a key challenge here is the development
of appropriate resources – language learning tools,
assessments and pedagogical materials – driven by
language technology, applied linguistics and SLA
research (Tsung and Cruickshank, 2011). The ap-
plication of these tools and SLA research can greatly
assist researchers in creating effective teaching prac-
tices and is an area of active research.

This pattern of growing interest in Chinese is also
reflected in the NLP community, evidenced by the
continuously increasing research focus on Chinese
tools and resources (Wong et al., 2009).

A key application of such corpora is in the field of
Second Language Acquisition (SLA) which aims to
build models of language acquisition. One aspect of
SLA is to formulate and test hypotheses about par-
ticularly common patterns of difficulty that impede
L2 production among students. This is usually done
using the natural language produced by learners to
identify deficits in their interlanguage.

A criticism of SLA has been that its empirical
foundation is weak (Granger, 2002), casting doubts
on the generalizability of results. However, this is
beginning to change with the shift towards using
large learner corpora. The creation of such corpora
has led to an efflorescence of empirical research into
language acquisition (Granger, 2002).

The use of NLP and machine learning methods
has also extended to SLA, with a new focus on
a combined multidisciplinary approach to develop-
ing methods for extracting ranked lists of language
transfer candidates (Swanson and Charniak, 2014;
Malmasi and Dras, 2014c).

3 Data Collection and Design

The JCLC project, started in 2006, aims to create
a corpus of non-native Chinese texts, similar to the
ICLE. The majority of the data has been collected
from foreign students learning Chinese at various
universities in China, with some data coming from
universities outside China. This data includes both
exams and assignments. The texts are manually
transcribed with all errors being maintained. Error
annotations are not available at this stage.

In order to be representative, the corpus includes
student data from a wide range of countries and pro-
ficiency levels. 59 different nationalities are repre-
sented in the corpus. Proficiency levels are classified
according to the length of study and include: begin-
ners (less than 1 year), intermediate (2-3 years) and
advanced (3+ years). In selecting texts for inclusion,
we strived to maximize representativeness across all
proficiencies.

3.1 Data Format
The learner texts are made available as Unicode
(UTF-8) text files to ensure maximum compatibility
with linguistic and NLP tools.

3.2 Metadata
In order to support different research directions, ex-
tensive metadata about each text has been recorded.
This metadata is available in text, CSV and Mi-
crosoft Excel format. The variables are outlined be-
low.

Writing ID A unique id assigned to each text.

Writing Type Either exam or assignment.

Student ID While student names are redacted,
they are each assigned a unique ID which allows for
the analysis of longitudinal data in the corpus.

Date The submission date of the writing also en-
ables longitudinal analysis of a student’s data.

Gender, Age and Education level This data al-
lows the investigation of other research questions,
e.g. the critical age hypothesis (Birdsong, 1999).

Native Language This variable is helpful in
studying language transfer effects by taking into ac-
count the author’s native language.

119



Other Acquired Languages It should be noted
that the currently used learner corpora, including the
ICLE and TOEFL11, fail to distinguish whether the
learner language is in fact the writer’s second lan-
guage, or if it is possibly a third language (L3). It has
been noted in the SLA literature that when acquiring
an L3, there may be instances of both L1- and L2-
based transfer effects on L3 production (Ringbom,
2001). Studies of such second language transfer ef-
fects during third language acquisition have been a
recent focus on cross-linguistic influence research
(Murphy, 2005). The JCLC is the first large-scale
learner corpus to include this information as well.

Proficiency Level Determined by the length of
study, as described above, a level of beginner, in-
termediate or advanced is assigned to each text.

Length of Chinese study The amount of time
spent studying Chinese. Study inside and outside
China are recorded separately.

Chinese heritage learner This variable indicates
if the learner is of Chinese heritage, was exposed to
Chinese at home, and if so, which dialect.

4 Corpus Analysis

We now turn to a brief analysis of the corpus. The
current version of the JCLC contains 5.91 million
Chinese characters across 8,739 texts. The top back-
grounds of the learners and their text frequency and
mean lengths4 are shown in Table 1.

We also observe high variability in text lengths
across the data.5 A histogram of the text lengths,
shown in Figure 1, confirms this trend. We believe
that this is a result of the data being collected from
a variety of tasks of different scopes from a range of
courses at different institutes. Most texts fall in the
250-700 token range of the distribution.

For text types, 57% of the texts are assignments
while the remaining 43% are mostly exams.

We can also look at the distribution of proficiency
levels in the data, as shown in Figure 2. The ma-
jority of the texts, 65%, fall into the medium cate-
gory with 21% and 14% in the low and high levels,
respectively. Comparing this distribution to that of
the data in the TOEFL11, also shown in Figure 2,

we observe a similar trend with the great majority of
the data falling into the medium proficiency bracket.
The TOEFL11 has more advanced learners, which
is to be expected given that the texts are all collected
from a high-stakes exam.

While the data sampling is not equal across all
language/proficiency groups we note that this type
of imbalance is a perennial problem present in most
learner corpora and generally a result of the demo-
graphics of the students. Given these constraints,
we strived to adhere to key corpus design principles
(Wynne, 2005) at all stages.

In sum, we see that the JCLC is a large corpus and
represents various native language and proficiency
groups. These characteristics make it suitable for a
wide range of research tasks, as described in the next
section.

5 Applications

Educational studies in linguistics and NLP have
been increasing recently. To this end, this corpus
can be used in various areas, as outlined here.

Automatic Essay Scoring is an active area of re-
search that relies on examining the differences be-
tween proficiency levels using large learner data and
NLP methods (Yannakoudakis et al., 2011). Given
the inclusion of proficiency data, the JCLC could
also be used to investigate the extension of current
automatic grading techniques to Chinese, something
which has not been done to date.

Error Detection and Correction There is grow-
ing research in building error detection and cor-
rection systems trained on learner corpus data
(Dahlmeier and Ng, 2011; Han et al., 2010). This
was also the focus of a recent shared tasks includ-
ing Helping Our Own (Dale and Kilgarriff, 2011;
Dale et al., 2012) and CoNLL shared tasks (Ng et
al., 2013). A recent shared task also focused on Chi-
nese error correction (Yu et al., 2014). This research
was also recently extended to Chinese word ordering
error detection and correction (Cheng et al., 2014),
also using learner texts. The large JCLC can be used
in such tasks through the addition of error annota-
tions.

Native Language Identification is the task of in-
ferring an author’s native tongue based on their
writings in another language (Malmasi and Dras,
2015). This task mainly relies on learner corpora
and the JCLC could be directly applied here. A good
overview is presented in the review of the recent NLI
shared task (Tetreault et al., 2013). NLI methods
have already been tested on other languages includ-
ing Arabic and Finnish (Malmasi and Dras, 2014a;
Malmasi and Dras, 2014b).

Transfer Hypothesis Extraction Researchers
have recently investigated using data-driven tech-
niques combined with machine learning and NLP
to extract language transfer hypotheses from learner
corpora (Swanson and Charniak, 2014).

Second Language Acquisition researchers are in-
terested in contrasting the productions of natives and
non-natives (Housen, 2002). This is made possi-
ble with the JCLC data and the presence of multiple
L1s allows for contrastive interlanguage analysis be-
tween different native languages as well. The avail-
ability of such large-scale data with different L1-L2
combinations can enable broad language acquisition
research that can be extrapolated to other learners.

Pedagogical Material Development Learner cor-
pora have been used identify areas of difficulty and
enable material designers to create resources that
take into account the strengths and weaknesses of
students from distinct groups (McEnery and Xiao,
2011). This can also be further expanded to syllabus
development where corpus-derived knowledge can
be used to guide the design process.

Combined with language transfer analysis,
learner data can be used to aid development of
pedagogical material within a needs-based and
data-driven approach. Once language use patterns
are uncovered, they can be assessed for teachability
and used to create tailored, native language-specific
exercises and teaching material.

Automatic Assessment Generation Combined
with the above-mentioned error detection and lan-
guage transfer extraction methods, this data can be
used to automatically generate testing material (e.g.
Cloze tests). Following such an approach, recent
work by Sakaguchi et al. (2013) made use of large-
scale English learner data to generate fill-in-the-

121



blank quiz items for language learners. Previous
research in this space had also considered the au-
tomatic generation of multiple-choice questions for
language testing (Hoshino and Nakagawa, 2005),
but without learner data. The use of learner cor-
pora containing naturally produced errors provides
a much more promising synergy, enabling the as-
sessment of more complex linguistic errors beyond
articles, prepositions and synonyms. With further
annotations of the present errors, the JCLC could be
used for such tasks.

6 Conclusion and Future Work

The JCLC, a sizeable project that has been ongoing
for the last 8 years, has yielded a large-scale lan-
guage resource for researchers – the first of its kind.
As the only such corpus of this size, the JCLC is a
valuable resource to support research in various ar-
eas, some of which we outlined here.

Research in most of the tasks described in section
5 has focused on English. The availability of the
JCLC will enable much of this work to be extended
to Chinese, potentially opening new research areas
for the community.

The JCLC is an ongoing project and new data
continues to be collected and added to the corpus.
No fixed target size has been set and it is anticipated
that the corpus will grow to be much larger than the
current size.

Several directions for future work are under con-
sideration. One avenue is the the creation of fur-
ther annotation layers over the data to include addi-
tional linguistic information such as Chinese word
segmentation boundaries, part-of-speech tags, con-
stituency parses and grammatical dependencies. The
inclusion of error annotations and manual correc-
tions is another potential avenue for future work.

Another possibility is the addition of a new sub-
corpus of native texts that can be used as a con-
trol group for comparing native and non-native data.
This would enable further analysis of learner inter-
language.
