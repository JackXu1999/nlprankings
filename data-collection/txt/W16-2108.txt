Abstract

The Regesta Imperii (RI) are an important
source for research in European-medieval
history. Sources spread over many cen-
turies of medieval history – mainly char-
ters of German-Roman Emperors – are
summarized as “Regests” and pooled in
the RI. Interesting medieval demographic
groups and players are i.a. cities, citizens
or spiritual institutions (e.g. bishops or
monasteries). Themes of historical inter-
est are i.a. peace and war or the endow-
ment of new privileges. We investigate
the RI for important players and themes,
applying state-of-the-art text classification
methods from computational linguistics.
We examine the performance of different
classification methods in view of the lin-
guistically very heterogeneous RI, includ-
ing a Neural Network approach that is de-
signed to capture complex interactions be-
tween players and themes.

1 Introduction

The Regesta Imperii (RI)1 are considered a funda-
mental, autonomous source for German and Eu-
ropean history. It extends over many centuries,
from the Karolinger dynasty to Maximilian I, from
around 800 to 1500 AD. The RI have their roots in
the 19th century, when the German librarian Jo-
hann Friedrich Böhmer started to collect and doc-
ument the charters (including known and possibly
unknown fakes) of the German-Roman emperors,
in terms of so-called Regests. The Regests contain
relevant judicial content of the referenced char-
ters (cf. Zimmermann (2000), Niederkorn (2005),
Rübsamen and Kuczera (2006)). A royal charter

was created, for example, when an emperor de-
cided to give a land grant, or privileges such as
new rights to one of his landlords or cities.

Covering about 13 million tokens, the RI con-
stitutes a large-scale resource that is still grow-
ing today2. The 129,504 Regests we have access
to can be treated as a collection of corpora (e.g.,
one corpus for each Roman-German emperor dy-
nasty), or as a single corpus covering all collected
materials. Our work treats the RI as a single cor-
pus. The RI comprises texts written in different
German varieties, as well as Latin. Often we find
up to three different languages or varieties within
a single Regest.

As seen in Figure 1, the Regests are not evenly
distributed over time but have the greatest mass
from about 1200 to 1500 AD. Many terms and
concepts only occur in certain times. An overview

of corpus statistics is given in Table 1. The high
logarithmic type-token ratio (ttrlog) supports the
observation that the language of the RI is highly
heterogeneous: although the domain of the RI is
rather focused (abstracts of medieval charters), it
is notably higher than what we find in the contem-
porary German SDeWaC corpus3.

A Regest itself is a very unique form of a doc-
ument, and some of them are not easy to compre-
hend even for humans. Consider

Example 1 A Regest from 1332, issued in Parma
by Karl IV. (*1316, †1378).4

bekennt dem Johann de Landulphis, iudici et au-
ditori curie paterne et sue, achtzig goldgulden
für besoldung und sechzig goldgulden wegen
versendungen desselben schuldig zu sein. Reg-
istr. priv. von Pavia hs. (fol. pap. sec. 15 vel 16)
zu Pavia bl. 5.

The Regest describes an action of King Karl IV.
in 1332, in Parma, Italy. Karl IV. acknowledges
that he owes “Johann de Landulphis”, “achtzig
goldgulden” (eighty gold coins) for wages and
“sechzig goldgulden” (sixty gold coins) for rea-
sons which are rather difficult to interpret: “(...)
wegen versendungen desselben schuldig zu sein”
(interpretable as wages and travel expenses). Be-
yond that, the Regest contains information in Latin
(“iudici et auditori curie paterne et sue”), plus ref-
erences and meta information (last sentence).

It is easy for humans to infer that the theme of
the above Regest is about finances (indicated by
mentions of “goldgulden” (gold coins) and “besol-
dung” (wages)). Further, a specific group of per-
sons plays a role, namely nobles. This is indicated

by “de” in the name of “Johann de Landulphi”,
who is promised money by the king. The Latin
“de” in the middle of a name generally suggests
that the person belongs to the class of nobles, as in
“Elizabeth of (=de) England”. So, one may con-
clude that in the above Regest, the players are no-
bles, acting under the theme finances.

Our aim is to trace within the RI interesting de-
mographic groups joint with the themes of their
interactions. We aim to identify which Regest is
about which theme(s) and group(s), to perform in-
teresting data analysis, e.g. visualizing the impor-
tance of different groups and themes not only in
relation to time but also in relation to other factors
such as issuer, location, and possibly more.

With the support of a domain expert we deter-
mined interesting demographic groups (players)
and themes which play a role in the Regests. All
players and themes can be treated as individual bi-
nary classification problems. An overview is given
in Table 2. It can be interesting, e.g., to relate the
occurrence of city or citizens with occurrences of
privileges with respect to time, thus approximately
tracing the development of privileges for cities.5

A Regest can be labeled with zero to all of the
12 selected labels. Thus, there exist many possi-
ble combinations.6 We cast the labeling problem
as a multi-label document classification task, al-
lowing several labels (i.e. groups and themes) to
be assigned for a single document (i.e. Regest).

For automatic pattern recognition on this his-
toric data, we deploy four state-of-the text clas-
sification methods, (i.) Support Vector Ma-
chines (SVM) (binary classification); (ii.) Semi-

5This is an important field of historic research because
rights of European cities originated in the Middle Ages.

6Since each group and theme represents a binary variable,
there are 212 possible combinations.

Supervised SVMs (S3VMs), to exploit the large
amount of unlabeled data; (iii.) a Neural Net-
work as a meta-learner applied to the SVM outputs
(do the groups and themes influence each other?)
and (iv.). a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
classifier with pre-trained word vectors as input,
which operates directly on the input documents.

We evaluate all methods on a manually labeled
test set and perform data analyses on the full RI to
illustrate its usage in Digital Humanities research.

2 Related Work

To the best of our knowledge, no (published)
research has yet been conducted in the Digi-
tal Humanities community about NLP of the RI.
Kuczera (2015) experimentally transfers attributes
and relations between entities from the times of
Friedrich III. (i.e. a subset of the RI) into a graph
database and shows how historians could profit
from the possibilities offered by such structured
data repositories.

Ruotsalo et al. (2009) suggests that knowledge-
and machine learning based NLP methods can
help with complex annotation tasks in the cul-
tural heritage domain. Their experiments demon-
strate that automatic annotation of certain roles in
artwork descriptions closely matches the perfor-
mance of human annotators.

Piotrowski (2012) gives an overview of the
manifold challenges in applying NLP to histori-
cal documents. He reports that the effectiveness
of normalization strongly depends on text type
and language, and satisfying results are achieved
mainly on more recent texts. Piotrowski concludes
that “the highly variable spelling found in many
historical texts has remained one of the most trou-
blesome issues for NLP”. Thus we chose our pro-
cedure to not depend on normalized texts.

Massad et al. (2013) give an overview of the
processing of recorded history texts. They ex-
amined a graph-based approach and an approach
based on NLP. In their NLP experiments they an-
alyzed the Wikipedia corpus with respect to time,
relating specific strings and n-grams to time and
page edits. The authors suggest that future re-
search should focus on data analysis, trends and,
most importantly, the access to historic corpora
spanning a larger time span compared to the cor-
pus employed in their experiments. We think that
our research covers these aspects.

Meroño-Peñuela et al. (2014) in their survey on

History and Computing propose NLP methods for
dealing with raw corpora, yet do not propose spe-
cific tools due to manifold decisions to be taken,
that strongly depend on the nature of the data.

3 Approach

The aims of our work are two-fold. On the appli-
cation side, we aim to discover structures involv-
ing players and themes over times in the RI. On the
methods side, we investigate to what extent Neu-
ral Networks (NN) are capable of learning com-
plex relationships between players and themes, be-
yond the capacity of ordinary SVM classifiers that
treat each classification label independently. E.g.,
if nobles play a role in a given Regest, it seems
more likely that it is about bestowal of land, rather
than e.g. justice, which presumably concerns other
groups equally. We compare two architectures: a
NN that builds on the output of independent binary
SVM classifiers, in addition to other information,
such as document vectors, in contrast to a full-
fledged Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

3.1 Preprocessing

Given the heterogeneous nature of the RI, we do
not perform major pre-processing of the data. The
Regests are only tokenized and converted to lower
case. Thereafter they are mapped to boolean and
tf-idf vectors of dimensions 2,000 and 10,000. The
value at index i of a boolean vector representing
document d encodes whether the term represented
by i appears in d (1) or not (0). Tf-idf is similar
but assumes that words that appear in many docu-
ments are less informative, and hence their respec-
tive vector-value is decreased7.

3.2 Using SVMs and S3VMs

SVMs are binary maximum-margin classifiers that
can be extended to the multi-label case by training
one SVM for each label. Semi-supervised SVMs
(S3VMs) work by forcing the hyperplane sepa-
rating the labeled data with margin also through
low density regions of space, making use of the
cluster hypothesis (Chapelle et al., 2008). S3VMs
have been shown to be very successful especially
when few labeled training data is available (Sind-
hwani and Keerthi, 2006). The downside is that

7More precisely, it is weighted by term frequency and the
logarithm of |D||Dw| , where |D| is the number of all documents
and |Dw| the number of documents in which w appears.

76



the S3VM’s optimization problem loses the global
optimality of the standard SVM problem.

In both approaches – SVM and S3VM – the as-
sumption is that labels do not influence each other.
I.e., if women play a role in a given Regest, it is not
less likely that it is also about war and peace.

3.3 Combining SVMs and NNs
To enable our classifiers to capture possible de-
pendencies between players and themes, we ex-
tend the SVM classifiers with a Neural Network,
realizing a meta-learning architecture. The NN
may learn that if groups x and y participate in a
Regest, some theme z is unlikely to occur, even if
predicted so by an independent binary classifier.

Figure 2: A Neural Network as a meta learner over
multiple binary classifier’s outputs, supplemented
with a paragraph vector over the document. The
figure is simplified to a multi-labeling task with
only 2 classifiers (in reality there are 12 SVMs).

After choosing the “best” SVMs for each label,
the outputs of the SVMs are fed into a Deep Neu-
ral Network (cf. Figure 2). We employ three input
settings: (a.) using SVM output labels only, (b.)
using SVM output labels and the document vec-
tors (the boolean variant), and (c.) the SVM out-
put labels jointly with Paragraph Vectors. Para-
graph Vectors are learned similar to word embed-
dings but represent sentences or documents. They
have been shown to yield strong performance in
classifying sentences, IMDB opinions and also in
Information Retrieval. As the Regests are short
documents, they are suitable for being represented
by these dense vectors, which are learned in an un-
supervised manner (Le and Mikolov, 2014).

3.4 Using Convolutional NNs
Recently, CNNs have been successfully applied
to various text and semantic sentence classifica-
tion tasks, and often achieved very good perfor-
mance (Kim, 2014; Zhang et al., 2015). Since

CNNs usually require large numbers (thousands
or more) of training samples to achieve very good
performance, it would come rather as a surprise if
trained on some few hundred samples, they would
generalize better on unseen data compared to a
mix of binary maximum-margin classifiers. We
included this setting to serve as a baseline on the
Neural NLP side and generated pre-trained word-
embeddings of two sizes using all Regests.

4 Experiments and Results

4.1 Experimental Setup
Training and Test Data. We manually labeled
500 Regests, randomly drawn from the corpus to
prevent bias.89 The data was split into a train-
ing and test section of 400 and 100 Regests. The
first two lines in Table 4 display the distribution of
players and themes in the annotated data. Some
of them occur rarely in both training and test data
(e.g. Jewish people (b4) with only 3% and 2% of
the respective data sets). On the other hand, nobles
play a role in over 70% of annotated Regests. For
estimation of model parameters we apply cross
validation (CV) on the training set. We proceed as
follows: (i) Parameter tuning of SVMs. For each
different vector size and representation scheme,
we tune the inner parameters of an SVM with CV
on the training data. (ii) Testing of SVMs. We re-
train each SVM on the full training data using the
chosen hyperparameters, and evaluate the model
on the test data set. (iii) Determining an indepen-
dent multi-label system. As input to the NN mod-
els as meta learners over SVM outputs, we deter-
mine an IMC (“Independent Margin Classifiers”),
a set of independent margin classifiers, consisting
of the 12 SVMs that achieve maximum training
CV score for each problem. (iv) Training NN mod-
els. For different NN models we again determine
hyperparameters with CV on the IMC-outputs for
the training section, and retrain the final NN mod-
els on the full training data, before (v), Testing of
the NNs is again done on the final test set.

Evaluation Metrics. Our evaluation needs to
take into account that many labels underlie a
skewed distribution (cf. Table 4). For example,

8One of the authors, with experience in history sciences,
annotated the data. In future work we plan to obtain compara-
ble annotations possibly with help of experts in online history
forums.

consider that one label only is positive among
100 test samples. A classifier that labels all in-
stances as negative yields a deceivingly high score
of 0.99 accuracy. Hence we employ Balanced Ac-
curacy, the mean of Recall (Sensitivity) and in-
verse Recall (Specificity10), defined as Accbal =
Sensitivity+Specificity

2 .
In the above example, where Accuracy yields

a biased score of almost one, balanced Accuracy
yields a more realistic value of 0.5. Given the un-
balanced distribution of our test data set, we report
balanced accuracy for each of the 12 binary prob-
lems. We also report their arithmetic mean Accbal
to provide a global measure of performance.

Baselines. As Baselines we choose, besides a
simple majority voter, a Multinomial Naive Bayes
algorithm, which is commonly used in text classi-
fication tasks (both in an independent binary man-
ner for each label). Table 3 shows that Naive
Bayes improves over the majority baseline for all
problems and yields a solid 0.67 Accbal, 0.17 pp.
above the majority voter.

IMC achieves 0.795 Accbal and significantly
outperforms both the majority baseline (+0.3
Accbal) and Naive Bayes (+0.13). For each prob-
lem the score is better with up to +0.47 Accbal for
recognizing women (b5) in a Regest. For lesser
nobles (b2) and war and peace (b11), the inde-
pendent classifiers combination baseline yields the
overall best results (0.62 and 0.79 Accbal).

4.2 Evaluation Results: In Depth Analysis
SVMs/S3VMs combined into the multi-labeler
(“IMC”, Table 3) achieve good performance
(0.795 Accbal). Based on the training CV scores,
IMC consists of six supervised SVMs and four
S3VMs. S3VMs in the IMC were chosen for prob-
lems b0, b1, b8 and b10. With respect to b2
and b11, IMC outperforms all NN approaches (b2:
+0.04, b11: +0.01). The Naive Bayes Baseline is
outperformed with +0.128 Accbal. This strong im-
provement could be due to the generalization ca-
pacity of the maximum margin, which might be
especially useful with small training set sizes.

With regard to representation schemes such as
boolean or tfidf and 2,000 words or 10,000 words,
we observe no clear patterns whether one works
generally better than the other on the RI. 5 classi-
fiers of IMC are trained on 10,000 words and 10
classifiers use boolean word-features.

10Specificity = TN
TN+FP

CNNs fed with 128 dimensional embeddings
outperform majority vote (+0.06 Accbal) but not
Naive Bayes (-0.11), most likely due to the low
amount of training data. Another explanation is
that the 129,504 Regests were not sufficient to pre-
train useful word-vectors (possibly also negatively
influenced by the word variety). As the vector
size increases (512 dimensions), the performance
drops further (+0.01 over the majority voter).

The remaining classifier models are intended to
detect dependencies between players and themes
and had access to the outputs of IMC. Specifi-
cally, the question is whether NNs are suitable
for detecting such dependencies. As baselines
we considered SVM and Decision Tree models,
trained on the outputs of the independent learn-
ers (in Table 3: +Decision Tree, +SVMs). Neither
copes specifically well with this input information
(-0.045 Accbal for +Decision Tree and -0.007 for
+SVMs). Even when supplied with more infor-
mation using various sizes of Paragraph Vectors
(omitted in Table 3), both systems do not improve
their previous scores.

Neural Networks employed as meta learners,
by contrast, are able to improve results for specific
problems, especially when supplied with Para-
graph Vectors, resulting in the overall best system
on test, a NN with 2048 hidden nodes and Para-
graph Vectors of dimension 512 (+NN2048+PV512,
Table 3). Still, the overall performance gain is
small with only +0.004 Accbal. When omitting b3
(lesser nobles) from the result calculation (it was
the most controversial class in the annotation), the
gain over IMC increases to +0.006. Notable indi-
vidual performance gains are achieved for b0 (no-
bles, +0.02), b6 (new privileges, +0.05) and be-
stowal of land (+0.02). We conclude that there are
dependencies between nobles, bestowal of land
and privileges which cannot be captured by con-
sidering these classes independently.

To analyze on which groups and themes the
neural network meta-learner offers significantly
differing predictions (“it disagrees with its input”),
we calculate mid-p-values with McNemars test
(Fagerland et al., 2013) between different systems
outputs (cf. Table 3). Comparing the best three
NNs among each other, the 1,200 single predic-
tions each system made do not differ significantly
(min. p = 0.065), however the opposite is true
when comparing the best three NNs to IMC (all
p-values < 0.05). This indicates that there is more

consensus about the label-predictions between dif-
ferent NN architectures than between the NNs and
IMC. On the binary problem level, the p-value for
theme 6, new privileges, lies below 0.05 for all
NN architectures with more than 512 hidden units.
For b8, land grants, all p-values are < 0.05 for ar-
chitectures with more than 128 hidden units. Ob-
servation of the predictions further suggests that
the NNs feel the most need to correct the SVMs
with b6 and b8 (with these the correction ends up
in better predictions) and b0, nobles. However,
in predicting nobles the difference is never sig-
nificant. For example, NN2048+PV512, the best
NN on the test set disagrees with the SVM on the
nobles-label in 11 of 100 cases. Here the NN is
correct only in 6 cases, making the difference non-
significant with p=0.77. With b8 on the other hand
there are 14 disagreements and 13 accurate correc-
tions, resulting in a p-value of 0.001 (b6: 6 cor-
rections, 6 accurate, p=0.016). Taking predictions
over all groups again (1,200 predictions), this NN
differs in 46 cases from the IMC choice and is cor-
rect 39 times (p < 0.0005). Why is the resulting
perfomance increase in Accbal only 0.2%? This
is due to the fact that the NN is more restrictive
in assigning labels than the independent learner

model: in all 129,504 Regests, it predicts 50,968
less positive labels than IMC. As positive labels
are strongly under-represented in the manually la-
beled data, the (non-weighted) Accbal measure is
much more influenced by an additional True Posi-
tive than a True Negative for a rare group or theme.

Paragraph Vectors (PV) used as input to the
NNs apparently contain more information than
standard (boolean) bag-of-word (BoW) vectors.
When the best NN is fed with BoW vectors in-
stead of PVs it achieves lower performance (-0.07
Accbal). To test whether Paragraph Vectors work
better simply in general, we trained 12 indepen-
dent SVM classifiers on PVs only, to predict play-
ers and themes. The result, for several dimen-
sions of Paragraph Vectors (between 64 and 2048)
fed into an SVM (best result: SVMs+PV128 in
Table 3), did not exceed the Naive Bayes base-
line, indicating strongly that PVs alone are infe-
rior to BoW vectors for standard textual classifi-
cation of the RI. Our explanation is as follows:
While Quoc Le (2014) achieved good results in
classifying sentiment of movie reviews with Para-
graph Vectors, he hypotheses that movie reviews
are tailor-cut for learning the vectors for this prob-
lem, because compositionality plays an important

79



role in deciding whether the review is positive or
negative. The RI are a more complex source and it
is debatable whether compositionality plays a role
with regard to co-occurring groups and themes.
Also, while movie reviews often contain similar
(sentiment) vocabulary, each Regest presents its
content in rather unique ways. The NN that learns
Paragraph Vectors is thus presented with very di-
verse information, most likely generating vectors
containing every and thus little information. We
conclude that using standard BoW vectors as first-
order information was the correct choice, while
PVs prove more suitable as higher-order informa-
tion for the NN acting as a meta-classifier (as they
add little but additional information).11

Players and themes that can be predicted with
great success by many systems on the test set are
confirmation of privileges (b7: 0.94), Jews (b4:
1.00) and women (b5: 0.98). By contrast, all sys-
tems fail to reliably predict class b2 (lesser no-
bles), which yields a maximum of 0.12 points be-
yond majority and no gains beyond Naive Bayes.
One explanation for this low performance is that
it was really hard (if not sometimes impossible) to
distinguish between non-nobles and nobles in the
annotation process. All other groups and themes
can be predicted with solid accuracy scores (≥
0.20 above majority, ≥ 0.02 above Naive Bayes,
and ≥ 0.62 Accbal per category in general).

The system +NN2048+PV512 perfoms best in
Accbal. We also analyze two additional criteria
of performance: (i) the Kullback-Leibler (KL) di-
vergence between distributions of labels in the
manually annotated data to the distributions of
labels automatically assigned to the full RI and
(ii), the KL divergence between the distributions
of amounts of labels (0-12 labels can be as-
signed to a Regest). For (i), the KL divergences
are KLtrain,test = 0.033 and KLtrain,RINN =
0.036, KLtrain,RIIMC = 0.058 indicating only a
small divergence between human and automatic
labeling by the NN w.r.t. the distributions of the
twelve groups and themes (cf. Table 4). In fact,
all of the best three NNs appear to have smaller
KL-divergencies than IMC. Also (ii), number of
group and theme labels that are assigned by hu-
man vs. automatic labeling, shows similar tenden-
cies: KLtrain,test = 0.02, KLtrain,RINN = 0.01,

11Note that this applies only to NNs as meta-learners: the
SVM-based meta-learner baseline performed below majority
baseline when supplied also with Paragraph Vectors (accbal
with additional Paragraph Vectors: 0.786, without: 0.788).

KLtrain,RIIMC = 0.07. On average, two labels
were assigned to a Regest by all labeling systems.
The human assigned 43% of the Regests two la-
bels, IMC 27% and the NN 34%.

In sum, our results indicate that NNs can learn
dependencies of labels from independent classifier
predictions. NNs are thus suitable to detect struc-
tures in the data that are intuitive for humans.

5 Deriving Structures of European
Medieval Times

We labeled all Regests with +NN2048 + PV512.
We eye-balled several annotations and found many
of the predicted classes to be correctly inferred12.

5.1 Feature Analysis

The learned weight vectors of the SVMs offer
interpretation of the terms w.r.t. the classified
groups and themes. Table 5 displays, for selected
classes, the phrases which were assigned the high-
est weights. Many of these intuitively make sense.
Indicator terms for War and Peace are “truppen”
(troops), “friedensverhandlungen” (peace talks)
and the preposition “gegen” (against), other terms
point geographically to the East: türken (turkish)
or konstantinopel (today: Istanbul).

From the analysis we conclude that the decision
to not normalize the texts was reasonable, given
that we find many high-weighted terms that are ab-
breviations, e.g., “urkk” (charter), “kgin” (queen)
or latin expressions: ‘ecclesia” (christian commu-
nity), “abbati” (father), “monasterii” (locative of
monastery) are indicators for spiritual institutions.

5.2 Investigating the Regesta Imperii

Using the automatically assigned labels for play-
ers and themes in the full set of 129,504 Regests,
we are able to investigate structures that emerge
between specific players and themes, with respect
to time or certain locations. In Figure 3 we trace
the development of the ratio of Regests which
were both about cities and privileges w.r.t. time.
Given that in some years no Regests are available,
the ratios are “smoothed” by calculating them over
bins of 25 years. The occurrence ratio is deter-
mined by Ratio(gt, b) = |Regestsb,gt||Regestsb| , where gt is
the set of groups and themes we want to “trace”
and b is one of the bins of 25 years. |Regestsb,gt|

Table 5: Highly weighted terms for groups and themes found in SVM classifiers. Some terms are
difficult to translate, but most terms intuitively make sense. For example: many terms for Jews relate to
financial taxes (“quittieren”–to receipt; “einnehmer”–collector). Other terms for this group are negatively
connotated: “frevel”–sacrilege, “verstoßen”–outcast. Jews in medieval times often were at most tolerated
and had to pay special taxes (above: “judensteuer”). For all themes and groups a large amount of the
heigh-weighted terms is in Latin, suggesting that it was a correct decision not to filter out Latin words.

is the number of Regests from time bin b which
are about all groups and themes contained in gt.

Not only can groups and themes be traced with
regard to time, but also to locations or/and to cer-
tain emperors. This is exemplified in Fig. 6 and 4
where we count the occurrences of all 12 themes
and groups with respect to these parameters and
normalize by the sum of all 12 occurrence counts.

6 Conclusions

We solved a multi-label text classification problem
to derive interesting demographic groups (e.g. cit-
izens) and themes of interactions (i.a. bestowal of
privileges or justice) in the Regesta Imperii.

Figure 6: Players and themes in Regests submitted
under the name of the German-Roman emperor
Friedrich I. (*1122, †1190) in different locations.
War and Peace played the greatest role in the Ital-
ian city Crema, which indeed was involved in war
during Friedrich’s regency and subjected 1160.

Evaluation on a held out test set suggests that
most groups and themes can be predicted with
good reliability: 9 out of 12 classes can be pre-
dicted with a (balanced) Accuracy score ≥ 0.75.
The arithmetic mean of all 12 scores – our global
performance measure – is 0.797 for the system that
was finally chosen to label the entire RI.

A Neural Network acting as a meta learner over
the outputs of independent maximum margin clas-
sifiers and Paragraph Vectors (document embed-
dings learned by neural networks) led to a minor
improvement of 0.2% mean score. However, for
the group nobles and the themes bestowal of land
and new privileges the scores were improved by
up to 3%, 4% and 5%, indicating dependencies
between these classes that cannot be captured by
classifiers working under the label-independence
assumption. We conclude that NNs can give ad-

Figure 4: Impact of groups and themes in the German city of Mainz with respect to emperors and time:
From Otto III. (crowned German-Roman King in 983) to Maximilan I. (crowned in 1486). The impact of
spiritual institutions (from Ruprecht III onwards) and women and land bestowals (both from Friedrich I.
onwards) seems to decrease. Finances seem to play a more important role in the later Middle Ages.

ditional information on possible dependencies be-
tween classes in a multi-label classification task.

Conceptually the approach is straightforward,
but a complicating factor is the exploding param-
eter space: Besides the “inner parameters” of the
Learners, regularization control or the number of
neurons in the Neural Network, there are numer-
ous “outer parameters”, e.g., possible ways of doc-
ument representation or pre-processing.

As best-performing system we determined a
NN model with additional Paragraph Vector infor-
mation. It obtained the best results on the test set
and also yields the minimum KL divergence for
the label distribution over manually labeled train-
ing data compared to system predictions. This
model was chosen to label all 129,504 Regests.

For the project Regesta Imperii and Digital Hu-
manities in general, our work offers the possibility
to trace demographic groups (players) and themes
through almost one thousand years of medieval
history across different European locations. We
showcased data analyses and visualizations. Man-
ifold other possibilities may be explored in future

work.
The Regesta Imperii in our opinion is a most

challenging and linguistically interesting corpus.
For historians, the RI is important as a funda-
mental source for medieval European studies. For
linguists the RI may be very interesting due to
its linguistic “uniqueness”: syntactic construc-
tions range from simple to most complex, the lan-
guages range from more modern German to dif-
ferent forms of medieval German to Latin. Great
varieties in word forms exist. Semantically, the
referenced objects and concepts are often confined
to short periods of time. Thus, the RI presents
challenges for researchers from many research
fields. The challenging language, the consider-
able amount of data and the many interesting ques-
tions of humanities regarding the medieval times
of Europe make the RI a great corpus for NLP re-
searchers with special interest in Humanities.
