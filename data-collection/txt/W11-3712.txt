Abstract
The repetition of names of persons, places,
ideas and events, is used sometimes for
emphasis. The same is true of the repe-
tition of affect words - repeated preferen-
tially to show negative/positive sentiment.
During an election campaign, this repeti-
tion may have a bearing on the electabil-
ity of politicians and on the reputation of
political parties. News media covering
an election may be involved in endorsing
political parties, attempting to set aspects
of election agenda, and may have gender
bias. Using Rocksteady, an affect anal-
ysis system, we have analyzed samples
of news published nationally and region-
ally by Irish media between 21st Decem-
ber 2010 and 20th Feb. 2011 - in the run
up to the Irish General Election on 25th

February 2011. Our results show that a
diachronic study of the coverage, based
on named-entity dictionary crafted from
electoral lists and with key financial and
economic terms added, supplemented by a
General Inquirer type dictionary of affect,
helped us to distinguish between the win-
ners (two opposition parties that have sub-
sequently formed a coalition government)
from the loser (the incumbent party).

1 Introduction

Literature on sentiment analysis is boldly going
where others will fear to tread: sentiment of large
populations within a community is being extracted
and aggregated by ’review mining, product rep-
utation analysis, multi-document summarization,
and multi-perspective question answering’(Riloff
et al., 2006). The fields covered are wide rang-
ing and include sentiment/opinion extraction from
film reviews (Namenwirth et al., 2002), from let-
ters to the Editors in major newspapers(Asher et

al, 2009), and from politically sensitive documents
in multiple languages (Ahmad, 2011).

There is burgeoning literature on the impact of
sentiment on financial markets(Daly et al., 2009),
where it has been shown that negative sentiment
reflects at one time has an impact on prices in the
markets subsequently(Tetlock, 2007). The extrac-
tion of sentiment in particular and affect in general
is a multi-faceted issue; aspects of affect-bearing
writing is based on the use of metaphors(Ahmad,
2011).

However, evaluation frameworks on the choice
of data, especially who wrote or spoke sentiment
bearing documents, are still evolving(Pang & Lee,
2008). As a result, studies on the impact of the
articulated affect in general, and sentiment in par-
ticular, are limited in the sentiment analysis litera-
ture.

The question of data source is important be-
cause of the multiple sources of bias that can be in-
troduced at the data production stage: particularly
when print/TV/digital news media is changing
rapidly with considerable reliance on social me-
dia and ’active news gathering’ in decline partly
because of commercial pressures(Krause, 2011).

Sentiment can be deliberately generated by
a news publisher who is keen on focussing a
discourse on charismatic personalities or certain
topics that will benefit those supported by the
publisher(Curtice, 1999;Druckman, 2005). It is
equally possible that a news publisher may be pan-
dering to the political, social and economic views
of a community to maximise financial gain from
selling advertisements in their print/offline publi-
cation(Gentzkow, Shapiro, 2010). The affect ar-
ticulated by an opinionated person or organisation
may be rooted in their racial and/or gender bias
-both articulated vividly in the 2008 US Presiden-
tial Elections(Parks et al., 2008). Such bias has
been defined by authors as “a deviation from the
informative media function, which may result in

80



a distorting effect on political attitudes and out-
come” (Brandenburg, 2005).

A large political science literature is dedicated
to such influence of the media on electoral out-
comes. One branch focuses on the possible impact
of newspapers endorsing a candidate or a political
party; this practice is common in the USA, the UK
and Canada.

Some scholars have argued that endorsements
have a weak impact on electoral outcomes. In
an influential study Erikson(1976) studied the im-
pact of 223 newspapers that were defined as lo-
cal to a given community voting patterns in 200
northern US counties found that while there was a
substantial change in endorsements patterns, this
did not translate into a significant change in votes
cast. Erikson has argued that the estimated effect
of ’presidential endorsements treatments’ is about
5% or so (Erikson, 1976, pp.215).

Curtice (1999) reports an experience similar to
that of Erikson’s when there was a ’break from ho-
mogenous media treatment’ in the United King-
dom. Curtice looked at 1,976 voters and asked
these voters to name the newspapers out of a sam-
ple of 10 papers they read, The author’s analysis
suggests that the change or otherwise in the voting
intentions of his subjects suggests that whilst ’par-
tisan press does have some influence on the way
in which their readers vote’, it is not clear that the
imbalance between readership of pro-party news-
papers (Conservative vs Labour) ’over any period
of time tends to be small if evident at all’ Curtice,
1999:28).

Contrary to Erikson and Curtis, some recent
studies that account for credibility of the source of
an endorsement, suggest that newspaper endorse-
ments may have a direct effect on voter choice.
Voters are more likely to endorse the candidate
of publication but only where the endorsement is
credible. For example, endorsements for Demo-
cratic candidates from left-leaning newspapers ex-
ert less influence that those from neutral or right-
leaning newspapers(Chiang & Knight, 2011).

In order to account for the various biases of
the various humans and organisations involved in
the supply of data used in sentiment analysis, and
in the subsequent evaluation of such systems, we
draw upon studies in political science, and polit-
ical and media communications, specifically, the
techniques used in the study of general elections
where media affect and sentiment and its impact

on the outcome of the elections, is the focus. We
examine newspaper content for word frequencies
that can generate ’bias’ in coverage of parties, gen-
der and party agendas in the run-up to the Irish
general election 2011. While our study does not
draw a causal relationship between bias and elec-
toral outcome, it clearly demonstrates that senti-
ment analysis must factor in context and bias anal-
ysis in order to support a broad field of impact
studies.

2 Media Bias and Perceptions

In this section we present the various types of bias
which are the focus of empirical investigation in
the literature of political science and political com-
munications. We specifically look at endorsement,
coverage, agenda and gender.

2.1 Types of Bias and Perceptions

Endorsement: There are different levels of politi-
cal description when we attempt to discern the im-
pact of media on the outcomes of elections. First,
a meta-level political description where we might
look at the attitude of publishers towards a politi-
cal party or party leader as articulated directly in
an endorsement during the course of an election
campaign. The most common empirical finding is
that the impact to be minimal except when a ma-
jor change on the political scene also takes place -
especially the vote against a government that has
been in power for a long period.

This is suggested by frequency data on endorse-
ments during the electoral campaigns in the USA
(2004, 2008), the UK (2005, 2010) and Canada
(2006, 2008, 2011). In the USA and the UK, there
was a change in the government after the elections
in 2008 and 2010 respectively; in both cases the
incumbent parties were in power for over 8 years.
The switch over by newspapers supporting the in-
cumbent over to the opposition that goes on to win
the election: In the USA, during the 2008 Demo-
cratic Party was endorsed by 70% of the newspa-
pers and won the same percentage of votes: the
’swing’ in endorsement was 18% and in votes cast
it was 16%. The situation in the UK is similar but
differs in a crucial detail: The endorsements for
the ruling Labour Party dropped by over 40% in
2010 when compared with the 60% endorsements
in the previous elections held in 2005: the drop in
Labour’s vote was 6% and the opposition Conser-
vative gained 4% in the 2010 elections. The Cana-

81



dian election cycle shows no discernible effect of
newspaper endorsement over the last 3 elections:
the Conservatives have had an average of 70% en-
dorsement but their share of the vote of the seats
in parliament is still just above 50%. The overall
message of our observations of the elections in the
three countries is that endorsements may have an
impact and this is perhaps more pronounced when
a change in government is imminent (see Table 1
for details).

It appears that newspapers have a greater impact
than TV news broadcast in some cases. This may
be due to a number of reasons and here are some
reasons that have been reported recently: (a) Panel
studies suggest that only 2 in 100 news viewers
pay much attention to the news about presiden-
tial elections and, in any case, news about elec-
tions makes up less than 10% of TV news out-
put(Gentzkow, Shapiro, 2010); but there is some
evidence that political advertising on the TV can
persuade parts of a populace in exceptional cir-
cumstances(Beltrn, 2007). (b) Voters typically fol-
low trusted news sources - so the modality of the
medium, visual or linguistic, may not be an is-
sue(Miller & Krosnick, 2000). (c) Partisan cov-
erage, as in Fox News, has an impact in that
this coverage tends to nudge the voter away from
their original choice of party/candidate; contrarily,
some scholars have suggested that ’opinionated
news is no more likely to contribute to partisan po-
larisation than non-opinionated news’ (Feldman,
2011:pp178). (d) Politicians on the periphery of
the mainstream political systems, depend as much
on TV news and interviews as on coverage in the
newspapers (Bos et al. , 2011). (e) The cover-
age of a candidate is usually positive if the can-
didate discusses issues that relate to his or her
party(Hayes, 2008). (f) Both the committed vot-
ers and the undecided voters can be influenced by
the positive coverage of a party in the media, and
the undecideds are influenced more(Hopmann et
al., 2010).

Gender: In an experimental study, neuro-
psychologists(Chiao, et al., 2008) confirmed that
gender affects how people perceive and evaluate
facial appearance(Keating, 1985) in the context of
an election(Little et al., 2006). Gender bias in the
media can also perversely serve as an advantage
for incumbent female politicians especially in the
US House of Representatives(Milyo & Schosberg,
2000). Female incumbents have been shown to be

of higher average quality than their male counter-
parts and this quality is perhaps underestimated by
male opponents in an election. The higher quality
of the female incumbent, however, may be due to
the ’barriers to entry’ that women face in joining
political institutions. Some early analysis of the
2008 US Presidential election, where race (Presi-
dent Obama’s ethnicity) and gender (Senator Clin-
ton’s female persona), there is good news to be had
in that it appears that US voters are moving away
from their stereotypical images of both women
and people of colour(Miller & Krosnick, 2000).

2.2 Bias in the Irish Context

Returning to the Irish context with which
this study is concerned, Brandenburg(2005) has
looked at the media coverage Irish General Elec-
tion of 2002. He studied three biases in the cover-
age by 4 newspapers and two TV stations namely:
first, coverage of political parties; second, the bias
shown by the coverage of a given party’s actual
or contrived expertise in a policy area; and third,
the judgemental or evaluative tone of the coverage
expressed in terms of positive or negative state-
ments made by a newspaper about individual polit-
ical parties. Brandenburg analysed 220,180 lines
of text and the lines were coded along 12 policy
dimensions and five campaign dimensions. He
also included the location of the text - whether
the text appeared in the editorial columns, on the
front page, as a photo caption or in a cartoon.
Brandenburg’s analysis shows that coverage was
higher for incumbent parties and lower for the op-
position. Coverage was proportional to the elec-
tion results of 2002 and very similar to the cam-
paign poll average of the parties involved. Of the
5 major parties in the election, the agenda of only
three parties (Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour)
’find a certain degree of reflection in the media
coverage’ (Brandenburg, 2005 pp310). The au-
thor concludes by noting that whilst the Irish pa-
pers were not as openly partisan about a political
party yet the papers were ’prone to various forms
of bias’(Brandenburg, 2005 pp 318). Specifically,
he finds a homogenous anti-politics bias.

Gender bias in the media and its impact on elec-
toral outcome has not been extensively studied in
the Irish context. An initial study demonstrates
that in the 2002 general election, candidate gender
was not a factor affecting voter choice(McElroy
& Marsh, 2010). However, by 2011 gender had

become a salient political issue with a discourse
emerging on quotas for women candidates, partic-
ularly by such civil society organisations as 50:50
(50:50 civil society group, ). Most parties in large
constituencies aimed to increase their percentage
of female candidates. We are then concerned with
gender balanced coverage to the extent that it was
a popular discourse during the election campaign.
Specifically, we ask, to what extent was this new
discourse on gender reflected in the frequency by
which women candidates were referenced in the
newspaper medium.

3 Method and Data

Our data for this study is derived from newspaper
content.

We focus on samples of news published nation-
ally and regionally by Irish newspapers between
21st December 2010 and 20th February 2011 -
in the run up of the 2011 Irish General Election
on 21st February 2011. We set out to investigate
the presence of three biases: gender; agenda; and
party coverage. We also run an analysis of gen-
eral affect specifically focused on well-being and
power.

The data was extracted using the news aggrega-
tor LexisNexis which allows access to news media
across Ireland: this data, part of LexisNexis data
deluge, has to be curated(Witt et al., 2009). The
news is organised in a time series and the con-
tent analysed automatically by an affect analysis

system Rocksteady developed at Trinity College,
Dublin, Ireland.

3.1 Data Curation

Criteria A strict search criterion for news data
was implemented whereby only articles from Irish
publications would be selected and must contain
the terms Ireland and Politics, or Ireland and Elec-
tions(s) within the headline or opening paragraph.

Media concentration There are 59 titles that
are published in Ireland including 6 published in
Northern Ireland with total circulation of 1.56 mil-
lion copies. There are 29 publishers in total and
one publisher (Independent Publishing) owns 17
titles with a total audited circulation of 652,000
copies including the highest circulation Irish In-
dependent (138,00 copies). There are 23 publisher
with only one title including the 2nd highest circu-
lation Irish Times (102,000 copies) and the Irish
Examiner (46,000 copies). Sunday newspapers
account for 1/3 of all copies in circulation.

Collection Data was retrieved using the Lexis-
Nexis online repository which allows for searches
for a wide number of sources based on the crite-
ria laid out above. An initial corpus of 3,024 ar-
ticles was created covering the time period of 55
days between 21 Dec 2010 and 20 Feb 2011 with
a total of 41 sources: 11 nationwide, including
the Irish state TV network RTE, and 30 regional
newspapers . LexisNexis provides the ability to
batch download articles into a single file compris-

83



ing 500 of the returned news items. Once collected
data may be sanitised and organised in a consistent
manner.

Sanitisation Once data has been collected it is
important that any meta data included within the
text be removed as it would alter the total word
count within the article and provide erroneous re-
sults. When dealing with news data a key issue is
that of reprints; reprints may occur whereby a re-
gional newspaper re-releases the same item from
a national paper or may be due to minor modifica-
tions of corrections of the news item, news items
may also be expanded over the course of the day.
We have developed a system for the identification
and possible deletion of duplicate items within a
news collection.

The Levenshtein distance algorithm provides a
metric of the differences between two texts rep-
resenting the number of alterations required to
change one to the other. While intended for
small strings the method may be scaled to exam-
ine larger texts. We have found there is as much as
35% of the texts may be duplicated leaving a bal-
ance of 65% texts that do not substantially overlap.

3.2 Data Analysis

The Rocksteady system uses a combination of gen-
eral purpose affect dictionaries, like Stone’s Gen-
eral Inquirer Dictionary, and an optional domain
specific dictionary. The Irish general election dic-
tionary contained candidate names as terms with
party affiliation, constituency, party role, qual-
ifications and gender as categories. This re-
sulted in a dictionary with 517 terms and 39 cat-
egories. The names of the candidates, party af-
filiation and constituency where retrieved from
www.electionsireland.org.

For general affect analysis we focussed on eval-
uation (positive/negative), a deference category,
words related to power, and one welfare category,
well-being. (See Table 2):

We have used a frequency count approach and
we have not used special purpose algorithms for
identifying variants of a proper noun or attempted
to resolve pronominal references. Our frequency
count focuses on single and compound words and
a dictionary look-up informs which of the many
categories the words belong to. The categories
include: affect (negative/positive, strong/weak);
domain specific-categories (election vocabulary,
Irish place names that are used as labels for con-

and official status. The results are then aggregated
over a chosen time period, weekly in our case for
instance .

4 Results

4.1 Coverage: Leaders and Parties

The citations for all leaders shows an increase
between week beginning December 27th 2010
through to the week beginning February 14th

2011, with some notable changes in the trend. The
citations to the leaders (and parties) is partially in-
flated for Micheál Martin and his party. During
the period of study the ruling FF had leadership
election which unseated the party leader (Mr Brian
Cowen) and Mr Martin was elected after a three-
week contest ending on 26th January 2011 - after
which his citations and that of his party declined
and his party lost the elections to the two oppo-
sition leaders (Kenny and Gilmore) (See Figure 1
)

Our analysis of citation parties for the parties
and leaders shows a good correlation with the re-
sults of the 2011 General Election as measured
in terms of the first preference votes. The cita-
tion patterns in our newspaper corpus shows a pro-
gressive better correlation with the first preference
votes (FPV) cast over a 7 week period (see Table
3). The FPV appear to be a good measure of real
public opinion. There are a number of changes
in the correlation between citations to the political
parties, including the citations to the independents
and minor parties, and the FPV. These changes re-
late to the leadership challenge within the party of
the government (Fianna Fáil) and its outcome - re-
ducing the correlation well below 50%. However,
once the ’honeymoon’ period of the new leader is
over three weeks before the election , we see that

4.2 Even handed Coverage?

The discussion in section 2 suggests that news me-
dia shows preference for one particular party - in-
deed Brandenburg(2005) noted that this was the
case in the Irish elections in 2002. The party of
government, Fianna Fáil (FF), is given greater

coverage by all the news papers, the main oppo-
sition parties (Fine Gael and Labour) are collec-
tively given greater coverage than is the case for
FF, but individually the two parties receive less
than 2/3rd of the citations for FF (Figure 2 ).

4.3 Agenda Coverage

The 2011 election was followed by a high level
visit from the International Monetary Fund and
the European Central Bank (ECB) for restructur-
ing the Irish government debt. The severest eco-
nomic downturn meant that economic terms dom-
inated the discussion in the newspaper. The ECB
organised the so-called bail out and can be seen to
dominate the discussion (Figure 3)

4.4 Gender

There where 517 candidates contesting the elec-
tion, 448 male candidates and 69 female can-
didates. The ratio of male to female contes-
tants (6.45), does not generally correspond to the
amount of coverage given to male or female can-
didates - on average male candidates are referred
to 8 times more than the women; the best ratio
for women-to-men citations is 6.3 and the worst is
10.7 (See Figure 4) These results are not surpris-
ing. Due to the high-stakes nature of the election,
new female candidates were unlikely to achieve
much press in comparison with issue coverage. As
dominant players in the parties are male and these
dominate issue coverage, a future study will test
whether male and female new candidates were al-
located equal coverage.

4.5 Sentiment, Power and Well being change

Finally, the 2011 election in Ireland was held in
the backdrop of the worst economic crisis in the
Republic’s history and the incumbent parties’ eco-
nomic wherewithal was under serious criticism.
The atmosphere was quite gloomy and the news-
media carried substantial amount of negative sen-
timent. We noted a higher positive sentiment
which remained constant throughout the campaign
- however, positive sentiment has usually little im-
pact as the analysis of financial markets suggests
(Daly et al., 2009;Tetlock, 2007). The variation of
power words is mild and shows a slight rise in the
period when the Fianna Fáil party had its internal
election. The distribution of well being words also
remained static with a small decline towards the
end of the campaign.

5 Afterword

We have described the work undertaken in politi-
cal science, political and media communication to
show how sentiment analysis is conducted in real
world. The impact of sentiment can be seen in the
results of political processes such as elections.

That affect of certain sentiment, activity and ori-
entation can be deliberately introduced has been
noted especially in the context of the concentra-
tion of media ownership. Media does tend to set
up or influence political agenda and this can dis-
tort the reporting of the mood and attitude of the
populace in the elections.

We have described how a large sample of news-
paper output (43 of the 59 publications within Ire-
land) collated over two months of an election can
be analysed using well known methods used in po-

86

litical opinion analysis. This sample has captured
key issues -economic downturn- and has shown
that a diachronic generated by the Rocksteady sys-
tems was closer to the final observed reality that
is the election of Fine Gael and the Labour Party.
The gender chasm was there for anybody to see:
not only did fewer women contested the election
they did not even receive the coverage proportion-
ate to their numbers contesting the election.

We are in the process of analysing sentiment ex-
pressed about individual parties and their leaders
and conducting a multivariate analysis to validate
the descriptive analysis we have presented in this
paper. We also intend to look at the results of sani-
tisation and measure what the impact of deleting
duplicate items will be.
