ABSTRACT 

The Mental Lexicon (ML) refers to the organization of lexical entries of a language in the human 

mind.A clear knowledge of the structure of ML will help us to understand how the human brain 

processes language. The knowledge of semantic association among the words in ML is essential 

to many applications. Although, there are works on the representation of lexical entries based on 

their semantic association in the form of a lexicon in English and other languages, such works of 

Bangla is in a nascent stage. In this paper, we have proposed a distinct lexical organization based 

on semantic association between Bangla words which can be accessed efficiently by different 

applications. We have developed a novel approach of measuring the semantic similarity between 

words and verified it against user study. Further, a GUI has been designed for easy and efficient 

access.  

KEYWORDS : Bangla Lexicon, Synset, Semantic Similarity, Hierarchical Graph 

1 Introduction 

The lexicon of a language is a collection of lexical entries consisting of information regarding 

words and expressions, comprising both form and meaning (Levelt,). Form refers to the 

orthography, phonology and morphology of the lexical item and Meaning refers to its syntactic 

and semantic information. 

The term Mental Lexicon refers to the organization and interaction of lexical entries of a 

language in the human mind. Depending on the definition of word, an adult knows and uses 

around 40000 to 150000 words. Yet, it has been estimated that an adult can recognize a word in 

her native language in less than 200ms and can reject a non-word in less than 500ms (Aitchison, 

2012; Muller, 2008; Seashore and Eckerson, 1940). Therefore, the storage and retrieval 

mechanisms of the brain have to be efficient enough to facilitate such super-fast access. Words in 

the mental lexicon are assumed to be associated at various levels of linguistic features such as, 

orthography, phonology, morphology and semantics. Although a vast amount of research is going 

on the mental lexicon, the precise natures of the relations are yet to be explored. The knowledge 

of semantic association among the words in mental lexicon is essential to many areas such as, 

developing pedagogical strategies, categorization, semantic web, natural language processing 

applications like, document clustering, word sense disambiguation, machine translation, 

information retrieval, text comprehension, and question-answering systems, where the perception 

of the target user group plays an important role.. However, as we cannot ‘look into the mind’ to 

know the exact structure of the mental lexicon, we try to simulate its behaviour with the help of 

external models. 

The rich repertoire of literature on the structure, organization and representation of lexical entries 

includes simple organization schemes like Dictionary and Thesaurus to more complex ones like 

171



WordNet (Fellbaum, 2010) and ConceptNet (Liu and Singh, 2004) and also methods to 

measurethe degree of semantic similarity among the lexemes. 

Bangla is an Indo-Aryan language having about 193 million native and about 230 million total 

speakers. Despite being so popular, very few attempts have (Roy and Muqtadir, 2008; Das and 

Bandyopadhyay, 2010) been made to build a semantically organized lexicon of substantial size in 

Bangla. Hence, we propose a distinct lexical organization. 

The objective of this work is to design and develop a Bangla lexicon based on semantic similarity 

among Bangla words, which is suitable of automatic access mechanismsand can be used further 

in various applications like as mentioned above. The design is based on the Samsad 

Samarthasabdokosh (Mukhopadhyay, 2005). The lexicon is hierarchically organized and divided 

according to the categories or domains represented by different segments. The categories are 

further divided into sub-categories. The words are grouped into clusters along with their 

synonyms. Weighted edges between different types of words related to same or different 

concepts or categories exist, denoting the semantic distance between them. We have also 

developed a Graphical User Interface on top of the lexicon, which can be used for efficient and 

easy access.  This is an on-going project with an aim of creating an organization containing 

50,000 words. 

The organization of the paper is as follows: section 2 contains the related works; we have also 

pointed out some of the differences of our proposed structure with WordNet in section 2; section 

3 explains the construction of the lexicon and the GUI; section 4, describes the proposed 

approach of predicting semantic similarity between words; in section 5 we have discussed the 

user study; conclusions and future thoughts have been included in the last section. 

2 Related work 

A number of works have been done semantic relation based representations include simple 

organizational schemes like Dictionary and Thesaurus to more complex ones like WordNet 

(Fellbaum, 2010) and ConceptNet (Liu and Singh, 2004) and others (Ruppenhofer et al., 

2010).Words in WordNet are organized around semantic groupings called synsets. Each synset 

consists of a list of synonymous word forms and semantic pointers that describe relationships 

among the synsets.However, WordNet suffers from several limitations(Boyd-Graber et al., 

2006).ConceptNet is a semantic network containing different types of concepts and relationships 

among them. Here, concepts are represented by words or short phrases and relationships can be 

of many kinds such as, MotivatedByGoal, UsedFor, can cross.  

According to the most recent reference to a Bangla WordNet (Roy and Muqtadir, 2008), the 

structure is based on Bangla to English bi-lingual dictionaries and in strict alignment (only the 

synonym equivalents are used) with the Princeton WordNet for English. It contains around 639 

synsets and 1,455 words
1
. The assumptions that have been taken are: Bangla and English have 

significant amount of linguistic similarities and Bangla word senses can be clearly justified by a 

Bangla-English-Bangla dictionary.  

Our proposed lexical representation is different from WordNet in many respects. Some of the 

important differences being:

• No cross parts of speech links are there in the WordNet. That means no link between an 
entity and its attributes.  

• Several lexical and semantic relations are not included in the WordNet such as 
"actor"([book]-[writer]), "instrument"([knife]-[cut]), but these are perceived as related 

by human cognition. In our framework these types of relations are, for example under 

the node [book], [writer] is there in [noun-adjective] type of cluster. [Knife], [cut] are 

also under same node [weapon] but in different clusters. These kinds of relations can be 

helpful in word sense disambiguation applications. 

• Relational links are qualitative rather than quantitative in WordNet.. In our system we 
have given weight on different type of links keeping in mind the semantic closeness of 

the nodes they connect. Moreover, in our structure, there exists a path between each 

possible word pair. 

Our proposed semantic similarity based lexical organization is not a substitution of WordNet; 

rather it tries to address some of the aspects which are still not incorporated in the WordNet 

framework. It is useful especially in case of a resource poor language like Bangla. 

2.1 Work on measuring semantic similarity among words 

There exist many approaches to measure semantic similarity between words; some of them are 

discussed here. Tversky’s feature based similarity model (Tversky, 1977), is among the early 

works in this field. Some scholars (Rada et al., 1989; Kim and Kim, 1990; Lee et al., 1993) have 

proposed the conceptual distance approach that uses edge weights, between adjacent nodes in a 

graph as an estimator of semantic similarity. Resnick (Resnik, 1993a; Resnik, 1993b) have 

proposed the information theoretic approach to measure semantic similarity between two words. 

Richardson et. al. (1994) has proposed an edge-weight based scheme for Hierarchical Conceptual 

Graphs (HCG) to measure semantic similarity between words. Efforts (Jiang and Conrath, 1997) 

have been made to combine both the information content based approach and the graph based 

approach of predicting semantic similarity. In addition, strategies of using multiple information 

sources to collect semantic information have also been adopted (Li et al., 2003). Wang and Hirst 

(2011) have criticized the traditional notions of the depth and density in a lexical taxonomy. 

However, almost all of the attempts described above have been taken in English based on the 

representation of WordNet. Das and Bandopadhaya (2010) have proposed a SemanticNet in 

Bangla, where the relations are based on human pragmatics. 

3 Construction of the Proposed Lexicon 

We have taken the Samsad Samarthasabdokoshby Ashok Mukhopadhyay(2005) as the basis for 

our proposed lexical representation in Bangla. The book contains 757 main words distributed in 

30 different sections. Each section addresses a particular domain such as universe-nature-earth, 

life-living being-body etc. The main words have their corresponding synonyms and similar or 

related words. Different groups of words that are associated with a single main word are 

organized together. Relevant information such as Part-Of-Speech (POS) corresponding to every 

word and antonyms for adjectives are also mentioned.  Two types of cross-references are present: 

one relates two main words or a single word which is simultaneously synonymous to two 

different main words and the other denotes multiple occurrences of the same. We have termed 

them as primary link and secondary link respectively. We have also analysed Bangla corpuses:

Mysore and Anandabazar 

news corpus
4
 and have prepared a list of around 4 lakh distinct words in Bangla with their corpus 

frequencies.  

In order to build-up a semantic relation based lexical representation Bangla; we have constructed 

a hierarchical conceptual graph based on the above mentioned book. We have also individually 

processed and stored the distinct general words in the book along with their respective details. 

Our storage and organization of the database facilitate computational processing of the 

information and efficient searching to retrieve the details associated with any word. Therefore, it 

will be a useful resource and tool to other psycholinguistic and NLP studies in Bangla. Given a 

word, its frequency over the five mentioned corpuses, its association with different categories or 

sub-categories are collected at a single place so that a user can navigate through the storages with 

low cognitive load. We have also rated the various types of connections among different levels of 

the graph and developed a mechanism for predicting semantic similarity measures between words 

in the proposed lexicon. It supports queries like DETAILS(X) (here X can be any type of node of 

the hierarchy) and SIMILARITY (WORD1, WORD2). The details of the organizational 

methodology are described below. 

The 30 different sections have been considered as 30 root categories. Each category is a 

collection of concepts, e.g. ����-����	 �
/sense-perception. 757 main words have been organized 

under the root categories as sub-categories, which are actually concepts, e.g. ��/smell.The words 

(mainly nouns, adjectives, verbal nouns and verbal adjectives) have been distributed into separate 

clusters attached to the sub-categories and they form the leaves of the hierarchy. There is a 

common root node as antecedent to all the categories. Corresponding to each sub-category, there 

are two types of clusters: one contains the exact synonyms and the clusters of the other type 

contain related words or attributes. The words belonging to the same cluster are synonymous. 

Every category, sub-category and cluster has distinct identification numbers.

universe cluster id 1.1.1 as it belongs to the synonym cluster of 1.1. The member relations of 

words with their clusters have been shown in dashed lines and the round dotted line and the 

compound line indicate primary link and secondary link respectively. 

FIGURE 2-Simplified view of the underlying storage structure 

Every word has been assigned an information array with 15 fields. They are: 

• Serial_no: denotes the serial number of a word in the database 
• Part-Of-Speech (POS) 
• Corpus frequency 
• Cluster_number: number of  the cluster of the word 
• SC_no.: number of the sub-category under which the word belongs 
• SSC_no: number of the sub-sub-category of a word (applicable to few words) 
• C_id: number of the category under which the word resides 
• P_link: pointer to the cluster id under the sub-category specified by the primary link 
• S_link: pointer to the cluster id under the sub-category specified by the secondary link 
• Antonym: cluster id of the antonym(s) of the word 
• Myth: a flag to indicate any mythical relation to the word 
• Details: Serial no. of all the words in the collection denoted by the present word (if it is 

a collective noun) 

• G_word: a pointer to the general word denoting the collection in which the present word 
belongs 

• Verb: a flag to indicate whether the word can be also used as a verb or not. 
• To_verb: contains the word which can be appended to the present word to make it 

possible to be used as a verb. 

The fields from 1 to 4 and 5 are available for every word; rests of the fields have values, if 

available or they have been assigned null.  Words belonging to multiple clusters have more than 

one 14-field information vector associated with them. Refer to the examples below for details:

3.1 Graphical User Interface 

We have also developed a Graphical User Interface based on the lexical representation described 

above. It can perform two jobs. First, it can be used to find the details about a particular word or 

category present in the database. A user can provide input in two different ways: directly typing 

the word or selecting from the list of words of different parts of speeches. For the ease of typing 

Bangla, we have also provided a Bangla virtual keyboard associated with the GUI. Given a word, 

the system outputs all the available fields associated with the word. It also provides the name and 

link of the corresponding sub-category and category so that the user can view details about just 

by clicking on them. If a word belongs to more than one cluster or part-of speech, the GUI shows 

all the associated clusters and sub-concepts, concepts. User can also navigate to the sub-

concept(s) associated by primary link or secondary link with the help of the GUI. Second, given 

two words as input the GUI also calculates the degree of semantic similarity between them along 

with their corresponding positions in the lexical representation. The method of obtaining the 

semantic similarity or relatedness measure has been described in the next section. 

4 Semantic Similarity Measure between Bangla Words 

As we have discussed in the above sections, along with relating words semantically, the mental 

lexicon also assigns a degree of similarity between them. Here, we have proposed a simple graph 

based semantic similarity measure on our proposed lexicon. We have also verified it with user 

feedbacks. In our proposed lexicon, the nodes from the top to bottom represent generalized to 

more specialized concepts. Therefore, the semantic distance or edge weights decrease as one 

moves down the hierarchy. There are 8 types of direct link in the organization: 

176



Sr. 

No. 
Type of link 

Link weight ( c is a 

constant whose value can 

be adjusted according to 

the need) 

1. member relation: between a word and its cluster  

2. between a cluster and its sub-category 
 

3. between a cluster and its sub-sub-category (if present) 
 

4.  
is-a relation: between a sub-sub-category and its sub-

category (if present)  

5. is-a relation: between a sub-category and its root category. 
 

6. between a category and the root. 
 

7. 

primary_link: between a word and a sub-category 

(according to the representation, this distance is greater 

than a member relation but lesser than the total path length 

between word and its sub-category) 
 

8. 

secondary_link: between a word and a sub-category (this 

distance is greater than the distance between a sub-

category and its category)  

TABLE 2- Edge-weight distributions 

We have assumed that the all the nodes at a particular level are equal in weight. The semantic 

distance between any pair of words is measured by the shortest path distance between 

them:  

….. (1) 

Here,  is a constant signifying the scale of measurement. We have taken  

and , so that a pair of synonyms has a score of 10 out of 10.Therefore, from table 2and 

equation (1), the semantic similarity values between different types of word pairs are as shown in 

table 3. 

In order to verify whether the proposed approach to measure semantic similarity or relatedness 

between a pair of words can actually represent the degree of similarity as perceived by human 

cognition, we have carried out a user survey. The details of the study have been described in the 

next section.

TABLE 3-Similarity scores 

5 User Study 

Participants: 25 native speakers of Bangla participated in the experiment with age between 23 

years to 36 years. All of them hold a graduate degree in their respective fields and 10 have a post 

graduate degree. 

Experiment data selection and procedure: 50 word pairs were selected from the lexical 

representation. The word pairs were chosen from the six different categories of relations 

described in table 4 above, except antonyms. Each user was asked to assign a score from 1 to 10 

to each of the 50 word pairs based on their degree of semantic relatedness: 1 for the lowest or no 

connectivity and 10 for the highest connectivity or synonyms. 

5.1 Result and Discussions 

Perceiving semantic similarity or relatedness between a pair of words or concepts denoted by 

them depends on the cognitive skill, domain or language knowledge and background of the user. 

Corresponding to each of the six types of words taken for user study, we have calculated both 

median and mean of user ratings. Mean has been used because of its popularity and common use, 

but as mean is very sensitive to outlier or extreme values median has also been taken into 

account. The table 4 below shows the outcomes of the user validation: 

178



 

Category 1 2 3 4 5 6 

Median_user rating 8.5 6 3.59 1 7 5.5 

Mean_user rating 8.6 5.89 2.38 1.25 6.34 4.94 

Predicted similarity score 10 6.25 3.57 2.5 6.45 5.26 

TABLE 4-User score versus predicted score 

The figure 3 below demonstrates the results graphically, it can be easily seen that the user ratings 

and our proposed measure are very close to each other. One interesting point to be noted here is 

that the overall mean and median of user ratings for category 1 is less than 10. This means 

synonyms are not always perceived as exactly similar to each other. Spearman’s rank correlation
5
  

of the predicted semantic similarity measure with the median values of user scores corresponding 

to each of the 50 word pairs is 0.8. To depict the subjectivity of user’s perception, we have 

plotted the median values against our proposed scores (refer to figure 4).

Figure 4 shows few outliers in the dataset that have median values far from the group mean and 

median (type 1). Another type (type 2) of word pair is of interest as they have significant 

difference (greater than 1) between mean and median values, which implies that user ratings 

contain some extreme values. The pairs belonging to each type are:

TABLE 5- List of type 1 and type 2 words. “C” implies Category. 

As can be seen from the above table, word-pairs like ( ����—���
�) demands a certain level of 

knowledge about the mythology to be perceived as synonyms, therefore, the user scores 

corresponding to this kind of word pairs also vary from person to person. Again, the similarity for 

the word pairs ()�*�+/planetary system—5"60,���/solar system) and (�� �-*�/farm land–

3"�/crops) depend on how a user connects the two concepts in her cognition. The type 1 word 

pairs such as (�9
�/naked—���:/undressed) (�!�����2/hail–�03�4�/snowfall) and 

("�3�./success—�.��
/fame) have been marked as synonyms or highly similar by the users. 

These phenomena demonstrate the confusion in distinguishing synonyms and very closely related 

concepts or words, especially those which are used alternatively in frequent situations. Three 

pairs belong to both types signifying they have been perceived as very close by most of the users 

and at the same time have got extreme values from the rest. 

Conclusion and perspective 

In this paper, we have proposed a hierarchically organized semantic lexicon in Bangla and also a 

graph based edge-weighting approach to measure the semantic similarity between two words. 

The similarity measures have been verified using user studies. We have included the frequency of 

each word over five Bangla corpuses in our lexical structure and also working on associating 

more details to words such as, their pronunciations, distribution in spoken corpus, word 

frequency history over time etc. Our proposed lexical structure contains only relations based on 

semantic association; we plan to extend the work to incorporate other kinds of relationships such 

as orthography, phonology and morphology to represent the human cognition more accurately.
