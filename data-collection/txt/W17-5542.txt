Abstract

We demonstrate an information navigation
system for sightseeing domains that has a
dialogue interface for discovering user in-
terests for tourist activities. The system
discovers interests of a user with focus de-
tection on user utterances, and proactively
presents related information to the discov-
ered user interest. A partially observable
Markov decision process (POMDP)-based
dialogue manager, which is extended with
user focus states, controls the behavior of
the system to provide information with
several dialogue acts for providing infor-
mation. We transferred the belief-update
function and the policy of the manager
from other system trained on a di↵erent
domain to show the generality of defined
dialogue acts for our information naviga-
tion system.

1 Introduction

A large number of dialogue systems to assist daily
life of users have been deployed in the real world,
however, most are handled on goal-oriented archi-
tecture (Young et al., 2010), on which clear goals
of users are assumed. In contrast, an informa-
tion navigation system (Yoshino and Kawahara,
2015) to clarify ambiguous user goals through a
dialogue was proposed. The system provides in-
formation about current talking topics with several
dialogue acts of providing information according
to the ky strength of the user’s interest to the cur-
rent topic. If the user’s intention is ambiguous and
the user does not have any strong interest or focus,
the system provides general information about the
current discussion topic to help the user decide.
However, if the user has specified interests or fo-
cus for some contents, the system answers the

user’s question and presents additional informa-
tion proactively according to the detected user’s
interests, even if the user can not find the exact
words to express his or her interests.

The partially observable Markov decision pro-
cess (POMDP)-based management architecture of
information navigation was proposed (Yoshino
and Kawahara, 2014) with several dialogue acts
of providing information, however, this study ran
the system only on one limited domain. In this
demonstration, we used the belief-update func-
tion and the policy function trained on the di↵er-
ent domain (news navigation for baseball news)
for the proposed system (information navigation
for tourist) to investigate the robustness of the de-
fined system architecture. We also introduce a new
mechanism to select more related topics when the
system selects a topic to be presented in the next
sub-dialogue by introducing semantic similarity of
dialogue topics (content).

The proposed system has speech interfaces
with open-source speech recognition system Julius
(Lee and Kawahara, 2009)1 and text to speech sys-
tem OpenJtalk2. This system runs on a standalone
machine without connecting other servers, how-
ever, any modules can be replaced by other mod-
ules on other severs because modules connect each
other on TCP/IP protocol.

2 System Architecture

Information providing is a sub-function of the
general purpose function defined in ISO-24617-
2 standard dialogue act set (Bunt et al., 2012),
which includes dialogue acts of providing new or
requested information from the dialogue partner.
We defined seven dialogue modules to fulfill the
information demand of a user though interactions

by following this standard. The relations of de-
fined modules and ISO-24617-2 dialogue acts are
summarized in Table 1. We defined three sub-
categories of dialogue act of “Inform” in the in-
formation providing function i.e., topic presenta-
tion (TP), storytelling (ST), and proactive presen-
tation (PP), to enable smart information provision.
The dialogue act “Answer” is also implemented as
the question answering (QA) module in the same
function. Our information navigation system ba-
sically provides information, but only one case
in which the system uses the information-seeking
function is confirmation (CO) to clarify the previ-
ous user intent. Dimension-specific functions sup-
port the general-purpose function; thus, minimum
social obligation and turn-management functions
are implemented as Greeting (GR) and Keep silent
(KS).

Dialogue modules for these functions are de-
fined for the task of news navigation (Yoshino and
Kawahara, 2015), and the call of these modules at
each turn is managed by the POMDP-based man-

ager. The call of system action is managed by the
policy of POMDP, which takes into account the in-
terests of the user (=user focus). The belief update
is defined as,

b0s0, f 0 = P(s
0, f 0|o0s0 , o0f 0)

X
s

P(s0, f 0|s, f , a)bs, f , (1)

where s denote the dialogue act of the user, f is
the focus of the user on the current topic, and a is
the selected dialogue module (dash means the next
turn). The policy is trained in Q-learning as

⇡(bs, f ) = a (2)

by using defined rewards and a user simulator con-
structed from dialogue data with users. The details
are described in a previous study (Yoshino and
Kawahara, 2015). The dialogue data of a di↵er-
ent domain (news navigation for baseball news) is
used to train the belief-update function and policy
function for the current domain (sightseeing do-
main).

The order of topics (=documents of the in-
formation source) to be presented at each sub-
dialogue is pre-defined in the current system.
However, topics to be introduced by the system
should be selected according to user interests in
the dialogue history, which can be captured in the
past dialogue. Thus, we introduce a mechanism
to introduce new topics that will be more attrac-
tive for the user by using past topics that the user
and system already discussed. We defined a se-
mantic similarity measure to define the similari-
ties of each pair of topics (=news). The system
determines the next topic of the dialogue by using
the similarity from topics that the user is interested
in, to topic candidates to be presented as the next
topic. A binary flag of user interest (=focus) can
be predicted for each presented topic by using the
existence of user focus in user utterances. Only
vectors of flagged documents are used to select the
next presenting document. If TP module is called
by the dialogue manager, the TP module selects
the next dialogue topic according to the similarity.
The system calculates a vector of a document with
word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) and the long-
short term memory neural network (LSTM)-based
encoder-decoder model (Cho et al., 2014) to define
the similarity. Each word of new text is embedded
into a fixed-length distributed representation with
word2vec, and inputted into the LSTM-based en-
coder model. The LSTM-based encoder-decoder
model is trained to restore the original sentences of
news texts. The final vector of the encoding phase
in this architecture is used as the vector of the doc-
ument. News texts collected from a Kyoto prefec-
ture sightseeing Web site3 was used as the training
data of word2vec, LSTM-based encoder-decoder
model, and content of the dialogue system. We
used cosine similarity between the vectors of doc-
uments to calculate the similarities of each topic
(news texts). The overall architecture is illustrated
in Figure 1.

3 Dialogue example (translation from
Japanese)

In the following example, the system starts a di-
alogue from the presentation of the system about
some interesting places in Kyoto. In User 2, the
user requires an overall description of the pre-
sented topic, however, the user does not have
any specified focus word that indicates his inter-

est. Thus, the system drastically changes the topic
when the system is requested to change the topic
(System 3). In System 4, the user shows an in-
terest with a focus on the word “matcha” and the
focus detection module of the system detects that
the user is interested in this current topic. The vec-
tor of the second topic (document) is used to select
the third topic in System 5, and the selected topic
is similar to the second topic (about “matcha”).

Dialogue example◆ ⇣
System 0 (GR): Hello, I would like to intro-
duce you to some interesting places in Kyoto.
Let me know if you are interested.
System 1 (TP): There is a cherry blossom il-
lumination event at the Kamo-gawa river.
User 2 (ST): Could you give me the details?
System 2 (ST): We have an illumination event
at the banks of the Kamo-gawa river from
Oike to Gojo, which is called the “flower cor-
ridor”.
User 3 (TP): Thanks, do you have any other
topics?
System 3 (TP): There is a tea ceremony in
Kyoto.
User 4 (QA): Does it involve matcha (tradi-
tional style green tea)?
System 4 (QA): Shoka-do added a new
green-tea course in a quality tea room.
User 5 (TP): Interesting. Any other news?
System 5 (TP): There is a long line to wait
for a new matcha parfait.
