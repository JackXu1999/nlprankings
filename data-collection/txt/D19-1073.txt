Abstract

While back-translation is simple and effec-
tive in exploiting abundant monolingual cor-
pora to improve low-resource neural machine
translation (NMT), the synthetic bilingual cor-
pora generated by NMT models trained on
limited authentic bilingual data are inevitably
noisy. In this work, we propose to quan-
tify the confidence of NMT model predictions
based on model uncertainty. With word- and
sentence-level confidence measures based on
uncertainty, it is possible for back-translation
to better cope with noise in synthetic bilingual
corpora. Experiments on Chinese-English and
English-German translation tasks show that
uncertainty-based confidence estimation sig-
nificantly improves the performance of back-
translation. 1

1 Introduction

The past several years have witnessed the rapid
development of end-to-end neural machine trans-
lation (NMT) (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau
et al., 2015; Vaswani et al., 2017), which lever-
ages neural networks to map between natural lan-
guages. Capable of learning representations from
data, NMT has significantly outperformed con-
ventional statistical machine translation (SMT)
(Koehn et al., 2003) and been widely deployed in
large-scale MT systems in the industry (Wu et al.,
2016; Hassan et al., 2018).

Despite the remarkable success, NMT suffers
from the data scarcity problem. For most lan-
guage pairs, large-scale, high-quality, and wide-
coverage bilingual corpora do not exist. Even for
the top handful of resource-rich languages, the
major sources of available parallel corpora are of-

Figure 1: Confidence estimation for back-translation.
Back-translation generates a source (e.g., English) sen-
tence for a ground-truth target (e.g., Chinese) sentence.
Such synthetic sentence pairs are used to train NMT
models. As the model prediction (i.e., x̂) is often noisy,
our work aims to quantify the prediction confidence us-
ing model uncertainty to alleviate error propagation.

ten restricted to government documents or news
articles.

Therefore, improving NMT under small-data
training conditions has attracted extensive atten-
tion in recent years (Sennrich et al., 2016a; Cheng
et al., 2016; Zoph et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2017;
Fadaee et al., 2017; Ren et al., 2018; Lample et al.,
2018). Among them, back-translation (Sennrich
et al., 2016a) is an important direction. Its ba-
sic idea is to use an NMT model trained on lim-
ited authentic bilingual corpora to generate syn-
thetic bilingual corpora using abundant monolin-
gual data. The authentic and synthetic bilingual
corpora are then combined to re-train NMT mod-
els. Due to its simplicity and effectiveness, back-
translation has been widely used in low-resource
language translation. However, as the synthetic
corpora generated by the NMT model are in-
evitably noisy, translation errors can be propa-
gated to subsequent steps and prone to hinder the

performance (Fadaee and Monz, 2018; Poncelas
et al., 2018).

In this work, we propose a method to quantify
the confidence of NMT model predictions to en-
able back-translation to better cope with transla-
tion errors. The central idea is to use model un-
certainty (Buntine and Weigend, 1991; Gal and
Ghahramani, 2016; Dong et al., 2018; Xiao and
Wang, 2019) to measure whether the model pa-
rameters can best describe the data distribution.
Based on the expectation and variance of word-
and sentence-level translation probabilities calcu-
lated by Monte Carlo Dropout (Gal and Ghahra-
mani, 2016), we introduce various confidence
measures.

Different from most previous quality estima-
tion studies that require feature extraction (Blatz
et al., 2004; Specia et al., 2009; Salehi et al.,
2014) or post-edited data (Kim et al., 2017; Wang
et al., 2018; Ive et al., 2018) to train external
confidence estimators, all our approach needs is
the NMT model itself. Hence, it is easy to ap-
ply our approach to arbitrary NMT models trained
for arbitrary language pairs. Experiments on
Chinese-English and English-German translation
tasks show that our approach significantly im-
proves the performance of back-translation.

2 Background

Let x = x1 . . . xI be a source-language sentence
and y = y1 . . . yJ be a target-language sentence.
We use P (y|x,θx→y) to denote a source-to-target
NMT model (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau
et al., 2015; Vaswani et al., 2017) parameterized
by θx→y. Similarly, the target-to-source NMT
model is denoted by P (x|y,θy→x).

Let Db = {〈x(m),y(m)〉}Mm=1 be an authentic
bilingual corpus that contains M sentence pairs
and Dm = {y(n)}Nn=1 be a monolingual corpus
that contains N target sentences. The first step of
back-translation (Sennrich et al., 2016a) is to train
a target-to-source model on the authentic bilingual
corpus Db using maximum likelihood estimation:

θ̂y→x = argmax
θy→x

{
L(Db,θy→x)

}
, (1)

where the log-likelihood is defined as

L(Db,θy→x) =
M∑

m=1

logP (x(m)|y(m),θy→x). (2)

The second step is to use the trained model
θ̂y→x to translate the monolingual corpus Dm:

x̂(n) = argmax
x

{
P (x|y(n), θ̂y→x)

}
, (3)

where x̂(n) = x̂(n)1 . . . x̂
(n)
I . The word-level deci-

sion rule is given by

x̂
(n)
i = argmax

x

{
P (x|y(n), x̂(n)<i , θ̂y→x)

}
. (4)

The resulting translations {x̂(n)}Nn=1 can be
combined with Dm to generate a synthetic bilin-
gual corpus D̃b = {〈x̂(n),y(n)〉}Nn=1.

The third step is to train a source-to-target
model P (y|x,θx→y) on the combination of au-
thentic and synthetic bilingual corpora:

θ̂x→y = argmax
θx→y

{
L(Db ∪ D̃b,θx→y)

}
. (5)

This three-step process can iterate until conver-
gence (Hoang et al., 2018; Cotterell and Kreutzer,
2018).

A problem with back-translation is that model
predictions are inevitably erroneous. Translation
errors can be propagated to subsequent steps and
impair the performance of back-translation, espe-
cially when D̃b is much larger than Db (Pinnis
et al., 2017; Fadaee and Monz, 2018; Poncelas
et al., 2018). Therefore, it is crucial to develop
principled solutions to enable back-translation to
better deal with the error propagation problem.

3 Approach

This work aims to find solutions to the two follow-
ing problems:

1. How to quantify the confidence of model pre-
dictions at both word and sentence levels?

2. How to leverage confidence to improve back-
translation?

Section 3.1 introduces how to calculate model un-
certainty, which lays a foundation for designing
uncertainty-based word- and sentence-level confi-
dence measures in Section 3.2. Section 3.3 de-
scribes confidence-aware training for NMT mod-
els on noisy bilingual corpora.

Figure 2: Illustration of uncertainty calculation. Given a target sentence y and the model prediction x̂, our approach
treats word- and sentence-level translation probabilities as random variables and uses Monte Carlo Dropout to draw
samples. These samples are used to calculate the expectations and variances of translation probabilities.

3.1 Calculating Uncertainty
Uncertainty quantification, which quantifies how
confident a certain mapping is with respect to dif-
ferent inputs, has made significant progress due
to the recent advances in Bayesian deep learning
(Kendall et al., 2015; Gal and Ghahramani, 2016;
Kendall and Gal, 2017; Xiao and Wang, 2019; Oh
et al., 2019; Geifman et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2019).
In this work, we aim to calculate model uncer-
tainty (Kendall and Gal, 2017; Dong et al., 2018;
Xiao and Wang, 2019), which measures whether
a model can best describe the data distribution,
for NMT using approximate inference methods
widely used in Bayesian neural networks.

Given the authentic bilingual corpus Db,
Bayesian neural networks aim at finding the
posterior distribution over model parameters
P (θy→x|Db). With a target sentence y in the
monolingual corpus Dm and its translation x̂, the
translation probability is given by

P (x̂|y,Db)

=

∫
P (x̂|y,θy→x)P (θy→x|Db)dθy→x. (6)

In particular, we are interested in calculating the
variance of the distribution P (x̂|y,θy→x) that re-
flects our ignorance over model parameters, which
is referred to as model uncertainty. As exact in-
ference is intractable, a number of variational in-
ference methods (Graves, 2011; Blundell et al.,
2015; Gal and Ghahramani, 2016) have been pro-

posed to find an approximation to P (θy→x|Db).
In this work, we leverage the widely used Monte
Carlo Dropout (Gal and Ghahramani, 2016) to ob-
tain samples of word- and sentence-level transla-
tion probabilities.

Figure 2 illustrates the key idea of our approach.
Given an authentic target sentence y, an NMT
model made its prediction x̂ via a standard de-
coding process (see Eq. (3) and Eq. (4)). To
quantify how confident the model was when mak-
ing the prediction, our approach treats word- and
sentence-level translation probabilities as random
variables. 2 Drawing samples can be done by ran-
domly deactivating part of neurons of the NMT
model and re-calculating translation probabilities
while keeping y and x̂ fixed. This stochastic feed-
forward is repeatedK times and generatesK sam-
ples for both word- and sentence-level translation
probabilities, respectively. We use θ̂(k)y→x to denote
the model parameters derived from θ̂y→x by deac-
tivation in the k-th pass.

Intuitively, if the variance of translation prob-
ability is low, it is highly likely that the model
was confident in making the prediction. Given
K samples {P (x̂|y, θ̂(k)y→x)}Kk=1, the expectation

2Unlike prior studies that calculate model uncertainty dur-
ing inference (Xiao and Wang, 2019), our approach computes
uncertainty after the NMT model has made the prediction
for two reasons. First, our goal is to quantify the confidence
of model prediction rather than using uncertainty to improve
model prediction. Second, using Monte Carlo Dropout dur-
ing decoding is very slow because of the autoregressive prop-
erty of standard NMT models.

which is also referred to as model uncertainty.
The expectation and variance of word-level

translation probabilities can also be calculated
similarly using K samples.

3.2 Confidence Measures
We use C(y, x̂<i, x̂i, θ̂y→x) to denote the word-
level confidence for the model to generate x̂i and
C(y, x̂, θ̂y→x) to the denote the sentence-level
confidence for the model to generate x̂.

Intuitively, when making predictions, the more
confident an NMT model is, the higher expecta-
tion and lower variance of translation probability
are. For comparison reasons, we used the follow-
ing four types of confidence measures at the sen-
tence level in our experiments:

1. Predicted translation probability (PTP). The
translation probability of model prediction
during standard decoding (Eq. (3)):

CPTP(y, x̂, θ̂y→x) = P (x̂|y, θ̂y→x). (9)

2. Expected translation probability (EXP). The
expectation of translation probability:

CEXP(y, x̂, θ̂y→x) = E
[
P (x̂|y, θ̂y→x)

]
. (10)

3. Variance of translation probability (VAR).
The variance of translation probability:

CVAR(y, x̂, θ̂y→x)

=
(

1−Var
[
P (x̂|y, θ̂y→x)

])α
. (11)

4. Combination of expectation and variance
(CEV). The combination of expectation and
variance:

CCEV(y, x̂, θ̂y→x)

=

(
1− Var

[
P (x̂|y, θ̂y→x)

]

E
[
P (x̂|y, θ̂y→x)

]
)β

. (12)

where α and β are hyper-parameters to control the
gap between confidence values of sentences of dif-
ferent quality. Larger values of α and β lead to
bigger gaps. 3

In Eq. (12), our approach tries to combine the
merits of expectation and variance by using vari-
ance divided by expectation because smaller vari-
ance and bigger expectation are expected to result
in higher confidence. There may exist more so-
phisticated ways to estimate prediction confidence
using model uncertainty (Dong et al., 2018). As
we find that the measures mentioned above are
easy-to-implement and prove to be effective in our
experiments, we leave the investigation of more
complex confidence measures for future work.

The word-level confidence measures can be de-
fined similarly.

3.3 Confidence-aware Training for NMT

We propose confidence-aware training for NMT
to enable NMT to make better use of noisy data.
Word- and sentence-level confidence measures are
complementary: while word-level confidence can
provide more fine-grained information than the
sentence-level counterpart, it is unable to cope
with word omission errors that can only be cap-
tured at the sentence level. As a result, our ap-
proach incorporates both word- and sentence-level
confidence measures into the training process. 4

Using Sentence-level Confidence
It is easy to integrate sentence-level confidence
into back-translation by modifying the likelihood
function in Eq. (5):

L(Db ∪ D̃b,θx→y)

=

M∑

m=1

logP (y(m)|x(m),θx→y) +

N∑

n=1

C(y(n), x̂(n), θ̂y→x)×

logP (y(n)|x̂(n),θx→y). (13)
3Note that all confidence measures are between 0 and 1.

Clearly, both the expectation and variance of a probability
are between 0 and 1. It can be proved that the variance of a
probability is no greater than the corresponding expectation.
As a result, CCEV(·) is also between 0 and 1.

4Instead of applying confidence estimation to the second
pass of decoding (Luong et al., 2017), we directly integrate
confidence scores into the training process. These two kinds
of methods are complementary.

See Eq. (15) for details.

Serving as a weight assigned to each synthetic
sentence pair, sentence-level confidence is ex-
pected to help to minimize the negative effect
of estimating parameters on sentences with lower
confidence. Note that the confidence of an authen-
tic sentence pair in Db is 1.
Using Word-level Confidence
As the source side instead of the target side of
the synthetic bilingual corpus is noisy, word-
level confidence cannot be integrated into back-
translation in a similar way to sentence-level con-
fidence. This is because the word-level confidence
associated with each source word does not get in-
volved in backpropagation during training.

Alternatively, we build a real-valued word-level
confidence vector:

c =
{
C
(
y(n), x̂

(n)
<i , x̂i, θ̂y→x

)}I
i=1
. (14)

Due to the wide use of attention (Bahdanau
et al., 2015; Vaswani et al., 2017) in NMT, we use
the confidence vector c ∈ R1×I to modify atten-
tion weights and enable the model to focus more
on words with high confidence. Figure 3 shows
an example. Figure 3(a) gives a source sentence
in the synthetic bilingual corpus, in which erro-
neous words “hold”, “talks”, and “and” receive
high attention weights, deteriorating the parame-
ter estimation on this sentence pair. By multiply-
ing with word-level confidence (Figure 3(b)), the
weights are modified to pay less attention to erro-
neous words (Figure 3(c)).

More formally, the modified attention function
is given by

Attention(Q,K,V, c)

=

(
softmax

(QK>√
D

)
� c
)
V, (15)

where Q ∈ RI×D, K ∈ RI×D, and V ∈ RI×D
are query, key, and value matrices and D is the
hidden size. � is a broadcast product.

Since the integration of sentence- and word-
level confidence measures are independent of each
other, it is easy to use both of them in back-
translation.

4 Experiments

4.1 Setup
We evaluated our approach on Chinese-English
and English-German translation tasks. The evalu-
ation metric is BLEU (Papineni et al., 2001) as cal-
culated by the multi-bleu.perl script. We
use the paired bootstrap resampling (Koehn, 2004)
for significance testing.

For the Chinese-English task, the training
set contains 1.25M sentence pairs from LDC5

with 27.8M Chinese words and 34.5M English
words. To build the monolingual corpus for back-
translation, we extracted the English side of the
training set of the WMT 2017 Chinese-English
news translation task. After removing sentences
longer than 256 words, we randomly selected
10M English sentences as the monolingual cor-
pus. NIST06 is used as the development set and
NIST02, 03, 04, 05, and 08 datasets as test sets.

For the English-German task, we used the
dataset of the WMT 2014 English-German trans-
lation task. The training set consists of 4.47M sen-
tence pairs with 116M English words and 110M
German words. We randomly selected 4.5M Ger-
man sentences from the 2012 News Crawl corpus
of WMT 2014 to construct the monolingual cor-
pus for back-translation. We use newstest 2013 as

5The training set includes LDC2002E18, LDC2003E07,
LDC2003E14, part of LDC2004T07, LDC2004T08 and
LDC2005T06.

Chinese sentences were segmented by an open-
source toolkit THULAC6 . German and English
sentences were tokenized by the tokenizer in
Moses (Koehn et al., 2007). We used byte pair
encoding (Sennrich et al., 2016b) to perform sub-
word segmentation with 32k merge operations for
Chinese-English and 35k merge operations for
English-German. Sentence pairs are batched to-
gether by approximate length and each batch has
roughly 25,000 source and target tokens. We dis-
tinguish between three kinds of translations of the
monolingual corpus:

1. NONE: there is no translation and only the
authentic bilingual corpus is used;

2. SEARCH: the translations are generated by
beam search (Sennrich et al., 2016a);

3. SAMPLE: the translations are generated by
sampling (Edunov et al., 2018).

As neural quality estimation (Kim et al., 2017;
Wang et al., 2018) can also give word- and
sentence-level confidences for the output of NMT
models when labeled data is available, we distin-
guish between two kinds of confidence estimation
methods:

1. NEURALQE: the confidences are given by an
external neural quality estimator;

2. UNCERTAINTY: the proposed uncertainty-
based confidence estimation method.

For NEURALQE, we used the Predictor-
Estimator architecture (Kim et al., 2017) im-
plemented by OpenKiwi (Kepler et al., 2019),

which is an open source software officially recom-
mended by the QE shared task of WMT. Follow-
ing the guide of OpenKiwi, we used a German-
English parallel corpus containing 2.09M sentence
pairs to train the predictor and a post-edited cor-
pus containing 25k sentence triples to train the
estimator. All the data used to train QE models
are provided by WMT. As there are no post-edited
corpora for the Chinese-English task, NEURALQE
can only be used in the English-German task in
our experiments. For NEURALQE, both word- and
sentence- level quality scores were considered.

We implemented our method on the top of
THUMT (Zhang et al., 2017). The NMT model we
use is Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017). We used
the base model for the Chinese-English task and
the big model for the English-German task. We
used the Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2015)
with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and � = 10−9 to opti-
mize model parameters. We used the same warm-
up strategy for learning rate as Vaswani et al.
(2017) with warmup steps = 4, 000. During
training, the hyper-parameter of label smoothing
was set as �ls = 0.1 (Szegedy et al., 2016; Pereyra
et al., 2017). During training and the Monte Carlo
Dropout process, the hyper-parameter of dropout
was set to 0.1 and 0.3 for Transformer base and big
models, respectively. K was set to 20. Through
experiments, we find our method works best when
the α and β are set to 2. All experiments were
conducted on 8 NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti GPUs.

4.2 Comparison of Confidence Measures

Table 1 shows the comparison of confidence mea-
sures on the Chinese-English development set. We
find that using either the translation probabilities
outputted by the model (i.e., “PTP”) or the expec-
tation of translation probabilities (i.e., “EXP”) de-
teriorates the translation quality, which suggests
that translation probabilities themselves can not
help NMT models better cope with synthetic data.

SAMPLE without CE (p < 0.01).

In contrast, using the variance or model uncer-
tainty (i.e., “VAR”) increases translation quality.
Combining variance and expectation (i.e., “CEV”)
leads to a further improvement. In the following
experiments, we use CEV as the default setting.

4.3 Comparison between Word- and
Sentence-level Confidence Measures

Table 2 shows the comparison between word-
and sentence-level CEV (i.e., combination of ex-
pectation and variance) confidence measures on
the Chinese-English development set. It is clear
that using either sentence-level or word-level con-
fidence measures improves the translation per-
formance. Thanks to more fine-grained quan-
tification of uncertainty, using word-level confi-
dence achieves a higher BLEU score than us-
ing sentence-level confidence. Combining the
sentence- and word-level of confidences leads to
a further improvement, suggesting that they are
complementary to each other. In the following ex-
periments, we use the combination of word- and
sentence-level confidences as the default setting.

4.4 Main Results

The Chinese-English Task
Table 3 shows the results of the Chinese-English
task. Back-translation, either generating transla-
tions using beam search (i.e., SEARCH) or using
sampling (i.e., SAMPLE), does lead to significant
improvements over using only the authentic bilin-
gual corpus (i.e., NONE). We find that SAM-
PLE is more effective than SEARCH, which con-
firms the finding of Edunov et al. (2018). Using
uncertainty-based confidence (i.e., “U”) signifi-

cantly improves over both SEARCH and SAMPLE
on the combination of all test sets (p < 0.01). As
there is no Chinese-English labeled data to train
neural quality estimation models, we did not re-
port the result of NEURALQE in this experiment.

The English-German Task

Table 4 shows the results of the English-German
task. We find that using quality estimation, ei-
ther NEURALQE (i.e., “N”) or UNCERTAINTY
(i.e., “U”), improves over SEARCH and SAMPLE.
UNCERTAINTY even achieves better performance
than NEURALQE, although NEURALQE uses ad-
ditional labeled training data. As NEURALQE
heavily relies on post-edited corpora and labeled
data to train QE models, it can only be used in a
handful of language pairs. In contrast, it is easier
to apply our approach to arbitrary language pairs
since it does not need any labeled data to estimate
confidence.

4.5 Effect of Training Corpus Size

Figure 4 shows the effect of training corpus size.
The X-axis is the size of the total training data (i.e.,
Db∪D̃b in Eq. (5)). The BLEU scores were calcu-
lated on the Chinese-English development set. We
find that the translation performance of SEARCH
rises with the increase of monolingual corpus size
in the beginning. However, further enlarging the
monolingual corpus hurts the translation perfor-
mance. In contrast, our approach can still obtain
further improvements when adding more synthetic
bilingual sentence pairs. Similar findings are also
observed for SAMPLE.

4.6 Effect of Data Selection

Instead of randomly selecting monolingual sen-
tences to generate synthetic data, we also used
the method proposed by (Fadaee and Monz, 2018)
to select monolingual data by targeting difficult
words. In this series of experiments, we used the
same amount of monolingual data that was derived
from a larger monolingual corpus using different
data selection methods.

Results on NIST06 show that targeting difficult
words improves over randomly selecting mono-
lingual data (46.23 → 46.60 BLEU), confirming
the finding of Fadaee and Monz (2018). Us-
ing uncertainty-based confidence can further im-

prove the translation performance (46.60→ 47.18
BLEU), indicating that our approach can be com-
bined with advanced data selection methods.

4.7 Case Study

Figure 5 shows an example of model prediction
and its corresponding word- and sentence-level
confidence measures for the English-German task.
We observe that the PTP and EXP measures are
unable to give low confidence to erroneous words.
In contrast, variance-based measures such as VAR
and CEV can better quantify how confident the
model is to make its prediction.

5 Related work

Our work is closely related to three lines of re-
search: (1) back-translation, (2) confidence esti-
mation, and (3) uncertainty quantification.

5.1 Back-translation

Back-translation is a simple and effective ap-
proach to leveraging monolingual data for NMT
(Sennrich et al., 2016a). There has been a grow-
ing body of literature that analyzes and extends
back-translation recently. Currey et al. (2017)
show that low-resource NMT can benefit from the
synthetic data generated by simply copying tar-
get monolingual data to the source side. Imamura
et al. (2018) and Edunov et al. (2018) demon-
strate that it is more effective to generate source
sentences via sampling rather than beam search.

(2018) find that iterative back-translation can fur-
ther improve the performance of NMT. Fadaee
and Monz (2018) show that words with high pre-
dicted loss during training benefit most. Our
work differs from existing methods in that we
propose to use confidence estimation to enable
back-translation to better cope with noisy syn-
thetic data, which can be easily combined with
previous works. Our experiments show that both
neural and uncertainty-based confidence estima-
tion methods benefit back-translation.

5.2 Confidence Estimation

Estimating the confidence or quality of the output
of MT systems (Ueffing and Ney, 2007; Specia
et al., 2009; Bach et al., 2011; Salehi et al., 2014;
Rikters and Fishel, 2017; Kepler et al., 2019) is
important for enabling downstream applications
such as post-editing and interactive MT to bet-
ter cope with translation mistakes. While existing
methods rely on external models to estimate con-
fidence, our approach leverages model uncertainty
to derive confidence measures. The major benefit
is that our approach does not need labeled data.

5.3 Uncertainty Quantification

Reliable uncertainty quantification is key to build-
ing a robust artificial intelligent system. It has
been successfully applied to many fields, includ-
ing computer vision (Kendall et al., 2015; Kendall
and Gal, 2017), time series prediction (Zhu and
Laptev, 2017), and natural language processing
(Dong et al., 2018; Xiao and Wang, 2019). Our
work differs from previous work in that we are in-

terested in calculating uncertainty after the model
has made the prediction rather during inference.
Ott et al. (2018) also analyze the inherent uncer-
tainty of machine translation. The difference is
that they focus on the existence of multiple correct
translations for a single sentence while we aim to
quantify the uncertainty of NMT models.

6 Conclusions

We have presented a method for qualifying model
uncertainty for neural machine translation and use
uncertainty-based confidence measures to improve
back-translation. The key idea is to use Monte
Carlo Dropout to sample translation probabilities
to calculate model uncertainty, without the need
for manually labeled data. As our approach is
transparent to model architectures, we plan to fur-
ther verify the effectiveness of our approach on
other downstream applications of NMT such as
post-editing and interactive MT in the future.
