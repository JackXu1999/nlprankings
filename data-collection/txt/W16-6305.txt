Abstract

Sentiment analysis is a discipline of Natu-
ral Language Processing which deals with
analysing the subjectivity of the data. It
is an important task with both commer-
cial and academic functionality. Lan-
guages like English have several resources
which assist in the task of sentiment anal-
ysis. SentiWordNet for English is one
such important lexical resource that con-
tains subjective polarity for each lexical
item. With growing data in native vernac-
ular, there is a need for language-specific
SentiWordNet(s). In this paper, we dis-
cuss a generic approach followed for the
development of a Tamil SentiWordNet us-
ing currently available resources in En-
glish. For Tamil SentiWordNet, a substan-
tial agreement Fleiss Kappa score of 0.663
was obtained after verification from Tamil
annotators. Such a resource would serve
as a baseline for future improvements in
the task of sentiment analysis specific to
Tamil data.

1 Introduction

Tamil has over 70 million native speakers spread
across the world and digitized data for Tamil is
ever increasing on the web. From news data to
movie review sites, usage of Tamil on the web is
more than it ever was. In an era driven by social
media, the focus shifts from an objective applica-
tion (News) to a subjective environment (Surveys,
Online Review Systems). Applications of senti-
ment analysis are endless and it is in demand be-
cause it has proved to be efficient. Thousands of
text documents can be processed for sentiment in
seconds compared to the hours it would take for
a team to manually complete the task. Commer-

cial Organisations are therefore incorporating sen-
timent analysis systems1 for customer feedback
and product review. For good governance, feed-
back from the public through social media and
other surveys is monitored at a large scale. The
public prefers to give feedback in its own vernac-
ular. Analysing the sentiment in their feedback
in various Indian languages hence demands lan-
guage specific subjective lexicons. This served as
the motivation for the creation of SentiWordNet
for Tamil.

A translation based approach has been adopted
to build this resource using various lexicons in En-
glish. Each of these lexicons comprises of English
words with certain polarity. After several levels
of preprocessing, a final set of English words was
obtained. These words were then translated into
Tamil using Google Translate2. The final set of
words were annotated with either positive or neg-
ative polarity based on its prior polarity in English.
The final lexicon was checked by Tamil annotators
to remove any ambiguous entries and also for ac-
curacy of translation.

The various tools used for the construction of
SentiWordNet for Tamil include English Senti-
WordNet (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006), AFINN-
111 lexicon (Nielsen, 2011), Subjectivity Lexicon
(Wilson et al., 2005), Opinion Lexicon (Liu et al.,
2005) and Google Translate.

The rest of the paper is organized into various
sections. Section 2 deals with related work and
progress towards building SentiWordNets for In-
dian languages followed by Section 3 describing
the resources and tools used. Section 4 contains
a detailed explanation of the approach followed to
build the Tamil SentiWordNet. Section 5 defines
the evaluation scheme for verification of resource

created. An insight on future work and extensi-
bility of the SentiWordNet is provided in Section
6.

2 Related Work

Sentiment analysis has been an age-old task and
has been improving steadily over the past few
decades. ”It is one of the most active research
areas in natural language processing and is also
widely studied in data mining, web mining, and
text mining” (Liu, 2012). Initially the analysis was
only restricted to adjectives and adverbs but now
many lexical resources contain nouns and verbs
also. Various approaches have been proposed for
building a SentiWordNet in the past.

Turney worked on sentiment analysis for cus-
tomer reviews dataset, using an unsupervised
learning algorithm (Turney, 2002). Wiebe pro-
posed methods to generate a resource, with subjec-
tive information, for a given target language from
resources present in English (Wiebe and Riloff,
2005). Translation methods included using a bilin-
gual dictionary and a parallel corpora based ap-
proach.

For English, SentiWordNet was developed by
Esuli (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006) with improve-
ments over the years (Baccianella et al., 2010).
English SentiWordNet 3.0 is based off the Prince-
ton English WordNet (Miller, 1995). Expansion
strategies were suggested to increase the coverage
of English SentiWordNet by assigning scores to
antonym and synonym synsets.

Less resourced languages depend on resources
present in English to build such lexical tools.
Whalley and Medagoda propose a method to build
a sentiment lexicon for Sinhala using Sentiword-
net 3.0 (Whalley and Medagoda, 2015). The Sen-
tiwordnet is mapped to an online Sinhala dictio-
nary. Scores for each lexicon and its synonyms
is assigned based on English Sentiwordnet scores.
Similar work is prevalent in literature for many In-
dian languages as well. Joshi built a SentiWordNet
for Hindi using English SentiWordNet and linking
English and Hindi WordNets (Joshi et al., 2010).
Polarity scores were copied from the words in En-
glish SentiWordNet to the corresponding trans-
lated words in Hindi SentiWordNet.

Another approach was proposed by Amitava
Das (Das and Bandyopadhyay, 2010) (Das and
Bandyopadhyay, 2011) (Das and Gambäck, 2012)
in order to build SentiWordNet for three Indian

languages (Bengali, Hindi and Telugu). This ap-
proach used two resources available in English
which provided subjectivity information: Senti-
WordNet 3.0 and Subjectivity Lexicon. A bilin-
gual dictionary based translation was carried out
in order to obtain the target lexicon. A Wordnet
based approach, to assign scores to synsets, and an
automatic corpus based approach were also sug-
gested.

3 Resources Used

For the creation of Tamil SentiWordnet, English
SentiWordNet 3.0 and Subjectivity Lexicon were
the two most reliable resources. On review-
ing English SentiWordNet and comparing it with
the Subjectivity Lexicon, it was found that many
words had contradicting sentiments in both the
lists. Therefore, for a better estimate of sentiment
for each word and reduction of ambiguities, two
more resources, AFINN-111 and Opinion Lexi-
con, were also used. The resources used are de-
scribed below:

List Name Number of Tokens
SentiWordNet 2000K
Subjectivity Lexicon 8222
AFINN-111 2477
Opinion Lexicon 6789

Table 1: Resource Table.

• English SentiWordNet is a lexical resource for
opinion mining which has a rich dataset of
about 2 million lexical entries. SentiWord-
Net assigns, to each synset of WordNet, sen-
timent scores: positive and negative. Each
synset is uniquely identified by a synset ID
corresponding to the synset ID in Princeton
WordNet. Other information includes Part-
Of-Speech Tag (Adjective, Adverb, Noun,
Verb). Positive and negative scores are a dec-
imal ranging from zero to one. Objectivity
score defines how factual a given word is and
is obtained by 1 - (Positive Score + Negative
Score).

• Subjectivity Lexicon is also a highly reliable
lexicon for sentiment information and is ro-
bust in terms of performance. It is used as a
part of OpinionFinder3 (Wilson et al., 2005).

The list contains for a given word, Part-of-
Speech tag, its polarity and subjectivity pa-
rameter. Subjectivity parameter classifies the
word as either strongly or weakly subjective.

• AFINN-111 is a list of English words rated for
valence with an integer between minus five
(negative) and plus five (positive). Words
have been manually labeled by Finn rup
Nielsen (Nielsen, 2011).

• Opinion Lexicon comprises of a relatively
large dataset of positive and negative words
without any specific scores. This dataset is
based off annotated twitter corpora (Hu and
Liu, 2004).

• Translation-Dictionary . In order to translate
the final collection of words from English to
Tamil, we used Google Translate4 by running
every single word on the Google Translate
web application. The final list of translated
words was cross checked by Tamil annotators
in order to remove multi-word entries, incor-
rect translations and other ambiguous words.

4 Approach

Figure 1 shows a step by step procedure followed
to build the Tamil SentiWordNet. The methodol-
ogy is generic and can be used to build a Senti-
WordNet in any language. The entire procedure is
divided into three parts :

• Collecting Source Lexicon - In order to build a
SentiWordNet for any Indian language, one
can use available resource(s), with sentiment
information, from English.

• Translation to Target Lexicon - Once source
lexicon is acquired, it needs to be translated
to target lexicon using a translation method
such as usage of a bilingual dictionary, an on-
line translation resource, or a parallel corpus.

• Evaluation of Target Lexicon - The created
target lexicon needs to be evaluated for er-
rors. This paper adopts manual evaluation by
language specific annotators and reports an-
notator agreement score.

4.1 Source Lexicon

In order to obtain the source lexicon, multiple fil-
tering techniques were applied to the existing re-
sources in English. Source Lexicon acquisition
starts with Subjectivity Lexicon and SentiWord-
Net, which are the primary resources for senti-
ment analysis in English. SentiWordNet polarity
scores are obtained from learning through large
English corpora. A threshold of 0.4 was consid-
ered (Das and Bandyopadhyay, 2010), as those
words which have a score lower than the thresh-
old may lose subjectivity upon translation to the
target language. Words which have scores above
0.4 are assumed to be strongly subjective. Upon
filtering words from English SentiWordNet based
on the above criteria, a total of 16,791 tokens were
obtained.

The Subjectivity Lexicon contains 8,222 words
in total. From this set, all words which were anno-
tated as weakly subjective were removed (Riloff
et al., 2006). A total of 2,652 weakly subjec-
tive words were discarded resulting in a new set
of only strongly subjective words. As mentioned
before, this list also contains Part-of-Speech tags.
Those words which were tagged ’anypos’ were
also removed to prevent context related ambigu-
ities. Since the main aim was only to capture posi-
tive or negative sentiment, words tagged as neutral
were also removed. The final list of words from
Subjectivity Lexicon comprised of 4,526 tokens.

On merging the two filtered lists it was found
that 2,199 tokens were common between the both.
Among these duplicates only words which had the
same Part-of-Speech tag in both the lists were sent
forward and the others were discarded. Some of
the duplicates included words which had conflict-
ing tags in the SentiWordNet and the Subjectiv-
ity Lexicon. For example, the word ’pride’ was
tagged as positive in the Subjectivity Lexicon and
the same word was given a higher negative score
in SentiWordNet. Subjectivity of such words de-
pend upon context and hence were also removed.

The final list now contained words which were
strongly subjective and would more likely hold
their subjectivity after translation. To ensure this,
the list was manually checked. The final list now
contained 15,823 tokens.

Since many entries in the SentiWordNet had op-
posing scores to that in the Subjectivity Lexicon,
it was decided to add two more lists to increase
the reliability of the source lexicon. AFINN-32



Figure 1: Flow of Design for Tamil SentiWordNet

111 (Nielsen, 2011) and Opinion Lexicon (Liu et
al., 2005) were the two lists that were added and
they were used to filter out more words which had
ambiguous sense. For example, the word ’rid’
had a positive score in SentiWordNet and it was
tagged as negative in the Subjectivity Lexicon.
Such words had to be avoided because they could
be either positive or negative, depending on the
context. A total of 4,954 words were present in
more than one list. If a given word was present in
a majority of the lists it appeared in, the majority
opinion (positive or negative) was considered. The
final list only contained strongly subjective words
which served as the source lexicon before transla-
tion.

4.2 Target Lexicon

Each of the words from the final list was then
translated using Google translate. Bilingual dic-
tionaries may not account for all the words be-
cause of language variations (Bakliwal et al.,
2012). This method of translation is also labour
intensive. Context dependent word mapping be-
tween two languages is a tough task in general.
Though Google Translate has its own challenges,
this method was used for faster translation of
words and better translation performance.

Some words were not translated into Tamil be-
cause the target language lacks such words. Multi-
word entries in the source lexicon were challeng-
ing to translate as sometimes the first word would

get translated but not the rest. In a few cases a
multi-word entry would get translated to an accu-
rate single word and in some cases a single word
entry would get translated to a multi-word entry in
the target language. Such cases had to be individ-
ually checked during pre-processing before evalu-
ation.

The final list of words which were properly
translated contained 10,225 single word entries
tagged as positive or negative. One must note that
this method does not copy English SentiWordNet
scores for positivity or negativity. Copying scores
was suggested previously in literature (Das and
Bandyopadhyay, 2010). This was not followed be-
cause English SentiWordNet scores are based on
English corpus. Same scores may not necessarily
work for Tamil. Subjectivity of a word may tran-
scend across languages but not in the same mag-
nitude. Hence, a given word is only marked as
carrying either positive or negative sentiment.

5 Evaluation Methodology

After translation to target lexicon, the list com-
prised of a set of English words along with their
corresponding Tamil translations. Each of these
words is either marked with positive or negative
polarity based on its polarity in source lexicon(s).

This list was sent to 5 Tamil annotators to ver-
ify the correctness of the translation. Words which
did not retain subjectivity after translation were re-
moved. In case of conflict over any word, the ma-33



jority of opinion was taken into account. When
we say majority, we assume that at-least 4 out of
5 annotators agree on a given sentiment. If not,
the word is removed from the list for future in-
spection. Words which did not transfer contex-
tual meaning were also removed. For example,
the word inclination was translated wrongly in the
target language. The translation only captured the
words meaning as a slope or an incline and not a
person’s tendency to act or feel in a certain way.
Words which were wrongly translated were also
removed.

The evaluation resulted in 190 words be-
ing marked as ambiguous and 540 words being
marked as wrongly translated. These words were
eliminated and the final lexicon contained a to-
tal of 9495 words with strong subjectivity. 3336
words were tagged as positive and 6159 words
were tagged as negative. In order to capture inter-
annotator agreement Fleiss Kappa5 score for the
final set was also calculated. Fleiss Kappa is cal-
culated using the following formula:

κ =
P̄ − P̄e
1 − P̄e

(1)

P̄ is the sum of observed agreement. P̄e is the sum
of agreement by chance. Fleiss kappa score is cal-
culated using five raters.There are two categories
(positive/negative). A substantial agreement score
of κ = 0.663 is reported for Tamil SentiWordNet.

Initial Token Count 10225
Wrongly Translated 540
Ambiguous Entries 190
Final Token Count 9495
Inter-Annotator Agreement (Fleiss Kappa)

0.663

6 Conclusion and Future Work

The Tamil SentiWordNet lexicon serves as a base-
line for future improvements. The approach fol-
lowed can be used to build SentiWordNet for any
Indian Language. Other methods of translation to
target language include usage of a bilingual dictio-
nary or a parallel corpora for English and Target
language pair. Various techniques can be applied
to improve the accuracy and expand the lexicon

content. Tamil WordNet (Rajendran et al., 2002)
is available publicly6 and contains 1916 synset en-
tries. Lexicon can be expanded by using, for a
given word in the Tamil SentiWordNet, its cor-
responding synsets in the Tamil WordNet. Syn-
onyms and antonyms can be classified with similar
and opposite subjectivity respectively.

The SentiWordNet can also be expanded us-
ing a corpus based approach to capture language-
specific words. SentiWordNet lexicon can be used
as a seed list and the corpus can be tagged based
on this seed list. Machine learning techniques can
then be applied on this corpus to find new words
to be added to the lexicon.

Currently, the lexicon has only been divided
into two classes (positive and negative) This clas-
sification can be replaced by a five point scale in
the future (Nakov et al., 2016). Furthermore, for
getting subjectivity scores of individual words in
the SentiWordNet one can use sentiment annotated
Tamil corpora. The accuracy of any lexical re-
source is best calculated when it is actually us-
able in practical applications. With Tamil social
media data being more readily available, manually
annotating this data for positive and negative sen-
timent and using Tamil SentiWordNet to annotate
the same data to check for accuracy is one possible
method. One of the challenges which needs to be
addressed in the future is capturing the sentiment
of multi-word entries.
