Abstract 

The automatic processing of clinical docu-

ments, such as Electronic Health Records 

(EHRs), could benefit substantially from 

the enrichment of medical terminologies 

with terms encountered in clinical practice. 

To integrate such terms into existing 

knowledge sources, they must be linked to 

corresponding concepts. We present a 

method for the semantic categorization of 

clinical terms based on their surface form. 

We find that features based on sublanguage 

properties can provide valuable cues for the 

classification of term variants. 

1 Background 

Structured terminologies and ontologies play a 

pivotal role in the automatic processing of health 

data, as they provide the framework for mapping 

unstructured information into a machine-readable 

format. Moreover, the term bases themselves can 

serve as input for the identification of medical en-

tities in free text. Even though methods from ma-

chine learning are gaining popularity, many state-

of-the-art systems rely strongly on pre-compiled 

terminologies (e.g. Savova et al. 2010). The per-

formance of such applications thus relies crucially 

on the lexical coverage of the term base. However, 

the major biomedical terminologies, such as the

Systematic Nomenclature of Medicine – Clinical 

Terms (SNOMED CT)1 and the Unified Medical 

Language System (UMLS)2 do not adequately re-

flect the range of term variants encountered in 

clinical practice. Especially in languages other 

than English, where the available terminologies 

are less comprehensive, this discrepancy can harm 

performance (Henriksson et al. 2014; Skeppstedt 

et al. 2014). One strategy to overcome this bottle-

neck is to enrich the available terminologies with 

additional variants acquired from domain corpora. 

Concretely, this involves the recognition of vari-

ants in text, and their association with the semantic 

classes or concepts provided by the respective ter-

minology. 

The focus of this paper is on the second task, i.e. 

the semantic categorization of term variants. In 

particular, we investigate whether the features of a 

given sublanguage can be leveraged to associate 

individual variants with semantic classes. Accord-

ing to sublanguage theory, specialized languages 

can be characterized by semantic constraints, as 

well as stylistic preferences and distinctive syntac-

tic patterns (Friedman, Kra, and Rzhetsky 2002; 

Harris 1982, 1991; 2002). In the medical domain, 

such differences manifest themselves at fine-

grained levels, e.g. between clinical specialties and 

different document types (Feldman, Hazekamp,

and Chawla 2016). We capitalize on this phenom-

enon for the semantic classification of clinical 

terms: Drawing on the observation that, even 

within one clinical document, there are fundamen-

tal semantic and stylistic differences between the 

individual sections, we consider the languages 

found in different parts of the EHR sublanguages 

of their own. Based on the assumption that, within 

the context of a sublanguage, certain variation pro-

cesses pattern with conceptual properties, we use 

properties of the surface form as predictors for the 

semantic classification of the term. 

The remainder of this paper is structured as fol-

lows: In Section 2, we give an overview of related 

research. In Section 3, we describe our materials 

and methods. After the presentation of the results 

(Section 4) and their discussion (Section 5), we 

conclude in Section 6. 

2 Related research 

Especially in emerging domains and under-re-

sourced languages, domain corpora are a valuable 

resource for terminology development. Automatic 

Term Recognition (ATR) from biomedical and 

clinical text is thus a well-studied field (cf. e.g. 

Spasić et al. 2013; Carroll, Koeling, and Puri 2012; 

Doing-Harris, Livnat, and Meystre 2015; Zhang et 

al. 2017 for state-of-the-art systems). 

To leverage the acquired terms for NLP, they are 

typically organized according to their semantic 

properties. If the target categories are not yet de-

fined, clustering can be used to group semantically 

related terms and infer taxonomical relations 

(Siklósi 2015). However, the more common sce-

nario is that the newly acquired variants need to be 

integrated into an existing knowledge source. To 

associate terms with pre-defined semantic catego-

ries, both external and internal features of the terms 

have been used. Most approaches rely on external 

context. In particular, they draw on the core as-

sumption of distributional semantics, which is that 

semantically similar words tend to occur in similar 

lexical contexts and syntactic constellations 

(Sibanda et al. 2006; Weeds et al. 2014). A number 

of studies showed, though, that term-internal prop-

erties can inform the task as well: Medical terms 

contain a high number of descriptive elements, 

such as neoclassical affixes or roots associated with 

a semantic type. Such features have been success-

fully employed to classify biological concept 

names and validate the assignment of semantic 

types in biomedical knowledge sources (Torii, 

Kamboj, and Vijay-Shanker 2004; Fan, Xu, and 

Friedman 2007). Morpho-semantic decomposition 

has also been employed for the semantic grouping 

of medical compounds in a multilingual setting 

(Namer and Baud 2007). 

However, these approaches only work for a very 

confined group of terms, namely specialized terms 

that are based on neoclassical roots, spelled out in 

their full form, and adhere to grammatical and or-

thographic conventions. While these conditions 

might be met in the biomedical genre, they are un-

realistic when dealing with input from the clinical 

domain: In clinical practice, medical staff use both 

specialized terms and lay variants, which do not 

contain neoclassical elements. Moreover, clinical

records are composed in a hectic environment and 

primarily intended for peer-to-peer communica-

tion. They are thus known to contain a high propor-

tion of irregular or intransparent forms, such as 

misspellings and abbreviations. Therefore, in this 

paper, we investigate whether the approach can be 

taken to a more abstract level. Instead of using the 

words themselves as predictors, we employ a set of 

non-lexical features reflecting formal properties of 

the surface form. 

3 Materials and Methods 

3.1 Corpus Characteristics 

We evaluate the approach on a set of terms ex-

tracted from a clinical corpus written in Belgian 

Dutch. This corpus consists of 4,426 EHRs, which 

were provided by a Belgian hospital. All of them 

relate to patients diagnosed with diabetes, who visit 

the hospital in regular intervals for routine check-

ups. The EHRs were exported from the clinical 

data warehouse and de-identified by the ICT team 

of the hospital. In particular, all personal infor-

mation concerning the patients themselves, their 

families, or members of clinical staff was removed. 

In addition, all researchers that had insight into the 

data signed confidentiality agreements with the 

hospital. 

All EHRs relate to individual clinical encoun-

ters. They were composed with a semi-structured 

template, which contains different sections relating 

to the individual stages of a consultation. These 

sections differ with regard to their thematic scope 

and communicative function, resulting in charac-

teristic semantic structures and stylistic properties. 

They can thus be considered distinct sublanguages. 

                                                           
3 While the original set of features was more extensive, we 

used a reduced version for the present study to create more 

realistic conditions. In a real-life scenario, it is unlikely that 

resources would be available for the manual coding of term 

features. Therefore, we only included those features that 

For example, the section complaints serves to as-

sess the current mental and physical condition. 

This section is composed in interaction with the pa-

tient, which manifests itself in the narrative style 

and a high proportion of lay terms. By contrast, the 

comments are used for the informal exchange 

among colleagues. This section is composed in a 

telegraphic style, containing a high proportion of 

ungrammatical constructions and jargon expres-

sions. Table 1 gives an overview of the sections and 

their characteristics. 

3.2 Semantic and Formal Annotation 

In an earlier project, all EHRs in the corpus were 

manually annotated with concept codes from 

SNOMED CT. After manual validation of the 

term-concept association, a total of 15,025 unique 

terms, relating to 7,687 different concepts, remain. 

All concepts were mapped to the semantic groups 

of the UMLS (McCray, Burgun, and Bodenreider 

2001). In a second pass, the terms obtained in the 

earlier stage were also annotated at the formal 

level. To this end, the unique terms were manually 

annotated with a set of binary features reflecting 

the term’s register, morpho-syntactical alternations 

and reduction processes. Table 2 gives an overview 

of the formal term features. 3 

Each term was inspected individually. For those 

features that applied to the term, a positive value 

was assigned; for the remaining features, the values 

remained negative by default. For example, the 

term hypotens ‘hypotensive’ would be assigned the 

following features: REGISTER – positive; REDUC-

TION – negative; MORPHO-SYNTACTIC VARIANT – 

positive.  

could be assigned automatically, e.g. by dictionary lookup 

or morphological analysis.

3.3 Composition of the Concept and Term 
Sample 

For the classification task, we focused on the five 

most frequently occurring semantic groups, 

namely DISORDERS, PROCEDURES, CONCEPTS & 

IDEAS, CHEMICALS & DRUGS and ANATOMY (cf. 

Table 3). For each group, the associated concepts 

were ranked by absolute frequency and the number 

of associated variants. Five concepts per group 

were chosen for the classification task. The final 

selection of concepts was based on the diversity of 

formal alternations observed in the associated var-

iants. For instance, a concept whose terms showed 

variation in both morpho-syntax and reduction 

(e.g. a noun phrase and a paraphrase, and an abbre-

viation and a full form) would be preferred over a 

concept whose terms only vary at the morpho-syn-

tactical level. Moreover, we aimed to compose the 

sample such that the full spectrum of the semantic 

class would be covered. For instance, for ANAT-

OMY, we chose concepts relating to visible body 

parts (e.g. leg) as well as internal organs (e.g. thy-

roid) The final sample consisted of 25 concepts. 

For each concept, the annotated terms were re-

trieved from our corpus and sorted by the section 

of occurrence. Concepts occurring with a fre-

quency of less than 500 within a section were ex-

cluded. Consequently, the number of semantic 

classes varies across sections. 

3.4 Experimental Setup 

We approached the categorization task as a multi-

class classification problem with multiple predic-

tors: Given the observation of a term in a particu-

lar section, predict the semantic category based on

ated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html  

the formal features. Our hypothesis is that the sub-

language features of each section influence the in-

formativity of the formal predictors. For example, 

in a narrative section like the complaints, MORPHO-

SYNTACTICAL features should be better predictors 

than in the medication, which contains few full 

sentences, but merely enumerates drugs and dos-

age instructions. On the other hand, the REDUC-

TION feature is likely more insightful in the com-

ments, which are dominated by informal expres-

sions, than in the conclusion, where well-formed 

expressions prevail. 

For the classification experiment, we used a Py-

thon implementation4 of the Random Forest Clas-

sifier (Breiman 2001). For each section, the list of 

annotated terms is split into a training and test set, 

containing 70% and 30% of all terms respectively. 

One model is trained and tested per section. To 

evaluate the results, we calculate the F1-score as 

well as the mean importance of the different pre-

dictor types.  

4 Results 

Overall, the best results were achieved in those sec-

tions that only contain a small number of target 

classes, namely the medication, therapy and exam-

ination. By contrast, the F1-values tend to be lower 

in those sections that are more diverse. On average, 

the MORPHO-SYNTACTIC features are the most im-

portant predictors, followed by the REGISTER fea-

ture. The REDUCTION feature, on the other hand, 

seems less informative overall. 

At the same time, the relative contribution of the 

feature types varies considerably across the sec-

tions: In the conclusion and history, REGISTER is

the strongest predictor; however, in the conclusion, 

the MORPHO-SYNTACTIC features are almost on par 

with REGISTER. While REDUCTION is most im-

portant in the comments, it also has a substantial 

effect in the examination. The MORPHO-SYNTAC-

TIC features make the strongest contribution in the 

complaints, therapy, anamnesis and medication; 

they are also strongest, but not quite as dominant, 

in the examination. Table 4 provides the full re-

sults.  

5 Discussion 

The results show that the semantic complexity of 

the respective sublanguage influences classifica-

tion performance. The best F1-scores were 

achieved in those sections devoted to a very con-

fined topic, while the values were lower in the 

more heterogeneous ones. This tendency corrobo-

rates the findings of previous work studying the ef-

fect of sublanguage properties on NLP in the clini-

cal domain (Doing-Harris et al. 2013). 

However, we found striking differences in the 

relative importance of the predictor types. On the 

whole, the contribution of the predictors patterns 

with the stylistic properties of the respective sub-

languages: For instance, MORPHO-SYNTACTIC fea-

tures are most informative in those sections com-

posed in a narrative style; REDUCTION is strongest 

in the informal parts of the document. This finding 

confirms our initial hypothesis. At a closer look, 

though, another effect emerges: In semantically 

homogeneous sections, infrequent features can 

serve to identify conceptual outliers. For instance, 

in the therapy-centered sections, which are domi-

nated by nouns relating to pharmaceutical sub-

stances, the presence of non-nominal morphologi-

cal properties, such as an adjective ending, is a 

strong predictor for a term belonging to another se-

mantic class, such as a temporal modifier. 

Our study has its limitations, as it only considers 

a very small sample of highly frequent concepts. 

Possibly, for low-frequency concepts, the formal 

features would not be informative enough to allow 

a reliable classification. Therefore, in future work, 

we plan to replicate the experiment at a larger 

scale, including a more diverse concept sample. 

Besides, in order to test the generalizability of the 

method, it would be interesting to evaluate the per-

formance on data from different clinical special-

ties, and from multiple clinical institutions. 

6 Conclusion 

We presented a first attempt for the classification 

of clinical terms by formal features alone. While 

there is much variation in the results, our experi-

ment demonstrates that sublanguage properties can 

be exploited to associate terms acquired from do-

main corpora with semantic categories. This ap-

proach could be integrated with other systems to 

support the enrichment of medical terminologies. 

In further research, we plan to replicate the study 

at a larger scale.
