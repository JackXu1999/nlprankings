Abstract
In the context of fake news, bias, and propa-
ganda, we study two important but relatively
under-explored problems: (i) trustworthiness
estimation (on a 3-point scale) and (ii) po-
litical ideology detection (left/right bias on a
7-point scale) of entire news outlets, as op-
posed to evaluating individual articles. In par-
ticular, we propose a multi-task ordinal re-
gression framework that models the two prob-
lems jointly. This is motivated by the obser-
vation that hyper-partisanship is often linked
to low trustworthiness, e.g., appealing to emo-
tions rather than sticking to the facts, while
center media tend to be generally more impar-
tial and trustworthy. We further use several
auxiliary tasks, modeling centrality, hyper-
partisanship, as well as left-vs.-right bias on
a coarse-grained scale. The evaluation results
show sizable performance gains by the joint
models over models that target the problems
in isolation.

1 Introduction

Recent years have seen the rise of social media,
which has enabled people to virtually share in-
formation with a large number of users without
regulation or quality control. On the bright side,
this has given an opportunity for anyone to be-
come a content creator, and has also enabled a
much faster information dissemination. However,
it has also opened the door for malicious users to
spread disinformation and misinformation much
faster, enabling them to easily reach audience at
a scale that was never possible before. In some
cases, this involved building sophisticated profiles
for individuals based on a combination of psycho-
logical characteristics, meta-data, demographics,
and location, and then micro-targeting them with
personalized “fake news” with the aim of achiev-
ing some political or financial gains (Lazer et al.,
2018; Vosoughi et al., 2018).

A number of fact-checking initiatives have been
launched so far, both manual and automatic, but
the whole enterprise remains in a state of cri-
sis: by the time a claim is finally fact-checked, it
could have reached millions of users, and the harm
caused could hardly be undone. An arguably more
promising direction is to focus on fact-checking
entire news outlets, which can be done in advance.
Then, we could fact-check the news before they
were even written: by checking how trustworthy
the outlets that published them are. Knowing the
reliability of a medium is important not only when
fact-checking a claim (Popat et al., 2017; Nguyen
et al., 2018), but also when solving article-level
tasks such as “fake news” and click-bait detection
(Brill, 2001; Finberg et al., 2002; Hardalov et al.,
2016; Karadzhov et al., 2017; De Sarkar et al.,
2018; Pan et al., 2018; Pérez-Rosas et al., 2018)

Political ideology (or left/right bias) is a related
characteristic, e.g., extreme left/right media tend
to be propagandistic, while center media are more
factual, and thus generally more trustworthy. This
connection can be clearly seen in Figure 1.

the news outlets in the Media Bias/Fact Check website.

Despite the connection between factuality and
bias, previous research has addressed them as in-
dependent tasks, even when the underlying dataset
had annotations for both (Baly et al., 2018). In
contrast, here we solve them jointly. Our contri-
butions can be summarized as follows:
• We study an under-explored but arguably im-

portant problem: predicting the factuality of
reporting of news media. Moreover, unlike
previous work, we do this jointly with the
task of predicting political bias.
• As factuality and bias are naturally defined on

an ordinal scale (factuality: from low to high,
and bias: from extreme-left to extreme-right),
we address them as ordinal regression. Us-
ing multi-task ordinal regression is novel for
these tasks, and it is also an under-explored
direction in machine learning in general.
• We design a variety of auxiliary subtasks

from the bias labels: modeling centrality,
hyper-partisanship, as well as left-vs.-right
bias on a coarse-grained scale.

2 Related Work

Factuality of Reporting Previous work has
modeled the factuality of reporting at the medium
level by checking the general stance of the tar-
get medium with respect to known manually fact-
checked claims, without access to gold labels
about the overall medium-level factuality of re-
porting (Mukherjee and Weikum, 2015; Popat
et al., 2016, 2017, 2018).

The trustworthiness of Web sources has also
been studied from a Data Analytics perspective,
e.g., Dong et al. (2015) proposed that a trust-
worthy source is one that contains very few false
claims. In social media, there has been research
targeting the user, e.g., finding malicious users
(Mihaylov and Nakov, 2016; Mihaylova et al.,
2018; Mihaylov et al., 2018), sockpuppets (Maity
et al., 2017), Internet water army (Chen et al.,
2013), and seminar users (Darwish et al., 2017).

Unlike the above work, here we study source
reliability as a task in its own right, using man-
ual gold annotations specific for the task and as-
signed by independent fact-checking journalists.
Moreover, we address the problem as one of ordi-
nal regression on a three-point scale, and we solve
it jointly with political ideology prediction in a
multi-task learning setup, using several auxiliary
tasks.

Predicting Political Ideology In previous work,
political ideology, also known as media bias, was
used as a feature for “fake news” detection (Horne
et al., 2018a). It has also been the target of
classification, e.g., Horne et al. (2018b) predicted
whether an article is biased (political or bias) vs.
unbiased. Similarly, Potthast et al. (2018) classi-
fied the bias in a target article as (i) left vs. right
vs. mainstream, or as (ii) hyper-partisan vs. main-
stream. Left-vs-right bias classification at the ar-
ticle level was also explored by Kulkarni et al.
(2018), who modeled both the textual and the URL
contents of the target article. There has been also
work targeting bias at the phrase or the sentence
level (Iyyer et al., 2014), focusing on political
speeches (Sim et al., 2013) or legislative docu-
ments (Gerrish and Blei, 2011), or targeting users
in Twitter (Preoţiuc-Pietro et al., 2017). Another
line of related work focuses on propaganda, which
can be seen as a form of extreme bias (Rashkin
et al., 2017; Barrón-Cedeño et al., 2019a,b). See
also a recent position paper (Pitoura et al., 2018)
and an overview paper on bias on the Web (Baeza-
Yates, 2018). Unlike the above work, here we fo-
cus on predicting the political ideology of news
media outlets.

In our previous work (Baly et al., 2018), we did
target the political bias of entire news outlets, as
opposed to working at the article level (we also
modeled factuality of reporting, but as a separate
task without trying multi-task learning). In addi-
tion to the text of the articles published by the tar-
get news medium, we used features extracted from
its corresponding Wikipedia page and Twitter pro-
file, as well as analysis of its URL structure and
traffic information about it from Alexa rank. In
the present work, we use a similar set of features,
but we treat the problem as one of ordinal regres-
sion. Moreover, we model the political ideology
and the factuality of reporting jointly in a multi-
task learning setup, using several auxiliary tasks.

Multitask Ordinal Regression Ordinal regres-
sion is well-studied and is commonly used for text
classification on an ordinal scale, e.g., for senti-
ment analysis on a 5-point scale (He et al., 2016;
Rosenthal et al., 2017a). However, multi-task or-
dinal regression remains an understudied problem.

Yu et al. (2006) proposed a Bayesian framework
for collaborative ordinal regression, and demon-
strated that modeling multiple ordinal regression
tasks outperforms single-task models.



2111

Walecki et al. (2016) were interested in jointly
predicting facial action units and their intensity
level. They argued that, due to the high num-
ber of classes, modeling these tasks independently
would be inefficient. Thus, they proposed the cop-
ula ordinal regression model for multi-task learn-
ing and demonstrated that it can outperform vari-
ous single-task setups. We use this model in our
experiments below.

Balikas et al. (2017) used multi-task ordinal
regression for the task of fine-grained sentiment
analysis. In particular, they introduced an auxil-
iary coarse-grained task on a 3-point scale, and
demonstrated that it can improve the results for
sentiment analysis on the original 5-point scale.
Inspired by this, below we experiment with dif-
ferent granularity for political bias; however, we
explore a larger space of possible auxiliary tasks.

3 Method

Copula Ordinal Regression We use the Cop-
ula Ordinal Regression (COR) model, which was
originally proposed by Walecki et al. (2016) to es-
timate the intensities of facial action units (AUs).
The model uses copula functions and conditional
random fields (CRFs) to approximates the learning
of the joint probability distribution function (PDF)
of the facial AUs (random variables), using the bi-
variate joint distributions capturing dependencies
between AU pairs. It was motivated by the fact
that (i) many facial AUs co-exist with different
levels of intensity, (ii) some AUs co-occur more
often than others, and (iii) some AUs depend on
the intensity of other units.

We can draw an analogy between modeling fa-
cial AUs and modeling news media, where each
medium expresses a particular bias (political ide-
ology) and can also be associated with a particu-
lar level of factuality. Therefore, bias and factual-
ity can be analogous to the facial AUs in (Walecki
et al., 2016), and represent two aspects of news re-
porting, each being modeled on a multi-point ordi-
nal scale. In particular, we model bias on a 7-point
scale (extreme-left, left, center-left, center, center-
right, right, and extreme-right), and factuality on
a 3-point scale (low, mixed, and high).

In our case, we train the COR model to predict
the joint PDF between political bias and factual-
ity of reporting. This could potentially work well
given the inherent inter-dependency between the
two tasks as we have seen on Figure 1.

Auxiliary Tasks We use a variety of auxiliary
tasks, derived from the bias labels. This includes
converting the 7-point scale to (i) 5-point and 3-
point scales, similarly to (Balikas et al., 2017), and
to (ii) a 2-point scale in two ways to model ex-
treme partisanship, and centrality. Here is the list
of the auxiliary tasks we use with precise defini-
tion of the label mappings:
• Bias5-way: Predict bias on a 5-pt scale;

1:extreme-left, 2:left, 3:{center-left, center,
center-right}, 4:right, and 5:extreme-right.
• Bias3-way: Predict bias on a 3-pt scale;

1:{extreme-left, left}, 2:{center-left, center,
center-right}, and 3:{right, extreme-right}.
• Bias-extreme: Predict extreme vs. non-

extreme partisanship on a 2-pt scale;
1:{extreme-left, extreme-right}, 2:{left,
center-left, center, center-right, right}.
• Bias-center: Predict center vs. non-center

political ideology on a 2-pt scale, ignoring
polarity: 1:{extreme-left, left, right, extreme-
right}, 2:{center-left, center, center-right}.

Features We used the features from (Baly et al.,
2018)1. We gathered a sample of articles from the
target medium, and we calculated features such as
POS tags, linguistic cues, sentiment scores, com-
plexity, morality, as well as embeddings. We also
used the Wikipedia page of the medium (if any)
to generate document embedding. Then, we col-
lected metadata from the medium’s Twitter ac-
count (if any), e.g., whether is is verified, num-
ber of followers, whether the URL in the Twitter
page matches the one of the medium. Finally, we
added Web-based features that (i) model the ortho-
graphic structure of the medium’s URL address,
and (ii) analyze the Web-traffic information about
the medium’s website, as found in Alexa rank.2

4 Experiments and Evaluation

Data We used the MBFC dataset (Baly et al.,
2018) that has 1,066 news media manually anno-
tated for factuality (3-pt scale: high, mixed, low)
and political bias (7-pt scale: from extreme-left to
extreme-right). This dataset was annotated by vol-
unteers using a detailed methodology3 that is de-
signed to guarantee annotation objectivity.

Furthermore, readers can provide their own feed-
back on existing annotations, and in case of a large
discrepancy, annotation is adjusted after a thor-
ough review. Therefore, we believe the annotation
quality is good enough to experiment with. We
noticed that 117 media had low factuality because
they publish satire and pseudo-science, neither of
which has a political perspective. Since we are in-
terested in modeling the relation between factual-
ity and bias, we excluded those websites, thus end-
ing up with 949 news media. Some examples from
this dataset are shown in Table 1 with both factual-
ity and bias labels, in addition to their correspond-
ing Twitter handles and Wikipedia pages. Overall,
64% of the media in our dataset have Wikipedia
pages, and 65% have Twitter accounts. Table 2
further provides detailed statistics about the label
distribution in the MBFC dataset.

Experimental Setup We used the implementa-
tion4 of the Copula Ordinal Regression (COR)
model as described in (Walecki et al., 2016). In
our experiments, we used 5-fold cross-validation,
where for each fold we split the training dataset
into a training part and a validation part, and we
used the latter to fine-tune the model’s hyper-
parameters, optimizing for Mean Absolute Error
(MAE). MAE is an appropriate evaluation mea-
sure given the ordinal nature of the tasks.

4https://github.com/RWalecki/copula_
ordinal_regression

These hyper-parameters include the copula func-
tion (Gumbel vs. Frank), the marginal distribution
(normal vs. sigmoid), the number of training it-
erations, the optimizer (gradient descent, BFGS),
and the connection density of the CRFs. We report
both MAE and MAEM , which is a variant of MAE
that is more robust to class imbalance. See (Bac-
cianella et al., 2009; Rosenthal et al., 2017b) for
more details about MAEM vs. MAE. We compare
the results to two baselines: (i) majority class, and
(ii) single-task ordinal regression.

Results and Discussion Table 3 shows the eval-
uation results for the COR model when trained
to jointly model the main task (shown in the
columns) using combinations of auxiliary tasks
(shown in the rows). We can see that the single-
task ordinal regression model performs much bet-
ter than the majority class baseline based on both
evaluation measures. We can further see that
the performance on the main task improves when
jointly modeling several auxiliary tasks. This im-
provement depends on the auxiliary tasks in use.

For factuality prediction, it turns out that the
combination of bias-center+bias-extreme yields
the best overall MAE of 0.481. This makes sense
and aligns well with the intuition that knowing
whether a medium is centric or hyper-partisan is
important to predict the factuality of its reporting.
For instance, a news medium without a political
ideology tends to be more trustworthy compared
to an extremely biased one, regardless of their po-
larity (left or right), as we should expect based on
the data distribution shown in Figure 1 above.

For bias prediction (at a 7-point left-to-right
scale), a joint model that uses political bias at dif-
ferent levels of granularity (5-point and 3-point)
as auxiliary tasks yields the best overall MAE of
1.479. This means that jointly modeling bias with
the same information at coarser levels of granu-
larity, i.e., adding 3-point and 5-point as auxiliary
tasks, reduces the number of gross mistakes.

Table 3: Evaluating the copula ordinal regression model trained to jointly model the main task (shown in the
columns) and different auxiliary tasks (shown in the rows). The results in parentheses correspond to the case when
factuality is added as an additional auxiliary task (only applicable when the main task is bias prediction).

E.g., predicting extreme-left instead of extreme-
right, since the model is encouraged by the aux-
iliary tasks to learn the correct polarity, regard-
less of its intensity. We can see that factuality
is not very useful as an auxiliary task by itself
(MAE=1.584 and MAEM=1.695). In other words,
a medium with low factuality could be extremely
biased to either the right or to the left. Therefore,
relying on factuality alone to predict bias might in-
troduce severe errors, e.g., confusing extreme-left
with extreme-right, thus leading to higher MAE
scores. This can be remedied by adding factuality
to the mix of other auxiliary tasks to model the
main task (7-point bias prediction). The results
of these experiments, shown in parentheses in Ta-
ble 3, indicate that adding factuality to any combi-
nation of auxiliary tasks consistently yields lower
MAE scores. In particular, modeling the combi-
nation of factuality+bias5-way+bias3-way yields
the best results (MAE=1.475 and MAEM=1.623).
This result indicates that factuality provides com-
plementary information that can help predict bias.

We ran a two-tailed t-test for statistical signif-
icance, which is suitable for an evaluation mea-
sure such as MAE, to confirm the improvements
that were introduced by the multi-task setup. We
found that the best models (shown in bold in Ta-
ble 3) outperformed both the corresponding major-
ity class baselines with a p-value ≤ 0.001, and the
corresponding single-task ordinal regression base-
lines with a p-value ≤ 0.02.

Finally, we compared the above results to our
previous work (Baly et al., 2018) by independently
training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classi-
fier for each task, using the same features.

The resulting MAE was 0.450 for factuality and
1.184 for bias prediction, which is slightly better
then our results (yet, very comparable for factual-
ity). However, our goal here is to emphasize the
advantages of modeling the two tasks jointly.

5 Conclusion and Future Work

We have presented a multi-task ordinal regres-
sion framework for jointly predicting trustworthi-
ness and political ideology of news media sources,
using several auxiliary tasks, e.g., based on a
coarser-grained scales or modeling extreme parti-
sanship. Overall, we have observed sizable per-
formance gains in terms of reduced MAE by the
multi-task ordinal regression models over single-
task models for each of the two individual tasks.

In future work, we want to try more auxiliary
tasks, and to experiment with other languages. We
further plan to go beyond left vs. right, which is
not universal and can exhibit regional specificity
(Tavits and Letki, 2009), and to model other kinds
of biases, e.g., eurosceptic vs. europhile, national-
ist vs. globalist, islamist vs. secular, etc.
