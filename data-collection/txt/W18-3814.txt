Abstract

Translation relations, which distinguish literal translation from other translation techniques, con-
stitute an important subject of study for human translators (Chuquet and Paillard, 1989). How-
ever, automatic processing techniques based on interlingual relations, such as machine translation
or paraphrase generation exploiting translational equivalence, have not made use of these rela-
tions explicitly until now. In this work, we present a categorization of translation relations and
then we annotate a parallel multilingual (English, French, Chinese) corpus of oral presentations,
the TED Talks, with these relations. Our long-term objective will be to automatically detect these
relations in order to integrate them as important characteristics for the search of monolingual seg-
ments in relation of equivalence (paraphrases) or of entailment. The annotated corpus resulting
from our work will be made available to the community.

1 Introduction

Human translators have studied translation relations since a long time (Vinay and Darbelnet, 1958; Chu-
quet and Paillard, 1989), which categorize different translation techniques apart from literal translations.
But to the best of our knowledge, no automatic processing techniques explicitly implement these inter-
lingual relations.

As an important natural language understanding and generation task, machine translation (MT) has
been seriously improved with first phrase-based statistical machine translation (PBMT) then recently
with neural machine translation (NMT). MT has also been exploited to generate paraphrases from bilin-
gual parallel corpus, which was originally proposed by Bannard and Callison-Burch (2005). The as-
sumption is that two segments in the same language are potential paraphrases if they share common
translations in a foreign language. Currently the largest resource of paraphrases, PPDB (Paraphrase
Database) (Ganitkevitch et al., 2013), has been built following this method exploiting translational equiv-
alence. Nonetheless, the work of Pavlick et al. (2015) revealed that there exist other relations than strict
equivalence (paraphrase) in PPDB (i.e. Entailment (in two directions), Exclusion, Other related and In-
dependent). The existence of these other relations in PPDB reflects the lack of semantic control during
the paraphrasing process.

We propose a categorization of translation relations which model human translators’ choices, and we
annotate a multilingual (English, French, Chinese) parallel corpus of oral presentations, the TED Talks1,
with these relations. The annotation is still ongoing and we are developing a classifier based on these
annotations to conduct automatic detection. Our further goal is to integrate this information as important
characteristics for the search of monolingual segments in relation of equivalence (paraphrases) or of
entailment.

After presenting the related work in section 2, we describe our parallel corpus of TED Talks (section 3)
and the translation relations (section 4). The annotation process and the statistics follow in section 5.
Contrastive study between target languages is presented in section 6. Finally, we conclude in section 7.

2 Related work

Deng and Xue (2017) have studied the divergences present in English-Chinese machine translation, by
using a hierarchical alignment scheme between the parse trees of these two languages. Seven types
of divergences have been identified, and some of them cause important difficulties for automatic word
alignment. In particular, we can underline lexical differences resulting from non-literal translations, and
structural differences between languages (with or without change of types of syntagms). In order to sup-
ply a particular dataset of multiword expressions (MWE) for evaluating machine translation, Monti et al.
(2015) have annotated specifically these expressions in the English-Italian TED Talks corpus, associated
with their translation generated by an automatic system. The phenomena discussed in these two studies
are included in the translation relations that we present in this article.

PARSEME (PARSing and Multiword Expressions) 2 is a European scientific network built up to elab-
orate universal terminologies and annotation guidelines for MWEs in 18 languages (Savary et al., 2015).
Its main outcome is a multilingual 5-million word annotated corpus, which underlies a shared task on
automatic identification of verbal MWEs (Savary et al., 2017). Our trilingual annotated corpus focuses
on bilingual relation between translations, and we annotate all words in the corpus, including continuous
and discontinuous MWEs.

As a complement of MT evaluation metrics, which reflect imperfectly systems’ performance, Isabelle
et al. (2017) have introduced a challenge set based on difficult linguistic materials. The authors could
hence determine some remaining difficulties for recent NMT systems. The problems include, in par-
ticular, incomplete generalizations; translating common and syntactically flexible idioms, or crossing
movement verbs e.g. swim across X → traverser X à la nage. The annotated corpus that we present here
could also constitute a challenge set, for the purpose of evaluating MT systems when human translators
resort to different translation relations.

3 Corpus

In order to study translation relations for several pairs of languages, we have worked on a multilingual
parallel corpus. This corpus is available from the Web inventory WIT3 (Cettolo et al., 2012), which gives
access to a collection of transcribed and translated talks, including the corpus of TED Talks3. This corpus
was released for the evaluation campaign IWSLT 2013 and 2014.4 The source language, i.e. the original
language in which the speakers expressed themselves, is English. We have calculated the intersection
of a parallel corpus with translations in French5, Chinese, Arabic, Spanish and Russian. The translation
of subtitles for TED Talks is controlled by volunteers and language coordinators per language6, which
generally ensures good quality translations. The corpus to be annotated contains 2 436 lines of parallel
sentences for each pair of languages (the English corpus contains 51 926 tokens). For the moment, we
annotate English-French and English-Chinese corpora to validate our hierarchy of translation relations,
since these two target languages are very dissimilar in several linguistic aspects: morphology, grammar,
expression, etc.

For English and French languages, the corpus has been tokenized by Stanford Tokenizer7, and lemma-
tized by TreeTagger (Schmid, 1995) while keeping the tokenization of Stanford Tokenizer. The capital
letters at the beginning of each sentence are kept only if these words always appear with capital initials
elsewhere in the corpus, otherwise they are lowercased. We have used the tool THULAC (Li and Sun,
2009) for the segmentation of the Chinese corpus, and proceeded to several corrections before anno-
tation. The words are automatically aligned by training FastAlign (Dyer et al., 2013), with its default
parameters on each entire parallel corpus (i.e. 163 092 lines and 3 303 660 English tokens). We import

these automatic alignments before annotation to accelerate the process, in particular for the words which
are literally translated. The annotators should correct these alignments if necessary.

4 Translation relations

Figure 1: Hierarchy of translation relations.

The first attempt to establish a taxonomy of translation procedures has been carried out by Vinay
and Darbelnet (1958). The hierarchy of translation relations that we propose here is based on theories
clarified in the work of Chuquet and Paillard (1989), and on phenomena found during our initial study
of the corpus (see figure 1).

The colored nodes represent our categories, the other nodes present the hierarchy (i.e. Non-Literal,
Unaligned, Modulation, No Type) or the phenomena more specific but for which there is no dedicated
label (e.g. Remove Metaphor, Other Generalization). We present below their definition and typical
examples:

1. Literal translation: word-for-word translation (including insertion or deletion of determiners,
changes between singular and plural forms), or possible literal translation of some idioms:

What time is it? → Quelle heure est-il ?, facts are stubborn → les faits sont têtus

2. Equivalence:

i) non-literal translation of proverbs, idioms, or fixed expressions:

Birds of a feather flock together. → Qui se ressemble s’assemble.
ii) semantic equivalence in supra-lexical level, translation of terms:

magic trick → tour de magie, hatpin → épingle à chapeau

3. Modulation: consists in changing the point of view, either to circumvent a translation difficulty
or to reveal a way of seeing things, specific to the speakers of the target language. This category
could result in semantic shift between source text and target text. Apart from its two sub-types
Particularization and Generalization, all the other phenomena are represented by the sub-type Other
Modulation:

this is a completely unsustainable pattern → il est absolument impossible de continuer sur cette
tendance, I had an assignment → on m’avait confié une mission

4. Particularization: the translation is more precise or presents a more concrete sense:

the director said → le directeur déclara, language loss → l’extinction du langage

5. Generalization: this category contains three sub-types, but we annotate them with the same label:

i) the translation is more general or neutral; in other cases, this translation technique makes the
sense more accessible in the target language:



105

look carefully at → regardez, as we sit here in ... → alors que nous sommes à ...

ii) translation of an idiom by a non-fixed expression:

trial and error → procéder par tâtonnements

iii) removal of a metaphorical image:

ancient Tairona civilization which once carpeted the Caribbean coastal plain → anciennes civil-
isations tyranniques qui occupaient jadis la plaine côtière des Caraïbes

6. Transposition: translating words or expressions by using other grammatical categories than the ones
used in the source language, without altering the meaning of the utterance:

astonishingly inquisitive → dotée d’une curiosité stupéfiante

patients over the age of 40 → les malades ayant dépassé l’âge de 40 ans

7. Modulation plus Transposition: this category can contain any sub-type of Modulation combined
with Transposition:

this is a people who cognitively do not distinguish → c’est un peuple dont l’état des connais-
sances ne permet pas de faire la distinction

8. Idiom: translate non-fixed expression by an idiom (frequently used when translating English to
Chinese):

at any given moment → à un instant "t"

died getting old →行将就木 "getting closer and closer to the coffin"

9. Metaphor: this category contains two sub-types reduced to only one label:

i) keep the same metaphorical image by using a non-literal translation:

the Sun begins to bathe the slopes of the landscape → le soleil qui inonde les flancs de ce paysage

ii) introduce metaphorical expression to translate non-metaphor:

if you faint easily → si vous tombez dans les pommes facilement

10. Unaligned - Explicitation:

i) resumptive anaphora (Charolles, 2002): add a phrase or sentence summarizing the preceding in-
formation (which could be present in previous sentence), to help understanding the present sentence.

ii) introduce in the target language clarifications that remain implicit in the source language but
emerge from the situation; add language-specific function words:

feel their past in the wind → ressentent leur passé souffler dans le vent

an entire book → 一本本本完整的书 (add the Chinese classifier本)

11. Unaligned - Simplification: remove deliberately certain content words in translation:

and you’ll suddenly discover what it would be like → et vous découvrirez ce que ce serait

12. Unaligned and no type attributed: function words necessary in one language but not in the other;
segments not translated but which don’t impact the meaning; segments giving repeated information
in context; translated segments which don’t correspond to any source segment:

minus 271 degrees, colder than → moins 271 degrés, ce qui est plus froid

the last example I have time to → le dernier exemple que j’ai le temps de

5 Annotation

5.1 Annotation tool and configuration

We have used the Web application Yawat8 (Germann, 2008), which allows us to align words or segments
(continuous or discontinuous), and then to assign labels adapted to our task on monolingual or bilingual
units (see figure 2).

Figure 2: Annotation interface of Yawat.

Here is a trilingual example from our corpus:

well, we use that great euphemism, "trial and error", which is exposed to be meaningless.

eh bien, nous employons cet euphémisme, procéder par tâtonnements, qui est dénué de sens.

我们 "we"普通人 "ordinary people"会 "particle for future tense"做 "do"各种各样 "diverse"的
"particle for attribute" 实验 "experience" 不断 "continuously" 地 "particle for adverb" 犯 错 误
"make a mistake"结果 "consequently"却 "however"一无所获 "have gained nothing"

The segments well and we use that great euphemism are translated literally in French (with "great"
omitted), but they are omitted in Chinese. The idiom trial and error is translated by a generalization in
the two languages. The segment which is exposed to be is translated by a generalization in French (est
"is") and by a modulation in Chinese (结果 "consequently"却 "however"). The adjective meaningless
is translated by a transposition in French (dénué de sens "lacking meaning") and by an idiom of four
characters in Chinese (一无所获 "have gained nothing").

The spelling errors in the original corpus have not been corrected, because on one hand, there are not
many of them, on the other hand, generally they don’t prevent us from assigning labels. Nonetheless, we
have included a category Uncertain for pairs for which the annotators don’t know which label to assign,
or for those which contain obvious translation errors.

Three annotators 9 have participated in the annotation. The training of annotators relies on an anno-
tation guide which defines all categories illustrated by giving characteristic examples. The hierarchy of
relations provides a general view of relations between these categories. To better understand the context,
the annotators could watch the corresponding video of talks10 before annotating.

5.2 Control study

We have evaluated in a conventional way the feasibility of our annotation task, by measuring the inter-
annotator agreement on a control corpus, which contains 100 pairs of trilingual parallel sentences (3 055
English tokens, 3 238 French tokens and 4 195 Chinese characters). For each pair of languages (EN-FR
and EN-ZH), two annotators have independently annotated the corpus.

Since there exist disagreements on the boundary of certain segments, we have calculated the agreement
of Cohen’s Kappa (Cohen, 1960) only for the segments annotated with exactly the same boundaries by
two annotators. The value 0.672 signifies a substantial agreement for the pair EN-FR, while EN-ZH has
a lower agreement (0.61, the minimum value to be considered as substantial). The number of tokens

Chinese control corpus.

107

annotated in segments with same boundaries represent 72.60% of English tokens for EN-FR, but only
52.76% for EN-ZH.

We also calculate another inter-annotator agreement in a more flexible way, by including the pairs with
different but compatible boundaries (i.e. without overlap of boundaries), and with a common category.11

In this scenario, while the coverage of English tokens increase to 85.56% for EN-FR and 74.10% for
EN-ZH, the Kappa decreases to 0.617 for EN-FR and to 0.60 (moderate) for EN-ZH. The remaining
tokens belong to segments with incompatible boundaries (see table 1 and table 2).

Table 1: EN-FR inter-annotator agreement.

κ %EN tokens

strict 0.61 52.76%
flexible 0.60 74.10%

Table 2: EN-ZH inter-annotator agreement.

We have compared the annotations of two annotators in a confusion matrix. There exist certain dis-
agreements between Literal and these categories: Equivalence (e.g. in this way → de cette façon), Mod-
ulation (e.g. this entire time → tout ce temps), Particularization (e.g. snuff → tabac) and Transposition
(e.g. their prayers alone → seulement leurs prières). However, our categories Equivalence and Literal
are very close, and Particularization is a sub-type of Modulation, consequently we could consider these
confusions as acceptable in a more flexible measure. Modulation presents the majority of confusions
with Literal and Transposition (e.g. from the forest floor → tombées par terre), which indicates that
it is necessary to better explain their differences when training annotators. Mod+Trans is a combined
type for which certain annotators perceive sometimes only one of these two types (e.g. a great distance
→ de loin). Metaphor is the origin of several disagreements (e.g. at the base of glaciers → aux pieds
des glaciers), which could mainly be explained by the difficulty of the annotation task for a non-native
annotator of the target language.

5.3 Annotation scheme with several passes

The calculation of inter-annotator agreement enables certain standard interpretations on the control cor-
pus, and the confusion matrix helps us to identify the difficulties of the task. For the purpose of converg-
ing on boundaries of segments and on attributions of labels, we have adopted an annotation scheme with
several passes to ensure a better annotation quality. For each subcorpus12, the first annotator conducts a
first annotation of all categories, then the second annotator takes over, which allows him/her to modify
the alignments and/or the categories in case of disagreement. Each annotation file is saved at the end of
each pass to document the differences in annotation. This alternation can be repeated until the conver-
gence of all annotations. In practice, we limit ourselves to 3 passes, the third one being accomplished
by the first annotator. We observe that the number of modifications in the third pass drop gradually with
the documents annotated, which reflects a progressive and fast adaptation of annotators to the task. This
annotation scheme is cost-intensive, but has been made necessary by the quality intended, as well as by
the inherent difficulties of segmentation observed in the control corpus.

5.4 Statistics of annotated subcorpora

Apart from two control corpora, we have annotated six English-French subcorpora and three English-
Chinese subcorpora. Their statistics are presented in table 3. Table 4 shows a distribution of number of
tokens annotated in different translation relations for English-French corpus.

11For example, I was asked by and I was asked by my professor at Harvard have both been annotated by Modulation, and
my professor at Harvard has been annotated with Literal by the first annotator. Here we consider that the two boundaries are
compatible, and there is an agreement between the two annotators on one segment (the longest one), because of the common
category Modulation.

12Each subcorpus represents one or several complete speeches of TED Talks, in order to ensure better understanding of the
context.

6 Contrast between target languages

We present comparative statistics based on three annotated trilingual subcorpora (see table 5). English
and French languages are very similar in grammar and syntax, but Chinese translators should often
change word or even phrase order to adapt the translation.

We can see that there are fewer English tokens translated into Chinese using literal translation. For
Equivalence, Modulation and Transposition, the proportions are not so different, but the boundaries of
segments could be different. Chinese translations use less complicated Modulation+Transposition, but
they resort much often to Generalization and Particularization. In general, Idiom and Metaphor are
under-represented in both target languages, but translating by using a Chinese idiom in four characters
is considered as a good practice, which result in a concise language style and translations adapted to
Chinese culture. Simplification and Explicitation show clear differences with French translations. Chi-
nese translations often render only the most important information and leave some other content phrases
non-translated. Concerning Explicitation, this includes adding necessary Chinese classifiers; inserting
content words (e.g. subject noun phrase) to keep the phrase grammatical instead of translating literally
word by word and some instances of resumptive anaphora (see section 4). There exist also more in-
stances of Uncertain, together with Simplification, these phenomena reflect that the quality of Chinese
translations are not as good as French translations. Many more English words do not have any type
attributed because of the big differences in grammar. At the same time, Chinese translations are more
concise than the transcriptions of oral English, which results in the omission of many English transition
words.

Here are some examples:
1) EN: We had to worry about the lawyers and so on.
FR: On a dû se préoccuper des avocats et des trucs dans le genre.
"We had to worry about the lawyers and things like that." (Literal, Modulation+Transposition)
ZH: 要顾及到很多法律问题 "have to worry about many legal issues" (Generalization)
2) EN: pressured the people a little bit about it
FR: obliger le peuple à en parler "force the people to talk about it" (Modulation)
ZH:刨根问底 "inquire into the root of the matter" (Idiom)
3) EN: and it doesn’t matter how much information we’re looking at, how big these collections are or

how big the images are.
FR: et ce quelle que soit la quantité d’informations que l’on visionne, la taille de ces collections ou la

taille des images.
"regardless of the amount of information viewed, the size of the collections or the size of the images."

(Modulation+Transposition)

sentence)

7 Conclusion and perspectives

In this work we are interested in translation relations, to our best knowledge, they have never been
taken into account in machine translation as well as in paraphrase generation by exploiting translational
equivalence. We categorized these relations and annotated them in a multilingual parallel corpus of TED
Talks. We chose this specific genre (transcribed and translated speech) in order to obtain more diversity
than with the technical corpora. The measured inter-annotator agreement is strong for segments with the
same boundaries, but we have adopted a more time-consuming annotation process with three passes to
ensure better annotation quality.

A parallel task with our corpus annotation is the development of a classifier to automatically detect
these relations. Our long-term objective will be to have a better semantic control using this information
as important characteristics to exploit translational equivalence, for the search of monolingual segments
in relation of equivalence (paraphrases) or of entailment.

We think that there exist many other types of applications for this corpus, for example: evaluate
machine translation or automatic word alignment for different translation relations, like the work of Is-
abelle et al. (2017); understand what are the characteristics of non-literal translations in order to improve
machine translation to generate natural and native expressions; provide a concordancer for translation
studies to investigate different translation relations. We could also supply pre-processed parallel corpora
in other languages (Arabic, Spanish and Russian) for those who are interested to enrich annotation and
comparative studies.
