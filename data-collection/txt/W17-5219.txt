Abstract

As a discipline of Natural Language Pro-
cessing, Sentiment Analysis is used to ex-
tract and analyze subjective information
present in natural language data. The task
of Sentiment Analysis has acquired wide
commercial uses including social media
monitoring tasks, survey responses, re-
view systems, etc. Languages like English
have several resources which aid in the
task of Sentiment Analysis. SentiWord-
Net and Subjectivity WordList are exam-
ples of such tools and resources. With
more data being available in native vernac-
ular, language-specific SentiWordNet(s)
have become essential. For resource poor
languages, creating such SentiWordNet(s)
is a difficult task to achieve. One solu-
tion is to use available resources in En-
glish and translate the final source lexi-
con to target lexicon via machine transla-
tion. Machine translation systems for the
English-Odia language pair have not yet
been developed. In this paper, we discuss a
method to create a SentiWordNet for Odia,
which is resource-poor, by only using re-
sources which are currently available for
Indian languages. The lexicon created,
would serve as a tool for Sentiment Anal-
ysis related task specific to Odia data.

1 Introduction

For resource-poor languages, one popular ap-
proach is to use readily available resources in En-
glish to generate a source lexicon. The source
lexicon is then translated using a Machine Trans-
lation system or a bilingual dictionary to create
the final target lexicon (Bakliwal et al., 2012). In
case of the English-Odia language pair, a good

Machine Translation system is absent. The on-
line bilingual dictionaries for the same have very
few word pairs. Manual translation is expensive
in terms of human resource and time. Another ap-
proach is to use available parallel corpora for the
language pair and use a word-alignment tool in or-
der to get a one-to-one mapping between words.
For this method, a sufficiently large corpus is re-
quired in order to get an appropriate number of
unique word pairs. Such a large corpus is unavail-
able for the English-Odia language pair. In fact,
larger corpora is available for Odia and other In-
dian language pairs. WordNets developed under
the IndoWordNet structure (Bhattacharyya, 2010)
do not map words directly but they match synsets
instead. These WordNets for Indian languages
serve well in translation from source to target lex-
icon. The SentiWordNets present for such Indian
languages helps in assignment of polarity to the
final collection of words.

Odia SentiWordNet is built using WordNets
and SentiWordNets available for other Indian lan-
guages. WordNets include those of Bengali,
Tamil, Telugu and Odia itself. SentiWordNets
used include those of Bengali, Tamil and Telugu.

The paper is divided into various sections. Sec-
tion 2 comprises of previous work and progress
towards building SentiWordNets for Indian lan-
guages. Section 3 describes resources used for cre-
ation of Odia SentiWordNet. Section 4 contains a
detailed explanation of procedure followed for the
same and defines the evaluation scheme for ver-
ification of resource thus created. An insight on
future work and extensibility of the SentiWordNet
is provided in Section 5.

2 Previous Work

Since its introduction in 1961 by IBM, Sentiment
Analysis has been a fast growing area in computer

143



science. Research on Sentiment Analysis began in
English. However with increasing demand, sev-
eral researchers have developed various tools and
resources for many other languages. Odia (ISO
639 language code: ori)1, being a resource-poor
language, lacks necessary tools to perform Senti-
ment Analysis.

Since opinion mining has proved extremely use-
ful in online review and survey systems and since
data is more readily available than ever, Sentiment
Analysis serves as an effective method to achieve
automated scoring of products, movies, etc.

Turney worked on classifying customer reviews
(Turney, 2002). They adopt an unsupervised
learning technique to predict the semantic ori-
entation of phrases. Hatzivassiloglou (Hatzivas-
siloglou and R. McKeown, 1997) and Turney (Tur-
ney and Littman, 2003) describe methods of using
a set of words gathered a priori as a seed list to
classify the semantic orientation of phrases. The
former method (Hatzivassiloglou and R. McKe-
own, 1997) was the first to deal with opinion clas-
sification in phrases. The approach mainly uses
adjectives for Sentiment Analysis. However, suf-
ficient pre-processing was carried out using avail-
able tools for English before the phrases were suc-
cessfully classified.

Even though sentiment depends on context, lex-
ical resources have proven to give a good baseline
for further studies. The English language has sev-
eral lexical resources such as the SentiWordNet as
described by Esuli (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006). It
contains over 3 million tokens assigned with po-
larity and objectivity score. The resource has been
improved over the years as demonstrated in liter-
ature (Baccianella et al., 2010). Another such im-
portant resource is the Subjectivity Lexicon (Wil-
son et al., 2005) which is a part of OpinionFinder2.

Languages which have a scarcity of readily
available data depend on resource rich languages
to build such lexicons. Whalley (Whalley and
Medagoda, 2015) describes how the Sinhalese
sentiment lexicon was created using the English
SentiWordNet 3.0. The SentiWordNet in En-
glish was mapped to a Sinhalese dictionary and
the scores were copied from one language to an-
other. Another way to achieve this is by linking
the WordNets of the source and target language.
Joshi proposed a method to create a SentiWordNet

1http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/codes.asp
2http://mpqa.cs.pitt.edu/opinionfinder/

for Hindi by linking the English and Hindi Word-
Nets and assigning scores to the synsets in Hindi
WordNet (Joshi et al., 2010). Dipankar Das sug-
gested a method to develop WordNet affect lists
in Bengali using affect wordlists already available
in English. (Das and B, 2010). The method uses
a bilingual dictionary to translate words from En-
glish to Bengali. Amitava Das (Das and Bandy-
opadhyay, 2010) (Das and Gambäck, 2012) (Das
and Bandyopadhyay, 2011) proposes several ways
to generate such lexical resources for other In-
dian languages. One approach suggests the usage
of both English SentiWordNet 3.0 and Subjectiv-
ity Lexicon and adopting a translation based ap-
proach in order to build the lexicon in three In-
dian languages (Das and Bandyopadhyay, 2010).
A SentiWordNet for Tamil has also been devel-
oped using a similar translation based approach for
currently available resources in English (Kannan
et al., 2016). Due to lack of a sufficiently large par-
allel corpus or a bilingual dictionary, direct trans-
lation techniques from English to Odia could not
be applied in-order to build the SentiWordNet in
Odia.

3 Prerequisites

For creating Odia SentiWordNet, SentiWordNets
of three Indian languages, namely Bengali, Tamil
and Telugu are used. Polarity of words for these
resources has proved to be reliable (Das and
Bandyopadhyay, 2010). Multiple SentiWordNets
are used for a better estimate of sentiment for each
word and reduction of ambiguities while building
the resource. For creation of lexicon for Odia,
WordNets for Odia and the other three Indian lan-
guages are used. These WordNets have synsets
linked via a common synset identification number
(ID), without direct word-to-word mapping. The
resources used are described below.

3.1 SentiWordNets for Indian Languages

SentiWordNet is a lexical resource explicitly de-
vised for supporting sentiment classification and
opinion mining applications. According to Bac-
cianella, SentiWordNet is the result of the auto-
matic annotation of all the synsets of WordNet
towards the notions of positivity, negativity, and
neutrality (Baccianella et al., 2010). Each synset
is associated with three numerical scores : pos(s),
neg(s), and obj(s) which indicate positive, nega-
tive, and objective i.e., neutral respectively. Senti-

144



WordNets for Bengali, Telugu and Tamil were cre-
ated using Das’s approach (Das and Bandyopad-
hyay, 2010). Each of these comprises of four lists
under the categories of ”Positive”, ”Negative”,
”Neutral” and ”Ambiguous” which contain words
of positive, negative, neutral polarity and ambigu-
ous words, respectively. The Parts-of-Speech tag
information for each word is also provided. Ta-
ble 1 gives detailed statistics for each of the Senti-
WordNets used.

Telugu 2136 4076 359 1093
Tamil 2225 4447 361 1168

Table 1: Statistics for SentiWordNets

3.2 WordNets for Indian Languages

”Wordnets are lexical structures composed of
synsets and semantic relations” (Fellbaum, 1998).
A synset comprises a set of synonyms. They are
linked by semantic relations like hypernymy (is-
a), meronymy (part-of), troponymy (manner-of),
etc. WordNets for four different languages are
used for building the lexicon for Odia SentiWord-
Net. These WordNets are linked across languages
through common synset IDs. They are part of
the linked IndoWordNet structure (Bhattacharyya,
2010). WordNets for Bengali, Tamil and Telugu
were used for creating the source lexicon. Odia
WordNet was used for generating the target lexi-
con. Table 2 describes the statistics of the num-
ber of tokens present in every Part-Of-Speech cat-
egory for each language.

Table 2: IndoWordNet Statistics.

4 Procedure

A step-by-step procedure to be followed is
illustrated in Figure 1. This procedure can be
adopted for a different target language, as long
as the target language has a WordNet which is

linked with other Indian language WordNets. The
procedure is divided into three parts:

1. Creating Source Lexicon: SentiWordNets
from Indian languages are used to assign a
polarity to corresponding WordNet synsets.
A final list of synsets IDs with the corre-
sponding polarity serves as a source list.

2. Generating Target Lexicon: For every
synset ID from source, the corresponding
words from the target language WordNet are
assigned the same polarity as that of the
synset ID.

3. Evaluation of Final Resource: The created
target lexicon needs to be evaluated for er-
rors. This paper adopts manual evaluation by
language specific annotators and reports an-
notator agreement score.

4.1 Creating Source Lexicon
Source Lexicon acquisition begins with Senti-
WordNets available for the three aforementioned
Indian languages. In order to create a reliable
baseline for Odia, only words with positive and
negative polarity are considered. Currently, am-
biguous words or those having neutral polarity are
not considered for the creation of source lexicon.
For each language, words with positive and nega-
tive polarity are extracted from their correspond-
ing SentiWordNets.

The corresponding synset ID of each word is
then found from that language’s WordNet. This is
attained by using a hash-map created over all the
words in WordNet for that language. The synset
ID for the identified word serves as a key to a dic-
tionary δ. The corresponding value is a list with
the polarity of the word as an item. In case δ
already has a synset ID as a key, the polarity of
the word is appended to the existing list for that
key in δ. Such a case would occur when word
and its synonym (both part of the same synset)
are both present in the SentiWordNet for that lan-
guage. Such a case can also occur when a word
from a different language’s WordNet has a synset
ID which is already a key in δ. The final dictionary
comprises of several synset IDs as key. A total of
6203 synset IDs were identified. For each key the
value in δ is a list of polarities (positive or nega-
tive) which are observed for words in the sysnet
across languages.

145



Figure 1: Flow of Design for Odia SentiWordNet

A word and its synonyms should commonly
have the same polarity. This should also be true
across languages, in an ideal scenario. However, it
was observed that in many cases the list of polar-
ities for a given key is not homogeneous. This is
because a word with a particular sentiment in one
language may not necessarily have the same sen-
timent in another language. Infact, it was also ob-
served that, in very few cases, a word with a given
sentiment in one language sometimes did not have
the same sentiment for some of its synonyms in the
same language. Every synset ID which exists as a
key in δ is to be assigned a single polarity. Any
of the synset IDs which have contradicting polari-
ties to a certain degree should be ignored as these
will affect the reliability of the Odia SentiWord-
Net. For a given key (synset ID), the polarity in its
list in δ which holds a majority greater than 65%
is considered the final polarity for that synset ID.
This results in a list of synset IDs with an assigned
major polarity. The list serves as the ”Source” to
map to synsets in Odia WordNet. The source list
comprises of 5661 synset IDs along with their ma-
jor polarity.

4.2 Generating Target Lexicon

In order to create the Target Lexicon, Odia Word-
Net is used. The Odia WordNet is linked to the

other three aforementioned WordNets through a
common synset ID. A total 5407 synset IDs from
the Source List were found to exist in Odia Word-
Net. For each synset ID in Source list, the corre-
sponding words are extracted from Odia WordNet.
Each of these words is assigned the major polarity
(positive or negative) corresponding to that synset
ID in the Source list. A total of 13917 tokens
were assigned polarity. Table 3 provides details
on the total tokens extracted from Odia WordNet.
Only adjectives and adverbs are added to the final
Target Lexicon. Nouns and verbs were not added
to the Target Lexicon because the polarity asso-
ciated with these words is usually context depen-
dent. These are added to a separate list for future
inspection.

No. of observed OWN synsets 5661
Adjectives and Adverbs 4747
Nouns and Verbs 9170
Total number of tokens 13917

Table 3: Target Lexicon Statistics

The final Target Lexicon comprises of words
along with their sentiment polarity, Part-of-Speech
tag and synset ID corresponding to the language’s
WordNet. The final lexicon contained 1839 pos-

146

itive entries and 2908 negative entries. Figure 2
shows a few examples of Odia words with their
corresponding assigned polarity.

4.3 Resource Evaluation

In order to assess the reliability of the Odia Senti-
WordNet, a random sampling of 2500 words was
created from the Target Lexicon. In order to main-
tain a balanced sample set, 1250 words were ran-
domly picked from each polarity list. This sample
set was provided to three manual annotators to be
independently annotated as positive or negative.
The manual annotators were native Odia speak-
ers and spoke the language on a daily basis. Each
of the three annotators were asked to annotate ev-
ery token of the sample set with the polarity they
deemed appropriate. No annotator had prior infor-
mation about the assigned polarity to a token. This
ensured unbiased annotation of tokens.

In order to capture inter-annotator agreement,
Fleiss Kappa3 score for the annotated sample set
was also calculated. Fleiss Kappa is calculated us-
ing the following formula:

κ =
P̄ − P̄e
1− P̄e (1)

P̄ represents the sum of observed agreement. The
sum of agreement by chance is denoted by P̄e .
Fleiss Kappa score is calculated using three raters
for two categories (positive/negative). A substan-
tial agreement score of κ = 0.76 is reported for
Odia SentiWordNet.

In order to further improve upon the Target Lex-
icon, words with sentiment which none of the an-
notators agreed to, were removed. This was done
only for the sample of 2500 words. Table 4 gives
metrics for the Odia SentiWordNet thus created.
A total of 98 words with incorrect polarity were
removed.

5 Conclusion and Future Work

Odia SentiWordNet will serve as a useful resource
for Sentiment Analysis on Odia data. The method
adopted is generic and can be used to create sim-
ilar sentiment lexicons for other Indian languages
which are part of the IndoWordNet structure. In
order to find the accuracy of the created resource,
it needs to be tested on actual user generated data.
Odia data is readily available online. Currently, a
set of 1000 Odia sentences is being manually an-
notated. The annotated set would serve as gold
data. These sentences are taken from online news-
paper articles4. Odia SentiWordNet will be tested
on these 1000 sentences in order to predict the sen-
timent associated with each sentence. Comparison
with results of manual annotation should give a
more accurate insight on how reliable the resource
is. The resource serves as a baseline and can be
improved in the future. Several resource expan-
sion strategies can be used to enrich Odia Senti-
WordNet. One particular method involves usage
of antonym relations. Antonyms of a word, which
are not already present in the resource can be as-
signed opposite polarity. Antonym creation rules,
specific to the language, can be applied to gen-
erate antonyms of many words in the resource as
suggested previously in literature (Das and Bandy-
opadhyay, 2010). If a sufficiently large corpus
becomes available, SentiWordNet can be used to
capture language-specific nuances. The raw cor-
pus can be trained on a word embedding tool
(e.g Word2Vec) to create word clusters of similar

147



words based on the prior and subsequent neigh-
bours of a word in the corpus. Such clusters can
be further used to expand the lexicon.
