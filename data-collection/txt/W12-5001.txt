Abstract

Hindi and Urdu share a grammar and a basic vocabulary, but are often mutually unin-
telligible because they use different words in higher registers and sometimes even in quite
ordinary situations. We report computational translation evidence of this unusual relation-
ship (it differs from the usual pattern, that related languages share the advanced vocabulary
and differ in the basics). We took a GF resource grammar for Urdu and adapted it me-
chanically for Hindi, changing essentially only the script (Urdu is written in Perso-Arabic,
and Hindi in Devanagari) and the lexicon where needed. In evaluation, the Urdu grammar
and its Hindi twin either both correctly translated an English sentence, or failed in exactly
the same grammatical way, thus confirming computationally that Hindi andUrdu share a
grammar. But the evaluation also found that the Hindi and Urdu lexicons differed in 18%
of the basic words, in 31% of tourist phrases, and in 92% of school mathematics terms.

Keywords: Grammatical Framework, Resource Grammars, Application Grammars.

1 Background facts about Hindi and Urdu
Hindi is the national language of India and Urdu that of Pakistan, though neither is the
native language of a majority in its country.

‘Hindi’ is a very loose term covering widely varying dialects. In this wide sense, Hindi
has 422 million speakers according to (Census-India, 2001). This census also gives the
number of native speakers of ‘Standard Hindi’ as 258 million. Official Hindi now tends
to be Sanskritised, but Hindi has borrowed from both Sanskrit and Perso-Arabic, giving
it multiple forms, and making Standard Hindi hard to define. To complete the ‘national
language’ picture, note that Hindi is not understood in several parts of India (Agnihotri,
2007), and that it competes with English as lingua franca.

It is easier, for several reasons, to talk of standard Urdu, given as the native language of 51
million in India by (Census-India, 2001), and as that of 10 million in Pakistan by (Census-
Pakistan, 1998). Urdu has always drawn its advanced vocabulary only from Perso-Arabic,
and does not have the same form problem as Hindi. It is the official language and lingua
franca of Pakistan, a nation now of 180 million, though we note that Urdu’s domination
too is contested, indeed resented in parts of the country (Sarwat, 2006).

Hindi and Urdu ‘share the same grammar and most of the basic vocabulary of everyday
speech’ (Flagship, 2012). This common base is recognized, and known variously as ‘Hin-
dustani’ or ‘Bazaar language’ (Chand, 1944; Naim, 1999). But, ‘for attitudinal reasons, it
has not been given any status in Indian or Pakistani society’ (Kachru 2006). Hindi-Urdu
is the fourth or fifth largest language in the world (after English, Mandarin, Spanish and
perhaps Arabic), and is widely spoken by the South Asian diaspora in North America,
Europe and South Africa.

1.1 History: Hindustani, Urdu, Hindi
From the 14th century on, a language known as Hindustani developed by assimilating into
Khari Boli, a dialect of the Delhi region, some of the Perso-Arabic vocabulary of invaders.
Urdu evolved from Hindustani by further copious borrowing from Persian and some Arabic,
and is written using the Perso-Arabic alphabet. It dates from the late 18th century. Hindi,
from the late 19th century, also evolved from Hindustani, but by borrowing from Sanskrit.
It is written in a variant of the Devanagari script used for Sanskrit.

But the Hindi/Urdu has base retained its character: ‘the common spoken variety of both
Hindi and Urdu is close to Hindustani, i.e., devoid of heavy borrowings from either Sanskrit
or Perso-Arabic’ (Kachru, 2006).

1.2 One language or two?
Hindi and Urdu are ‘one language, two scripts’, according to a slogan over the newspaper
article (Joshi, 2012). The lexicons show that neither Hindi nor Urdu satisfies that slogan.
Hindustani does, by definition, but is limited to the shared part of the divergent lexicons
of Hindi and Urdu.

(Flagship, 2012) recognizes greater divergence: it says Hindi and Urdu ‘have developed
as two separate languages in terms of script, higher vocabulary, and cultural ambiance’.
Gopi Chand Narang, in his preface to (Schmidt, 2004) stresses the lexical aspect: ‘both

2



Hindi and Urdu share the same Indic base ... but at the lexical level they have borrowed so
extensively from different sources (Urdu from Arabic and Persian, and Hindi from Sanskrit)
that in actual practice and usage each has developed into an individual language’.

But lexical differences are not quite the whole story. (Naim, 1999) lists several subtle mor-
phological differences between Hindi and Urdu, and some quite marked phonological ones.
Most Hindi speakers cannot pronounce the Urdu sounds that occur in Perso-Arabic loan
words: q (unvoiced uvular plosive), x (unvoiced velar fricative), G (voiced velar fricative),
and some final consonant clusters, while Urdu speakers replace the ṇ (retroflex nasal) of
Hindi by n, and have trouble with many Hindi consonant clusters.

Naim does not think it helps learners to begin with Hindi and Urdu together. Those who
seek a command of the written language, he says, might as well learn the conventions
exclusive to Urdu from the beginning.

Thus there are many learned and differing views on whether Hindi and Urdu are one or two
languages, but nothing has been computationally proved, to the best of our knowledge. Our
work demonstrates computationally that Hindi and Urdu share a grammar, but that the
lexicons diverge hugely beyond the basic and general registers. Our as yet first experiments
already give preliminary estimates to questions like ‘How much do Hindi and Urdu differ
in the lexicons?’.

Overview Section 2 describes Grammatical Framework, the tool used in this experiment,
and Section 3 lists what we report. Section 4 describes the Hindi and Urdu resource
grammars, some differences between them, and how we cope with these differences. Section
5 presents the general and domain-specific lexicons used in this experiment. Evaluation
results are given at the ends of Sections 4 and 5. Section 6 provides context and wraps up.

This paper uses an IPA style alphabet, with the usual values and conventions. Retroflexed
sounds are written with a dot under the letter; ṭ, ḍ, and ṛ (a flap) are common to Hindi
and Urdu, while ṇ and ṣ occur in Sanskritised Hindi (though many dialects pronounce
them n and š). The palatalised spirant š and aspirated stops, shown thus: kh, are common
to Hindi and Urdu. A macron over a vowel denotes a long vowel, and ˜, nasalisation. In
Hindi and Urdu, e and o are always long, so the macron is dropped. Finally, we use ñ to
mean the nasal homorganic with the following consonant.

2 Background: Grammatical Framework (GF)
GF (Ranta, 2004) is a grammar formalisim tool based on Martin Löf’s (Martin-Löf, 1982)
type theory. It has been used to develop multilingual grammars that can be used for trans-
lation. These translations are not usually for arbitrary sentences, but for those restricted
to a specific domain, such as tourist phrases or school mathematics.

2.1 Resource and Application Grammars in GF
The sublanguages of English or Hindi, say, that deal with these specific domains are de-
scribed respectively by the (English or Hindi) application grammars Phrasebook (Caprotti
et al 2010, (Ranta et al., 2012) and MGL (Saludes and Xambó, 2010). But the English
Phrasebook and English MGL share the underlying English (similarly for Hindi). The un-
derlying English (or Hindi) syntax, morphology, predication, modification, quantification,
etc., are captured in a common general-purpose module called a resource grammar.

3



Resource grammars are therefore provided as software libraries, and there are currently
resource grammars for more than twenty five languages in the GF resource grammar library
(Ranta, 2009). Developing a resource grammar requires both GF expertise and knowledge
of the language. Application grammars require domain expertise, but are free of the general
complexities of formulating things in English or Hindi. One might say that the resource
grammar describes how to speak the language, while the application grammar describes
what there is to say in the particular application domain.

2.2 Abstract and Concrete Syntax
Every GF grammar has two levels: abstract syntax and concrete syntax. Here is an example
from Phrasebook.

1. Abstract sentence:
PQuestion (HowFarFrom (ThePlace Station)(ThePlace Airport))

2. Concrete English sentence: How far is the airport from the station?

3. Concrete Hindustani sentence: sṭešan se havāī aḍḍā kitnī dūr hæ?
( शन  हवाई अ ा कतनी र ? , ؟ ـ �ن دور  وائ اڈا  شن سـ  اسـٹ )

4. Hindustani word order: station from air port how-much far is?

The abstract sentence is a tree built using functions applied to elements. These elements
are built from categories such as questions, places, and distances. The concrete syntax for
Hindi, say, defines a mapping from the abstract syntax to the textual representation in
Hindi. That is, a concrete syntax gives rules to linearize the trees of the abstract syntax.

Examples from MGL would have different abstract functions and elements. In general, the
abstract syntax specifies what categories and functions are available, thus giving language
independent semantic constructions.

Separating the tree building rules (abstract syntax) from the linearization rules (concrete
syntax) makes it possible to have multiple concrete syntaxes for one abstract. This makes
it possible to parse text in one language and output it in any of the other languages.

Compare the above tree with the resource grammar abstract tree for “How far is the airport
from the station?” to see the difference between resource and application grammars:

))))))NoVoc

3 What we did: build a Hindi GF grammar, compare Hindi/Urdu
We first developed a new grammar for Hindi in the Grammatical Framework (GF) (Ranta,
2011) using an already existing Urdu resource grammar (Virk et al., 2010). This new Hindi
resource grammar is thus the first thing we report, though it is not in itself the focus of
this paper.

4



Figure 1: Hindi/Urdu Functor.

We used a functor style implementation to develop Hindi and Urdu resource grammars,
which makes it possible to share commonalities between two grammars. Figure 1 gives a
picture of this implementation style. Most of the syntactic code resides in the ‘common
code box’, and the minor syntactical differences (discussed in Section 4) are placed in each
of the ‘DiffLang box’. Each resource grammar has its own lexicon. This mechanically
proves that Hindi and Urdu share a grammar and differ almost only in the lexicons.

We evaluated our claim by (1) porting two application grammars to Hindi and Urdu: a
Phrasebook of tourist sentences (Ranta et al., 2012), and MGL, a mathematical grammar
library for school mathematics (Caprotti and Saludes, 2012), (2) randomly producing 80
abstract trees (40 from each of the Phrasebook, and MGL), (3) linearizing them to both
Hindi and Urdu, and finally checking them either for correctness, or badness (see Section
6 for results).

4 Differences between Hindi and Urdu in the Resource Grammars
We started from the script based GF resource grammar for Urdu, and adapted it for Hindi
almost entirely just by re-coding from Urdu to Hindi script. A basic test vocabulary
accompanies the resource grammars, and this was changed as needed: it turned out that
Hindi and Urdu differ up to 18% even in this basic vocabulary. Section 5 deals with the
application lexicons.

We do not give any implementation details of these resource grammars in this paper, as
the interesting bits have already been explained in (Virk et al., 2010). But we describe
below resource level differences between Hindi/Urdu, and strategies to deal with them.

4.1 Morphology
Every GF resource grammar provides a basic test lexicon of 450 words, for which the
morphology is programmed by special functions called lexical paradigms. Our Hindi mor-
phology simply takes the existing Urdu morphology and re-codes it for the Devanagari
script. Lexical differences mean that the morphologies are not identical; e.g., Hindi some-

5



times uses a simple word where Urdu has a compound word, or vice-versa. But there are
no patterns that occur in only one of the languages, so the test lexicon for Hindi works
with few problems.

We could in principle implement the subtle morphological differences noted in (Naim,
1999), but we ignored them. That these differences are minor is shown by the fact that
our informants find the resulting Hindi entirely normal.

4.2 Internal Representation: Sound or Script?
The translation of “How far is the airport from the station?” was written in IPA, repre-
senting the sound of the Hindi/Urdu. It sounds identical in the two languages, and thus
we could label it ‘Hindustani’. An obvious approach to writing grammars for Hindi/Urdu
from scratch would be to represent the languages internally by sound, so that we would
get just one grammar, one shared lexicon, and differentiated lexicons only for those words
that sound different in Hindi and Urdu. For output, we would then map the IPA to the
Hindi or Urdu script.

But we were starting from (Virk et al., 2010), which uses an internal representation based
on written Urdu. It would be a fair sized task to re-do this in terms of speech, though
the result would then be immediately re-usable for Hindi and might also help capture
similarities to other South Asian languages. We reserve this re-modelling for future work.

So, in the present work, we changed the Urdu grammar to a Hindi grammar merely by
replacing written Urdu by written Hindi. This script change was also done for the basic
lexicon, though here some words were indeed different even spoken. Our parallel grammars
therefore give no indication that Hindi and Urdu often sound identical.

One compensating advantage is that script-based representations avoid spelling problems.
Hindi-Urdu collapses several sound distinctions in Persian, Arabic and Sanskrit. A pho-
netic transcription would not show these collapsed distinctions, but the orthography does,
because Urdu faithfully retains the spelling of the original Perso-Arabic words while rep-
resenting Sanskrit words phonetically, while Hindi does the reverse. Each language is
faithful to the sources that use the same script. We see that it will not be entirely trivial
to mechanically go from a phonetic representation to a written one.

Obviously, the more the Hindi and Urdu lexicons overlap, the more the wasted effort in
the parallel method. But as we shall see, the lexicons deviate from each other quite a bit.
We have designed an augmented phonetic representation that keeps track of spelling, for
use in a remodelled grammar.

4.3 Idiomatic, Gender and Orthographic Differences
In addition to spelling, Hindi and Urdu also have orthographic differences, not often re-
marked. Indeed some apparently grammatical differences result from in fact idiomatic,
gender or orthographic differences.

For example, the lexicon might translate the verb “to add” as “joṛnā” in Hindi, and as
“jame karnā” in Urdu. The imperative sentence “add 2 to 3” would then be rendered
“do ko tīn se joṛo” in Hindi, and “do ko tīn mẽ jame karo” in Urdu. But the
choice between the post-positions “se” and “mẽ” is determined not by different grammars

6



for Hindi and Urdu, but by the post-positional idiom of the chosen verb, “joṛnā” or “jame
karnā”, as can be seen because either sentence works in either language.

A gender difference appears with “war”, rendered in Urdu as “laṛāī” (fem.). This word
works in Hindi as well, but has more a connotation of “battle”, so we chose instead
“sañgharṣ” (masc.). The shift from feminine to masculine is driven by the choice of word,
not language.

Orthographic differences next. “He will go” is “vo jāegā” in both languages; in writing,
(वह जाएगा, ا ,(وہ �ائ  the final “gā” (गा, ا ) is written as a separate word in Urdu but not
in Hindi. Similarly, “we drank tea” is “hamne cāy pī” in both languages, but in writing,
(हम  चाय पी, م ن چائ � ), the particle “ne” ( , (ن is written as a separate word in Urdu
but not in Hindi.

These differences were handled by a small variant in the code, shown below. To generate
the future tense for Urdu, the predicate is broken into two parts: finite (fin) and infinite
(inf). The inf part stores the actual verb phrase (here “jāe”), and the fin part stores the
copula “gā” as shown below.

VPFut=>fin=(vp.s! VPTense VPFutr agr).fin; inf=(vp.s! VPTense
VPFutr agr).inf

For Hindi, these two parts are glued to each other to make them one word. This word is
then stored in the inf part of the predicate and the fin part is left blank as shown below.

VPFut=>fin=[]; inf=Prelude.glue ((vp.s! VPTense VPFutr agr).inf)
((vp.s! VPTense VPFutr agr).fin)

Similarly in the ergative “hamne cāy pī” (“we drank tea”), Urdu treats “ham” and “ne”
as separate words, while Hindi makes them one. We used for Urdu, NPErg => ppf ! Obl
++ ”ne” and for Hindi, NPErg => glue (ppf ! Obl) ”ne”.

4.4 Evaluation and Results
With external informants

As described earlier, we randomly generated 80 abstract trees (40 from each of the Phrase-
book, and MGL), linearized them to both Hindi and Urdu. These linearizations were then
given to three independent informants.

They evaluated the Hindi and Urdu translations generated by our grammars. The infor-
mants found 45 sentences to be correct in both Hindi and Urdu. The other sentences were
found understandable but failed grammatically - in exactly the same way in both Hindi
and Urdu: nothing the informants reported could be traced to a grammatical difference
between Hindi and Urdu. For this paper, the point is that all 80 sentences, the badly
translated as well as the correctly translated, offer mechanical confirmation that Hindi and
Urdu share a grammar.

We note for the record that the 35 grammatical failures give a wrong impression that the
grammar is only “45/80” correct. In fact the grammar is much better: there are only a

7



handful of distinct known constructs that need to be fixed, such as placement of negation
and question words, but these turn up repeatedly in the evaluation sentences.

A result that has not been the focus of this paper is that we greatly improved the Urdu
grammar of (Virk et al., 2010) while developing the Hindi variant. Errors remain, as noted
above.

With internal informants

The second author is a native Urdu speaker, while the first speaks Hindi, though not as a
native. With ourselves as internal informants, we could rapidly conduct several more ex-
tensive informal evaluations. We looked at 300 Phrasebook sentences, 100 MGL sentences,
and 100 sentences generated directly from the resource grammars. We can confirm that
for all of these 500 English sentences, the corresponding Urdu and Hindi translations were
understandable and in conformance with Urdu and Hindi grammar (barring the known
errors noted by the external informants).

We note particularly that randomly generated MGL sentences can be extremely involuted,
and that the Hindi and Urdu translations had the same structure in every case.

5 The Lexicons
As we noted in Section 1, Urdu has a standard form, but Hindi does not, though official
Hindi increasingly tends to a Sanskritised form. Hindustani itself counts as ‘Hindi’, and is
a neutral form, but has only basic vocabulary, a complaint already made in (Chand, 1944).
So to go beyond this, Hindi speakers have to choose between one of the higher forms.
Elementary mathematics, for example, can be done in Hindustani or in Sanskritised Hindi,
attested by the NCERT books (NCERT, 2012), or in English-ised Hindi, which can be
heard at any high school or university in the Hindi speaking regions.

We arbitrated the choice of Hindi words thus: when we had sources, such as the NCERT
mathematics books or a government phrase book, we used those. Otherwise, we used (Snell
and Weightman, 2003) and (Hindi-WordNet, 2012) to pick the most popular choices.

5.1 The general lexicon
Out of 350 entries, our Hindi and Urdu lexicons use the same word in 287 entries, a fraction
of 6/7 which can easily be changed by accepting more Urdu words as Hindi’ or by avoiding
them. We note in passing that the general lexicon is any case often tricky to translate
to Hindi-Urdu, as the cultural ambience is different from the European one where GF
started, and which the test lexicon reflects. Many words (“cousin”, “wine”, etc.) have no
satisfactory single equivalents, but these lexical items still help to check that the grammars
work.

5.2 The Phrasebook lexicon
This lexicon has 134 entries, split into 112 words and 22 greetings. For 92 of the words, the
Hindi and Urdu entries are the same; these include 42 borrowings from English for names
for currencies, (European) countries and nationalities,and words like “tram” and “bus”. So
Hindi and Urdu share 50 of 70 native words, but differ on 20, including days of the week
(except Monday, “somvār” in both Hindi and Urdu). The greetings lexicon has 22 entries,

8



most of which are hard to translate. “Good morning” etc. can be translated though they
are often just “hello” and “bye”. Greetings are clearly more culture dependent: Hindi and
Urdu differ in 17 places.
An example not in the Phrasebook drives home the point about greetings: airport an-
nouncements beginning “Passengers are requested ...” are rendered in Hindi as “yātriyõ
se nivedan hæ ...” (या य   न दान ) and in Urdu as “musāfirõ se guza:riš kī jātī
hæ ...” ( ـ زارش  �ـا�  ,(مـسافـروں سـ  which suggests that Hindi and Urdu have diverged
even in situations almost tailored for ‘Bazaar Hindustani’!

5.3 The Mathematics lexicon
Our MGL lexicon, for use with high school mathematics, has 260 entries. Hindi and Urdu
differ on 245 of these. The overlapping 15 include function words used in a technical
mathematical sense, “such that”, “where”, and so on.
As examples of the others, here are some English words with their Hindi and Urdu equiva-
lents in parentheses: perpendicular (lañb लब, amūd ,(عمود right-angled (samkoṇ समकोण,
qāyam zāvī ,(قائم زاوی triangle (tribhuj भज, mašallaš ,(م�ل� hypotenuse (karṇ कण ,
vitar ,(و�ر vertex (šīrṣ शीष, rās .(راس
This total divergence comes about because Urdu borrows mathematical terms only from
Perso-Arabic, and Hindi, only from Sanskrit. There would be more overlap in primary
school, where Hindi uses more Hindustani words, but the divergence is already complete
by Class 6. The parallel English, Hindi and Urdu texts (NCERT, 2012), from which we
got the list above, show that the grammar of the Hindi and Urdu sentences continue to be
identical modulo lexical changes, even when the lexicons themselves diverge totally.
Since it often happens in mathematics that every Hindi content word is different from
its Urdu counterpart, the languages are mutually unintelligible. Even function words can
differ. Either “yadi” or “agar” can mean “if” in Hindi, but the Sanskrit “yadi” is often
chosen for reasons of stylistic unity with the Sanskrit vocabulary. Urdu never uses “yadi”.

5.3.1 More on Hindi mathematical terms
Our Hindi words were taken mostly from the NCERT books, which particularly in the later
classes use Sanskritised Hindi. They make good use of the regular word-building capacity
of Sanskrit. For example, “to add” is “joṛnā” in the lower classes, but “addition” becomes
“yog” in the higher classes. This allows constructs like (yogātmak, additive), which is like
(guṇātmak, multiplicative), (bhāgātmak, divisive) and so on.
One might think the NCERT books overly Sanskritised, but it is hard to find other so-
lutions, short of massive code switching between English and Hindi. NCERT books are
widely used all over India. We have no sales figures for the NCERT mathematics books
in Hindi, but there are not many widely available alternatives. If Hindi is to become a
language for mathematics, these books might be a major lexical source.

5.4 Contrast: the converging lexicons of Telugu/Kannada
Hindi and Urdu make a very unusual pair, agreeing so completely at the base and diverging
so much immediately after. Related languages usually go the other way. An example is
the pair Telugu/Kannada, two South Indian languages.

9



Telugu/Kannada do not share a base lexicon, and so are mutually unintelligible for everyday
use, unlike Hindi/Urdu.

But at higher registers, where Hindi/Urdu diverge, Telugu/Kannada converge. So where
a Hindi speaker listening to technical Urdu would understand the grammar but not the
content words, the Telugu speaker listening to technical Kannada would recognise all the
content words but not the grammar.

For mathematics, Telugu/Kannada use a Sanskrit-based lexicon essentially identical to
that of Hindi. We do not list the exact Telugu and Kannada versions, but do note that the
convergence Hindi-Telugu-Kannada would be improved by deliberate coordination. For
completeness, we mention that a smaller part of the higher vocabulary, mostly adminis-
trative terms, is shared with Urdu.

Further,Telugu/Kannada are in fact grammatically close, so a Telugu speaker who knows
no Kannada would need only a brief reminder of grammar and a basic lexicon to read
mathematics in Kannada—the mathematical terms would be familiar. A hypothetical
“Scientific Kannada for Telugu Speakers” need only be a slim volume. It is the general
reading in Kannada that would need a bigger lexicon. This parallels the situation of an
English speaking scientist trying to read French—the scientific reading is easier!

But for a Hindi-speaking scientist trying to read Urdu, it is the everyday texts that are
easier, not the scientific ones.

5.5 Summary of lexical study
Our figures suggest that everyday Hindi and Urdu share 82% of their vocabulary, but this
number drops if we move to a specific domain: for tourist phrases, to 69%, and for very
technical domains, such as mathematics, to a striking 8%.

An English speaker who knows no mathematics might hear mathematics in English as built
of nonsense words that function recognizably as nouns, adjectives, verbs and so on. This is
how mathematics in Urdu would sound to a Hindi speaking mathematician (and the other
way around), even though Hindi and Urdu share a base lexicon and the grammar.

The mathematics lexicons of Hindi, Telugu and Kannada suggest that a Sanskrit based
vocabulary makes a powerful link across India. That vocabulary also makes Urdu the odd
language out amongst Indian languages, despite its close relation to Hindi.

6 Discussion
Our results confirm that Hindi and Urdu share a grammar, but differ so much in vocabulary
(even for travel and primary school) that they are now different languages in any but the
most basic situation. With the various linguistic, cultural and political factors obtaining
in India and Pakistan, a good guess is that the languages will diverge further.

A regular Sanskrit base for Hindi technical terms would cement this divergence from Urdu,
but would give Hindi a more usual convergent relationship with other Indian languages,
differing at the everyday level but coming together at higher registers. Indeed this situation
might argue for Sanskritised Hindi as a national language, because for non-native Indian
speakers this may be easier to understand than Hindi with more Perso-Arabic words.

(Paauw, 2009) says “Indonesia, virtually alone among post-colonial nations, has been suc-

10



cessful at promoting an indigenous language as its national language.” Pakistan may have
similarly solved its national language problem, with a parallel situation of Urdu being the
native language of a minority. A difference is that Urdu already has rich lexical and word-
building resources, whereas Bahasa Indonesia did not. So the Istilah committee has over
the decades standardised hundreds of thousands of terms. India does not need that many
new terms, since it too has a rich shared lexical resource in Sanskrit, one that moreover has
tremendous word-building capacity. But a standardising committee may help, since often
the same Sanskrit word is used in different ways in different Indian languages. A standard
pan-Indian lexicon for technical terms would allow for ease of translation, and might spur
the usabilty of all Indian languages for science and technology.

Future Work

We hope to develop our Phrasebook and MGL tools, aiming for practical use. We also need
to fix the remaining errors in our grammars, to do with continuous tenses, word order for
some questions and negations, and the translation of English articles. Fixing these might
be non-trivial. We have stated two other goals, to rebuild our resource grammars on a
phonetic basis, and to do a progressive mathematics lexicon. We have started work on this
last, which we believe will show an increasing divergence between Hindi and Urdu as we
go to higher classes. The NCERT books are available in both Hindi and Urdu, so we have
a ready made source for the lexicons.

Currently, popular articles and TV programs that need advanced vocabulary (e.g., music
competitions or political debates) in Hindi take the terms needed from English, Urdu and
Sanskrit sources, though these elements sit uncomfortably together, at least as of now.
More examples are worth studying.

Acknowledgements

We thank our informants Anurag Negi, Vinay Jethava, and Azam Sheikh Muhammad for
their painstaking comments.

Our paper originally used French and English as an example of the usual relationship:
shared technical vocabulary but differing everyday words. We thank one of our anonymous
referees for pointing out that we should rather take a pair closer to home - they suggested
Malay-Indonesian (Paauw, 2009), but we chose Telugu-Kannada both because the first
author speaks these and because we can link them to Hindi via Sanskrit.
