Abstract
There has been an explosion of work in the
vision & language community during the
past few years from image captioning to
video transcription, and answering ques-
tions about images. These tasks have fo-
cused on literal descriptions of the image.
To move beyond the literal, we choose to
explore how questions about an image are
often directed at commonsense inference
and the abstract events evoked by objects
in the image. In this paper, we introduce
the novel task of Visual Question Gener-
ation (VQG), where the system is tasked
with asking a natural and engaging ques-
tion when shown an image. We provide
three datasets which cover a variety of im-
ages from object-centric to event-centric,
with considerably more abstract training
data than provided to state-of-the-art cap-
tioning systems thus far. We train and
test several generative and retrieval mod-
els to tackle the task of VQG. Evaluation
results show that while such models ask
reasonable questions for a variety of im-
ages, there is still a wide gap with human
performance which motivates further work
on connecting images with commonsense
knowledge and pragmatics. Our proposed
task offers a new challenge to the commu-
nity which we hope furthers interest in ex-
ploring deeper connections between vision
& language.

1 Introduction

We are witnessing a renewed interest in interdis-
ciplinary AI research in vision & language, from
descriptions of the visual input such as image cap-
tioning (Chen et al., 2015; Fang et al., 2014; Don-
ahue et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2015) and video

Natural Questions:
- Was anyone injured in the

crash?
- Is the motorcyclist alive?
- What caused this accident?

Generated Caption:
- A man standing next to a
motorcycle.

questions and automatically generated caption.

transcription (Rohrbach et al., 2012; Venugopalan
et al., 2015), to testing computer understanding
of an image through question answering (Antol et
al., 2015; Malinowski and Fritz, 2014). The most
established work in the vision & language com-
munity is ‘image captioning’, where the task is to
produce a literal description of the image. It has
been shown (Devlin et al., 2015; Fang et al., 2014;
Donahue et al., 2014) that a reasonable language
modeling paired with deep visual features trained
on large enough datasets promise a good perfor-
mance on image captioning, making it a less chal-
lenging task from language learning perspective.
Furthermore, although this task has a great value
for communities of people who are low-sighted or
cannot see in all or some environments, for oth-
ers, the description does not add anything to what
a person has already perceived.

The popularity of the image sharing applica-
tions in social media and user engagement around
images is evidence that commenting on pictures
is a very natural task. A person might respond
to an image with a short comment such as ‘cool’,
‘nice pic’ or ask a question. Imagine someone has
shared the image in Figure 1. What is the very
first question that comes to mind? Your question is
most probably very similar to the questions listed
next to the image, expressing concern about the
motorcyclist (who is not even present in the im-
age). As you can tell, natural questions are not

1802



about what is seen, the policemen or the motorcy-
cle, but rather about what is inferred given these
objects, e.g., an accident or injury. As such, ques-
tions are often about abstract concepts, i.e., events
or states, in contrast to the concrete terms1 used in
image captioning. It is clear that the correspond-
ing automatically generated caption2 for Figure 1
presents only a literal description of objects.

To move beyond the literal description of im-
age content, we introduce the novel task of Visual
Question Generation (VQG), where given an im-
age, the system should ‘ask a natural and engag-
ing question’. Asking a question that can be an-
swered simply by looking at the image would be
of interest to the Computer Vision community, but
such questions are neither natural nor engaging for
a person to answer and so are not of interest for the
task of VQG.

Learning to ask questions is an important task in
NLP and is more than a syntactic transformation
of a declarative sentence (Vanderwende, 2008).
Deciding what to ask about demonstrates under-
standing and as such, question generation provides
an indication of machine understanding, just as
some educational methods assess students’ under-
standing by their ability to ask relevant questions3.
Furthermore, training a system to ask a good ques-
tion (not only answer a question) may imbue the
system with what appears to be a cognitive ability
unique to humans among other primates (Jordania,
2006). Developing the ability to ask relevant and
to-the-point questions can be an essential compo-
nent of any dynamic learner which seeks informa-
tion. Such an ability can be an integral compo-
nent of any conversational agent, either to engage
the user in starting a conversation or to elicit task-
specific information.

The contributions of this paper can be sum-
marized as follows: (1) in order to enable the
VQG research, we carefully created three datasets
with a total of 75,000 questions, which range
from object- to event-centric images, where we
show that VQG covers a wide range of abstract
terms including events and states (Section 3). (2)
we collected 25,000 gold captions for our event-
centric dataset and show that this dataset presents

1Concrete terms are the ones that can be experienced with
five senses. Abstract terms refer to intangible things, such as
feelings, concepts, and qualities

2Throughout this paper we use the state-of-the-art cap-
tioning system (Fang et al., 2014), henceforth MSR caption-
ing system https://www.captionbot.ai/, to gener-
ate captions.

challenges to the state-of-the-art image caption-
ing models (Section 3.3). (3) we perform analysis
of various generative and retrieval approaches and
conclude that end-to-end deep neural models out-
perform other approaches on our most-challenging
dataset (Section 4). (4) we provide a systematic
evaluation methodology for this task, where we
show that the automatic metric ∆BLEU strongly
correlates with human judgments (Section 5.3).
The results show that while our models learn to
generate promising questions, there is still a large
gap to match human performance, making the
generation of relevant and natural questions an in-
teresting and promising new challenge to the com-
munity.

2 Related Work

For the task of image captioning, datasets have pri-
marily focused on objects, e.g. Pascal VOC (Ever-
ingham et al., 2010) and Microsoft Common Ob-
jects in Context (MS COCO) (Lin et al., 2014).
MS COCO, for example, includes complex every-
day scenes with 91 basic objects in 328k images,
each paired with 5 captions. Event detection is the
focus in video processing and action detection, but
these do not include a textual description of the
event (Yao et al., 2011b; Andriluka et al., 2014;
Chao et al., 2015; Xiong et al., 2015). The num-
ber of actions in each of these datasets is still rel-
atively small, ranging from 40 (Yao et al., 2011a)
to 600 (Chao et al., 2015) and all involve human-
oriented activity (e.g. ‘cooking’, ‘gardening’, ‘rid-
ing a bike’). In our work, we are focused on gen-
erating questions for static images of events, such
as ‘fire’, ‘explosion’ or ‘snowing’, which have not
yet been investigated in any of the above datasets.

Visual Question Answering is a relatively new
task where the system provides an answer to a
question about the image content. The most no-
table, Visual Question Answering (VQA) (Antol
et al., 2015), is an open-ended (free-form) dataset,
in which both the questions and the answers are
crowd-sourced, with workers prompted to ask a
visually verifiable question which will ‘stump a
smart robot’. Gao et al. (2015) used similar
methodology to create a visual question answering
dataset in Chinese. COCO-QA (CQA) (Ren et al.,
2015), in contrast, does not use human-authored
questions, but generates questions automatically
from image captions of the MS COCO dataset by
applying a set of transformation rules to generate
the wh-question. The expected answers in CQA

are by design limited to objects, numbers, colors,
or locations. A more in- depth analysis of VQA
and CQA datasets will be presented in Section 3.1.

In this work, we focus on questions which
are interesting for a person to answer, not ques-
tions designed to evaluate computer vision. A re-
cently published work on VQA, Visual7W (Zhu
et al., 2016), establishes a grounding link on the
object regions corresponding to the textual an-
swer. This setup enables a system to answer a
question with visual answers (in addition to tex-
tual answers). They collect a set of 327,939 7W
multiple-choice QA pairs, where they point out
that ‘where’, ‘when’ and ‘why’ questions often
require high-level commonsense reasoning, going
beyond spatial reasoning required for ‘which’ or
‘who’ questions. This is more in line with the type
of questions that VQG captures, however, the ma-
jority of the questions in Visual7w are designed
to be answerable by only the image, making them
unnatural for asking a human. Thus, learning to
generate the questions in VQA task is not a use-
ful sub-task, as the intersection between VQG and
any VQA questions is by definition minimal.

Previous work on question generation from tex-
tual input has focused on two aspects: the gram-
maticality (Wolfe, 1976; Mitkov and Ha, 2003;
Heilman and Smith, 2010) and the content focus
of question generation, i.e., “what to ask about”.
For the latter, several methods have been explored:
(Becker et al., 2012) create fill-in-the-blank ques-
tions, (Mazidi and Nielsen, 2014) and (Lindberg
et al., 2013) use manually constructed question
templates, while (Labutov et al., 2015) use crowd-
sourcing to collect a set of templates and then rank
the potentially relevant templates for the selected
content. To our knowledge, neither a retrieval
model nor a deep representation of textual input,
presented in our work, have yet been used to gen-
erate questions.

3 Data Collection Methodology

Task Definition: Given an image, the task is to
generate a natural question which can potentially
engage a human in starting a conversation. Ques-
tions that are visually verifiable, i.e., that can be
answered by looking at only the image, are out-
side the scope of this task. For instance, in Figure
2, a question about the number of horses (appear-
ing in the VQA dataset) or the color of the field
is not of interest. Although in this paper we focus
on asking a question about an image in isolation,
adding prior context or history of conversation is
the natural next step in this project.

We collected the VQG questions by crowd-
sourcing the task on Amazon Mechanical Turk
(AMT). We provide details on the prompt and
the specific instructions for all the crowdsourcing
tasks in this paper in the supplementary material.
Our prompt was very successful at capturing non-
literal questions, as the good question in Figure 2
demonstrates. In the following Sections, we de-
scribe our process for selecting the images to be
included in the VQG dataset. We start with images
from MS COCO, which enables meaningful com-
parison with VQA and CQA questions. Given that
it is more natural for people to ask questions about
event-centric images, we explore sourcing event-
ful images from Flickr and from querying an im-
age search engine. Each data source is represented
by 5,000 images, with 5 questions per image.

3.1 V QGcoco−5000 and V QGF lickr−5000
As our first dataset, we collected VQG ques-
tions for a sample of images from the MS COCO
dataset4. In order to enable comparisons with re-
lated datasets, we sampled 5,000 images of MS
COCO which were also annotated by the CQA
dataset (Ren et al., 2015) and by VQA (Antol et
al., 2015). We name this dataset V QGcoco−5000.
Table 1 shows a sample MS COCO image along
with annotations in the various datasets. As the
CQA questions are generated by rule application
from captions, they are not always coherent. The
VQA questions are written to evaluate the detailed
visual understanding of a robot, so their questions
are mainly visually grounded and literal. The ta-
ble demonstrates how different VQG questions are
from VQA and CQA questions.

In Figure 3 we provide statistics for the various
annotations on that portion of the MS COCO im-
ages which are represented in the V QGcoco−5000

dataset. In Figure 3(a) we compare the percent-
age of object-mentions in each of the annota-
tions. Object-mentions are words associated with
the gold-annotated object boundary boxes5 as pro-
vided with the MS COCO dataset. Naturally,
COCO captions (green bars) have the highest per-
centage of these literal objects. Since object-
mentions are often the answer to VQA and CQA
questions, those questions naturally contain ob-
jects less frequently. Hence, we see that VQG
questions include the mention of more of those lit-
eral objects. Figure 3(b) shows that COCO cap-
tions have a larger vocabulary size, which reflects
their longer and more descriptive sentences. VQG
shows a relatively large vocabulary size as well,
indicating greater diversity in question formula-
tion than VQA and CQA. Moreover, Figure 3(c)
shows that the verb part of speech is represented
with high frequency in our dataset.

Figure 3(d) depicts the percentage of abstract
terms such as ‘think’ or ‘win’ in the vocabulary.
Following Ferraro et al. (2015), we use a list
of most common abstract terms in English (Van-
derwende et al., 2015), and count all the other
words except a set of function words as concrete.
This figure supports our expectation that VQG
covers more abstract concepts. Furthermore, Fig-
ure 3(e) shows inter-annotation textual similarity
according to the BLEU metric (Papineni et al.,
2002). Interestingly, VQG shows the highest inter-
annotator textual similarity, which reflects on the
existence of consensus among human for asking

a natural question, even for object-centric images
like the ones in MS COCO.

the MS COCO dataset. (a) Percentage of gold ob-
jects used in annotations. (b) Vocabulary size (c)

The MS COCO dataset is limited in terms of
the concepts it covers, due to its pre-specified
set of object categories. Word frequency in
V QGcoco−5000 dataset, as demonstrated in Figure
4, bears this out, with the words ‘cat’ and ‘dog’
the fourth and fifth most frequent words in the
dataset. Not shown in the frequency graph is that
words such as ‘wedding’, ‘injured’, or ‘accident’
are at the very bottom of frequency ranking list.
This observation motivated the collection of the
V QGFlickr−5000 dataset, with images appearing
as the middle photo in a story-full photo album
(Huang et al., 2016) on Flickr6. The details about
this dataset can be found in the supplementary ma-
terial.

3.2 V QGBing−5000
To obtain a more representative visualization of
specific event types, we queried a search engine7

with 1,200 event-centric query terms which were
obtained as follows: we aggregated all ‘event’ and
‘process’ hyponyms in WordNet (Miller, 1995),
1,000 most frequent TimeBank events (Puste-
jovsky et al., 2003) and a set of manually curated
30 stereotypical events, from which we selected
the top 1,200 queries based on Project Gutenberg
word frequencies. For each query, we collected
the first four to five images retrieved, for a total

of 5,000 images, having first used crowdsourcing
to filter out images depicting graphics and car-
toons. A similar word frequency analysis shows
that the V QGBing−5000 dataset indeed contains
more words asking about events: happen, work,
cause appear in top 40 words, which was our aim
in creating the Bing dataset.

Statistics: Our three datasets together cover a
wide range of visual concepts and events, total-
ing 15,000 images with 75,000 questions. Fig-
ure 5 draws the histogram of number of tokens
in VQG questions, where the average question
length is 6 tokens. Figure 6 visualizes the n-gram
distribution (with n=6) of questions in the three

is substantially different from the MS COCO
dataset. Human evaluation results of a re-
cent work (Tran et al., 2016) further confirms
the significant image captioning quality degra-
dation on out-of-domain data. To further ex-
plore this difference, we crowdsourced 5 cap-
tions for each image in the V QGBing−5000 dataset
using the same prompt as used to source the
MS COCO captions. We call this new dataset
CaptionsBing−5000. Table 3 shows the results
of testing the state-of-the-art MSR captioning sys-
tem on the CaptionsBing−5000 dataset as com-
pared to the MS COCO dataset, measured by the
standard BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and ME-
TEOR (Denkowski and Lavie, 2014) metrics. The
wide gap in the results further confirms that in-
deed the V QGBing−5000 dataset covers a new
class of images; we hope the availability of this
new dataset will encourage including more diverse
domains for image captioning.

hope that the availability of this dataset will en-
courage the research community to tackle more
end-goal oriented vision & language tasks.

4 Models

In this Section we present several generative and
retrieval models for tackling the task of VQG. For
all the forthcoming models we use the VGGNet
(Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014) architecture for
computing deep convolutional image features. We
primarily use the 4096-dimensional output the last
fully connected layer (fc7) as the input to the gen-
erative models.

1806

Figure 7: Three different generative models for tackling the task of VQG.

4.1 Generative Models

Figure 7 represents an overview of our three gen-
erative models. The MELM model (Fang et al.,
2014) is a pipeline starting from a set of candi-
date word probabilities which are directly trained
on images, which then goes through a maximum
entropy (ME) language model. The MT model is
a Sequence2Sequence translation model (Cho et
al., 2014; Sutskever et al., 2014) which directly
translates a description of an image into a ques-
tion, where we used the MS COCO captions and
CaptionsBing−5000 as the source of translation.
These two models tended to generate less coher-
ent sentences, details of which can be found in the
supplementary material. We obtained the best re-
sults by using an end-to-end neural model, GRNN,
as follows.

Gated Recurrent Neural Network (GRNN):
This generation model is based on the state-of-the-
art multimodal Recurrent Neural Network model
used for image captioning (Devlin et al., 2015;
Vinyals et al., 2015). First, we transform the fc7
vector to a 500-dimensional vector which serves
as the initial recurrent state to a 500-dimensional
Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). We produce the out-
put question one word at a time using the GRU,
until we hit the end-of-sentence token. We train
the GRU and the transformation matrix jointly, but
we do not back-propagate the CNN due to the size
of the training data. The neural network is trained
using Stochastic Gradient Descent with early stop-

ping, and decoded using a beam search of size
8. The vocabulary consists of all words seen 3 or
more times in the training, which amounts to 1942
unique tokens in the full training set. Unknown
words are mapped to to an <unk> token during
training, but we do not allow the decoder to pro-
duce this token at test time.

4.2 Retrieval Methods

Retrieval models use the caption of a nearest
neighbor training image to label the test image
(Hodosh et al., 2013; Devlin et al., 2015; Farhadi
et al., 2010; Ordonez et al., 2011). For the task
of image captioning, it has been shown that up to
80% of the captions generated at test time by a
near state-of-the-art generation approach (Vinyals
et al., 2015) were exactly identical to the training
set captions, which suggests that reusing training
annotations can achieve good results. Moreover,
basic nearest neighbor approaches to image cap-
tioning on the MS COCO dataset are shown to out-
perform generation models according to automatic
metrics (Devlin et al., 2015). The performance of
retrieval models of course depends on the diversity
of the dataset.

We implemented several retrieval models cus-
tomized for the task of VQG. As the first step, we
compute K nearest neighbor images for each test
image using the fc7 features to get a candidate
pool. We obtained the most competitive results by
setting K dynamically, as opposed to the earlier

works which fix K throughout the testing. We ob-
served that candidate images beyond a certain dis-
tance made the pool noisy, hence, we establish a
parameter calledmax-distancewhich is an upper
bound for including a neighbor image in the pool.
Moreover, our experiments showed that if there
exists a very similar image to the test image, the
candidate pool can be ignored and that test image
should become the only candidate9. For address-
ing this, we set a min-distance parameter. All
these parameters were tuned on the correspond-
ing validation sets using the Smoothed-BLEU (Lin
and Och, 2004) metric against the human refer-
ence questions.

Given that each image in the pool has five ques-
tions, we define the one-best question to be the
question with the highest semantic similarity10 to
the other four questions. This results in a pool of K
candidate questions. The following settings were
used for our final retrieval models:

– 1-NN: Set K=1, which retrieves the closest im-
age and emits its one-best.

– K-NN+min: Set K=30 with max-distance =
0.35, and min-distance = 0.1. Among the 30

with distance ≤ 0.1 is 7.68%, 8.4% and 3.0% in COCO,

cess eliminates outlier questions per image.

candidate questions (one-best of each image), find
the question with the highest similarity to the rest
of the pool and emit that: we compute the textual
similarity according the two metrics, Smoothed-
BLEU and Average-Word2Vec (gensim)11.

Table 4 shows a few example images along with
the generations of our best performing systems.

of the project.

5 Evaluation

While in VQG the set of possible questions is
not limited, there is consensus among the natural
questions (discussed in Section 3.1) which enables
meaningful evaluation. Although human evalua-
tion is the ideal form of evaluation, it is impor-
tant to find an automatic metric that strongly corre-
lates with human judgment in order to benchmark
progress on the task.

5.1 Human Evaluation
The quality of the evaluation is in part determined
by how the evaluation is presented. For instance,

11Average-Word2Vec refers to the sentence-level textual
similarity metric where we compute the cosine similarity be-
tween two sentences by averaging their word-level Word2Vec
(Mikolov et al., 2013) vector representations. Here we use the
GenSim software framework (Řehůřek and Sojka, 2010).

1808



it is important for the human judges to see var-
ious system hypotheses at the same time in or-
der to give a calibrated rating. We crowdsourced
our human evaluation on AMT, asking three crowd
workers to each rate the quality of candidate ques-
tions on a three-point semantic scale.

5.2 Automatic Evaluation
The goal of automatic evaluation is to measure the
similarity of system-generated question hypothe-
ses and the crowdsourced question references. To
capture n-gram overlap and textual similarity be-
tween hypotheses and references, we use standard
Machine Translation metrics, BLEU (Papineni et
al., 2002) and METEOR (Denkowski and Lavie,
2014). We use BLEU with equal weights up to
4-grams and default setting of METEOR version
1.5. Additionally we use ∆BLEU (Galley et al.,
2015) which is specifically tailored towards gen-
eration tasks with diverse references, such as con-
versations. ∆BLEU requires rating per reference,
distinguishing between the quality of the refer-
ences. For this purpose, we crowd-sourced three
human ratings (on a scale of 1-3) per reference and
used the majority rating.

The pairwise correlational analysis of human
and automatic metrics is presented in Table 6,
where we report on Pearson’s r, Spearman’s ρ and
Kendall’s τ correlation coefficients. As this table
reveals, ∆BLEU strongly correlates with human
judgment and we suggest it as the main evaluation
metric for testing a VQG system. It is important
to note that BLEU is also very competitive with
∆BLEU, showing strong correlations with human
judgment. Hence, we recommend using BLEU for
any further benchmarking and optimization pur-
poses. BLEU can also be used as a proxy for
∆BLEU for evaluation purposes whenever rating
per reference are not available.

5.3 Results

In this section, we present the human and auto-
matic metric evaluation results of the models in-
troduced earlier. We randomly divided each VQG-
5000 dataset into train (50%), val (25%) and test
(25%) sets. In order to shed some light on differ-
ences between our three datasets, we present the
evaluation results separately on each dataset in Ta-
ble 5. Each model (Section 4.2) is once trained
on all train sets, and once trained only on its cor-
responding train set (represented as X in the re-
sults table). For quality control and further insight
on the task, we include two human annotations

among our models: ‘Humanconsensus’ (the same
as one-best) which indicates the consensus human
annotation on the test image and ‘Humanrandom’
which is a randomly chosen annotation among the
five human annotations.

It is quite interesting to see that among the hu-
man annotations, Humanconsensus achieves con-
sistently higher scores than Humanrandom. This
further verifies that there is indeed a common
intuition about what is the most natural ques-
tion to ask about a given image. As the re-
sults of human evaluation in Table 5 shows,
GRNNall performs the best as compared with all
the other models in 2/3 of runs. All the mod-
els achieve their best score on V QGCOCO−5000,
which was expected given the less diverse set of
images. Using automatic metrics, the GRNNX
model outperforms other models according to
all three metrics on the V QGBing−5000 dataset.
Among retrieval models, the most competitive is
K-NN+min bleu all, which performs the best on
V QGCOCO−5000 and V QGFlickr−5000 datasets
according to BLEU and ∆BLEU score. This fur-
ther confirms our effective retrieval methodology
for including min-distance and n-gram overlap
similarity measures. Furthermore, the boost from
1-NN to K-NN models is considerable according
to both human and automatic metrics. It is impor-
tant to note that none of the retrieval models beat
the GRNN model on the Bing dataset. This addi-
tionally shows that our Bing dataset is in fact more
demanding, making it a meaningful challenge for
the community.

6 Discussion

We introduced the novel task of ‘Visual Ques-
tion Generation’, where given an image, the sys-
tem is tasked with asking a natural question. We
provide three distinct datasets, each covering a
variety of images. The most challenging is the
Bing dataset, requiring systems to generate ques-
tions with event-centric concepts such as ‘cause’,
‘event’, ‘happen’, etc., from the visual input. Fur-
thermore, we show that our Bing dataset presents
challenging images to the state-of-the-art caption-
ing systems. We encourage the community to re-
port their system results on the Bing test dataset
and according to the ∆BLEU automatic metric.
All the datasets will be released to the public12.

This work focuses on developing the capabil-

ity to ask relevant and to-the-point questions, a
key intelligent behavior that an AI system should
demonstrate. We believe that VQG is one step
towards building such a system, where an engag-
ing question can naturally start a conversation. To
continue progress on this task, it is possible to in-
crease the size of the training data, but we also ex-
pect to develop models that will learn to generalize
to unseen concepts. For instance, consider the ex-
amples of system errors in Table 7, where visual
features can be enough for detecting the specific
set of objects in each image, but the system cannot
make sense of the combination of previously un-
seen concepts. Another natural future extension of
this work is to include question generation within
a conversational system (Sordoni et al., 2015; Li
et al., 2016), where the context and conversation
history affect the types of questions being asked.
