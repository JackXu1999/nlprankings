Abstract

The paper describes an ongoing effort aiming at building a sound-aligned cor-
pus of Udmurt spoken texts. The corpus currently consists of about 3.5 hours of
recordings, collected during fieldwork trips between 2014 and 2016. The record-
ings represent three dialect groups of Udmurt (Northern, Central and Southern).
The recordings were transcribed with the help of native speakers. All morpho-
logical peculiarities characteristic of spoken or dialectal Udmurt were faithfully
reflected, however, the transcription was somewhat normalized in order to fa-
cilitate morphological annotation and cross-dialectal search. The pipeline of our
project includes aligning the texts with the sound in ELAN and annotating them
with a morphological analyzer developed for standard Udmurt. We use auto-
matic annotation as a much less time-consuming alternative of manual glossing
and explore the resulting quality and the downsides of such annotation. We are
specifically investigating how much and what kind of change the standard ana-
lyzer requires in order to achieve sufficiently good annotation of spoken/dialectal
texts. The corpus has a web interface where the users may execute search queries
and listen to the audio. The online interface will be made publicly available in
2018.

Kivonat

Ezen tanulmányban egy pilot projektet mutatunk be, amely célja egy hang-
anyagot tartalmazó udmurt nyelvjárási korpusz építése. A készülő korpusz 2014
és 2016 között végzett terepmunkák során gyűjtött, jelenleg körülbelül 3,5 órá-
nyi lejegyzett hanganyagból áll, amely az udmurt nyelv fő nyelvjáráscsoportjait
(északi, közép- és déli nyelvjárásait) mutatja be. A hangfelvételek lejegyzése ud-
murt anyanyelvi beszélők segítségével történt. A lejegyzés hűen tükrözi a hang-
felvételeken előforduló, az udmurt nyelvjárásokra vagy az udmurt beszélt nyelv-
re jellemző morfológiai jelenségeket. A lejegyzés azonban fonetikai szempontból
bizonyos mértékben sztenderdizálva lett annak érdekében, hogy megkönnyítse a
szövegek morfológiai elemzését és a több nyelvjárásra kiterjedő keresést. A szö-
vegek feldolgozása a következő lépésekből áll: a szövegek ELAN-nal való lejegy-
zése (amelynek során a legjegyzett szöveg időben illesztve lesz a hanganyaghoz),

majd az udmurt irodalmi nyelvre fejlesztett morfológiai elemzővel való annotálá-

sok idő megspórolható a manuális annotáláshoz képest. Cikkünkben megvizsgál-
juk az automatikus annotálás alkalmazhatóságát, különös tekintettel arra, hogy
milyen mértékű és típusú módosításokat kell elvégezni az irodalmi udmurt nyelv-
re fejlesztett morfológiai elemzőn, hogy az a beszélt nyelvi és nyelvjárási szöve-

lehetővé teszi a felhasználók számára az adatok lekérdezését és a hanganyagmeg-
hallgatását. Az online felületet a 2018-as év folyamán nyilvánossá tervezzük ten-

Аннотация

В этой статье описывается текущий проект, в рамках которого плани-
руется создать звуковой корпус устных текстов на удмуртских диалектах.
Наш корпус в настоящий момент включает около 3,5 часов расшифрован-
ных записей на трёх группах удмуртских диалектов (северные, средин-
ные и южные), которые были собраны в ходе экспедиций 2014–2016 гг.
Все тексты были расшифрованы с помощью носителей. Все морфологиче-
ские особенности устных/диалектных текстов точно отражены в расшиф-
ровке, однако с фонетической точки зрения расшифровки были стандар-
тизованы, чтобы облегчить морфологическую разметку и одновременный
поиск в текстах на разных диалектах. Обработка данных в нашем проекте
включает в себя выравнивание расшифровок со звуком с помощью ELAN
и их автоматическую морфологическую разметку с помощью стандартно-
го удмуртского анализатора. Мы рассматриваем автоматическую размет-
ку как намного менее затратную альтернативу ручному глоссированию и
проводим оценку качества и минусов такой разметки. В особенности мы
рассматриваем вопрос о том, насколько сильно и как именно необходимо
изменить стандартный анализатор, чтобы добиться достаточно качествен-
ной разметки устных/диалектных текстов. Корпус имеет веб-интерфейс,
через который пользователи могут задавать поисковые запросы и прослу-
шивать фрагменты аудио. Этот интерфейс будет открыт для общего досту-
па в 2018 году.

1 Introduction
This paper summarizes the preliminary results and the future directions of building a
linguistic corpus of spoken texts from different Udmurt dialects.

Udmurt belongs to the Permic branch of the Uralic language family. Udmurt is
spoken mainly in the Udmurt Republic, but also in the Republic of Tatarstan, the
Republic of Bashkortostan, Perm Krai, Sverdlovsk Oblast and Kirov Oblast. According
to the Russian Census of 2010, there are about 325,000 speakers of Udmurt.¹ The
EGIDS level of Udmurt is 5, i.e. it is a developing language, which means that “[t]he
language is in vigorous use, with literature in a standardized form being used by some
though this is not yet widespread or sustainable”.² Standard Udmurt has an official
orthography based on the Cyrillic script. This orthography is taught in schools and is
familiar to most Udmurt speakers, regardless of their dialect.

As far as the existing corpora of Udmurt are concerned, we would like to men-
tion three recent projects aiming at building linguistic databases for Udmurt, namely

the Udmurt Corpus, the Beserman Corpus and the UraLUID database. The Udmurt
Corpus³ contains about 7.3 million tokens from mostly newspaper texts written in
standard Udmurt. The Beserman Corpus⁴ consists of transcribed oral texts in the Be-
serman dialect of Udmurt (currently, its size is about 65,000 tokens). The UraLUID
database⁵ encompasses both Udmurt texts collected in the 19th century as well as text
samples from two Udmurt blogs (the aim of this project was to create a database con-
taining at least 4000 tokens of these two types of Udmurt texts, see Simon and Mus
2017).

Our goal is to process fieldwork recordings collected between 2014 and 2016.
During these fieldwork trips, we collected contemporary spoken language material,
hence, the corpus is aimed to represent the spoken varieties of Udmurt. Additionally,
it is noteworthy that the recordings do not exemplify the standard Udmurt language
but rather its dialects. In this way, our corpus is a further step in the corpus building
efforts for Udmurt.

Needless to say, spoken texts are an irreplaceable source of valuable data for lin-
guists. This is especially true in the case of endangered and under-documented lan-
guages like Udmurt. This highlights the importance of making fieldwork data open
and reusable for the researchers, and possibly, for the native speaker community as
well.

However, collecting and transcribing recordings is an extremely long and expen-
sive process. The traditional approach to compiling spoken corpora includes align-
ing the transcription with the recording and then manually annotating the texts in
Toolbox or FLEX (for Beserman Udmurt see Arkhangelskiy et al. 2017; for Enets see
Khanina 2017). In this case, the annotation is by itself quite time-consuming and, in
case of small-scale project like ours, could keep researchers and fieldwork linguists
from processing and sharing their data. Hence, we took a different approach, namely
to sound-align the recordings manually, but annotate them automatically. This ap-
proach to text processing has been advocated in several recent language documenta-
tion projects, e.g. in the Ustya Basin Russian project (Waldenfels et al., 2014) as well
as in the Saami and Komi documentation project (Blokland et al., 2015), since it has
two advantages: first, it is much less time-consuming, and second, the corpus built in
this way can still be used for many research purposes.

In this paper, we discuss the workflow of our ongoing project and the obstacles we
faced in the process. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present the
Udmurt data used in the corpus with special reference to the metadata of the record-
ings. Then, in Section 3, we turn to the text processing steps, namely transcription
and morphological annotation. We present the transcription used in the corpus and
discuss several problematic cases in connection to it. As for the morphological anno-
tation, we used a morphological analyzer originally developed for standard Udmurt.
Given the fact that the corpus contains dialectal data, we had to make some adjust-
ments to the analyzer, which is another novelty of the project presented in this paper.
We specifically discuss the difficulties dialectal data pose with respect to morpholog-
ical annotation (Section 4). Finally, we briefly describe the main features of the user
interface of the corpus in Section 5.

2 Data
The Udmurt recordings used in this corpus were collected by Ekaterina Georgieva
during three fieldwork trips conducted between 2014 and 2016 in the Republic of Ud-
murtia (and partly in the Republic of Tatarstan). All audio data were recorded in .wav
format. The data represent different dialects of Udmurt, which we briefly overview
below.

The dialects of the Udmurt language are divided into four main groups, namely
the Northern, Central, Southern and Beserman dialect groups (Kelmakov, 1998, p.
41–44). The Southern dialect group is further divided into Southern dialects (spoken
in the southern parts of the Republic of Udmurtia) and Southern Peripheral dialects
(spoken in the Udmurt diasporas in Tatarstan, Bashkortostan, etc.).

Additionally, a division is made between “standard Udmurt” and its vernacular
varieties (Edygarova, 2014). Standard Udmurt is used mainly in written form. As
for the vernacular varieties of Udmurt, Edygarova (2014) distinguishes between local
and cross-local vernacular varieties. The local varieties of Udmurt show features of
a particular dialect, while in the cross-local varieties, features of mixed dialect and
standard forms occur (Edygarova, 2014, p. 379).

Taking into account these facts, we assume that the fieldwork recordings used in
the corpus represent the spoken varieties of Udmurt (that differ from its written vari-
ety, i.e. standard Udmurt) as well as exemplify certain dialectal features characteristic
of the speakers’ dialects. Nevertheless, they often contain standard forms alongside
the dialectal ones. For example, in the texts, we find infinitives in both -n (dialectal)
and -ni ̮ (standard), with the standard variant being slightly more frequent.

Now let us now take a closer look at the recordings used in our corpus. At present,
the recordings collected during the fieldwork conducted in July and August 2014 are
being processed. Below, we overview some basic metadata of these recordings, such
as the place of recording, the dialect recorded, the speakers participating in the inter-
views and the duration of the recording, see Table 1. As can be seen from the table, the
corpus is meant to cover (to a varying degree) the main dialects of Udmurt: Northern,
Central, Southern and Southern Peripheral.

During the fieldwork trips, the semi-structured interview method was chosen.
This format gave the speakers some freedom in the course of the interview. This
was needed in order to ensure the right settings for a natural recording. It should be



30

also emphasized that Udmurt was the only medium of the interviews. The interviews
cover different genres, such as narratives, informal conversations between speakers,
description of customs, etc.

Furthermore, the recordings fall into two groups regarding the number of speakers
participating in the interview. In some of the recordings, only one native speaker
was interviewed by the (non-native) fieldwork linguist, while in other recordings,
the informant(s) was/were interviewed with the help of another native speaker. In
the latter case, the result was a group conversation (featuring two or three native
speakers and the linguist).

3 Text processing
In this section, we present the steps of processing the recordings. First, we discuss
transcription and related issues. Then we proceed to the morphological analysis, for
which we used the analyzer developed for standard Udmurt with some necessary ad-
justments. More specifically, we evaluate the applicability of this analyzer to dialectal
data.

3.1 Transcription

The recordings were transcribed and time-aligned in ELAN⁶. ELAN allows to create
complex annotations for audio and video files. The annotations are organized in a lay-
ered structure, in so-called tiers. The audio files were utterance/sentence-level time-
aligned. Currently, the annotation of the recordings consists of two types of tiers:
transcription and fieldwork notes. In each recording, there is a separate transcription
and notes tier for each of the speakers (including the interviewer).

The first step of processing the audio files was the transcription. The transcription
was carried out with the help of native speakers (in some cases, a speaker of the
relevant dialect or one of the participants in the recording in question). Given the
fact that we are dealing with spoken language recordings showing dialectal features,
we had to make some principal decisions regarding the transcription we used. Let us
mention a couple of problems in oral texts: assimilations, colloquial forms, unfinished
words, hesitations, dialectal morphological features, etc. Below, we summarize the the
decisions we have made regarding the transcription used in the corpus. Our goal was
to apply these principles throughout, as consistency is one of the keys properties of
corpus building.

First of all, it should be emphasized that we did not aim at providing a phonetic
transcription. Hence, we chose the Cyrillic script used in the case of standard Ud-
murt, and not the Finno-Ugric Transcription System/Uralic Phonetic Alphabet⁷ or
the International Phonetic Alphabet. This made the transcribed texts consistent with
the standard Udmurt texts and also facilitated the morphological analysis of the tran-
scribed files. This choice was also motivated by the fact that our aim was to create a
valuable and useful corpus with limited resources and within a relatively short period
of time.

In contrast to other Cyrillic-based transcriptions of Udmurt oral texts (Kelmakov,
1998), we do not mark certain phonological processes, such as assimilations and non-
standard stress patterns. For example, in this text collection, the regressive assim-

ilation is transcribed, as in the verb forms like tod-sko (know-prs.1sg) used in the
Northern dialects, which is realized as totsko or tocko. Based on our data, it seems
that the devoicing always applies, hence, we prefer to transcribe this verb form sim-
ply asтодско instead ofтотско orтоцко. This transcription has the advantage that
we do not need to add a stem allomorph tot of the verb todin̮i ̮(to know). Additionally,
we also normalize certain colloquial forms, such as бенэть and капказьын to бен ведь
and капка азьын, respectively. However, we do mark the actual realization of these
colloquial forms in angle brackets (see in Table (2)). Hence, our decision in most cases
is to adhere to the standard orthography with some exceptions that we discuss below.

The most important exception is the transcription of dialectal morphological fea-
tures. Since our goal was to test whether the standard Udmurtmorphological analyzer
can deal with dialectal morphology, morphological features were always transcribed
according to their actual realization in the recordings. Moreover, our data show that
both the standard and the dialectal forms can be used in the same dialect or even
by the same speaker, for example, as mentioned above, we find infinitives in both -n
(dialectal form) and -ni ̮ (standard form). Hence, it was necessary to mark the actual
realization of the infinitive suffix.

Furthermore, we did not normalize dialectal lexical items, such as gidʼ (pigsty) and
tir̮iśen (since), corresponding to gid and dir̮iś̮en, respectively. In Section (4), we will
discuss how these lexical items have to be processed morphologically.

The third major deviation from the standard Udmurt orthography concerns the
transcription of compounds. We would like to stress that the standard orthography
is very inconsistent with respect to compounds: some of them are written as one
word, others are written with a hyphen, but most of them are written as two words.
Moreover, the descriptive studies are also inconclusive of what exactly counts as a
compound in Udmurt (Fejes, 2005). Hence, we decided to hyphenate all potential
instances of compounding in the corpus.

Our transcription approach resembles the one adopted by (Waldenfels et al., 2014).
On the one hand, we do not standardize the text on morphological level, so that the
users can search for dialectal morphological features. On the other hand, we standard-
ize the spelling to a certain extent to make it consistent throughout the corpus. This
approach gives us two advantages. First, it minimizes the changes we have to make to
the standard Udmurt morphological analyzer in order to apply it to our data. Second,
it allows the users to search certain morphemes, words and lemmata in all dialects
at once, while otherwise they would have to take into account all possible phonetic
variants. Since the corpus has sound alignment, the users can still research dialectal
phonetics by listening to the examples they find, regardless of the simplifications in
the transcription.

Additionally, we chose to mark certain discourse and extralinguistic elements in
the transcription.⁸ This was motivated not only by the fact that we aimed at tran-
scribing the recordings as precisely as possible, but also by the fact that we aimed
at building a multi-purpose corpus. The conventions we adopted are listed in Table
(2). It should be emphasized that we transcribed only those discourse elements that
occurred inside the utterances. External noise, such as coughing, laughing, etc. that
occurred between the utterances were not transcribed. A further convention of our
transcription is that sentences start with lower case letters, and capitals are used only
to mark proper names.

⁸We are grateful to Katalin Mády and Uwe Reichel for their suggestions regarding this part of the
transcription.

3.2 Morphological analysis

Themorphological analysis was carried out using an open-source rule-based morpho-
logical analyzer used previously for processing written texts in standard Udmurt¹⁰.
The rules it uses consist of a dictionary, where the lexemes are listed together with
their stems, part-of-speech tags and Russian translations, and a formalized description
of the morphology.

Before processing the texts, we compiled a frequency list of word forms from our
texts and manually added to the dictionary about 30 lexemes that were absent there,
but frequent in the texts. This list included dialectal variants of several frequentwords,
such as the postposition śajen instead of śamen (in some way/language), the particle
bon, several place names discussed in the texts, as well as the deictic adverb series
with the stem so- (these correspond to the o-adverbs in standard Udmurt).

⁹The question clitic а is also hyphenated, as required by the standard orthography.

33

After themorphological analysis, part of the ambiguity was removedwith the help
of a small set of Constraint Grammar rules (Bick and Didriksen, 2015). These rules
have also been developed for standard Udmurt and cover only several prominent cases
where the ambiguity can be eliminated with near-total accuracy.

Statistics regarding the quality of morphological analysis were calculated based
on a pilot portion of texts, which contains about 2,500 words in the Southern dialect
(30 minutes of sound). Initially, the proportion of the tokens that did not receive any
analysis reached 13.9%. However, after performing the small dictionary enhancement
described above, this proportion fell to 10.1%, which nearly equaled the proportion
for the written texts in standard Udmurt (9.5%)¹¹. In accordance with the Zipf’s law,
half of this improvement could have been achieved by adding only four new lexical
entries.

The results of the morphological annotation in the case of Udmurt dialectal texts
can be explained by two opposite trends. On the one hand, our texts have higher
proportion of lexemes and features characteristic of spoken/dialectal Udmurt, which
are not recognized by the analyzer. On the other, the speakers use more basic vocab-
ulary without the complex neologisms one often encounters in standard Udmurt, and
especially, in the Udmurt newspaper texts, which makes it easier for the analyzer.
The ambiguity rate, about 1.4 analyses per analyzed token, was also approximately
equal to that of the written texts. Although these results are preliminary and may be
imprecise due to the size of the test corpus, they show that in general, it is possible to
use the standard analyzer with minimal additions to process dialectal oral texts.

According to a very rough estimate, dialect and spoken features account for around
25% of the unanalyzed tokens. The rest consists of Russian loanwords (45%), proper
names (15%) and standard Udmurt vocabulary handled incorrectly by the parser due
to the incompleteness of the dictionary or the morphological description (also 15%).
The 25% dialect-specific unanalyzed tokens will be discussed in more detail in the next
section.

4 Problems with processing dialectal data
During text processing of dialectal data, several problems might arise. These concern
the dialectal vocabulary andmorphology, and to some extent, the orthography. Below,
we summarize the main obstacles we had to face while processing Udmurt dialectal
texts, and the solutions we came up with.

4.1 Dialectal vocabulary

One of themost obvious obstacles to processing dialectal data is the vocabulary, which
may differ from that of the standard language. However, in reality, differences in vo-
cabulary do not constitute a big problem. Dialectal nouns and verbs occur sporadically
in standard Udmurt texts, they usually appear in standard Udmurt dictionaries, thus,
many of them have been already included in the dictionary of the analyzer. For in-
stance, when processing Southern texts, we added the noun ajšet (apron). Although
this noun is marked as dialectal in Kirillova’s (2008) dictionary, it could and should

¹¹The figures for both corpora were calculated by the authors in November 2017. Currently, the propor-
tion of unanalyzed tokens is less than 5% in both of them due to an enhancement of the analyzer dictionary,
which was performed later.



34

have already been added to the dictionary of the analyzer because it appears 193 times
in the corpus of standard Udmurt.

Dialectal variants of words are more problematic. Dialectal variants in our case
included stems that were slightly different from their standard Udmurt counterparts,
such as ńilʼ instead of ńil̮ʼ (four); gidʼ instead of gid (pigsty); and nal/nnal instead of
nunal (day). There are two possible approaches regarding these cases. The first is to
include them in the dictionary as separate entries. The second one is to list them in
the existing entries as stem variants. We chose to adhere to the latter strategy. For
example, the word nal is assigned the lemma nunal and can be found as one of its
forms in the corpus. Nevertheless, it is still possible to find all words with the stem
nal- because the segmentation of words into morphemes is stored in the analyzed
files.

Furthermore, adverbs and words that belong to closed grammatical classes are es-
pecially problematic. We added to the dictionary words belonging to several closed
classes, such as series of deictic adverbs in so-, particles (e.g. gin̮ek (only)) and post-
positions (e.g. tir̮iś (since)). All of them have standard Udmurt counterparts, but are
better analyzed as separate entries. Although these words constitute less than half of
the lexemes we needed to add, they account for the majority of unanalyzed words in
terms of token frequency.

4.2 Dialectal morphology

Dialectal morphology constitutes a double problem for the annotation. On the one
hand, most words with dialectal suffixes simply will be left unanalyzed because they
are absent from the morphological description of the analyzer. On the other hand,
adding all of these suffixes may give rise to another problem, namely morphological
ambiguity. This happens in cases when the dialectal morpheme homophonous with
another morpheme used in standard Udmurt.

The solution that we applied in most of these cases was to add the lacking suffix
to the grammatical description of the analyzer. In some of the cases, we also had
to make changes to the dictionary, by adding stem allomorphs to certain lexemes.
Finally, when we were dealing with the features that could increase ambiguity, we
introduced additional constraints. Below, we list the suffixes we had to add in order
to analyze the Southern texts, with special reference to the potential ambiguity.

• Epenthetic -j- in an intervocalic position. This concerns primarily the plural
marker, which has the form -os after vowels and -jos after consonants in the
standard language. In Southern texts, due to the epenthesis, the suffix -josmight
be used in both cases. This variation never leads to ambiguity.

• Dialectal variants of case markers: -iś (-iś̮ in standard Udmurt) for the elative
and -ťi instead of -ti for the prolative. Both do not lead to ambiguity.

• Converb in -ki ̮ (-ku in standard Udmurt). Does not lead to ambiguity.

• Converb in -sa instead of -is̮a. Both variants exist in the standard language,
but, just as with the infinitive marker, -sa is restricted to the non-a-stems. In
Southern texts, -sa can be used with all stems. This variant does not lead to
ambiguity.

• Plural negative verbal form in -ele (-e in standard Udmurt), used with non-a-
stems. Does not lead to ambiguity.



35

• Assimilated iterative suffix -ća instead of -ja, following -t. This variant should
not lead to ambiguity. Since this suffix is not fully productive, it occurs in both
the dictionary and the grammar components of the analyzer. The combina-
tions of verbal stems with the -ja suffix are stored in the dictionary. However,
its quite frequent combination with the causative suffix, -(e)t-ja, is stored in
the grammar component. Therefore, unlike other cases on this list, this dialec-
tal morphological feature should be handled by both adding the suffix to the
grammar and adding stem variants to the dictionary.

• Colloquial verb forms. A handful of frequent verb forms have widespread col-
loquial versions, e.g. šuko/ško instead of šu-iśko (say-prs.1sg). We added these
forms to the dictionary as separate entries with standard lemmata.

• Infinitive in -n/-in̮ instead of the standard Udmurt suffix -ni/̮-in̮i.̮ The -n/-ni ̮
variant attaches to the stems ending in -a, while -in̮/-in̮i ̮ attaches to all other
stems. Since -in̮ is the standard Udmurt locative marker, this can lead to ambi-
guity in cases when there is a nominal stem homonymous with a verbal stem.
There are quite few such pairs, but they include frequent words, such as ul-in̮
(live-inf vs. under-loc), or zor-in̮ (rain:V-inf vs. rain:N-loc). The situation
could be partly amended by the Constraint Grammar rules, since there are not
so many frequent contexts where an infinitive could appear. There is, however,
a bigger problem with the a-stems because -n is the standard Udmurt nominal-
ization suffix for these stems, cf. uža-n (work-inf vs. work-nmlz). The deriva-
tion of n-nominalizations in Udmurt is fully productive and very frequent.

• Non-standard morphophonology of -śk-. In Udmurt, -śk- is used as a present
tense marker as well as a passivizing/intransitivizing suffix. Descriptively, it
has been observed that this suffix can have different morphological realizations
in the Udmurt dialects (Kelmakov, 1998, p. 147–150). We will explore the con-
sequences of this dialectal variation with respect to the processing of the oral
texts.
In the presence of the suffix -śk-, the preceding -d/-t is elided regardless of its
morphological status. This can give rise to several problems:

1. First, we have to add stem variants for all verbs ending in -d/-t: tod+śko
might be realized as to-śko (know-prs.1sg).

2. Second, the biggest problem stems from the fact that passive can be – and
frequently is – preceded by the causative suffix -(e)t-. The causative suffix
might be elided, too, which leads to ambiguity. For instance, the verb form
todma-śk-i-di ̮can represent two different cases: (i) recognize-pass-pst-2pl
or (ii) recognize-caus:pass-pst-2pl, in the latter of which the causative
suffix has been elided. This kind of ambiguity can be partly resolved by
rules if there is transitivity information in the dictionary, since intransitive
verbs can only have impersonal 3sg passive forms. We have manually
added transitivity information to the dictionary. However, in the case of
transitive stems or 3sg forms, the ambiguity will remain. Currently, the
analyzer does not annotate these transitive verb forms as containing a
zero causative to avoid significant amount of ambiguity that would follow.
Consequently, the form todmaśkidi,̮ which actually contains a causative
suffix in our corpus, is treated incorrectly by the analyzer.

It should be noted that the same phonological process sometimes works even
in the cases where the segment -śk- is part of the stem and not a suffix, as with
the dialectal verb uśkin̮i ̮(look), standard form of which is ućkin̮i ̮ . Therefore, we
have to locate such verbs in the dictionary and add stem variants for them as
well.

Below, we summarize our preliminary notes regarding the morphological pecu-
liarities of the Northern texts, which we have started processing. The Northern di-
alects share some of the non-standard features described above (epenthetic -j, infini-
tive in -n, shortened verbal forms, converbs in -sa, consonant assimilation before the
suffix -ja). Here we only touch upon some of the features absent in Southern texts.

• A series of personal-local case markers, e.g. -ńe. Personal-local suffixes are
a combination of the marker -ń- with one of the spatial cases, and convey the
meaning ‘at/to/from/through one’s place’ (Teplyashina, 1981). They do not lead
to ambiguity.

• Frequentative suffix -il̮l- instead of -il̮-. Does not lead to ambiguity.

• Limitative converb in -ććoź instead of -toź. Does not lead to ambiguity.

• Non-standard forms of -śk-. The suffix -śk-, as it was stated above, has several
dialectal variants. In the Northern texts, it often appears as -sk- and devoices
the preceding consonant. Unlike its Southern counterpart, the Northern vari-
ant does not pose a problem to the analysis if the transcription is somewhat
standardized, e.g. when todsko (know-prs.1sg) is spelled asтодско rather than
тоцко or тотско, cf. Section 3.

• Non-standard forms of personal and reflexive pronouns. Certain case forms
of personal and, especially, reflexive pronouns used in the Northern texts are
non-standard, such asmilʼemesti ̮(we.acc)with the standard form beingmilʼemiz̮.
Since these forms of the pronouns are morphologically irregular, all of them
need to be stored in the dictionary. We added the dialectal form to the dictio-
nary as well, which did not lead to any ambiguity.

4.3 Orthography

Apart from lexical and grammatical challenges, there are also challenges related to
orthography. The cases that involve non-standard tokenization are especially prob-
lematic. A large share of these cases is represented by compounds which consist of
two nominal stems, or by complex numerals. Nominal compounds are frequent in
Udmurt, and all but a relatively small number of them are written as two separate
words according to the standard orthography. When we transcribed compounds, we
wrote them with a hyphen regardless of their lexicalization degree and stress pat-
tern. We took a similar approach in the case of numerals like kiź̮ odig (twenty-one),
which are always written as separate words in standard Udmurt, but are hyphenated
in the corpus. Although hyphenation of all compounds and numerals diverges from
the official orthography and does not capture the difference between lexicalized and
non-lexicalized compounds, it allows the users to easily find all such instances and
decide for themselves.

5 User interface
Our corpus will be accessible for the linguistic community through an online web-
interface.¹² We use the open source tsakorpus platform, which was developed by
Timofey Arkhangelskiy and is available under an MIT license¹³. Each ELAN file is
passed through morphological analyzer and Constraint Grammar disambiguator. The
analyzed file is stored in JSON format, which is then uploaded to an Elasticsearch
database. The functions of the web interface include: search by word, lemma, Rus-
sian translation, grammatical tags and their combinations; searchwith regular expres-
sions; search for specific allomorphs of a morpheme; multi-word search; and selecting
texts based on metadata values. Users are able to see or download sentences that con-
tain the requested words, listen to the sound aligned with the sentence, get frequency
lists of words, and chart word distribution e.g. by dialect. Source Cyrillic orthog-
raphy and automatically transliterated Uralic Phonetic Alphabet representation are
supported. The interface is available in English and Russian, but other languages can
be easily added to this list. Currently, we are testing the interface. We intend to make
it publicly available in 2018.

6 Conclusions
In this paper, we presented an ongoing project in the course of which we are going
to develop a sound-aligned corpus of spoken texts in Udmurt dialects. Our workflow
consists of transcribing and aligning the texts in ELAN using (mainly) standard or-
thography, automatic morphological analysis with partial rule-based disambiguation,
and publishing the recordings online using a publicly available web interface. Stan-
dardization of orthography enables cross-dialectal search and facilitates automatic
processing of the texts. We demonstrated that a morphological analyzer for the stan-
dard language works sufficiently well for our data, and can be relatively easily ad-
justed for the annotation to be comparable in quality to that of the standard Udmurt
texts. We also outlined the obstacles we faced in the process. Some of them are caused
by the inconsistencies of the standard orthography, while others stem from the am-
biguity introduced by dialectal variants of morphemes. We believe that the same
workflow can be applied by other researchers who have dialectal recordings at hand
to efficiently produce valuable dialectal corpora with relatively small investments of
time or resources.
