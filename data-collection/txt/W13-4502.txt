Abstract

In order to achieve high-level resilience
against disasters, effective utilization of
previous emergency management infor-
mation is necessary. The goal of this
project is to establish effective utiliza-
tion of emergency management informa-
tion and emergency response logs that are
accumulated as a fundamental dataset to
learn lessons for emergencies in the fu-
ture. More precisely, we develop a frame-
work that simplifies structuring emer-
gency management information and cre-
ating databases through various media or
formats by exploiting technologies such
as natural language processing to fix the
bottlenecks for inputting information in
emergency response sites, to share disas-
ter state, and to contribute towards achiev-
ing more effective use of human resources.
The academic aim of this project is to
establish the task of creating a database
of emergency management information as
a subfield of natural language processing
applications.

1 Introduction

In order to confront natural disasters which could
become a national crisis, high-level resilience
against disasters is required. To achieve this, it is
necessary to assume emergency situations, prompt
actions for emergencies, and conduct quick and
correct restorations and recoveries. This requires
effective use of emergency management informa-
tion.

In response to the 2011 Tohoku earth-
quake/tsunami in Japan, a strong desire for the de-
velopment of new methods to improve emergency
response came about. The basic framework for
emergency management by local governments is

the following: (i) As soon as a disaster takes place,
the local government organizes a headquarter for
disaster control, which consists of the mayor (as
the director-general) and directors from executive
branches (Water and Sewer Division, Civil En-
gineering Division, etc.) as well as representa-
tives from the police, the fire station, etc. (ii)
Each executive branch collects disaster informa-
tion from a large variety of sources and responds to
requests from disaster sites. (iii) The collected in-
formation is conveyed to the headquarter and also
shared with other branches so that the headquarter
and branches can effectively cooperate with each
other. (iv) The headquarter keeps the situation in
perspective and makes local government-wide de-
cisions. (v) A summary of the accumulated dis-
aster information and responses is communicated
to neighboring local governments and the higher
administrative division (i.e. prefecture or state).

As the reader may imagine from the above, the
most important key for this whole system to work
effectively is communication; i.e. the key issue
is how efficiently and precisely information about
the progress situation and the responses against it
can be shared among the executive branches and
the headquarter together with the outside of the
disaster site. Unfortunately, however, the 3.11
earthquake revealed that in most local govern-
ments in the disaster-hit areas, the current means
for emergency management communication was
crucially inefficient, which sometimes caused mis-
communications and prohibited the disaster con-
trol headquarters from making optimal or appro-
priate decisions. While the inefficiency of com-
munication was partly due to severe damages of
communication networks, critical problems arose
even under the situation where communication
networks were available. In most of the local
governments in the disaster-hit areas, each piece
of information from outside (through phone calls,
radio communications, etc.) was recorded only

by hand writing and thus distributed to divisions
in charge only by oral communication or through
white boards as shown in Figure 1. This makes
it difficult to efficiently share emergency manage-
ment information among divisions and local gov-
ernments, also hinders promptly update status of
disaster response.

In contrast, in the United States, WebEOC
(EOC: Emergency Operation Center), a web
browser-based information system conformable
to a standardization of incident management by
NIMS (National Incident Management System),
has been introduced to more than 80% of the state
governments, and has achieved effective emer-
gency responses. To operate the systems, pro-
fessional employees are hired at each crisis man-
agement office to manually input emergency man-
agement information as structured information us-
ing a computer. Standardization of information
management in crisis situations has internationally
progressed and has been recommended for ISO
22320. On the other hand, such emergency man-
agement information systems have not been intro-
duced to actual situations in Japan.

It is not enough that simply converting emer-
gency management information from a large va-
riety of sources to unstructured texts. Realizing
quick and correct restoration and utilization of
them for the future disasters needs making them as
structured information to be searchable by storing,
classifying and organizing them. The structuriza-
tion consists of selecting one of database schemas
and search its items from texts, and prohibitively

high cost will be required if the operation is per-
formed by human. In order to operate such system
with limited resources, reducing the cost of struc-
turization is essential.

Given this background, we have launched a
government-founded three-year project to develop
a system that assists with creating databases of
emergency management information to digitize,
accumulate and utilize them. We address the fol-
lowing three issues in this project.

Designing standard DB schemas for emergency
management information By analyzing actual
emergency response operations, we design stan-
dard DB schemas for emergency management in-
formation that can be commonly applied for di-
verse local governments.

Developing a system that assist with creating
emergency management information databases
By further advancement of natural language pro-
cessing technologies, we develop a system that ef-
ficiently stores unstructured emergency manage-
ment information to databases. This system at first
extracts important information from unstructured
texts, selects one of database schemas, and finally
fills each of the elements with a corresponding ex-
pression in a text, as shown in Figure 2.

Environmental improvement for the usage of
emergency management information systems
We develop a training package that includes di-
verse and real scenario data and analyzes issues of
developing information and communication tech-
nologies for emergency response through experi-

In addition, we develop a system that uni-
fies these research outcomes and evaluates per-
formance of the developed system by conducting
experiments cooperated with the emergency man-
agement information system. Through discussions
of technical and systematic issues we will have,
we find knowledge for deploying the system into
the field.

2 Research Issues and Plans in Our
Project

In this project, we develop an emergency manage-
ment information database creation support sys-
tem using speech recognition and natural language
processing technologies as shown in Figure 3. To
do this, we (1) design emergency management
information schemas, (2) develop an emergency
management information database creation sup-
port system whose inputs consist of various forms
of information such as speeches, faxes with hand-
written characters, and so on, and (3) improve the
environment for the usage of the emergency man-
agement information system. In addition, we in-
corporate the developed system into WebEOC, a
standard emergency management information sys-
tem, and then conduct demonstration experiments
with the developed system by cooperating with lo-
cal governments to analyze technical and system-
atic issues in deploying the system into the field.
The detailed explanations of the tasks we address
are explained as follows.

2.1 Task 1: Designing Emergency
Management Information Schemas

In this task, we at first analyze emergency re-
sponse operations thus far in local governments
cooperating in this project. We then design
and standardize emergency management informa-
tion schemas and develop a system that assists
with creating emergency management information
databases. In addition, we develop a framework
that automatically creates emergency management
information in conjunction with WebEOC.

In our prior work, we developed a set of emer-
gency management information schemas applica-
ble to earthquake emergencies in local govern-
ments. In this project, we develop such schemas
applicable for not only local governments, but
also umbrella organizations of them, such as
ordinance-designated cities and administrative di-
visions of Japan, and for central governments. In
addition, we design a set of standardized schemas
applicable for other emergency situations such as
wind damage, flood damage, eruption and pan-
demics. In research and development, we not only
clean up elements of emergency management in-
formation, but also extract and standardize them
to be able to apply for several emergencies and lo-
cal governments by analyzing results of demon-
stration experiments. More precisely, we first go
to interview employees of disaster affected local
governments. Next, we organize disaster response
instances in chronological order by referring vari-
ous forms of histories and analyze them to clear is-
sues regarding emergency information processing.
Because there are local governments who man-

age pieces of emergency information using paper-
based media such as FAX and share them in their
own formats as shown in Figure 4, we consider
the needs for these local governments by establish-
ing sharable and flexible emergency management
information schemas customizable for each local
government.

Then, we standardize emergency management
information schemas through comparison to out-
comes of previous work. Standardization of emer-
gency management information schemas is con-
ducted through several opportunities such as do-
mestic or international conferences, and developed
on a cloud-based system. For this, we develop
a guideline of the cloud-based system as a emer-
gency management cloud through ASPIC (ASP-
SaaS-Cloud Consortium) 1 and encourage broad
use of the system.

2.1.1 Research Issues and Plan
Toward efficient sharing of emergency responses,
United States defined Incident Command System
(ICS) Forms, a standard of federal emergency
management, in which items required for ICS are
defined. The templates of them were provided to

1http://www.aspicjapan.org/

WebEOC. However, it is unclear whether those
forms are both necessary and sufficient for operat-
ing response activities. Additionally, they may not
be applicable to response in Japan. In a Kashihara
city case study, Higashida et al. (2012) created
operational templates to deal with necessary data.
Schemas of the templates indicate necessary data
items for operations. They are, however, not
based on information in actual response. In or-
der to establish standard emergency management
schemas which are applicable for various types
of emergency situations and usable in ordinance-
designated cities, the administrative divisions of
Japan and central governments, we interview lo-
cal governments to draw out information of past
emergencies and analyze them to address the is-
sue.

2.2 Task 2: Development of an Emergency
Management Information Database
Creation Support System

The task of developing an emergency management
information database creation support system con-
sists of (a) development of emergency manage-
ment information structurization technologies and
(b) development of a user interface for creating

emergency management information databases.

2.2.1 Developing Emergency Management
Information Structurization
Technology

We assume that inputs in the system are dig-
itized unstructured texts transformed from pri-
mary emergency management information such as
sounds and papers, e-mails, and social networks.
We develop a structurization technology that auto-
matically extracts information which corresponds
to items in schemas from unstructured texts.

Considering actual use of this technology, we
have to handle not only text data but also speeches
and images. However, considering the fact that
this research has a limited time frame of only
three years, we decided to concentrate on creat-
ing databases from digitized, unstructured texts.
Since speech recognition performance depends on
speech environment, acoustic model, etc., it is
necessary to consider such factors into improve
the accuracy of speech recognition which digi-
tize emergency management information. In this
project, we assume that speech input is performed
by some particular operators. This enables us to
provide invariable environment for speech recog-
nition. Also we consider using a fixed form for
reading out emergency management information.
On the other hand, existing hand-written character

recognition technologies are currently not reliable
for use, so it would be necessary to read hand-
written texts out loud and digitize the speech via
speech recognition.

Structurizing emergency management informa-
tion of digitized texts and converting them as
databases can be seen as a task of information ex-
traction. However, in contrast to the traditional in-
formation extraction tasks, our task is more com-
plicated and challenging because there are diverse
types of entries in emergency management infor-
mation schemas to fill. For example, this task
requires handling various types of information:
not only named entities but also domain-specific
events (subside, fire, etc.), modality information
(e.g. available), etc. Since we have already de-
veloped several natural language processing tech-
nologies, we advance these technologies along
with taking measures to adopt them for emergency
management information. Also, as shown in Fig-
ure 2, various linguistic knowledge and domain
knowledge are required to structurize emergency
management information. For instance, we have
to recognize that a cross represents a point in a
road, the cross is located in a particular area, and
“can pass through” means “the road is available”.
Thus exhaustive acquisition of such knowledge is
critical to the successful development of this tech-
nology. We also advance investigating technolo-

14



gies of large-scale linguistic and domain knowl-
edge acquisition from web pages.

2.2.2 Development of a User Interface of the
Emergency Management Information
Database Creation Support System

For the emergency management information
databases we design in this project, we prepare
schemas for more than ten divisions of local gov-
ernments and define dozens of items for each of
the schemas. The structurization we described in
Section 2.2.1 requires extraction of extremely fine-
grained database items from natural language text,
and this kind of difficult task setting has not yet
been explored in previous work. Thus, instead of
using system outputs without change, we need a
system which can easily display choices presented
by the system for operators to select. To address
this, we develop a high-quality framework that ef-
ficiently create databases from unstructured emer-
gency management information by effectively us-
ing emergency management information structur-
ization technologies. These technologies are im-
proved through interactions with users and ma-
chine learning approaches which enable us to dy-
namically improve the performance of the system
by user feedback.

2.2.3 Research Issues and Plan

The structurization includes diverse information
extraction subtasks including named entity recog-
nition (NER) such as location names (city, road,
etc.), facility names (shelter, shop, school, etc.),
numerical expression identification and normaliz-
ing, relation extraction (RE), location name dis-
ambiguation and slot filling.

In Message Understanding Conference (MUC)
(Grishman and Sundheim, 1996) and Automatic
Content Extraction (ACE) (Doddington et al.,
2004) communities, various information extrac-
tion tasks including named entity recognition, re-
lation extraction and slot filling have been ex-
plored. The task of disambiguation location ex-
pressions is called toponymy disambiguation, and
has been explored by (Buscaldi and Rosso, 2008b;
Buscaldi, 2010; Buscaldi, 2011; Habib and van
Keulen, 2013; Bo et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2013)
and GeoNLP Project2. For the task of disam-
biguation location names, Buscaldi and Rosso de-
veloped Geo-WordNet (2008a) in which entries

2http://agora.ex.nii.ac.jp/GeoNLP/

of location names are coupled with their coordi-
nates. TAC Knowledge Base Population (KBP)
(McNamee and Dang, 2009; Ji et al., 2010a; Ji
et al., 2010b) also has dealt with the task of entity
disambiguation task as an entity linking problem
where systems are required to link entity mentions
to corresponding database entries. The difficulty
of our task is that we have to detect fine-grained
actual locations of location expressions which can
include not only named entities but also expres-
sions with general nouns (e.g. the convenience
store in front of the station). Such disambigua-
tion of general location expressions is a major is-
sue since systems are required to predict actual en-
tities from contextual information, etc. There is no
previous work that addresses this kind of difficult
task setting.

Also, how to collaborate with speech recog-
nition systems is an important issue. Since the
performance of the state-of-the-art speech recog-
nition system is not perfect, we explore how to
input emergency management information effec-
tively and accurately from speeches.

Customizability is also an important require-
ment to make the system applicable for various lo-
cal governments because processes of emergency
management information can be different for each
local government. We establish effective cus-
tomizing methods through cooperating with local
government employees.

2.3 Task 3: Environment Improvement for
the Usage of Emergency Management
Information Systems

In the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011, it was
indicated that emergency response requires infor-
mation sharing between departments or organiza-
tions. In order to implement cross-organizational
information sharing in disasters, it is essential to
regularly hold emergency drills. Regarding drills,
Hu et al. (2007) developed techniques for munic-
ipal employees to create drill scenarios reflecting
local characteristics, by using samples. Motoya et
al. (2009) examined emergency training manage-
ment systems considering human resources devel-
opment. The previous studies, however, were not
focused on scenario contents which enable offi-
cials to enhance information sharing skills. It is
essential in disasters to collect and handle infor-
mation, create common operational pictures, and
use them. Drill scenarios are required to check and

15



improve such skills. It is important to best utilize
practical response data of the Earthquake to cre-
ate such scenarios and implement drills to provide
them.

For improvement of the environment for the us-
age of emergency management information sys-
tems, we prepare manuals that describe usage of
the emergency management information systems
and the database schemas used in the system.
Also, we develop a scenario dataset for emergency
drills. More precisely, we generate (a) hazard and
damage maps for the purpose of training in emer-
gency situations using a Web service we have de-
veloped. In addition, we create (b) a progress sce-
nario of issues to be addressed based on the emer-
gency management manuals, responses for flood
damages, research results regarding cause-effect
structures and the interview for employees in dis-
aster affected local governments. Based on (a) and
(b), we create a drill scenario dataset while appro-
priately including emergency responses for sev-
eral emergency situations. Since we use the emer-
gency management information database creation
support system in training, we conduct situation
annotation by using appropriate media consistent
with the input interface of the system. Also, the
drill scenario dataset will be used as a data for
developing several structurization technologies in
Task 2. To exploit the drill scenario data, we make
the dataset capable, especially in size, for training
machine learning models. This scenario dataset
will also be used as an evaluation scenario for con-
ducting demonstration experiments. In addition,
we prepare a useful manual that describes the us-
age of the scenario dataset by clarifying required
contents of the manual in the demonstration exper-
iments.

2.3.1 Research Issues and Plan
In the improvement of the environment for the us-
age of emergency management information sys-
tems, we need emergency response data to de-
velop drill scenarios. However, so far, digitized
emergency responses have not been accumulated
as archives. The records of emergency responses
in Tohoku earthquake/tsunami have especially not
been digitized, which can be effectively utilized
to conduct emergency response training for poten-
tial Nankai Trough off the coast of western Japan.
Developing training datasets and designing emer-
gency management systems require actual emer-
gency management records that are digitized and

recorded in a unified way. However, there are
several local governments which cannot provide
such records. In order to address this issue, we
develop a drill scenario data by enhancing lim-
ited emergency response data obtained from inter-
views for emergency responders by complement-
ing them with damage information and status in-
formation. In addition, we take every possible
means to develop drill scenario data by examining
media used for situation annotation and consider-
ing status change due to emergency responses. Af-
ter the development, we improve the data by ask-
ing employees in charge of disasters in local gov-
ernments to check the data. By developing a mul-
tiple drill scenarios, we make the data applicable
for various local governments.

To encourage broad use of the system, we
demonstrate the system and conduct emergency
response training in the local governments that co-
operated with us. In the encouragement, we make
the system cloud-based and construct a system
which makes it easily available to conduct training
in local governments through networks. In making
the system cloud-based, we follow ISO22320, the
standard of emergency management.

3 Current Status

We have already developed cooperative relations
with some disaster affected local governments and
have analyzed emergency response records pro-
vided by them in regards to how many contacts
were received for each division, etc. From the
analysis, we obtained fundamental information
which should be considered in the development of
database schemas. By analyzing the documents
of the emergency management headquarter, we
found that (i) updates of emergency information
are mainly focused on 3 days after the disaster
and (ii) understanding an overview of the disas-
ter is easily accomplished by organizing and fix-
ing items of emergency management information
beforehand, etc.

Based on the data and the analysis, we devel-
oped a sample scenario data consisting of 100 en-
tries and used it as reference data for designing
the system. Table 1 shows some entries extracted
from the developed scenario data.

Based on the data, we analyzed the task
of creating emergency management information
databases in the light of natural language process-
ing, and designed a flow consisting of structur-

ization of natural language texts, template selec-
tion, information extraction, and error correction
by humans. In the structurization of natural lan-
guage texts, we found that we need morphologi-
cal analysis, chunking, dependency parsing, coor-
dination analysis, entity extraction, event extrac-
tion, numerical expression recognition, location
expression recognition, relation extraction, modal-
ity analysis, voice analysis, aspect analysis, exis-
tence analysis, clause relation analysis, discourse
relation analysis and anaphora resolution.

We have started to develop linguistic analyzers
required for the development of the proposed sys-
tem, including a numerical expression recognizer,
location expression recognizer, relation extractor,
etc. As of now, the developed system is still in
infant stage.

4 Conclusion

In this paper, we described an overview of our
project, developing a system that assists structur-
ing of emergency management information, and
its current status. To utilize emergency manage-
ment information in order to improve resilience
against emergencies, we develop a framework that
simplifies structuring emergency management in-
formation through various media or formats by
exploiting natural language processing technolo-

gies. The tasks we address in this project are: (1)
Designing standard DB schemas for emergency
management information, (2) Developing a sys-
tem that assists with creating emergency manage-
ment information databases, and (3) Environmen-
tal improvement for the usage of emergency man-
agement.

In the future, we plan on establishing the
database schemas commonly applicable for vari-
ous local governments, and we progress with the
development of the system that assists with cre-
ating databases with emergency management in-
formation using natural language processing tech-
nologies. After the development, we include the
developed system into WebEOC, a standard emer-
gency management information system, and con-
duct demonstration experiments with local gov-
ernments to analyze technical and systematic is-
sues for deploying the system into the field.
