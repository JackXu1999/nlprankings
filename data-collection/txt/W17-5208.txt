1 Abstract of talk 

Mining arguments from natural language texts, 

parsing argumentative structures, and assessing ar-

gument quality are among the recent challenges 

tackled in computational argumentation. While ad-

vanced deep learning models provide state-of-the-

art performance in many of these tasks, much at-

tention is also paid to the underlying fundamental 

questions. How are arguments expressed in natural 

language across genres and domains? What is the 

essence of an argument's claim? Can we reliably 

annotate convincingness of an argument? How can 

we approach logic and common-sense reasoning 

in argumentation? This talk highlights some recent 

advances in computational argumentation and 

shows why researchers must be both "surfers" and 

"scuba divers".
