Abstract

In distributional semantics studies, there
is a growing attention in compositionally
determining the distributional meaning of
word sequences. Yet, compositional dis-
tributional models depend on a large set
of parameters that have not been explored.
In this paper we propose a novel approach
to estimate parameters for a class of com-
positional distributional models: the addi-
tive models. Our approach leverages on
two main ideas. Firstly, a novel idea for
extracting compositional distributional se-
mantics examples. Secondly, an estima-
tion method based on regression models
for multiple dependent variables. Experi-
ments demonstrate that our approach out-
performs existing methods for determin-
ing a good model for compositional dis-
tributional semantics.

Introduction

Lexical distributional semantics has been largely
used to model word meaning in many ﬁelds as
computational linguistics (McCarthy and Carroll,
2003; Manning et al., 2008), linguistics (Harris,
1964), corpus linguistics (Firth, 1957), and cogni-
tive research (Miller and Charles, 1991). The fun-
damental hypothesis is the distributional hypoth-
esis (DH): “similar words share similar contexts”
(Harris, 1964). Recently, this hypothesis has been
operationally deﬁned in many ways in the ﬁelds of

physicology, computational linguistics, and infor-
mation retrieval (Li et al., 2000; Pado and Lapata,
2007; Deerwester et al., 1990).

Given the successful application to words, dis-
tributional semantics has been extended to word
sequences. This has happened in two ways: (1)
via the reformulation of DH for speciﬁc word se-
quences (Lin and Pantel, 2001); and (2) via the
deﬁnition of compositional distributional seman-
tics (CDS) models (Mitchell and Lapata, 2008;
Jones and Mewhort, 2007). These are two differ-
ent ways of addressing the problem.

Lin and Pantel (2001) propose the pattern dis-
tributional hypothesis that extends the distribu-
tional hypothesis for speciﬁc patterns, i.e. word
sequences representing partial verb phrases. Dis-
tributional meaning for these patterns is derived
directly by looking to their occurrences in a cor-
pus. Due to data sparsity, patterns of different
length appear with very different frequencies in
the corpus, affecting their statistics detrimentally.
On the other hand, compositional distributional
semantics (CDS) propose to obtain distributional
meaning for sequences by composing the vectors
of the words in the sequences (Mitchell and Lap-
ata, 2008; Jones and Mewhort, 2007). This ap-
proach is fairly interesting as the distributional
meaning of sequences of different length is ob-
tained by composing distributional vectors of sin-
gle words. Yet, many of these approaches have a
large number of parameters that cannot be easily
estimated.

In this paper we propose a novel approach to es-

1264

timate parameters for additive compositional dis-
tributional semantics models. Our approach lever-
ages on two main ideas. Firstly, a novel way for
extracting compositional distributional semantics
examples and counter-examples. Secondly, an es-
timation model that exploits these examples and
determines an equation system that represents a
regression problem with multiple dependent vari-
ables. We propose a method to estimate a solu-
tion of this equation system based on the Moore-
Penrose pseudo-inverse matrices (Penrose, 1955).
The rest of the paper is organised as follows:
Firstly, we shortly review existing compositional
distributional semantics (CDS) models (Sec. 2).
Then we describe our model for estimating CDS
models parameters (Sec. 3).
In succession, we
introduce a way to extract compositional dis-
tributional semantics examples from dictionaries
(Sec. 4). Then, we discuss the experimental set up
and the results of our linear CDS model with es-
timated parameters with respect to existing CDS
models (Sec. 5).

2 Models for compositional

distributional semantics (CDS)

A CDS model is a function (cid:12) that computes the
distributional vector of a sequence of words s by
combining the distributional vectors of its com-
ponent words w1 . . . wn. Let (cid:12)(s) be the distribu-
tional vector describing s and ~wi the distributional
vectors describing its component word wi. Then,
the CDS model can be written as:

(cid:12)(s) = (cid:12)(w1 . . . wn) = ~w1 (cid:12) . . . (cid:12) ~wn

(1)

This generic model has been fairly studied and
many different functions have been proposed and
tested.

Mitchell and Lapata (2008) propose the fol-
lowing general CDS model for 2-word sequences
s = xy:

(cid:12)(s) = (cid:12)(xy) = f (~x, ~y, R, K)

(2)

where ~x and ~y are respectively the distributional
vectors of x and y, R is the particular syntactic
and/or semantic relation connecting x and y, and,
K represents the amount of background knowl-
edge that the vector composition process takes

into account. Two specialisations of the gen-
eral CDS model are proposed: the basic additive
model and the basic multiplicative model.

The basic additive model (BAM) is written as:

(cid:12)(s) = α~x + β~y

(3)

where α and β are two scalar parameters. The
simplistic parametrisation is α = β = 1. For
example, given the vectors ~x and ~y of Table 1,
(cid:12)BAM (s) =< 50, 3, 5, 13, 28 >.
ten as:

The basic multiplicative model (BMM) is writ-

si = xiyi

(4)

where si, xi, and yi are the i-th dimensions of
the vectors (cid:12)(s), ~x, and ~y, respectively. For
the example of Table 1, (cid:12)BM M (s) =< 621, 0,
6, 40, 96 >.
Erk and Pad´o (2008) look at the problem in a
different way. Let the general distributional mean-
ing of the word w be ~w. Their model computes a
different vector ~ws that represents the speciﬁc dis-
tributional meaning of w with respect to s, i.e.:

~ws = (cid:11)(w, s)

(5)

In general, this operator gives different vectors for
each word wi in the sequence s, i.e. (cid:11)(wi, s) 6=
(cid:11)(wj, s) if i 6= j. It also gives different vectors
for a word wi appearing in different sequences sk
and sl, i.e. (cid:11)(wi, sk) 6= (cid:11)(wi, sl) if k 6= l.
The model of Erk and Pad´o (2008) was de-
signed to disambiguate the distributional mean-
ing of a word w in the context of the sequence
s. However, substituting the word w with the se-
mantic head h of s, allows to compute the distri-
butional meaning of sequence s as shaped by the

1265

word that is governing the sequence (c.f. Pollard
and Sag (1994)). For example, the distributional
meaning of the word sequence eats mice is gov-
erned by the verb eats. Following this model, the
distributional vector (cid:12)(s) can be written as:

3 Estimating Additive Compositional

Semantics Models from Data

The generic additive model sums the vectors ~x
and ~y in a new vector ~z:

(cid:12)(s) ≈ (cid:11)(h, s)

(6)

(cid:12)(s) = ~z = A~x + B~y

(10)

The function (cid:11)(h, s) explicitly uses the re-
lation R and the knowledge K of the general
equation 2, being based on the notion of selec-
tional preferences. We exploit the model for se-
quences of two words s=xy where the two words
are related with an oriented syntactic relation r
(e.g. r=adj modiﬁer). For making the syntac-
tic relation explicit, we indicate the sequence as:
s = x r←− y.
Given a word w, the model has to keep track
of its selectional preferences. Consequently, each
word w is represented with a triple:

( ~w, Rw, R−1
w )

(7)

where ~w is the distributional vector of the word w,
Rw is the set of the vectors representing the direct
selectional preferences of the word w, and R−1
w is
the set of the vectors representing the indirect se-
lectional preferences of the word w. Given a set of
syntactic relations R, the set Rw and R−1
w contain
respectively a selectional preference vector Rw(r)
and Rw(r)−1 for each r ∈ R. Selectional prefer-
ences are computed as in Erk (2007). If x is the
semantic head of sequence s, then the model can
be written as:

(cid:12)(s) = (cid:11)(x, x r←− y) = ~x (cid:12) Ry(r)

Otherwise, if y is the semantic head:

(cid:12)(s) = (cid:11)(y, x r←− y) = ~y (cid:12) R−1

x (r)

(8)

(9)

(cid:12) is in both cases realised using BAM or BMM.
We will call these models: basic additive model
with selectional preferences (BAM-SP) and basic
multiplicative model with selectional preferences
(BMM-SP).

Both Mitchell and Lapata (2008) and Erk and
Pad´o (2008) experimented with few empirically
estimated parameters. Thus, the general additive
CDS model has not been adequately explored.

where A and B are two square matrices captur-
ing the relation R and the background knowledge
K of equation 2. Writing matrices A and B by
hand is impossible because of their large size. Es-
timating these matrices is neither a simple classi-
ﬁcation learning problem nor a simple regression
problem. It is a regression problem with multiple
dependent variables. In this section, we propose
our model to solve this regression problem using
a set of training examples E.

The set of training examples E contains triples
of vectors (~z, ~x, ~y). ~x and ~y are the two distribu-
tional vectors of the words x and y. ~z is the ex-
pected distributional vector of the composition of
~x and ~y. Note that for an ideal perfectly perform-
ing CDS model we can write ~z = (cid:12)(xy). How-
ever, in general the expected vector ~z is not guar-
anteed to be equal to the composed one (cid:12)(xy).
Figure 1 reports an example of these triples, i.e.,
interaction), with the re-
t = (
lated distributional vectors. The construction of
E is discussed in section 4.

In the rest of the section, we describe how the
regression problem with multiple dependent vari-
ables can be solved with a linear equation system
and we give a possible solution of this equation
system. In the experimental section, we refer to
our model as the estimated additive model (EAM).

3.1 Setting the linear equation system
The matrices A and B of equation 10 can be
joined in a single matrix:

For the triple t of table 1, equation 11 is:

Given set E that contains n triples (~z, ~x, ~y), we
can write the following system of equations:

The vectors derived from the triples can be seen as

Equation 14 is the prototype of our ﬁnal equa-

system is then the following:

This equation system represents the constraints
that matrices A and B have to satisfy in order to
be a possible linear CDS model that can at least
describe seen examples. We will hereafter call

Λ = (cid:0)A B(cid:1) and Q = (cid:0)X Y(cid:1). The system

As Q is a rectangular and singular matrix, it is
not invertible and the system in equation 16 has

no solutions.
It is possible to use the principle
of Least Square Estimation for computing an ap-
proximation solution. The idea is to compute the

solutionbΛ that minimises the residual norm, i.e.:

ΛT kQΛT − Zk2

(18)

One solution for this problem is the Moore-
Penrose pseudoinverse Q+ (Penrose, 1955) that
gives the following ﬁnal equation:

bΛT = arg min

(19)

bΛT = Q+Z

In the next section, we discuss how the Moore-
Penrose pseudoinverse is obtained using singular
value decomposition (SVD).

3.2 Computing the pseudo-inverse matrix
The pseudo-inverse matrix can provide an approx-
imated solution even if the equation system has no
solutions. We here compute the Moore-Penrose
pseudoinverse using singular value decomposi-
tion (SVD) that is widely used in computational
linguistics and information retrieval for reducing
spaces (Deerwester et al., 1990).

Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse (Penrose, 1955)
is computed in the following way. Let the original
matrix Q have n rows and m columns and be of
rank r. The SVD decomposition of the original
matrix Q is Q = U ΣV T where Σ is a square di-
agonal matrix of dimension r. Then, the pseudo-
inverse matrix that minimises the equation 18 is:

Q+ = V Σ+U T

(20)
where the diagonal matrix Σ+ is the r × r trans-
posed matrix of Σ having as diagonal elements the
reciprocals of the singular values 1

Using SVD to compute the pseudo-inverse ma-
trix allows for different approximations (Fallucchi
and Zanzotto, 2009). The algorithm for comput-
ing the singular value decomposition is iterative
(Golub and Kahan, 1965). Firstly derived dimen-
sions have higher singular value. Then, dimension
k is more informative than dimension k0 > k. We
can consider different values for k to obtain differ-
ent SVD for the approximations Q+

4 Building positive and negative

examples

As explained in the previous section, estimating
CDS models, needs a set of triples E, similar to
triple t of table 1. This set E should contain pos-
itive examples in the form of triples (~zi, ~xi, ~yi).
Examples are positive in the sense that ~zi =
(cid:12)(xy) for an ideal CDS. There are no available
sets to contain such triples, with the exception of
the set used in Mitchell and Lapata (2008) which
is designed only for testing purposes. It contains
similar and dissimilar pairs of sequences (s1,s2)
where each sequence is a verb-noun pair (vi,ni).
From the positive part of this set, we can only de-
rive quadruples where (cid:12)(v1n1) ≈ (cid:12)(v2n2) but
we cannot derive the ideal resulting vector of the
composition (cid:12)(vini). Sets used to test multi-
word expression (MWE) detection models (e.g.,
(Schone and Jurafsky, 2001; Nicholson and Bald-
win, 2008; Kim and Baldwin, 2008; Cook et
al., 2008; Villavicencio, 2003; Korkontzelos and
Manandhar, 2009)) are again not useful as con-
taining only valid MWE that cannot be used to
determine the set of training triples needed here.
As a result, we need a novel idea to build sets
of triples to train CDS models. We can leverage
on knowledge stored in dictionaries. In the rest of
the section, we describe how we build the positive
example set E and a control negative example set
N E. Elements of the two sets are pairs (t,s) where
t is a target word s is a sequence of words. t is the
word that represent the distributional meaning of
s in the case of E. Contrarily, t is totally unrelated
to the distributional meaning of s in N E. The sets
E and N E can be used both for training and for
testing. In the testing phase, we can use these sets
to determine whether a CDS model is good or not
and to compare different CDS models.

4.1 Building Positive Examples using

Dictionaries

Dictionaries as natural repositories of equivalent
expressions can be used to extract positive exam-
ples for training and testing CDS models. The
basic idea is the following: dictionary entries are

declarations of equivalence. Words or, occasion-
ally, multi-word expressions t are declared to be
semantically similar to their deﬁnition sequences
s. This happens at least for some sense of the
deﬁned words. We can then observe that t ≈ s.
For example, we report some sample deﬁnitions
of contact and high life:

target word (t)
contact
high life

deﬁnition sequence (s)
close interaction
excessive spending

In the ﬁrst case, a word, i.e. contact, is semanti-
cally similar to a two-word expression, i.e. close
interaction. In the second case, two two-word ex-
pressions are semantically similar.

Then, the pairs (t, s) can be used to model
positive cases of compositional distributional se-
mantics as we know that the word sequence s
is compositional and it describes the meaning of
the word t. The distributional meaning ~t of t is
the expected distributional meaning of s. Conse-
quently, the vector ~t is what the CDS model (cid:12)(s)
should compositionally obtain from the vectors of
the components ~s1 . . . ~sm of s. This way of ex-
tracting similar expressions has some interesting
properties:

First property Deﬁned words t are generally
single words. Thus, we can extract stable and
meaningful distributional vectors for these words
and then compare them to the distributional vec-
tors composed by CDS model. This is an impor-
tant property as we cannot compare directly the
distributional vector ~s of a word sequence s and
the vector (cid:12)(s) obtained by composing its com-
ponents. As the word sequence s grows in length,
the reliability of the vector ~s decreases since the
sequence s becomes rarer.

Second property Deﬁnitions s have a large va-
riety of different syntactic structures ranging from
simple structures as Adjective-Noun to more com-
plex ones. This gives the possibility to train and
test CDS models that take into account syntax.
Table 2 represents the distribution of the more
frequent syntactic structures in the deﬁnitions of
WordNet1 (Miller, 1995).

4.2 Extracting Negative Examples from

Word Etymology

In order to devise complete training and testing
sets for CDS models, we need to ﬁnd a sensible
way to extract negative examples. An option is to
randomly generate totally unrelated triples for the
negative examples set, N E. In this case, due to
data sparseness N E would mostly contain triples
(~z, ~x, ~y) where it is expected that ~z 6= (cid:12)(xy). Yet,
these can be too generic and too loosely related to
be interesting cases.

Instead we attempt to extract sets of negative
pairs (t,s) comparable with the one used for build-
ing the training set E. The target word t should
be a single word and s should be a sequence of
words. The latter should be a sequence of words
related by construction to t but the meaning of t
and s should be unrelated.

The idea is the following: many words are et-
ymologically derived from very old or ancient
words. These words represent a collocation which
is in general not related to the meaning of the
target word. For example, the word philosophy
derives from two Greek words philos (beloved)
and sophia (wisdom). However, the use of the
word philosophy in not related to the collocation
beloved wisdom. This word has lost its origi-
nal compositional meaning. The following table
shows some more etymologically complex words
along with the compositionally unrelated colloca-
tions:

target word
municipal
octopus

compositionally unrelated seq.
receive duty
eight foot

As the examples suggest, we are able to build a
set N E with features similar to the features of
N. In particular, each target word is paired with
a related word sequence derived from its etymol-
ogy. These etymologically complex words are un-
related to the corresponding compositional collo-
cations. To derive a set N E with the above char-
acteristics we can use dictionaries containing ety-
mological information as Wiktionary2.

5 Experimental evaluation
In the previous sections, we presented the esti-
mated additive model (EAM): our approach to es-
timate the parameters of a generic additive model
for CDS. In this section, we experiment with this
model to determine whether it performs better
than existing models:
the basic additive model
(BAM), the basic multiplicative model (BMM),
the basic additive model with selectional pref-
erences (BAM-SP), and the basic multiplicative
model with selectional preferences (BMM-SP)
(c.f. Sec. 2). In succession, we explore whether
our estimated additive model (EAM) is better than
any possible BAM obtained with parameter ad-
justment. In the rest of the section, we ﬁrstly give
the experimental setup and then we discuss the ex-
periments and the results.

5.1 Experimental setup
Our experiments aim to compare compositional
distributional semantic (CDS) models (cid:12) with re-
spect to their ability of detecting statistically sig-
niﬁcant difference between sets E and N E.
In
particular, the average similarity sim(~z,(cid:12)(xy))
for (~z, ~x, ~y) ∈ E should be signiﬁcantly different
from sim(~z,(cid:12)(xy)) for (~z, ~x, ~y) ∈ N E. In this
section, we describe the chosen similarity mea-
sure sim, statistical signiﬁcance testing and con-
struction details for the training and testing set.

Cosine similarity was used to compare the con-
text vector ~z representing the target word z with
the composed vector (cid:12)(xy) representing the con-
text vector of sequence x y. Cosine similarity be-

2http://www.wiktionary.org

1269

tween two vectors ~x and ~y of the same dimension
is deﬁned as:

sim(~x, ~y) =

~x · ~y
k~xk k~yk

(22)

where · is the dot product and k~ak is the magni-
tude of vector ~a computed the Euclidean norm.
To evaluate whether a CDS model distinguishes
positive examples E from negative examples
N E, we test if the distribution of similarities
sim(~z,(cid:12)(xy)) for (~z, ~x, ~y) ∈ E is statistically
different from the distribution of the same simi-
larities for (~z, ~x, ~y) ∈ N E. For this purpose, we
used Student’s t-test for two independent samples
of different sizes. t-test assumes that the two dis-
tributions are Gaussian and determines the prob-
ability that they are similar, i.e., derive from the
same underlying distribution. Low probabilities
indicate that the distributions are highly dissimilar
and that the corresponding CDS model performs
well, as it detects statistically different similarities
for the positive set E and the negative set N E.

Based on the null hypothesis that the means of
the two samples are equal, µ1 = µ2, Student’s t-
test takes into account the sizes N, means M and
variances s2 of the two samples to compute the
following value:

t = (M1 − M2) −1s 2(s2

1 + s2
2)
df ∗ Nh

(23)

1 + N−1

where df = N1 + N2 − 2 stands for the degrees
of freedom and Nh = 2(N−1
2 )−1 is the
harmonic mean of the sample sizes. Given the
statistic t and the degrees of freedom df, we can
compute the corresponding p-value, i.e., the prob-
ability that the two samples derive from the same
distribution. The null hypothesis can be rejected if
the p-value is below the chosen threshold of statis-
tical signiﬁcance (usually 0.1, 0.05 or 0.01), oth-
erwise it is accepted.
In our case, rejecting the
null hypothesis means that the similarity values of
instances of E are signiﬁcantly different from in-
stances of N E, and that the corresponding CDS
model perform well. p-value can be used as a per-
formance ranking function for CDS models.
We constructed two sets of instances:

(a) a
set containing Adjective-Noun or Noun-Noun se-

BAM
BMM
BAM-SP
BMM-SP
EAM (k=20)

NN set
0.05690
0.20262

quences (NN set); and (b) a set containing Verb-
Noun sequences (VN set). Capturing different
syntactic relations, these two sets can support that
our results are independent from the syntactic re-
lation between the words of each sequence. For
each set, we used WordNet for extracting positive
examples E and Wiktionary for extracting nega-
tive examples N E as described in Section 4. We
obtained the following sets: (a) NN consists of
1065 word-sequence pairs from WordNet deﬁni-
tions and 377 pairs extracted from Wiktionary;
and (b) VN consists of 161 word-sequence pairs
from WordNet deﬁnitions and 111 pairs extracted
from Wiktionary. We have then divided these two
sets in two parts of 50% each, for training and
testing. Instances of the training part of E have
been used to estimate matrices A and B for model
EAM, while the testing parts have been used for
testing all models. Frequency vectors for all sin-
gle words occurring in the above pairs were con-
structed from the British National Corpus using
sentences as contextual windows and words as
features. The resulting space has 689191 features.

5.2 Results and Analysis
The ﬁrst set of experiments compares EAM with
other existing CDS models: BAM, BMM, BAM-
SP, and BMM-SP. Results are shown in Table 3.
The table reports the p-value, i.e., the probability
of confusing the positive set E and the negative
set N E for all models. Lower probabilities char-
acterise better models. Probabilities below 0.05
indicate that the model detects a statistically sig-
niﬁcant difference between sets E and N E. EAM
has been computed with k = 20 different dimen-
sions for the pseudo-inverse matrix. The two basic
additive models (BAM and BAM-SP) have been
computed for α = β = 1.

The ﬁrst observation is that EAM models sig-
niﬁcantly separate positive from negative exam-
ples for both sets. This is not the case for any
of the other models. Only, the selectional prefer-
ences based models in two cases have this prop-
erty, but this cannot be generalised: BAM-SP on
the VN set and BMM-SP on the NN set. In gen-
eral, these models do not offer the possibility of
separating positive from negative examples.

In the second set of experiments, we attempt to
investigate whether simple parameter adjustment
of BAM can perform better than EAM. Results are
shown in ﬁgure 1. Plots show the basic additive
model (BAM) with different values for parameter
α (where β = 1 − α) and EAM computed for dif-
ferent approximations of the SVD pseudo-inverse
matrix (i.e., with different k). The x-axis of the
plots represents parameter α and the y-axis repre-
sents the probability of confusing the positive set
E and the negative set N E. The representation fo-
cuses on the performance of BAM with respect to
different α values. The performance of EAM for
different k values is represented with horizontal
lines. Probabilities of different models are directly
comparable. Line SS represents the threshold of
statistical signiﬁcance; the value below which the
detected difference between the E and N E sets
becomes statistically signiﬁcant.

Experimental results show some interesting
facts: While BAM for α > 0 perform better than
EAM computed with k = 1 in the NN set, they
do not perform better in the VN set. EAM with
k = 1 has 1 degree of freedom corresponding to

1 parameter, the same as BAM. The parameter of
EAM is tuned on the training set, in contrast to
α, the parameter of BAM. Increasing the number
of considered dimensions, k of EAM, estimated
models outperform BAM for all values of param-
eter α. Moreover, EAM detect a statistically sig-
niﬁcant difference between the E and the N E sets
for k ≥ 10 and k = 20 for the NN set and the
VN set set, respectively. Simple parametrisation
of a BAM does not outperform the proposed esti-
mated additive model.

6 Conclusions
In this paper, we presented an innovative method
to estimate linear compositional distributional se-
mantics models. The core of our approach con-
sists on two parts: (1) providing a method to es-
timate the regression problem with multiple de-
pendent variables and (2) providing a training set
derived from dictionary deﬁnitions. Experiments
showed that our model is highly competitive with
respect to state-of-the-art models for composi-
tional distributional semantics.
