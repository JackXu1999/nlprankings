Abstract

Mental health research can benefit increas-
ingly fruitfully from computational linguis-
tics methods, given the abundant availability
of language data in the internet and advances
of computational tools. This interdisciplinary
project will collect and analyse social me-
dia data of individuals diagnosed with bipolar
disorder with regard to their recovery experi-
ences. Personal recovery - living a satisfying
and contributing life along symptoms of se-
vere mental health issues - so far has only been
investigated qualitatively with structured in-
terviews and quantitatively with standardised
questionnaires with mainly English-speaking
participants in Western countries. Comple-
mentary to this evidence, computational lin-
guistic methods allow us to analyse first-
person accounts shared online in large quan-
tities, representing unstructured settings and a
more heterogeneous, multilingual population,
to draw a more complete picture of the aspects
and mechanisms of personal recovery in bipo-
lar disorder.

1 Introduction and background

Recent years have witnessed increased perfor-
mance in many computational linguistics tasks
such as syntactic and semantic parsing (Collobert
et al., 2011; Zeman et al., 2018), emotion classifi-
cation (Becker et al., 2017), and sentiment analy-
sis (Barnes et al., 2017, 2018a,b), especially con-
cerning the applicability of such tools to noisy on-
line data. Moreover, the field has made substantial
progress in developing multilingual models and
extending semantic annotation resources to lan-
guages beyond English (Pianta et al., 2002; Boas,
2009; Piao et al., 2016; Boot et al., 2017).

Concurrently, it has been argued for mental
health research that it would constitute a ‘valu-
able critical step’ (Stuart et al., 2017) to analyse

first-hand accounts by individuals with lived ex-
perience of severe mental health issues in blog
posts, tweets, and discussion forums. Several se-
vere mental health difficulties, e.g., bipolar dis-
order (BD) and schizophrenia are considered as
chronic and clinical recovery, defined as being re-
lapse and symptom free for a sustained period of
time (Chengappa et al., 2005), is considered dif-
ficult to achieve (Forster, 2014; Heylighen et al.,
2014; U.S. Department of Health and Human Ser-
vices: The National Institute of Mental Health,
2016). Moreover, clinically recovered individ-
uals often do not regain full social and educa-
tional/vocational functioning (Strakowski et al.,
1998; Tohen et al., 2003). Therefore, research
originating from initiatives by people with lived
experience of mental health issues has been advo-
cating emphasis on the individual’s goals in recov-
ery (Deegan, 1988; Anthony, 1993). This move-
ment gave rise to the concept of personal recov-
ery (Andresen et al., 2011; van Os et al., 2019),
loosely defined as a ‘way of living a satisfying,
hopeful, and contributing life even with limitations
caused by illness’ (Anthony, 1993). The aspects
of personal recovery have been conceptualised in
various ways (Young and Ensing, 1999; Mansell
et al., 2010; Morrison et al., 2016). According to
the frequently used CHIME model (Leamy et al.,
2011), its main components are Connectedness,
Hope and optimism, Identity, Meaning and pur-
pose, and Empowerment.

Here, we focus on BD, which is characterised
by recurring episodes of depressed and elated
(hypomanic or manic) mood (Jones et al., 2010;
Forster, 2014). Bipolar spectrum disorders were
estimated to affect approximately 2% of the UK
population (Heylighen et al., 2014) with rates
ranging from 0.1%-4.4% across 11 other Euro-
pean, American and Asian countries (Merikangas
et al., 2011). Moreover, BD is associated with a



18

high risk of suicide (Novick et al., 2010), making
its prevention and treatment important tasks for
society. BD-specific personal recovery research is
motivated by mainly two facts: First, the pole of
positive/elevated mood and ongoing mood insta-
bility constitute core features of BD and pose spe-
cial challenges compared to other mental health
issues, such as unipolar depression (Jones et al.,
2010). Second, unlike for some other severe men-
tal health difficulties, return to normal functioning
is achievable given appropriate treatment (Coryell
et al., 1998; Tohen et al., 2003; Goldberg and Har-
row, 2004).

A substantial body of qualitative and quan-
titative research has shown the importance of
personal recovery for individuals diagnosed with
BD (Mansell et al., 2010; Jones et al., 2010, 2012,
2015; Morrison et al., 2016). Qualitative evidence
mainly comes from (semi-)structured interviews
and focus groups and has been criticised for small
numbers of participants (Stuart et al., 2017), lack-
ing complementary quantitative evidence from
larger samples (Slade et al., 2012). Some quanti-
tative evidence stems from the standardised bipo-
lar recovery questionnaire (Jones et al., 2012) and
a randomised control trial for recovery-focused
cognitive-behavioural therapy (Jones et al., 2015).
Critically, previous research has taken place only
in structured settings.

What is more, the recovery concept emerged
from research primarily conducted in English-
speaking countries, mainly involving researchers
and participants of Western ethnicity. This might
have led to a lack of non-Western notions of well-
being in the concept, such as those found in in-
digenous peoples (Slade et al., 2012), limiting its
the applicability to a general population. Indeed,
the variation in BD prevalence rates from 0.1% in
India to 4.4% in the US is striking. It has been
shown that culture is an important factor in the di-
agnosis of BD (Mackin et al., 2006), as well as
on the causes attributed to mental health difficul-
ties in general and treatments considered appropri-
ate (Sanches and Jorge, 2004; Chentsova-Dutton
et al., 2014). While approaches to mental health
classification from texts have long ignored the cul-
tural dimension (Loveys et al., 2018), first studies
show that online language of individuals affected
by depression or related mental health difficulties
differs significantly across cultures (De Choud-
hury et al., 2017; Loveys et al., 2018).

Hence, it seems timely to take into account the
wealth of accounts of mental health difficulties
and recovery stories from individuals of diverse
ethnic and cultural backgrounds that are available
in a multitude of languages on the internet. Corpus
and computational linguistic methods are explic-
itly designed for processing large amounts of lin-
guistic data (Jurafsky and Martin, 2009; O’Keeffe
and McCarthy, 2010; McEnery and Hardie, 2011;
Rayson, 2015), and as discussed above, recent ad-
vances have made it feasible to apply them to
noisy user-generated texts from diverse domains,
including mental health (Resnik et al., 2014; Ben-
ton et al., 2017b). Computer-aided analysis of
public social media data enables us to address sev-
eral shortcomings in the scientific underpinning of
personal recovery in BD by overcoming the small
sample sizes of lab-collected data and including
accounts from a more heterogeneous population.

In sum, our research questions are as follows:
(1) How is personal recovery discussed online by
individuals meeting criteria for BD? (2) What new
insights do we get about personal recovery and
factors that facilitate or hinder it? We will in-
vestigate these questions in two parts, looking at
English-language data by westerners and at multi-
lingual data by individuals of diverse ethnicities.

2 Data

Previous work in computational linguistics and
clinical psychology has tended to focus on the
detection of mental health issues as classification
tasks (Arseniev-Koehler et al., 2018). Datasets
have been collected for various conditions includ-
ing BD using publicly available social-media data
from Twitter (Coppersmith et al., 2015) and Red-
dit (Sekulić et al., 2018; Cohan et al., 2018). Un-
fortunately, the Twitter dataset is unavailable for
further research.1 In both Reddit datasets, mental
health-related content was deliberately removed.
This allows the training of classifiers that try to
predict the mental health of authors from excerpts
that do not explicitly address mental health, yet
it renders the data useless for analyses on how
mental health is talked about online. Due to this
lack of appropriate existing publicly accessible
datasets, we will create such resources and make
them available to subsequent researchers.

We plan to collect data relevant for BD in gen-

smith et al. (2015).

eral as well as for personal recovery in BD from
three sources varying in their available amount
versus depth of the accounts we expect to find:
1) Twitter, 2) Reddit (focusing on mental health-
related content unlike previous work), 3) blogs au-
thored by affected individuals. Twitter and Reddit
users with a BD diagnosis will be identified au-
tomatically via self-reported diagnosis statements,
such as ‘I was diagnosed with BD-I last week’.
To do so, we will extend on the diagnosis pat-
terns and terms for BD provided by Cohan et al.
(2018)2. Implicit consent is assumed from users
on these platforms to use their public tweets and
posts.3 Relevant blogs will be manually identified,
and their authors will be contacted to obtain in-
formed consent for using their texts.

Since language and culture are important fac-
tors in our research questions, we need informa-
tion on the language of the texts and the coun-
try of residence of their authors3, which is not
provided in a structured format in the three data
sources. For language identification, Twitter em-
ploys an automatic tool (Trampus, 2015), which
can be used to filter tweets according to 60 lan-
guage codes, and there are free, fairly accurate
tools such as the Google Compact Language De-
tector4, which can be applied to Reddit and blog
posts. The location of Twitter users can be auto-
matically inferred from their tweets (Cheng et al.,
2010) or the (albeit noisy) location field in their
user profiles (Hecht et al., 2011). Only one attempt
to classify the location of Reddit users has been
published so far (Harrigian, 2018) showing mea-
gre results, indicating that the development of ro-
bust location classification approaches on this plat-
form would constitute a valuable contribution.

Some companies collect mental health-related
online data and make them available to researchers
subject to approval of their internal review boards,
e.g., OurDataHelps5 by Qntfy or the peer-support
forum provider 7 Cups6. Unlike ‘raw’ social me-
dia data, these datasets have richer user-provided
metadata and explicit consent for research usage.
On the other hand, less data is available, the pro-
cess to obtain access might be tedious within the
short timeline of a PhD project and it might be im-

possible to share the used portions of the data with
other researchers. Therefore, we will follow up the
possibilities of obtaining access to these datasets,
but in parallel also collect our own datasets to
avoid dependence on external data providers.

3 Methodology and Resources

As explained in the introduction, the overarching
aim of this project is to investigate in how far
information conveyed in social media posts can
complement more traditional research methods in
clinical psychology to get insights into the recov-
ery experience of individuals with a BD diagnosis.
Therefore, we will first conduct a systematic liter-
ature review of qualitative evidence to establish a
solid base of what is already known about personal
recovery experiences in BD for the subsequent so-
cial media studies.

Our research questions, which regard the expe-
riences of different populations, lend themselves
to several subprojects. First, we will collect and
analyse English-language data from westerners.
Then, we will address ethnically diverse English-
speaking populations and finally multilingual ac-
counts. This has the advantage that we can build
data processing and methodological workflows
along an increase in complexity of the data col-
lection and analysis throughout the project.

In each project phase, we will employ a mixed-
methods approach to combine the advantages of
quantitative and qualitative methods (Tashakkori
and Teddlie, 1998; Creswell and Plano Clark,
2011), which is established in mental health re-
search (Steckler et al., 1992; Baum, 1995; Sale
et al., 2002; Lund, 2012) and specifically recom-
mended to investigate personal recovery (Leon-
hardt et al., 2017). Quantitative methods are suit-
able to study observable behaviour such as lan-
guage and yield more generalisable results by
taking into account large samples. However,
they fall short of capturing the subjective, id-
iosyncratic meaning of socially constructed real-
ity, which is important when studying individuals’
recovery experience (Russell and Browne, 2005;
Mansell et al., 2010; Morrison et al., 2016; Crowe
and Inder, 2018). Therefore, we will apply an
explanatory sequential research design (Creswell
and Plano Clark, 2011), starting with statistical
analysis of the full dataset followed by a manual
investigation of fewer examples, similar to ‘distant
reading’ (Moretti, 2013) in digital humanities.

Since previous research mainly employed
(semi-)structured interviews and we do not expect
to necessarily find the same aspects emphasised in
unstructured settings, even less so when looking at
a more diverse and non-English speaking popula-
tion, we will not derive hypotheses from existing
recovery models for testing on the online data. In-
stead, we will start off with exploratory quantita-
tive research using comparative analysis tools such
as Wmatrix (Rayson, 2008) to uncover important
linguistic features, e.g., on keywords and key con-
cepts that occur with unexpected frequency in our
collected datasets relative to reference corpora.
The underlying assumption is that keywords and
key concepts are indicative of certain aspects of
personal recovery, such as those specified in the
CHIME model (Leamy et al., 2011), other pre-
vious research (Mansell et al., 2010; Morrison
et al., 2016; Crowe and Inder, 2018), or novel
ones. Comparing online sources with transcripts
of structured interviews or subcorpora originating
from different cultural backgrounds might uncover
aspects that were not prominently represented in
the accounts studied in prior research.

A specific challenge will be to narrow down
the data to parts relevant for personal recovery,
since there is no control over the discussed top-
ics compared to structured interviews. To inves-
tigate how individuals discuss personal recovery
online and what (potentially unrecorded) aspects
they associate with it, without a priori narrow-
ing down the search-space to specific known key-
words seems like a chicken-and-egg problem. We
propose to address this challenge by an iterative
approach similar to the one taken in a corpus lin-
guistic study of cancer metaphors (Semino et al.,
2017). Drawing on results from previous qualita-
tive research (Leamy et al., 2011; Morrison et al.,
2016), we will compile an initial dictionary of
recovery-related terms. Next, we will examine a
small portion of the dataset manually, which will
be partly randomly sampled and partly selected to
contain recovery-related terms. Based on this, we
will be able to expand the dictionary and addi-
tionally automatically annotate semantic concepts
of the identified relevant text passages using a se-
mantic tagging approach such as the UCREL Se-
mantic Analysis System (USAS) (Rayson et al.,
2004). Crucially for the multilingual aspect of
the project, USAS can tag semantic categories in
eight languages (Piao et al., 2016). Then, se-

mantic tagging will be applied to the full corpus
to retrieve all text passages mentioning relevant
concepts. Furthermore, distributional semantics
methods (Lenci, 2008; Turney and Pantel, 2010)
can be used to find terms that frequently co-occur
with words from our keyword dictionary. Occur-
rences of the identified keywords or concepts can
be quantified in the full corpus to identify the im-
portance of the related personal recovery aspects.

Linguistic Inquiry and Word
Count (LIWC) (Pennebaker et al., 2015) is a
frequently used tool in social-science text analysis
to analyse emotional and cognitive components
of texts and derive features for classification
models (Cohan et al., 2018; Sekulić et al., 2018;
Tackman et al., 2018; Wang and Jurgens, 2018).
LIWC counts target words organised in a man-
ually constructed hierarchical dictionary without
contextual disambiguation in the texts under
analysis and has been psychometrically validated
and developed for English exclusively. While
translations for several languages exist, e.g.,
Dutch (Boot et al., 2017), and it is questionable
to what extent LIWC concepts can be transferred
to other languages and cultures by mere trans-
lation. We therefore aim to apply and develop
methods that require less manual labour and are
applicable to many languages and cultures. One
option constitute unsupervised methods, such
as topic modelling, which has been applied to
explore cultural differences in mental-health
related online data already (De Choudhury et al.,
2017; Loveys et al., 2018). The Differential
Language Analysis ToolKit (DLATK) (Schwartz
et al., 2017) facilitates social-scientific language
analyses, including tools for preprocessing, such
as emoticon-aware tokenisers, filtering according
to meta data, and analysis, e.g. via robust topic
modelling methods.

Furthermore, emotion and sentiment analysis
constitute useful tools to investigate the emotions
involved in talking about recovery and identify
factors that facilitate or hinder it. There are
many annotated datasets to train supervised clas-
sifiers (Bostan and Klinger, 2018; Barnes et al.,
2017) for these actively researched NLP tasks.
Machine learning methods were found to usu-
ally outperform rule-based approaches based on
look-ups in dictionaries such as LIWC. Again,
most annotated resources are English, but state
of the art approaches based on multilingual em-



21

beddings allow transferring models between lan-
guages (Barnes et al., 2018a).

4 Ethical considerations

Ethical considerations are established as essential
part in planning mental health research and most
research projects undergo approval by an ethics
committee. On the contrary, the computational
linguistics community has started only recently to
consider ethical questions (Hovy and Spruit, 2016;
Hovy et al., 2017). Likely, this is because com-
putational linguistics was traditionally concerned
with publicly available, impersonal texts such as
newspapers or texts published with some tempo-
ral distance, which left a distance between the text
and author. Conversely, recent social media re-
search often deals with highly personal informa-
tion of living individuals, who can be directly af-
fected by the outcomes (Hovy and Spruit, 2016).

Hovy and Spruit (2016) discuss issues that can
arise when constructing datasets from social me-
dia and conducting analyses or developing pre-
dictive models based on these data, which we re-
view here in relation to our project: Demographic
bias in sampling the data can lead to exclusion
of minority groups, resulting in overgeneralisation
of models based on these data. As discussed in
the introduction, personal recovery research suf-
fers from a bias towards English-speaking West-
ern individuals of white ethnicity. By studying
multilingual accounts of ethnically diverse pop-
ulations we explicitly address the demographic
bias of previous research. Topic overexposure is
tricky to address, where certain groups are per-
ceived as abnormal when research repeatedly finds
that their language is different or more difficult
to process. Unlike previous research (Copper-
smith et al., 2015; Cohan et al., 2018; Sekulić
et al., 2018) our goal is not to reveal particularities
in the language of individuals affected by men-
tal health problems. Instead, we will compare ac-
counts of individuals with BD from different set-
tings (structured interviews versus informal online
discourse) and of different backgrounds. While
the latter bears the risk to overexpose certain mi-
nority groups, we will pay special attention to this
in the dissemination of our results.

Lastly, most research, even when conducted
with the best intentions, suffers from the dual-use
problem (Jonas, 1984), in that it can be misused or
have consequences that affect people’s life nega-

tively. For this reason, we refrain from publishing
mental health classification methods, which could
be used, for example, by health insurance compa-
nies for the risk assessment of applicants based on
their social media profiles.

If and how informed consent needs to be ob-
tained for research on social media data is a de-
bated issue (Eysenbach and Till, 2001; Beninger
et al., 2014; Paul and Dredze, 2017), mainly be-
cause it is not straightforward to determine if posts
are made in a public or private context. From a
legal point of view, the privacy policies of Twit-
ter7 and Reddit8, explicitly allow analysis of the
user contents by third party, but it is unclear to
what extent users are aware of this when posting to
these platforms (Ahmed et al., 2017). However, in
practice it is often infeasible to seek retrospective
consent from hundreds or thousands of social me-
dia users. According to current ethical guidelines
for social media research (Benton et al., 2017a;
Williams et al., 2017) and practice in compara-
ble research projects (O’Dea et al., 2015; Ahmed
et al., 2017), it is regarded as acceptable to waive
explicit consent if the anonymity of the users is
preserved. Therefore, we will not ask the account
holders of Twitter and Reddit posts included in our
datasets for their consent.

Benton et al. (2017a) formulate guidelines for
ethical social media health research that pertain es-
pecially to data collection and sharing. In line with
these, we will only share anonymised and para-
phrased excerpts from the texts, as it is often possi-
ble to recover a user name via a web search for the
verbatim text of a post. However, we will make the
original texts available as datasets to subsequent
research under a data usage agreement. Since the
(automatic) annotation of demographic variables
in parts of our dataset constitutes especially sensi-
tive information on minority status in conjunction
with mental health, we will only share these an-
notations with researchers that demonstrate a gen-
uine need for them, i.e. to verify our results or to
investigate certain research questions.

Another important question is in which situa-
tions of encountering content indicative of a risk
of self-harm or harm to others it would be appro-

priate or even required by duty of care for the re-
search team to pass on information to authorities.
Surprisingly, we could only find two mentions of
this issue in social media research (O’Dea et al.,
2015; Young and Garett, 2018). Acknowledging
that suicidal ideation fluctuates (Prinstein et al.,
2008), we accord with the ethical review board’s
requirement in O’Dea et al. (2015) to only analyse
content posted at least three months ago. If the
research team, which includes clinical psycholo-
gists, still perceives users at risk we will make use
of the reporting facilities of Twitter and Reddit.

As a central component we consider the in-
volvement of individuals with lived experience in
our project, an aspect which is missing in the dis-
cussion of ethical social media health research so
far. The proposal has been presented to an advi-
sory board of individuals with a BD diagnosis and
was received positively. The advisory board will
be consulted at several stages of the project to in-
form the research design, analysis, and publica-
tion of results. We believe that board members
can help to address several of the raised ethical
problems, e.g., shaping the research questions to
avoid feeding into existing biases or overexposing
certain groups and highlighting potentially harm-
ful interpretations and uses of our results.

5 Impact and conclusion

The importance of the recovery concept in the
design of mental health services has recently
been prominently reinforced, suggesting recovery-
oriented social enterprises as key component of
the integrated service (van Os et al., 2019). We
think that a recovery approach as leading princi-
ple for national or global health service strategies,
should be informed by voices of individuals as di-
verse as those it is supposed to serve. Therefore,
we expect the proposed investigations of views on
recovery by previously under-researched ethnic,
language, and cultural groups to yield valuable in-
sights on the appropriateness of the recovery ap-
proach for a wider population. The datasets col-
lected in this project can serve as useful resources
for future research. More generally, our social-
media data-driven approach could be applied to in-
vestigate other areas of mental health if it proves
successful in leading to relevant new insights.

Finally, this project is an interdisciplinary en-
deavour, combining clinical psychology, input
from individuals with lived experience of BD, and

computational linguistics. While this comes with
the challenges of cross-disciplinary research, it has
the potential to apply and develop state-of-the-art
NLP methods in a way that is psychologically and
ethically sound as well as informed and approved
by affected people to increase our knowledge of
severe mental illnesses such as BD.
