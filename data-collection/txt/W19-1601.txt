Abstract

As autonomous systems become more com-
monplace, we need a way to easily and nat-
urally communicate to them our goals and col-
laboratively come up with a plan on how to
achieve these goals. To this end, we conducted
a Wizard of Oz study to gather data and inves-
tigate the way operators would collaboratively
make plans via a conversational ‘planning as-
sistant’ for remote autonomous systems. We
present here a corpus of 22 dialogs from expert
operators, which can be used to train such a
system. Data analysis shows that multimodal-
ity is key to successful interaction, measured
both quantitatively and qualitatively via user
feedback.

1 Introduction

Our goal is to create a collaborative multimodal
planning system in the form of a conversational
agent called VERSO using both visual and natu-
ral language interaction, which in our case will be
images of the plan and messages. In this work,
we focus on the domain of Autonomous Underwa-
ter Vehicles (AUVs). Experts in this domain typ-
ically create a plan for vehicles using a visual in-
terface on dedicated hardware on-shore, days be-
fore the mission. This planning process is compli-
cated and requires expert knowledge. We propose
a ‘planning assistant’ that is able to encapsulate
this expert knowledge and make suggestions and
guide the user through the planning process us-
ing natural language multimodal interaction. This,
we hope, will allow for more precise and efficient
plans and reduce operator training time. In ad-
dition, it will allow for anywhere access to plan-
ning for in-situ replanning in fast-moving dynamic
scenarios, such as first responder scenarios or off-
shore for oil and gas.

2 Previous work

Conversational agents are becoming more
widespread, varying from social (Li et al., 2016)
and goal-oriented (Wen et al., 2017) to multi-
modal dialog systems, such as the Visual Dialog
Challenge (Das et al., 2017) where an AI agent
must hold a dialog with a human in natural lan-
guage about a given visual content. However, for
systems with both visual and spatial requirements,
such as situated robot planning (Misra et al.,
2018), developing accurate goal-oriented dialog
systems can be extremely challenging, especially
in dynamic environments, such as underwater.

The ultimate goal of this work is to learn a di-
alog strategy that optimizes interaction for qual-
ity and speed of plan creation, thus linking in-
teraction style with extrinsic task success metrics.
Therefore, we conducted a Wizard of Oz (WoZ)
study for data collection that can be used to derive
reward functions for Reinforcement Learning, as
in (Rieser, 2008).

Similar work is shown in (Kitaev et al., 2019),
where the task involves two humans collabora-
tively drawing objects with one being the teller
and the other the person who draws. The agents
must be able to adapt and hold a dialog about novel
scenes that will be dynamically constructed. How-
ever, in our scenario the agent must be capable of
not only adapting but also identifying and editing
specific attributes of the dynamic objects that are
being created in the process.

Previous data collection on situated dialog, such
as the Map Task Corpus (Anderson et al., 1991),
tackle the importance of referencing objects while
giving instructions on a drawn map with land-
marks either for identification purposes or for
displaying the perceived understanding of their
shared environment. Our task is different in that
it involves subjects collaboratively creating a plan



2

on a nautical chart rather than passively follow-
ing instructions. In addition, our environment is
dynamic. New objects are being created and the
user with the agent, together, come up with the de-
sired referring expressions (see Figure 3). A sim-
ilar interactive method is described in (Schlangen,
2016), where they ground non-linguistic visual in-
formation through conversation.

In situated dialog, each user can perceive the en-
vironment in a different way, meaning that refer-
ring expressions need to be carefully selected and
verified, especially if the shared environment is
ambiguous (Fang et al., 2013). Our contributions
include: 1) a generic dialog framework and the
implemented software to conduct multiple wiz-
ard WoZ experiments for multimodal collabora-
tive planning interaction; 2) available on request,
a corpus of 22 dialogs on 2 missions with varying
complexities and 3) a corpus analysis (Section 4)
indicating that incorporating an extra modality in
conjunction with spatial referencing in a chatting
interface is crucial for successfully planning mis-
sions.

3 Method and Experiment Set-up

Our ‘planning assistant’ conversational agent will
interface with planning software called SeeTrack
provided by our industrial partner SeeByte Ltd.
SeeTrack can run with real AUVs running See-
Byte’s Neptune autonomy software or in simula-
tion and allows the planning of missions by defin-
ing a set of objectives with techniques described in
(Lane et al., 2013; Miguelanez et al., 2011; Petil-
lot et al., 2009). These can include, for example,
searching for unexploded mines by surveying ar-
eas in a search pattern, while collecting sensor data
and if, for example, a suspect mine is found then
the system can investigate a certain point further
(referred to as target reacquisition).

We used two wizards for our experiment, see
Figure 1 for the set-up. We refer here to the
wizards as 1) Chatting-Wizard (CW), who alone
communicates with the subject getting informa-
tion that is required to create the plan; and 2) the
SeeTrack Wizard (SW), who sits next to the CW
and implements the subject’s requirements into a
plan using SeeTrack and passes plan updates in the
form of images to the CW to pass onto the subject.
The subject was in a separate room to the wizards
and interacted via a chat window for receiving text
and images of the updated plan and sending text.

Wizard, b) Chatting Wizard, and c) Subject console.
Figure contains images from Seebyte’s SeeTrack inter-
face.

In order to establish the main actions and dialog
act types for the system to perform, we recorded
an expert planning a mission on SeeTrack whilst
verbalizing the planning process and his reason-
ing. Similar human-provided rationalisation has
been used to generate explanations of deep neural
models for game play (Harrison et al., 2018). Af-
ter analysing the expert video, we implemented a
multimodal Wizard of Oz interface that is capable
of sending messages, either in structured or free
form as well as images of the plan. The Wizard
Interface is made up of four windows (see Fig-
ure 2). The first has all the possible dialog acts
(DA) the wizard can use together with predefined
utterances for expedited responses. Once the DA
is selected the predefined text appears in the chat
window, from there the CW is able to modify as
needed. The third window allows the CW to insert
values (also referred to as ‘slots’) needed for the
plan obtained through interaction from the user.
Finally, the fourth window is for recording session
details such as subject ID. The CW works collab-
oratively with the subject to develop a list of the
necessary parameters that the SW needs to create
the plan.

Each subject was given a short questionnaire to
collect demographic information and instructions
on how to approach the task of planning a mis-
sion using a conversational agent. A mission in
our context is comprised of a nautical chart and
a description of some objective that the subjects,
together with the wizards, have to achieve. There
are two main categories of missions A and B. The
first (A) involves sending AUVs to survey areas of
interest on the chart and is more time consuming.
The second (B) category entails the reacquisition
of a target, which overall can be achieved in less

time. This is because surveying an area requires
extra interactions between the operators and typi-
cally more spatial commands. Subjects were told
that they had to plan both missions within a total
time of one hour. Table 1 shows that the first mis-
sion took more time to plan in terms of actual plan-
ning time and number of user/system turns. This
is normal because the first mission was of cate-
gory A, which is by design harder, and the second
mission of category B. The wording of the mission
was very high level, so as not to prime the subjects.
There are many elements that make up a plan (e.g.
survey areas, exclusion zones) and therefore many
variations are possible. Once both missions were
completed, a post-questionnaire was administered
to obtain their subjective opinion on the planning
process. Subjects were told at the end that they
were interacting with a wizard.

3.1 Subject Group

Planning missions for AUVs is a complex task, es-
pecially in the case of sophisticated software, such
as SeeTrack. For this reason, we decided to focus
our study mostly on expert users, who are famil-
iar with SeeTrack and AUVs. We recruited human
operators from industry (10 male, Mage=30), who
all had some experience with SeeTrack.

4 Corpus Analysis

We collected 22 dialogs between the wizards and
the subjects, which were analysed by a single an-
notator (an author). Figure 3 shows an example
of a dialog interaction with corresponding dialog
acts. We split our analysis into objective and sub-
jective measures.

1. USER: ‘move t2 200m west of t1’[inform]

2. SYSTEM:‘Could you repeat that in different
words? t1? t2?’[repeat]

3. USER:‘move target2 200m west of tar-
get1’[inform]

displaying 2 targets, a launch and a recovery point [di-
alog act]. Figure contains images from Seebyte’s See-
Track interface.

4.1 Objective Measures
Dialog act types were adopted from the ISO
(24617-2:2012) standard for dialog act annota-
tion. Figure 4 gives the distribution of dialog acts,
which were categorized into five groups:

1. Generic (conversational acts): wait, ack, af-
firm, yourwelcome, thankyou, bye, hello, re-
peat, praise, apology

2. Inform (for informing of values for slots):
inform, negate, delete, create, correction,
plan complete, plan mission

3. Request (for requesting information): re-
quest, enqmore

4. Suggest (for making suggestion): suggest

5. Image (for interacting with images): im-
age caption, show picture

The most frequent user DA is the “inform” dia-
log act (54%), which informs the system about the
plan slot values. This dialog act is also used for

# of turns 26.4(9.1) 13.1(4.4)
# of system utterances 51.4(21.0) 27.0(7.5)

utterances that instruct the system to move objects
around the chart by referring either to the object’s
position or to nearby objects. 53% of these “in-
form” acts contain referring expressions (see lines
1 and 3 of Figure 3 for examples). In addition, it is
clear that, due to the spatial nature of the tasks, the
extra modality of plan images is key to successful
planning, as reflected by the frequency of ‘Image’
dialog acts (around 16% of the total dialog acts).
These DAs include the user requesting a plan im-
age ‘show picture’ or ‘image caption’ where the
system, either proactively or as a response to a
user request, sends an image of the plan. The most
used DA by the wizard was “ack” 30%, used for
acknowledging information (e.g. “okay”).

“S” is for system only DA, “U” is for user only DA and
“S/U” refers to DA that both the system and the user.

4.2 Quality of the plan
The subjective quality of the plans were measured
by an expert, who has worked for years on plan-
ning missions, using a 5-point scale (see Table
2). The quality of a plan was measured accord-
ing to the completeness, appropriateness and if
it was operationally successful. At least 45% of
the plans for both missions were measured “High
Quality”, with a greater number of lower rated
plans for Mission 1. No correlation was found be-
tween time-on-task and quality of plans, however,

subjective feedback indicates that subjects would
have liked more time to improve their plans. The
response time of the Wizard was slower than nat-
ural interaction (average 15sec), which is a typ-
ical issue in WoZ studies. The dataset contains
plans of varying quality, which we hope will en-
able the system to learn better strategies for cre-
ating optimal plans, as well as, coping strategies.
There is a medium-strong positive correlation of
r = 0.59 (Spearman’s Correlation) between the
expertise of the subjects (as determined by the
pre-questionnaire) and the quality of the plan for
the first mission indicating that, perhaps unsurpris-
ingly, the higher the expertise, the better the qual-
ity of plans.

Quality Mission 1 Mission 2
Very High Quality 0% 9%
High Quality 45% 45%
Neutral 9% 36%
Low Quality 18% 9%
Very Low Quality 27% 0%

Table 2: The quality of all 22 plans measured by an
expert using a 5-point Likert scale.

4.3 Subjective Measures
The post-task questionnaire measured the subjec-
tive scores for User Satisfaction (US), the pace
of the experiment and the importance of mul-
timodality. Specifically the following questions
were asked on a 5-point Likert Scale:

• Q1: I felt that VERSO understood me well
• Q2: I felt VERSO was easy to understand
• Q3: I knew what I could say at each point in

the interaction
• Q4: The pace of interaction of VERSO was

appropriate
• Q5: VERSO behaved as expected
• Q6: It was easy to create a plan with VERSO

• Q7: From my current experience with using
VERSO, I would use the system regularly to
create plans

• Q8: The system was sluggish and slow to re-
spond (reversed)

• Q9: The screen shots of the plan were useful
• Q10: The screen shots of the plan were sent

frequently.



5

Mean US is 3.5 out of 5, calculated as an aver-
age of Q1-7, which are questions adapted from the
PARADISE evaluation framework (Walker et al.,
1997). Q8 reflects the speed of the interaction with
the mean/mode/median as 4/4/4. This score is re-
versed and so these high scores indicate high per-
ceived slowness. As mentioned above, this is a
common problem with wizarding set-ups and will
not be a problem for the final implemented sys-
tem. Q9 and Q10 refer to the images sent and
we can see from the mean/mode/median of 4.6/5/5
for Q9 that images were clearly useful but perhaps
could be sent more frequently (3/4/3 for Q10). The
users’ preference for images of plans may be re-
lated to their cognitive styles being mostly spatial.

After both tasks, we collected perceived work-
load using NASA Task Load Index (NASA-
TLX) (Dickinson et al., 1993), where low scores
indicate low cognitive workload. Our mean Raw
TLX score was 46/100 (SD = 9.08). This mean
score is comparable to a study for remote con-
trolling robots through an interface as reported in
(Kiselev and Loutfi, 2012). Further analysis and
data collection would be needed to understand the
user workload with respect to interaction phenom-
ena observed in the corpus.

4.4 Qualitative Feedback

Subjects were asked two open questions of what
they liked or not about VERSO. An inductive, the-
matic analysis was done using grounded theory
with open coding (Strauss, 1987). Themes iden-
tified include:

Theme 1 Suggestions for extra functionality:
Due to delays some subjects were not sure if the
program crashed. We had a dialog act “wait” but
feedback indicated it would be better to have a vi-
sual indicator as well. Note, in the actual future
working system, we will not have the same delays
as in the WoZ experiment.

Theme 2 Chart meta-data: Some subjects (P5
most specifically) desired more meta-data on the
plan images they were receiving when referring to
an object. When performing spatial tasks on the
chart, clear referring expressions are crucial and
meta-data on the chart, such as entity names (as
with the Map Task (Anderson et al., 1991) land-
marks), would help establish grounded referring
expressions.

In our case, some of the referring expressions

were names decided on between the Wizard and
the subject, e.g. survey3. However, if the sub-
ject uses such objects as points of reference, e.g.
”place target1 near survey3”, this can become
problematic when the object (”survey3”) could
measure up to a mile width because the exact lo-
cation for ”target1” is ambiguous.

Theme 3 Mixed initiative & Handling multi-
ple requests: The WoZ interface was designed as
a mixed-initiative dialog system, capable of sug-
gesting actions and the subjects seem to like this
type of interaction. Also noted was the ‘system’s’
ability to handle multiple requests in a single ut-
terance, which will need to be implemented in the
final system.

5 Discussion and Future work

This paper presents a two-wizard WoZ study for
collecting data on a collaborative task, identify-
ing the importance of mixed modalities and object
referencing, for successful interaction during mis-
sion planning. Further data collection on Amazon
Mechanical Turk using Open Street Maps will be
conducted in order to reach a wider audience and
compensate for the gender imbalance.

Deep learning methods have surpassed human
performance in a variety of tasks and one crucial
factor for this achievement is the amount of data
used to tune these models. However, to be able to
learn from limited amounts of data will be key in
moving forward (Daugherty and Wilson, 2018).

In future work, the corpus described here will be
used in the development of a mixed-initiative data-
driven multimodal conversational agent, for plan-
ning missions collaboratively with a human oper-
ator. With the collected WoZ data, we can capture
the main strategies of how to plan a mission and
make data-driven simulations possible. Therefore,
we can train a Reinforcement Learning agent on
simulated dialogs that are fully data-driven with
the reward function being derived from our sub-
jects’ preferences, optimizing for plan quality and
speed. Moreover, supervised approaches that re-
quire less data to learn, such as the Hybrid Code
Networks (HCN) (Williams et al., 2017), could be
used for the creation of such a system. Finally, the
system will be compared to a baseline in a further
human evaluation study.
