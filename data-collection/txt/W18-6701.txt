Abstract

Conversational AI has seen a surge in popularity recently with the rise of chatbots and smart speakers
such as Amazon Alexa and Google Home. A logical extension of this development that can be expected
is a rise in popularity of NLG in such settings, as the task of such a conversational system consists
mainly of producing an output in natural language for a given language input. However, the extent to
which NLG has seen adoption in conversational settings has been limited so far. In this talk I will give an
overview to which extent NLG is used for conversational AI in the Flow.ai conversational AI platform. I
will discuss training an end-to-end recurrent neural network on various data sets to build conversational
systems, give an overview of the evaluation and discuss what can be expected of such systems in a
practical setting. I will also discuss other uses of NLG within conversational AI, ranging from basic
slot filling to more advanced functionality such as generation of data for the training of conversational
AI agents or to support humans in customer service settings by providing template responses in order to
decrease response times.
