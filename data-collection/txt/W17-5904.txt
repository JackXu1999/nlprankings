Abstract

In today’s technology driven digital era,
education domain is undergoing a trans-
formation from traditional approaches to
more learner controlled and flexible meth-
ods of learning. This transformation has
opened the new avenues for interdisci-
plinary research in the field of educational
technology and natural language process-
ing in developing quality digital aids for
learning and teaching. The tool presented
here - Hindi Shabhadamitra, developed
using Hindi Wordnet for Hindi language
learning, is one such e-learning tool. It has
been developed as a teaching and learning
aid suitable for formal school based cur-
riculum and informal setup for self learn-
ing users. Besides vocabulary, it also pro-
vides word based grammar along with im-
ages and pronunciation for better learning
and retention. This aid demonstrates that
how a rich lexical resource like wordnet
can be systematically remodeled for prac-
tical usage in the educational domain.

1 Introduction
With technology expanding into every domain of
society, its impact is visible in the education do-
main as well. And with improving infrastructure
and better technologies the digitization in educa-
tion is here to stay. Another important catalyst
in this area is the receptiveness of the entities in-
volved viz. students and teachers.

The technology has provided an edge by reduc-
ing the cost of delivering the education to volume
of students. Due to its multi-sensory impact, the
researchers have proved that, e-learning enhances
the students’ outcome (Shams and Seitz, 2008;
Sankey et al., 2010). With all these benefits, the
need for quality digital aids for learning becomes
imminent.

As the trend of global citizen is becoming more
prevalent, the knowledge of multiple language be-
comes preferable. For any language learning ac-
tivity, vocabulary learning is considered central
(Alqahtani et al., 2015). Besides this, the other
directions of language learning include grammar
learning, conversational usage, colloquial usage,
literary usage, etc. Digital language learning aids
are a big support in this direction.

Understanding a word involves - committing to
memory its form, capturing its relationship with
other words and finally knowing how and where
to use it. Vocabulary learning methods (Nation
and Newton, 1997; Dunlosky et al., 2013; Oxford,
2016) vary from –

• Directly learning the language without any in-
tervention of the mother tongue.

• Translating the words from target language to
mother tongue of the learner in order to con-
vey the meaning.

• Highlighting the new words in a given text
and finding out its meaning with the help of
a glossary or synonyms.

Keeping vocabulary and grammar learning as
pivotal to language learning, an e-learning tool,
Hindi Shabdamitra, has been developed.

This paper presents a digital Hindi language
teaching and learning aid, Hindi Shabdamitra,
which is mainly a vocabulary and word specific
grammar learning aid for formal and informal se-
tups of language learning. It uses Hindi Wordnet1
as a resource for vocabulary teaching.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows:
section 2 gives information about the related work,
section 3 introduces the Hindi Shabdamitra, sec-
tion 4 provides the user field response, which is
followed by conclusion and future work.

2 Related Work
The literature about vocabulary learning strate-
gies, language learning psychology and digital
educational applications shows that multi-modal
learning always result in better retention (Dale,
1969). Vocabulary is cited as the one of the pri-
mary reasons for learner’s ability and confidence
to communicate. Various mechanical strategies
like repetition, context, usage and visual correla-
tion have been tested by language experts for en-
hancing the vocabulary (Atasheneh and Naeimi,
2015; Butler et al., 2010). When the information
enters the system through various senses, the brain
tries to overcome the limited processing abilities
of each individual senses, which results in better
information processing (Clark and Paivio, 1991).
The multi-modal learning environments have been
studied in different settings (Mayer and Moreno,
2003; Moreno and Mayer, 2007; Shams and Seitz,
2008; Sankey et al., 2010) which shows its posi-
tive impact on learners. To enhance the willing-
ness of the learner for self-directed technology (Lai
et al., 2016), Mobile Assisted Language Learning
(MALL) (Yang, 2013) and gamification is seen as
an effective pedagogical strategy. These strategies
help to engage and motivate the learner to learn in a
relaxed environment (Werbach and Hunter, 2012;
Figueroa Flores, 2015).

Semantic relations of words have shown to help
in better understanding of new vocabulary (Lin,
1997). The wordnet2, a rich lexical resource based
on semantic relations, have been explored for vo-
cabulary learning and other related language learn-
ing applications (Hu et al., 1998; Sun et al., 2011;
Brumbaugh, 2015; Hiray, 2015).

3 Hindi Shabdamitra: An E-Learning
Teaching Aid

3.1 Background
Hindi written in Devanagari script is the official
language of the Republic of India. It is one of
the widely spoken languages in India. For learn-
ing Hindi, a lot of digital content is available on-
line in the form of games, stories, poems and theme
based conversation, along with basic knowledge of
grammar and vocabulary. The content delivered
to learners via subscribed Youtube videos, sub-
scribed web interfaces, social media websites, live
skype lectures, purchasable DVDs, etc. Some of

2https://wordnet.princeton.edu/

the applications for language learning which offer
Hindi learning are - Duolingo3, Hindipod4, Rocket
Language5, Italki6, etc. Some applications meant
specifically for children are dinolingo7, akhlesh8,
galligallisimsim9, etc. Other online resources for
Hindi language are bilingual dictionaries which
provide only the meanings of the words, such as
Shabdkosh10, Collins dictionary11, etc. The com-
monality among all the above resources is their in-
ability of customization for formal school setups.
They are more focused for individual learning.

As per renowned teaching methodology and vo-
cabulary acquisition researcher, Prof. Paul Nation,
vocabulary teaching should be done in a structured
way (Nation and Newton, 1997; Carter, 1987; Lin,
1997). The aim should be to improve the passive
knowledge and make the learner able to use the
words in their day-to-day communication.

A study of current digital resources used by var-
ious educational institution was also done as part
of the background study. The outcome showed a
big gap of quality resources which can cover all as-
pects of language learning like grammar, concepts,
usage and pronunciations in an effective manner.

This motivation led to the development of a dig-
ital aid that would fill this gap for Hindi language
learning. Through the e-learning tool presented
here Hindi Shabdamitra, an attempt has been
made to teach and learn Hindi language in both for-
mal and informal settings, along with learning of
the word based grammatical features. Further, this
tool facilitates learning with the help of illustra-
tions and pronunciation for multi-sensory impact.

3.2 Hindi Shabdamitra
Hindi Shabdamitra (िहदंी शब्दिमतर्)12 is a digital aid
designed for assisting in learning and teaching of
Hindi language. It is developed in correlation with
school curriculum, which is considered here as a
formal setup of learning. Along with schools, it
can also be used by individuals or organizations not
following any specific curriculum viz. NGOs, for-

eign Universities teaching Hindi, self learners, etc.,
which is considered as a non formal setup of learn-
ing. It uses Hindi Wordnet as a base resource that
has been remodeled for this aid by incorporating
the multi-modal features. Further, The concepts
are grammatically enriched and simplified depend-
ing upon the understanding level of the learner.

As small children learn easily and effortlessly
if a picture is provided rather than a text content.
Hence, for the initial phase, concepts are pictori-
ally depicted by providing illustrations for level 1
and 2, so that a given concept can be easily cap-
tured by these kids. The illustrations are digi-
tally drawn by the in-house illustrators keeping the
sense of a concept in mind. Most of the illustra-
tions are simple and shows positivity and happi-
ness, and conveys the right information.

Also, search-words are provided with the audio
pronunciation. These words are recorded by na-
tive speakers of the language in the standard Hindi
format.

A team of lexicographers, illustrators and
native language speakers have contributed to
build this multi-modal resource which has formed
the base of Hindi Shabdamitra. The tool has an
online web-based and app-based interface for
wider reachability. Also, this tool can be made
available offline for anytime anywhere learning.
The interface allows the search navigation in two
ways – level wise (िहदंी ज्ञान स्तर के अनुसार, hiMdii
GYaana stara ke anusaara) and class wise (कक्षा के
अनुसार, kaxaa ke anusaara). This can be seen in
figure 1.

The unique features of this E-learning tool are –

• It is meant for Hindi language learning, in

sync with school curriculum

• It allows vocabulary and word related gram-
matical feature learning

• It can be used for formal i.e., school curricu-
lum based setup and informal i.e., individual
based setup of learning and teaching

• It has a multifaceted design having pictures
and audio pronunciation

• It provides learning through layered interface
for wider audience

• It allows student and teacher participation and
engagement

• It has a learner friendly interface for ease of
learning

• It is accessible on mobiles, smart devices,
computers, etc.

• It is available in online and off-line mode.

This tool can assist the teachers in better class-
room management and make learning Hindi an in-
teresting activity. Also, this tool can assist self
learners using the layered approach.

3.3 Resource used: Hindi Wordnet
Hindi Wordnet, a digital language resource, is
an online lexical repository having synonymy set
called as synset. Synset contains a gloss (def-
inition) and an example sentence. Wordnet is
linked by semantic relations like hypernymy (is-
a), meronymy (part-of), troponymy (manner-of),
etc. and by lexical relations like antonymy, gra-
dation, etc. (Bhattacharyya, 2010). It was origi-
nally developed for the research in the area of Nat-
ural Language Processing. Hindi wordnet, being
a rich lexical resource, which is a dictionary cum
thesaurus, have been used as a resource for the de-
velopment of this digital aid. In particular, the tool
uses Hindi wordnet’s gloss, examples, synonyms,
ontological information, lexico-semantic relations.
Some of the above information is modified as per
the level of the learner.

3.4 A Layered Interface
Hindi Shabdamitra has been designed for a wider
range of target audience. Keeping in sight the level
of the learners, the interface has a layered architec-
ture. It has the following five layers:

25



Figure 2: Class wise search in Hindi Shabdamitra

• Level 1 (for classes 1 and 2)

• Level 2 (for classes 3, 4 and 5)

• Level 3 (for classes 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10)

• Level 4 (for classes 11 and 12)

• Level 5 (for classes above 12, researchers,
language learners, etc.)

The same search-word can be studied by the learn-
ers of all 5 levels. At each level incremental in-
formation is displayed. The depth of content dis-
played in terms of synonyms, grammatical infor-
mation, ontological information will vary from
level to level.

3.4.1 Class-wise Search Selection
The tool has been devised keeping in mind the
different school curriculum based on the affilia-
tions to various governing bodies responsible for
standardization of school education, i.e., CBSE13,
ICSE14, state boards, etc. In class-wise search, a
‘board’ is selected followed by ‘class number’ and
‘lesson number’. This selection allows the teacher
to choose the words from the syllabus which she/he
is going to teach in class to students. The major
advantage here is that the tool covers all the vo-
cabulary in a given class as these words were man-
ually collected from the school curriculum. This
will assist teacher in teaching all possible words
available in a given lesson. At the same time,
the word related grammatical features like gender,
countability, etc. and lexico-semantic relations
like antonyms, synonyms, etc. can be taught to
students. Figure 2 shows an instance of class wise
search explaining the concept of a word ‘माँ’ (maa ,

a mother). In this example only प रभाषा (parib-
haaShaa, a gloss or concept definition), वाक्य में
पर्योग (vaakya meM prayoga, usage in an example),
बहवचन (bahuvachana, plural) and समानाथीर् शब्द
(samaanaarthii shabda, synonyms) has been se-
lectively displayed. Here, for class 1 to class 5 the
gloss and example sentence from original Hindi
Wordnet is further simplified by providing the sim-
ple words in the definition so that the students at
these levels can easily pick-up and learn concept
comfortably. At the higher classes the more infor-
mation like lexico-semantic relations like hyper-
nymy, holonymy, etc. along with grammatical fea-
tures like transitivity, kind of noun or verb, etc., is
provided.

3.4.2 Level-wise Search Selection
Level wise search interface is designed for the in-
formal non-curriculum based scenario where any
person can learn a given word and understand it
at his/her own pace. In this interface, the search
is not restricted to the vocabulary of a given class
and lesson. Here the learner has two options to fol-
low. One, where the learner is not sure of his/her
expertise of knowledge. In such case, the informa-
tion can be accessed in small portions so that the
learner is able to grasp it better. Once comfortable
with the low level content, the learner can opt for
more detailed information about the search-word.
The other flow, where the learner is aware and can
choose the level based on his/her knowledge.

Level 1 is for beginners, level 2 is for interme-
diate learners, level 3 for proficient, level 4 for ad-
vanced and level 5 for experts. The amount of in-
formation displayed is varied based on the level se-
lected. In each level the information is rendered
based on its part-of-speech category and grammat-
ical properties.

Figure 3 shows the level wise search for level
2. In this figure, the information rendered in Hindi
is प रभाषा (paribhaaShaa, a gloss or concept def-
inition), वाक्य में पर्योग (vaakya meM prayoga, us-
age in an example), बहवचन (bahuvachana, plural),
समानाथीर् शब्द (samaanaarthii shabda, synonyms),
लगं (liMga, gender), संज्ञा के पर्कार (saMGYaa ke
prakaara, kind of noun) and गणनीयता (gaNaniiy-
ataa, countability). Like Class-wise, there can be
more information at each levels depending upon
the part-of-speech category and the grammatical
features of a search-word.

Since, this is an era of smart devices such as mo-
biles, tablets, etc., the android based mobile app

for Intermediate learner (Level 2)

have been developed. Figure 4 shows the devel-
oped mobile interface for Hindi Shabdamitra.

4 Field Response

As part of testing the tool, the field trial of the
Hindi Shabdamitra’s web and app interface was
done at 3 local schools with around 400 students
and 10 teachers participating in the exercise. The
feedback was sought for the content, ease of han-
dling the application, classroom impact and overall
experience by teachers and students. Our observa-
tion and feedback from the teachers clearly indi-
cate that it helped teachers in explaining concepts
clearly with the help of illustrations and simplified
concepts. Audio clips helped in understanding the
pronunciation of a given word. The aid assisted the
teacher in better classroom management, reduced
effort of reiterating the concepts for better reten-
tion and having the standardized pronunciation by
the native Hindi speaker. The application has been

Figure 4: Mobile App for Hindi Shabdamitra

improved based on the feedback received by stu-
dents and teachers.

5 Conclusion and Future Work

With technological advancement, education do-
main is shifting from a traditional knowledge-
transfer model to a collaborative, multi-sensory,
self-paced, engaging model with the flexibility of
anywhere anytime learning. Based on Hindi Word-
net, Hindi Shabdamitra is one such comprehensive
e-learning tool which helps in learning Hindi lan-
guage, pronunciation, grammar and understand-
ing the concepts through illustrations, definition
and examples. It caters to a wide range of audi-
ence and is available in both web based and app
based formats for flexibility of usage. It is well re-
ceived by the learners in the initial phase of launch.
This aid shows how a semantically rich lexical re-
source like Wordnet, originally developed for re-
search purpose, can be modeled for practical usage
in education domain.

In future, the authors intend to include interac-
tive assessment module for evaluations and other
game based assessment modules for fun learning.
It can be extended for learning other Indian lan-
guages. Further, the illustrations, audio, grammat-
ical features, simplified gloss, etc. of Hindi Shab-
damitra can act as an enriched resource.
