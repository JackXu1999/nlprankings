Abstract

Relation between gender and language has
been studied by many authors, however,
there is still some uncertainty left regard-
ing gender influence on language usage
in the professional environment. Often,
the studied data sets are too small or texts
of individual authors are too short in or-
der to capture differences of language us-
age wrt gender successfully. This study
draws from a larger corpus of speeches
transcripts of the Lithuanian Parliament
(1990–2013) to explore language differ-
ences of political debates by gender via
stylometric analysis. Experimental set
up consists of stylistic features that indi-
cate lexical style and do not require exter-
nal linguistic tools, namely the most fre-
quent words, in combination with unsu-
pervised machine learning algorithms. Re-
sults show that gender differences in the
language use remain in professional en-
vironment not only in usage of function
words, preferred linguistic constructions,
but in the presented topics as well.

1 Introduction

Gender influence on language usage have been ex-
tensively studied (Lakoff, 1973; Holmes, 2006;
Holmes, 2013; Argamon et al., 2003) without
fully reaching a common agreement. Understand-
ing gender differences in professional environ-
ment would assist in a more balanced atmosphere
(Herring and Paolillo, 2006; Mullany, 2007), how-
ever results on extent of variation depending on
context of communication in professional setting
are inconclusive(Newman et al., 2008).

Most studies rely on the relatively small data
sets, or texts of the individual authors are too short

to capture the differences in the language due to
the gender (Newman et al., 2008; Herring and
Martinson, 2004). Some results show that gen-
der differences in language depend on the con-
text, e.g., people assume male language in a for-
mal setting and female in an informal environ-
ment (Pennebaker, 2011). We investigate gender
impact to the language use in a professional set-
ting, i.e., transcripts of speeches of the Lithua-
nian Parliament debates. We study language wrt
style, i.e., male and female style of the language
usage by applying computational stylistics or sty-
lometry. Stylometry is based on the two hypothe-
ses: (1) human stylome hypothesis, i.e., each in-
dividual has a unique style (Van Halteren et al.,
2005); (2) unique style of individual can be mea-
sured (Stamatatos, 2009), stylometry allows gain-
ing meta-knowledge (Daelemans, 2013), i.e., what
can be learned from the text about the author
- gender (Luyckx et al., 2006; Argamon et al.,
2003; Cheng et al., 2011; Koppel et al., 2002),
age (Dahllöf, 2012), psychological characteristics
(Luyckx and Daelemans, 2008), political affilia-
tion (Dahllöf, 2012), etc.

Like in most studies of gender and language
(Yu, 2014; Herring and Martinson, 2004), bio-
logical sex as a criterion for gender was used in
this study. We compare differences of the gen-
der related language use at the group level (fac-
tion). Lithuanian language allows easy distinction
between male and female legislators based on their
names in the transcripts.1

We investigate several questions: (1) How well
simple stylistic features distinguish genders of
members the Lithuanian Parliament? (2) Which
differences in language use by female and male
Lithuanian Parliament members selected features
and methods are able to capture?

1Of course, all information about members of parliament
is available on-line.102

2 Data Set

Corpus of parliamentary speeches in the Lithua-
nian Parliament2 is used. It consists of transcripts
of parliamentary speeches from March 1990 to
December 2013, 10727 of female members of Par-
liament (MPs) and 100181 of male MPs, over-
all 23 908 302 words (2 357 596 of female MPs
and 21 550 706 of male; see Table 2 for the de-
tails). Only speeches of at least 100 words and of
MPs with at least 200 of them were included in
the corpus (Kapočiūtė-Dzikienė and Utka, 2014).
It could have diminished number of female MPs
speeches included into the corpus and our anal-
ysis as well. However, the choice of unsuper-
vised learning approach downscales class imbal-
ance problem, i.e. significant difference in number
of transcribed parliamentary speeches made by fe-
male and male MPs.

Lithuanian is a highly inflective language, i.e.
nouns have grammatical gender, number and se-
mantic relations between them are expressed with
7 cases; adjectives have to match nouns in terms
of gender, number and case; verbs have 4 tenses
and particles for each of them, with ending mark-
ing its tense, person and number; gender and case
for the particles are also marked morphologically

2Corpus of parliamentary speeches in the Lithuanian Par-
liament was created in the project “Automatic Authorship At-
tribution and Author Profiling for the Lithuanian Language”
(ASTRA) (No. LIT-8-69), 2014 – 2015.

berra and 100–10000 MFW.

at the ending. All these features produce a sub-
stantial number of inflective forms for one lemma.
Thus in order to avoid data sparseness we did not
lemmatize corpus for our experiments.

To get around of “fingerprint” of individual au-
thorship as much as possible, all the samples were
concatenated into two large documents based on
the gender, and then were partitioned into 15 parts
each. Thus for analysis we had 15 samples of par-
liamentary speech made by female MPs and an-
other 15 samples – made by male MPs.

3 Stylistic Features and Statistical
Measures

We use the most frequent words (MFW) (Bur-
rows, 1992; Hoover, 2007; Eder, 2013b; Rybicki
and Eder, 2011; Eder and Rybicki, 2013; Eder,
2013a) (usually, they coincide with function words
(Hochmann et al., 2010; Sigurd et al., 2004)), as
features, because they are considered to be topic-
neutral and perform well (Juola and Baayen, 2005;
Holmes et al., 2001; Burrows, 2002).

Stylo package for stylometric analysis using R
(Eder et al., 2014) is used for experiments.

Experiments are performed in batches using dif-
ferent number of MFWs, firstly, using the whole
corpus, raw frequency list of features is gener-
ated, then normalized using z-scores, which mea-
sure distance of features frequencies in the corpus
in terms of their proximity to the mean (Hoover,
2004), where z-scores are defined as z = Ai−µσ ,
where Ai is frequency of a feature, µ is mean fre-103

quency of certain feature in one document, σ is a
standard deviation.

Dissimilarity between the text samples is cal-
culated using selected distances (see below), and
distance matrix is generated. Then, hierarchical
clustering is applied to group samples by similar-
ity (Everitt et al., 2011), and dendrograms are used
to visualize the results.

Typically Burrows’s Delta distance is used for
stylometric analysis (Burrows, 2002; Rybicki and
Eder, 2011). However, Delta depends on z-scores,
number of documents and balance of terms in
documents, length and number of authors (Sta-
matatos, 2009). While Burrow’s Delta is effec-
tive for English and German, it is less success-
ful for highly inflective languages, e.g., Latin and
Polish (Rybicki and Eder, 2011). Hence we used
Eder’s Delta, i.e., a modified Burrows’s Delta that
gives more weight to the frequent features and
rescales less frequent to avoid random infrequent
ones (Eder et al., 2014). It was defined to use
with highly inflected languages, such as Lithua-
nian. However, we have achieved the best results

with Canberra distance δ(AB) =
∑n
i=1

|Ai−Bi|
|Ai|+|Bi|

where n is a number of most frequent features,
A and B are documents, Ai and Bi are frequen-
cies of a given feature in the documents A and
B in the corpus, respectively (Eder et al., 2014).
It was reported to be suitable for inflective lan-
guages, albeit it is sensitive for rare vocabulary
(Eder et al., 2014), e.g., words that occurred only
once or twice.

The goal is identifying stylistic dissimilarities
and mapping positions of the text samples in rela-
tion to each other, not classifying female/male leg-
islators, hence hierarchical clustering with Ward
linkage (it minimizes total variance within-cluster
(Everitt et al., 2011)) was chosen. Though it is
sensitive to changes in a number of features or
methods of grouping (Eder, 2013a; Luyckx et al.,
2006), in this study it shows stable results. Ro-
bustness of clustering results was examined us-
ing bootstrap procedure (Eder, 2013a). It includes
extensions of Burrows’s Delta (Argamon, 2008;
Eder et al., 2014) and bootstrap consensus trees
(Eder, 2013a) as a way to improve reliability of
cluster analysis dendrograms.

4 Experiments

From 20 to 10 000 most frequent features were
used for each experiment. We use hierarchical
clustering with Ward linkage and Canberra dis-
tance, and visualize results in dendrograms to map
positions of the samples in relation to each other.

We focus on identifying variation in female and
male parliamentary speech, and do not analyze
smaller clusters and dynamics inside them. A
more detailed investigation of separate features
(e.g., specific words, part-of-speech tags or their
sequences) that are characteristic to female MPs
and male MPs individually, are part of future
plans, while in this paper we focus on the most
frequent words.

Experiments with more MFW (from 7000 up
to 9910) successfully separated samples of parlia-
mentary speeches by gender, see Figure 1. Boot-
strap Consensus Tree (BCT) procedure (hierarchi-
cal clustering and aggregation of results into con-104

sensus tree (Eder, 2013a)) was applied to analyze
the results. Consensus strength of 0.75 was cho-
sen, i.e., the two documents are related, if they are
related in the same proportion in the hierarchical
clustering. So, consensus strength 0.75 means that
visualized linkages appear in at least 75% of the
clusters. See Figure 2 for BCT results for separat-
ing male and female legislators in the Lithuanian
Parliament.

We needed at least 7000 MFW for clear differ-
entiation of parliamentary speeches by gender in
LT parliament. It shows that differences in top-
ics presented as content words are less frequent
than function words. To test this assumption, we
performed experiments with different number and
ranges of MFWs. As Figure 3 shows, less frequent
MFWs capture gender variation as well.

The following gender based differences were
noted male speeches transcripts (underscores
show merge words that are one word in Lithua-
nian, but are several in English): (1) pronouns I,
we; (2) demonstratives (e.g. this); (3) conjunctions
but, whether, if ; (4) negations (won’t_succeed,
don’t_do); (5) responsibility, public; (6) fighting,
taking_out. Some common characteristics of tran-

scripts of female speeches: (1) conjunction and;
(2) preposition with; (3) parliament, bill; (4) mea-
surements (degree, percentage); (5) parliamentary
procedures (acting, appointive, would_be_valid,
legal). See Figures 4 and 5 for details.

The results show that simple features and meth-
ods, such as MFW and hierarchical clustering, per-
form well with Lithuanian (morphology-rich lan-
guage with relatively free word order, thus, chal-
lenging for many NLP tasks) and identify gen-
der effect on language variation in LT parliament
speeches transcripts, and do not require using lem-
mas (Kapočiūtė-Dzikienė et al., 2014), part-of-
speech n-grams (Eder, 2010) and other feature
combinations (Argamon et al., 2007; Argamon et
al., 2003; Yu, 2014)).

5 Conclusion and Future Work

Results show that MFW and hierarchical clus-
tering with Canberra distance successfully cap-
ture variation in transcripts of speeches by female
and male MPs, which are clearly visible in den-
drograms. Experiments with different ranges of
MFW show, that more frequent MFW identify
variation in usage of function words, medium fre-105



quent MFW reveal variation in topics presented.
Thus, for female MPs conjunction and, prepo-
sition with, words parliament and bill, words
for measuring and parliamentary procedures were
more characteristic, while male MPs tended to use
more first person pronouns, demonstratives, nega-
tions, conjunctions but, whether, if and words re-
sponsibility, public, taking out, fighting.

Future plans include experiments with different
domain documents, diverse language types (e.g.,
formal, informal), investigation of other features
(e.g., specific words, lemmas, part-of-speech tags
or their sequences) that are characteristic to differ-
ent genders, and other distance measures.
