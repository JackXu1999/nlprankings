Abstract

We model the problem of monolingual
textual alignment as a Quadratic As-
signment Problem (QAP) which simul-
taneously maximizes the global lexico-
semantic and syntactic similarities of two
sentence-level texts. Because QAP is
an NP-complete problem, we propose a
branch-and-bound approach to efficiently
find an optimal solution. When compared
with other methods and studies, our results
are competitive.

1 Introduction

Textual alignment between two sentences involves
the identification of words and phrases consid-
ered to be semantically equivalent or very close
in meaning (within the context of the respective
sentences). Monolingual alignment is particularly
useful for the task of text-to-text semantic similar-
ity (Agirre et al., 2012; Rus et al., 2013). Figure 1
shows an example of human generated alignments
between two sentences from the corpus used by
Thadani et al. (2012), which is a modified corpus
of human-aligned paraphrases initially described
in Cohn et al. (2008).

While monolingual text alignment has been
tackled as a task of its own only recently (Mac-
Cartney et al., 2008; Thadani and McKeown,
2011; Yao et al., 2013; Sultan et al., 2014),
text alignment has been explored intensely in the
area of machine translation (Och and Ney, 2003;
Brunning, 2010). Brunning (2010) distinguishes
among three levels of alignment in machine trans-
lation: document alignment, sentence alignment,
and word/phrase level alignment. We focus here
on word-level alignment. Furthermore, we focus
on monolingual word alignment in the context of
sentence-to-sentence similarity tasks such as tex-
tual entailment and paraphrase identification.

We focus on word-level (as opposed to phrase-
level) alignment for a number of reasons. First,
the vast majority of gold alignments in the two
datasets we use (95-96%) are word-level align-
ments (the rest are phrase-level). Similarly, Yao
et al. (2013) report that word-level alignments
constitute more than 95% of the alignments in re-
cent human-annotated corpora. A second reason
is the fact that our formulation of the monolin-
gual alignment task based on the Quadratic As-
signment Problem (QAP) (Burkard et al., 1998;
Lawler, 1963; Koopmans and Beckmann, 1957)
fits well with word-level alignment. Third, the key
ingredients in our solution (the word-to-word se-
mantic similarity measures and dependency rela-
tions) apply directly to words.

The role of word-to-word semantic similarity
measures and contextual information for mono-
lingual alignment has been explored in the past.
However, the jury is still out there with respect to
how to best combine these types of information
for monolingual alignment as one of the most re-
cent work in this area has illustrated (Sultan et al.,
2014). Sultan et al. (2014) showed that use of
local contextul information in combination with
hand-crafted dependency type equivalences yields
better results than methods that exploit local con-
text, e.g. Yao et al. (2013). Indeed, our approach
combines in unique ways word-to-word semantic
similarity measures with contextual information
in the form of dependency-relations among words
and with a combinatorial optimization formula-
tion based on the QAP problem. As dependencies
can capture longer-distance relationships between
words in a sentence, we can say that our method
uses more than just local context for aligning texts.
Furthermore, because the QAP formulation pro-
vides a global optimal solution, our method is in-
deed accounting for the full sentential context.

Indeed, our QAP formulation simultaneously
accounts for word-level similarities and similari-

ties between corresponding syntactic/grammatical
relations in a globally optimal manner. In contrast,
Chambers et al. (2007) method for sentence level
monolingual alignment finds a local maximum,
which only in certain, lucky circumstances may
also be a global maximum. Optimization meth-
ods have been proposed for phrase-level monolin-
gual alignment (MacCartney et al., 2008; Thadani
and McKeown, 2011; Thadani et al., 2012) in the
context of a paraphrase task that rely on integer
linear programming. Our optimization method is
based on a different paradigm, the QAP formula-
tion, and we rely on word-to-word semantic simi-
larity measures, some of which are totally unsu-
pervised such as Latent Semantic Analysis, and
syntactic relation identity as opposed to edit dis-
tances. Thadani et al. (2011; 2012) used string
similarity and WordNet for computing semantic
relatedness.

We evaluated the proposed method on two
datasets. The first one is the SEMILAR corpus
(Rus et al., 2013), a subset of 701 randomly se-
lected pairs from the Microsoft Research Para-
phrase Corpus (MSRP) (Dolan et al., 2004). The
pairs were manually annotated with tokens and
phrase alignments. The second dataset is the eval-
uation corpus used by Thadani et al. (2012), called
the Edinburg corpus, a modified corpus of human-
aligned paraphrases, initially described in Cohn et
al. (2008).

2 Related Work

The Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) is
a classical combinatorial optimization problem
(Burkard et al., 1998; Lawler, 1963; Koopmans
and Beckmann, 1957). QAP has been originally
formulated to minimize the overall cost of eco-
nomic activities. QAP is an NP-hard problem
(Sahni and Gonzalez, 1976).

We adapted the QAP formulation to our mono-

lingual sentence-level alignment problem. In our
case, we want to find a mapping between words
in one sentence to words in another sentence that
maximizes the similarity between two texts in
terms of word-level similarity and simultaneously
accounting for the relations between the matched
words. That is, we prefer matchings between
words in two texts T1 and T2 that not only lead
to best word-level similarities but also the depen-
dencies among words in T1 and the corresponding
matched words in T2 must be optimally accounted
for. We use word-to-word similarity measures for
quantify the degree to which two words seman-
tically match each other. We experimented with
WordNet word-to-word similarity metrics (Ped-
ersen et al., 2004) and the algebraically-derived
Latent Semantic Analysis vectorial representation.
To extract dependency relations we employed the
Stanford CoreNLP Library.

Efforts to optimize the lexico-semantic, i.e.
word-level, similarity between texts have been re-
ported. Chan and Ng (2008) proposed a machine
translation evaluation metric based on the optimal
algorithm for bipartite graph matching also known
as the assignment problem (Kuhn, 1955; Munkres,
1957). The assignment problem ignores interde-
pendencies between words in a text although they
could be accounted for indirectly, as Chan and
Ng did. However, the indirect account of inter-
dependencies among words in a text does not lead
to an optimal solution that simultaneously maxi-
mizes overall word-level similariy while account-
ing for their contextual relations as encoded by,
for instance, dependency information. QAP has
been applied to the problem of word alignment
by Lacoste-Julien and colleagues (2006), though
their study is applied on pairs of bilingual sen-
tences (i.e. French and English) and it does not
consider syntactic dependencies between words in
a sentence.

As already mentioned, QAP is an NP-hard
problem. Efficient solutions work in general up to
problem sizes of 25 using dynamic programming
or branch-and-bound methods. In our case, we
propose a branch-and-bound method which guar-
antees the finding of optimal solutions for short
texts, i.e. typical sentences as those found in
the SEMILAR and Edinburg corpora, our target
datasets.

3 Alignment Approaches

We present in this section the details of the pro-
posed optimal solution to the task of textual align-
ment in the context of semantic similarity of two
sentences based on the QAP formulation. We start
by describing two simpler solutions for monolin-
gual text alignment: a greedy approach and an
optimal solution based on the assignment prob-
lem for which a polynomial algorithm exists â€“ the
Kuhn-Munkres algorithm (Kuhn, 1955; Munkres,
1957). We evaluated and compared these sim-
pler alignment methods to the proposed QAP so-
lution. In our experiments, we followed a train-
test methodology in which we first learnt the pa-
rameters of the various approaches on the training
part of the data sets and then used the trained ap-
proaches to evaluate the QAP method on the test
portion of the data.

3.1 Greedy Word-to-Word Alignment (GRD)

In the greedy approach to monolingual alignment,
words from one sentence (usually the shorter sen-
tence) are greedily matched, one by one, starting
from the beginning of the sentence, with the most
similar word from the other sentence. In case of
duplicates, because we require that words must be
part of at most one pair the order of the dupli-
cate words in the two sentences becomes impor-
tant such that the first occurrence in one sentence
matches with the first occurrence in the other sen-
tence and so on. Otherwise, the order in which
the matching words appear in the two sentences
does not matter. While simple and fast, the obvi-
ous drawback of the greedy method is that it can
mistakenly match words if there are two or more
ways to pair them, simply because of the order in
which they were processed. The next method tries
to solve this problem by searching for an align-
ment that leads to a global maximum similarity
score across all pairs of aligned words.

3.2 Optimal Word-to-Word Alignment via
Assignment Problem (w-OPT)

The job assignment problem or sailor assignment
problem or just the assignment problem is one of
the fundamental combinatorial optimization prob-
lems and consists of finding a maximum weight
matching in a weighted bipartite graph. Given a
complete bipartite graph, G = (S, T,E), with n
sailor vertices (S), n ships vertices (T ), and each
edge esâˆˆS,tâˆˆT âˆˆ E has a non-negative weight
w(s, t) indicating how qualified a sailor is for a
certain job, the task is to find a matching M from
S to T with maximum weight. In case of different
numbers of sailors or ships, dummy vertices could
be used.

The assignment problem can be thus formulated
as finding a permutation Ï€ for which Swâˆ’OPT =âˆ‘n

i=1w(si, tÏ€(i)) is maximum. Such an assign-
ment is called optimum assignment. An algo-
rithm, the Kuhn-Munkres method (Kuhn, 1955),
has been proposed that can find a solution to in
polynomial time.

In our case, we model the semantic similarity
problem as finding the optimum assignment be-
tween words in one text, T1, and words in another
text, T2, where the fitness between words belong-
ing in opposite texts can be measured by any word-
to-word semantic similarity function. That is, we
are after a permutation Ï€ for which Swâˆ’OPT =âˆ‘n

i=1 Î˜sim(vi, wÏ€(i)) is maximum where we note
Î˜sim to be any word-to-word similarity measure,
and v and w are words from the texts T1 and T2,
respectively.

The assignment problem only focuses on opti-
mally matching words in one sentence S to words
in the other sentence T based only on how the
words in S match the words in T. Interdependen-
cies among words in S or among words in T are
not taken into account. A solution that simultane-
ously accounts for such inter-dependencies, thus
capturing the context of each word in their corre-
sponding sentences, is presented next.

3.3 Optimal Sentence Alignment via
Quadratic Assignment (QAP)

QAP has two well-known, historically impor-
tant, formulations: the Koopmans-Beckmann
(1957) formulation, and the more general Lawler
(1963) formulation. We adapted the Koopmans-
Beckmann (1957) formulation as it more clearly
fits our task.

Proceedings of the 20th Nordic Conference of Computational Linguistics (NODALIDA 2015) 129



The goal is to find the optimum placement
function Ï€ that maximizes the objective function
QAP (F,D,B) defined below where F andD de-
scribe syntactic dependencies between words in
one sentence (S) and the other (T), respectively,
while B captures the word-to-word similarity be-
tween words across the two sentences, all of them
being symmetric, non-negative matrices. It should
be noted that in the original formulation the objec-
tive function was about minimizing an economic
cost while in our formulation we maximize the se-
mantic similarity between two sentences. We fur-
ther extend the objective function QAP by adding
relative weighs to both terms in the above formu-
lation resulting in the formulation below:

maxQAP(F,D,B) = Î±
nâˆ‘
i=1

nâˆ‘
j=1

fi,jdÏ€(i)Ï€(j)+

+(1âˆ’ Î±)
nâˆ‘
i=1

bi,Ï€(i)

The fi,j term quantifies the syntactic relation
between words i and j in text T1 which are
mapped to words Ï€(i) and Ï€(j) in text T2, respec-
tively. The distance dÏ€(i)Ï€(j) quantifies the syntac-
tic relation between words Ï€i and Ï€j . For words i
and j that have a direct dependency relation, fi,j
is set to 1 and 0 in case there is no direct depen-
dency between the two words. Similarly, the dis-
tance dÏ€(i)Ï€(j) between words Ï€(i) and Ï€(j) is set
to 1 in case there is a direct dependency relation
among them and 0 otherwise. We also experi-
mented with a variant in which we enforced that
the dependency between words i and j and the de-
pendency between the corresponding words in the
other text, Ï€(i) and Ï€(j), be of same type. That is,
we prefer matchings between words in two texts
T1 and T2 that not only lead to direct dependen-
cies between words in T1 and direct dependencies
between corresponding matched words in T2 but
those dependencies must be of the same type. We
obtained best results with this latter version which
we used to generate all results in this paper.

The Î± parameter can be used to bias the search,
to look for solutions that give more weight to
matching dependencies (represented in the first
term of the objective function) than to word sim-
ilarities (represented in the second term), or vice-
versa. When Î± = 0.5, equal importance is given
to both alignment criteria.

Solution Space
A brute force solution to the QAP problem, which
would generate all possible mappings from words
in a sentence to words in the other sentence, i.e. all
permutations, is infeasible as the solution space is
too big. When considering all possible pairings
of words between sentence A, of size n, and sen-
tence B of size m, where n < m, and we pose
no limitations on the type of pairings that can be
made, there are m!/(m âˆ’ n)! possible solutions.
It should be noted that exact proposed solutions to
the QAP problem can only handle instances up to
n = 25 (Christofides and Benavent, 1989) or in
special cases up to n = 30 (Anstreicher, 2003).

In the case of sentences of average size n=m=20
words, there are 2.4âˆ—1018 possible pairings, which
is too large. We have taken a number of steps to re-
duce the solution space in our case. We know that
words can only be paired with other words that
are semantically similar. Given a word-to-word
similarity metric, Î˜sim, which outputs a normal-
ized similarity value between 0 and 1 (0 means not
similar, 1 indicates equivalent meaning), we can
impose to pair only words with Î˜sim greater than
a similarity threshold value, which we will denote
â„¦. For instance, it does not make sense to consider
matching a verb with a determiner even if the sim-
ilarity is non-zero (but very close to zero, e.g. LSA
similarity score between provide and the is 0.042).
Moreover, in regard to the initial QAP search, we
can further reduce the space by focusing on pair-
ing only numbers and content words (i.e. nouns,
verbs, adjectives and adverbs), as these, along
with their associated dependencies, carry most of
the relevant semantic content in a sentence. We
also chose to pair words that have either identical
lemma forms (i.e. tell vs. told, gains vs. gain) or
the same part of speech. These constraints reduce
considerably the QAP search space.

The average size of a sentence in the SEMI-
LAR corpus is 21 tokens, with a maximum of 38,
while the Edinburg corpus contains sentences with
an average length of 22 tokens and a maximum of
50. Our branch and bound search allowed us to
find an optimal solution in under a second for all
instances on both corpora, when Î± â‰¤ 0.5.

Solving QAP via Branch & Bound
Branch-and-bound is one of the widely used
paradigms for handling NP-hard optimization
problems such as QAP. The gist of the branch-and-
bound paradigm is to avoid explicitly exploring

Proceedings of the 20th Nordic Conference of Computational Linguistics (NODALIDA 2015) 130



the entire solution space, which is too big for NP-
hard optimization problems, while assuring that
the unexplored parts of the space cannot contain
the optimal solution. This is possible by defining
a bounding function that always overestimates or
underestimates solutions, depending on what type
of optimal solution is sought, maximum or mini-
mum cost, respectively.

The proposed branch-and-bound method starts
with an initial solution, e.g. the optimal word-to-
word matching approach obtained using the Kuhn-
Munkres algorithm (w-OPT). We call this the cur-
rent optimal QAP solution (C; optimal solution
so far) and we denote CQAP the value of the
QAP (F,D,B) objective function for this solu-
tion. Next, the method iteratively explores new so-
lutions comparing at each step the current optimal
solution with new ones. The exploration follows
a search tree where each node represents a sub-
space of solutions. In our case, a subspace is de-
fined by a partial pairing, P , with p word-to-word
assignments (p < n). We define a bounding func-
tion F (P ) to compute an upper bound for the par-
tial pairing and therefore for the entire subspace
of solutions that contains this partial pairing. That
is, any solution S containing the partial pairing P
will have a QAP score that is guaranteed to be
less than the value of the bounding function for the
current node in the search tree, SQAP â‰¤ F (P ), for
âˆ€S, S âŠ‡ P . If F (P ) is not greater than the best so-
lution found so far, i.e. F (P ) â‰¤ CQAP , it means
there is no better solution than CQAP within the
subspace of complete solutions that contain the
partial pairing P , as F (P ) always overestimates
the QAP score of the solutions in this subspace.
Thus, the entire subspace can be further ignored
from the search. The details of the bounding func-
tion F (P ) are not presented here due to space rea-
sons.

Comparing QAP Alignment with GRD and
w-OPT
In this subsection, we exemplify how quadratic as-
signment (QAP) is more powerful when it comes
to aligning words in two sentences than the other
two methods described earlier: greedy (GRD) and
optimal word matching (w-OPT). We take the ex-
ample previously shown in Figure 1, an actual
sample instance extracted from the Edinburg cor-
pus. Its greedy alignment is shown in Figure 2.
Because of the selective order in which the greedy
method picks the matchings, notice that the two

â€™theâ€™ determiners, the â€™onâ€™ prepositions and both
commas are mistakenly matched between the two
texts. The word optimal (w-OPT) method does not
perform any better in this case. The QAP method
however, through the right use of the syntactic de-
pendencies, is almost identical with the human an-
notations shown in Figure 1, except that it finds
one extra unneeded pair between commas.

Though for our example, the w-OPT method
does not perform any different than the greedy
method, from our experiments we found that it
does perform better overall, but not consistently
better. This is due to the high-lexical overlap be-
tween sentences to be aligned in the datasets we
used.

4 Experiments and Results

We evaluated and compared the three alignment
methods presented in the previous section (GRD,
w-OPT and QAP) on two datasets that were man-
ually annotated with alignments between sen-
tences: the SEMILAR corpus (Rus et al. 2013)
and the Edinburg corpus (Thadani et al. 2012).
The SEMILAR corpus consists of a set of 701
instances extracted from the MSRP corpus and
which were tokenized, tagged and parsed with the
Stanford Core NLP library and then manually an-
notated with tokens and phrase alignments. The
Edinburg corpus contains 714 annotated instances
used for training, and 306 instances used for eval-
uation, also pre-processed and parsed for syntactic
dependencies using the Stanford NLP Parser.

As in Thadani et al. (2012), we used

Figure 2: Greedy alignment on training instance #28 of the Edinburg corpus

METEORâ€™s maximum accuracy alignment
(Denkowski and Lavie, 2011) as a baseline to
compare with our alignments. The evaluation
scores for the alignments are also similarly
computed as macro-average results: precision,
recall, and F-score values are computed for each
instance, then these scores are averaged across all
instances. Because we do word-level alignments
and the human-annotated data and METEOR
output include phrase-level alignments we have
to have a way to consistently assess the output of
the method. We assessed the phrase-level align-
ments using word-level alignments as explained
next. If the gold data contains a phrase-level
alignment then if the output of a method con-
tains an alignment between any two words in
the gold-aligned phrases then we consider the
system word-level alignment as a hit. Using this
method, the METEOR alignments are evaluated at
word-level and therefore can be directly compared
to our methodsâ€™ alignments. It should be noted
that phrase-level alignments are very few. On
the Edinburg corpus there are only 95 phrase
alignments produced by METEOR out of 5,046
alignments (word- and phrase-level) and on the
SEMILAR corpus METEOR produces only 30
phrase-level alignments out of 10,112 alignments.
This method of evaluating neither penalizes nor
rewards METEOR.

4.1 Results on the SEMILAR Corpus

Table 1 shows the alignment performance results
on the SEMILAR corpus, for all three alignment
methods and the METEOR baseline. For space
reasons, we picked two representative word-to-
word similarity metrics, JCN (Pedersen et al.,
2004) and LSA, and report comparative results
among the three alignment methods. Also, we
illustrate the impact of the â„¦ parameters using
the QAP method and a third word-to-word metric,

JCN (Pedersen et al., 2004). Note that by changing
the â„¦ value within some restrictive bounds, one
could control for a better precision, at the expense
of the recall, or viceversa, while keeping the over-
all F-score more or less the same. The other word-
to-word metrics that we experimented with, show
a similar trend in performance, with very small
variations from the ones we reported. It is impor-
tant to note that for the QAP method we used Î± =
0.5 which was chosen following the same process
explained in the next section. The QAP method
significantly outperforms both GRD and w-OPT
alignments for both JCN and LSA word-to-word
similarity metrics (p < 0.0018). The difference in
performance between GRD and w-OPT is signifi-
cant only on the LSA metric (p < 0.0058). Note
that the high performance scores for all methods
are due to the high lexical overlap, a characteristic
of the SEMILAR instances, which was inherited
from the original MSRP corpus.

4.2 Results on the Edinburg Corpus

We present now results when evaluating the three
alignment methods on the Edinburg corpus. As a
first step, we used the optimal method (w-OPT)
on the training subset to find the optimal word-
to-word threshold (â„¦) for seven word similarity
(Î˜sim) metrics. Six of them are WordNet based:
LIN, PATH, JCN, LCH, RES and WUP (Ped-
ersen et al., 2004); and one is LSA. Word-to-
word threshold values between 0 to 1 were eval-
uated in increments of 0.01 and the ones that gave
the best F-Score on the training set, when using
the w-OPT method, were selected: â„¦(LIN) =
0.73, â„¦(PATH) = 0.3, â„¦(JCN) = 0.23,
â„¦(LCH) = 0.69, â„¦(RES) = 0.47, â„¦(WUP ) =
0.85, â„¦(LSA) = 0.1.

Next, we searched for a good parameter Î± value
to use in the QAP alignment. We evaluated QAP
on the training set for several Î± values, from 0 to

1 in increments of 0.1, and various word-to-word
metrics. We found that Î± = 0.5, which gives
equal importance to both word and dependency
relations, is the optimal value that maximizes F-
measure on training and therefore we used this
value for the test data.

Finally, we evaluated all three alignments meth-
ods on the testing part of the Edinburg corpus. We
ran paired t-tests on the alignment performances
(w-OPT against GRD, and QAP against w-OPT).
We found QAP results to be statistically signifi-
cantly better than w-OPT (p < 0.0001), and w-
OPT to be significantly statistically better than
GRD (0.005 > p > 0.0004) across all the seven
word metrics that we used.

We also ran t-tests between the results given by
our best word metric, LIN, and the other metrics.
We found the differences were not statistically dif-
ferent, except on the LSA metric (p = 0.0281),
and RES (p < 0.0001).

Table 2 shows comparative performance results
for all three alignment methods on only two word
metrics, LIN and JCN, for space reasons, and QAP
comparative results for all the other word metrics,
along with the METEOR alignment results.

It should be noted that the results reported by
Thadani et al. (2012) consider phrase-level align-
ment and therefore their results are not directly
comparable to ours. They report results slightly
worse than METEOR on precision (âˆ’5%) and
considerably better on recall (+10%). For our
case, we found that the QAP method is consis-
tently better than METEOR, in terms of all mea-
sures, on all the word metrics except RES, which

although gives best precision, it is highly penal-
ized on recall.

5 Discussion and Conclusions

We proposed in this paper a novel approach to the
task of aligning monolingual texts in the context
of semantic similarity tasks based on an efficient
branch and bound approach. We showed that our
optimal solution provides state-of-the-art perfor-
mance. Although the proposed method is compu-
tationally more expensive, it consistently outper-
forms other alignment methods and provides opti-
mal solutions for sentences of average size ( < 40
words). The proposed QAP solution can be useful
for a number of tasks such as semantic similarity
assessment and phrase level semantic equivalence
extraction and in many applications such as intel-
ligent tutoring systems, question answering, and
automated essay scoring.
