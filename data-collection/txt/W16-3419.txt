Abstract 

Despite the increased quality of Machine Translation output, human interaction will remain a 
crucial activity to guarantee the quality of the final translation products. Human-computer 
interaction in translation will likely be the more successful the more we understand the properties 
and complementarities of both partners. This paper traces cognitive approaches in machine 
translation back to the mid-1980s and argues that we now have the technologies available that will 
allow us to eventually arrive at an in-depth understanding of the human translation processes. It 
illustrates some of the research methods in empirical translation process research and suggests 
ngrams of Activity Units for measuring the translation process. 

1. Introduction 

As a reaction to the then predominant rule-based translation paradigm, Nagao (1984) 
suggests a cognitive approach to translation, which mimics the human translation 
process. He states that “[m]an does not translate a simple sentence by doing deep 
linguistic analysis, rather, [...] first, by properly decomposing an input sentence into 
certain fragmental phrases ..., then by translating these phrases into other language 
phrases, and finally by properly composing these fragmental translations into one long 
sentence.” Based on this model, a large number of different example-based MT (EBMT) 
systems have been developed, which Carl and Way (2003) classify into: 

 Pure EBMT: All translation relevant processing takes place at run-time 
 Generalizing EBMT: preprocessing of translation templates 
 Tree-based EBMT: preprocessing of dependency and phrase-structure trees 

As a simulation of the human translation process, and in line with many earlier 
models of the human translation process (e.g. Nida, 1964), these systems assume that 
translators proceed: 



332  Schaeffer et al. 
 

• Sequentially, in a sentence-by-sentence (or phrase-by-phrase) mode 
• Stratificationally, by decomposing – transferring – recomposing 

Figure 1 visualises sequences of activities as hypothesized by Nagao's model as 
successive activities of reading “certain fragmental phrases” of source text words, 
followed by typing of the corresponding string of TT words. Figure 1 shows such a 
scenario on the basis of artificial data. The translation progression graph plots the 
English source text (“the awareness of other hospital staff put a stop”) on the left vertical 
axis and its Spanish translation (“la atencion de otros empleados del hospital puso fin”) 
on the right side. The horizontal axis represents a time line on which the translator's 
activities, such as keystrokes (black), fixations on words in the source text (blue dots) 
and words in the target text (green diamonds) are plotted. Figure 1 shows an almost 
linear fragmented translation production with a 1-to-2 alignment (hospital → del 
hospital) and a 2-to-1 translation alignment (a stop → fin) and a syntactic re-ordering 
(hospital staff → empleados del hospital).  

 
Translation process research in the past years suggests that translation processes only 

exceptionally take place in such a linear manner, whereas often iterative and concurrent 
processes can be observed. However none of the EBMT systems, and for that matter of 
MT systems in general, are based on actual empirical investigations of the human 
translation process. The sequential and stratificational nature of the (human) translation 
and post-editing processes is just taken for granted.  

In this paper we present novel methods to analyse empirical translation process data 
which suggests a more complex picture of the translation process. We look at pauses 
during typing activity, which have been taken as indicators of cognitive effort in 
translation and post-editing (Jakobsen, 1998, O'Brien, 2006). On a large data set which

sequential / stratificational model of the human translation process.

was collected in various studies over the past 8 years1,  we compute the pause-word ratio 
(PWR, Lacruz et al. 2014) which aims at measuring translation difficulties based on the 
pausing and typing structure. We examine 2101 English → Danish, Spanish, German, 
Chinese and Japanese translations segments and 1783 English → Spanish, German, 
Chinese and Japanese post-editing segments, which are extracted from the KTHJ08, 
BML12, SG12, MS12, ENJA15 and NJ12 studies in the TPR-DB which were produced 
by 147 different translators with different degrees of translation expertise.  

We show that the PWR correlates with a gaze based translation difficult index (TDI) 
introduced by Mishra et al (2013).  Then we suggest Activity Units as a means to 
analyse in more detail gazing behaviour during text production pauses. 

2.  The Pause-Word Ratio 

A central question in translation and in MT post-editing is related to measuring the 
cognitive effort involved in the translation production. Lacruz et al. (2014) observe that 
post-editors proceed in sequences of typing activities interrupted by relatively short 
pauses, between 300 ms and 2,000ms. Consequently, these authors develop the pause-to-
word ratio (PWR), based on the assumption that pauses between keystrokes provide 
information on cognitive effort, where higher PWR values are associated with more 
cognitive effort.  

 

 
 
Figure 2 plots a translation progression graph in which a translator produces the 

translation of English "the awareness of other hospital staff" into Spanish "la atención de 
otros empleados del hospital"; it shows the distribution of the keystrokes within a

Carl et al (2016) provides a comprehensive introduction to the database and its features. 

 

Figure 2. Translation Keystrokes in time 



334  Schaeffer et al. 
 

sequence of approximately 6.7 seconds in which the Spanish translation "otros 
empleados" (other staff) is typed. There are three longer pauses of approximately 940 ms 
between the typing of "o" and "t", a pause of 3.8 seconds between the typing of "t" and 
"r" and a pause of 530 ms between typing "r" and "os empleados". All other inter-
keystrokes intervals amount to less than 300 ms.  

Sequences of successive keystrokes can be fragmented into segments of coherent text 
production (i.e. typing bursts), where each production contains at least one keystroke.  

The length and duration of a production P depends on the gap of time G between two 
successive keystrokes: a Production Unit Pi ends if the gap between the last keystroke in 
Pi and the first keystroke in Pi+1 exceeds a pre-defined threshold T. The keystrokes of an 
entire translation session are thus fragmented into successive gaps Gi and typing bursts 
Pi. 

The session initial first gap G1 can be shorter than the threshold T. A production P 
contributes to the production of one target text segment TS, and each keystroke Kk in P 
contributes to exactly one word within the TS. If two successive keystrokes Kk and Kk+1 
are part of two segments TSt and TSt+1, a unit boundary is inserted so that Kk is the last 
keystroke in Pi and Kk+1 is the first keystroke in Pi+1 even if the gap Gk+1 between Kk and 
Kk+1 is shorter than the threshold T. Pi will be part for the production of segment TSt and 
Pi+1 will be considered part for the production of segment TSt+1. The production of a 
segment TS is thus made up of p units  {G1 , P1} ... {Gp , Pp}. The revision of a segment 
can lead to non-consecutive typing activities. For instance, a first draft of a segment TSt 
may be produced with units {G1 , P1} ... {Gm , Pm} and a revision of that segment is done 
at a later stage with units {Gn+1 , Pn+1} ... {Gp , Pp} while units {Gm+1 , Pm+1} ... {Gn , Pn} 
are part of one or more other segments. The segment TSt is thus edited twice. The 
following features are thus computed for each segment TS: 

 SegInitialGap: duration of the first gap durations G1 in TS 
 ProductionGap: sum of the gap durations G2 to gap Gp 
 ProductionDur: sum of the production durations P1 … Pp 
 Duration: production duration of the segment (sum of P and G) 
 ProductionNum: number 'p' of units {G,P} in TS 
 Nedit: number of revisions of the segment  

The above definitions lead to the following equation: 
 Duration = SegInitialGap + ProductionDur + ProductionGap 

In addition, the ProductionDur and the ProductionGap are segmented differently 
according to a thresholds T. Five different thresholds are currently implemented in the 
TPR-DB, which lead to different values of the *dur, *gap, and *num features,  as shown 
in the Table 1. 

Different thresholds segment the keystroke data in different ways, but the translation 
duration remains the same. That is, the sum of ProductionDuration + ProductionGap is 
identical irrespectively of the thresholds. Thus: 

 
  Mdur+Mgap = Sdur+Sgap = Pdur+Pgap = Ldur+Lgap = Kdur+Kgap

K-Unit 5000ms Kdur, Kgap, Knum PWR5000 = Kgap / #ST tokens  

 
 
3.  The translation difficulty index (TDI) 

Mishra et al (2013) develop a Translation Difficulty Index (TDI) which aims at 
predicting the effort during translation, measured in terms of the sum of ST and TT 
reading times (TDI score). They show that the TDI score correlates with the degree of 
polysemy, structural complexity and length of ST segments. They train a Support Vector 
Machine on observed eye movement data and predicted the TDI score of unseen data 
during translation on the basis of the linguistic features. 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

 The prediction was relatively accurate (MSE = 12.88), but to our knowledge, the TDI 
measure has not been tested on new data. In the next section we test the TDI score for its 
prediction of the PWR score. 

4.  Correlation of TDI and PWR 

The data used in Mishra et al (2013) were 80 English source sentences translated into 
Spanish, Danish and Hindi. For the current purpose we use 1476 English sentences 
translated into Spanish, Danish, Hindi, Chinese, German and Japanese which is a subset 

 

Figure 3. Plot of the effect of TDI on (log) PWR 



336  Schaeffer et al. 
 

of the 2101 segments mentioned in the itroduction (segments with PWR=0 were 
excluded). These segments include the 80 sentences used by Mishra et al. 

For all the analyses in the present study, R (R Development Core Team, 2014) and 
the lme4 (Bates et al 2014) and languageR (Baayen, 2013) packages were used to 
perform linear mixed-effects models (LMEMs). To test for significance, the R package 
lmerTest (Kuznetsova, Christensen, and Brockhoff, 2014) was used. 

The LMEM for experiment 1 had the following random variables: item, participant, 
text and target language. PWR was log transformed because it was not normally 
distributed. The predictor was the TDI score. TDI had a significant  (β=0.056, SE=0.026, 
t=2.137, p< .05) positive effect on the PWR with a pause threshold of 5000ms (see 
Table 1). 

This result validates the TDI as a good predictor of translation effort and it also 
validates PWR as a good measure of effort during translation and post-editing (Lacruz et 
al 2014). However, it does not explain what exactly happens during the pauses.  

 
 

5. Activity Units 

The PWR analysis does not explain what happens within the pauses and the TDI score 
does not differentiate when a translator is looking where on the source or target texts. As 

 
 

Figure 4. Translation segment of Fig. 1 with keystrokes and fixation data 
 

eye movements are independent from finger movements, there exist several kinds of 
sequential or concurrent gazing and typing activities which – as we will show - carry 
important information. As an illustration consider Figure 4 which is a replication of 
Figure 2 and which shows two typing bursts “ot” and “ros empleados” (in dashed boxes, 
as generated by the 1000ms threshold). The two Production Units are separated by a 3.8 
sec typing pause. The translation progression graph shows, in addition, the gaze 
behaviour as the eyes move back and forth between the source text (blue dots) and the 
target window (green diamonds). While the PWR takes into account the pausing 



 Measuring Cognitive Translation Effort with Activity Units  337 
 

information, TDI would predict the sum of the gaze durations. However, both measures 
ignore how the eyes move across the texts and how the eyes and hands are coordinated: 
there are concurrent gaze activities on the source or the target text during text production 
and sequential stretches of source or target reading during the typing pauses, of different 
length and location. For instance, when typing “ot”, the translator monitors the 
production of “o” in the target text and gazes at the  source text while typing “t”.  
 

 
Figure 5. Translation segment of Fig. 4 segmented into ten successive Activity Units 

 
In contrast to the PWR and TDI metrics, Activity Units take this information into 

account. Similar to (Carl et al, 2016) we make a distinction between 6 different basic 
types of activities2: 

 type 1: ST reading 
 type 2: TT reading 
 type 4: translation typing (no gaze data recorded) 
 type 5: ST reading and typing (touch typing) 
 type 6: TT reading and typing (translation monitoring) 
 type 8: no gaze or typing activity recorded for more than 5 seconds 

Figure 5 shows the segmentation of the same data into Activity Units. As can be 
seen, taking into account the gaze activities allows for a much finer-grained 
fragmentation of the data into the six types of activity. The first activity in Figure 5 
consists of concurrent TT reading (gaze on the translation of word 104) while typing "o", 
the first letter of the translation for ST word 105 (type 6). In the following typing pause 
of 940 ms, the eyes first hover over the beginning of the translation of ST words 105 (i.e. 
the just typed "o") and the translation of word 103 (atención). 

 
 

                                                 

2 The Activity Unit of type 7, as suggested in (Carl et al, 2016), which entails concurrent type 1, 2 
and 4 behaviour is not assumed here. Instead the activities were split into the six types above.

This TT reading activity (type 2) is followed by ST reading (type 1) of word 106 

(hospital) and 105 (other). The gaze then remains on the source text while "t" is typed 
which is an activity of type 5. After this, the long pause of 3.7 seconds is structured into 
five alternating Activity Units of type 2-1-2-1-2 in which the translator seems to develop

and check a translation strategy for the following noun phrase before, in an activity of 
concurrent typing and TT monitoring (type 6), "ros empleados" is produced without 
much hesitation. For each Activity Unit, a number of features are extracted, most of 
which relate to gaze patterns: 
 Dur: is the duration in ms of the Activity Unit. 
 nKey: count of the keystrokes during the Activity Unit.  
 nFix: number of fixations in the Activity Unit. 
 DFix: number of different words fixated.  
 ScSpan: span of the gaze path calculated as difference between largest and smallest 

word 
 Turn: moves from regression to progression or vice versa.  
 SD: standard deviation of median word fixations.  

The features DFix, ScSpan, Turn and SD  describe the linearity of the sequence of 
fixations in an Activity Unit for which eye movements have been recorded (type 1,2,5 or 
6). If DFix equals nFix, then each word within an Activity Unit has only been fixated 
once. A large ScSpan (scanpath span) occurs if long stretches of text are read, and when 
the distance between fixated words is large, as indexed by the sequential numbering of 
words. SD  is 0 if only one word is fixated. It becomes larger the more words are fixated 
far away from the median fixated word in a scanpath. 

Table 2 shows the extracted features for the 10 units in Figure 5. It shows the starting 
time and the duration of each of the Activity Units together with the six extracted 
features. 

 
Table 4. Frequency distributions of  bigrams 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Correlations between Dur, nFix, DFix, ScSpan, Turn and SD  are relatively high – 
the longer a coherent reading activity is (Dur), the more likely it is that more different 
words are fixated (DFix), resulting in a larger ScSpan. It is also more likely that 
progressions and regressions occur (higher Turn) (see Table 3). 

6.  Sequences of Activity Units 

Martínez-Gómez et al. (2014) cluster sequences of translation events and find that 
concurrent reading and translation typing correlates with translator experience; i.e.  
experienced translators are better able to distribute their attention on ST reading and TT 
production. We investigate ngrams (bigrams and trigrams) of Activity Units to assess  
fluent translation production and the typical gazing patterns during effortful translation 
production.

340  Schaeffer et al. 
 

 

  

 
The same data as the one used above was used in this experiment. However, rather 

than using complete segments, we extract all bigrams and trigrams of Activity Units 
from the translation drafting phase (Jakobsen 2002) which start with type 1 (ST reading). 
This resulted in 30,803 Activity Unit bigrams. The three bigrams shown in Table 4 made 
up more than 99% of the data. Other bigrams (1_4 and 1_8) had a frequency of less than 
0.01 and were excluded. 

The LMEM for experiment 2 had the following random variables: participant, text 
and target language. The predictor was the ngram and all of the scanpath measures 
described above in Table 3 and as measured on the Activity Units of type 1, were 
entered as dependent variables of the LMEMs. Sliding contrasts were applied to the 
bigrams. As all scanpath measures correlate, results for the other measures were very 
similar in size and significance. 

There is no significant difference in the duration of Activity Units type 1 followed by 
either type 5 or 6. However, the difference in Dur between bigrams 1_2 and 1_6 was 
highly significant. 

Similarly, the standard deviation (SD) from  the median word fixation within a 
scanpath in an Activity Unit of type 1 is lower  if the subseqent activity consists of 
typing. The difference in the SD value of Activity Units of type 1 followed by type 5 as 
compared to those followed by type 6 was relatively small, but highly significant (β = 
0.61, SE= 0.14, t= 4.28, p< .001). However, the difference between the SD  of Activity 
Units of type 1 followed by those of type 2 was much larger as compared to those which 
were followed by Activity Units of type 6 (β = 1.66, SE= 0.14, t= 11.99, p< .001). 

This suggests that the longer and the less linear a scanpath on the ST is, the more 
likely it is that translators will read the TT immediately after reading the ST. And 
conversely, the shorter and the more linear a scan path on the ST the more likely it is that 
translators will start typing immediately after reading the ST.

7.  Trigrams of Activity Units 
 
The duration and scanpath linearity of Activity Unit 1 has only an effect on the 

subsequent activity but not on later units: Trigrams showed a very similar picture to 
those  in  bigrams. The  frequency distribution of  trigrams  is shown in Table 5 (trigrams 

 
Table 5: Frequency distributions of Activity Unit trigrams in translation 

 

 
which occurred with a frequency of 4% or less were excluded). Sliding contrasts were 
applied to the trigrams. There was no significant difference in the SD  of Activity Units 
type 1 for trigrams 1_5_1 and 1_5_6. The difference between trigrams 1_5_2 and 1_5_1 
was not significant either. The difference between trigrams 1_6_2 and 1_5_2 was 
significant (β = 0.83, SE= 0.28, t= 2.97, p< .01). The difference between trigrams 1_2_6 
and 1_6_2 was highly significant and relatively large (β = 1.41, SE = 0.19, t=7.53, 
p< .001). The difference between trigrams 1_2_1 and 1_2_6 was also highly significant, 
but smaller (β =0.64, SE = 0.16, t=4.06, p< .001). The effect on Dur and all other 
scanpath measures was similar in size and significance, but, more importantly: trigrams 
containing typing activity in the second place were associated with more linear scanpaths 
of the initial activity type 1. 

Properties of Activity Units of type 1 is therefore restricted to the immediately 
following Activity Units  but has no effect on later activities.

While the previous sections looked at translational behaviour in from-scratch translation, 
in this section we look into post-editing behaviour. For this investigation we examine all 
2101 translations segments and 1783 post-editing segments, as described in the 
introduction.

translation, indicating a lower cognitive load according to the PWR metric.

(Chinese, Japanese, Hindi), although the graphs do not take into account the 
expertise of the translators.

Activity Unit of type 1 during post-editing go to unit of type 2. That is almost 
twice as much as during translation (see Table 4, which is reproduced for 
conveniance in Table 6 as column Freq-T). Only in 18% of the cases do post-
editors engage in a typing activity after ST reading, as compared to 54% in the 
translation condition. This suggest that much more reading back-and forth 
between ST and TT takes place during post-editing than during translation. 

 
3.  However, it is interesting to note that the relationship between the duration of the 

ST scanpath and subsequent Activity Units (typing or TT reading) is similar in 
both translation and post-editing. After an ST reading activity of around 2.5 
seconds, translators as well as post-editors are likely to switch to TT reading 
(Type 2) while for shorter ST reading activities of about 1,5 to 2 seconds, both 
translators and post-editors are more likely to engage in TT typing.  

9.  Conclusion 

Much of recent investigations in translation process research has sought to identify 
characteristics of either the ST or the TT in order to predict how difficult it is to process 
or produce a string of words during translation or post-editing (e.g. O’Brien 2005, 
Dragsted 2012, Alves and Gonçalves 2013, Schaeffer et al 2016). Lacruz et al (2014) 
take a different approach and associate pauses in the translation production process (i.e. 
gaps in typing activities) with cognitive meta-activity. In this paper we investigate the 
gazing patterns that take place during keystroke pauses to assess what happens during 
typing pauses that makes translation more or less effortful. Recorded gaze data fills the 
typing pauses and make it possible to "identify the specific motivation of a particular 
pause" (Kumpulainen, 2015: p 47). Our research shows that translation processes are 
much less sequential, (sentence-by-sentence, chunk-by-chunk) and much less 
stratificational than predicted by earlier translation models (e.g. Nagao, 1984). Rather, 
we observe iterative translation and revision processes and gazing patterns which 
indicate earlier and later translation processes (Schaeffer et al, 2016). While there is a 
substantially higher amount of iteration from ST reading to TT reading during post-
editing than during translation, the basic behavioural pattern seems to be similar:

editors are likely to read the TT
