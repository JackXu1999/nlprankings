Abstract
Ambient Assisted Living aims at providing assistance by allow-
ing people with special needs to perform tasks which they have
increasing difficulty with and to provide reassurance through
surveillance in order to detect distress and accidental falls.
Aged people are among the ones who might benefit from ad-
vances in ICT to live as long as possible in their own home.
Voice-base smart home is a promising way to provide AAL, but
even mature technologies must be evaluated from the perspec-
tive of its potential beneficiaries. In this paper, we investigate
which characteristics of the ageing voice that challenge a state
of the art ASR system. Though in the literature, chronological
age is retained as the sole factor predicting decrease in perfor-
mance, we show that degree of loss of autonomy is even more
correlated to ASR performance.

1. INTRODUCTION
With advances in medicine, life expectancy has increased.
However, this phenomenon coupled with a low birthrate has led
to an ageing population in industrialised countries. To help el-
derly people to live as long as possible in their home, solutions
have been developed based on robotics, automation, cognitive
science, and computer networks. These solutions are being de-
veloped to compensate their possible physical or mental decline
to keep them with a good degree of autonomy. The aim is to
provide assistance by allowing them to perform tasks which
they have increasing difficulty with and to provide reassurance
through surveillance in order to detect distress and accidental
falls. Such a system must allow independence of elderly while
facilitating social contact, with a major impact on well-being
and health. In addition, it helps caregivers and reassure rela-
tives. However, technological solutions must be able to adapt to
the needs and the specific capacities of this population. Indeed,
elderly are often confused by complex interfaces of devices.
Therefore, the usual interfaces (remote controls, mice or key-
boards) must be complemented by more accessible and natural
interfaces such as a system of Automatic Speech Recognition
(ASR) [1].

In this context, the CIRDO project1 wherein the authors
take part aims to promote autonomy and support of elderly peo-
ple by caregivers through a social inclusion product. The ob-
jective of the project is to integrate an ASR system into this
product to perform detection of distress situations, distress calls
and voice commands. Such kind of voice based interaction
is an emerging feature of many AAL related research projects
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6] but this remains a very challenging area due to the

1http://liris.cnrs.fr/cirdo/

atypical nature of the application (distant speech, aged people,
noise, uncontrolled area, multi-speaker, etc.) [7].

One of the main challenges in this domain is to make sure
that the ASR performance will be good enough to deliver a
high quality voice order recognition system. This is a fear of
the elderly population who are inclined to switch the system
off if it has difficulties in understanding them. Most of the
deployed ASR systems have reached a very good recognition
rate in close, noise free talking, but their performances were
rarely assessed with aged or children voice. A few studies com-
pared ageing voice vs. non-ageing voice on ASR performance
[8, 9, 10, 11], but their fields was quite far from our topic of
home automation commands recognition. Moreover, an issue
for our work was the non-existence of a speech corpus in French
containing distress signals and automation commands.

The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of
ageing voice on the ASR system performance and to find out
which people characteristics might serve to predict ASR per-
formance. The method we used is detailed in Section 3 after
having discussed the related work in Section 2. Then the results
of the evaluation are presented in Section 4 and an outlook on
further work is given Section 5.

2. RELATED WORK
The perception of voice alteration with age has been the subject
of many studies [12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. Elderly speakers are char-
acterized by tremors, hesitations, imprecise production of con-
sonants, broken voice, and slower articulation [13]. Regarding
women, the changes seem partly due to an increase of the vo-
cal cords mass due to some changing levels of certain hormones
[17]. Regarding men, perception of gasp come from an incom-
plete closure of the vocal cords that would be compensated by
an increasing tension in larynx [18]. From the anatomical point
of view, some studies have shown age-related degeneration with
atrophy of vocal cords, calcification of laryngeal cartilages, and
changes in muscles of larynx [19, 20].

Some studies have shown a significant increase in the stan-
dard deviation measures of the fundamental frequency of el-
derly, both men and women [21, 16, 15]. Stability of the fun-
damental frequency (F0) is reduced in elderly voice [12] and
is associated with variability in the peak-to-peak amplitude of
speech signal. Hesitations and gasping in pathological voices
have been associated with increased noise in the speech signal
driven by an aperiodic vibration of the vocal cords [22, 23].
Some measures of the ratio between noise energy and harmon-
ics have quantified this phenomenon by comparing older and
younger speakers [21, 24]. Incomplete closure of vocal cords
was observed during vocalisation [14]. The study cited above
[12] confirms fundamental frequency instabilities and the in-
creasing noise on both sexes for healthy people with an average

9



age of 70. These studies show that aged voice presents a much
greater variability than typical voice. Ability of state-of-the-
art ASR systems to handle this kind of population can thus be
questioned.

A more general study of Gorham-Rowan and Laures-Gore
[12] highlights the effects of ageing on the speech utterance and
the consequences on the speech recognition. The experiments
carried out in automatic speech recognition have shown perfor-
mance degradation for “atypical” population such as children
or elderly people [25, 10, 26] and have shown the interests of
an adaptation to the target populations [27, 26]. Speech recog-
nition adapted to the voice of elderly people is still an under-
explored area. The relevant languages are mainly English [10]
and Asian languages such as Japanese [8]. A very interest-
ing study [10] used some recordings of speeches delivered in
the Supreme Court of the United States over a decade. These
recordings are particularly interesting because they were used
to study the evolution of recognition performance on the same
person depending on his age over 7-8 years. These studies show
that the performance of recognition systems decreases steadily
with age, and that a special adaptation to each speaker can get
closer to the scores obtained from the youngest speakers with-
out adaptation. The implicit consequence is that the recogni-
tion system is adapted to a single speaker. To make the system
adapted to the person, Renouard et al. [28] proposed to use the
recognized words to adapt online the recognition models. Pro-
posed in the context of home assistance, this research does not
appear to have been pursued.

From an applicative point of view in the smart home
context, speech recognition has been mainly implemented
marginally in the field of voice commands in English. Indeed,
most current studies use conventional sensors (presence sensor,
door contact, etc.) and tactile interfaces (remote controls, hand-
set, touch-screens) more reliable but less natural, offering fewer
opportunities for interaction and comfort (for example: need to
walk to reach the remote device). Among the advances in the
field of voice controlled devices, a study conducted by Ander-
son [27] showed that a voice interface which is adapted (mod-
els acquired on 300 elderly speakers) allows to make voice re-
quests on computer with the same performance than a query
typed at the keyboard. This study has also revealed that only
2 of the 37 participants preferred the keyboard compared to the
voice interface. In the same field, Kumiko [29] proposed a com-
puter voice command interface that takes into account the possi-
ble sources of error (duration, intensity, vocabulary) to improve
performance and feedback. While Interactive Voice Response
is a pervasive component of today’s telephone communication,
some of which take into account the different voice population
[30], voice control in smart home is clearly in its infancy. A
large number of issues, such as noisy environment, number of
sound sources (for example: several people), vocabulary cover-
age, coverage of speakers, etc. still need to be addressed [7].
Recently, Moir and Filho [31] proposed a low-coverage system
using adaptive filters for a good recognition of keywords. But
this research remains still exploratory.

To the best of our knowledge, no application of voice con-
trol in smart home has explicitly considered the problem of
voice recognition of French elderly speakers, even though ma-
jor advances in terms of ergonomics, safety and data acquisi-
tion with high semantic value can be made by this modality.
From this short literature review, it can be emphasized that no
study had considered French aged voice in smart home condi-
tion. Moreover, most studies considered the chronological age
as global explanatory factor while many other effects can also

be responsible for ASR performance degradation as raised by
[11]. There is thus no certainty that age can predict the relia-
bility of a voice-based control system. That is why our study
includes an evaluation from the dependence perspective.

3. METHOD
To assess the impact of the ageing voice on ASR performance,
we started by acquiring a corpus targeted to the elderly popula-
tion. From this corpus and a non-aged one, the first task was to
identify the most problematic phonemes and to check whether
standard adaptation can be employed to reduce the discrepancy
between aged and non-aged speakers at phoneme level. Once
adapted, the second task was to assess whether measures other
than strictly chronological age can explain ASR performance
degradation.

3.1. Corpus collection

The corpus collection was performed sporadically from 2009
to 2012 in collaboration with a rehabilitation centre, volunteers
and a nursing home. Targeted speakers were persons aged of
more than 60 years old, able to read and with no mental disorder
or pathologies altering the voice. The recording was done with
a single microphone positioned about 30 cm from the speaker’s
mouth. Most speakers were sat, but some were in a wheelchair
or laying in a bed. The recording was done using a computer
and a home made software to prompt sentences to be read by the
speaker and to record the utterances using voice activity detec-
tion. Given the targeted application (in-home voice commands
and distress calls) the participants were requested to read a list
of short distress/home automation and casual sentences such as
Aidez-moi (Help me) or Il fait beau (It’s sunny). Based on [32],
who interviewed elderly people in nursing homes to identify
and describe what situations of distress they could have experi-
enced, we created a list of home automation orders the person
could utter during a distress situation to request for assistance.
Ten samples of each kind are given in Table 1.

The non-aged corpus was previously recorded in our labo-
ratory in 2004 and was complemented in 2013 with sentences
based on [32]. The procedure was similar to the aged corpus
acquisition.

This aged and non-aged corpus is called the AD corpus
(Anodin-Détresse: anodin means colloquial and détresse means
distress).

Finally, another aged corpus, the ERES38 corpus (Entre-
tiens RESidences 38: Entretiens means interviews) was ac-
quired for model adaptation purpose. This corpus was recorded
in 2011 in the living place of the person. During the interviews,
we requested each speaker to read a text but they were also
asked to talk freely about their life. The text was an article
about gardening created by the experimenters in order to target
phoneme issues reported in [9, 33].

All the corpora were annotated at the sentence level using
the Transcriber software.

3.2. ASR system

The ASR toolkit chosen in our study was Sphinx3 [34]. This
decoder used a context-dependent acoustic model with 3-state
left-to-right HMM. The acoustic vectors are composed of 13
MFCC coefficients, the delta and the delta delta of each co-
efficient. This HMM-based context-dependent acoustic model
was trained on the BREF120 corpus [35] which is composed
of about 100 hours of annotated speech from 120 non-elderly

French speakers. We called it the generic acoustic model.

3.3. Language model

A general language model (LM) was estimated from the French
Gigaword corpus which is a archive of newswire text data that
has been acquired over several years by the Linguistic Data
Consortium (LDC) at the University of Pennsylvania2. It was
1-gram with 11018 words. Moreover, to reduce the linguistic
variability, a 3-gram domain language model was learned from
the sentences used during the corpus collection described in
Section 3.1, with 88 1-gram, 193 2-gram and 223 3-gram mod-
els. Finally, the language model was a 3-gram-type which re-
sults from the combination of the general language model (with
a 10% weight) and the domain one (with 90% weight). This
combination has been shown as leading to the best WER for
domain specific application [36]. The interest of such combina-
tion is to bias the recognition towards the domain LM but when
the speaker deviates from the domain, the general LM makes it
possible to correctly recognise the utterances.

3.4. Word error rate and phoneme matching

The simplest and most common way to evaluate ASR perfor-
mances is to compute the Word Error Rate (WER). The WER
is computed by first aligning the output (the decoded speech)
with the reference (i.e., the ground truth) and then applying
WER = I+D+S

N
where I , D and S is the number of inser-

tions, deletion and substitution of words and N is the number
of words in the reference.

Though this measure was used in many related studies
[8, 10, 11], it does not indicate which specific phonemes play a
role in the ASR performance degradation. To do so, the anno-
tation should be performed at the phoneme level. However, this
is a very laborious and time-consuming task which furthermore
requires a good level of expert agreement. That is why we anal-
ysed the results of the forced alignments. The forced alignment
algorithm that was used is the one of Sphinx3.

Forced alignment consists in finding the boundaries of
phonemes in an utterance knowing the uttered sentence. This
sentence is mapped in phoneme (using a dictionary) which is
used to constrain an optimal alignment between the acoustic
model and the speech utterance. The forced alignment scores
are for each signal segment within a boundary, the likelihood of
belonging to a phoneme model. This score can be interpreted
as a proximity to the “standard” pronunciation, modelled by the

generic acoustic model. The differences in scores of phoneme
categories between the aged group and the non-aged group al-
low to identify which phonemes are the most difficult for the
ASR system. We are not aware of any study having used such
method to assess ASR performances.

Phonemes were grouped according to their highest level
catgories as shown in table 2.

3.5. Adaptation with MLLR

Once the phonemes are identified, the most common method
to overcome the ASR limitation is to apply speaker adaptation.
Speaker adaptation consists in generating a new acoustic model
from a generic one and some new annotated speech in limited
quantity. One of the most popular technique is to apply the
Maximum Likelihood Linear Regression (MLLR) which is par-
ticularly adapted when a limited amount of data per class is
available. MLLR is an adaptation technique that uses small
amounts of data to train a linear transform which warps the
Gaussian means so as to maximize the likelihood of the data.
The principle is that acoustically close classes are grouped and
transformed together.

3.6. Assessing the level of autonomy

Despite the acoustic adaptation, there might be a disparity be-
tween the WERs of the elderly group even in aged people of
the same age category. Therefore, we investigated other crite-
ria and focused on elderly dependence. As reference, we used
a French national test which is daily used in assessing the de-
gree of loss of autonomy: the AGGIR (Autonomie Gérontolo-

11



gie Groupes Iso-Ressources) grid3. The degree of autonomy
loss is evaluated in terms of physical and cognitive decline. Ac-
cording to the result of this test, the person can receive financial
support: the Personalized Allocation of Autonomy (APA). The
evaluation is done using 17 variables. Ten variables refer to the
loss of physical and cognitive autonomy: coherence, orienta-
tion, washing, feeding, disposal, transfers (to rise, to lie down,
to sit down), internal displacement, external displacement and
remote communication. Seven variables refer to the loss of do-
mestic and social autonomy: personal management of budget
and possessions, cooking, cleaning, transporting, purchasing,
treatment monitoring and past time activities. Each variable
is coded with A (independent), B (partially dependent) and C
(totally dependent). The GIR (Iso-Ressources Group) score is
computed from the variables to classify the person in one of the
six groups: GIR 1 (total dependence) to GIR 6 (total autonomy).

4. RESULTS
4.1. Collected Corpus

4.1.1. The AD80 French test corpus

The AD corpus (cf. 3.1) was acquired from 95 speakers (36 men
and 59 women) which are divided into two groups: the elderly
group composed of 43 speakers (11 men and 32 women), 62 to
94 years old, with 2796 distress and home automation sentences
for a duration of 1 hour 5 minutes, and 3006 casual sentences
for a duration of 1 hour 6 minutes, and the non-elderly group
composed of 52 speakers, 18 to 64 years old, with 3903 dis-
tress and home automation sentences for a duration of 1 hour
18 minutes, and 3897 casual sentences for a duration of 1 hour
12 minutes.

We fixed the limit of the non-aged group at 65 years old, but
we recorded 2 people aged 62 and 63 years old with autonomy
loss, looking very aged physically and living in nursing home.
Thus we included this two persons, as exceptions, in the aged
group.

For the 43 speakers of the aged AD corpus, a GIR score was
obtained after clinicians filled the AGGIR grid.

Finally, the AD corpus is made up of 13,602 annotated sen-
tences, with 4 hours and 42 minutes of recording.

4.1.2. Collection of the training ERES38 corpus

The ERES38 (cf. 3.1) corpus was acquired from 22 elderly peo-
ple (14 women and 8 men) between 68 and 98 years old. The
corpus included 48 minutes of read speeches (around 2 minutes
per speaker) and 17 hours of interviews. The speakers lived in
specialized institutes, such as nursing homes and were cogni-
tively intact without severe disabilities.

4.2. Phoneme distance between aged and non-aged voice

When performing ASR using the generic acoustic model on the
distress/home automation sentences of the AD corpus, we ob-
tained an average WER of 9.07% for the non-elderly group, and
an average WER of 43.47% for the elderly group. Thus, we
observed a significant performance degradation of ASR for el-
derly speech, with an absolute difference of 34.40%. Figure 1
represents the WER according to the chronological age for both
groups. It shows that the WER is globally higher for elderly
group as previous studies showed [8, 10, 11]. However, it can
also be seen that the variability between speakers also increases

3http://vosdroits.service-public.fr/F1229.xhtml

with the age. For instance, some 83 years old speakers have
their WER ranging from 13.6% to 80.2%. Standard deviation is
6% for the non-elderly group and 17.27% for the elderly group.
In other words, the WER is far less predictable in the elderly
group than in the non-elderly group. Consequently, we have to
deal with the fact that a speech recognition with such a system
can work very well with some of the elderly speakers, and very
badly with others.

Figure 2: Forced alignment scores by phonemes categories be-
fore adaptation

The relative differences of forced alignment scores ob-
served between both groups led to sort the phoneme categories
in descending order of differences: nasal vowels (-100,34%),
voiced plosives (-56,55%), unvoiced fricatives (-50,48%), un-
voiced plosives (-44,05%), nasal consonants (-41,03%), open
vowels (-37,12%), central vowels (-34,80%), voiced fricatives
(-31,30%), back vowels (-29,26%), semi-vowels (-29,18%), liq-
uids (-19,99%), and front vowels (-11,89%). The repartition of
French phonemes inside the different groups are presented in
Table 2.

For the elderly group, the alignment scores are lower than
those obtained for the non-elderly group especially for plo-
sives and nasal vowels. Based on the relative differences, the
phoneme categories most affected for elderly group are nasal
vowels, plosive consonants, unvoiced fricatives and nasal con-
sonants.

Figure 3: WER on aged group before and after adaptation

Figure 3 shows that using the MLLR adapted acoustic
model was able to reduce the WER significantly for all speak-
ers of the AD corpus. With the global MLLR adaptation us-
ing ERES38, the average WER was 14.52%. Compared to the
43.47% WER without adaptation (see Section 4.2), the abso-
lute difference was -28.95%. Furthermore, the speaker with the
worst performance had his error rate reduced from 80.2% to
44.9%, and the speaker with the best performance had his er-
ror rate reduced from 9% to 1.8%. Also, the standard deviation
was reduced from 17.27% to 10.34%, showing a reduction of
the variability between the speakers.

A comparison between the forced alignment scores ob-
tained for non-elderly without adaptation and for elderly after
adaptation using the ERES38 corpus is shown in Figure 4. On
the whole, the scores for the elderly after adaptation are better
than those of non-elderly with the generic acoustical model.

Figure 4: Forced alignment scores by phonemes categories for
non-elderly with the generic acoustical model and for elderly
after adaptation

Indeed, the use of an acoustical model adapted to elderly
people reduces the mismatching of phonemes. The alignment
scores of the adapted model presented in Figure 4 show that
the average distance has reduced below the non-aged one for all
phonemes except for unvoiced fricatives and nasal vowels.

From an applicative point of view, this test shows that
we can use a database of elderly speech in MLLR adaptation
with speakers which are different from the test database. Even
though the size of the corpus is small, we have a significant
improvement of WER. Furthermore, this demonstrates that the
voices of ageing people have common characteristics.

4.4. Influence of elderly dependence on ASR system

Despite the acoustic adaptation, there is a great variability be-
tween the WERs of the elderly group. Therefore, we inves-
tigated to establish if the level of elderly dependence can be
an indicator of the ASR performance for the elderly group.
Figure 5 shows a box-and-whisker diagram of the WER from
MLLR adaptation as a function of the elderly dependence. Four
speakers were in GIR 2, two speakers were in GIR 3, 21 speak-
ers were in GIR 4, one speaker was in GIR 5 and 15 speakers
were in GIR 6. No speaker was represented in GIR 1. Due to
the small number of speakers in GIR 2, GIR 3 and GIR 5, we
merged GIR 2 with GIR 3 and GIR 4 with GIR 5.

From Figure 5 it can be seen that WERs are different ac-
cording to the GIR category. Indeed, the WER averages for
GIR 2-3, GIR 4-5 and GIR 6 are respectively 25.2%, 13.2%
and 12.2%, and the WER standard deviations are respectively
16.8%, 8.4% and 7.6%. Then, we performed an ANOVA test
on the groups GIR 2-3, GIR 4-5 and GIR 6. From this test,
the GIR score have a significant effect on WER (F (2, 40) =
4.3; p < 0.05%).

We conducted a Bonferroni post-hoc analysis to character-
ize which groups were significantly different from other groups.
The post-hoc test highlighted that there was a significant differ-
ence between the GIR 2-3 group and both groups GIR 4-5 and
GIR 6, while there is no significant difference between GIR 4-5
and GIR-6.

5. CONCLUSION
The paper presents our study on the behavior of an ASR system
with elderly voices. Given the absence of a corpus containing
the voice of elderly in French language usable for testing ASR
system, we recorded the AD corpus. From this corpus, we ob-
served an increase of the average WER of the ASR system for
elderly people, with an absolute difference between non-elderly

13



and elderly voice of 34.4%. With forced alignment, we ana-
lyzed which phonemes for elderly speech were posing the most
problems to ASR systems. These results allowed us to proceed
to the recording of the ERES38 corpus, allowing us to adapt the
generic acoustic model to the voice of elderly people through
the MLLR adaptation method. The global MLLR adaptation
was interesting because with less than one hour of recordings
from speakers different from the test speakers, we obtained a
WER close to the case of recognition with the generic acoustic
model on non-elderly group, with a WER of 14.53%, against
43.47% before adaptation. Moreover, we showed that inside
the elderly group, the WER was not correlated with the age but
could be correlated with the level of dependence due to a gen-
eral physical degradation. The continuation of our work would
be to show how the different parameters of the AGGIR grid are
correlated to the WER. Therefore, predicting the ASR behavior
would allow in facilitating the use of these new technologies in
the daily life of the dependent elderly people.
