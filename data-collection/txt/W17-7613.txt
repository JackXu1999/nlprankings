Abstract 

 
The aim of this paper is to present a semiautomatic lemmatisation procedure implemented on database 

software that is compatible with the morphological tagging of treebanks. The language of analysis is Old 

English, for which parsed corpora are available but they are not lemmatised. The scope of the paper 

includes both strong and weak verbs. After describing the lemmatisation procedure, the paper discusses 

the results of automatic searches and compares them with the lists of inflectional forms by lemma provided 

by other lexicographical sources. The conclusions insist on the limits of automatic lemmatisation and the 

compatibility with treebank parsing. 

 

 

1 Introduction 
 

This paper deals with lemmatisation in a corpus of Old English and focuses on the seven classes of 

strong verbs, and classes 1 and 2 of weak verbs. The analysis reported here is based on the lemmatiser 

Norna, a building block of the lexical database of Old English Nerthus (www.nerthusproject.com). 

Norna, in turn, draws on the information available from the Dictionary of Old English Corpus (hearafter 

DOEC, Healey et al., 2004), the Helsinki Corpus (Rissanen et al., 1991), the York-Toronto-Helsinki 

Parsed Corpus of Old English Prose (Taylor et al., 2003) and the York-Helsinki Parsed Corpus of Old 

English Poetry (Pintzuk and Plug, 2001). Of these, only the York-Toronto-Helsinki Parsed Corpus of 

Old English Prose (Taylor et al., 2003) and the York-Helsinki Parsed Corpus of Old English Poetry 

(Pintzuk and Plug, 2001) are parsed. The parsing includes syntactic categories and functions as well as 

lexical and morphological tagging. For this reason, these corpora are commonly known as treebanks. In 

their current state, these treebanks are unlemmatised. That is to say, the attestations of the inflections of 

a given lemma are not related to the dictionary word, which results in a lower descriptive power, 

especially as regards paradigmatic analysis and the quantification of morphological and lexical aspects. 

 Moreover, the standard dictionaries of Old English, including An Anglo-Saxon Dictionary, A Concise 

Anglo-Saxon Dictionary and The student’s Dictionary of Anglo-Saxon, constitute valuable sources of 

philological data, although they are not based on an extensive corpus of the language but on the partial 

list of texts listed in their prefaces or introductions. On its part, The Dictionary of Old English 

(henceforth DOE) is based on the corpus mentioned above, but is still in progress (the letter H was 

published in 2016). All in all, neither the textual nor the lexicographical sources of Old English are fully 

lemmatised. At the same time, treebanks could improve their descriptive power and searchability by 

incorporating lemma tags. For these reasons, the aim of this paper is to present a semiautomatic 

lemmatisation procedure implemented on database software that is compatible with the morphological 

tagging of treebanks. The first step was to carry out a concordance of the texts that the Dictionary of 

Old English provides in its corpus. The concordance by word consists of three million lines, one per 

word in the corpus. The concordance by fragment, in contrast, contains around two hundred thousand 

fragments of texts identified with the short title with which they appear in the DOEC, as in Eala ðu 

cleric ne wana ðu æfre wexbreda fram sidan [Abbo 000100 (103.1)]. The target of the analysis is the 

data retrieved from the word concordance to the DOEC, which turns out an index of approximately one 

hundred and ninety thousand inflectional forms. Once the data has been identified and extracted from 

the concordance, the process of lemmatisation starts. The different types of verbs are lemmatised in turn, 

depending on their formal transparency. That is to say, strong verbs have been lemmatised in the first 

88



place and then weak verbs from the second class have been processed. The former can be identified by 

stem and inflectional ending, the latter by inflectional ending only, but their inflectional paradigm is 

more transparent that the one of the weak verbs from the first and the third class. Then, weak verbs from 

class 1 have been lemmatised. Weak class 3, anomalous, contracted and preterite-present verbs will be 

dealt with in further research. 

 

2 Lemmatisation procedure for strong verbs 
 

On the lemmatiser Norna, inflectional forms of strong verbs are assigned a lemma on the basis of a 

reference list of verbs from each strong class that has been retrieved from the lexical database Nerthus 

and supplemented with information from Krygier (1994) and Hogg and Fulk (2011). 

The second step in the process of lemmatisation in Norna has already been implemented for the seven 

classes of strong verbs of Old English. Query strings are defined and launched in the database, so that 

the results are compared with the existing sources, and the conclusions of such comparison are used to 

refine the query strings. 

After these query strings have been inputed to the lemmatiser, the assignments of lemmas to attestations 

are filed and compared with the lexicographical and philological sources, so that the feedback of 

previous searches is used to improve subsequent query strings. 

With this method, the design of the search algorithm is stepwise. The target of the first step is the simplex 

word. The underived verbs in the reference list of the seven strong classes have been inflected for the 

infinitive, inflected infinitive, present participle and past participle; present indicative singular and 

plural, present subjunctive singular and plural, preterite indicative singular and plural, preterite 

subjunctive singular and plural, imperative singular and plural. 

The second step in the creation of the algorithm is focused on the complex word. It consists on the 

compilation of a list of elements that may be attached to simplex strong verbs to form derived or 

compound verbs. Originally, the inventory of preverbal elements, retrieved from the lexical database of 

Old English Nerthus, includes affixes with a very specific meaning, such as the negative prefix un-, the 

pejorative prefix mis- as well as the aspectual prefixes eft- and ed-; the Germanic pure prefixes ā-, be-, 

for-, ge-, of-, on-, tō- (de la Cruz 1975); the spatial and temporal adverbs and prepositions that are going 

through grammaticalisation resulting in a telic marker (Brinton and Traugott 2005; Martín Arista and 

Cortés Rodríguez 2014), including adūn-, æfter-, æt-, āweg-, beforan-, betwux-, ðurh-, forð-, fore-, 

fram-, geond-, in-, niðer-, oð-, ofer-, onweg-, under-, ūp-, ūt-, wið-, wiðer-, and ymb-; and fully free 

forms that appear in compound verbs such as āgēn-, and-, ðri-, dyrn-, efen-, ful-, hearm-, mǣg-, mān-, 

nyd-, riht-, twi-, wyrg-. Having the preverbal elements, the roots and the set of inflections presented 

above, the third step in the design of the search algorithm is the definition of query strings that can be 

applied on Filemaker. Four query strings (QS) have been defined. QS1 is devoted to the stems and 

inflections by using the operator (wild card) for exact matches in Filemaker (==). The part of QS1 that 

searches the corpus for the inflections of bēodan can be seen in (1). 

 

(1) 

 

==beodan, ==bead, ==budon, ==beode, ==bead, ==biedest, ==biedst, ==bietst, ==biest, 

==bude, ==beodeð, ==beodeþ, ==biett, ==bietð, ==bietþ, ==bead, ==beodaþ, ==beodað, 

==budon, ==beode, ==bude, ==beoden, ==buden, ==beod, ==beodað, ==beodaþ 

 

The target of the second QS (QS2) is prefix ge-, the most frequent in Old English (Martín Arista 2012b), 

to such an extent that most strong verbs present a simplex and complex form prefixes with ge-. QS2 for 

gebēodan is shown in (2). 

 

(2) 

==gecimban, ==gecamb, ==gecumbon, ==gecumben, ==gecimbe, ==gecamb, ==gecimbst, 

==gecimbest, ==gecumbe, ==gecimbð, ==gecimbþ, ==gecimbeð, ==gecimbeþ, ==gecamb, 

==gecimbaþ, ==gecimbað, ==gecumbon, ==gecimbe, ==gecambe, ==gecimben, ==gecumben, 

==gecimb, ==gecimbaþ, ==gecimbað, ==gecimbanne, ==gecimbenne, ==gecimbende 

89



QS3 has been created for accounting the existence of complex strong verbs with preverbs different from 

ge-. The wild card (*) in (3) represents any preverbal elements attached to the base and its inflections. 

 

(3) 

==*beodan, ==*bead, ==*budon, ==*beode, ==*bead, ==*biedest, ==*biedst, ==*bietst, 

==*biest, ==*bude, ==*beodeð, ==*beodeþ, ==*biett, ==*bietð, ==*bietþ, ==*bead, 

==*beodaþ, ==*beodað, ==*budon, ==*beode, ==*bude, ==*beoden, ==*buden, ==*beod, 

==*beodað, ==*beodaþ 

 

QS4 is the least specific of all the query strings. It looks in the corpus for the stems of strong verbs with 

any preverbal element and inflectional ending, hence the addittion of the wild card (*) to both sides of 

the stem, as in (4). 

 

(4) 

==*beod*, ==*bead*, ==*bud*, ==*bod*, ==*bied*, ==*biet*, ==*biest* 

 

The previous query strings have been launched in a sequential manner: QS1, QS2, QS3, QS4. After the 

submission of each query, the resulting hits have been tagged on the lemmatiser Norna, with the result 

that the tags from previous queries could aid the tagging of the hits resulting from subsequent queries. 

This brings about a simplification of the overall task because, in spite of being likely to find some 

unexpected spellings, QS4 is redundant with respect to QS1 (endings), QS2 and QS3 (preverbs). 

Moreover, due to its wide scope, it is predictable that this query strings turns out a remarkably high 

number of results. For this, the final step in the design of this algorithm is the definition of filters to put 

aside at least part of the undesired results of QS4, so that manual revision can be diminished 

dramatically. 

Four filters have been designed for this purpose. Filter (F) 1 is intended to isolate verbal forms. It cuts 

down the hits of QS4 to inflectional forms that end with -odon-, -ast, -est, -ost, -ð, -þ, -iað and-iaþ, thus 

the operators == and *. The application of F1 to the 17,138 hits of SQ4 reduces this figure to 1,939. F1 

is presented in (5). 

 

(5) 

==*-on, ==*-odon-, ==*-ast, ==*-est, ==*-ost, ==*-ð, ==*-þ, ==*-iað, ==*-iaþ 

 

F2 is aimed at finding spelling variations in the consonantal endings of verbal forms. It is applied in two 

steps. The first selects the inflectional forms that end in a consonant, as can be seen in (6). 

 

(6)  

==*b, ==*c, ==*d, ==*f, ==*g, ==*h, ==*l, ==*m, ==*n, ==*p, ==*r, ==*s,  ==*t, ==*w, 

==*x, ==*y, ==*ð, ==*þ 

 

The second step of F2 targets members of the non-verbal classes as well as weak verbs by deleting 

inflectional forms that end in -on, -en, -an, -es, -um, -end, -as, -est, -ost, -ed, -od, -ig, -ic, -ing, -ung, -

un, -us, -nes, -er, -or, -ur, -iað, -iaþ. It must noted that F2 also puts aside the endings -iað, -iaþ, which 

are selected by F1. When applied to the outcome of SQ4, the first step of F2 reduces its hits from 17,138 

to 10,305, which, after the application of the second step of F2, result in 3,533 hits. The second step of 

F2 is displayed in (7). 

 

(7) 

==*on, ==*en, ==*an, ==*es, ==*um, ==*end, ==*as, ==*est, ==*ost, ==*ed,  ==*od, 

==*ig, ==*ic, ==*ing, ==*ung, ==*un, ==*us, ==*nes, ==*er, ==*or,  ==*ur, ==*iað, 

==*iaþ 

Turning to the comparison with lexicographical sources, the comparison with the inflectional forms 

provided by the DOE (A-H) has shown that the accuracy of the search algorithm is around 80%. 

As regards the comparison with textual sources, the lemmatiser Norna has been modified so that it gives 

access to the inflectional forms that appear both in the DOEC and the YCOE. 

90



A comparison of YCOE and the lemmatiser Norna has been carried out. As an illustration, for the letter 

L the forms in (8a) can be retrieved from the YCOE (165), while those in (8b) appear in Norna (148).

The discrepancies in the number of forms can be attributed to the compilations of the DOEC and the 

YCOE. An avenue of future research in this respect is the identification of forms in the YCOE that has 

been deleted in the different editions of the DOEC. Apart from this question, the search algorithm has 

to be modified to include, at least, three aspects: <g> followed by a front vowel in the same syllable, as 

is the case with ladigan, legde, legdun, legeð, lifige and lufige; <y> for <i> in accented syllables, as in 

lyfað and lyfde; -an/-un for -on in unaccented (inflectional) syllables, as in lægun and legdun. 

 

3 Lemmatisation procedure for weak verbs 
 

Weak verbs correspond to the modern ‘regular’ verbs. The changes in their inflection take place in the 

suffixal part of the word rather than in the stem, as is the case with strong verbs, counterparts of the 

modern ‘irregular verbs’. In order to find the inflectional forms of weak verbs in the database, it is 

necessary to list a set of inflectional endings of class 1 and class 2 weak verbs that includes the endings 

of finite forms (indicative, subjunctive and imperative) and non-finite forms (infinitive, inflected 

infinitive, present participle, past participle and past participle forms inflected as adjective). The choice 

of forms has been made by comparing Old English verbal paradigms of the three subclasses of weak 

verbs in four Old English grammars (Campbell, 1987; Hogg and Fulk, 2011; Sievers, 1903; Stark, 1992). 

The compilation of these inflectional endings will guide the automatic searches in subsequent steps of 

the analysis. The result of this task is an inventory of 24 different endings for the paradigm of class 1 

and 29 different endings for the paradigm of class 2.  

On the lemmatiser, the query strings for each of the endings selected are defined as follows: two equal 

signs followed by a wild card (an asterisk) and the spelling of the ending. Thus, we will obtain all 

inflectional forms in the database with the requested ending. For example, we use the query string 

==*ianne, the canonical inflectional ending of the inflected infinitive of class 2 weak verbs, and obtain 

160 inflectional forms included in the database, most of which are likely to be lemmatised under a 

lemma from the second weak class. We launch 24 different queries for the canonical endings of class 1 

weak verbs and another 29 for the counterparts of the second class of weak verbs. Then, all the hits are 

checked with the lists of weak verbs available in Nerthus. These lists of reference contain more than 

2,000 verbs each. To achieve the maximum degree of accuracy in the initial stages of the project, the 

91



criterion was to assign lemma only to combinations of stems of the weak verbs as they appear in the 

reference lists and canonical endings. 

The results of this lemmatisation process consist of more than 4,680 inflectional forms lemmatised with 

class 1 weak verbs and more than 6,600 inflectional forms for class 2 weak verbs. The lemmatisation of 

these forms provides paradigmatic information on weak verbs that can contribute to the development of 

treebanks, since lemmatisation relates the syntactic analysis of the inflectional forms that are lemmatised 

under the same headword, thus allowing for extensive descriptive analysis as well as quantification. For 

instance, the inflectional forms lemmatised in the database for class 2 weak verb lufian are the following: 

lufað, lufiað, lufode, lufige, lufast, lufie, lufaþ, lufodon, lufodest, lufiað, lufien,  lufigen, gelufiað, 

gelufode, gelufie, lufian, gelufod, lufianne, lufiende, lufienne, lufodes, lufiendum, lufodan, gelufoda,  

lufod, gelufian, gelufodes, gelufodne, lufoden. All these inflectional forms belong to different parts of 

the paradigm of the same lemma; therefore, lemmatisation is proved to be an effective tool for linking 

together syntactic analysis of a given lemma. In turn, we are able to take a look at all the inflectional 

forms for a given lemma with the click of a button, as shown in Figure 1. The two leftmost columns list 

the number of occurrences and the inflectional forms, and the column Headword shows the lemma 

assigned to them.  

 

 
Figure 1: Inflectional forms for the lemma langian(ge) (2) 'to grieve' in Norna. 

 

The lemmatisation of Old English weak verbs with this procedure needs checking. The DOE (A-H) is 

the lexicographical source used for this task. As stated above, this dictionary is still in progress but the 

information listed for verbs from A-H is detailed and central to this investigation. Through the online 

version of this dictionary, it is possible to search inflectional forms by lemma. For this reason, the 

lemmatiser Norna permits to compare the attested spellings for weak verbs from A to H with those that 

appear in the DOE. Many unpredictable spellings of weak verbs are available in the DOE that cannot 

be found by means of automatic lemmatisation, since most of them include spelling variations in 

prefixes, stems and endings. For instance, for the lemma bǣdan(ge) (1) ‘to force’, seven inflectional 

forms can be obtained by automatic lemmatisation: bædað, baedde, bædde, bæddon, bæde, bædeð, 

bæden. However, the DOE includes eight extra attested spellings in the entry to this verb: bæddan, 

baedendrae, baedendre, bædendre, bædendum, bædt, beadætþ and bedændræ. The feedback of previous 

searches are input into the database and used to refine subsequent searches, so that the amount of manual 

revision can be reduced.  

This task of comparison results in the identification of 12,000 extra inflectional forms for weak verbs, 

on the grounds of the information found in the DOE verb entries in the letters A-H. The analysis of these 

extra forms will allow to compile a list of the recurrent variants of canonical forms of weak verbs and, 

eventually, normalisations patterns (by prefix, stem or ending). This correspondence will be applied to 

92



the search for the inflectional forms of the verbs beginning with the letters I-Y. As illustration, the 

inflectional form aflemde is lemmatised under the headword āflyman (1) ‘to put to fly’ in the DOE. This 

change of vowel < e > ≈ < y > will be included in the normalisation patterns for the stem of the verbal 

form. Similarly, the DOE includes the inflectional form aredad in the paradigm of the lemma āredian 

(2) ‘to arrange’, which is a variant of aredod, the past participle form. This pattern <o> ≈ <a> is 

consequently added to the normalisation patterns taking place in the endings of the inflectional forms. 

In this context, the prefix of the inflectional form gifered from the lemma ferian(ge) (1) ‘to carry’ shows 

the recurrent pattern of variation <gi> ≈ <ge>, which is added to the list of normalisation patterns for 

the prefixal segment of the attested form. The application of these three types of patterns in the study of 

inflectional forms I-Y, with the same queries as in the search for the canonical endings of weak verbs, 

will undoubtedly lead to the lemmatisation of a larger number of inflectional forms for class 1 and class 

2 weak verbs and, more importantly, will result in the reduction of manual revision. 

The lemmatisation procedure has limitations that need to be taken into account. There are many 

unexpected spellings within the paradigms of weak verbs, not foreseeable abbreviations, as well as many 

ambiguities that can only be lemmatised with the help of dictionaries. Gemination and simplification of 

consonants are also recurrent in verbal forms, thus excluding the automatic lemmatisation of several 

inflectional forms. This is the case with cunedon, from cunnian(ge) (2) ‘to try’, which gets consonant 

simplification. In addition, and according to the DOE, some inflectional forms lemmatised with this 

method belong to different categories and to other verbs classes. The explanation for this phenomenon 

is the overlapping of endings among verbs, nouns, adjectives and adverbs, like the ending -e. The 

inflectional form dere was initially lemmatised under the lemma derian(ge) (1) ‘to hurt’, given that it 

includes the stem of a weak verb of the first class and one of the canonical endings of this class; but the 

comparison with the DOE showed that, in fact, dere is a nominal rather than a verbal form. Finally, the 

unpredictable forms auandod, from āfandian (2) ‘to test’, and hergendne, from erian (1) ‘to plough’, 

which are also available from the DOE, are hard to find by automatic means, at least in this stage of the 

project.  

 

4 Conclusion 
 

The lemmatisation procedure for the strong verbs of Old English presented in this paper has an accuracy 

of around 80% before manual revision. After checking the results with lexicographical and textual 

sources, search strings can be refined and manual revision reduced. The compatibility with treebanks 

has been addressed with respect to the YCOE. As for weak verbs, the lemmatisation procedure has 

allowed for the identification of more than 20,000 inflectional forms of weak verbs. However, the 

comparison with the DOE, as the main lexicographic source, has also proved a crucial step of the 

lemmatisation procedure because it turns out more inflectional forms but, above all, because it identifies 

recurrent spelling variants with which normalisation patterns can be defined and subsequent searches 

can be refined. The inclusion of additional patterns of normalisation and the gradual improvement of 

searches are likely not only to find more lemmas and inflectional forms but also to reduce the necessary 

amount of manual revision. In spite of the limitations of semiautomatic lemmatisation, this procedure 

has allowed us to find a large amount of inflectional forms from weak verbs in Old English.  

It will be necessary, therefore, to check the inflectional forms of the DOEC and the YCOE, but further 

guidelines for search strings have been obtained. To conclude, a step has been taken towards the 

inclusion of lemma tags into treebanks, which could reinforce the paradigmatic dimension of these 

parsed corpora and contribute to the retrievability of the information that they contain, including the 

important aspect of the quantification of the occurrences of a given lemma.
