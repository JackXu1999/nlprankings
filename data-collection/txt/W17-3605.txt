Abstract

In the present paper, semi-structured in-
terviews conducted on 7 Spanish speaking
Alzheimer-type Dementia patients and on 6
Spanish speaking adults with healthy aging
processes are examined. Rhetorical Struc-
ture Theory was used to analyze each of
the turns. The procedure involves the seg-
mentation of Semantic Dialog Units (SDU´s),
rhetorical relations labeling and the construc-
tion of tree diagrams. Preliminary results indi-
cate a marked difference in number of rhetoric
relations used by both our samples, in which
the relations of elaboration, concession, jus-
tify and restatement are the most frequently
used by Alzheimer-type dementia patients.

1 Introduction

Dementia of Alzheimer´s type (DAT) is a neurode-
generative disease in which at least three cognitive
spheres are affected: memory, agnosia and visuospa-
tial skills and language; hitherto, the only definite
diagnosis can be determined posmortem.

While linguistic deficits in each phase of demen-
tia have been studied for decades with the inten-
tion of identifying the linguistic phenomena which
can be significant for a possible diagnosis (Appell,
1982; Kemper, 1991; Emery, 2001), never until re-
cent years has proposal in the field of Natural Lan-
guage Processing (NLP) been dedicated to utilizing

the most frequent and useful linguistic deficits, so
that, with the help of computational analysis, viable
tools in identifying the disease at an early stage can
be created.

Thus, recent studies using automated or semiau-
tomated identification have relied on different lin-
guistic criteria such a lexical clues (Bucks et al.,
2010; Asgari, Kaye and Dogde, 2017), syntac-
tic complexity (Roark, Mitchel and Hollingshead,
2007), discourse phenomena (Habash, 2011) and
even prosodic elements found in narrative language
samples (Köning, et al., 2015).

Despite these efforts, there are still limitations
as the vast majority of researches have focused
solely on English speaking populations. One of
the challenges researches have dealt with is using
a multiethnic-large- scale Corpus for their studies.
Currently Hernández and Ratté (2016) in collabo-
ration with the Carolinas Conversation Collection
(Pope and Davis, 2011) are seeking to compile a
multiethnic English-Spanish Corpus with the objec-
tive to develope an automated tool to detect the most
common linguistic deficits in dementia patients.

As an alternative for an innovative analysis that
be at the same time useful in the automatic identifi-
cation of DAT, this paper is based on the Carolinas
Conversations Corpus in Spanish and it presents the
methodology and first findings on a discourse analy-
sis conducted on Dementia of Alzheimer-type pa-
tients using the Rhetorical Structure Theory, RST
(Mann and Thompson, 1988). Specifically, the
method followed was taken from Maite Taboada´s
study (2004). The purpose is to identify and ex-
tract patterns in the discourse relations (also known

as rhetorical relations) both in the conversations of
Alzheimer-type Dementia patients and normal el-
derly adults.

2 Related Work

Since its proposal, RST has been envisioned as a the-
oretical model of much utility in the field of Natural
Language Processing; evidence of this are the mul-
tiple applications in areas as diverse as automatic
text summaries, automatic translation, parallel cor-
pus, subjective content analysis and textual similar-
ity among many others.

2.1 RST for Analysis of Conversations
The study of spoken discourse has also been the
focus of attention of the inquiries concerning RST.
Within this field we find the studies by Fawcet and
Davies (1992) who propose an analysis of mono-
logue, which can serve as an autonomous discourse
unit. Using the original RST proposal by Mann
and Thompson, Amanda Stent (2000) offers a new
method for segmentation and relations to perform an
analysis through turns form which new concepts of
relations were created. Moreover, prosodic elements
are integrated so as to perform the segmentation.

Maite Taboada (2004) proposes a dialogic analy-
sis method adhering to the original RST. She anal-
yses conversations in Spanish and English from
JANUS corpus. Her analysis is contrastive and qual-
itative intra and inter turns. In her results, she
demonstrates that a dialogic analysis can be per-
formed on any language; in addition, she proves that
RST is a reliable method to be implemented in spo-
ken discourse.

Other proposals which are not as closely related
to RST and which integrate other phenomena have
been suggested: DAMSL (Core and Allen, 1997)
uses a three layer scheme which integrates the ac-
tions of speech along with other filters such as the
communicative functions and utterances features.
On the other hand, ISO (Bunt et al., 2010) integrates
the acts of speech and the classification of emotions
for their application in the analysis of dialogs.

2.2 RST in the Analysis of Dementia
Up to this point, no study which retakes RST for the
discourse analysis on dementia patients has been en-
countered yet. This notes that whilst RST has had a

wide application in areas of computational linguis-
tics, it has not yet been implemented in other inter-
disciplinary fields such as clinical linguistics.

Notwithstanding this, in the treatment of linguis-
tics deficits, interesting proposals have started to be
formulated such as Kong et al. (2017). They used
RST in narrations and descriptions of aphasia pa-
tients and healthy adults. In the report, it is pointed
out that the affected patients produce less discourse
units. A breakthrough in this analysis is that the
study was strictly discourse-based contrasting the
majority of other studies which are based on lexical
analysis alone.

3 Method

In this section the procedure of this study is de-
scribed. The criterion for transcription, the labeling
of rhetoric relations and the construction and anal-
ysis of discourse trees were applied both in injured
patients and caregivers. As it was commented be-
fore, for the theoretical framework, the analysis pro-
posed by Taboada (2004) was reconsidered for the
following reasons: firstly, the author´s proposal is
the one which most adheres to the standard structure
of RST which has the support of a variety of studies;
secondly, one of the corpora used was in Spanish,
as a consequence the author discusses and takes into
account some of the phenomena which are typical of
Spanish at the moment of her analysis.

3.1 Corpus

In this study, the Carolinas Conversation Corpus
in Spanish, which integrates semi-structured inter-
views conducted on elder adults with Alzheimer dis-
ease, elder adults in a healthy aging process, and
elder adults with other neurodegenerative diseases
was used. The sample consisted of 7 adults di-
agnosed with Dementia of Alzheimer type in mild
and moderate stages (6 women, 1 man; average age:
84.57), and 6 healthy elderly control participants (6
women; average age: 84). All of the participants
lived in Ecuador and were Spanish speakers. Ad-
ditionally, the alias given by the Carolinas corpus
were preserved to protect their privacy. The period
between conversations goes from 6 to 50 minutes.

3.2 Annotation criteria

The norms of the Carolinas Conversations corpus
were used. The procedure involved separation in
turns (caregiver-patient), followed by the transcrip-
tion at an orthographic level. For the orthographic
level, the conventional signs for punctuation were
used: periods, commas, quotation marks, ques-
tion and exclamation marks. With regards to the
prosodic level, intonation phenomena were included
(rising/falling), pitch of the voice and long and short
pauses (starting from a second on). Finally, in form
of comments, kinesthetic phenomena were noted
(gestures, sighs, movements), as well as noises and
idiolect phenomena for each participant (for in-
stance, use of contractions and diminutives).

For the transcription, the computer program Tran-
scriber 1.5.1 (Boudahmane et al., 2008) was used;
the files were converted into txt format so that they
could be handled better.

3.3 Segmentation criteria

In the initial RST proposal, the minimum units are
defined as EDU´s (Elementary Discourse Units);
they refer to clauses which express a complete
meaning (Mann and Thompson, 1988: 6). From
this, it is deduced that the segmentation criteria re-
lies on semantic and syntactic limits.

The segmentation units in this study were adapted
to the characteristics of the conversational analy-
sis and were denominated as SDU´s (Semantic Dia-
logue Units) (Maite Taboada, 2004: 44). Basically,
SDU´s are utterances delimited by prosodic features
(intonation, pauses), syntactic forms (presence of
conjugated verb forms, complements and discourse

markers) and semantic criteria (semantic complete-
ness). Semantic units can be compared to previously
coined concepts in the field of discourse as "infor-
mation units" (Halliday, 1967) or "intonation units"
(Chafe, 1994). These segmentation criteria are also
considered in the analysis by Kong et al. (2017).

An important aspect to keep in mind during
the segmentation is the quantity of anomalies pre-
sented by patients.The reformulations, the incom-
plete statements and the unusually long pauses were
relatively frequent, therefore, there were some con-
cessions made. For example, syntactic criteria were
established as a more reliable limit; however, if there
were confusions, the pitch or the intonation disam-
biguated the boundaries between units. Similarly, on
multiple occasions the patient was unable to com-
plete a semantic unit. For these cases, a statement
was considered a SDU if it included a conjugated
verb and if it was relatively understandable.

3.4 Labelling

The rhetoric relations, also known as a coherence
or discourse relations (Taboada and Mann, 2006),
connect each SDU through functional and semantic
features (Mann and Thompson: 5) and the criterion
of nuclearity between two semantic units.

During the labeling, it was decided to adhere to
the standard classification due to the fact that it
is one of the most commonly used classifications;
furthermore, unlike others, the number of relations
does not hinder identification. The classification was
taken form the official RST web-page.1

3.5 Discursive-trees elaboration

For the building of discursive-trees, the RSTTool
program (O´ Donell, 2004) was employed. Besides
the diagrams, this tool offers a statistical section in
which it counts the total EDU´s and the number of
rhetorical relations used in the conversations.

In this first phase it was only applied an intra-turn
analysis. The elaboration of discourse trees follows
one of the fundamental principles of the theory: the
principle of hierarchy between spans and relation
schemas (Taboada and Mann, 2006). According to
Taboada (2004), the making of discourse trees im-
plies studying the entire text (in this case the entire
turn of the patient), locating the biggest, most impor-
tant and general segments from the surface, and dis-
integrating them into smaller units. A second analy-
sis is performed inversely: from small units to gen-
eral ones. In this work both process were made.

Taking into account that an interlocutor always
tries to take advantages of their interventions, a nu-
clear SDU per se was not enough in some cases. It
was decided to consider more nuclear semantic units
inside the turn if it was required.

During this stage of analysis, anomalies in dis-
course were reencountered; on some occasions,
mostly in the turn of dementia patients, there were
ruptures which cannot be related to the main frame,
among which, the segment was not united to the
main structure and both were considered two differ-
ent trees. Afterwards, in the organization of rela-
tions, if the segments were re- related one another,
then these were united to the principal tree.

3.6 Preliminary results

Tables 1 and 2 show most frequent rhetorical rela-
tions used by DAT patients and healthy elderly con-
trols, respectively. Until now, the results of the quan-
titative analysis point out that there are marked dif-
ferences in the frequency of rhetoric relations pro-
duced between the population with dementia and the
healthy older controls. Additionally, patients with
dementia use less variety of rhetoric relations in their
conversational discourse than adults without cere-
bral damage.

Out of all the rhetorical relations, there is a fre-
quent use of elaboration relation in both popula-
tions. Despite the fact that the use of elaboration is
more frequent that other forms of relations, partic-
ularly in the patients with Alzheimer-type demen-
tia, other relations are recurrent as well; there are
concession, justify and restatement. It is particularly
remarkable that relations like enablement, uncondi-
tional and purpose were not employed by either of
the groups.

Based on data, it is observed that, roughly, most
used relations in elderly adults were also frequently
used by DAT patients, hence, it seems that the main
difference between the samples relies on the propor-
tion of relations used.

3.7 Future Work

Even though this study employed a limited number
of DAT patients, the sample allows the exploration
of RST as a reliable method for describing coher-
ence relations established between semantic units in
a dialog. However, it is still necessary to carry out

37



contrastive studies with other corpus in order to cor-
roborate the results obtained in this work.

Many tasks are yet to be done in the present pro-
posal, one of which is the examination of the tree
diagrams of each speaker. The number of nodes and
the levels of each scheme will result helpful in do-
ing so. The analysis in between turns is still missing,
which will be challenging considering the phenom-
ena involved. Consequently, this makes them diffi-
cult to integrate into the general diagram scheme. In
spite of the connection which can be established be-
tween turns, we must consider necessary restrictions
that the discourse genre imposes.

This paper merely examines the discourse of
a small sample of Alzheimer-type Dementia pa-
tients and healthy adults; nevertheless, the analysis
method of RST seems to be viable up until its incipi-
ent stage of analysis. For this reason further applica-
tions in the field of linguistic deficits are particularly
promising.
