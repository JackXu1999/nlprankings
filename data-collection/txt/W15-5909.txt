Abstract 

We conduct a cross-modal priming exper-

iment to determine the mental representa-

tion and access strategies for compound 

verbs (CV) in Bangla. Analysis of reac-

tion time indicates that compositionality 

among CVs triggers priming effects for 

both the constituent verbs. On the other 

hand non-compositional CVs exhibit 

priming only for the polar verb. Thus, 

compositional CVs are decomposed into 

their constituent verbs during processing. 

On the other hand, non-compositional 

verb phrases are represented and accessed 

as a whole in the minds of a Bangla 

speaker. The reaction time data thus col-

lected are used to evaluate our vector 

space model for compositionality judg-

ment. 

1 Introduction 

The term compositionality refers to the idea that 

the meaning of a complex expression is derived 

from (i) its structure and (ii) the meanings of its 

constituents (refer to (Fodor and Pylyshyn, 1988) 

for details). Compound verbs (henceforth CV) in 

Bangla are known to exhibit continuum of com-

positionality. Thus, some of them are composi-

tional (khete bashA “sit to eat”), some are non-

compositional (jAliye mArA “to irritate”) and 

some in between (ghure berAno “loitering”).  

There is a considerable linguistic debate on 

whether CVs are considered as two distinct words 

connected by some syntagmatic rule or whether

they form a single lexical unit (Paul, 2010; 

Chakrabarti et al., 2008; Butt, 1995) and whether 

semantic compositionality plays any role decid-

ing the above. These linguistically and computa-

tionally challenging issues play an important role 

in developing lexical resources like WordNet 

(Fellbaum, 2010). 

Since, none of the linguistic arguments and 

computational approaches has so far led to any 

consensus, we here for the first time performed a 

series of psycholinguistic experiments on Bangla 

compound verbs to study and model how the men-

tal lexicon(ML), organize and process such com-

plex expressions. The term mental lexicon refers 

to the storage of words in the human mind 

(Aitchison, 2005). A clear understanding of the 

structure and processing mechanism of CVs in the 

ML may provide us insight about how to repre-

sent and process CVs in computational lexicons. 

Further, the reaction time of the subjects for rec-

ognizing various lexical items under appropriate 

conditioning may lead us to develop more robust 

computational models of automatic identification 

of CVs.  

A plethora of works have been done to explore 

the representation and processing of words in the 

mental lexicon (refer to Seidenberg, 2012 to get a 

detail account of it). Attempts have also been 

made to study the processing of Bangla deriva-

tionally suffixed morphologically complex words 

(Dasgupta et al., 2010; Dasgupta et al., 2012, 

2014) and Bangla compound words (Dasgupta et 

al., 2015). However, to the best of our knowledge 

65



no such prior attempts have been made to psycho-

linguistically analyze the representation and pro-

cessing of the Bangla compound verbs. 

Based on the above discussion, the objective of 

this paper is to explore the semantic composition-

ality in Bangla CVs and its role in the possible 

organization and processing of CVs in the ML. 

Accordingly, we first use empirical techniques to 

collect user judgment of compositionality for 

Bangla CVs. Next, we perform the cross modal 

priming experiment to understand the processing 

of CVs ML. We found that Bangla CV exhibit 

continuum of compositionality. Highly composi-

tional verb phrases V1V2 trigger significant prim-

ing effect for both its constituent verbs V1 and V2. 

On the other hand, non-compositional verb se-

quences exhibit priming effect only for V1. These 

observations together imply that the mental lexi-

con decomposes compositional verb sequences 

into their constituent verbs and recognize sepa-

rately during processing. On the other hand non-

compositional verb sequences are organized and 

accessed as a whole. Based on the dataset col-

lected from the above experiments, we further de-

velop a vector space model to compute semantic 

compositionality in a verb sequence. The pre-

dicted values are compared with the human judg-

ment scores and the priming experiment results 

where a significant correlation is found. 

2 Compositionality Judgments 

We could not find any Bangla CV dataset publicly 

available and annotated in terms of composition-

ality. Thus, we choose 300 verb sequences and 

presented them to 36 native Bangla speakers. 

Similar to the work discussed in (Reddy et al., 

2011), we request each subject to give composi-

tionality score of the verb sequences by asking a) 

how literal the verb phrase is in a given context 

and b) how literal the constituent verbs are. Sub-

jects were asked to rate the compositionality un-

der 1-10 point scale, 10 being highly composi-

tional and 1 for non-compositional. In order to 

validate the user annotated data, we compute the 

inter-annotator agreement using the Fleiss Kappa 

measure (Fleiss et al., 1981). We found an agree-

ment of 𝜅= 0.68. 

3 The Priming Experiment 

Priming effects are observed because of the way 

our brain is supposed to function. Presentation of 

a stimulus (say a word P) activates a group of neu-

rons (often called a functional web) in the brain. 

When another stimulus (say word T) is then pre-

sented to the individual within a short duration, 

the recognition of T is faster if the functional web 

of T shares a lot of neurons with that of P. This 

fast reaction time to recognize a stimulus due to 

the prior exposure to a functionally related stimu-

lus is known as priming (Tulving et al., 1982). 

Thus, through priming experiments, we can iden-

tify word pairs whose functional webs have a 

stronger overlap, which in turn reveals how brain 

organizes the words in the mental lexicon (See 

(Pulvermüller, 2003; Spivey et al., 2012) for a de-

tailed account of such phenomena and different 

types of priming techniques). 

Experiment design: We conduct the cross-

modal repetition priming experiments as de-

scribed in (Marslen-Wilson et al., 1994). Here, a 

subject gets an audio stimulus (called prime (P)) 

of a verb sequence V1V2 and immediately at the 

offset of the spoken prime, gets a visual represen-

tation of the target (T) word V1. The same audio 

stimulus is presented to the subject after a random 

number of trials with the target V2. Based on the 

auditory prime and the visual target probe, the 

subjects are asked to decide whether the visually 

presented target V1 or V2 is a valid word in the 

language. The above experiment is also repeated 

with the same target words but with different au-

ditory inputs called the controls(C). The control 

verb sequences do not have any relatedness with 

the targets. For example, “kheye felo” (complete 

eating) and “khAOyA” (to eat) or “kheye felo” 

and “felo” (to drop) are P-T pairs, for which the 

corresponding C-T pair could be “niye jAO” (take 

away) and “khAOyA” (to eat). The time taken by 

a subject to complete the lexical decision task af-

ter the visual presentation of the target is defined 

as the response time (RT). For both the experi-

ments, RTs of all the targets were recorded and 

analyzed to observe priming effects.  

Materials: The 300 verb pairs as discussed in 

section 2, are grouped into two classes highly 

compositional (C1) and non-compositional (C2). 

We randomly choose 30 V1V2 pairs from each 

class as primes. For each prime, we have two tar-

gets V1 and V2, which makes 120 P-T pairs. Con-

sequently, 120 C-T and 240 fillers (or non-words) 

have been chosen to restrict the subjects to apply 

any strategic guess during the experiment. Over-

all, we have collected RTs for 480 word pairs in 

one experiment. A set of 10 P-T and C-T pairs 

were also collected for a practice session before 

the true experiments. However, the RTs of these 

practice pairs are not included in any analysis. 66



The experiment was conducted using the DMDX 

software tool that plays the auditory stimulus and 

then showed the visual probe for 200ms. Corre-

sponding to each visual probe, subjects had 

3000ms to perform the lexical decision after 

which the system presents the next audio stimu-

lus. The subject performs the decision task by 

pressing either the “K”' key for a VALID word 

and “S”' for INVALID word. The system auto-

matically records the RT, which in this case is the 

time between the onset of the visual probe and 

clicking of one of the buttons by the subject. The 

experiments were conducted on 36 native Bangla 

speakers; 29 of them have a graduate degree and 

7 hold a post graduate degree. The age of the sub-

jects varies between 25 to 35 years. 

Results: The RTs with extreme values 

(>2000ms) and those for incorrect lexical deci-

sions (about 3.2%) were excluded from the data. 

The raw RTs for all correct responses were in-

versely transformed (Ratcliff, 1993) and entered 

into a mixed-design analysis of variance with two 

factors: priming (primed and unprimed), and con-

dition (C1, C2). In the subject’s analysis (F1), 

condition and priming were treated as repeated 

measures. In the items analysis (F2), priming is 

treated as repeated factor and condition as inde-

pendent factor. Table 1 summarizes the mean RTs 

for the prime (P) and control (C) sets of the V1 

and V2 for the two classes.

Table 1: Average compositionality and RTs for the 

different word classes 

There was a strong main effect of priming with 

faster RTs to primed (667ms for V1 and 687ms for 

V2) than unprimed (679ms and 659ms) targets, 

F1(1, 36)= 47.60, p<.01; F2(1, 60)=26.00, p<0.01. 

There was a main effect of condition F1(1, 

30)=11.69, p<0.01, F2(1,60) =3.51, p<0.01, and a 

significant condition by priming interaction, indi-

cating that priming effects varied across condi-

tions. Thus, we have observed that when V1 is 

presented as target, significant priming occurred 

for words belonging to both C1 and C2. These re-

sults are statistically significant according to the 

2-way ANOVA test. On the other hand, when V2 

is presented as target with the same prime stimu-

lus V1V2, priming is observed only in C2. This re-

sult indicates that, compositional verb sequences 

exhibits priming for both the constituent verbs V1 

and V2 whereas, non-compositional verb se-

quences (C1) exhibit priming only with V1. This 

may be accounted for by the fact that non-compo-

sitional verb sequences derive their meaning 

mainly from the meaning of its first constituent 

verb V1, thus, priming occurs only with V1. On 

the other hand, as semantic compositionality be-

tween verb sequences increases, both the constit-

uent verbs (V1 and V2) plays role in determining 

the meaning of the whole expression. Thus, both 

the constituent verbs exhibit priming behavior 

when preceded by the prime V1+V2. The above 

observations together imply that:  

Compositional verb sequences are in general 

represented in terms of their constituent 

verbs in the mental lexicon; lexical access 

and comprehension is facilitated through de-

composition of the surface forms into the cor-

responding constituent verbs. On the other 

hand non compositional verb sequences are 

represented and accessed as a whole. 

4 Computational Model 

Based on the collected data, we now try to de-

velop a vector space model of semantic composi-

tionality to predict the organization and pro-

cessing of verb phrases in the mental lexicon. We 

evaluate our model with the data collected from 

our human judgment compositionality score and 

the cross-modal priming experiments. 

In our vector space model we represent a 

word's meaning in an n-dimensional space. Here, 

meaning of individual words is represented in 

terms of its co-occurrences observed in a large 

corpus. These co-occurrences are stored in a vec-

tor format acquired from a corpus following the 

different procedures as suggested in the literature 

(refer to (Mitchell and Lapata, 2008) for a de-

tailed overview). 

We have considered the lemmatized context 

words around the target word in a window of size 

200 as the co-occurrences. For the purpose of 

lemmatization, we have used a Bangla morpho-

logical analyzer having an accuracy of around 

67



95%. A Bangla corpus of 33 million words is al-

ready available2. The corpus contains document 

from different domain like literature, tourism, 

news and personal blogs. The top 10000 frequent 

content words from the corpus are used for the 

feature co-occurrences. To measure similarity be-

tween two vectors, cosine similarity (sim) is used. 

We have used the raw co-occurrence frequency as 

the values of the constructed vector. 

Given a CV W3 with the constituents W1 and 

W2, the compositionality score S3 of W3 is com-

puted as 𝑆3 = 𝑓(𝑆1, 𝑆2).  Where, S1 and S2 are the 
literality scores of W1 and W2 respectively and f 

is the semantic compositionality function defined 

in Column 1 of Table 1. S1 and S2 are computed 

as 

𝑆1 = 𝑠𝑖𝑚(𝑣1, 𝑣3)  and 

𝑆2 = 𝑠𝑖𝑚(𝑣2, 𝑣3). 

Where, v1, v2 and v3 be the co-occurrence vectors 

of W1, W2 and W3 respectively and 𝑠𝑖𝑚 is the co-
sine similarity between two vectors computed as:  

𝑠𝑖𝑚(𝑣1, 𝑣2) =
𝑣1. 𝑣2

|𝑣1||𝑣2|
 

The primary idea behind the constituent based 

compositionality model is the fact that if a con-

stituent word is used literally in a given verb se-

quence it is possible that the verb sequence and its 

constituent share common co-occurrences.  

We compare the compositionality score S3 of all 

the five composition functions namely, f1, f2, f3, 

f4, and f5 with the human annotated composition-

ality score. The constant parameters (𝛼, 𝛽, 𝛾) for 
all the five models have been computed using list 

square linear regression technique. We perform a 

6 folded cross validation over the test data. The 

performance of the individual models is reported 

in Table 2 below. We can observe that the com-

position functions f1and f5 are better predictor of 

phrase based compositionality than the other 

models.

In the final phase of our work, we have compared 

the phrase level compositionality score S3 and the 

literality scores S1 and S2 with the priming behav-

ior of targets V1 and V2. The correlation results 

are reported in Table 3. We observe S3 has got a 

high correlation with the priming behavior of the 

second constituent verb V2. On the other hand, 

weak correlation exists between S3 and V1. The 

observations are quite expected, as priming be-

havior in V1 is observed irrespective of the se-

mantic compositionality of the phrase V1V2,

whereas, priming behavior in V2 changes as com-

positionality in V1V2 changes. This is also re-

flected in Figure 1 and Figure 2 respectively. 

Similar observations are found for S1 and S2. 

Overall, the results in Table 3 are in agreement 

with that of Table 1: compositional verb phrases 

exhibit priming for both its constituents whereas 

non-compositional verb phrases shows priming 

only to its first constituent verb (V1).

5 General Discussion and Conclusion 

In this paper we have presented some preliminary 

psycholinguistic experiments to identify the role 

of compositionality in the representation and pro-

cessing of Bangla compound verbs in the mental 

lexicon. In order to do so, we first computed the 

user judgment of compositionality score. We 

found that there is a continuum of compositional-

ity between Bangla compound verbs. Next, we 

employ the cross-modal repetition priming exper-

iment over a set of Bangla compound verbs. Our 

initial results show that non-compositional verb 

sequences exhibit priming only with V2. On the 

other hand compositional verb sequences exhibit 

priming with both the constituent verbs V1 and 

V2. These observations together lead us to believe 

that mental representation and access of com-

pound verbs in Bangla typically depends on the 

compositionality of the constituent verbs. Com-

positional verb phrases are accessed via decom-

position of the phrase into its constituent verbs 

whereas non-compositional phrases are accessed 

as a whole.  

In the next phase of our work, we try to develop 

a vector space model of semantic compositional-

ity to predict the organization and processing of 

verb phrases in the mental lexicon. We evaluate 

our model with the data collected from our human 

judgment compositionality score and the cross-

modal priming experiments. Comparing the mod-

els output with that of the empirically collected 

data, we claim that the proposed vector space 

model correctly predicts the semantic composi-

tionality of Bangla verb sequences and their pos-

sible organization and processing in the mental 

lexicon. However, it would be premature to con-

clude anything concrete based only on the current 

experimental results. We also observe that several 

other factors including usage frequency and verb 

ordering affect the overall word recognition time 

and access mechanisms. Each of these factor calls 

for rigorous experimentation for understanding 

the exact nature of their interdependencies that we 

intend to perform in future.
