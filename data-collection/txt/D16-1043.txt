Abstract

Multi-modal distributional models learn
grounded representations for improved
performance in semantics. Deep visual
representations, learned using convolutional
neural networks, have been shown to achieve
particularly high performance. In this study,
we systematically compare deep visual
representation learning techniques, exper-
imenting with three well-known network
architectures. In addition, we explore the
various data sources that can be used for
retrieving relevant images, showing that
images from search engines perform as well
as, or better than, those from manually crafted
resources such as ImageNet. Furthermore, we
explore the optimal number of images and
the multi-lingual applicability of multi-modal
semantics. We hope that these findings can
serve as a guide for future research in the
field.

1 Introduction

Multi-modal distributional semantics addresses the
fact that text-based semantic models, which rep-
resent word meanings as a distribution over other
words (Turney and Pantel, 2010; Clark, 2015), suf-
fer from the grounding problem (Harnad, 1990). Re-
cent work has shown that this theoretical motivation
can be successfully exploited for practical gain. In-
deed, multi-modal representation learning leads to
improvements over language-only models in a range
of tasks, including modelling semantic similarity
and relatedness (Bruni et al., 2014; Silberer and La-
pata, 2014; Kiela and Bottou, 2014; Lazaridou et

al., 2015), improving lexical entailment (Kiela et
al., 2015a), predicting compositionality (Roller and
Schulte im Walde, 2013), bilingual lexicon induc-
tion (Bergsma and Van Durme, 2011), selectional
preference prediction (Bergsma and Goebel, 2011),
linguistic ambiguity resolution (Berzak et al., 2015),
visual information retrieval (Bulat et al., 2016) and
metaphor identification (Shutova et al., 2016).

Most multi-modal semantic models tend to rely
on raw images as the source of perceptual input.
Many data sources have been tried, ranging from
image search engines to photo sharing websites to
manually crafted resources. Images are retrieved for
a given target word if they are ranked highly, have
been tagged, or are otherwise associated with the tar-
get word(s) in the data source.

Traditionally, representations for images were
learned through bag-of-visual words (Sivic and Zis-
serman, 2003), using SIFT-based local feature de-
scriptors (Lowe, 2004). Kiela and Bottou (2014)
showed that transferring representations from deep
convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) yield
much better performance than bag-of-visual-words
in multi-modal semantics. ConvNets (LeCun et al.,
1998) have become very popular in recent years:
they are now the dominant approach for almost
all recognition and detection tasks in the com-
puter vision community (LeCun et al., 2015), ap-
proaching or even exceeding human performance in
some cases (Weyand et al., 2016). The work by
Alex Krizhevsky et al. (2012), which won the Im-
ageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge
(ILSVRC) (Russakovsky et al., 2015) in 2012, has
played an important role in bringing convolutional

networks (back) to prominence. A similar network
was used by Kiela and Bottou (2014) to obtain high
quality image embeddings for semantics.

This work aims to provide a systematic compari-
son of such deep visual representation learning tech-
niques and data sources; i.e. we aim to answer the
following open questions in multi-modal semantics:

• Does the improved performance over bag-
of-visual-words extend to different convolu-
tional network architectures, or is it specific to
Krizhevsky’s AlexNet? Do others work even
better?

• How important is the source of images? Is there
a difference between search engines and manu-
ally annotated data sources? Does the number
of images obtained for each word matter?

• Do these findings extend to different languages
beyond English?

We evaluate semantic representation quality through
examining how well a system’s similarity scores cor-
relate with human similarity and relatedness judg-
ments. We examine both the visual representations
themselves as well as the multi-modal representa-
tions that fuse visual representations with linguistic
input, in this case using middle fusion (i.e., concate-
nation). To the best of our knowledge, this work is
the first to systematically compare these aspects of
visual representation learning.

2 Architectures

We use the MMFeat toolkit1 (Kiela, 2016) to obtain
image representations for three different convolu-
tional network architectures: AlexNet (Krizhevsky

1https://github.com/douwekiela/mmfeat

et al., 2012), GoogLeNet (Szegedy et al., 2015) and
VGGNet (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014). Image
representations are turned into an overall word-level
visual representation by either taking the mean or
the elementwise maximum of the relevant image
representations. All three networks are trained to
maximize the multinomial logistic regression objec-
tive using mini-batch gradient descent with momen-
tum:

−
D∑

i=1

K∑

k=1

1{y(i) = k} log exp(θ
(k)>x(i))

∑K
j=1 exp(θ

(j)>x(i))

where 1{·} is the indicator function, x(i) and y(i) are
the input and output, respectively. D is the number
of training examples andK is the number of classes.
The networks are trained on the ImageNet classifica-
tion task and we transfer layers from the pre-trained
network. See Table 1 for an overview. In this sec-
tion, we describe the network architectures and their
properties.

AlexNet The network by Krizhevsky (2012) intro-
duces the following network architecture: first, there
are five convolutional layers, followed by two fully-
connected layers, where the final layer is fed into
a softmax which produces a distribution over the
class labels. All layers apply rectified linear units
(ReLUs) (Nair and Hinton, 2010) and use dropout
for regularization (Hinton et al., 2012). This net-
work won the ILSVRC 2012 ImageNet classifica-
tion challenge. In our case, we actually use the
CaffeNet reference model, which is a replication of
AlexNet, with the difference that it is not trained
with relighting data-augmentation, and that the or-
der of pooling and normalization layers is switched
(in CaffeNet, pooling is done before normalization,

instead of the other way around). While it uses an
almost identical architecture, performance of Caf-
feNet is slightly better than the original AlexNet.

GoogLeNet The ILSVRC 2014 challenge win-
ning GoogLeNet (Szegedy et al., 2015) uses “incep-
tion modules” as a network-in-network method (Lin
et al., 2013) for enhancing model discriminability
for local patches within the receptive field. It uses
much smaller receptive fields and explicitly focuses
on efficiency: while it is much deeper than AlexNet,
it has fewer parameters. Its architecture consists of
two convolutional layers, followed by inception lay-
ers that culminate into an average pooling layer that
feeds into the softmax decision (so it has no fully
connected layers). Dropout is only applied on the
final layer. All connections use rectifiers.

VGGNet The ILSVRC 2015 ImageNet classifi-
cation challenge was won by VGGNet (Simonyan
and Zisserman, 2014). Like GoogLeNet, it is much
deeper than AlexNet and uses smaller receptive

fields. It has many more parameters than the other
networks. It consists of a series of convolutional
layers followed by the fully connected ones. All
layers are rectified and dropout is applied to the first
two fully connected layers.

These networks were selected because they are
very well-known in the computer vision commu-
nity. They exhibit interesting qualitative differences
in terms of their depth (i.e., the number of layers),
the number of parameters, regularization methods
and the use of fully connected layers. They have all
been winning network architectures in the ILSVRC
ImageNet classification challenges.

3 Sources of Image Data

Some systematic studies of parameters for text-
based distributional methods have found that the
source corpus has a large impact on representational
quality (Bullinaria and Levy, 2007; Kiela and Clark,
2014). The same is likely to hold in the case of

visual representations. Various sources of image
data have been used in multi-modal semantics, but
there have not been many comparisons: Bergsma
and Goebel (2011) compare Google and Flickr, and
Kiela and Bottou (2014) compare ImageNet (Deng
et al., 2009) and the ESP Game dataset (von Ahn and
Dabbish, 2004), but most works use a single data
source. In this study, one of our objectives is to asses
the quality of various sources of image data. Table
2 provides an overview of the data sources, and Fig-
ure 1 shows some example images. We examine the
following corpora:

Google Images Google’s image search2 results
have been found to be comparable to hand-crafted
image datasets (Fergus et al., 2005).

Bing Images An alternative image search engine
is Bing Images3. It uses different underlying tech-
nology from Google Images, but offers the same
functionality as an image search engine.

Flickr Although Bergsma and Goebel (2011) have
found that Google Images works better in one exper-
iment, the photo sharing service Flickr4 is an inter-
esting data source because its images are tagged by
human annotators.

ImageNet ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) is a large
ontology of images developed for a variety of com-
puter vision applications. It serves as a benchmark-
ing standard for various image processing and com-
puter vision tasks. ImageNet is constructed along
the same hierarchical structure as WordNet (Miller,

1995), by attaching images to the corresponding
synset (synonym set).

ESP Game The ESP Game dataset (von Ahn and
Dabbish, 2004) was constructed through a so-called
“game with a purpose”. Players were matched on-
line and had to agree on an appropriate word label
for a randomly selected image within a time limit.
Once a word has been mentioned a certain number
of times, that word becomes a taboo word and can
no longer be used as a label.

These data sources have interesting qualitative
differences. Online services return images for al-
most any query, with much better coverage than
the fixed-size ImageNet and ESP Game datasets.
Search engines annotate automatically, while the
others are human-annotated, either through a strict
annotation procedure in the case of ImageNet, or by
letting users tag images, as in the case of Flickr and
ESP. Automatic systems sort images by relevance,
while the others are unsorted. The relevance rank-
ing method is not accessible, however, and so has
to be treated as a black box. Search results can be

language-specific, while the human annotated data
sources are restricted to English. Google and Bing
will return images that were ranked highly, while
Flickr contains photos rather than just any kind of
image. ImageNet contains high-quality images de-
scriptive of a given synset, meaning that the tagged
object is likely to be centered in the image, while
the ESP Game and Flickr images may have tags de-
scribing events happening in the background also.

3.1 Selecting and processing images
Selecting images for Google, Bing and Flickr is
straightforward: using their respective APIs, the de-
sired word is given as the search query and we ob-
tain the top N returned images (unless otherwise in-
dicated, we use N=10). In the case of ImageNet and
ESP, images are not ranked and vary greatly in num-
ber: for some words there is only a single image,
while others have thousands. With ImageNet, we
are faced with the additional problem that images
tend to be associated only with leaf nodes in the hi-
erarchy. For example, dog has no directly associated
images, while its hyponyms (e.g. golden retriever,
labrador) have many. If a word has no associated
images in its subtree, we try going up one level and
seeing if the parent node’s tree yields any images.
We subsequently randomly sample 100 images as-
sociated with the word and obtain semi-ranked re-

sults by selecting the 10 images closest to the me-
dian representation as the sampled image represen-
tations. We use the same method for the ESP Game
dataset. In all cases, images are resized and center-
cropped to ensure that they are the correct size input.

4 Evaluation

Representation quality in semantics is usually evalu-
ated using intrinsic datasets of human similarity and
relatedness judgments. Model performance is as-
sessed through the Spearman ρs rank correlation be-
tween the system’s similarity scores for a given pair
of words, together with human judgments. Here,
we evaluate on two well-known similarity and re-
latedness judgment datasets: MEN (Bruni et al.,
2012) and SimLex-999 (Hill et al., 2015). MEN fo-
cuses explicitly on relatedness (i.e. coffee-tea and
coffee-mug get high scores, while bakery-zebra gets
a low score), while SimLex-999 focuses on what it
calls “genuine” similarity (i.e., coffee-tea gets a high
score, while both coffee-mug and bakery-zebra get
low scores). They are standard evaluations for eval-
uating representational quality in semantics.

In each experiment, we examine performance of
the visual representations compared to text-based
representations, as well as performance of the multi-
modal representation that fuses the two. In this

case, we apply mid-level fusion, concatenating the
L2-normalized representations (Bruni et al., 2014).
Middle fusion is a popular technique in multi-modal
semantics that has several benefits: 1) it allows for
drawing from different data sources for each modal-
ity, that is, it does not require joint data; 2) con-
catenation is less susceptible to noise, since it pre-
serves the information in the individual modalities;
and 3) it is straightforward to apply and computa-
tionally inexpensive. Linguistic representations are
300-dimensional and are obtained by applying skip-
gram with negative sampling (Mikolov et al., 2013)
to a recent dump of Wikipedia. The normalization
step that is performed before applying fusion en-
sures that both modalities contribute equally to the
overall multi-modal representation.

5 Results

As Table 3 shows, the data sources vary in cover-
age: it would be unfair to compare data sources on
the different subsets of the evaluation datasets that
they have coverage for. That is, when comparing
data sources we want to make sure we evaluate on
images for the exact same word pairs. When com-
paring network architectures, however, we are less
interested in the relative coverage between datasets
and more interested in overall performance, in such

a way that it can be compared to other work that was
evaluated on the fully covered datasets. Hence, we
report results on the maximally covered subsets per
data source, which we refer to as MEN and SimLex,
as well as for the overlapping common subset of
word pairs that have images in each of the sources,
which we refer to as MEN* and SimLex*.

5.1 Maximum coverage comparison
Table 4 shows the results on the maximally covered
datasets. This means we cannot directly compare be-
tween data sources, because they have different cov-
erage, but we can look at absolute performance and
compare network architectures. The first row reports
results for the text-based linguistic representations
that were obtained from Wikipedia (repeated across
columns for convenience). For each of the three ar-
chitectures, we evaluate on SimLex (SL) and MEN,
using either the mean (Mean) or elementwise max-
imum (Max) method for aggregating image repre-
sentations into visual ones (see Section 2). For each
data source, we report results for the visual repre-
sentations, as well as for the multi-modal represen-
tations that fuse the visual and textual ones together.
Performance across architectures is remarkably sta-
ble: we have had to report results up to three deci-
mal points to show the difference in performance in
some cases.

452



Figure 2: The effect of the number of images on representation quality.

For each of the network architectures, we see
a marked improvement of multi-modal representa-
tions over uni-modal linguistic representations. In
many cases, we also see visual representations out-
performing linguistic ones, especially on SimLex.
This is interesting, because e.g. Google and Bing
have full coverage over the datasets, so their visual
representations include highly abstract words, which
does not appear to have an adverse impact on the
method’s performance. For the ESP Game dataset
(on which performance is quite low) and ImageNet,
we observe an increase in performance as we move
to the right in the table. Interestingly, VGGNet on
ImageNet scores very highly, which seems to indi-
cate that VGGNet is somehow more “specialized”
on ImageNet than the others. The difference be-
tween mean and max aggregation is relatively small,
although the former seems to work better for Sim-
Lex while the latter does slightly better for MEN.

5.2 Common subset comparison

Table 5 shows the results on the common subset of
the evaluation datasets, where all word pairs have
images in each of the data sources. First, note the
same patterns as before: multi-modal representa-

tions perform better than linguistic ones. Even for
the poorly performing ESP Game dataset, the VG-
GNet representations perform better on both Sim-
Lex and MEN (bottom right of the table). Visual
representations from Google, Bing, Flickr and Im-
ageNet all perform much better than ESP Game on
this common covered subset. In a sense, the full-
coverage datasets were “punished” for their ability
to return images for abstract words in the previous
experiment: on this subset, which is more concrete,
the search engines do much better. To a certain
extent, including linguistic information is actually
detrimental to performance, with multi-modal per-
forming worse than purely visual. Again, we see the
marked improvement with VGGNet for ImageNet,
while Google, Bing and Flickr all do very well, re-
gardless of the architecture.

These numbers indicate the robustness of the ap-
proach: we find that multi-modal representation
learning yields better performance across the board:
for different network architectures, different data
sources and different aggregation methods. If com-
putational efficiency or memory usage are issues,
then GoogLeNet or AlexNet are the best choices.
The ESP Game dataset does not appear to work very

453



well, and is best avoided. If we have the right cov-
erage, then ImageNet gives good results, especially
if we can use VGGNet. However, coverage is of-
ten the main issue, in which case Google and Bing
yield images that are comparable or even better than
images from the carefully annotated ImageNet.

5.3 Number of images

Another question is the number of images we want
to use: does performance increase with more im-
ages? Is it always better to have seen 100 cats in-
stead of only 10, or do we have enough information
after having seen one or two already? There is an
obvious trade-off here, since downloading and pro-
cessing images takes time (and may incur financial
costs). This experiment only applies to relevance-
sorted data sources: the image selection procedure
for ImageNet and ESPGame is more about removing
outliers than about finding the best possible images.

As Figure 2 shows, it turns out that the optimal
number of images stabilizes surprisingly quickly:
around 10-20 images appears to be enough, and in
some cases already too many. Performance across
networks does not vary dramatically when using
more images, but in the case of Flickr images on the
MEN dataset, performance drops significantly as the
number of images increases.

5.4 Multi- and cross-lingual applicability

Although there are some indicators that visual rep-
resentation learning extends to other languages, par-
ticularly in the case of bilingual lexicon learning
(Bergsma and Van Durme, 2011; Kiela et al., 2015b;
Vulić et al., 2016), this has not been shown directly
on the same set of human similarity and relatedness
judgments. In order to examine the multi-lingual ap-
plicability of our findings, we train linguistic repre-
sentations on recent dumps of the English and Italian
Wikipedia. We then search for 10 images per word
on Google and Bing, while setting the language to
English or Italian. We compare the results on the
original SimLex, and the Italian version from Le-
viant and Reichart (2015).

Similarly, we examine a cross-lingual scenario,
where we translate Italian words into English using
Google Translate. We then obtain images for the
translated words and extract visual representations.
These cross-lingual visual representations are sub-

sequently evaluated on the Italian version of Sim-
Lex. Since we know that performance across archi-
tectures is similar, we use AlexNet representations.

The results can be found in Table 6. We find the
same pattern: in all cases, visual and multi-modal
representations outperform linguistic ones. The Ital-
ian version of SimLex appears to be more diffi-
cult than the English version. Google performs bet-
ter than Bing, especially on the Italian evaluations.
For Google, the cross-lingual scenario works bet-
ter, while Bing yields better results in the multi-
lingual setting where we use the language itself in-
stead of mapping to English. Although somewhat
preliminary, these results clearly indicate that multi-
modal semantics can fruitfully be applied to lan-
guages other than English.

6 Conclusion and future work

The objective of this study has been to system-
atically compare network architectures and data
sources for multi-modal systems. In particular, we
focused on the capabilities of deep visual represen-
tations in capturing semantics, as measured by cor-
relation with human similarity and relatedness judg-
ments. Our findings can be summarized as follows:

• We examined AlexNet, GoogLeNet and
VGGNet, all three recent winners of the
ILSVRC ImageNet classification challenge
(Russakovsky et al., 2015), and found that
they perform very similarly. If efficiency or
memory are issues, AlexNet or GoogLeNet
are the most suitable architectures. For overall

454



best performance, AlexNet and VGGNet are
the best choices.

• The choice of data sources appeared to have a
bigger impact: Google, Bing, Flickr and Im-
ageNet were much better than the ESP Game
dataset. Google, Flickr and Bing have the ad-
vantage that they have potentially unlimited
coverage. Google and Bing are particularly
suited to full-coverage experiments, even when
these include abstract words.

• We found that the number of images has an
impact on performance, but that it stabilizes at
around 10-20 images, indicating that it is usu-
ally not necessary to obtain more than 10 im-
ages per word. For Flickr, obtaining more im-
ages is detrimental to performance.

• Lastly, we established that these findings ex-
tend to other languages beyond English, obtain-
ing the same findings on an Italian version of
SimLex using the Italian Wikipedia. We ex-
amined both the multi-lingual setting where we
obtain search results using the Italian language
and a cross-lingual setting where we mapped
Italian words to English and retrieved images
for those.

This work answers several open questions in
multi-modal semantics and we hope that it will serve
as a guide for future research in the field. It is im-
portant to note that the multi-modal results only ap-
ply to the mid-level fusion method of concatenat-
ing normalized vectors: although these findings are
indicative of performance for other fusion methods,
different architectures or data sources may be more
suitable for different fusion methods.

In future work, downstream tasks should be ad-
dressed: it is good that multi-modal semantics im-
proves performance on intrinsic evaluations, but it
is important to show its practical benefits in more
applied tasks as well. Understanding what it is that
makes these representations perform so well is an-
other important and yet unanswered question. We
hope that this work may be used as a reference in
determining some of the choices that can be made
when developing multi-modal models.
