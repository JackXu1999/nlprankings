Abstract

Misuse of Chinese prepositions is one of common word usage errors in grammatical error diag-

nosis. In this paper, we adopt the Chinese Gigaword corpus and HSK corpus as L1 and L2 cor-

pora, respectively. We explore gated recurrent neural network model (GRU), and an ensemble 

of GRU model and maximum entropy language model (GRU-ME) to select the best preposition 

from 43 candidates for each test sentence. The experimental results show the advantage of the 

GRU models over simple RNN and n-gram models. We further analyze the effectiveness of 

linguistic information such as word boundary and part-of-speech tag in this task.

1 Introduction

As learning Chinese has been popular world-wide, Chinese word spelling checking and grammatical 

error diagnosis for learners of Chinese language is recently advanced in the NLP community. In the 

NLP-TEA shared tasks (Yu et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2015a, Lee et al., 2015b), four types of grammatical 

errors including disorder, redundant, missing, and mis-selection are defined. These tasks focus on de-

tecting and identifying grammatical errors, but not addressing error correction.

In English, selection of appropriate prepositions is a barrier to non-native language learners (Cho-

dorow et al., 2007; Felica and Pulman, 2008). Many studies deal with the issue of preposition error 

detection and correction (Dale et al., 2012; Ng et al., 2013). The selection of Chinese prepositions is 

also challenging to non-native learners, especially for some common prepositions. (S1) and (S2) show 

a real case from the HSK corpus. The preposition 從 (cóng, “from”) in (S2) is preferred to 在 (zài, 

“on/in/at”) in (S1). In this paper, we investigate Chinese preposition selection.

est)

A model trained on an error-annotated dataset benefits from learning the mapping between wrong 

instances and their corrected counterparts (Cahill et al., 2013). However, large error-annotated dataset 

for Chinese preposition error correction is still not available. In this paper, we utilize a large-scale corpus 

written by native Chinese speakers to deal with this problem. We adopt language models based on re-

current neural networks (RNNs) (Mikolov et al., 2011) to capture word dependencies in sentences. Cut-

ting-edge methods like noise contrastive estimation (NCE) (Chen et al., 2015a) and gated recurrent unit 

(GRU) (Cho et al., 2014) are explored in RNNs. For the task of 43-way classification, i.e., to select the 

best preposition from 43 candidates, the gated recurrent neural network model (GRU) achieves an ac-

curacy of 74.05% and an MRR of 83.08% on the Chinese Gigaword corpus (L1 corpus), and achieves 

an accuracy of 60.13% and an MRR of 72.54% on the HSK corpus (L2 corpus). An ensemble of gated

recurrent neural network model and maximum entropy language model (GRU-ME) further improves 

the accuracy and the MRR of the GRU model on the Gigaword corpus to 76.71% and 84.89%.

The contribution of this paper is two-fold. From technological point of view, to the best of our 

knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to deal with Chinese preposition selection based on gated 

recurrent neural network model and an ensemble of GRU and ME. From linguistic point of view, it

discusses the unique phenomena of Chinese prepositions with empirical evidence. The rest of this paper 

is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the related work of grammatical error diagnosis in English 

and Chinese. We further introduce Chinese prepositions in Section 3. Section 4 shows L1 and L2 corpora 

used in this study. Section 5 presents our approach to Chinese preposition selection. Section 6 shows 

the experimental results. We further analyze the results in Section 7. Finally, Section 8 concludes this 

work.

2 Related Work

English preposition error detection has attracted much attention for years. Felice and Pulman (2007)

proposed a voted perceptron classifier for disambiguating the uses of five common prepositions includ-

ing “in”, “of”, “on”, “to”, and “with”. In the work of Felice and Pulman (2008), error detection of nine 

common prepositions is tackled with the maximum entropy classifier. Chodorow et al. (2007) deal with

the detection of preposition errors of non-native learners. In addition to error detection, some studies 

address the task of English preposition selection. Bergsma et al. (2009) propose a supervised language 

model for preposition correction. Tetreault et al. (2010) introduce parse features for this task. Cahill et 

al. (2013) propose a preposition error correction model trained on error-annotated data, and treated the 

revision logs of Wikipedia as a large error-annotated corpus. Xiang et al. (2013) propose a hybrid ap-

proach to deal with preposition selection. Zhang and Wang (2014) introduce a framework for English 

grammatical error correction using the maximum entropy language model for the replacement errors. 

Ramisa et al. (2015) address the task of preposition prediction for image descriptions with multimodal 

features. Related evaluations are covered in the shared tasks of HOO 2011 (Dale and Kilgarriff, 2011), 

HOO 2012 (Dale et al., 2012), CoNLL 2013 (Ng et al., 2013) and CoNLL 2014 (Ng et al., 2014).

In addition to Chinese spelling checking (Lee et al., 2015b), grammatical error detection in Chinese 

has been investigated recently. Wang (2011) shows common Chinese grammatical errors like missing 

components and error word orderings. Lin (2011), Yu and Chen (2012), and Cheng et al. (2014) focus 

on the detection and correction of word ordering errors in Chinese written by foreign students in the 

HSK corpus. Shiue and Chen (2016) determine if a Chinese sentence contains word usage errors.

In the NLP-TEA shared tasks (Yu et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2015a), detection of four grammatical errors 

are targeted. Lin and Chan (2014) train SVM classifiers with various bigram features. Zampiperi and 

Tan (2014) propose a frequency-based approach based on a large general corpus. Zhao et al. (2014; 

2015) model the task of correction as machine translation in such a way that the wrong sentences are 

translated to correct ones. The preposition error detection is one of error cases in NLP-TEA shared tasks. 

However, the preposition correction is beyond the scope of NLP-TEA.

Different from previous works, our work focuses on the correction of Chinese prepositions. We aim 

at selecting suitable prepositions from a set of 43 common prepositions. To overcome the limitation of 

error-annotated dataset, we propose an unsupervised approach based on language models, which can be 

trained on a large scale L1 corpus without the need of annotation.

3 Chinese Prepositions

A preposition is a function word that is followed by a noun phrase to introduce a preposition phrase

(PP). It indicates a relation between the noun phrase and other words within the sentence. For example, 

“in”, “on”, “to”, “with”, and “of” are most common prepositions in English. In the Penn Treebank 3

corpus (Marcus et al., 1999), 186 distinct English words are tagged with the part-of-speech (POS) tag 

“P” (i.e. preposition). In the 186 prepositions, some of them are abbreviations such as “altho” (although) 

and “w.” (with). 

In the same manner, we found a total of 288 distinct Chinese prepositions in the Chinese Treebank 

8.0 corpus (Xue et al., 2013). The total occurrences of them are 54,239 in 71,369 sentences. In the 288 

prepositions, 199 of them appear more than once, and 44 of them appear more than 100 times. The top 

three most frequent prepositions are在 (zài, “on/in/at”),對 (duì, “to/at”), and 從 (cóng, “from”). 

889



The CKIP group (1993) categorized Chinese prepositions into 66 types of senses1. For example, these

words直到 (zhí dào),迄 (qì), 等到 (děng dào), 比及 (bǐ jí), 及至 (jí zhì), and 待到 (dài dào) share the 
same meaning of “until” when they are used as preposition. Note that some prepositions have other 

usages. The words與 (yǔ) and 和 (hàn) can be used as preposition with the meaning of “with”, while 

they are also common conjunctions with the meaning of “and”. The word 對 (duì) can be used as prep-

osition (to/at), noun (a pair of), adjective (right/correct), adverb (yes), and verb (be opposite/reply) with 

various senses. Another highly ambiguous word給 (gěi) can be used as preposition (to/for/with), verb 

(give/let), and emphatic particle. Both 對 (duì) and給 (gěi) are common Chinese words, they have 
multiple senses by their own, and they are interchangeable in some situations.

Some preposition/noun pairs usually collocate. For example, the combination of the noun 辨公室

(office) and the preposition 在 (zài, “in”) forms a common preposition phrase 在辨公室 (in the office). 

In a complicated sentence like (S3), there are eight words in-between在 and 辨公室. Such a long dis-
tance dependency is challenging to language models. 

(S3) 我 在 設於 上海 浦東 機場 西面 的 口岸 服務 辨公室 (I am in the
port service office located in the west of the Pudong airport, 

Shanghai)

In addition, the combination of the preposition and the noun varies according to semantics. For the 

noun辨公室 (office) in (S4) and (S5), different prepositions are used. The ambiguity of preposition 

selection not only causes confusion to non-native learners, but also makes challenges in natural language 

processing.

(S4) 我 在 辨公室 上班 (I work in the office)

(S5) 我 從 辨公室 出發 (I depart from the office)

4 Datasets

We adopt the Tagged Chinese Gigaword (CGW) corpus 2.02 (Huang, 2009; Huang et al., 2008) as the 

L1 corpus. It contains 2,803,632 documents and 831,748,000 words with part-of-speech (POS) tags. By 

removing the sentences without prepositions, a total of 23,486,882 sentences covering 155 prepositions

are collected from the Gigaword corpus. We randomly select 60% of sentences for training models due 

to the computation limitations. Additional 5,000 and 200,000 sentences are randomly selected as devel-

opment data and test data, respectively. The development data is used for validation.

HSK dynamic composition corpus is adopted as the L2 corpus3. It collects articles written by students 

from foreign countries to study Chinese in Beijing Language and Culture University. Total 46 error 

categories range from character level, word level, sentence level, to discourse level are annotated and 

corrected in the HSK corpus. The CKIP segmentation system is used to perform Chinese word segmen-

tation and POS tagging on the sentences in HSK because the POS tagging in the CGW corpus follows 

the CKIP style.

From the HSK corpus, total 745 sentences consisting of preposition errors are extracted from word-

level grammatical error set. Limited to the small L2 dataset, these 745 sentences are used as test data 

only. The statistics of L1 and L2 datasets are listed in Table 1.

Among the Chinese prepositions mentioned in Section 3, 43 prepositions, most of which are common 

words, appear in the HSK dataset. Note that 33 of them belong to the list of the top 50 prepositions in 

CGW. Furthermore, these 43 prepositions cover 88.61% of preposition uses in CGW. Figure 1 lists the 

43 prepositions used in this work by the order of their occurrences.

Figure 1: Prepositions in the HSK corpus.

5 Methods

This work deals with the preposition selection error. Given a set of Chinese prepositions, PS, and a 

sentence S = (x1, x2, ..., xi-1, xi, xi+1, ..., xn), where xi is a preposition, we try to substitute xi for each 

preposition p in PS, and choose the most probable preposition �̂�.

�̂� =   argmax
𝑝∈𝑃𝑆

𝑃(𝑥1, 𝑥2, . . . , 𝑥𝑖−1, 𝑝, 𝑥𝑖+1, . . . , 𝑥𝑛)

Prepositions are a closed set of function words. Thus, it is feasible to substitute each of all prepositions 

for the location of a preposition. As listed in Section 4, PS contains 43 common prepositions which 

appear in both the CGW corpus and the HSK corpus. The probability of a sentence is estimated by a 

language model. The traditional n-gram language model is considered as the baseline in this work. The 

SRI language modeling toolkit (SRILM)4, an implementation of n-gram language model, is adopted.

The major disadvantage of n-gram is that the number of its parameters growths exponentially as the 

order of n-gram increases. As a result, the order of n-gram usually ranges between bigram and 5-gram. 

The n-gram model with high order is not impractical. 

Recently, language models based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as simple RNN, long 

short-term memory (LSTM), and gated recurrent unit (GRU) (Mikolov et al., 2011; Hochreiter and Jür-

gen Schmidhuber, 1997; Cho et al., 2014) have been shown to outperform traditional approaches in 

speech recognition and other applications. Figure 2 illustrates a basic recurrent neural network. The 

hidden state st is passed to the next step for the following update.

𝑠𝑡 = 𝑓(𝑊𝑥𝑡 + 𝑈𝑠𝑡−1)

where f is an activation function such as a sigmoid function or a tanh function, and W and U are param-

eters to be learned. In other words, the history information is kept.

Compared to n-gram, RNN based language model can capture longer distance dependencies with less 

parameters. As mentioned in Section 3, long distance dependency modelling is crucial to preposition 

selection. For this reason, we employ the simple RNN and the GRU language models to estimate the 

probability of a preposition in a given sentence. Instead of the single sigmoid or tanh function used by 

the simple RNN, GRU model, which is simplified from LSTM, uses a structure namely gated recurrent 

unit in the hidden layer.

𝑠𝑡 = (1 − 𝑧)ℎ + 𝑧𝑠𝑡−1
ℎ = tanh (𝑊ℎ𝑥𝑡 + 𝑟𝑡(𝑈ℎ𝑠𝑡−1))

𝑧 = σ(𝑊𝑧𝑥𝑡 + 𝑈𝑧𝑠𝑡−1)
𝑟 = σ(𝑊𝑟𝑥𝑡 + 𝑈𝑟𝑠𝑡−1)

As shown in Figure 3, the update gate z decides how much the hidden state s is updated with the candi-

date hidden state �̃�, while the reset gate r decides how much the memory to be forgotten. GRU is reported 
to be better for long-term dependency modeling (Chung et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2015b) than the simple 

RNN. Compared to LSTM, GRU requires few parameters for the same size of hidden layer.

Figure 3: Gated recurrent unit (GRU).

In this work, we use the noise contrastive estimation (NCE) (Chen et al., 2015a) as the output layer 

for both simple RNN and GRU language models. The training performance of NCE is comparable to 

the class-based softmax, but NCE is faster in testing stage and can speed up together with GPU in train-

ing stage. The implementation of RNN models is based on faster-rnnlm, a toolkit for RNN language 

modelling5.

6 Experiments

Three language models, n-gram, simple RNN, and GRU, are evaluated in the experiments with various 

configurations. The n-gram models are trained with the orders from 2 to 12. The simple RNN and the 

GRU models are trained with the hidden sizes of 128, 256, and 512. The number of noise samples of 

NCE is set to 20. Moreover, all language models are trained on three linguistic levels: 

(1) Character level (char): each unit is a Chinese character. 

(2) Word level (word): each unit is a Chinese word. 

(3) Word level with POS tag (w/p): each unit is a combination of a word and its POS tag. 

The performance is measured by accuracy and mean reciprocal rank (MRR). The accuracy is defined 

as number of correct selection versus number all test instances. The MRR is defined as 
1

𝑁
∑

1

rank𝑖

𝑁
𝑖=1

where N is number of instances, and ranki is the rank of the correct preposition among PS according to 

its probability. In L1 testing, we check if the predicted preposition is the same as the original preposition 

in the sentence. In L2 testing, we check if the predicted preposition is the one corrected by annotators. 

McNemar test is used for significance testing at p=0.05.

Experimental results in L1 and L2 are shown in Table 2. For the n-gram models with different orders 

(from 2 to 12), we only show the highest performances due to the limited space. The subscripts of the 

simple RNN and the GRU models denote their hidden sizes. The best performing configuration for each 

of n-gram, simple RNN, and GRU models is highlighted in bold. In general, the larger the hidden layer, 

the better the performances of the simple RNN and the GRU language models. GRU model outperforms 

simple RNN and n-gram models in most cases. The best n-gram model is trained on word level with 

POS tags, the best simple RNN model is trained on word level using a hidden size of 512, and the best 

GRU model, which is also the best model of all, is trained on word-level with POS tag using a hidden 

size of 512. In both L1 and L2 testing, the best GRU model significantly outperforms the best simple

RNN model.

The n-gram model and the GRU model perform better on the word level with POS tag, while the 

simple RNN model performs better on the word-level. On the other hand, all the n-gram, simple RNN, 

and GRU models trained on character level perform poorly. Grouping characters into words may help 

language models to capture long distance dependency. The neural networks are capable of learning 

feature representation from raw data. The linguistic information like POS tags still increases the perfor-

mances of the GRU model.

The best performing model, GRU512 trained on word level with POS tag, achieves an accuracy of 

74.05% and an MRR of 83.08% on L1, and an accuracy of 60.13% and an MRR of 72.54% on L2. The 

precision@3 is 91% in L1 testing, and 81% in L2 testing. For a task of 43-way classification, this result 

is promising. 

Among the three best performing n-gram, simple RNN and GRU models, the smallest performance 

gap between L1 and L2 is found in the GRU model. Compared to the other two models, GRU model 

achieves better testing fitness and less overfitting. However, the performance gap between L1 and L2 is 

still an issue to be tackled in the future.

7 Discussion

Table 3 shows the performances of most frequent prepositions by the best performing n-gram, simple 

RNN and GRU models in L2 testing. The last row represents the performances of all prepositions in 

micro average. In each row, the best precision (P), recall (R), and F-score (F) are highlighted. The con-

fusion matrix of the best performing GRU model in L2 testing is shown in Table 4. Most frequent 

prepositions are listed. Each row represents the sample in an actual preposition, while each column of 

the matrix represents the samples in a predicted preposition.

The preposition 在 (zài), the most frequent Chinese preposition, covers the meanings of on, in, and 

at in English. The precision of the second preposition 對 (duì, “to/at”) achieved by the GRU model is 

only 59.76%. As shown in Table 4, 18 instances of 在 (zài, “on/in/at”) and 10 instances of 給 (gěi, 

“for/to”) are misclassified to對. As a result, the recall of 給 (gěi, “for/to/with”) and the precision of 對

are poor. In fact, they are sometimes interchangeable. For instance, using 對 in place of 給 in (S6) is 
also correct. However, only one correct preposition is labeled in the HSK corpus. In other words, our 

models are under-estimated due to the one-answer evaluation. In English, prepositions are also report-

edly more than one way to correct (Bryant and Ng, 2015).

The third frequent preposition 從 (cóng, “from”) tends to confuse with在 (zài, “on/in/at”) and以 (yǐ, 

“by/with”). The fourth and the fifth prepositions用 (yòng, “by/with”) and以 (yǐ, “by/with”) share sim-
ilar meanings and tend to be confusing.

Table 4: Confusion matrix of the GRU512 on the word level with POS tag in L2 testing.

Figure 4 shows the accuracies of the n-gram, RNN512, and GRU512 models on word level with and 

without POS tag with respect to difference sentence lengths. We divide the sentences in L2 test set into 

five groups according to their length. The average sentence length is 9.13 words, and the longest sen-

tence consists of 32 words. The information of POS tag generally improves the performance for the 

cases of longer sentences. In particular, the GRU512 model on word-level with POS tag outperforms 

other models for the sentences of lengths ≥ 4 words. In the test set of L2, only 10 sentences (1.3%) are 

shorter than 4 words.

(S7) is an instance correctly predicted by the GRU512 model, while n-gram and RNN512 output a wrong 

outcome as (S8). In this case, the first word 在 (zài, “in”) and the last word裡 (lǐ, “inside”) form a 

circumposition for the noun phrase那些保守的家庭 (those conservative family). The pair of words 

在... 裡 (inside) is a common usage in Chinese. The GRU512 model successfully captures their depend-

ency although there are four words in-between.

(S9) shows a much longer distance dependency successfully estimated by GRU512. In this case, there 

are eight words in-between the word pair 以...為 (aim at ... as). The RNN512 selects 就 (jiù, “just/on”) in 

the sentence (S10), which is not fluent. The n-gram model, even worse, selects 在 (zài, “in”) and makes 

an incomprehensible sentence (S11).

Figure 5 illustrates accuracies of varying order of the n-gram on character level, word level, and word 

level with POS tag. Results of L1 and L2 testing are shown in Figure 5(a) and Figure 5(b), respectively.

As the order of n-gram increases, the models on word level and on word level with POS tag faster growth. 

In L1 testing, the n-gram model on character level finally achieves an accuracy close those of other two 

models on word level. In L2 testing, the performance gaps among the three models are more apparent.

The information of Chinese word segmentation and POS tags not only speeds up training, but also im-

proves the generalization.

Previous work suggests that the ensemble of RNN and traditional language model may improve the 

performance, especially for the RNN models with small hidden layer (Mikolov, 2012; Mikolov et al., 

2011). We build an ensemble model GRU-ME by joint training the GRU model with a 4-gram maximum 

entropy language model (Berger et al., 1996). The input unit is word with POS tag (w/p), which has best 

performance in the experiments. The feature size of maximum entropy model is 1 billion. Figure 6

compares the performances between GRU and GRU-ME in L1 and L2. In L1 testing, ensembling the 

maximum entropy model with GRU significantly increases the performances of three GRU models, 

especially the ones with smaller hidden layer. In L2 testing, ensembling the maximum entropy model 

increases the performances of the GRU model with hidden sizes of 128. The results confirm that the 

RNN models with smaller hidden size gain from the combination of the traditional language model. The 

performances of the GRU models with larger hidden layer, however, are decreased with the combination 

of maximum entropy model and GRU. This phenomenon suggests that GRU-ME better fits the training 

data, but may suffer from overfitting. In contrast, the GRU model with a large hidden size is more robust 

when it is applied to another corpus.

and L2 testing.

8 Conclusion

This work addresses the issue of Chinese preposition selection. We propose a method that uses language 

models to predict the most probable preposition in a given context. The classical n-gram models and the 

recurrent neural network models are explored. For the task of modelling Chinese prepositions, the ex-

perimental results show the advantage of the GRU models over simple RNN and n-gram models, espe-

cially for the cases involving longer distance dependency. In addition, linguistic information from Chi-

nese word segmentation and the POS tagging improve the performances of n-gram and neural network

language models. We will further adapt this approach to detection and correction for other grammatical 

errors in future work.
