Abstract 

Pragmatics —the aspects of text that signal in-

terpersonal and situational information, comple-

menting semantics— has been almost totally ig-

nored in Natural Language Processing.  But in 

the past five to eight years there has been a surge 

of research on the general topic of ‘opinion’, also 

called ‘sentiment’.   Generally, research focuses 

on the determining the author’s opi-

nion/sentiment about some topic within a given 

fragment of text.  Since opinions may differ, it is 

granted that the author’s opinion is ‘subjective’, 

and the effectiveness of an opinion-

determination system is measured by comparing 

against a gold-standard set of human annotations.   

But what does ‘subjectivity’ actually mean?  

What are ‘opinion’ and ‘sentiment’?  Lately, re-

searchers are also starting to talk about ‘affect’, 

and even ‘emotion’.  What are these notions, and 

how do they differ from one another?   

Unfortunately, a survey of the research done 

to date shows a disturbing lack of clarity on these 

questions.  Very few papers bother to define their 

terms, but simply take a set of valences such as 

Good–Neutral–Bad to be sufficient.  More recent 

work acknowledges the need to specify what the 

opinion actually applies to, and attempts also to 

determine the theme. Lately, several identify the 

holder of the opinion.  Some even try to estimate 

the strength of the expressed opinion.   

The trouble is, the same aspect of the same ob-

ject can be considered Good by one person and 

Bad by another, and we can often understand 

both their points of view.  There is much more to 

opinion/sentiment than simply matching words 

and phrases that attach to the theme, and compu-

ting a polarity score.  People give reasons why 

they like or dislike something, and these reasons 

pertain to their goals and plans in the case of 

opinions) or their deeper emotional states (in the 

case of affect).   

In this talk I outline a model of senti-

ment/opinion and of affect, and show that they 

appear in text in a fairly structured way, with 

various components.  I show how proper under-

standing requires the reader to build some kind 

of person profile of the author, and claim that for 

systems to do adequate understanding of senti-

ments, opinions, and affects, they will need to do 

so as well.  This is not a trivial challenge, and it 

opens the door to a whole new line of research 

with many fascinating and practical aspects.
