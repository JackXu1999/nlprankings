Abstract 

 
In this paper, we propose TunDiaWN 
(Tunisian dialect Wordnet) a lexical re-
source for the dialect language spoken in 
Tunisia. Our TunDiaWN construction 
approach is founded, in one hand, on a 
corpus based method to analyze and ex-
tract Tunisian dialect words. A clustering 
technique is adapted and applied to mine 
the possible relations existing between 
the Tunisian dialect extracted words and 
to group them into meaningful groups. 
All these suggestions are then evaluated 
and validated by the experts to perform 
the resource enrichment task. We reuse 
other Wordnet versions, mainly for Eng-
lish and Arabic language to propose a 
new database structure enriched by inno-
vative features and entities. 

1 Introduction 

The Arabic Dialects have become increasingly 
used in social networks and web 2.0 (blogs, fo-
rums, newspaper, newsgroups, etc.) instead of 
Standard Arabic (SA).  
Consequently, new kinds of texts appeared being 
mainly dialect-written or having a mixture be-
tween Arabic Dialects and Standard Arabic. 
Thus, innovative opportunities and challenges 
arise when we try to deal with the automatic pro-
cessing of such data in order to seek out useful 
information and take advantages of their growing 
availability and popularity. The NLP approaches 
generally applied lexical resources for the target 
language. Such resources are useful in several 

tasks which involve a language meaning under-
standing like: opinion mining (Kim et al., 2004; 
Bouchlaghem et al. 2010), information retrieval 
(Valeras et al., 2005; Rosso et al., 2004), query 
expansion (Parapar et al., 2005), text categoriza-
tion (Rosso et al., 2004; Ramakrishnan et al., 
2003), and many other applications. 
However, this situation poses significant difficul-
ties in the context of dialectal data because of the 
huge lack of Dialect-Standard Arabic lexical re-
sources. Building similar ones is a big challenge 
since spoken dialects are not officially written, 
don’t have a standard orthography and are con-
sidered as under-resourced languages, unlike 
standard languages.  
In this paper, we address the problem of creating 
a linguistic resource for an Arabic dialect. We 
describe our approach towards building a Word-
net for Tunisian dialect (TD). We proceed, first-
ly, to construct a TD corpus by collecting data 
from various resources (social networks, web-
sites, TD dictionaries, etc.). We develop a clus-
tering based method that aims to organize the TD 
corpus words by grouping them into clusters. 
The suggested organization possibilities are, 
then, analyzed and validated by the TD experts 
during the TunDiaWN enrichment process. Our 
proposed database structure is designed to be 
able to highlight the specificities of the TD lexi-
con. It also takes advantage of Arabic Wordnet 
(AWN) (Elkateb et al., 2006), the Arabic version 
of the widely used lexico-semantic resource 
Princeton WordNet (PWN) (Fellbaum, 1998). 
This can be justified by the assumption that Tu-
nisian Arabic has a great resemblance with 
Standard Arabic.  
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: we 
begin by presenting works related to existing 
wordnets and approaches focused on the auto-

matic processing of the Tunisian dialect. We then 
introduce the posed challenges and the hypothe-
sis we have assumed in building the TunDiaWN. 
In the next section, we proceed to explain and 
justify the proposed approach for developing the 
initial version of the Tunisian Arabic lexical re-
source. Firstly, we detail the TD data collect pro-
cess and the MultiTD corpus construction. Sec-
ondly, we present the method developed to sug-
gest possible organizations of TD words extract-
ed from the corpus. Then, we describe the pro-
posed structure of TunDiaWN, especially the 
new added features and entities as well as the 
validation task performed by the TD experts. In 
the following section, we perform a linguistic 
analysis by reporting significant observations 
related to TD-SA discovered during the enrich-
ment process. Conclusion and future works are 
presented in section 5. 

2 Related works 

The first version of wordnet (Fellbaum, 1998) 
was developed for English at Princeton Universi-
ty. It’s a large lexical database where words hav-
ing the same part of speech (Nouns, verbs, adjec-
tives, adverbs) are gathered in sets of cognitive 
synonyms (synsets), each one expressing a dis-
tinct concept. Each word can belong to one or 
more synsets. The resulting synsets are connect-
ed by means of conceptual-semantic and lexical 
relations well labeled such as hyponymy and an-
tonymy.  
The success of the Princeton WordNet has moti-
vated the development of similar resources for 
other languages, such as EuroWordNet, EWN 
(Vossen, 1998) interlinking wordnets of several 
European languages (Dutch, Italian, Spanish, 
German, French, Czech and Estonian); Balkanet 
(Tufis, 2004) comprising wordnets of the Balkan 
languages; and recently Arabic Wordnet (AWN) 
(Elkateb et al., 2006). 
AWN was released following methods devel-
oped for EuroWordNet. These methods revolve 
about the manual encoding of a set of Common 
Base Concepts (CBC), the most important con-
cepts from the 12 languages in EWN and Bal-
kaNet. Other language-specific concepts are add-
ed and translated manually to the closest syn-
set(s) in Arabic. Such resource aims to link ara-
bic words and synsets to english ones.  
AWN is related to the Classical Arabic              
(or Literal Arabic) which refers to the official 
standard form of the Arabic language used in 
Arab world. Other variants of Arabic are dialects 

which are spoken and informal. They are the 
primary form of Arabic Language.  
The Tunisian dialect (cf. Table 1) or ‘Darija’ is 
one of the Maghreb Dialects and is mainly spo-
ken by Tunisian people (Baccouche, 1994).

Most of the works that dealt with the automatic 
processing of Tunisian dialect are based on spo-
ken dialogue corpus. To mention, Graja et al.  
(2011) performed a lexical study of manual tran-
scription of conversations recorded in the railway 
station for understanding speech. The application 
is domain dependant and, thus, the vocabulary is 
limited. Moreover, Zribi et al. (2013) introduced 
a lexicon for the Tunisian dialect in order to 
adapt an existing morphological analyzer initial-
ly designed for Standard Arabic.  Although the 
method shows good results, the proposed lexicon 
is far to be complete. Boujelbane et al. (2013) 
presented a method that aims to construct bilin-
gual dictionary using explicit knowledge about 
the relation between Tunisian dialect and Stand-
ard Arabic. This approach was limited to the 
verbs. 

3 Challenges 

In the last years, Tunisian dialect is widely used 
in new written media and web 2.0, especially in 
social networks, blogs, forums, weblogs, etc., in 
addition to conversational media (Diab et al., 
2007). 
Thinking about building a wordnet for Tunisian 
dialect is a big challenge. In fact, like most of 
dialects around the world, Tunisian Arabic is 
considered as spoken language with no conven-
tional written form. Moreover, there is a lack of 
Tunisian dialect-Standard Arabic resources and 
tools.  
Recently, Cavalli-Sforza et al. (2013) proposed a 
process for creating a basic Iraqi Dialect Word-
Net. This work is based on other languages 
wordnets as well as a bidirectional English-Iraqi 
Arabic dictionary. To our knowledge, no other 
open source Wordnet for the Standard Arabic or 
Arabic Dialect has been developed to date. 
To deal with these difficulties, we decide to pro-
duce a TD corpus gathering texts from multiple 

105



sources. This corpus provides a useful starting 
point for building a wordnet for Tunisian dialect.  
We assume that Arabic Dialects can be presumed 
to be similar to Standard Arabic, particularly in 
their conceptual organization. Indeed, the Tuni-
sian dialect has a sophisticated form which com-
bines Standard Arabic and Tunisian dialect spe-
cific forms.  It has a great resemblance to the SA 
and adds some variances such as foreign words 
borrowed from other languages. Thus, given the 
similarities between the TD and the SA, the re-
sources available to SA, such as AWN, can be 
favorably used for creating Tunisian dialectal 
resources.  

4 Proposed approach for TunDiaWN 
construction 

The classical building WordNets methodologies 
start from the CBC, and then make changes     
according to the concerned language.  
We propose a new corpus-based approach to cre-
ate WordNet resource for Tunisian dialect, which 
deviates from the strategies commonly adopted. 
As shows Figure 1, our approach is performed in 
four steps: 

a. Tunisian dialect textual data collect: it con-
sists in producing our MultiTD corpus (Mul-
ti-source Tunisian dialect corpus) which 
gathers TD texts from many sources: social 
networks (Twitter, Facebook, etc.), written   
pieces  of theater, dictionaries, transcriptions  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of spontaneous speech, etc. 

b. TD words extraction: is to preprocess the 
produced corpus in order to preserve useful 
data and extract TD words. 

c. TD words clustering: we propose here a clus-
tering based method that aims to group the 
extracted TD words into meaningful clusters, 
which represent great suggestions for possible 
enrichments of TunDiaWN. 

d. TunDiaWN enrichment: this step is performed 
by the TD experts. It includes the manual val-
idation of the suggestions proposed by the 
previous step. We propose, in this stage, a 
new database structure for TunDiaWN. The 
experts have to add the necessary features 
values, particularly the TD specific attributes 
(details in section 4.4). 

4.1 TD data collection and MultiTD corpus 
presentation  

We set out to collect data for Tunisian dialect in 
order to address the general lack of resources, on 
the one hand, and to produce a multi source    
corpus, on the other.  
We created the MultiTD corpus by gathering TD 
data from diverse sources.   
The most practical source of TD texts is online 
data, which is more individual-driven and less 
formal, and consequently more likely to com-
prise dialectal contents.

We automatically collected a great amount of TD 
texts from user’s comments and status from 
Twitter, Facebook and TripAdviser. 

We have implemented three specific modules:  
• TwtterCollecter based on Twitter4j java  api, 
• FacebookAspirator using a PHP script and a 

Facebook account developer, 
• TripadvisorScreen a java module to analyze 

Tripadvisor web pages and extract comments 
forms. 

Manual transcriptions of TD recorded spontane-
ous speech are also added to the MultiTD corpus. 
Such data allows highlighting the Tunisian ac-
cent in the dialogue and, therefore, enriching the 
corpus by new varieties of the TD lexicon. 
Other online available TD resources are used to 
enrich the MultiTD corpus. We cite notably, the 
Karmous dictionary for Tunisian Arabic1 which 
comprises more than 3,800 TD words and sever-
al Tunisian proverbs and expressions organized 
by themes.  
We use also an online TD dictionary 2 consisting 
of over 4,000 words and expressions; and many 
short TD texts3 related to various areas: songs, 
theater, newspaper articles, etc. 

4.2 TD words extraction 

To successfully extract all TD words, the input 
texts must be preprocessed. In our study, the pre-
processing consists, firstly, to clean the input 
files so as to identify the textual content. The 
cleaned texts are then segmented in order to ex-
tract all existing TD words. 
Cleaning a raw textual source is necessary in our 
approach because the documents are collected 
from the Web. All non-textual data such as im-
ages, advertisements, scripts, etc. have to be 
eliminated. For this purpose, we have developed 
a module that removes all unwanted parts from 
the input documents.  

The cleaned texts are then segmented into ele-
mentary textual units and the obtained TD words 
are extracted and stored in CSV files. 

The Table 2 gives statistics about the TD words 
composing the MultiTD corpus.

4.3 TD words clustering using k-modes   
algorithm 

The TunDiaWN construction is based on a semi-
automatic process in which the validation tasks 
performed by experts are crucial.  
As Table 2 Shows, the MultiTD corpus includes 
a huge number of TD words. The manual analy-
sis and organization of such large data looks 
wasteful and time consuming.  
In order to support experts in the organization 
and validation tasks and guide them during the 
construction process, we propose a clustering-
based method to automatically arrange the TD 
words set into groups. The method aims to sug-
gest possible organizations of the given TD 
words by gathering them into meaningful clus-
ters. 
To enhance similarities and meanings into the 
produced groups, we propose to cluster the TD 
words according to their TD roots. We rely here 
on the derivational morphology that characteriz-
es the Tunisian dialect as well as the Standard 
Arabic.  
In fact, many SA words having a common root 4 
can be derived from a base verbal form and have 
related meanings. An example of such a field for 
the root درس, ‘to study,’ is shown in Table 3.

 verb study َدَرسَ 
سَ   verb teach َدرَّ
 noun teaching �َْ�ِر��

Table 3. Some derivatives of Arabic root 
 (Elkateb et al., 2006) ”درس“

In the same context, the TD morphology is deri-
vational too (cf. Table 4).  

Taking advantage of this central characteristic, 
the set of TD words can be organized into dis-
tinct semantic groups according to the TD roots 
from which they are derived. The list of TD roots

We don’t search here to automatically enrich the 
TunDiaWN structure by attaching new TD 
words, but we rather suggest new attachments 
and enrichment possibilities which can help the 
experts. 
Our aim at this step is to group words having the 
same root. To do this task, we apply and adapt 
the K-modes clustering algorithm (Huang, 1997).  
The K-modes algorithm extends K-means (For-
gy, 1965; MacQueen, 1967) paradigm to cluster 
categorical data by removing the numeric data 
limitation. Indeed, the K-modes algorithm intro-
duces a new simple matching dissimilarity meas-
ure for categorical data objects. The algorithm 
replaces means of clusters with modes, and uses 
a frequency based method to update modes in the 
clustering process. 
The choice of K-modes clustering algorithm is 
mainly motivated because of its widely use in 
real world applications due to its efficiency in 
dealing with large categorical database (He et al., 
2011). K-modes algorithm is also faster than oth-
er clustering algorithms (mainly k-means) since 
it needs less iteration to produce a stable distribu-
tion. . 
 The K-modes algorithm requires a similarity 
measurement to be used between the objects. In 
our case, we propose to use the N-Gram similari-
ty measurement between words. N-Gram is lan-
guage independent in nature and doesn’t require 
specific resources to be applied. Therefore, N-
gram model seems suitable for dealing with a 
Tunisian dialect context. We applied the N-Gram 
distance proposed by Kondrak (2005) and we 
used the implementation provided by Apache 
Lucene spellchecking API5.  

The K-modes algorithm consists of the following 
steps:  

a) Select K initial modes, one for each of the 
cluster. 

                                                 
5 The project can be freely obtained from:  
http://lucene.apache.org/core/ 
 

b) Allocate data object to the cluster whose mode 
is nearest to it, according to the simple matching 
dissimilarity  
c) Compute new modes of all clusters. 
d) Repeat step b to c until no data object has 
changed cluster membership. 

The classical K-modes algorithm assumes that 
the number of clusters, K, is known in advance 
and the clusters’ modes are randomly initialized. 
The K-modes algorithm is very sensitive to these 
choices and an improper choice may then yield 
highly undesirable cluster structures. (Khan et 
al., 2013). 
In order to deal with these drawbacks and, there-
after, maximize the performance of the algo-
rithm, we propose a new initialization strategy 
for the k-modes algorithm.  
Indeed, since our goal is to cluster words accord-
ing to their roots, the TD roots are assigned to 
clusters modes in the initialization step instead of 
random initialization. The number of clusters (K) 
will, thus, take the cardinality of the target TD 
roots set. Therefore, the K-modes algorithm 
starts with k clusters each having as mode one 
root among the TD roots list initially translated.  
We have also adopted a new strategy based on 
the N-Gram similarity measurement to update 
clusters’ modes. The modes update is performed 
at the end of each iteration. For each cluster, the 
item qualified as new cluster mode must maxim-
ize the similarity sum with the rest of cluster ob-
jects. 

The K-modes algorithm adapted for our purpose 
performs as following:  

a. Initialization 
K = |set of TD roots| 
Initial modes = TD roots, one for each of the 
cluster. 

b. Allocate each word (itmi) of TD words set to 
the cluster Clusters whose mode ModeCLs is 
nearest to it according to the equation (1) : 

   
ModeCLs=argmin     (1-simNGram(itmi, ModeCLs)) 

 
c. Update modes of all clusters  :

After performing the new proposed version of 
the k mode algorithm, the obtained results are 
suggested to be validated by the TD experts in 
order to enrich TunDiaWN structure, which will 
be presented in the next section. 

4.4 TD groups’ validation and TunDiaWN 
enrichment 

In this section, we begin by describing the pro-
posed structure of TunDiaWN. After that, we 
detail the enrichment task performed by the TD 
experts. Then, we present a linguistic study per-
formed during the enrichment process. 

TunDiaWN structure 

As our target language is an Arabic Dialect and 
therefore likely to share many of the Standard 
Arabic concepts, we decide to preserve the AWN 
design. However, the AWN current structure is 
unable to support the specificities of the Tunisian 
dialect lexicon. The proposed TunDiaWN struc-
ture is then enriched by new features, entities and 
relations. Moreover, we aim to create a parallel 
resource which maintains the linkage between 
Tunisian dialectal, Arabic as well as English 
synsets and words. That’s why AWN and PWN 
contents are preserved rather than the structures. 
Thus, the proposed database is designed to be 
able to support English, Tunisian and Standard 
Arabic content and correspondence.  
In this section, we detail the structure of the pro-
posed TunDiaWN database and we focus on the 
new features we added to keep up the TD vocab-
ulary particularities, compared to the SA and 
English ones.  

TWN entity types 

The database structure incorporates mainly the 
following entity types: synset, word, form, synset 
relations, words relations, annotator: 

 

Synset: includes English and Arabic synsets. A 
synset has descriptive information such as Name, 
POS (Part Of Speech), root (Boolean feature in-
dicating if the target synset is a root or not).  

Word: comprises words from different lan-
guages. In addition to the unique identifier, every 
word is described by his value, and a Boolean  
“valid” attribute which indicates if one word is 
already validated by experts or not yet. 

Form: includes mainly the root of Arabic as well 
as Tunisian dialect words.  

Synsets relations: includes links relating two 
synsets, like “has_instance”, “equivalent”,   
“similar”, etc. We preserve here all sunsets’ links 
without adding new ones.   

Words relations: two English words can be 
linked by “pertainym” or “antonym” relations. 
There are no added Arabic words relations. 

Annotator: is used to indicate who has validated 
each word. The attribute “region” helps to classi-
fy words by region and identify where words 
come from. We assume here that the annotator 
will do his job according to the background of 
his native region. 

TunDiaWN new features 

Since the Tunisian dialect is not a standard lan-
guage, new features are required to be added to 
the TunDiaWN resource in order to preserve the 
TD specificities. We describe below the most 
important TD characteristics integrated in the 
proposed resource:  

SMS language 

In the context of Tunisian dialect, the SMS lan-
guage is a written form which combines Latin 
script and some numbers in order to express dia-
lectal words.  
The SMS language is widely used especially in 
social networks and blogs. 
Table 5 gives examples of the most used num-
bers which aim to replace specific Arabic letters.   
TD words are illustrated with Latin Script (Lat-
in), Arabic Letters (Ar-L) and using translitera-
tion6.

Foreign words 

The use of foreign words is a prominent feature 
in the Tunisian community due to historical rea-
sons. Foreign words are used in almost everyday 
conversation. 

The following table (table 6) illustrates the use of 
foreign words next to Tunisian dialect ones in the 
same sentence.

Table 6. Examples of French words widely used 
in TD communications 

 A TD corpus study found that pure French 
origin words are ubiquitous and represent 
11.81% of the dialogue corpus (Graja et al, 
2010). 
Tunisian dialect can also borrow and adapt 
words from other languages in order to make 
them sound and behave like TD words.  
As an illustration, the TD word “ �ْ�ِ��َْ��ْ/ tonarofi-
yzo” is derived from the French word “ner-
vosité” and is synonym to the English word “an-
ger”.  

As can be seen, the foreign words are part of the 
Tunisian dialect vocabulary. Such words must 
not be neglected. They must be added to any dic-
tionary of Tunisian dialect lexicon (Graja et al. 
2010). 
The foreign words used with their original forms 
are added to the TunDiaWN database.  
Concerning the TD words having foreign origins, 
they are firstly distinguished from other TD 
words. The second step consists in finding the  
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

origin words in other languages, saving them and 
linking them to the concerned TD words. Conse-
quently, the borrowed TD words are easily iden-
tified. Their basic language and words are 
straightforwardly found and browsed.  

Morphology 

Since the Tunisian dialect has no standard or-
thography, one word can be written in many 
forms using Arabic letters or Latin script. For 
example, the word "will" can be expressed in 
different ways: “bech”/ “ َْ�ش�”, “bich” /“ ْ�ِ�”, 
“mich”/“ ْ��ِ”. 
To deal with this situation, our database structure 
is enriched by a new entity named “morphology” 
which allows storing all versions of a given TD 
word. 

Sub-dialect group  

There are many varieties of Tunisian dialect tak-
ing into account the lexical variation depending 
on Tunisian regions.  We can distinguish mainly 
three sub-dialects in the dialect of each region: 
the townspeople, peasants/farmers, Be-Douin. 
This is mainly due to the difference in cultures 
which adds several different words from differ-
ent backgrounds having the same meaning. (Gra-
ja et al, 2010). The feature “sub-dialect” as well 
as the “Region” of the annotator are used to give 
further information about the origin of the target 
word. 
The TD words: “$aAf/ ْف��َ”, “roEaY/� َْر”, 
“$obaH/ ْ!َ"�ْ”, “gozar/ ْ#َ�رْ   ”, are used in different 
Tunisian regions and are synonyms< to the Eng-

One of our strategic goals is to provide a parallel 
resource which deal with the lack of parallel TD-
SA dictionaries and corpus. Therefore, we pro-
ceed by gathering Tunisian dialect and Standard 
Arabic in one unique structure and maintain the 
link with the Standard English too.  
The starting point of the TunDiaWN enrichment 
step is the groups of TD words, resulted of per-

forming our clustering based method.  The TD 
roots presumed to be the center of groups are 
obtained by translating the SA roots available in 
AWN. 
For each TD root, the SA words related to the 
equivalent SA root are extracted. Two lists of 
words derived from equivalent roots are availa-
ble:  one is related to a SA root, and the other is 
from a TD one. The concerned SA synsets are 
also available. 
After that, the TD experts analyze and confront 
the lists in order to find new synsets enrichment 
opportunities.  The TD words qualified to be re-
tained are those maximizing the synset harmony. 
The TD experts must also fill in the necessary 
attributes related to the added words and manual-
ly make the necessary changes and enrichments.  
In fact, the added words have to be described 
according to the new features added to the Tun-
DiaWN database, so as to bring different 
knowledge of different vocabularies and give all 
useful details related to the target word. 

Linguistic study of the enriched Tun-
DiaWN 

The linguistic study of the enrichment possibili-
ties validated by the TD experts shows many 
important lexical trends in the TD lexicon com-
paring to the SA vocabulary.   
A great part of Arabic synsets is enriched by 
words that conserve the same SA roots and deri-
vation patterns but appear with small changes in 
vowels (cf. table 7).

Table 7. Example of TD words having SA roots 

and derivation patterns 

We distinguish also words derived from SA roots  
via the application of specific derivation patterns 
of TD (cf. table 8). Those words are omnipresent 
in the TD lexicon. 

Moreover, some TD words has identical mor-
phologies comparing to other SA words, but the 
meaning is far to be similar (cf. table 9).

Table 9. Examples of TD words having similar 
SA morphologies and different meanings 

There is another category of TD words which are 
very similar to SA words, but use a different 
preposition.  

For example, the SA word “ ِب  َ%َّ"'ََ�/ttasab~aba 
bi”, which means “to cause”, has an equivalent 
TD word “�ِ� %ِّْ"'َ�ْ/tsab~ib fiy” with just different 
vowels and new preposition. 

 
In some cases, the SA words are linked to TD 
expressions which have the same meaning, since 
there are no TD simple equivalent words, as il-
lustrates the following table:

Table 10. TD expressions equivalent to SA

We deduce from this study and the given exam-
ples that the Tunisian dialect is marked by a lexi-
cal variety which escapes from the standard rules 
of the Standard Arabic.  

5 Conclusion and future works 

We have described an approach for building a 
Tunisian dialect lexical resource which takes ad-
vantages of online TD resources and reuses 
Wordnets of other languages.  
The proposed TunDiaWN can be considered as 
parallel TD-SA resource since it preserves the 
AWN content. Thanks to the novel added TD 
attributes, the TunDiaWN design provides, also, 
great opportunities to deal with the lack of a 
standard written form and other specificities of 
the Tunisian dialect. 
The construction process begins with the Mul-
tiTD corpus construction from many sources. 
After preprocessing the collected texts, the TD 
extracted words are gathered according to their 
common TD roots.

Our aim at this level is to support the TD experts 
in the database enrichment task, by giving sug-
gestions of the possible TD words organizations. 
Now, the proposed TD resource is under con-
struction and evaluation. We plan to improve the 
coverage of TunDiaWN and looking for other 
TD specificities not yet covered. We plan also to 
incorporate the French language into the Tun-
DiaWN content, taking advantages of the availa-
ble lexical French resource WOLF (Sagot and 
Fišer, 2008).
