Abstract

The US National Science Foundation (NSF) SI2-funded LAPPS Grid project has developed an
open-source platform for enabling complex analyses while hiding complexities associated with
underlying infrastructure, that can be accessed through a web interface, deployed on any Unix
system, or run from the cloud. It provides sophisticated tool integration and history capabili-
ties, a workflow system for building automated multi-step analyses, state-of-the-art evaluation
capabilities, and facilities for sharing and publishing analyses. This paper describes the current
facilities available in the LAPPS Grid and outlines the project’s ongoing activities to enhance the
framework.

1 Introduction

The US National Science Foundation (NSF) SI2-funded LAPPS Grid project is a collaborative effort
among Vassar College, Brandeis University, Carnegie-Mellon University (CMU), and the Linguistic
Data Consortium (LDC) at the University of Pennsylvania. The LAPPS Grid is an open-source plat-
form for enabling complex analyses while hiding complexities associated with underlying infrastructure.
The platform can be accessed through a web interface, deployed on any Unix system, or run from the
cloud. It provides sophisticated tool integration and history capabilities, a workflow system for build-
ing automated multi-step analyses, state-of-the-art evaluation capabilities, and facilities for sharing and
publishing analyses. The LAPPS Grid is highly customizable and integrates with a wide variety of com-
puting environments, ranging from laptop computers to clusters to compute clouds. The LAPPS Grid is
part of the Federated Grid of Language Services (FGLS) (Ishida et al., 2014), a multi-lingual, interna-
tional network of web service grids and providers in Asia and Europe, and is currently federating with
two major frameworks in the pan-European CLARIN project. Through these federations, LAPPS Grid
users have interoperable access to all the tools and modules in the other platforms, thus creating the
largest network of interoperable components for language-related analysis and activity in the world.

This paper describes the current facilities available in the LAPPS Grid, which have been continually
expanded over the past year, and provides an overview of the ways in which the LAPPS Grid compares
to similar frameworks. We also outline the project’s ongoing activities to enhance the framework, in
particular its collaboration with the developers of the Galaxy framework and creation of educational
materials.

2 Current facilities

The LAPPS Grid currently provides a broad suite of interoperable Human Language Technologies (HLT)
tools and data, and provides facilities for service discovery, service composition (including automatic
format conversion between tools where necessary), performance evaluation (via provision of component-
level measures for standard evaluation metrics for component-level and end-to-end measurement), and
resource delivery for a range of language resources, including holdings of the Linguistic Data Consortium
(LDC).1 The list of HLT processing tools and resources currently available in the LAPPS Grid can be
found at http://www.lappsgrid.org/language-services and includes dozens of the most commonly used
HLT toolkits. In addition, through our federation with international partners, LAPPS Grid users have (or
will soon have) access to hundreds of multi-lingual and multi-modal tools, applications, evaluation tools,
lexicons, and data sources2.

The key feature of the LAPPS Grid that differentiates it from most other platforms is the interoper-
ability among tools and services, which is achieved through adoption of standard protocols and formats
together with the development of additional standards for interchange. Syntactic interoperability among
LAPPS Grid services is ensured by a JSON-LD format called the LAPPS Interchange Format (LIF) that
groups annotations in views, where each view contains metadata that spells out the information con-
tained in that view, including information necessary to determine compatibility with other tools and data.
Semantic interoperability is achieved via references to definitions in the Web Services Exchange Vocab-
ulary (WSEV). The WSEV has been built bottom up, driven by the needs of components in the LAPPS
Grid and closely following standard practice in the field as well as adopting, where possible, existing
terminology and type systems. Both LIF and the WSEV are described in detail elsewhere (Verhagen et
al., 2016; Ide et al., 2014; Ide et al., 2016).

Another distinctive feature of the LAPPS Grid is its Open Advancement (OA) Evaluation system,
a sophisticated environment that was used to develop IBM’s Jeopardy-winning Watson. OA can be
simultaneously applied to multiple variant workflows involving alternative tools for a given task, and the
results are evaluated and displayed so that the best possible configuration is readily apparent. Similarly,
the weak links in a chain are easily detected, which can lead to module-specific improvements that
affect the entire process. The inputs, tools, parameters and settings used for each step in an analysis are
recorded, thereby ensuring that each result can be exactly reproduced and reviewed later, and any tool
configuration can be repeatedly applied to different data.

Several HLT software developers and projects have contributed their components and systems for in-
clusion in the LAPPS Grid, in order to provide exposure of these tools to a wide user audience and,
crucially, to render them interoperable with other tools in the LAPPS Grid, thus allowing for their
immediate inclusion in workflows supporting sophisticated applications as well as evaluation of their
performance side-by-side with comparable components. Although many contributors host their own
contributed services (which are called from within the LAPPS Grid), where necessary the LAPPS Grid
provides hosting to ensure that software remains available to the community. Recently contributed tools
include all core tools from University of Darmstadt’s DKPro3, the AIFdb services for Argumentation
analysis4 (Lawrence et al., 2012), the SWIFT Aligner for cross-lingual transfer (Gilmanov et al., 2014),
the EDISON feature extraction framework5 (Sammons et al., 2016) and other tools available from the
University of Illinois (e.g., semantic role labelers, entity extractors), among others. In addition, several of
the basic components produced by the ARIEL team working within DARPA’s Low Resource Languages
for Emergent Incidents (LORELEI) program have been integrated into the LAPPS Grid, which include
tools and data to support a wide array of under-resourced languages.

The LAPPS Grid has been adopted by a Mellon-funded project at the University of Illinois, which
is utilizing the platform to apply sophisticated HLT text mining methods to the HathiTrust Research

Center’s (HTRC) massive digital library)6, in order enhance search and discovery across the library
by complementing traditional volume-level bibliographic metadata with new metadata, using specially-
developed LAPPS Grid-based CL applications. Finally, we are currently working with IBM to integrate
its Watson services into the LAPPS Grid so that they will be available for community use for the first
time, and interoperate with the very wide range of HLT modules the LAPPS Grid provides. This will
open the door to rapid evaluation of alternative component pipelines using state-of-the-art metrics and
procedures.

The LAPPS Grid uses Docker7, a recently developed and increasingly popular virtualization platform,
as a way to distribute and deploy the complete LAPPS Grid or parts thereof. Docker images are com-
pletely self-contained: users can download docker images and run them on their own servers or laptops or
in the cloud without the need to install supporting components. We currently have several docker virtual
servers running versions of the LAPPS Grid on Amazon Web Services and JetStream (http://jetstream-
cloud.org).

To provide an intuitive, easy-to-use interface and management system, the LAPPS Grid project
adopted the Galaxy framework (Giardine et al., 2005), a robust, well-developed platform that includes
tool integration and history capabilities. together with a workflow system for building automated multi-
step analyses, a visualization framework including visual analysis capabilities, and facilities for sharing
and publishing analyses (Goecks et al., 2012). In addition to providing an intuitive user interface for
workflow composition appropriate for non-technical users, Galaxy also provides support for replication
of experiments and sharing of methods and results via automatic recording of all inputs, tools, param-
eters and settings in an experiment and provisions for sharing datasets, histories, and workflows via
web links.8 Replication capabilities are a vital need in the field of HLT, which has been plagued by a
chronic lack of potential for replicability and reuse described in several recent publications (Pedersen,
2008; Fokkens et al., 2013), blogs9, and workshops10. Facilities for reproducibility also enable users to
develop organized catalogs of reusable workflows, rather than starting from scratch each time or trying
to navigate a collection of ad hoc analysis scripts, and/or apply a command history to different data.

We have contributed Galaxy wrappers to call all LAPPS Grid web services to the Galaxy ToolShed11.
The enables user to create a LAPPS/Galaxy instance locally or in the cloud that includes only the Galaxy
“NLP Flavor” (in Galaxy terminology), which comprises all and only LAPPS Grid services and re-
sources, if so desired.

The LAPPS Grid benefits from the Galaxy team’s integration of interactive analysis environments,
including Jupyter (Perez and Granger, 2007) and RStudio (Gandrud, 2013). Jupyter in particular is of
interest to LAPPS Grid users; the LAPPS Grid team has developed a LAPPS Grid Services DSL12 (LSD)
kernel that can be used to interact with the LAPPS Grid services.13 Jupyter Notebooks can contain
executable code and documentation in one location, thus allowing fast templating and prototyping of
services. There is no need to compile Java/Groovy code and deploy services to web servers for evaluation
and testing, thus making it easy for students and non-technical users to develop sophisticated workflows
and/or add their own components with no programming effort. Jupyter also provides “human in the
loop” functionality, by allowing one to run a pipeline in the LAPPS Grid, manipulate the Galaxy history
items in Jupyter, and finally upload the results to Galaxy for further processing. This facility is especially
important for HLT development that involves iterative enhancement of training data on the basis of error
analysis, etc.

3 Comparison with other frameworks

The LAPPS Grid differs from existing frameworks primarily because of the standards for interoperability
it implements to enable components from different sources to be seamlessly interfaced, and the result-
ing ease and transparency with which components can be added and manipulated. Frameworks such
as UIMA and GATE, which also provide multiple tools that can be pipelined together, require a rela-
tively steep learning curve to use and considerable programming effort to add or modify components.
Similarly, the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) requires Python programming and effectively limits the
user to the tools that are built-in to the system. In contrast, modules can be easily added to the LAPPS
Grid by wrapping them as a service, using provided templates; and, more importantly, no programming
experience or technical expertise is required, since workflows are constructed using the Galaxy project’s
workflow management framework. This makes the LAPPS Grid ideal for instructional use.

The recently introduced Kathaa system (Mohanty et al., 2016) provides functionality similar to the
LAPPS Grid, but allows modules to be interfaced only if compatible with one another–i.e., there is no
attempt to standardize inputs and outputs among modules, so that mixing and matching of different tools
that perform the same function is limited. The LAPPS Grid’s Open Advancement evaluation modules,
which exploit the ability to construct alternative pipelines in order produce statistics identifying the most
effective tool sequence and/or components accounting for the largest proportion of error, are also unique;
Kathaa in contrast has only basic evaluation facilities.

Another similar framework is the Alveo system (Cassidy et al., 2014), which also uses Galaxy as its
workflow engine and renders tools interoperable using representations that are the same as, or isomorphic
to, the LAPPS Grid’s. Alveo is dedicated primarily to multi-modal data and applications and therefore
includes a very different suite of modules and datasets; in the future, federating with Alveo could enable
access to its facilities from within the LAPPS Grid.

4 Collaboration with Galaxy

Since the LAPPS Grid project adopted Galaxy in late 2014, we have had multiple interactions with the
Galaxy development team to extend and/or modify Galaxy to meet some of our needs. These interactions
have been so successful and mutually beneficial that our two projects are establishing a collaboration that
will contribute to the continued development of both infrastructures. We believe that the synergistic de-
velopment of capabilities supporting both HLT and genomic analysis within the Galaxy framework could
have a significant impact on both fields, not only by enhancing Galaxy functionality overall, but also by
integrating data, tools, as well as workflows and methods from previously distinct scientific communi-
ties. For example, HLT researchers will benefit from access to sophisticated visualization software for
display and analysis of results common to research in the life sciences, but rarely used in HLT research,
and biologists will be able to take advantage of bio-oriented HLT web services for mining of bio-entities
and relations from textual sources and (via capabilities already present in Galaxy) integrate them into
existing bio-data resources and analysis tools.

There are several key enhancements to Galaxy that are necessary to scale the LAPPS Grid to handle
sophisticated HLT development and education that are synergistic with enhancements that the Galaxy
team is already proposing to benefit life sciences research. These include the ability to efficiently handle
large data collections (i.e., a large number of small datasets, vs. the single large dataset common in
genomics research); and enhanced ability to investigate data using Interactive Environments (IEs), which
is intended to assist life sciences research by allowing for injection of visual analytics in a workflow, but
for HLT would provide “human-in-the-loop” capabilities to support iterative improvement in machine
learning. At the same time, the Galaxy developers have proposed enhancements to their framework
that are already in development for LAPPS Grid tools, for example, automatic management of software
dependencies (both syntactic and semantic), and systematic workflow exploration and optimization, as
provided in our OA evaluation suite of tools. Thus the collaboration can provide significant benefits to
both the HLT and life sciences communities.

The two projects are also working together to create automatic workflow creation capabilities, such as a
“Pipeline Wizard” to provide a wizard-like interface to guide the user through the logical steps in creating

14



instances of known workflow(s); and/or a “Pipeline-via-Dialog” that allows the user to specify the desired
analytic goal in simple English, where the system constructs the desired workflow automatically.

The LAPPS Grid will also benefit from Galaxy’s efforts to expand their access to the Extreme Sci-
ence and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) (Towns et al., 2014) and JetStream, to which the
LAPPS Grid has recently deployed several cloud-based instances for use in courses and specific projects.
The Galaxy team is implementing means to take full advantage of High Performance Computing re-
sources, including parallelization and scaling support, as well as the latest dependency management,
code versioning, and virtualization techniques, all of which will serve LAPPS Grid needs. Our collabo-
ration will ensure that implementation within Galaxy of these and other capabilities that can serve both
disciplines are flexible and scalable to other disciplines’ needs in the future. It will also enable gathering
user feedback from the perspectives of both communities to feed development of both platforms.

4.1 Federation with CLARIN
The Mellon Foundation recently funded a collaborative effort make the LAPPS Grid interoperable with
the pan-European CLARIN project’s WebLicht/Tübingen14 and LINDAT/CLARIN (Prague)15 frame-
works. The effort will create a “trust network” among the LAPPS Grid and CLARIN sites, in order to to
make the services we currently provide, as well as future services we will develop, transparently inter-
operable and mutually accessible from our respective infrastructures. A focus of activity will be to adapt
the LAPPS Grid to accommodate the Shibboleth (SAML 2) protocol in order to allow access to login-
protected (but otherwise generally accessible) content and services by anyone authenticated through the
CLARIN authentication and identification mechanism.

Collaborative access between the LAPPS Grid and CLARIN is achievable largely due to standards and
best practices for interoperability that have emerged over the past decade and that were applied internally
to both the LAPPS Grid and CLARIN. The federation with CLARIN complements the LAPPS Grid’s
membership in the Federated Grid of Language Services (FGLS), which provides interoperable access to
the University of Kyoto’s Language Grid16 and four other Asian grids, plus a grid under development at
the European Language Resources Association (ELRA)17. Through these two federations we have vastly
increased the availability of multi-lingual and multi-modal resources and tools in the LAPPS Grid and
expanded the range of users beyond the HLT community we originally intended to serve, including users
involved in inter-cultural communication and the digital humanities research.

4.2 Course development
The LAPPS Grid team recently developed and delivered a four-day short course on Intelligent Infor-
mation Systems for Analysts, using a purpose-built instance of the LAPPS Grid software deployed in
the cloud. The LAPPS Grid “Discovery” instance supports access to selected corpora from the LDC
Gigaword data source, along with a variety of open-source HLT tools (sentence splitters, named entity
recognizers, passage extractors, passage rankers), and was the focus of hands-on exercises for compara-
tive evaluation of HLT components, composition of analytic pipelines from individual components, and
analytic approaches that can learn from user knowledge and feedback.

Based on this experience, we recognized that the LAPPS Grid is an ideal framework to help students
interact with and design complex HLT systems without the need for sophisticated technical skills. To that
end, we are focusing on the development of curriculum materials to enable students to learn the skills re-
quired to rapidly analyze large bodies of language data in practical contexts, in collaboration with several
partners at universities in the US, Canada, and Europe (Brandeis University, Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity, Vassar College, University of Dundee (Scotland), George Washington University, and University of
British Columbia). The course materials are being designed to effectively teach to a first-year computer
science or computational linguistics student the skills required to create new analytic modules, compose
pipelines integrating those modules, and compare them to pipelines which integrate existing services–all

without the often prohibitive need to acquire and manage data sets and software suites on an individual
basis–within the context of on-line, self-driven, hands-on exercises supported by the LAPPS Grid.

A secondary goal is to effectively teach to a first-year computer science graduate student the skills
required to compose, evaluate and optimize state-of-the-art software solutions using standard datasets,
evaluation metrics and corpora for multi-language, multi-media information systems that process text,
audio, images and video. Providing such a capability for graduate instruction would unlock the potential
of the vast store of data present in repositories such as the Linguistic Data Consortium and the multi-
lingual resources available from federated grids. The end result will be to train the next generation of
HLT researchers, developers, and language analysts, who will use advanced technologies such as the
LAPPS Grid on a regular basis to augment simpler analyses available via web search and the use of
standalone tools.

All course materials will be freely available from the Open Learning Initiative (OLI)18 and a dedicated
repository maintained by the LAPPS Grid project. The materials will be accompanied with ready-made
docker images that can be used as is or easily customized to suit specific pedagogical goals.

5 Enhancement of Open Advancement Evaluation Capabilities

A final focus of current activity is extension of the component and pipeline evaluation capabilities in
the LAPPS Grid to support parallel evaluation and broader adoption by end-user communities. These
include

• parallel exploration of alternative pipelines, drawing on recent work on Configuration Space Explo-
ration (CSE) and Phased Ranking Models (Garduno et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2013; Liu and Nyberg,
2013). We will provide the capability to specify an abstract pipeline with multiple possible compo-
nents per phase, and the corresponding capability to explore the different alternatives automatically
in parallel using the CSE technique.

• accessible display of results, with support for different visualizations for pipeline results (both the
data objects produced by the pipeline as well as the evaluation metrics measured for each pipeline
test).

Our federation with multiple grids and frameworks will make it possible to evaluate the performance
of vast arrays of alternative tool pipelines that would otherwise be unavailable or prohibitively difficult to
use together. It will also provide, for the first time, the capability to study and evaluate tools performance
on data in a huge set of different languages.

6 Future Developments and Conclusion

The LAPPS Grid project is developing in two main directions. First, it is expanding not only the range
of tools, resources, and components available within the framework itself, but also providing access to
hundreds, if not thousands, of resources and tools available from federated partners. Second, it is fo-
cusing on development of cloud-deployed, customizable course materials that can dramatically enhance
the training of the next generation of HLT researchers, and provide significantly improved materials for
non-technical users.

In addition to the above developments, we are also engaging in significant community outreach to
encourage tool developers to contribute to the LAPPS Grid repository, through which process they be-
come interoperable with all other the LAPPS Grid tools and components. Ultimately, by this means and
federation with other grids and frameworks throughout the world, we hope to develop a massive library
of interoperable components for HLT research, development, and education.
