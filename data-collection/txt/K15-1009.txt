Abstract
Word embeddings — distributed word
representations that can be learned from
unlabelled data — have been shown to
have high utility in many natural language
processing applications. In this paper, we
perform an extrinsic evaluation of four
popular word embedding methods in the
context of four sequence labelling tasks:
part-of-speech tagging, syntactic chunk-
ing, named entity recognition, and multi-
word expression identification. A particu-
lar focus of the paper is analysing the ef-
fects of task-based updating of word rep-
resentations. We show that when using
word embeddings as features, as few as
several hundred training instances are suf-
ficient to achieve competitive results, and
that word embeddings lead to improve-
ments over out-of-vocabulary words and
also out of domain. Perhaps more sur-
prisingly, our results indicate there is little
difference between the different word em-
bedding methods, and that simple Brown
clusters are often competitive with word
embeddings across all tasks we consider.

1 Introduction

Recently, distributed word representations have
grown to become a mainstay of natural language
processing (NLP), and have been shown to have
empirical utility in a myriad of tasks (Collobert
and Weston, 2008; Turian et al., 2010; Baroni et
al., 2014; Andreas and Klein, 2014). The un-
derlying idea behind distributed word representa-
tions is simple: to map each word w in vocabu-
lary V onto a continuous-valued vector of dimen-
sionality d � |V |. Words that are similar (e.g.,

with respect to syntax or lexical semantics) will
ideally be mapped to similar regions of the vec-
tor space, implicitly supporting both generalisa-
tion across in-vocabulary (IV) items, and counter-
ing the effects of data sparsity for low-frequency
and out-of-vocabulary (OOV) items.

Without some means of automatically deriv-
ing the vector representations without reliance on
labelled data, however, word embeddings would
have little practical utility. Fortunately, it has
been shown that they can be “pre-trained” from
unlabelled text data using various algorithms to
model the distributional hypothesis (i.e., that
words which occur in similar contexts tend to be
semantically similar). Pre-training methods have
been refined considerably in recent years, and
scaled up to increasingly large corpora.

As with other machine learning methods, it is
well known that the quality of the pre-trained word
embeddings depends heavily on factors including
parameter optimisation, the size of the training
data, and the fit with the target application. For
example, Turian et al. (2010) showed that the op-
timal dimensionality for word embeddings is task-
specific. One factor which has received relatively
little attention in NLP is the effect of “updating”
the pre-trained word embeddings as part of the
task-specific training, based on self-taught learn-
ing (Raina et al., 2007). Updating leads to word
representations that are task-specific, but often at
the cost of over-fitting low-frequency and OOV
words.

In this paper, we perform an extensive evalu-
ation of four recently proposed word embedding
approaches under fixed experimental conditions,
applied to four sequence labelling tasks: part-of-
speech (POS) tagging, full-text chunking, named
entity recognition (NER), and multiword expres-

sion (MWE) identification.1 We build on previous
empirical studies (Collobert et al., 2011; Turian et
al., 2010; Pennington et al., 2014) in considering
a broader range of word embedding approaches
and evaluating them over more sequence labelling
tasks. In addition, we explore the following re-
search questions:
RQ1: are word embeddings better than baseline

approaches of one-hot unigram2 features
and Brown clusters?

RQ2: do word embeddings require less training
data (i.e., generalise better) than one-hot
unigram features? If so, to what degree can
word embeddings reduce the amount of la-
belled data?

RQ3: what is the impact of updating word em-
beddings in sequence labelling tasks, both
empirically over the target task and geo-
metrically over the vectors?

RQ4: what is the impact of these word embed-
dings (with and without updating) on both
OOV items (relative to the training data)
and out-of-domain data?

RQ5: overall, are some word embeddings better
than others in a sequence labelling context?

2 Word Representations

2.1 Types of Word Representations

Turian et al. (2010) identifies three varieties
of word representations: distributional, cluster-
based, and distributed.

Distributional representation methods map
each word w to a context word vector Cw,
which is constructed directly from co-occurrence
counts between w and its context words. The
learning methods either store the co-occurrence
counts between two words w and i directly
in Cwi (Sahlgren, 2006; Turney and Pantel,
2010; Honkela, 1997) or project the concur-
rence counts between words into a lower dimen-
sional space (Řehůřek and Sojka, 2010; Lund and
Burgess, 1996), using dimensionality reduction
techniques such as SVD (Dumais et al., 1988) or
LDA (Blei et al., 2003).

1MWEs are lexicalized combinations of two or more sim-
plex words that are exceptional enough to be considered as
single units in the lexicon (Baldwin and Kim, 2010; Schnei-
der et al., 2014a), e.g., pick up or part of speech.

2Word vectors with one-hot representation are binary vec-
tors with a single dimension per word in the vocabulary (i.e.,
d = |V |), with the single dimension corresponding to the
target word set to 1 and all other dimensions set to 0.

Cluster-based representation methods build
clusters of words by applying either soft or hard
clustering algorithms (Lin and Wu, 2009; Li and
McCallum, 2005). Some of them also rely on
a co-occurrence matrix of words (Pereira et al.,
1993). The Brown clustering algorithm (Brown
et al., 1992) is the best-known method in this cat-
egory.

Distributed representation methods usu-
ally map words into dense, low-dimensional,
continuous-valued vectors, with x ∈ Rd, where d
is referred to as the word dimension.

2.2 Selected Word Representations
Over a range of sequence labelling tasks, we eval-
uate four methods for inducing word represen-
tations: Brown clustering (Brown et al., 1992)
(“BROWN”), the continuous bag-of-words model
(“CBOW”) (Mikolov et al., 2013a), the continu-
ous skip-gram model (“SKIP-GRAM”) (Mikolov et
al., 2013b), and Global vectors (“GLOVE”) (Pen-
nington et al., 2014). All have been shown to be
at or near state-of-the-art in recent empirical stud-
ies (Turian et al., 2010; Pennington et al., 2014).3

The training of these word representations is un-
supervised: the common underlying idea is to pre-
dict the occurrence of words in the neighbour-
ing context. Their training objectives share the
same form, which is a sum of local training fac-
tors J(w, ctx(w)),

L =
∑
w∈T

J(w, ctx(w))

where T is the set of tokens in a given corpus, and
ctx(w) denotes the local context of word w. The
local context of a word is conventionally its pre-
ceding m words, or alternatively the m words sur-
rounding it. Local training factors are designed
to capture the relationship between w and its lo-
cal contexts of use, either by predicting w based
on its local context, or using w to predict the con-
text words. Other than BROWN, which utilises a
cluster-based representation, all the other methods
employ a distributed representation.

The starting point for CBOW and SKIP-GRAM
is to employ softmax to predict word occurrence:

J(w, ctx(w)) = − log
(

exp(vTwvctx(w))∑
j∈V exp(v

T
j vctx(w))

)
3The word embedding approach proposed in Collobert et

al. (2011) is not considered because it was found to be inferior
to our four target word embedding approaches in previous
work.

84



where vctx(w) denotes the distributed representa-
tion of the local context of word w, and V is the
vocabulary of a given corpus. CBOW derives
vctx(w) based on averaging over the context words.
That is, it estimates the probability of each w given
its local context. In contrast, SKIP-GRAM applies
softmax to each context word of a given occur-
rence of word w. In this case, vctx(w) corresponds
to the representation of one of its context words.
This model can be characterised as predicting con-
text words based on w. In practice, softmax is
too expensive to compute over large corpora, and
thus Mikolov et al. (2013b) use hierarchical soft-
max and negative sampling to scale up the train-
ing.

GLOVE assumes the dot product of two word
embeddings should be similar to the logarithm of
the co-occurrence count Xij of the two words. As
such, the local factor J(w, ctx(w)) becomes:

g(Xij)(vTi vj + bi + bj − log(Xij))2

where bi and bj are the bias terms of words i and
j, respectively, and g(Xij) is a weighting function
based on the co-occurrence count. This weight-
ing function controls the degree of agreement be-
tween the parametric function vTi vj + bi + bj and
log(Xij). Frequently co-occurring word pairs will
have larger weight than infrequent pairs, up to a
threshold.

BROWN partitions words into a finite set of
word classes V . The conditional probability of
seeing the next word is defined to be:

p(wk|wk−1k−m) = p(wk|hk)p(hk|hk−1k−m)

where hk denotes the word class of the word
wk, wk−1k−m are the previous m words, and
hk−1k−m are their respective word classes. Then
J(w, ctx(w)) = − log p(wk|wk−1k−m). Since there
is no tractable method to find an optimal parti-
tion of word classes, the method uses only a bi-
gram class model, and utilises hierarchical clus-
tering as an approximation method to find a suffi-
ciently good partition of words.

2.3 Building Word Representations

To ensure the comparison of different word rep-
resentations is fair, we train BROWN, CBOW,
SKIP-GRAM, and GLOVE on a fixed corpus, com-
prised of freely available corpora, as detailed in
Table 1. The joint corpus was preprocessed with

the Stanford CoreNLP sentence splitter and to-
keniser. All consecutive digit substrings were
replaced by NUMf, where f is the length of
the digit substring (e.g., 10.20 is replaced by
NUM2.NUM2.

The dimensionality of the word embeddings
and the size of the context window are the key hy-
perparameters when learning distributed represen-
tations. We use all combinations of the following
values to train word embeddings on the combined
corpus:

• Embedding dim. d ∈ {25, 50, 100, 200}
• Context window size m ∈ {1, 5, 10}
BROWN requires only the number of clusters

as a hyperparameter. Here, we perform clustering
with b ∈ {250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000} clusters.

3 Sequence Labelling Tasks

We evaluate the different word representations
over four sequence labelling tasks: POS tagging
(POS tagging), full-text chunking (Chunking),
NER (NER), and MWE identification (MWE).
For each task, we fed features into a first-order
linear-chain graph transformer (Collobert et al.,
2011) made up of two layers: the upper layer is
identical to a linear-chain CRF (Lafferty et al.,
2001), and the lower layer consists of word rep-
resentation and hand-crafted features. If we treat
word representations as fixed, the graph trans-
former is a simple linear-chain CRF. On the other
hand, if we can treat the word representations as
model parameters, the model is equivalent to a
neural network with word embeddings as the input
layer, as shown in Figure 1. We trained all models
using AdaGrad (Duchi et al., 2011).

As in Turian et al. (2010), at each word position,
we construct word representation features from
the words in a context window of size two to either

85



side of the target word, based on the pre-trained
representation of each word type. For BROWN,
the features are the prefix features extracted from
word clusters in the same way as Turian et al.
(2010). As a baseline (and to test RQ1), we in-
clude a one-hot representation (which is equiva-
lent to a linear-chain CRF with only lexical con-
text features).

Our hand-crafted features for POS tagging,
Chunking and MWE, are those used by Collobert
et al. (2011), Turian et al. (2010) and Schneider
et al. (2014b), respectively. For NER, we use the
same feature space as Turian et al. (2010), except
for the previous two predictions, because we want
to evaluate all word representations with the same
type of model — a first-order graph transformer.

In training the distributed word representations,
we consider two settings: (1) the word represen-
tations are fixed during sequence model training;
and (2) the graph transformer updated the token-
level word representations during training.

As outlined in Table 2, for each sequence la-
belling task, we experiment over the de facto cor-
pus, based on pre-existing training–dev–test splits
where available:4

POS tagging: the Wall Street Journal portion
of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al. (1993):
“WSJ”) with Penn POS tags

Chunking: the Wall Street Journal portion of the
Penn Treebank (“WSJ”), converted into IOB-
style full-text chunks using the CoNLL con-
version scripts for training and dev, and the
WSJ-derived CoNLL-2000 full text chunk-
ing test data for testing (Tjong Kim Sang and
Buchholz, 2000)

NER: the English portion of the CoNLL-2003
English Named Entity Recognition data set,
for which the source data was taken from
Reuters newswire articles (Tjong Kim Sang
and De Meulder (2003): “Reuters”)

MWE: the MWE dataset of Schneider et al.
(2014b), over a portion of text from the En-
glish Web Treebank5 (“EWT”)

For all tasks other than MWE,6 we additionally
have an out-of-domain test set, in order to eval-
uate the out-of-domain robustness of the different

constructed our own.

word representations, with and without updating.
These datasets are as follows:
POS tagging: the English Web Treebank with

Penn POS tags (“EWT”)
Chunking: the Brown Corpus portion of the

Penn Treebank (“Brown”), converted into
IOB-style full-text chunks using the CoNLL
conversion scripts

NER: the MUC-7 named entity recognition cor-
pus7 (“MUC7”)

For reproducibility, we tuned the hyperparam-
eters with random search over the development
data for each task (Bergstra and Bengio, 2012).
In this, we randomly sampled 50 distinct hyper-
parameter sets with the same random seed for the
non-updating models (i.e., the models that don’t
update the word representation), and sampled 100
distinct hyperparameter sets for the updating mod-
els (i.e., the models that do). For each set of hy-
perparameters and task, we train a model over its
training set and choose the best one based on its
performance on development data (Turian et al.,
2010). We also tune the word representation hy-
perparameters — namely, the word vector size d
and context window size m (distributed represen-
tations), and in the case of Brown, the number of
clusters.

For the updating models, we found that the re-
sults over the test data were always inferior to
those that do not update the word representations,
due to the higher number of hyperparameters and
small sample size (i.e., 100). Since the two-layer
model of the graph transformer contains a distinct
set of hyperparameters for each layer, we reuse the
best-performing hyperparameter settings from the
non-updating models, and only tune the hyperpa-
rameters of AdaGrad for the word representation
layer. This method requires only 32 additional
runs and achieves consistently better results than
100 random draws.

In order to test the impact of the volume of
training data on the different models (RQ2), we
split the training set into 10 partitions based on
a base-2 log scale (i.e., the second smallest par-
tition will be twice the size of the smallest parti-
tion), and created 10 successively larger training
sets by merging these partitions from the smallest
one to the largest one, and used each of these to
train a model. From these, we construct learning

curves over each task.
For ease of comparison with previous results,

we evaluate both in- and out-of-domain using
chunk/entity/expression-level F1-measure (“F1”)
for all tasks except POS tagging, for which we
use token-level accuracy (“ACC”). To test perfor-
mance over OOV (unknown) tokens — i.e., the
words that do not occur in the training set — we
use token-level accuracy for all tasks (e.g., for
Chunking, we evaluate whether the full IOB tag
is correct or not), because chunks/NEs/MWEs can
consist of a mixture of in-vocabulary and OOV to-
kens, which makes the use of chunk-based evalu-
ation measures inappropriate.

4 Experimental Results and Discussion

We structure our evaluation by stepping through
each of our five research questions (RQ1–5) from
the start of the paper. In this, we make reference
to: (1) the best-performing method both in- and
out-of-domain vs. the state-of-the-art (Table 3);
(2) a heat map for each task indicating the con-
vergence rate for each word representation, with
and without updating (Figure 2); (3) OOV accu-
racy both in-domain and out-of-domain for each
task (Figure 3); and (4) visualisation of the impact
of updating on word embeddings, based on t-SNE
(Figure 4).

RQ1: Are the selected word embeddings better
than one-hot unigram features and Brown clus-
ters? As shown in Table 3, the best-performing
method for every task except in-domain Chunk-
ing is a word embedding method, although the
precise method varies greatly. Figure 2, on the
other hand, tells a more subtle story: the difference
between UNIGRAM and the other word represen-
tations is relatively modest, esp. as the amount of
training data increases. Additionally, the differ-
ence between BROWN and the word embedding
methods is modest across all tasks. So, the over-
all answer would appear to be: yes, word embed-
dings are better than unigrams when there is little
training data, but they are not markedly better than
Brown clusters.

RQ2: Do word embedding features require
less training data? Figure 2 shows that for
POS tagging and NER, with only several hun-
dred training instances, word embedding fea-
tures achieve superior results to UNIGRAM. For
example, when trained with 561 instances, the
POS tagging model using SKIP-GRAM+UP em-
beddings is 5.3% above UNIGRAM; and when
trained with 932 instances, the NER model us-
ing SKIP-GRAM is 11.7% above UNIGRAM. Sim-
ilar improvements are also found for other types
of word embeddings and BROWN, when the train-
ing set is small. However, all word representa-
tions perform similarly for Chunking regardless
of training data size. For MWE, BROWN performs
slightly better than the other methods when trained
with approximately 25% of the training instances.
Therefore, we conjecture that the POS tagging
and NER tasks benefit more from distributional
similarity than Chunking and MWE.

RQ3: Does task-specific updating improve all
word embeddings across all tasks? Based on
Figure 2, updating of word representations can
equally correct poorly-learned word representa-
tions, and harm pre-trained representations, due to
overfitting. For example, GLOVE performs sub-
stantially worse than SKIP-GRAM for both POS
tagging and NER without updating, but with up-
dating, the relative empirical gap between the best
performing method becomes smaller. In contrast,
SKIP-GRAM performs worse over the test data
with updating, despite the results on the develop-
ment set improving by 1%.

To further investigate the effects of updating,
we sampled 60 words and plotted the changes in
their word embeddings under updating, using 2-
d vector fields generated using matplotlib and t-
SNE (van der Maaten and Hinton, 2008). Half
of the words were chosen manually to include
known word clusters such as days of the week and
names of countries; the other half were selected
randomly. Additional plots with 100 randomly-
sampled words and the top-100 most frequent
words, for all the methods and all the tasks, can
be found in the supplementary material and at

single arrow signifies one word, pointing from the
position of the original word embedding to the up-
dated representation.

In Figure 4, we show vector fields plots for
Chunking and NER using SKIP-GRAM embed-
dings. For Chunking, most of the vectors were
changed with similar magnitude, but in very dif-
ferent directions, including within the clusters of
days of the week and country names. In contrast,
for NER, there was more homogeneous change in
word vectors belonging to the same cluster. This
greater consistency is further evidence that seman-
tic homogeneity appears to be more beneficial for

NER than Chunking.

RQ4: What is the impact of word embeddings
cross-domain and for OOV words? As shown
in Table 3, results predictably drop when we eval-
uate out of domain. The difference is most pro-
nounced for Chunking, where there is an absolute
drop in F1 of around 30% for all methods, indi-
cating that word embeddings and unigram features
provide similar information for Chunking.

Another interesting observation is that updating
often hurts out-of-domain performance because
the distribution between domains is different. This
suggests that, if the objective is to optimise per-
formance across domains, it is best not to perform

generalisation, the OOV results are better when
updating is not performed.

RQ5 Overall, are some word embeddings bet-
ter than others? Comparing the different word
embedding techniques over our four sequence la-
belling tasks, for the different evaluations (overall,
out-of-domain and OOV), there is no clear winner
among the word embeddings — for POS tagging,
SKIP-GRAM appears to have a slight advantage,
but this does not generalise to other tasks.

While the aim of this paper was not to achieve
the state of the art over the respective tasks, it is
important to concede that our best (in-domain) re-
sults for NER, POS tagging and Chunking are
slightly worse than the state of the art (Table 3).
The 2.7% difference between our NER system
and the best performing system is due to the fact
that we use a first-order instead of a second-order
CRF (Ando and Zhang, 2005), and for the other
tasks, there are similarly differences in the learner
and the complexity of the features used. Another
difference is that we tuned the hyperparameters
with random search, to enable replication using
the same random seed. In contrast, the hyperpa-
rameters for the state-of-the-art methods are tuned
more extensively by experts, making them more
difficult to reproduce.

5 Related Work

Collobert et al. (2011) proposed a unified neural
network framework that learns word embeddings
and applied it to POS tagging, Chunking, NER
and semantic role labelling. When they combined
word embeddings with hand-crafted features (e.g.,
word suffixes for POS tagging; gazetteers for
NER) and applied other tricks like cascading and
classifier combination, they achieved state-of-the-
art performance. Similarly, Turian et al. (2010)
evaluated three different word representations on
NER and Chunking, and concluded that unsu-
pervised word representations improved NER and
Chunking. They also found that combining dif-
ferent word representations can further improve
performance. Guo et al. (2014) also explored dif-
ferent ways of using word embeddings for NER.
Owoputi et al. (2013) and Schneider et al. (2014a)
found that BROWN clustering enhances Twitter
POS tagging and MWE, respectively. Compared
to previous work, we consider more word rep-
resentations including the most recent work and
evaluate them on more sequence labelling tasks,

wherein the models are trained with training sets
of varying size.

Bansal et al. (2014) reported that direct use of
word embeddings in dependency parsing did not
show improvement. They achieved an improve-
ment only when they performed hierarchical clus-
tering of the word embeddings, and used features
extracted from the cluster hierarchy. In a simi-
lar vein, Andreas and Klein (2014) explored the
use of word embeddings for constituency pars-
ing and concluded that the information contained
in word embeddings might duplicate the one ac-
quired by a syntactic parser, unless the training set
is extremely small. Other syntactic parsing studies
that reported improvements by using word embed-
dings include Koo et al. (2008), Koo et al. (2010),
Haffari et al. (2011), Tratz and Hovy (2011) and
Chen and Manning (2014).

Word embeddings have also been applied to
other (non-sequential NLP) tasks like grammar in-
duction (Spitkovsky et al., 2011), and semantic
tasks such as semantic relatedness, synonymy de-
tection, concept categorisation, selectional prefer-
ence learning and analogy (Baroni et al., 2014;
Levy and Goldberg, 2014; Levy et al., 2015).

Huang and Yates (2009) demonstrated that us-
ing distributional word representations methods
(like TF-IDF and LSA) as features, improves the
labelling of OOV, when test for POS tagging and
Chunking. In our study, we evaluate the labelling
performance of OOV words for updated vs. non-
updated word embedding representations, relative
to the training set and with out-of-domain data.

6 Conclusions

We have performed an extensive extrinsic evalua-
tion of four word embedding methods under fixed
experimental conditions, and evaluated their ap-
plicability to four sequence labelling tasks: POS
tagging, Chunking, NER and MWE identifica-
tion. We found that word embedding features re-
liably outperformed unigram features, especially
with limited training data, but that there was rela-
tively little difference over Brown clusters, and no
one embedding method was consistently superior
across the different tasks and settings. Word em-
beddings and Brown clusters were also found to
improve out-of-domain performance and for OOV
words. We expected a performance gap between
the fixed and task-updated embeddings, but the ob-
served difference was marginal. Indeed, we found

90



that updating can result in overfitting. We also car-
ried out preliminary analysis of the impact of up-
dating on the vectors, a direction which we intend
to pursue further.
