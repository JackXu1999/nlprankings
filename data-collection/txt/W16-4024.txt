Abstract

The following paper describes the first steps in the development of an ontology for the textbook
research discipline. The aim of the project WorldViews is to establish a digital edition focussing
on views of the world depicted in textbooks. For this purpose an initial TEI profile has been
formalised and tested as a use case to enable the semantical encoding of the resource ’textbook’.
This profile shall provide a basic data model describing major facets of the textbook’s structure
relevant to historians.

1 Introduction

1.1 Textbook research and Digital Humanities

Textbook research has resulted in many forms of output, especially with its inter- and multidisciplinary
approach as it is conducted at the GEI. The institute with its researchers from various different disci-
plines provides an excellent setting for cooperation and collaboration amongst these. As an increasing
amount of projects is being executed in an interdisciplinary way and also in cooperation with the research
infrastructure departments, the GEI evolves into a centre for the Digital Humanities, resulting in interdis-
ciplinary and multimedial projects and digital plattforms. In recent years this development has proved as
rather cumbersome for information retrieval and data reuse. The research results, most of them in digital
form, end as legacy data in the sense of not being able to integrate them in the institute’s information
portals1 because of data heterogeneity, therefore not beeing discovered and eventually not being used.
This happens most often shortly after their production. The workflow usually consists of establishing a
model for the digital representation each time anew. Rules or best practices on how to model textbook
research data in a uniformal way in order to ensure their long term usability and stability do not exist.
This is what makes the knowledge organisation situation at the GEI complicated.

1.2 Lack of Data Models and its impact on knowledge organisation in textbook research

But whereas models of the disciplines’ knowledge exist in other fields, as for instance thesauri2 or ontolo-
gies3 providing access to the discipline’s knowledge and information, the multidisciplinary character of
textbook research aside its relatively short existence up to this day prohibit the development of a thor-
ough data model, which would offer more powerful ways for knowledge organisation than controlled
vocabularies used by the library for indexing purposes.

A large amount of the GEI’s resources are available as XML-based fulltext after processing them with

OCR (e.g. GEI-Digital4, EurViews5). The Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard6 (METS) is
used to describe them in a machine-readable way. Although METS is commonly used it does not offer
adequate possibilities for the description of a textbook’s content and characteristics, e.g. the specific
school types and levels of education. By defining a model for structuring and encoding the data in a
more thorough way, both data standardisation and integration on the one side and improved exploitation
on the other side would be supported, improving the GEI data sources’ retrieval, reuse and long term
availability.

2 Project aims

2.1 Objective: Use Case WorldViews

A first attempt in this direction is the project WorldViews, funded by the BMBF and started in the
beginning of 2015. A critical digital edition of textbook sources will be compiled, which is intended to
serve historians with an entry point for discovering relevant, reliable and hard-to-find research materials
on topics regarding textbooks. The materials may provide inspiration or even the corpus for medium
scaled research endeavours or the foundation of more extensive research for additional sources. By
establishing this digital collection comprising excerpts of textbooks and annotating them in regard to a
particular research question (figure 1), a use case is being set up for developing and testing a first profile
fit for the semantically contextualisation of the resources.

Annotation is interpretation, its purpose is to make a statement on the annotated element’s appearance
and/or meaning. By encoding elements in texts, aside from machine readability and long term availabil-
ity, their detectability is ensured, in order to make them comparable and find relations. To support its
semantic contextualisation the annotation language needs to be adapted to the specific text type, in the
WorldViews context the textbook excerpts and editors’ contributions. The use case WorldViews is the
first project making an attempt to define such a specific annotation profile for the text type ’textbook’.

Since there existed no profile or standard for the description of textbooks, it was decided to use an
adaptation of the TEI Guidelines7 for encoding, mainly because of its common and well tested use for
encoding text resources in the humanities, therefore ensuring compatibility and longterm usability in
the context of Digital Humanities (DH) tools and methods. Furthermore it provided the flexibility and
extension possibilities needed to adapt it to the project’s research questions.

The Guidelines formulated by the TEI Consortium have become a quasi standard in the DH community
for the encoding of historical text resources. Since their development in 1994 their XML-based structure
has proved most useful for a broad range of text types, mainly based on its flexibility in adapting it to the
respective discipline, resource types and research questions. In forming a TEI profile based on textbook
research one of the project’s expected results will be, whether TEI is able and an appropriate way to
encode textbooks as well.

TEI commits to two essential axioms (TEI Simple Primer, 2016): First, a document is an ”ordered
hierarchy of content objects” (OHCO) (DeRose et al., 1990), and second, the presentation and the
structure of a document can be cleanly separated. In the context of textual documents, both axioms
are problematic. However, both axioms have proofed to be true often enough to be useful. Also the
project team encountered these problems when trying to model each and every aspect of the text both
on structural or presentation level at the same time. This most often resulted in a compromise between
humanists and information scientists, receiving a model purposeful to both sides’ present needs: as ”an
instance of the fundamental selectivity of any encoding. An encoding makes explicit only those textual
features of importance to the encoder.” (TEI Lite, 2012) Although deeply wished by the historians, most
layout aspects were neglected.

2.2 Approach: Using language technology in the humanities

First steps comprised of determining the characteristic elements of the used and established data within
the project. This had to be done in close collaboration with the historians and cultural scientist involved
in the project. Since they would eventually apply the data model, the usability of TEI during the research
process could be tested as well when adopted by people not familiar with language technology tools.

Relevant questions had to be answered considering the kind of the arising research data. A necessity
was to clearly formulate the annotations’ purposes in order to avoid modeling data not relevant in the
project context. This step showed the usual difficulties in asking the humanists of expressing their current
- and possibly even future - research questions in an explicit way, fit for modeling them in a machine-
readable form.

The wide variety of text types used in textbooks formed the problem of how to encode central char-
acteristic text types, e.g. tasks (”pädagogische Anweisung”) or clozes. It needed to be determinded how
to treat visual elements like pictograms, infographics or timelines, often extended onto the next page,
as well as image and text descriptions like image captions, texts in maps and marginalia, as they are
increasingly used in modern educational resources. The humanists expressed their need especially for
encoding these elements as they, as a major didactic method, play an important role in conveying the
excerpt’s world view.

A major issue applied to the corpus’ multilingual character: the digital collection WorldViews, with
its focus on world representations in textbooks from all around the world, would comprise of sources in
various different languages, not necessarily written in latin alphabets or in a left-right direction (figure
2).

Figure 2: Example of the above chinese textbook excerpt’s fulltext in TEI

Some examples of the decisions for TEI elements to be used on the type ’textbook’:

• <figDesc>is important because images on a textbook page may not be licenced yet and are there-
fore not displayed in the frontend. In such cases, <figDesc>allows to provide a meaningful textual
description of the images and of those aspects of the image that are relevant to the narrative.

• @type:
In order to retain flexibility regarding future extensions of the profile, text passages have been qual-
ified by means of custom data values for type attributes. That allows for easy complementing of
new relevant types of text passages.

• marginalia (defined as note of the textbook author):
<note type=”gloss” place=”outer margin”>Ausbildung des Ritterstandes</note>with possible
types: @type=”footnote—endnote—gloss”

3 Knowledge Organisation: From specific to general data modeling

3.1 Expected results
The project’s major outcome is expected to be a profile for text resources meeting exactly the purpose of
encoding elementary characteristics of textbooks. By the project’s process of closely collaborating with
the historians the profile’s easy handling and managebility by people not used to working with language
technology tools will be ensured. By referring to common standards also the compatibility with existing
profiles and guidelines like TEI-Simple (TEI Simple Primer, 2016) and TEI-Lite (TEI Lite, 2012) is
considered in order to retain its long term usability. These aspects will suppport the WorldViews profile
to become the first version of a basic format for textbook sources.

The project will have impact on the GEI’s research working processes as well: a workflow is for-
malised and tested which will support future interdisciplinary projects to determine their major elements
based on the research output the projects are expected to generate. It will serve as an example of what
major research questions could be, how difficult text types and layouts can be handled. Furthermore it
will show how information and computer scientists and humanists can communicate on a mutual level in
order to achieve the needed data model formulated in a way meeting both sides of researchers’ needs as
exactly as possible.

3.2 Future Work
Future work may address the question of how the use case WorldViews can serve as a first survey,
forming the basis for a general data model, outlining the research done at the GEI. This data model,
integrated in the institute’s information retrieval tools and portals, would form a major part in supporting
the knowledge organisation at the GEI. The WorldViews model’s ability to support the long-term ob-
jective of formalising an ontology for the textbook research needs further research and use cases. This
development could eventually support the GEI’s intention of becoming an internationally acting centre
in this research field.
