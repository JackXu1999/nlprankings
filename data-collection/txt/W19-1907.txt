Abstract 

This paper details the development of a new 

linguistic resource designed to integrate 

aspectual values in temporal information 

extraction systems. After a brief review of 

the linguistic notion of aspect and how it 

got a place in the NLP field, we present our 

clinical data and describe the five-step 

approach adopted in this study. Then, we 

describe our French linguistic resource and 

explain how we elaborated it and which 

properties were selected for the creation of 

the tables. Finally, we evaluate the coverage 

of our resource and we present several 

prospects and improvements to foresee. 

1 Introduction  

 Being able to model the chronology of events is 

paramount in the medical field, especially in 

electronic health records. Temporal reasoning 

indeed plays an important role at different stages of 

patient care: tracking disease status, decision 

support, prevention of side effects, recognition and 

discovery of health problems, choice of the 

appropriate treatment and care quality (Botsis et al., 

2011; Chai et al., 2013; Sojic et al., 2016). Because 

this has yet to be properly implemented in clinical 

software, it is essential to keep developing NLP 

techniques and methods that efficiently extract 

temporal information and medical events found in 

patient records. 

 Temporal information extraction has been 

widely studied. Several methods have been 

developed to obtain ever more satisfactory results 

in the extraction of this information, whether by a 

statistical method (Li and Patrick, 2012) or by a 

hybrid method combining rule-based and 

machine-learning pattern (Lin et al., 2013), 

statistical and symbolic approaches (Tapi Nzali, 

Tannier and Neveol, 2015a), neural networks and 

support vector machines (Tourille et al., 2017).  

 These studies were mainly concentrated on 

English data, ‘due to the lack of publicly available 

annotated corpora’ for other languages, including 

French (Sun et al., 2013). Recently Campillos et al. 

(2018) produced a French written clinical corpus 

with the annotation of temporal entities, attributes, 

and relations, but it is not yet freely open to the 

research community. 

In this paper, assuming that consideration of 

aspect could improve the precision of temporal 

information extraction (see Fig. 1), we undertook 

to develop an innovative resource which encodes 

linguistic properties related to the French verbal 

aspect in medical language. We will test it, within 

a system of temporal information extraction, in a 

later paper.  

After a brief introduction of the concept of 

aspect from linguistic and NLP angles and a review 

of existing resources (section 2), we will define our 

corpus (section 3) and the method (section 4) used 

in this research to elaborate this linguistic resource 

(section 5). We will then assess the coverage of the 

resource (section 6) and discuss directions for 

future works (section 7).

aspect refers to “the representation that the 

speaker makes of the process expressed by the 

verb (or by the action name), that is to say, the 

representation of its duration, its course or its 

completion (inchoative, progressive, resultant, 

perfective aspects, etc.)” (Dubois et al., 1994: 53).  

Aspect in French refers to three components 

that should be dissociated: grammatical aspect, 

Aktionsart (or semantic aspect) and lexical aspect. 

The grammatical aspect is “a significant variation 

of the verb related to a choice of the speaker and, 

in this respect ‘subjective’” (Confais, 2002: 202). 

It is realized morphologically through verbal 

inflections. Smith (1991) has extensively 

theorized on the viewpoint or grammatical aspect 

in which she distinguishes the perfective (1), 

imperfective and neutral aspects; after her, Caudal 

(2006) adds the resultative aspect.  

(1) J'ai rencontré cette patiente dont j'ai opéré le 

mari d'une obésité morbide par Sleeve. 

“I met this patient whose husband I performed a 

sleeve surgery on for morbid obesity.” (Perfective) 

The Aktionsart (see (2)) describes eventualities 

(Bach, 1986) according to criteria such as telicity, 

durativity, atomicity or dynamicity (Vendler, 

1957; Comrie, 1981; Moens and Steedman, 

1988). For the calculation, the verbal diathesis is 

used, i.e., the verbal kernel extended with its 

completion and its possible modifiers.  
(2) On a surveillé le patient pendant 48h.  

“We monitored the patient for 48 hours.” (Activity) 

The lexical aspect is expressed by the very 

meaning of the verb (Karolak, 2008; 

Kozareva-Levie, 2011). This aspect “isolates a 

moment of the process or specifies the place of the 

said process in an event chain” (Wilmet, 2001: 63) 

and presents it as “the result of a selection 

operation of part of the constituent time of this 

process” (Gosselin, 2011: 149). This aspect can be 

rendered either by the full verb (3) or by a semi-

auxiliary, serving as a support verb (e.g. continuer 

‘to continue to’). 
(3) J'ai préféré interrompre l'examen au niveau de 

l'angle droit. 

“I preferred to interrupt the examination at the right 

angle.” 

Our objective is not so much to end the aspectual 

controversy, but rather to identify and select the 

factual elements from this field that are best suited 

for operationalization and automatic recognition. 

In this paper, we focus on the internal lexical 

aspect (Gosselin, 2011: 149-150). Indeed, it 

seems particularly relevant to us, in a medical 

linguistics project, to identify events such as the 

onset of a disease, the performance of surgery, the 

resumption of an examination or the end of 

treatment; all essential aspectual elements to be 

placed on a patient’s timeline.  

2.2 What about the aspect in NLP? 

NLP researchers have proposed solutions for 

integrating the aspectual dimension into temporal 

information extraction system. This integration is 

made difficult by the complexity of the aspectual 

phenomenon about which “opinion is often divided 

as to the appropriate aspectual categories and their 

realizations” (Bittar, 2010: 33). Among the 

different methods listed above, we are mainly 

interested in resources that encode aspectual 

properties in order to be integrated into information 

retrieval and information extraction systems.  In the 

late twentieth century, Klavans and Chodorow 

(1992) developed an aspectual classification 

system that establishes a distinction between 

stative and non-stative events using scenario 

templates. Later, Siegel and McKeown (2001) 

finalized a statistical method for automatic 

aspectual classification by prediction on co-

occurrence frequencies between verbs and 

linguistic modifiers. 

In 2003, the TimeML specification of event and 

temporal expressions in natural language text was 

introduced (TimeML; Pustejovsky et al., 2003). 

These annotation guidelines include two aspectual 

levels: i) the aspectual attribute that concerns 

grammatical aspect; ii) the ALINK that represents 

the relationship between an aspectual event and its 

argument event (initiates, continues, culminates, 

terminates).  

The following year, the TimeML standard is 

revised under the name of ISO-TimeML (ISO, 

2008) and two aspectual values are added: 

imperfective and imperfective_progressive. This 

new standard is tested in Task B of the Shared Task 

‘TempEval-2’ (Pustejovsky and Verhagen, 2009). 

In his thesis on the adaptation to French of the 

ISO-TimeML standard, Bittar (2010) studies the 

aspectual variants of support verb construction as 

well as the automatic processing of several 

aspectual periphrases. He added value to the 

aspectual attribute, prospective, and enriched the 

ALINK set with the reinitiates label. 

In the medical field, Styler IV et al. (2014) 

presented the Thyme-TimeML that integrates 

contextual aspect attribute – which distinguishes 

between intermittent, constant and new events – 



57

and permanence attribute – which differentiates 

between chronic and acute illness. Campillos et al. 

(2018) extended the notion of aspect to all that 

“encode[s] a change (or lack of change) with regard 

to an entity: Continue, decrease, Improve, Increase, 

Reccurrence, Start_Again, Start, Stop, Worsen” 

(580) when creating an annotated corpus of French 

medical records.  

2.3 Aspectual resources 

As far as we know, there are no resources in 

English or in French that are similar to ours, which 

is focused on the medical language. However, 

various resources record some aspectual verbs or 

constructions and detail their functioning. In this 

way, FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) labels semantic 

roles of verbal arguments for English, in order to 

show the meaning and usage of verbs senses. 

FrameNet contains some aspectual nuances for 

which the possible lexical units are indicated (e.g. 

Activity_finish: complete, conclude, finish), but 

without any indication of the syntactic construction 

or type of arguments needed by the verb to take this 

meaning. The values of culmination and 

resumption are not considered here. In the French 

FrameNet (Candito et al., 2014), no aspectual 

construction is examined, not even the beginning 

or the end of an activity. 

The lexical resource VerbNet (Kipper-Schuler, 

2005) and its French equivalent Verb∋net (Danlos, 
Nakamura and Pradet, 2014) have a class of 

aspectual verbs (class 55) in which the verbs 

expressing the value of beginning, continuation or 

end could be found. For each of these values, the 

verbal valency and syntactic constructions of the 

prototypical verb (e.g. begin/commencer in ‘begin-

55.1’) are indicated. We deepen this research in 

three ways: i) by adding some aspectual subclasses, 

ii) by describing the lexical units that are 

synonymous with the verbal prototype and iii) by 

specifying the semantic class of the arguments.  

Two other resources, manually created, exist for 

French and constitute the theoretical framework of 

this research: the Lexicon-Grammar (Gross, 1975) 

and the Verbes français (Dubois and Dubois-

Charlier, 1997). The first one is based on a 

descriptive formalism, which we have tried to 

reproduce to make it automatable; the second one 

lists a series of aspectual verbs that we have 

enriched so that it takes into account the medical 

specificities related to our corpus.  

NLP research tackles the notion of aspect. 

However, there is still a substantial gap to fill, both 

in French and in the medical field. Our contribution 

lies in this vast new field of knowledge. 

3 Data 

It is admitted that the temporal information and 

how it will be presented will depend on the type of 

documents analyzed (Tapi Nzali, Tannier, Névéol, 

2015b). Clinical documents are very 

heterogeneous and time references are adapted 

accordingly. To avoid being restricted to one type 

of document, we collected a corpus which includes 

five types of clinical texts in the following 

proportions (see Table 1): 

These documents (about 54 million tokens), dating 

from 1996 to 2014, were collected and anonymized 

as part of a project with six services (abdominal and 

bariatric surgery, gastroenterology, MRI, scanners, 

and ultrasound) of a Brussels hospital (iMediate, 

2014-2016). We deemed appropriate to use such a 

considerable amount of data since we focus on a 

very specific phenomenon, i.e., the lexical aspect 

conveyed by verbs. 

4 Methodology 

We created the resource following a 5-step 

method. Firstly, we established the verbal seed 

terms list that could evoke a lexical aspect. For 

this purpose, we started from the definition of 

aspectual relationship in the ISO-TimeML 

Standard for annotation (Pustejovsky et al., 2010). 

Five aspectual relationships are considered, here 

associated with the prototypical French verb: 

Initiates (commencer), Continues (continuer), 

Terminates (terminer), Culminates (accomplir) 

and Reinitiates (recommencer) (Bittar, 2010: 80). 

Ideally, categories of verbs expressing the 

possible outcome of a hospitalization (healing, 

improvement, stability, deterioration, and death; 

DEFT, 2019) or verbs indicating the progress or 

decline of a patient should also be implemented 

(Elhadad et al., 2015). These new aspectual values 

require more manual cleaning, which is 

underway.

Secondly, this list was enriched with the aid of 

two resources: the consulting of thesauri (TLFi, 

2012; Crisco, 2019) and an in-depth exploratory 

analysis of the medical corpus. At the end of this 

second step, we end up with a total of 142 verbs 

and verb phrases that can potentially express an 

aspectual nuance, as follows.  

Thirdly, on this basis, extraction grammars were 

designed in the corpus analysis software Unitex 

(Paumier, 2016) and applied to the corpus. These 

grammars enable the creation of a concordance, 

an ‘in context’ exploration tool of the aspectual 

verbs.  

Fourthly, using this concordance, we performed 

a manual vetting which applies three actions on the 

verbal occurrences: i) the deletion of verbs that 

never appear (e.g., to burst into) or never with an 

aspectual meaning (e.g., to break out) in our 

clinical language corpus; ii) the removal of non-

aspectual verbal constructions (see (4)); iii) the 

detection of verbs whose aspectual value changes 

under the negative modality (see (5)). 
(4) Par ailleurs, attaque son chir pour 

abdominoplastie trop serrée. 

(5) A arrêté de fumer. > Terminates 

“Quit smoking.” 

Malade n’arrête pas de tousser. > Continues 

“Sick person keeps coughing.”  

Fifthly, we have undertaken a linguistic analysis of 

this filtered list (Table 2) to establish verb classes 

characterized by syntactic and semantic properties 

and to produce the resource described here.  

5 Resource 

The linguistic resource presented in this paper 

consists of the description, in tabular form, of 90 

verbs and verbal phrases with an aspectual value. 

After extraction and manual analysis, these 90 

verbal expressions lead to 120 different 

constructions (see Table 2) which are then formally 

described. For example, the verb commencer 

comes in four forms:  commencer à (to start doing 

something), commencer par (to start with), 

commencer (+ article) + noun (to start something), 

commencer (to start). Each of these constructions 

possesses several syntactic and semantic 

properties. They will, therefore, fall into different 

descriptive tables.  

The ten tables resulting from this study (see 

Appendix A) allow us to summarize the syntactic 

and semantic constraints linking some elements of 

the sentence, frequently medical events.  

The structure of the table was determined based 

on the six following properties: i) aspectual nature; 

ii) passivization, iii) pronominalization of the 

complement, iv) number and type of complements; 

v) nature of the subject and vi) nature of the object. 

The first binarization of the 120 structures, based 

on aspectual nature, separates the structures which 

are always aspectual (6) from those which are only 

aspectual in certain instances, depending on the 

transitive or intransitive nature of the verb (7). 
(6) Elle se met à lire des notices pharmaceutiques. 

 “She starts reading pharmaceutical leaflets.” 

(7) Le Sulpiride coupe les vomissements vs. J’ai 

coupé le fil résorbable.   

“Sulpiride stops the vomiting.” vs. “I cut the 

absorbable thread.” 

This first binarization based on the aspectual nature 

criterion applies to the four tables (tables 2, 3, 5 and 

6) that respond identically to classification criteria, 

but differ in their aspectual dimension.  

Tests are then applied to the verbs, in the medical 

context of the corpus, with regard to certain 

syntactic and semantic properties. Performing 

these tests allows us to classify the verbs in the 

tables according to specific criteria. The tests are 

called transformations (Harris, 1957) and are 

applied to the simple form of the sentence, i.e., a 

positive assertion, in the active voice and reduced 

to the Subject-Verb-Object structure. 

In terms of syntax, three properties are evaluated 

and define the assignment of a verbal structure in 

one or the other table: 

 the existence (8) or the absence (9) of an 

equivalent form in the passive voice; 
(8) L’examen est abandonné par le médecin.  

 “The examination is given up by the doctor.” 

(9) *Le malade est prolongé par le médecin. 

*“The patient(’s life) is prolonged by the doctor.” 

 the possibility of pronominalizing the verb 

complement (10 and 11);  
(10) Le traitement relance le processus d’hépatite 

colique. → Il le relance.  

“Treatment revives the process of biliary colic.” 

→ It revives it.  

(11) Il a cessé toute consommation de bière. → *Il 

l’a cessée.

 the nature of the verb and its complements: 

verb with a direct object, verb with a 

prepositional complement, verb with a 

completive subordinate clause, stative verb 

and intransitive verb. 

 Concerning semantic properties, also referred to 

as distributional (Harris, 1954), we essentially 

examine the subject type (human or thing) and the 

object type, if relevant. When the subject or the 

object is an inanimate object, it often corresponds 

to a medical event. The selection of the type(s) of 

medical event accepted by the meaning of a verb is 

indicated in the column corresponding to one of the 

eleven possible events: administration, restriction 

or effort (diet, sports, profession, addiction), 

morphological abnormality, care and treatment, 

(positive or negative) effect, step, observable 

entity, findings, surgery, disorder and illness.  

Besides, these tables also indicate the aspectual 

modification of the verb (+) or the permanence of 

the aspect (-) in the presence of the negative 

modality. These tables feature two additional 

columns: the meaning of the verb in this structure 

and the aspect taken by the structure. Finally, we 

indicate the presence of an adverbial phrase and its 

type (of time, of manner, or instrument), when it is 

recurrent for this meaning. 

This resource is available upon request and will 

shortly be expanded. For an example of the table, 

see Appendix B. 

6 Evaluation 

To evaluate our resource, we estimated its 

coverage on 100 new medical texts that serve as a 

gold standard. These texts come from a different 

genre since they are 100 post hospitalization 

reports written by doctors. This different textual 

genre, still specific to the medical language, should 

allow a greater generalization of the resource, in 

that they convey a greater variety of linguistic 

phenomena.  

 In these texts, we have identified and annotated all 

the verbs, and only the verbs, that correspond to 

one of the five aspects of our typology. We 

calculated the coverage in terms of aspectual 

lemmata (Table 3), occurrences (Table 4) and 

occurrences by aspectual values (Table 5).  

  

Results are satisfactory, but probably 

insufficient for an industrial exploitation. We, 

therefore, want to integrate the cases identified as 

missing in the analysis and do this analysis again 

until reaching coverage of 0.9 by dragging it on a 

new corpus of 100 texts. 

7  Conclusion 

The development of such a linguistic resource, 

in which the medical language is formalized 

according to the lexical aspect of certain verbs, 

serves two purposes in the NLP field. On the one 

hand, these descriptions make it possible to 

distinguish the aspectual senses from the other 

meanings of a verb. They allow, among other 

things, to make a decision in case of verbal 

ambiguity. As a result, it is easier to include the 

aspect into the clinical patient’s history, which 

would then take into account some values that were 

previously omitted. On the other hand, with the 

semantic tagging of the agent and patient of these 

verbal structures, it becomes possible to more 

accurately identify medical events, be it in a 

vacuum or with regard to their localization and 

their evolution on the patient’s timeline.  

We are now faced with two possible follow-ups. 

Firstly, an evaluation of the resource efficiency still 

needs to be done by integrating a temporal 

information extraction system to see how results 

can be increased and improved. Secondly, we need 

to extend the scope of the covered phenomena by 

listing specific aspectual and medical concepts 

such as the relapse, the chronicity or the worsening.
