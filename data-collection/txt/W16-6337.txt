Abstract 

The sentence is incomplete without a verb in a 
language. A verb is majorly responsible for 
giving the meaning to a sentence. Any sen-
tence can be represented in the form of a verb 
frame. Verb frames are mainly developed as a 
knowledge resource which can be used in var-
ious semantic level Natural Language Pro-
cessing (NLP) activities. This paper presents 
the Verbframator – a verb frame annotator 
tool which automatically extracts and gener-
ates verb frames of example sentences from 
Marathi wordnet. It also helps in generating 
Shakti Standard Format (SSF) files of the giv-
en example sentences. The generated verb 
frames and SSF files can be used in the de-
pendency tree banking and other NLP applica-
tions like machine translation, paraphrasing, 
natural language generation, etc. 

1 Introduction 

Verb is one of the most important part-of-speech 
(POS) category in any language. It plays a major 
role in understanding or defining a sentence. Sen-
tences in any language can be represented in the 
form of verb frames. Verb frame is made of verbal 
propositions and arguments of words around a giv-
en verb. It is required for creating dependency rela-
tions which leads to the development of a 
knowledge resource. These kinds of resources are 
always required for semantics related Natural Lan-
guage Processing (NLP) applications like machine 
translation, natural language generation, paraphras-
ing, etc. Development and analysis of verb frames 

for Indian languages is an emerging research topic 
in the field of NLP and computational linguistics.  

This paper presents a verb frame generator tool 
to semi-automatically annotate and generate verb 
frames using example sentences from wordnet. 
Marathi wordnet is used as a reference wordnet for 
this purpose. Marathi1 is an Indo-Aryan language 
spoken prominently in Maharashtra, India. Mara-
thi wordnet2 comes under the umbrella of 
IndoWordNet3 which currently has around 32183 
synsets and 43834 words, of which 3047 are verbs. 
The objective is to generate verb frames for these 
verbs using examples from Marathi wordnet. 

The paper covers explanation of the con-
cept, working of verb-frame tool, advantages and 
disadvantages of the tool and its applications. The 
immediate application of the output of this tool is 
to study Marathi sentences and their structures 
with the help of its generated verb-frames. This 
study will lead to development of rules and guide-
lines for verb-frame annotation process. 

In computational linguistics and natural lan-
guage processing, only few efforts have been taken 
to create this kind of resource for Indian languages. 
And in spite of Marathi being a morphologically 
rich, with sufficient resource availability, no re-
markable work has been found.  

In this paper, section 2 briefs the related work. 
Section 3 defines the verb frame. Section 4 dis-
cusses the work flow of verb frame annotator tool. 
Section 5 lists features and limitations of the tool. 
Section 6 concludes the paper with scope for im-
provement in the tool, followed by references.

2 Related Work 

Verb POS easily represents the activity, state or 
action in a text which can lead to its semantic in-
terpretation. This property of verb is useful in cre-
ating the necessary knowledge base required for 
NLP applications. Though, for English language, 
there is a substantial amount of work which has 
been done regarding the development and analysis 
using verb frames, but only limited work can be 
seen for Indian languages. This can be seen in the 
following research work. 

Begum et al. (2008) discussed their experience 
with the creation of verb frames for Hindi lan-
guage. These frames are further classified based on 
Paninian grammar framework using 6 karaka rela-
tions. The method followed by the authors consid-
ers the morphology, syntactic variations and 
semantics of the verb to divide it into different 
classes. This resource focuses on NLP related ac-
tivities for Hindi language.  

Based on similar approach, Ghosh (2014) creat-
ed a resource for verb frames for compound verbs 
in Bengali language. The objective of the paper 
was to investigate if the vector verb from the com-
pound verb is able to retain its case marking prop-
erties and argument structure or not. And also the 
knowledge and syntax associated with verb frames 
can be utilized for categorizing and analyzing the 
verb words for various NLP applications.  

Soni et al. (2013) explored the application of 
verb frames and the conjuncts in sentence simplifi-
cation for Hindi language. The method proposed 
by the authors includes usage of conjuncts as a first 
level of sentence simplification. This is followed 
by using verb frames enhanced with tense, aspect 
and modality features. It is a rule based system and 
its output was evaluated manually and automatical-
ly using BLEU score for the ease of readability and 
simplification.  

Other related work by Schulte (2009), 
Theakston et al. (2015) has also explored verb 
frames for English language.  

After reviewing these papers, the need for such 
kind of resource for Indian languages and a tool 
which can assist in the creation of this type of re-
sources became more apparent. Also, apart from 
English, language specific verb-frame analysis has 
been done for few Indian languages such as Hindi 
and Bengali. However, no attempt has been made 
for Marathi language in the domain of verb-frame 

creation and analysis. This paper aims to fill the 
gap in the literature by providing verb-frame tool 
for the study of verb frames. 

3 What is a Verb Frame? 

In any language, verb is a major part-of-speech 
category. Verbs are used to define actions, activi-
ties and states. The potential of verbs to choose 
their complements (arguments/adjuncts) is referred 
to as 'verb sub-categorization' or 'verb valency' and 
a combination of functional components that are 
evoked by a verb is called as verb frames.  

Verb frame typically is made of verbal proposi-
tions and arguments of words around a verb in a 
given sentence. Each of the propositional word in a 
verb frame has arguments such as an arc-label or 
semantic role label, its necessity in a frame, 
vibhakti (i.e. case marker), lexical type, relation 
with head verb, position with respect to head verb, 
etc. These verb frames are developed to generate 
dependency tree structures in a given language. 
Figure 1 shows a typical verb frame for a Marathi 
word घड (ghaDa, to happen).

4 Verb Frame Annotator : Verbframator 

Verb frame annotator interface or Verbframator 
is an online tool developed to extract the verb 
frames of example sentences from wordnet. It also 
generates the Shakti Standard Format (SSF) 
(Bharati et al., 2007) files for these example sen-
tences.  

The Verbframator is a semi-automatic tool 
which is developed in PHP and data is stored and 
maintained in MySQL verbframe database. The 
user input interface of Verbframator can be seen in 
figure 2.

this study we have used Marathi wordnet
work flow of this tool is shown in fi
ing are the steps used by Verbframator
verb frames:  
 

(1) Take wordnet data as an input 
id or verb:  
The Verbframator starts with the user i
put in the form of either verb’s 
a verb itself. The system is 
sentences from wordnet for 
annotation process. As shown in figure 
above, search can be done
synset id or a verb in Marathi

 
(2) Extract example sentence(s):

(a) If the user enters verb synset id then 
system checks if the verb is present in 
the context of the example sentence 
and extract the corresponding 
sentence. 

 
(b) If the user enters verb it

two possibilities: (i) if there is o
one synset for the input
system extracts exam
synset and (ii) if there are more than 
one synset then the sys
the synsets of the input verb
selects synsets one by one
synset is processed at a time

 
In both the cases (a) and (b) a
amples are extracted only if verb is present 
in the example sentence, else it will show 
corresponding error message. Also, if 
synsets have more than one example se

As shown in figure 2 
earch can be done by entering

cessed at a time.  

In both the cases (a) and (b) above, the ex-
amples are extracted only if verb is present 
in the example sentence, else it will show 
corresponding error message. Also, if 
synsets have more than one example sen-

tence then the system extracts only those 
examples in which the input verb appea

(3) Chunk example sentence(s):  
The input example sentence processed 
through the Marathi shallow parser4 which 
gives the chunked phrases of the input sen-
tence. This chunked output is manually 
validated by a lexicographer. This can be 
seen in figure 4. Once the chunking is 
done the annotator decides and marks the 
head verb chunk and clicks on ‘Extract 
Verb Frames’ button to extract verb 
frames. 

 
 

Figure 4: Verbframator sentence chunked output 
 
 

(4) Generate default verb frame(s): 
Once the chunking is done, the system au-
tomatically generates the default verb 
frame for an input example.  

 
 
 
Figure 5: Verbframator - default frame generator

w_parser.php 

The method to automatically generate the 
default verb frames is explained in detail 
in the next section. The default verb frame 
generated for a verb घडण े (ghaDaNe, to 
happen, to occur) can be seen in figure 5. 

 
(5) Validate extracted verb frame(s): 

The annotator manually validates the gen-
erated verb frame. Here, user has to do 
minimal validation as most of the fields in 
the verb frame are already entered by the 
system automatically. Once the validation 
is done by an annotator, user can store the 
verb frame, generate the verb frame or/and 
generate the SSF file.  
 

(6) Store the verb frame(s) data: 
Verb frames are stored in the verbframe 
database by using button ‘Store Verb 
Frames’. 
 

(7) Generate verb frame(s): 
We can generate the verb frames using 
button ‘Generate Verb Frames’. The verb 
frame(s) of the processed verb frame is 
generated in the standard verb frame for-
mat. The extracted verb frame can be seen 
in figure 6. 
 

 
 

Figure 6: Extracted verb frame for a verb घडघडघडघड 
 
 

(8) Generate SSF file: 
We can also generate SSF file of the pro-
cessed example sentence by clicking on 
‘Generate SSF File’. 
 

The process is repeated if there are more synsets 
for an input verb.

4.2 Method to Generate Default Verb Frames 

The default verb frames are automatically generat-
ed using (i) the tree annotated data and (ii) Marathi 
shallow parser output. While extracting verb frame 
features the Verbframator first checks if chunks 
are already present in the SSF tree annotated data-
base. If chunks are present then the corresponding 
arc label is extracted from the database else the arc 
label is extracted from the shallow parser output 
data.  

In extract features using tree annotated data ap-
proach, we automatically extract verb frame argu-
ments from the tree annotated files. These files are 
already annotated by the human experts and are 
available in SSF format. Currently, the system has 
used about 92 tree annotated SSF files having 5536 
sentences, 74476 words and 50813 chunks. This 
data continuously changes and new annotated data 
is appended to the existing data. Our offline system 
preprocesses this tree annotated data and features 
like arc labels, lex type and other necessary infor-
mation are extracted from this annotated data. The 
SSF tree annotated data and extracted features are 
stored in the verbframe database. This is an ongo-
ing process where the feature extraction is done on 
tree annotated data as and when new tree annotated 
data is added to the offline preprocessing system.  

In extract features using Marathi shallow parser 
approach, if the required features are not available 
in verbframe database then the Marathi shallow 
parser tool is used to extract these features. The 
verb frame features such as vibhakti’s and lexical 
type can be extracted using the output of the shal-
low parser tool. The extracted output can be 
mapped to get the vibhakti’s. This can be seen in 
table 1, 2, and 3.

5 Verbframator: Features and Limitations 

Salient features of Verbframator: 
• Verbframator reduces the manual effort of 

creating verb frames.  
 
• Verb frames are automatically extracted 

which requires minimal validation. 
 
• It also generates SSF files of the input verb 

sentences. 
 
• Helps in analyzing the generated verb 

frames and constructing similar patterns 
for a given verb. 

 
• verbframe database stores verb frame and 

trained data in a systematic and classified 
manner. 

 
Limitations of Verbframator 
• Although Verbframator generates verb 

frames and SSF files automatically, it still 
requires manual intervention to complete 
some tasks. 
 

• In wordnet, not all verbs in a synset are 
explained using an example sentence. Only 
first frequently used verb appears in the 
example sentence. The example sentence 
is not available for rest of the verbs in a 
given synsets. Hence, verb frame for such 
sentences cannot be developed.   

 
• The Verbframator extracts examples hav-

ing input verbs only. 
 
• Quality of verb frames depends upon an-

notators understanding in annotating verb 
frames. Hence, inter-annotator-agreement 
should be of high value which can lead to 
better quality resource. 

 
• Quality of verb frames also depends upon 

the quality of trained data or gold data. 
  
• Currently Verbframator can be applicable 

only for wordnet sentences. It cannot be 
used for general corpus.  

 

 

6 Conclusion and Future Scope 

Verb is an important POS category for any lan-
guage. Verb frames are created to generate de-
pendency tree structures in a given language. This 
paper introduces an online tool Verbframator 
which semi-automatically extracts and generates 
verb frames using example sentences from Marathi 
wordnet. Verbframator also generates SSF format-
ted files of the given example sentences. These 
resources can be used in the dependency tree bank-
ing. In future, this verb frame annotator tool is to 
be made fully automatic. Also, this tool is to be 
expanded for other Indian languages under the 
umbrella of IndoWordNet. Sentences from other 
corpus are also to be included in the Verbframator.
