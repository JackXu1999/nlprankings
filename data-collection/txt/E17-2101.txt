Abstract

In this paper we study the impact of using
images to machine-translate user-generated e-
commerce product listings. We study how
a multi-modal Neural Machine Translation
(NMT) model compares to two text-only ap-
proaches: a conventional state-of-the-art atten-
tional NMT and a Statistical Machine Trans-
lation (SMT) model. User-generated product
listings often do not constitute grammatical
or well-formed sentences. More often than
not, they consist of the juxtaposition of short
phrases or keywords. We train our models
end-to-end as well as use text-only and multi-
modal NMT models for re-ranking n-best lists
generated by an SMT model. We qualita-
tively evaluate our user-generated training data
also analyse how adding synthetic data im-
pacts the results. We evaluate our models
quantitatively using BLEU and TER and find
that (i) additional synthetic data has a general
positive impact on text-only and multi-modal
NMT models, and that (ii) using a multi-modal
NMT model for re-ranking n-best lists im-
proves TER significantly across different n-
best list sizes.

1 Introduction
In e-commerce, there is a strong requirement to make
products accessible regardless of the customer’s native
language and home country, by leveraging the gains
available from machine translation (MT). Among the
challenges in automatic processing are the specialized
language and grammar for listing titles, as well as
a high percentage of user-generated content for non-
business sellers, who often are not native speakers
themselves.

We investigate the nature of user-generated auction
listings’ titles as listed on the eBay main site1. Prod-
uct listings contain extremely high trigram perplexi-
ties even if trained (and applied) on in-domain data,
which is a challenge not only for proper language mod-
els but also for automatic evaluation metrics such as the
n-gram precision-based BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002)

metric. Nevertheless, when presenting humans with
images of the product which come along with the auc-
tion titles, the listings are perceived as somewhere be-
tween “easy” and “neutral” to understand.

Images can bring useful complementary information
to MT (Calixto et al., 2012; Hitschler et al., 2016;
Huang et al., 2016). Therefore, we explore the potential
of multi-modal, multilingual MT of auction listings’ ti-
tles and product images from English into German. To
that end, we compare eBay’s production system, due to
service-level agreements a classic phrase-based statisti-
cal MT (PBSMT) system, with two neural MT (NMT)
systems. One of the NMT models is a text-only atten-
tional NMT and the other is a multi-modal attentional
NMT model trained using the product images as addi-
tional data.

PBSMT still outperforms both text-only and multi-
modal NMT models in the translation of product list-
ings, contrary to recent findings (Bentivogli et al.,
2016). Under the hypothesis that the amount of training
data could be the culprit and since curated multilingual,
multi-modal in-domain data is very expensive to ob-
tain, we back-translate monolingual listings and incor-
porate them as additional synthetic training data. Util-
ising synthetic data leads to big gains in performance
and ultimately brings NMT models closer to bridging
the gap with an optimized PBSMT system. We also
use multi-modal NMT models to rescore the output of
a PBSMT system and show significant improvements
in TER (Snover et al., 2006).

This paper is structured as follows. In §2 we describe
the text-only and multi-modal MT models we evaluate
and in §3 the data sets we used, also introducing and
discussing interesting findings. In §4 we discuss how
we structure our quantitative evaluation, and in §5 we
analyse and discuss our results. In §6 we discuss some
relevant related work and in §7 we draw conclusions
and devise future work.

2 Model

We first briefly introduce the two text-only baselines
used in this work: a PBSMT model (§2.1) and a text-
only attentive NMT model (§2.2). We then discuss the
doubly-attentive multi-modal NMT model that we use
in our experiments (§2.3), which is comparable to the
model introduced by Calixto et al. (2016).

dently attend to image patches and source-language words when generating translations.

2.1 Statistical Machine Translation (SMT)
We use a PBSMT model built with the Moses SMT
Toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007). The language model (LM)
is a 5-gram LM with modified Kneser-Ney smooth-
ing (Kneser and Ney, 1995). We use minimum error
rate training (Och, 2003) for tuning the model parame-
ters for BLEU scores.

2.2 Text-only Neural Machine Translation
(NMTt)

We use the attentive NMT model introduced by Bah-
danau et al. (2015) as our text-only NMT baseline.
It is based on the encoder–decoder framework and it
implements an attention mechanism over the source-
sentence words. Being X = (x1, x2, · · · , xN ) and
Y = (y1, y2, · · · , yM ) a one-hot representation of a
sentence in a source language and its translation into
a target language, respectively, the model is trained
to maximise the log-likelihood of the target given the
source.

The encoder is a bidirectional recurrent neural
network (Schuster and Paliwal, 1997) with GRU
units (Cho et al., 2014). The annotation vector for a
given source word xi, i ∈ [1, N ] is the concatenation
of forward and backward vectors hi =

[−→
hi;
←−
hi
]

ob-
tained with forward and backward RNNs, respectively,
and C = (h1,h2, · · · ,hN ) is the set of source annota-
tion vectors.

The decoder is also a recurrent neural network, more
specifically a neural LM (Bengio et al., 2003) condi-
tioned upon its past predictions via its previous hidden
state st−1 and the word emitted in the previous time
step yt−1, as well as the source sentence via an atten-

tion mechanism. The attention mechanism computes a
context vector ct for each time step t of the decoder
where this vector is a weighted sum of the source an-
notation vectors C:

esrct,i = (v
src
a )

T tanh(U srca st−1 +W

whereαsrct,i is the normalised alignment matrix between
each source annotation vector hi and the word to be
emitted at time step t, and vsrca , U

model parameters.

2.3 Multi-modal Neural Machine Translation
(NMTm)

We use a multi-modal NMT model similar to the one
introduced by Calixto et al. (2016), illustrated in Fig-
ure 1. It can be seen as an expansion of the attentive
NMT framework described in §2.2 with the addition of
a visual component to incorporate visual features.

We use a publicly available pre-trained Convolu-
tional Neural Network (CNN), namely the 50-layer
Residual network (ResNet-50) of He et al. (2015) to
extract convolutional image features (a1, · · · ,aL) for
all images in our dataset. These features are extracted
from the res4f layer and consist of a 196 x 1024 di-
mensional matrix where each row (i.e., a 1024D vec-
tor) represents features from a specific area and there-
fore only encodes information about that specific area

638



of the image. In our NMT experiments, the ResNet-50
network is fixed during training, and there is no fine-
tuning done for the translation task.

The visual attention mechanism computes a context
vector it for each time step t of the decoder similarly
to the textual attention mechanism described in §2.2:

eimgt,l = (v
img
a )

T tanh(U imga st−1 +W
img
a al), (4)

αimgt,l =
exp (eimgt,l )∑L

j=1 exp (e

, (5)

it =

αimgt,l al, (6)

where αimgt,l is the normalised alignment matrix be-
tween each image annotation vector al and the word
to be emitted at time step t, and vimga , U

img
a and W

img
a

are model parameters.

3 Data sets

The multi-modal NMT model we evaluate uses parallel
sentences and an image as input. Thus, we use the data
set of product listings and images produced by eBay.
They consist of 23, 697 triples of products, henceforth
original, containing each (i) a listing in English, (ii)
its translation into German and (iii) a product image.
Validation and test sets used in our experiments consist
of 480 and 444 triples, respectively.

The curation of parallel product listings with an
accompanying product image is costly and time-
consuming, so the in-domain data is rather small. More
easily accessible are monolingual German listings ac-
companied by the product image where the source text
input can be emulated by back-translating the target
listing. For this set of experiments, we use 83, 832 tu-
ples, henceforth mono. Finally, we also use the publicly
available Multi30k dataset (Elliott et al., 2016), a mul-
tilingual expansion of the original Flickr30k (Young et
al., 2014) with ∼30k pictures from Flickr, one descrip-
tion in English and one human translation of the En-
glish description into German.

Translating user-generated product listings has par-
ticular challenges; they are often ungrammatical and
can be difficult to interpret in isolation even by a native
speaker of the language, as can be seen in the examples
in Table 1. To further demonstrate this issue, in Table 2
we show the number of running words as well as the
perplexity scores obtained with LMs trained on three
sets of different German corpora: the Multi30k, eBay’s
in-domain data and a concatenation of the WMT 20152

Europarl (Koehn, 2005), Common Crawl and News
Commentary corpora (Bojar et al., 2015).3

2We use the German side of the English–German parallel
WMT 2015 corpora.

3These are 5-gram LMs trained with KenLM (Heafield et
al., 2013) using modified Kneser-Ney smoothing (Kneser and
Ney, 1995) on tokenized, lowercased data.

LMs trained on different corpora. WMT’15 is the con-
catenation of the Europarl, Common Crawl and News
Commentary corpora (the German side of the parallel
English–German corpora).

We see that different LM perplexities on eBay’s test
set are high even for an LM trained on eBay in-domain
data. LMs trained on mixed-domain corpora such as
the WMT 2015 corpora or the Multi30k have perplexi-
ties below 500 on the Multi30k test set, which is ex-
pected. However, when applied to eBay’s test data,
perplexities computed can be over 60k. Conversely, an
LM trained on eBay in-domain data, when applied to
the Multi30k test set, also computes very high perplex-
ity scores. These perplexity scores indicate that fluency
might not be a good metric to use in our study, i.e. we
should not expect a fluent machine-translated output of
a model trained on poorly fluent training data.

Clearly, translating user-generated product listings is
very challenging; for that reason, we decided to check
with humans how they perceive that data with and with-
out having the associated images available. We hy-
pothesise that images bring additional understanding to
their corresponding listings.

3.1 Source (target) product title–image
assessment

A human evaluator is presented with the English (Ger-
man) product listing. Half of them are also shown
the product image, whereas the other half is not. For
the first group, we ask two questions: (i) in the con-
text of the product image, how easy it is to understand
the English (German) product listing and (ii) how well
does the English (German) product listing describe the

product image. For the second group, we just ask
(i) how easy it is to understand the English (German)
product listing. In all cases humans must select from
a five-level Likert scale where in (i) answers range
from 1–Very easy to 5–Very difficult and in (ii) from
1–Very well to 5–Very poorly.

Table 3 suggests that the intelligibility of both the
English and German product listings are perceived to
be somewhere between “easy” and “neutral” when im-
ages are also available. It is notable that, for German,
there is a statistically significant difference between
the group who had access to the image and the prod-
uct listings (M=2.00, SD=.50) and the group who only
viewed the listings (M=2.83, ST=.30), where F(1,13) =
6.72, p < 0.05. Furthermore, humans find that prod-
uct listings describe the associated image somewhere
between “well” and “neutral” with no statistically sig-
nificant differences between the adequacy of product
listings and images in different languages.

Altogether, we have a strong indication that images
can indeed help an MT model translate product listings,
especially for translations into German.

4 Experimental setup
The PBSMT model we use as a baseline is trained on
120k in-domain parallel sentences (§2.1).

To measure how well multi-modal and text-only
NMT models perform when trained on exactly the
same data with and without images, respectively, we
trained them only on the original and the Multi30k (El-
liott et al., 2016) data sets. We also did not use any ad-
ditional parallel, but out-of-domain data that had been
used to train eBay’s PBSMT production system (see
Section 5). Training our text-only NMTt baseline on
this large corpus would not help shed more light on
how multi-modality helps MT, since it has no images
available and thus cannot be used to train the multi-
modal model NMTm. Rather, we report results of re-
ranking experiments using n-best lists generated by
eBay’s best-performing PBSMT production system.

In order to measure the impact of the training data
size on MT quality, we follow Sennrich et al. (2016)
and back-translate the mono German product listings
using our baseline NMTt model trained on the original
23, 697 German→English corpus (- images). These ad-
ditional synthetic data (including images) are added to
the original’s 23, 697 triples and used in our translation
experiments. We do not include the back-translated
data set when training NMT models for re-ranking n-

best lists to be able to evaluate these two scenarios in-
dependently.

We evaluate our models quantitatively using
BLEU4 (Papineni et al., 2002) and TER (Snover et
al., 2006) and report statistical significance computed
using approximate randomisation with the Multeval
toolkit (Clark et al., 2011).

5 Results
In Table 4 we present quantitative results obtained with
the two text-only baselines SMT and NMTt and one
multi-modal model NMTm.

It is clear that the gains from adding more data are
much more apparent to the multi-modal NMTm model
than to the two text-only ones. This can be attributed
to the fact that this model has access to more data,
i.e. image features, and consequently can learn bet-
ter representations derived from them. The PBSMT
model’s improvements are inconsistent; its TER score
even deteriorates by 0.5 with the additional data. The
same does not happen with the NMT models, which
both (text-only and multi-modal) benefit from the ad-
ditional data. Model NMTm’s gains are more than 3×
larger than that of models NMTt and SMT, indicat-
ing that they can properly exploit the additional data.
Nevertheless, even with the added back-translated data,
model NMTm still falls behind the PBSMT model both
in terms of BLEU and TER, although it seems to be
catching up as the data size increases.

In Table 5, we show results for re-ranking 10- and
100-best lists generated by eBay’s PBSMT production
system. This system was trained with additional data
sampled from out-of-domain corpora and also includes
extra features and optimizations. Its BLEU score on the
eBay test set is 29.0. Nevertheless, we still observe im-
provements in rescoring of n-best lists from this system
using our “weaker” NMT models. When n = 10, both
models NMTt and NMTm significantly improve the
baseline in terms of TER, with model NMTm perform-
ing slightly better. With larger lists (n = 100), it seems
that both neural models have more difficulty to re-rank.
Nonetheless, in this scenario model NMTm still sig-

while model NMTt shows differences in BLEU and
TER which are not statistically significant (p ≤ 0.05).
We note that model NMTm’s improvements in TER
are consistent across different n-best list sizes; model
NMTt’s improvements are not.

The best BLEU (= 29.4) and TER (= 52.1) scores
were achieved by model NMTm when applied to re-
rank 10-best lists, although model NMTm still im-
proves in terms of TER when n = 100. This suggests
that model NMTm can efficiently exploit the additional
multi-modal signals.

In order to check whether improvements observed
in TER could be due to a preference of text-only and
multi-modal NMT models for shorter sentences (Ta-
ble 5), we also computed the average length of transla-
tions for n-best lists re-ranked with each of our models,
and note that there is no significant difference between
the length of translations for the baseline and the re-
ranked models.

6 Related work
NMT has been successfully tackled by different groups
using the sequence-to-sequence framework (Kalch-
brenner and Blunsom, 2013; Cho et al., 2014;
Sutskever et al., 2014). However, multi-modal MT has
just recently been addressed by the MT community in
a shared task (Specia et al., 2016). In NMT, Bahdanau
et al. (2015) first proposed to use an attention mecha-
nism in the decoder. Their decoder learns to attend to
the relevant source-language words as it generates each
word of the target sentence. Since then, many authors
have proposed different ways to incorporate attention
into MT (Luong et al., 2015; Firat et al., 2016; Tu et
al., 2016).

In the context of image description generation
(IDG), Vinyals et al. (2015) proposed an influential
neural IDG model based on the sequence-to-sequence
framework and trained end-to-end. Elliott et al. (2015)
put forward a model to generate multilingual descrip-
tions of images by learning and transferring features
between two independent, non-attentive neural image
description models. Finally, Xu et al. (2015) proposed
an attention-based model where a model learns to at-
tend to specific areas of an image representation as it

generates its description in natural language with a soft-
attention mechanism.

Although no purely neural multi-modal model to
date has significantly improved on both text-only NMT
and SMT models on the Multi30k data set (Specia et
al., 2016), different research groups have proposed to
include images in re-ranking n-best lists generated by
an SMT system or directly in a NMT framework with
some success (Caglayan et al., 2016; Calixto et al.,
2016; Huang et al., 2016; Libovický et al., 2016; Shah
et al., 2016).

To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study
multi-modal NMT applied to the translation of product
listings, i.e. for the e-commerce domain.

7 Conclusions and Future work

In this paper, we investigate the potential impact of
multi-modal NMT in the context of e-commerce prod-
uct listings. With only a limited amount of multi-
modal and multilingual training data available, both
text-only and multi-modal NMT models still fail to out-
perform a productive SMT system, contrary to recent
findings (Bentivogli et al., 2016). However, the intro-
duction of back-translated data leads to substantial im-
provements, especially to a multi-modal NMT model.
This seems to be an interesting approach that we will
continue to explore in future work.

We also found that NMT models trained on small
in-domain data sets can still be successfully used to
rescore a standard PBSMT system with significant im-
provements in TER. Since we know from our experi-
ments with LM perplexities that these are very high for
e-commerce data. i.e. fluency is quite low, it seems
fitting that BLEU scores do not improve as much. In
future work, we will also conduct a human evaluation
of the translations generated by the various systems.
