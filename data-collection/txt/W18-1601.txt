Abstract

We present an approach to detect stylistic
variation across social variables (here: gen-
der and social class), considering also di-
achronic change in language use. For detec-
tion of stylistic variation, we use relative en-
tropy, measuring the difference between prob-
ability distributions at different linguistic lev-
els (here: lexis and grammar). In addition, by
relative entropy, we can determine which lin-
guistic units are related to stylistic variation.

1 Introduction

Understanding language/stylistic variation1 ac-
cording to social variables (such as gender, age
or social class) is of great interest to sociolinguis-
tics (Eckert, 1989; Labov, 1963; Bernstein, 1971;
Tagliamonte, 2006) and has recently received in-
creased attention in the NLP community for devel-
oping methods able to predict social context based
on language use (see Nguyen et al. (2016) for an
overview).

In this paper, we take a diachronic perspective
and study how language use in court proceedings
changes over a time span of approx. 200 years con-
sidering the interaction between gender and social
class. A major focus is on female of higher class,
as we hypothesize that as the inferior social posi-
tion of women was increasingly questioned from
the mid-nineteenth century, this might be reflected
in their language use2. For this, we use the Old
Bailey Corpus (Huber et al., 2016), a diachronic
corpus of manually socio-linguistically annotated
data of court proceedings raging from 1720 to
1913 (see Section 3.1). We apply an information-
theoretic approach using relative entropy, which

1We use stylistic variation in the sense of the workshop,
i.e. variation of linguistic levels based on extra-linguistic vari-
ables (here: social variables and time).

has been successfully applied for the analysis of
diachronic variation in language use investigating
the development of written scientific English (cf.
Degaetano-Ortlieb et al. (to appear); Degaetano-
Ortlieb and Teich (2016)).

We make two major contributions: First, we
investigate change in language use showing how
groups of gender and of lower vs. higher so-
cial class change linguistically over time. This
contributes not only to (historical) sociolinguis-
tics but also to the NLP community strengthen-
ing awareness of accounting for stylistic variation
and diachronic change in language use. Second,
rather than selecting predefined features to analyze
stylistic variation, we use whole linguistic levels
(lexis and grammar) as described in Section 3.2
from which stylistic features can be inferred.

After introducing related work (Section 2) as
well as our data set and methodology (Sec-
tion 3.2), we test our hypothesis of change in lan-
guage use for female of higher class investigating
stylistic variation (Section 4). Section 5 concludes
the paper with a brief summary and an outlook on
future work.

2 Related Work

Traditional sociolinguistic approaches on varia-
tion (Eckert, 1989; Labov, 1963; Milroy and Mil-
roy, 1985; Milroy and Gordon, 2003; Taglia-
monte, 2006; Trudgill, 1974; Weinreich et al.,
1968) work with surveys and relatively small but
detailed manually collected data. Variation is an-
alyzed considering single as well as several social
variables at a time, but the small sample size af-
fects generalization of the findings.

Increasing data availability of naturally occur-
ring text has lead to analyze sociolinguistic varia-
tion also in corpus- and computational linguistics,
especially within the social media domain (see

e.g. Eisenstein (2015); Eisenstein et al. (2011);
Nguyen et al. (2015); Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil
et al. (2013); Jurafsky et al. (2009)). Recently,
also the possible interplay between social vari-
ables is considered (Prabhakaran and Rambow,
2017), but is mostly confined to age and gender
(see e.g. Ardehaly and Culotta (2015); Argamon
et al. (2007); Barbieri (2008); Burger et al. (2011);
Eckert and McConnell-Ginet (2013); Holmes and
Meyerhoff (2003); Hovy and Søgaard (2015);
Nguyen et al. (2014); Peersman et al. (2011);
Schwartz et al. (2013); Wagner (2012)) as other
social variables – such as social class – are not eas-
ily available (cf. Sloan et al. (2015)).

In fact, the gap in coverage of other social vari-
ables has recently lead to a full strand of research
focusing on determining and analyzing income
through Twitter content using a wide range of fea-
tures. Preotiuc-Pietro et al. (2015a) use word clus-
ters and embeddings to predict occupational class
of Twitter users. Preoiuc-Pietro et al. (2015) ap-
ply non-linear methods for regression using be-
sides shallow textual features (e.g. average no. of
tweets) also user profile and psycho-demographic
features (e.g. no. of followers, gender, age) as well
as emotion features (e.g. positive/negative senti-
ments). Hasanuzzaman et al. (2017) are the first to
use user cognitive structure in terms of the user’s
overall temporal orientation to predict income un-
covering a correlation between future temporal
orientation and income.

While the above mentioned literature is devoted
to social media giving valuable insights into soci-
olinguistic, behavioral and social science research
of the present, in this paper we study diachronic
change in language use of social groups in approx.
200 years of court proceedings.

Considering the linguistic levels at which vari-
ation according to social variables is analyzed, in
sociolinguistic approaches the phonological level
prevails, while in computational approaches the
lexical level is often reported to be best in predic-
tion tasks. Other linguistic levels were mostly ne-
glected often due to low performance of NLP tools
especially for social media (e.g. sentence parsing).
Recent advances in this direction have been made,
for example, by Flekova et al. (2016) using besides
surface features (e.g. length of tweets), readabil-
ity features (such as the Automatic Readability In-
dex or Gunning-Fog Index) as well as several style
features (such as explicitness, no. of hedges) also

syntax features by means of parts of speech.
In our study we are dealing with transcribed

spoken utterances from the court, i.e. spoken En-
glish in a relatively formal context, thus we can
consider besides lexical features also grammati-
cal features approximated by part-of-speech tri-
grams. Our lexical features include content as well
as function words, thus lexical as well as grammat-
ical features will both reflect stylistic variation.

Relative entropy as a measure of divergence be-
tween corpora has been already applied success-
fully for the analysis of written scientific English
from the 17th to the present (Degaetano-Ortlieb
et al., to appear; Degaetano-Ortlieb and Teich,
2016; Degaetano-Ortlieb and Stroetgen, 2018) and
for intra-textual variation, more precisely variation
within sections of research articles (Degaetano-
Ortlieb and Teich, 2017).

3 Data and Methods

3.1 Old Bailey Corpus
The court proceedings of the Old Bailey Court
in London contain transcribed utterances of the
court’s trials spanning from 1674 to 1913. Ac-
cording to Emsley et al. (2018) the City of London
“required that the publisher should provide a “true,
fair and perfect narrative” of the trials” and “wit-
ness testimony is the most fully reported element
of the trials”. Thus, the utterances in the proceed-
ings are arguably a relatively precise account of
spoken English of that period.

The Old Bailey Corpus (OBC; Huber et al.
(2016)) is built from a digitized version of the pro-
ceedings and spans from 1720 to 1913. It repre-
sents a balanced subset of the proceedings with
semi-automatically identified utterances. Each ut-
terance was semi-automatically annotated with so-
ciolinguistic information based on sociobiograph-
ical speaker data found in the context of the trials.
For this, an annotation tool was developed that first
automatically detected speakers based on a list of
7,500 male and female first names (approx. 95%
coverage) and in a second step allowed to scroll
through the data to annotate sociobiographical in-
formation. Witnesses, for example, had to begin
their statement by mentioning their profession (cf.
Huber et al. (2016)). The OBC amounts at ap-
prox. 14 million spoken words (around 750,000
words per decade). It is part-of-speech tagged with
CLAWS 7 (with reported accuracy of 95-98%) and
sociolinguistically annotated for speaker informa-

2



tion (gender, age, occupation according to the
HISCO standard), social class (HISCLASS stan-
dard), speaker role (defendant, interpreter, judge,
lawyer, victim, and witness), and textual informa-
tion (scribe, printer, publisher). In addition, the
corpus is divided up into years, decades and pe-
riods of fifty-years. The corpus is encoded in the
Corpus Query Processor (Evert, 2005) and avail-
able for download3 or on the CQPweb platform4.

For the analyses, we consider the socio-
linguistic annotations of gender (female, male)
and social class (higher, lower) as well as the fifty-
years time periods5. To control for speaker role, as
there are no female judges or lawyers, we confine
our data set to the roles of victim and witness. Ta-
ble 1 gives an overview on the token size of each
subcorpus.

3.2 Detection of stylistic variation across
social variables

For detecting stylistic variation, we use the method
described in Fankhauser et al. (2014) based on
relative entropy, precisely Kullback-Leibler Di-
vergence (Kullback and Leibler, 1951). This ap-
proach allows us to compare probability distribu-
tions by measuring the number of additional bits
needed to encode a (sub)corpus A with an optimal
code for a (sub)corpus B.

D(A||B) =
∑

i

p(uniti|A)log2 p(uniti|A)
p(uniti|B)

(1)

To control for differences in vocabulary size,
the corpora are represented by means of uni-
gram language models which are smoothed with
Jelinek-Mercer smoothing and lambda 0.05 (cf.

1850: 1850-1899; 1900: 1900-1920.

Fankhauser et al. (2014) and Zhai and Lafferty
(2004)).

Here, we use relative entropy to measure the
difference between language use of female and
male of higher and lower class over time in bits.
Thus, we compare four groups (female higher
class (FH), female lower class (FL), male higher
class (MH) and male lower class (ML)) over five
time periods (1700, 1750, 1800, 1850, 1900). For
each comparison (i.e. comparison between two
groups, e.g. FH vs. FL 1700, FH vs. FL 1750, etc.)
a relative entropy (language) model is built. We
then compare the relative entropy values obtained
for each comparison to determine differences in
language use across social variables and time. The
higher the relative entropy value of a comparison,
the more apart the two groups are and vice versa.

Note also that Kullback-Leibler Divergence is
an asymmetric measure, i.e. a comparison of FH
vs. FL 1700 does not necessarily result in the same
relative entropy value as a comparison of FL vs.
FH 1700. For comparison of variation in language
use, the asymmetry is useful as it allows us to ac-
count for the directionality of the comparison.

For each comparison, we also obtain the indi-
vidual unit’s weight, i.e. how much a unit con-
tributes to the difference. For example, compar-
ing FH vs. FL 1700, we obtain the additional bits
needed for a unit in FH based on the unit’s proba-
bility in FL:

Dunit(FH||FL)1700 = p(unit|FH)log2 p(unit|FH)
p(unit|FL)

(2)

The higher the relative entropy value of a unit, the
greater the unit’s contribution to the difference, i.e.
the more distinctive the unit is for a given group in
a time period. In addition, for each comparison
we test for significance of the relative frequency
of a unit in the two groups by an unpaired Welch’s
t-test (threshold of a p-value<0.05):

t =
meanFH −meanFL√

(varFHnFH +
varFL
nFL

)
(3)

with var denoting the variance and n the num-
ber of documents in a group (cf. Fankhauser et al.
(2014)).

To consider differences at the lexical level, the
units for the relative entropy models are words. To
approximate the grammatical level, we use part-
of-speech (POS) trigrams as units.

In comparison to other corpus-linguistic ap-
proaches, such as classification (e.g. Teich et al.

3



(2016)) or correspondence analysis (e.g. Glynn
(2014)) just to mention a few, relative entropy
directly measures the divergence between two
groups in bits of information. The contribution
of each unit to the divergence provides valuable
insights into which units are distinctive for each
group.

4 Stylistic variation across gender and
social class

We investigate stylistic variation considering the
interaction between gender and social class at two
linguistic levels (lexis and grammar). Our focus
is on change in language use of female higher
class. Women’s social position was increasingly
questioned in the mid-nineteenth century. We hy-
pothesize that this movement might be reflected in
a change in language use of female higher class
when compared to female lower class as well as
male higher and lower class. As appropriate, we
will also compare diachronic tendencies of the
other groups.

Our concrete research questions are the follow-
ing: (i) Is there a difference in language use be-
tween female higher class compared to female
lower class and male higher and lower class, (ii)
if so, which lexical and grammatical units con-
tribute to these differences, (iii) do these differ-
ences change over time?

4.1 Lexical level
At the lexical level, we compare each group by
relative entropy using words. From Figure 1, we
can see that from 1700 to 1800 relative entropy
between female higher class (FH) vs. female and
male lower class (FL and ML) is lower (below
0.2 bits) than vs. male higher class (MH) (above
0.2 bits with a slight increases to 0.3 towards the
period of 1800). Thus, for female higher class
around 0.8 to 0.15 additional bits are needed in
comparison to male higher class than from the
lower class. After 1800 this changes, based on
words FH becomes less distinct to MH (towards
0.2 bits), while it becomes more distinct from the
lower class (vs. ML 0.2825 bits, i.e. 0.065 more
bits than FHvsMH, and vs. FL 0.38 bits, i.e. 0.17
more bits than FHvsMH, in the period of 1900).

Let us compare this to male higher class (MH)
vs. the other groups. From Figure 2, we see how
relative entropy of MH vs. ML is relatively low
(around 0.1 bits). Compared to female (FH and

FL) relative entropy is higher, especially in 1700
to 1750 (i.e. around 0.2-0.25 more bits). Towards
1800 relative entropy of MH vs. FH and FL de-
creases. After 1800, relative entropy remains sta-
ble for MH vs. FH, while MH vs. FL increases.

Comparing Figure 1 and 2, we can see how
relative entropy reflects quite well the difference
related to the communicative experience of lan-
guage users. Compare, for example, FH vs. MH
(Figure 1) and MH vs. FH (Figure 2) in 1900
(0.2825 bits for MH vs. FH and 0.2175 bits for
FH vs. MH). Here relative entropy differs due to
the asymmetry of Kullback-Leibler Divergence,
which allows us to model differences depending
on the directionality of the comparison. Thus, if
a language model of male higher class is used to
predict language use of female higher class, we
obtain a lower relative entropy value than vice
versa. Intuitively this means that male of higher
class can better understand female of higher class
(here: based on words), while female of higher

4



class need more effort (more bits) to understand
male of higher class.

Let us now consider which units (here: words)
contribute most to the attested differences. Con-
sider the comparison between female higher class
(FH) vs. female lower class (FL). How is the in-
creasing difference as depicted by relative entropy
(see again Figure 1) reflected in the use of words?
For this, we inspect the contribution of each word
to the difference (as described in Section 3.2) and
visualize this in a word cloud (using the visualiza-
tion approach by Fankhauser et al. (2014)). The
size of the word denotes its contribution by rel-
ative entropy (in bits), the color denotes relative
frequency of each word in a time period (from red
for high relative frequency to blue for low relative
frequency). From these clouds, we can detect vari-
ation in terms of words indicating lexical as well
as stylistic differences.

As for lexical differences, FL speak distinc-
tively about authorities (sir, master, mistress, mr,
mrs) and objects (door, kitchen, bedside) related to
the household; FH use distinctively business ori-
ented vocabulary (counter, penny, profit, purchase,
business) and words for persons related to either
marriage (husband, wife) or crime (officer, pris-
oner).

Considering stylistic differences, while FL dis-
tinctively use personal pronouns (e.g. his, I, me,
he, him) and verbs (e.g. carry, become, wash,
work, coming, went, going), FH in comparison to
FL over time develop a pronounced nominal style
with distinctive use of nouns, definite determin-
ers (a, an), and prepositions (of, in). Thus, female
lower class use increasingly an involved verbal
style over time, while female higher class make
use of a nominal more informational style when
compared to one another (cf. Conrad and Biber
(2001, 28) for involved vs. informational produc-
tion).

4.2 Grammatical level
While stylistic differences can already be seen
when considering the lexical level, we consider
grammatical structures approximating them by
part-of-speech (POS) trigrams to detect more fine-
grained tendencies. Here, we again focus on the
differences between female of higher class com-
pared to the other groups. Relative entropy mod-
els are calculated on POS trigrams as described in
Section 3.2.

Figure 3: Words contributing to differences between
female of higher (FH) vs. lower class (FL) over time
(color denotes relative frequency, size relative entropy,
both relative to a time period)

The greatest difference in the use of POS tri-
grams lies between female of higher vs. lower
class with an increasing tendency over time (see
FHvsFL in Figure 4), while relative entropy is
lower for FH vs. male production (MH and ML).
This indicates that the distribution of POS trigrams
of female higher class is more similar to both male
of higher and lower class than female of lower
class.

class, we consider the contribution in bits of each
POS trigram. Table 2 and 3 show the top 5 POS
trigrams categorized into phrase/clause types for
1700 and 1900, respectively. In 1700, FL are
distinguished from FH by a pronounced interac-
tional style, while FH from FL by an interactional
style combined with relational clauses (see exam-
ple (1)). Comparing the phrase/clause types di-
achronically, female of higher class develop over
time a nominal style (see example (2)) that dis-
tinguishes them from female of lower class, who
stick to an involved verbal style (VP interact.; see
examples (3) and (4)). While this is in line with
the observations made at the lexical level (cf. Sec-
tion 4.1), we can see which phrase/clause types are
used distinctively.

(1) I am Nurse at the Hospital; Mr. Fern ex-
amin’d the Child; she has a soul Glect,
and is ulcerated in the privy Parts. (Female
higher class 1733; HISCLASS 4; HISCO label: Pro-

fessional Nurse, General)

(2) I was taken to Bow Street, where a number
of people were put up for the purposes of
identification. [...] In fact, I picked some-
body else, a man whom I afterwards dis-
covered to be called George Dacey. (Fe-
male higher class 1907; HISCLASS 4; HISCO la-

bel: Mail Distribution Clerk, General)

(3) I keep a House in Bell-Yard in King’s-
street, Westminster, where I sell Greens
and Fruit. (Female lower class 1734; HISCLASS
116; HISCO label: Other Street Vendors, Canvassers

and News Vendors))

(4) I am a barmaid at a public-house in Tot-
tenham on April 10th I had been out, and
as I was returning home I met the prose-
cutor he and I and another man walked
along the road together [...] (Female lower
class 1902; HISCLASS 9; HISCO label: Bartender)

POS trigrams distinctive for female higher class
against all other groups are shown in Table 4 for
1700 and Table 5 for 1900. In 1700 (Table 4), in-
teractional style is a pronounced marker of distinc-
tion, with relational clauses when compared to FL
(as shown in Table 2), and with adverbial phrases,
possessive phrases and negation when compared
to male production (MH and ML). Also, com-
pared to either MH or ML, four out of five POS
trigrams are identical (marked in bold). Thus, fe-
male higher class differ almost in the same way
from male higher and lower class.

In 1900 (see Table 5), interactional style for FH
is less distinctive (1 POS trigram compared to FL;
2 compared to MH; 1 compared to ML). Com-
pared to FL, nominal style and passive voice are
highest ranking. In comparison to both male pro-
ductions (MH and ML), an adverbial/prepositional
phrase and an interactional verb phrase are distinc-
tive (marked in bold). In addition, compared to
MH, a genitive noun phrase is highest ranking as
well as a further adverbial phrase (AdvP). Com-
parison to both lower class groups (FL and ML)
shows nominal style to be most distinctive: a noun
phrase followed by a preposition (pointing to com-
plex nominal phrases) is highest ranking (marked
in bold).

To observe more general diachronic tendencies,
we consider all top 30 POS trigrams of each com-
parison (i.e. for FHvsFL, FHvsMH and FHvsML).
Based on the number of POS trigrams related to a

61-5 stand for higher, 6-13 for lower class.

(VP interact.) become less distinctive for female

up, and came to me) as well as adverbial and
prepositional phrases are less distinctive over time.
The percentage of nominal style distinctive for fe-
male higher class increases over time (from 15%

5 Conclusion

We have presented an approach to investigate
stylistic variation across social variables and time
at two linguistic levels: lexis and grammar. Our
focus was on language use of female of higher
class in court proceedings over the time span of
approx. 200 years. We asked whether the uprising
feminist movement from the mid-nineteenth cen-
tury, questioning the women’s inferior social po-
sition, is reflected in a change in language use of
female higher class.

In terms of methods, we have used relative
entropy according to Fankhauser et al. (2014),
which allows us to measure the difference between
probability distributions of linguistic units (here:
words and POS trigrams). At the lexical level, lex-
ical as well as stylistic differences have been iden-
tified. At the grammatical level, more fine-grained
stylistic differences have been detected: female of
higher class developed over time a nominal more
informational style that increasingly differs from
female of lower class.

While we have focused on female of higher
class, in our ongoing work, we are analyzing the
development of each group. Moreover, we will
also consider the other roles in the trials, which
will give more detailed insights into the develop-
ment of language use in court trials. Also, while
we use social class distinction based on higher and
lower class, a more fine-grained distinction could
be used as the OBC is annotated on a scale from 1-
13. Instead of considering fifty-years time periods
for comparison, in future work we aim to detect in
which time span a particular change takes place.

In terms of contributions, by using an approach
based on information theory (i.e. relative entropy),
we are able to model language use and directly
compare different groups of language users with
one another, also obtaining linguistic units distinc-
tively used across groups. The models are based
on whole linguistic levels rather than on prede-
fined features. This allows for a systematic ac-
count of language/stylistic variation. Also, we
have shown that stylistic variation of groups may
well change over time.
