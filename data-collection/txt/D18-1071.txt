Abstract

Traditional neural language models tend to
generate generic replies with poor logic and
no emotion. In this paper, a syntactically con-
strained bidirectional-asynchronous approach
for emotional conversation generation (E-
SCBA) is proposed to address this issue. In
our model, pre-generated emotion keywords
and topic keywords are asynchronously intro-
duced into the process of decoding. It is much
different from most existing methods which
generate replies from the first word to the last.
Through experiments, the results indicate that
our approach not only improves the diversity
of replies, but gains a boost on both logic and
emotion compared with baselines.

1 Introduction

In recent years, as artificial intelligence has de-
veloped rapidly, researchers are pursuing tech-
nologies with greater similarities to human intel-
ligence. As a subjective factor, emotion performs
an elemental difference between humans and ma-
chines. In other words, machines that could under-
stand emotion would be more responsive to human
needs. For example, in education, positive emo-
tions improve students’ learning efficiency (Kort
et al., 2002). In healthcare, mood prediction can
be used in mental health counseling to help an-
ticipate and prevent suicide or depression (Taylor
et al., 2017; Jaques et al., 2017). To make machine
more intelligent, we must resolve the conundrum
of emotional interactions.

There are tons of researches about conversa-
tion, an important channel for communication be-
tween humans. And lots of work has recently been
carried out in open-domain conversation devoted
to generating meaningful replies (Vinyals and Le,
2015; Li et al., 2016; Serban et al., 2016). Unfor-
tunately, the factors considered in these methods
only concerns topic, like (Xing et al., 2017), where

they failed to take emotion into account. Unlike
the former, the work in (Zhou et al., 2017) first
addressed the emotional factor in large-scale con-
versation generation, and it showed that emotional
replies obtain superior performances compared to
the baselines that did not consider emotion. How-
ever, two defects still manifest themselves in the
aforementioned models. First, all methods above
only adopted a single factor (i.e., topic or emo-
tion), because of which the bias of information can
not comprehensively summarize the human con-
versations to achieve favorable results. Second,
the way that generates replies from the first word
to the last can lead to a decline in diversity, limited
by the high-frequency generic words in the begin-
ning (e.g., I and you), as argued in (Mou et al.,
2016).

The deficiencies above inspire us to introduce
a new approach called E-SCBA, studying both
emotion and topic. Three main contributions are
presented in this paper: (1) It conducts a study
of compound information, which constitutes the
syntactic constraint in the conversation generation.
(2) Different from the work in (Mou et al., 2016),
a bidirectional-asynchronous decoder with multi-
stage strategy is proposed to utilize the syntactic
constraint. It ensures the unobstructed communi-
cation between different information and allows
a fine-grained control of the reply to address the
problem of fluency and grammaticality as argued
in (Ghosh et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2017). (3)
Our experiments show that E-SCBA work better
on emotion, logic and diversity than the general
seq2seq and other models that consider only a sin-
gle factor during the generation.

2 Model

2.1 Overview

The whole process of emotional conversation gen-
eration consists of the following three steps:



679

Step I: Given a post, we first use two networks
combined with category embeddings to re-
spectively predict emotion keyword and topic
keyword that should appear in the final reply
(see Section 2.2).

Step II: After the prediction, a newly designed
decoder is used to introduce both keywords
into the content1, as shown in Figure 1. It
first produces a sequence of hidden states
based on the emotion keyword (Step I), and
then uses an emotional attention mechanism
to affect the generation of middle sequence,
which is based on the topic keyword (Step II).
The remaining two sides are ultimately gen-
erated by the combination of middle part and
keywords (Step III). A detailed description is
given in Section 2.3.

Step III: Finally, a direction selector is used to ar-
range the generated reply in a logically cor-
rect order by selecting the better one from
forward and backward forms of the reply
generated in the last step (see Section 2.4).

In this work, we default that the replies contain
at least one emotion keyword and one topic key-
word, which are expected to appear in the dictio-
naries we used.

2.2 Keyword Predictor
The keywords to be selected are pre-stored in the
prepared dictionaries. The adopted emotion dic-
tionary was proposed by (Xu et al., 2008), which
contains 27,466 emotion words divided into 7 cat-
egories: Happy, Like, Surprise, Sad, Fear, Angry
and Disgust. The adopted topic dictionary was ob-
tained by the LDA model (Blei et al., 2003), in-
cluding 10 categories with 100 words for each cat-
egory. And to avoid situations in which emotion
and topic keywords are predicted to be the same
word, all the overlapping words in these two dic-
tionaries default to emotion keywords.

The prediction of emotion and topic keywords
follows the similar path. We first derive topic cate-
gory and emotion category from the post with two
classifiers separately. To be more specific, the pre-
trained LDA model is used for the topic category
inference. And the work in (Sun et al., 2018) is ap-
plied for emotion. The concrete model is an emo-

itively interpreted as relative positions of emotion words and
topic words, as well as different combinations between them.

tion transfer network. Given a specific external
stimuli (e.g., a sentence), the network produce an
emotional response, which is specifically an emo-
tion category in this work. After this, combining
the sum of hidden states h̃ =

∑T
i=1 hi from en-

coder and the category embeddings k = {ket, ktp},
keywords are predicted as follows:

p(wket|x, ket) = softmax(Wwet[h̃; ket]) (1)

p(wktp|x, ktp) = softmax(Wwtp[h̃; ktp]) (2)

where wket and w
k
tp separately represent the emo-

tion keyword and topic keyword that are expected
to appear in the reply.

2.3 Bidirectional-Asynchronous Decoder
Due to the decoder architecture shown in Figure
1, we suppose the reply in this section is y =
(yct, wktp,y

md, wket,y
ce)2 where ymd is the mid-

dle part between two keywords and yct, yce rep-
resent the remaining sides connected to the topic
keyword and emotion keyword. The generation
of middle part ymd = (ymd1 , ..., y

md
K ) can be de-

scribed as follows:

cetj = f
et
att(s

tp
j−1, {s

′
i=1) (3)

p(ymd|x,wk) =
K∏
j=1

p(ymdj |ymdj−1, s

et
j ) (4)

where wk = < wket, w
k
tp > represents the set of

keywords, seti and s
tp
j separately represent the de-

coding state of the steps that introduce emotion
keyword and topic keyword. cetj is the emotional
constrain unit at time j, computing by the emotion
control function fetatt as follows:

cetj =
K′∑
i=1

αetj,is

αetj,i =

where eetj,i represents the impact scores of the emo-
tion state seti on the topic state s

j−1.

After generating the middle part, we connect it
with the keywords to form a new sequence. Two
seq2seq models are used to encode the connected

the target replies to meet the requirement.

sequences and decode yce = (yce1 , ..., y
ce
M ) and

yct = (yct1 , ..., y
ct
N ), as below:

p(yce|wk,ymd) = p(yce|[wktp,ymd,f , wket]) (8)

p(yct|wk,ymd) = p(yct|[wket,ymd,b, wktp]) (9)

where ymd,f and ymd,b are the forward and back-
ward situations of the middle part, respectively.

2.4 Direction Selector

To make the samples meet the requirements of de-
coder, by default we place the topic keyword as the
first keyword on the left and the emotion keyword
on the right in training. However, in real situa-
tions, the topic keyword does not always appear
before the emotion keyword, where we must de-
termine correct direction by the machine.

By connecting the results in the preceding sec-
tion, we get yf = (yct,b, wktp,y

md,f , wket,y
ce,f ) as

the forward situation and yb means the backward
situation. GRU networks are used as encoders to
process sequences in different situations, which do
not share parameters. And the direction is pre-
dicted by:

p(d|yf ,yb) = sigmoid(Wd[h̃d,f , h̃d,b]) (10)

h̃d,∗ =

T ′∑
i=1

GRU(y∗i ) (11)

where ∗ ∈ {f , b}means forward or backward. Af-
ter the operation completes, one of the sequences
yf and yb should conform to our expectations.

3 Experiment

3.1 Data

We evaluated and trained E-SCBA on the emo-
tional conversation dataset NLPCC2017. There
are a total of 1,119,201 Chinese post-reply pairs
in the set. The dictionaries mentioned in Sec-
tion 2.2 were used to mark the conversation. The
cases whose replies contain both emotion key-
words and topic keywords account for 42.6%
(476,121) of the total3, which are suitable data
for the bidirectional-asynchronous decoder. We
randomly sampled 8,000 for validation, 3,000 for
testing and the rest for training. We also sampled
another 60,000 pairs from the training set to train
the LDA model4 mentioned in Section 2.2. Be-
sides, an error analysis is presented based on a
Chinese movie subtitle dataset which is collected
from the Internet.

3.2 Metrics

To evaluate our approach, we use the metrics as
below:

Embedding-based Metrics: We measure the
similarity computed by cosine distance between
a candidate reply and the target reply using
sentence-level embedding, following the work in
(Liu et al., 2016; Serban et al., 2017).

3Please note that we did not use the original labels of the
dataset, but the emotion categories of the keywords as labels
to avoid unnecessary bias. For cases that contain multiple
topic keywords or emotion keywords, we chose the keywords
that appear less frequently to reduce imbalances.

4High frequency words and stop words, which have no
benefit to the topics, were removed in advance.

Table 2: The results of automatic evaluation (G–E

Distinct Metrics: By computing the number
of different unigrams (Distinct-1) and bigrams
(Distinct-2), we measure information and diversity
in the candidate replies, following the work in (Li
et al., 2016; Xing et al., 2017).

Human Annotations: We asked four annota-
tors to evaluate the replies5 generated from our ap-
proach and baselines from Consistency, Logic and
Emotion. Consistency measures fluency and gram-
maticality of the reply on a three-point scale: 0, 1,
2; Logic measures the degree to which the post and
the reply logically match on a three-point scale6 as
above; Emotion judges whether the reply includes
the right emotion. A score of 0 means the emotion
is wrong or there is no emotion, and a score of 1 is
the opposite.

3.3 Baselines

In the experiments, E-SCBA is compared with the
following baselines:

S2S: the general seq2seq model with attention
method (Bahdanau et al., 2014).

5700 conservations in total, 100 for each emotion cate-
gory, were sampled randomly from the test set.

6If a reply is too short or turns up frequently, it would be
annotated as either 0 or 1 (if the annotator thought the reply
related to the post), like ”Me too” and ”I think so”.

S2S-STW: the model uses a synchronous
method that starts generating its reply solely and
directly from the topic keyword.

S2S-SEW: the model uses a synchronous
method that starts generating its reply solely and
directly from the emotion keyword.

S2S-AW: the model uses an asynchronous
method the same as (Mou et al., 2016).

The synchronous method in S2S-STW and S2S-
SEW was mentioned in (Mou et al., 2015), acting
as the contrast to the asynchronous models.

3.4 Results and Discussion

The results of automatic evaluation are shown in
Table 2. Compared with the best model (S2S-AW)
that considers only a single factor, E-SCBA makes
significant improvement on the distinct metrics
(+0.056 and +0.165), which verifies the effective-
ness of taking both emotion and topic information
into account to improve the diversity. Likewise,
our approach also respectively achieves 0.042,
0.068 and 0.043 gains on G-M, E-A and V-E, ben-
efiting from the compound information that cap-
tures the thrust of human conversation so that E-
SCBA has a better ability to learn the goal dis-
tribution. Furthermore, the grades of the asyn-
chronous models are higher than the synchronous
models on both kinds of metrics, showing that the
asynchronous method is a more suitable way for
content-introducing conversation generation.

Table 1 depicts the human annotations (t-test: p
< 0.05 for C and L, p < 0.01 for E). Overall, E-
SCBA outperforms S2S-AW on all three metrics,
where the compound information plays a positive
role in the comprehensive promotion. However,
in Surprise and Angry, the grades of Consistency
and Logic are not satisfactory, since the data for
them are much less than others (Surprise (1.2%)

and Angry (0.7%)). Besides, the score of Emo-
tion in Surprise has a big difference from others.
We think the reason is that the characteristic of
Surprise overlaps with other categories that have
much more data, such as Happy, which interferes
with the learning efficiency of the approach in Sur-
prise. Meanwhile, it is harder for annotators to de-
termine which one is the right emotion.

3.5 Case Study and Error Analysis
In this section, we sampled some typical cases
from a Chinese movie subtitle dataset to do a fur-
ther error analysis. The cases are shown in Table 3.
The post of weibo and movie subtitle are applied
in different scenes to obey different distributions.
The weaker correlation between training sets and
test sets can present a more reliable study.

The first three conversations are positive sam-
ples and others are negative samples that have con-
tent with flaws. For the reply in the antepenulti-
mate line, its problem is the faint emotion. Since
the emotion keyword in this sentence is a poly-
semic word, and it expresses a meaning with no
emotion here. Under diverse circumstances, a pol-
ysemic word probably have different meanings,
emotional or neutral. For example, the word ”like”
can be a generic word when it denotes similar, but
it can also be an emotion word when it denotes
enjoy. Same situation also occurs in Chinese. Be-
sides, we notice that if the LDA model pick a

meaningless topic keyword from the dictionary,
our approach may have a difficulty in generating a
diverse and long reply, as the reply in the penulti-
mate line. The lack of information causes generic
replies which are consisted of few words gener-
ated from the networks. The last line presents
another limitation. The emotion keyword hooli-
gan corresponds to the post and the topic keyword
looking forward to is meaningful, but the com-
bination of them, looking forward to a hooligan,
does not conform to the normal logic. This situ-
ation is caused by the fact that two kinds of key-
words are generated independently before decod-
ing, and it may cause a mismatch. In the future, we
will try to explore different network architectures
to make keywords interact with each other during
the generation.

4 Conclusion

In this paper, we proposed a novel conversation
generation approach (E-SCBA) to make a more
comprehensive optimization for the quality of re-
ply, which introduces both emotion and topic
knowledge into the generation. The newly de-
signed decoder makes use of syntactic knowledge
to constrain generation and ensures fluency and
grammaticality of reply. Experiments show that
our approach can generate replies that have rich
diversity and feature both emotion and logic.
