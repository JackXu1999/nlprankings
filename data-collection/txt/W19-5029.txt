Abstract

Textual data are useful to access expert infor-
mation. Since the texts are representative of
distinct language uses, it is necessary to build
specific corpora in order to be able to design
suitable NLP tools. In some domains, such as
medical domain, it may be complicated to ac-
cess the representative textual data and their
semantic annotations, while there exists a real
need for providing efficient tools and methods.
In this paper, we present a corpus of 717 clin-
ical cases written in French. We manually an-
notated this corpus into four general categories
(age, gender, outcome, and origin) for a to-
tal number of 2,835 annotations. The values
of age, gender, and outcome have been nor-
malized. We also manually annotated a subset
of 70 files into 27 fine-grained categories, for
a total number of 5,198 annotations. In addi-
tion, we present a few basic experiments made
on those annotations in order to highlight their
usefulness.

1 Introduction

In Natural Language Processing (NLP), texts are
useful to access information, especially expert in-
formation. Nevertheless, the linguistic diversity
(type of narratives, common or specialized vo-
cabulary, regular or complex syntactic structures,
etc.) requires robust tools to access the infor-
mation present in those texts. In order to build
suitable NLP-based tools, to model linguistic el-
ements (machine-learning, word-embeddings), or
to produce gold standards for evaluating automatic
systems, texts are needed (Nadkarni et al., 2011).
However, due to privacy and ethical reasons, doc-
uments from specialized domains (e.g., clinical
notes or justice decisions) are not easily accessi-
ble unless authorization (Chapman et al., 2011).

When such data exist for the research, they are
generally limited to English language, such as the
MIMIC-III database (Johnson et al., 2016) and de-
rived corpora. For French language, the Quaero
medical corpus (Névéol et al., 2014) is composed
of a limited number of documents (13 documents
from the European Medicines Agency, 25 docu-
ments from the European Patent Organization) or
very short documents (2,500 Medline titles).

In order to make available documents con-
cerned by privacy issues, de-identification tech-
niques have been widely used to replace nomina-
tive data by plausible information (Meystre et al.,
2010; Kayaalp, 2017). Despite the recent im-
provements of these techniques, especially based
on artificial neural networks (Dernoncourt et al.,
2017), one can not assure that all nominative
data have been removed and humans must further
check those documents. Another solution relies
on the production of synthetic data (Lohr et al.,
2018). Originally, they were generated and used
to train OCR systems for handwriting recognition
(Doermann and Yao, 1995). They are now used
when original data are missing or to provide more
data, despite their artificial character (Eger et al.,
2019). Besides, whether the texts are de-identified
or artificially generated, their linguistic specificity
will have an impact on further designed NLP rule-
based and statistically-based approaches.

In this paper, we present the semantic annota-
tions we made on a corpus of clinical cases writ-
ten in French by domain experts. Since this cor-
pus is composed of already published and freely
accessible clinical cases, our aim is to make this
annotated corpus available for the research. In or-
der to present the usefulness of those annotations,
we present a few basic experiments we made.

2 Corpus and annotation guidelines

2.1 Corpus
In the clinical domain, in order to overcome the
privacy and ethical issues when working on elec-
tronic health records, one solution consists in us-
ing clinical case reports. Indeed, it is quite com-
mon to find freely available publications from sci-
entific journals which report in clinical cases of
real de-identified or fake patients. Such clinical
cases are usually published and discussed to im-
prove medical knowledge (Atkinson, 1992) of col-
leagues and medical students. One may find sci-
entific journals specifically dedicated to case re-
ports, such as the Journal of Medical Case Reports
launched in 2006 (Rison et al., 2017). Clinical
cases consist of a detailed and hierarchically struc-
tured description of history, signs and symptoms,
diseases, tests, treatments, follow-up and outcome
of a given patient or of a cohort of patients (Rison,
2013). As pinpointed by Lysanets et al. (2017),
clinical cases are composed of linguistic particu-
larities which constitute a specific genre of medi-
cal texts: active voice sentences, past simple tense,
personal pronouns, and modal verbs. Beyond this
warning, they represent both an available and use-
ful clinical content, especially for the NLP com-
munity for which the access to EHRs is becoming
harder and harder.

We assume that this new orientation to tackle
the medical data accessibility problem may be-
come popular in the years to come within the
biomedical domain. Let’s for instance mention the
work by Satomura and Amaral (1992), which pro-
duced back in 90’s an automatic system designed
for the indexing of clinical cases with ICD-9
codes. These clinical cases written in English have
been extracted from the New England Journal of
Medicine and permitted the researchers to develop
their NLP system and to test it. More recently,
Gurulingappa et al. (2012) produced a benchmark
corpus composed of 3,000 clinical case reports in
English, which has been then annotated into sev-
eral categories (drug, dosage, and adverse effects),
and relationships among them in order to provide
mentions of adverse drug reactions.

The corpus we present in this work is composed
of 717 clinical case reports written in French (see
table 1 for general statistics). These cases have
been previously published and are freely acces-
sible. The cases from scientific literature often
go with their discussion and keywords. In this

work, we only focus on the clinical case descrip-
tion. This set has been manually annotated with
general and fine-grained information, which is de-
scribed in the two following sections. This cor-
pus is part of a larger and yet growing corpus,
which currently contains over 4,100 clinical cases
(Grabar et al., 2018).

Documents 717
Sentences 1,124
Words (occurrences) 26,787
Words (forms) 5,030

Table 1: General statistics on the corpus annotated in
this work

2.2 Annotations of general information
We considered four general categories of informa-
tion for the annotation. They are related to de-
mographic data (age and gender) and to medical
data (the starting medical problem or origin and
the outcome). Most of the clinical cases describe
the clinical events of one patient. Yet, some clin-
ical cases may be dedicated to the description of
several patients, in which case, all relevant infor-
mation are annotated for each patient. For this rea-
son, the total number of annotations may be higher
than the number of clinical cases. For three out
of four categories, the values are normalized and
taken from finite sets:

• Age ∈ N: numerical value rounded in years;
age in letters is converted into numerical
value;

• Gender ∈ { feminine, masculine };

• Outcome ∈ { recovery, improvement, stable
condition, worsening, death }.

Besides, when several ages are given for the same
patient, only the age at the moment of the main
clinical event is considered. For the category Ori-
gin, the values correspond to text spans describing
the initial medical problem.

Two scientists with a biomedical computer sci-
ence background created the annotations indepen-
dently, and then elaborated consensual annota-
tions. Hence, all spans of text providing the ex-
pected information were annotated. For the cat-
egory origin, the most inclusive text spans have
been chosen.



275

2.3 Annotations of fine-grained information

The corpus has also been enriched with fine-
grained annotations of entities concerning physi-
ology, surgery, diseases, drugs, temporal data, lab
and exam results. The annotations are based on the
semantic types from the UMLS (Lindberg et al.,
1993), on existing annotation guidelines such as
the I2B2 NLP Challenges (Uzuner et al., 2010,
2011), and on medical entities from our corpus.
We provide those annotations as a basis for sev-
eral NLP tasks such as information extraction or
automatic classification based on clinical entities.

In this section, we present the guidelines we de-
fined. For each category, we give a definition and
a few examples from the corpus.

2.3.1 Physiology
Body measurements: weight (71.8 kg), size
(165 cm), and body surface area (1.81 m2)

Vital signs: temperature (38.2 oC), and physio-
logical liquid mentions (blood, urine)

Biology: anatomical parts (left lung, thyroid),
localization of procedures or diseases (arterial,
pulmonary), and biological functions (pregnancy,
pulse)

2.3.2 Surgery
These categories are related to the surgery:

Medical speciality including the types of medi-
cal units (oncology, surgical care units).

Tests including names of tested elements (radio-
graphy, biological check-up, blood pressure)

Surgical treatments: treatments done by physi-
cians (chemotherapy, resection)

Surgical approach: access used by the physi-
cian (apical access)

Medical devices used by patients or by physi-
cians (drainage, mask, sensor)

2.3.3 Diseases
We considered four types of disease-related infor-
mation:

Pathology: mentions of diseases or diseased
condition (acute lymphoblastic leukemia, tumor)

Signs or symptoms which are not chronic dis-
eases (cough, fever, headache, hypertension)

Biological organism: bacteria and infectious or-
ganisms (escherichia coli, group B streptococcus)

Nature: indication of quality (qualifying adjec-
tives, grade) for diseases, signs and symptoms
(pT2 G1 carcinoma, benign cyst)

2.3.4 Drugs
Pharmaceutical class or family of drugs (an-
tibiotic, anticoagulant, anti-vitamin K)

Substance: commercial and generic drug names
or generic substance (acetaminophen, ferrous sul-
phate)

Concentration of molecules in drugs (10%,
5 mg/ml)

Mode of administration (intravenous, oral
route, by nebulization)

Dose: composed of value and unit for drug dose
(0.5 mg, four doses, one to two pills, three million
units) or rates (5 mg/kg). If a dose was changed
according to a past condition, the modification is
annotated among two normalized values (increase,
decrease)

2.3.5 Temporal data
Date: absolute and relative dates (January 2005)

Moment: moment of a day for drug intake or
surgical intervention (at bedtime, the morning) or
specific time during the hospital stay (at D1-D2)

Duration especially for treatments and diseases
(since 10 years, for four weeks)

Frequency for intakes, diseases, signs and
symptoms (once a day, if needed, chronic, every
two weeks)

2.3.6 Lab and exam results
This category is related to all numerical values
from lab results (105/80 mm Hg, 68 bpm) and anal-
ysis result from examination (e.g., normal for
imaging or palpation).

2.4 Additional information

Some categories are annotated with additional in-
formation.

2.4.1 Linguistic annotations
Similarly to Uzuner et al. (2011), we added asser-
tion values among the six tags possible: present,
absent, associated to someone else, conditional,



276

hypothetical, possible. Present : default value; Ab-
sent : element planned but not realized; Condi-
tional : element that can occur under certain cir-
cumstances; Hypothetical : element that may oc-
cur in the future; Possible: element that may oc-
cur; Associated to someone else: element con-
cerning family or acquaintances. Assertions may
be used for the annotation of the Pathology, Signs
and Symptoms, Tests, and Treatments categories.

2.4.2 Medical information
Linguistic interpretation: With Substances and
Weight, if the medication or the weight change ac-
cording to their previous values, this modification
is annotated according to two normalized values:
stop and titration for Substances, and gain and
loss for Weight.

Medical interpretation: For lab results (e.g.,
blood pressure) and physiological data (tempera-
ture), if values can be compared to known ranges
(external medical knowledge), three normalized
levels are used (high, normal, low) in order to pro-
vide a better comprehension of those values.

3 Annotated corpus

3.1 Inter-annotator agreement

The inter-annotator agreement is computed with
Cohen’s κ, and with Precision, Recall and F-
measure values (Sebastiani, 2002).

General information We computed inter-
annotator agreement scores on the normalized
values for general information: Age, Gender and
Outcome, and on the annotated text spans for
Origin. We achieved excellent agreements for
Age and Gender (κ=0.939), differences being
due to omissions; poor agreement for Outcome
(κ=0.369) due to differences of interpretation
between close values (e.g., recovery vs. im-
provement for long-term diseases); and very low
agreement for Origin (κ=-0.762) since spans of
text were often distinct between annotators. As
stated by Grouin et al. (2011), the κ metric is not
well suited for annotations of text since it relies
on a random baseline for which the number of
units that may be annotated is hard to define.
As a consequence, the classical F-measure is
often used as an approximation of inter-annotator
agreement. In the following experiments, we
present the inter-annotator agreements through
Precision, Recall, and F-measure.

Outcome The outcome value is complex
since differences between recovery and improve-
ment may imply more knowledge than the infor-
mation presented in the clinical case. As an exam-
ple, for a patient presenting arterial hypertension
at the consultation, do we consider a “recovery” or
an “improvement” when clinicians indicate a com-
plete remission 18 months after the intervention?
Can we consider a recovery for a remission? Is a
period of eighteen months sufficient to take a de-
cision? If no tumor recurrence after fifteen months
of decline is considered, since a tumor may appear
again, can we still consider a “recovery”?

At last, we made a difference between cancers
or malign tumors (“improvement”) and benign tu-
mors or other diseases (“recovery”). For chronic
diseases, we only considered an “improvement”.

Fine-grained categories In Table 2, we indicate
the inter-annotator agreement for the main cate-
gories from fine-grained annotations on a subset
of 70 clinical cases we annotated in duplicate.

Overall 0.4426 0.6924 0.5400

Table 2: Inter-annotator agreement for the main cate-
gories (fine-grained annotations) on the 70 files dataset

We observe that the categories yield better Re-
call than Precision, which means that similar units
are annotated by the two annotators. Yet, Preci-
sion values are often lower because the units may
correspond to different text spans. The average
agreement in terms of F-measure is 0.5400. This
first round of fine-grained annotations permitted
to elaborate strong annotation guidelines, which

is being applied to the whole set of 717 clinical
cases. We expect that the further annotations will
provide with better inter-annotator agreement.

3.2 Statistics

Table 3 indicates the number of annotations for
each fine-grained category based on a subset of
70 cases. The total number of annotations is 5,198,
which gives on average 74.3 annotations per case.

As shown on figure 1, all fine-grained categories
have not been used in each file. Six categories are
mainly used in the dataset of 70 files: Test (an-
notations found in 95.7% of all files), Localisa-
tion (90.0%), Sign or Symptom (78.6%), Anatomy
(75.7%), Pathology (72.9%), and Surgical Treat-
ment (68.6%).

Figure 1: Distribution of fine-grained annotations in the
dataset of 70 files (percentage)

Physiological information (body measurements
and vital signs) are found in a few number of files
(less than 10% of files from the dataset). Since
those types of information are useful for a limited
number of pathologies or signs or symptoms, they
have been found in few documents.

Table 4 presents the final number of annotations
on the four general categories and their distribu-
tion on the whole dataset of 717 files. Since a few
clinical cases describe several patients (either a co-
hort of patients or a pathology affecting several
patients), the total number of annotations may be
higher than the total number of files in the corpus.
This has been observed for Gender and Origin.

Category # Distribution
Age 717 from new born to 98 y.o.
Gender 727 317 feminine, 410 masculine
Outcome 678 227 recovery, 256 improve-

ment, 55 stable, 23 worsen-
ing, 117 death

Origin 722 722 distinct spans of text

Table 4: Number of mentions for the general informa-
tion annotations on the whole dataset of 717 files

Nevertheless, apart from the Gender category,
other general annotations are not found in all files:
Origin is present in 716 files (99.9% of files), Age
in 698 files (97.4%), and Outcome in 675 files
(94.1%). Annotations are missing when it was not
possible to identify the information.

Figure 2: Annotated case report. General information includes the following tags: genre (gender), âge (age),
origine (origin), issue (outcome). Other tags are related to fine-grained information. Normalized values appear
between square brackets (feminine gender, high or normal values, improvement outcome)

stage III prolapse totally neglected by the pa-
tient. She is in obstructive renal failure with blood
urea at 10 mmol/l serum. On the intravenous
urography, we notice a very significant bilateral
ureteropyelocaliceal dilation. The blood pressure
is 12/8. The pessary placement very quickly im-
proves the situation since four days later, the blood
urea is 6.4 mmol/l. The patient refuses any addi-
tional surgery and is then lost to follow-up. The
case is annotated with general and fine-grained
information. Elements in square brackets corre-
spond to normalized tags: feminine (“féminin”)
for gender, high (“haut”) and normal for values,
and improvement (“amélioration”) for outcome.

3.3.1 Types of information in the typical
clinical case report

This case report is composed of several parts, an-
notated as follows:

• general description with patient history:
gender (woman, “femme”); age (73-year-
old, “73 ans”); surgical treatment (cae-
sarean, “césarienne”); duration (for several
years, “depuis plusieurs années”); pathology
(stage III prolapse, “prolapsus de stade III”)

• origin of consultation, tests and results:
origin (obstructive renal failure, “insuffi-
sance rénale obstructive”), composed of
three elements: sign or symptom (fail-
ure, “insuffisance”), localization (renal,
“rénale”), and nature (obstructive, “obstruc-
tive”); three tests (blood urea, “urée san-
guine”, blood pressure, “tension artérielle”,
urography, “urographie”) with lab results
(10 mmol/l, 12/8, 6.4 mmol/l) and local-
ization (intravenous, “intraveineuse”); sign
or symptom (dilation, “dilatation”) with

localization (bilateral ureteropyelocaliceal,
“urétéropyélocalicielle bilatérale”) and na-
ture (very significant, “très importante”)

• surgical treatment and issue: medical device
(pessary, “pessaire”); outcome (very quickly
improves the situation, “améliore très rapi-
dement la situation”); moment (four days
later, “quatre jours plus tard”)

• follow-up: no annotation in this clinical case

We observe the types of information contained in
clinical case reports are similar to those typically
provided by patient health documents in hospitals.

3.3.2 Distribution of annotations

Columns two and three from Table 4 indicate that
general information are found in all clinical cases.
For gender and origin, the number of annotations
if higher than the number of clinical cases because
several people are described in some cases (gen-
der), and because several origins of consultation
may be indicated (namely, several signs or symp-
toms).

From Table 3, one can observe a very imbal-
anced number of annotations per category. The
main categories are: signs or symptoms (15.4%),
tests (15.1%), localizations (11.6%), substances
(8.4%), and anatomical parts (8.2%). The number
of signs and symptoms mentions are three times
higher than annotations of diseases (5.5%). Small
categories are related to specific data (especially
body measurements and vital signs) that are indi-
cated in a limited number of cases. This may cor-
respond to the average difference with the clinical
patient reports.

4 Experiments and analysis

The annotated corpus has been exploited to per-
form similar annotations automatically and for
their evaluation. Our aim is to verify the adequate-
ness of the annotations for this information extrac-
tion task, as well as to serve as baseline for future
work. We specify we do not aim to provide new
methods, nor to improve existing systems, but to
present a few use cases that may be done on the
annotations presented in section 2.

4.1 Linguistic analysis

Syntax. Depending on the outcome observed in
clinical cases, we studied the distribution of a few
verbal tenses based on the POS annotations pro-
vided by the TreeTagger system (Schmid, 1994).
As presented in Table 5, past perfect is the main
tense for death outcome while present is the main
tense for both improvement and stable condition
outcomes. Conversely, we observe no future tense
in case reports concerned by death.

Verbal tense R I S W D
future 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.00
imperfect 0.19 0.15 0.12 0.13 0.16
past perfect 0.41 0.41 0.41 0.41 0.45
present 0.23 0.29 0.29 0.24 0.26

Table 5: Percentage of verbal tenses use depending
on the outcome value (R=recovery, I=improvement,
S=stable, W=worsening, D=death)

Table 6 presents the distribution of demonstra-
tive pronouns (PRO:dem) vs. personal pronouns
(PRO:per) depending on the outcome. We observe
that impersonal linguistic constructions are mainly
used for stable condition outcomes (less personal
pronouns and more demonstrative pronouns) than
in other outcome types, as if the uncertainty of the
stable condition (no improvement nor worsening)
would prevent from a too much personal represen-
tation of the case.

POS tag R I S W D
PRO:dem 0.19 0.19 0.24 0.21 0.18
PRO:per 0.52 0.50 0.47 0.48 0.51

Table 6: Percentage of types of pronoun use
(PRO:dem=demonstrative, PRO:per=personal)
depending on the outcome value (R=recovery,
I=improvement, S=stable, W=worsening, D=death)

Semantics. Table 7 presents the main elements
annotated as anatomical parts, pathologies, signs
or symptoms, and surgical treatments depending
on the gender. The observed differences of med-
ical entities mainly highlight differences due to
anatomical parts specific to men or women, or to
distinct prevalences of pathologies. We observe
less differences in surgical treatments than in other
categories.

4.2 Information extraction

The information extraction experiments rely on
the Wapiti tool (Lavergne et al., 2010) that im-
plements linear chain CRF (Lafferty et al., 2001).
We trained a model on the 16 fine-grained cat-
egories presented in Table 2, through a 10 fold
cross-validation process, using a l1 regularization.
We used the following features: unigrams and
bigrams of tokens, number of characters, typo-
graphic case, presence of punctuation and digit,
Soundex code1 value of each token, relative po-
sition of token within the document (beginning,
middle, end), POS tags from the TreeTagger sys-

tem (Schmid, 1994) and syntactic chunks based on
those tags, presence of the token in a dictionary
of 251k inflected forms for French, and cluster id
(120 classes) of each token using the clustering
algorithm from Brown et al. (1992) implemented
by Liang (2005). The results that we achieved are
presented in table 8. Overall, we obtain 0.76 Pre-
cision, 0.45 Recall and 0.67 F-measure.

5 Discussion

Corpus. One contribution of this work is related
to the availability of the annotated corpus from the
medical domain for French. We based our annota-
tion schema on both existing ones (semantic types
from the UMLS, i2b2 NLP Challenges) and on
types of elements found in our corpus. This an-
notated corpus will be made available for the re-
search purposes and may be of interest for several
NLP tasks related to the biomedical domain: in-
formation extraction, relationships identification,
classification, discourse analysis, temporality, etc.

Human annotations vs. CRF. We observed
that results obtained by the designed CRF sys-
tem are in line with results obtained by humans
when annotating the corpus. More specifically,
while humans were producing the gold standard,
they had to deal with categories harder to process
than others. We also observe that those categories

are generally difficult to retrieve and annotate with
the CRF model as well: Concentration (F=0.38
vs. 0.13), Function (F=0.37 vs. 0.35), and Pathol-
ogy (F=0.36 vs. 0.31). An explanation is the lack
of regularity (for the CRF system) and ambiguous
content w.r.t. content from other categories.

Yet, two categories considered as hard for hu-
mans yielded better results than expected with the
CRF model: Specialty (F=0.25 vs. 0.56) and
Dates (F=0.40 vs. 0.67). The differences observed
between humans which produce those bad results
were mainly due to omissions. Conversely, hu-
mans outperformed the CRF model on Frequency
(F=0.68 vs. 0.33), Duration (F=0.66 vs. 0.42),
and Devices (F=0.46 vs. 0.09). Those categories
are composed of distinct elements with low fre-
quencies of use which are complex to process for
a probability-based system, but basic for humans.

As future work, we plan to continue the fine-
grained annotation of the whole corpus. We also
plan to define relationships between the existing
entities, in order to provide annotations of rela-
tions. Despite the absence of relationships anno-
tations, the corpus can still serve to perform unsu-
pervised experiments. Such results may be used
for automatic pre-annotation of relationships, in
order to make it easier the human annotation work.

6 Conclusion

In this paper, we presented a corpus composed
of 717 medical clinical case reports, written in
French, with two levels of annotations (general
and fine-grained annotations). Our annotation
schema is composed of four general categories
(age, gender, outcome, origin) for a total of
2,835 annotations, and 27 fine-grained categories
dealing with five domains (physiology, surgery,
diseases, drugs, temporal) for a total of 5,198 an-
notations on a subset of 70 files. For certain cat-
egories, the annotations are provided under a nor-
malized format (age, gender, outcome) while other
categories are associated with additional informa-
tion based on a human judgement, either of lin-
guistic nature (assertions, change of conditions)
or medical nature (lab results compared to known
ranges). The corpus and its annotations will be
made available for the research. We expect that the
availability of this corpus may boost the research
on biomedical textual data in French, and provide
the domain with more robust and stable tools lead-
ing to a better reproducibility of the results.
