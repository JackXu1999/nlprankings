Abstract 

This year's MedNLP (Morita and Kano, et al., 

2013) has two tasks: de-identification and 

complaint and diagnosis. We tested both ma-

chine learning based methods and an ad-hoc 

rule-based method for the two tasks. For the 

de-identification task, the rule-based method 

achieved slightly higher results, while for the 

complaint and diagnosis task, the machine 

learning based method had much higher re-

calls and overall scores. These results suggest 

that these methods should be applied selective-

ly depending on the nature of the information 

to be extracted, that is to say, whether it can be 

easily patternized or not. 

 

1 Introduction 

Machine learning based and rule-based methods 

are the two major approaches for extracting use-

ful information from natural language texts. To 

clarify the pros and cons of these two approaches, 

we applied both approaches to this year's 

MedNLP tasks: de-identification and complaint 

and diagnosis. 

For the de-identification task, ages and times, 

for example, are seemingly a type of information 

that can be patternized quite easily. In such cases, 

an ad-hoc rule-based method is expected to per-

form relatively well. In contrast, the complaint 

and diagnosis task would seem to have much 

more difficulty patternizing information, so a 

machine learning approach is expected to pro-

vide an effective methodology for tackling these 

problems. 

 

2 Machine Learning Approach 

In this section, we explain how the machine 

learning based approach works. 

2.1 Sequential Labeling by using CRF 

We formalized the information extraction task as 

a sequential labeling problem. A conditional ran-

dom field (CRF) (Lafferty and McCallum, et al., 

2001) was used as the learning algorithm. We 

used CRFsuite
1
, which is an implementation of 

first-order linear chain CRF. 

The CRF-based sequential labeling proceeds 

as follows. First, we applied a Japanese morpho-

logical parser (MeCab
2
) to documents and seg-

mented the sentences into tokens with part-of-

speech and reading. Then, the relationship be-

tween tokens was estimated using CaboCha
3
, 

which is a common implementation of the Japa-

nese dependency parser (Kudo and Matsumoto, 

2002). Finally, we extracted the features of the 

tokens and created models using CRFsuite. 

2.2 Basic Features 

We used the following features to capture the 

characteristics of the token: surface, part-of-

speech, and dictionary matching. The surface and 

part-of-speech of the target token were converted 

into numerical expressions in what is known as 

one-hot representation: the feature vector has the 

same length as the size of the vocabulary, and 

only one dimension is on. The dictionary feature 

is a binary expression that returns one if a word 

is in the dictionary and zero if not.

We prepared ten kinds of dictionaries featur-

ing age expressions, organ names, Japanese era 

names, family names, time expressions, names of 

hospital departments, disease names from the 

Japanese Wikipedia, Chinese characters related 

to diseases, suspicious expressions, and negative 

expressions. These dictionaries were created on 

the basis of the rules explained in Section 3. 

To capture the local context of a target token, 

we combined features of several neighbor tokens. 

First, we merged the features of five adjacent 

tokens. Let wi be the i-th token of the sentence. 

We concatenated the features of wi-2, wi-1, wi, 

wi+1, and wi+2 and created w[i-2:i+2] to express the 

i-th node. Second, we concatenated the features 

of w[i-2:i+2] and wi
src

 (wi
tgt

) to denote source (tar-

get) token of wi. 

2.3 Unsupervised Feature Learning 

In addition to the basic features, we used cluster-

ing-based word features (Turian and Ratinov, et 

al., 2010) to estimate clusters of words that ap-

pear only in test data. These clusters can be 

learned from unlabeled data by using Brown's 

algorithm (Brown and deSouza, et al., 1992), 

which clusters words to maximize the mutual 

information of bigrams. Brown clustering is a 

hierarchical clustering algorithm, which means 

we can choose the granularity of clustering after 

the learning process has been finished. 

We examined two kinds of Brown features: 

those created from training and test data related 

to the MedNLP Task (1,000 categories) and 

those created from the Japanese Wikipedia (100 

categories). We decreased the number of catego-

ries of the latter because clustering Wikipedia is 

computationally expensive. The computational 

time of Brown clustering is O(VK
2
), where V 

denotes the size of vocabularies and K denotes 

the number of categories. 

 

3 Rule-based Method  

In this section, we explain the rule-based method. 

3.1 De-identification task 

 <a>: age 

 The basic pattern is ''d1[歳才台代] (SAI 
(years old), SAI (years old), DAI (10's, 

20's, ..., etc.), DAI (10's, 20's, ..., etc.))'', 

where d1 is a positive integer, and 

[ABC] refers to A, B, or C. 

 If an age region is followed by specific 

modifiers "時|頃|[こご]ろ|代|[前後]半|

以[上下] (JI (when), KORO (about), 
DAI, ZENHAN (anterior half), 

KOUHAN (posterior half), IJOU (over), 

IKA (under))", that region is expanded 

to the end of the modifier. A disjunc-

tive expression ''aaa|bbb|ccc'' means aaa, 

bbb, or ccc. 

 If an age region is followed by one of in-

terval-markers "から |より |まで |～ 
(KARA (from), YORI (from), MADE 

(to))", that region is expanded to the 

end of the marker. 

 If one age region is followed by another 
age region directly or with only hy-

phen-type characters (-ー－―～) be-
tween them, the two regions are joined 

to one. 

 eg. <a>27 歳  (27 SAI (27 years 

old))</a>～<a>47 歳 (47 SAI (47 

years old))</a>→<a>27 歳～47

歳</a> 
 <t>: time 

 The basic pattern of time tags is "d1年

d2月 d3日 d4時 d5分 d6秒 (d1 NEN 
(year) d2 GATSU (month) d3 NICHI 

(day) d4 JI (hour) d5 FUN (minute) d6 

BYO (second))", where d1 to d6 are 

non-negative integers. Any partial pat-

tern starting from d1 or d2 or d3 is also 

eligible. 

 The special numerical pattern d1/d2 
(1900 <= d1 <= 2099, 1 <= d2 <= 12) 

is interpreted as year = d1 and month = 

d2. In addition, the special numerical 

pattern "d1/d2 [に|から|より|まで|～] 
(NI (at), KARA (from), YORI (from), 

MADE (to))" (1 <= d1 <= 12, 1 <= d2 

<= 31) is interpreted as month = d1 and 

day = d2. 

 Exceptional patterns are: "[同当即翌

前 ][日年月 ]|翌朝 |翌未明 |その後 
(same year, this year, next morning, ... 

etc.)". 

 While a time region is preceded by a pre-
fix-type modifier, or followed by a 

postfix-type modifier, the region is ex-

panded to the beginning or to the tail of 

the modifiers. 

 Prefix type modifiers: 

 [翌昨同当本][年月日] (last year, 
last month, same day, ... etc.) 

 AM/PM type prefix: 午 後 

(GOGO (PM))| 午 前 

39



(GOZEN (AM) | AM | am | 

PM | pm 

 Ambiguity type prefix: 約 | およ

そ  | ほぼ  | 概ね  (YAKU 
(about), OYOSO (about), 

HOBO (about), OOMUNE 

(about)) 

 Postfix type modifiers: 

 [上中下]旬|初め|午[前後]|深夜|

早朝|昼|朝方?|夕[方刻]?|[春

夏秋冬] (late at night, early in 
the morning, ...etc) 

 Ambiguity type: 頃 | ころ | ごろ 

| 前後 | 程 | 以[降後前] 
 Intervals (from ~~~ to ~~~) 

 <t>...<t> (から |より |まで |～) 

→ <t>... (から|より|まで|～) 
</t> 

 <t>aaaaa</t><t>bbbbb</t> → 
<t>aaaaa bbbbb</t> 

 <t>aaaaa</t> [[- ー － ― ～ ] 

<t>bbbbb</t> → <t>aaaaa [-

ー－―～] bbbbb </t> 
 <h>: hospital 

 First hospital tags were added by using 
the below hospital words dictionary 

composed of seven words, and tempo-

rary division tags were added by using 

the division-word dictionary of 27 

words. 

 Hospital words: 当院 |近医 |同院 |

病院|クリニック|総合病院|大学

病院  (TOUIN (my/our hospital), 
KINNI (near hospital), DOUIN 

(same hospital), BYOUIN (hospi-

tal), KURINIKKU (clinic), 

SOUGOUBYOUIN (general hos-

pital), DAIGAKUBYOUIN (uni-

versity hospital)  

 Division words: 外科|眼科|循環器

内科|皮膚科|内科 ... etc. (GEKA 
(surgery), GANKA (ophthalmolo-

gy), JUNKANKINAIKA (cardio-

vascular internal medicine), 

HIFUKA (dermatology), NAIKA 

(internal medicine) (27 words) 

 While a hospital region is preceded by 
any number of division regions, the 

hospital region is extended to the be-

ginning of the division regions. 

 <div> 内科 </div><div> 皮膚科

</div><h>病院</h> → <h>内科

皮膚科病院</h> 
 If a hospital region is preceded by a se-

quence of name characters (■), the re-
gion is expanded to the beginning of 

the name sequence. 

 ■■■<h>皮膚科病院</h> → 

<h>■■■皮膚科病院</h> 
 If a division region is preceded by a se-

quence of name characters, the region 

is expanded to the beginning of the 

name sequence, and the tag is changed 

to a hospital tag. 

 ■■■<div>内科</div> →<h>■

■■内科</h> 
 As a special case, if a name character se-

quence is followed by "[をに]?(紹介|

緊急 )(受診 |入院 ) (SHOKAI (refer), 
KINKYU (emergency), JUSIN (con-

sult), NYUIN (stay in hospital))", the 

name character sequence is taken as a 

hospital region. 

 ■■■[をに]?(紹介|緊急)(受診|

入院 ) →  <h>■■■ </h>[を

に]?(紹介|緊急)(受診|入院) 
 <p>: person name 

 This tag was skipped. 
 <x>: sex 

 The sex tags were added only by a sim-

ple pattern: "男性 |女性  (DANSEI 
(male), JOSEI (female))". 

3.2 Complaint and diagnosis task 

 All <c> tags of the training data were ex-
tracted and a dictionary of complaints was 

made containing 1,068 words 

 The <c> tags were added to the test data by 
the longest match method using the diction-

ary. In case of a single character word (咳 

and 痰), a tag is added only if both the pre-
ceding character and the following character 

are not Kanji characters. 

 If a <c> tag region is followed by the can-
celling expressions below, the <c> tag is 

cancelled. 

 postfix type cancelling expressions: [歴

剤量時室率]|検査|教育|反応|導入|胞

診 |精査 |を?施行 |培養 |細胞 |成分 |取

り?扱|ガイ[ダド]|分類基準|[^予防]*

予?防 |[^療]*療法 |=[0-9] (history, in-
spection, prevention, ... etc.) 

40



 <family> tags are added by using the fol-
lowing family-words: 

 祖父母 |兄弟?|姉妹?|[叔祖][父母]|[父

母 ]親 ?|息子 |娘 |弟 |妹  (SOHUBO 
(grandparent), KYOUDAI (brother), 

SHIMAI (sister), CHICHIOYA (father), 

HAHAOYA (mother), MUSUKO (son), 

MUSUME (daughter), OTOUTO 

(younger brother), IMOUTO (younger 

sister)) 

 Exception: some of following words are not 
tagged. 

 親指|母指|娘細胞 (OYAYUBI (thumb), 
BOSI (thumb), MUSUMESAIBOU 

(daughter cell)) 

 If a <c> tag is preceded by a <family> tag in 
the same sentence, then "family" modality is 

added to the <c> tag. 

 <family>祖母 </family> ... <c> aaaaa 

</c> ... <c>bbbbb</c> → <c modali-
ty=family> aaaaaa </c> ... <c modali-

ty=family> bbbbb </c> 

 <negation> tags added to negation words 

like "ない (NAI (not))" or "ぬ (NU (not)", 
using Japanese morphological analysis. 

 Also negation expressions like "否定的|否

定 さ れ |(-) (HITEITEKI (negative), 
HITEISARE (denied))" are tagged with 

<negation> tag. 

 <suspicion>, <recognition> and <improve-
ment> tags are also tagged by pattern 

matching. 

 suspicion: 疑[いうっ] | 疑わ[しせれ] | 

うたが[いうっ] | うたがわ[しせれ] | 

可能性 | 危険性 | 否定でき<negation> 

| 考慮され | 考え | 思われ (UTAGAU 
(to suspect), KANOUSEI (possibility), 

KIKENSEI (dangerous), 

KOURYOSARE (considering), 

KANGAE (think), OMOWARE (ap-

pear)) 

 recognition: 認め | 診断 | 出現 | 訴え | 

み と め  (MITOME (recognize), 
SHINDAN (diagnosis), SHUTSUGEN 

(appearance), UTTAE (complain), 

MITOME (recognize)) 

 improvement: 改善 | 消失 | 解消 | 離脱 | 

軽 快  (KAIZEN (improve), 
SHOUSHITU (disappear), KAISHOU 

(reverse), RIDATSU (separation), 

KEIKAI (resolve)) 

 If an <improvement tag or a <suspicion> tag 
is directly followed by a <negation> tag, 

then both tags are cancelled. 

 <improvement>改善</improvement>せ

<negation>ず</negation> → 改善せず  

 <suspicion> 疑 わ れ

</suspicion><negation>ず </negation> 

→ 疑われず 
 If a <recognition> tag is directly followed 

by a <negation> tag, then the recognition 

tag is cancelled and the negation tag is ex-

tended to the beginning of the recognition 

tag. 

 <recognition>認め </recognition> <ne-

gation>ず</negation> → <negation>認

めず</negation> 
 If a <c> tag is followed by a <negation> tag 

or <improvement> tag in the same sequence, 

and if the in-between part (M) does not con-

tain any recognition/suspicion tags, then 

 if no other <c> tag exists in the in-
between part M, "negation" modality is 

added to the <c> tag. 

 if other <c> tags exist in M, and if the in-
between parts of <c> tags are com-

posed of the following connecting ex-

pressions, then the negation modality is 

added to the <c> tag. 

 あるいは | または | および | 及

び? | 乃至は? | ないしは? |      そ

の他の? | など  | や  | と  | 等  
(ARUIWA (or), MATAWA (or), 

OYOBI (or), NAISHIWA (or), 

SONOHOKANO (other), NADO 

(and others), YA (or), TO (and), 

NADO (and others)) 

 If a <c> tag is followed by a <suspicion> 
tag, then "suspicion" modality is added un-

der a similar condition as above. 

 

4 Result 

4.1 De-identification task 

The results of the de-identification task are as 

follows.  

 

 P R F A 

Rule 89.59 91.67 90.62 99.58 

ML1 92.42 84.72 88.41 99.49 

ML2 91.50 84.72 87.98 99.46 

 

41



The Rule column shows the results of the rule-

based method, and the ML1 and ML2 columns 

show the results of the machine learning methods. 

The ML1 is the result with Brown clustering us-

ing training and test data of the MedNLP Task. 

In addition to this, the ML2 is the result using 

Japanese Wikipedia for Brown clustering. 

4.2 Complaint and diagnosis task 

The results of complaint and diagnosis task are 

as follows. 

 

 P R F A 

Rule 72.47 58.12 64.50 93.40 

ML1 88.98 74.24 80.94 96.08 

ML2 88.55 75.32 81.40 96.06 

 

5 Conclusion  

For the de-identification task, the rule-based 

method achieved slightly higher results, while 

for the complaint and diagnosis task, the machine 

learning based method had much higher recalls 

and overall scores. These results suggest that we 

should use these methods selectively depending 

on the nature of the information to be extracted, 

that is to say, whether it can be easily patternized 

or not.
