Abstract

The Semantic Verbal Fluency (SVF) task
is a classical neuropsychological assessment
where persons are asked to produce words
belonging to a semantic category (e.g., an-
imals) in a given time. This paper intro-
duces a novel method of temporal analysis
for SVF tasks utilizing time intervals and
applies it to a corpus of elderly Swedish
subjects (mild cognitive impairment, sub-
jective cognitive impairment and healthy
controls). A general decline in word count
and lexical frequency over the course of the
task is revealed, as well as an increase in
word transition times. Persons with sub-
jective cognitive impairment had a higher
word count during the last intervals, but
produced words of the same lexical fre-
quencies. Persons with MCI had a steeper
decline in both word count and lexical fre-
quencies during the third interval. Addi-
tional correlations with neuropsychological
scores suggest these findings are linked to
a person’s overall vocabulary size and pro-
cessing speed, respectively. Classification
results improved when adding the novel
features (AUC = 0.72), supporting their
diagnostic value.

1 Introduction

Verbal fluency is a widely adapted neu-
ropsychological test. Historically, Schiller
(1947) used the ”spontaneous naming by free
association”-test for the assessment of brain
injuries, becoming one of the first recorded
instances of what would later be referred to
as ”category fluency”. Category fluency, or
semantic verbal fluency (SVF), requires the
verbal production of as many different items
from a given category, e.g., animals, as possi-
ble within a given timeframe. A large body
of evidence substantiates the discriminative

power of semantic verbal fluency for demen-
tia due to Alzheimers Disease (AD) and its
precursor Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)
(Henry et al., 2004; Auriacombe et al., 2006;
Gomez and White, 2006; Raoux et al., 2008;
Linz et al., 2017).

As there is currently no cure for AD, preven-
tive medication labeled to delay the onset or
worsening of symptoms is the primary course
of action, with an emphasis on early interven-
tion being a beneficial factor for effective treat-
ment. Early identification of subtle symptoms
is also valuable for drug trial screening pro-
grams and supports early behavioral interven-
tions that can delay the onset of the disease
(Ashford et al., 2007; Zucchella et al., 2018).

SVF has been used to identify the early
stages of dementia through traditional crude
measures, such as the total number of unique
words produced. This may overlook persons
with very subtle cognitive impairment because
they lack statistically significant differences
from healthy controls. Thus, additional sensi-
tive measures of performance are needed. Fur-
ther analysis of SVF has often looked at the
production as a series of clusters and switches,
where a cluster is a group of semantically sim-
ilar words (e.g. pets such as ’cat’, ’dog’ and
’hamster’) and a switch is the task of chang-
ing semantic focus from one group of animals
to another (e.g. switching from enumerating
pets to producing animals that live in Africa)
(Troyer et al., 1997). Authors have also sug-
gested approaches to clustering and switch-
ing that solely rely on temporal information
(Troeger et al., 2019).

SVF has been shown to be a valid mea-
sure of executive function and verbal ability,
specifically vocabulary size and lexical access
speed (Shao et al., 2014). It has been sug-



104

gested that word production in SVF is moder-
ated by different cognitive processes over time,
where the initial process is a semi-automatic
retrieval of commonly used and readily avail-
able words, whereas later stages demand more
effortful processing (Demetriou and Holtzer,
2017).

In this paper, we examine SVF results of
three groups of Swedish participants; those
with Subjective Cognitive Impairment (SCI),
with MCI and healthy controls (HC). By
analysing the data temporally, we are able to
reveal differences that are not evident when
looking at the SVF as a whole. This paper is
structured in the following way: An overview
of related work is given, with a focus on per-
formance on the SVF by persons with MCI
and SCI. Then the dataset and methodology
are described as well as the features that were
extracted. Finally, the results of our analy-
ses and machine learning experiments are pre-
sented and discussed in tandem with other rel-
evant neuropsychological metrics.

2 Related work

Performance of SVF tasks in healthy older
adults tends to decline with age, and is par-
tially attributed to a decrease in processing
speed, rather than a diminished verbal knowl-
edge (Elgamal et al., 2011). In line with
this reasoning, Tallberg et al. (2008) found
that the performance of Swedish speakers on
SVF is negatively correlated with age and
positively correlated with years of education.
Healthy participants in the age range 65-89
with ≤12 years of education produced a mean
of 14.9±6.4 animals, whereas those in the same
age range but with an education of >12 years
produced 19.4±5.6 animals in the same task.

The deterioration of cognition in MCI, with
impairment both in processing speed and
switching attention (Ashendorf et al., 2008),
results in persons with amnestic MCI (aMCI)
producing smaller clusters and fewer switches
than healthy controls (Peter et al., 2016). This
reduction across strategy generalises to per-
sons with aMCI producing significantly less
categorical words (Price et al., 2012; Mueller
et al., 2015).

Nikolai et al. (2018) found categorical dif-
ferences between naming animals and vegeta-

bles when comparing participants with SCI
and HC on the SVF test. While the animal
category revealed no differences, persons with
SCI generated significantly fewer vegetables,
specifically in the later 30 seconds. Partici-
pants with SCI produced smaller clusters and
made more switches in the animal category.
The groups did not differ significantly on any
demographic variables (age, education, gen-
der) or on the Mini-Mental State Examination
(MMSE; Folstein et al. (1975)).

Throughout the SVF, word production rate
decreases regardless of the presence of cogni-
tive impairment. To further explore the per-
formance of persons with MCI and healthy
controls, Demetriou and Holtzer (2017) di-
vided and analyzed the task into three 20-
second sections with two substantial findings;
both groups declined over time and generated
more words in the first time span. However,
persons with MCI performing within normal
limits produced fewer words in the first time
interval. Slow initiation of lexical search pro-
cess suggests that MCI inhibits early semi-
automatic word retrieval processes. This is in
line with previous research showing that the
last 30 seconds of the verbal fluency task does
not differ between participants, whereas the
first 30 seconds contain discriminating infor-
mation (Fernaeus et al., 2008).

When performing an even finer-grained tem-
poral analysis based on ten second intervals,
Fernaeus et al. (2008) found that intervals 1
and 2 were useful in distinguishing persons
with AD and MCI, and interval 3 made it
possible to differentiate between persons with
MCI and SCI, and MCI and AD respectively.

3 Methods

3.1 Recruitment and Data Acquisition

All the participants in the current study on
”Linguistic and extra-linguistic parameters for
early detection of cognitive impairment” were
recruited from the Gothenburg MCI study
(Wallin et al., 2016). All participants were
speakers of Swedish, selected according to de-
tailed inclusion and exclusion criteria (Kokki-
nakis et al., 2017). Data collection took
place in a quiet lab environment where partici-
pants were fitted with a lapel microphone (Au-
dioTechnica ATR3350) and digitally recorded



105

with a Zoom H4n Pro recorder (44.1 kHz sam-
pling rate; 16bit resolution). The following in-
struction was given in Swedish: ”Your task is
to think of words. I want you to tell me all the
different animals you can think of. You have
60 seconds. Do you have any questions? Are
you ready? Go ahead and start.” If the par-
ticipant seemed unsure, they were told ”any
animals are okay: big ones, little ones, etc.”.
At the end of the 60 seconds, a timer would
go off and the test leader would let the partic-
ipant know that 60 seconds had passed. The
resulting audio files were manually transcribed
and manually time aligned in Praat (Boersma
and Weenink, 2018). All animals named were
transcribed on a separate tier.

A future follow-up visit at the memory clinic
in 2019, after a second round of language tests,
will include a renewed GDS (Global Deteriora-
tion Scale) classification and neuropsycholog-
ical tests. The study was approved by local
ethical committee (ref. number: 206-16, 2016
and T021-18, 2018).

3.2 Clinical Assessments

Participants in the Gothenburg MCI study
were classified as having SCI, MCI, or demen-
tia, and the controls were recruited separately
and evaluated to ascertain that they were cog-
nitively healthy. The classification is based on
the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS), where
level 1 codes for cognitively healthy, level 2
SCI, level 3 MCI and level 4 and above demen-
tia (Auer and Reisberg, 1997; Wallin et al.,
2016). Participants were further evaluated
with neuropsychological tests, magnetic res-
onance imaging (MRI), blood samples, and
spinal fluid samples (Wallin et al., 2016).

Compared to the other study participants,
the persons with SCI were relatively young,
had higher levels of education, higher preva-
lence of stress conditions and depressive symp-
toms as well as a family history of dementia
(Eckerström et al., 2016).

3.3 Features

3.3.1 Traditional measures

From the manual transcripts, traditional SVF
performance metrics were automatically ex-
tracted. The word count was determined
as the number of unique, correctly named

animals. Clusters and switches were deter-
mined based on a temporal metric proposed
by Troeger et al. (2019). In this approach, the
cluster structure is solely determined by the
temporal position of words in the recording.
Consecutive words are clustered if the transi-
tion time between them is shorter than then
average transition time over the sample. This
threshold is furthermore scaled over the pro-
cess of the task to account for the decline in
production speed. The mean number of clus-
ters and the number of switches between them
is extracted.

3.3.2 Temporally resolved measures

To explore different cognitive processes en-
gaged over the course of the one minute task,
SVF performance is examined in 10 second
steps. Words in the transcript were assigned
to a temporal interval based on their onset.
Word count is determined for each interval,
disregarding repetitions from earlier intervals.
Lexical frequency of words were determined
using the KORP collection of Swedish corpora
(Borin et al., 2012). Transition times between
consecutive words were defined as the differ-
ence between the end of the current word and
the onset of the next. Word frequency and
transition times are reported as the average
over each interval.

3.4 Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using R
(software version 3.4.0). For group compar-
isons of traditional measures, linear models
with the measure as a function of diagnostic
group were examined. Temporally resolved
measures were examined with separate linear
mixed effects analysis, one for each response
variable –word count, lexical frequency and
transition time– using the lme4 (Bates et al.,
2014) package. Each time interval is modelled
as a single data point and with age and edu-
cation level, as well as the interaction between
the time interval (T ) and diagnosis, as fixed ef-
fects. The participant identifier was modelled
as a random intercept. Spearman correlations
between the interval word count and neuropsy-
chological scores were examined. Age and ed-
ucation were chosen as demographic variables.
As neuropsychological correlates, the follow-
ing scores were used: the Trail Making Test



106

Part A (TMT-A), as an indicator for process-
ing speed; the Boston Naming Test (BNT; Ka-
plan et al. (1983)), which assess language abil-
ity with a spectrum of high to low frequency
words as a proxy of vocabulary size; and the
Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Similarities
(WAIS-Similarities), which measures abstract
thinking, concept formation and verbal rea-
soning (Wechsler, 1999).

3.5 Machine Learning

The predictive power of the proposed tempo-
ral and semantic features were validated with
machine learning experiments for the HC and
MCI populations. For each transcribed speech
sample, the features described in Section 3.3.1
and 3.3.2 were extracted and label in accor-
dance to their diagnostic category. Logistic
Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machine
(SVM) models, as implemented by the scikit-
learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011) framework, were
trained as binary classifiers to separate the
groups. First, models were trained with only
word count, to establish a baseline, and then,
on the complete feature set, utilizing univari-
ate feature selection.

Area under the Receiver-Operator curve
(AUC) is reported as the evaluation param-
eter. Due to the small size of the dataset,
we used leave-pair-out cross validation (LPO-
CV), which has been shown to produce an
unbiased estimate for AUC on small datasets
(Airola et al., 2009). We also computed the
standard deviation in AUC as described by
Roark et al. (2011).

Feature scaling and hyper-parameter opti-
misation were done on the training set in each
fold. Features were scaled using min-max scal-
ing between 0 and 1. For both SVMs and LR,
C was optimised between C ∈ [10−4, ..., 104]
using a grid search. LR models were trained
with both L1 and L2 loss; for SVM a linear
and an rbf kernel were used.

For the extended feature set, feature selec-
tion based on χ2-tests was applied to the train-
ing set in each fold. The number of selected
features was scaled between 1 and the maxi-
mum of 30.

4 Results

4.1 Demographic information

Demographic information by diagnostic group
is reported in Table 1. The SCI group is
slightly younger and has a higher education
level than the other two groups. The MMSE,
a general index of cognitive status with a max-
imum score of 30, is lower in the MCI group.
With an average MMSE of 28.5, this MCI
population is still quite functional in compar-
ison to other MCI populations (mean MMSE
score can vary between 23 and 29 in the MCI
group) (Lonie et al., 2009). Note that cut-
off points for MMSE may vary slightly: for
Swedish, a cut-off value between 25 and 27
indicates possible cognitive impairment which
should be further evaluated (Palmqvist et al.,
2013) while other studies consider an ”abnor-
mal” MMSE score to be lower or equal to 25
(Zadikoff et al., 2008).

4.2 Traditional measures

A linear model of word count as a function
of diagnosis revealed a significant main effect
(F (2, 72) = 8.57, p < 0.01). Compared to the
control group (WC = 24.06 ± 6.37), the SCI
group (WC = 27.84± 5.6) had a significantly
increased word count (3.78± 1.8, p < 0.5); the
MCI group (WC = 20.12±6.08) a significantly
lowered one (−3.94 ± 1.6, p < 0.5). No signif-
icant effects for the size of temporal clusters
(F (2, 72) = 2.59, p = 0.08) or the number of
temporal switches (F (2, 72) = 1.64, p = 0.2)
as a function of diagnosis are found.

4.3 Temporally resolved measures

Word count, lexical word frequency and tran-
sition times by 10 second intervals is visualized
in Figure 1 and the results of linear mixed ran-
dom effects models are presented in Table 2.

(c) Transition Length

Table 2: Linear Mixed Random Effects model examining the effects of time interval, diagnosis, age and
education on one of three variables, while controlling random effects per subject. Significant values
(p < .05) are indicated in bold.

A general decline in the word count for each
time interval is visible and reflected in the
model, regardless of diagnostic group. A sig-
nificant effect for age is present, implicating
that higher age leads to a reduced word count.
For the SCI group, there is a significant inter-
action between the diagnostic group and the
decline in WCT2,WCT5 and WCT6. In these
intervals, the decline of the SCI group is less
severe. The MCI diagnostic group shows a sig-
nificant interaction with the decline in WCT3,
with a stronger decline in word count than the
other groups.

For lexical word frequency, again, a signif-
icant decline over time is visible, regardless
of diagnostic group, which means that par-
ticipants produce more common words at the
start of the task, and less common words to-
wards the end. Older participants produce
words that are significantly more frequent.
The MCI group has a significant interaction
with WFT3 , indicating this group uses lower

frequency words in this time interval.
Starting from the third interval, a significant

increase in word transition times is visible. A
significant interaction between the SCI group
and the fifth and sixth interval, indicates the
SCI group shows significantly lower transition
times in these intervals.

4.4 Correlation analysis

Spearman correlations between the word
count by time interval, neuropsychological
scores and demographic information is dis-
played in Figure 2. Only significant correla-
tions are displayed.

Significant positive correlations between the
BNT score and the word count in the last three
time intervals are observed. The WAIS Sim-
ilarity score shows positive correlations with
the word count of the last two intervals. Neg-
ative correlations are observed between TMT
A and the second and third interval, as well as
between age and these two intervals (for the
TMT A a lower score indicates a better per-

4.5 Machine Learning

Figure 3 displays the results of the machine
learning experiments. AUC is plotted, while
varying the number of features chosen in fea-
ture selection, using different classifiers.

The baseline performances of models using
just the word count is AUC = 0.64 for LR,
both with L1 and L2 loss, and the linear SVM.
The SVM with an rbf kernel only achieves
AUC = 0.62 with the word count feature.
Generally, the models using all features out-
perform the baseline. The best performance
of AUC = 0.72 is observed for a linear SVM
with 20 features. Generally, the linear and
rbf SVM and the LR with L1 loss show sim-
ilar performance patterns, across all number
of features. The LR with L2 shows steadily
increasing performance. The SVM with rbf
kernel outperforms the other models with a
lower number of features.

5 Discussion

Reviewing the overall performance on the
SVF, a significant difference in word count was
found between the groups, but no differences
in cluster size or number of temporal clusters.
The temporally resolved measures showed that
the MCI, SCI and HC group follow similar
trends with regard to word count, word fre-
quency and transition length: word count and
word frequency generally decrease over time,
while average transition times increase. Signif-
icant differences between the MCI group and
the other two groups were found mainly for
the third interval, where the participants in
the MCI group produce fewer and less frequent
words. For the word count, this is in line with
previous findings from Fernaeus et al. (2008),
and the lower word frequency in the third in-
terval indicates that persons with MCI have
to resort to low frequency words earlier in the
task, switching from semi-automatic retrieval
of more common words to effortful retrieval at
an earlier point than the other groups.

The persons with SCI showed an increased

word count in the second, fifth and sixth inter-
val, and reduced transition times in the fifth
and the sixth interval. This suggests that they
were able to sustain a continuous production
for longer. The words they produced in the
last intervals did not differ in frequency from
the other groups, but the persons with SCI
seemed to have access a larger store of words.
Participants in the SCI group had a longer ed-
ucation than the general population, and one
possibility is that the participants with SCI
in the Gothenburg MCI study perform better
because of higher premorbid functioning (Eck-
erström et al., 2016).

Correlation analysis with additional psycho-
metric data lends a deeper understanding of
the results, and significant correlations showed
that higher BNT and WAIS similarities scores
were associated with a higher word count in
the latter part of the SVF. This suggests that
having a broader vocabulary, as measured by
the BNT, predicts a higher word count in the
second half of the SVF. When reviewing the
word count graph in Figure 1 and compar-
ing the groups, it is evident that the abil-
ity of participants with SCI to sustain perfor-
mance in the later time intervals can be ex-
plained by the access to a larger vocabulary as
measured by the BNT. Age and TMT-A both

show significant negative correlation with the
second and third time intervals of the SVF.
TMT-A is a measure of processing speed, and
it decreases with increasing age. A decrease
in processing speed seems to specifically in-
hibit production in the second and third inter-
val. Demetriou and Holtzer (2017) suggested
a semi-automatic retrieval phase at the begin-
ning and a more effortful retrieval at the end
of the task. Our findings support the notion of
these phases occurring over the course of task,
where the first phase is more influenced by
processing speed and the later benefits more
strongly from a larger vocabulary.

The benefits of temporal analysis were ap-
parent in the increase of the ability to correctly
classify participants as HC or MCI, compared
to a classification based solely on word count.
In the best case, the performance of the SVM
with rbf kernel improved from AUC = 0.62
to AUC = 0.72 with temporal analysis. While
this study was based on manually transcribed
data, previous research shows that this type
of analysis can be done fully automatically in-
cluding ASR, which allows for easy scaling of
the task (König et al., 2018).

6 Conclusion

This paper introduced a novel, interval-based
temporal analysis method for SVF tasks. The
resulting outcome revealed distinct patterns
that differentiated the groups: persons with
SCI had a higher word count and sustained
lexical frequency level during the last intervals,
while persons with MCI had a steeper decline
in both word count and lexical frequencies dur-
ing the third interval. Correlations with neu-
ropsychological scores suggested that the su-
perior performance of the SCI group could be
attributed to vocabulary size. Classification
results improved when adding the novel fea-
tures (AUC = 0.72), supporting their diagnos-
tic value. This increase over the baseline per-
formance underlines the value of using novel
methods in addition to clinical standards.

The results of group comparisons and corre-
lations are in line with previous findings about
phases of production in SVF. The special role
of the third time interval in discriminating
MCI patients is also supported by previous re-
search. Future research should strive to val-
idate these findings on larger data sets, for
other languages and other semantic categories.

Based on our findings, we suggest that tem-
poral analysis of the SVF may be useful as
a screening tool, when assessing persons with
self-perceived memory problem, as this type
of analysis seems to highlight the subtle dif-
ferences between the groups. We see it as a
strength that instead of adding new tasks, we
are using an already clinically validated tool
in an innovative and new manner.
