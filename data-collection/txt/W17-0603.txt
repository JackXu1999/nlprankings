Abstract

For most of the Uralic languages, there is a lack of systematically collected,
consequently transcribed and morphologically annotated text corpora. This pa-
per sums up the steps, the preliminary results and the future directions of build-
ing a linguistic corpus of some Uralic languages, namely Tundra Nenets, Udmurt,
Synya Khanty, and Surgut Khanty. The experiences of building a corpus con-
taining both old and modern, and written and oral data samples are discussed.
Principles concerning data collection strategies of languages with different level
of vitality and endangerment are discussed. Methodologies and challenges of data
processing, and the levels of linguistic annotation are also described in detail.

1 Introduction
This paper sums up the steps, the preliminary results and the future directions of
building a linguistic corpus of some Uralic languages within the research project
called Languages under the Influence. The project started in February 2016 and lasts
until July 2017 and is funded by the Hungarian National Research, Development and
Innovation Office (grant ID: ERC_HU_15 118079).

It is a pre-ERC project getting national support to enter the European Research
Council (ERC) programme¹, thus it is a pilot project. Its aim is to create the theoretical

and methodological basis of an ERC project proposal, which is called as ‘the main
project’ in the article.

The main project has a twofold objective. As for the theoretical investigations,
it focuses on potential syntactic changes affected by the heavy influence of the Rus-
sian language in several Uralic languages spoken in the Russian Federation (mainly in
Siberia). Our research covers, among others, the change of basic word order (i.e. the
SOV-to-SVO order), the spreading of finite subordination and clause-initial comple-
mentizers, and the diversification of indefinite pronouns. The languages involved are
Tundra Nenets, Udmurt, Synya Khanty, and Surgut Khanty.

On the other hand, the main project’s computational objective is to build a linguis-
tically annotated database of written and spoken sources in the aforementioned lan-
guages, which makes it possible to research on Uralic–Russian language contacts. In
order to observe syntactic changes of minority languages under the influence, we aim
at processing texts collected from different times. It is known, however, that the lit-
eracy of Uralic languages do not have a long history and tradition. The oldest sources
included in our project originate from the beginning of the 20th century (when or-
ganized expeditions were undertaken in order to document and describe Uralic lan-
guages). In addition, we gather data from published and/or electronically accessible
sources, which are presented by fieldworks undertaken recently. We focus on select-
ing texts provided by as many authors as possible from different social classes, age,
sex, dialects and genres. Furthermore, our activities will include fieldwork, during
which we will collect contemporary spoken language material, thus the database will
represent the written and the spoken versions of the languages as well.

Within the pilot project, text samples from the two time periods for all the afore-
mentioned languages have been collected and partly processed and annotated. In this
paper, we discuss considerations taken into account and methods used in the pilot
corpus building process, which indeed will be applied in the main project as well. The
structure of the remaining part of the article is as follows: In Section 2, we discuss the
main principal criteria behind corpus building. Section 3 describes the collected text
material and the problems we face with when aiming at creating such a corpus. The
text processing steps are detailed in Section 4, while Section 5 presents the structure
of the corpus. We conclude in Section 6, which contains the future directions as well.

2 Theoretical considerations
We follow several principal criteria within the pilot project which form the basis
even of the whole corpus building process of the main project. Since the Uralic lan-
guages dealt with are endangered and/or poorly documented, we think that creating

11



a database which follows the basic concepts of language documentation is of huge
importance, as detailed in 2.1. Other principal criteria are: following international
standards on every level of corpus building (2.2), consistency which would apply on
all levels (2.3), and using and creating freely available resources (2.4).

2.1 Language documentation

One of the principal criteria of the pilot project is following some basic principles
of language documentation (cf. [1, 2]). First, we focus on compiling primary data in
Himmelmann’s sense [3], i.e. we collected data types that were produced at a specific
point in time and space by a specific speaker instead of collecting and using general-
ized secondary data, e.g. elicited data (that may be corrupted). This rule is also applied
to our fieldwork(s), during which we prefer to document the languages in their natu-
ral forms, i.e. to record language variants that are not influenced by the style of genres
(as in the case of folklore texts), or by some prescriptive considerations (as in the case
of journalism). The application of this principle led us to the second concept, i.e. col-
lecting and storing the context of the data (metadata), which generally concerns the
recording time and place, the age, gender and spoken dialects of the informants. The
collection of metadata is also needed for other scientific fields, e.g. for sociolinguistics,
anthropology, and sociology [4]. Third, we aim at building a database whose content
is transferable both in linguistic and in technical terms. Consequently, both the rep-
resentation, i.e. the transcription, and the analysis, i.e. the morphological tags, of our
data is not restricted to any theory or method. Finally, we make our data available
for further theoretical and applied research, as well as for direct use by the relevant
language communities.

However, certain rules and conditions of language documentation are necessarily
contravened in our project. For instance, as languages are still most typically used in
speech, collecting spoken data has primacy in language documentation. This princi-
ple, however, has its limits in the case of the historical data, such as the availability of
the original sound recordings. Therefore, we decided to collect old texts that appeared
in critical editions instead of inscriptions or original manuscripts. Although these edi-
tions usually contain smaller range of text genre, they still provide rich metadata and
useful information about the rules followed during the transcription of spoken data. In
the case of contemporary written language samples, we aim for selecting texts which
are provided by as many authors as possible from different social classes, age, gender,
dialects and genres. As our project has its time limit, we need to break the rule of
collecting full range of textual genres and registers and primarily focus on those ones
which may typically show the results of a potential language contact. These written
genres are usually the types which are closer to the spoken language, such as blogs

12



and tweets, see more details in Section 3. Finally, the written language varieties of
the languages concerned are typically produced by only a few writers, therefore, the
sociolinguistical parameters may not be balanced in our corpus.

2.2 International standards

Another criterium is following international standards on every level of the corpus
building process. Therefore, we only use standard Unicode characters, we provide
phonemic transcription using the letters of the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA),
we follow the Leipzig Glossing Rules (LGR)² and abbreviations, and we use standard
file formats, as detailed below.

The Unicode Standard³ is a multilingual coding system which provides a consis-
tent encoding for most of the world’s writing systems. Recently, it became an inter-
national standard, which supports the worldwide interchange, processing and display
of written texts of diverse languages. One of the great advantages of Unicode is that
it properly handles various accented and multi-accented characters, since basic char-
acters and combining diacritical marks are represented by their own codes. Unicode
also contains all of the Cyrillic characters used in the orthographies of the aforemen-
tioned languages. Moreover, the Unicode Consortium provides new supplements in
each release for users to be able to handle and represent the proper characters used by
minority communities. For example, the charactersԮ (U+052E Cyrillic capital let-
ter el with descender) and ԯ (U+052F Cyrillic small letter el with descender)
were released in version 7.0 in 2014 based on the character request proposal submit-
ted to the Unicode Technical Committee by Tapani Salminen⁴. Salminen provides
evidence from recent native publications that these characters are needed, since a
descender is used in common typographic practice of the Northern Khanty, Eastern
Khanty, Tundra Nenets and Forest Nenets languages. Before version 7.0, replacement
characters were used instead of them, mostly Ԓ (U+0512 Cyrillic capital letter el
with hook) and ԓ (U+0513 Cyrillic small letter el with hook) or Ӆ (U+04C5
Cyrillic capital letter el with tail) and ӆ (U+04C6 Cyrillic small letter el
with tail), but since then the proper characters be can used.

The Unicode code charts also contain all of the widely used IPA characters, thus
every textual element (Uralic transcriptions, IPA transliteration, Cyrillic characters)
can be stored with standard Unicode characters, which makes it possible to replace
the old, makeshift font collections and to follow the international standards.

Language documenters of the languages concerned in this project used different
subtypes of the traditional Finno-Ugric transcription (FUT) system (see details in Sec-
tion 4.2). However, these Latin-based transcription systems are not standardized nor
unified, even within one language. For this reason, it is important to publish the texts
using the IPA system, as it makes the texts readable for further areas of linguistics
outside Uralistics.

On the morphological annotation level, we follow the Leipzig Glossing Rules with
some modifications. The tokens and the corresponding pieces of morphological in-
formation are aligned, i.e. the following annotations are added to each token of the
corpus: lemma, part-of-speech (POS) tag, morphological labels of derivational and in-
flectional categories, and English translation of the lemma. The glosses are converted
from the output of a morphological analyzer developed for the language concerned.
As a consequence, if the output is not segmented on the level of morphemes, even
the glosses will not contain morpheme-by-morpheme correspondence. In the case
if the morphological analyzer is able to produce morpheme-level segmentation, seg-
mentable morphemes will be separated by hyphens according to the second rule of
the LGR.

The LGR also contains a proposed list of category labels which were applied for
our corpus. Since this list does not cover all morphological phenomena existing in the
examined Uralic languages, two further tagsets were used to supplement the original
list of the LGR. One of them is theWikipedia page of the list of glossing abbreviations⁵
which provides a more detailed list of grammatical terms and their abbreviations for
interlinear glossing. The other source was the collection of abbreviation lists provided
by the reference grammars of the languages in question. When choosing our tags, we
preferred the standard category terms and labels over the particular ones.

We follow international standards even in the file formats. All text files are UTF-
8 encoded plain text files. The token-level annotations are represented in separate
columns of tsv files, which can be easily converted into XML files or can be directly
imported into ELAN as tiers. For transcribing and archiving audio and video data, we
use ELAN which is one of the most widely used multimedia annotation tool⁶. ELAN
allows audio and video recordings to be time-aligned with multilayered annotations,
called tiers. The linguistic annotations and the metadata are stored in a hierarchical
structure, which can be exported as standard XML files, which can be used as an input
of further text processing steps.

2.3 Consistency

Consistency is the third principal criterium which would apply on all levels: a uni-
fied character table has been created to be able to ask one query to the whole corpus;
and similarly, the same morphological label is used for the same morphological phe-
nomenon.

Research in language documentation aims at creating long lasting, multipurpose
and multifaceted databases in which language technology can definitely help to cre-
ate systematically annotated corpora, rather than eclectic data collections. The main
difference between the former and the latter one is consistency.

Consistency is a basic requirement so that one can ask a query on the whole cor-
pus. One of the great advantages of corpora is that they provide not only separate
examples but all instances of the searched term, so analyses based on frequency be-
come available. This important property of corpora can be ensured only if one fol-
lows the principle of consistency, and always uses the same appropriate character for
representing the same letter and different characters for representing different let-
ters. Therefore, we created a unified character table which contains all possibly used
characters in all writing, transliteration and transcription systems of all languages
concerned.

As for the level of morphology, the glosses are converted from the output of sev-
eral morphological analyzers, thus a mapping of the different tags into the set of
the unified labels has to be conducted. As a consequence, one morphological phe-
nomenon is always signed with one and the same label.

2.4 Open access

During the whole corpus building process, we aim for following the philosophy of
open access, which has two aspects. First, we prefer to use freely available language
processing tools and to re-use already collected data sets if it is possible. Second, the
results of the project (text and processing resources) will also be freely available.

We plan to make the database available, not only as a downloadable version,
but also via an online search interface, which offers the user several features that
greatly facilitate the linguistic analysis of large amounts of authentic linguistic data.
Moreover, considering the need for long-term preservation in order to assure that
these data will be available for future generations, we want to provide the structured
data for an international language archive which offers archiving service, such as the
Documentation of Endangered Languages (DOBES) corpus hosted by The Language
Archive.

3 Text collection and sampling
As mentioned before, the goal of the text selection is to design a corpus that contains
reliable, natural, and representative data. There are many factors, however, that one
has to consider with respect to the selected Uralic languages when collecting text
material. The two main factors discussed here are (i) the level of endangerment of the
languages and (ii) the difficulties of data sampling.

Both the vitality and the documentational status vary considerably between the
languages of our project. The variation is remarkable especially between the Udmurt
language and the languages spoken in Siberia, i.e. Synya Khanty, Surgut Khanty and
Tundra Nenets.

The EGIDS level⁷ of Udmurt is 5, i.e. it is developing, which means that there is
literature which is available in a standardized form, though it is not yet widespread
or sustainable. In the case of the other three Siberian languages, this value is 6b,
i.e. threatened, which means that the use of the languages is restricted to the domains
of home and family interactions. Native speakers typically belong to the older gen-
eration, while the younger ones are losing their heritage languages. Despite the fact
that the speaking communities of the three languages in Siberia have territorial au-
tonomies, they are not considered as official languages in the Russian Federation. On
the contrary, Udmurt is one of the official languages of Udmurtia. As the languages
spoken in Siberia are considered to be of low prestige, efforts of language planning
and language revitalization have only sporadically be made in the area. Similarly to
several indigenous languages found in Siberia, they are regarded as poorly described
and documented languages.

The difference between the levels of vitality results in the limitation or lack of
availability of certain text types in the case of the languages spoken in Siberia. While
there is a relatively large amount of printed text material collected from speakers who
can be characterized as being “old, fluent speakers” of the community (cf. [5]), there
is no data from the informal text genres such as blogs or tweets produced by the
younger generation. Although several fieldtrips have been undertaken to the tradi-
tional territories recently, the collected texts are usually published only in a printed
form, or if electronically, they are not available for the research community. If there
are electronic corpora or text collections available, they do not provide a representa-
tive sample of the language.

Consequently, in the case of the old texts, we selected those folklore texts that were
collected in the beginning of the 20th century and (mainly) edited by the fieldworkers
themselves. The old Synya Khanty texts come from the collection ofWolfgang Steinitz

⁷https://www.ethnologue.com/about/language-status

16



[6], which was published in 1975 but collected in the 30s. The old Surgut Khanty texts
were collected by Heikki Paasonen [7] in 1900–01 at the Yugan river. As for Ud-
murt, old text material comes from two sources: once, from the collection of Bernát
Munkácsi [8] from 1887, and second, from the collection of Yrjö Wichmann [9] which
was published in 1901. The old Tundra Nenets texts are also folklore texts, collected
by Toivo Lehtisalo [10] in 1911–12. Even though the genre of these text samples is
the same, we tried to keep the ratio of the (sub)dialects, the age and the gender of the
informants as balanced as possible. The full table with metadata is available on the
web site of the project (the URL will only be provided in the camera ready version).

The sources of the new text material are more diverse. In the case of these texts,
we aim to collect and process texts from genres that may potentially represent Russian
contact. For this purpose, blogs, interviews appeared in newspapers or in books, and
narratives of personal stories have been found suitable. The newKhanty data contains
transcribed interviews recently collected during fieldwork. The new Udmurt texts
were sampled from the blogs called Мынам малпанъёсы⁸ and Марайко⁹. The new
Tundra Nenets data contains interviews from the newspaper entitled Нярьяна Нгэрм
(‘Red North’) published in Salekhard. Besides, we acquired and preprocessed several
recently collected folklore text samples from the collection of Labanauskas [11] and
Pushkareva–Khomich [12]. For each type of new text/data, we clarify their access
rights and apply for authorisation.

The new spoken data mainly originate from fieldwork of our project members.
These data will be transcribed and time-aligned in ELAN. We plan to collect contem-
porary data from the same territories from where the old data samples originate, with
which we aim at reducing the effects of the influence factors.

4 Text processing
The first step of the corpus building workflow is the acquisition of source data, which
typically contains the steps of scanning and OCRing or downloading from the web,
see Section 4.1. The language documenters used Latin-based transcription systems,
while the languages concerned use Cyrillic writing systems, and we aim at creating
the IPA transliteration for the text samples in all languages, therefore we have to deal
with several transcriptions and transliterations, see for details in Section 4.2. The
morphological analysis and disambiguation is discussed in Section 4.3.

4.1 Acquisition of the original text material

A significant part of the linguistic material was only available in print. In this case,
digitization was carried out by scanning followed by a conversion process from the
scanned images into regular text files aided by an OCR software.

Since we work with several writing, transcription and transliteration systems, a
key aspect of an OCR software was its ability to be trained. For this purpose, we used
the Abbyy FineReader Professional edition¹⁰, which can be trained in an interactive
way and produces a fairly good quality result.

Some new text samples were acquired by downloading them from the web. In
these cases, the plain text had to be extracted from HTML sources or PDF files. Because
of the diverse sources, a kind of character-level normalization is needed. For this
purpose, a Perl script is used which lists all of the Unicode characters used in the
document. Based on this, foreign language parts and not properly used characters
can be removed or changed, such as in the case of the Cyrillic letter el with descender,
see Section 2.2.

4.2 Transcription and transliteration

The database contains each text material at least in its original transcription used
by the language documenter and in IPA transliteration. Moreover, since the writing
system of the languages concerned is based on the Cyrillic alphabet, we preserve the
original Cyrillic script, if it is available. If not, we create it in a conversion step, if it
is needed for the morphological analysis. Since some morphological analyzers only
accepts the input in a given FUT transcription, texts in some languages had to be
converted into that transcription as well.

The Finno-Ugric transcription (FUT) system or the Uralic Phonetic Alphabet is a
phonetic transcription system first published by Eemil Nestor Setälä [13] and only
used in the field of Uralistics. It is called one system, however, it is actually a com-
mon name for several transcription systems developed and used by researchers and
language documenters in the Uralic studies from the end of the 19th century until
recently.

The systems of Wolfgang Steinitz, Márta Csepregi [14], Bernát Munkácsi, Yrjö
Wichmann, Toivo Lehtisalo and Péter Hajdú [15] differ from each other very much.
Each of them follow his/her own inner logic, which is sometimes hard to be de-
tected, additionally they are not consequent in the sense that they frequently apply
different characters for the same sound and vice versa. For example, in the case of

¹⁰http://finereader.abbyy.com/

18



Surgut Khanty, the close central rounded vowel represented with the IPA symbol /ʉ/
is marked with /ü/ by Steinitz and with /ŭ̇/ by Márta Csepregi.

There are altogether 11 conversion directions for the four languages, as detailed
below. The old Synya Khanty texts are originally transcribed by Steinitz, who used
his own FUT-like system, which has been converted first into IPA, and second into
another FUT-like transcription used by the developers of the morphological analyzer
for Synya Khanty (see later in Section 4.3).

The old Surgut Khanty texts were kindly provided us by Elena Skribnik and Zsófia
Schön, members of the Ob-Ugric Database (OUDB) research project¹¹. The OUDB
text corpus contains the texts only in IPA transliteration, thus the Paasonen texts are
available only in IPA. However, the modern Surgut Khanty texts are written with
Cyrillic characters, which have been converted first into the transcription system of
Márta Csepregi, then from that into IPA.

As for the Udmurt language, we had to create conversion rules for four directions.
Once, we compiled the conversion rules from the transcription of Bernát Munkácsi
and YrjöWichmann into IPA. Since the available morphological analyzers for Udmurt
(see Section 4.3) only accept Cyrillic script, we had to create the transliteration rules
for the direction from IPA to Cyrillic. In the case of modern Udmurt texts, the inverse
direction is used, since we have to create the IPA transliteration of texts written in
Cyrillic as well.

The old Tundra Nenets texts transcribed by Lehtisalo are exceptions in the sense,
that they were OCRed directly in the transcription system of Péter Hajdú, not in that
of Lehtisalo. The reason behind this is that Lehtisalo’s transcription is unduly difficult,
and a part of the characters could not be represented by standard Unicode characters.
Therefore, the starting point of the conversion was the Hajdú transcription which
was converted into IPA and then into Cyrillic, the latter one for being the input of the
morphological analyzer. And last but not least, the modern Cyrillic Tundra Nenets
texts are also converted into IPA.

First, manually compiled transcription rules were created for all directions by lin-
guist experts of the languages concerned. These rules were then transformed into
substitution commands expressed by extended regular expressions which can be fed
to the Unix command sed with the option -f. Thus, it is a typical rule-based system,
one of whose shortcomings is that it is language-dependent, i.e. the system is not
portable to other languages or to other directions without changing. Since the rules
must be ordered, it can be quite difficult to incorporate new rules into the system.
Moreover, it is hard to keep track of all rules and a single error may cause the sys-
tem to malfunction. However, rule-based systems have advantages as well, namely

¹¹http://www.oudb.gwi.uni-muenchen.de/

19



the high precision they achieve. Since all of the converted texts are checked and cor-
rected by linguist experts, we rather vote for higher precision, even at the cost of
difficulty.

During the process of the transcriptions one barrier arose which is resulted from
the lack of the standard spelling of the old andmodern texts. In both cases, we avoided
to standardize the different forms that appeared in the texts even when they appar-
ently represented the same word. We decided to keep these “inconsistent” forms, be-
cause the standardizing process may easily lead to the loss of important information
regarding the phonetic system of the languages.

4.3 Morphological analysis

The corpus will contain rich linguistic annotation even on the morphological level.
For each token, its lemma, its POS tag and its English gloss will be added as anno-
tations. As mentioned in Section 2.2, the morphological annotations will be carried
out by the application of the available morphological analyzers, by the conversion
of glosses from their output, and by the manual correction of the output of the con-
version. Therefore, if the morphological analyzer is capable to create morpheme-by-
morpheme segmentation, the tokens will also be morph-level segmented.

There are existing morphological analyzers for three of the four languages con-
cerned, with which the process of the morphological annotation can be supported,
however the whole annotation process cannot be conducted fully automatically.

The most well-known text processing framework for under-resourced Uralic lan-
guages is Giellatekno¹². It provides a fully established framework for creating lan-
guage processing tools, such as proofing tools, digital dictionaries and morphological
analyzers. The latter one has been developed for Udmurt, Northern Khanty and Tun-
dra Nenets.

Besides, there are morphological tools developed for small Uralic languages, such
as Udmurt and Synya Khanty, by a Hungarian language technology company (Mor-
phoLogic) and the Research Institute for Linguistics of the Hungarian Academy of
Sciences [16]. These analyzers are not open source tools, but they are available via
an online interface¹³. They output an HTML file containing all potential analyses of
each token. To support the process of manual checking and disambiguation, we use a
web-based interface which was originally created for the disambiguation of Old Hun-
garian texts [17]. The proper analysis can be chosen from a pop-up menu containing
a list of possible analyses which appears when the mouse cursor is placed over the

¹²http://giellatekno.uit.no/
¹³http://www.morphologic.hu/urali/

20



word. The analyses provided by the Giellatekno analyzers are also converted so that
to be fed to this web-based interface.

For the Synya Khanty texts, we use the analyzer of MorphoLogic. Its reason is
that the Giellatekno analyzer needs Cyrillic input, while all of our sources are in some
Latin-based transcriptions.

As far as we know, the Surgut Khanty language is the only one of the four lan-
guages we deal with for which there is no morphological analyzer. Based on Zipf’s
law, the large part of the text is covered by themost frequent words, thus if we provide
the gloss for the first n most frequent words from a lookup, the pains of the manual
work can be highly reduced. For this reason, a linguist expert created a table with
the morphological codes and the English translation of the lemma for the 122 most
frequent words of the modern texts, from which the glosses for the 64% of the text
can be automatically generated.

For the morphological analysis of the Udmurt texts, we use the analyzer of Mor-
phoLogic, since it provides morph-level segmentation and Hungarian translation as
well.

In the case of Tundra Nenets, we use the Giellatekno analyzer. However, the
grammar files in Giellatekno describe another dialect and follow another grammar.
For this reason, we plan to create new grammar files for Tundra Nenets within the
framework of Giellatekno, which may be used for morphological analysis of this di-
alect of Tundra Nenets according to the grammar of Nikolaeva [18] in the future.

5 The structure of the corpus
The corpus has three main annotation levels, each of which has an obligatory version
which must be created for each text sample. Two annotation levels are token-level
aligned, while one is sentence-level aligned. The first level is the level of the original
text itself, which can be written either in Cyrillic or in a FUT transcription, but it must
have an IPA transliteration, which is the obligatory version at this level. Token-level
alignment means in this case that several transcriptions and transliterations of each
token can be seen side-by-side in the tsv files. Themorphological annotation for each
token contains the lemma, the POS tag and the English gloss. The third annotation
level is the level of translations, where the obligatory translation is the English one,
however there are several text samples which have German, Hungarian or Russian
translation as well. The different language translations are sentence-level aligned.

The token- and sentence-level aligned text samples will be imported into ELAN,
where spoken data will also be sentence-level time-aligned. ELAN presents the an-
notation levels as horizontal tiers, which is illustrated by the Tundra Nenets example

6 Conclusion and future work
This paper discussed the most important theoretical considerations and the process of
building a linguistically annotated database of certain endangered Uralic languages
within the framework of the research project called Languages under the Influence.
The general theoretical considerations applied in our work cover the main princi-
ples of language documentation, the use of international standards, the principle of
consistency and open access. We addressed problems of collecting text samples in
endangered languages and provided solution to resolve these specific problems.

Our database contain token- and sentence-level aligned data for four languages:
Tundra Nenets, Udmurt, Synya Khanty and Surgut Khanty. Each text sample is avail-
able in at least in IPA transliteration, extended with morphological information and
with English translation. The still under construction thus ever growing database is
freely available via the URL of our web site which will be provided in the camera
ready version of the paper.

Since it is an ongoing project, several future directions emerge during each corpus
building step. We aim for creating a fully annotated database containing at least 4000
tokens text samples from the two time period for all the aforementioned languages
until the end of the pilot project. Long-term future plans highly depend on the result
of the ERC project proposal.

As mentioned, all results of the pilot project will be freely available. Not only the
converted, translated andmorphologically annotated text samples are freely available,
but we will provide all conversion rules and tools as well as the table of the unified

22



morphological tagset with the unified character table. We also plan to develop an
online search interface which offers several features.
