 Abstract 

Translation process research (TPR) aims 

at describing what translators do, and one 

of the technical dimensions of translators’ 

work is editing (applying detailed changes 

to text). In this presentation, we will ana-

lyze how different methods for process 

data collection describe editing. We will 

review keyloggers used in typical TPR ap-

plications, track changes used by word 

processors, and edit rates based on estima-

tion of edit distances. The purpose of this 

presentation is to discuss the limitations of 

these methods when describing editing be-

havior, and to incentivize researchers in 

looking for ways to present process data in 

simplified formats, closer to those that de-

scribe product data. 

1 Research background 

The technical dimension of translation, revision 

and post-editing is characterized by writing ac-

tions. Editing, part of this technical dimension, is 

a set of actions that is applied to pre-existing text. 

This implies that editing cannot be analyzed in the 

same way as translating or writing from scratch. 

We see editing as being composed of four actions: 

delete, insert, move and replace (do Carmo 2017). 

This presentation discusses the implications of 

this definition of editing and of different methods 

to describe it. 

If we want to know which words were edited 

and how, we need data that accurately describes 

the actions performed. After we have that data, we 

may extract from it features that can be used to

train computational models that predict editing 

patterns and behaviors. 

TPR tools, like Translog II (Carl, 2012) and 

Inputlog (Leijten and Van Waes, 2013) use 

keylogging to collect process data, in a character 

and chronological base. However, it has been 

shown that it is not straightforward to convert 

TPR data into word-based sequences of edit 

actions (do Carmo et al., 2018; Leijten et al., 

2012). The main reason for this is the fact that 

process data is not linear: it includes incomplete, 

repeated, wrong actions, scattered edits, and other 

process components that cannot be associated 

with the words that survive in the final edited 

versions. 

Word processors and translation tools often in-

corporate track change features that record edit-

ing, but these too are not straightforwardly con-

verted into editing data. 

Product data seems to describe a simpler 

reality, so simpler methods may be used. Edit 

distances appeared in the 1960’s as methods to 

identify and correct errors of spelling in text 

typing (Damerau, 1964), and errors in computer 

code (Levenshtein, 1966). These edit distances 

evolved into metrics like WER–Word Error Rate 

(Popovic and Ney, 2007) and TER–Translation 

Edit Rate (Snover et al., 2006), both of which have 

several variants. 

Edit rates identify differences between two 

versions of a text, and they have been extensively 

used in applications like automatic post-editing 

(do Carmo et al, 2019) and quality estimation of 

machine translation (Specia et al., 2018). In these 

applications, they are seen as good predictors of 

the editing required by texts or sentences.

2 Experiment 

We conducted a brief experiment to assess the 

capacity of different methods to identify the 

editing actions actually performed by translators. 

We created a test set of a few sentences to which 

we simulated the application of edits in a sequence 

of growing complexity. This experiment allowed 

us to describe the structure of different data 

collection and analysis methods and to show their 

limitations in identifying the actions that were 

performed on one version of a text to transform it 

into another version. Methods like TER are 

analysed and described in detail. 

3 Results and discussion 

One of the conclusions of the experiment 

above is that edit distances should not be used as 

descriptors of processes. Nevertheless, edit 

distances are very useful. Their power lies in their 

intuitiveness and descriptive capacity: everything 

is a change in a unit, in a position, or in both. And 

four actions only (delete, insert, replace and 

move) describe all transformations that can be 

done to a sentence. But the main contribution of 

these metrics is the efficiency requirement – the 

aim is to identify the ‘minimum distance’ from 

one string to the other. This has led to an 

oversimplified view of editing, but it may have a 

positive use. 

For the TPR community, it would be useful to 

have a description of editing work that benefited 

from these simplified descriptions. There would 

be obvious advantages in converting process data 

into formats inspired by editing rates. One of the 

advantages would be that machine translation re-

searchers could more easily integrate the 

knowledge created by the TPR community. Be-

sides, based on simpler data descriptions, more 

complex research can be done, enabling us to test 

further dimensions of editing, like the relation be-

tween edit rates and technical effort, or to study 

different rates of intensity of editing in translation, 

revision and post-editing.
