Abstract

Verb classes which integrate a wide range
of linguistic properties (Levin, 1993) have
proved useful for natural language pro-
cessing (NLP) applications. However,
the real-world use of these classes has
been limited because for most languages,
no resources similar to VerbNet (Kipper-
Schuler, 2005) are available. We apply
a verb clustering approach developed for
English to French – a language for which
no such experiment has been conducted
yet. Our investigation shows that not only
the general methodology but also the best
performing features are transferable be-
tween the languages, making it possible
to learn useful VerbNet style classes for
French automatically without language-
speciﬁc tuning.

Introduction

1
A number of verb classiﬁcations have been built to
support natural language processing (NLP) tasks
(Grishman et al., 1994; Miller, 1995; Baker et al.,
1998; Palmer et al., 2005; Kipper-Schuler, 2005;
Hovy et al., 2006). These include both syntactic
and semantic classiﬁcations, as well as ones which
integrate aspects of both. Classiﬁcations which in-
tegrate a wide range of linguistic properties can
be particularly useful for NLP applications suffer-
ing from data sparseness. One such classiﬁcation
is VerbNet (Kipper-Schuler, 2005). Building on
the taxonomy of Levin (1993), VerbNet groups
verbs (e.g. deliver, post, dispatch) into classes
(e.g. SEND) on the basis of their shared mean-
ing components and syntactic behaviour, identi-
ﬁed in terms of meaning preserving diathesis al-
ternations. Such classes can be identiﬁed across
the entire lexicon, and they may also apply across

languages, since their meaning components are
said to be cross-linguistically applicable (Jack-
endoff, 1990).

Offering a powerful tool for generalization, ab-
straction and prediction, VerbNet classes have
been used to support many important NLP
tasks, including e.g. computational lexicography,
parsing, word sense disambiguation, semantic
role labeling,
information extraction, question-
answering, and machine translation (Swier and
Stevenson, 2004; Dang, 2004; Shi and Mihalcea,
2005; Abend et al., 2008). However, to date their
exploitation has been limited because for most
languages, no Levin style classiﬁcation is avail-
able.

Since manual classiﬁcation is costly (Kipper
et al., 2008) automatic approaches have been pro-
posed recently which could be used to learn novel
classiﬁcations in a cost-effective manner (Joanis
´O S´eaghdha
et al., 2008; Li and Brew, 2008;
and Copestake, 2008; Vlachos et al., 2009; Sun
and Korhonen, 2009). However, most work on
Levin type classiﬁcation has focussed on English.
Large-scale research on other languages such as
German (Schulte im Walde, 2006) and Japanese
(Suzuki and Fukumoto, 2009) has focussed on se-
mantic classiﬁcation. Although the two classiﬁca-
tion systems have shared properties, studies com-
paring the overlap between VerbNet and WordNet
(Miller, 1995) have reported that the mapping is
only partial and many to many due to ﬁne-grained
nature of classes based on synonymy (Shi and Mi-
halcea, 2005; Abend et al., 2008).

Only few studies have been conducted on Levin
style classiﬁcation for languages other than En-
glish. In their experiment involving 59 verbs and
three classes, Merlo et al. (2002) applied a su-
pervised approach developed for English to Ital-
ian, obtaining high accuracy (86.3%).
In an-
other experiment with 60 verbs and three classes,

1057

they showed that features extracted from Chinese
translations of English verbs can improve English
classiﬁcation. These results are promising, but
those from a later experiment by Ferrer (2004)
are not. Ferrer applied a clustering approach de-
veloped for English to Spanish, and evaluated it
against the manual classiﬁcation of V´azquez et al.
(2000), constructed using criteria similar (but not
identical) to Levin’s. This experiment involving
514 verbs and 31 classes produced results only
slightly better than the random baseline.

In this paper, we investigate the cross-linguistic
potential of Levin style classiﬁcation further. In
past years, verb classiﬁcation techniques – in par-
ticular unsupervised ones – have improved con-
siderably, making investigations for a new lan-
guage more feasible. We take a recent verb clus-
tering approach developed for English (Sun and
Korhonen, 2009) and apply it to French – a ma-
jor language for which no such experiment has
been conducted yet. Basic NLP resources (cor-
pora, taggers, parsers and subcategorization ac-
quisition systems) are now sufﬁciently developed
for this language for the application of a state-of-
the-art verb clustering approach to be realistic.

Our investigation reveals similarities between
the English and French classiﬁcations, support-
ing the linguistic hypothesis (Jackendoff, 1990)
and the earlier result of Merlo et al. (2002)
that Levin classes have a strong cross-linguistic
basis. Not only the general methodology but
also best performing features are transferable be-
tween the languages, making it possible to learn
useful classes for French automatically without
language-speciﬁc tuning.

2 French Gold Standard
The development of an automatic verb classiﬁ-
cation approach requires at least an initial gold
standard. Some syntactic (Gross, 1975) and se-
mantic (Vossen, 1998) verb classiﬁcations exist
for French, along with ones which integrate as-
pects of both (Saint-Dizier, 1998). Since none of
these resources offer classes similar to Levins’,
we followed the idea of Merlo et al. (2002) and
translated a number of Levin classes from English
to French. As our aim was to to investigate the
cross-linguistic applicability of classes, we took

an English gold standard which has been used to
evaluate several recent clustering works – that of
Sun et al. (2008). This resource includes 17 ﬁne-
grained Levin classes. Each class has 12 member
verbs whose predominant sense in English (ac-
cording to WordNet) belongs to that class.

Member verbs were ﬁrst translated to French.
Where several relevant translations were identi-
ﬁed, each of them was considered. For each can-
didate verb, subcategorization frames (SCFs) were
identiﬁed and diathesis alternations were consid-
ered using the criteria of Levin (1993): alterna-
tions must result in the same or extended verb
sense. Only verbs sharing diathesis alternations
were kept in the class.

For example,

the gold standard class 31.1
AMUSE includes the following English verbs:
stimulate, threaten, shock, confuse, upset, over-
whelm, scare, disappoint, delight, exhaust, in-
timidate and frighten. Relevant French transla-
tions were identiﬁed for all of them: abattre,
accabler, briser, d´eprimer, consterner, an´eantir,
´epuiser, ext´enuer, ´ecraser, ennuyer, ´ereinter, inon-
der. The majority of these verbs take similar SCFs
and diathesis alternations, e.g. Cette affaire ´ecrase
Marie (de chagrin), Marie est ´ecras´ee par le cha-
grin, Le chagrin ´ecrase Marie. However, stim-
uler (stimulate) and menacer (threaten) do not,
and they were therefore removed.

40% of

translations were discarded from
classes because they did not share the same aler-
nations.
The ﬁnal version of the gold stan-
dard (shown in table 1) includes 171 verbs in 16
classes. Each class is named according to the
original Levin class. The smallest class (30.3) in-
cludes 7 verbs and the largest (37.3) 16. The aver-
age number of verbs per class is 10.7.

3 Verb Clustering

We performed an experiment where we

• took a French corpus and a SCF lexicon au-

tomatically extracted from that corpus,

• extracted from these resources a range of fea-
tures (lexical, syntactic and semantic) – a
representative sample of those employed in
recent English experiments,

• clustered the features using a method which
has proved promising in both English and
German experiments: spectral clustering,

• evaluated the clusters both quantitatively (us-

ing the gold standard) and qualitatively,

• and compared the performance to that re-
cently obtained for English in order to gain
a better understanding of the cross-linguistic
and language-speciﬁc properties of verb clas-
siﬁcation

This work is described in the subsequent sections.

3.1 Data: the LexSchem Lexicon
We extracted the features for clustering from
LexSchem (Messiant et al., 2008). This large sub-
categorization lexicon provides SCF frequency in-
formation for 3,297 French verbs. It was acquired
fully automatically from Le Monde newspaper
corpus (200M words from years 1991-2000) us-
ing ASSCI – a recent subcategorization acquisi-
tion system for French (Messiant, 2008). Systems
similar to ASSCI have been used in recent verb
classiﬁcation works e.g. (Schulte im Walde, 2006;

Li and Brew, 2008; Sun and Korhonen, 2009).
Like these other systems, ASSCI takes raw corpus
data as input. The data is ﬁrst tagged and lemma-
tized using the Tree-Tagger and then parsed us-
ing Syntex (Bourigault et al., 2005). Syntex is
a shallow parser which employs a combination
of statistics and heuristics to identify grammati-
cal relations (GRs) in sentences. ASSCI considers
GRs where the target verbs occur and constructs
SCFs from nominal, prepositional and adjectival
phrases, and inﬁnitival and subordinate clauses.
When a verb has no dependency, its SCF is con-
sidered as intransitive. ASSCI assumes no pre-
deﬁned list of SCFs but almost any combination
of permitted constructions can appear as a candi-
date SCF. The number of automatically generated
SCF types in LexSchem is 336.

Many candidate SCFs are noisy due to process-
ing errors and the difﬁculty of argument-adjunct
distinction. Most SCF systems assume that true
arguments occur in argument positions more fre-
quently than adjuncts. Many systems also inte-
grate ﬁlters for removing noise from system out-
put. When LexSchem was evaluated after ﬁlter-

1059

ing its F-measure was 69 – which is similar to
that of other current SCF systems (Messiant et al.,
2008) We used the unﬁltered version of the lexi-
con because English experiments have shown that
information about adjuncts can help verb cluster-
ing (Sun et al., 2008).

4 Features

Lexical entries in LexSchem provide a variety of
material for verb clustering. Using this material,
we constructed a range of features for experimen-
tation. The ﬁrst three include basic information
about SCFs:

F1: SCFs and their relative frequencies with indi-
vidual verbs. SCFs abstract over particles and
prepositions.

F2: F1, with SCFs parameterized for the tense

(the POS tag) of the verb.

F3: F2, with SCFs parameterized for prepositions

(PP).

The following six features include informa-
tion about the lexical context (co-occurrences)
of verbs. We adopt the best method of Li and
Brew (2008) where collocations (COs) are ex-
tracted from the window of words immediately
preceding and following a lemmatized verb. Stop
words are removed prior to extraction.

F4, F6, F8: COs are extracted from the window
of 4, 6 and 8 words, respectively. The relative
word position is ignored.

F5, F7, F9: F4, F6 and F8 with the relative word

position recorded.

The next four features include information
about lexical preferences (LP) of verbs in argu-
ment head positions of speciﬁc GRs associated
with the verb:

F10: LP(PREP): the type and frequency of prepo-

sitions in the preposition (PREP) relation.

F11: LP(SUBJ): the type and frequency of nouns

in the subject (SUBJ) relation.

F12: LP(IOBJ): the type and frequency of nouns
in the object (OBJ) and indirect object (IOBJ)
relation.

F13: LP(ALL): the combination of F10-F13.

The ﬁnal two features reﬁne SCF features with
LPs and semantic information about verb selec-
tional preferences (SP):

F14-F16: F1-F3 parameterized for LPs.

F17: F3 reﬁned with SPs.

We adopt a fully unsupervised approach to SP
acquisition using the method of Sun and Korho-
nen (2009), with the difference that we determine
the optimal number of SP clusters automatically
following Zelnik-Manor and Perona (2004). The
method is introduced in the following section. The
approach involves (i) taking the GRs (SUBJ, OBJ,
IOBJ) associated with verbs, (ii) extracting all the
argument heads in these GRs, and (iii) clustering
the resulting N most frequent argument heads into
M classes. The empirically determined N 200
was used. The method produced 40 SP clusters.

5 Clustering Methods
Spectral clustering (SPEC) has proved promising
in previous verb clustering experiments (Brew
and Schulte im Walde, 2002; Sun and Korho-
nen, 2009) and other similar NLP tasks involv-
ing high dimensional feature space (Chen et al.,
2006). Following Sun and Korhonen (2009) we
used the MNCut spectral clustering (Meila and
Shi, 2001) which has a wide applicability and
a clear probabilistic interpretation (von Luxburg,
2007; Verma and Meila, 2005). However, we ex-
tended the method to determine the optimal num-
ber of clusters automatically using the technique
proposed by (Zelnik-Manor and Perona, 2004).

Clustering groups a given set of verbs V =
n=1 into a disjoint partition of K classes.
{vn}N
SPEC takes a similarity matrix as input. All our
features can be viewed as probabilistic distribu-
tions because the combination of different fea-
tures is performed via parameterization. Thus we
use the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) to con-
struct the similarity matrix. The JSD between

1060

is djsd(v, v0) =
two feature vectors v and v0
1
2 D(v||m)+ 1
2 D(v0||m) where D is the Kullback-
Leibler divergence, and m is the average of the v
and v0.

The similarity matrix W is constructed where
Wij = exp(−djsd(v, v0)).
In SPEC, the simi-
larities Wij are viewed as the connection weight
ij of a graph G over V . The similarity matrix
W is thus the adjacency matrix for G. The de-
j=1 wij. A cut be-
tween two partitions A and A0 is deﬁned to be

gree of a vertex i is di = PN
Cut(A, A0) =Pm∈A,n∈A0 Wmn.

The similarity matrix W is normalized into a

stochastic matrix P .

P = D−1W

(1)

The degree matrix D is a diagonal matrix where
Dii = di.

It was shown by Meila and Shi (2001) that if P
has the K leading eigenvectors that are piecewise
constant1 with respect to a partition I∗ and their
eigenvalues are not zero, then I∗ minimizes the
multiway normalized cut(MNCut):

Cut(Ik,Ik)
Cut(Ik,I)

MNCut(I) = K −PK

k=1

Pmn can be interpreted as the transition proba-
bility between vertices m, n. The criterion can
thus be expressed as MNCut(I) = PK
k=1(1 −
P (Ik → Ik|Ik)) (Meila, 2001), which is the sum
of transition probabilities across different clusters.
This criterion ﬁnds the partition where the random
walks are most likely to happen within the same
cluster. In practice, the leading eigenvectors of P
are not piecewise constant. But we can extract the
partition by ﬁnding the approximately equal ele-
ments in the eigenvectors using a clustering algo-
rithm like K-Means.

As the value of K is not known beforehand, we
use Zelnik-Manor and Perona (2004)’s method to
estimate it. This method ﬁnds the optimal value
by minimizing a cost function based on the eigen-
vector structure of W .

Like Brew and Schulte im Walde (2002), we
compare SPEC against a K-Means baseline. We
used the Matlab implementation with euclidean
distance as the distance measure.

1The eigenvector v is piecewise constant with respect to

I if v(i) = v(j)∀i, j ∈ Ik and k ∈ 1, 2...K

6 Experimental Evaluation
6.1 Data and Pre-processing
The SCF-based features (F1-F3 and F14-F17)
were extracted directly from LexSchem. The CO
(F4-F9) and LP features (F10-F13) were extracted
from the raw and parsed corpus sentences, respec-
tively, which were used for creating the lexicon.
Features that only appeared once were removed.
Feature vectors were normalized by the sum of the
feature values before clustering. Since our clus-
tering algorithms have an element of randomness,
we repeated clustering multiple times. We report
the results that minimize the distortion (the dis-
tance to cluster centroid).

6.2 Evaluation Measures
We employ the same measures for evaluation as
previously employed e.g. by ´O S´eaghdha and
Copestake (2008) and Sun and Korhonen (2009).
The ﬁrst measure is modiﬁed purity (mPUR) –
a global measure which evaluates the mean preci-
sion of clusters. Each cluster is associated with its
prevalent class. The number of verbs in a cluster
K that take this class is denoted by nprevalent(K).
Verbs that do not take it are considered as errors.
Clusters where nprevalent(K) = 1 are disregarded
as not to introduce a bias towards singletons:
nprevalent(ki)

mPUR = Pnprevalent(ki)>2

number of verbs

The second measure is weighted class accuracy
(ACC): the proportion of members of dominant
clusters DOM-CLUSTi within all classes ci.

ACC = PC

i=1 verbs in DOM-CLUSTi

number of verbs

mPUR and ACC can be seen as a measure of pre-
cision(P) and recall(R) respectively. We calculate
F measure as the harmonic mean of P and R:

F =

2 · mPUR · ACC
mPUR + ACC

BL = 1/number of classes

The random baseline (BL) is calculated as fol-
lows:
7 Evaluation
7.1 Quantitative Evaluation
In our ﬁrst experiment, we evaluated 116 verbs –
those which appeared in LexSchem the minimum

1061

of 150 times. We did this because English exper-
iments had shown that due to the Zipﬁan nature
of SCF distributions, 150 corpus occurrences are
typically needed to obtain a sufﬁcient number of
frames for clustering (Sun et al., 2008).

Table 2 shows F-measure results for all the fea-
tures. The 4th column of the table shows, for com-
parison, the results of Sun and Korhonen (2009)
obtained for English when they used the same fea-
tures as us, clustered them using SPEC, and evalu-
ated them against the English version of our gold
standard, also using F-measure2.

As expected, SPEC (the 2nd column) outper-
forms K-Means (the 3rd column). Looking at the
basic SCF features F1-F3, we can see that they per-
form signiﬁcantly better than the BL method. F3
performs the best among the three features both
in French (50.6 F) and in English (63.3 F). We
therefore use F3 as the SCF feature in F14-F17
(the same was done for English).

In French, most CO features (F4-F9) outper-
form SCF features. The best result is obtained
with F7: 55.1 F. This is clearly better than the
best SCF result 50.6 (F3). This result is interesting
since SCFs correspond better than COs with fea-
tures used in manual Levin classiﬁcation. Also,
SCFs perform considerably better than COs in the
English experiment (we only have the result for F4
available, but it is considerably lower than the re-
sult for F3). However, earlier English studies have
reported contradictory results (e.g. Li and Brew
(2008) showed that CO performs better than SCF
in supervised verb classiﬁcation), indicating that
the role of CO features in verb classiﬁcation re-
quires further investigation.

Looking at the LP features, F13 produces the
best F (52.7) for French which is slightly better
than the best SCF result for the language. Also
in English, F13 performs the best in this feature
group and yields a higher result than the best SCF-
based feature F3.

Parameterizing the best SCF feature F3 with LPs
(F14-16) and SPs (F17) yields better performance

2Note that the results for the two languages are not mu-
tually comparable due to differences in test sets, data sizes,
and feature extraction systems (see Section 8 for discussion).
The results for English are included so that we can compare
the relative performance of individual features in the two lan-
guages in question.

in French. F15 and F17 have the F of 54.5 and
54.6, respectively. These results are so close to
the result of the best CO feature F7 (55.1 – which
is the highest result in this experiment) that the
differences are not statistically signiﬁcant. In En-
glish, the results of F14-F17 are similarly good;
however, only F17 beats the already high perfor-
mance of F13.

On the basis of this experiment, it is difﬁcult to
tell whether shallow CO features or more sophisti-
cated SCF-based features are better for French. In
the English experiment sophisticated features per-
formed better (the SCF-SP feature was the best).
However,
the English experiment employed a
much larger dataset. These more sophisticated
features may suffer from data sparseness in our
French experiment since although we required the
minimum of 150 occurrences per verb, verb clus-
tering performance tends to improve when more
data is available, and given the ﬁne-grained nature
of LexShem SCFs it is likely that more data is re-
quired for optimal performance.

We therefore performed another experiment
with French on the full set of 147 verbs, using
SPEC, where we investigated the effect of instance
ﬁltering on the performance of the best features
from each feature group: F3, F7, F13 and F17.
The results shown in Table 3 reveal that the perfor-
mance of the features remains fairly similar until
the instance threshold of 1000. When 2000 occur-
rences per verb are used, the differences become
clearer, until at the threshold of 4000, it is obvious
that the most sophisticated SCF-SP feature F17 is
by far the best feature for French (65.4 F) and the
SCF feature F3 the second best (60.5 F). The CO-
feature F7 and the LP feature F13 are not nearly as
good (53.4 and 51.0 F).

Although the results at different thresholds are
not comparable due to the different number of
verbs and classes (see columns 2-3), the results
for features at the same threshold are. Those re-
sults suggest that when 2000 or more occurrences
per verb are used, most features perform like they
performed for English in the experiment of Sun
and Korhonen (2009), with CO being the least in-
formative3 and SCF-SP being the most informa-

3However, it is worth noting that CO is not a useless fea-
ture. As table 3 shows, when 150 or fewer occurrences are

Table 3: The effect of verb frequency

tive feature. The only exception is the LP feature
which performed better than CO in English.

7.2 Qualitative Evaluation
We conducted qualitative analysis of the clusters
for French:
those created using SPEC with F17
and F3. Verbs in the gold standard classes 29.2,
36.1, 37.3, 37.7 and 47.3 (Table 1) performed
particularly well, with the majority of member
verbs found in the same cluster. These verbs
are ideal for clustering because they have distinc-
tive syntactic-semantic characteristics. For exam-
ple, verbs in 29.2 CHARACTERIZE class (e.g. con-
cevoir, consid´erer, d´epeindre) not only have a very
speciﬁc meaning but they also take high frequency
SCFs involving the preposition comme (Eng. as)

available for a verb, CO outperforms all the other features in
French, compensating for data sparseness.

which is not typical to many other classes. Inter-
estingly, Levin classes 29.2, 36.1, 37.3, and 37.7
were among the best performing classes also in
the supervised verb classiﬁcation experiment of
Sun et al. (2008) because these classes have dis-
tinctive characteristics also in English.

The beneﬁt of sophisticated features which
integrate also semantic (SP) information (F17)
is particularly evident
for classes with non-
distinctive syntactic characteristics. For example,
the intransitive verbs in 43.1 LIGHT EMISSION
class (e.g. briller, ´etinceler, ﬂamboyer) are difﬁ-
cult to cluster based on syntax only, but semantic
features work because the verbs pose strong SPs
on their subjects (entities capable of light emis-
sion). In the experiment of Sun et al. (2008), 43.1
was the worst performing class, possibly because
no semantic features were used in the experiment.
The most frequent source of error is syntac-
tic idiosyncracy.
This is particularly evident
for classes 10.1 REMOVE and 45.4 CHANGE OF
STATE. Although verbs in these classes can take
similar SCFs and alternations, only some of them
are frequent in data. For example, the SCF ˆoter X
`a Y is frequent for verbs in 10.1, but not ˆoter X
de Y. Although class 10.1 did not suffer from this
problem in the English experiment of Sun et al.
(2008), class 45.4 did. Class 45.4 performs par-
ticularly bad in French also because its member
verbs are low in frequency.

Some errors are due to polysemy, caused partly
by the fact that the French version of the gold stan-
dard was not controlled for this factor. Some verbs
have their predominant senses in classes which are
missing in the gold standard, e.g.
the most fre-
quent sense of retenir is memorize, not keep as in
the gold standard class 13.5.1. GET.

Finally, some errors are not true errors but
demonstrate the capability of clustering to learn
novel information. For example, the CHANGE
OF STATE class 45.4 includes many antonyms
(e.g. weaken vs. strenghten). Clustering (us-
ing F17) separates these antonyms, so that verbs
adoucir, att´enuer and temp´erer appear in one clus-
ter and consolider and renforcer in another. Al-
though these verbs share the same alternations,
their SPs are different. The opposite effect can be
observed when clustering maps together classes

1063

which are semantically and syntactically related
(e.g. 36.1 CORRESPOND and 37.7 SPEAK). Such
classes are distinct in Levin and VerbNet, al-
though should ideally be related. Cases such as
these show the potential of clustering in discover-
ing novel valuable information in data.

8 Discussion and Conclusion
When sufﬁcient corpus data is available, there is
a strong correlation between the types of features
which perform the best in English and French.
When the best features are used, many individ-
ual Levin classes have similar performance in the
two languages. Due to differences in data sets
direct comparison of performance ﬁgures for En-
glish and French is not possible. When consid-
ering the general level of performance, our best
performance for French (65.4 F) is lower than the
best performance for English in the experiment of
Sun and Korhonen (2009). However, it does com-
pare favourably to the performance of other state-
of-the-art (even supervised) English systems (Joa-
nis et al., 2008; Li and Brew, 2008; ´O S´eaghdha
and Copestake, 2008; Vlachos et al., 2009). This
is impressive considering that we experimented
with a fully unsupervised approach originally de-
veloped for another language.

When aiming to improve performance further,
employing larger data is critical. Most recent ex-
periments on English have employed bigger data
sets, and unlike us, some of them have only con-
sidered the predominant senses of medium-high
frequency verbs. As seen in section 7.1, such dif-
ferences in data can have signiﬁcant impact on
performance. However, parser and feature ex-
traction performance can also play a big role in
overall accuracy, and should therefore be inves-
tigated further (Sun and Korhonen, 2009). The
relatively low performance of basic LP features
in French suggests that at least some of the cur-
rent errors are due to parsing. Future research
should investigate the source of error at different
stages of processing. In addition, it would be in-
teresting to investigate whether language-speciﬁc
tuning (e.g. using language speciﬁc features such
as auxiliary classes) can further improve perfor-
mance on French.

Earlier works most closely related to ours are

those of Merlo et al. (2002) and Ferrer (2004).
Our results contrast with those of Ferrer who
showed that a clustering approach does not trans-
fer well from English to Spanish. However, she
used basic SCF and named entity features only,
and a clustering algorithm less suitable for high
dimensional data. Like us, Merlo et al. (2002) cre-
ated a gold standard by translating Levin classes
to another language (Italian). They also applied a
method developed for English to Italian, and re-
ported good overall performance using features
developed for English. Although the experiment
was small (focussing on three classes and a few
features only) and involved supervised classiﬁca-
tion, the results agree with ours.

These experiments support the linguistic hy-
pothesis that Levin style classiﬁcation can be
cross-linguistically applicable. A clustering tech-
nique such as the one presented here could be used
as a tool for investigating whether classiﬁcations
are similar across a wider range of more diverse
languages. From the NLP perspective, the fact that
an unsupervised technique developed for one lan-
guage can be applied to another language with-
out the need for substantial tuning means that au-
tomatic techniques could be used to hypothesise
useful Levin style classes for further languages.
This, in turn, could facilitate the creation of mul-
tilingual VerbNets in the future.
