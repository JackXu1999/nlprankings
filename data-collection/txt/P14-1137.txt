Abstract

The sense in which a word is used deter-
mines the translation of the word. In this
paper, we propose a sense-based transla-
tion model to integrate word senses into
statistical machine translation. We build
a broad-coverage sense tagger based on
a nonparametric Bayesian topic model
that automatically learns sense clusters for
words in the source language. The pro-
posed sense-based translation model en-
ables the decoder to select appropriate
translations for source words according to
the inferred senses for these words us-
ing maximum entropy classifiers. Our
method is significantly different from pre-
vious word sense disambiguation reformu-
lated for machine translation in that the lat-
ter neglects word senses in nature. We test
the effectiveness of the proposed sense-
based translation model on a large-scale
Chinese-to-English translation task. Re-
sults show that the proposed model sub-
stantially outperforms not only the base-
line but also the previous reformulated
word sense disambiguation.

1 Introduction

One of very common phenomena in language is
that a plenty of words have multiple meanings.
In the context of machine translation, such dif-
ferent meanings normally produce different target
translations. Therefore a natural assumption is that
word sense disambiguation (WSD) may contribute
to statistical machine translation (SMT) by provid-
ing appropriate word senses for target translation
selection with context features (Carpuat and Wu,
2005).

∗Corresponding author

This assumption, however, has not been em-
pirically verified in the early days. Carpuat and
Wu (2005) adopt a standard formulation of WSD:
predicting word senses that are defined on an
ontology for ambiguous words. As they apply
WSD to Chinese-to-English translation, they pre-
dict word senses from a Chinese ontology HowNet
and project the predicted senses to English glosses
provided by HowNet. These glosses, used as the
sense predictions of their WSD system, are inte-
grated into a word-based SMT system either to
substitute for translation candidates of their trans-
lation model or to postedit the output of their SMT
system. They report that WSD degenerates the
translation quality of SMT.

In contrast to the standard WSD formulation,
Vickrey et al. (2005) reformulate the task of WSD
for SMT as predicting possible target translations
rather than senses for ambiguous source words.
They show that such a reformulated WSD can im-
prove the accuracy of a simplified word translation
task.

Following this WSD reformulation for SMT,
Chan et al. (2007) integrate a state-of-the-art
WSD system into a hierarchical phrase-based sys-
tem (Chiang, 2005). Carpuat and Wu (2007) also
use this reformulated WSD and further adapt it to
multi-word phrasal disambiguation. They both re-
port that the redefined WSD can significantly im-
prove SMT.

Although this reformulated WSD has proved
helpful for SMT, one question is not answered
yet: are pure word senses useful for SMT? The
early WSD for SMT (Carpuat and Wu, 2005)
uses projected word senses while the reformu-
lated WSD sidesteps word senses. In this pa-
per we would like to re-investigate this question
by resorting to word sense induction (WSI) that
is related to but different from WSD.1 We use

and WSD in Section 2.

WSI to obtain word senses for large-scale data.
With these word senses, we study in particular: 1)
whether word senses can be directly integrated to
SMT to improve translation quality and 2) whether
WSI-based model can outperform the reformu-
lated WSD in the context of SMT.

In order to incorporate word senses into SMT,
we propose a sense-based translation model that
is built on maximum entropy classifiers. We use a
nonparametric Bayesian topic model based WSI to
infer word senses for source words in our training,
development and test set. We collect training in-
stances from the sense-tagged training data to train
the proposed sense-based translation model. Spe-
cially,

• Instead of predicting target translations for
ambiguous source words as the previous re-
formulated WSD does, we first predict word
senses for ambiguous source words. The pre-
dicted word senses together with other con-
text features are then used to predict possible
target translations for these words.

• Instead of using word senses defined by a
prespecified sense inventory as the standard
WSD does, we incorporate word senses that
are automatically learned from data into our
sense-based translation model.

We integrate the proposed sense-based transla-
tion model into a state-of-the-art SMT system and
conduct experiments on Chines-to-English trans-
lation using large-scale training data. Results
show that automatically learned word senses are
able to improve translation quality and the sense-
based translation model is better than the previous
reformulated WSD.

The remainder of this paper proceeds as fol-
lows. Section 2 introduces how we obtain word
senses for our large-scale training data via a WSI-
based broad-coverage sense tagger. Section 3
presents our sense-based translation model. Sec-
tion 4 describes how we integrate the sense-based
translation model into SMT. Section 5 elaborates
our experiments on the large-scale Chinese-to-
English translation task. Section 6 introduces re-
lated studies and highlights significant differences
from them. Finally, we conclude in Section 7 with
future directions.

2 WSI-Based Broad-Coverage Sense
Tagger

In order to obtain word senses for any source
words, we build a broad-coverage sense tagger
that relies on the nonparametric Bayesian model
based word sense induction. We first describe
WSI, especially WSI based on the Hierarchical
Dirichlet Process (HDP) (Teh et al., 2004), a non-
parametric version of Latent Dirichlet Allocation
(LDA) (Blei et al., 2003). We then elaborate how
we use the HDP-based WSI to predict sense clus-
ters and to annotate source words in our train-
ing/development/test sets with these sense clus-
ters.

2.1 Word Sense Induction

Before we introduce WSI, we differentiate word
type from word token. A word type refers to a
unique word as a vocabulary entry while a word
token is an occurrence of a word type. Take the
first sentence of this paragraph as an example, it
has 11 word tokens but 9 word types as there are
two word tokens of the word type “we” and two
tokens of the word type “word”.

Word sense induction is a task of automatically
inducing the underlying senses of word tokens
given the surrounding contexts where the word
tokens occur. The biggest difference from word
sense disambiguation lies in that WSI does not
rely on a predefined sense inventory. Such a pre-
specified list of senses is normally assumed by
WSD which predicts senses of word tokens using
this given inventory. From this perspective, WSI
can be treated as a clustering problem while WSD
a classification one.

Various clustering algorithms, such as k-means,
have been previously used for WSI. Recently, we
have also witnessed that WSI is cast as a topic
modeling problem where the sense clusters of a
word type are considered as underlying topics
(Brody and Lapata, 2009; Yao and Durme, 2011;
Lau et al., 2012). We follow this line to tailor a
topic modeling framework to induce word senses
for our large-scale training data.

In the topic-based WSI, surrounding context of
a word token is considered as a pseudo document
of the corresponding word type. A pseudo docu-
ment is composed of either a bag of neighboring
words of a word token, or the Part-to-Speech tags
of neighboring words, or other contextual infor-
mation elements. In this paper, we define a pseudo

1460



document as ±N neighboring words centered on
a given word token. Table 1 shows examples of
pseudo documents for a Chinese word “wǎngluò”
(network). These two pseudo documents are ex-
tracted from a sentence listed in the first row of Ta-
ble 1. Here we set N = 5. We can extract as many
pseudo documents as the number of word tokens
of a given word type that occur in training data.
The collection of all these extracted pseudo docu-
ments of the given word type forms a corpus. We
can induce topics on this corpus for each pseudo
document via topic modeling approaches.

Figure 1(a) shows the LDA-based WSI for a
given word type W . The outer plate represents
replicates of pseudo documents which consist of
N neighboring words centered on the tokens of
the given word type W . wj,i is the i-th word of
the j-th pseudo document of the given word type
W . sj,i is the sense assigned to the word wj,i.
The conventional topic distribution θj for the j-
th pseudo document is taken as the the distribu-
tion over senses for the given word type W . The
LDA generative process for sense induction is as
follows: 1) for each pseudo document Dj , draw a
per-document sense distribution θj from a Dirich-
let distribution Dir(α); 2) for each item wj,i in the
pseudo document Dj , 2.1) draw a sense cluster
sj,i ∼ Multinomial(θj); and 2.2) draw a word
wj,i ∼ φsj,i where φsj,i is the distribution of
sense sj,i over words drawn from a Dirichlet dis-
tribution Dir(β).

As LDA needs to manually specify the num-
ber of senses (topics), a better idea is to let the
training data automatically determine the number
of senses for each word type. Therefore we re-
sort to the HDP, a natural nonparametric gener-
alization of LDA, for the inference of both sense
clusters and the number of sense clusters follow-
ing Lau et al. (2012) and Yao and Durme (2011).
The HDP for WSI is shown in Figure 1(b). The
HDP generative process for word sense induction
is as follows: 1) sample a base distribution G0
from a Dirichlet process DP(γ, H) with a con-
centration parameter γ and a base distribution H;
2) for each pseudo document Dj , sample a dis-
tribution Gj ∼ DP(α0, G0); 3) for each item
wj,i in the pseudo document Dj , 3.1) sample a
sense cluster sj,i ∼ Gj ; and 3.2) sample a word
wj,i ∼ φsj,i . Here G0 is a global distribution
over sense clusters that are shared by all Gj . Gj is
a per-document sense distribution over these sense

clusters, which has its own document-specific pro-
portions of these sense clusters. The hyperparam-
eter γ, α0 in the HDP are both concentration pa-
rameters which control the variability of senses in
the global distribution G0 and document-specific
distribution Gj .

The HDP/LDA-based WSI complies with the
distributional hypothesis that states that words oc-
curring in the same contexts tend to have similar
meanings. We want to extend this hypothesis to
machine translation by building sense-based trans-
lation model upon the HDP-based word sense in-
duction: words with the same meanings tend to be
translated in the same way.

2.2 Word Sense Tagging

We adopt the HDP-based WSI to automatically
predict word senses and use these predicted senses
to annotate source words. We individually build a
HDP-based WSI model per word type and train
these models on the training data. The sense for a
word token is defined as the most probable sense
according to the per-document sense distribution
Gj estimated for the corresponding pseudo doc-
ument that represents the surrounding context of
the word token. In particular, we take the follow-
ing steps.

• Data preprocessing We preprocess the
source side of our bilingual training data as
well as development and test set by removing
stop words and rare words.

• Training Data Sense Annotation From the
preprocessed training data, we extract all
possible pseudo documents for each source
word type. The collection of these extracted
pseudo documents is used as a corpus to train
a HDP-based WSI model for the source word
type. In this way, we can train as many HDP-
based WSI models as the number of word
types kept after preprocessing. The sense
with the highest probability output by the
HDP-based WSI model for each pseudo doc-
ument is used as the sense cluster to label the
corresponding word token.

• Test/Dev Data Sense Annotation From the
preprocessed test data, we can also extract
pseudo documents for each source word type
that occur in the test/dev set. Using the
trained HDP-based WSI model that corre-
spond to the source word type in question, we
can obtain the best sense assignment for each
pseudo document of the word type, which
in turn is used to annotate the corresponding
word token in the test/dev data.

3 Sense-Based Translation Model

In this section we present our sense-based transla-
tion model and describe the features that we use as
well as the training process of this model.

3.1 Model
The sense-based translation model estimates the
probability that a source word c is translated into a
target phrase ẽ given contextual information, in-
cluding word senses that are obtained using the
HDP-based WSI as described in the last section.
We allow the target phrase ẽ to be either a phrase
of length up to 3 words or NULL so that we can
capture both multi-word and null translations. The
essential component of the model is a maximum

entropy (MaxEnt) based classifier that is used to
predict the translation probability p(ẽ|C(c)). The
MaxEnt classifier can be formulated as follows.

p(ẽ|C(c)) = exp(
∑

i θihi(ẽ, C(c)))∑
ẽ′ exp(

∑
i θihi(ẽ′, C(c)))

(1)

where his are binary features, θis are weights of
these features, C(c) is the surrounding context of
c.

We define two groups of binary features: 1) lex-
icon features and 2) sense features. All these fea-
tures take the following form.

h(ẽ, C(c)) =
{

1, if ẽ = 2 and C(c).µ = ν
0, else

(2)
where 2 is a placeholder for a possible target
translation (up to 3 words or NULL), µ is the name
of a contextual (lexicon or sense) feature for the
source word c, and the symbol ν represents the
value of the feature µ.

We extract both the lexicon and sense features
from a ±k-word window centered on the word c.
The lexicon features are defined as the preceding
k words, the succeeding k words and the word c
itself: {c−k, ..., c−1, c, c1, ..., ck}. The sense fea-
tures are defined as the predicted senses for these
words: {sc−k , ..., sc−1 , sc, sc1 , ..., sck}.

As we also use these neighboring words to pre-
dict word senses in the HDP-based WSI, the infor-
mation provided by the lexicon and sense features
may overlap. This is not a issue for the MaxEnt
classifier as it can deal with arbitrary overlapping
features (Berger et al., 1996). One may also won-
der whether the sense features can contribute to
SMT new information that can NOT be obtained
from the lexicon features. First, we believe that
the senses induced by the HDP-based WSI pro-
vide a different view of data than that of the lex-
icon features. Second, the sense features contain
semantic distributional information learned by the
HDP across contexts where lexical words occur.
Third, we empirically investigate this doubt by
comparing two MaxEnt-based translation models

1462



in Section 5. One model only uses the lexicon fea-
tures while the other integrates both the lexicon
and sense features. The former model can be con-
sidered as a reformulated WSD for SMT as we de-
scribed in Section 1.

Given a source sentence {ci}I1, the proposed
sense-based translation model Ms can be denoted
as

Ms =
∏

ci∈W
(ẽi|C(ci)) (3)

where W is a set of words for which we build
MaxEnt classifiers (see the next subsection for the
discussion on how we build MaxEnt classifiers for
our sense-based translation model).

3.2 Training

The training of the proposed sense-based transla-
tion model is a process of estimating the feature
weights θs in the equation (1). There are two
strategies that we can use to obtain these weights.
We can either build an all-in-one MaxEnt clas-
sifier that integrates all source word types c and
their possible target translations ẽ or build multi-
ple MaxEnt classifiers. If we train the all-in-one
classifier, we have to predict millions of classes
(target translations of length up to 3 words). This
is normally intractable in practice. Therefore we
take the second strategy: building multiple Max-
Ent classifiers with one classifier per source word
type.

In order to train these classifiers, we have to col-
lect training events from our word-aligned bilin-
gual training data where source words are anno-
tated with their corresponding sense clusters pre-
dicted by the HDP-based WSI as described in
Section 2. A training event for a source word c
consists of all contextual elements in the form of
C(c).µ = ν defined in the last subsection and the
target translation ẽ. Using these collected events,
we can train our multiple classifiers. In prac-
tice, we do not build MaxEnt classifiers for source
words that occur less than 10 times in the train-
ing data and run the MaxEnt toolkit in a parallel
manner in order to expedite the training process.

Translation Model

above is integrated into the log-linear translation
model of SMT as a sense-based knowledge source.

Figure 2 shows the architecture of the SMT
system enhanced with the sense-based translation
model. Before we translate a source sentence, we
use the HDP-based WSI models trained on the
training data to predict senses for word tokens oc-
curring in the source sentence as discussed in Sec-
tion 2.2. Note that the HDP-based WSI does not
predict senses for all words due to the following
two reasons.

• We do not train HDP-based WSI models for
word types for which we extract more than T
pseudo documents.2

• In the test/dev set, there are some words that
are unseen in the training data. These un-
seen words, of course, do not have their HDP-
based WSI models.

For these words, we set a default sense (i.e. sc =
s1).

Sense tagging on test sentences can be done in
a preprocessing step. Once we get sense clus-
ters for word tokens in test sentences, we load
pre-trained MaxEnt classifiers of the correspond-
ing word types. During decoding, we keep word
alignments for each translation rule. Whenever a
new source word c is translated, we find its trans-
lation ẽ via the kept word alignments. We then
calculate the translation probability p(ẽ|C(c)) ac-
cording to the equation (1) using the correspond-
ing loaded classifier. In this way, we can easily
calculate the sense-based translation model score.

2we set T = 20, 000.

5 Experiments

In this section, we carried out a series of ex-
periments on Chinese-to-English translation us-
ing large-scale bilingual training data. In order to
build the proposed sense-based translation model,
we annotated the source part of the bilingual train-
ing data with word senses induced by the HDP-
based WSI. With the trained sense-based transla-
tion model, we would like to investigate the fol-
lowing two questions:

• Do word senses automatically induced by the
HDP-based WSI improve translation quality?

• Does the sense-based translation model out-
perform the reformulated WSD for SMT?

5.1 Setup

Our baseline system is a state-of-the-art SMT
system which adapts Bracketing Transduction
Grammars (Wu, 1997) to phrasal translation and
equips itself with a maximum entropy based
reordering model (Xiong et al., 2006). We used
LDC corpora LDC2004E12, LDC2004T08,
LDC2005T10, LDC2003E14, LDC2002E18,
LDC2005T06, LDC2003E07, LDC2004T07 as
our bilingual training data which consists of
3.84M bilingual sentences, 109.5M English word
tokens and 96.9M Chinese word tokens. We ran
Giza++ on the training data in two directions
and applied the “grow-diag-final” refinement
rule (Koehn et al., 2003) to obtain word align-
ments. From the word-aligned data, we extracted
weighted phrase pairs to generate our phrase
table. We trained a 5-gram language model on the
Xinhua section of the English Gigaword corpus
(306 million words) using the SRILM toolkit
(Stolcke, 2002) with the modified Kneser-Ney
smoothing (Chen and Goodman, 1996).

We trained our HDP-based WSI models via the
C++ HDP toolkit3 (Wang and Blei, 2012). We
set the hyperparameters γ = 0.1 and α0 = 1.0
following Lau et al. (2012).We extracted pseudo
documents from a ±10-word window centered on
the corresponding word token for each word type
following Brody and Lapata (2009). As described
in Section 2.2, we preprocessed the source part
of our bilingual training data by removing stop
words and infrequent words that occurs less than

10 times in the training data. From the prepro-
cessed data, we extracted pseudo documents for
each word type to train a HDP-based WSI model
per word type. Note that we do not build WSI
models for highly frequent words that occur more
than 20,000 times in order to expedite the HDP
training process.

We trained our MaxEnt classifiers with the off-
the-shelf MaxEnt tool.4 We performed 100 iter-
ations of the L-BFGS algorithm implemented in
the training toolkit on the collected training events
from the sense-annotated data as described in Sec-
tion 3.2. We set the Gaussian prior to 1 to avoid
overfitting. On average, we obtained 346 classes
(target translations) per source word type with the
maximum number of classes being 256,243. It
took an average of 57.5 seconds for training a
Maxent classifier.

We used the NIST MT03 evaluation test data as
our development set, and the NIST MT05 as the
test set. We evaluated translation quality with the
case-insensitive BLEU-4 (Papineni et al., 2002)
and NIST (Doddington, 2002). In order to al-
leviate the impact of MERT (Och, 2003) insta-
bility, we followed the suggestion of Clark et al.
(2011) to run MERT three times and report aver-
age BLEU/NIST scores over the three runs for all
our experiments.

5.2 Statistics and Examples of Word Senses

Before we present our experiment results of the
sense-based translation model, we study some
statistics of the HDP-based WSI on the training
and test data. We show these statistics in Table 2.
There are 67,723 and 4,348 unique word types in
the training and test data after the preprocessing
step. For these word types, we extract 27.73M and
11,777 pseudo documents from the training and
test set respectively. On average, there are 427.79

pseudo documents per word type in the training
data and 2.71 in the test set. The HDP-based
WSI learns 271,770 word senses in total using the
pseudo documents collected from the training data
and infers 24,162 word senses using the pseudo
documents extracted from the test set. There are
4.01 different senses per word type in the training
data and 5.56 in the test set on average.

Table 3 illustrates six different senses of the
word “运营 (operate)” learned by the HDP-based
WSI in the training data. We also show the most
probable 10 words for each sense cluster. Sense s1
represents the operations of company or organi-
zation, sense s2 denotes country/institution/inter-
nation operations, sense s3 refers to market opera-
tions, sense s4 corresponds to business operations,
sense s5 to public facility operations, and finally
s6 to economy operations.

5.3 Impact of Window Size k used in MaxEnt
Classifiers

Our first group of experiments were conducted to
investigate the impact of the window size k on
translation performance in terms of BLEU/NIST
on the development set. We extracted both the lex-
icon and sense features from a ±k-word window
for our MaxEnt classifiers. We varied k from 5
to 15. Experiment results are shown in Table 4.
We achieve the best performance when k = 10.
This suggests that a ±10-word window context is
sufficient for predicting target translations for am-
biguous source words. We therefore set k = 10
for all experiments thereafter.

5.4 Effect of the Sense-Based Translation
Model

Our second group of experiments were carried out
to investigate whether the sense-base translation
model is able to improve translation quality by
comparing the system enhanced with our sense-
based translation model against the baseline. We
also studied the impact of word senses induced by

the HDP-based WSI on translation performance
by enforcing the sense-based translation model to
use only sense features. Table 5 shows the experi-
ment results. From the table, we can observe that

• Our sense-based translation model achieves
a substantial improvement of 1.2 BLEU
points over the baseline. This indicates that
the sense-based translation model is able to
help select correct translations for ambiguous
source words.

• If we only integrate sense features into
the sense-based translation model, we can
still outperform the baseline by 0.62 BLEU
points. This suggests that automatically in-
duced word senses alone are indeed useful for
machine translation.

5.5 Comparison to Word Sense
Disambiguation

As we mentioned in Section 3.1, our sense-based
translation model can be degenerated to a reformu-
lated WSD model for SMT if we only use lexicon
features in MaxEnt classifiers. This allows us to
directly compare our method against the reformu-
lated WSD for SMT. Table 6 shows the compari-
son result.

From the table, we can find that the sense-
based translation model outperforms the reformu-
lated WSD by 0.57 BLEU points. This suggests
that the HDP-based word sense induction is bet-
ter than the reformulated WSD in the context of
SMT. Furthermore, as the reformulated WSD is
a degenerated version of our sense-based transla-
tion model which only uses the lexicon features,

6 Related Work

In this section we introduce previous studies that
are related to our work. For ease of comparison,
we roughly divide them into 4 categories: 1) WSD
for SMT, 2) topic-based WSI, 3) topic model for
SMT and 4) lexical selection.

WSD for SMT As we mentioned in Section
1, WSD has been successfully reformulated and
adapted to SMT (Vickrey et al., 2005; Carpuat and
Wu, 2007; Chan et al., 2007). Rather than predict-
ing word senses for ambiguous words, the refor-
mulated WSD directly predicts target translations
for source words with context information. Our
sense-based translation model also predicts target
translations for SMT. The significant difference is
that we predict word senses automatically learned
from data and incorporate these predicted senses
into SMT. Our experiments show that such word
senses are able to improve translation quality.

Topic-based WSI Topic-based WSI can be
considered as the foundation of our work as we
use it to obtain broad-coverage word senses to an-

notate our large-scale training data. Brody and La-
pata (2009)’s work is the first attempt to approach
WSI via topic modeling. They adapt LDA to word
sense induction by building one topic model per
word type. According to them, there are 3 sig-
nificant differences between topic-based WSI and
generic topic modeling.

• First, the goal of topic-based WSI is to di-
vide contexts of a word type into different
categories, each representing a sense cluster.
However generic topic models aim at topic
distributions of documents.

• Second, generic topic modeling explores
whole documents for topic inference while
topic-based WSI uses much smaller units in
a document (e.g., surrounding words of a tar-
get word) for word sense induction.

• Finally, the number of induced word senses
in WSI is usually less than 10 while the num-
ber of inferred topics in generic topic model-
ing is tens or hundreds.

As LDA-based WSI needs to manually spec-
ify the number of word senses, Yao and Durme
(2011) propose HDP-based WSI that is capable of

1466



determining the number of senses for each word
type according to training data. Lau et al. (2012)
adopt the HDP-based WSI for novel sense de-
tection and empirically show that the HDP-based
WSI is better than the LDA-based WSI. We follow
them to set the hyperparameters of HDP for train-
ing and incorporate automatically induced word
senses into SMT in our work.

Topic model for SMT Generic topic models
are also explored for SMT. Zhao and Xing (2007)
propose a bilingual topic model and integrate a
topic-specific lexicon translation model into SMT.
Tam et al. (2007) also explore a bilingual topic
model for translation and language model adapta-
tion. Foster and Kunh (2007) introduce a mixture
model approach for translation model adaptation.
Xiao et al. (2012) propose a topic-based similar-
ity model for rule selection in hierarchical phrase-
based translation. Xiong and Zhang (2013) em-
ploy a sentence-level topic model to capture co-
herence for document-level machine translation.
The difference between our work and these pre-
vious studies on topic model for SMT lies in that
we adopt topic-based WSI to obtain word senses
rather than generic topics and integrate induced
word senses into machine translation.

Lexical selection Our work is also related to
lexical selection in SMT where appropriate target
lexical items for source words are selected by a
statistical model with context information (Banga-
lore et al., 2007; Mauser et al., 2009). The refor-
mulated WSD discussed before can also be con-
sidered as a lexical selection model. The signif-
icant difference from these studies is that we per-
form lexical selection using automatically induced
word senses by the HDP on the source side.

7 Conclusion

We have presented a sense-based translation
model that integrates word senses into machine
translation. We capitalize on the broad-coverage
word sense induction system that is built on the
nonparametric Bayesian HDP to learn sense clus-
ters for words in the source language. We gen-
erate pseudo documents for word tokens in the
training/test data for the HDP-based WSI system
to infer topics. The most probable topic inferred
for a pseudo document is taken as the sense of
the corresponding word token. We incorporate
these learned word senses as translation evidences
into maximum entropy classifiers which form the

foundation of the proposed sense-based translation
model.

We carried out a series of experiments to vali-
date the effectiveness of the sense-based transla-
tion by comparing the model against the baseline
and the previous reformulated WSD. Our experi-
ment results show that

• The sense-based translation model is able to
substantially improve translation quality in
terms of both BLEU and NIST.

• The sense-based translation model is also
better than the previous reformulated WSD
for SMT.

• Word senses automatically induced by the
HDP-based WSI on large-scale training data
are very useful for machine translation. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first at-
tempt to empirically verify the positive im-
pact of word senses on translation quality.

Comparing with macro topics of documents in-
ferred by LDA with bag of words from the whole
documents, word senses inferred by the HDP-
based WSI can be considered as micro topics. In
the future, we would like to explore both the micro
and macro topics for machine translation. Addi-
tionally, we also want to induce sense clusters for
words in the target language so that we can build
sense-based language model and integrate it into
SMT. We would like to investigate whether auto-
matically learned senses of proceeding words are
helpful for predicting succeeding words.
