Abstract
In recent years, both cognitive and computational research has provided empirical analyses of

contextual co-occurrence of concrete and abstract words, partially resulting in inconsistent pictures.
In this work we provide a more fine-grained description of the distributional nature in the corpus-
based interaction of verbs and nouns within subcategorisation, by investigating the concreteness of
verbs and nouns that are in a specific syntactic relationship with each other, i.e., subject, direct object,
and prepositional object. Overall, our experiments show consistent patterns in the distributional
representation of subcategorising and subcategorised concrete and abstract words. At the same time,
the studies reveal empirical evidence why contextual abstractness represents a valuable indicator for
automatic non-literal language identification.

1 Introduction

The need of providing a clear description of the usage of concrete and abstract words in communication
is becoming salient both in cognitive science and in computational linguistics. In the cognitive science
community, much has been said about concrete concepts, but there is still an open debate about the nature
of abstract concepts (Barsalou and Wiemer-Hastings, 2005; McRae and Jones, 2013; Hill et al., 2014;
Vigliocco et al., 2014). Computational linguists have recognised the importance of investigating the
concreteness of contexts in empirical models, for example for the automatic identification of non-literal
language usage (Turney et al., 2011; Köper and Schulte im Walde, 2016; Aedmaa et al., 2018).

Recently, multiple studies have focussed on providing a fine-grained analysis of the nature of con-
crete vs. abstract words from a corpus-based perspective (Bhaskar et al., 2017; Frassinelli et al., 2017;
Naumann et al., 2018). In these studies, the authors have shown a general but consistent pattern: con-
crete words have a preference to co-occur with other concrete words, while abstract words co-occur
more frequently with abstract words. Specifically, Naumann et al. (2018) performed their analyses across
parts-of-speech by comparing the behaviour of nouns, verbs and adjectives in large-scale corpora. These
results are not fully in line with various theories of cognition which suggest that both concrete and ab-
stract words should co-occur more often with concrete words because concrete information links the
real-world usage of both concrete and abstract words to their mental representation (Barsalou, 1999;
Pecher et al., 2011).

2 The Current Study

In the current study we build on prior evidence from the literature and perform a more fine-grained
corpus-based analysis on the distribution of concrete and abstract words by specifically looking at the
types of syntactic relations that connect nouns to verbs in sentences. More specifically, we look at the
concreteness of verbs and the corresponding nouns as subjects, direct objects and prepositional objects.
This study is carried out in a quantitative fashion to identify general trends. However, we also look into
specific examples to better understand the types of nouns that attach to specific verbs.



First of all, we expect to replicate the main results from Naumann et al. (2018): in general, con-
crete nouns should co-occur more frequently with concrete verbs and abstract nouns with abstract verbs.
Moreover, we expect to identify the main patterns that characterise semantic effects of an interaction of
concreteness in verb-noun subcategorisation, such as collocations and meaning shifts.

The motivation for this study is twofold: (1) From a cognitive science perspective we seek additional
and more fine-grained evidence to better understand the clash between the existing corpus-based studies
and the theories of cognition which predict predominantly concrete information in the context of both
concrete and abstract words. (2) From a computational perspective we expect some variability in the
interaction of concreteness in verb-noun subcategorisation, given that abstract contexts are ubiquitous
and salient empirical indicators for non-literal language identification, cf. carry a bag vs. carry a risk.

3 Materials

In the following analyses, we used nouns and verbs extracted from the Brysbaert et al. (2014) collection
of concreteness ratings. In this resource, the concreteness of 40,000 English words was evaluated by
human participants on a scale from 1 (abstract) to 5 (concrete).

Given that participants did not have any overt information about part-of-speech (henceforth, POS)
while performing the norming study, Brysbaert et al. added this information post-hoc from the SUBTLEX-
US, a 51-million word subtitle corpus (Brysbaert and New, 2009). In order to align the POS information
to the current study, we disambiguated the POS of the normed words by extracting their most frequent
POS from the 10-billion word corpus ENCOW16AX (see below for details). Moreover, as discussed in
previous studies by Naumann et al. (2018) and Pollock (2018), mid-range concreteness scores indicate
words that are difficult to categorise unambiguously regarding their concreteness. For this reason and in
order to obtain a clear picture of the behaviour of concrete vs. abstract words, we selected only words
with very high (concrete) or very low (abstract) concreteness scores. We included in our analyses the
1000 most concrete (concreteness range: 4.86 – 5.00) and 1000 most abstract (1.04 – 1.76) nouns, and
the 500 most concrete (3.80 – 5.00) and most abstract (1.19 – 2.00) verbs. We chose to include a smaller
selection of verbs compared to the nouns because we considered verbs to be more difficult to evaluate
by humans according to their concreteness scores and consequently noisier and more ambiguous for the
analyses we are conducting.

The corpus analyses were performed on the parsed version of the sentence-shuffled English EN-
COW16AX corpus (Schäfer and Bildhauer, 2012). For each sentence in the corpus, we extracted the
verbs in combination with the nouns when they both occur in our selection of words from Brysbaert
et al. (2014) and when the nouns are parsed as subjects (in active and passive sentences: nsubj and nsubj-
pass), direct objects (dobj) or prepositional objects (pobj) of the verbs. In the case of pobj, we considered
the 20 most frequent prepositions (e.g., of, in, for, at) in the corpus.

In total, we extracted 11,716,189 verb-noun token pairs including 3,814,048 abstract verb tokens;
7,902,141 concrete verb tokens; 3,701,669 abstract noun tokens; and 8,014,520 concrete noun tokens.
In 2,958,308 cases, the noun was parsed as the subject of the verb (with 748,438 of them as subjects
in passive constructions), in 5,011,347 cases the noun was the direct object, and in 3,746,534 cases the
noun was a prepositional object. Already by looking at these numbers it is possible to identify a strong
frequency bias in favour of concrete words; we will discuss later in the paper how this bias affects the
results reported. All the analyses reported in the following sections are performed at token level.

4 Quantitative Analysis

In a pre-test we analysed the overall distributions of verbs and nouns according to their concreteness
scores. Figure 1 shows the overall distributions of verbs (left, M=3.4, SD=1.1) and nouns (right, M=3.9,
SD=1.6) included in our analyses. Overall, nouns have significantly more extreme values than verbs: the
majority of concrete nouns have concreteness scores clustering around 5.00 while concrete verbs cluster
around 4.0. Similarly, abstract nouns have significantly lower scores (i.e., they are more abstract) than

abstract verbs. The numerical difference in the presence of extreme scores is also highlighted by the
much higher standard deviation characterising nouns compared to verbs. We interpret the lower amount
of “real” extremes (1 and 5) for verbs as an indicator of the difficulty that participants had to clearly norm
verbs compared to nouns. For example, while comparing the nouns belief1.2 and ball5.0 humans would
have a clear agreement on highly abstract and highly concrete scores; on the contrary, the distinction
between moralise1.4 and sit4.8 might be less clear.1

In our main study, we analysed the concreteness of the nouns that are in a specific and direct syn-
tactic relation with verbs. The overall distributions in Figure 2 are extremely consistent across syntactic
relations: when looking at the means, the concreteness of nouns subcategorised by concrete verbs is sig-
nificantly higher than the concreteness of nouns subcategorised by abstract verbs (all p-values < 0.001).
This result is perfectly in line with the more general analysis by Naumann et al. (2018).

Table 1 investigates more deeply the interaction between the concreteness of verbs and nouns for dif-
ferent syntactic functions. It reports the average concreteness scores of the nouns subcategorised by con-
crete and abstract verbs (± standard deviation), the difference between the concrete and abstract scores
(with significance tests) and the overall average concreteness score by function. The statistical analyses
have been performed using a standard linear regression model. The comparison between the scores in
the first two columns (Abstract Verbs and Concrete Verbs) confirms that subject and direct object nouns
that are subcategorised by concrete verbs are significantly more concrete than those subcategorised by
abstract verbs. The “Difference C-A” column shows that these differences are all highly significant. In
addition, the nouns subcategorised by concrete verbs are extremely high on the concreteness scale (mean

values: 4.2 – 4.41) while the nouns subcategorised by abstract verbs have only mid-scores (mean values:
2.65 – 3.57).

By zooming in on the specific functions, we see that subjects are significantly more concrete than
direct objects for both abstract and concrete verbs. The concreteness scores of subjects of passivised
sentences are in between in both categories. This pattern is confirmed by looking at the ”Overall” column.

Prepositional objects that are subcategorised by concrete verbs are significantly more concrete than
prepositional objects subcategorised by abstract verbs, across prepositions. However, given the extreme
variability in the prepositions used, we will analyse the most representative pobjs more specifically in
the following section.

5 Qualitative Analysis

In order to better understand the patterns of concreteness behind each syntactic function introduced in
the previous section, we performed a series of qualitative analyses, by looking at the most frequent verb-
noun combinations grouped by syntactic function. For both functions nsubj and dobj we see the same
strong pattern as in the general analyses in Section 4: concrete verbs have a strong overall preference for
concrete complements (map4.9 show4.0, boil4.2 water5.0). Regarding abstract verbs, we find a preference
for subcategorising abstract direct objects (reduce2.0 risk1.6), but -in contrast- a preference for concrete
subjects (student4.9 need1.7). Appropriately, surface subjects in passivised clauses have preferences that
are in between those for surface subjects and direct objects in active clauses, presumably because they
are semantically comparable to the direct objects of the action encoded by the corresponding verb.

When looking into exceptions to this predominant pattern, we find collocations and non-literal lan-
guage, such as metaphors and metonyms. For example, metaphorical language usage occurs when con-
crete verbs attach to abstract direct objects (carry4.0 risk1.6 vs. carry4.0 bag4.9, catch4.1 moment1.6 vs.
catch4.1 insect4.9); while abstract verbs collocated with concrete direct objects trigger a metonymical use
(recommend1.7 book4.9 vs. write4.2 book4.9).

When looking at prepositional objects it is possible to identify three main behaviours: i) a main
preference for concrete verbs and nouns (e.g., “in” and “at”); ii) a strong interaction with abstract verbs
and nouns (e.g., “for”); iii) a mixed co-occurrence with both concrete and abstract verbs and nouns
(e.g.,“of”). The following paragraphs report a qualitative discussion about the predominant verbs and
nouns with regard to the four prepositions “in”, “at”, “for”, and “of”.

The preposition in manifests a very strong interaction with concrete verbs and concrete nouns. Some
examples among the most frequent ones in the corpus are: write4.2 in book4.9 and sleep4.4 in bed5.0.
The only rare exceptions to this pattern refer to idiomatic structures like: carry4.0 in accordance1.5 or
carry4.0 in manner1.6. Table 1 confirms that the preposition in triggers very high concreteness scores in
general and the highest concreteness scores for nouns that are subcategorised by concrete verbs.



The preposition at connects mainly concrete verbs with concrete nouns: sit4.8 at table4.9 and eat4.4
at restaurant4.9. However, in strong collocations it shows a preference for abstract nouns: jump4.5 at
chance1.6 or happen1.8 at moment1.6. This pattern is confirmed by Table 1 too, where concrete verbs
have high scores while abstract verbs have the lowest scores in the entire table.

The preposition for, on the other hand, mainly occurs with abstract nouns that are subcategorised by
abstract verbs: need1.7 for purpose1.5 and imagine1.5 for moment1.6. Exceptions to this pattern are due
to metonymic readings like write4.2 for magazine5.0 and run4.3 for office4.9. Correspondingly, we see the
lowest overall concreteness score across verbs in Table 1.

Finally, the preposition of shows a mixed interaction in the concreteness of verbs and nouns. This
preposition co-occurs mainly with very concrete verbs that however subcategorise both highly concrete
nouns (run4.3 of water5) but also highly abstract nouns (run4.3 of idea1.6) in cases of metaphorical use.
As expected, the overall concreteness for this function in Table 1 is among the highest both for concrete
and abstract verbs.

6 General Discussion & Conclusion

The aim of this study was to provide a fine-grained empirical analysis of the concreteness nature in verb-
noun subcategorisation. The general pattern already described in Naumann et al. (2018) is confirmed by
our quantitative analysis: overall, concrete verbs predominantly subcategorise concrete nouns as subjects
and direct objects, while abstract verbs predominantly subcategorise abstract nouns as subjects and direct
objects. A qualitative analysis revealed that exceptions to the predominant same-class interaction indi-
cate semantic effects in verb-noun interaction: collocation, metaphor and metonymy, which shows the
usefulness of detecting abstractness in the contexts of verbs as salient features in automatic non-literal
language identification.

A slightly more variable pattern emerges when looking at prepositional objects. We identified three
main clusters of prepositions that behave differently according to their preferred nouns and verbs. The
prepositions in the first cluster (e.g., “in” and “at”) co-occur mostly with concrete verbs and nouns; the
prepositions in the second cluster (e.g., “for”) have a strong preference for abstract verbs and nouns;
while the prepositions in the third cluster (e.g, “of”) show variability in the concreteness of the related
nouns. Once again, the divergence form the general pattern is often ascribable to cases of non-literal
language.

This study, on the one hand, provided additional and more fine-grained evidence of the clash between
the existing corpus-based studies and the theories of cognition which predict predominantly concrete
information in the context of both concrete and abstract words. This was achieved by zooming in on
the contexts which stand in a direct syntactic relation to the target word. In addition, they provided
useful indicators to the implementation of computational models for the automatic identification and
classification of non-literal language.
