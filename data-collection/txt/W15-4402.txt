Abstract 
 

This paper reports how to build a Chinese 
Grammatical Error Diagnosis system based on 
the conditional random fields (CRF). The 
system can find four types of grammatical 
errors in learners’ essays. The four types or 
errors are redundant words, missing words, bad 
word selection, and disorder words. Our system 
presents the best false positive rate in 2015 
NLP-TEA-2 CGED shared task, and also the 
best precision rate in three diagnosis levels. 

1 Introduction 

Learning Chinese as foreign language is on the 
rising trend. Since Chinese has its own unique 
grammar, it is hard for a foreign learner to write 
a correct sentence. A computer system that can 
diagnose the grammatical errors will help the 
learners to learn Chinese fast (Yu et al., 2014; 
Wu et al., 2010;Yeh et al., 2014;Chang et al., 
2014).  

In the NLP-TEA-2 CGED shared task data set, 
there are four types of errors in the leaners’ 
sentences: Redundant, Selection, Disorder, and 
Missing. The research goal is to build a system 
that can detect the errors, identify the type of the 
error, and point out the position of the error in 
the sentence.  

2 Methodology 

Our system is based on the conditional random 
field (CRF) (Lafferty, 2001). CRF has been used 
in many natural language processing applications, 
such as named entity recognition, word 
segmentation, information extraction, and 
parsing (Wu and Hsieh, 2012). For different task, 
it requires different feature set and different 
labeled training data. The CRF can be regarded 
as a sequential labeling tagger. Given a sequence 
data X, the CRF can generate the corresponding 
label sequence Y, based on the trained model. 
Each label Y is taken from a specific tag set, 

which needs to be defined in different task. How 
to define and interpret the label is a 
task-depended work for the developers. 
Mathematically, the model can be defined as: 
P(𝑌𝑌|𝑋𝑋) = 1

𝑍𝑍(𝑋𝑋)
exp(∑ 𝜆𝜆𝑘𝑘𝑓𝑓𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 )         (1) 

where Z(X) is the normalization factor, f𝑘𝑘 is a 
set of features, 𝜆𝜆𝑘𝑘 is the corresponding weight. 
In this task, X is the input sentence, and Y is the 
corresponding error type label. We define the tag 
set as: {O, R, M, S, D}, corresponding to no 
error, redundant, missing, selection, and disorder 
respectively. Figure 1 shows a snapshot of our 
working file. The first column is the input 
sentence X, and the third column is the labeled 
tag sequence Y. Note that the second column is 
the Part-of-speech (POS) of the word in the first 
column. The combination of words and the POSs 
will be the features in our system. The POS set 
used in our system is listed in  
Table 1, which is a simplified POS set provided 
by CKIP1. 

Figure 2 (at the end of the paper) shows the 
framework of the proposed system. The system 
is built based on the CRF++, a linear-chain CRF 
model software, developed by Kudo2.

2.1 Training phase 

In the training phase, a training sentence is first 
segmented into terms. Each term is labeled with 
the corresponding POS tag and error type tag. 
Then our system uses the CRF++ leaning 
algorithm to train a model. The features used in 
CRF++ can be expressed by templates. Table 12 
(at the end of the paper) shows one sentence in 
our training set.  
Table 13 (at the end of the paper) shows all the 
templates of the feature set used in our system 
and the corresponding value for the example. 
The format of each template is %X[row, col], 
where row is the number of rows in a sentence 
and column is the number of column as we 
shown in Figure 1. The feature templates used in 
our system are the combination of terms and 
POS of the input sentences. For example, the 
first feature template is “Term+POS”, if an input 
sentence contains the same term with the same 
POS, the feature value will be 1, otherwise the 
feature value will be 0. The second feature 
template is “Term+Previous Term”, if an input 
sentence contains the same term bi-gram, the 
feature value will be 1, otherwise the feature 
value will be 0. 

2.2 Test phase 

In the Test phase, our system use the trained 
model to detect and identify the error of an input 
sentence. Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4 show the 
labeling results of examples of sentences with 
error types Redundant, Selection, Disorder, and 
Missing respectively.

If all the system predict tags in the fourth column 
are the same as the tags in the third column, then 
the system labels the sentence correctly. In the 
formal run, accuracy, precision, recall (Clevereon, 
1972), and F-score (Rijsbergen,1979) are 
considered. The measure metrics are defined as 
follows. The notation is listed in

3.2 Experiments result 

In the formal run of NLP-TEA-2 CGED shared 
task, there are 6 participants and each team 
submits 3 runs. Table 8 shows the false positive 
rate. Our system has the lowest false positive rate 
0.082, which is much lower than the average.  
Table 9, Table 10, and Table 11 show the formal 
run result of our system compared to the average 
in Detection level, Identification level, and 
Position level respectively. Our system achieved 
the highest precision in all the three levels, but 
the accuracy of our system is fare. However, the 
recall of our system is relatively low. The 
numbers in boldface are the best performance 
amount 18 runs in the formal run this year.

4 Error analysis on the official test 
result 

There are 1000 sentences in the official test set of 
the 2015 CGED shared task. Our system labeled 
them according to the CRF model that we trained 
based on the official training set and the 
available data set from last year. 

The number of tag O dominates the number 
of other tags in the training set for sentences with 
or without an error. For example, sentence no. 
B1-0436, a sentence without error: 
{上次我坐了 MRT 去了圓山站參觀寺廟了，
O(上)，O(次)，O(我)，O(坐)，R(了)，O(MRT)，
O(去)，O(了)，O(圓山)，O(站)，O(參觀)，O(寺
廟)，O(了)} 

And, sentence no. A2-0322, a sentence with an 
error: 
{他們從公車站走路走二十分鐘才到電影院了，
O(他們)，O(從)，O(公車站)，O(走路)，O(走)，
O(二十)，O(分鐘) ，O(才) ，O(到) ，O(電影
院) ，R(了)} 
   Therefore, our system tends to label words 
with tag O and it is part of the reason that our 
system gives the lowest false positive rate this 
year. Our system also has high accuracy and 
precision rate, but the Recall rate is lower than 
other systems. We will analyze the causes and 
discuss how to improve the fallbacks. 

We find that there are 11 major mistake types 
of our system result. 
1. Give two error tags in one sentence. 
2. Fail to label the Missing tag 
3. Fail to label the Disorder tag 
4. Fail to label the Redundant tag  
5. Fail to label the Selection tag 
6. Label a correct sentence with Missing tag 
7. Label a correct sentence with Redundant tag 
8. Label a correct sentence with Disorder tag 
9. Label a correct sentence with Selection tag 
10. Label a Selection type with Redundant tag 
11. Label a Disorder type with Missing tag 
 
Analysis of the error cases: 
1. Give two error tags in one sentence: In the 

official training set and test set, a sentence 
has at most one error type. However, our 
method might label more than one error tags 
in one sentence. For example, a system 
output: {他是很聰明學生，O(他)，R(是)，
O(很)，O(聰明)，M(學生)}. Currently, we do 
not rule out the possibility that a sentence 
might contain more than one errors. We 
believe that in the real application, there 
might be a need for such situation. However, 
our system might compare the confidence 
value of each tag and retain only one error 
tag in one sentence. 
 

2. Fail to label the Missing tag: The missing 
words might be recovered by rules. For 
example, a system output: {需要一些東西修
理好，O(需要)，O(一些)，O(東西)，O(修
理好)} should be {需要一些東西修理好，
O(需要)，M(一些)，O(東西)，O(修理好)} 
and the missing word should be ”被” or “把”. 
A set of rule for ”被” or “把” can be helpful. 

 
3. Fail to label the Disorder tag: The disorder 

10



error is also hard for CRF model, since the 
named entity (NE) is not recognized first. 
For example, a system output: {離台北車站
淡水不太近，O(離)，O(台北)，O(車站)，
O(淡水)，O(不)，O(太)，O(近)} should be 
{離台北車站淡水不太近，D(離)，D(台北)，
D(車站)，D(淡水)，O(不)，O(太)，O(近)}. 
The disorder error can only be recognized 
once the named entities “台北車站” and ”淡
水” are recognized and then the grammar 
rule ” NE1+離+NE2+近” can be applied. 

 
4. Fail to label the Redundant tag: Some 

adjacent words are regarded as redundant 
due to the semantics. Two adjacent words 
with almost the same meaning can be 
reduced to one. For example: a system 
output: {那公園是在台北北部最近新有的，
O(那)，O(公園)，O(是)，O(在)，O(台北)，
O(北部)，O(最近)，O(新)，O(有的)} fail to 
recognize the redundant word R(台北) or 
R(北部). In this case, “新有的” is also bad 
Chinese, it should be “新建的”. However, 
the word segmentation result makes our 
system hard to detect the error. 
 

5. Fail to label the Selection tag: We believe 
that it required more knowledge to recognize 
the selection error than limited training set. 
For example, a system output: {這是一個很
好的新聞，O(這)，O(是)，O(一)，O(個)，
O(很)，O(好)，O(的)，O(新聞)} fail to 
recognize the classifiers (also called measure 
words) for”新聞” should not be ”個”, the 
most common Mandarin classifier. It should 
be “則”. A list of the noun to classifier table 
is necessary to recognize this kind of errors. 

 
6. Label a correct sentence with Missing tag: 

This case is relative rare in our system. For 
example, a system output: {一個小時以前我
決定休息一下，M(一)，O(個)，O(小時)，
O(以前)，M(我) ，O(決定)，O(休息) ，
O( 一 下 )} accurately contains no error. 
However our system regard a single “一” 
should be a missing error according to the 
trained model.  

 
7. Label a correct sentence with Redundant tag: 

There are cases that we think our system 
perform well. For example, our system 
output: {平常下了課以後他馬上回家，O(平

常)，O(下)，R(了)，O(課)，O(以後) ，O(他)，
O(馬上)，O(回家) }. Where “了” can be 
regarded as redundant in some similar cases. 

 
8. Label a correct sentence with Disorder tag: 

This is a rare case in our system. For 
example, a system output: {以後慢慢知道他
這種方式其實是很普通的交朋友的方式，

D(以後)，D(慢慢)，D(知道)，D(他)，D(這) ，
D(種)，O(方式)，O(其實)，O (是) ，O (很)，
O (普通)，O (的)，O (交) ，O (朋友)，O (的)，
O (方式) }. It is a sentence that cannot be 
judged alone without enough contexts.  

 
9. Label a correct sentence with Selection tag: 

In one case, our system output: {今天是個很
重要的一天，O(今天)，O(是)，S(個)，O(很)，
R(重要) ，O(的)，O(一)，O(天) }, where ”
個” is also not a good measure word. 

 
10. Label a Selection type with Redundant tag: 

Sometimes there are more than one way to 
improve a sentence. For example, a system 
output: {下了課王大衛本來馬上回家，
O(下)，R(了)，O(課)，O(王大衛)，O(本來) ，
O(馬上)，O(回家) }, which is no better than 
{下了課王大衛本來馬上回家，O(下)，
O(了)，O(課)，O(王大衛)，S(本來) ，O(馬
上)，O(回家) }. Where “本來” should be 
“就”. However, in a different context, it 
could be “本來想”+”但是…”.  

 
11. Label a Disorder type with Missing tag: 

Since a Disorder error might involve more 
than two words, comparing to other types, it 
is hard to train a good model. For example, a 
system output: {中國新年到了的時候，O(中
國)，O(新年)，O(到)，O(了)，M(的) ，
O(時候) } should be {中國新年到了的時候，
O(中國)，D(新年)，D(到)，D(了)，O(的) ，
O(時候) }, and the correct sentence should 
be “到了中國新年的時候”. A grammar rule 
such as “到了”+Event+”的時候” might be 
help. 

 
5 Conclusion and Future work 

This paper reports our approach to the 
NLP-TEA-2 CGED Shared Task evaluation. 
Based on the CRF model, we built a system that 
can achieve the lowest false positive rate and the 
highest precision at the official run. The 

11



approach uniformly dealt with the four error 
types: Redundant, Missing, Selection, and 
Disorder. 
  According to our error analysis, the difficult 
cases suggest that to build a better system 
requires more features and more training data. 
The system can be improved by integrating rule 
based system in the future. 

Due to the limitation of time and resource, our 
system is not tested under different experimental 
settings. In the future, we will test our system 
with more feature combination on both POS 
labeling and sentence parsing.
