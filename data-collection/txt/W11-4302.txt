Abstract

In this paper, we discuss some linguistic
phenomena that pose potential problems
for multilevel linguistic annotation of par-
allel corpora in general and specifically for
data encoding with state-of-art multilevel
corpus querying tools such as CQP. We de-
scribe the strategy we use for integrating
the standard hierarchical XML represen-
tation used to annotate such phenomena
in our aligned bilingual corpus GECCo
into a timeline-based format as used in
CQP. Thus, our framework supports effi-
cient multilevel representation as well as
corpus exploitation and querying of lin-
guistic data of arbitrary complexity.

1 Introduction

Gathering and providing a natural language cor-
pus of good quality requires the definition of data
models that mirror the complexity of natural lan-
guage data from written as well as spoken dis-
course. In recent years, much work has been
done to develop standards for annotations, anno-
tation schemes and coding practice guidelines (c.f.
(McKelvie et al., 2001), (Blache et al., 2010)) with
the aim of allowing data exchange between differ-
ent annotations tools and portability of corpora to
other platforms as well as the integration of cor-
pora. Yet, relative little attention has been devoted
to interfacing annotation schemes with the encod-
ing formats required by corpus query engines.

Although several efficient automatic systems
for parallel corpus exploitation have been devel-
oped, these systems are generally specialized for
the storage and retrieval of a very limited number
of annotation levels. For instance, UNITEX (Pau-
mier, 2000) only allows alignment on sentence
level, and although EMDROS (Petersen, 2004) is
a system for storing and retrieving annotated texts

that is very generic and applicable to almost any
kind of linguistic annotation, it does not allow
alignment.

In fact, very few corpus query tools such as
CQP (Christ, 1994), ANNIS2 (Zeldes et al., 2009)
or MATE (McKelvie et al., 2001) exist that can
handle multilevel annotated corpora. To our
knowledge, ANNIS2 is still in the development
phase, at the moment of writing, and MATE
(McKelvie et al., 2001) does not easily support
alignment of parallel corpora.

In this paper, we present our experience with the
multilevel query engine CQP developed within the
CWB Open Corpus Workbench (Christ, 1994), a
collection of open-source tools for managing and
querying large text corpora (ranging from 10 mil-
lion to 2 billion words).

Our focus will be on some problematic issues
that have been raised by our attempt to auto-
matically encode our multilevel-annotated bilin-
gual parallel corpus into CQP. The GECCo cor-
pus, which was developed in our research group
for the contrastive study of cohesion in English
and German combines automatic and manual an-
notation on different layers of linguistic knowl-
edge ranging from pos-tagging, syntax chunking
to semantic information such as linguistic chains
and coreference. We noticed that certain annota-
tions were difficult to encode employing state-of-
art query tools, namely those representing discon-
tinuous segments.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2
gives an overview of linguistic phenomena that
might lead to discontinuous segments. Section 3
describes the XML-based data format on which
multi-layer annotations in the corpus are based.
Section 4 deals with the strategy we adopted to
encode corpus annotations into CQP and in partic-
ular describes the strategy for encoding problem-
atic constituents such as discontinuous segments
into a timeline-based data format, as the one used

by CQP, so as to allow corpus querying and ex-
ploitation. Section 5 concludes with pointers for
future research.

2 Differences in Information Distribution
between English and German

This section is concerned with differences in in-
formation distribution between English and Ger-
man as these complicate annotation and exploita-
tion of parallel corpora. Here, structural shifts be-
tween originals and translations have turned out
to be particularly problematic in view of semi-
automatic annotation and querying of translational
equivalents or extraction for further processing.
They cause discontinuity in cases where the trans-
lational equivalents are aligned on the basis of se-
mantic criteria1.

2.1 Contrasts between English and German

General differences between English and Ger-
man such as case marking and word order (see
e.g. (Hawkins, 1986), (Koenig and Gast, 2007),
(Steiner, 2001) and (Teich, 2003)) are believed to
have implications with respect to the positional
options for the integration of information into sen-
tences. For instance, (Doherty, 2004) but also (Te-
ich, 2003) and (Steiner and Teich, 2004) note that
the order of information is more flexible in En-
glish at the beginning of declarative main clauses
where more than one constituent may occur be-
fore the verb complex. In contrast, German of-
fers more structuring options after the finite verb
(in the Mittelfeld) and an additional option be-
hind the non-finite verb (Nachfeld). This is due
to the topological peculiarity of the German ver-
bal bracket. Fabricius-Hansen (1999) highlights
the tendency of German to structure experien-
tial meaning more vertically and metaphorically
in contrast to a more horizontal and congruent
distribution of information in English. She in-
dicates ”recursive compounding, repeated nomi-
nalization, heavy prenuclear and postnuclear noun
phrase modification, and accumulation of adver-
bial adjuncts” (Fabricius-Hansen, 1999) as gram-
matical features that enhance hierarchical infor-
mation packaging. In summary, the differences
between English and German described above

1We opted for a semantic alignment as we assume that
only this kind of annotation provides the information nec-
essary for studying English-German contrasts in information
distribution and further phenomena of cohesion.

may provoke the following relevant shifts be-
tween originals and translation: Meaning that is
expressed inside phrases in German may be ex-
pressed by a subordinate or main clause or may
appear in a separate sentence in English. Meaning
that is expressed in a medium sentence position in
German may be shifted to the beginning or end of
a sentence or be incorporated in a separate sen-
tence in English. As a consequence of these shifts
we assume that meaning may be conveyed in En-
glish by a contiguous element at one particular po-
sition, while corresponding meaning may be real-
ized in German by separate elements in different
syntactic positions. We thus expect a higher num-
ber of discontinuous segments in German, both at
phrase and at clause level. In the following sec-
tion of this paper some examples of discontinuous
segments will be discussed.

2.2 Some examples for discontinuous
segments

We now go on to examine some stretches of text
from the GECCo corpus in which discontinuous
segments are encoded in case of semantic align-
ment. In German, discontinous segments at sen-
tence level may be caused by a tendency to encode
relevant information in the form of complex appo-
sitions in a middle position of the sentence:

(1) a. Dieser Lösung - und das ist für mich das
Wunder - haben zum Schluss alle zuges-
timmt:

b. The miraculous thing for me was that in
the end everyone agreed to this solution:

In the German original (1a), relevant and focused
information is inserted as a clausal apposition into
another sentence, without being related to one spe-
cific constituent. The same meaning is expressed
in the English translation (1b) by the subject and
predicate of the main clause turning the predicate
plus arguments of the German main clause in a
subordinate clause. The alignment of translational
equivalents therefore requires the annotation of a
discontinuous segment. Below is an example of a
discontinuous segment in German that is not only
annotated for alignment of translational equiva-
lents but also for the annotation of coreference.

(2) a. Sehr erfolgreich ist - und das
bestätigen mir vor Ort nicht nur
sozialdemokratische Kommunalpoli-
tiker - das Förderprogramm InnoRegio.

3



b. The InnoRegio funding programme has
been very successful – something local
politicians, and not just Social Democrats,
have confirmed.

In the German original (2a), a clausal apposition
is again inserted into another main clause. How-
ever, the anaphoric pronoun das in the apposition
refers to the whole main clause. Thus, the latter
has to be annotated as discontinuous segment in
order to mark it as the antecedent of the pronoun.
In the English translation (2b), the apposition is
retained but appears after the main clause, with-
out splitting it into two linear parts. Thus only one
continuous element needs to be segmented in the
translation for the annotation and alignment of the
antecedent. Another cause of discontinuous seg-
ments on sentence level are prepositional phrases
which, are again distributed more freely in Ger-
man than in English.

(3) a. Dieser Konsens ist trotz aller möglichen
Vorbehalte ein hohes politisches Gut.

b. Despite all possible reservations, this con-
sensus is a key political asset.

A prepositional phrase functioning as an adver-
bial occurs after the predicate (in the Mittelfeld) in
German (3a) but is moved to the beginning of the
sentence in the English translation (3b). Conse-
quently, alignment of the main clause according to
semantic criteria would result in a discontinuous
segment in German but not in English.

(4) a. Dieser Konsens ist, trotz aller möglichen
Vorbehalte, ein hohes politisches Gut,
das die Stiftung ”Erinnerung, Verant-
wortung und Zukunft” im Kuratorium
unter Leitung von Botschafter Kastrup
und durch den Vorstand aus Dr. Jansen,
Dr. Bräutigam und Botschafter Primor er-
halten muß.

b. Despite all possible reservations, this con-
sensus is a key political asset which the
Foundation ”Remembrance, Responsibil-
ity and the Future” must preserve on its
Board of Trustees. The latter is chaired
by Ambassador Dieter Kastrup. Board of
Trustees members Michael Jansen, Hans-
Otto Bräutigam, and Ambassador Avi Pri-
mor were elected the foundation’s execu-
tive officers.

In the German excerpt, a prepositional phrase
functioning as an adverbial occurs in the Mit-
telfeld (4a) before the right verbal bracket. The
meaning of this PP is realized in a separate sen-
tence in the English translation (4b). A meaning-
based alignment of the first English sentence
therefore includes a discontinuous element in the
German original.

Discontinuous segments on phrase level in Ger-
man may be due to distinct NP pre-modification
conventions (see (Koenig and Gast, 2007), (Do-
herty, 2004), (Fabricius-Hansen, 1999) and (Te-
ich, 2003)). In contrast to English, merely preposi-
tional phrases and finite relative clauses follow the
head noun in German. Constructions of medium
complexity are usually placed before the head
noun. These contrasts may complicate corefer-
ence chaining, on the one hand, and alignment of
elements of these chains in the parallel corpora, on
the other hand.

(5) a. über zwei Zeilen Lagerhäuser blicken
wir auf [das strömungslose Grau des
Hafenbeckens und auf die Landzunge,
die sich zwischen ihm und dem Fluss
erstreckt] A1. Seit Menschengedenken
gehört [dieses auf drei Seiten von Wasser
umgebene Gelände] B1 der chemischen
Industrie.

b. We look across two rows of warehouses at
[the motionless grey surface of the harbor
basin and the tongue of land that extends
between it and the river] A2. Enclosed on
three sides by water, [this area] B2 has
been a preserve of the chemical industry
for as long as anyone can remember.

The German antecedent (A1) and its English
translational equivalent (A2) exhibit similar NP
structures. At the same time, there are some po-
sitional differences between the German anaphor
(B1) and the corresponding anaphor in the English
translation (B2): While the German noun phrase
contains several premodifying elements, the En-
glish anaphor only consists of the demonstrative
determiner and the head noun. The reason for this
is that the non-finite predicate argument construc-
tion ”auf drei Seiten von Wasser umgebene” in-
serted between the demonstrative determiner and
the nominal head in German could not be realized
as premodifier in English. The translator chose
to separate it from the rest of the noun phrase

4



and transformed it into an adverbial clause func-
tioning as a clausal adverbial at sentence level.
Hence, semantic alignment of the English subject
”this area” results in the annotation of a discon-
tinuous segment in German, consisting of ”diese”
and ”Gelände”. Flexible positioning of complex
NP postmodifiers in German may also yield dis-
continuous segments:

(6) a. This occurred just after I took a turn-
ing and found myself on a road curving
around the edge of a hill.

b. Dies geschah kurz nach einer Abzwei-
gung, als ich mich plötzlich auf einer
Straße befand, die in Kurven an einem
Hang entlangführte.

The relative clause occurs after the nominal
head in both the English original and its German
translation. However, the heavy NP shift enables
the German relative clause to be postponed after
the predicate. The alignment of the corresponding
relative clauses entails annotating a discontinuous
element in German.

(7) a. Aber wenn die Notwendigkeit von Re-
formen besser verstanden wird, als die
Bereitschaft verbreitet ist, diese zu un-
terstützen (...)

b. However, if the awareness of necessary
reforms is greater than the willingness to
support these reforms (...)

In the example above, the infinitive plus argu-
ment postmodifying the NP head ”Bereitschaft”
occurs after the predicate, while the correspond-
ing infinitive construction appears directly after
the NP head ”willingness” in English. The align-
ment of both noun phrases requires the creation of
a discontinuous segment in German.

Although we assume that the number of discon-
tinuous segments may be higher in the German
than in the English corpus, for the reasons high-
lighted above, note should be made of the fact that
English-German contrasts may also trigger dis-
continuous elements in the English corpus as il-
lustrated by the following example:

(8) a. What is now clear from the historical ev-
idence of the last century is that in ev-
ery case where a poor nation has signifi-
cantly overcome its poverty, this has been

achieved while engaging in production for
export markets and opening itself to the
influx of foreign goods, investment and
technology; that is, by participating in
globalization.”

b. Anhand der historischen Beweise des
letzten Jahrhunderts ist jetzt klar, da
in jedem Fall, in dem eine arme Na-
tion ihre Armut in beträchtlichem Maße
überwunden hat, dies durch die Produk-
tion für Exportmärkte und die eigene
Öffnung für ausländische Waren, Investi-
tionen und Technologie geschah - das
heißt, durch die Beteiligung an der Glob-
alisierung.”

Pseudo-cleft constructions as employed in the
example above are a rather frequent strategy in
English for realizing clauses as subjects in Theme
position (see (Teich, 2003)). Equivalent construc-
tions are relatively rare in German, and indeed,
the meaning of the English pseudo-cleft clause is
realized as a main clause in the German transla-
tion. As a consequence, the complex prepositional
phrase of the English pseudo-cleft is moved to the
beginning of the sentence in German. An align-
ment of these two PPs therefore entails the cre-
ation of other discontinuous segments in the En-
glish original.

Other differences between English and German
causing discontinuous segments especially in En-
glish may result from the greater availability of
non-finite verb constructions or a more verbal re-
alization of meaning in general.

3 Annotation of Parallel Corpora

3.1 GECCo: A Multilingual Parallel Corpus
Our multilingual parallel corpus GECCo, which
is an extended version of the CroCo corpus (cf.
(Neumann, 2005)), was specifically designed to
support contrastive studies of English and German
texts as described in the above examples. To our
knowledge, it represents one of the few existing re-
sources containing annotation of cohesive devices
in parallel multilingual corpora. This type of infor-
mation plays a crucial role not only in contrastive
linguistics and translation studies but also in nu-
merous NLP research areas. Most of the informa-
tion encoded in the corpus was annotated manu-
ally. Further, the corpus includes manual clause
alignment.

For the time being, GECCo contains 10 differ-
ent registers, i.e. the eight registers of written lan-
guage of the CroCo corpus and two new regis-
ters (interviews and academic discourse) of spo-
ken language (see (Kunz and Koltunski, 2011) for
a more detailed description of the GECCo corpus
architecture). We are currently trying to enhance
the automatic annotation of the new registers by
means of manual annotation. Encoding the differ-
ent layers of manual annotation into CQP, we are
faced with the difficulty of encoding discontinuous
constituents as illustrated in section 2.

In conclusion we can say that the complexity of
linguistic annotations required for studying con-
trasts in English-German cohesive devices neces-
sitates both

(i) an annotation scheme capable of coping with
multilevel annotations, i.e. graph structures
and

(ii) a multilevel corpus query engine that can
cope with the complexity of our annotation
layers and data model.

3.2 Annotation data model
XML is generally considered to be a useful tool for
encoding complex structured language data. In-
deed, XML is a widely used standard for encod-
ing annotations of natural language corpora. Al-
though the base formalism cannot describe over-
lapping structures since it was originally designed
to represent tree structures only, its extension (Is-
ard and Thompson, 1998) with hyperlinks (href )
enables the representation of crossing and overlap-
ping structures.

In our corpus annotation framework we have
adopted a modular strategy. Each annotation layer
is represented as a different XML file generated by
MMAX2 (Müller and Strube, 2006) that supports
the manual annotation. The mapping of different
representation layers (the graph structure) is guar-
anteed by the (href) hyperlinks between the dif-
ferent XML files. Figure 1 shows some example
annotations from the corpus.

In order to allow further corpus query and ex-
ploitation, the linguistic information contained in
the XML files needs to be merged into a format
readable by a corpus query engine. As this oper-
ation is not straightforward in the case of discon-
tinuous segments, an overview of the potential dif-
ficulties will be provided in the following section.
.

4 Interfacing XML Annotations of
Discontinuous Segments in CQP

4.1 CQP data model
CQP is based on an XML-like corpus encoding
language that is compatible with the data model
we use for corpus annotation.

The primary data used in CQP are tokens. The
CQP language is a rigid positional system on the
token positions, i.e. the tokens are totally ordered,
providing a timeline for the incremental encoding
of structural attributes. CQP provides annotations
of two types of attributes:

• positional attributes: describe features related
to the tokens or token position such as part-
of-speech, morphological features, etc.

• structural attributes: describe features related
to ordered sets of tokens, such as syntactic
chunks, clauses, sentences, etc.

CQP allows for incremental information merg-
ing, i.e. structural attributes can be sequentially
integrated with the positional attributes so as to re-
fine the linguistic information present in the cor-
pus. Figure 2 displays an example of incremental
annotation encoding in CQP.

Further, CQP enables the representation of
overlapping structures, which is not allowed in
standard XML. However, as CQP uses the posi-
tions of tokens for storage and retrieval, discontin-
uous segments cannot be directly represented.

In conclusion we can say that, in order to en-
code the GECCo corpus annotation data into CQP,
the hierarchical XML representation used for en-
coding multi-layer annotations needs to be trans-
lated into the CQP timeline-based corpus repre-
sentation on the basis of the position of tokens.
The next section describes the strategy we employ
for encoding discontinuous constituents into CQP.

4.2 Representing discontinuous segments in
CQP

As we have seen previously, structural attributes
are encoded in CQP as ordered sets of token posi-
tions. Thus, a structural attribute TAG describing
an XML tag (e.g. token or chunk) can be defined
as the following sequence of token positions:

TAG = [t1, t2, ...., tn],

with [1, 2, ..., n] being a continuous sequence.
Therefore, in a TAG attribute no gaps are allowed.

7



Step1: tokens

311: they
312: put
313: it
314: back
315: in

Step 2: morphology

311: they Pro plural
312: put Verb
313: it Pro singular
314: back Adv
315: in Adv

Step 3: syntax

<np>
311: they Pro plural
< /np>
<vp>
312: put Verb
313: it Pro singular
314: back Adv
315: in Adv
< /vp>

Figure 2: Merging multi-layer XML annotations
into CQP.

In order to describe the strategy used to encode
discontinuous segments into CQP, we first give the
formal definition of a discontinuous structural at-
tribute.

Let TAG be a sequence of tokens describing the
structural attribute represented by an XML tag

TAG = [t1, ..., tj , ..., tj+n, ..., tk]

and GAPS a set of integer pairs such that

(xi, yi) ∈ GAPS iff
[xi, xi+1, ..., yi] is a sequence of integer
numbers without gaps

Then, the definition of a discontinuous se-
quence is as follows:

TAG is discontinuous iff
| GAPS |> 1

As CQP does not support the representation of
such discontinuous segments we adopt the fol-
lowing strategy: First, we split a TAG contain-
ing gaps into the set of its continuous subsets
(∪TAGi), i.e. sequences of tokens without gaps

<chunk id="ch133" gf=subj>
<token id="t311" string="they"/ >

< /chunk>
<chunk id=”ch134” gap id=”ch134-gap” gf=fiv>

<token id=”t312” string= ”put”/ >
< /chunk>
<chunk id="ch135" gf=dobj>

<token id="t313" string="it"/ >
< /chunk>
<chunk id="ch136" gf=adv loc>

<token id="t314" string="back"/ >
< /chunk>
<chunk id=”ch134” gap id=”ch134-gap” gf=fiv>

<token id=”t315” string=”in”/ >
< /chunk>

Figure 3: CQP XML-like representation of dis-
continuous segments.

TAG = ∪TAGi, e.i.
= ∪[xi, ..., yi], ∀(xi, yi) ∈ GAPS

Then, after having assigned an identical coin-
dex gap id to all the subsets of a discontinuous
TAG, we represent each of them as a standard
CQP structural attribute. At the query stage, the
segments that have been split are linked together
into a unique segment by a query macro that se-
lects structural attributes with the same gap id.

Summing up, the strategy we adopt consists of
three steps:

• partitioning the discontinuous segment into a
set of continuous subsets,

• representation of the continuous partitions of
the original set as standard CQP structural at-
tributes,

• reconstruction of the original discontinuous
segment at the query stage.

An example of a structure that cannot be di-
rectly encoded in CQP was given in Figure 1. The
English aligned clause contains a discontinuos
TAG segment representing a finite verb vp fin
(put in).

vp fin = [t312,t315],
Gapvp fin=[(312,312),(315,315)]

Figure 3 shows the CQP encoding of the contin-
uous subsets of vp fin defined by Gapvp fin for
this example.

After segment reconstruction, CQP will extract
the expected aligned finite verb chunks from the
clause-aligned German/English corpus:

vp fin GE = [einsetzen]

Figure 4 represents the output obtained by
querying the GECCo corpus with CQP. In par-
ticular, it shows how the framework described in
this paper permits both an efficient encoding and
querying of linguistic annotations (e.g. the align-
ment of linguistic discontinuous constituents such
as (1) with (2)) in CQP.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we have discussed problematic is-
sues that may arise in connection with the auto-
matic encoding of a manually annotated corpus
into the multilevel corpus query engine CQP. Man-
ual corpus annotation often produces complexly
structured representations of the linguistic infor-
mation displayed in the corpus that are difficult
to encode using general state-of-art corpus query
tools.

While much research has addressed the issue of
providing annotation standards for linguistic cor-
pora, only a few resources (e.g. ANNIS2 and
MATE) exist that provide efficient interfacing of
those multi-layer annotations standards with cor-

pus query engines. However, MATE (McKelvie et
al., 2001) does not support parallel corpora encod-
ing. ANNIS 2 (Zeldes et al., 2009) for instance
provides translation utilities from arbitrary XML
data structures to the ANNIS format. The An-
nis2 representation format allows the representa-
tion and graphs and discontinuous constituents of
arbitrary complexity. However, the corpus query
language provided by this system is highly com-
plex and requires a high level of expertise on the
part of the user.

In this paper we proposed a CQP-based alterna-
tive to ANNIS2. We described the strategy we im-
plemented that allows the encoding and querying
in CQP of multi-layer parallel corpora that include
linguistic phenomena of arbitrary complexity.

Our framework compares well with frameworks
such as the one implemented into ANNIS 2 in that
it combines all the advantages of the corpus query
engine CQP, e.g. efficient querying of very large
text corpora, efficient querying of parallel corpora
and an intuitive and user-friendly corpus query
language, with a framework for encoding arbitrary
complex data structures into CQP.
