Abstract

Paraphrasing exemplifies the ability to abstract
semantic content from surface forms. Recent
work on automatic paraphrasing is dominated
by methods leveraging Machine Translation
(MT) as an intermediate step. This contrasts
with humans, who can paraphrase without be-
ing bilingual. This work proposes to learn
paraphrasing models from an unlabeled mono-
lingual corpus only. To that end, we propose a
residual variant of vector-quantized variational
auto-encoder.

We compare with MT-based approaches on
paraphrase identification, generation, and
training augmentation. Monolingual para-
phrasing outperforms unsupervised translation
in all settings. Comparisons with supervised
translation are more mixed: monolingual para-
phrasing is interesting for identification and
augmentation; supervised translation is supe-
rior for generation.

1 Introduction

Many methods have been developed to generate
paraphrases automatically (Madnani and J. Dorr,
2010). Approaches relying on Machine Transla-
tion (MT) have proven popular due to the scarcity
of labeled paraphrase pairs (Callison-Burch, 2007;
Mallinson et al., 2017; Iyyer et al., 2018). Recent
progress in MT with neural methods (Bahdanau
et al., 2014; Vaswani et al., 2017) has popularized
this latter strategy. Conceptually, translation is ap-
pealing since it abstracts semantic content from
its linguistic realization. For instance, assigning
the same source sentence to multiple translators
will result in a rich set of semantically close sen-
tences (Callison-Burch, 2007). At the same time,
bilingualism does not seem necessary to humans
to generate paraphrases.

This work evaluates if data in two languages
is necessary for paraphrasing. We consider three

settings: supervised translation (parallel bilin-
gual data is used), unsupervised translation (non-
parallel corpora in two languages are used) and
monolingual (only unlabeled data in the para-
phrasing language is used). Our comparison
devises comparable encoder-decoder neural net-
works for all three settings. While the litera-
ture on supervised (Bahdanau et al., 2014; Cho
et al., 2014; Vaswani et al., 2017) and unsuper-
vised translation (Lample et al., 2018a; Artetxe
et al., 2018; Lample et al., 2018b) offer solu-
tions for the bilingual settings, monolingual neural
paraphrase generation has not received the same
attention.

We consider discrete and continuous auto-
encoders in an unlabeled monolingual setting, and
contribute improvements in that context. We in-
troduce a model based on Vector-Quantized Auto-
Encoders, VQ-VAE (van den Oord et al., 2017),
for generating paraphrases in a purely monolin-
gual setting. Our model introduces residual con-
nections parallel to the quantized bottleneck. This
lets us interpolate from classical continuous auto-
encoder (Vincent et al., 2010) to VQ-VAE. Com-
pared to VQ-VAE, our architecture offers a better
control over the decoder entropy and eases opti-
mization. Compared to continuous auto-encoder,
our method permits the generation of diverse, but
semantically close sentences from an input sen-
tence.

We compare paraphrasing models over intrin-
sic and extrinsic metrics. Our intrinsic evalua-
tion evaluates paraphrase identification, and gen-
erations. Our extrinsic evaluation reports the im-
pact of training augmentation with paraphrases
on text classification. Overall, monolingual ap-
proaches can outperform unsupervised translation
in all settings. Comparison with supervised trans-
lation shows that parallel data provides valuable
information for paraphrase generation compared



6034

to purely monolingual training.

2 Related Work

Paraphrase Generation Paraphrases express the
same content with alternative surface forms.
Their automatic generation has been studied for
decades: rule-based (McKeown, 1980; Meteer and
Shaked, 1988) and data-driven methods (Mad-
nani and J. Dorr, 2010) have been explored.
Data-driven approaches have considered different
source of training data, including multiple trans-
lations of the same text (Barzilay and McKeown,
2001; Pang et al., 2003) or alignments of com-
parable corpora, such as news from the same pe-
riod (Dolan et al., 2004; Barzilay and Lee, 2003).

Machine translation later emerged as a domi-
nant method for paraphrase generation. Bannard
and Callison-Burch (2005) identify equivalent En-
glish phrases mapping to the same non-English
phrases from an MT phrase table. Kok and Brock-
ett (2010) performs random walks across multi-
ple phrase tables. Translation-based paraphrasing
has recently benefited from neural networks for
MT (Bahdanau et al., 2014; Vaswani et al., 2017).
Neural MT can generate paraphrase pairs by trans-
lating one side of a parallel corpus (Wieting and
Gimpel, 2018; Iyyer et al., 2018). Paraphrase gen-
eration with pivot/round-trip neural translation has
also been used (Mallinson et al., 2017; Yu et al.,
2018).

Although less common, monolingual neural se-
quence models have also been proposed. In su-
pervised settings, Prakash et al. (2016); Gupta
et al. (2018) learn sequence-to-sequence models
on paraphrase data. In unsupervised settings,
Bowman et al. (2016) apply a VAE to paraphrase
detection while Li et al. (2017) train a paraphrase
generator with adversarial training.
Paraphrase Evaluation Evaluation can be per-
formed by human raters, evaluating both text flu-
ency and semantic similarity. Automatic evalu-
ation is more challenging but necessary for sys-
tem development and larger scale statistical anal-
ysis (Callison-Burch, 2007; Madnani and J. Dorr,
2010). Automatic evaluation and generation are
actually linked: if an automated metric would reli-
ably assess the semantic similarity and fluency of
a pair of sentences, one would generate by search-
ing the space of sentences to maximize that met-
ric. Automated evaluation can report the over-
lap with a reference paraphrase, like for transla-

tion (Papineni et al., 2002) or summarization (Lin,
2004). BLEU, METEOR and TER metrics have
been used (Prakash et al., 2016; Gupta et al.,
2018). These metrics do not evaluate whether the
generated paraphrase differs from the input sen-
tence and large amount of input copying is not
penalized. Galley et al. (2015) compare over-
lap with multiple references, weighted by qual-
ity; while Sun and Zhou (2012) explicitly penalize
overlap with the input sentence. Grangier and Auli
(2018) alternatively compare systems which have
first been calibrated to a reference level of overlap
with the input. We follow this strategy and cali-
brate the generation overlap to match the average
overlap observed in paraphrases from humans.

In addition to generation, probabilistic mod-
els can be assessed through scoring. For a sen-
tence pair (x, y), the model estimate of P (y|x) can
be used to discriminate between paraphrase and
non-paraphrase pairs (Dolan and Brockett, 2005).
The correlation of model scores with human judg-
ments (Cer et al., 2017) can also be assessed. We
report both types of evaluation.

Finally, paraphrasing can also impact down-
stream tasks, e.g. to generate additional training
data by paraphrasing training sentences (Marton
et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2018).
We evaluate this impact for classification tasks.

3 Residual VQ-VAE for Unsupervised
Monolingual Paraphrasing

Auto-encoders can be applied to monolingual
paraphrasing. Our work combines Trans-
former networks (Vaswani et al., 2017) and VQ-
VAE (van den Oord et al., 2017), building upon
recent work in discrete latent models for transla-
tion (Kaiser et al., 2018; Roy et al., 2018). VQ-
VAEs, as opposed to continuous VAEs, rely on
discrete latent variables. This is interesting for
paraphrasing as it equips the model with an ex-
plicit control over the latent code capacity, allow-
ing the model to group multiple related exam-
ples under the same latent assignment, similarly to
classical clustering algorithms (Macqueen, 1967).
This is conceptually simpler and more effective
than rate regularization (Higgins et al., 2016) or
denoising objectives (Vincent et al., 2010) for con-
tinuous auto-encoders. At the same time, train-
ing auto-encoder with discrete bottleneck is diffi-
cult (Roy et al., 2018). We address this difficulty
with an hybrid model using a continuous residual



6035

connection around the quantization module.
We modify the Transformer encoder (Vaswani

et al., 2017) as depicted in Figure 1. Our encoder
maps a sentence into a fixed size vector. This is
simple and avoids choosing a fixed length com-
pression rate between the input and the latent rep-
resentation (Kaiser et al., 2018). Our strategy to
produce a fixed sized representation from trans-
former is analogous to the special token employed
for sentence classification in (Devlin et al., 2018).

At the first layer, we extend the input sequences
with one or more fixed positions which are part of
the self-attention stack. At the output layer, the
encoder output is restricted to these special po-
sitions which constitute the encoder fixed sized-
output. As in (Kaiser et al., 2018), this vector is
split into multiple heads (sub-vectors of equal di-
mensions) which each goes through a quantization
module. For each head h, the encoder output eh is
quantized as,
qh(eh) = ck, where k = argmin

i
‖eh − ci‖2

where {ci}Ki=0 denotes the codebook vectors. The
codebook is shared across heads and training com-
bines straight-through gradient estimation and ex-
ponentiated moving averages (van den Oord et al.,
2017). The quantization module is completed with
a residual connection, with a learnable weight α,
zh(eh) = αeh + (1 − α)qh(eh). One can observe
that residual vectors and quantized vectors always
have similar norms by definition of the VQ mod-
ule. This is a fundamental difference with classi-
cal continuous residual networks, where the net-
work can reduce activation norms of some mod-
ules to effectively rely mostly on the residual path.
This makes α an important parameter to trade-off
continuous and discrete auto-encoding. Our learn-
ing encourages the quantized path with a squared
penalty α2.

After residual addition, the multiple heads of
the resulting vector are presented as a matrix to
which a regular transformer decoder can attend.
Models are trained to maximize the likelihood of
the training set with Adam optimizer using the
learning schedule from (Vaswani et al., 2017).

4 Experiments & Results

We compare neural paraphrasing with and with-
out access to bilingual data. For bilingual set-
tings, we consider supervised and unsupervised
translation using round-trip translation (Mallinson

et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2018) with German as the
pivot language. Supervised translation trains the
transformer base model (Vaswani et al., 2017) on
the WMT’17 English-German parallel data (Bo-
jar et al., 2017). Unsupervised translation con-
siders a pair of comparable corpora for training,
German and English WMT-Newscrawl corpora,
and relies on the transformer models from Lam-
ple et al. (2018b). Both MT cases train a model
from English to German and from German to En-
glish to perform round-trip MT. For each model,
we also distill the round-trip model into a single
artificial English to English model by generating
a training set from pivoted data. Distillation relies
on the billion word corpus, LM1B (Chelba et al.,
2013).

Monolingual Residual VQ-VAE is trained only
on LM1B with K = 216, with 2 heads and fixed
window of size 16. We also evaluate plain VQ-
VAE α = 0 to highlight the value of our residual
modification. We further compare with a monolin-
gual continuous denoising auto-encoder (DN-AE),
with noising from Lample et al. (2018b).

Paraphrase Identification For classification of
sentence pairs (x, y) over Microsoft Research
Paraphrase Corpus (MRPC) from Dolan and
Brockett (2005), we train logistic regression on
P (y|x) and P (x|y) from the model, comple-
mented with encoder outputs in fixed context set-
tings. We also perform paraphrase quality regres-
sion on Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) from
Cer et al. (2017) by training ridge regression on
the same features.

Finally, we perform paraphrase ranking on Mul-
tiple Translation Chinese (MTC) from Huang et al.

(2002). MTC contains English paraphrases col-
lected as translations of the same Chinese sen-
tences from multiple translators (Mallinson et al.,
2017). We pair each MTC sentence x with
a paraphrase y and 100 randomly chosen non-
paraphrases y′. We compare the paraphrase score
P (y|x) to the 100 non-paraphrase scores P (y′|x)
and report the fraction of comparisons where the
paraphrase score is higher.

Table 1 (left) reports that our residual model
outperforms alternatives in all identification set-
ting, except for STS, where our Pearson correla-
tion is slightly under supervised translation.
Paraphrases for Data Augmentation We aug-
ment the training set of text classification tasks for
sentiment analysis on Stanford Sentiment Tree-
bank (SST-2) (Socher et al., 2013) and ques-
tion classification on Text REtrieval Conference
(TREC) (Voorhees and Tice, 2000). In both cases,
we double training set size by paraphrasing each
sentence and train Support Vector Machines with
Naive Bayes features (Wang and Manning, 2012).

In Table 2, augmentation with monolingual

models yield the best performance for SST-2 sen-
timent classification. TREC question classifica-
tion is better with supervised translation augmen-
tation. Unfortunately, our monolingual training set
LM1B does not contain many question sentences.
Future work will revisit monolingual training on
larger, more diverse resources.
Paraphrase Generation Paraphrase generation
are evaluated on MTC. We select the 4 best trans-
lators according to MTC documentation and para-
phrase pairs with a length ratio under 1.2. Our
evaluation prevents trivial copying solutions. We
select sampling temperature for all models such
that their generation overlap with the input is 20.9
BLEU, the average overlap between humans on
MTC. We report BLEU overlap with the target and
run a blind human evaluation where raters pick the
best generation among supervised translation, un-
supervised translation and monolingual.

Table 3 shows examples. Table 1 (right) re-
ports that monolingual paraphrasing compares fa-
vorably with unsupervised translation while super-
vised translation is the best technique. This high-

5 Discussions

Our experiments highlight the importance of
the residual connection for paraphrase identifica-
tion. From Table 1, we see that a model with-
out the residual connection obtains 66.3%, 10.6%
and 69.0% accuracy on MRPC, STS and MTC.
Adding the residual connection improves this to
73.3%, 59.8% and 94.0% respectively.

The examples in Table 3 show paraphrases gen-
erated by the model. The overlap with the input
from these examples is high. It is possible to gen-
erate sentences with less overlap at higher sam-
pling temperatures, we however observe that this
strategy impairs fluency and adequacy. We plan to
explore strategies which allow to condition the de-
coding process on an overlap requirement instead
of varying sampling temperatures (Grangier and
Auli, 2018).

6 Conclusion

We compared neural paraphrasing with and with-
out access to bilingual data. Bilingual settings
considered supervised and unsupervised trans-
lation. Monolingual settings considered auto-
encoders trained on unlabeled text and introduced
continuous residual connections for discrete auto-
encoders. This method is advantageous over both
discrete and continuous auto-encoders. Overall,
we showed that monolingual models can outper-
form bilingual ones for paraphrase identification
and data-augmentation through paraphrasing. We
also reported that generation quality from mono-
lingual models can be higher than model based on

unsupervised translation but not supervised trans-
lation. Access to parallel data is therefore still
advantageous for paraphrase generation and our
monolingual method can be a helpful resource for
languages where such data is not available.
