Abstract 
1This paper introduces Japanese lexical simplification.  Japanese lexical simplification is the 
task of replacing complex words in a given sentence with simple words to produce a new 
sentence without changing the original meaning of the sentence.  We propose a method of 
supervised regression learning to estimate complexity ordering of words with statistical 
features obtained from two types of Japanese corpora.  For the similarity of words, we use a 
Japanese thesaurus and dependency-based word embeddings.  Evaluation of the proposed 
method is performed by comparing the complexity ordering of the words. 

1 Introduction 
According to the statistical data collected by Ministry of Justice, there are about two million 

foreigners living in Japan today.  Around half of them do not have Japanese proficiency.  It has been a 
problem for foreigners since most of information is provided in Japanese. Lexical simplification is a 
process to make a sentence more readable for non-native speakers by replacing complex words to 
simpler ones that retain the same meaning.  A number of studies on lexical simplification have been 
conducted in recent years. Since the task of lexical simplifications is related with development of other 
tasks in natural language processing such as words similarity or paraphrasing words. Most of studies 
in simplification are conducted in English.  Since there are much larger data and many tools available 
for English compared with other languages.  In this paper, we tackle the sentence simplification 
problem in Japanese.  We propose a method for estimating complexity of Japanese words and for 
obtaining semantically similar words for the replacement of complex words. 

2 Related Work 
Dominant approaches of previous work in simplification are hybrid approaches, which combine 

deep semantic and monolingual machine translation (Narayan and Gardent, 2014), word alignment 
approach (Coster and Kauchak, 2011; Paetzold and Specia 2013; Horn, et al., 2014) or language 
modeling approach (Kauchak, 2013). The main limitation of these methods is that they depend on 
parallel corpus between simple and complex sentences such as English Wikipedia, Simple English 
Wikipedia or Newsela corpus (Xu et al., 2015).  

Another approach is to implement the simplification task of complex words by replacing them with 
the extract synonym words obtained from databases such as thesaurus (Devlin and Tait, 1998; De 
Belder and Moens, 2010), from dictionary definition or from WordNet (Kajiwara et al.,2013).  
Thesauri can provide good synonyms while their coverage is limited.  Recent work (Glavasˇand 
Stajner, 2015; Paetzold and Specia, 2016) approached the word embedding model (Mikolov et al., 
2013) to estimate word similarity and aims to mitigate the limitation of thesauri and parallel corpora. 

The next approach is to identify complex words and choose simpler words for replacing them, 
while keeping the same meaning of the original complex words. Identifying complex words is

common work before doing the simplification task (Carroll et al., 1998; Baustista et al., 2009; 
Paetzold and Specia, 2016).  Estimation of word complexity is mostly based on their frequencies 
(Devlin and Tait, 1998; De Belder and Moens, 2010; Kauchak et al., 2014, Kajiwara et al., 2015), their 
length (Bautista et al.,2009), judgment by user study (Paetzold and Specia, 2016), technical words in 
specific domains (Kauchak et al., 2014), basic vocabularies for children (Kajiwara et. al, 2013), 
Japanese Language Proficiency Test levels, or Easy Japanese corpus (Moku et al.,2012).  The recent 
work of (Kodaira et al., 2016) used crowdsourcing to for collecting simplification candidates of words.  

Our approach uses more than one resource.  We first use a thesaurus since thesauri produce the best 
candidates of synonyms.  For addressing the limitation of a thesaurus, we utilize dependency-based 
word embedding (Levy and Goldberg, 2014) since it is shown that dependency-based embedding 
highlights less topical and more functional similarity than the skip-gram models. For identification of 
complexity of words, we use existing approaches like frequency, words used by children, technical 
words, and Japanese Language Proficiency Test levels. 

3 Data 

In our experiments, we use Japanese raw corpora.  We combine Balanced Corpus of Contemporary 
Written Japanese (BCCWJ)1 and Mainichi Newspaper Corpus to estimate word similarity, Japanese 
Language Proficiency Test vocabularies list, a corpus of compositions written by Japanese Elementary 
and Junior High School students (Miyagi, 2015), a corpus of compositions written by Japanese 
Elementary School Children (Sakamoto, 2010), and Bunrui Goi Hyo Database Japanese thesaurus2. 

4 Proposed Method 
4.1 Grouping Similar Words 

The purpose of this task is to find groups of words that have similar meaning.  In our experiment we 
use Bunrui-Goi-Hyo (BGH for short), a Japanese thesaurus. This thesaurus is manually constructed.  It 
comprises about 100K words.  In BGH, all the words are arranged by their meaning.  We extract all 
the groups of words at the bottom level as similar words.  Since the number of words are limited, some 
words do not appear in BGH.  As we mentioned in Section 2, we propose to use dependency-based 
embedding approach (Levy and Goldberg, 2014) to improve the grouping of words especially for 
those words that do not appear in BGH.  

4.2 Level of Word Complexity  

The purpose of this task is to predict the complexity level of words based on Japanese Language 
Proficiency Test (JLPT) level (Hmeljak. 2009).  JLPT is the standard test of Japanese for foreign 
learners and classifies words into five levels:  N1 is the most advanced level, N2 is the high level, N3 
is the intermediate level, N4 is the lower level, N5 is the beginner level.  In the JLPT list, there are 
approximately 800 N5 level words, 1,500 N2 level words, 3,750 N3 level words, 6,000 N2 level 
words, and 10,000 N1 level words. 

Vocabulary lists always have limited coverage of lexical entries.  To cope with this limitation, we 
use a machine-learning approach to predict the complexity levels of words that are not included in the 
JLPT vocabulary list.  We choose a linear regression model in this task. We examined several features 
for the linear regression model to predict the JLPT level of a given word.  The features we use are: 

1. Unigram frequency: Most of research in simplification uses frequency of words to determine 
the complexity of words. Sentences that are simple to understand mostly use high frequency 
words or well-known words (Kauchack et al., 2014; Glavasˇand Stajner, 2015). 

2. Words in children’s corpora: Children basically use simple words, kanjis, and expressions.  
Words used by children are considered as easy words. 

3. Technical Words: Technical words are in many cases complex words and commonly used in 
specific domains.  To measure specificity, we use Jensen–Shannon divergence of words over 
domains.  The frequency distribution of a target word over domains is compared with the

average distribution of all words over domains.  Those words that have low scores have similar 
distributions over domains, meaning they appear various domains and are considered as general 
words.  In contrast, those that have high scores are considered as technical and complex words 
because they tend to appear in specific domains.

𝟐  
In this formula of Jensen-Shannon divergence, P is the normalized frequency distribution of 
target word over all domains and Q is averaged normalized distribution of all words in the 
corpus.  We used the genres defined in the BCCWJ corpus as different domains. 

All these features can be the measurement of word complexity levels and we use them in our linear 
regression model. 

5 Experiment 
We divide our experiment into four steps. We start with pre-experiment, words similarity, complex 

words identification, and word replacement. 

5.1 Pre-Experiment 
This section describes preparation of the data.  We use the Japanese morphological analyser MeCab 

to word segmentation and POS tagging of Mainichi Newspaper, BCCWJ, and the children’s corpora. 
Since some words do not need to be the target of simplification, we make rules based on POS tags of 
words.  In the following rules, we changed all words sharing the same POS as one word: 

1. All words with POS ‘記号’ (symbol) such as “、, 。, 「, 」” are changed to ‘Symbol’. 
2. All words with POS ‘数’ (number) such as “十(ten), 四(four), ５” are changed to ‘Number’.  
3. All words with POS ‘人名’ (people name) such as “山田(Yamada) are changed ‘People’. 
4. All words with POS ‘組織’(organization) such as 東芝(Toshiba) are change to ‘Organization’. 
5. All words with POS ‘地域’(Region) such as “奈良(Nara) are change to ‘Place’.  
6. All names of day, month and year such as “月曜日(Monday), ９月(September), 九月

(September), ２０１６年 (2016), ２８平成 (2016)” are change to ‘Date’. 
All of those words are not simplified.  The result of this step is used in other steps.  

5.2 Words Similarity  
Using the BCCWJ and Mainishi corpora, we calculate the similarity of words by using the 

available tools of dependency-based word embeddings (Levy and Goldberg, 2014).  We prepare the 
training data using Japanese dependency parser CaboCha for finding the dependency relation of words 
in sentences.  Then we calculate the similarity of words as we showed in Section 4.1.  This task is to 
augment the groups of similar words that do not appear in BGH.  The following is an example of 
grouped words by the dependency-based word embedding: {処分, 認定, 申請, 給付, 承認, 決議, 届
出, 登記, 規制, 譲渡} 

5.3 Word Complexity Order 
We counted all unigram frequency of words in Children’s corpus, and combination of BCCWJ-

Mainichi Newspaper.  Then we divided the BCCWJ and Mainichi corpora into 19 categories.  Then 
we calculate the frequency of each word in each category to know the distribution of the word over the 
categories.  Based on the distribution of words over the categories, we calculated the Jensen-Shannon 
divergence values of words. This task is to know the technicality of words. 

About 10,000 words in the JLPT vocabulary list are already divided into 5 levels.  For each word in 
JLPT level, we calculated its log frequency in the BCCWJ-Mainichi corpus, log frequency in the 
children’s corpus, and J-S divergence value, and use them for the features of linear regression. 

After training, we apply the regression function to the other words that are not in the JLPT list to 
predict their complexity levels.  Since the level of the easiest words is 5 and that of the most complex 
words is 1, higher values on test data indicate easier and lower value indicate more complex words.

5.4 Word Replacement 
We already have groups of similar words (Section 5.2) and complexity ordering of words (Section 

5.3).  In this section, we combine these results.  In order to replace a complexity word with a simpler 
synonym, we first start an experiment with words of POS 名詞 (Noun) tag.  

When we input a sentence, first thing to do is morphological analysis of the sentence using MeCab, 
then select all words with POS 名詞 (Noun).  For each selected word, we check it in the same group of 
similar words and compare the complexity of the selected word with other candidates, then choose the 
one with the highest complexity value.  Table 1 shows the result of replacement of complex words 
with simpler synonyms so as to make it more readable for foreigners.  From Table 1, we see that ‘人情
本’(Novel) is a complex word that has similar meaning with 小説 (Novel).  While 人情本 has mean-
ing of old novels that were written in the Edo era, learners do not need to know that kind of words, the 
important information is that that word means a kind of novels.

Table 1 :  Result of word replacement 

6 Evaluation 
We evaluate word complexity orders provided by the trained liner regression model.  We use 

another JLPT data collected from JLPT books, summing up to 20,000 words.  We divide this data into 
training and test data.  Then we test how the complexity levels of pairwise test words are correctly 
predicted.  We experimented the comparison as shown in Table 2.  From the table, we can see that in 
one different level, the average of accuracy is about 61.89%, that in two different levels is 72.13%, 
that in three different levels is 79.8%, and that in four different levels is 87%. We did not do the eval-
uation of group of similarity in BGH since it is a thesaurus constructed by human.

7 Conclusion and Future Work 
We proposed an approach for Japanese lexical simplification.  Our main task is divided into two 

parts.  The first is word similarity estimation and the second is word complexity ordering.  We used 
combination of several Japanese corpora to implement word embedding and linear regression models.  
Our experiments showed the order of word complexity is usable to select simpler similar words.  
Because of limited space, we did not discuss problems caused by lexical replacement.  The last row in 
Table 1 shows a problem caused by word replacement from “尊名” to “名前”.  The prefix existing in 
the original sentence “ご” fits with the former word but not with the latter word.  This type of problem 
caused by word combination is one of the important problem to be tackled by our future work.
