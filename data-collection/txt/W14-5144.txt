Abstract 
 
Machine transliteration is an emerging and a very 
important research area in the field of machine 
translation. While the translation system finds the 
same meaning word/sentence in another language, the 
transliteration helps us to pronounce them. This paper 
describes the process of transliteration from English 
to Punjabi language using a rule based approach. Both 
source grapheme and phonetic information of words 
have been considered for rule formation to achieve 
high performance and more accurate result. Phonetic 
information proved vital for correct transliteration as 
well as for ambiguous words. The system is tested on 
news domain text of more than 10,000 words and 
achieved accuracy of 95%.  

Keywords 
Machine translation, transliteration, natural 
language processing, transliteration rules. 

1 Introduction 

Transliteration is the conversion of a text from 
one script to another. It is the process of 
representing words from one language using the 
approximate phonetic or spelling equivalents of 
another language. Machine translation (MT) is 
the process that takes a message in a source 
language and transforms it into a target language, 
keeping the exact meaning. Transliteration is 
meant to preserve the sounds of the syllables in 
words. This paper presents the development of 
English to Punjabi transliteration system that can 
transliterate English text into equivalent Punjabi 
text. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as 
follows. Section 2 describes the related work 
done in machine transliteration. We have 
described basic character to character mapping 
and rules for transliteration in section 3. 
Performance evaluation is discussed in section 4. 
Finally, we have concluded it in section 5. 

2 Related Work 

Significant work in the field of machine 
transliteration has been done for Indian as well as 
for foreign languages. Three approaches for 
transliteration being used are: Grapheme based 
models; Phoneme based models and Hybrid 
models. Knight and Graehl (1998) have 
developed a phoneme based statistical model 
using finite state transducer that implements 
transformation rules to do backward 
transliteration. They have proposed method for 
automatic backward transliteration that can be 
used for transliteration of words from Japanese 
back to English. Oh and Choi (2002) have 
proposed English to Korean transliteration 
system using pronunciation and contextual rules. 
They have used phonetic information such as 
phoneme and its context as well as orthography. 
Malik (2006) has developed Punjabi Machine 
Transliteration System that is used to 
transliterate words from Shahmukhi script to 
Gurmukhi script using transliteration rules. Saini 
and Lehal (2008) have proposed a corpus based 
transliteration system for Shahmukhi script to 
Punjabi language. The transliteration system has 
been tested on a small set of poetry, article and 
story. The average transliteration accuracy of 
91.37% has been claimed. Goyal and Lehal 
(2009) have proposed system in which Hindi 
words are transliterated into Punjabi words. They 
have implemented complex rules for accurate 
transliteration between Hindi-Punjabi language 
pair. Josan and Lehal (2010) have presented a 
novel approach to improve Punjabi to Hindi 
transliteration by combining a basic character to 
character mapping approach with rule based and 
Soundex based enhancements. Quite a 
reasonable improvement can be achieved by 
small amount of dependency or contextual rules.

Kaur and Josan (2011) have proposed a system 
that addresses the issue of statistical machine 
transliteration from English to Punjabi using 
MOSES that is a statistical machine 
transliteration tool. After applying transliteration 
rules average accuracy of this transliteration 
system comes out to be 63.31%. Deep and Goyal 
(2011) have proposed a transliteration system 
that addresses the problem of forward 
transliteration of person names from Punjabi to 
English by set of character mapping rules. The 
proposed technique achieved accuracy of 
93.22%. Josan and Kaur (2011) have developed 
a statistical model that is used for transliterating 
the Punjabi text into Hindi text. The proposed 
system has claimed 87.72% accuracy rate.  
Dhore et al. (2012) have focused on the specific 
problem of machine transliteration of Hindi to 
English and Marathi to English which are 
previously less studied language pairs using a 
phonetic based direct approach. Bhalla et al. 
(2013) have proposed rule based transliteration 
scheme for English to Punjabi. Some rules have 
constructed for syllabification. In this 
probabilities are calculated for name entities 
(proper names and location). The proposed 
approach has attained accuracy of 88.19%. Joshi 
et al. (2013) have proposed system that can do 
transliteration from Roman script to Devanagari 
script using statistical machine learning 
approach.  

3 Design and Implementation 

3.1 Approach Followed 

The proposed system for English to Punjabi 
transliteration follows rule based approach. A 
machine transliteration model should reflect the 
dynamic transliteration behaviors in order to 
produce the correct transliterations thus we have 
considered both source grapheme and phonetic 
information to achieve high performance and 
more accurate result. The input text goes through 
various stages, as shown in Figure 1, in order to 
get transliterated into equivalent Punjabi text. 
Preprocessing module identifies language based 
on Unicode of the words. Segmentation module 
involves segmentation of source string into 
transliteration units of source language. 
Transliteration module transliterates English text 
to equivalent Punjabi text based on the rules 
framed. Surrounding characters in a given word 
are also considered for resolving ambiguities and 
for more appropriate result.

3.2 English-Punjabi Transliteration Rules 

Due to the differences in syntax and vocabulary 
of both English and Punjabi language, there is 
need to construct some hard rules. These rules 
are explained and illustrated in the following 
subsections. 

3.2.1 English-Punjabi Character to Character

Direct character to character mapping of 
consonants and vowels for English-Punjabi

Table 3. Dependent Vowels Mapping 

3.2.2 First Vowel Character in Word 

Only direct mapping is not sufficient for 
transliteration, which may lead to very low 
accuracy of the system. The vowels in English 
are mapped to different characters in Punjabi 
depending on their position in the given word. 
Following rules are proposed for vowels when 
they occur at first position in the word: 
Rule 1: if first character ‘a’ is followed by 

consonant then it is transliterated to ‘ਅ’. 
For example, amanਅਮਨ 

Rule 2: if ‘an’ combination is at first position 
then it is transliterated to ‘ਅੰ’. For 
example, ankitਅੰਿਕਤ                          

Rule 3: if ‘ea’ combination is at first position 
then it is transliterated to ‘ਈ’. For 
example, eagleਈਗਲ 

Rule 4: if ‘ei’ combination is at first position 
then it is transliterated to ‘ਏ’. For 
example, eightਏਟ 

Rule 5: if ‘in’ combination is at first position 
then it is transliterated to ‘ਇੰ’. For example, 
indiaਇੰਡੀਆ 

Rule 6: if ‘oi’ combination is at first position 
then it is transliterated to ‘ਓ’+‘ਇ’. For 
example, oilਓਇਲ 

Rule 7: if first character ‘u’ is followed by 
‘double consonant’ then ‘u’ is 
transliterated to ‘ਉ’+‘◌’ੱ. For example, 
utter ਤਰ                 

3.2.3 Last Vowel Character in Word 

Vowels are mapped to different characters when 
they occur at last position. In order to achieve 
more accurate result there is need to refer to 

previous characters because their pronunciation 
is also affected by the consonants or vowels, they 
follow. The following rules are proposed to 
handle last vowel character in a word: 

Rule 1: if ‘ia’ combination occurs at last then ‘a’ 
is transliterated to ‘ਆ’. For example, 
soniaਸੋਨੀਆ 

Rule 2: if last character ‘a’ is preceded by 
consonant then ‘a’ is transliterated to ‘◌ਾ’. 
For example, samralaਸਮਰਾਲਾ 

Rule 3: if ‘nu’ combination occurs at last then ‘u’ 
is transliterated to ‘◌’ੰ + ‘◌’ੂ. For example, 
sonuਸੋਨੰੂ 

Rule 4: if ‘oa’ combination occurs at last then it 
is transliterated to ‘◌’ੋ+ ‘ਆ’. For example, 
goaਗੋਆ 

Rule 5: if last character is ‘e’ and second last 
character is ‘i’ then ‘e’ is usually skipped 
in that case. For example, likeਲਾਈਕ     

3.2.4 CVCC Pattern (Double Consonants) 
In phonetics, gemination or consonant elongation 
happens when a spoken consonant is pronounced 
for an audibly longer period of time than a short 
consonant. In transliteration, double consonants 
in English are mapped with Punjabi gemination 
symbol ‘Addak’. The two geminates ‘mm’ and 
‘nn’ are written with ‘Tippi’ in many cases 
because they represent nasalized sound (Gill and 
Gleason, 1986). Proposed rules for gemination 
are described in Table 4.

Table 4. Rules for Gemination 

3.2.5 CVVC Pattern (Long Vowels) 
When two vowels are adjacent, they form a 
vowel combination. There are two vowels 
between consonants that create either one or two 
sounds. For example, word ‘hair’ and ‘poor’ 

317



 

 

creates two sounds and word ‘four’ creates one 
sound. Table 5 shows mapping of various vowel 
combinations. 
‘a’ Vowel Combinations  
(aa,  ae, ai, ao, au) 
‘ao’  ‘◌ਾ’ + ‘ਓ’   
(Sarao  ਸਰਾਓ ) 
‘aun’   ‘◌’ੌ + ‘◌’ਂ  
(Launch  ਲਚ ) 
‘au’  ‘◌’ੌ  
(Author  ਔਥਰ ) 
‘aa’  ‘◌ਾ’

Table 5. Rules for CVVC Pattern 

3.2.6 Silent Letters 
A silent letter is a letter that, in a particular word, 
does not correspond to any sound in the word’s 
pronunciation. Some rules have been constructed 
for the most common silent letters- ck, wr, kn, 
mn, mb, mp, dg, gh, wh etc. Following are some 
English words examples with silent letters and 
their corresponding transliteration in Punjabi: 
Trickਟਿਰੱਕ, wholeਹੋਲ, writeਰਾਈਟ, 
knowਨ, columnਕੋਲਮ, companyਕੰਪਨੀ etc. 

3.2.7 CVCe Pattern 

There are somewhat different rules for syllables 
with CVCe pattern. An ‘e’ is found at the end of 
the word. These words are transliterated 
according to the matching rules, as shown in 
Table 6.

Table 6. Rules for CVCe Pattern 

3.2.8 Ambiguity Resolution 
There are certain characters in English those 
correspond to more than one pronunciation. For 
example, the word ‘s’ can be pronounced as ‘ਸ’ 
or ‘ਜ’ as in case of ‘house’ or ‘resume’. Other 
ambiguous word is ‘g’. In order to resolve this 
problem following rules have been proposed: 

Rule 1: if ‘g’ is followed by ‘en’/‘in’/‘ic’/‘im’ 
then ‘g’ is transliterated to ‘ਜ’. For 
example, general/ margin/ logicਜਨਰਲ/ 
ਮਾਰਜਨ/ ਲੋਿਜਕ 

Rule 2: if there is ‘ange’/‘enge’ combination then 
‘g’ is transliterated to ‘ਜ਼’. For example, 
orange/challengeਓਰਜ਼/ਚੈਲਜ਼ 

318



 

 

Rule 3: if ‘g’ is preceded by ‘a’/‘d’ and followed 
by ‘e’ then ‘g’ is transliterated to ‘ਜ’. For 
example, page/bridgeਪੇਜ/ਬਿਰੱਜ 

Rule 4: if ‘s’ is preceded by ‘ou’/‘a’ and 
followed by ‘e’ then ‘s’ is transliterated 
to ‘ਸ’. For example, 
mouse/baseਮਾਊਸ/ਬੇਸ 

Rule 5: otherwise if ‘s’ is followed and preceded 
by vowel then it is transliterated to ‘ਜ਼’.  
For example, visit/seasonਿਵਜ਼ੀਟ/ਸੀਜ਼ਨ 

3.2.9 CVC Pattern (Short Vowels) 
A short vowel word is any word that does not 
allow the vowel within it to generate that 
vowel’s long vowel sound. Table 7 shows 
proposed rules for short vowels.

‘o’ dog, stop ‘◌’ੋ ਡੋਗ, ਸਟੋਪ 
‘u’ cut, bus ‘◌ ੱ’ ਕੱਟ, ਬੱਸ 

Table 7. Rules for Short Vowels  

3.2.10 Unreduced Vowel (Schwa + Consonant) 

English language has certain words with 
unstressed syllables that are often pronounced 
with full vowels like careਕੇਅਰ, fireਫਾਇਰ, 
clearਕਲੀਅਰ, affairਅੱਫੇਅਰ, realਰੀਅਲ etc. 

3.2.11 Schwa Reduction 
The main problem in machine transliteration 
system is mainly due to the existence of schwa 
vowel that is sometimes considered and 
sometimes not. Figure 2 illustrates the schwa 
sound deletion and retention process in general. 

S    A    M    R    A    L    A    ਸਮਰਾਲਾ 
 
 

       
Schwa to be deleted      Schwa to be retained 

Figure 2. Process of Schwa Deletion 

To find out when to retain schwa sound is not a 
trivial task. Some rules have been constructed to 
handle schwa sound: 

Rule 1: if 3rd_last_char and last_char is ‘a’ then 
both are transliterated to ‘◌ਾ’. For example, 
batala/samralaਬਟਾਲਾ/ ਸਮਰਾਲਾ 

Rule 2: if 2nd_last_char is ‘a’ and 4th_last_char is 
vowel then skip ‘a’. For example, 
sonamਸੋਨਮ 

Rule 3: if ‘a’ is followed by ‘rt’/ ‘ph’/ ‘th’/ ‘rk’/ 
‘sk’/ ‘st’ then it is transliterated to ‘◌ਾ’. 
For example, part/ graph/ dark/ flask/ 
lastਪਾਰਟ/ਗਰਾਫ/ਡਾਰਕ/ਫਲਾਸਕ/ਲਾਸਟ 

Rule 4: if ‘a’ is followed and preceded by same 
consonant then ‘a’ is transliterated to 
‘◌ਾ’. For example, brarਬਰਾੜ   

4 Performance Evaluation 

The evaluation of machine transliteration system 
can be found using Word Accuracy Rate that is 
used to capture the performance at word level. 
The word accuracy rate of proposed system is 
found to be 95% as shown in Table 8.  

Language Transliteration Units Accuracy

We have manually evaluated the proposed 
transliteration system on news data published on 
a web site and the output is shown in Table 9.

5 Conclusion and Future Scope 

In this paper we have described transliteration 
system for English-Punjabi language pair using a 
rule based approach. There are certain syllable 
patters in English such as CVC, CVVC, CVCC, 
CVCe etc. Only a single rule is not applicable to 
all these patterns so different rules have been 
proposed for the transliteration of such syllable 
patterns. Also various rules have been proposed 
to handle ambiguous words, unstressed vowels 
and schwa sound. The proposed system is also 
applicable for transliteration of some person 
names and locations.  
The existing work done in English to Punjabi 
transliteration emphasis on transliteration of 
named entities. In our work we have considered 
all possible English words for transliteration. 
Still schwa sound deletion and multiple 
representation of same word need to be more 
explored. There are many English words that are 
spelled the same but pronounced differently. To 
resolve this issue, the future work can be based 
on referring to the context of the words in order 

to choose correct transliteration. We can say that 
accuracy of proposed system is depends on the 
rules framed so it can be furthered improved by 
adding new rules when identified.
