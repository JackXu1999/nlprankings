Abstract 

In December 2011/January 2012 we have 

released the main deliverable of the project 

"PolNet - Polish WordNet". It was first 

presented and distributed (as PolNet 1.0) at the 

5th Language and Technology Conference in 

Poznań (2011) and (informally, with kind 

permission of the organizers) distributed 

during the Global Wordnet Conference in 

Matsue, Japan, in January 2012. We intend to 

present to the participants of the GWC 2014 

the characteristics of the new, extended release 

of PolNet. 

1 Introduction 

In 1985 G. Miller with collaborators at the 

Princeton University initiated a novel method of 

systematizing semantic grammatical knowledge 

on the basis of the concepts of synonymy and 

hyperonymy. He proposed to organize a lexicon 

in the form of a lexical database (WordNet): a 

hierarchical network of a set of synonyms. The 

project appeared to be generic and inspired many 

followers working for various languages. Its 

practical value was recognized by language 

industries and practical computer science. In 

particular, lexical bases similar to Princeton 

WordNet (PWN) were used as ontologies useful 

in the AI oriented research. 

2 Lexicon-grammar, VerbNet, 
FrameNet 

The initial WordNet was organized as a set of 

equivalence classes with respect to the synonymy 

relation. For these classes, called synsets, other 

relations were considered, like hypernymy, 

meronymy, holonymy etc. Within the initial 

approach focusing on the meaning of words, only 

root forms of words were stored with no 

morphological or morphosyntactical information. 

Bringing this kind of information to wordnet is 

an idea which has as its forerunner the lexicon-

grammar approach developed since the early 

1970s (until late 1990s) by Maurice Gross 

(Gross, 1994) inspired by the works of Zellig S. 

Harris. Gross considered elementary sentence as 

a “minimal unit of sense” and the sense of a 

word as determined by the minimal sentences 

containing this word. This led to the concept of 

syntactic lexicon where grammatical information 

(syntactic) is contained in the lexical entries (in 

form of syntactic and semantic requirements 

/valences/ of predicative words). At about the 

same period  (1980-1992), the similar ideas of 

Polański led to the monumental description of 

Polish verbs ("Syntactic-generative Dictionary of 

Polish Verbs" (Polański, 1992)). These works 

preceded (and perhaps even inspired) the future 

works in the FrameNet (Fillmore et al., 2002) 

and VerbNet (Palmer, 2009) projects which ware 

natural extensions of the initial WordNet. 

Independently from Polański, but following the 

same lines and applying refined Levis’ verb 

classes, Martha Palmers from the University of 

Colorado Boulder defined a lexical database 

where verbs were grouped according shared 

meaning and similar syntactic behavior (Palmer 

et al., 2005). These verb classes are “completely 

described by thematic roles, selectional 

restrictions on the arguments, and frames 

consisting of a syntactic description and semantic 

predicates with a temporal function”. VerbNet is 

sometimes compared to FrameNet, a kind of 

dictionary of word senses with annotated 

examples that show the meaning and usage. This 

project was initiated By Charles J. Fillmore in 

Berkeley (1997) and based on its concepts of 

frame semantics and semantic roles. Both 

VerbNet and FrameNet were applied in Artificial 

Intelligence (AI) projects concerning semantic

3  “PolNet - Polish WordNet” project  

The project “PolNet - Polish WordNet” started in 

2006. It was conceived in order to fill the 

technological gap consisting in the lack of a 

digital lexical database for the Polish.
1
 The 

development algorithm (Vetulani et al., 2007) 

was based on several traditional dictionaries of 

the Polish language (in particular (Szymczak, 

1978) and (Dubisz 2006)) and a general wordnet 

development tool which was the DEBVisDic 

platform (Pala et al, 2007). 

The methodology we have applied to the 

development of PolNet followed the so called 

"merge model". PolNet was built from scratch 

involving intensive and large scale manual 

lexicographers' work. At the early stage of 

development we decided to abstain from any 

automatic synset generation and to reuse the 

existing knowledge about Polish accumulated by 

the past generations of linguists and 

lexicographers in lexicons, dictionaries and 

grammars. 

The team - formed of computer scientists and 

lexicographers familiar with computer 

technologies explored first of all traditional 

resources (dictionaries). This work was inspired 

by and benefited from the methodology and tools 

of the EuroWordNet and Balkanet projects. In 

particular, production of synsets was supported 

by the VisDic and DEBVisDic systems 

generously made accessible for PolNet 

development by Karel Pala from the Masaryk 

University in Brno (Czech Rep.). PolNet 1.0 was 

made public available in November 2011. This 

first completed distribution was reduced to nouns 

and simple verbs (Vetulani and Obrębski, 2010). 

The PolNet 1.0 release consisted of nominal 

and verbal synsets. Both the nominal and verbal 

parts were set up on the basis of frequency 

observed in the corpus (the IPI PAN corpus was 

used; cf. (Przepiórkowski, 2004)). The only 

systematic exception from this rule was made in 

order to be able to test PolNet in a real-scale 

application. This was the POLINT-112-SMS 

system, an application in the field of public 

security and PolNet, in which the latter one 

served as the ontology. It appeared necessary to

Polish  (plWordNet) developed by Piasecki and others 

within a totally different methodology whose conception is 

based on automatic acquisition of synsets and relations. 

extend the lexical coverage in the way to make 

PolNet complete with respect to the a priori 

chosen domain of public security at football 

stadiums. In the present development we 

continue on the ground of the frequent-concepts-

first rule. 

The noun part of the PolNet 1.0 consisted of 

the noun synsets partially ordered by the 

hyponymy/hyperonymy relation and the verb 

part was organized by the predicate-argument 

relationship connecting the verb synsets with the 

noun synsets. In the present extension (from 

PolNet 1.0 to PolNet 2.0) we will continue to 

apply this organization. 

The main statistics of the PolNet 1.0 were as 

follows: 

 Nouns: 11,700 synsets (12,000 nouns, 

20,300 word+meaning pairs) 

 Verbs: 1,500 synsets (900 verbs, 2,900 

word+meaning pairs) 

4 Extension motivations, reasons and 
policy 

Although the usefulness of PolNet 1.0 as lexical 

ontology was confirmed through practical 

applications, we concluded the necessity of 

further extensions and improvements. The most 

fundamental decision was to consider as priority 

the development of the verbal component, before 

enlargement ad infinitum of the noun part. This 

decision was motivated by the practical needs of 

high quality, linguistically sound  tools for 

advanced NLP, including text understanding, 

useful in Question Answering (QA), Machine 

Translation (MT) and other AI applications 

involving language competence modeling. We 

consider the extension to PolNet 2.0 described 

here as an important step towards a lexicon-

grammar of Polish directly useful in systems 

development. 

5 From PolNet 1.0 to PolNet 2.0 

The present stage of the “PolNet - Polish 

WordNet” project  consists of development from 

PolNet 1.0 to PolNet 2.0. The main task of this 

stage is to extend substantially the verbal 

component with the inclusion of concepts 

(synsets) represented (in many cases uniquely) 

by compound construction in form of verb-noun 

collocations (by verb-noun collocations we mean 

compound verbal structures made of a support 

verb and a predicative noun). This extension 

brought (until now) to PolNet some 1200 new 



verb synsets corresponding to 600 predicative 

nouns, some of those synsets being closely 

related to the already existing verb synsets of the 

PolNet 1.0. 

The verb-noun collocation imported to PolNet 

come from the "Syntactic dictionary of verb-

noun collocations in Polish" compiled by 

Grażyna Vetulani (Vetulani, G. 2000 and 2012).

See the Example 1 in Table 1 below. 

 
 

Example 1. A fragment of the entry 

describing the predicative noun "pomoc" 

(compiled from a traditional dictionary): 
 

pomoc, f/ [help] 

udzielać(Gen)/N1(Dat), 

"udzielać komuś pomocy" [to help](imperfective) 

udzielić(Gen)/N1(Dat), 

"udzielić komuś pomocy" [to help](perfective) 

pospieszyć na(Acc)/N1(Dat) 

"pospieszyć komuś na pomoc" 

pospieszyć z(Instr)/N1(Dat) 

"pospieszyć z pomocą ofierze wypadku"  

[to help a victim] 

przyjść z(Instr)/N1(Dat) 

"przyjść z pomocą choremu"  

[to help sb who is ill] 

przyjść na(Acc)/N1(Dat) 

"przyjść na pomoc oblężonemu miastu"  

[to bring help to a surrounded town] 

 

 (N1(Dat) – complement in the dative case) 

 

 

Table 1. Dictionary of verb-noun collocations 

(fragment) 

 

Adding collocations to PolNet was not trivial 

because of specific syntactic phenomena related 

with collocations in Polish (systematic, although 

not general, change of syntactic requirements 

between the compound verb (verb-noun 

collocation) and its one-word synonym is 

required).  

In PolNet, as in other wordnets, lexical units 

are grouped into synsets on the basis of the 

relation of synonymy. In opposition to nouns, 

where the interest is mainly in the hierarchical 

relations (hyperonymy/hyponymy) between 

concepts (represented by synsets) - for verbs the 

main interest is in relating verbal synsets 

(representing predicative concepts) to noun 

synsets (representing general concepts) in order

until now but this work is in progress. 

to show what are the semantic connectivity 

constraints corresponding to the particular 

argument positions. Inclusion of this information 

(combined with morphosyntactic constraints) 

gives PolNet the status of a lexicon grammar. 

This approach imposes granularity restrictions on 

verbal synsets and more exactly on the 

synonymy relation.  

Synonymous are solely such verb+meaning 

pairs in which the same semantic roles take as 

value the same concepts (this condition is 

necessary but not sufficient). In particular, the 

valency structure of a verb is one of the formal 

indices of the meaning (it is so that all members 

of a given sysnset share the valency structure). 

This permits to formal encoding of valency 

structure as a property of a synset.  

Semantic roles as relations connecting noun 

synsets to verb synsets allow the extended 

PolNet to be considered as a situational 

semantics network of concepts.  

Indeed, as it is often admitted, verb synsets 

may be considered as representing situations 

(events, states), whereas semantic roles (Agent, 

Patient, Beneficent,...) provide information on 

the ontological nature of various actors 

participating, actively or passively, in this 

situation (event, state). Abstract roles (Manner, 

Time,...) refer to concepts which position the 

situation (event, state) in time, space and 

possibly also with respect to some abstract, 

qualitative landmarks.  

Formally, the semantic roles are functions (in 

mathematical sense) associated to the argument 

positions in the syntactic pattern(s) 

corresponding to synsets. The values of these 

functions are ontology concepts (here in form of 

noun synsets). For many verbs, the semantic role 

BENEFICENT takes as its value the concept 

representing the set of all humans (which are 

then considered as potential addresses of the 

situation effects).  

In the project we use a well described set of 

semantic roles, adapted from works of Fillmore 

and later of Palmer (Fillmore  1977, Palmer 

2009). 

In the Example 2 in Table 2 below we may 

observe several inter-synsets relations which are 

used to express semantic requirements of the 

predicate (verb).  

For example the “Semantic_role: [Action]” 

which connects the noun synset  “{czynność:1}” 

[activity] to the verb synset “{pomóc:1, 

pomagać:1, udzielić pomocy:1, udzielać 

pomocy:1}” [to help].tell us that the verb opens 



an argument which must be filled by a term 

referring to some activity. Similarly, the relation 

“Semantic role [Benef]” indicates what kinds of 

entities may benefit of somebody’s assistance. 

  
 

Example 2. DEBVisDic  presentation of a PolNet  

synset containing both simple verbs and 

collocations(simplified): 
 

POS: v ID: 3441  

 

Synonyms: {pomóc:1, pomagać:1, udzielić 

pomocy:1, udzielać pomocy:1} (to help) 

 

Definition: "wziąć (brać) udział w pracy jakiejś 

osoby (zwykle razem z nią), aby ułatwić jej tę 

pracę" 

("to participate in sb's work in order to help 

him/her") 

 

VALENCY:  

 Agent(N)_Benef(D) 

 Agent(N)_Benef(D) Action('w'+NA(L)) 

 Agent(N)_Benef(D) Manner 

 Agent(N)_Benef(D) Action('w'+NA(L)) Manner 
 

Usage: Agent(N)_Benef(D); "Pomogłam jej." (I 

helped her) 

Usage: Agent(N)_Benef(D) Action('w'+NA(L)); 

"Pomogłam jej w robieniu lekcji." (I helped her 

in doing homework) 

Usage: Agent(N)_Benef(D) Manner 

Action('w'+NA(L));  

"Chętnie udzieliłąm jej pomocy w lekcjach." (I 

helped her willingly doing her homework) 

Usage: Agent(N)_Benef(D) Manner; 

"Chętnie jej pomagałam." (I used to help her 

willingly)

jednostka:1, łepek:3, łebek:3, łeb:5, głowa:8, 

osoba:1, twarz:2, umysł:2, dusza:3} 

({man:1,...,animal:2,...}) 

Semantic_role:  [Benef] {człek:1, człowiek:1, homo

6 Problems  

 

In the case of Polish, our decision to make 

wordnet a type of lexicon-grammar through the 

inclusion of possibly all relevant grammatical 

information, appeared to be challenging in case 

of verb-noun collocations. This is because the 

traditional relation of synonymy is not invariant 

with respect to the syntactic requirements of 

predicative words. For example the simple word 

"nakarmić" and its synonym in form of the 

collocation "dać jeść" both correspond to the 

English "to feed". At the same time they do not 

have the same syntactic requirements, as 

"nakarmić" requires a complement in the 

accusative, whereas "dać jeść" - in the dative. 

Therefore, they should be put into different 

synsets of PolNet. This is because the synset of 

PolNet are intended to contain complete 

syntactic and semantic information about words, 

the same for all synset members.  

In PolNet 2.0 we have applied the solution, 

which seems optimal from the practical 

(language engineering)  point of view - to store 

them in separate synsets related by the 

transformational relation OBJECT_TRANS 

(ACC,DAT) which describes the difference of 

their syntactic properties. 

 

7 Further research plans  

 

“PolNet - Polish WordNet” project is in progress, 

and it will continue to be for the foreseeable 

future. The total number of verb-noun 

collocations is estimated to be largely more than 

20 000 items. The set of 14,341 described until 

now was considered in order to select the most 

frequently used in texts and to include them in 

the first step of enlargement. We intend to 

continue this extension at least through 2014. In 

parallel to our present main priority, we continue 

work on further steps of the PolNet project in 

particular its alignment to the upper ontology 

SUMO, as well as on the extension of the net to 

more basic terms: nouns, verbs and collocations. 

The long term plan is to transform PolNet into a 

complete lexicon grammar of Polish integrating 

all grammatical information necessary (and 

sufficient) for AI and Language Engineering 

(LE) applications.
