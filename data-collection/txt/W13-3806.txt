Mona Diab
George Washington University, USA

Similarity is at the core of scientific inquiry in general and is one of the basic functionalities in Natural
Language Processing (NLP) in particular. To arrive at generalizations across different phenomena, we need
to recognize patterns of similarity, or divergence, to make scientific claims. Semantic textual similarity plays
a significant role in NLP research both directly and indirectly. For example, for document summarization,
we need to compress redundant information which requires identifying where the text is similar; for question
answering, we need to recognize the similarity between the questions and the answers; textual similarity is
an important component of an entailment system; evaluating machine translation (MT) output relies on cal-
culating the similarity between the systemâ€™s output and some reference gold translations; textual generation
technology benefits from sentence similarity by generating different expressions. In this talk, I will address
the problem of textual semantic similarity. We have run 2 major tasks of STS over the span of two years
within the context of Semeval in 2012 and *SEM shared task in 2013. The task to date is one of the most
successful to be carried out within our community by virtue of being quite popular. I will share with you the
details of the task, some interesting insights into the scientific merits of this enterprise and lessons learned.
Finally I will share some thoughts on the future.
