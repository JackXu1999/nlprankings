Abstract 

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to 
sentiment polarity classification of citations, 
which integrates data about the authors’ repu-
tation. More specifically, our method extends 
the h-index with citation polarities and utilizes 
it in sentiment classification of citation sen-
tences. Our computational results show that 
our method yields significant improvement in 
terms of classification performance.   

1 Introduction 

1.1 Background 
Citation count between scientific publications have 
been the primary metric to measure importance and 
impact of articles or authors for decades. The ad-
vantage is simplicity and effectiveness. However, 
with the progress of machine learning, NLP and 
other disciplines, researchers developed various 
techniques to improve the quality of citation analy-
sis and hence the quality of scholarly importance 
measurement. One of the efforts was to apply Pag-
eRank in citation network, which introduces weight 
on citation links for more accurate measurement 
(Ding, 2011). Although, this type of weighting is 
widely criticized (Alvarez and Soriano, 2014). Re-
cent bibliometric studies showed that “there is no 
bad publicity in science”, because criticized and 
controversial papers tend to be highly cited too (Ra-
dicch, 2012; Perc, 2014). Consequently, these con-
troversial papers are positively estimated according 
to citation-count-based metrics, for example, impact 
factor and h-index. As Bonzi (1982) argued that if a 
cited work is criticized, it should consequently carry 

lower or even negative weight for bibliometric 
measures (Athar and Teufel, 2011).  

1.2 Our contribution 
Sentiment analysis of citation sentence makes this 
kind of fine-grained bibliometric measures possible. 
Augmented with polarized citation links, the cita-
tion network can be weighted more accurately by 
using negative weights. We introduce the p-index, 
which is the h-index extended by citation polarities.  

Our assumption is that papers from prominent re-
searchers are more probable to be cited in a positive 
manner than the papers from controversial research-
ers. Generally, if we know more about a researcher, 
it should be easier to determine the polarity of cita-
tions his/her paper receives. Our research question 
is whether or not the performance of citation senti-
ment analysis can be improved with better author 
modelling, in particular modeling with citation po-
larity.  

In this paper, we report our on-going work on the 
citation sentiment analysis task. The rest of the pa-
per is structured as follows: the next section briefly 
reviews some important work in this field. Then we 
introduce our method. In section 4, we present our 
experiment details. Preliminary experiment results 
and discussions about the results are structured in 
section 5 and 6. Finally, we summarize our work 
and discuss possible directions of future work.  

2 Related Work 

Teufel et al. (2006) was one of the pioneers in the 
field of citation classification. She proposed a clas-
sification scheme of 12 citation functions and used 
supervised technique for the classification task.

Athar (2011) continued this thread of research 
and focused in polarity classification of citations. 
They experimented the SVM classifier with rich 
features, such as negation, sentence splitting and de-
pendency features.  Athar (2012) published the Ci-
tation Sentiment Corpus, which contains 8736 an-
notated sentences.  

Jochim (2012) used the following facet scheme 
to describe the nature of a citation: conceptual vs. 
operational; organic vs. perfunctory; evolutionary 
vs. juxtapositional; based on vs. alternative work; 
confirmative vs. negational.  

Dong (2011) performed semi-supervised classifi-
cation over categories: background, fundamental 
idea, technical basis and performance comparison. 
They have also developed the ACL Anthology 
Searchbench, which provides very practical paper 
search functionality with graphical presentation of 
local citation network of searched paper.1  

Abu-jbara et al. (2013) has also contributed to 
this field by working on citation context identifica-
tion, citation purpose classification and citation po-
larity identification. Their method achieved good 
performance by using SVM with linear kernel on a 
rich feature set. 

3 Methodology  

3.1 The Basis: The H-Index 
There are several metrics to measure the impact of 
researchers. H-index (Hirsch, 2005) and g-index 
(Egghe, 2006) are two popular ones. These metrics 
and their variations are all based purely on citation 
counts. The h-index is defined as follows:  

“A scientist has index h if h of his or her Np pa-
pers have at least h citations each and the other (Np 
–  h) papers have ≤h citations each.” (Hirsch, 
2005) 

Mathematically, it can be represented as formula 
(1): 

 ℎ_𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥(𝑓) = max
/
min(𝑓 𝑖 , 𝑖)  (1) 

where f is the function that corresponds to the 
number of citations for each publication, sorted in 
descending order.2 

Obviously, h-index finds a balance point between 
publication amount and the citation count of each

publication. It is however not able to model the dif-
ferent polarities of citations.  

3.2 Our Extension: The P-Index 
In order to embed the polarity information in author 
modelling, we introduce the p-index, where p stands 
for polarity:  

 𝑝_𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥(𝑓) = ℎ_𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥(𝑓) ∙ 𝑝5 ∙ 𝑛6  (2) 

where p is the amount of positive citations the au-
thor receives. and n is the amount of negative cita-
tions, with positive citation coefficient 𝛼 and nega-
tive citation coefficient 𝛽. Since P-index is an indi-
cator positively correlated with an author’s aca-
demic performance and reputation, higher value 
corresponds to better performance and reputation. 
Thus, 𝛼 as an exponential coefficient is defined to 
be greater than 1. Similarly, the negative citation ex-
ponential is defined in the range:	0 < 𝛽 < 1.  

The polarity of citation reflects the opinion of 
peers. The controversial authors that receive a lot of 
negative citations can be distinguished with the p-
index. Thus the p-index combines scholar’s perfor-
mance information measured by h-index and the 
reputation information measured by citation polar-
ity distribution. In general, the author is better mod-
eled with p-index.  

4 Experiment  

4.1 Corpus 
In the experiments, we used the Citation Sentiment 
Corpus (Athar, 2012) with ACL Anthology Net-
work (Abu-jbara et al., 2013). ACL Anthology Net-
work (AAN) is a widely used corpus containing 
computational linguistic publications. It contains 
more than 21,212 papers, 17,792 authors and 
110,975 citation links. The Citation Sentiment Cor-
pus contains 8,736 citation sentences extracted from 
AAN. Theses citation sentences are manually anno-
tated into three classes: positive, negative, objective 
(neutral).  

4.2 Preprocessing 
Basically, we only performed two preprocessing 
steps, which we call text cleaning and citation men-
tion replacement. In the text cleaning step, we solely 
removed erroneous characters and corrected the

spacing. In the citation mention replacement step, 
we use regular expressions to replace the target ci-
tation mention in the sentence with the label “TAR-
GETREF”, and other citation mentions with the la-
bel “REF”, as shown in the following example: 

 

 
Figure 1 An Example of Citation Mention Replacement3 

This way, the machine learning algorithm will be 
able to identify the position of the target reference 
and learn the semantic pattern between the target 
reference and the other tokens of the sentence. 
However, a few citation mentions cannot be auto-
matically recognized. In our experiment, we ignore 
those citation sentences, in which the citation men-
tions cannot be replaced by TARGETREF or REF. 

In order to exclude possible bias, we randomized 
the ordering of the data instances in the Citation 
Sentiment Corpus. 

4.3 Features 
In our experiments, each citation sentence is taken 
as one data instance, along with a set of features. We 
used the following feature set: 

 
• Tf-IDF weighted unigram: straightforward 

feature for text classification tasks 
• Polarity distribution of the target paper: the 

numbers of positive, negative and objective 
citations that the target paper receives. This 
is a kind of polarity modelling on paper 
level. 

• Author ID: the author ID of the target paper 
as provided in AAN. We use the string form 
of author ID 

• Affiliation ID: the author’s affiliation ID of 
the target paper, also string form. To the 
best of our knowledge, our approach is the 
first attempt to utilize affiliation infor-
mation in a citation sentiment analysis task. 

• H-index/ P-index: the author’s h-index or p-
index of the target paper. The original h-in-
dex is provided in AAN and used by us as a 

                                                                                                                
3 In this instance, “A94-1008” is the AAN paper ID of the 
citing paper and “A92-1018” is the ID of the cited paper. 

baseline. P-index is calculated from h-index 
using formula (2) and we use it to improve 
the performance of citation sentiment clas-
sification.  

4.4 Experimental Setup 
In our experimental implementation, we used the 
Python module SciKit-Learn4 for  machine learn-
ing, feature extraction and evaluation. Support Vec-
tor Machine (SVM) is chosen as the classification 
algorithm. SVM is a widely used algorithm for text 
classification (Athar, 2012 and Abu-jbara, 2013).  

Since our main contribution is improving classi-
fication performance using p-index, we mainly fo-
cus on the effects caused by replacing the h-index 
by the p-index. The SVM hyper-parameter is one of 
the settings that stay identical in all experiments. 
Therefore, in our on-going work, we have not 
broadly explored the parameter grid of penalty pa-
rameter C and kernel coefficient 𝛾, which are the 
main parameters of SVM with Radial Basis Func-
tion (RBF) kernel (Hsu et al., 2006).  

In order to answer our research question in sec-
tion 1, we performed the experiment in a compara-
tive manner. Firstly, we partition the corpus into 10 
subsets and prepare 10 pairs of train and test sets. 
Then, for each pair, we perform the following pro-
cedure: 

 
1. Run the classifier with h-index to obtain the 

baseline performance, denoted by F1b in the 
following. 

2. Calculate the p-indices of authors as defined 
in Formula (2). 

3. Update data instances of both train and test 
set: replace h-index value with p-index 

4. Run the classifier on the new train and test 
set. It yields the test result F1t. 

5. Calculate the relative improvement from 
baseline to test result as:  

𝛿 = ?@AB?@C
?@C

   (3) 

“O” is the sentiment annotation, meaning “objective” (neu-
tral).

124



 

 This procedure is applied to all the train and test 
set pairs. Next we calculate the average of all of 
these relative improvement. This is the final result 
of one experiment; it measures the effectiveness of 
our method under one specific setting.  

Since the p-index depends on the positive and 
negative citation coefficients, 𝛼 and 𝛽, the final rel-
ative improvement depends significantly on the 
choice of 𝛼 and 𝛽. Systematic results are presented 
in the following section. 

5 Result 

5.1 Evaluation metric 
In the field of text classification, Macro-F1 is 
widely used to evaluate the performance. It is espe-
cially suitable for our work, because the Citation 
Sentiment Corpus is highly imbalanced. 

We did not compare our results with others. As a 
consequence of different data preparation, algo-
rithm setting and many other detailed factors, it is 
nontrivial to reproduce the results reported in other 
work. 

Moreover, in principle, our work is to examine 
the effectiveness of a novel feature on author level, 
which is independent to the utilization of other fea-
tures on sentence level, etc. (Athar, 2011 and Abu-
jbara et al., 2013). 

5.2 Search the Setting Space  
We performed numerous experiments with various 
settings. The dimensions of setting space are: 

 
• Whether to enable feature: polarity distribu-

tion of the target paper 
• Whether to enable feature: affiliation ID 
• Whether to enable feature: author ID 
• Positive citation coefficient 𝛼 . We have 

sparsely explored the range of 1 < 𝛼 <
100.  

• Negative citation coefficient 𝛽. It has a rel-
atively narrower definition range,	0 < 𝛽 <
1 , which allows us to search more thor-
oughly. 

 
It is a considerably large setting space to explore. 
We treated the first 3 dimensions as a group and the 

last 2 dimensions as another. In this way, we re-
duced the dimensionality of the setting space and 
made the exploration more practical.   

Initially, we fixed the first setting group and 
search for the best values of the second setting 
group. After a coarse search, we found that the best 
settings of exponential coefficients are around the 
point ( 𝛼 = 1.1, 𝛽 = 0.7 ). Then a more intense 
search is performed in a small space surrounding 
this point. The best result achieved so far is at (𝛼 =
1.085, 𝛽 = 0.727).  

Subsequently, we fixed 𝛼 and 𝛽 at these values 
and test the 8 possible combinations of the 3 bool-
ean settings in the first group. The best results are 
obtained with both affiliation ID and author ID fea-
tures enabled.  

Thus we have spotted one local maxima in the 
settings space: {Polarity of Paper Feature: Disabled; 
Affiliation ID Feature: Enabled; Author ID Feature: 
Enabled; 𝛼 = 1.085; 𝛽 = 0.727}. This produces the 
most significant result so far: 11.2% relative im-
provement of Macro-F1 in the citation sentiment 
classification over the baseline: avg. Macro-
F1=0.535. The baseline is obtained with the same 
system using h-index instead of the p-index.  

5.3 Observation 
Table 1 illustrates the relative improvement achieved 
under different feature selections. Each row repre-
sents an experiment. The first three columns indi-
cate which features are enabled in an experiment 
and the last column reveals the relative improve-
ment under this setting. 

The first observation is that the polarity distribu-
tion of a paper (first column in the table) is not a 
helpful feature. When combined with other features, 
it hardly contributes to the system. When used 
alone, it decreases the performance.  

Pol P Af. ID Au. ID Imprv. 

- - - 9.3% 
Enabled - - 2.6% 

- Enabled - 6.2% 
- - Enabled 9.6% 

Enabled Enabled - 6.2% 
Enabled - Enabled 9.6% 

- Enabled Enabled 11.2% 
Enabled Enabled Enabled 11.2% 

 

Table 1: Relative Improvements under different settings 

125



 

In comparison, the affiliation ID is a better fea-
ture. Although it also causes some performance de-
cline when used alone. But when combined with au-
thor ID, it makes positive contribution. 

The best feature among these three is the author 
ID. The presence of author ID always boosts the 
performance of the system.  

It is also worth mentioning that under this pair of 
exponential coefficients, all these possible feature 
selections deliver positive improvements.  

5.4 Negative results 
In the preceding sub section, we have reported the 
results from successful experiments. We have cer-
tainly tried other settings too, which are not as fruit-
ful as the ones above.  

Before we improved the sentiment classification 
by modelling the authors, we initially tried to im-
prove it by modeling the papers. We applied py-
thon-igraph5 implementation of the PageRank algo-
rithm (Page et al., 1999) on the paper citation net-
work. We used the PageRank value as a feature to 
model the target paper. However, in our experi-
ments, this feature barely improved classification.   

As for the p-index, we also tried different defini-
tions. Instead of the exponential calculation, we 
tried linear and logarithm calculations too. The ex-
ponential version is proved to be the best.  

 Another variation of the p-index was to use 
log 𝑝 − 𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥  in the place of p-index. Because 
when an author has a high positive citation count 
with relatively low negative citation count, her/his 
p-index will be considerably high. We presumed 
that suppressing it might be beneficial. However, 
experiment results support the p-index without log-
arithm. 

Besides, we also tried out different settings of the 
machine learning classifier. We briefly tested SVM 
with linear kernel. Unlike reported by other work 
(Athar, 2011 and Abu-jbara et al., 2013), SVM with 
linear kernel performs worse than with RBF kernel 
in our experiments.  

6 Discussion 

As described in section 5, we answered our re-
search question by comparing the Macro-F1 score 
between the baseline algorithm with h-index and the

test algorithm with p-index. Significant improve-
ment of classification performance verifies that the 
performance of citation sentiment analysis can be 
improved with better author modelling, in particular 
modeling with citation polarity.  

Moreover, both good features observed in section 
5.3 are the ones that describe some aspect of the au-
thor – namely, the affiliation of author or merely the 
ID of author. This straightforwardly supports our 
hypothesis that the better modeling of author is ad-
vantageous in citation sentiment analysis.  

On the other hand, the feature “polarity distribu-
tion of paper” also models reputation, but on the pa-
per level, which makes it useless for classification.   

In the experiments, SVM with RBF kernel works 
better than SVM with linear kernel. The reason 
could be that the new features we introduced in this 
work needs non-linear separation in the hyper space. 
Another possible reason is that our parameter search 
is not adequately complete.   

7 Conclusion and Future work  

In this work, we answered our research question that 
polarity modeling of author significantly improves 
the citation sentiment analysis performance.  

We believe that this approach can also contribute 
to sentiment analysis on social media or other do-
mains. Generally, if the author’s reputation can be 
modeled using polarized links, the sentiment analy-
sis should benefit from utilizing this model. 

For example, if some online forum facilitates rat-
ing functions, e.g. “thumb-up” and “thumb-down” 
button, its users’ reputation can be modeled with po-
larity distribution. This model could assist the sen-
timent analysis of replies on the forum. Under the 
assumption that respected forum users are more 
likely to be replied in a positive sense.    

With the current result as a proof of concept, we 
plan to further test our method by modeling the au-
thor with other methods, like PageRank on author 
citation network (Ding, 2011). We will also con-
sider utilizing some popular semantic features to 
make our result more comparable to other systems.
