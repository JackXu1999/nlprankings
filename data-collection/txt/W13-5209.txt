Combined analysis of news and Twitter messages

Abstract
While it is widely recognized that streams
of social media messages contain valuable
information, such as important trends in
the users’ interest in consumer products
and markets, uncovering such trends is
problematic, due to the extreme volumes
of messages in such media. In the case
Twitter messages, following the interest in
relation to all known products all the time
is technically infeasible. IE narrows top-
ics to search. In this paper, we present
experiments on using deeper NLP-based
processing of product-related events men-
tioned in news streams to restrict the vol-
ume of tweets that need to be considered,
to make the problem more tractable. Our
goal is to analyze whether such a com-
bined approach can help reveal correla-
tions and how they may be captured.

1 Introduction

Twitter is a social networking and a micro-
blogging service, that currently has more than 500
million users of which 200 million are using the
service regularly. Many commercial organizations
e.g. companies, newspapers and TV stations, as
well as public entities, publish and promote their
content through Twitter. According to the com-
pany itself, 60% of its users “access the service
through mobile devices.” On Twitter the relation-
ships are by default directed, that is, user A can
follow user B’s posts without B following A. The
posts on Twitter are referred to as tweets and at
the moment of this writing there are more than
500 million tweets created daily. A tweet is lim-
ited to 140 characters of text, a legacy from the
time when the system was envisioned to operate
via SMS messages.

We will argue that our practice is not applica-
ble to the Twitter service exclusively, however we

elected to survey Twitter for a number of reasons.
It has a huge number of users and is used world-
wide. Because tweets are limited in length, the
amount of data to be collected is kept manageable
and it also helps maintain the analysis process sim-
ple. However, the most important factor for us was
its openness. By default all tweets are public and
the service offers a relatively functional and free
API for gathering data.

Our earlier investigations demonstrate that
Twitter users do react with higher volumes of posts
to topical, news-worthy events. For instance, con-
sider Figure 1, which plots the number of posts
that contain keywords related to the 2009-2010
outbreak of H1N1 virus (swine flu). The curve
matches almost perfectly with the peak of the out-
break and declines as the epidemic decayed. In
this paper we will show that the topicality can be
extended to business events, such as new product
releases, and some releases indeed generate a large
number of posts.

Until recently, a large part of research on so-
cial media has focused on analyzing and exam-
ining networks and graphs that emerge among
users, references and links, and measuring pat-
terns in creation and consumption of content. At
present, more attention is being devoted to ana-
lyzing the vast volume of messages in the social

41



media in terms of the content of the messages it-
self. Researchers in academia and industry are
eager to mine the content for information that is
not available from other sources, or before it be-
comes available from other sources (for example,
see (Becker et al., 2012; Becker et al., 2011), and
other works of the authors).

However, our work is not aimed at event dis-
covery in Twitter. Instead, we try to discover how
events, which we find in other sources—e.g., in
traditional media—are presented on Twitter. We
assume that it is worthy to know not only what
kind of events can be found in Twitter but also
events that are not present in tweets. For exam-
ple, continuing the previous example, we can note
that apart from flu there are many other diseases
that can be less represented or completely absent
from tweets.

From the point of view of natural language pro-
cessing (NLP), the immediate problem that arises
is that the linguistic register and language usage
that is typical for social media content—such as
web logs, and especially the ultra-short messages,
such as those on Twitter—is very different from
the register and usage in “traditional,” well-studied
sources of on-line textual information, such as
news feeds. Therefore, it has been observed that
new approaches are needed if we are to succeed
raising the quality of analysis of the content of so-
cial media messages to useful levels. This terri-
tory remains largely uncharted, though the need is
quite urgent, since a better understanding of the
content will enable developments in areas such
as market research and advertisement, and will
also help improve the social media services them-
selves.

In this paper we examine how companies and
products mentioned in the news are portrayed in
message streams on the Twitter social networking
service; in particular, we focus on media events re-
lated to the announcement or release of new prod-
ucts by companies. Our main research questions
are: do interesting correlations exist between re-
ports of a product release in the news and the vol-
ume of posts discussing the product on Twitter?
Are some types of products more likely to gener-
ate more posts than others? Do different types of
products trigger the generation of different types
of messages?

One serious problem when conducting social
media research is managing the data collection,

and assuring that the system does not become
overwhelmed with an enormous volume of data.
In this paper we present a hybrid approach, where
we first apply Information Extraction (IE) to mes-
sages found in news streams to narrow down scope
of potentially relevant data that we will subse-
quently collect from Twitter. The volume of news
is orders of magnitude smaller and more manage-
able than the volume of Twitter. In particular, ex-
tracting company and product names mentioned in
the news will yield keywords that will match hot
topics on Twitter. Although we may miss some
important events on Twitter using this procedure,
we reason that it is more tractable than continu-
ally keeping track of a large list of companies and
products. An equally important factor is the fact
that keeping lists of companies and products is not
only impractical, but it is also insufficient, since
new companies and novel products are introduced
to the markets every day.

Our contributions and results include:

• we demonstrate how deeper NLP analysis
can be used to help narrow down scope of
messages to be retrieved from social-media
message streams;

• we observe interesting correlations between
events that are found in the two sources;

• we present some details about the content
of tweets that correspond to news-worthy
events: e.g., proportions retweeted messages
and links, showing that sharing links is com-
mon when discussing certain products.

The remainder of the paper is structured as fol-
lows. Section 2 discusses related work. Section 3
describes the event extraction process, and cov-
ers the details of the data collection from Twitter.
We discuss our results in Section 4, and Section 5
presents our conclusions and an outline of future
work.

2 Related work

Research on social media, and on Twitter in par-
ticular, has been attracting increasing attention.
It is a crucial source of information about pub-
lic moods and opinions, for example, on topics of
public concern such as political changes and elec-
tions (Diakopoulos and Shamma, 2010), or rev-
olutions (Lotan et al., 2011). Twitter also can be

42



useful for monitoring of natural disasters and epi-
demics of infectious disease (Lamb et al., 2013).
At the same time, Twitter is a problematic source
since traditional NLP methods for information ex-
traction, opinion mining, etc., are not directly ap-
plicable to very short texts, or texts using commu-
nication styles peculiar to social media (Timonen
et al., 2011).

Similar work to ours was reported by Tanev et
al. (2012), who first used a fact extraction sys-
tem to find events related to social unrest and
cross-border criminal activity, and then tried to
find additional information by using Twitter feeds.
Becker et al. (2011) trained a classifier to distin-
guish tweets that relate to real-word events from
tweets that do not. They demonstrate that event-
related tweets are quite rare; the majority of tweets
do not contain events.

Kwak et al. (2010) compared topics that attract
major attention on Twitter with coverage in other
sources, namely, Google Trends and CNN head-
lines. They have found that Twitter can be a source
of breaking news as well. Zhao et al. (2011) used
topic modelling to compare Twitter with the New
York Times news site. They found Business as be-
ing among the top-10 topics on Twitter; however,
business-related tweets rarely express opinions.

Krüger et al. (2012) manually analyzed 500 ran-
dom tweets related to Adidas, and came to the
conclusion that the company uses Twitter to pro-
mote their brand. Jansen et al. (2009) manu-
ally prepared a list of companies and brands be-
longing to different Business sectors, and then
collected tweets related to these companies and
brands. They demonstrate that approximately
20% of tweets contain mentions of companies or
brands, which means that Twitter is an impor-
tant marketing medium; however, only 20% of the
tweets that mention companies and brands express
a sentiment about them.

3 Data Collection

We use PULS1 to extract events from text. PULS
is a framework for discovering, aggregating,
vizualization and verification of events in vari-
ous domains, including Epidemics Surveillance,
Cross-Border Security and Business.

In Business scenario events typically include
merges and acquisitions, investments, layoffs,

nominations, etc. In this paper we focus on “New
Product” events, i.e., when a company launches a
new product or service on the market. Figure 2
presents an example of a piece of text from a news
article and an event structure extracted from this
text. A product event describes a company name,
a product name, a location, a date, and the in-
dustry sector to which the event is related. These
slots are filled by a combination of rule-based and
supervised-learning approaches (Grishman et al.,
2002; Yangarber, 2003; Huttunen et al., 2013).

For identifying the industry sectors to which the
events relate, we use a classification system, cur-
rently containing 40 broad sectors, e.g., “Electron-
ics,” “Food,” or “Transport.” This classification
system is similar to existing classification stan-
dards, such as the Global Industry Classification
System (GICS),2, or the Industry Classification
Benchmark (ICB, http://www.icbenchmark.com/),
with some simplifying modifications. The sector
is assigned to the event using a Naive-Bayes clas-
sifier, which is trained on a manually-labeled set of
news articles, approximately 200 for each sector,
that we collected over several years.

We use the new-product events extracted by
PULS to construct special queries to the Twitter
API. One query contains a company name and a
product name, which are the slots of a product
event (see Figure 2). Every day we extract about
50 product events from news articles, and generate
50 corresponding queries to the Twitter API. We
then use the Twitter API and collect all tweets that
include both the company and the product name.
Below one can see an example tweet containing
the company name Audi and the product name A3:

Time Events Tweets
Nov 2012–May 2013 1764 3,842,148

Table 1: Dataset description

The new A3 from Audi looks great!

The Twitter API has some restrictions. While
conducting our survey3, we could make 150 re-
quests per hour, asking for 100 tweets per request,
yielding a maximum of 15,000 tweets per hour.
We had at our disposal the University of Helsinki
cluster consisting of approximately machines, giv-
ing us the theoretical possibility to collect up to
3,000,000 tweets per hour.

While the company and product names are used
as keywords in the Twitter query, other slots of
the event are used for analyzing the results of the
query. These slots, which include the industry sec-
tor, the country, the product description, and the
date of the report, are used to label the tweets re-
turned by the query. For example, we extract an
event as in Figure 2 and get 2,000 tweets which
contain both ”Nokia” and ”Lumia 928”. Since the
event is related to the industry sector ”Telecom-
munications”, we consider these 2,000 tweets are
also related to ”Telecommunications”. Thus, we
can group the returned tweets by industry sectors,
country, etc., and analyze the flow of information.

The Twitter API lets us fetch tweets from seven
previous days, and we kept collecting the tweets
for each keyword for at least 3 days after its men-
tion in the news. Thus, every keyword query has
a time-line of roughly ten days around the news
date.

The dataset is summarized in Table 1. We
started the survey in November 2012 and the re-
sults presented in this paper include data collected
through May 2013. In total, there are 1764 differ-
ent events and in total close to 4 million tweets.
In the final section of this paper we will discuss
how we plan to improve the data collection in the
future.

4 Experiments and results

4.1 Tweet statistics overview
First we present an overview of the tweet statis-
tics. Table 2 summarizes the statistics, grouping
the events based on the number of tweets they
generated. The table also lists the total num-
ber of tweets, the percent of tweets that contain

1-10 249 85 12 85

Table 2: Overall statistics: number of tweets, links
and retweets per event

at least one hyper-link URL, and the percent of
“retweets”. A retweet is somewhat analogous to
forwarding of an email. A retweets starts with
“RT” abbreviation, making it easily distinguish-
able. Note that retweet can contain additional text
compared to the original tweet, e.g., the retweet-
ing user’s personal opinion. The last column on
the table represents the fraction of unique tweets;
to count this number we subtracted from the total
amount of tweets the number of tweets which were
exactly identical. We pruned away the shortened
link URLs from the tweet text when we calculated
the uniqueness percentage, since the same URL
can be shortened differently.

As can be seen from Table 2 there were 33 prod-
uct events that generated more than 10,000 tweets.
Strikingly, 82 percent of the tweets had a link. We
checked a random sample through a subset of the
tweets, and it seems that the single most common
reason for the high number of links is that many
websites today have a “share on Twitter” button,
which allows a user to share a Web article with
his/her followers by posting it on the user’s Twit-
ter page. The resulting tweet will have the article’s
original title, a generic description of the article
(such as the one used in a RSS feed), and a link to
the actual article. This can also be seen on the last
column in Table 2, since the resulting tweets are
always identical.

It is interesting to observe that the tweet unique-
ness drops as the number of tweets increases.
This would seem to indicate that the likelihood
that an article is shared increases with the num-
ber of times it has already been shared. The same
seems to hold for retweets as well. This corre-
sponds to the observations found in literature: it
was shown, (Kwak et al., 2010), that if a particu-
lar tweet has been retweeted once, it is likely that it
will be retweeted again. Similarly, tweets that con-
tain a URL are more likely to be retweeted (Suh et
al., 2010). However, tweets related to business are
rarely retweeted (Zhao et al., 2011).

Table 3: Most frequently tweeted companies

4.2 What is tweeted most frequently

The total number of distinct companies present in
our data set is 1,140. The majority of these com-
panies occur in one event only; for 50% of the
companies less than 10 tweets have been returned.
The list of most frequently tweeted companies is
shown in Table 3. We show the number of events
for a company in our dataset, the maximum num-
ber of tweets for any one event, and the total num-
ber of tweets for the company.

It can be seen from the table that only events re-
lated to well-known IT giants, (Facebook, Google,
Microsoft), produce more than 100,000 tweets.
Nokia, which is on the fourth position, produces
8 times fewer tweets than Google.4

Electronics, even though these events are about launching

Table 4: Most frequently tweeted industry sectors.

Other companies in table are telecommunica-
tion and automotive companies, food and drink
producers, cosmetics and clothing suppliers. By
contrast airlines receive little attention, the news
about opening new flight routes cause little re-
sponse on Twitter. For example, the only tweet
related to a new flight by Air Baltic between Riga
and Olbia was found in a Twitter account which is
specialized for the airline’s news.

The list of the most frequently tweeted indus-
try sectors is shown in Table 4. Note, that the
business sectors are assigned to events, not to a
particular company; for example, an event that de-
scribes Facebook launched “Home,” an operating
system for mobile phones, was assigned with the
sector “Telecommunications Technologies”, while
an event that describes that Facebook launched
Graph Search was assigned with sector “Media,
Information Services”.

As can be seen from Table 4, the sectors in
our data are distributed approximately according
to Zipf’s law: the majority of tweets are related to
a limited number of sectors, while the majority of
sectors trigger little or no response on Twitter. For
example, we do not find any tweets related to such
sectors as “Construction” or “Minerals & Metals”;
the “Agriculture” sector generated only 3 tweets.

Comparing tables 4 and 3 we can observe that
there is a dependency between the number of

new smartphones and other gadgets, which seem to be very
popular in Twitter. We believe that we did not find more
tweets because the full name of the company—“Samsung
Electronics”—is rarely used in the tweets, which tend to re-
fer to it as “Samsung;” this type of synonymy will be taken
into account in future work. The majority of tweets related
to Samsung are links to news (see an example in Figure 3);
the text of these tweets are mostly identical (Figure 4), which
means that people do not type new information but only click
the “tweet” button on the news page.

events related to a particular sector and the num-
ber of tweets related to this sector, whereas there
seems to be no such relation between the number
of events related to particular company and a num-
ber of tweets related to this company. For exam-
ple, only one event involving Acer appeared dur-
ing the covered period—a launch of the “Iconia
B1” tablet—but it drew more than 6,000 tweets.

The dependencies between the number of
events and the number of tweets for companies

spectively.

glish, but depending on the resulting keywords,
the tweets that match the query could be in any
language. Since we use the English names for
companies and products there is an inherent bias
toward countries that use languages with a Latin-
based script. However, despite that were able
to find many tweets for events that happen in
countries that use non-Latin scripts, e.g., Russia
or Japan. Two reasons for this may be that the
larger companies operates globally, and that Twit-
ter users tend to type company and product names
in English even though they tweet in their own lan-
guages, see examples in Figure 7.

5 Conclusion and future work

We described an end-to-end framework, which al-
lows us to analyze the influence that business news
have on tweets. We have demonstrated that the im-
pact that new-product events have on Twitter de-
pends more on the industry sector than on a partic-
ular company. It is clear, however, that the devel-
oped framework can be used in more broad appli-
cations, at least for more sophisticated data analy-
sis.

Our data, as it was shown before, include the
event date and the timestamps for tweets. How-
ever, in the current paper this data have been over-
looked in the analysis. Thus, the main direction
of the further work will focus more on the tempo-
ral dimension. We are going to add more metrics,
such as the time gap between the product launch
and the peak of tweets.

Furthermore, we would like to see whether we
could predict the impact created by a product
launch based on the history and to find out if there
are some models to match that and the lifetime of
the tweets. To solve this problem, we plan to mod-
ify our data collection process and to monitor a
several big companies for a longer time, in order
to establish baselines. This will allows us, first, to
analyze the exact impact of a product launch on
Twitter volume and, second, to measure an impact
of corpus narrowing using IE.

Another aspect of the data, which would be in-
teresting to investigate, is location. As have been
shown before, the business events include a coun-
try slot; however, we cannot assume that corre-
sponding tweets originate from the same coun-
try. Thus, we are going to use geolocation tech-
niques, (Dredze et al., 2013; Bergsma et al., 2013),
to find the tweets’ countries and to compare them
with the countries found in news.

We also plan to improve the query construc-

tion algorithm to find more tweets for compound
company names, such as “Samsung Electronics.”
This cannot be done in a straightforward fash-
ion: “Samsung” may likely refer to “Samsung
Electronics”, though “Electronics” may refer to
many different entities. Thus we cannot simply
search for all substrings of a company name, be-
cause such queries will produce to many false
hits. We assume that special named entity recog-
nition techniques, which have been recently devel-
oped for Twitter (Ritter et al., 2011; Piskorski and
Ehrmann, 2013), can be used to solve this prob-
lem. To improve coverage it is also possible to
use automatic transliteration, which allows to map
proper names from Latin to other scripts (Nouri et
al., 2013).

We have studied the most and least frequently
tweeted companies and industry sectors. In the
next phases we will study the most frequently
tweeted product types. Since every product found
by IE system has a description (as presented in
Figure 2), we can group tweets by product type.
However, additional work is needed to merge such
product types as, for example, “chocolate” and
“chocolate candies”. We plan to use a Business
concept ontology, which includes the long list of
possible product types, to perform this task.
