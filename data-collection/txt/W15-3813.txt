Abstract 

Understanding lexical characteristics of 

clinical documents is the foundation of 

sublanguage based Medical Language 

Processing (MLP) approach. However, 

there are limited studies focused on the 

lexical characters of Chinese clinical 

documents. In this study, a lexical 

characteristics analysis on both syntactic 

and semantic levels was conducted in a 

clinical corpus which contains 3,500 

clinical documents generated during daily 

practices. The analysis was based on the 

automatic tagging results of a lexicon-

based part-of-speech (POS) and semantic 

tagging method. The medical lexicon 

contains 237,291 entries annotated with 

both semantic and syntactic classes. The 

normalized frequency of different terms, 

syntactic and semantic classes was 

calculated and visualized.  Major 

contribution of this paper is providing a 

wide-coverage Chinese medical semantic 

lexicon and presenting the lexical 

characteristics of Chinese clinical 

documents. Both of these will lay a good 

foundation for sublanguage based MLP 

studies in China. 

1 Introduction 

Clinical documents which contain a tremendous 

amount of patient information to facilitate inter-

provider communication, also the most important 

part of clinical data for secondary use such as 

clinical research and administration. Recent 

advance in MLP technologies (Sager et al., 

1987;Sager et al., 1994; Friedman and Hripcsak, 

1999; Liu et al., 2012; Irina P. Temnikova et 

al ,2013; Irina P. Temnikova et al ,2014; Pham et 

al., 2014), such as de-identification (Meystre et al., 

2014; Kayaalp et al., 2014), text classification 

(Pestian et al., 2007; Vijay, 2012), information 

retrieval ( Uzuner et, al., 2010; Zhu et al., 2013), 

etc., affords an opportunity to study and analyze 

clinical documents at an unprecedented scale. 

In recent years, Chinese MLP topics have 

drawn increasing public attention as there are 

more and more electronic clinical data that major 

exist in free text format such as clinical documents 

and reports were accumulated in many hospitals. 

Some Chinese MLP studies have been reported 

such as information extraction (Wang et al., 2014), 

NER(Named Entity Recognition) (Lei et al., 

2014). However, systematic studies of lexical 

characters of Chinese clinical documents, that is 

the foundation of sublanguage based MLP 

approach and have been widely studied in other 

language (Foltz, 1996; Wu and Liu, 2011; 

Patterson and Hurdle, 2011; Patterson et al., 2010; 

Friedman et al., 2002), are seldom reported. Lack 

of accessibility of clinical documents corpus and 

comprehensive lexical resources for the research 

community is the major obstacle. 

Both syntactic and semantic lexical features are 

important to understand the medical language 

structure and grammar (Harris 1968;1991). 

However, studying lexical features in both 

syntactic and semantic levels in large scale corpus 

requires a comprehensive medical lexicon to 

support the automatic lexical tagging process 

(Meystre et al., 2008). Unfortunately, such lexical 

resources in Chinese are not available. In this 

study, we constructed a 237,291 entries Chinese 

medical lexicon using computer aided methods at 

first. Then a lexical analysis which aims to present 

syntactic and semantic features of Chinese clinical 

114



documents was conducted in a corpus contains 

3,500 clinical documents. The lexical features of 

clinical documents from different departments 

were reported. The annotated corpus was ready 

for further utilization such as collection of the co-

occurrence patterns (Grishman et al., 1986) and 

sublanguage grammar. 

2 Methods 

To understand the lexical characters of language 

used in a subdomain, a large-scale corpus contains 

typical language samples from the real word need 

to be constructed at first.  Then this corpus should 

be annotated manually or automatically with  part-

of-speech (POS) tags and semantic tags. Then the 

statistical analysis based on these tagging results 

will help researchers to understand the features of 

this type of sublanguage. 

2.1 Corpus Collection 

The corpus was collected from an EMR system 

which implemented in a 2000-beded hospital in 

China. More than 60,000 clinical documents were 

generated from 2009 to 2011 in total 35 clinical 

departments. Randomly selected 100 clinical 

documents from each department were used to 

construct a corpus for this study. Total 5 

document types were included in the 3,500 

clinical documents which contain 152,393 

sentences and 2,375,909 Chinese characters. In 

addition, 15 clinical documents were randomly 

selected and manually annotated as the test set to 

evaluate  the coverage of the lexicon as well as the 

performance of lexcial tagging methods. 

2.2 Lexicon Construction 

A general purpose dictionary which used in an 

open-source Chinese word segmenter Pangu 

(http://pangusegment.codeplex.com) constituted 

the basic of this lexicon. While most of the total 

146,259 lexemes from this general purpose 

dictionary are irrelevant to medical concepts. 

ICD-10, a medication lexicon which was acquired 

from (http://yao.dxy.com/) using web crawler 

technology, and a home-grown lexicon were also 

compiled into this lexicon. Total 237,291 lexemes 

were included in this lexicon. Learning from the 

classical Linguistics String Project (LSP) 

(Grishman et al., 1973), total 24 semantic 

categories were designed (Listed in Table 1). POS 

tags were directly inherited from the Pangu 

systems.  Semantic attribute annotations of 

lexcion were achieved using both statistical 

method and syntactic rule based method. Medical 

domain specialty terms such as ICD-10, 

medication dictionary that with known semantic 

class will be annotated in batch during their 

enrollemnts. Some semantic class with obvious 

morphology was assigned through matching key 

character of the lexeme. For example, if a 

character  ends with "病" ("disease") with POS 
attribute "noun", its semantic class will be 

annotated as "Diagnosis" for further manual 

review. The ambiguity of semantic classes of 

many lexemes was resolved based on the most 

frequently usage in the corpus.

Table 1: Semantic classes defined in the lexicon. 

In addition, semantic class of lexemes with 

irrelevant POSes such as "Chinese idiom" was 

tagged as "Irrelevant". Furthermore, lexemes  

115



which are not processed with the mentioned 

approaches were annotated manually. 

2.3 Tokenization and Annotation 

Supported by the constructed lexicon, the 

tokenization and annotation of the corpus were 

conducted in the following steps. Firstly, each 

clinical document in the corpus with extra space 

was automatically trimmed in the pre-process. 

Then a punctuation-driven sentence boundary 

detection algorithm was applied to obtain 

sentences and clauses. After that, all clauses were 

segmented into words or phrases using a Chinese 

lexical analyzer ICTCLAS (Zhang et al., 2003). 

Both the semantic and syntactic classes were 

annotated for each word or phrase based on the 

lexicon during this process. For words or phrases 

without semantic attributes in the lexicon will be 

annotated as "Unknown". To make it simple, all 

the symbols, Arab numbers and punctuations that 

without specific meanings were all removed. 

2.4 Lexical Characteristics Analysis 

A statistical frequencies of different lexical 

categories in different condition were calculated. 

As shown in Formula 1, a NF (Normalized 

Frequency) value was normalized as the count of 

this type of lexemes in every 10,000 lexemes used 

in the background. As different categories with 

significant difference NF values, the logarithm of 

NF (LoF) will be calculated to plot the diverse 

values easier (Shown in Formula 2). 

𝑁𝐹 =
𝑁𝐶𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑔𝑜𝑟𝑦   ∗ 10000

𝑁𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 
                   (1) 

𝐿𝑜𝐹 = {
log(𝑁𝐹)        , NF ≥ 1
0                       , NF < 1

             (2) 

In Formula 1, the 𝑁𝐶𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑔𝑜𝑟𝑦 indicated the count 

of lexemes with specific semantic or syntactic cat-

egory attribute in corpus or subset of corpus. The 

N𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙  represented the total number of lexemes 
in the same corpus. The LoF value will be set to 0, 

when there are seldom observation of some cate-

gory in some subset of corpus. 

3 Results 

3.1 Evaluation of the Lexicon Coverage and 
Lexical Tagging Methods 

The quality of the lexical characters generated 

from statistical analysis depends on the coverage 

and completeness of the lexicon constructed. 

Comparing with the typical comprehensive 

medical lexical resources such as UMLS which 

contains millions of terms, our lexicon scale is 

relatively small. So we calculate the coverage and 

completeness of the lexicon during the tokenizing 

and annotation. Total 13,660 lexemes were 

unrecognized among all 2,375,909 lexemes in the 

corpus. The coverage of our lexicon in the corpus 

was 99.43% calculated by Formula 3. Similarly, 

the distinct lexemes among the unrecognized 

lexemes and lexemes in the corpus were 577 and 

19,847 respectively. Thus, the completeness of 

the lexicon was 91.11% calculated by Formula 4. 

𝐶𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑒 =
𝑁𝑈𝑛𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑔𝑛𝑖𝑧𝑒𝑑 𝑙𝑒𝑥𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑠 

𝑁𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 
∗ 100%   (3) 

𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑠𝑠 =

𝑁𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑡 𝑙𝑒𝑥𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑠 
∗ 100%           (4) 

Based on the manually annotated test set, we 

evaluated the accuracy of word segmenter 

performance and syntax and semantics 

classification. Word segmentation and annotation 

regarding POS and semantics were conducted on 

the test set with the ICTCLAS. As a result, 4,006 

lexemes were obtained excluding punctuations 

and Arabics by the automatic tagging process. 

Manually checking by one of the authors, the 

number of error segments caused by ICTCLAS 

was counted. Meanwhile, the number of lexemes 

with error POS tag or semantic tag was picked out. 

The accuracy of word segmentation, POS and 

semantics was calculated separately by Formula 5 

and demonstrated in Table 2. 
Evaluate item  Accuracy 

Word Segmentation(ICTCLAS) 96.03% 

POS  88.09% 

Semantics  90.86% 

Table 2: The evaluation result of the lexicon. 

3.2 Lexical Characters in Chinese Clinical 
Documents 

The semantic class of lexemes usage frequency 

(NF value) in different clinical departments was 

plotted in Fig. 1 using heatmap.2 function gplots 

package in R. It is apparent from the heat map that 

"body part", "time", "symptom" and "diagnosis" 

were the top four semantic classes. We can easily 

distinguish the mental health department from 

other departments as the "body part" was used in 

a relatively lower frequency. Some internal 

medicine department such as rheumatology, 

hematology and nephrology more interested in the 

lab test result discussion. 

The fluctuation of 22 POS categories in 5 typical 

document types in Fig. 2.A is basically consistent 

in general. However, there are observable 

116



differences between semantic categories as 

showed in Fig. 2.B. For example, document type 

of informed consents has great differences 

compared with other types of clinical documents.

We can also notice that large number of phrases 

related to "time" were used in discharge summar-

ies, implying that these retrospective documents 

record many temporal information. Fig. 3 and Fig. 

4 show the overall LoF proportion of semantic and 

POS types in the corpus. All the figures lead us to 

the conclusion that body part, symptom and diag-

nosis sublanguages account for the largest portion 

of Chinese clinical documents. 

3.3 Co-occurrence patterns in Chinese Clin-
ical Documents 

Furthermore, more than 168,823 nonrepeating 

clauses were obtained in the corpus including total 

565,630 clauses. To count the sematic patterns 

among these clauses, some frequently used co-

occurrence patterns were summarized in Table 3. 

For each pattern, the example clause was 

highlighted with different font colors and styles to 

show corresponding semantic component.  

These co-occurrence patterns will lay a 

foundation to create sublanguage grammars for 

the Chinese medical language. 

Co-occurrence pattern  Sample  Count 

Body Part +Irrelevant +Symptom 心前区无隆起"no uplift in precordium"， 12,740

4 Discussion and Future Work 

In this paper, through constructing a comprehen-

sive medical semantic lexicon, the lexical charac-

teristics of clinical documents both in semantics 

and syntactic level were analyzed separately.  In 

addition, a number of the most frequent sub-

language co-occurrence patterns of Chinese clini-

cal documents were discovered. 

The quality of the lexicon constructed in this 

study is the major challenge of current analysis. 

As a mature and high-quality lexical resource 

such as UMLS will take years and cost millions of 

dollars to maintain. A Chinese counterpart is 

urgently needed and its value should be well 

recognized by governments and funding agencies. 

Our future work includes improving the 

coverage and quality of the lexicon based on the 

corpus using more computer aided approaches. 

The accuracy of the automatic tagging process 

still has plenty of room to improve. Currently 

most of the errors were caused by ambiguous of 

semantic type or POS.  But the results of this 

lexical analysis still provide much useful 

information to Chinese medical language 

researchers. 

Lack accessibility of corpus is one of the 

obstacles for current Chinese medical language 

processing studies due to current regulation and 

privacy concerns. As the automatic de-

identification methods already widely accepted in 

many countries, we will evaluate it in our corpus 

in the future. After that this annotated corpus will 

open to the community.
