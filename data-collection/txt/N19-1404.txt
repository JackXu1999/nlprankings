Abstract
Deep learning has emerged as a compelling
solution to many NLP tasks with remarkable
performances. However, due to their opac-
ity, such models are hard to interpret and trust.
Recent work on explaining deep models has
introduced approaches to provide insights to-
ward the model’s behaviour and predictions,
which are helpful for assessing the reliabil-
ity of the model’s predictions. However, such
methods do not improve the model’s reliabil-
ity. In this paper, we aim to teach the model to
make the right prediction for the right reason
by providing explanation training and ensur-
ing the alignment of the model’s explanation
with the ground truth explanation. Our exper-
imental results on multiple tasks and datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method, which produces more reliable predic-
tions while delivering better results compared
to traditionally trained models.

1 Introduction

It is unfortunate that our data is often plagued
by meaningless or even harmful statistical biases.
When we train a model on such data, it is possible
that the classifier focuses on irrelevant biases to
achieve high performance on the biased data. Re-
cent studies demonstrate that deep learning mod-
els noticeably suffer from this issue (Agrawal
et al., 2016; Wadhwa et al., 2018; Gururangan
et al., 2018). Due to the black-box nature of deep
models and the high dimensionality of their inher-
ent representations, it is difficult to interpret and
trust their behaviour and predictions. Recent work
on explanation and interpretation has introduced
a few approaches (Simonyan et al., 2013; Ribeiro
et al., 2016; Lei et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016, 2017;
Ghaeini et al., 2018b; Ribeiro et al., 2018) for ex-
planation. Such methods provide insights toward
the model’s behaviour, which is helpful for detect-
ing biases in our models. However, they do not

correct them. Here, we investigate how to incor-
porate explanations into the learning process to en-
sure that our model not only makes correct predic-
tions but also makes them for the right reason.

Specifically, we propose to train a deep model
using both ground truth labels and additional an-
notations suggesting the desired explanation. The
learning is achieved via a novel method called
saliency learning, which regulates the model’s be-
haviour using saliency to ensure that the most crit-
ical factors impacting the model’s prediction are
aligned with the desired explanation.

Our work is closely related to Ross et al. (2017),
which also uses the gradient/saliency information
to regularize model’s behaviour. However, we dif-
fer in the following points: 1) Ross et al. (2017) is
limited to regularizing model with gradient of the
model’s input. In contrast, we extend this concept
to the intermediate layers of deep models, which
is demonstrated to be beneficial based on the ex-
perimental results; 2) Ross et al. (2017) consid-
ers annotation at the dimension level, which is not
appropriate for NLP tasks since the individual di-
mensions of the word embeddings are not inter-
pretable; 3) most importantly, Ross et al. (2017)
learns from annotations of irrelevant parts of the
data, whereas we focus on positive annotations
identifying parts of the data that contributes pos-
itive evidence toward a specific class. In textual
data, it is often unrealistic to annotate a word (even
a stop word) to be completely irrelevant. On the
other hand, it can be reasonably easy to identify
group of words that are positively linked to a class.

We make the following contributions: 1) we
propose a new method for teaching the model
where to pay attention; 2) we evaluate our method
on multiple tasks and datasets and demonstrate
that our method achieves more reliable predictions
while delivering better results than traditionally
trained models; 3) we verify the sensitivity of our

saliency-trained model to perturbations introduced
on part of the data that contributes to the explana-
tion.

2 Saliency-based Explanation Learning

Our goal is to teach the model where to pay atten-
tion in order to avoid focusing on meaningless sta-
tistical biases in the data. In this work, we focus on
positive explanations. In other words, we expect
the explanation to highlight information that con-
tributes positively towards the label. For example,
if a piece of text contains the mention of a particu-
lar event, then the explanation will highlight parts
of the text indicating the event, not non-existence
of some other events. This choice is because posi-
tive evidence is more natural for human to specify.

Formally, each training example is a tuple
(X, y, Z), where X = [X1, X2, . . . , Xn] is the
input text (length n), y is the ground-truth label,
andZ ∈ {0, 1}n is the ground-truth explanation as
a binary mask indicating whether each word con-
tributes positive evidence toward the label y.

Recent studies have shown that the model’s
predictions can be explained by examining the
saliency of the inputs (Simonyan et al., 2013;
Hechtlinger, 2016; Ross et al., 2017; Li et al.,
2016) as well as other internal elements of the
model (Ghaeini et al., 2018b). Given an exam-
ple, for which the model makes a prediction, the
saliency of a particular element is computed as the
derivative of the model’s prediction with respect to
that element. Saliency provides clues as to where
the model is drawing strong evidence to support its
prediction. As such, if we constrain the saliency
to be aligned with the desired explanation during
learning, our model will be coerced to pay atten-
tion to the right evidence.

In computing saliency, we are dealing with
high-dimensional data. For example, each word
is represented by an embedding of d dimensions.
To aggregate the contribution of all dimensions,
we consider sum of the gradients of all dimen-
sions as the overall vector/embedding contribu-
tion. For the i-th word, if Z[i] = 1, then its vector
should have a positive gradient/contribution, oth-
erwise the model would be penalized. To accom-
plish this, we incorporate a saliency regularization
term to the model cost function using hinge loss.
Equation 1 describes our cost function evaluated

on a single example (X, y, Z).

C(θ,X, y, Z) = L(θ,X, y)

+ λ
n∑
i=1

max

0,−Zi d∑
j=1

∂fθ(X, y)

∂Xi,j

 (1)
where L is a traditional model cost function (e.g.
cross-entropy), λ is a hyper parameter, f specifies
the model with parameter θ, and ∂f∂Xi,j represents
the saliency of the j-th dimension of wordXi. The
new term in the C penalizes negative gradient for
the marked words in Z (contributory words).

Since C is differentiable respect to θ, it can be
optimized using existing gradient-based optimiza-
tion methods. It is important to note that while
Equation 1 only regularizes the saliency of the in-
put layer, the same principle can be applied to the
intermediate layers of the model (Ghaeini et al.,
2018b) by considering the intermediate layer as
the input for the later layers.

Note that if Z = 0 then C = L. So, in case
of lacking proper annotations for a specific sample
or sequence, we can simply use 0 as its annotation.
This property enables our method to be easily used
in semi-supervised or active learning settings.

3 Tasks and Datasets

To teach the model where to pay attention,
we need ground-truth explanation annotation Z,
which is difficult to come by. As a proof of con-
cept, we modify two well known real tasks (Event
Extraction and Cloze-Style Question Answering)
to simulate approximate annotations for explana-
tion. Details of the main tasks and datasets could
be found in section B of the Appendix. We de-
scribe the modified tasks as follows:
1) Event Extraction: Given a sentence, the goal
is to determine whether the sentence contains an
event. Note that event extraction benchmarks con-
tain the annotation of event triggers, which we use
to build the annotation Z. In particular, the Z
value of every word is annotated to be zero un-
less it belongs to an event trigger. For this task, we
consider two well known event extraction datasets,
namely ACE 2005 and Rich ERE 2015.
2) Cloze-Style Question Answering: Given a
sentence and a query with a blank, the goal is to
determine whether the sentence contains the cor-
rect replacement for the blank. Here, annotation
of each word is zero unless it belongs to the gold

replacement. For this task, we use two well known
cloze-style question answering datasets: Children
Book Test Named Entity (CBT-NE) and Common
Noun (CBT-CN) (Hill et al., 2015).

Here, we only consider the simple binary tasks
as a first attempt to examine the effectiveness of
our method. However, our method is not restricted
to binary tasks. In multi-class problems, each class
can be treated as the positive class of the binary
classification. In such a setting, each class would
have its own explanation and annotation Z.

Note that for both tasks if an example is neg-
ative, its explanation annotation will be all zero.
In other words, for negative examples we have
C = L.

4 Model

We use simple CNN based models to avoid com-
plexity. Figure 1 illustrates the models used in this
paper. Both models have a similar structure. The
main difference is that QA has two inputs (sen-
tence and query). We first describe the event ex-
traction model followed by the QA model.

Figure 1 (a) shows the event extraction model.
Given a sentence W = [w1, . . . , wn] where wi ∈
Rd, we first pass the embeddings to two CNNs
with feature size of d and window size of 3 and 5.
Next we apply max-pooling to both CNN outputs.
It will give us the representation I ∈ Rn×d, which
we refer to as the intermediate representation.
Then, we apply sequence-wise and dimension-
wise max-poolings to I to capture Dseq ∈ Rd and
Ddim ∈ Rn respectively. Ddim will be referred
as decision representation. Finally we pass the
concatenation ofDseq andDdim to a feed-forward
layer for prediction.

Figure 1 (b) depicts the QA model. The main
difference is having query as an extra input. To
process the query, we use a similar structure to the
main model. After CNNs and max-pooling we end

up withQ ∈ Rm×d wherem is the length of query.
To obtain a sequence independent vector, we apply
another max-pooling toQ resulting in a query rep-
resentation q ∈ Rd. We follow a similar approach
to in event extraction for the given sentence. The
only difference is that we apply a dot product be-
tween the intermediate representations and query
representation (Ii = Ii � q).

As mentioned previously, we can apply saliency
regularization to different levels of the model. In
this paper, we apply saliency regularization on the
following three levels: 1) Word embeddings (W ).
2) Intermediate representation (I). 3) Decision
representation (Ddim). Note that the aforemen-
tioned levels share the same annotation for train-
ing. For training details please refer to Section C
of the Appendix.

5 Experiments and Analysis

5.1 Performance

Table 1 shows the performance of the trained mod-
els on ACE, ERE, CBT-NE, and CBT-CN datasets
using the aforementioned models with and with-
out saliency learning. The results indicate that us-
ing saliency learning yields better accuracy and
F1 measure on all four datasets. It is interesting
to note that saliency learning consistently helps
the models to achieve noticeably higher preci-
sion without hurting the F1 measure and accuracy.
This observation suggests that saliency learning is
effective in providing proper guidance for more
accurate predictions – Note that here we only
have guidance for positive prediction. To ver-
ify the statistical significance of the observed per-
formance improvement over traditionally trained

models without saliency learning, we conducted
the one-sided McNemar’s test. The obtained p-
values are 0.03, 0.03, 0.0001, and 0.04 for ACE,
ERE, CBT-NE, and CBT-CN respectively, indicat-
ing that the performance gain by saliency learning
is statistically significant.

5.2 Saliency Accuracy

In this section, we examine how well does the
saliency of the trained model aligns with the an-
notation. To this end, we define a metric called
saliency accuracy (sacc), which measures what
percentage of all positive positions of annotation
Z indeed obtain a positive gradient. Formally,
sacc = 100

∑
i δ(ZiGi>0)∑

i Zi
where Gi is the gradient

of element i and δ is the indicator function.
Table 2 shows the saliency accuracy at differ-

ent layers of the trained model with and with-
out saliency learning. According to Table 2, our
method achieves a much higher saliency accuracy
for all datasets indicating that the learning was in-
deed effective in aligning the model saliency with
the annotation. In other words, important words
will have positive contributions in the saliency-
trained model, and as such, it learns to focus on
the right part(s) of the data. This claim can also be
verified by visualizing the saliency, which is pro-
vided in the next section.

5.3 Saliency Visualization

Here, we visualize the saliency of three positive
samples from the ACE dataset for both the tradi-
tionally trained (Baseline Model) and the saliency-
trained model (saliency-trained Model). Table 3
shows the top 6 salient words (words with high-

est saliency/gradient) of three positive samples
along with their contributory words (annotation
Z), the baseline model prediction (PB), and the
saliency-trained model prediction (PS). Darker
red color indicates more salient words. Accord-
ing to Table 3, both models correctly predict 1
and the saliency-trained model successfully pays
attention to the expected meaningful words while
the baseline model pays attention to mostly irrele-
vant ones. More analyses are provided in section
D of the Appendix.

5.4 Verification

Up to this point, we show that using saliency learn-
ing yields noticeably better precision, F1 measure,
accuracy, and saliency accuracy. Here, we aim to
verify our claim that saliency learning coerces the
model to pay more attention to the critical parts.
The annotation Z describes the influential words
toward the positive labels. Our hypothesis is that
removing such words would cause more impact on
the saliency-trained models since by training, they
should be more sensitive to these words. We mea-
sure the impact as the percentage change of the
model’s true positive rate. This measure is cho-
sen because negative examples do not have any
annotated contributory words, and hence we are
particularly interested in how removing contribu-
tory words of positive examples would impact the
model’s true positive rate (TPR).

Table 4 shows the outcome of the aforemen-
tioned experiment, where the last column lists the
TPR reduction rates. From the table, we see a con-
sistently higher rate of TPR reduction for saliency-
trained models compared to traditionally trained
models, suggesting that the saliency-trained mod-
els are more sensitive to the perturbation of the
contributory word(s) and confirming our hypoth-
esis.

It is worth noting that we observe less substan-
tial change to the true positive rate for the event
task. This is likely due to the fact that we are using
trigger words as simulated explanations. While
trigger words are clearly related to events, there
are often other words in the sentence relating to
events but not annotated as trigger words.

6 Conclusion

In this paper, we proposed saliency learning, a
novel approach for teaching a model where to
pay attention. We demonstrated the effectiveness

of our method on multiple tasks and datasets us-
ing simulated explanations. The results show that
saliency learning enables us to obtain better pre-
cision, F1 measure and accuracy on these tasks
and datasets. Further, it produces models whose
saliency is more properly aligned with the desired
explanation. In other words, saliency learning
gives us more reliable predictions while delivering
better performance than traditionally trained mod-
els. Finally, our verification experiments illustrate
that the saliency-trained models show higher sen-
sitivity to the removal of contributory words in a
positive example. For future work, we will extend
our study to examine saliency learning on NLP
tasks in an active learning setting where real ex-
planations are requested and provided by a human.

A Background: Saliency

The concept of saliency was first introduced in vi-
sion for visualizing the spatial support on an image
for particular object class (Simonyan et al., 2013).
Considering a deep model prediction as a differ-
entiable model f parameterized by θ with input
X ∈ Rn×d. Such a model could be described us-
ing the Taylor series as follow:

f(x) = f(a)+f
′
(a)(x−a)+ f

′′
(a)

2!
(x−a)2+. . .

(2)
By approximating that a deep model is a linear

function, we could use the first order Taylor ex-
pansion.

f(x) ≈ f ′(a)x+ b (3)

According to Equation 3, the first derivative of
the model’s prediction respect to its input (f

′
(a)

or ∂f∂x |x=a) describes the model’s behaviour near
the input. To make it more clear, bigger deriva-
tive/gradient indicates more impact and contribu-
tion toward the model’s prediction. Consequently,
the large-magnitude derivative values determine
elements of input that would greatly affect f(x)
if changed.

B Task and Dataset

Here, we first describe the main and real Event
Extraction and Close-Style Question Answering
tasks (before our modification). Next, we pro-
vide data statistics of the modified version of ACE,
ERE, CBT-NE, and CBT-CN datasets in Table 5.

• Event Extraction: Given a set of ontolo-
gized event types (e.g. Movement, Trans-
action, Conflict, etc.), the goal of event ex-
traction is to identify the mentions of differ-
ent events along with their types from natural
texts (Chen et al., 2015; Ghaeini et al., 2016;
Orr et al., 2018).

• Cloze-Style Question Answering: Docu-
ments in CBT consist of 20 contiguous sen-
tences from the body of a popular children
book and queries are formed by replacing a
token from the 21st sentence with a blank.
Given a document, a query, and a set of can-
didates, the goal is to find the correct replace-
ment for blank in the query among the given

candidates. To avoid having too many neg-
ative examples in our modified datasets, we
only consider sentences that contain at least
one candidate. To be more clear, each sample
from the CBT dataset is split to at most 20
samples – each sentence of the main sample
as long as it contains one of the candidates
(Trischler et al., 2016; Kadlec et al., 2016;
Cui et al., 2017; Dhingra et al., 2017; Ghaeini
et al., 2018a).

C Training

All hyper-parameters are tuned based on the de-
velopment set. We use pre-trained 300−D Glove
840B vectors (Pennington et al., 2014) to ini-
tialize our word embedding vectors. All hidden
states and feature sizes are 300 dimensions (d =
300). The weights are learned by minimizing the
cost function on the training data via Adam op-
timizer. The initial learning rate is 0.0001 and
λ = 0.5, 0.7, 0.4, and 0.35 for ACE, ERE, CBT-
NE, and CBT-CN respectively. To avoid overfit-
ting, we use dropout with a rate of 0.5 for regular-
ization, which is applied to all feedforward con-
nections. During training, the word embeddings
are updated to learn effective representations for
each task and dataset. We use a fairly small batch
size of 32 to provide more exploration power to
the model. Finally, Equation 4 indicates the the
cost function that is used for the training where
W , I , and Ddim are the word embeddings, Inter-
mediate representation, and Decision representa-

D Saliency Visualization

In this section, we empirically analyze the tradi-
tionally trained (Baseline Model) and the saliency-
trained model (saliency-trained Model) behaviour
by observing the saliency of 23 positive samples
from ACE and ERE datasets. Tables 6 and 7
show the top 6 salient words (words with high-
est saliency/gradient) of positive samples from
ACE or ERE dataset along with their contributory
word(s) (Z), the baseline model prediction (PB),
and the saliency-trained model prediction (PS).
Darker red color indicates more salient words. Our
observations could be divided into six categories
as follow:

• Samples 1-7: Both models correctly predict
1 for these samples. The saliency-trained
model successfully pays attention to the ex-
pected meaningful words while the base-
line model pays attention to mostly irrelevant
ones.

• Samples 8-11: Both models correctly pre-
dict 1 and pays attention to the contributory
words. Yet, we observe lower saliency for

important words and higher saliency for ir-
relevant ones.

• Samples 12-14: Here, the baseline model
fails to pay attention to the contributory
words and predicts 0 while the saliency-
trained model one successfully pays attention
to them and predicts 1.

• Samples 15-18: Although the models have
high saliency for the contributory words,
still they could not correctly disambiguate
these samples. This observation suggests
that having high saliency for important words
does not guarantee positive prediction. High
saliency for these words indicate their pos-
itive contribution toward the positive predic-
tion but still, the model might consider higher
probability for negative prediction.

• Samples 19-21: Here, only the baseline
model could correctly predict 1. However,
the baseline model does not pay attention to
the contributory words. In other words, the
explanation does not support the prediction
(unreliable).

• Samples 22-23: Not always the saliency-
trained model could pay proper attention to
the contributory words. In these examples,
the baseline model has high saliency for con-
tributory words. It is worth noting that when
the saliency-trained model does not have high
saliency for contributory words, it does not
predict 1. Such observation could suggest
that the saliency-trained model predictions
are more reliable. The aforementioned claim
is also verified by consistently obtaining no-
ticeably higher precision for all datasets and
tasks (Section 5.1 and Table 1 in the paper).
