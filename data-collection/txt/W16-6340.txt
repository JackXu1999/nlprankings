Abstract

This paper proposes an algorithm for find-
ing phonological phrase boundaries in
sentences with neutral focus spoken in
both normal and fast tempos. A perceptual
experiment is designed using Praat’s ex-
periment MFC program to investigate the
phonological phrase boundaries. Phono-
logical phrasing and its relation to syntac-
tic structure in the framework of the end-
based rules proposed by (Selkirk, 1986),
and relation to purely phonological rules,
i.e., the principle of increasing units pro-
posed by (Ghini, 1993) are investigated.
In addition to that, this paper explores
the acoustic cues signalling phonological
phrase boundaries in both normal and fast
tempos speech. It is found that phonolog-
ical phrasing in Hindi follows both end-
based rule (Selkirk, 1986) and the princi-
ple of increasing units (Ghini, 1993). The
end-based rules are used for phonological
phrasing and the principle of increasing
units is used for phonological phrase re-
structuring.

1 Introduction

A phonological phrase (φ-phrase) is a short
breathe group, which speakers sometimes shorten
or elongate (Ohala, 1978). The phonological rules
which apply across words are covered under the
domain of φ-phrase. Two important theories of φ-
phrasing—end-based theory (Selkirk, 1986) and
relation-based theory (Nespor and Vogel, 1986)
are the base works in this area. (Ghini, 1993)
proposed purely phonological rules for φ-phrasing
while the phrasing rules in (Hayes and Lahiri,
1991) are based on c-command relation.

The idea of Selkirk’s end based rule is based

on the syntactic constituents. According to which,
the right edge of each syntactic XP coincides
with the right edge of a φ-phrase. A syntactic
XP is a phrase where X represents the head of
that phrase. In short, end-based rule is written as
Align(XP, R, φ, R), i.e., the right edge of each
XP must be aligned to the right edge of φ-phrase
(Truckenbrodt, 1995). See the following examples
from (Truckenbrodt, 1995)

1.

a. [ V NP ]V P→ ( V NP )φ
e.g., (ingile mtana:ni)φ /entered the room/
b. [ V PP ]V P→ ( V PP )φ
e.g., (mapendo ya maski:ni)φ /the love of a poor

man/
c.[ N AP ]NP→ ( N AP )φ
e.g., (nthi:-khavu) / dry land/

2. [NP V]→ ( NP )φ ( V )φ
e.g., ( maski:ni ha:tali) /a poor man does not

choose/
3. For complex sentence having more than one
NP following phrasing pattern is applied.

a. [NP V NP]→ ( NP)φ ( V NP)φ
b. [NP NP]→ (NP)φ ( NP)φ
c. [V NP NP]→ (V NP)φ (NP)φ
(Ghini, 1993) proposed purely phonological

rules for φ-phrasing in Italian. He preferred bi-
nary branching over n-ary branching as proposed
in Nespor and Vogel. His claims are based on the
following observations.

a. φ-phrasing is related to the concept of
branching. The branching XPs are never re-
structured with its preceding branching phrases,
because the branching XPs are longer and con-
tain more phonological material than the non-
branching XPs.324



b. The XPs use concept of weight, like a branch-
ing XPs are heavy and non-branchings are light.
The heavy XPs contain more number of words
than the light XPs.

c. The φ-phrasing is purely phonological. A
string should be parsed into same length φs. By in-
creasing and decreasing the tempo the φ-phrase is
increased and decreased by one word respectively.

d. He has proposed the concept of phras-
ing based on increasing unit (prosodic word) in
a phrase, which is called principle of increasing
units. According to this principle, a preceding φ-
phrase should not have higher weight than the fol-
lowing φ-phrase.

The motivation for this work lies in the follow-
ing two points.

i. Phonological phrasing plays an important role
in language comprehension. The information of
φ-phrase boundaries is requisite in training data
for developing a text-to-speech synthesis system
with non-robotic voice quality. This work ful-
fills the requirement of φ-phrasing in Hindi text-
to-speech synthesis system development.

ii. The role of spectral peaks in phonological
phrasing as a predictor variable is investigated for
both normal and fast tempo speech.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 describes the experimental details. Sec-
tion 3 is the description of the algorithm for
phonological phrasing in Hindi. Section 4 de-
scribes the significant acoustic cues which signal
the phonological phrase boundary to the listeners.
The conclusion is written in section 5.

2 Experimental Details

This section describes linguistic data collection
and speech recording. It also describes the acous-
tic cues extracted for the analysis.

2.1 Linguistic Data

Fifty spoken sentences were selected for record-
ing. The sentences were a combination of sim-
ple and complex declarative. The smallest sen-
tence has four words, the largest sentence has fif-
teen words. The total count is 447 words in all
50 sentences. Ten speakers 5 males and 5 females
were recorded, resulting into a total of 500 sen-
tences. The speakers were either Delhite( born
and brought up in Delhi) or one who has been
studying in Delhi for the last 10 years. Each
speaker is given few minutes to get familiar es-

pecially with the long sentences to mitigate hesi-
tation while recording. If hesitation occurs for a
sentence; speakers were advised to repeat for that
sentence.

The sentences were recorded in two tem-
pos—normal and fast. Both the tempos were used
in neutral context only. The normal tempo for
this study is the rate at which a speaker normally
speaks. The recording was carried out in a noise
proof sound recording studio. The speech was
recorded at 44.1 kHz sampling rate and stored as
16 bits PCM data. The sentences for recording
were selected from news websites covering news
ranging from national to international, weather
forecast, sports and entertainment. The sentences
selected from these news websites were first cor-
rected for Unicode rendering and then used for the
recording.

2.2 Perceptual Experiment for φ-phrase
boundary

A perception based experiment is performed to
determine the φ-phrasing in Hindi. Ten persons
participated in the experiment who are the native
speakers of Hindi. Neither they have any for-
mal background in linguistics nor they were taught
about the phonological phrasing. The stimuli pre-
sented to the informants using the Praat’s experi-
ment MFC program. The response options were of
four possible types of φ-phrases for each sentence.
The reason for the limited number of possible re-
sponse types are the following.

a. There can be many logical options depending
upon the complexity of a sentence.

b. The best four plausible response choices are
used for each experiment which in turn is decided
by the expert.

The phrases were separated by square bracket.
The participant were told that the square bracket
denotes the short pause; click on the response
which suitably shows the short pause in the
stimuli. The participants were also asked to
choose the confidence measure ranging from 1(for
poor)—5(good). ”Replay” button can be used for
playing the same speech files again and again upto
10 times and ”OOPS” button is for listening to
the previous sound file. A test experiment having
seven files is run first, and participants are asked to
choose the suitable option. It is ensured that every
participant understood the experiment clearly. At
the end of the test experiment, they are asked two325



questions: 1—”Are you ok with the experiment?”
and 2—”Do you have any question to ask?”. The
actual set of fifty sentences for both tempos are
mixed randomly and run to each participant sep-
arately. The participants were advised to take a
break of 15 minutes after continuously listening
for 1 hour. The process completed in two days.
The average time taken by informants is 11 hours
and 42 minutes in two days. For clarity, see the
Figure 1.

All utterances are annotated by all 10 annotators
and the average pairwise kappa values are calcu-
lated for inter-informant agreement. The kappa
values for inter-informant agreement for normal
and fast tempo speech lie in the range of 0.7—0.9
and 0.6—0.7 respectively. The response option
getting highest agreement is picked up for the
analysis in both tempos. It is found that 2 sen-
tences have different phrasing patterns for normal
and fast tempos. Therefore, 2 × 10 (because the
same sentence was recorded by all 10 speakers)
are dropped and not analyzed in this study. The
remaining 480 sentences show same phonological
phrasing. The phonological phrasing rules based
on the phrasing patterns selected by participants
are presented in section 3.

2.3 Acoustic cues Extracted at φ-phrase
Boundaries

Nine acoustic cues are extracted from the pre-
boundary and the postboundary syllable of each
φ-phrase, for clarity see the Figure 2 & 3.

These acoustic cues include the variants of tem-
poral and spectral cues. These are the minimum
pitch at the start of a syllable (InF0Min), max pitch
(F0Max), minimum pitch in the end of a sylla-
ble (FiF0Min), mean intensity(AvgInt), minimum
intensity (MinInt), maximum intensity (MaxInt),
three spectral peaks at first, second and third for-
mants (SpecInt1, SpecInt2 and SpecInt3). The
acoustic cues pitch, intensity and duration are the
most accepted and investigated predictor variables
at phrase boundaries (Oller, 1973)(Streeter, 1978).
Duration is not included as an acoustic cue in
this experiment. Because, there are ample studies
which unanimously accepted it as a relevant cue
for the prosodic phrasing and prominence (Klatt,
1975)(Oller, 1973) (Lehiste and Lass, 1976) (Mac-
Donald, 1976) (Roy, 2014). Therefore, less es-
tablished acoustic cues are included in this study.
The objective is to investigate the relevance of new

acoustic cues in phonological phrasing rather than
reaffirming the importance of an already estab-
lished acoustic cue. In this investigation spectral
peaks are included as predictors because it sig-
nal perceptual stress(Sluijter et al., 1997) in an ut-
terance. All nine cues are extracted using Praat
software for speech signal analysis (Boersma and
Weenink, 2013). The analysis of the importance
of these cues in φ-phrasing is discussed in section
4.

3 Rules for φ-phrasing in Hindi

Hindi is a relatively free word order language. It
follows SOV (subject followed by an object and
then followed by a verb) structure. Based on the
data collected from the performance and percep-
tion based experiment presented in section 2.2, the
rules for φ are illustrated with examples. An into-
nation based analysis by (Patil et al., 2008) sug-
gests that each content word in Hindi could be
a prosodic phrase. The present analysis partially
disagree to (Patil et al., 2008) as explained below
(Parse tree is shown in Figure 4—7). See the fol-
lowing examples (the φ-phrases shown below for
each sentence is the same chosen by the partici-
pants during the perception experiment).

a. ra:m a:m kha:ta: hæ: / Ram eats a mango/

[ra:m]φ [a:m]φ [kha:ta: hæ:]φ (normal & fast
tempo)

b. si:ta: e:k ga:jika: hæ:. /Sita is a singer/
[sita:]φ [e:k ga:jika: hæ:]φ (normal & fast

tempo)

c. ra:m ne: si:ta: ko: kita:b di: /Ram gave a book
to Sita/

[ra:m -ne:]φ [si:ta: ko:]φ [kita:b di:]φ (normal
& fast tempo)

d. billi: m@mmi: ke: pi:tShe: bHa:gi: / Cat ran
behind the mother/

[billi:]φ [m@ mmi: ke: ]φ [pi:tShe: bHa:gi:] φ
In the above example (a), which is of type [NP

NP V] for which informants choose the phras-
ing pattern [NP]φ [NP]φ [V]φ. The example (b)
which is of the same pattern as of (a). However
the phrasing rules of (a) if applied on (b), the
phrases breaks into the length of 1+2+1. Such
phrasing patterns violate the principle of increas-
ing units and thus restructuring applies. And fi-
nally it becomes [NP]φ [NP V]φ; with phrase326

length in increasing pattern i.e., 1+3. Example
(b) also states that copula restructures itself with
preceding φ-phrase. The example (c) is same as
of the example (b), but differs on the category of
verb at ultimate position. In this case it is a main
verb and restructure itself with the preceding φ-
phrase. The most important one is the fourth ex-
ample (d), where the phrasing should be either
[NP]φ [PP]φ [V]φ or [NP]φ [NP]φ [P]φ [V]φ
but informants chose the phrasing pattern [NP]φ
[NP]φ [P V]φ. It concludes that the restructuring
takes place because both of the phrasing patterns
i.e 1+3+1 and 1+2+1+1 violates principle of in-
creasing units. Another important point need to

be highlighted here is that in the φ-phrase [P V]φ,
the postposition (P) modifies the verb. Therefore P
is no longer a postposition rather an adverb. Thus
the word pi:tShe: /behind/ in example (d), is a con-
tent word which along with another content word
constitutes a φ-phrase. There are many such ex-
amples in Hindi where a single content word does
not form a φ-phrase by itself rather restructure
with some other content word. This implies that
the process of φ-restructuring is of central signif-
icance in Hindi, and the claim that each content
word could be a φ-phrase seems feeble.

Algorithm: φ-phrasing
i. Parse the input sentence.
ii. Apply end based rule(Selkirk, 1986).
iii. If phrase are not in increasing units, restruc-

ture it using principle of increasing units (Ghini,
1993)

4 Significance of Acoustic cues in
φ-phrasing

The acoustic cues described in section 2.3 are an-
alyzed. One way ANOVA modeling is applied
at α=0.01. The φ-phrases are categorized into
three types like initial φ-phrase (PhInit), medial φ-
phrase (PhMed) and final φ-phrase (PhFin). The
acoustic cues become factors and three phrases
work as the level for ANOVA modeling.

The Table 1 and Table 2 describe the result of
ANOVA Modeling for both normal and fast tem-
pos speech respectively. The result indicates that
the different type of acoustic cues are responsible
for the φ-phrase break in normal and fast tempos,
even though their φ-phrases have same boundaries
for a sentence.

For normal tempo F0Max is the most significant
parameter and other two significant acoustic cues
are MaxInt and SpecInt1. The average difference
of 10.1 Hz—22.4 Hz (approx) is found for F0Max
at the φ-phrase boundaries. The comparison
of MaxInt at consecutive φ-phrase boundaries
shows that there is an average difference of
3dB—13.4 dB (approx) between the syllables at
preceding and succeeding φ-phrase at boundaries.
The noticed range of difference is significant,
which provides listeners a cue for break. The
significance of spectral peak at first formant (i.e.,
SpecInt1) states that intensity at higher frequency
too is an important factor in determining φ-phrase
boundary. SpecInt1 shows a significant difference328



at the boundary and difference lies in the range
of 3.8 dB to 22.6dB (approx). Such pattern infers
that each of these acoustic cues show declination
between two consecutive φ-phrase boundaries
as can be seen in Figure 2. The effect of dec-
lination in these acoustic cues are perceived as
a short break or φ-phrase boundary to the listeners.

For Fast tempo F0Max is the most significant
parameter and the other significant parameter is
FiF0Min. MaxInt and SpecInt1 are not the sig-
nificant parameters in fast tempo speech. F0Max
shows significant change at phrase boundaries as
in normal tempo, however it is not declination al-
ways. In other words, the next φ-phrase may have
higher F0Max then the preceding one. The aver-
age difference in F0Max at consecutive φ-phrase
boundaries lies in the range of 5.8 Hz to 16.9 Hz.
FiF0Min in fast tempo shows pitch reset phenom-
ena as can be seen in Figure 3. Each φ-phrase will
have different level of pitch range from the begin-
ning. The average difference for FiF0Min at con-
secutive φ-phrase boundaries are in the range of
8.6Hz—17.9Hz.

These results can be analyzed from different
perspective. One perspective is that both normal
and fast tempos show significant change in F0Max
at φ-phrase boundaries. In other words, phrase
break is signaled by the declining value in F0Max
in normal tempo speech, but both rise and decline
in F0Max are the factor signalling for φ-phrase
boundaries in fast tempo speech. Also in nor-
mal tempo speech at phrasal boundaries speakers
max intensity and spectral peak at first formant
show declination but in fast tempo this effect is
not found. Hence in normal tempo, speakers form
a negative slope for these intensities between two
adjacent boundaries. But in fast tempo speakers
keep their intensity value almost constant between
the adjacent boundaries.

5 Conclusion

The phonological phrasing in Hindi for a given
sentence is same irrespective of the rate of speech.
That is, both tempos yield same phonological
phrasing. The phonological phrase restructuring
rule in normal tempo follows the the principle of
increasing units by (Ghini, 1993). The acoustic
cues signaling phonological phrase boundary vary
for both tempos. The acoustic parameters F0Max,
MaxInt and SpecInt1 are the significant contrib-

utors for phonological phrasing in normal tempo
speech, but for fast tempo F0Max and FiF0Min
are the significant contributors for the phonologi-
cal phrasing.
