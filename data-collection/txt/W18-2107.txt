Abstract

We present an alternative method of eval-
uating Quality Estimation systems, which
is based on a linguistically-motivated Test
Suite. We create a test-set consisting of 14
linguistic error categories and we gather
for each of them a set of samples with both
correct and erroneous translations. Then,
we measure the performance of 5 Qual-
ity Estimation systems by checking their
ability to distinguish between the correct
and the erroneous translations. The de-
tailed results are much more informative
about the ability of each system. The fact
that different Quality Estimation systems
perform differently at various phenomena
confirms the usefulness of the Test Suite.

1 Introduction

The evaluation of empirical Natural Language
Processing (NLP) systems is a necessary task dur-
ing research for new methods and ideas. The eval-
uation task is the last one to come after the de-
velopment process and aims to indicate the overall
performance of the newly built system and com-
pare it against previous versions or other systems.
Additionally, it also allows for conclusions related
to the decisions taken for the development param-
eters and provides hints for improvement. Defin-
ing evaluation methods that satisfy the original de-
velopment requirements is an ongoing field of re-
search.

Automatic evaluation in sub-fields of Machine
Translation (MT) has been mostly performed on
given textual hypothesis sets, where the perfor-
mance of the system is measured against gold-
standard reference sets with one or more metrics
(Bojar et al., 2017). Despite the extensive research
on various automatic metrics and scoring meth-

ods, little attention has been paid to the actual con-
tent of the test-sets and how these can be adequate
for judging the output from a linguistic perspec-
tive. The text of most test-sets so far has been
drawn from various random sources and the only
characteristic that is controlled and reported is the
generic domain of the text.

In this paper we make an effort to demonstrate
the value of using a linguistically-motivated con-
trolled test-set (also known as a Test Suite) for
evaluation instead of generic test-sets. We will fo-
cus on the sub-field of sentence-level Quality Esti-
mation (QE) on MT and see how the evaluation of
QE on a Test Suite can provide useful information
concerning particular linguistic phenomena.

2 Related work

There have been few efforts to use a broadly-
defined Test Suite for the evaluation of MT, the
first of them being during the early steps of the
technology (King and Falkedal, 1990). Although
the topic has been recently revived (Isabelle et al.,
2017; Burchardt et al., 2017), all relevant research
so far applies only to the evaluation of MT output
and not of QE predictions.

Similar to MT output, predictions of sentence-
level QE have also been evaluated on test-sets con-
sisting of randomly drawn texts and a single met-
ric has been used to measure the performance over
the entire text (e.g. Bojar et al., 2017). There
has been criticism on the way the test-sets of the
shared tasks have been formed with regards to the
distribution of inputs (Anil and Fran, 2013), e.g.
when they demonstrate a dataset shift (Quionero-
Candela et al., 2009). Additionally, although there
has been a lot of effort to infuse linguistically mo-
tivated features in QE (Felice and Specia, 2012),
there has been no effort to evaluate their predic-
tions from a linguistic perspective. To the best

of our knowledge there has been no use of a Test
Suite in order to evaluate sentence-level QE, or to
inspect the predictions with regards to linguistic
categories or specific error types.

3 Method

The evaluation of QE presented in this paper is
based on these steps: (1) construction of the Test
Suite with respect to linguistic categories; (2) se-
lection of suitable Test Suite sentences; and (3)
analysis of the Test Suite by existing QE systems
and statistical evaluation of the predictions. These
steps are analysed below, whereas a simplified ex-
ample is given in Figure 1.

3.1 Construction of the Test Suite

The Test Suite has been developed by a profes-
sional linguist, supported by professional transla-
tors. First, the linguist gathers or creates error-
specific paradigms (Figure 1, stage a), i.e. sen-
tences whose translation has demonstrated or is
suspected to demonstrate systematic errors by
known MT engines. The aim is to have a repre-
sentative amount of paradigms per error type and
the paradigms are as short as possible in order to
focus solely on one phenomenon under examina-
tion. The error types are defined based on linguis-
tic categories inspired by the MQM error typol-
ogy (Lommel et al., 2014) and extend the error
types presented in Burchardt et al. (2017), with
additional fine-grained analysis of sub-categories.
The main categories for German-English can be
seen in Table 2.

Second, the paradigms are given to several MT
systems (Figure 1, stage b) to check whether they
are able to translate them properly , with the aim to
acquire a “pass” or a “fail” label accordingly. In an
effort to accelerate the acquisition of these labels,
we follow a semi-automatic annotation method us-
ing regular expressions. The regular expressions
allow a faster automatic labelling that focuses on
particular tokens expected to demonstrate the is-
sue, unaffected from alternative sentence formu-
lations. For each gathered source sentence the
linguist specifies regular expressions (Figure 1,
stage c) that focus on the particular issue: one pos-
itive regular expression that matches a successful
translation and gives a “pass” label and an optional
negative regular expression that matches an erro-
neous translation and gives a “fail” (for phenom-
ena such as ambiguity and false friends). The reg-

MT type proportion

neural 64.7%
phrase-based 26.8%
both (same output) 8.5%

Table 1: MT type for the translations participating
in the final pairwise test-set

ular expressions, developed and tested on the first
translation outputs, are afterwards applied to all
the alternative translation outputs (stage d) to ac-
quire the automatic labels (stage e). Further mod-
ifications to the regular expressions were applied,
if they did not properly match the new translation
outputs. The automatically assigned labels were
controlled in the end by a professional translator
and native speaker of the target language (stage f).
For the purposes of this analysis, we also assume
that every sentence paradigm only demonstrates
the error type that it has been chosen for and no
other major errors occur.

3.2 Selection of suitable Test Suite sentences

The next step is to transform the results so that
they can be evaluated by existing sentence-level
QE methods, since the Test Suite provides bi-
nary pass/fail values for the errors, whereas most
sentence-level QE methods predict a continuous
score. For this purpose, we transform the prob-
lem to a problem of predicting comparisons. We
deconstruct the alternative translations of every
source sentence into pairwise comparisons, and
we only keep the pairs that contain one success-
ful and one failing translation (Figure 1, stage g).
Sentence-level QE systems will be given every
pair of MT outputs and requested to predict a com-
parison, i.e. which of the two outputs is better
(stage h). Finally, the QE systems are evaluated
based on their capability to properly compare the
erroneous with the correct outputs (stage i). The
performance of the QE systems will be therefore
expressed in terms of the accuracy over the pair-
wise choices.

4.1 Data and systems

The current Test Suite contains about 5,500 source
sentences and their rules with regular expressions
for translating German to English. These rules
have been applied for evaluating 10,800 unique

MT outputs (MT outputs with the exact same text
have been merged together). These outputs have
been produced by three online commercial sys-
tems (2 state-of-the-art neural MT systems and
one phrase-based), plus the open-source neural
system by Sennrich et al. (2017). After creating
pairs of alternative MT outputs that have a differ-
ent label (Section 3.2) the final test-set contains
3,230 pairwise comparisons based on the transla-
tions of 1,582 source sentences. The MT types
of the translations participating in the final test-set
can be seen in Table 1.

For this comparative study we evaluate existing
QE systems that were freely available to train and
use. In particular we evaluate the baseline the fol-
lowing 6 systems:

• B17: The baseline of the shared task on
sentence-level QE (Bojar et al., 2017) based
on 17 black-box features and trained with
Support Vector Regression (SVR) to predict
continuous HTER values

• B13: the winning system of the shared task
on QE ranking (Bojar et al., 2013; Avramidis
and Popović, 2013) based on 10 features,
trained with Logistic Regression with Step-
wise Feature Selection in order to perform
ranking. Despite being old, this system was
chosen as it is the latest paradigm of Compar-
ative QE that has been extensively compared
with competitive methods in a shared task

• A17: three variations of the state-of-the-
art research on Comparative QE (Avramidis,
2017), all three trained with a Gradient
Boosting classifier. The basic system has the

same feature set as B13, the full system con-
tains a wide variety of 139 features and the
RFECV contains the 25 highest ranked fea-
tures from the full feature set, after running
Recursive Feature Elimination with an SVR
kernel.

The implementation was based on the open-source
tools Quest (Shah et al., 2013) and Qualita-
tive (Avramidis, 2016).

4.2 Results

Here we present the evaluation of the QE systems
when applied on the Test Suite. The accuracy
achieved by each of the 6 QE systems for the 14
error categories can be seen in Table 2.

First, it can be noted that the quantity of eval-
uated samples varies a lot and, although the orig-
inal aim was to have about 100 samples per cate-
gory, most of the neural outputs succeeded in the
translations of the issues and therefore were not
included in the test-set with the “pass/fail” com-
parisons. Obviously, conclusions for those error
categories with few samples cannot be guaranteed.

Second, one can see that the average scores
range between 52.1% and 57.5% (achieved by
B13) which are nevertheless relatively low. This
may be explained by the fact that all QE systems
have been developed in the previous years with the
focus on “real text” test-sets. The Test Suite on the
contrary is not representative of a real scenario and
has a different distribution than the one expected
from real data. Additionally, many of the linguis-
tic phenomena of the Test Suite may have few or
no occurrences on the development data of the QE
systems. Finally, all QE systems have been devel-

oped in the previous years with the focus on rule-
based or phrase-based statistical MT and therefore
their performance on MT output primarily from
neural systems is unpredictable.

We also report scores averaged not out of the
total amount of the samples, but instead giving
equal importance to each error category. These
scores indicate a different winner: the full system
of A17. However, due to the distributional shift
of the Test Suite, there is limited value in drawing
conclusions from average scores, since the aim of
the Test Suite is to provide a qualitative overview
of the particular linguistic phenomena.

When it comes to particular error categories,
the three systems B13, A17-basic and A17-full
seem to be complementary, achieving the high-
est score for 5 different error categories each.
The systems B17 and A17-RFECV lack a lot in
their performance. The highest category score
is achieved for the phenomenon of Composition
(compounds and phrasal verbs) by A17-basic, fol-
lowed by negation (albeit with very few samples)
at 76.9%. A17-basic is also very strong in ambi-
guity, achieving 73%. The 4 systems B13 and A17
perform much better concerning long-distance re-
lationships, which may be attributed to the parsing
and grammatical features they contain, as opposed
to the B17 which does not include parsing. Fi-
nally, A17-full does better with named entities and

terminology, possibly because its features include
alignment scores from IBM model 1.

We notice that verb tenses, aspects, moods
and types comprise a major error category which
contains more than 2,000 samples. This enables
us to look into the subcategories related to the
verbs. The performance of the systems for differ-
ent tenses can be seen in Table 3, where B17 and
B13 are the winning systems for 5 categories each.
The tense with the best performance is the future
II subjunctive II with a 78% accuracy by B13. De-
spite its success in the broad spectrum of error
categories, A17-full performs relatively poorly on
verb tenses.

Finally, Table 4 contains the accuracy scores for
verb types. A17-full does much better on verb
types, with the exception of the negated modal
which gets a surprising 70.3% accuracy from B17.

5 Conclusion and further work

In this paper we demonstrated the possibility of
performing evaluation of QE by testing its predic-
tions on a fine-grained error typology from a Test
Suite. In this way, rather than judging QE sys-
tems based on a single score, we were able to see
how each QE system performs with respect to par-
ticular error categories. The results indicate that
no system is a clear winner, with three out of the
5 QE systems to have complementary results for

systems with similar overall scores perform dif-
ferently at various phenomena confirms the use-
fulness of the Test Suite for understanding their
comparative performance.

Such linguistically-motivated evaluation can be
useful in many aspects. The development or im-
provement of QE systems may use the results
about the found errors in order to introduce new
related features. The development may also be
aided by testing these improvements on an isolated
development set.

Further work should include the expansion of
the Test Suite with more samples in the less-
populated categories and support for other lan-
guage pairs. Finally, we would ideally like to
broaden the comparison among QE systems, by
including other state-of-the-art ones that unfortu-
nately were not freely available to test.
