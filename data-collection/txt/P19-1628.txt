Abstract

Single document summarization has enjoyed
renewed interest in recent years thanks to the
popularity of neural network models and the
availability of large-scale datasets. In this pa-
per we develop an unsupervised approach ar-
guing that it is unrealistic to expect large-scale
and high-quality training data to be available
or created for different types of summaries,
domains, or languages. We revisit a popu-
lar graph-based ranking algorithm and mod-
ify how node (aka sentence) centrality is com-
puted in two ways: (a) we employ BERT, a
state-of-the-art neural representation learning
model to better capture sentential meaning and
(b) we build graphs with directed edges argu-
ing that the contribution of any two nodes to
their respective centrality is influenced by their
relative position in a document. Experimental
results on three news summarization datasets
representative of different languages and writ-
ing styles show that our approach outperforms
strong baselines by a wide margin.1

1 Introduction

Single-document summarization is the task of
generating a shorter version of a document while
retaining its most important content (Nenkova
et al., 2011). Modern neural network-based ap-
proaches (Nallapati et al., 2016; Paulus et al.,
2018; Nallapati et al., 2017; Cheng and Lapata,
2016; See et al., 2017; Narayan et al., 2018b;
Gehrmann et al., 2018) have achieved promis-
ing results thanks to the availability of large-
scale datasets containing hundreds of thousands of
document-summary pairs (Sandhaus, 2008; Her-
mann et al., 2015b; Grusky et al., 2018). Neverthe-
less, it is unrealistic to expect that large-scale and
high-quality training data will be available or cre-

ated for different summarization styles (e.g., high-
lights vs. single-sentence summaries), domains
(e.g., user- vs. professionally-written articles), and
languages.

It therefore comes as no surprise that unsuper-
vised approaches have been the subject of much
previous research (Marcu, 1997; Radev et al.,
2000; Lin and Hovy, 2002; Mihalcea and Tarau,
2004; Erkan and Radev, 2004; Wan, 2008; Wan
and Yang, 2008; Hirao et al., 2013; Parveen et al.,
2015; Yin and Pei, 2015; Li et al., 2017). A very
popular algorithm for extractive single-document
summarization is TextRank (Mihalcea and Tarau,
2004); it represents document sentences as nodes
in a graph with undirected edges whose weights
are computed based on sentence similarity. In or-
der to decide which sentence to include in the sum-
mary, a node’s centrality is often measured using
graph-based ranking algorithms such as PageRank
(Brin and Page, 1998).

In this paper, we argue that the centrality mea-
sure can be improved in two important respects.
Firstly, to better capture sentential meaning and
compute sentence similarity, we employ BERT
(Devlin et al., 2018), a neural representation learn-
ing model which has obtained state-of-the-art re-
sults on various natural language processing tasks
including textual inference, question answering,
and sentiment analysis. Secondly, we advocate
that edges should be directed, since the contribu-
tion induced by two nodes’ connection to their re-
spective centrality can be in many cases unequal.
For example, the two sentences below are seman-
tically related:

(1) Half of hospitals are letting patients jump
NHS queues for cataract surgery if they
pay for it themselves, an investigation has
revealed.

(2) Clara Eaglen, from the royal national in-

stitute of blind people, said: “It’s shame-
ful that people are being asked to consider
funding their own treatment when they are
entitled to it for free, and in a timely man-
ner on the NHS.”

Sentence (1) describes a news event while sen-
tence (2) comments on it. Sentence (2) would not
make much sense on its own, without the support
of the preceding sentence, whose content is more
central. Similarity as an undirected measure, can-
not distinguish this fundamental intuition which
is also grounded in theories of discourse struc-
ture (Mann and Thompson, 1988) postulating that
discourse units are characterized in terms of their
text importance: nuclei denote central segments,
whereas satellites denote peripheral ones.

We propose a simple, yet effective approach for
measuring directed centrality for single-document
summarization, based on the assumption that the
contribution of any two nodes’ connection to their
respective centrality is influenced by their relative
position. Position information has been frequently
used in summarization, especially in the news do-
main, either as a baseline that creates a summary
by selecting the first n sentences of the document
(Nenkova, 2005) or as a feature in learning-based
systems (Lin and Hovy, 1997; Schilder and Kon-
dadadi, 2008; Ouyang et al., 2010). We transform
undirected edges between sentences into directed
ones by differentially weighting them according
to their orientation. Given a pair of sentences in
the same document, one is looking forward (to
the sentences following it), and the other is look-
ing backward (to the sentences preceding it). For
some types of documents (e.g., news articles) one
might further expect sentences occurring early on
to be more central and therefore backward-looking
edges to have larger weights.

We evaluate the proposed approach on three
single-document news summarization datasets
representative of different languages, writing con-
ventions (e.g., important information is concen-
trated in the beginning of the document or dis-
tributed more evenly throughout) and summary
styles (e.g., verbose or more telegraphic). We ex-
perimentally show that position-augmented cen-
trality significantly outperforms strong baselines
(including TextRank; Mihalcea and Tarau 2004)
across the board. In addition, our best system
achieves performance comparable to supervised
systems trained on hundreds of thousands of ex-

amples (Narayan et al., 2018b; See et al., 2017).
We present an alternative to more data-hungry
models, which we argue should be used as a
standard comparison when assessing the merits
of more sophisticated supervised approaches over
and above the baseline of extracting the leading
sentences (which our model outperforms).

Taken together, our results indicate that directed
centrality improves the selection of salient con-
tent substantially. Interestingly, its significance
for unsupervised summarization has gone largely
unnoticed in the research community. For ex-
ample, gensim (Barrios et al., 2016), a widely
used open-source implementation of TextRank
only supports building undirected graphs, even
though follow-on work (Mihalcea, 2004) experi-
ments with position-based directed graphs similar
to ours. Moreover, our approach highlights the ef-
fectiveness of pretrained embeddings for the sum-
marization task, and their promise for the develop-
ment of unsupervised methods in the future. We
are not aware of any previous neural-based ap-
proaches to unsupervised single-document sum-
marization, although some effort has gone into de-
veloping unsupervised models for multi-document
summarization using reconstruction objectives (Li
et al., 2017; Ma et al., 2016; Chu and Liu, 2018).

2 Centrality-based Summarization

2.1 Undirected Text Graph
A prominent class of approaches in unsupervised
summarization uses graph-based ranking algo-
rithms to determine a sentence’s salience for inclu-
sion in the summary (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004;
Erkan and Radev, 2004). A document (or a clus-
ter of documents) is represented as a graph, in
which nodes correspond to sentences and edges
between sentences are weighted by their similar-
ity. A node’s centrality can be measured by sim-
ply computing its degree or running a ranking al-
gorithm such as PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998).

For single-document summarization, let D de-
note a document consisting of a sequence of sen-
tences {s1, s2, ..., sn}, and eij the similarity score
for each pair (si, sj). The degree centrality for
sentence si can be defined as:

centrality(si) =
∑

j∈{1,..,i−1,i+1,..,n}

eij (1)

After obtaining the centrality score for each sen-
tence, sentences are sorted in reverse order and the



6238

top ranked ones are included in the summary.

TextRank (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004) adopts
PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998) to compute node
centrality recursively based on a Markov chain
model. Whereas degree centrality only takes local
connectivity into account, PageRank assigns rela-
tive scores to all nodes in the graph based on the
recursive principle that connections to nodes hav-
ing a high score contribute more to the score of the
node in question. Compared to degree centrality,
PageRank can in theory be better since the global
graph structure is considered. However, we only
observed marginal differences in our experiments
(see Sections 4 and 5 for details).

2.2 Directed Text Graph

The idea that textual units vary in terms of
their importance or salience, has found sup-
port in various theories of discourse structure in-
cluding Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST; Mann
and Thompson 1988). RST is a compositional
model of discourse structure, in which elementary
discourse units are combined into progressively
larger discourse units, ultimately covering the en-
tire document. Discourse units are linked to each
other by rhetorical relations (e.g., Contrast, Elab-
oration) and are further characterized in terms of
their text importance: nuclei denote central seg-
ments, whereas satellites denote peripheral ones.
The notion of nuclearity has been leveraged exten-
sively in document summarization (Marcu, 1997,
1998; Hirao et al., 2013) and in our case provides
motivation for taking directionality into account
when measuring centrality.

We could determine nuclearity with the help of
a discourse parser (Li et al. 2016; Feng and Hirst
2014; Joty et al. 2013; Liu and Lapata 2017, inter
alia) but problematically such parsers rely on the
availability of annotated corpora as well as a wider
range of standard NLP tools which might not exist
for different domains, languages, or text genres.
We instead approximate nuclearity by relative po-
sition in the hope that sentences occurring earlier
in a document should be more central. Given any
two sentences si, sj (i < j) taken from the same
document D, we formalize this simple intuition
by transforming the undirected edge weighted by
the similarity score eij between si and sj into
two directed ones differentially weighted by λ1eij
and λ2eij . Then, we can refine the centrality score

of si based on the directed graph as follows:

centrality(si) = λ1
∑
j<i

eij + λ2
∑
j>i

eij (2)

where λ1, λ2 are different weights for forward-
and backward-looking directed edges. Note that
when λ1 and λ1 are equal to 1, Equation (2) be-
comes degree centrality. The weights can be tuned
experimentally on a validation set consisting of
a small number of documents and corresponding
summaries, or set manually to reflect prior knowl-
edge about how information flows in a document.
During tuning experiments, we set λ1 + λ2 = 1 to
control the number of free hyper-parameters. In-
terestingly, we find that the optimal λ1 tends to
be negative, implying that similarity with previ-
ous content actually hurts centrality. This obser-
vation contrasts with existing graph-based sum-
marization approaches (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004;
Mihalcea, 2004) where nodes typically have either
no edge or edges with positive weights. Although
it is possible to use some extensions of PageR-
ank (Kerchove and Dooren, 2008) to take negative
edges into account, we leave this to future work
and only consider the definition of centrality from
Equation (6) in this paper.

3 Sentence Similarity Computation

The key question now is how to compute the sim-
ilarity between two sentences. There are many
variations of the similarity function of TextRank
(Barrios et al., 2016) based on symbolic sentence
representations such as tf-idf. We instead em-
ploy a state-of-the-art neural representation learn-
ing model. We use BERT (Devlin et al., 2018)
as our sentence encoder and fine-tune it based on
a type of sentence-level distributional hypothesis
(Harris, 1954; Polajnar et al., 2015) which we ex-
plain below. Fine-tuned BERT representations are
subsequently used to compute the similarity be-
tween sentences in a document.

3.1 BERT as Sentence Encoder
We use BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Represen-
tations from Transformers; Devlin et al. 2018)
to map sentences into deep continuous repre-
sentations. BERT adopts a multi-layer bidi-
rectional Transformer encoder (Vaswani et al.,
2017) and uses two unsupervised prediction tasks,
i.e., masked language modeling and next sentence
prediction, to pre-train the encoder.



6239

The language modeling task aims to predict
masked tokens by jointly conditioning on both left
and right context, which allows pre-trained repre-
sentations to fuse both contexts in contrast to con-
ventional uni-directional language models. Sen-
tence prediction aims to model the relationship
between two sentences. It is a binary classifica-
tion task, essentially predicting whether the sec-
ond sentence in a sentence pair is indeed the next
sentence. Pre-trained BERT representations can
be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer
to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range
of tasks, such as question answering and language
inference. We use BERT to encode sentences for
unsupervised summarization.

3.2 Sentence-level Distributional Hypothesis

To fine-tune the BERT encoder, we exploit a type
of sentence-level distributional hypothesis (Harris,
1954; Polajnar et al., 2015) as a means to define
a training objective. In contrast to skip-thought
vectors (Kiros et al., 2015) which are learned by
reconstructing the surrounding sentences of an
encoded sentence, we borrow the idea of nega-
tive sampling from word representation learning
(Mikolov et al., 2013). Specifically, for a sen-
tence si in document D, we take its previous sen-
tence si−1 and its following sentence si+1 to be
positive examples, and consider any other sen-
tence in the corpus to be a negative example. The
training objective for si is defined as:

log σ(v′si−1
>
vsi) + log σ(v

′
si+1
>
vsi)

+Es∼P (s)
[

log σ(−v′s
>
vs)] (3)

where vs and v′s are two different representa-
tions of sentence s via two differently parameter-
ized BERT encoders; σ is the sigmoid function;
and P (s) is a uniform distribution defined over the
sentence space.

The objective in Equation (3) aims to distin-
guish context sentences from other sentences in
the corpus, and the encoder is pushed to capture
the meaning of the intended sentence in order to
achieve that. We sample five negative samples for
each positive example to approximate the expecta-
tion. Note, that this approach is much more com-
putationally efficient, compared to reconstructing
surrounding sentences (Kiros et al., 2015).

Table 1: Statistics on NYT, CNN/Daily Mail, and
TTNews datasets (test set). We compute the average
document and summary length in terms of number of
words and sentences, respectively.

3.3 Similarity Matrix
Once we obtain representations {v1, v2, ..., vn} for
sentences {s1, s2, . . . , sn} in documentD, we em-
ploy pair-wise dot product to compute an unnor-
malized similarity matrix Ē:

Ēij = vi
>vj (4)

We could also use cosine similarity, but we empir-
ically found that the dot product performs better.

The final normalized similarity matrix E is de-
fined based on Ē:

Ẽij = Ēij −
[

min Ē + β(max Ē−min Ē)
]

(5)

Eij =

{
Ẽij if Ẽij > 0
0 otherwise

(6)

Equation (5) aims to remove the effect of absolute
values by emphasizing the relative contribution of
different similarity scores. This is particularly im-
portant for the adopted sentence representations
which in some cases might assign very high values
to all possible sentence pairs. Hyper-parameter β
(β ∈ [0, 1]) controls the threshold below which
the similarity score is set to 0.

4 Experimental Setup

In this section we present our experimental setup
for evaluating our unsupervised summarization
approach which we call PACSUM as a short-
hand for Position-Augmented Centrality based
Summarization.

4.1 Datasets
We performed experiments on three recently re-
leased single-document summarization datasets
representing different languages, document infor-
mation distribution, and summary styles. Table 1
presents statistics on these datasets (test set); ex-
ample summaries are shown in Table 5.

The CNN/DailyMail dataset (Hermann et al.,
2015a) contains news articles and associated high-
lights, i.e., a few bullet points giving a brief



6240

overview of the article. We followed the stan-
dard splits for training, validation, and testing used
by supervised systems (90,266/1,220/1,093 CNN
documents and 196,961/12,148/10,397 DailyMail
documents). We did not anonymize entities.

The LEAD-3 baseline (selecting the first three
sentences in each document as the summary)
is extremely difficult to beat on CNN/DailyMail
(Narayan et al., 2018b,a), which implies that
salient information is mostly concentrated in the
beginning of a document. NYT writers follow less
prescriptive guidelines2, and as a result salient in-
formation is distributed more evenly in the course
of an article (Durrett et al., 2016). We therefore
view the NYT annotated corpus (Sandhaus, 2008)
as complementary to CNN/DailyMail in terms of
evaluating the model’s ability of finding salient in-
formation. We adopted the training, validation and
test splits (589,284/32,736/32,739) widely used
for evaluating abstractive summarization systems.
However, as noted in Durrett et al. (2016), some
summaries are extremely short and formulaic (es-
pecially those for obituaries and editorials), and
thus not suitable for evaluating extractive summa-
rization systems. Following Durrett et al. (2016),
we eliminate documents with summaries shorter
than 50 words. As a result, the NYT test set
contains longer and more elaborate summary sen-
tences than CNN/Daily Mail (see Table 1).

Finally, to showcase the applicability of our ap-
proach across languages, we also evaluated our
model on TTNews (Hua et al., 2017), a Chinese
news summarization corpus, created for the shared
summarization task at NLPCC 2017. The cor-
pus contains a large set of news articles and cor-
responding human-written summaries which were
displayed on the Toutiao app (a mobile news app).
Because of the limited display space on the mo-
bile phone screen, the summaries are very concise
and typically contain just one sentence. There are
50,000 news articles with summaries and 50,000
news articles without summaries in the training
set, and 2,000 news articles in test set.

4.2 Implementation Details
For each dataset, we used the documents in the
training set to fine-tune the BERT model; hyper-
parameters (λ1, λ2, β) were tuned on a validation
set consisting of 1,000 examples with gold sum-

maries, and model performance was evaluated on
the test set.

We used the publicly released BERT model3

(Devlin et al., 2018) to initialize our sentence en-
coder. English and Chinese versions of BERT
were respectively used for the English and Chinese
corpora. As mentioned in Section 3.2, we fine-
tune BERT using negative sampling; we randomly
sample five negative examples for every positive
one to create a training instance. Each mini-batch
included 20 such instances, namely 120 examples.
We used Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) as our op-
timizer with initial learning rate set to 4e-6.

5 Results

5.1 Automatic Evaluation

We evaluated summarization quality automati-
cally using ROUGE F1 (Lin and Hovy, 2003).
We report unigram and bigram overlap (ROUGE-1
and ROUGE-2) as a means of assessing infor-
mativeness and the longest common subsequence
(ROUGE-L) as a means of assessing fluency.

NYT and CNN/Daily Mail Table 2 summa-
rizes our results on the NYT and CNN/Daily
Mail corpora (examples of system output can be
found in the Appendix). We forced all extrac-
tive approaches to select three summary sentences
for fair comparison. The first block in the ta-
ble includes two state-of-the-art supervised mod-
els. REFRESH (Narayan et al., 2018b) is an ex-
tractive summarization system trained by glob-
ally optimizing the ROUGE metric with rein-
forcement learning. POINTER-GENERATOR (See
et al., 2017) is an abstractive summarization sys-
tem which can copy words from the source text
while retaining the ability to produce novel words.
As an upper bound, we also present results with an
extractive oracle system. We used a greedy algo-
rithm similar to Nallapati et al. (2017) to generate
an oracle summary for each document. The algo-
rithm explores different combinations of sentences
and generates an oracle consisting of multiple sen-
tences which maximize the ROUGE score against
the gold summary.

The second block in Table 2 presents the results
of the LEAD-3 baseline (which simply creates a
summary by selecting the first three sentences in
a document) as well as various instantiations of

TEXTRANK (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004). Specif-
ically, we experimented with three sentence rep-
resentations to compute sentence similarity. The
first one is based on tf-idf where the value of the
corresponding dimension in the vector representa-
tion is the number of occurrences of the word in
the sentence times the idf (inverse document fre-
quency) of the word. Following gensim, We pre-
processed sentences by removing function words
and stemming words. The second one is based on
the skip-thought model (Kiros et al., 2015) which
exploits a type of sentence-level distributional hy-
pothesis to train an encoder-decoder model try-
ing to reconstruct the surrounding sentences of
an encoded sentence. We used the publicly re-
leased skip-thought model5 to obtain vector rep-
resentations for our task. The third one is based
on BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) fine-tuned with the
method proposed in this paper. Finally, to deter-
mine whether the performance of PageRank and
degree centrality varies in practice, we also in-
clude a graph-based summarizer with DEGREE
centrality and tf-idf representations.

The third block in Table 2 reports results with
three variants of our model, PACSUM. These
include sentence representations based on tf-idf,
skip-thought vectors, and BERT. Recall that PAC-
SUM uses directed degree centrality to decide
which sentence to include in the summary. On
both NYT and CNN/Daily Mail datasets, PAC-

than those reported in the original paper, because we extract
3 sentences in Daily Mail rather than 4.

Optimal hyper-parameters (λ1, λ2, β) are (−2, 1, 0.6).

SUM (with BERT representations) achieves the
highest ROUGE F1 score, compared to other un-
supervised approaches. This gain is more pro-
nounced on NYT where the gap between our best
system and LEAD-3 is approximately 6 abso-
lute ROUGE-1 F1 points. Interestingly, despite
limited access to only 1,000 examples for hyper-
parameter tuning, our best system is compara-
ble to supervised systems trained on hundreds of
thousands of examples (see rows REFRESH and
POINTER-GENERATOR in the table).

As can be seen in Table 2, DEGREE (tf-idf) is
very close to TEXTRANK (tf-idf). Due to space
limitations, we only show comparisons between
DEGREE and TEXTRANK with tf-idf, however,
we observed similar trends across sentence rep-
resentations. These results indicate that consid-
ering global structure does not make a differ-
ence when selecting salient sentences for NYT
and CNN/Daily Mail, possibly due to the fact

ferentially weighting a connection’s contribution
(via relative position) has a huge impact on perfor-
mance (ROUGE ranges from 0.30 to 0.40). In ad-
dition, the optimal λ1 is negative, suggesting that
similarity with the previous content actually hurts
centrality in this case.

We also observed that PACSUM improves fur-
ther when equipped with the BERT encoder. This
validates the superiority of BERT-based sentence
representations (over tf-idf and skip-thought vec-
tors) in capturing sentence similarity for unsuper-
vised summarization. Interestingly, TEXTRANK
performs worse with BERT. We believe that this
is caused by the problematic centrality definition,
which fails to fully exploit the potential of continu-
ous representations. Overall, PACSUM obtains im-
provements over baselines on both datasets high-
lighting the effectiveness of our approach across
writing styles (highlights vs. summaries) and nar-
rative conventions. For instance, CNN/Daily Mail
articles often follow the inverted pyramid format
starting with the most important information while
NYT articles are less prescriptive attempting to
pull the reader in with an engaging introduction
and develop from there to explain a topic.

evaluation metric. We report results with vari-
ants of TEXTRANK (tf-idf) and PACSUM (BERT)
which performed best on NYT and CNN/Daily
Mail. Since summaries in the TTNews corpus
are typically one sentence long (see Table 1), we
also limit our extractive systems to selecting a
single sentence from the document. The LEAD
baseline also extracts the first document sentence,
while the ORACLE selects the sentence with max-
imum ROUGE score against the gold summary in
each document. We use the popular POINTER-
GENERATOR system of See et al. (2017) as a com-
parison against supervised methods.

The results in Table 3 show that POINTER-
GENERATOR is superior to unsupervised meth-
ods, and even comes close to the extractive ora-
cle, which indicates that TTNews summaries are
more abstractive compared to the English corpora.
Nevertheless, even in this setting which disadvan-
tages extractive methods, PACSUM outperforms
LEAD and TEXTRANK showing that our approach
is generally portable across different languages
and summary styles. Finally, we show some ex-
amples of system output for the three datasets in
Appendix.

5.2 Human Evaluation

In addition to automatic evaluation using ROUGE,
we also evaluated system output by eliciting hu-
man judgments. Specifically, we assessed the
degree to which our model retains key informa-
tion from the document following a question-
answering (QA) paradigm which has been pre-
viously used to evaluate summary quality and
document compression (Clarke and Lapata, 2010;
Narayan et al., 2018b). We created a set of ques-
tions based on the gold summary under the as-
sumption that it highlights the most important doc-
ument content. We then examined whether partici-

NYT
Gold Summary: Marine Corps says that V-22 Osprey, hybrid aircraft with troubled past, will be sent to Iraq in September,
where it will see combat for first time. The Pentagon has placed so many restrictions on how it can be used in combat that plane
– which is able to drop troops into battle like helicopter and then speed away like airplane – could have difficulty fulfilling
marines longstanding mission for it. limitations on v-22, which cost $80 million apiece, mean it can not evade enemy fire with
same maneuvers and sharp turns used by helicopter pilots.
Questions: • Which aircraft will be sent to Iraq? V-22 Osprey

• What are the distinctive features of this type of aircraft? able to drop troops into battle like helicopter and then
speed away like airplane

• How much does each v-22 cost? $80 million apiece

pants were able to answer these questions by read-
ing system summaries alone without access to the
article. The more questions a system can answer,
the better it is at summarizing the document.

For CNN/Daily Mail, we worked on the
same 20 documents and associated 71 questions
used in Narayan et al. (2018b). For NYT, we ran-
domly selected 18 documents from the test set and
created 59 questions in total. For TTNews, we ran-
domly selected 50 documents from the test set and
created 50 questions in total. Example questions
(and answers) are shown in Table 5.

We compared our best system PACSUM (BERT)
against REFRESH, LEAD-3, and ORACLE on
CNN/Daily Mail and NYT, and against LEAD-3
and ORACLE on TTNews. Note that we did not
include TEXTRANK in this evaluation as it per-
formed worse than LEAD-3 in previous experi-
ments (see Tables 2 and 3). Five participants an-
swered questions for each summary. We used
the same scoring mechanism from Narayan et al.
(2018b), i.e., a correct answer was marked with a
score of one, partially correct answers with a score
of 0.5, and zero otherwise. The final score for
a system is the average of all its question scores.
Answers for English examples were elicited using
Amazon’s Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing plat-
form while answers for Chinese summaries were
assessed by in-house native speakers of Chinese.
We uploaded the data in batches (one system at
a time) on AMT to ensure that the same partici-
pant does not evaluate summaries from different

systems on the same set of questions.
The results of our QA evaluation are shown in

Table 4. ORACLE’s performance is below 100,
indicating that extracting sentences by maximiz-
ing ROUGE fails in many cases to select salient
content, capturing surface similarity instead. PAC-
SUM significantly outperforms LEAD but is worse
than ORACLE which suggests there is room for
further improvement. Interestingly, PACSUM per-
forms on par with REFRESH (the two systems are
not significantly different).

6 Conclusions

In this paper, we developed an unsupervised sum-
marization system which has very modest data re-
quirements and is portable across different types
of summaries, domains, or languages. We re-
visited a popular graph-based ranking algorithm
and refined how node (aka sentence) centrality is
computed. We employed BERT to better cap-
ture sentence similarity and built graphs with di-
rected edges arguing that the contribution of any
two nodes to their respective centrality is influ-
enced by their relative position in a document. Ex-
perimental results on three news summarization
datasets demonstrated the superiority of our ap-
proach against strong baselines. In the future, we
would like to investigate whether some of the ideas
introduced in this paper can improve the perfor-
mance of supervised systems as well as sentence
selection in multi-document summarization.

A.1 Examples of System Output
Table 6 shows examples of system output. Specif-
ically, we show summaries produced from GOLD,
LEAD, TEXTRANK and PACSUM for test doc-
uments in NYT, CNN/Daily Mail and TTNews.
GOLD is the gold summary associated with
each document; LEAD extracts the first docu-
ment sentences; TextRank (Mihalcea and Tarau,
2004) adopts PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998) to
compute node centrality recursively based on a
Markov chain model; PACSUM is position aug-
mented centrality based summarization approach
introduced in this paper.

dicted the marines will use the v-22 to ferry
troops from one relatively safe spot to an-
other, like a flying truck.
In December 2000, four more marines, in-
cluding the program’s most experienced
pilot, were killed in a crash caused by a
burst hydraulic line and software problems.

A day earlier, Strachan, the jury
foreperson, announced the first-
degree murder conviction in the
2013 shooting death of Hernandez’s
onetime friend Odin Lloyd.
Before the trial, at least one juror
– Rosalie Oliver – had n’t heard
of the 25-year-old defendant who
has now gone from a $ 40 million
pro-football contract to a term of
life without parole in a maximum-
security prison.
Rosalie Oliver – the juror who had
n’t heard of Hernandez before the
trial – said that, for her, the first shot
was enough.

million euros to introduce Illarra-

Ancelotti that he could not get
a good chance in Real Madrid.
Now the head coach has changed
to Benitez. The situation has not
changed.)

the Marine Corps said yesterday that the V-
22 Osprey, a hybrid aircraft with a troubled
past, will be sent to Iraq this September,
where it will see combat for the first time.
But because of a checkered safety record in
test flights, the v-22 will be kept on a short
leash.
The Pentagon has placed so many restric-
tions on how it can be used in combat that
the plane – which is able to drop troops into
battle like a helicopter and then speed away
from danger like an airplane – could have
difficulty fulfilling the marines ’ longstand-
ing mission for it.

(CNN) After deliberating for more
than 35 hours over parts of seven
days, listening intently to the tes-
timony of more than 130 witnesses
and reviewing more than 400 pieces
of evidence, the teary-eyed men and
women of the jury exchanged em-
braces.
Since late January, their work in the
Massachusetts murder trial of for-
mer NFL star Aaron Hernandez had
consumed their lives.
It was nothing like “Law & Order.”

bled past, will be sent to Iraq this Septem-

standing mission for it.
The limitations on the V-22, which cost
$80 million apiece, mean it cannot evade
enemy fire with the same maneuvers and
sharp turns used by helicopter pilots.

”It ’s been an incredibly emotional
toll on all of us.” Lesa Strachan told
CNN ’s Anderson Cooper Thursday
in the first nationally televised inter-
view with members of the jury.
