Abstract

This paper describes the Rouletabille partic-
ipation to the Hyperpartisan News Detection
task. We propose the use of different text clas-
sification methods for this task. Preliminary
experiments using a similar collection used in
Potthast et al. (2018) show that neural-based
classification methods reach state-of-the art re-
sults. Our final submission is composed of a
unique run that ranks among all runs at 3/49
position for the by-publisher test dataset and
43/96 for the by-article test dataset in terms of
Accuracy.

1 Introduction

Printed press have been in the last decades the
main way to access to news in written format.
This tendency is changing with the appearance of
online channels but usually the main factors of
the journalistic content generation are still there:
events, journalists, and editors. One of the prob-
lems of the generation of this content is the influ-
ence of each factor in the veracity of the generated
content. Two main factors may influence the final
view of an article: writer’s preferences and affilia-
tion of the editor house.

Identifying partisan preferences in news, based
only on text content, has been shown to be a chal-
lenging task (Potthast et al., 2018). This problem
requires to identify if a news article was written in
such a way that it includes an overrated apprecia-
tion of one of the participants in the news (a polit-
ical party, a person, a company, etc.). Despite the
fact that sharply polarized documents are not nec-
essarily fake, it is an early problem to solve for the
identification of fake content. A recent paper (Pot-
thast et al., 2018) claims that stylometric features
are a key factor to tackle this task.

In this paper, we present the description of our
participation to the Hyperpartisan classification

task at SemEval-2019 (Kiesel et al., 2019). This
task was composed of two subtasks, the first con-
sist to identify hyperpartisan bias in documents
classified by its individual content (bias of the
writer or by-article category) and the second by
the editorial house that published the article (bias
of the editorial house or by-publisher category) as
depicted in Figure 11. To address this problem,
we experimented with well-known models based
on deep learning (Honnibal and Montani, 2017;
Kim, 2014). They achieve state-of-the-art results
on a publicly available collection (Potthast et al.,
2018), showing that neural models can effectively
address the task of hyperpartisan detection with-
out including stylometric features. Our final sub-
mission ranked in the top-3 for the by-publisher
category, and 43/96 for the by-article category (or
21/42 in the official ranking).

2 Classification Models

We have considered that the hyperpartisan classifi-
cation task can be addressed as a binary classifica-
tion task where only two classes (’hyperpartisan’
and ’mainstream’).

Three different models were considered for our
participation. The first of them is based on a
classical document-level representation and the

Kiesel et al. (2019)

other two are based on word-level representations
through the use of word embedding. All of them
can be seen as baselines and no specific adaptation
to the dataset2 was performed.3

2.1 TF-IDF + Adaboost

For this model we represented our documents us-
ing the classical TF-IDF representation. Finally,
the Adaboost classifier (Freund and Schapire,
1997) is used under the default configuration.
Note that this is a very basic baseline, as it does
not use recent representation techniques such as
word embeddings.

2.2 SpaCy Model

In this case, we used the SpaCy (Honnibal and
Montani, 2017) library4. We used the text cate-
gorisation algorithm implemented in SpaCy which
is based on the hierarchical attention network pro-
posed in Yang et al. (2016). The main improve-
ment to the original model is the use of hash-
based embeddings. We only defined two hyper-
parameters for the model: number of epochs and
dropout rate. These parameters were set to 3 and
0.2, respectevelly.5

2.3 Convolutional Model

We also tested the neural classification model pro-
posed by Kim (2014). This model uses convolu-
tional neural networks that are finally reduced to a
binary classification. This method is known as a
highly competitive classification model for short
documents. As SpaCy, this model is based on
word embeddings representation. However, in this
case we preferred to use the pre-calculated embed-
dings of GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014). Hyper-
parameters were defined using the training data.

3 Experiments and Results

3.1 Experimental Setup

Experiments were performed using two collec-
tions, the ACL2018 collection (Potthast et al.,
2018) and the SemEval19 collection (Potthast
et al., 2019). The first collection is composed of
1627 articles including 801 hyperpartisan and 826

fiers.

3Further experiments were performed using network-
based models but as results did not show improvement in an
existing collection, we decided to not include these results.

mainstream manually annotated documents. As
this collection is not originally split in training-test
sets, results are presented using cross-validation.
The second collection was split in train, valida-
tion, and test sets for the by-publisher category,
and in train and test for the by-article category as
presented in Table 1. Results in this second col-
lection are exclusively calculated using the TIRA
evaluation system (Potthast et al., 2019).

In order to determine the best configuration to
our participation using the SemEval collection, we
decided to perform experiments and fix hyperpa-
rameters using the ACL2018 collection.

3.2 Results in the ACL2018 Collection

Table 2 reported results of the 3 classification
models presented in section 2 (lines labelled TF-
IDF+Adaboost, SpaCy and CNN-Kim), as well as
results of the approach presented in Potthast et al.
(2018) (line labelled ACL18), on the ACL2018
collection.

We only used the first fold produced by the au-
thors’ code6. As our results are not directly com-
parable with the values reported in Potthast et al.
(2018), we re-evaluated their approach on this sin-
gle fold.

Values of the three F-measures were calculated
with sklearn7. Note that in binary classification,
micro F-measure values are equivalent to accuracy
values.

Two state-of-the-art models (SpaCy and Kim
(2014)) outperform the approach presented in Pot-
thast et al. (2018), showing that stylometric fea-
tures are probably not necessary for the task.

3.3 Results in the Semeval2019 Collection

Experiments on the official collection were per-
formed through the use of TIRA (Potthast et al.,
2019)8. As our previous experiments have not
shown clear improvement with the convolutional
model, we submitted our official runs using

SpaCy: it can be seen as an ’easy-to-implement’
but strong baseline. The same model was trained
on the by-publisher training set for both submis-
sions (on the by-publisher and by-article dataset).

Tables 3 and 4 respectively present official
results on the by-publisher9 and the by-article
datasets.

One can see that relative results (i.e. regarding
the official ranking) are strongly better on the by-
publisher dataset than on the by-article one. This
can be easily explained by the fact that collections
were differently annotated.

If we now compare accuracy scores of the
SpaCy model between the ACL2018 collection
and the SemEval2019 one, we can notice a de-
crease in performance (0.6640 vs 0.8091 on the

by-publisher dataset for example), leading us to
think that there exist some differences between the
two collections. Both collections seem to be com-
plementary for the evaluation of hyperpartisan de-
tection.

Another important observation is that the SpaCy
model performs remarkably well on the by-
publisher set, although not specifically tuned for
the hyperpartisan detection task. Indeed, we are
ranked first on the F1 metric, and 3rd on the Ac-
curacy one. Some other experiments are needed to
get a fine-tuned model for the task, but this version
can already be considered as a strong baseline for
the by-publiser subtask.

4 Conclusion

Our experiments and participation to the Hyper-
partisan task led us to conclude that:

• stylometric features seem not to be neces-
sary to achieve state-of-the-art results for hy-
perpartisan detection in the ACL2018 collec-
tion. This deserves a set of extra experi-
ments to better understand the real contribu-
tion of stylometric features when combined
with strong representations/classifiers to val-
idate the work of Potthast et al. (2018).

• a state-of-the-art classification model in its
default configuration (SpaCy) can be con-
sidered as a strong baseline for next exper-
iments. Indeed, SpaCy is top-ranked ac-
cording to the F1 metric on the by-publisher
dataset. One question is thus now if other
top-ranked approaches are also from the text
classification literature or dedicated ones.
