Abstract

We present experiments in using dis-
course structure for improving machine
translation evaluation. We first design
two discourse-aware similarity measures,
which use all-subtree kernels to compare
discourse parse trees in accordance with
the Rhetorical Structure Theory. Then,
we show that these measures can help
improve a number of existing machine
translation evaluation metrics both at the
segment- and at the system-level. Rather
than proposing a single new metric, we
show that discourse information is com-
plementary to the state-of-the-art evalu-
ation metrics, and thus should be taken
into account in the development of future
richer evaluation metrics.

1 Introduction

From its foundations, Statistical Machine Transla-
tion (SMT) had two defining characteristics: first,
translation was modeled as a generative process at
the sentence-level. Second, it was purely statisti-
cal over words or word sequences and made lit-
tle to no use of linguistic information. Although
modern SMT systems have switched to a discrim-
inative log-linear framework, which allows for ad-
ditional sources as features, it is generally hard to
incorporate dependencies beyond a small window
of adjacent words, thus making it difficult to use
linguistically-rich models.

Recently, there have been two promising re-
search directions for improving SMT and its eval-
uation: (a) by using more structured linguistic
information, such as syntax (Galley et al., 2004;
Quirk et al., 2005), hierarchical structures (Chi-
ang, 2005), and semantic roles (Wu and Fung,
2009; Lo et al., 2012), and (b) by going beyond
the sentence-level, e.g., translating at the docu-
ment level (Hardmeier et al., 2012).

Going beyond the sentence-level is important
since sentences rarely stand on their own in a
well-written text. Rather, each sentence follows
smoothly from the ones before it, and leads into
the ones that come afterwards. The logical rela-
tionship between sentences carries important in-
formation that allows the text to express a meaning
as a whole beyond the sum of its separate parts.

Note that sentences can be made of several
clauses, which in turn can be interrelated through
the same logical relations. Thus, in a coherent text,
discourse units (sentences or clauses) are logically
connected: the meaning of a unit relates to that of
the previous and the following units.

Discourse analysis seeks to uncover this coher-
ence structure underneath the text. Several formal
theories of discourse have been proposed to de-
scribe the coherence structure (Mann and Thomp-
son, 1988; Asher and Lascarides, 2003; Webber,
2004). For example, the Rhetorical Structure The-
ory (Mann and Thompson, 1988), or RST, repre-
sents text by labeled hierarchical structures called
Discourse Trees (DTs), which can incorporate sev-
eral layers of other linguistic information, e.g.,
syntax, predicate-argument structure, etc.

Modeling discourse brings together the above
research directions (a) and (b), which makes it an
attractive goal for MT. This is demonstrated by the
establishment of a recent workshop dedicated to
Discourse in Machine Translation (Webber et al.,
2013), collocated with the 2013 annual meeting of
the Association of Computational Linguistics.

The area of discourse analysis for SMT is still
nascent and, to the best of our knowledge, no
previous research has attempted to use rhetorical
structure for SMT or machine translation evalua-
tion. One possible reason could be the unavailabil-
ity of accurate discourse parsers. However, this
situation is likely to change given the most recent
advances in automatic discourse analysis (Joty et
al., 2012; Joty et al., 2013).

We believe that the semantic and pragmatic in-
formation captured in the form of DTs (i) can help
develop discourse-aware SMT systems that pro-
duce coherent translations, and (ii) can yield bet-
ter MT evaluation metrics. While in this work we
focus on the latter, we think that the former is also
within reach, and that SMT systems would bene-
fit from preserving the coherence relations in the
source language when generating target-language
translations.

In this paper, rather than proposing yet another
MT evaluation metric, we show that discourse
information is complementary to many existing
evaluation metrics, and thus should not be ignored.
We first design two discourse-aware similarity
measures, which use DTs generated by a publicly-
available discourse parser (Joty et al., 2012); then,
we show that they can help improve a number of
MT evaluation metrics at the segment- and at the
system-level in the context of the WMT11 and the
WMT12 metrics shared tasks (Callison-Burch et
al., 2011; Callison-Burch et al., 2012).

These metrics tasks are based on sentence-level
evaluation, which arguably can limit the benefits
of using global discourse properties. Fortunately,
several sentences are long and complex enough to
present rich discourse structures connecting their
basic clauses. Thus, although limited, this setting
is able to demonstrate the potential of discourse-
level information for MT evaluation. Furthermore,
sentence-level scoring (i) is compatible with most
translation systems, which work on a sentence-by-
sentence basis, (ii) could be beneficial to mod-
ern MT tuning mechanisms such as PRO (Hop-
kins and May, 2011) and MIRA (Watanabe et al.,
2007; Chiang et al., 2008), which also work at
the sentence-level, and (iii) could be used for re-
ranking n-best lists of translation hypotheses.

2 Related Work

Addressing discourse-level phenomena in ma-
chine translation is relatively new as a research di-
rection. Some recent work has looked at anaphora
resolution (Hardmeier and Federico, 2010) and
discourse connectives (Cartoni et al., 2011; Meyer,
2011), to mention two examples.1 However, so
far the attempts to incorporate discourse-related
knowledge in MT have been only moderately suc-
cessful, at best.

1We refer the reader to (Hardmeier, 2012) for an in-depth
overview of discourse-related research for MT.

A common argument, is that current automatic
evaluation metrics such as BLEU are inadequate
to capture discourse-related aspects of translation
quality (Hardmeier and Federico, 2010; Meyer et
al., 2012). Thus, there is consensus that discourse-
informed MT evaluation metrics are needed in or-
der to advance research in this direction. Here we
suggest some simple ways to create such metrics,
and we also show that they yield better correlation
with human judgments.

The field of automatic evaluation metrics for
MT is very active, and new metrics are contin-
uously being proposed, especially in the context
of the evaluation campaigns that run as part of
the Workshops on Statistical Machine Transla-
tion (WMT 2008-2012), and NIST Metrics for
Machine Translation Challenge (MetricsMATR),
among others. For example, at WMT12, 12 met-
rics were compared (Callison-Burch et al., 2012),
most of them new.

There have been several attempts to incorpo-
rate syntactic and semantic linguistic knowledge
into MT evaluation. For instance, at the syn-
tactic level, we find metrics that measure the
structural similarity between shallow syntactic se-
quences (Giménez and Màrquez, 2007; Popovic
and Ney, 2007) or between constituency trees (Liu
and Gildea, 2005). In the semantic case, there are
metrics that exploit the similarity over named en-
tities and predicate-argument structures (Giménez
and Màrquez, 2007; Lo et al., 2012).

In this work, instead of proposing a new metric,
we focus on enriching current MT evaluation met-
rics with discourse information. Our experiments
show that many existing metrics can benefit from
additional knowledge about discourse structure.

In comparison to the syntactic and semantic ex-
tensions of MT metrics, there have been very few
attempts to incorporate discourse information so
far. One example are the semantics-aware metrics
of Giménez and Màrquez (2009) and Comelles et
al. (2010), which use the Discourse Representa-
tion Theory (Kamp and Reyle, 1993) and tree-
based discourse representation structures (DRS)
produced by a semantic parser. They calculate the
similarity between the MT output and references
based on DRS subtree matching, as defined in (Liu
and Gildea, 2005), DRS lexical overlap, and DRS
morpho-syntactic overlap. However, they could
not improve correlation with human judgments, as
evaluated on the MetricsMATR dataset.

688



Compared to the previous work, (i) we use a
different discourse representation (RST), (ii) we
compare discourse parses using all-subtree ker-
nels (Collins and Duffy, 2001), (iii) we evaluate
on much larger datasets, for several language pairs
and for multiple metrics, and (iv) we do demon-
strate better correlation with human judgments.

Wong and Kit (2012) recently proposed an
extension of MT metrics with a measure of
document-level lexical cohesion (Halliday and
Hasan, 1976). Lexical cohesion is achieved using
word repetitions and semantically similar words
such as synonyms, hypernyms, and hyponyms.
For BLEU and TER, they observed improved
correlation with human judgments on the MTC4
dataset when linearly interpolating these metrics
with their lexical cohesion score. Unlike their
work, which measures lexical cohesion at the
document-level, here we are concerned with co-
herence (rhetorical) structure, primarily at the
sentence-level.

3 Our Discourse-Based Measures

Our working hypothesis is that the similarity be-
tween the discourse structures of an automatic and
of a reference translation provides additional in-
formation that can be valuable for evaluating MT
systems. In particular, we believe that good trans-
lations should tend to preserve discourse relations.

As an example, consider the three discourse
trees (DTs) shown in Figure 1: (a) for a reference
(human) translation, and (b) and (c) for transla-
tions of two different systems on the WMT12 test
dataset. The leaves of a DT correspond to con-
tiguous atomic text spans, called Elementary Dis-
course Units or EDUs (three in Figure 1a). Ad-
jacent spans are connected by certain coherence
relations (e.g., Elaboration, Attribution), forming
larger discourse units, which in turn are also sub-
ject to this relation linking. Discourse units linked
by a relation are further distinguished based on
their relative importance in the text: nuclei are
the core parts of the relation while satellites are
supportive ones. Note that the nuclearity and re-
lation labels in the reference translation are also
realized in the system translation in (b), but not
in (c), which makes (b) a better translation com-
pared to (c), according to our hypothesis. We ar-
gue that existing metrics that only use lexical and
syntactic information cannot distinguish well be-
tween (b) and (c).

In order to develop a discourse-aware evalua-
tion metric, we first generate discourse trees for
the reference and the system-translated sentences
using a discourse parser, and then we measure the
similarity between the two discourse trees. We de-
scribe these two steps below.

3.1 Generating Discourse Trees
In Rhetorical Structure Theory, discourse analysis
involves two subtasks: (i) discourse segmentation,
or breaking the text into a sequence of EDUs, and
(ii) discourse parsing, or the task of linking the
units (EDUs and larger discourse units) into la-
beled discourse trees. Recently, Joty et al. (2012)
proposed discriminative models for both discourse
segmentation and discourse parsing at the sen-
tence level. The segmenter uses a maximum en-
tropy model that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
on this task, having an F1-score of 90.5%, while
human agreement is 98.3%.

The discourse parser uses a dynamic Condi-
tional Random Field (Sutton et al., 2007) as a pars-
ing model in order to infer the probability of all
possible discourse tree constituents. The inferred
(posterior) probabilities are then used in a proba-
bilistic CKY-like bottom-up parsing algorithm to
find the most likely DT. Using the standard set
of 18 coarse-grained relations defined in (Carlson
and Marcu, 2001), the parser achieved an F1-score
of 79.8%, which is very close to the human agree-
ment of 83%. These high scores allowed us to de-
velop successful discourse similarity metrics.2

3.2 Measuring Similarity
A number of metrics have been proposed to mea-
sure the similarity between two labeled trees, e.g.,
Tree Edit Distance (Tai, 1979) and Tree Kernels
(Collins and Duffy, 2001; Moschitti and Basili,
2006). Tree kernels (TKs) provide an effective
way to integrate arbitrary tree structures in kernel-
based machine learning algorithms like SVMs.

In the present work, we use the convolution TK
defined in (Collins and Duffy, 2001), which effi-
ciently calculates the number of common subtrees
in two trees. Note that this kernel was originally
designed for syntactic parsing, where the subtrees
are subject to the constraint that their nodes are
taken with either all or none of the children. This
constraint of the TK imposes some limitations on
the type of substructures that can be compared.

One way to cope with the limitations of the TK
is to change the representation of the trees to a
form that is suitable to capture the relevant infor-
mation for our task. We experiment with TKs ap-
plied to two different representations of the dis-
course tree: non-lexicalized (DR), and lexicalized
(DR-LEX). In Figure 2 we show the two represen-
tations for the subtree that spans the text: “sug-
gest the ECB should be the lender of last resort”,
which is highlighted in Figure 1b.

As shown in Figure 2a, DR does not include any
lexical item, and therefore measures the similar-
ity between two translations in terms of their dis-
course structures only. On the contrary, DR-LEX
includes the lexical items to account for lexical
matching; moreover, it separates the structure (the
skeleton) of the tree from its labels, i.e. the nucle-
arity and the relations, in order to allow the tree
kernel to give partial credit to subtrees that differ
in labels but match in their skeletons. More specif-
ically, it uses the tags SPAN and EDU to build the
skeleton of the tree, and considers the nuclearity
and/or the relation labels as properties, added as
children, of these tags.

For example, a SPAN has two properties (its
nuclearity and its relation), and an EDU has one
property (its nuclearity). The words of an EDU
are placed under the predefined children NGRAM.
In order to allow the tree kernel to find subtree
matches at the word level, we include an additional
layer of dummy leaves as was done in (Moschitti
et al., 2007); not shown in Figure 2, for simplicity.

4 Experimental Setup

In our experiments, we used the data available for
the WMT12 and the WMT11 metrics shared tasks
for translations into English.3 This included the
output from the systems that participated in the
WMT12 and the WMT11 MT evaluation cam-
paigns, both consisting of 3,003 sentences, for
four different language pairs: Czech-English (CS-
EN), French-English (FR-EN), German-English
(DE-EN), and Spanish-English (ES-EN); as well as
a dataset with the English references.

We measured the correlation of the metrics with
the human judgments provided by the organizers.
The judgments represent rankings of the output
of five systems chosen at random, for a particu-
lar sentence, also chosen at random. Note that
each judgment effectively constitutes 10 pairwise
system rankings. The overall coverage, i.e. the
number of unique sentences that were evaluated,
was only a fraction of the total; the total number
of judgments, along with other information of the
datasets are shown in Table 1.

4.1 MT Evaluation Metrics

In this study, we evaluate to what extent existing
evaluation metrics can benefit from additional dis-
course information. To do so, we contrast different
MT evaluation metrics with and without discourse
information. The evaluation metrics we used are
described below.

Metrics from WMT12. We used the publicly
available scores for all metrics that participated
in the WMT12 metrics task (Callison-Burch et
al., 2012): SPEDE07PP, AMBER, METEOR,
TERRORCAT, SIMPBLEU, XENERRCATS,
WORDBLOCKEC, BLOCKERRCATS, and POSF.

Metrics from ASIYA. We used the freely avail-
able version of the ASIYA toolkit4 in order to ex-
tend the set of evaluation measures contrasted in
this study beyond those from the WMT12 metrics
task. ASIYA (Giménez and Màrquez, 2010a) is a
suite for MT evaluation that provides a large set of
metrics that use different levels of linguistic infor-
mation. For reproducibility, below we explain the
individual metrics with the exact names required
by the toolkit to calculate them.

First, we used ASIYA’s ULC (Giménez and
Màrquez, 2010b), which was the best performing
metric at the system and the segment levels at the
WMT08 and WMT09 metrics tasks. This is a uni-
form linear combination of 12 individual metrics.
From the original ULC, we only replaced TER and
Meteor individual metrics by newer versions tak-
ing into account synonymy lookup and paraphras-
ing: TERp-A and METEOR-pa in ASIYA’s termi-
nology. We will call this combined metric Asiya-
0809 in our experiments.

4http://nlp.lsi.upc.edu/asiya/

To complement the set of individual metrics
that participated at the WMT12 metrics task, we
also computed the scores of other commonly-
used evaluation metrics: BLEU (Papineni et al.,
2002), NIST (Doddington, 2002), TER (Snover
et al., 2006), ROUGE-W (Lin, 2004), and three
METEOR variants (Denkowski and Lavie, 2011):
METEOR-ex (exact match), METEOR-st (+stem-
ming) and METEOR-sy (+synonyms). The uni-
form linear combination of the previous 7 indi-
vidual metrics plus the 12 from Asiya-0809 is re-
ported as Asiya-ALL in the experimental section.

The individual metrics combined in Asiya-ALL
can be naturally categorized according to the type
of linguistic information they use to compute the
quality scores. We grouped them in the follow-
ing four families and calculated the uniform linear
combination of the metrics in each group:5

1. Asiya-LEX. Combination of five metrics
based on lexical similarity: BLEU, NIST,
METEOR-ex, ROUGE-W, and TERp-A.

2. Asiya-SYN. Combination of four met-
rics ba-sed on syntactic information from
constituency and dependency parse trees:
‘CP-STM-4’, ‘DP-HWCM c-4’, ‘DP-
HWCM r-4’, and ‘DP-Or(*)’.

3. Asiya-SRL. Combination of three metric
variants based on predicate argument struc-
tures (semantic role labeling): ‘SR-Mr(*)’,
‘SR-Or(*)’, and ‘SR-Or’.

4. Asiya-SEM. Combination of two metrics
variants based on semantic parsing:6 ‘DR-
Or(*)’ and ‘DR-Orp(*)’.

5A detailed description of every individual metric can be
found at (Giménez and Màrquez, 2010b). For a more up-to-
date description, see the User Manual from ASIYA’s website.

6In ASIYA the metrics from this family are referred to as
“Discourse Representation” metrics. However, the structures
they consider are actually very different from the discourse
structures exploited in this paper. See the discussion in Sec-
tion 2. For clarity, we will refer to them as semantic parsing
metrics.

691



All uniform linear combinations are calculated
outside ASIYA. In order to make the scores of
the different metrics comparable, we performed a
min–max normalization, for each metric, and for
each language pair combination.

4.2 Human Judgements and Learning

The human-annotated data from the WMT cam-
paigns encompasses series of rankings on the out-
put of different MT systems for every source sen-
tence. Annotators rank the output of five systems
according to perceived translation quality. The or-
ganizers relied on a random selection of systems,
and a large number of comparisons between pairs
of them, to make comparisons across systems fea-
sible (Callison-Burch et al., 2012). As a result,
for each source sentence, only relative rankings
were available. As in the WMT12 experimen-
tal setup, we use these rankings to calculate cor-
relation with human judgments at the sentence-
level, i.e. Kendall’s Tau; see (Callison-Burch et
al., 2012) for details.

For the experiments reported in Section 5.4, we
used pairwise rankings to discriminatively learn
the weights of the linear combinations of indi-
vidual metrics. In order to use the WMT12 data
for training a learning-to-rank model, we trans-
formed the five-way relative rankings into ten
pairwise comparisons. For instance, if a judge
ranked the output of systems A, B, C, D, E
as A > B > C > D > E, this would entail that
A > B, A > C, A > D and A > E, etc.

To determine the relative weights for the tuned
combinations, we followed a similar approach to
the one used by PRO to tune the relative weights of
the components of a log-linear SMT model (Hop-
kins and May, 2011), also using Maximum En-
tropy as the base learning algorithm. Unlike
PRO, (i) we use human judgments, not automatic
scores, and (ii) we train on all pairs, not on a sub-
sample.

5 Experimental Results

In this section, we explore how discourse informa-
tion can be used to improve machine translation
evaluation metrics. Below we present the evalua-
tion results at the system- and segment-level, using
our two basic metrics on discourse trees (Section
3.1), which are referred to as DR and DR-LEX.

5.1 Evaluation

In our experiments, we only consider translation
into English, and use the data described in Table 1.
For evaluation, we follow the setup of the metrics
task of WMT12 (Callison-Burch et al., 2012): at
the system-level, we use the official script from
WMT12 to calculate the Spearman’s correlation,
where higher absolute values indicate better met-
rics performance; at the segment-level, we use
Kendall’s Tau for measuring correlation, where
negative values are worse than positive ones.7

In our experiments, we combine DR and
DR-LEX to other metrics in two different ways:
using uniform linear interpolation (at system- and
segment-level), and using a tuned linear interpo-
lation for the segment-level. We only present the
average results over all four language pairs. For
simplicity, in our tables we show results divided
into evaluation groups:

1. Group I: contains our evaluation metrics, DR
and DR-LEX.

2. Group II: includes the metrics that partici-
pated in the WMT12 metrics task, excluding
metrics which did not have results for all lan-
guage pairs.

3. Group III: contains other important evalu-
ation metrics, which were not considered
in the WMT12 metrics task: NIST and
ROUGE for both system- and segment-level,
and BLEU and TER at segment-level.

4. Group IV: includes the metric combinations
calculated with ASIYA and described in Sec-
tion 4.

For each metric in groups II, III and IV, we
present the results for the original metric as well
for the linear interpolation of that metric with DR
and with DR-LEX. The combinations with DR
and DR-LEX that improve over the original met-
rics are shown in bold, and those that degrade are
in italic. Furthermore, we also present overall re-
sults for: (i) the average score over all metrics, ex-
cluding DR and DR-LEX, and (ii) the differences
in the correlations for the DR/DR-LEX-combined
and the original metrics.

7We have fixed a bug in the scoring tool from WMT12,
which was making all scores positive. This made
TERRORCAT’s score negative, as we present it in Table 3.

5.2 System-level Results

Table 2 shows the system-level experimental re-
sults for WMT12. We can see that DR is already
competitive by itself: on average, it has a cor-
relation of .807, very close to BLEU and TER
scores (.810 and .812, respectively). Moreover,
DR yields improvements when combined with 15
of the 19 metrics; worsening only four of the met-
rics. Overall, we observe an average improvement
of +.024, in the correlation with the human judg-
ments. This suggests that DR contains information
that is complementary to that used by the other
metrics. Note that this is true both for the indi-
vidual metrics from groups II and III, as well as
for the metric combinations in group IV. Combi-
nations in the last group involve several metrics
that already use linguistic information at different
levels and are hard to improve over; yet, adding
DR does improve, which shows that it has some
complementary information to offer.

As expected, DR-LEX performs better than DR
since it is lexicalized (at the unigram level), and
also gives partial credit to correct structures. Indi-
vidually, DR-LEX outperforms most of the metrics
from group II, and ranks as the second best metric
in that group. Furthermore, when combined with
individual metrics in group II, DR-LEX is able to
improve consistently over each one of them.

Note that, even though DR-LEX has better indi-
vidual performance than DR, it does not yield im-
provements when combined with most of the met-
rics in group IV.8 However, over all metrics and all
language pairs, DR-LEX is able to obtain an aver-
age improvement in correlation of +.035, which is
remarkably higher than that of DR. Thus, we can
conclude that at the system-level, adding discourse
information to a metric, even using the simplest of
the combination schemes, is a good idea for most
of the metrics, and can help to significantly im-
prove the correlation with human judgments.

5.3 Segment-level Results: Non-tuned
Table 3 shows the results for WMT12 at the
segment-level. We can see that DR performs
badly, with a high negative Kendall’s Tau of -.433.
This should not be surprising: (a) the discourse
tree structure alone does not contain enough infor-
mation for a good evaluation at the segment-level,
and (b) this metric is more sensitive to the quality
of the DT, which can be wrong or void.

8In this work, we have not investigated the reasons behind
this phenomenon. We speculate that this might be caused by
the fact that the lexical information in DR-LEX is incorpo-
rated only in the form of unigram matching at the sentence-
level, while the metrics in group IV are already complex com-
bined metrics, which take into account stronger lexical mod-
els. Note, however, that the variations are very small and
might not be significant.

level: tuning with cross-validation on WMT12.
Kendall’s Tau with human judgments.

Additionally, DR is more likely to produce a
high number of ties, which is harshly penalized
by WMT12’s definition of Kendall’s Tau. Con-
versely, ties and incomplete discourse analysis
were not a problem at the system-level, where ev-
idence from all 3,003 test sentences is aggregated,
and allows to rank systems more precisely. Due to
the low score of DR as an individual metric, it fails
to yield improvements when uniformly combined
with other metrics.

Again, DR-LEX is better than DR; with a pos-
itive Tau of +.133, yet as an individual metric, it
ranks poorly compared to other metrics in group
II. However, when linearly combined with other
metrics, DR-LEX outperforms 14 of the 19 met-
rics in Table 3. Across all metrics, DR-LEX yields
an average Tau improvement of +.026, i.e. from
.165 to .190. This is a large improvement, taking
into account that the combinations are just uniform
linear combinations. In subsection 5.4, we present
the results of tuning the linear combination in a
discriminative way.

5.4 Segment-level Results: Tuned

We experimented with tuning the weights of the
individual metrics in the metric combinations, us-
ing the learning method described in Section 4.2.

First, we did this using cross-validation to tune
and test on WMT12. Later we tuned on WMT12
and evaluated on WMT11. For cross-validation
in WMT12, we used ten folds of approximately
equal sizes, each containing about 300 sentences:
we constructed the folds by putting together en-
tire documents, thus not allowing sentences from
a document to be split over two different folds.
During each cross-validation run, we trained our
pairwise ranker using the human judgments cor-
responding to nine of the ten folds. We aggre-
gated the data for different language pairs, and
produced a single set of tuning weights for all lan-
guage pairs.9 We then used the remaining fold for
evaluation

The results are shown in Table 4. As in previ-
ous sections we present the average results over
all four language pairs. We can see that the tuned
combinations with DR-LEX improve over most of
the individual metrics in groups II and III. Inter-
estingly, the tuned combinations that include the
much weaker metric DR now improve over 12 out
of 13 of the individual metrics in groups II and III,
and only slightly degrades the score of the 13th
one (SPEDE07PP).

Note that the ASIYA metrics are combinations
of several metrics, and these combinations (which
exclude DR and DR-LEX) can be also tuned; this
yields sizable improvements over the untuned ver-
sions as column three in the table shows. Com-
pared to this baseline, DR improves for three of
the six ASIYA metrics, while DR-LEX improves
for four of them. Note that improving over the
last two ASIYA metrics is very hard: they have
very high scores of .296 and .295; for compar-
ison, the best segment-level system at WMT12
(SPEDE07PP) achieved a Tau of .254.

On average, DR improves Tau from .165 to
.201, which is +.036, while DR-LEX improves to
.222, or +.057. These much larger improvements
highlight the importance of tuning the linear com-
bination when working at the segment-level.

5.4.1 Testing on WMT11

In order to rule out the possibility that the im-
provement of the tuned metrics on WMT12 comes
from over-fitting, and to verify that the tuned met-
rics do generalize when applied to other sentences,
we also tested on a new test set: WMT11.

9Tuning separately for each language pair yielded slightly
lower results.

694



Therefore, we tuned the weights on all WMT12
pairwise judgments (no cross-validation), and we
evaluated on WMT11. Since the metrics that par-
ticipated in WMT11 and WMT12 are different
(and even when they have the same name, there
is no guarantee that they have not changed from
2011 to 2012), we only report results for the ver-
sions of NIST, ROUGE, TER, and BLEU available
in ASIYA, as well as for the ASIYA metrics, thus
ensuring that the metrics in the experiments are
consistent for 2011 and 2012.

The results are shown in Table 5. Once again,
tuning yields sizable improvements over the sim-
ple combination for the ASIYA metrics (third col-
umn in Table 5). Adding DR and DR-LEX to the
combinations manages to improve over five and
four of the six tuned ASIYA metrics, respectively.
However, some of the differences are very small.
On the contrary, DR and DR-LEX significantly im-
prove over NIST, ROUGE, TER, and BLEU. Over-
all, DR improves the average Tau from .207 to
.244, which is +.037, while DR-LEX improves to
.267 or +.061. These improvements are very close
to those for the WMT12 cross-validation. This
shows that the weights learned on WMT12 gen-
eralize well, as they are also good for WMT11.

What is also interesting to note is that when tun-
ing is used, DR helps achieve sizeable improve-
ments, even if not as strong as for DR-LEX. This
is remarkable given that DR has a strong negative
Tau as an individual metric at the sentence-level.
This suggests that both DR and DR-LEX contain
information that is complementary to that of the
individual metrics that we experimented with.

Overall, from the experimental results in this
section, we can conclude that discourse structure
is an important information source to be taken into
account in the automatic evaluation of machine
translation output.

6 Conclusions and Future Work

In this paper we have shown that discourse struc-
ture can be used to improve automatic MT evalua-
tion. First, we defined two simple discourse-aware
similarity metrics (lexicalized and un-lexicalized),
which use the all-subtree kernel to compute sim-
ilarity between discourse parse trees in accor-
dance with the Rhetorical Structure Theory. Then,
after extensive experimentation on WMT12 and
WMT11 data, we showed that a variety of ex-
isting evaluation metrics can benefit from our

discourse-based metrics, both at the segment- and
the system-level, especially when the discourse in-
formation is incorporated in an informed way (i.e.
using supervised tuning). Our results show that
discourse-based metrics can improve the state-of-
the-art MT metrics, by increasing correlation with
human judgments, even when only sentence-level
discourse information is used.

Addressing discourse-level phenomena in MT
is a relatively new research direction. Yet, many
of the ongoing efforts have been moderately suc-
cessful according to traditional evaluation met-
rics. There is a consensus in the MT community
that more discourse-aware metrics need to be pro-
posed for this area to move forward. We believe
this work is a valuable contribution towards this
longer-term goal.

The tuned combined metrics tested in this pa-
per are just an initial proposal, i.e. a simple ad-
justment of the relative weights for the individ-
ual metrics in a linear combination. In the fu-
ture, we plan to work on integrated representations
of syntactic, semantic and discourse-based struc-
tures, which would allow us to train evaluation
metrics based on more fine-grained features. Ad-
ditionally, we propose to use the discourse infor-
mation for MT in two different ways. First, at the
sentence-level, we can use discourse information
to re-rank alternative MT hypotheses; this could
be applied either for MT parameter tuning, or as a
post-processing step for the MT output. Second,
we propose to move in the direction of using dis-
course information beyond the sentence-level.
