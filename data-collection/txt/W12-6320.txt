Abstract

Chinese tweets segmentation is a critical prob-
lem in natural language processing area. While
segmentation of in-vocabulary words is well
studied to date, few research findings are yet
available concerning the prediction of new
words on twitter. In this paper, we attempt to
exploit multiple features for segmenting
tweets in real text. To this end, we first take
morpheme as the basic component units of
Chinese words and thus investigate the rela-
tionship between Chinese new words and their
internal morphological structures. Then, we
explore both word internal cues and word ex-
ternal contextual features, and combine them
for segmentation of Chinese new words using
conditional random field. Our experimental re-
sults show that the incorporation of multiple
features, especially the word-internal morpho-
logical features is of great value to Chinese
tweets segmentation.

1 Introduction

Chinese word segmentation is one of the im-
portant steps in natural language processing. Es-
sentially, segmentation is trying to determine the
boundary of the word. As a fundamental natural
language analysis task, word segmentation plays
a key role in many natural language processing
applications.

Different from the traditional word segmenta-
tion, many new words exist in the segmentation
on twitter. Traditional methods can’t deal with
this problem well, especially the dictionary based
method. In this paper, we use statistical method
to solve this problem.

In previous study, most researchers used word
as the basic unit; however, this method is fatigue
on addressing the new words detection. To ad-

dress this problem, in this paper, we use mor-
pheme as the basic unit under the Conditional
Random Filed (CRF). Fu et al. proved that mor-
phemes were informative for unknown words
processing.

2 Approach

In this paper, we take word segmentation as
sequence labeling. Given an input sequence of
words, our approach for word segmentation con-
sists of three main parts: First, a word decompo-
sition module is employed to decompose un-
known words within the input sentence into a
sequence of morphemes. Then the extended BIO
tagset is used to represent the position patterns of
morphemes within words. Finally, CRF is used
to predict the corresponding label.

2.1 Chinese Morphemes
In the present study we consider two major

types of morphemes, namely free morphemes
and bound morphemes (viz. affixes). A free
morpheme can stand by itself as a word, whereas
an affix can show up if and only if being attached
to other morphemes to form a word.

To explore word-internal clues for segmenta-
tion of Chinese new words, we employ the ex-
tended IOB tagset to represent the position pat-
terns of Chinese morphemes in word formation.
Table 1 presents the detailed definition of the
extended IOB tags and the correspondence be-
tween IOB tags and morpheme types.

Tag Definition
O A morpheme as a word by itself
I A morpheme inside a word
B A word-initial morpheme
E A word-final morpheme

2.2 Word decomposition
Word decomposition is the process of decom-

posing a word to a sequence of morphemes asso-
ciated with their IOB tags defined in Table 1. For
example, the word “不安全感”(the sense of in-
security) should be decomposed as “不/O 安/B
全/E感/O”.

2.3 Features
Feature selection plays a critical in CRF. In

the present study, we consider two main groups
of features for Chinese word segmentation,
namely contextual features around words and
word-formation features within words. We
choose the part of speech (POS) of the mor-
pheme as the internal feature; the table2 shows
our feature template.

4 Conclusions

In this paper, we have attempted to explore
word internal morphological clues within Chi-
nese words, and incorporate them with word-
external contextual features for segmentation of
Chinese words. Due to the lack of large scale
corpus and deep morphological knowledge for
Chinese, in the present study we only took into
account surface morphological clues, namely the
position patterns of morphemes in word forma-
tion. In future work we intend to explore syste-
matically deep morphological knowledge.
