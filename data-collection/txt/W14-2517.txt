Abstract

We provide a method for automatically
detecting change in language across time
through a chronologically trained neural
language model. We train the model on
the Google Books Ngram corpus to ob-
tain word vector representations specific
to each year, and identify words that have
changed significantly from 1900 to 2009.
The model identifies words such as cell
and gay as having changed during that
time period. The model simultaneously
identifies the specific years during which
such words underwent change.

1 Introduction

Language changes across time. Existing words
adopt additional senses (gay), new words are cre-
ated (internet), and some words ‘die out’ (many
irregular verbs, such as burnt, are being replaced
by their regularized counterparts (Lieberman et al.,
2007)). Traditionally, scarcity of digitized histori-
cal corpora has prevented applications of contem-
porary machine learning algorithms—which typi-
cally require large amounts of data—in such tem-
poral analyses. Publication of the Google Books
Ngram corpus in 2009, however, has contributed
to an increased interest in culturomics, wherein
researchers analyze changes in human culture
through digitized texts (Michel et al., 2011).

Developing computational methods for detect-
ing and quantifying change in language is of in-
terest to theoretical linguists as well as NLP re-
searchers working with diachronic corpora. Meth-
ods employed in previous work have been var-
ied, from analyses of word frequencies to more in-
volved techniques (Guolordava et al. (2011); Mi-
halcea and Nataste (2012)). In our framework,
we train a Neural Language Model (NLM) on
yearly corpora to obtain word vectors for each year

from 1900 to 2009. We chronologically train the
model by initializing word vectors for subsequent
years with the word vectors obtained from previ-
ous years.

We compare the cosine similarity of the word
vectors for same words in different years to iden-
tify words that have moved significantly in the
vector space during that time period. Our model
identifies words such as cell and gay as having
changed between 1900–2009. The model addi-
tionally identifies words whose change is more
subtle. We also analyze the yearly movement of
words across the vector space to identify the spe-
cific periods during which they changed. The
trained word vectors are publicly available.1

2 Related Work

Previously, researchers have computationally in-
vestigated diachronic language change in various
ways. Mihalcea and Nastase (2012) take a super-
vised learning approach and predict the time pe-
riod to which a word belongs given its surrounding
context. Sagi et al. (2009) use a variation of Latent
Semantic Analysis to identify semantic change of
specific words from early to modern English. Wi-
jaya and Yeniterzi (2011) utilize a Topics-over-
Time model and K-means clustering to identify
periods during which selected words move from
one topic/cluster to another. They correlate their
findings with the underlying historical events dur-
ing that time. Gulordava and Baroni (2011) use
co-occurrence counts of words from 1960s and
1990s to detect semantic change. They find that
the words identified by the model are consistent
with evaluations from human raters. Popescu and
Strapparava (2013) employ statistical tests on fre-
quencies of political, social, and emotional words
to identify and characterize epochs.

Our work contributes to the domain in sev-

eral ways. Whereas previous work has generally
involved researchers manually identifying words
that have changed (with the exception of Gulor-
dava and Baroni (2011)), we are able to automat-
ically identify them. We are additionally able to
capture a word’s yearly movement and identify
periods of rapid change. In contrast to previous
work, we simultaneously identify words that have
changed and also the specific periods during which
they changed.

3 Neural Language Models

Similar to traditional language models, NLMs in-
volve predicting a set of future word given some
history of previous words. In NLMs however,
words are projected from a sparse, 1-of-V encod-
ing (where V is the size of the vocabulary) onto a
lower dimensional vector space via a hidden layer.
This allows for better representation of semantic
properties of words compared to traditional lan-
guage models (wherein words are represented as
indices in a vocabulary set). Thus, words that
are semantically close to one another would have
word vectors that are likewise ‘close’ (as measured
by a distance metric) in the vector space. In fact,
Mikolov et al. (2013a) report that word vectors ob-
tained through NLMs capture much deeper level
of semantic information than had been previously
thought. For example, if xw is the word vector
for word w, they note that xapple − xapples ≈
xcar − xcars ≈ xfamily − xfamilies. That is, the
concept of pluralization is learned by the vector
representations (see Mikolov et al. (2013a) for
more examples).

NLMs are but one of many methods to ob-
tain word vectors—other techniques include La-
tent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Deerwester et al.,
1990), Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et
al., 2003), and variations thereof. And even within
NLMs there exist various architectures for learn-
ing word vectors (Bengio et al. (2003); Mikolov
et al. (2010); Collobert et al. (2011); Yih et
al. (2011)). We utilize an architecture introduced
by Mikolov et al. (2013b), called the Skip-gram,
which allows for efficient estimation of word vec-
tors from large corpora.

In a Skip-gram model, each word in the corpus
is used to predict a window of surrounding words
(Figure 1). To ensure that words closer to the cur-
rent word are given more weight in training, dis-

Figure 1: Architecture of a Skip-gram model (Mikolov et al.,
2013b).

tant words are sampled less frequently.2 Training
is done through stochastic gradient descent and
backpropagation. The word representations are
found in the hidden layer. Despite its simplicity—
and thus, computational efficiency—compared to
other NLMs, Mikolov et al. (2013b) note that the
Skip-gram is competitive with other vector space
models in the Semantic-Syntactic Word Relation-
ship test set when trained on the same data.

3.1 Training

The Google Books Ngram corpus contains
Ngrams from approximately 8 million books, or
6% of all books published (Lin et al., 2012). We
sample 10 million 5-grams from the English fic-
tion corpus for every year from 1850–2009. We
lower-case all words after sampling and restrict the
vocabulary to words that occurred at least 10 times
in the 1850–2009 corpus.

For the model, we use a window size of 4 and
dimensionality of 200 for the word vectors. Within
each year, we iterate over epochs until conver-
gence, where the measure of convergence is de-
fined as the average angular change in word vec-
tors between epochs. That is, if V (y) is the vo-
cabulary set for year y, and xw(y, e) is the word
vector for word w in year y and epoch number e,
we continue iterating over epochs until,

1
|V (y)|

∑
w∈V (y)

arccos
xw(y, e) · xw(y, e− 1)
‖xw(y, e)‖‖xw(y, e− 1)‖

is below some threshold. The learning rate is set
to 0.01 at the start of each epoch and linearly de-
creased to 0.0001.

2Specifically, given a maximum window size of W , a ran-
dom integer R is picked from range [1, W ] for each training
word. The current training word is used to predict R previous
and R future words.

500 times) are omitted.

Once the word vectors for year y have con-
verged, we initialize the word vectors for year y+1
with the previous year’s word vectors and train
on the y + 1 data until convergence. We repeat
this process for 1850–2009. Using an open source
implementation in the gensim package, training
took approximately 4 days on a 2.9 GHz machine.

4 Results and Discussion

For the analysis, we treat 1850–1899 as an initial-
ization period and begin our study from 1900.

4.1 Word Comparisons

By comparing the cosine similarity between same
words across different time periods, we are able
to detect words whose usage has changed. We are
also able to identify words that did not change. Ta-
ble 1 has a list of 10 most/least changed words be-
tween 1900 and 2009. We note that almost all of
the least changed words are function words. For
the changed words, many of the identified words
agree with intuition (e.g. gay, cell, ass). Oth-
ers are not so obvious (e.g. checked, headed, ac-
tually). To better understand how these words
have changed, we look at the composition of their
neighboring words for 1900 and 2009 (Table 2).

As a further check, we search Google Books
for sentences that contain the above words. Below
are some example sentences from 1900 and 2009
with the word checked:

1900: “However, he checked himself in time, saying —”

1900: “She was about to say something further, but she

checked herself.”

2009: “He’d checked his facts on a notepad from his back

pocket.”

2009: “I checked out the house before I let them go inside.”

Table 2: Top 3 neighboring words (based on cosine similar-
ity) specific to each time period for the words identified as
having changed.

At the risk of oversimplifying, the resulting sen-
tences indicate that in the past, checked was more
frequently used with the meaning “to hold in re-
straint”, whereas now, it is more frequently used
with the meaning “to verify by consulting an au-
thority” or “to inspect so as to determine accu-
racy”. Given that check is a highly polysemous
word, this seems to be a case in which the popu-
larity of a word’s sense changed over time.

Conducting a similar exercise for actually, we
obtain the following sentences:

1900: “But if ever he actually came into property, she must

recognize the change in his position.”

1900: “Whenever a young gentleman was not actually

engaged with his knife and fork or spoon —”

2009: “I can’t believe he actually did that!”

2009: “Our date was actually one of the most fun and

creative ones I had in years.”

Like the above, this seems to be a case in
which the popularity of a word’s sense changed
over time (from “to refer to what is true or real”
to “to express wonder or surprise”).

4.2 Periods of Change

As we chronologically train the model year-by-
year, we can plot the time series of a word’s
distance to its neighboring words (from differ-
ent years) to detect periods of change. Figure 2
(above) has such a plot for the word cell compared
to its early neighbors, closet and dungeon, and the
more recent neighbors, phone and cordless. Fig-
ure 2 (below) has a similar plot for gay.

Such plots allow us to identify a word’s pe-
riod of change relative to its neighboring words,

tween cell and its neighboring words in 1900 (closet, dun-
geon) and 2009 (phone, cordless). (Below) Similar plot of

and 2009 (lesbian, bisexual).

and thus provide context as to how it evolved.
This may be of use to researchers interested in
understanding (say) when gay started being used
as a synonym for homosexual. We can also iden-
tify periods of change independent of neighboring
words by analyzing the cosine similarity of a word
against itself from a reference year (Figure 3). As
some of the change is due to sampling and random
drift, we additionally plot the average cosine simi-
larity of all words against their reference points in
Figure 3. This allows us to detect whether a word’s
change during a given period is greater (or less)
than would be expected from chance. We note
that for cell, the identified period of change (1985–
2009) coincides with the introduction—and sub-
sequent adoption—of the cell phone by the gen-
eral public.3 Likewise, the period of change for
gay agrees with the gay movement which began
around the 1970s (Wijaya and Yeniterzi, 2011).

4.3 Limitations

In the present work, identification of a changed
word is conditioned on its occurring often enough

in the study period. If a word’s usage decreased
dramatically (or stopped being used altogether),
its word vector will have remained the same and
hence it will not show up as having changed.
One way to overcome this may be to combine
the cosine distance and the frequency to define a
new metric that measures how a word’s usage has
changed.

5 Conclusions and Future Work

In this paper we provided a method for analyz-
ing change in the written language across time
through word vectors obtained from a chronolog-
ically trained neural language model. Extending
previous work, we are able to not only automat-
ically identify words that have changed but also
the periods during which they changed. While we
have not extensively looked for connections be-
tween periods identified by the model and real his-
torical events, they are nevertheless apparent.

An interesting direction of research could in-
volve analysis and characterization of the differ-
ent types of change. With a few exceptions, we
have been deliberately general in our analysis by
saying that a word’s usage has changed. We have
avoided inferring the type of change (e.g. semantic
vs syntactic, broadening vs narrowing, pejoration
vs amelioration). It may be the case that words that
undergo (say) a broadening in senses exhibit reg-
ularities in how they move about the vector space,
allowing researchers to characterize the type of
change that occurred.
