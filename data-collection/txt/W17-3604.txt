Abstract

The paper deals with the pilot version of the 
first RST discourse treebank for Russian. The 
project started in 2016. At present, the tree-
bank consists of sixty news texts annotated for 
rhetorical relations according to RST scheme. 
However, this scheme was slightly modified 
in order to achieve higher inter-annotator 
agreement score. During the annotation pro-
cedure, we also registered the discourse con-
nectives of different types and mapped them 
onto the corresponding rhetoric relations. In 
present paper, we discuss our experience of 
RST scheme adaptation for Russian news 
texts. Besides, we report on the distribution of 
the most frequent discourse connectives in our 
corpus. 

1 Introduction 

One of the focuses of the present NLP research is 
the text analysis on the discourse level. There is a 
big amount of NLP tasks, such as coreference reso-
lution, text summarization, irony detection, ques-
tion-answering systems etc., where the analysis of 
text needs to go beyond the boundaries of a single 
clause or even a sentence. For such tasks, the in-
formation on text cohesion, discourse structure and 
discourse relations is needed. In order to develop 

the modules dealing with discourse analysis, one 
needs a text corpus with discourse level annotation.  

This paper describes the creation of the pilot 
version of the Discourse-annotated corpus for the 
Russian language, based on Rhetorical Structure 
Theory (RST) framework (Mann, Thompson, 
1988). Corpus includes the texts taken from Rus-
sian freely available online resources and manually 
annotated for RST relations. It is designed for con-
ducting the experiments on different machine-
learning methods for discourse parsing. It also can 
be used for the investigation of discourse structure, 
relational and lexical cohesion and other discourse-
based phenomena in Russian.  

During the annotation procedure we single out 
different connectives (conjunctions, particles, some 
lexical and punctuation cues), associated with the 
corresponding discourse relation. These cues can 
serve as a seed set for automatic discourse connec-
tives extraction.  

Until now, the majority of theoretical works de-
voted to discourse relation for Russian were deal-
ing primarily with the analysis of conjunction, pa-
renthesis words and expressions functions. Our ap-
proach differs in that our goal was to find out what 
lexical items irrespective of their part of speech 
can signal the presence of a rhetorical relation. 
Thus, we take into consideration such lexical clues 
as nouns or verbs of speech etc.  (e.g. prichina ‘the

course’). In present paper, we suggest quantitative 
analyses of these connectives. 

2 Related works  

There exist different approaches to discourse anno-
tation principles. One of the approaches is based 
on the “linear” annotation. Thus, in Penn Dis-
course Treebank (PDTB) discourse relations are 
lexically anchored by discourse connectives. They  
are viewed as predicates that take abstract objects 
such as propositions, events and states as their ar-
guments (PDTB (Prasad et al., 2007; Webber et al., 
2016), TurkishDB (Zeyrek et al., 2013), etc.). In 
the Chinese Discourse TreeBank the punctuation 
marks also play role in the annotation (Zhou, Xue, 
2015). Models based on cohesive relations are not 
tree-like, for instance, Discourse Graphbank (Wolf 
and Gibson, 2005). Another significant approach is 
the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann, 
Thompson, 1988). RST framework represents text 
as a hierarchy of elementary discourse units 
(EDUs) and describes relations between them and 
between bigger parts of text. Some EDUs carry 
more important information (nucleus) than others 
(satellite) do. There are two rhetorical relation 
types: nucleus-satellite (mononuclear) and multi-
nuclear. While the first type connects a nucleus 
and a satellite, the latter includes EDUs that are 
equally important in the analyzed discourse. For 
the current research we chose RST to study cohe-
sive markers and discourse cues taking into con-
sideration ‘trees’ - discourse structure of texts. 

There exist special lexicons or extensive de-
scriptions of discourse connectives’ (their types, 
positions, linking directions, ambiguous degrees, 
distribution of signalled relations) for particular 
languages: e.g. for English (Taboada M., Das D, 
2013), for  French (Roze C., Danlos L., Muller P. 
LEXCONN), for Chinese (Huang H. H. et al., 
2014), etc. There are also comparatives studies of 
discourse connectives (e.g. English and French 
(Popescu-Belis A. et al, 2012), Spanish and Chi-
nese (Cao S., da Cunha I., Bel N, 2016)). 

As some discourse markers can indicate more 
than one discourse relation, another problem in this 
field is a lexical cue disambiguation (da Cunha I., 
2013; Khazaei T. et al., 2015). General way of re-
solving this problem is extracting syntactic con-
texts for a particular cue in different discourse rela-
tion.  

For automatic discourse parsing the most com-
plicated task is to identify implicit discourse rela-
tions - those that do not involve any explicit dis-
course connectives. In (Rutherford A. et al., 2015) 
authors investigated the criteria for selecting the 
discourse connectives that can be omitted without 
changing the context.  

M. Taboada and D. Das (Taboada M., Das 
D, 2013) suggest an exhaustive investigation of 
discourse relation clues. Besides traditionally dis-
cussed functional words, such as conjunctions, the 
list of connectives features is extended by means of 
semantic, syntactic, graphical and others types of 
features. As a result, authors show that the majority 
of relations are explicit rather than implicit, as it is 
usually postulated. Making a list of discourse rela-
tions clues for Russian, we take this approach into 
consideration. 

3 Russian RST Bank 

The current project started in 2016. We are 
planning to annotate texts (more than 100,000 to-
kens) of four genres and domains: science, popular 
science, news stories, and analytic journalism. The 
pilot project was aimed at working-out annotation 
rules and to achieve a reasonable score for inter-
annotator agreement.  

For annotation we use an open-source tool 
rstWeb [https://corpling.uis.georgetown.edu/rst-
web/info/]. It has a number of advantages in com-
parison with other tools (UAM CorpusTool, 
RSTTool, GraphAnno): user-friendly interface, 
ability to work in the browser and to make changes 
to the code. 

We start with the list of relations suggested in 
(Mann W., Tompson S., 1988). The instruction for 
annotators was based on the work by L.Carlson, 
D. Marcu, M. Okurowsky (Carlson et al., 2003). 
However, the initial list of relations was slightly 
modified. After modification, the resulting list con-
sisted of 25 relations. During the further tagging 
procedure, special focus was on inter-annotator 
agreement (IAA). We have selected Krippendorff’s 
unitized alpha as a statistic to measure IAA. It op-
erates on the whole annotation spans instead of iso-
lated tokens and it can be calculated for any num-
ber of annotators.  

It turned out that annotators confuse Volitional 
and Non-Volitional relations, Antithesis and Con-

30



 
 

trast (same meaning, but Antithesis is mononucle-
ar, Contrast - multinuclear), Cause and Effect 
(same meaning, but either cause or effect is nucle-
ar). We decided to tack them, as well as two types 
of Attribution (a general and more specific one) 
and Interpretation with Evaluation (the only differ-
ence is in the degree of objectivity of author’s 
evaluation). Besides, we took out Conclusion and 
Motivation, since they occur rarely and the first 
one can be considered a subtype of Restatement). 
Finally, we got 17 relations that were divided into 
four groups (fig. 1). These modifications have giv-
en a vast improvement of IAA. For three texts 
tagged by four people it stood at 0,27 - 0,49 before 
reduction of the relations tree and 0,69 - 0,77 after 
reduction. In order to accelerate the annotation 
process, the automatic text segmentation was

applied. RusClaSp (http://gree-gorey.github.io/) 
package was taken as a basis and adapted to our 
task and corpus. In particular, we consider some 
explicit unambiguous markers and ignore paren-

thetic phrases. The human-annotator checks the re-
sult of automatic segmentation and builds a dis-
course tree of a text.  

By now, we have annotated 73 texts, mostly 
news stories (each of them is 30 sentences in 
length on the average), they contain 44685 tokens. 
For each text we built one single tree where text 
spans are connected to other spans, nodes are con-
nected to other nodes, and so on to the common 
vertex. 

4 Rhetorical relations markers 

In our current research, we investigate the interac-
tion between discourse connectives and the dis-
course relations. As it has been already mentioned, 
we consider not only functional words to be rheto-
ric relation markers. The markers includes punctu-
ation marks, prepositions, pronouns, speech verbs, 
etc. 

While annotating the corpus, we register overt 
clues for corresponding relation types. The list of 
registered cases consists of 692 pairs “marker-
relation” (with approximately 200-250 unique 
markers suggested by annotators). The variation in 
number of markers due to the fact that some the 
markers are constructions where one of their ele-
ments may vary. For instance, one of the patterns 
for ATTRIBUTION relation is a construction in-
troducing “reported speech” consisting of a verb of 
speech plus, optionally, a conjunction chto ‘what, 
that’ (e.g. “said that” or “reported that” etc.). There 
is no enough data to decide whether to treat the el-
ements of this construction as separate markers or 
not.    

Markers, which appear in texts more frequently, 
may be ambiguous, i.e. same markers can signal 
several relations. There are 55 markers ordered by 
the raise of their frequencies (threshold >= 3 oc-
currences in the corpus) in fig. 2.

Among 14 most frequent markers (threshold >=9), 
most of them (with one exception of  v to vremya,, 
kak ‘at time, when’) point directly on the definite 
relation type or close relation types. The table 1 
presents the statistics for relations expressed overt-
ly via markers. The most frequent marker for this 
relation is given.

Table 1. Relations with their most frequent markers 

As we can see from the table the most frequent 
relation in News texts are ELABORATION, 
JOINT and ATTRIBUTION. These texts are char-
acterized by high proportion of symmetric relations 
and high quantity of special lexical expressions 

such as constructions with speech verbs and other 
types of mental predicates.  

5 Discussion 

The discourse markers analysis reveals some in-
teresting evidence that deserves additional atten-
tion. Firstly, the news texts contain not many spe-
cial subordinate conjunctions for reason, cause etc. 
The most frequent are such relations as JOINT, 
ELABORATION and ATTRIBUTION.  

The punctuation marks in Russian such as hy-
phen can also signal some relations, namely, 
ELABORATION. 

The JOINT relation is expressed not only via 
coordinative conjunction, but also via the conjunc-
tion a “but” traditionally treated as adversative.   

The clause type for elaboration in Russian news 
texts is a relative clause (finite clause or participial 
clause). Thus, the marker for elaboration is the rel-
ative pronoun kotoryj ‘which’. 

The task to extract the ATTRIBUTION relation 
can be reformulated as the task to extract the 
markers of reported speech. Almost all the markers 
that the annotators single out for ATTRIBUTION 
are special constructions for reported speech intro-
duction into discourse such as ‘said that’, ‘accord-
ing to X’s opinion’, ‘As X’s announced…’ 

There is a tendency in News texts to express 
cause-effect and some other relations via special 
lexemes denoting some mental operations (assess-
ment, intentions etc.). 

6   Conclusions 

The aim of this paper was to introduce an ongo-
ing project on a new RST TreeBank construction 
and to discuss our experience of adopting the RST 
scheme for rhetoric relations annotation for Rus-
sian. We also have provided a pilot research of dif-
ferent types of discourse clues. We are going to use 
some of these clues as a seed set for bootstrapping 
some other discourse markers and map them for 
specific rhetoric relations. The survey of different 
markers extracted by the annotators is helpful for 
feature extraction for developing a discourse parser 
for Russian based on machine learning.
