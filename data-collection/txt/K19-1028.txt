Abstract

We show that the state-of-the-art Transformer
MT model is not biased towards monotonic
reordering (unlike previous recurrent neural
network models), but that nevertheless, long-
distance dependencies remain a challenge for
the model. Since most dependencies are short-
distance, common evaluation metrics will be
little influenced by how well systems perform
on them. We therefore propose an automatic
approach for extracting challenge sets replete
with long-distance dependencies, and argue
that evaluation using this methodology pro-
vides a complementary perspective on system
performance. To support our claim, we com-
pile challenge sets for English-German and
German-English, which are much larger than
any previously released challenge set for MT.
The extracted sets are large enough to allow re-
liable automatic evaluation, which makes the
proposed approach a scalable and practical so-
lution for evaluating MT performance on the
long-tail of syntactic phenomena.1

1 Introduction

The assumption that proximate source words are
more likely to correspond to proximate target
words has often been introduced as a bias (hence-
forth, locality bias) into statistical MT systems
(Brown et al., 1993; Koehn et al., 2003; Chiang,
2005). While reordering phenomena, abundant for
some language pairs, violate this simplifying as-
sumption, it has often proved to be a useful in-
ductive bias in practice, especially when comple-
mented with targeted techniques for addressing
non-monotonic translation (e.g., Och, 2002; Chi-
ang, 2005). For example, if an adjective precedes
a noun in one language and modifies it syntacti-
cally, it is likely that their corresponding words

sets.

will appear close to each other in the translation
— i.e., they may not be immediately adjacent or
even in the same order in the translation, but it is
unlikely that they will be arbitrarily distant from
one another.

In the era of Neural Machine Translation
(NMT), such biases are implicitly introduced by
the sequential nature of the LSTM architecture
(Bahdanau et al., 2015, see §2). The influential
Transformer model (Vaswani et al., 2017) replaces
the sequential LSTMs with self-attention, which
does not seem to possess this bias. We show
that the default implementation of the Transformer
does retain some bias, but that it can be relieved by
using learned positional embeddings (§3).

Long-distance dependencies (LDD) between
words and phrases present a long-standing prob-
lem for MT (Sennrich, 2016), as they are gener-
ally more difficult to detect (indeed, they pose an
ongoing challenge for parsing as well (Xu et al.,
2009)), and often result in non-monotonic transla-
tion if the target differs from the source in terms
of its word order and lexicalization patterns. The
Transformer’s indifference to the absolute position
of the tokens raises the question of whether long-
distance dependencies are still an open problem.

We address this question by proposing an auto-
matic method to compile challenge sets for evalu-
ating system performance on LDD (§4). We dis-
tinguish between two main LDD types: (1) re-
ordering LDD, namely cases where source and tar-
get words largely correspond to one another but
are ordered differently; (2) lexical LDD, where the
way a word or a contiguous expression on the tar-
get side is translated is dependent on non-adjacent
words on the source side.

We define a methodology for extracting both
LDD types. For reordering LDD, we build on
Birch (2011), whereas for lexical LDD we com-
pile a list of linguistic phenomena that yield LDD,

and use a dependency parser to find instances of
these phenomena in the source side of a paral-
lel corpus. As a test case, we apply this method
to construct challenge sets (§4.2) for German-
English and English-German. The approach can
be easily scaled to other languages for which a
good enough parser exists.

Experimenting both with RNN and self-
attention NMT architectures, we find that although
the latter presents no locality bias, LDD remain
challenging. Moreover, lexical LDD become in-
creasingly challenging with their distance, sug-
gesting that syntactic distance remains an impor-
tant determinant of performance in state-of-the-art
(SoTA) NMT.

We conclude that evaluating LDD using tar-
geted challenge sets gives a detailed picture of MT
performance, and underscores challenges the field
has yet to fully address. As particular types of
LDD are not frequent enough to significantly af-
fect coarse-grained measures, such as BLEU (Pa-
pineni et al., 2002) or TER (Snover et al., 2006),
our evaluation approach provides a complemen-
tary perspective on system performance.

2 Related Work

2.1 Long-distance Dependencies in MT

A common architecture for text-to-text genera-
tion tasks is the (Bi)LSTM encoder-decoder (Bah-
danau et al., 2015). This architecture consists of
several LSTM layers for the encoder and the de-
coder and a thin attention layer connecting them.
LSTM is a recurrent network with a state vec-
tor it updates. At every step, it discards some of
the current and past information and aggregates
the rest into the state. Any information about
the past comes from this state, which is a learned
“summary” of the previous states (cf. Greff et al.,
2017). Hence, for information to reach a cer-
tain prediction step, it should be stored and then
kept throughout the intermediate steps (tokens).
While theoretically information could be kept in-
definitely (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997),
practical evidence shows that LSTMs performance
decreases with the distance between the trigger
and the prediction (Linzen et al., 2016; Liu et al.,
2018), and that they have difficulties generalizing
over sequence lengths (Suzgun et al., 2018).

Despite being affected by absolute distances
between syntactically dependent tokens (Linzen
et al., 2016), LSTMs tend to learn to a certain

extent structural information even without being
instructed to do so explicitly (Gulordava et al.,
2018). Futrell and Levy (2018) discuss similar lin-
guistic phenomena to what we discuss in §4.2, and
show that LSTM encoder-decoder systems handle
them better than previous N-gram based systems,
despite being profoundly affected by distance.

Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) models are
also encoder-decoder, but instead of LSTMs, they
use self-attention. Self-attention is based on gat-
ing all outputs of the previous layer as inputs for
the current one; put differently, it aggregates all
the input in one step. This approach makes infor-
mation from all parts of the input sequence equally
reachable. While this is not the only architecture
with such attributes (van den Oord et al., 2016),
we focus on it due to its SoTA results for MT
(Lakew et al., 2018). The Transformer’s use of
self-attention inspired other works in related fields
(Devlin et al., 2018), some of which attributed
their performance gains to the model’s ability to
capture long-range context (Müller et al., 2018).

As the Transformer does not aggregate input
sequentially, token positions must be represented
through other means. For that purpose, the embed-
ding of each input token W is concatenated with
an embedding of its position in the source sentence
P . While positional embeddings can generally be
any vectors, two implementations are commonly
used (Tebbifakhr et al., 2018; Guo et al., 2018):
learned positional embeddings (learnedPEs; P is
randomly initialized), and sine positional embed-
dings (SinePEs) defined as:

P(pos,2i) = sin(pos/10, 000
2i/dim)

P(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/10, 000
2i/dim)

where dim is the dimension of the embedding.
Vaswani et al. (2017) report that they see no ben-
efit in learnedPEs, and hence use SinePEs, which
have much fewer parameters.

Most of the dependencies between words are
short. Short-distance linguistic dependencies in-
clude some of the most common phenomena in
language, such as determination, modification by
an adjective and compounding. For example, 62%
of the dependencies in the standard UD EWT
training set (Silveira et al., 2014) are between to-
kens that are up to one word apart. It stands to rea-
son that the locality bias is useful in these cases.
Nevertheless, as system quality improves, rarer,
more challenging dependencies become a priority,



293

and languages present a countless number of long-
distance reordering phenomena (Deng and Xue,
2017). One example is subject-verb agreement,
where a correct translation requires that the verb
is inflected according to the headword of the sub-
ject (e.g., in English “dogs that ..., bark”, while “a
dog that ..., barks”). When translating such cases,
a locality bias may impede performance, by bias-
ing the model not to attend to both the subject’s
head and the main verb (which may be arbitrarily
distant), thereby disallowing it to correctly inflect
the main verb.

Due to the benefits of the locality bias, it
featured prominently in statistical MT, including
in the IBM models, where alignments are con-
strained not to cross too much (Brown et al.,
1993), and in predicting probabilities of reorder-
ings (Koehn et al., 2003; Chiang, 2005). Diffi-
culties in handling LDD have motivated the devel-
opment of syntax-based MT (Yamada and Knight,
2001), that can effectively represent reordering at
the phrase level, such as when translating between
VSO and SOV languages. However, syntax-
based MT models remain limited in their ability
to map between arbitrarily different word orders
(Sun et al., 2009; Xiong et al., 2012). For exam-
ple, reorderings that violate the assumption that
the trees form contiguous phrases would be dif-
ficult for most such models to capture. In the next
section (§3) we show that the Transformer, when
implemented with learnedPEs, presents no locality
bias, and hence can, in principle, learn dependen-
cies between any two positions of the source, and
use them at any step during decoding.

2.2 MT Evaluation

With major improvements in system performance,
crude assessments of performance are becoming
less satisfying, i.e., evaluation metrics do not give
an indication on the performance of MT systems
on important challenges for the field (Isabelle and
Kuhn, 2018). String-similarity metrics against
a reference are known to be partial and coarse-
grained aspects of the task (Callison-Burch et al.,
2006), but are still the common practice in vari-
ous text generation tasks. However, their opaque-
ness and difficulty to interpret have led to efforts
to improve evaluation measures so that they will
better reflect the requirements of the task (Ander-
son et al., 2016; Sulem et al., 2018; Choshen and
Abend, 2018b), and to increased interest in defin-

ing more interpretable and telling measures (Lo
and Wu, 2011; Hodosh et al., 2013; Birch et al.,
2016; Choshen and Abend, 2018a).

A promising path forward is complement-
ing string-similarity evaluation with linguistically
meaningful challenge sets. Such sets have the ad-
vantage of being interpretable: they test for spe-
cific phenomena that are important for humans
and are crucial for language understanding. In-
terpretability also means that evaluation artefacts
are more likely to be detected earlier. So far,
such challenge sets were constructed for French-
English (Isabelle et al., 2017; Isabelle and Kuhn,
2018) and English-Swedish (Ahrenberg, 2018) 2.
Previous challenge sets were compiled by manu-
ally searching corpora for specific phenomena of
interest (e.g., yes-no questions which are formu-
lated differently in English and French). These
corpora are carefully made but are small in size
(ten examples per phenomenon), which means that
evaluation must be done manually as well.

As our methodology extracts sentences auto-
matically based on parser output, we are able to
compile much larger challenge sets, which allows
us to apply standard MT measures to each sub-
corpus corresponding to a specific phenomenon.
The methodology is, therefore, more flexible, and
can be straightforwardly adapted to accommodate
future advances in MT evaluation.

3 Locality in SoTA NMT
In this section we show that encoder-decoder mod-
els based on BiLSTM with attention (see §2), do
exhibit a locality bias, but that the Transformer,
whose encoder is based on self-attention, and in
which token position is encoded only through
learnedPEs, does not present any such bias.

3.1 Methodology

In order to test whether an NMT system presents
a locality bias in a controlled environment, we
examine a setting of arbitrary absolute order of
the source-side tokens. In this case, systems that
are predisposed towards monotonic decoding are
likely to present lower performance, while sys-
tems that have no predisposition as to the order
of the target side tokens relative to the source-side
tokens are not expected to show any change in per-

2In WMT 2019 English-German phenomena were tested
with a new corpus, using both human and automatic evalua-
tion. It is not possible, however, to use this evaluation outside
the competition (Avramidis et al., 2019).

formance. In order to create a controlled setting,
where source-side token order is arbitrary, we ex-
tract fixed length sentences, and apply the same
permutation to all of them. We then train systems
with the permuted source-side data (and the same
target-side data), and compare results to a control
condition where no permutation is applied.

Concretely, we experiment on a German-
English setting, extracting all sentences of the
most common length (18) from the WMT2015
(Bojar et al., 2015) training data. This results in
130,983 sentences, of which we hold out 1,000
sentences for testing. It is comparable in training
set size to a low-resource language setting.

We set a fixed permutation σ : [18] → [18] and
train systems on three versions of the training data
(settings): (1) REGULAR, to be used for control;
(2) PERMUTED source-side, in which we apply
σ over all source-side tokens; (3) PERPOSEMB
where the positional embeddings of the source-
side tokens are permuted;3 and (4) REVERSED,
where tokens are input in a reverse order.

We apply the following permutation, σ, to the
source-side tokens:(

)

We did not find any property that would deem this
permutation special (examining, e.g., its decom-
position into cycles). We therefore assume that
similar results will hold for other σs as well.

We train a Transformer model, optimizing us-
ing Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2015). We set the em-
bedding size to 512, dropout rate of 0.1, 6 stack
layers in both the encoder and the decoder and 8
attention heads. We use tokenization, truecasing
and BPE (Sennrich et al., 2016) as preprocessing,
following the same protocol as (Yang et al., 2018).

We experiment both with learnedPEs, and with
SinePEs. We train the BiLSTM model using the
Nematus implementation (Sennrich et al., 2017b),
and use their supplied scripts for preprocessing,
training and testing, changing only the datasets
used. For all models, we report the highest BLEU
score on the test data for any epoch during train-
ing, and perform early stopping after 10 consecu-
tive epochs without improvement.

In the Transformer with learnedPEs, 5 repeti-
tions were done in the REGULAR setting, and 5 for

tion, we trained the BiLSTM model and the Trans-
former with SinePEs both in the REGULAR condi-
tion and in PERMUTED, each was trained once.

3.2 Results

Table 1 presents our results. We find that Nematus
BiLSTM suffers substantially from permuting the
source-side tokens, but that the Transformer does
not exhibit a locality bias. Indeed, for learned-
PEs in all settings (REGULAR, PERMUTED, RE-
VERSED and PERPOSEMB), BLEU scores are es-
sentially the same. We also find that the com-
mon practice of using fixed SinePEs does intro-
duce some bias, as attested by the small perfor-
mance drop between REGULAR and PERMUTED.
Like Vaswani et al. (2017), we find that in the
REGULAR settings, learnedPEs are not superior in
performance to SinePEs, despite having more ex-
pressive power. However, our results suggest that
the decision between learnedPEs and SinePEs is
not without consequences: learnedPEs are prefer-
able if a locality bias is undesired (this is poten-
tially the case for highly divergent language pairs).

3.3 Discussion

Finding that Transformers do not present a local-
ity bias has implications on how to construct their
input in MT settings, as well as in other tasks that
use self-attention encoders, such as image caption-
ing (You et al., 2016). It is common practice to
augment the source-side with globally-applicable



295

information, e.g., the target language in multi-
lingual MT (Johnson et al., 2017). Having no lo-
cality bias implies this additional information can
be added at any fixed point in the sequence fed
to a Transformer, provided that the positional em-
beddings do not themselves introduce such a bias.
This is not the case with BiLSTMs, which often
require introducing the same information at each
input token to allow them to be effectively used by
the system (Yao et al., 2017; Rennie et al., 2017).

4 LDD Challenge Sets

One of the stated motivations of the Transformer
model is to effectively tackle long-distance depen-
dencies, which are “a key challenge in many se-
quence transduction tasks” (Vaswani et al., 2017).
Our results from the previous section show that
indeed fixed reordering patterns are completely
transparent for Transformers. This, however, still
leaves the question of how Transformers handle
linguistic reordering patterns, which may involve
varying distances between dependent tokens.

4.1 Methodology

We propose a method for scalably compiling chal-
lenge sets to support fine-grained MT evaluation
for different types of LDD. We address two main
types:

Reordering LDD are cases where the words on
the two sides of the parallel corpus largely corre-
spond to one another, but are ordered differently.
These cases may require attending to source words
in a highly non-monotonic order, but the gener-
ation of each target word is localized to a spe-
cific region in the source sentence. For exam-
ple, in English-German, the verb in a subordinated
clause appears in a final position, while the verb in
the English source appears right after the subject.
Consider “The man that is sitting on the chair”,
and the corresponding German “Der Mann, der
auf dem Stuhl sitzt” (lit. the man, that on the
chair sits) — while the verb is placed at different
clause positions in the two cases, the words mostly
have direct correspondents. Our methodology fol-
lows Birch (2011) in detecting such phenomena
based on alignment. Concretely, we extract a word
alignment between corresponding sentences, and
collect all sentences that include a pair of aligned
words in the source and target sides, whose indices
have a difference of at least d ∈ N.

Lexical LDD are cases where the translation of
a single word or phrase is determined by non-
adjacent words on the source side. This requires
attending to two or more regions that can be arbi-
trarily distant from one another. Several phenom-
ena, such as light verbs (Isabelle and Kuhn, 2018),
are known from the linguistic and MT literature to
yield lexical LDD. Our methodology takes a pre-
defined set of such phenomena, and defines rules
for detecting each of them over dependency parses
of the source-side. See §4.2 for the list of phenom-
ena we experiment on in this paper.

Focusing on LDD, we restrict ourselves to in-
stances where the absolute distance between the
word and the dependent is at least d ∈ N. Select-
ing large enough d entails that the extracted phe-
nomena are unlikely to be memorized as a phrase
with a specific meaning (e.g., encode “make the
whole thing up” [d = 3] as a phrase, rather than
as a discontiguous phrase “make ... up” with an
argument “the whole thing”). This increases the
probability that such cases, if translated correctly,
reflect the MT systems’ ability to recognize that
such discontiguous units are likely to be translated
as a single piece.

We note, that by extracting the challenge set
based on syntactic parses, we by no means assume
these representations are internally represented by
the MT systems in any way, or assume such a
representation is required for succeeding in cor-
rectly translating such constructions. The extrac-
tion method is merely a way of finding phenomena
we have a reason to believe are difficult to trans-
late, and meaningful for language understanding.
We use Universal Dependencies (UD; Nivre et al.,
2016) as a syntactic representation, due to its
cross-lingual consistency (about 90 languages are
supported so far), which allows research on diffi-
cult LDD phenomena that recur across languages.

Our extraction methods resemble previous chal-
lenge set approaches (Isabelle et al., 2017; Isabelle
and Kuhn, 2018; Ahrenberg, 2018), in using lin-
guistically motivated sets of sentence pairs to as-
sess translation quality. However, as our extraction
method is fully automatic, it allows for the compi-
lation of much larger challenge sets over many lan-
guage pairs. The challenge sets we extract contain
hundreds or thousands of pairs (§4.2). The size
of the sets allows using any MT evaluation mea-
sures to measure performance, and is thus a much
more scalable solution than manual inspection, as



296

is commonly done in challenge set approaches.
On the other hand, an automatic methodology

has the side-effect of being noisier, and not neces-
sarily selecting the most representative sentences
for each phenomenon. For instance befinden sich
(lit. to determine) includes a verb and a reflexive
pronoun, which do not necessarily appear contigu-
ously in German. However, as befinden always ap-
pears with the reflexive sich, it might not pose a
challenge to NMT systems, which can essentially
ignore the reflexive pronoun upon translation.

4.2 A Test Case on Extracting Sets

Next, we discuss the compilation of German-
English and English-German corpora. We select
these pairs, as they are among the most studied in
MT, and comparatively high results are obtained
for them (Bojar et al., 2017). Hence, they are more
likely to benefit from a fine-grained analysis.

For the reordering LDD corpus, we align each
source and target sentences using FastAlign (Dyer
et al., 2013) and collect all sentences with at least
one pair of source-side and target-side tokens,
whose indices have a difference of at least d = 5.
For example:

Source: Wäre es ein großer Misserfolg, nicht
den Titel in der Ligue 1 zu gewinnen, wie dies
in der letzten Saison der Fall war?
Gloss: Would-be it a big failure, not the title
in the Ligue 1 to win, as this in the last season
the case was?
Target: In Ligue 1, would not winning the
title, like last season, be a big failure?

We extract lexical LDD using simple rules
over source-side parse trees, parsed with UDPipe
(Straka and Straková, 2017). For a sentence to
be selected, at least one word should separate the
detected pair of words. We picked several well-
known challenging constructions for translation
that involve discontiguous phrases: reflexive-verb,
verb-particle constructions and preposition strand-
ing. We note that while these constructions often
yield lexical LDDs, and are thus expected to be
challenging on average, some of their instances
can be translated literally (e.g., amuse oneself is
translated to amüsieren sich).

Reflexive Verbs. Prototypically, reflexivity is
the case where the subject and object corefer. Re-
flexive pronouns in English end with self or selves
(e.g., yourselves) and in German include sich,

dich, mich and uns among others. However, reflex-
ive pronouns can often change the meaning of a
verb unpredictably, and may thus lead to different
translations for non-reflexive instances of a verb,
compared to reflexive ones. For example, abheben
in German means taking off (as of a plane), but
sich abheben means standing out. Similarly, in the
example below, drängte sich translates to intrude,
while drängte normally translates to pushed.

A source sentence is said to include a reflexive
verb if one of its tokens is parsed with a reflexive
morphological feature (refl=yes).
For example:

Source: [...] es ertragen zu müssen, daß eine
unsympathische Fremde sich unaufhörlich in
ihren Familienkreis drängte.
Target: [...] to see an uncongenial alien per-
manently intruded on her own family group.

Phrasal Verbs are verbs that are made up of a
verb and a particle (or several particles), which
may change the meaning of the verb unpre-
dictably. Examples of English phrasal verbs in-
clude run into (in the sense of meet) and give in,
and in German they include examples such as ein-
laden (invite), consisting morphologically of the
particle ein and the verb laden (load).

A source sentence is said to include a phrasal
verb if a particle dependent (UD labels of
compound:prt or prt) exists in the parse. trat
in itself means stepped, but in the extracted exam-
ple below, trat. . . entgegen translates to received.
For example:

Source: [...] ich trat ihm in wahnsinniger
Wut entgegen.
Target: [...] I received him in frantic sort.

Preposition Stranding is the case where a
preposition does not appear adjacent to the ob-
ject it refers to. In English, it will often appear
at the end of the sentence or a clause. For ex-
ample, The banana she stepped on or The boy I
read the book to. Preposition stranding is common
in English and other languages such as Scandina-
vian languages or Dutch (Hornstein and Weinberg,
1981). However, in German, it is not a part of
standard written language (Beermann and Ik-Han,
2005), although it does (rarely) appear (Fanselow,
1983). We, therefore, extract this challenge set
only with English as the source side.

While preposition stranding is often regarded
as a syntactic phenomenon, we consider it here a
lexical LDD, since the translation of prepositions

(and in some cases their accompanying verbs) is
dependent on the prepositional object, which in
the case of preposition stranding, may be distant
from the preposition itself. For example, translat-
ing the car we looked for into German usually uses
the verb suchen (search), while translating the car
we looked at does not. Translating prepositions is
difficult in general (Hashemi and Hwa, 2014), but
preposition stranding is especially so, as there is
no adjacent object to assist disambiguation.

A source sentence is said to include preposition
stranding if it contains two nodes with an edge of
the type obl (oblique) or a subcategory thereof
between them, and the UD POS tag of the depen-
dent is adposition (ADP).
For example,

Source: [...] wherever she wanted to send
the hedgehog to [...]
Gloss: [...] where she the hedgehog rolled-
towards wanted [...]
Target: [...] wo sie den Igel hinrollen wollte
[...]

4.3 Experiments
We turn to evaluate SoTA NMT performance on
the extracted challenge sets.

Experimental Setup. We trained the Trans-
former on WMT2015 training data (Bojar et al.,
2015), for parameters see §3.1. For Nematus we
used the non-ensemble pre-trained model from
(Sennrich et al., 2017a). Each of the test sets, ei-
ther a baseline or a challenge sets, for the Trans-
former and Nematus used a maximum of 10k and

A clear, consistent drop from the Baseline (full cor-

former/Nematus), and the domains (Books/News).

1k sentences per set respectively.4

Two parallel corpora were used for extracting
the challenge sets. One is newstest2013 (Bojar
et al., 2015) from the news domain that is com-
monly used as a development set for English-
German. The other is the relatively unused Books
corpus (Tiedemann, 2012) from the more chal-
lenging domain of literary translation. The cor-
pora are of sizes 51K and 3K respectively. For
lexical LDD, we took the distance (d) between the
relevant words to be at least 1, meaning there is at
least one word separating them. See Tables 2, 3
for the sizes of the extracted corpora.

For evaluation, we use the MOSES implemen-
tation of BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002; Koehn
et al., 2007), and for reordering LDD, also RIBES
(Isozaki et al., 2010), which focuses on reorder-
ing. RIBES measures the correlation of n-gram
ranks between the output and the reference, where
n-gram appears uniquely and in both.

Manual Validation. To assess the ability of our
procedure to extract relevant LDDs, we manually
analyzed over 180 source German sentences ex-

4We subsample a smaller test set for Nematus, since
the most competitive model for the language pair requires
Theano. As Theano is deprecated for two years now, it cannot
run on our GPUs, which entails long inference time.

86% of the Books ones indeed contain the target

Table 6: RIBES scores on the reordering LDD chal-
lenge sets. Sentences extracted as being challenging to
reorder are harder for the Transformer (lower score).
This trend is consistent with our experiments with
BLEU. First column indicates the source language.

Results. Comparison of the overall BLEU
scores of the NMT models (Table 4) against their
performance on the challenge sets, shows that the
phenomena are challenging for both models. Both
in the small development set of newstest2013 and
the large set of Books, the challenge subparts are
more challenging across the board. For reordering
LDD, we further apply RIBES and find a similar
trend: RIBES score is lower for the reorder chal-
lenge set than the baseline (see Table 6).

In order to confirm that the distance between the
head and dependent (the “length” of the depen-

dency) is related to the observed performance drop
in the case of lexical LDD, we partition each of the
challenge sets according to their length (d), and
compare the results to a control condition, where
all instances of the phenomena listed in §4.2 are
extracted, including non-LDD instances, i.e., sen-
tences where the head and the dependent are ad-
jacent. System performance on the sliced chal-
lenge sets (Table 5) shows that performance in-
deed decreases with d. Results thus indicate that
it is not only the presence of the phenomena that
make these sets challenging, but that the challenge
increases with the distance.

We validate this main finding using manual an-
notation of German to English cases. Using two
annotators (with high agreement between them;
κ=0.79), we find that the decrease in performance
with d is replicated. We measure how many of the
detected lexical LDD are correctly translated, ig-
noring the rest of the source and output, as done
in manual challenge set approaches. We find that
60%, 54% and 38% of the cases are translated cor-
rectly for d ∈ (1, 2, 5), respectively. This suggests
that the extracted phenomena and the distance in-
deed pose a challenge, and that the automatic met-
ric we use shows the correct trend in these cases.
See Appendix 2 for details.

Discussion. Interestingly, these results hold true
for the Transformer despite its indifference to the
absolute word order. Therefore, word distance in
itself is not what makes such phenomena chal-
lenging, contrary to what one might expect from
the definition of LDD. It seems then that these



299

phenomena are especially challenging due to the
non-standard linguistic structure (e.g., syntactic
and lexical structure), and the varying distances
in which LDD manifest themselves. The models,
therefore, seem to be unable to learn the linguis-
tic structure underlying these phenomena, which
may motivate more explicit modelling of linguis-
tic biases into NMT models, as proposed by, e.g.,
Eriguchi et al. (2017) and Song et al. (2019).

We note that our experiments were not designed
to compare the performance of BiLSTM and self-
attention models. We, therefore, do not see the
Transformer’s inferior performance on Books, rel-
ative to Nematus as an indication of the general
ability of this model in out-of-domain settings.
What is evident from the results is that translat-
ing Books is a challenge in itself, probably due to
the register of the language, and the presence of
frequent non-literal translations.

A potential confound is that performance might
change with the length of the source in BiLSTMs
(Carpuat et al., 2013; Murray and Chiang, 2018),
in Transformers it was reported to increase (Zhang
et al., 2018). Length is generally greater in the
challenge set than in the full test set, and generally
increases with d, showing if anything a decrease
of performance by length. To assess whether our
corpora are challenging due to a length bias, we
randomly sample from Books 1,000 corpora with
1,000, 100 and 10 sentences each. The correla-
tion between their corresponding average length
and the Transformers’ BLEU score on them was
0.06,0.09 and 0.03 respectively. While this sug-
gests length is not a strong predictor of perfor-
mance, to verify that difficulty is not a result of
the distribution of lengths in the challenge sets we
conduct another experiment.

For each challenge set and each value of d (0–
3), we sample 100 corpora. For each sentence in a
given challenge set, we sample a sentence of no
more than a difference of 1 in length. This re-
sults in a corpus with a similar length distribution,
but sampled from the overall population of Books
sentences. Results show that the BLEU score of
the challenge sets in all German to English cases
is lower than any randomly sampled corpus.5 In
the English-German cases, trends are similar, al-
beit less pronounced. This may be due to the low
number of long English sentences, which lead to

5Most sampled corpora actually had better scores than the
baseline. We believe this is because very short sentences
which are mostly noise, are never sampled.

more homogeneous samples. Overall, results sug-
gest that length is extremely unlikely to be the only
cause for the observed trends.

5 Conclusion

As NMT system performance is constantly im-
proving, more reliable methods for identifying
and classifying their failures are needed. Much
research effort is therefore devoted to develop-
ing more fine-grained and interpretable evaluation
methods, including challenge-set approaches. In
this paper, we showed that, using a UD parser, it
is possible to extract challenge sets that are large
enough to allow scalable MT evaluation of impor-
tant and challenging phenomena.

An accumulating body of research is devoted to
the ability of modern neural architectures such as
LSTMs (Linzen et al., 2016) and pretrained em-
beddings (Hewitt and Manning, 2019; Liu et al.,
2019; Jawahar et al., 2019) to represent linguis-
tic features. This paper makes a contribution to
this literature in confirming that the Transformer
model can indeed be made indifferent to the ab-
solute order of the words, but also shows that this
does not entail that the model can overcome the
difficulties of LDD in naturalistic data. We may
carefully conclude then that despite the remark-
able feats of current NMT models, inducing lin-
guistic structure in its more evasive and challeng-
ing instances is still beyond the reach of state-
of-the-art NMT, which motivates exploring more
linguistically-informed models.
