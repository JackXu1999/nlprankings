Automatic Creation of a Sentence Aligned Sinhala-Tamil 

 Parallel Corpus 

 

 

Abstract 

A sentence aligned parallel corpus is an important prerequisite in statistical machine transla-

tion. However, manual creation of such a parallel corpus is time consuming, and requires ex-

perts fluent in both languages. Automatic creation of a sentence aligned parallel corpus using 

parallel text is the solution to this problem. In this paper, we present the first ever empirical 

evaluation carried out to identify the best method to automatically create a sentence aligned 

Sinhala-Tamil parallel corpus. Annual reports from Sri Lankan government institutions were 

used as the parallel text for aligning. Despite both Sinhala and Tamil being under-resourced 

languages, we were able to achieve an F-score value of 0.791 using a hybrid approach that 

makes use of a bilingual dictionary.  

1 Introduction 

Sentence and word aligned parallel corpora are extensively used for statistical machine translation (Al-

Onaizan et al., 1999; Callison-Burch, 2004) and  in multilingual natural language processing (NLP) 

applications (Kaur and Kaur, 2012). In recent years, parallel corpora have become more widely avail-

able and serve as a source for data-driven NLP tasks for languages such as English and French (Halle-

beek, 2000; Kaur and Kaur, 2012). 

A parallel corpus is a collection of text in one or more languages with their translation into another 

language or languages that have been stored in a machine-readable format (Hallebeek, 2000). A paral-

lel corpus can be aligned either at sentence level or word level. Sentence and word alignment of paral-

lel corpus is the identification of the corresponding sentences and words (respectively) in both halves 

of the parallel text. 

Sentence alignment could be of various combinations including one to one where one sentence 

maps to one sentence in the other corpus, one to many where one sentence maps to more than one sen-

tences in the other corpus, many to many where many sentences map to many sentences in the oth-

er corpus or even one to zero where there is no mapping for a particular sentence in the other corpus. 

For statistical machine translation, the more the number of parallel sentence pairs, the higher the 

quality of translation (Koehn, 2010). However, manual alignment of a large number of sentences is 

time consuming, and requires personnel fluent in both languages. Automatic sentence alignment of a 

parallel corpus is the widely accepted solution for this problem. Already many sentence alignment 

techniques have been implemented for some languages pairs such as English-French (Gale and 

Church, 1993; Brown et al., 1991; Chen, 1993; Braune and Fraser 2010; Lamraoui and Langlais, 

2013), English-German (Gale and Church, 1993) English-Chinese (Wu, 1994; Chuang and Yeh, 2005)

 and Hungarian-English (Varga et al., 2005; Tóth et al., 2008). However, none of these techniques 

have been evaluated for Sinhala and Tamil, the two official languages in Sri Lanka. 

This paper presents the first ever study on automatically creating a sentence aligned parallel corpus 

for Sinhala and Tamil. Sinhala and Tamil are both under-resourced languages, and research imple-

menting basic NLP tool such as POS taggers and morphological analysers is at its inception stage 

(Herath et al., 2004; Hettige and Karunananda, 2006; Anandan et al., 2002). Therefore, not all the 

aforementioned sentence alignment techniques are applicable in the context of Sinhala and Tamil. 

With this limitation in mind, an extensive literature study was carried out to identify the applicable 

sentence alignment techniques for Sinhala and Tamil. We implemented six such methods, and evalu-

ated their performance using a corpus of 1300 sentences based on the precision, recall, and F-measure 

using annual reports of Sri Lankan government departments as the source text. The highest F-measure 

value of 0.791 was obtained for Varga et al.’s (2005) Hunalign method, the hybrid method that com-

bined the use of a bilingual dictionary with the statistical method by Gale and Church (1993). 

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 identifies related work in this area. Section 3 

describes how different techniques were employed in the alignment process, and section 4 presents the 

results for these techniques. Section 5 contains a discussion of these results while section 6 presents 

the conclusion and future work.   

2 Related Work 

Automatic sentence alignment techniques can be broadly categorized into three classes: statistical, lin-

guistic, and hybrid methods. Statistical methods use quantitative measures (such as  sentence size, sen-

tence character number) to create an alignment relationship; linguistic methods use linguistic 

knowledge gained from sources such as morphological analyzers, bilingual dictionaries, and word list 

pairs, to relate sentences; hybrid methods combine the statistical and linguistic methods to achieve 

accurate statistical information (Simões, 2004).  

2.1 Statistical Methods 

Gale and Church (1993), and Brown et al. (1991) have introduced statistical methods for aligning sen-

tences that have been successfully used for European languages, including English-French, English-

German, English-Polish, English-Spanish (McEnery et al., 1997), English-Dutch and Dutch - French 

(Paulussen et al, 2013). 

These methods have also been used with Non-European languages such as English - Chinese 

(McEnery and Oakes, 1996), Italian-Japanese (Zotti et al, 2014), English-Arabic (Alkahtani et al, 

2015), and English-Malay (Yeong et al, 2016). The general idea of these methods is that the closer in 

length two sentences are, the more likely they align. Brown et al.'s (1991) method aligns sentences 

based on sentence length measured using word count. Here anchor points are used for alignment. Gale 

and Church use the number of characters as the length measure. While the parameters such as mean 

and variance for Gale and Church’s (1993) method are considered language independent for European 

languages,  tuning these for non-‘European language pairs has improved results (Zotti et al, 2014).    

Both these methods have given good accuracy in alignment; however they require some form of ini-

tial alignment or anchor points.  

Method by Chuang and Yeh (2005) exploits the statistically ordered matching of punctuation marks 

in the two languages English and Chinese to achieve high accuracy in sentence alignment compared 

with using the length-based methods alone. 

2.2 Linguistic Methods 

Linguistic methods exploit the linguistic characteristics of the source and target languages such as 

morphology and sentence structure to improve the alignment process. However linguistic methods are 

not used independently but have been introduced in conjunction with statistical methods, forming hy-

brid methods as described in the next section. 

2.3 Hybrid Methods 

Statistical methods such as that of Brown et al., (1991), and Gale and Church (1991) require either 

corpus-dependent anchor points, or prior alignment of paragraphs to obtain better accuracy. Hybrid 

125



 

methods make use of statistical as well as linguistic features of the sentences obtaining better accuracy 

in documents with or without these types of prior alignments. Hence hybrid methods are widely used 

to achieve higher accuracy in alignment. The methods by Wu (1994), Chen (1993), Moore (2002), 

Varga et al. (2005), Sennrich and Volk (2011), Lamraoui and Langlais (2013), Braune and Fra-

ser  (2010),  Tóth et al. (2008) and Mújdricza-Maydt et al. (2013) are some of them. 

The method used by Wu (1994) is a modification of Gale and Church's (1993) length-based statisti-

cal method for the task of aligning English with Chinese. It uses a bilingual external lexicon with lexi-

con cues to improve the alignment accuracy. Dynamic programming optimization has been used for 

the alignment of the lexicon extensions. However, the computation and memory costs grow linearly 

with the number of lexical cues.  

The method by Chen (1993) is a word-correspondence-based model that gives a better accuracy 

than length based methods, however, it was reported to be much slower than the algorithms of Brown 

et al., (1991) and Gale and Church (1993).  

Moore’s (2002) method aligns the corpus using a modified version of Brown et al.’s (1991) sen-

tence-length-based model in the first pass. It then uses the sentence pairs that were assigned the high-

est probability of alignment to train a modified version of IBM Translation Model 1 (one of the five 

translation models that assigns a probability to each of the possible word-by-word alignments—

developed by Brown et al. (1993)). The corpus is realigned, augmenting the initial alignment model 

with IBM Model 1, to produce an alignment based both on sentence length and word correspondences. 

It uses a novel search-pruning technique to efficiently find the sentence pairs that will be aligned with 

the highest probability without the use of anchor points or larger previously aligned units like para-

graphs or sections.  This is an effective method that gets a relatively high performance especially in 

precision. Nonetheless, this method has the drawback that it usually gets a low recall especially when 

dealing with sparse data (Trieu et al., 2015). 

Hunalign sentence alignment method by Varga et al. (2005) uses a hybrid algorithm based on a 

length-based method that makes use of a bilingual dictionary. The similarity score between a source 

and a target sentence consists of two major components, which are token-based score and length-based 

score. The token-based score depends on the number of shared words in the two sentences while the 

length-based alignment is based on the character count of the sentence.   

Varga et al.’s (2005) method uses a dictionary-based crude translation model instead of a full IBM 

translation model as used by Moore (2002). This has the very important advantage that it can exploit a 

bilingual lexicon, if one is available, and tune it according to frequencies in the target corpus. Moore’s 

(2002) method offers no such way to tune a pre-existing language model. Moreover, the focus of 

Moore’s (2002) algorithm on one-to-one alignments is less than optimal, since excluding one-to-many 

and many-to-many alignments may result in losing substantial amounts of aligned material if the two 

languages have different sentence structuring conventions (Varga et al., 2005).  

Bleualign sentence aligner by Sennrich and Volk (2011) is based on the BLEU (bilingual evaluation 

understudy) score, which is an algorithm for evaluating the quality of text that has been machine-

translated from one natural language to another. Instead of computing an alignment between the 

source and target text directly, this technique bases its alignment search on a Machine Translation 

(MT) of the source text.  

The YASA method by Lamraoui and Langlais (2013) also operates a two-step process through the 

parallel data. Cognates are first recognized in order to accomplish a first token-level alignment that 

(efficiently) delimits a fruitful search space. Then, sentence alignment is performed on this reduced 

search space. The speed of the YASA aligner and memory use is comparatively better than Moore’s 

(2002) aligner (Lamraoui and Langlais, 2013).   

Though the method by Braune and Fraser (2010) is four times slower than Moore’s (2002) method, 

it supports one to many and many to one alignments as well. It uses an improved pruning method and 

in the second pass, the sentences are optimally aligned and merged. This method uses a two-step clus-

tering approach in the second pass of the alignment.   

The method by Tóth et al. (2008) exploits the fact that Named Entities cannot be ignored from any 

translation process, so a sentence and its translation equivalent contain the same Named Entities.  

The method by Mújdricza-Maydt et al. (2013) uses a two-step process to align sentences. Machine 

alignments known as “wood standard” annotations, produced using state-of-the-art sentence aligners 

in a first step, are used in a second step, to train a discriminative learner. This combination of arbitrary 

126



 

amounts of machine aligned data and an expressive discriminative learner provides a boost in preci-

sion. All features used in the second step, with the exception of the POS agreement feature, are lan-

guage-independent. 

According to Gale and Church (1993) a considerably large parallel corpus having a small error per-

centage can be built without lexical constraints. According to the authors, lexical constraints might 

slow down the program and make it less useful in the first pass. Linguistic methods can produce better 

results if the performance of the system is not a concern. Hybrid methods such as that of Moore’s 

(2002) that do not require particular knowledge about the corpus or the languages involved are faster 

as they tend to build the bilingual dictionary for aligning using the input to the aligner based on previ-

ous word-correspondence-based models.   

Furthermore, results of some of the above methods such as Hunalign (Varga et al, 2005), Bleualign 

(Sennrich and Volk, 2011) and Gargantua (Braune and Fraser, 2010) could be improved by applying 

linguistic factors such as word forms, chunks and collocations (Navlea and Todiraşcu, 2010). Some 

have used morphologically processed (lemmatized and morphologically tagged) data and have used 

taggers (POS tagger) because it significantly increases the value of the data (Bojar et al, 2014). 

2.4 Indic Languages 

Automatic alignment of sentences has been attempted for few Indic language pairs from the South 

Asian subcontinent including Hindi-Urdu (Kaur and Kaur, 2012) and Hindi-Punjabi (Kumar and Goy-

al, 2010). This research used the method proposed by Gale and Church (1993) citing the close linguis-

tic similarities between languages of these pairs, causing parallel sentences to be of similar lengths. 

3 Methodology 

3.1 Data Source 

The parallel corpus used in aligning sentences is from annual reports published by different govern-

ment departments in Sri Lanka. These government reports have been manually translated from Sinhala 

to Tamil by translators with different levels of experience in translation and Sinhala-Tamil competen-

cy. Thus the quality of the translations compared to other sources such as those from the Parliament of 

Sri Lanka is comparatively low with a considerable number of omissions and mistranslations. 

These annual reports are in pdf format. Text was automatically extracted from the pdf documents, 

and converted to Unicode to ensure uniformity. The text thus obtained was segmented into sentences 

using a custom tokenization algorithm implemented specifically for Tamil and Sinhala.  

Although there are some tokenizers for Sinhala1 and Tamil, they could not be used for this purpose, 

since the abbreviations used in our input text are different from those in the existing tokenizers. There-

fore we created a list of manually extracted abbreviations. Splitting documents into sentences was 

done by using delimiters such as “ ., ? , ! ”. Splitting into sentences using full stops is misleading at 

abbreviations, decimal digits, e-mails, URLs etc., because full stops at these places are not actual sen-

tence boundaries. Therefore splitting into sentences at these points was avoided by means of regular 

expression checks. However issues such as omissions of punctuation marks result in the need for com-

plex alignments (one to many, many to many). 

For example2 the following sentences in Sinhala specify five cities (Kuruwita, Rathnapura, Bal-

angoda, Godakawela, Opanayake) followed by the sentence "The Active Committee representing the 

Operations Co-ordination Centers for Language Associations in Vavuniya was established". 

(කුරුවිට,රත්නපුර,බලංග ොඩ, ග ොඩකගෙල,  ඕපනායක). 
ෙවුනියාෙ භාෂා සං ම් ගෙගෙයුම් ෙධ යස්ථාන ක රියාකාරී කමිටුෙ ස්ථාපිත කරන ලදී. 

However due to the omission of the period in the corresponding Tamil text, the above is identified 

as one single sentence in Tamil requiring the alignment to map one Tamil sentence to many Sinhala 

sentences.

The bilingual dictionary used for alignment was obtained from the trilingual dictionary3 combined 

with the glossaries obtained from the Department of Official languages4, Sri Lanka. The number of 

words in the lexicon obtained has around 90000 words, but it does not have all the commonly used 

words in the languages and mostly has the spoken forms of words in Sinhala, which are not used in the 

written official documents. 

3.2 Sentence Alignment 

Depending on the similarities and dissimilarities between the languages and the quality of the data 

source, different techniques discussed in section 2 have given different results for the alignment for 

different language pairs. For example, a method like that of Chuang and Yeh (2005) would work well 

for parallel text where punctuations are consistent, while that of Varga et al. (2005) would work better 

for languages that lack etymological relations. Thus the objective of this research is to experiment with 

these techniques for Sinhala-Tamil, and identify the best technique. 

However, not all methods described in section 2 can be used in the context of Sinhala and Tamil. 

For example, methods by Tóth et al. (2008) and Mújdricza-Maydt et al. (2013) cannot be used because 

NER systems and comprehensive POS taggers are not fully developed for Sinhala (Dahanayaka and 

Weerasinghe, 2014; Manamini et al., 2016) and Tamil (Pandian et al., 2008; Vijayakrishna and Devi, 

2008). Also methods that align using the punctuations in the two languages similar to that of Chuang 

and Yeh (2005) cannot be used in this case because when extracting text from pdf, some punctuations 

are lost, and also the translators of the original text have not been consistent with the use of punctua-

tions.    

Constrained by the available resources, we compared methods by Gale and Church (1993), Moore 

(2002), Varga et al. (2005), Braune and Fraser (2010), Lamraoui and Langlais (2013), and Sennrich 

and Volk (2011). These methods have shown promising results for languages that show close linguis-

tic relationships, which is also the case with Sinhala and Tamil. These close linguistic relationships 

include similarities in word or sentence length, similarities in sentence structure and in languages that 

use the character set, similarities between words. Linguistic similarities between Sinhala and Tamil 

include word and sentence length similarities and sentence structure similarity with both Sinhala and 

Tamil following a Subject-Object-Verb structure. 

The mean and variance for the number of Tamil characters per Sinhala was found and these values 

were used for the Gale and Church’s (1993) method. Default values were used for the other methods 

during the evaluation. 
For Moore’s (2002) method, a bilingual word dictionary is built using the IBM Model 1. However, 

this dictionary may lack significant vocabulary when the input corpus contains sparse data, as pointed 

out by Trieu and Nguyen (2015). The output files from this method contain all the sentences from the 

input files that align 1-to-1 with probability greater than the “threshold” according to the statistical 

model computed by the aligner. For evaluation using this method we used a threshold of 0.8 instead of 

the default value of 0.5. 

Around 1300 sentences were extracted from pdf files and were aligned using these methods. This 

corpus is publicly available3 for the benefit of Sinhala and Tamil language computing. The same sen-

tences were manually aligned with the help of a human translator. Then the automatically aligned sen-

tences were compared with the manually aligned sentences to obtain the precision and recall values.   

4 Evaluation 

The evaluation for sentence alignment was done by using data that was manually aligned. The reason 

for this approach instead of getting the human translator to evaluate the automatically aligned sentenc-

es was to ensure that the manual evaluation was independent from the automatically produced output, 

as the automated alignments may influence the human aligner. Furthermore this approach also facili-

tated the comparison of the performance of multiple methods.  Table 1 shows the precision, recall, and 

F-measure obtained for the six methods.

5 Discussion 

Most of the above methods (Gale and Church, 1993; Brown et al., 1991; Chen and S.F, 1993; Braune 

and Fraser, 2010) have been first used for English and French sentence alignment. Both these lan-

guages have many similarities, which include the sentence structure and the sentence length. The sen-

tence structure of these languages is of the form subject-verb-object and the sentence length is quite 

close. 

The same similarities can also be found in Sinhala and Tamil languages. Sinhala and Tamil lan-

guages have the same sentence structure, Subject-Object-Verb. Also the average sentence lengths of 

the two languages are quite close. Considering 700 sentences, average length of Sinhala is 113.76 and 

for Tamil it is 130.53. Therefore statistical methods have given good results in our case. The lexical 

components used in the hybrid methods suggested above are also language independent. Thus the hy-

brid methods are also applicable for Sinhala and Tamil.   

We used Gale and Church (1993) method even though we could not align the paragraphs before 

aligning the sentences, due the dissimilarities among the text converted from pdfs. The length of Tamil 

sentences was comparatively higher than Sinhala sentences and the correlation between Sinhala and 

Tamil was comparatively low, hence we cannot consider mean and variance as language independent 

as suggested by Gale and Church (1993). Therefore we calculated the mean and variance for Sinhala 

and Tamil using 700 sentences. Gale and Church (1993) introduced 1 as mean and 6.8 as variance for 

English and French Languages. For Sinhala and Tamil, we figured out mean is 1.152 and variance is 

1.860. Even after changing the parameters for Sinhala and Tamil in the Gale and Church  (1993) 

method, we obtained a comparatively low precision because this method does not only look at one to 

one alignments but also one to zero, many to one, one to many or many to many alignments. Also ac-

cording to Gale and Church (1993), in this method one to zero alignment is never handled correctly. 

Most misalignments arise due to one to zero, many to one to many or many to many alignments, re-

sulting in methods that consider only one to one alignments to have better precision values. Given the 

nature of the source documents used in this research, there were a significant non one-to-one align-

ments and incorrect translations, which affected the precision value. However, as this method omits 

only a few sentences, it obtains high recall and F-Score than some of the other methods.  

Since the text used for alignment in our case has considerably sparse data, the dictionary built in the 

Moore’s (2002) method lacks significant vocabulary. Furthermore because of the fact that Moore’s 

(2002) method only considers one to one alignment, the recall obtained by this method is very low 

while the precision is very high. In our case, even though there are alignments that are not one to one, 

the high precision of Moore’s method has shown that it is possible to align a considerable number of 

sentences only by using one to one alignments. According to Moore (2002), in practice one to one 

alignments are the only alignments that are currently used for training machine translation systems. 

The YASA aligner by Lamraoui and Langlais (2013) has proven to be robust to noise by having a 

good precision and recall for the parallel corpus of Sinhala and Tamil. Also the Braune and Fraser’s 

(2010) method is known to work better especially for corpora where the sentences do not align one to 

one that often. However, our source text has a number of one to one alignments (as was proved by the 

alignment in Moore's (2002) method) along with other forms of alignments, which could be the reason 

for the low recall of this method. 

Even though the method by Varga et al. (2005) has given the highest F-score, the results for this 

method could be improved using a better dictionary that includes all or most of the words that are used 

in the annual reports.

A factor significantly affecting the results of the alignment process was the quality of the source 

documents. Compared to other documents such as parliamentary documents, news articles and subti-

tles commonly used in evaluating alignment, the annual reports we considered were of comparatively 

less quality including significant omissions and inconsistencies and high complexity with significant 

many to one, one to many, and many to many alignments. The data set considered comprised of nearly 

7% many to one, one to many or many to many alignments and nearly 15% one to zero or zero to one 

alignments indicating improper or incomplete translations.   

6 Conclusion 

We have addressed the problem of the lack of sentence aligned Sinhala-Tamil parallel corpus large 

enough to be useful in a multitude of natural language processing tasks. We have experimented with a 

number of alignment techniques developed for other language pairs, introducing necessary modifica-

tions for Sinhala and Tamil, where applicable. 

The results generated have been satisfactory, indicating that better results could be obtained with 

more language resources such as morphological analyzers, POS taggers and named entity recognizers, 

which are currently not fully developed for Sinhala. This research is carried out as part of a major pro-

ject to build a machine translation system between Sinhala and Tamil. POS taggers and named entity 

recognizers are being developed as part of this larger project. With the availability of these resources, 

methods utilizing these resources could also be introduced for Sinhala and Tamil in the near future, to 

obtain improved results.    

Future work in improving the automatic generation of the Sinhala-Tamil parallel corpus includes 

experimenting with more techniques that have worked for other language pairs. The suitability of 

techniques that specifically use language resources such as POS taggers and morphological analysers 

could also be evaluated with the availability of such resources of better quality. Additionally the iden-

tified techniques could be evaluated with documents from different domains, whereas in this research 

evaluation has been done only with annual reports.
