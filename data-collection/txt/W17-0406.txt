Abstract

The goal of this paper is to survey anno-
tation of ellipsis in Universal Dependen-
cies (UD) 2.0 treebanks. In the long term,
knowing the types and frequencies of el-
liptical constructions is important for pars-
ing experiments focused on ellipsis, which
was also our original motivation. How-
ever, the current state of annotation is still
far from perfect, and thus the main out-
come of the present study is a description
of errors and inconsistencies; we hope that
it will help improve the future releases.

1 Introduction

Elliptic constructions (ellipsis) are linguistic phe-
nomena which refer to the omission of a word or
several words from a sentence. Themeaning of the
omitted words, however, can be understood in the
context of the remaining elements. For instance, in
the sentence “John gave a flower to Mary and [he
gave] a book to his son” (an example from (Hajič
et al., 2015)) the second predicate and its subject
are omitted because of ellipsis. From the syntactic
point of view, this significantly alters the sentence
structure.

Ellipsis exists in themajority of languages (Mer-
chant, 2001a) and thus deserves careful attention in
theoretical and empirical studies, and with regard
to NLP applications. Themost difficult types of el-
lipsis (which are the focus of this paper) tend to be
rare in comparison to other grammatical patterns,
which makes them hard to learn and recognize by
parsers. The parsers’ ability to recognize elliptic
constructions also heavily depends on the annota-
tion scheme used in a particular corpus: some an-
notation schemes make ellipsis more visible and
identifiable than others.

There is a number of previous dependency anal-
yses of ellipsis. (Mel’čuk, 1988) proposed to use

a node labeled as elided, for instance, in the sen-
tence “Alan went to Paris and Leo to Coruña” (an
example from (Polguère and others, 2009)), the
second verb is marked as elided and thus is in-
visible. (Lombardo and Lesmo, 1998) used non-
lexical nodes and so called non-primitive depen-
dency rules to express gapped coordination. (Os-
borne et al., 2012) introduced the catena concept
and described the elidedmaterial of ellipsismecha-
nisms in terms of catena. (Kahane, 1997) proposed
“bubble trees” for gapped coordination.

In this paper we will focus on the basic repre-
sentation of Universal Dependencies (UD) (Nivre
et al., 2016), in which most types of ellipsis are
solved by dependent promotion and thus are invis-
ible, i.e., not explicitly annotated as ellipsis; the
only exception is missing predicate with multiple
overt dependents (orphans). Section 2 gives a brief
overview of common ellipsis types and their anal-
ysis in UD.

2 Classification

According to (Testelets, 2011), a single rule that
motivates elliptical constructions cannot be de-
fined even within one language. The UD guide-
lines define the following set of rules that proposes
a solution for the representation of elliptic con-
structions:

• If the elided element has no overt dependents,
no special relation is required;

• If the elided element has overt dependents,
one of those dependents is promoted to take
the role of the head;

Following are examples of constructions solved
this way:

2.1 Ellipsis in Nominals
When the head noun of a noun phrase is elided
(Corver and van Koppen, 2009), according to the

Figure 1: Slovak: An example of adjective coordination, which semantically corresponds to coordination
of two full nominals (slovenskej [vedeckej verejnosti] i medzinárodnej vedeckej verejnosti), but the UD
approach is to analyze it just as coordinate modifiers. While we consider this approach correct, note
that promoting the adjective slovenskej to the head position of the first nominal phrase would lead to a
different result: the noun verejnosti would be connected to slovenskej as a conjunct, as shown by the
dotted relations below the text.

UD guidelines, one of the orphaned dependents
should be promoted to the head position and the
other dependents (if any) are attached via the same
relations that would be used with the elided head.
As a result, there are no means to detect this type
of ellipsis in the data (except for unusual POS
tag-dependency combinations, such as an adjec-
tive serving as a subject).

Coordination of adjectival modifiers can be seen
as a special case of an elided noun; however, in this
case the usual approach in UD is to just coordinate
the adjectives (Figure 1).

2.2 Comparative Deletion
Ellipsis occurs commonly in the complement
clause of comparative constructions: in “He plays
better drunk than sober,” the full meaning is actu-
ally “He plays better [when he is] drunk than [how
he plays when he is] sober.”

Here, too, “sober” is promoted all the way up
to the head of the adverbial clause that modifies
“better”. The relation between the two adjectives
is still clausal (advcl); together with the missing
subject and copula, these are indirect signs that be-
tray the ellipsis. However, there is no explicit an-
notation of it.

2.3 Sluicing
Sluicing refers to reduced interrogative clauses,
often to a bare interrogative word (Merchant,
2001b). In the following example from UD En-
glish, the content in brackets is understandable

from the previous sentence: “It’s easy to under-
stand why [the cats refused to eat it].”

Following the UD promotion rules, “why”
should be promoted to the head position of the
elided complement clause and attached to “under-
stand” via the ccomp relation. (As a matter of fact,
it is currently attached as advmod, which we think
is an error.)

2.4 VP Ellipsis and Pseudogapping
If a non-finite verb phrase has been elided but
a finite auxiliary verb has not, the auxiliary is
promoted. Such constructions are called VP-
ellipsis (Johnson, 2001) and pseudogapping (Las-
nik, 1999). Like with elided nominals, promoting
the auxiliary makes these types difficult to iden-
tify in the treebank (but see Figure 6 for a counter-
example.) Note that the same applies to clauses
with non-verbal predicates where the predicate is
elided and only copula remains (and is promoted):
“John is not smart but Mary is.”

2.5 Gapping and Stripping
Gapping means that the entire predicate is elided,
including auxiliary verbs; however, two or more
arguments or adjuncts (“orphans”) are overtly ex-
pressed1 (Johnson, 2001; Johnson, 2009; Sag,
1976).

1Note that the v2 guidelines mistakenly required the or-
phans to be core dependents. We argue and demonstrate that
the same situation can be caused also by oblique arguments
or adjuncts.

Figure 4: The enhanced UD v2 annotation, currently available only for English, Finnish and Russian,
uses reconstructed “empty nodes” to represent the elided predicate (gave).

In the UD v1 guidelines, the remnant relation
was used “to reconstruct predicational or verbal
material in the case of gapping or stripping” (de
Marneffe et al., 2014); see Figure 2. Practical
application showed that such treatment of elliptic
constructions has several disadvantages:

• The remnant relation does not produce a
clear representation if the second clause con-
tains additional modifiers of the elided predi-
cate;

• The antecedent of the remnant may not exist
in the same sentence;

• The annotation style generates many non-
projective and parallel structures, thus reduc-
ing parsing quality (Nivre andNilsson, 2005).

The orphan relation is introduced to specify el-
lipsis more transparently2 in the UD guidelines v2

2http://universaldependencies.org/u/
overview/specific-syntax.html#ellipsis

(Figure 3). One of the orphaned dependents is
promoted and the others are attached to it via the
orphan relation. An obliqueness hierarchy is de-
fined, inspired by (Pollard and Sag, 1994);3 the de-
pendent higher in the hierarchy is promoted. The
orphan relation is the only explicit annotation of
ellipsis in the basic representation of UD, i.e. only
constructions of this type can be easily identified
in the data.

UD v2 also defines an enhanced representation
where the elided material can be reconstructed us-
ing empty nodes (Figure 4). Such representation is
currently available only in three treebanks and we
do not investigate it further in the present work.
Therefore we will focus on the orphan relation in
the rest of the paper.

Even more radical reduction is stripping (Han-
kamer and Sag, 1976) where only one argument re-
mains, assuming that the rest would be identical to

3nsubj > obj > iobj > obl > advmod > csubj > xcomp
> ccomp > advcl

50



the previous clause. However, the orphaned argu-
ment is usually accompanied at least by an adverb
like “too” or “not”. This puts stripping in a gray
zone that is not clearly delimited in the UD guide-
lines. Either we treat the adverb as just a connect-
ing function word, and we attach it to the promoted
argument as cc or advmod. Or we treat it as gap-
ping, i.e. the relation is orphan (Figure 9). We
cannot quantify the two approaches but both have
been observed in the treebanks.

3 Ellipsis in Numbers

Table 1 summarizes the statistics of elliptical con-
structions in the UD 2.0 treebanks (Nivre et al.,
2017). The treebanks are sorted by the last column,
which shows the ratio of orphan relations to the
total number of nodes in the treebank. 41 treebanks
have at least 1 orphan relation in the data, but only
12 treebanks have more than 100 sentences with
orphans. Most treebanks have less than 1 orphan
per 10,000 nodes, but several treebanks are signif-
icantly higher, peaking with the PROIEL treebank
of Ancient Greek, which has an orphan in every
500 nodes (Figure 5 shows an example from that
treebank).

The number of treebanks which mark elliptic
constructions explicitly has doubled since UD re-
lease 1.4 (Table 2). However, 29 treebanks from
UD 2.0 do not use the orphan relation at all. Some
of them are large enough to assume that the stud-
ied type of ellipsis actually occurs there but is not
annotated properly (we try to address this problem
in Section 4.2). Most UD treebanks are conver-
sions of older data annotated under different an-
notation schemes. If the original scheme does not
mark missing predicates somehow, it may not be
possible to identify the orphan relations within an
automatic conversion procedure.

4 Typical Patterns

Based on the UD guidelines for the orphan rela-
tion, one would expect that the most frequent pat-
tern with orphan is coordination of clauses where
only the first clause has an overt verbal predicate,
while it has been elided from the subsequent con-
juncts (clauses). The trees in Figure 3 and Fig-
ure 7 are examples of such pattern. However, co-
ordination is not the only possible configuration—
Figures 5 and 6 show subordination in a compara-
tive construction. The latter is somewhat less typi-
cal in that a copula is promoted but one dependent

Figure 7: Portuguese: “O homem fuma entre 11 e 20 cigarros por dia e a mulher, entre 5 e 10.” (“The
man smokes between 11 and 20 cigarettes per day, and the woman between 5 and 10.”) The subject of the
second clause is promoted and the object is attached to it as orphan. Note that there are other instances
of ellipsis, too: entre 5 e 10 [cigarros] (solved by simple promotion of 5), and even the first range, entre
11 e 20 cigarros, in fact stands for entre 11 [cigarros] e 20 cigarros.

phans is rather wide. Core arguments (subjects
and objects) are the prototypical cases but oblique
arguments or adjuncts (including adverbial modi-
fiers) cannot be excluded (see Figure 8). A spe-
cial case is the yes-no opposition, rendered in
some languages as coordination of a full affirma-
tive verb, and a negative element (without repeat-
ing the main verb). Figure 9 demonstrates this on
Czech. Note that a similar English sentence would
not need the orphan relation: in “they got a meal
and I didn’t”, there is an obligatory auxiliary verb
in the second part, which gets promoted to the head
position.

4.1 Annotation Errors

Ellipsis is a difficult phenomenon, and annotation
of ellipsis is a difficult task. Since we are dealing
with material missing from the sentence, various
annotation styles also miss various bits of infor-
mation; automatic conversion between annotation
styles may have to employ heuristics, and some-
times the correct analysis cannot be obtained with-
out a human in the loop. It is thus not surpris-
ing that some of the most common “patterns” we
observed in the data are annotation errors. We
do not present a complete quantitative evaluation
though—we were not able to check all orphans in

all treebanks. However, Table 3 shows some fig-
ures for a small number of treebanks. We think
that these figures could help contributors to im-
prove their data, but they do not provide a com-
plete overview of the phenomena that are misrep-
resented in UD treebanks, e.g., the 100% error rate
in Spanish AnCora is caused exclusively by er-
roneous assignment of orphan relation instead of
conj relation; the figures for Belarusian and Por-
tuguese cannot be interpreted in a statistically sig-
nificant way due to small number of sentences con-
taining the orphan relation.

The typical error classes are the following:

1. The orphan relation is used instead of conj
(Figure 10);

2. Relations are correct, structure is wrong (Fig-
ures 11, 12 and 13);

3. The priority of promotion violates the
obliqueness hierarchy (Figures 11 and 13);

4. There are two (or more) orphans instead of
one, and both are attached to their common
ancestor (Figure 14).

Moreover, the promoted dependent takes the position of the missing verb, hence it should be connected
via conj to asasináron, not to Roberto.

triacă) should be promoted and the oblique agent (Paula) attached as orphan. Moreover, nmod:agent
should be obl:agent in UD v2, and punct + cc should be attached to the right.

5. The structure is correct but relations are
wrong. In particular, some of the treebanks
that completely lack orphans fall into this cat-
egory (Figure 15).

Although we can show examples only from a
few treebanks, similar errors can be found in other
treebanks, too.

4.2 Search for Missing Orphans

While it is difficult to automatically check whether
existing orphan relations are correct, it is even
more difficult to identify sentences where an
orphan is missing. To prove our hypothesis that
the studied type of ellipsis occurs also in treebanks
not mentioned in Table 1, we search for the most

Figure 15: German: “The Highway 176 runs through Flößberg and the railroad [runs] through Hopf-

subject of the missing copy of the verb führt. The orphan relation should be used instead.

typical pattern: a noun is attached to a verb via the
conj relation, and the noun has another noun as
dependent. The latter noun must be attached via
a relation that is not typically used to connect two
nouns (i.e. we specifically exclude nmod, appos
and some other relations). We also try to exclude
arguments of non-verbal predicates by checking
whether there is a copula; but obviously this does
not work well in languages like Russian, where
the copula may be omitted. Also note that such
a search pattern does not guarantee that we get all
instances of gapping. It assumes that the annota-
tion follows the tree structure required by UD v2,
except it does not know the orphan label. Obvi-
ously there is a range of other approaches that the
treebanks could take. Still, there are 19 treebanks
with 10 or more instances. Some of them may be
false positives but manual verification of Spanish
and German has revealed that there are indeed true
positives, too (Figure 15 presents an example). To
give at least a limited picture of the precision of
the heuristic (we cannot assess recall), we exam-
ined all 30 instances in UD Spanish. Only 5 of
them (17%) were true orphans in the UD v2 sense.
However, all the remaining cases deserve attention
as well because they were only found due to an-

notation errors (such as a verb tagged NOUN). (In
addition, two of these errors occur next to orphans
that were not detected by the heuristic.)

5 Conclusion

We have presented the elliptic constructions within
the UD 2.0 treebanks. We showed some typical
patterns occurring in the data as well as rarely oc-
curring constructions.

The differences in ratio of orphans to treebank
size (Table 1) can be explained both by unanno-
tated orphans in some treebanks and by annotation
errors (“orphan” instead of “conj”) in others.

It turned out that the number of annotation errors
is rather high which surely reflects the complexity
of this linguistic phenomenon.

The current state of the UD annotation w.r.t.
ellipsis is insufficient and supports neither parser
learning nor (cross-)linguistic studies. While hu-
man revisiting of the data is desirable, it is obvi-
ously not possible for all the treebanks, and auto-
matic tests/corrections would be highly desirable.
We have shown that such tests can at least par-
tially help, and we collected a number of exam-
ples, which will hopefully help to improve future
heuristics for identifying ellipsis in UD.
