Abstract 

Cognitive properties of words are very useful 
in figurative language understanding, lan-
guage acquisition and translation. To over-
come the subjectivity and low efficiency in 
manual construction of such database, we 
propose a web-based method for automatic 
collection and analysis of cognitive properties. 
The method employs simile templates to que-
ry the search engines. With the help of a bi-
lingual dictionary, the method is able to 
collect tens of thousands of “vehicle-
adjective” items of high quality. Frequencies 
are then used to obtain the common and inde-
pendent cognitive properties automatically. 
The method can be extended conveniently to 
other languages to construct multi-lingual 
cognitive property knowledgebase. 

1 Introduction 

Cognitive Linguistics focuses on the cognitive and 
metaphorical usage in language. For example, In 
English the “pig” is fat, dirty and lazy, etc. But it is 
not the case in other languages. As in Chinese, 猪
(pinyin: zhu, means pig) is fat, lazy and happy, but 
not dirty. Different cultural backgrounds lead to 
differences in everyday cognitive knowledge 
(Lakoff 1980). Therefore it is beneficial for litera-
ture translation, cross language retrieval and lan-
guage acquisition to compare the cognitive 
properties of words across languages. Traditionally, 
this kind of knowledge is generally possessed by 
experienced translators. In this article, we propose 
a method to collect the knowledge from the web 
automatically. It also makes a comparison between 

the obtained results with a traditional bilingual dic-
tionary. 

2 Related Work 

To collect the cognitive properties by hand is con-
sidered as both labour intensive and subjective. 
Therefore the researchers have sorted to corpus 
and search engine for help. Kintsch(2000) collects 
the noun-adjective pairs like “pig-fat” using the 
Latent Semantic Analysis(LSA) method on a large 
corpora. Roncero(2006) considers the simile sen-
tences which contain the specific metaphor proper-
ty like “as adjective as noun”. Veale(2007) collects 
a large scale of English similes by querying the 
nouns and adjectives in WordNet from Google to 
construct the English lexical metaphor knowledge-
base “sardonicus”, which contains about 10,000 
items of “noun vehicle-adjective property”. In a 
similar way, Jia(2009) collects Chinese similes 
from Chinese search engine Baidu. A total number 
of about 20,000 “noun vehicle-adjective property” 
items were acquired. 

Querying search engines is an efficient way to 
collect “noun-adjective” items. However, all the 
previous works are monolingual and do not use the 
frequencies of the items. Therefore, we want to 
extend the research to multi-languages and use fre-
quency for the comparison of cognitive properties. 

3 Construction of the Bilingual Cognitive 
Property Knowledgebase 

Just like Veale(2007) and Jia(2009), we use specif-
ic simile templates to collect English and Chinese 
“noun vehicle-adjective property” items by query-
ing the search engines and then construct the Chi-

31



nese-English bilingual lexical cognitive property 
knowledgebase.  

The words in WordNet and HowNet are used for 
querying the search engines. For English, the ad-
jectives in WordNet are used. For Chinese, the 
words are taken from HowNet.   

3.1 Lexical Resources 

WordNet 3.0 is a widely used lexical resource, 
which contains 21,479 adjectives and 117,798 
nouns(Miller 1990). It supplies plenty words for 
collecting English similes. 

HowNet is a structured Chinese-English lexical 
semantic resource(Dong 2006). Different from 
WordNet, it defines the meaning of a word by a set 
of structured semantic features, named “sememes”. 
About 2200 sememes are used to define 95000 
Chinese words and 85000 English words In 
HowNet(ver. 2007). For example, the noun 猪(pig) 
and 笨(stupid) are defined as follows. 
猪-pig, noun：{livestock|牲畜} 
笨-stupid, adjective：{foolish|愚} 

3.2 English Item Collection 

We used the 21,479 adjectives in WordNet to fill 
in the simile template “as ADJ as”. When querying 
Google, 3 limitations are set in advanced search to 
refine the search results: exact phrase, English lan-
guage and up to 100 results for each query. We do 
not use the nouns in WordNet, but the template 
will supply thousands of nouns where querying 
Google. Thus, a number of 585,300 types 
(1,054,982 tokens) of “as…as…” items are gath-
ered from Google. To trim the great number of 
nonsense, noisy and erroneous items, Veale(2007) 
manually checks the returned results. It is accurate 
but takes too much time. We introduce a simple 
trick for the purpose, which uses the dictionary for 
filtering. Nouns and adjectives in HowNet are tak-
en to filter the “noun-adjective” items. Then, 
27,331 types (87,529 tokens) of “noun-adjective” 
items are left, covering 6,319 nouns and 4,100 ad-
jectives. Table 1 gives the top 10 most frequent 
items with their frequencies. 

The item “blood-red” is the most frequent one in 
English. The frequency can tell the salience of the 
cognitive properties of nouns. Nevertheless, the 
frequencies we got are not exactly the frequency of 

the items on the web. They only show the statisti-
cal situation in the collected items.

7 sea boundless 314 
8 feather light 289 
9 night black 280 
10 hell mad 254 

 
The frequency of “blood-red” is over 100, be-

cause it also occurs in returned results of other 
words. Ideally, it is better to use the simile tem-
plate “as ADJ as NOUN” for the parings of 21,479 
adjectives multiple 117,798 nouns.  But the limita-
tion of the frequency to query search engines 
makes it impossible to finish the collecting work 
within a short time. 

3.3 Chinese Item Collection 

For Chinese, there are more simile templates. 
Three templates “像 (as)+NOUN+一样 (same)”, 
“ 像 (as)+VERB+ 一 样 (same)”, “ 像 (as)+ 一 样
(same)+ADJ” are adopted and are filled with the 
51020 nouns, 27901 verbs and 12252 adjectives 
from HowNet to query Baidu(www.baidu.com). 
Verbs are also considered, because some of them 
may function grammatically as nouns in English. 
For example, “呼吸(breath)” is a verb in Chinese, 
but it may serve as a noun phrase in certain con-
texts, and one of its cognitive properties extracted 
from Baidu is “自然 (natural)”. It tells people’s 
experience in breathing. We submit 91173 queries 
to Baidu, with configurations set to 100 returned 
results for each query. Totally, 1,258,430 types 
(5,637,500 tokens) of “vehicle-adjective” items are 
gathered. Then, nouns and adjectives in HowNet 
are used to filter these items, leaving only 24,240 
items. The web database of the Chinese filtered 
items is already available for search at 
http://nlp.nju.edu.cn/lib/cog/ccb_
nju.php. Table 2 shows the top 10 most frequent 
items with their frequencies.

It is surprising to see that “apple” has taken the 

first place on the web media in China. And “snow-
white” occurs in the top10 place in both languages. 
In next section, we will compare the cognitive 
properties based on the collection works done on 
Google and Baidu. 

4 Bilingual Comparison  

Previous sections have already done some compar-
ison by showing the most frequent items in English 
and Chinese. In this section, we continue to find 
the common parts and differences in cognitive 
properties. 

4.1 Common vehicles and properties 

We can compare the common vehicles and proper-
ties in English and Chinese. By consulting HowNet, 
3,106 types of bilingual “vehicle-property” items 
are gathered, including 1,500 English items and 
2,254 Chinese items. They cover only about 10% 
of all items in each language.  

Table 3 shows the top 10 most frequent bilingual 
items. We can see that people in different cultures share 
many same properties of things, such as “snow-white”, 
“blood-red”. However, the “fox-sly” is somewhat 
strange and interesting, for the animal is not as smart as 
man or monkey, but is considered sly. About 90% of 
the “vehicle-adjective” items do not have their cor-
responding items in the other language. But it does 
not necessarily mean that the two languages share 
few common parts. Too many words miss their 
translations only due to the size of the bilingual 
dictionary HowNet. For example, “snazzy” and 
“popular” are not translated to “时尚” or “时髦” in 
HowNet. Thus, “apple” does not appear in the bi-
lingual common items. So a larger bilingual dic-

tionary is necessary in further researches. However, 
no matter how large the dictionary is, it may still 
encounter the difficulty to find all the translation 
word pairs.

4.2 Dependent vehicles and properties 

As can be seen below, the “vehicle-property” items 
depend on culture backgrounds.

Most of the items are dependent on their lan-

guage and culture. Table 4 shows the top10 most 
frequent independent items in English and Chinese, 
But when a bilingual dictionary is used, some 

33



items are wrong like“苹果-时尚”and “天使-美丽”, 
as HowNet does not give good translations. With 
the bilingual cognitive properties, we can see the 
cognitive property differences among languages in 
a quick and convenient fashion. It will supply use-
ful information for a literature translator or a se-
cond language learner. Here is a detailed example 
of the common and dependent properties of trans-
lation word pairs “山” and “mountain”. The two 
concepts share 8 common properties and differ in 
more properties as shown in table 5.

In English, the most important property of 
mountain is “immovable” while it is “high” in 
Chinese. 1 The contrast is very useful in cross lan-
guage teaching and communications. The automat-
ic comparison is not very precise yet, we need to 
enlarge the scale of the cognitive property 
knowledgebase. 

5 Conclusion and Future Work  

Cognitive properties of words are very meaningful 
and useful but are not given in the traditional dic-
tionaries. To overcome the difficulty in manual 
                                                           
1 The item “mountain-high” does not exist in our collection 
but appears in Google. Because it is hard to get the item only 
using the template “as adjective as”.  

collecting, tagging and comparing of the cognitive 
properties in different languages, we employ 
search engines and bilingual dictionaries to con-
struct an English-Chinese cognitive property 
knowledgebank. With the frequencies of the “vehi-
cle-adjective” items, it is fast and convenient to see 
the language common and dependent properties of 
the word-pairs, which have translation relations. 
Using HowNet, we’ve already seen that most of 
the “vehicle-adjective” items are language depend-
ent. Thus, the knowledgebank is very helpful to 
literature translators, language learners and ma-
chine translations. 

In the future, we are to find better ways to col-
lect more “vehicle-adjective” items from search 
engines and to use larger bilingual dictionaries to 
refine the common parts of English and Chinese 
cognitive properties. With more multi-lingual dic-
tionaries, we are also able to deal with more lan-
guages under different cultures.
