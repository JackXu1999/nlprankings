Abstract

Named entity recognition (NER) is widely
used in natural language processing applica-
tions and downstream tasks. However, most
NER tools target flat annotation from popu-
lar datasets, eschewing the semantic informa-
tion available in nested entity mentions. We
describe NNE—a fine-grained, nested named
entity dataset over the full Wall Street Journal
portion of the Penn Treebank (PTB). Our an-
notation comprises 279,795 mentions of 114
entity types with up to 6 layers of nesting. We
hope the public release of this large dataset for
English newswire will encourage development
of new techniques for nested NER.

1 Introduction

Named entity recognition—the task of identifying
and classifying entity mentions in text—plays a
crucial role in understanding natural language. It
is used for many downstream language process-
ing tasks, e.g., coreference resolution, question
answering, summarization, entity linking, relation
extraction and knowledge base population. How-
ever, most NER tools are designed to capture flat
mention structure over coarse entity type schemas,
reflecting the available annotated datasets.

Focusing on flat mention structures ignores im-
portant information that can be useful for down-
stream tasks. Figure 1 includes examples of nested
named entities illustrating several phenomena:

• Entity-entity relationships can be embedded
in nested mentions. For instance, the location
of the ‘Ontario Supreme Court’ is indicated
by the embedded STATE mention ‘Ontario’;

• Entity attribute values can be embedded in
nested mentions. For instance, the title is the
embedded ROLE ‘Former U.N. Ambassador’,
which also encodes the employment relation

... the Ontario Supreme Court said it will postpone ...

between the PERSON ‘Jane Kirkpatrick‘ and
ORG ‘U.N.’;

• Part-whole relationships can be encoded in
nested mention structure. For instance, the
REGION ‘Southern California’ is part of the
STATE ‘California’.

Recent work has demonstrated increasing in-
terest in nested entity structure, including lo-
cal approaches (Xu et al., 2017; Sohrab and
Miwa, 2018), hypergraph-based approaches (Lu
and Roth, 2015; Muis and Lu, 2017; Katiyar and
Cardie, 2018; Wang and Lu, 2018), cascaded ap-
proaches (Alex et al., 2007; Ju et al., 2018), and
parsing approaches (Finkel and Manning, 2009;
Wang et al., 2018). See Dai (2018) for a survey.
Yet these techniques have seen little translation
from the research literature to toolsets or down-
stream applications.

To facilitate ongoing research on nested
NER, we introduce NNE—a large, manually-
annotated, nested named entity dataset over En-
glish newswire. This new annotation layer over
the Wall Street Journal portion of the PTB includes
279,795 mentions. All mentions are annotated,
including nested structures with depth as high as



5177

six layers. A fine-grained entity type schema is
used, extending the flat BBN (Weischedel and
Brunstein, 2005) annotation from 64 to 114 entity
types.

We are publicly releasing the standoff anno-
tations along with detailed annotation guidelines
and scripts for knitting annotations onto the under-
lying PTB corpus.1 Benchmark results using re-
cent state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate that
good accuracy is possible, but complexity and run
time are open challenges. As a new layer over the
already rich collection of PTB annotations, NNE
provides an opportunity to explore joint modelling
of nested NER and other tasks at an unprecedented
scale and detail.

2 The NNE dataset

Annotation Scheme: BBN (Weischedel and
Brunstein, 2005) is a pronoun coreference and en-
tity type corpus, annotated with 64 types of enti-
ties, numerical and time expressions. We use its
flat entity schema as a starting point to design our
schema. We analyzed existing BBN annotations
to develop and automatically apply structured pre-
annotation for predictable entity types. Additional
fine-grained categories and further structural ele-
ments of entities, inspired by Sekine et al. (2002)
and Nothman et al. (2013), are used to augment the
BBN schema. We adhere to the following general
principles when annotating nested named entities
in the corpus:

• Annotate all named entities, all time and date
(TIMEX) and numerical (NUMEX) entities, in-
cluding all non-sentence initial words in title
case, and instances of proper noun mentions
that are not capitalized.

• Annotate all structural elements of entities.
These elements could be other entities, such
as ‘Ontario’ (STATE) in ‘Ontario Supreme
Court’ (GOVERNMENT), or structural com-
ponents such as ‘40’ (CARDINAL) and ‘miles’
(UNIT) in ‘40 miles’ (QUANTITY:1D), as well
as the internal structure induced by syntactic
elements, such as coordination.

• Add consistent substructure to avoid spurious
ambiguity. For example, the token ‘Toronto’,
which is a CITY, would be labeled as part

1https://github.com/nickyringland/nested named entities

of an ORG:EDU organization span ‘Univer-
sity of Toronto’. We add layers of annota-
tions to allow each token to be annotated as
consistently as possible, e.g., [University of
[Toronto]CITY]ORG:EDU.

• Add additional categories to avoid category
confusion. Some entities are easy to identify,
but difficult to categorize consistently. For in-
stance, a hotel (or any business at a fixed lo-
cation) has both organizational and locative
qualities, or is at least treated metonymously
as a location. Rather than requiring annota-
tors to make an ambiguous decision, we elect
to add category HOTEL to simplify the indi-
vidual annotation decision. We also apply
this principle when adding MEDIA, FUND,
and BUILDING categories.

• Pragmatic annotation. Many annotation de-
cisions are ambiguous and difficult, thus may
require substantial research. For instance,
knowing that ‘The Boeing Company’ was
named after founder ‘William E. Boeing’
would allow us to annotate ‘Boeing’ with
an embedded PERSON entity. However, this
does not apply for other companies, such as
‘Sony Corporation’. To let annotation deci-
sions be made without reference to external
knowledge, we label all tokens that seem to
be the names of people as NAME, regardless
of whether they are actually a person’s name.

Entity types and mention frequencies can be
found in Appendix A. See Ringland (2016) for an-
notation guidelines and extended discussion of an-
notation decisions.

Annotation Process: Although some existing
annotation tools allow nested structures (e.g.,
Brat (Stenetorp et al., 2012)), we built a custom
tool that allowed us to create a simple and fast way
to add layers of entities, and suggest reusing exist-
ing structured annotations for the same span.

Using the annotations from BBN as underly-
ing annotations, the annotator is shown a screen
with the target sentence, as well as the previous
and next sentences, if any. A view of the whole
article is also possible to help the annotator with
contextual cues. When annotators select a span,
they are prompted with suggestions based on their
own previous annotations, and common entities.
Some entities are repeated frequently in an article,

or over many articles in the corpus. The annotation
tool allows a user to add a specified annotation to
all strings matching those tokens in the same arti-
cle, or in all articles.

Four annotators, each with a background in lin-
guistics and/or computational linguistics were se-
lected and briefed on the annotation task and pur-
pose. The WSJ portion of the PTB consists of
25 sections (00–24). Each annotator started with
a subset of section 00 as annotation training, and
was given feedback before moving on to other sec-
tions. Weekly meetings were held with all annota-
tors to discuss ambiguities in the guidelines, gaps
in the annotation categories, edge cases and am-
biguous entities and to resolve discrepancies.

Total annotation time for the corpus was 270
hours, split between the four annotators. Sections
00 and 23 were doubly annotated, and section 02
was annotated by all four annotators. An addi-
tional 17 hours was used for adjudicating these
sections annotated by multiple annotators.

Dataset Analysis: The resulting NNE dataset
includes a large number of entity mentions of sub-
stantial depth, with more than half of mentions oc-
curring inside another mentions. Of the 118,525
top-level entity mentions, 47,020 (39.6%) do not
have any nested structure embedded. The re-
maining 71,505 mentions contain 161,270 men-
tions, averaging 2.25 structural mentions per each
of these top-layer entity mentions. Note that one
span can be assigned multiple entity types. For
example, the span ‘1993’ can be annotated as both
DATE and YEAR. In NNE, 19,144 out of 260,386
total spans are assigned multiple types. Table 1
lists the number of spans occurring at each depth.
To measure how clearly the annotation guidelines
delineate each category, and how reliable our an-
notations are, inter-annotator agreement was cal-
culated using annotations on Section 02, which
was annotated by all four annotators. An adju-
dicated version was created by deciding a correct
existing candidate label from within the four pos-

sibilities, or by adjusting one of them on a token
level. For the purposes of inter-annotator agree-
ment, a tag stack is calculated for each word, es-
sentially flattening each token’s nested annotation
structure into one label. For example, the tag of to-
ken ‘California’ in the third sentence of Figure 1 is
STATE REGION, while ‘beach’ is O O. Agreement
using Fleiss’ kappa over all tokens is 0.907. Con-
sidering only tokens that are part of at least one
mention according to at least one annotator, Fleiss’
kappa is 0.832. Both results are above the 0.8
threshold for good reliability (Carletta, 1996). Av-
erage precision, recall and F1 score across four an-
notators with respect to the adjudicated gold stan-
dard are 94.3, 91.8 and 93.0.

3 Benchmark results

We evaluate three existing NER models on our
dataset: (1) the standard BiLSTM-CRF model
which can handle only flat entities (Lample et al.,
2016); (2) hypergraph-based (Wang and Lu,
2018); and, (3) transition-based (Wang et al.,
2018) models. The latter two models were pro-
posed to recognize nested mentions. We follow
CoNLL evaluation schema in requiring an exact
match of mention start, end and entity type (Sang
and Meulder, 2003). We use sections 02 as devel-
opment set, sections 23 and 24 as test set, and the
remaining sections as training set. The model that
performs best on the development set is evaluated
on the test set for the final result. Since the stan-
dard BiLSTM-CRF model cannot handle nested
entities, we use either the outermost (BiLSTM-
CRF-TOP in Table 2) or the innermost mentions
(BiLSTM-CRF-BOTTOM) for training. We also
combine the outputs from these two flat NER
models, and denote the result as BiLSTM-CRF-
BOTH.

From Table 2, we can see that single flat NER
models can achieve high precision but suffer from
low recall. For example, the model pretrained
on outermost (top) mentions has 38.0 recall, as

around 60% of mentions are nested within oth-
ers. The hypergraph-based model performs best
on our dataset, presumably because it can capture
mentions from different levels and does not suffer
from issues of structural ambiguity during infer-
ence (Muis and Lu, 2017; Wang and Lu, 2018).
However, its decoding speed of 9 words per sec-
ond is slow due to the large number of entity
categories of our dataset.2 The transition-based
method has a higher decode speed of 57 words
per second, but has much lower precision than flat
NER models.

4 Related Work

Other corpora with nested entities: We briefly
compare existing annotated English corpora in-
volving nested entities. A comparison of statistics
between our dataset and two widely used bench-
mark datasets is shown in Table 3. The ACE cor-
pora (Mitchell et al., 2004; Walker et al., 2005)
consist of data of various types annotated for enti-
ties, relations and events. The entity component of
ACE is framed in terms of nominal modification,
and nested mentions are only annotated in nominal
mentions, not inside other named entity mentions.
For example, in ACE2005, ‘Secretary of Home-
land Security Tom Ridge’ is annotated as a PER-
SON, containing two other PERSON annotations:
‘Secretary’ and ‘Secretary of Homeland Security’.
In contrast, our annotations capture more interac-
tions between different semantic spans: PERSON
consisting of ROLE and NAME, and ROLE contain-
ing GOVERNMENT.

The GENIA corpus (Kim et al., 2003) is a
richly-annotated corpus for bio-text mining that
has 36 entity types among 2,000 MEDLINE ab-
stracts. Due to the biomedical domain’s special-
ized terminology and complex naming conven-
tions, entities of interest, such as genes, proteins or

2The decoding time complexity of the method proposed
by Wang and Lu (2018) is O(cmn), where m is the number
of entity types, n is the sentence length, and c is the maximal
mention length.

disease names, often nest. For example, the RNA
‘CIITA mRNA’ contains a DNA mention ‘CIITA’.

In addition to these two commonly used nested
entity corpora, Byrne (2007) and Alex et al. (2007)
introduced datasets with nested entities in histori-
cal archive and biomedical domains, respectively.
However, their datasets are not publicly available.
Four percent of entity mentions annotated in the
English entity discovery and linking task in TAC-
KBP track include nesting (Ji et al., 2014).

Resources built on the PTB: A lots of ef-
fort has been made on adding syntactic and se-
mantic information to the PTB (Marcus et al.,
1993). PropBank (Kingsbury et al., 2002) ex-
tended the PTB with the predicate argument re-
lationships between verbs and their arguments.
NomBank (Meyers et al., 2004) extended the ar-
gument structure for instances of common nouns.
Vadas and Curran (2007), and Ficler and Goldberg
(2016) extended the PTB with noun phrase and co-
ordination annotations, respectively.

Our dataset is built on top of the PTB and en-
riches the full ecosystem of resources and systems
that stem from it.

5 Summary

We present NNE, a large-scale, nested, fine-
grained named entity dataset. We are optimistic
that NNE will encourage the development of new
NER models that recognize structural informa-
tion within entities, and therefore understand fine-
grained semantic information captured. Addition-
ally, our annotations are built on top of the PTB,
so that the NNE dataset will allow joint learning
models to take advantage of semantic and syntac-
tic annotations, and ultimately to understand and
exploit the true structure of named entities.
