Modeling Non-Propositional Semantics

By non-propositional semantics, we mean things other than semantic roles that are expressed in a single sentence
and tend to be grammaticalized. These include tense, aspect, modality, existence, possession, causality,
conditionality, comparison, quantification, and definiteness. Non-propositional semantic categories evade
definition because they are prototypes, not discrete categories. The centroids match across languages, but the
extensions of the prototypes do not match. Furthermore, the grammaticalization of non-propositional semantics
varies widely, including lexical items, affixes, and syntactic constructions, making cross-linguistic models
difficult. In this talk we will focus on definiteness. Definiteness differs widely in grammaticalization across
languages. We will present an annotation scheme that captures the semantic points that are relevant for
definiteness across languages and logistic regression model of definiteness for English.
