Abstract

In this work, we deploy a logistic regression
classifier to ascertain whether a given doc-
ument belongs to the fiction or non-fiction
genre. For genre identification, previous work
had proposed three classes of features, viz.,
low-level (character-level and token counts),
high-level (lexical and syntactic information)
and derived features (type-token ratio, aver-
age word length or average sentence length).
Using the Recursive feature elimination with
cross-validation (RFECV) algorithm, we per-
form feature selection experiments on an ex-
haustive set of nineteen features (belonging
to all the classes mentioned above) extracted
from Brown corpus text. As a result, two sim-
ple features viz., the ratio of the number of ad-
verbs to adjectives and the number of adjec-
tives to pronouns turn out to be the most sig-
nificant. Subsequently, our classification ex-
periments aimed towards genre identification
of documents from the Brown and Baby BNC
corpora demonstrate that the performance of
a classifier containing just the two aforemen-
tioned features is at par with that of a classifier
containing the exhaustive feature set.

1 Introduction

Texts written in any human language can be classi-
fied in various ways, one of them being fiction and
non-fiction genres. These categories/genres can
either refer to the actual content of the write-up or
the writing style used, and in this paper, we use the
latter meaning. We associate fiction writings with
literary perspectives, i.e., an imaginative form of
writing which has its own purpose of communi-
cation, whereas non-fiction writings are written in
a matter-of-fact manner, but the contents may or
may not refer to real life incidents (Lee, 2001).
The distinction between imaginative and informa-
tive prose is very important and can have several
practical applications. For example, one could use

a software to identify news articles, which are ex-
pected to be written in a matter-of-fact manner, but
tend to use an imaginative writing style to unfairly
influence the reader. Another application for such
a software could be for publishing houses which
can use it to automatically filter out article/novel
submissions that do not meet certain expected as-
pects of fiction writing style.

The standard approach in solving such text clas-
sification problems is to identify a large enough
set of relevant features and feed it into a ma-
chine learning algorithm. In the genre identi-
fication literature, three types of linguistic fea-
tures have been discussed i.e., high-level, low-
level and derived features (Karlgren and Cutting,
1994; Kessler et al., 1997; Douglas, 1992; Biber,
1995). High-level features include lexical and syn-
tactic information whereas low-level features in-
volve character-level and various types of token
count information. The lexical features deal with
word frequency statistics such as frequency of
content words, function words or specific counts
of each pronoun, etc. Similarly, the syntactic fea-
tures incorporate statistics of parts of speech, i.e.,
noun, verb, adjectives, adverbs and grammatical
functions such as active and passives voices or
affective markers such as modal auxiliary verbs.
The character-level features involve punctuation
usage, word count, word length, sentence length.
And, lastly, the derived features involve ratio met-
rics such as type-token ratio, average word length
or average sentence length based information. Ma-
jorly, all the previous work involved a combination
of different features to represent a particular nature
of the document and developing a model that clas-
sify different genres, sentiments or opinions.

Notably, researchers have adopted the frequen-
tist approach (Sichel, 1975; Zipf, 1932, 1945) and
used lexical richness (Tweedie and Baayen, 1998)
as a prominent cue for genre classification (Bur-



82

rows, 1992; Stamatatos et al., 2000, 1999). These
studies vouch that coming out with statistical dis-
tribution from word frequencies would be the de-
facto-arbiter for document classification. In this
regard, Stamatatos and colleagues have shown that
most frequent words in the training corpus as well
as in the entire English language are one of the
good features for detecting the genre type (Sta-
matatos et al., 2000). With respect to syntac-
tic and semantics properties of the text, previous
studies have used various parts of speech counts
in terms of number of types and tokens (Rittman
et al., 2004; Rittman, 2007; Rittman and Wa-
cholder, 2008; Cao and Fang, 2009). Researchers
have tried to investigate the efficacy of counts vs.
ratio features and their impact on the classification
model performance. In general, a large number of
features often tend to overfit the machine learn-
ing model performance. Hence, concerning the
derived ratio features, Kessler et al. (1997) argues
in his genre identification study that ratio features
tend to eliminate over-fitting as well as high com-
putational cost during training.

Although these earlier approaches have made
very good progress in text classification, and are
very powerful from an algorithmic perspective,
they do not provide many insights into the linguis-
tic and cognitive aspects of these fiction and non-
fiction genres. The main objective of our work is
to be able to extract the features that are most rel-
evant to this particular classification problem and
can help us in understanding the underlying lin-
guistic properties of these genres. We begin by ex-
tracting nineteen linguistically motivated features
belonging to various types (described at the out-
set) from the Brown corpus and then perform fea-
ture selection experiments using Recursive feature
elimination with cross-validation (RFECV) algo-
rithm (Guyon et al., 2002). Interestingly, we find
that a classifier containing just two simple ratio
features viz., the ratio of the number of adverbs to
adjectives and number of adjectives to pronouns
perform as well as a classifier containing an ex-
haustive set of features from prior work described
above [96.31% and 100% classification accuracy
for Brown (Francis and Kučera, 1989) and British
National corpus (BNC Baby, 2005), respectively].
This is perhaps the best accuracy reported in the
literature so far to the best of our knowledge. Es-
sentially, we find that texts from the fiction genre
tend to have a higher ratio of adverb to adjectives,

and texts from the non-fiction genre tend to have a
higher ratio of adjectives to pronouns. We discuss
the implications of this finding for style guides for
non-fiction writing (Zinsser, 2006) as well as stan-
dard advice proffered to creative writers (King,
2001).

In Section 2, we share details about our lin-
guistic features design, data set and experimental
methodology. Section 3 presents the experiments
conducted as a part of our study and discusses their
critical findings. Finally, Section 4 summarizes
the conclusions of the study and discusses the im-
plications of our findings.

2 Data and Methods

For our experiments, we use the Brown Cor-
pus (Francis and Kučera, 1989), one of the earliest
collections of annotated texts of present-day
American English and available free of cost
with the NLTK toolkit (Loper and Bird, 2002).
The nature of the distribution of texts in the
Brown corpus helps us to conduct our studies
conveniently. The Brown corpus consists of 500
text samples with different genres distributed
among 15 categories/genres, which are further
divided into two major classes, namely, Infor-
mative prose and Imaginative prose. As per our
proposed definition in this study, we associate
informative prose with the non-fictional genre
and imaginative prose as a fictional one. We
conduct a binary classification task to separate
text samples into these two genres (i.e., fiction and
non-fiction) with our proposed linguistic features.
Out of the 15 genres, we excluded the 5 genres
of humour, editorial, lore, religion and letters
from our dataset as it is difficult to accurately
associate them with either fiction and non-fiction
genres. Finally, the fictional category consists of 5
subcategories, namely: fiction, mystery, romance,
adventure, and science fiction. Similarly, the
non-fiction category includes 5 subcategories
namely: news, hobbies, government, reviews, and

learned. This leads us to use 324 samples out of
500 articles in the Brown corpus; out of which
207 samples fall under fiction category and 117
under non-fiction. Despite having less number
of samples, the total word count of all texts in
the non-fiction category/genre (479,708 words) is
higher than that of fiction (284,429 words), and
the total number of sentences in the non-fiction
category/genre (21,333) is also higher than that
of fiction (18,151). Hence, we chose to divide
the data by sub-categories rather than having a
number of samples or number of words as the
base for distribution. Table 1 provides more
details regarding the documents in these genres.

To further our understanding of the model’s
classification performance for Brown corpus and
investigate its applicability to British English,
we use the British National Corpus (BNC Baby,
2005). This approach helps us to examine model
prediction more robustly. Baby BNC consists of
four categories, namely, fiction, newspaper, spo-
ken and academic. Due to the clear demarcation
between these categories, we use only fiction doc-
uments (25 samples) labeled as fiction and aca-
demic documents (30 samples) as non-fiction for
our experiments. Finally, we apply our algorithm
on the articles in the news category (97 samples) to
check whether they fall under fiction or non-fiction
genre.

Keeping in mind the binary nature of our clas-
sification task, we use logistic regression (LR) as
our numerical method (McCullagh and Nelder,
1989). Among many classification algorithms, the
result of LR is among the most informative ones.
By informative, we mean that it not only gives a
measure of the relevance of a feature (coefficient
value) but also the nature of its association with
the outcome (negative or positive). It models the
binary dependent variable using a linear combina-
tion of one or more predictor values (features) with
the help of following equations where φ is the es-
timated response probability:

g(φ) = log(φ/(1− φ)) (1)

φ = P (x) =
1

1 + e−(xiβi+β0)
(2)

where, xi is the feature vector for text i, βi is the
estimated weight vector, and β0 is intercept of the
linear regression equation.

3 Experiments and Results

This section describes our experiments aimed to
classify texts into the fictional and non-fictional
genres using machine learning. The next subsec-
tion describes various linguistic features we de-
ploy in detail and the use of feature selection to
identify the most useful features. Subsequently,
Section 3.2 provides the results of our classifica-
tion experiments.

3.1 Linguistic Features and Feature Selection

We compute different low-level and high-level
features as discussed in Section 1 and after that
take their ratios as the relative representative met-
ric for the classification task. Table 2 depicts the
features used in this work. Some of the ratio fea-
tures such as average token/type (punctuation) ra-
tio, hyphen exclamation ratio, etc., have been ex-
plored in earlier work (Kessler et al., 1997). For
calculating high-level ratio features, we use tags
from two kind of POS tagsets, i.e, gold stan-
dard tags provided as part of the Brown Corpus
(87 tags) and automatic tags (based on the 36-tag
Penn Treebank tagset) predicted by Stanford tag-
ger1 (Toutanova et al., 2003). Grammatical cate-
gories like noun, verb, and adjective are inferred
from the POS tags using the schema given in Ta-

Table 3: Rules to ascertain grammatical categories
from POS tags

ble 3. We consider both personal pronouns and
wh-pronouns as part of the pronoun category.

We use the recursive feature elimination with
cross-validation (RFECV) method to eliminate
non-significant features. Recursive feature elim-
ination (Guyon et al., 2002) follows the greedy
search algorithm to select the best performing fea-
tures. It forms models iteratively with different
combinations of features and removes the worst
performing features at each step, thus giving the
set of best performing set of features. The mo-
tivation behind these experiments is not only to
get a good accuracy score but also to decipher
the importance of these features and to understand
their impact on writing. After applying RFECV
on the automatically tagged Brown Corpus, we
get all features as the optimum set of features.
We attribute this result to the POS-tagging errors
introduced by the Stanford tagger. So we apply
our feature selection method to features extracted
from the Brown Corpus with gold standard tags.
Here, 13 out of 19 features are marked as non-

significant, and we obtain six most significant fea-
tures (shown in bold in Table 2). Subsequently,
we extract these six features from the automati-
cally tagged Brown Corpus, and feature selection
on this set revealed only two of these features as
being the most significant (underlined in Table 2).
The two most notable features which emerge from
our second feature selection experiment are ad-
verb/adjective ratio and adjective/pronoun ratio.
The Noun/pronoun ratio feature gets eliminated in
the process. Figure 1 illustrates how both these ra-
tios provide distinct clusters of data points belong-
ing to the fiction and non-fiction genres (and even
their subgenres). Thus, the Brown corpus tagset
encoding finer distinctions in grammatical cate-
gories (compared to the Penn Treebank tagset),
does help in isolating a set of six significant ratio
features. These features are useful for identifying
the final two POS-ratios based on automatic tags.

3.2 Classification Experiments
As described in the previous section, we apply lo-
gistic regression to individual files of two data-sets
(Brown Corpus and Baby British National Corpus)
after extracting various low-level features and fea-
tures encoding ratios of POS tags based on auto-
matic tags emitted by the Stanford tagger (see Ta-
ble 2). We use a logistic regression classifier with
ten-fold cross-validation and L1 regularization for
training to carry out our analyses and report the
accuracy achieved over the total number of files
in our test sets. We use the Scikit-learn2 (Pe-
dregosa et al., 2011) library for our classification
experiments. The individual performance by non-
significant features has not been reported in our
study. We report results for three data sets after
tagging them using the Stanford POS-tagger:

1. Brown Corpus with a 60%-40% train-test
split (194 training files; 130 test files).

2. Brown Corpus with Baby BNC combined
with a 60%-40% train-test split (227 training
files; 152 test files).

3. Testing on Baby BNC with Training on
Brown Corpus (324 training files; 55 test
files).

We calculate testing accuracy for the first two
datasets for ten different combinations of training
and testing sets, and report the mean accuracy with

standard deviation for the same as well as for the
most frequent baseline accuracy. While for the
third dataset, only one training and testing set pos-
sible exists, and therefore, we report the testing
accuracy and the most frequent class baseline ac-
curacy accordingly. The most frequent class base-
line is the percentage accuracy obtained if a model
labels all the data points as the most frequent class
in the data (non-fiction in our study). Table 4 illus-
trates our results. Here, we also use another per-
formance metric known as accuracy gain which is
considered more rigorous and interpretable mea-
sure as compared to the standard measure of accu-
racy. The accuracy gain percentage is calculated
as:

Accuracy Gain % =
(acc− baseline)
(100− baseline)

×100

(3)
where ‘acc’ is the reported mean accuracy of
model, whereas ‘baseline’ is the mean of most
frequent class baseline.

We begin with the Brown Corpus and take 117
sample texts of non-fiction and 207 of fiction cat-
egories. Our training set consists of 60% of the
total sample size whereas testing set comprises of
remaining 40% of samples. We have four combi-
nations of the set of features (refer Row 1 of Table
4). It can be noted that two features model per-
formed better than the model corresponding to the
six features and low-level ratio features and is per-
forming as good as 19 features model. To make
the model more robust, we follow the same ap-
proach for the combination of Brown corpus and
Baby BNC with 147 sample texts of non-fiction
and 232 sample texts of fiction categories. Baby
BNC has been included to check the impact of
British English on the performance of the model.
One may observe that the model performed even

better when exposed to Baby BNC. Similar ob-
servations can be made about the accuracy of the
two features model (refer Row 2 of Table 4). In
our final experiment, we use the Brown corpus for
training and the Baby BNC for testing with the
available set of features. In this case, the features
obtained after feature selection on the exhaustive
set of features results in 100% classification accu-
racy (Row 3 of Table 4). This result also signifies
the universal applicability of the ratio features and
high-level POS ratios are not something which is
affected by bias due to the language variety (i.e.,
British vs. American English). However, the low
performance of the 19 features model (53% clas-
sification accuracy) shows how they are prone to
overfitting.

The two most significant features, ad-
verb/adjective ratio and adjective/pronoun
ratio have regression coefficients 2.73 and -2.90
respectively. Thus, fiction documents tend to have
higher values for the ratio of number adverbs to
adjectives and a lower value for the ratio of the
number of adjectives to pronouns. It is worth
noting that the high accuracy scores of more than
95% we obtained by using 19 features in the case
of the first two datasets are in the vicinity of the
accuracy score given by only these two features.
Also, the fact that the F1 scores are close to the
accuracy values signifies the fact that the results
obtained are robust in nature.

Finally, in order to check the dominant tenden-
cies in the behaviour of classifiers containing dif-
ferent feature sets, we examine the predictions of
various classifiers using a separate test set con-
sisting of 97 news documents in the Baby BNC
corpus. We also studied model predictions using
different training sets. Initially, we use the same
data sets mentioned in the last two rows of Ta-

ble 4. Apart from this, to check the bias of the
model, we create a new test set after removing the
news category from the non-fiction class of brown
corpus. Similarly, in the combined Brown+Baby
BNC corpus, we later include news samples from
Baby BNC to measure the improvement in the
model’s predictions. The results are shown in Ta-
ble 5. It can be observed that most of the samples
are classified as non-fiction, as expected. Also, re-
moving news articles from the Brown corpus non-
fiction category does not impact the results indi-
cating the unbiased behavior of the model. How-
ever, an important conclusion one can draw from
Table 5 results is that both the two features as well
as the six features model are pretty stable as com-
pared to their 19-feature counterpart. Even the in-
troduction of news samples from Baby BNC in the
training data does not seem to help the predictions
of 19 features model. This shows the vulnerability
of more complex models to a slight change in the
training data.

4 Discussion and Conclusion

In this paper, we have identified two important fea-
tures that can be very helpful in classifying fic-
tion and non-fiction genres with high accuracy.
Fiction articles, i.e., those which are written with
an imaginative flavor, tend to have a higher ad-
verb/adjective ratio of POS tags, whereas non-
fiction articles, i.e., those which are written in a
matter of fact manner, tend to have a higher adjec-
tive/pronoun ratio. This not only helps in classi-
fication using machine learning but also provides
useful linguistic insights. A glance at the per-
centages of each of these grammatical categories
computed over the total number of words in the
dataset (Figure 2) reveals several aspects of the
genres themselves. In both corpora, the trends are

Figure 2: Adjectives, adverbs and pronouns as a per-
centage of the total number of words

roughly the same. In fiction, both adjectives and
adverbs have a roughly similar proportion, while
non-fiction displays almost double the number of
adjectives compared to adverbs. Also, the percent-
age of pronouns vary sharply across the two gen-
res in both our datasets as compared to adjectives
and adverbs. Figure 3 presents a much more nu-
anced picture of personal pronouns in the Brown
corpus. Fiction displays the greater percentage
of third person masculine and feminine pronouns
as well as the first person singular pronoun com-
pared to non-fiction, while both genres have com-
parable percentages of first-person plural we and
us. Moreover, differences in modification strate-
gies using adverbs vs. wh-pronouns requires fur-
ther exploration. Even the usage of punctuation
marks differ across genres (Figure 4).

It is worth noting that many guides to writ-
ing both fiction (King, 2001) as well as non-
fiction (Zinsser, 2006) advise writers to avoid the
overuse of both adverbs and adjectives. In a sta-
tistical study of classic works of English litera-
ture, Blatt (2017) also points to adverb-usage pat-
terns in the works of renowned authors. Nobel
prize winning writer Toni Morrison’s oft-cited dis-
preference for adverbs is analyzed quantitatively
to show that on an average she used 76 adverbs
per 10,000 words (compared to 80 by Heming-
way; much higher numbers for the likes of Stein-
beck, Rushdie, Salinger, and Wharton). The cited
work discusses Morrison’s point about eliminating
prose like She says softly by virtue of the fact that
the preceding scene would be described such that

Figure 3: Brown corpus pronouns as a percentage of

the emotion in the speech is conveyed to the reader
without the explicit use of the adverb softly. In
fact, Sword (2016) advocates the strategy of using
expressive verbs encoding the meaning of adverbs
as well, as exemplified below (adverbs in bold and
paraphrase verbs italicized):

1. She walked painfully (dragged) toward the car.

2. She walked happily (sauntered) toward the car.

3. She walked drunkenly (stumbled) toward the car.

4. She walked absent-mindedly (meandered) toward the
car.

A long line of research undeniably argues that
adjective and adverbs are strong indicators of af-
fective language and serve as an important fea-
ture in text classification tasks viz., automatic
genre identification (Rittman et al., 2004; Rittman,
2007; Rittman and Wacholder, 2008; Cao and
Fang, 2009).In this regard, Rittman and Wa-
cholder (2008) propound that both these gram-
matical classes have sentimental connotations and
capture human personality along with their ex-
pression of judgments. For our classifer, rather
than the number of adjectives, it is the relative
balance of adjectives and adverbs that determine
the identity of a particular genre. A large-scale
study needs to validate whether this conclusion
can be generalized to the English language as a
whole. Thus, prescriptions for both technical as
well as creative writing should be based on sys-
tematic studies involving large-scale comparisons
of fictional texts with other non-fiction genres. In

the number of words

particular, the paranoia about elements of modifi-
cation like adjectives and adverbs seem unjustified
as many other mechanisms of nominal and verbal
modification like prepositional phrases and subor-
dinate clauses exist in language.3

Since our classification is based on the ratios
of these POS tags taken across the whole doc-
ument, it is difficult to identify a few sentences
which can demonstrate the role of our features
(adverb/adjective and adjective/pronoun ratio)
convincingly. Qualitatively, the importance of
adjectives can be comprehended with the help of
an excerpt taken from the sample file of Brown
corpus (fileid cp09; adjectives in bold):

“ Out of the church and into his big car, it
tooling over the road with him driving and the
headlights sweeping the pike ahead and after he
hit college, his expansiveness, the quaint little
pine board tourist courts, cabins really, with a
cute naked light bulb in the ceiling (unfrosted
and naked as a streetlight, like the one on the
corner where you used to play when you were
a kid, where you watched the bats swooping in
after the bugs, watching in between your bouts at
hopscotch), a room complete with moths pinging
the light and the few casual cockroaches cruising
the walls, an insect Highway Patrol with feelers
waving.”

After removing adjectives (identified using
Brown corpus tags), we get:

“ Out of the church and into his car, it tool-
ing over the road with him driving and the
headlights sweeping the pike ahead and after he
hit college, his expansiveness, the little pine board
tourist courts, cabins really, with a light bulb in
the ceiling (unfrosted and naked as a streetlight,
like the one on the corner where you used to play
when you were a kid, where you watched the bats
swooping in after the bugs, watching in between
your bouts at hopscotch), a room with moths
pinging the light and the few cockroaches cruising
the walls, an insect Highway Patrol with feelers
waving.”

Although the text with adjectives removed
still belongs to the fiction genre, we can clearly
see the role that these words can play in enhancing
the imaginative quotient of the text. However,
counter-intuitively, Figure 2 shows that texts in the
non-fiction genre tend to have a higher percentage
of adjectives as compared to texts in the fiction
genre, but the latter have a higher percentage
of adverbs. Hence, this example reiterates the
point that the role played by our salient features
(adverb/adjective and adjective/pronoun ratios)
in classifying fiction and non-fiction genres is
difficult to appreciate with only a few lines of text.
An interesting question could be to find out the
minimum length of a text required for accurate
classification into fiction and non-fiction genres
and also more significant features in this regard,
which we will take up in the future. We also
intend to carry out this study on a much larger
dataset in the future in order to verify the efficacy
of our features.
