ABSTRACT
In this paper, we present a new method that improves the alignment of equivalent terms
monolingually acquired from bilingual comparable corpora: the Compositional Method with
Context-Based Projection (CMCBP). Our overall objective is to identify and to translate high
specialized terminology made up of multi-word terms acquired from comparable corpora. Our
evaluation in the medical domain and for two pairs of languages demonstrates that CMCBP
outperforms the state-of-art compositional approach commonly used for translationally equiv-
alent multi-word term discovery from comparable corpora.

KEYWORDS: Comparable corpora, bilingual lexicon, compositionality, multi-word term, con-
text information.

1 Introduction

The automatic compilation of bilingual dictionaries has received considerable attention in re-
cent years for language for special purposes (LSP) (especially coming from scientific domains).
LSP is characterised by the small amount of available textual data compared with general lan-
guage, and a high proportion of specialised terms which are not be found in general language
monolingual or bilingual dictionaries. For LSP, a specialised term could be either a single-word
term (SWT) or a multi-word term (MWT), the latter being highly productive (Sag et al., 2002).
A term is a lexical unit which represents a concept within a domain. As an example, in the
medical domain, cancer is an SWT, breast cancer is an MWT.

Comparable corpora that are sets of texts in two or more languages without being translations
of each other, seem to be the right solution to solve the textual scarcity of LSP: as monolingual
productions, they are authentic texts, and the babel web ensures that there is a sufficient num-
ber of multilingual documents. The comparability of the corpus should be ensured by using
various shared characteristics across languages that are checked during the compilation phase
(McEnery, 2007). For LSP, the domain and sub-domain are requested as well as the commu-
nicative settings and the textual genre to identify reliable translations (Bowker and Pearson,
2002).

To build highly-specialised terminologies, the terms are first of all extracted monolingually
from the comparable corpus. To collect close candidate terms across languages, it is necessary
to use a term extraction program that applies the same method in the source and in the target
languages. The translation of MWTs is the main need as they constitute around 80% of the
domain-specific terms. See Nakagawa and Mori (2003) for the Japanese language.

1797



Our goal is to find the right translation for a source MWT in the set of MWT candidates in the
target language. The simplest method assumes that the right translation of an MWT could be
obtained by translating each component individually thanks to a general dictionary, by generat-
ing all the combinations of word positions, and then filtering the translated expressions using
either the list of target MWTs (Morin and Daille, 2010), the target corpus (Robitaille et al.,
2006) or the web (Grefenstette, 1999). This method is limited to the subset of MWTs that
share the same compositional property - 48.7% were reported by Baldwin and Tanaka (2004)
for English/Japanese N N compounds. However, even if the MWT is characterised by the
compositional property, the translation is not found when some words, which are part of the
MWTs, do not belong to the general bilingual dictionary or when the translated combinations
do not exist or have not been extracted by the term extraction program in the target language.

Within this context, we propose to improve the compositional approach by using context infor-
mation collected from LSP comparable corpora when one or several of the components, part of
the MWTs, are not found in the dictionary. We demonstrate that the use of context information
when performing terminology translation helped us to learn a significant number of additional
correct lexical entries that could not be identified by the compositional method.

The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: Section 2 shows the intricate problems
with the translations of MWTs. Section 3 presents the compositional method used for the au-
tomatic translation of MWTs. Section 4 introduces CMCBP that takes advantage of the context
information to improve the compositional method. Section 5 describes the linguistic resources
and the open-terminology extraction tool used for our experiments. Section 6 evaluates the
influence of CMCBP on the quality of bilingual terminology extraction through experiments
involving French as a source language, and English and German as target languages. Section 7
discusses works related to this study. Finally, Section 8 presents our conclusions.

2 Translation of MWTs

If MWTs are less polysemous (Savary and Jacquemin, 2003) and more representative
(Nomura and M., 1989; Nakagawa and Mori, 2003) of domain specialities than SWTs, pin-
pointing their translations poses specific problems that are well-known, such as fertility, non-
compositionality, or term variation1:

Fertility is known as a problem of difference of length between the source and the target MWT
(Brown et al., 1993): for instance, the German SWT axilladissektion (1 content word) is
translated into English by the MWT axillary dissection (two content words); the French
MWT dépistage du cancer du sein (three content words) is translated into English by the
MWT breast screening (two content words).

Non-compositionality is illustrated when the target MWT is not typically composed of the
translation of its parts (Melamed, 2001). For instance the French MWT curage axillaire
is translated into the English language as axillary dissection whereas the English word
dissection is not the translation of the French word curage. Baldwin and Tanaka (2004)
report that at least 50% of the Japanese N N compounds are not translated through a
compositional strategy into English.

1The French/English/German examples in this paper are extracted from the specialized medical comparable corpus
described in Section 5.

1798



Term variation refers to an MWT that appears in texts in different forms reflecting either
graphical, syntactic, morphological or semantic differences: for example, the French
MWTs cancer du sein and cancer mammaire are both translated by the same English
MWT breast cancer. Source and target MWTs can appear in different syntactic struc-
tures. For example, the French MWT prolifération tumorale of N A pattern is translated
by the English MWT tumour proliferation of N N pattern, where the French adjective
tumorale is linked through morphological derivation to the English noun tumour. The
term variations could also involve paradigmatic variation when one element of the MWT
is substituted by a synonym or a hypernym such as tumour size → diameter tumour in
the source language and not in the target language such as taille tumorale (lit. ’tumour
size’).

It is quite difficult to design a general framework that can address all these problems simul-
taneously (Robitaille et al., 2006) and for any language. The non-compositionality has to be
solved during the translation process as it involves an MWT and its translation. The term
variant problem is generally handled at the monolingual level during the term extraction task.
This is done in two steps: term variant extraction and term variant grouping. A sophisticated
variant recognition and conflation program will handle several types of variants: graphical,
but also morphological and syntactic variation, ideally paradigmatic variants and acronyms.
Using a term variant program allows us to cluster a set of term-like sequences reflecting base
or variant forms. This clustering could be interpreted as a terminology normalization in the
same way as lemmatisation at the morphological level. Handling term variation could indi-
rectly solve part of the fertility problem using the syntactic variant of MWTs: as an example,
in French, the term dépistage du cancer du sein (lit. breast cancer screening) could be collected
as a syntactic variant of the term dépistage du sein (lit. breast screening) and thus provides
a word-to-word translation. In German, the fertility problem could be solved by establishing
an equivalence relation between a morphological compound of the type N1|N2 where | is the
concatenation operator, and a syntagmatic compound of N1N2 pattern: the noun axilladissek-
tion that is morphologically analyzed as axilla|dissektion will be a variant of the MWT axilläre
dissektion.

The compositional method with context-based projection that we introduce in Section 4 will
take into account the non-compositionality and term variation problems and indirectly the
fertility problem through the term variant and the German compound splitting treatments.

3 Compositional Approach

Compositionality is defined as the property where “the meaning of the whole is a function of the
meaning of the parts” (Keenan and Faltz, 1985, p. 24-25): a frying pan is indeed a pan used for
frying. The implementation of the principle of translation compositionality from a comparable
corpus relies on the following steps (Grefenstette, 1999; Tanaka, 2002; Robitaille et al., 2006):

Translation of the source MWT For an MWT of the source language to be translated, each
component of the MWT is translated by looking it up in a dictionary. The lexical form
is examined without checking the part-of-speech (POS). For example, for the French
MWT examen clinique (clinical examination), there are six English translations for examen
(consideration/N, examen/N, examination/N, inspection/N, review/N, test/N) and two
translations for clinique (clinic/N, and clinical/A).

1799



Generation of the candidate translations All possible mappings are constructed regardless
of word order with a total of O(

∏p
i=1 t in!) possible mappings (where t i is the number

of translations of the content word i, and n the number of content words). In the
above example, 24 combinations are obtained. The number of generated translations
can be reduced using MWT POS patterns in the source and the target languages. For
instance, Tanaka and Baldwin (2003) defined the following templates to filter translation
candidates: N1 N2 Japanese structure is translated by N1 N2 (33.2% of the cases), A1 N2
(28.4%), N2 of (the) N1 (4.4%) English structures.

Selection of the candidate translations From the set of translation candidates, the most
likely translations are selected according to term frequency in the target language. In
the above example, the translations are MWTs of the target language identified by the
terminology extraction system.

4 Compositional Method with Context-Based Projection (CMCBP)

The compositional approach that finds translations of multi-word terms is easy to implement,
but it fails when:

1. At least one element of an MWT is not found in the bilingual dictionary and thus cannot
be translated.

2. The translated combination is valid but is not provided by the term extraction program
for the target language. One explanation could be that the target MWT does not occur
in the comparable corpus, or the source concept occurs in the target corpora but under a
non terminology-like form, or an error during the preprocessing of the corpora induces
that the terminology extraction program misses the MWT.

3. The translated combination is not valid. One of the MWT translation problems has been
encountered (see Section 2).

When there is no translation candidates for an MWT, a first solution would be to find its
synonyms in the source language. Similar words are predicted by Pekar et al. (2006) for low-
frequency words and by Sharoff et al. (2009) for wrong translations. CMCBP that deals with
term variants performs a clustering of synonymic terms. The translations that are proposed
are for the set of synonymic term variants.

CMCBP is designed to identify MWT translations in a comparable corpus on a large scale and
is able to solve points 1 and 3. It includes the use of the context of the words (which are
parts of the MWT to be translated) when the compositional approach fails. We refer to the two
monolingual parts of the comparable corpus as the source and target corpus. CMCBP uses four
steps:

Computing the context of the MWT For an MWT or a morphological compound in the
source corpus defined as Cs1Cs2 · · · Csk to be translated (where k is the number of con-
tent words or autonomous morphemes), we look up each component Csi in the bilingual
dictionary. When a component is not found in the bilingual dictionary, we replace it
by co-occurrence information. We compute the co-occurrence information between a
component Csi and the words that co-occur in a window of w words around Csi from

1800



the source corpus. Mutual information or Likelihood-ratio are good measures of the co-
occurrence relationship between 2 words. The co-occurrence information is expressed
with a vector representation called context vector (Vsi). As an example, let us consider
the French MWT antécédent familial (Cs1Cs2). If the first component antécédent (Cs1)
is not found in the bilingual dictionary then this component is replaced by its vector
context: Vs1 (see Figure 1).

Figure 1: Computing context in the source corpus

Transfer of the MWT At this level, we are able to identify two situations depending on
whether or not the components of the MWT are translated:

1. If the component Csi is found in the dictionary, we compute the co-occurrence
information of each translation in the target corpus and store it in a context vector:
V ′si .

2. If the component Csi is not found in the dictionary, we use the context vector of
the source corpus Vsi . The elements of Vsi are projected into the target corpus
using the bilingual dictionary and the transferred context vector becomes: V

′
si . If

the bilingual dictionary provides several translations for an element, all of them
are used but the different translations are weighted according to their frequency
in the target language. If an element is not found in the bilingual dictionary it is
discarded.

In the previous example, if we find two English translations for the component familial
(Cs2) such as familial and family in the target language then we obtain two context
vectors: V

′
s21

and V ′s22 (see Figure 2).

Generation of candidate translations Each MWT of the target language, for which each com-
ponent Ct i is described by its context vector Vt i, is then compared to the transferred
MWT through a similarity measure such as Cosine or Weighted Jaccard. For an MWT
composed of two context vectors Vt1 and Vt2 in the target language and a transferred
MWT composed of two context vectors V

responding to the possible mappings are computed: sim(Vt1, V

5 Resources

In this section, we describe the different resources used for our experiments: the comparable
corpus, the bilingual dictionary, and the multi-word term test set.

5.1 Comparable Corpora

The documents comprising the specialised comparable corpora were taken from the medical
domain within the sub-domain of ‘breast cancer’. These documents have been automatically
selected from scientific paper websites where the title or the keywords of the articles contain
the MWT ‘breast cancer’ in English, ‘cancer du sein’ in French and ‘brustkrebs’ in German. The
compilation of the comparable corpus fulfils the requirements of an LSP comparable corpus:
domain, sub-domain, communicative settings (experts-to-experts) and textual genre are com-
mon characteristics across languages. In this way, we collected 118 documents in English, 130
in French and 103 in German (about 530,000 words for English and French languages and
220,000 words for German language).

5.2 Bilingual Dictionary

The bilingual dictionaries used in our experiments are the French/English dictionary ELRA-
M0033 and the French/German dictionary ELRA-M0034 available from the ELRA catalogue2.
The French/English dictionary contains 243,539 translations and the French/German dictio-
nary 170,967 translations. These are two general language dictionaries which contain only a
few terms related to the medical domain.

5.3 Multi-Word Term Test Set

Terms are extracted monolingually from the comparable corpora. To collect close candidate
terms across languages, it is necessary to use a term extraction program that is multilin-
gually designed. We choose the TTC TermSuite (Rocheteau and Daille, 2011)3 that applies
the same term extraction method to several languages including French, German and En-
glish. TermSuite first normalises the texts through the following linguistic pre-processing steps:
tokenisation, part-of-speech tagging and lemmatisation using TreeTagger (Schmid, 1995).
TermSuite then extracts SWTs and MWTs whose syntactic patterns correspond either to a
canonical or a variation structure. The patterns are expressed using MULTEXT part-of-speech
tags and are provided for each language. The main patterns, whatever the language is, are N
and A for SWTs. The main patterns of MWTs are for:
• French N N: ganglion sentinelle (sentinel lymph node); N Sp N: cancer du sein (breast

cancer); N A: curage axillaire (axillary dissection);
• English N N: breast cancer; A N: far therapy; N Sp N: ;
• German A N: thromboembolischer vorfall (thromboembolic incident); N Sp N: patientin

mit mammakarzinom (patient with breast cancer); N D : g N: erfahrung der früherken-
nung (experience of early detection).

The variants handled for MWTs are graphical, morphological, and syntactic. Both SWTs and
MWTs accept variants but some are more likely to concern one main type such syntactic vari-
ants for MWTs. TermSuite defines a morphological variant as a morphological modification of
one of the components of the MWT, and a syntactical variant as the adding of another word
at the frontier or inside the MWT. For example, in the French part of the comparable corpus,
the MWT candidate cancer du sein (breast cancer) appears in the following forms where shared
items are numbered with the same values.

1804



• base form of N1 S1p N2 pattern: cancer du sein (breast cancer);
• inflexional variant: cancers du sein (breast cancers);
• syntactic variant (insertion inside the base form of a modifier): N1 A S1p N2 cancer

primitif du sein (primary breast cancer);

• syntactic variant (expansion coordination of base form): N1 Sp N S1p N2 cancer
des ovaires et du sein (ovarian and breast cancer).

In German, it is necessary to reconsider the rough distinction between single- multi-word terms
in order to take morphological compounds into account. The common German compounds of
the type N1|N2 (”|” is the concatenation operation) are often translated by N Sp N patterns in
French: Produktionsstandort↔ site de production or by the N N patterns in English. Morpho-
logical compounds are identified by tokenisation programs as single-word terms but they look
quite similar to multi-word terms. We use the morphological splitter which is combined with a
dictionary look-up developed by Weller and Heid (2012) in order to get the MWT syntagmatic
equivalence of a German morphological compound.

In order to build the test set, we have selected the French MWTs extracted by TermSuite for
which the number of occurrences is greater than or equal to 5. The test set is composed of 976
French MWTs for which 90% of the base forms are only composed of two content words.

6 Experiments

In this section, we evaluate the performance of the dictionary look-up, the compositional
method and CMCBP on the quality of bilingual terminology extraction.

6.1 Dictionary Look-up

First of all, we count the number of terms of the test set directly translated by looking
them up in the bilingual dictionaries. From the 976 French MWTs to be translated, 51 are
recorded in the French/English dictionary and 12 in the French/German dictionary. Here, the
MWTs correctly translated are mainly generic terms that are not specific to the thematic of
breast cancer such as traitement médical/medical treatment and acide aminé/amino acid: in
French/English and analyse statistique/statistische untersuchung (statistical analysis) and effet
secondaire/begleiterscheinung (side effect) in French/German. In this instance we were unable
to generate any translations for 836 French MWTs in English and for 964 French MWTs in
German.

6.2 Compositional Method

We then evaluate the quality of the translations provided by the compositional method (the
MWTs found in the dictionary are not used). Table 1 shows the results obtained for the trans-
lation from French/English and German/English. The first column indicates the number of
French MWTs that are translated. Since the compositional approach can give several target
translations for one French MWT, the last two columns indicate the Top1 and Top5 accuracy.
To evaluate the Topn accuracy, we first keep for each French word to be translated its n first
candidate translations and then measure the accuracy of the ranked lists obtained, i.e. the
proportion of lists comprising the expected translation. Here, the candidate translations are

1805



ranked according to their frequency in the target part of the comparable corpus. The results
of this experiment show that 140 of the 836 French MWTs are translated into English for the
Top5 with a high level of accuracy: 79.1%, and 87 of the 964 French MWTs are translated into
German for the Top5 with a high level of accuracy: 95.7%. Here, we were unable to generate
any translations for 785 French MWTs in English and 877 French MWTs in German.

# trans. Top1 Top5

French/English 140 73.2% 79.1%
French/German 87 88.8% 95.7%

Table 1: Results for the compositional method

6.3 Compositional Method with Context-Based Projection

We now apply CMCBP (here again the MWTs found in the dictionary are not used). In this
experiment, the parameters required for our approach are as follows: the size of the context
window w is up to 3 (i.e. a seven-word window), the association measure is Mutual Informa-
tion, and the distance measure is Cosine. Other combinations of parameters were assessed but
the previous parameters gave the best performance. Table 2 presents the percentage of French
terms for which the correct translation is obtained among the Top 1, 5, 10, and 20 candidates
translations from French to English and German. Table 2 shows that 514 of the 836 French
MWTs are translated into English with the CMCBP with an accuracy of 42.1% for the Top1
and 57.1% for the Top20 and 510 of the 964 French MWTs are translated into German with
an accuracy of 44.3% for the Top1 and 51.2% for the Top20. These results indicate that the
majority of the correct translated MWTs are in fact obtained from the Top5. Moreover, the
CMCBP retains the advantages of the compositional method. All translations obtained with
the compositional method are found in the same rank with the CMCBP.

# trans. Top1 Top5 Top10 Top20

French/English 514 42.1% 55.4% 56.8% 57.1%
French/German 510 44.3% 49.4% 51.2% 51.2%

Table 2: Results for the compositional method enhanced with context alignments

From the MWTs that are correctly translated and not found by the compositional approach, we
found a large majority of French MWTs involving a relational adjective. However, the French
MWT dépistage mammographique is not translated by the compositional approach since the
French relational adjective mammographique is not found in the dictionaries. In contrast, the
correct English translation mammographic screening is found in the Top3 with the CMCBP be-
cause we have associated the French context vector of mammographique with the English con-
text vector of mammographic and the French/English pair dépistage/screening is found in the
dictionary. The other French MWTs correctly translated are mainly MWTs with a compositional
structure for which one element is not found in the dictionary such as: amélioration significa-
tive/significant benefit (Top1), and caractéristique tumoral/tumor charakteristik (tumor charac-
teristic) (Top1) or without a compositional structure such as: bras témoin/control arm (Top1),

1806



and curage axillaire/axillary dissection (Top11). From the MWTs incorrectly translated, we can
point out two main cases. First, we find target MWTs semantically close to the French MWTs
to be translated such as: postmenopausalen frau (postmenopausal women) (Top5) and prä-
menopausalen frau (premenopausal women) (Top7) for femme ménopausé (menopausal women).
Postmenopausalen frau and prämenopausalen frau are morphological variants of menopausalen
frau and should have been identified as thus by the term extraction program, but unfortunately
the canonical form amenopausalen frau does not occur in the comparable corpora. Secondly,
we found only a sub-part of the English MWTs such as: node dissection for curage ganglionnaire
(lymph node dissection). This case needs further work as it deals with a fertility case that is not
able to be solved with the term variant recognition program.

7 Related Work

The principle of translation compositionality is restrictive. Several studies have concentrated
on enhancing the compositional approach: Robitaille et al. (2006) proposed a backing-off
method: if there is insufficient data in the dictionary to translate an MWT of n content words,
a scaled MWT with a length less than, or equal to, n is used instead. Morin and Daille (2010)
proposed an extended compositional method that bridges the gap between MWTs of different
syntactic structures through morphological links. The compositional approach is also called
the “bag-of-equivalents” approach (Vintar, 2010) when the bilingual dictionary is built from a
parallel corpus and contains all words that occur in the corpus and their suggested translation
equivalents, together with a probability score. The “bag-of-equivalents” approach has been
used for SMT to build a word-level translation lexicon from parallel corpora (Munteanu and
Marcu 2006) and a cognate lexicon from comparable corpora (Koehn and Knight 2002).

Much of the work involving general or LSP comparable corpora has focused
on extracting SWT translations using only contextual information (Fung, 1998;
Rapp, 1999; Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002; Gaussier et al., 2004; Morin et al., 2007;
Laroche and Langlais, 2010, among others). The contextual information method as defined
by Fung (1998) gives very low results for MWTs: from the 785 non translated French MWTs,
483 French MTWS with an accuracy of 15.6% (Top10) were found.

CMCBP is a new method dedicated to MWT that combines both the compositional and the con-
textual information. CMCBP significantly improves both the compositional method commonly
used for bilingual alignment of MWTs extracted from comparable corpora, and the contex-
tual information method we obtained from English: 514 French translations of MWTS with a
precision of 56.8% and 510 German translations of MWTS with a precision of 51.2% for Top10.

8 Conclusion

In this study, we have investigated the compilation of bilingual terminologies from a specialized
comparable corpus and show how to push back the limits of the compositional approach used
in alignment programs to translate MWTs. We have proposed CMCBP: a compositional method
enhanced with pre-processed context information. The experiments that we carried out have
shown that we increase the results of the compositional approach by providing a significant
number of additional correct lexical entries that could not be identified either by the dictionary
look-up or by compositional methods.

In future work, we will generalise this method to obtain an homogeneous modular design for
all languages by reconsidering the rough distinction between simple and complex terms and
applying the CMCBP both at the morphological and the lexical levels. We will investigate how

to improve the solving of the fertility problem for MWTs which produces incomplete transla-
tions. Fertility was only partially solved thanks to the term variation treatment associated to
the CMCBP. We aim to modify the evaluation protocol by accepting one-to-many translations
in the case of synonym or semantically-related translation candidates that are not handled
through term variation processing.
