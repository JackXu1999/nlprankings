Abstract 

This article presents a new approach of us-
ing dependency treebanks in theoretical syn-
tactic research: The view of dependency 
treebanks as combined networks. This al-
lows the usage of advanced tools for net-
work analysis that quite easily provide novel 
insight into the syntactic structure of lan-
guage. As an example of this approach, we 
will show how the network approach can 
provide an interesting angle to discuss the 
degree of connectivity of Chinese syntactic 
categories, which it is not so easy to detect 
from the original treebank. 

1 Hierarchical Features inside Lan-
guage 

It is a widely accepted idea that language is a 
complex, multi-level system (Kretzschmar 
2009, Beckner et al. 2009, Hudson 2006, 
Mel’čuk 1988, Sgall 1986, Lamb 1966). Lan-
guages can be described and analyzed on dif-
ferent linguistics levels, such as morphology, 
syntax, and semantic etc. Moreover, these dif-
ferent linguistics levels form a surface-deep 
hierarchy (Mel’čuk 1981). Besides the macro 
multi-level hierarchy of languages, the unequal 
relationships between linguistic units in sen-
tences are also widely recognized by linguists. 
Such as the concept of governor in dependency 
grammar, head of phrase in HPSG etc. In this 
article, we aim to define a new kind of one-
directional asymmetrical relationships between 
linguistic units, half-way between the macro-
model of language and the syntactic analysis of 
single sentences. 
  Hierarchies have been recognized as one of 
the key features of any formal language de-
scription on two very different levels: 
  Firstly, linguistics as a whole wants to de-
scribe the relation between Saussure’s signi-
fied and signifier (Saussure 2011) (or 
Mel’čuk’s meaning and text (Mel’čuk 1981), 

or Chomsky’s logical and phonetic structure 
(Chomsky 2002)). Although the theories differ 
widely on how the steps between the two sides 
of language should be described, all theories 
developed a hierarchy of interrelated structures 
that build up the language model. 
  Secondly, each subdomain of linguistics has 
developed hierarchical structures describing 
each utterance, for example on a semantic, 
communicative, phonological, and, most note-
worthy, syntactic level. 
  It is important to reflect on the wide gap 
between these two types of hierarchies: One 
describing the language as a whole (i.e. all 
languages), the other just describing one utter-
ance of one particular language by hierarchical 
means. This paper describes how intermediate 
structures can be discovered, intermediate in a 
sense that they describe a global feature of 
syntax of one language, which could then be 
compared to equivalent analyses of other lan-
guages.   
  In sections 2 to 4, we will show that syntac-
tic categories of a language as a whole are re-
lated in complex ways, thus establishing a hi-
erarchy among the categories. In order to pro-
ceed to the actual analysis we first have to 
show two points: 

1. The notion of syntactic category (or 
part of speech, POS) has an existence 
in the syntactic model as a whole that 
goes beyond the classification of indi-
vidual words. 

2. A dependency treebank provides 
means of studying meaningful rela-
tionships between syntactic categories. 

  To 1: When developing a system of catego-
rization for a given language, the syntactician 
already has a global view of grouping together 
syntactic units that have comparable distribu-
tional or morphological properties with the 
goal to allow for the expression of rules that 
generalize beyond the actual linguistic evi-
dence. However, the analysis remains local in 

74



a sense that the syntactician does not create 
relationships inside the proposed categoriza-
tion, the objective of the analysis simply being 
to put forward distinctive features that can be 
tested and applied to the data. It is thus reason-
able to search for ways of exploring general 
properties that have been implicitly encoded 
with the categorization. 
  To 2: The aforementioned distributional and 
morphological properties of syntactic catego-
ries make them an ideal candidate in the search 
for global syntactic feature of language, but the 
theoretical aspects and the generalizability at 
the basis of the categorization are difficult to 
study empirically. Syntactic dependency, how-
ever, describes links that represent the distribu-
tional properties of a word: Words of the same 
category are in general part of a paradigm of 
words that can hold the same syntactic posi-
tion. A dependency treebank can accordingly 
be seen as relations between paradigms of 
words. 

2 Networks 
Over the last decade or so, driven by theoreti-
cal considerations as well as by the simple 
availability of large amount of connected data, 
network analysis has become an important fac-
tor in various domains of research ranging 
from sociology, biology to physics and com-
puter science (Barabási & Bonabeau 2003, 
Watts & Strogatz 1998). 
  Equally, digital language data and the popu-
larity of statistical approaches had the first ef-
fect that many linguists, who are mainly inter-
ested in theoretical questions as well as NLP 
researchers have started to quantitatively de-
scribe microscopic linguistic features in a cer-
tain level of a language system by using au-
thentic language data. Despite the fruitful find-
ings, one question remains unclear. That is, 
how can the statistical analysis of raw texts 
(e.g. n-gram based language models) or of 
treebanks (syntactic models, i.e. the statistical 
prediction of likely syntactic relations) provide 
linguistic insight? Or put differently, how does 
a complete empirical language system look 
like? 
  As an attempt to answer this question, the 
network approach, an analysis method empha-
sizing the macro features of linguistic struc-
tures, has been introduced into linguistic stud-
ies (Solé 2005, Ferrer-i-Cancho & Solé 2001). 
By analyzing different linguistics networks 

constructed from authentic language data, 
many linguistic features, such as lexical, syn-
tactic or semantic features have been discov-
ered and successfully applied in linguistic ty-
pological studies thus revealing the huge po-
tential of linguistic networks research (Cong & 
Liu 2014). 
  What is particularly interesting about the 
recent development in this area is that re-
searchers have been able to systematically ana-
lyze linguistic features beyond the sentence 
level since the network approach is not intrin-
sically limited by traditional linguistic feature 
annotations in corpora based on the lexical or 
the sentence level. It seems possible that lin-
guistic network model, as the representation of 
the whole body of language data, is a better 
approach to explore the human language sys-
tems. 
  Moreover, just as all the networks construct-
ed based on real data (Barabási & Bona-beau 
2003, Watts & Strogatz 1998), the linguistic 
networks are ‘small world’ and ‘scale free’ 
networks too (Solé 2005, Ferrer-i-Cancho & 
Solé 2001, Liu 2008), which indicates that 
there are central nodes (Chen & Liu 2015, 
Chen 2013), or hubs, in language networks. 
And that will provide a natural hierarchy be-
tween the nodes or the units of the networks. 

3 Building a Syntactic Network 
When we talk about the structure of languages, 
the first thing that naturally comes to our mind 
is the syntactic structure. Both phrase structure 
grammar and dependency grammar have been 
developed and deployed in the analysis of cor-
pora. In the past decade, dependency annotated 
treebanks have become the latest hype in em-
pirical linguistics studies. Driven by the statis-
tical NLP development and the linguist’s fas-
cination of creating a treebank following spe-
cific theoretical principles, considerable efforts 
have been devoted to treebank creation and 
analysis (among many others Marcus et al. 
1993, Lacheret et al. 2014, Mille et al. 2013). 
Solid theoretical foundation and available 
well-annotated data made syntactic structural 
analysis the candidate of choice for most stud-
ies in linguistic network analysis just as in the 
present study. 
  In more detail, dependency treebanks, espe-
cially multi-layer dependency treebanks such 
as Ancora-UPF, offer interesting connections 
between texts and the representation of mean-

ing, which allow us to pursue further discus-
sion about the semantic structure more easily 
in the future. In addition, since our goal is find-
ing the hierarchy between linguistic units of 
the same type, phrase structure, which intro-
duces different levels of constituents, is less 
apt for the task than dependency structure. 
  Dependency treebanks commonly encode 
two kinds of information for each word: the 
word’s syntactic relation with its governor and 
the word’s syntactic category (or POS). Thus, 
a dependency treebank can be seen as a collec-
tion of dependency trees on words or on POS 
tags. We will call the first a ‘word dependency 
tree’ and the latter a ‘POS dependency tree’ 
which will be the base of the present experi-
ment. Both trees can represent the syntactic 
structure of linguistic units in a sentence, while 
POS trees are more abstract and less detailed 
in a way. 
  Various previous research has been under-
taken on the network analysis of syntactic de-
pendency treebanks (Chen & Liu 2011, Chen 
et al. 2011, Čech et al. 2011, Liu 2008, Ferrer-
i-Cancho 2005), some also based on the same 
Chinese dependency treebank used for this 
study (Liu 2008, Chen 2013, Chen & Liu 
2011). These approaches all used word de-
pendency trees, thus obtaining results on the 
network behavior of individual words. The 
central nodes in networks based on word de-
pendency trees, however, are highly correlated 
with the frequency of the word itself and it is 
difficult to account for the influence of the un-
equal distribution of the different words. In 
POS dependency trees, the different classes are 
more evenly distributed and the role of fre-
quency of categories may be less crucial. 
  Moreover, the high number of different 
word types makes the data exploration and 
explanation more complex than in networks 
based on POS dependency trees. Our specific 
goal of this present study is to find the hierar-

chies on Chinese categories (or POS) in the 
syntactic network which is constructed on em-
pirical language data, or more specifically, the 
Chinese dependency treebank. 
  The basic idea underlying dependency net-
works is very simple: Instead of viewing the 
trees as linearly aligned on the sentences of the 
corpus, we fuse together each occurrence of 
the same POS to a unique node, thus creating a 
unique and connected network of POS, in 
which the POS are the vertices and dependen-
cy relations are the edges or arcs. This con-
nected network is then ready to undergo com-
mon network analysis with tools like UCINET 
(Borgatti et al. 2002), PAJEK (Nooy et al. 
2005), NETDRAW (Borgatti 2002), CYTO-
SCAPE (Shannon 2003), and so on. For more 
details, we refer to Liu (2008) for a description 
of multiple ways of network creation from de-
pendency treebanks. 
  For the present work, we used the following 
treebank of Chinese, the XBSS treebank (Liu 
2008): The XBSS has 37,024 tokens and is 
composed of 2 sections of different styles: 

• “新闻联播 ” xin-wen-lian-bo ‘news 
feeds’ (name of a famous Chinese TV 
news program), is a transcription of 
the program. The text is usually read 
and the style of the language is quite 
formal. The section contains 17,061 
words. 

• “实话实说” shi-hua-shi-shuo ‘straight 
talk’ (name of a famous Chinese talk 
show), is of more colloquial language 
type, containing spontaneous speech 
appearing in interviews of people of 
various social backgrounds, ranging 
from farmers to successful business-
men, The section contains 19, 963 
words. 

Both sections have been annotated manually as 
described by Liu (2006). Table 1 shows the file 
format of this Chinese dependency treebank, 

76

The details of all codes and symbols in tables 
and figures in this paper are available in Ap-

pendix A. 

which is similar to the CoNLL dependency 
format, although a bit more redundant (double 
information on the governor’s POS) to allow 
for easy exploitation of the data in a spread-
sheet and converting to language networks. 
The data can be represented as simple depend-
ency graphs as shown in Figure 1: 1a is the 
dependency tree of the words in the sentence 
and 1b illustrates the dependency relationship 
between POS in this example. The trees both 
show a bottom-top hierarchy between the lin-
guistic units in this sample sentence.  

With POS as nodes, dependencies as arcs, and 
the frequency of the dependencies as the value 
of arcs, we can build a network. For example, 
our Chinese treebank can be represented as 
Figure 2, an image, generated by the network 
analysis software Pajek, which gives a broad 
overview of the global structure of the tree-
bank (excluding punctuation).  
  The resulting network it is a fully connected 
network without any isolated vertices. As we 
set the distance between POS inversely propor-
tional to the value of arcs (the detailed infor-
mation of arcs values can be found in the table 
of appendix C), the graph actually can give us 
an intuitive idea of the ‘clusters’ of syntactic 
connections between POS already. 

For minimizing the effect of genre difference 
to the data result, we chose to include two sim-
ilar size sections of text in our treebank. How-
ever, some other factors may remain that could 
possibly affect the result of the study, such as 
the size of the treebank, the annotation schema, 
the language type, etc. We will leave these dis-
cussions for further work. 
  The reason we chose Chinese rather than 
other ‘big’ languages such as English, French 
or Spanish is that Chinese, as an isolating lan-
guage, lacks morphological changes. Since 
there is no ‘difference’ between tokens and 
lemmas in Chinese dependency treebanks, 
Chinese syntactic networks built on dependen-
cy treebanks would only have one unique form 
for each treebank while every single inflec-
tional language would have two different types 
of syntactic networks, word-type syntactic 
network and lemma syntactic network. As so, 
Chinese is a better choice for this study con-
sidering no ambiguity of defining a ‘syntactic 
network’. 

4 Data Analysis 
There are two simple ways in a network model 
to detect the hierarchy of nodes. First by the 
degrees which represents the number of differ-
ent types of links one node can have; second 
by the summed value of arcs which indicates, 
we believe, the intensity of the combination 
capacity of one node has. When one node can 
link to more nodes (or has a higher degree), as 
well as more connections to other nodes (or 
summed value of arcs), it is more likely to be

the ‘hub’ or occupying a central position of the 
network structure. When we analyze or visual-
ize a network, software such as Pajek try to 
optimize the positions of nodes so that they 
will fit the distance difference between pairs of 
nodes. However, for more precise result, we 
need to do a multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) 
analysis. With Ucinet (V 6.186), we did a non-
metric MDS analysis to our POS network data, 
and made the network data a two dimensional 
perceptual map as in Figure 3. The actual co-
ordinate values of all the nodes are listed in 
Table 2. 

Kruskal (1964) proposed to measure the quali-
ty of MDS result by index STRESS (the equa-
tion of STRESS can be found in appendix B). 
When the STRESS index is no more than 0.1, 
the result is acceptable for further discussion. 
The STRESS index of our analysis here is 
0.100, which means that we are good to con-

tinue. 
  According to Figure 3, we can roughly di-
vide the POS in to central, middle, and mar-
ginal parts. Since we are talking about the syn-
tactic dependency structure here, verbs are ex-
pected be the very center of syntactic struc-
tures. With verb as the center, nouns, adjec-
tives, and auxiliaries constructed scattered 
closely around the verb and constructed as the 
central part of the diagram, mimetic words, 
interjections, and affixes are far away from the 
center and they are the marginal part of the 
diagram. All the others POS fell between these 
two extremes and become the middle part of 
the diagram. The hierarchical structure of POS 
seems relatively clear according to the percep-
tual map already. 
  Yet, for more accurate result, we rely on the 
coordinate values of the POS in Figure 3 to do 
a clustering analysis, see Figure 4 (done with 
OriginPro, V 9.0). The result further confirmed 
the division we did according to Figure 3 but 
in greater details. Such as, we can find ‘smaller 
groups’ inside the central and middle parts of 
the network: 

• Inside the central part, there are actual-
ly two small groups: verbs and nouns, 
adjectives and auxiliaries. 

• Inside the middle part, there are also 
two closely tied small groups: proposi-
tions and coordinators, numerals and 
classifiers. 

All these results correspond surprisingly well 
to our understanding of the Chinese language. 
For example, verbs are for sure the very center 
of the syntactic structure just as illustrated in 
Figure 3. Nouns, auxiliaries and adjectives are 
relatively frequent words in the treebank and 
hold important roles in syntactic well-formed 
sentences, they form the central part and are 
thus located in a relatively higher position in 
the POS hierarchy we built and showed in Fig-

78

ure 3 and Figure 4. Meanwhile, the infrequent 
mimetic words, interjections, and affixes are 
syntactically not very important in Chinese, 
therefore they have been put on a lower posi-
tion, a more marginal part, of our POS hierar-
chy. Theoretically, the POS hierarchy may be 
caused by the uneven distribution of valence of 
POS, or more generally, by the unequal capaci-
ty of combination force of the POS. The bigger 
the valence a POS has, i.e. the stronger its ca-
pacity of combination it owns, the higher pos-
sibility of getting into the central part of the 
syntactic system. 
  When we look into the resulting data, it 
seems that the word or POS frequency played 
a role here. It seems that the more frequent 
POS in the treebank has been put in the more 
central part in the hierarchy, see table 3. 

As much as connections between our results 
and the POS frequency, they are not fully cor-
responding to each other, such as: 

• nouns have the highest frequency in 
XBSS but they are not in the most cen-
tral position in the hierarchy while 
verbs are. 

• pronouns have the third highest fre-
quency but only belong to the middle 
part of the system, meanwhile the ad-
jectives locate on the relatively central 
position with a moderate frequency.   

• conjunctions have relatively low fre-
quency but they locate on a position 
closer to the center than numerals, 
classifiers, and adverbs do, and these 
POS all have greater frequency than 
conjunctions do.  

We think the frequency of POS might be an 
explicit result of constructing sentences by fol-
lowing the rules of the Chinese syntactic sys-
tem, which is a fully connected system that has 
a hierarchical feature, see Figure 2. The fre-
quency distribution index treats the linguistic 
units as individuals while the network model 
also address the importance of the connections 
between linguistic units. 
  Although further discussion is needed for 
understanding the connections between the 
frequency distribution of POS and the posi-
tions that POS occupies in syntactic network, 
we speculate that the hierarchy feature may be 
a motive behind the POS frequency distribu-
tion or word frequency distribution, rather than, 
contrarily, that the central position is due to the 
high frequency. 

5 Conclusion 
For a long time, the discussion of the hierar-
chical features of language is mainly focusing 
on the hierarchical structure between different 
linguistic layers or inside a sentence. It seems 
that there is an empty gap between the very 
detailed sentence structures and general lin-
guistic layers. If we find hierarchical structure 
inside a sentence as well as the text-meaning 
process, then cannot we find hierarchical struc-
tures in between, inside each linguistic layer? 
  The challenge of breaking the boundary of 
sentences while remaining reasonable syntactic 
structures was met by the network model. With 
the dependency treebank, we constructed a 
POS network and did several quantitative 
analysis to the language network data. 
  With empirical data support, our study 
found a clear hierarchical structure of POS in 
Chinese syntactic system. Although further 
study is needed for a more insightful discus-
sion, our preliminary results made us believe 
that the hierarchical configuration is a natural 
(i.e. inborn or core) feature of language sys-
tems, which can be seen not only in the hierar-
chy of different linguistics levels but also in-
side certain linguistics layer. Moreover, such 
configurations probably exist inside each lin-
guist level. 
  The study showed a method that not only 
allows us to do quantitative analysis on lan-
guage data, but also empowers the theoretical 
discussion by offering support of concrete em-
pirical data. We can discuss the hierarchy fea-
tures of language by analyzing the authentic 

79



language data and visually present it to give us 
a more intuitive understanding of abstract con-
cepts. 
  We believe the hierarchy we observed in 
this study can be seen as the result of the une-
ven distribution of linguistic units’ valence, or 
more generally, linguistic units’ capacity of 
combination. Since the valence of linguistic 
units is, actually a concept which closely links 
to semantics and syntax, we expect the hierar-
chical structure that we found in this study to 
equally be observable on the semantic level 
although classes in propositional semantics 
differ from syntactic categories. The common 
points and differences of hierarchical struc-
tures between syntactic and semantic layers 
can be a possible future direction of the meth-
ods presented in this study, as soon as compa-
rable semantic treebanks will be available. 
  As we mentioned before, in future work, 
furthermore, we have to explore the effect of 
some factors such as the size of the treebank, 
the annotation scheme, the language type, etc. 
  This paper addresses the importance of de-
veloping techniques of treebank exploitation 
for syntactic research ranging from theorem 
verification to discovery of new linguistic rela-
tions invisible to the eye. We advocate in par-
ticular for the usage of network tools in this 
process and showed how a treebank can, and, 
in our view, should be seen as a unique net-
work.
