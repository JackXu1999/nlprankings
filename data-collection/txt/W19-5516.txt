Abstract 

The word “Credit” comes from the Latin ‘credere’ 

which means “to give trust”. The way this trust is 

being given today by financial institutions is 

mainly based on statistical methods, using financial 

information - such as the revenues of an individual, 

the money he/she spends monthly, etc. - to quantify 

the chances of a successful loan repayment. By 

definition, this method of quantifying risk limits 

the access to financial services to individuals who 

have banking information history. In emerging 

markets, as described here, a huge part of the 

population doesn't meet these criteria and is 

accordingly left outside of the equation. This paper 

discusses alternative approaches to allow these 

unbanked people to access financial services in 

reviewing current and innovative Natural Language 

Processing and Natural Language Understanding 

methods. The latter support excellent risk 

quantification results without affecting the privacy 

of the borrower and result in moving from biased 

creditworthiness to broader trustworthiness. 

1 Introduction 

About 90% of today’s global data were created over the last 

two years alone1. The most recent estimations indicate that 

80% of the total existing data is unstructured2. This vast 

expanse of data contains valuable information that can be 

used to augment a wide range of processes in the financial 

sector including fraud detection, market prediction, 

customer relationship management but also credit scoring. 

Contemporarily, the way credit risk is being assessed by 

financial institutions relies heavily on financial information, 

or creditworthiness, such as the FICO scores. In the USA,

the-smart-persons-guide

for example, over 90% of top lenders use FICO Scores as 

their credit scores3. The makers of the FICO scores have not 

publicized how the scores are calculated4. But they 

disseminated the weights of the criteria that they look at as: 

35% payment history, 30% amount owed, 15% length of 

history, 10% new credit, 10% types of credit used. 

Consequently, as they can only provide little of this type of 

information, “two billion of adults - more than half of the 

world’s working adults - are still excluded from formal 

financial services” according to the UNCDF Annual report5.  

Such scoring models are even less applicable to emerging 

markets, since the majority of the population doesn’t 

possess any type of financial information. For example, in 

the Philippines, 77% of the population is considered 

unbanked -i.e. doesn’t have a bank account, according to the 

BSP, the Central Bank of the Philippines6. 

Aligned with the United Nations’ Financial Inclusion pillar, 

one of the key pillars required to reach its 17 Sustainable 

Development Goals, this article aims at exploring NLU-

based viable alternative forms of risk analysis to enable 

greater access to credit. 

2 Creditworthiness evaluated via Machine 

Learning approaches 

Recent advances in Machine Learning, and more broadly in 

Artificial Intelligence [Bach et al., 2019], have enabled the 

emergence, in the last few years, of alternative methods for 

qualifying and quantifying the creditworthiness of an 

individual, using non-financial information innovative

approaches such as phone log analysis [Shema, 2019] or 

[Agarwal et al., 2018] or social network analysis7. A few 

startups have emerged from those efforts, and have 

displayed encouraging results in helping solving the 

problem of financial inclusion for emerging markets 

including Lenddo in Singapore, previously mentioned, or 

Sesame Credit in China. 

Nevertheless, these approaches tend to be invasive, with 

little care over the users’ privacy, e.g. requiring the sharing 

of personal contacts with the system, etc. For this reason, 

another approach, based on Natural Language Processing 

(NLP) & Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tools, 

could enable a new baseline to quantifying risk with regards 

to predicting borrower repayment behavior and exclusively 

accessing information directly related to the user. This 

approach would also allow a change of paradigm, from 

scoring the Creditworthiness of an individual to scoring his 

Trustworthiness. 

Creating NLP tools that preserve privacy has been 

addressed in the healthcare industry. The US National 

Library of Medicine’s Lister Hill National Center for 

Biomedical Communications8 uses NLP to “de-identify” 

clinical information in narrative medical reports, protecting 

patient privacy while preserving clinical knowledge.  

In this specific case, NLP has be used to ensure that all the 

information related to individual private information can be 

identified and then "de-identified." 

3 Trustworthiness evaluated via NLU 

approaches 

In the last few years, NLP and NLU have gained a lot of 

traction across industries, thanks to the progress made in 

Deep Learning and the capability it has brought along to 

analyze text at a semantic level - with discoveries such as 

word embeddings [Mikolov et al., 2013], when previous 

approaches were mostly limited to statistical analysis. 

This new capacity enabled a deeper level of analysis, 

allowing different levels of understanding of a text 

document, for example combining the content itself with the 

non-explicit information such as emotions. Such capacity is 

being used by call centers for example to detect sentiment 

such as anger and stress through analysis of sentences’ 

structures and the choice of words [Kumar et al., 2012] or 

[Seyeditabari et al., 2018] in order to adapt answers 

provided by the representative to a request, in real time. 

This NLP-based approach, generalized to credit scoring, 

allows to bridge the gap and understand hidden patterns that 

cannot be humanly detected. It relies on many more data 

points than usual decision-making processes, providing 

7 - https://patents.justia.com/patent/8694401

8 - https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/project/de-identification-tools 

better estimates and enabling to identify patterns requiring 

further attention from the decision maker, while getting a 

more nuanced view of trustworthiness with an improved 

rating accuracy of loans. 

It could, among other criteria, help to: 

• Detect & score business knowledge of the

borrower by understanding the person’s

entrepreneurial ability and attitude toward financial

planning. This approach has been successfully

implemented by platforms such as Capital Float

and Microbnk;

• Detect fraud attempt by automatically detecting

incoherencies in the information provided by the

borrower [Iter et al., 2018];

• Detect attempts to convey alternative messages: as

discovered by [Netzer et al., 2018] where data from

Peer-to-Peer lending platforms such as Lending

Club and Prosper is analyzed, showing that the

inclusion of alternative messages - such as

religious references, in loan application would lead

to poorer repayment rate. A potential explanation

of this phenomenon could be an attempt from the

borrower to call to the lender’s emotions, as a way

to falsely convince him of a favorable outcome.

Additionally, as showcased by the company Microbnk in 

their related patent US20170018030A1, this type of model 

could even be more powerful if combined with other 

alternatives forms of data such as psychometric data. For 

example: 

• Counting the number of times, a borrower presses a

key Vs. the number of characters in his description;

• Combining NLP with voice tone analysis -among

other external parameters.

4 Discussion 

In this article, it has been explored how Natural Language 

Processing/Natural Language Understanding could bring 

financial solutions to the unbanked populations through 

innovative approaches. NLP being fundamentally less 

invasive than requiring direct access to a person’s full 

contact list or social media account, it represents a fairer 

way to assess risk with a capability to reach a broader 

audience. 

However, monitoring criteria that would indicate, for 

example, the education level of a person, through 

grammatical analysis, as a proxy for potentially quantifying 

the income level of a person would re-inject the initial 

biases, likewise deteriorating the score of an individual 

because this person lives in a low-income neighborhood. 

Particular attention will be required to maximize an ethical 

methodology in implementing NLP/NLU solutions.
