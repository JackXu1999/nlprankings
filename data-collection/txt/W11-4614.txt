Abstract
A common problem when combining two
bilingual dictionaries to make a third, us-
ing one common language as a pivot lan-
guage, is the emergence of false trans-
lations due to lexical ambiguity between
words in the languages involved. This pa-
per examines if the translation accuracy
improves when using part-of-speech filter-
ing of translation candidates. To exam-
ine this, two different Japanese-Swedish
lexicons were created, one with part-of-
speech filtering, one without. The re-
sults show 33 % less translation candidates
and a higher quality lexicon when using
part-of-speech filtering. It also resulted
in a free lexicon of Swedish translations
to 40 716 Japanese entries with a 90 %
precision, and the conclusion that part-of-
speech filtering is an easy way of improv-
ing the translation quality in this context.

1 Introduction

Bilingual dictionaries are specialized dictionaries
used to translate words or phrases from one lan-
guage to another. They aid us in understanding
other languages, people and cultures – something
that becomes more and more important in today’s
high paced Internet connected society.

The manual creation of bilingual dictionaries is
very time consuming and requires hard work. Sev-
eral automatic methods have been proposed to aid
this work. The more common ones are statistical
analysis of parallel corpora or by translating from
one language to another through a common third
language – the pivot language. These methods are,
however, not perfect and this paper aims to inves-
tigate how to improve on these methods, in partic-
ular how part-of-speech filtering affects automatic
generation of translation candidates when using a
pivot language.

2 Background

An alternative to corpus based methods was pro-
posed by Tanaka and Umemura (1994) where they
showed that it is possible to automate the trans-
lation from source language to target language
through a common intermediate language. Here
a Japanese-English and an English-French dictio-
nary were used to automatically generate trans-
lation candidates of Japanese-French translations.
They discovered some false translations, however,
and in order to filter out these inverse consulta-
tion—a method for assessing the quality of a trans-
lation candidate—was proposed.

One time inverse consultation is done by tak-
ing each translation candidate in the target lan-
guage and translating it back to the intermediate
language. These translations are then compared to
the translations of the word from the source lan-
guage into the intermediate language. The larger
the number of common translations in the inter-
mediate language, the better candidate. In this
way it can be measured how close the meaning of
the original word is to the meaning of the transla-
tion candidate. In two times inverse consultation,
also proposed by Tanaka and Umemura (1994),
the method is taken one step further and the trans-
lations in the intermediate language are translated
back to the source language and compared to the
source word.

Shirai and Yamamoto (2001) proposed a vari-
ant of Tanaka and Umemura’s method where they
used one time inverse consultation to create a Ko-
rean to Japanese dictionary. Here, the degree of
similarity for the translation candidates was cal-
culated using the Dice coefficient for the two sets
of words in the intermediate language. One of
the sets consisted of the translations of the source
word from Korean to English and the other set
consisted of translations back from the Japanese
candidate to English.

Bond and Ogura (2008) combined several of the
above methods when creating a Japanese-Malay
dictionary. They also used matching of part-of-
speech in the generation of translation candidates.
Pairs were only accepted if they had the same part-
of-speech which, according to Bond and Ogura,
gave a marked reduction of false translations. It
lowered the number of translation candidates with
15 %, out of which the majority of the candidates
were wrong.

For Swedish, similar work on automated gen-
eration of bilingual dictionaries have been made
by Sjöbergh (2005). This approach differed from
earlier work by using a measure similar to inverse
document frequency, and by allowing a source lan-
guage word to be translated by a combination of
two target language words.

Sjöbergh finally suggested an improvement in
the method by examining the part-of-speech on the
suggested translation candidate, to primarily dis-
tinguish between nouns and verbs. This was some-
thing which, according to Sjöbergh, gave rise to a
number of erroneous suggestions for translations.
Khanaraksombat and Sjöbergh (2007) used the
same method as Sjöbergh (2005) with only a few
small changes, including part-of-speech match-
ing. However, many of the words had no part-of-
speech marked, and they do not report on how the
part-of-speech matching affected the results.

3 Problem

In aforementioned works the most common type
of problems in automatic generation of bilingual
dictionary with a pivot language are due to lex-
ical ambiguity. Examples of different forms of
lexical ambiguity are internal and external homo-
graphs and ambiguity in part-of-speech, referred
to as polysemy.

Part-of-speech matching has previously been
suggested as a possible improvement of the
method. Zhang et al. (2007), Khanaraksombat and
Sjöbergh (2007) as well as Bond and Ogura (2008)
have used part-of-speech matching with positive
results. However, it has not been investigated fully
with Swedish as one of the included languages,
probably due to the absence of a dictionary in
which all entries have been marked with the part-
of-speech. Since the data sources used here have
all entries marked with the part-of-speech, match-
ing will be performed on all the suggestions of the
translation candidates in this work.

4 Method

This survey has been carried out with Japanese as
source language, English as intermediate (pivot)
language and Swedish as target language. The
Japanese WordNet (Isahara et al., 2008) and the
People’s English-Swedish dictionary (Kann and
Hollman, 2011) are used for Japanese-English and
English-Swedish translation, respectively. These
were selected since they are the largest available
dictionaries for the languages involved that also
have all entries marked with part-of-speech, and
that are available in digital format for free down-
load and use. Since the lexicons use different no-
tations for part-of-speech, e.g. the Japanese Word-
Net uses the abbreviation ”nn” for nouns while the
People’s English-Swedish dictionary uses ”n” for
nouns, a mapping was done to a common part-
of-speech notation for easier comparison in later
stages.

4.1 Translation Candidate Generation

The method for generating translation candidates
from Japanese to Swedish is based on the method
by Tanaka and Umemura (1994) with a pivot lan-
guage. Two sets of translation candidates were
generated, one with part-of-speech matching and
the other without.

Meta code to generate Japanese-Swedish trans-
lation candidates:

1. For each Japanese word in the Japanese
WordNet, look up its English translations.

2. For each English translation, look up its
Swedish translations in the People’s lexicon.

3. For each Swedish translation, if it exists:

(a) Perform part-of-speech filtering, that is
compare part-of-speech in the Japanese
and Swedish dictionaries and save as fil-
tered translation candidate only if both
words have the same part-of-speech.

(b) Do not perform part-of-speech filtering,
save as unfiltered translation candidate
and continue with next.

This method differs from previous work in the
same area by using part-of-speech filtering on all
translation candidates, thus thoroughly examining
the impact of the part-of-speech filtering step.

4.2 Translation Candidate Scoring
The method of scoring the automatically gener-
ated translation candidates is based on the method
by Tanaka and Umemura (1994): one time inverse
consultation. This method has been used suc-
cessfully in a number of other works (Shirai and
Yamamoto, 2001; Zhang et al., 2007; Bond and
Ogura, 2008; Sjöbergh, 2005). One time inverse
consultation requires an additional data source: a
bilingual dictionary from the target language back
to the intermediate language. For this the People’s
Swedish-English dictionary with 22 014 Swedish
dictionary words has been used.

One time inverse consultation is carried out ac-
cording to the following steps.

1. For each translation candidate, translate the
word in the target language back to the inter-
mediate language.

2. Translate the word in the source language
into the intermediate language.

3. Count how many common translations there
are in the intermediate language.

The more matches, the better translation can-
didate. To calculate the score for the proposal
the formula from Shirai and Yamamoto (2001) is
used. Points p for a translation candidate w are
then, here, calculated using the following general-
ized formula, where s denotes the source language
(in this case Japanese), t denotes the target lan-
guage (here Swedish) and i denotes the intermedi-
ate language (here English).

p(w) = 2 ∗ Common translations
Translationss→i + Translationst→i

The resulting p(w) shows on a scale from 0 to
1 how good the proposed translation is, with 1 as
the highest score.

Additional calculations of how good the trans-
lation candidate is can be done. Other meth-
ods are Sjöbergh’s (2005) inverse document fre-
quency, and Varga and Yokoyama’s (2007) lexico-
logical checks in WordNet or Bond and Ogura’s
(2008) matching through a second intermediate
language. None of these methods have been used
since they were not considered essential for the
study of how part-of-speech filtering affects the
outcome. One scoring is enough to show any dif-
ferences in the quality of the resulting lexicon.
Shirai and Yamamoto’s method is also well proven
(Zhang et al., 2007; Bond and Ogura, 2008).

4.3 Data

The People’s English-Swedish dictionary (version
1.1) currently contains 46 762 English entries,
which are carefully grouped by part-of-speech.
The People’s English-Swedish dictionary is freely
available for use and download in XML format un-
der the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike
2.5 Generic license.1 The Swedish-English part
of the People’s dictionary (version 2009-07-08)
contains 22 014 Swedish entries. It has a simi-
lar breakdown of the part-of-speech groups as the
English-Swedish part of the lexicon. It is, how-
ever, not yet available for free download.

The Japanese WordNet (version 0.92) is a se-
mantic lexicon of the Japanese language. It is
produced by the National Institute of Information
and Communications Technology (NICT) in Japan
and contains 87 133 unique Japanese entries with
translations into English. All entries are marked
by one of the following parts-of-speech: noun,
verb, adjective or adverb. Bond and Ogura (2008)
claim that they have reached a WordNet with
reasonable coverage of most common Japanese
words. They finish, however, with a caveat that
5 % of the lexicon’s entries may contain errors,
but that this is something they intend to correct
manually while working with future versions. The
Japanese WordNet is freely available for use, re-
production and distribution, and is available for
download as an SQLite database.2

5 Evaluation

Precision and recall are the most common mea-
sures in evaluating the quality of automat-
ically generated glossaries and variations of
these have been used by Hara et al. (2008),
Varga and Yokoyama (2007), Bond and Ogura
(2008), Sjöbergh (2005) and Khanaraksombat and
Sjöbergh (2007).

Precision is a measure used to evaluate systems
for information retrieval and is defined as the pro-
portion of retrieved relevant answers. The rele-
vant answers in this case are all the suggestions
for translations that are correct. Thus, the accuracy
is the percentage of correct translation candidates
compared to all translation candidates.

What is most interesting for this work, however,
is the difference in quality of dictionaries pro-

duced without part-of-speech filtering compared
to the lexicon produced using part-of-speech fil-
tering. The precision p of a word w is calculated
by the following formula:

p(w) =
Correct translation candidates

All translation candidates

Accuracy is calculated by performing a sam-
ple survey. In addition, a stratified sample was
made based on the translation candidate’s score—
calculated using Tanaka and Umemura’s one time
inverse consultation—to get an idea of whether
the precision varies with the score of the trans-
lation candidate. This also shows what threshold
could be appropriate to use when presenting re-
sults to users of the lexicon. The translation can-
didates were divided into 10 strata, from 0.0 to
1.0 points, where each stratum corresponds to 0.1
points. From each stratum a random sample of 100
words was then drawn by systematic sampling,
that is every n suggested translation was chosen,
where n is calculated by all units in the population
divided by the size of the sample.

To determine whether a translation candidate
is relevant, that is correctly translated, you can
use native speakers of both source and target lan-
guages and have them manually correct the trans-
lations. This method has been successfully used
by Khanaraksombat and Sjöbergh (2007). Since
access to such persons was missing, the samples
were instead evaluated by manually checking the
English translations of the translation candidate
and whether the English translation is consistent
with its proposed Swedish translation. Manually
performing an exhaustive survey of this kind is not
reasonable, so a sample survey was carried out in-
stead. This method has been used successfully by
Sjöbergh (2005).

Recall is another commonly used measure in
the evaluation of systems for information retrieval.
When evaluating an automatically generated dic-
tionary, it is not reasonable to check all transla-
tion candidates. Instead one can compare with a
baseline set to a selection of entries from a printed
manually constructed lexicon in which all words
are assumed to be correctly translated. Recall is,
then, calculated as follows:

r(w) =
Correct part-of-speech filtered candidates

Correct baseline translation candidates

For this work, however, it is more interesting
to examine the coverage of the method relative to

earlier methods. Therefore the correct translation
candidates produced without part-of-speech filter-
ing was set as the baseline. It was then examined
whether the translations were among the proposals
of translations produced with part-of-speech filter-
ing. Thus a measure of the method’s recall relative
to the baseline method is calculated, which shows
to what extent the method using part-of-speech fil-
tering catches all the correct translations generated
by the method not using part-of-speech filtering.

6 Results

Table 1 shows the number of translation candi-
dates generated for various points in each range,
with and without the use of part-of-speech filter-
ing, as well as the difference in the number of
translation candidates created using each method.
By using part-of-speech filtering the total num-
ber of translation candidates created decreased
by 578 387 words, or 33.04 %. The reduction
of translation candidates varies depending on the
score and range from 9.43 % to 34.73 %, with a
tendency of more translation candidates with dif-
ferent parts-of-speech in target and source lan-
guage in the lower scoring ranges. This is proba-
bly because most of the translation candidates with
different parts-of-speech are wrong, partly filtered
out by the one time inverse consultation.

A large part of the translation candidates have
not received any score at all. This applies to
1 341 391 translation candidates generated with-
out part-of-speech filtering and 875 527 for those
with part-of-speech filtering. This is mainly be-
cause the Swedish entries were missing in the Peo-
ple’s Swedish-English dictionary, which has rela-
tively few Swedish dictionary entries, and no look-
up means zero score. This has the effect that
the generated Japanese-Swedish lexicon contains
fewer good words and translations. This can hope-
fully be addressed if more extensive versions of
the People’s Swedish-English Dictionary are re-
leased, rendering more Swedish entries available.

Most interesting for this paper is the difference

in quality between the two generated lexicons.
Figure 1 illustrates the difference in the quality
of translation candidates (y-axis) generated with-
out part-of-speech filtering compared to transla-
tion candidates generated with part-of-speech fil-
tering. Quality is the precision, that is the number
of correctly translated translation candidates com-
pared to all translation candidates, divided into
strata (x-axis) based on the translation candidate’s
score to illustrate how the precision varies with the
score.

filtering than without for all tested strata. Each
examined stratum has a sample size of 100 words.
We also see a positive correlation (r = 0.77 without
part-of-speech filtering, r = 0.62 with) that high
values on the translation candidate’s score corre-
spond to high values for precision and that a low
score equals low precision. All examined transla-
tion candidates where source and target languages
are of different part-of-speech have been found in-
correct.

Figure 1 also shows the threshold that is ap-
propriate to use when presenting results to users.
If you want a dictionary of good quality, you
might choose precision 0.9 as threshold, which
corresponds to a score of >0.7 with translation
candidates generated without part-of-speech filter-
ing, while you can go down to a score of >0.2

with translation candidates generated with part-of-
speech filtering. This would provide a dictionary
with a maximum of 10 % false translation candi-
dates, and with 143 743 translation candidates of
40 716 unique Japanese entries with an average of
3.5 candidates per entry. Without part-of-speech
filtering a dictionary of comparable quality would
only contain 7 919 translation candidates of 5 244
unique Japanese entries with an average of 1.5
candidates per entry. Summarized there is a ratio
of 20 between the two configurations.

Because of declining precision, no translation
candidates with a precision below 0.1 have been
checked. A too poor precision is not interesting,
therefore the manual survey was terminated before
all translation candidates were checked.

Review of data from Table 2 also showed a pos-
itive correlation between proposal precision and
the percentage of translation candidates that had
the same part-of-speech in both source and target
language (r = 0.99). This applies for all inves-
tigated strata, where each sample stratum is 100
words.

To illustrate this more clearly, the two graphs
are overlaid on each other in Figure 2. The
dashed curve is from Figure 1 and shows the qual-
ity, i.e. precision, of translation candidates (y-axis)
generated without part-of-speech filtering. The
solid curve shows the percentage of the checked
translation candidates that have the same part-of-
speech in both source and target language. The
proportion of such proposals (y-axis) are shown
for each stratum (x-axis).

Figure 2: Precision of translation candidates gen-
erated without part-of-speech filtering and the pro-
portion of these with same part of speech.

The positive correlation between the percentage
of translation candidates with same part-of-speech
and the candidate’s accuracy may also explain the
irregular jagged curve, since the random sample
selected by systematic sampling appears to have
an uneven distribution of proposals with differ-
ent parts-of-speech. A better idea might be to en-
sure that each stratum has the same proportion of
translation candidates with and without the same
part-of-speech as is the case in the complete pop-
ulation. For example the score range 0.9 < p <
1.0 had 21 % words with different parts-of-speech,
which should then also be the case in the sample.

A review of the translation candidates that were
filtered away, i.e. the candidates that have different
parts-of-speech in the source and target languages,
showed that they were all wrong. This also sug-
gests that the more candidates that have different
parts-of-speech in the source and target languages,
the lower the precision of the generated dictionary.

Recall has been calculated for all investigated
strata. The correct translation candidates gener-
ated without part-of-speech filtering have been set
as the baseline, then it was checked whether they
were among the translation candidates generated
with part-of-speech filtering. All the evaluated
candidates were included. This shows that the re-
call of the method is 100 % relative to the baseline
method, that is, all correctly translated translation
candidates produced without part-of-speech filter-
ing were among the candidates generated with
part-of-speech filtering.

7 Discussion

The most common cause of erroneous sugges-
tions for translations were lexical ambiguity and
specifically due to homographs. This problem has
been effectively reduced by using part-of-speech
filtering of the translation candidates. The second
most common cause is ambiguity within the same
part-of-speech. These may be filtered by inverse
consultation, but not always, which then requires
manual checking afterwards.

Another problem is the different categorizations
of part-of-speech in the different dictionaries. An
example found when searching the database for
translation candidates with another part-of-speech
than the original word is the following: The
Japanese character for one (1) is categorized by
the Japanese WordNet as a noun, while the Peo-
ple’s English-Swedish dictionary categorized the
Swedish translation as a cardinal numeral. This
appears to be due to differences in the languages,
where the Japanese language categorizes numer-
als as nouns. By part-of-speech filtering this cor-
rect translation candidate was errornously purged.
However, no such entries were discovered in the
systematic sample evaluation of the translation
candidates, which implies that they are rather un-
common in this language combination.

One problem with using English as the inter-
mediate language is the difference between British
and American English. During the manual evalu-
ation it was found that the Japanese WordNet had
both British and American spelling of some En-
glish translations. One way to solve this, which
has been tried by Bond and Ogura (2008), is to
use some sort of British / American English dic-
tionary for finding alternate spellings, if you can
not find a direct translation.

8 Conclusion

The purpose of this study was to examine the im-
pact of part-of-speech filtering on automatic gen-
eration of a bilingual dictionary by means of a
pivot language. For this purpose two Japanese-
Swedish lexicons were created, one without part-
of-speech filtering and the other with part-of-
speech filtering.

A comparison of these two dictionaries showed
that the method with part-of-speech filtering gave
33 % fewer translation candidates. The manual
evaluation of the quality of the candidates showed
a higher precision of the candidates generated with

part-of-speech filtering for all investigated strata.
The results also showed a positive correlation (r
= 0.99) between the percentage of translation can-
didates that have the same part-of-speech in both
source and target language and proposal precision.
Method recall is 100 %, according to the system-
atic manual evaluation, but later searches in the
database uncovered that certain types of words still
can be filtered out incorrectly, for example, numer-
als which appear to have different parts-of-speech
in Japanese and Swedish.

From these results it is concluded that part-of-
speech filtering is a useful method that reduces
the number of erroneous suggestions for transla-
tions, at least for the current language of the trio
(Japanese, English and Swedish). Part-of-speech
filtering effectively eliminates problems stemming
from external homographs in the intermediate lan-
guage. Given the data, it is a simple step to add to
the automatic generation of suggestions for trans-
lations, resulting in clear improvements.

As a result of the study 143 743 Japanese-
Swedish translation candidates were created for
40 716 unique Japanese entries. Through using
the precision curve in Figure 1, a precision of
0.9 was suggested as an appropriate threshold,
which corresponds to >0.2 in score for transla-
tion candidates generated with part-of-speech fil-
tering. These candidates have an estimated 10 %
false translations, therefore it is important to con-
clude by pointing out that methods to automati-
cally generate bilingual dictionaries are not per-
fect. They are great as preliminary and highly
time-saving work, which should be followed by
manual checks and cleaning of the resulting ma-
terial. The result is also largely dependent on the
source material used for one time inverse consul-
tation to work properly.

The resulting Japanese-Swedish lexicon and the
