Abstract

We study the problem of agreement and
disagreement detection in online discus-
sions. An isotonic Conditional Random
Fields (isotonic CRF) based sequential
model is proposed to make predictions
on sentence- or segment-level. We auto-
matically construct a socially-tuned lex-
icon that is bootstrapped from existing
general-purpose sentiment lexicons to fur-
ther improve the performance. We eval-
uate our agreement and disagreement tag-
ging model on two disparate online discus-
sion corpora – Wikipedia Talk pages and
online debates. Our model is shown to
outperform the state-of-the-art approaches
in both datasets. For example, the iso-
tonic CRF model achieves F1 scores of
0.74 and 0.67 for agreement and disagree-
ment detection, when a linear chain CRF
obtains 0.58 and 0.56 for the discussions
on Wikipedia Talk pages.

1 Introduction

We are in an era where people can easily voice and
exchange their opinions on the internet through
forums or social media. Mining public opinion
and the social interactions from online discus-
sions is an important task, which has a wide range
of applications. For example, by analyzing the
users’ attitude in forum posts on social and po-
litical problems, it is able to identify ideological
stance (Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009) and user
relations (Qiu et al., 2013), and thus further dis-
cover subgroups (Hassan et al., 2012; Abu-Jbara
et al., 2012) with similar ideological viewpoint.
Meanwhile, catching the sentiment in the conver-
sation can help detect online disputes, reveal popu-
lar or controversial topics, and potentially disclose
the public opinion formation process.

In this work, we study the problem of agreement
and disagreement identification in online discus-
sions. Sentence-level agreement and disagreement
detection for this domain is challenging in its own
right due to the dynamic nature of online conversa-
tions, and the less formal, and usually very emo-
tional language used. As an example, consider a
snippet of discussion from Wikipedia Talk page
for article “Iraq War” where editors argue on the
correctness of the information in the opening para-
graph (Figure 1). “So what?” should presumably
be tagged as a negative sentence as should the sen-
tence “If you’re going to troll, do us all a favor
and stick to the guidelines.”. We hypothesize that
these, and other, examples will be difficult for the
tagger unless the context surrounding each sen-
tence is considered and in the absence of a sen-
timent lexicon tuned for conversational text (Ding
et al., 2008; Choi and Cardie, 2009).

As a result, we investigate isotonic Condi-
tional Random Fields (isotonic CRF) (Mao and
Lebanon, 2007) for the sentiment tagging task
since they preserve the advantages of the popu-
lar CRF sequential tagging models (Lafferty et
al., 2001) while providing an efficient mechanism
to encode domain knowledge — in our case, a
sentiment lexicon — through isotonic constraints
on the model parameters. In particular, we boot-
strap the construction of a sentiment lexicon from
Wikipedia talk pages using the lexical items in ex-
isting general-purpose sentiment lexicons as seeds
and in conjunction with an existing label propaga-
tion algorithm (Zhu and Ghahramani, 2002).1

To summarize, our chief contributions include:
(1) We propose an agreement and disagree-

ment identification model based on isotonic Con-
ditional Random Fields (Mao and Lebanon, 2007)
to identify users’ attitude in online discussion.
Our predictions that are made on the sentence-

1Our online discussion lexicon (Section 4) will be made
publicly available.

Zer0faults: So questions comments feedback welcome.
Other views etc. I just hope we can remove the assertations
that WMD’s were in fact the sole reason for the US invasion,
considering that HJ Res 114 covers many many reasons.
>Mr. Tibbs: So basically what you want to do is remove all
mention of the cassus belli of the Iraq War and try to create
the false impression that this military action was as inevitable
as the sunrise.[NN ] No. Just because things didn’t turn out the
way the Bush administration wanted doesn’t give you license
to rewrite history.[NN ] ...
>>MONGO: Regardless, the article is an antiwar propa-
ganda tool.[NN ] ...
>>>Mr. Tibbs: So what?[NN ] That wasn’t the cassus
belli and trying to give that impression After the Fact is
Untrue.[NN ] Hell, the reason it wasn’t the cassus belli is be-
cause there are dictators in Africa that make Saddam look like
a pussycat...
>>Haizum: Start using the proper format or it’s over for your
comments.[N ] If you’re going to troll, do us all a favor and
stick to the guidelines.[N ] ...
Tmorton166: Hi, I wonder if, as an outsider to this debate I
can put my word in here. I considered mediating this discus-
sion however I’d prefer just to comment and leave it at that :).
I agree mostly with what Zer0faults is saying[PP ]. ...
>Mr. Tibbs: Here’s the problem with that.[NN ] It’s not about
publicity or press coverage. It’s about the fact that the Iraq
disarmament crisis set off the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. ... And
theres a huge problem with rewriting the intro as if the Iraq
disarmament crisis never happened.[NN ]
>>Tmorton166: ... To suggest in the opening paragraph that
the ONLY reason for the war was WMD’s is wrong - because
it simply isn’t.[NN ] However I agree that the emphasis needs
to be on the armaments crisis because it was the reason sold
to the public and the major one used to justify the invasion but
it needs to acknowledge that there was at least 12 reasons for
the war as well.[PP ] ...

Figure 1: Example discussion from wikipedia talk page
for article “Iraq War”, where editors discuss about the cor-
rectness of the information in the opening paragraph. We
only show some sentences that are relevant for demonstra-
tion. Other sentences are omitted by ellipsis. Names of ed-
itors are in bold. “>” is an indicator for the reply structure,
where turns starting with > are response for most previous
turn that with one less >. We use “NN”, “N”, and “PP” to in-
dicate “strongly disagree”, “disagree”, and “strongly agree”.

detect by an existing lexicon.

or segment-level, are able to discover fine-grained
sentiment flow within each turn, which can be fur-
ther applied in other applications, such as dispute
detection or argumentation structure analysis. We
employ two existing online discussion data sets:
the Authority and Alignment in Wikipedia Dis-
cussions (AAWD) corpus of Bender et al. (2011)
(Wikipedia talk pages) and the Internet Argu-
ment Corpus (IAC) of Walker et al. (2012a). Ex-
perimental results show that our model signifi-
cantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the
AAWD data (our F1 scores are 0.74 and 0.67 for
agreement and disagreement, vs. 0.58 and 0.56 for
the linear chain CRF approach) and IAC data (our
F1 scores are 0.61 and 0.78 for agreement and dis-

agreement, vs. 0.28 and 0.73 for SVM).
(2) Furthermore, we construct a new senti-

ment lexicon for online discussion. We show
that the learned lexicon significantly improves per-
formance over systems that use existing general-
purpose lexicons (i.e. MPQA lexicon (Wilson et
al., 2005), General Inquirer (Stone et al., 1966),
and SentiWordNet (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006)).
Our lexicon is constructed from a very large-scale
discussion corpus based on Wikipedia talk page,
where previous work (Somasundaran and Wiebe,
2010) for constructing online discussion lexicon
relies on human annotations derived from limited
number of conversations.

In the remainder of the paper, we describe first
the related work (Section 2). Then we intro-
duce the sentence-level agreement and disagree-
ment identification model (Section 3) as well as
the label propagation algorithm for lexicon con-
struction (Section 4). After explain the experimen-
tal setup, we display the results and provide further
analysis in Section 6.

2 Related Work

Sentiment analysis has been utilized as a key en-
abling technique in a number of conversation-
based applications. Previous work mainly stud-
ies the attitudes in spoken meetings (Galley et al.,
2004; Hahn et al., 2006) or broadcast conversa-
tions (Wang et al., 2011) using Conditional Ran-
dom Fields (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001). Galley
et al. (2004) employ Conditional Markov models
to detect if discussants reach at an agreement in
spoken meetings. Each state in their model is an
individual turn and prediction is made on the turn-
level. In the same spirit, Wang et al. (2011) also
propose a sequential model based on CRF for de-
tecting agreements and disagreements in broadcast
conversations, where they primarily show the ef-
ficiency of prosodic features. While we also ex-
ploit a sequential model extended from CRFs, our
predictions are made for each sentence or segment
rather than at the turn-level. Moreover, we experi-
ment with online discussion datasets that exhibit
a more realistic distribution of disagreement vs.
agreement, where much more disagreement is ob-
served due to its function and the relation between
the participants. This renders the detection prob-
lem more challenging.

Only recently, agreement and disagreement de-
tection is studied for online discussion, especially

98



for online debate. Abbott et al. (2011) investi-
gate different types of features based on depen-
dency relations as well as manually-labeled fea-
tures, such as if the participants are nice, nasty,
or sarcastic, and respect or insult the target par-
ticipants. Automatically inducing those features
from human annotation are challenging itself, so
it would be difficult to reproduce their work on
new datasets. We use only automatically gener-
ated features. Using the same dataset, Misra and
Walker (2013) study the effectiveness of topic-
independent features, e.g. discourse cues indicat-
ing agreement or negative opinion. Those cues,
which serve a similar purpose as a sentiment lex-
icon, are also constructed manually. In our work,
we create an online discussion lexicon automat-
ically and construct sentiment features based on
the lexicon. Also targeting online debate, Yin et
al. (2012) train a logistic regression classifier with
features aggregating posts from the same partici-
pant to predict the sentiment for each individual
post. This approach works only when the speaker
has enough posts on each topic, which is not ap-
plicable to newcomers. Hassan et al. (2010) focus
on predicting the attitude of participants towards
each other. They relate the sentiment words to
the second person pronoun, which produces strong
baselines. We also adopt their baselines in our
work. Although there are available datasets with
(dis)agreement annotated on Wikipedia talk pages,
we are not aware of any published work that uti-
lizes these annotations. Dialogue act recognition
on talk pages (Ferschke et al., 2012) might be the
most related.

While detecting agreement and disagreement in
conversations is useful on its own, it is also a key
component for related tasks, such as stance pre-
diction (Thomas et al., 2006; Somasundaran and
Wiebe, 2009; Walker et al., 2012b) and subgroup
detection (Hassan et al., 2012; Abu-Jbara et al.,
2012). For instance, Thomas et al. (2006) train an
agreement detection classifier with Support Vec-
tor Machines on congressional floor-debate tran-
scripts to determine whether the speeches repre-
sent support of or opposition to the proposed leg-
islation. Somasundaran and Wiebe (2009) design
various sentiment constraints for inclusion in an
integer linear programming framework for stance
classification. For subgroup detection, Abu-Jbara
et al. (2012) uses the polarity of the expressions in
the discussions and partition discussants into sub-

groups based on the intuition that people in the
same group should mostly agree with each other.
Though those work highly relies on the compo-
nent of agreement and disagreement detection, the
evaluation is always performed on the ultimate ap-
plication only.

3 The Model

We first give a brief overview on isotonic Con-
ditional Random Fields (isotonic CRF) (Mao and
Lebanon, 2007), which is used as the backbone
approach for our sentence- or segment-level agree-
ment and disagreement detection model. We defer
the explanation of online discussion lexicon con-
struction in Section 4.

3.1 Problem Description
Consider a discussion comprised of sequential
turns uttered by the participants; each turn con-
sists of a sequence of text units, where each unit
can be a sentence or a segment of several sen-
tences. Our model takes as input the text units
x = {x1, · · · , xn} in the same turn, and outputs
a sequence of sentiment labels y = {y1, · · · , yn},
where yi ∈ O,O = {NN,N,O,P,PP}. The la-
bels in O represent strongly disagree (NN), dis-
agree (N), neutral (O), agree (P), strongly agree
(PP), respectively. In addition, elements in the
partially ordered set O possess an ordinal relation
≤. Here, we differentiate agreement and disagree-
ment with different intensity, because the output
of our classifier can be used for other applications,
such as dispute detection, where “strongly dis-
agree” (e.g. NN) plays an important role. Mean-
while, fine-grained sentiment labels potentially
provide richer context information for the sequen-
tial model employed for this task.

3.2 Isotonic Conditional Random Fields
Conditional Random Fields (CRF) have been suc-
cessfully applied in numerous sequential labeling
tasks (Lafferty et al., 2001). Given a sequence
of utterances or segments x = {x1, · · · , xn}, ac-
cording to linear-chain CRF, the probability of the
labels y for x is given by:

p(y|x) = 1
Z(x)

exp(
∑
i

∑
σ,τ

λ〈σ,τ〉f〈σ,τ〉(yi−1, yi)

+
∑
i

∑
σ,w

µ〈σ,w〉g〈σ,w〉(yi, xi))

(1)

99



f〈σ,τ〉(yi−1, yi) and g〈σ,w〉(yi, xi) are feature
functions. Given that yi−1, yi, xi take values of
σ, τ, w, the functions are indexed by pairs 〈σ, τ〉
and 〈σ,w〉. λ〈σ,τ〉, µ〈σ,w〉 are the parameters.

CRF, as defined above, is not appropriate for or-
dinal data like sentiment, because it ignores the
ordinal relation among sentiment labels. Isotonic
Conditional Random Fields (isotonic CRF) are
proposed by Mao and Lebanon (2007) to enforce a
set of monotonicity constraints on the parameters
that are consistent with the ordinal structure and
domain knowledge (in our case, a sentiment lexi-
con automatically constructed from online discus-
sions).

Given a lexiconM = Mp ∪Mn, whereMp
and Mn are two sets of features (usually words)
identified as strongly associated with positive sen-
timent and negative sentiment. The constraints are
encoded as below. For each feature w ∈ Mp, iso-
tonic CRF enforces σ ≤ σ′ ⇒ µ〈σ,w〉 ≤ µ〈σ′,w〉.
Intuitively, the parameters µ〈σ,w〉 are intimately
tied to the model probabilities. When a feature
such as “totally agree” is observed in the training
data, the feature parameter for µ〈PP,totally agree〉 is
likely to increase. Similar constraints are also de-
fined onMn. In this work, we boostrap the con-
struction of an online discussion sentiment lexicon
used asM in the isotonic CRF (see Section 4).

The parameters can be found by maximizing the
likelihood subject to the monotonicity constraints.
We adopt the re-parameterization from Mao and
Lebanon (2007) for a simpler optimization prob-
lem, and refer the readers to Mao and Lebanon
(2007) for more details.2

3.3 Features

The features used in sentiment prediction are listed
in Table 1. Features with numerical values are first
normalized by standardization, then binned into 5
categories.

Syntactic/Semantic Features. Dependency re-
lations have been shown to be effective for various
sentiment prediction tasks (Joshi and Penstein-
Rosé, 2009; Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009;
Hassan et al., 2010; Abu-Jbara et al., 2012). We
have two versions of dependency relation as fea-
tures, one being the original form, another gen-

2The full implementation is based on MALLET (McCal-
lum, 2002). We thank Yi Mao for sharing the implementation
of the core learning algorithm.

Lexical Features
- unigram/bigram
- num of words all uppercased
- num of words
Discourse Features
- initial uni-/bi-/trigram
- repeated punctuations
- hedging (Farkas et al., 2010)
- number of negators
Syntactic/Semantic Features
- unigram with POS tag
- dependency relation
Conversation Features
- quote overlap with target
- TFIDF similarity with target (remove quote first)
Sentiment Features
- connective + sentiment words
- sentiment dependency relation
- sentiment words

eralizing a word to its POS tag in turn. For in-
stance, “nsubj(wrong, you)” is generlized as the
“nsubj(ADJ, you)” and “nsubj(wrong, PRP)”. We
use Stanford parser (de Marneffe et al., 2006) to
obtain parse trees and dependency relations.

Discourse Features. Previous work (Hirschberg
and Litman, 1993; Abbott et al., 2011) suggests
that discourse markers, such as what?, actually,
may have their use for expressing opinions. We
extract the initial unigram, bigram, and trigram of
each utterance as discourse features (Hirschberg
and Litman, 1993). Hedge words are collected
from the CoNLL-2012 shared task (Farkas et al.,
2010).

Conversation Features. Conversation features
encode some useful information regarding the
similarity between the current utterance(s) and the
sentences uttered by the target participant. TFIDF
similarity is computed. We also check if the cur-
rent utterance(s) quotes target sentences and com-
pute its length.

Sentiment Features. We gather connectives
from Penn Discourse TreeBank (Rashmi Prasad
and Webber, 2008) and combine them with any
sentiment word that precedes or follows it as
new features. Sentiment dependency relations are
the subset of dependency relations with sentiment
words. We replace those words with their polarity
equivalents. For example, relation “nsubj(wrong,
you)” becomes “nsubj(SentiWordneg, you)”.

that do not contain any seed word.

4 Online Discussion Sentiment Lexicon
Construction

So far as we know, there is no lexicon available
for online discussions. Thus, we create from a
large-scale corpus via label propagation. The la-
bel propagation algorithm, proposed by Zhu and
Ghahramani (2002), is a semi-supervised learning
method. In general, it takes as input a set of seed
samples (e.g. sentiment words in our case), and
the similarity between pairwise samples, then it-
eratively assigns values to the unlabeled samples
(see Algorithm 1). The construction of graph G is
discussed in Section 4.1. Sample sentiment words
in the new lexicon are listed in Table 2.

Input : G = (V,E), wij ∈ [0, 1], positive
seed words P , negative seed words
N , number of iterations T

Output: {yi}|V |−1i=0
yi = 1.0, ∀vi ∈ P

yi = −1.0, ∀vi ∈ N

end
Algorithm 1: The label propagation algo-
rithm (Zhu and Ghahramani, 2002) used for
constructing online discussion lexicon.

4.1 Graph Construction
Node Set V . Traditional lexicons, like General
Inquirer (Stone et al., 1966), usually consist of po-
larized unigrams. As we mentioned in Section 1,
unigrams lack the capability of capturing the sen-
timent conveyed in online discussions. Instead,
bigrams, dependency relations, and even punctu-
ation can serve as supplement to the unigrams.
Therefore, we consider four types of text units as
nodes in the graph: unigrams, bigrams, depen-
dency relations, sentiment dependency relations.
Sentiment dependency relations are described in
Section 3.3. We replace all relation names with a
general label. Text units that appear in at least 10
discussions are retained as nodes to reduce noise.

Edge Set E. As Velikovich et al. (2010) and
Feng et al. (2013) notice, a dense graph with a
large number of nodes is susceptible to propagat-
ing noise, and will not scale well. We thus adopt
the algorithm in Feng et al. (2013) to construct
a sparsely connected graph. For each text unit t,
we first compute its representation vector ~a using
Pairwise Mutual Information scores with respect
to the top 50 co-occuring text units. We define
“co-occur” as text units appearing in the same sen-
tence. An edge is created between two text units
t0 and t1 only if they ever co-occur. The similar-
ity between t0 and t1 is calculated as the Cosine
similarity between ~a0 and ~a1.

Seed Words. The seed sentiment are collected
from three existing lexicons: MPQA lexicon, Gen-
eral Inquirer, and SentiWordNet. Each word in
SentiWordNet is associated with a positive score
and a negative score; words with a polarity score

101



larger than 0.7 are retained. We remove words
with conflicting sentiments.

4.2 Data

The graph is constructed based on Wikipedia talk
pages. We download the 2013-03-04 Wikipedia
data dump, which contains 4,412,582 talk pages.
Since we are interested in conversational lan-
guages, we filter out talk pages with fewer than
5 participants. This results in a dataset of 20,884
talk pages, from which the graph is constructed.

5 Experimental Setup

5.1 Datasets

Wikipedia Talk pages. The first dataset we use
is Authority and Alignment in Wikipedia Dis-
cussions (AAWD) corpus (Bender et al., 2011).
AAWD consists of 221 English Wikipedia discus-
sions with agreement and disagreement annota-
tions.3

The annotation of AAWD is made at utterance-
or turn-level, where a turn is defined as continu-
ous body of text uttered by the same participant.
Annotators either label each utterance as agree-
ment, disagreement or neutral, and select the cor-
responding spans of text, or label the full turn.
Each turn is annotated by two or three people. To
induce an utterance-level label for instances that
have only a turn-level label, we assume they have
the same label as the turn.

To train our sentiment model, we further trans-
form agreement and disagreement labels (i.e. 3-
way) into the 5-way labels. For utterances that
are annotated as agreement and have the text
span specified by at least two annotators, they are
treated as “strongly agree” (PP). If an utterance is
only selected as agreement by one annotator or it
gets the label by turn-level annotation, it is “agree”
(P). “Strongly disagree” (NN) and “disagree” (N)
are collected in the same way from disagreement
label. All others are neutral (O). In total, we have
16,501 utterances. 1,930 and 1,102 utterances are
labeled as “NN” and “N”. 532 and 99 of them are
“PP” and “P”. All other 12,648 are neutral sam-
ples. 4

3Bender et al. (2011) originally use positive alignment
and negative alignment to indicate two types of social moves.
They define those alignment moves as “agreeing or disagree-
ing” with the target. We thus use agreement and disagreement
instead of positive and negative alignment in this work.

4345 samples with both positive and negative labels are
treated as neutral.

Online Debate. The second dataset is the Inter-
net Argument Corpus (IAC) (Walker et al., 2012a)
collected from an online debate forum. Each dis-
cussion in IAC consists of multiple posts, where
we treat each post as a turn. Most posts (72.3%)
contain quoted content from the posts they target
at or other resources. A post can have more than
one quote, which naturally break the post into mul-
tiple segments. 1,806 discussions are annotated
with agreement and disagreement on the segment-
level from -5 to 5, with -5 as strongly disagree and
5 as strongly agree. We first compute the average
score for each segment among different annotators
and transform the score into sentiment label in the
following way. We treat [−5,−3] as NN (1595
segments), (−3,−1] as N (4548 segments), [1, 3)
as P (911 samples), [3, 5] as PP (199), all others as
O (290 segments).

In the test phase, utterances or segments pre-
dicted with NN or N are treated as disagreement;
the ones predicted as PP or P are agreement; O is
neutral.

5.2 Comparison

We compare with two baselines. (1) Baseline (Po-
larity) is based on counting the sentiment words
from our lexicon. An utterance or segment is
predicted as agreement if it contains more posi-
tive words than negative words, or disagreement
if more negative words are observed. Other-
wise, it is neutral. (2) Baseline (Distance) is ex-
tended from (Hassan et al., 2010). Each sentiment
word is associated with the closest second per-
son pronoun, and a surface distance can be com-
puted between them. A classifier based on Sup-
port Vector Machines (Joachims, 1999) (SVM) is
trained with the features of sentiment words, min-
imum/maximum/average of the distances.

We also compare with two state-of-the-art
methods that are widely used in sentiment predic-
tion for conversations. The first one is an RBF
kernel SVM based approach, which has been used
for sentiment prediction (Hassan et al., 2010), and
(dis)agreement detection (Yin et al., 2012) in on-
line debates. The second is linear chain CRF,
which has been utilized for (dis)agreement iden-
tification in broadcast conversations (Wang et al.,
2011).

significantly higher than all the rest, and the italic entry has the highest absolute value. Our model based
on the isotonic CRF with the new lexicon produces significantly better results than all the other systems
for agreement and disagreement detection. Downsampling, however, is not always helpful.

6 Results

In this section, we first show the experimental re-
sults on sentence- and segment-level agreement
and disagreement detection in two types of online
discussions – Wikipedia Talk pages and online de-
bates. Then we provide more detailed analysis for
the features used in our model. Furthermore, we
discuss several types of errors made in the model.

6.1 Wikipedia Talk Pages

We evaluate the systems by standard F1 score on
each of the three categories: agreement, disagree-
ment, and neutral. For AAWD, we compute two
versions of F1 scores. Strict F1 is computed
against the true labels. For soft F1, if a sentence
is never labeled by any annotator on the sentence-
level and adopts its agreement/disagreement label
from the turn-level annotation, then it is treated as
a true positive when predicted as neutral.

Table 3 demonstrates our main results on the
Wikipedia Talk pages (AAWD dataset). With-
out downsampling, our isotonic CRF based sys-
tems with the new lexicon significantly outper-
form the compared approaches for agreement and
disagreement detection according to the paired-
t test (p < 0.05). We also perform downsam-
pling by removing the turns only containing neu-
tral utterances. However, it does not always help
with performance. We suspect that, with less neu-
tral samples in the training data, the classifier is
less likely to make neutral predictions, which thus
decreases true positive predictions. For strict F-
scores on agreement/disagreement, downsampling

ment detection on online debate (IAC). All the
numbers are multiplied by 100. In each column,
bold entries (if any) are statistically significantly
higher than all the rest, and the italic entry has the
highest absolute value except baselines. We have
two main observations: 1) Both of our models
based on isotonic CRF significantly outperform
other systems for agreement and disagreement de-
tection. 2) By adding the new lexicon, either as
features or constraints in isotonic CRF, all systems
achieve better F1 scores.

has mixed effect, but mostly we get slightly better
performance.

6.2 Online Debates
Similarly, F1 scores for agreement, disagreement
and neutral for online debates (IAC dataset) are
displayed in Table 4. Both of our systems based
on isotonic CRF achieve significantly better F1
scores than the comparison. Especially, our sys-
tem with the new lexicon produces the best results.
For SVM and linear-chain CRF based systems, we
also add new sentiment features constructed from
the new lexicon as described in Section 3.3. We

can see that those sentiment features also boost the
performance for both of the compared approaches.

6.3 Feature Evaluation
Moreover, we evaluate the effectiveness of fea-
tures by adding one type of features each time.
The results are listed in Table 5. As it can be seen,
the performance gets improved incrementally with
every new set of features.

We also utilize χ2-test to highlight some of
the salient features on the two datasets. We can
see from Table 6 that, for online debates (IAC),
some features are highly topic related, such as “the
male” or “the scientist”. This observation concurs
with the conclusion in Misra and Walker (2013)
that features with topic information are indicative
for agreement and disagreement detection.

Syntacitc/Semantic, Discourse, Conversation, and
Sentiment features) by using isotonic CRF. The
numbers in bold are statistically significantly
higher than the numbers above it (paired-t test,
p < 0.05).

6.4 Error Analysis
After a closer look at the data, we found two ma-
jor types of errors. Firstly, people express dis-
agreement not only by using opinionated words,
but also by providing contradictory example. This
needs a deeper understanding of the semantic in-
formation embedded in the text. Techniques like
textual entailment can be used in the further work.
Secondly, a sequence of sentences with sarcasm is
hard to detect. For instance, “Bravo, my friends!
Bravo! Goebbles would be proud of your abilities
to whitewash information.” We observe terms like
“Bravo”, “friends”, and “be proud of” that are in-
dicators for positive sentiment; however, they are

you), Rel (Sentimentpos, I), thanks, amod (idea,
good), nsubj(glad, I), good point, concur, happy

NEGATIVE: you, your, nsubj (negative, you),
numberOfNegator, don’t, nsubj (disagree, I),

ing, my), hellSentInitial, whateverSentInitial

in sarcastic tone. We believe a model that is able
to detect sarcasm would further improve the per-
formance.

7 Conclusion

We present an agreement and disagreement detec-
tion model based on isotonic CRFs that outputs
labels at the sentence- or segment-level. We boot-
strap the construction of a sentiment lexicon for
online discussions, encoding it in the form of do-
main knowledge for the isotonic CRF learner. Our
sentiment-tagging model is shown to outperform
the state-of-the-art approaches on both Wikipedia
Talk pages and online debates.
