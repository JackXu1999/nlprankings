Abstract

We share the findings of the first shared task on
improving robustness of Machine Translation
(MT). The task provides a testbed representing
challenges facing MT models deployed in the
real world, and facilitates new approaches to
improve models’ robustness to noisy input and
domain mismatch. We focus on two language
pairs (English-French and English-Japanese),
and the submitted systems are evaluated on
a blind test set consisting of noisy comments
on Reddit1 and professionally sourced transla-
tions. As a new task, we received 23 submis-
sions by 11 participating teams from universi-
ties, companies, national labs, etc. All submit-
ted systems achieved large improvements over
baselines, with the best improvement having
+22.33 BLEU. We evaluated submissions by
both human judgment and automatic evalua-
tion (BLEU), which shows high correlations
(Pearson’s r = 0.94 and 0.95). Furthermore,
we conducted a qualitative analysis of the sub-
mitted systems using compare-mt2, which
revealed their salient differences in handling
challenges in this task. Such analysis pro-
vides additional insights when there is occa-
sional disagreement between human judgment
and BLEU, e.g. systems better at producing
colloquial expressions received higher score
from human judgment.

1 Introduction

In recent years, Machine Translation (MT) sys-
tems have seen great progress, with neural mod-
els becoming the de-facto methods and even ap-
proaching human quality in news domain (Hassan
et al., 2018). However, like other deep learning
models, neural machine translation (NMT) models
are found to be sensitive to synthetic and natural
noise in input, distributional shift, and adversarial

examples (Koehn and Knowles, 2017; Belinkov
and Bisk, 2018; Durrani et al., 2019; Anastasopou-
los et al., 2019; Michel et al., 2019). From an
application perspective, MT systems need to deal
with non-standard, noisy text of the kind which is
ubiquitous on social media and the internet, yet
has different distributional signatures from cor-
pora in common benchmark datasets.

The goal of this shared task is to provide a
testbed for improving MT models’ robustness
to orthographic variations, grammatical errors,
and other linguistic phenomena common in user-
generated content, via better modelling, training,
adaptation techniques, or leveraging monolingual
training data. Specifically, the shared task aims to
bring improvements on the following challenges:

• To improve NMT’s robustness to ortho-
graphic variations, grammatical errors, infor-
mal language, and other linguistic phenom-
ena or noise common on social media.

• To explore effective approaches to leverage
abundant out-of-domain parallel data.

• To explore novel approaches to leverage
abundant monolingual data on the Web (e.g.,
tweets, Reddit comments, commoncrawl,
etc.).

• To thoroughly investigate and understand the
overall challenges in translating social me-
dia text and identify major themes of efforts
which needs more research from the commu-
nity.

In this first iteration, the shared-task used the
MTNT dataset (Michel and Neubig, 2018) that
contains noisy social media texts and their trans-
lations between English (Eng) and French (Fra)
and English and Japanese (Jpn), in four translation
directions: Eng→Fra, Fra→Eng, Eng→Jpn, and

Jpn→Eng. We describe the dataset and the task
setup in Section 3. The shared-task attracted a to-
tal of 23 submissions from 11 teams. The teams
employed a variety of methods to improve robust-
ness. A specific challenge was the small size of
the in-domain noisy parallel dataset. We summa-
rize the participating systems in Section 4 and the
notable methods in Section 5. The contributions
were evaluated both automatically and via a hu-
man evaluation. The results demonstrate a signifi-
cant progress of the state-of-the-art in MT robust-
ness, with multiple teams surpassing the shared-
task baseline by a large margin. These results are
discussed in Section 6.

We hope that this task leads to more efforts from
the community in building robust MT models.

2 Related Work

The fragility of neural networks (Szegedy et al.,
2013) has been shown to extend to neural machine
translation models (Belinkov and Bisk, 2018;
Heigold et al., 2017) and recent work focused on
various aspects of the problem. From the identi-
fication of the causes of this brittleness, to the in-
duction of (adversarial) inputs that trigger the un-
wanted behavior (attacks) and making such mod-
els robust against various types of noisy inputs
(defenses); improving robustness has been receiv-
ing increasing attention in NMT.

While Koehn and Knowles (2017) mentioned
domain mismatch as a challenge for neural ma-
chine translation, Khayrallah and Koehn (2018)
addressed noisy training data and focus on the
types of noise occurring in web-crawled corpora.
Michel and Neubig (2018) proposed a new dataset
(MTNT) to test MT models for robustness to the
types of noise encountered in the Internet and
demonstrated that these challenges cannot be over-
come by simple domain adaptation techniques
alone.

Belinkov and Bisk (2018) and Heigold et al.
(2017) showed that NMT systems are very sensi-
tive to slightly perturbed input forms, and hinted at
the importance of injecting noisy examples during
training, also known as adversarial examples. Fur-
ther research proposed several methods of generat-
ing and using noisy examples as NMT input to ad-
vance the understanding and improve the transla-
tion quality. Following machine vision, two major
branches being explored when generating noisy
examples, i) white box methods, where adversarial

examples are generated with access to the model
parameters (Ebrahimi et al., 2018; Cheng et al.,
2018a,b, 2019) and ii) black-box attacks, where
examples are generated without accessing model
internals (Zhao et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2018; ?;
Anastasopoulos et al., 2019; Vaibhav et al., 2019);
see Belinkov and Glass (2019) for a categoriza-
tion of such work. In particular, some have fo-
cused on specific variations of naturally-occurring
noise, such as grammatical errors produced by
non-native speakers (Anastasopoulos et al., 2019)
or errors extracted from Wikipedia edits (Belinkov
and Bisk, 2018). It has also been shown that
adding synthetic noise does not trivially increase
robustness to natural noise (Belinkov and Bisk,
2018) and may require specific recipes (Karpukhin
et al., 2019).

Michel et al. (2019) recently emphasized the
importance of meaning-preserving perturbations
and along with Cheng et al. (2019) demonstrated
the utility of adversarial training without sig-
nificantly impairing performance on clean data
and domain. Durrani et al. (2019) showed that
character-based representations are more robust
towards noise compared to such learned using
BPE-based sub-word units in the task of machine
translation.

3 Task

This is the first year we introduce the robustness
task. The goal of the task setup is to exam-
ine MT systems’ performance on non-standard,
noisy, user-generated text, which often resemble
mixed challenges around orthographic variations,
grammar errors, domain shift and stylistic lexical
choice, etc. We use the MTNT dataset (Michel
and Neubig, 2018) as a testbed for the above-
mentioned robustness challenges. To give readers
an idea of the natural “noise” present in the MTNT
dataset, and the challenges for MT systems to ro-
bustly understand and translate them, we provide
some examples of input variations:

• Spelling/typographical errors: accross
(across), recieve (receive), tant (temps)

• Grammatical errors: a tons of, there are
less people

• Spoken language and internet slang:
wanna, chais pas, tbh, smh, mdr



93

• Code switching: This is so kawaii, C’est trop
mainstream

• Profanity/slurs: f*ck, m*rde

Readers are encouraged to refer to Michel and
Neubig (2018) for more details. This year’s task
probes MT robustness for two language pairs,
French to/from English and Japanese to/from En-
glish.

3.1 Task Setup
The task includes two tracks, constrained and un-
constrained depending on whether the system is
trained on a predefined training datasets or not.
The two tracks are evaluated by the same auto-
matic and human evaluation protocol, however,
they are compared separately.

For the constrained system track, the task speci-
fies two types of training data in addition to MTNT
train set:

• “Out-of-domain” parallel data: This facil-
itates MT model’s capability to perform su-
pervised learning from examples with differ-
ent distribution such as lexical choice, lan-
guage style, genre etc. For example, paral-
lel corpora from WMT news translation task,
subtitles and TED talks are specified.

• Monolingual data: We encourage partic-
ipants to develop novel solutions to learn
from unlabelled data, improve existing semi-
supervised approach such as backtranslation.
We provide both in-domain (MTNT) and out-
of-domain (News Commentary, News Crawl,
etc) monolingual data.

3.2 Training Data
In the constrained setting, participants were al-
lowed to use the WMT15 training data3 for
Eng↔Fra and any of the KFTT (Neubig, 2011),
JESC (Pryzant et al.) and TED talks (Cettolo et al.,
2012) corpora for Jpn↔Eng. Additionally, the use
of the MTNT corpus (Michel and Neubig, 2018)
was allowed in order to adapt models on limited
in-domain data.

3.3 Test Data
The test sets were collected following the same
protocol as the MTNT dataset, i.e. collected from

3http://www.statmt.org/wmt15/
translation-task.html

Reddit, filtered out for noisy comments using a
sub-word language modeling criterion and trans-
lated by professional translators. The statistics of
the test sets are reported in Table 1.

3.4 Evaluation protocol

The system outputs were evaluated by profes-
sional translators. The translators were presented
the original source sentence, the reference and the
system output side by side. The order between the
reference and the system output was randomized
by the user interface. The translators rated both
the reference and the translation on a scale from
1 to 100. For both the original source sentence
and the reference, the original text was presented
except for Eng-Jpn where the Japanese reference
tokenized with KyTea was presented in order to
be consistent with the systems’ outputs. The user
interface for annotation is illustrated in Figure 1.

We also evaluated BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002)
for each system using SacreBLEU (Post, 2018).
For all language pairs except Eng-Jpn, we used
the original reference and SacreBLEU with the
default options. In the case of Eng-Jpn, we used
the reference tokenized with KyTea and the option
--tokenize none.

4 Participants and System Descriptions

We received 23 submissions from 11 teams. Ex-
cept two submissions on the Eng-Fra language
pair, all systems used the constrained setup. Be-
low we briefly describe the systems from the 8
teams which submitted corresponding system de-
scription papers:

Baidu & Oregon State University’s submission
(Zheng et al., 2019): Their system is based on
the Transformer implementation in OpenNMT-
py (Klein et al., 2017). The main methods ap-
plied in their submission are: domain-sensitive
data mixing and data augmentation with back-
translation. For data mixing, they used a special
symbol on the source side to indicate the data do-
main. For data augmentation, they back-translate
from a target language to its noisy source. The
intuition, also observed by Michel and Neubig
(2018), is that the source sentences are noisier
than their target translations. They include out-of-
domain clean data during this step and differenti-
ate data types with a special symbol on the target
side. In addition, they also run a model ensemble.

Table 1: Statistics of the test sets.

The team experimented with the Fra→Eng and
Eng→Fra translation directions, obtaining 43.6
and 36.4 BLEU-cased, respectively (3rd place in
both). Their ablations show significant benefit
from domain-sensitive training (+3 BLEU), with
additional improvements from back-translation
and ensembling.

CMU’s submission (Zhou et al., 2019): This
submission only participated in the Fra→Eng di-
rection. They proposed the use of tied multitask
learning, where the noisy source sentences are
first decoded by a same-language denoising de-
coder, and both information is passed on to the
translation decoder. This approach requires data
triples of noisy source, clean source, translation,
which they created by data augmentation over the
provided data, using tag-informed translation sys-
tems trained on either noisy (MTNT) or clean (Eu-
roparl) data. As the participants point out though,
their performance improvements seems to be at-
tributed to data augmentation and not to the inter-
mediate denoising decoder.

CUNI’s submission (Helcl et al., 2019): They
participated in Eng→Fra and Fra→Eng direc-
tions, following a classical two stage approach, i)
training of a base model using a mix of parallel
(WMT15 Eng-Fra News Translation) and back-
translated monolingual data (from News Crawl
and Europarl - excluding News Discussions), ii)
fine-tuning of the base model using the training
portion of the MTNT dataset. All models follow
the Transformer-Big architecture, with the hyper-
parameters and optimization recipe from the 2018
WMT News Translation shared task submission of
CUNI, without ensembles. For both Eng-Fra and
Fra-Eng directions, fine-tuning brought about 2+
BLEU points on top of the base models with the
Transformer-Big architecture, whereas improve-
ments were substantially larger when the base
models were RNN-Based MTNT baselines, about
8+ BLEU points. Participants emphasized the
importance of their strong Transformer-Big base

model which was already 10+ BLEU points better
than the MTNT baseline provided by the shared
task. The effect of individual partitions of the base
model training set (parallel and backtranslated-
mono) on final system quality is not experi-
mented. Finally, participants point out one pecu-
liarity they’ve noticed in the train/validation par-
titioning of the original MTNT dataset; validation
source sentences being started with the letter “Y”
followed by alphabetically sorted sentences (test
partition not effected).

FOKUS’ submission (Grozea, 2019): This
team participated in three directions: Eng→Fra,
Fra→Eng and Jpn→Eng. For the Eng→Fra and
Fra→Eng language pairs, the submissions are un-
constrained systems, where the model was trained
on the medical domain corpus provided by the
WMT biomedical shared task 4. Despite the train-
ing data being out-of-domain, removing “low-
quality” parallel data such as “Subtitles” as the au-
thor hypothesized helped to bring 2 to 4 BLEU
points improvement over the baseline models.
Their Jpn→Eng submission is a constrained sys-
tem, using the same model architecture as the
Eng→Fra language pair. To improve robustness,
they introduced synthetic noise (omitting and du-
plicating letters) in the training data to both source
and target sentences.

JHU’s submission (Post and Duh, 2019): This
submission participated in the Fra→Eng and
Jpn↔Eng tasks. The participants used data dual
cross-entropy filtering for reducing the monolin-
gual data, then back-translate these, and train their
Transformer models (Vaswani et al., 2017). They
compared Moses tokenization+Byte Pair Encod-
ing (BPE) (Sennrich et al., 2016), and sentence-
piece (Kudo and Richardson, 2018) (without any
pre-processing) and found the two comparable,
and that using larger sentence-piece models im-
proved over smaller ones. For Jpn↔Eng (both di-

rections) they first used both in-domain (MTNT)
and out-of-domain data (other constrained), and
then continued training (fine-tune) using MTNT
only. They also reported many results from their
hyper-parameter search (albeit without a clear rec-
ommendation). The final submission is an ensem-
ble of 4 models.

NaverLabsEurope(NLE)’ submission (Bérard
et al., 2019): The participants carried substan-
tial effort to clean the CommonCrawl data, ap-
plying length filtering (length ratio threshold),
language identification-based filtering, and atten-
tion based filtering. They used the Transformer-
Big architecture for Fra→Eng and Jpn→Eng, and
Transformer-Base for the Eng→Jpn direction.

The participants incorporated several methods
to encourage robustness (detailed ablations on the
effect of each method were not provided). They
lowercase all data. However in order to preserve
casing information in the input, they propose a
technique called inline casing which adds addi-
tional casing tags (one per non-lowercased sub-
word) in the sequence. Emojis were replaced with
a special symbol. Natural noise based on manually
defined noise rules was added on the source side of
the training data. Lastly, MTNT monolingual data
was back-translated to be used during training of
the final system. They trained their system on all
available data with special tags for each domain
and for each data type e.g. real, back-translated, or
noisy data. They found that adding tags is as good
as fine-tuning the system, allowing for more flex-
ibility at test time. Their final submission with an
ensemble of 6 systems for Eng→Jpn and ensem-
bles of 4 systems for the other language directions
performed the best in the evaluation campaign.

NICT’s submission (Dabre and Sumita, 2019):
The authors used Transformer models to train their
systems and employed two strategies namely: i)
mixed fine-tuning and ii) multilingual models for
making the systems robust. The former helps as
the in-domain data is available in a very small
quantity. Using a mix of in-domain and out-
domain data for fine-tuning helps overcome the
problem of adjusting learning rate, applying better
regularization and other complicated strategies. It
is not clear how these two methods contributed to-
wards making the models more robust. According
to the authors, mixed fine-tuning and multilingual
training (bidirectional) helped. In the error analy-

sis, they found that their system performs poorly in
translating emojis. The segmentation errors gen-
erated by KyTea resulted in further errors in the
translation.

NTT’s submission (Murakami et al., 2019):
The participants submitted systems for the
Eng→Jpn and Jpn→Eng directions in the con-
strained setting. Their techniques include the
placeholder mechanism for copying non-standard
tokens (emojis, emoticons, etc), back-translation,
fine-tuning on in-domain corpus, and ensem-
ble. Especially, the placeholder mechanism pro-
vides +1.4 BLEU and +0.7 BLEU points for
Jpn→Eng and Eng→Jpn respectively. Finetun-
ing provides a larger improvement for Eng→Jpn
(+1.2 BLEU) than Jpn→Eng (-0.3 BLEU). Their
model is Transformer-Base configuration, where
they demonstrated its capacity to noise-robustness
can be further improved by the above-mentioned
techniques.

5 Summary of Methods

In this section, we give a common theme and sum-
mary of methods applied by the various partici-
pants.

Data Cleaning Data cleaning played an impor-
tant part in training successful MT systems in this
campaign. Unlike other participants, the win-
ning team Naver Labs Bérard et al. (2019) and
NTT (Murakami et al., 2019) applied data clean-
ing techniques in order to filter noisy parallel sen-
tences. They filtered i) identical sentences on
source and target side, ii) sentences that belonged
to a language other than the source and target lan-
guage, iii) sentences with length mismatch, and iv)
also applied attention-based filtering. Data clean-
ing gave an improvement of more than 5 BLEU
points with substantial reduction in the hallucina-
tion of the model for the winning team.

Placeholders Training and test data contained
tokens (such as emoticons) which do not require
translation. Murakami et al. (2019) and Bérard
et al. (2019) preserved these in a preprocessing
step using special placeholders and copied them
in the translation output. Murakami et al. (2019)
reported a gain of up to 1.4 BLEU points by using
placeholders.

Data Augmentation Other than handling noisy
data, one of the challenges related to this task was



97

data sparsity. All the participants back-translated
in-domain monolingual data and used synthetic
data as part of their training pipeline. In addition,
Bérard et al. (2019) created a noisy version of all
the available in-domain and out-of-domain data by
randomly replacing words with their noisy vari-
ants. For training, they appended source sentences
with a tag <noisy> to distinguish them from the
original data. Zhou et al. (2019) used translation
systems using placeholders in order to create both
clean versions of the noisy in-domain datasets, as
well as noisy versions of the clean out-of-domain
dataset. To get additional data, other than back-
translation, the JHU team (Post and Duh, 2019)
used cross-entropy based filtering to select top 1
million sentences from Gigaword, CommonCrawl
and the UN corpus. Adding large filtered data gave
then an improvement of +5.8 BLEU points.

Domain-aware Training In order to differenti-
ate different data, real from synthetic, in-domain
from out-domain, several participants used addi-
tional tags. Zheng et al. (2019); Bérard et al.
(2019) used domain tags during training to in-
dicate data domain. Bérard et al. (2019) addi-
tionally included data type tags (real or back-
translated) for further categorization of the train-
ing data. Compared to fine-tuning, adding tags
provides them additional flexibility, resulting in a
generalized system, robust towards a variety of in-
put data.

Fine-tuning Along with the noisy in-domain
MTNT data, general domain data typically made
available for WMT campaign was also allowed
for this task. Most participants (Murakami et al.,
2019; Dabre and Sumita, 2019; Helcl et al., 2019)
trained on general domain data and fine-tuned the
models towards the task. Murakami et al. (2019)
did not see a consistent improvement with fine-
tuning. Due to the small size of the in-domain
data, Dabre and Sumita (2019) fine-tuned on a mix
of in-domain and a subset of the out-of-domain
data.

Ensembles To benefit from the different trained
models and to make the performance more stable,
many participants performed ensemble over
their models. Murakami et al. (2019), Bérard et al.
(2019), Zheng et al. (2019), and Post and Duh
(2019) ensembled between 4 and 6 checkpoints
of their model for the final submission. They
observed a consistent performance improvement

over using a single model.

6 Results

In this section we describe quantitative results, and
also perform a qualitative analysis of the results.

6.1 Quantitative Results

The quantitative analysis of the submitted systems
yields fairly consistent results. On automatic eval-
uation (BLEU) the best system across all transla-
tion directions is the NaverLabsEurope(NLE) one.
The same system received also the highest hu-
man judgment scores, with the exception of the
Eng→Jpn task, where the NTT system was ranked
higher. Overall, the correlation between human
judgments and BLEU is very high. For Eng→Fra,
the Pearson’s correlation coefficient is 0.94, while
for the other three tasks it is over 0.97.

Human Evaluation The results of human eval-
uation following the evaluation protocol described
in Section 3.4 are outlined in Table 2.

Automatic Evaluation The automatic evalua-
tion (BLEU) results of the Shared Task are sum-
marized in Table 3.

6.2 Qualitative Analysis

In order to discover salient differences be-
tween the methods, we performed analysis using
compare-mt (Neubig et al., 2019), and present
a few of the salient findings below.

Stronger Submissions were Stronger at Every-
thing: The submissions to the track achieved
a wide range of BLEU and human evaluation
scores. In our analysis we found that the systems
at the higher end of the spectrum with regards to
BLEU also tended to be the best by most other
measures (human evaluation, word F-measure by
various frequency buckets, sentence-level scores,
etc.). Because of this, we limit our remaining anal-
ysis to the top three systems in the Fra→Eng and
Eng→Fra tracks, and the top two systems in the
Eng→Jpn and Jpn→Eng tracks.

Generalization to Words not in Adaptation
Data is Essential: The MTNT corpus provides
a small amount of training data that can be used
to adapt systems to the task of translating social
media. One large distinguishing factor between
the best-performing system by Naver Labs Europe
(NLE) and the second- or third-place systems was

this figure we can see that the NLE system does a
bit better in all frequency categories, but the dif-
ference is particularly stark for words that appear
only once or not at all in the MTNT training set.

Proper Handling of Casing is Important: One
other innovation performed by the NLE team was
lowercasing of words and separate prediction of
casing information. This modeling decision appar-
ently resulted in significantly better results partic-

system translates upper-case characters perfectly,
but the CUNI system struggles.

Special Handling of Special Characters is Bene-
ficial: Special characters such as Emojis or sym-
bols were difficult for some systems. Interest-
ingly, even among the top systems, some sys-
tems were better at handling different varieties of
these characters than others. As an example, in
Jpn→Eng, the NTT system performed better on

acters, while the NLE system performed better on
Unicode-standard Emojis, as shown in Table 5.

Non-standard Sentence Structure can be Diffi-
cult: Some systems also found sentences with
unusual structures, including brackets or other
types of punctuation interspersed with actual text,
particularly difficult. For example, Table 6 shows
an example of Jpn→Eng sentences where the

NTT system had trouble generating the appropri-
ate number of symbols in the appropriate places,
while the NLE system was more robust in this re-
gard.

Colloquial Expressions are Key: There was
also a marked difference among the top systems in
their ability to produce the more informal register
reflected in the MTNT test data. We show an ex-
ample in Table 7 of n-grams that the NTT system
was better at producing than the NLE system. All
of these are relatively colloquial ways of express-
ing common function word phrases (1. “is not do-
ing”, 2. “but”, 3. “lots”, 4. “right?”, 5. “but,”)
that can also be expressed with more formal ex-
pressions. Clearly the NTT system is producing
a slightly less formal register than the NLE sys-
tem, although a manual examination of the outputs
found that even the NTT system was still com-
monly producing register that was more formal
than is commonly found on social media. This
may be attributed to the fact that the NTT system

7 Conclusions

As a new WMT shared task, this year we focused
on building MT systems which are robust to in-
put variations commonly observed in informal lan-
guage, social media text etc.

From a methodological perspective, the “con-
strained” setup of the task encouraged participants
to leverage both out-of-domain parallel data and
in-domain monolingual data to improve perfor-
mance. Some techniques were utilized by multi-
ple participants and proved their effectiveness in
boosting MT models’ robustness to noisy input
and domain mismatch, including data cleaning,
domain-aware training, data augmentation (in-
cluding backtranslation and copying place-holder
tags), finetuning, etc.

In terms of evaluation, we found an automatic
metric (BLEU) to be roughly consistent with hu-
man judgment. Qualitative analysis found that
strong baseline systems were important, but on
top of this additional methods specifically aimed
at trying to handle various types of noise found in
social media text were effective and necessary to
further improve within the upper echelons of sys-
tems submitted to the shared task.

There are several directions to be explored in
the future editions of the task. First, it can exhibit a
separate track for “probing” models’ robustness so
as to understand current models’ weaknesses. Sec-
ond, it could further disentangle improvements for
different challenges, e.g., due to noise in training
data or due to distribution shift at test time. Con-
trolling the kind of noise introduced, e.g. natural
vs. artificial, may be useful in this regard.
