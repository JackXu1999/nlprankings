Abstract

Finding coordinations provides useful infor-
mation for many NLP endeavors. However,
the task has not received much attention in
the literature. A major reason for that is that
the annotation of major treebanks does not re-
liably annotate coordination. This makes it
virtually impossible to detect coordinations in
which two conjuncts are separated by punctu-
ation rather than by a coordinating conjunc-
tion. In this paper, we present an annotation
scheme for the Penn Treebank which intro-
duces a distinction between coordinating from
non-coordinating punctuation. We discuss the
general annotation guidelines as well as prob-
lematic cases. Eventually, we show that this
additional annotation allows the retrieval of a
considerable number of coordinate structures
beyond the ones having a coordinating con-
junction.

1 Introduction

1.1 Motivation

Coordination is a difficult topic, in terms of linguis-
tic description and analysis as well as for NLP ap-
proaches. Most linguistic frameworks still struggle
with finding an account for coordination that is de-
scriptively fully adequate (Hartmann, 2000). This is
also the reason why coordination is not adequately
encoded in the annotation of major treebanks. From
an NLP perspective, coordination is one of the major
sources for errors in parsing (Hogan, 2007). If pars-
ing of coordinate structures can be improved, overall
parsing quality also benefits (Kübler et al., 2009).

And consequently, downstream NLP applications,
such as question answering or machine translation,
would benefit as well.

However, since linguistic frameworks in general
are challenged by the diverse phenomena of coordi-
nation, a consistent annotation of coordinate struc-
tures, clearly marking the phenomenon as such as
well as its scope, is a difficult enterprise. Conse-
quently, this makes the detection of conjuncts and
their boundaries a highly non-trivial task. Never-
theless, an exact detection of coordination scopes is
necessary for improving parsing approaches to this
phenomenon.

A first step in the detection of the single con-
juncts of a coordinate structure is a reliable detec-
tion of the presence of a coordinate structure as such
and of the boundaries between its conjuncts. One
highly predictive marker for the detection of coor-
dinate structures is the presence of a coordinating
conjunction such as and, or, neither...nor,
and but. In treebanks, coordinating conjunctions
are generally easy to identify by a specialized part
of speech (POS) tag, for instance CC in the Penn
Treebank (PTB) (Marcus et al., 1993) and KON in
the Stuttgart-Tübingen tagset (STTS) (Thielen and
Schiller, 1994). However, if the coordinate struc-
ture has more than 2 conjuncts, or if it is on the
clause level, the conjuncts are separated by punc-
tuation signs such as commas rather than by overt
coordinating conjunctions. In the PTB, they are an-
notated with the POS tag ,; in the German tree-
banks, TIGER (Brants et al., 2002), Negra (Skut
et al., 1998), TüBa-D/S (Hinrichs et al., 2000), and
TüBa-D/Z (Telljohann et al., 2004) using the STTS,

166



they are annotated with the POS tags $, and $:, like
all other punctuation without coordinating function.

Automatically identifying coordinate structures
and the scope of their conjuncts in the Penn Tree-
bank is challenging since coordinate structures as a
whole and their conjuncts are not explicitly marked
in the annotation by special phrasal or lexical nodes.
Figure 1 shows an example sentence with two coor-
dinate structures, the inside one a coordinate noun
phrase (NP) with 3 conjuncts, and the outside one
a coordinate verb phrase (VP) with two complex
conjuncts. These coordinate structures are labeled
by ordinary phrasal categories such as VP and NP
and can thus not be distinguished at the phrasal level
from VPs and NP that do not involve coordination.

There are approaches to improving parsing for co-
ordinations, but most of these approaches are re-
stricted to very narrow definitions such as coordi-
nations of noun compounds such as “oil and gas re-
sources” (Nakov and Hearst, 2005), coordinations of
symmetrical NPs (Hogan, 2007; Shimbo and Hara,
2007), or coordinations of “A CC B” where A and
B are conjuncts, and CC is an overt conjunction
(Kübler et al., 2009). To our knowledge, there is
no attempt at covering all coordination types.

One goal of this paper is to demonstrate a wide
range of coordination phenomena that have to be
taken into account in a thorough treatment of co-
ordinations. We additionally present a proposal for
an enhanced annotation of coordination for the Penn
Treebank. The annotation is focused on punctuation
and allows for an in-depth investigation of coordi-
nations, for example for linguistic treatments, but
also for work on coordination detection, from which
many NLP applications can profit.

The structure of this paper is as follows. In section
2, we look at syntactic treatments of coordination,
and we have a look at the Penn Treebank guidelines.
Section 3 is dedicated to the presentation of a “style-
book” for the enhanced annotation of coordination
that we advocate in the present paper. We outline
our annotation decisions and the issues that we en-
countered. Section 4 contains an empirical analysis
of the coordinations in the PTB, made possible by
the new annotation. Finally, section 5 concludes the
paper.

2 Related Work

2.1 Coordination in Linguistics

Coordinations are complex syntactic structures that
consist of two or more elements (conjuncts), with
one or more conjuncts typically, but not always
preceded by a coordinating conjunction such as
and, or, neither...nor, and but. How-
ever, see section 3 for examples of coordinations
that lack coordinating conjunctions altogether.
Coordinate structures can conjoin lexical and
phrasal material of any kind and typically exhibit
syntactic parallelism in the sense that each conjunct
belongs to the same lexical or phrasal category.
However, coordinations of unlike categories such
as Loch Ness is a lake in Scotland
and famous for its monster are also
possible. The conjuncts are typically syntactic
constituents; in fact, coordinate structures are
among the classic constructions used to test for
constituency. However, there are well-known cases
of non-constituent conjunctions such as Sandy
gave a record to Sue and a book to
Leslie and gapping structures with one or more
elliptical conjuncts such as Leslie likes
bagels and Sandy donuts. Incidentally,
the coordinate structure in Figure 1 consitutes an
example of non-constituent conjunction since the
second conjunct lower in Zurich does not
form a single constituent. The PTB treats this
conjunct as a VP. However, note that the conjunct is
not headed by a verb; rather the verb is elided.

It is precisely the wide range of distinct subcases
of constituent structures that makes their linguistic
analysis challenging and that makes it hard to con-
struct adequate language models for the computa-
tional processing of coordinate structures. The pur-
pose of the present paper is not to refine existing
theoretical accounts of coordinate structures such
as those proposed in Generative Grammar, Gen-
eralized Phrase Structure Grammar, Head-Driven
Phrase Structure Grammar, Tree Adjoining Gram-
mar, or Dependency Grammar. Rather, our goal is
a much more modest one and focuses on written
language only, where punctuation is among the re-
liable cues for predicting cases of coordinate struc-
tures and for identifying the boundaries of individual
conjuncts, especially for coordinate structures with

more than two conjuncts, which have been largely
ignored in computational modeling of language thus
far.

Since supervised models for statistical parsing re-
quire annotated training material, we will propose
a more fine-grained annotation scheme for punctu-
ation than has thus far been incorporated into ex-
isting treebanks. The present paper focuses on En-
glish only and will use the Penn Treebank Bracket-
ing Guidelines as the annotation scheme for which
such more fine-grained annotations will be pro-
posed. However, the proposed modifications can
be easily imported to other treebanks for English
such as CCGBank or treebanks for other language,
and we conjecture that they would lead to improved
language models for coordinate structures for those
treebanks as well.

In order to properly ground the discussion, we
will now review Penn Treebank Bracketing Guide-
lines.

2.2 Penn Treebank Guidelines

The Penn Treebank Bracketing Guidelines (Bies
et al., 1995, sec. 7) describe extensively how to
treat coordination in terms of bracketing. The
guidelines state that coordinate structures are an-
notated on the lowest level possible. One word
conjuncts are coordinated on the word level. An
example for this is shown in Figure 1 in the co-
ordinated NP Stockholm , Amsterdam and
Frankfurt. In gapped structures, symmetrical

elements in the conjuncts are marked using gap-
coindexation. In the example in Figure 1, the coin-
dexation is shown as a secondary edge from the
prepositional phrase (PP) in the second conjunct to
the PP in the first one.

The guidelines also discuss multi-word co-
ordinating conjunctions such as as well as
or instead of and discontinuous conjunctions
such as not only ...but or not ...but
instead. Multi-word coordinating conjunctions,
including discontinuous ones, are grouped into
CONJP constituents. Single word portions of dis-
continuous conjunctions are not marked as such.
Figure 2 shows an example of a discontinous coordi-
nating conjunction in which the first part is projected
to a CONJP while the second part is a single word
and thus not projected.

The manual does not mention coordinate struc-
tures with more than 2 conjuncts or without overt
conjunctions, and the only examples in which the
comma takes over the role of a coordinating con-
junction refer to “difficult cases” such as the sen-
tence in Figure 3, in which symmetry is enforced by
anti-placeholders *NOT*.

3 Annotation of Coordinating Punctuation

We annotate all intra-sentential punctuation in the
Penn Treebank and determine for each punctuation
sign whether it is part of a coordination or not. As
far as possible, decisions are based on the syntactic

3.1 Annotation principles
The principal guidelines for the enhanced annotation
of coordination are as follows. Let t be a punctuation
token and let tl and tr be the tokens immediately on
the left and the right of t (disregarding coordinating
conjunctions). We annotate t as coordinating iff

1. t is attached to the lowest node tc which domi-
nates both tl and tr, and

2a. in the symmetrical case: the non-terminals di-
rectly dominated by tc which also dominate tl,
resp. tr, have the same label;

2b. in the asymmetrical case: tc is labeled UCP
(coordination of unlike constituents) – or tc
is S, and the two non-terminals dominating tl
and tr are different (since coordination of un-
like clausal constituents is grouped under an S
rather than a UCP).

In cases where there are no nodes between t and
tc, we check the POS tags of tl and tR for equal-
ity. In theory, these two rules, given the syntactic
annotation, should be sufficient to find all cases of
coordination. However, in practice, the situation is
more complicated, as shown in the next subsection.

For example, in Figure 1, the comma is labeled
as coordination since the two words to the left and
right are directly dominated by an NP, and they both
have the same POS tag, NNP, and thus follow rule

2a. The comma in Figure 2 is also annotated as a
coordination following 2a since the words to the left
and right are both dominated by NPs, as is the node
dominating all words in question. We present ex-
amples for symmetrical coordinations on the clausal
and phrasal level in (1).

Figure 3: A difficult coordination example.

(PTB 13082)

The examples in (2) show cases of coordination of
unlike constituents. These cases are covered by the
rule 2b described above; in the first two sentences,
all conjuncts are dominated by UCP, and the last sen-
tence is an example of a clausal coordination, that is
projected to an S node.

(2) a. Assuming final enactment this month ,
the prohibition will take effect [ADV P
96 days later] , or [PP in early February]
. (PTB 6499)

b. My wife and I will stay [PP through
the skiing season] , or [SBAR until the
money runs out] – whichever comes
first . (PTB 15255)

c. This perhaps was perceived as [NP a
“ bold ” stance] , and thus [ADJP

d. [S Mr. Trotter ’s painting showed a wall
of wood boards with painted ribbons
tacked down in a rectangle] ; [SINV
tucked behind the ribbons were en-
velopes , folded , faded and crumpled
papers and currency] . (PTB 8698)

The example in (3) shows a comma that has two
different functions: The comma before and delim-
its the relative clause modifying oral orders,
and at the same time marks the coordination. Since
we are interested in all cases of coordination, such
multi-functional punctuation marks are annotated as
coordinations if that is one of their functions.

(3) The affected practices include [NP the plac-
ing of oral orders , which is the way most
public customer orders are placed] , and [NP
trading between affiliated brokers] , even
though in some cases trading with affiliates
may be the only way to obtain the best exe-
cution for a client . (PTB 15541)

3.2 Problematic Cases

Coordination vs. apposition In many cases, ap-
positions show the same characteristics as the rules
above. An apposition is not restricted to be of the
same category as the constituent it modifies, but in
many cases, it is. These cases are the main reason
for the manual annotation since they cannot be dis-
tinguished automatically. Thus, if the second phrase
defines or modifies the first one, we do not annotate
the intervening commas as coordination. An exam-
ple for an apposition that follows the rules above is
given in (4).

(4) The last two months have been the whole ball
game , ” says [NP Steven Norwitz] , [NP a
vice president ] . (PTB 15034)

The same holds for cases in which a temporal NP
modifies another NP, such as in example (5). Here,
the NP Tass is modified by the temporal NP June
10 , 1988.

(5) – : Letter from Eduard Shevardnadze to
U.N. Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar ,
reported in [NP Tass] , [NP−TMP June 10
, 1988] . (PTB 21148)

170



There are cases, especially ones in which the sec-
ond phrase is negated, for which it is difficult to de-
cide between coordination and apposition. The sen-
tence in (6) shows an example. For these cases, we
decided to treat them as coordination.

(6) He is [NP a mechanical engineer] , [NP not
an atmospheric chemist] . (PTB 7158)

Ambiguous punctuation Commas before coordi-
nating conjunctions are typically signs of coordina-
tion. Note that the usage of commas in the Penn
Treebank is not very regular, and cases of “A, B, and
C” can be found along with cases of “A, B and C”
and cases of “A, and B”, as shown in the examples
in (7). All these cases are covered by rule 2a.

(7) a. Describing itself as “ asset rich , ” Sea
Containers said it will move immedi-
ately to sell [NP two ports] , [NP var-
ious ferries] , [NP ferry services] , [NP
containers] , and [NP other investments]
. (PTB 6105)

b. Stocks closed higher in [NP Hong
Kong] , [NP Manila] , [NP Singapore] ,
[NP Sydney] and [NP Wellington] , but
were lower in Seoul . (PTB 4369)

c. [NP Sidley & Austin , a leading
Chicago-based law firm] , and [NP
Ashurst Morris Crisp , a midsized Lon-
don firm of solicitors] , are scheduled
today to announce plans to open a joint
office in Tokyo . (PTB 5367)

However, there are also cases in which the comma
before a coordinating conjunction is clearly not part
of the coordination, but rather belongs to the preced-
ing constituent, such as in the examples in (8). In
these cases, the syntactic annotation shows that the
comma is not a coordination comma by attaching it
low to the preceding constituent; we do not annotate
these commas as coordination phenomena.

(8) a. Berthold [V P is based in Wildbad , West
Germany ,] and [V P also has operations
in Belgium] . (PTB 4988)

b. Under the plan , Gillette South Africa
will sell [NP manufacturing facilities in
Springs , South Africa ,] and [NP its

business in toiletries and plastic bags] to
Twins Pharmaceuticals Ltd. , an affili-
ate of Anglo American Corp. , a South
African company . (PTB 6154)

c. [S Last week ’s uncertainty in the stock
market and a weaker dollar triggered
a flight to safety] [PRN , he said ,] [S
but yesterday the market lacked such
stimuli] . (PTB 8252)

d. [S I want white America to talk about
it , too ,] but [S I ’m convinced that
the grapevine is what ’s happening] . ”
(PTB 10130)

Another ambiguous case can be found in coordi-
nate structures on the clausal level, which often does
not use overt coordinating conjunctions, but rather
commas or semicolons. These cases of coordination
are difficult to distinguish automatically from other
types of parataxis. The examples in (9) we regard
as coordinations while the examples in (10) are not
since the relation between them is elaborative.

(9) a. [S In 1980 , 18 % of federal prosecu-
tions concluded at trial] ; [S in 1987 ,
only 9 % did] . (PTB 12113)

b. [S Various ministries decided the prod-
ucts businessmen could produce and
how much] ; and [S government-
owned banks controlled the financing of
projects and monitored whether compa-
nies came through on promised plans] .
(PTB 12355)

(10) a. [S This does n’t necessarily mean
larger firms have an advantage] ; [S
Mr. Pearce said GM works with a
number of smaller firms it regards
highly] . (PTB 12108)

b. [S Senator Sasser of Tennessee is
chairman of the Appropriations sub-
committee on military construction] ;
[S Mr. Bush ’s $ 87 million request for
Tennessee increased to $ 109 million]
. (PTB 12223)

Non-coordinative use of conjunctions There are
sentences that involve coordinating conjunctions in
structures that are not coordinations but rather ap-

171



positions. While the first example in (11) cannot be
distinguished from coordination based on our anno-
tation guidelines (cf. sec. 3.1) and the syntactic an-
notation, the syntactic annotation for the other two
sentences shows that these are not considered cases
of coordination, either by grouping the coordinating
conjunction under a parenthetical node (PRN) or un-
der a fragment (FRAG).

(11) a. The NASD , which operates the Nas-
daq computer system on which 5,200
OTC issues trade , compiles short in-
terest data in [NP [NP two categories]
: [NP the approximately two-thirds ,
and generally biggest , Nasdaq stocks
that trade on the National Market Sys-
tem ; and the one-third , and generally
smaller , Nasdaq stocks that are n’t a
part of the system]] . (PTB 21080)

b. Martha was [ADJP pleased , [PRN
but nowhere near as much as Mr.
Engelken]] . (PTB 14598)

c. The HUD scandals will simply [V P
continue , [FRAG but under new
mismanagement]] . (PTB 15629)

Coordination in NP premodification The Penn
Treebank Bracketing Guidelines (Marcus et al.,
1993) state that generally conjuncts are projected to
the phrase level before they are coordinated. There
is one exception: premodifiers in NPs, which are
only projected if they consist of more than one word.
In such cases, it is not obvious from the tree that
there is a coordination. But even if there is no ex-
plicit marking of coordination in the syntactic anal-
ysis, we do annotate the coordination. Examples are
shown in (12).

(12) a. Yesterday , it received a [ADJP $
15 million] , [JJ three-year] contract

tory in all this , and it would be nice to

4 Properties of the Annotation

For the empirical analysis presented here, we use ap-
proximately half the Penn Treebank. The data set
has a size of 23 678 sentences and 605 064 words
in total, with an average length of 25.6 words per
sentence.

Table 1 shows some basic statistics, more specfi-
cally:

1. the numbers of annotated commas, semicolons,
and coordinating conjunctions (CC) and their
total numbers over the entire data set, and

2. the average numbers of annotated commas,
semicolons, and coordinating conjunctions
(CC) and their average number per sentence.

The numbers show that approximately 14% of all
commas and 80% of all semicolons are used in co-
ordinate structures. CCs constitute only 2.36% of
all words. If we count CCs as well as the punctu-
ation signs that are annotated as being part of a co-
ordination, the number rises to 3.10% of all words.
These numbers show that we cannot assume that all
sentence-internal punctuation is related to coordina-
tion, but that the use of commas and semicolons to
separate conjuncts is not a marginal phenomenon.

Table 2 offers a first look at the distribution of
the number of conjuncts that occur in coordinate
structures. Our present investigation focuses ex-
clusively on noun phrase coordination. Given that,
in principle, our annotation marks all conjunctions,
and given that our annotation guidelines state that
all conjuncts must be sisters, it is rather straight-
forward to determine the number of conjuncts of a
coordination: We simply count the separators be-
tween conjuncts, i.e. CCs and conjunction punctu-
ation, below a given non-terminal while counting

adjacent separators as singles (in order to count se-
quences of “A, and B” as single separator). The
number of conjuncts is then the number of separa-
tors plus one. Without annotation, i.e. when only
considering CC, we find that 2 882 sentences (12%
out of the total of 23 678 sentences) have coordi-
nations consisting of more than two conjuncts. If
we additionally consider the coordination punctua-
tion, this number rises significantly to 4 764 (20%).
When looking at noun phrase coordination, more
precisely, at coordination below NX and NP, the
added value of our enhanced coordination annota-
tion is especially apparent: It is clear from the num-
bers in Table 2 that we would miss a high number of
coordinations, especially multi-conjunct structures,
without the annotation and that this additional num-
ber of coordinations can be found reliably using our
enhanced annotation.

As an example for a coordination that would
be difficult to identify correctly, consider sentence
(7-a). The syntactic annotation is shown in Fig. 4.
While the CC tag on the last andwould allow for the

identification of the coordination of containers,
and other investments, all NPs which are
in front of those two could not be recognized as part
of the coordination. A more detailed investigation
of coordinate structures beyond noun phrases that
would also include an assessment of the scope of
coordinations is left for future work.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we have listed a wide range of coor-
dination phenomena that have to be taken into con-
sideration for an exhaustive treatment of coordina-
tion. We have presented a new annotation layer
for the Penn Treebank which allows for a thorough
treatment of coordination by clarifying the status of
punctuation. Furthermore, in an empirical analy-
sis, we have demonstrated the utility of our anno-
tation, showing that it allows for the detection of a
large number of coordinations which cannot be de-
tected when only coordinating conjunctions are con-
sidered.

The annotation opens the way for interesting fu-
ture research. We are pursuing two different paths.
On the one hand, we are investigating possibilites
for the identification of coordination scope, also be-
yond phrasal coordination. For the first time, this
is now possible using supervised methods. On the
other hand, we are working on improving parser per-
formance on coordinations on the basis of our new
annotation, beyond the restricted types of coordina-
tion considered in previous works.
