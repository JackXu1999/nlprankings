Abstract

In Danish relative clauses and embedded
interrogative clauses are not extraction is-
lands. However, there is an asymmetry be-
tween the two clauses. In Danish it is pos-
sible to extract the subject out of an em-
bedded interrogative clause. Extraction of
the subject out of a relative clause, on the
other hand, is not allowed. In this paper
we present a formal HPSG analysis of ex-
traction in Danish which treats the extrac-
tion out of relative and embedded inter-
rogative clauses in a uniform manner, and
the asymmetry between the clauses will be
shown to follow from a more general con-
straint on adjuncts.

1 Introduction

Relative clauses and embedded interrogative
clauses are commonly taken not to allow extrac-
tion. This has been extensively discussed under
the headings of extraction islands, (Ross, 1967),
subjacency and the Empty Category Principle,
(Chomsky, 1973). In Danish, relative clauses and
embedded interrogative clauses are not extraction
islands. However, there is an asymmetry between
the two clauses, as also noted by e.g. Engdahl
(1984), in that it is not possible to extract the high-
est subject out of a relative clause, a restriction that
does not apply to embedded interrogatives.

It has been suggested that there is a structural
difference between relative clauses and embedded
interrogative clauses that might explain the differ-
ent behaviour when it comes to subject extraction,
e.g. Engdahl (1984). She suggests that relative
clauses are of category S, whereas interrogative
clauses are of type S which has an extra XP po-
sition. This difference has the consequence that
the empty category in subject position in relative
clauses is not properly governed. Consequently

the Empty Category Principle rules out extractions
of subjects from relative clauses.

In feature-based analyses it has been suggested
that subject extraction does not involve extraction
at all, e.g. Gazdar (1981) and Pollard and Sag
(1994). However, in more recent feature-based
analyses, e.g. Sag (1997), Bouma et al. (2000),
Ginzburg and Sag (2000) and Sag (to appear), sub-
jects are also treated as being extracted. The anal-
yses have been influenced by discussions by e.g.
Hukari and Levine (1996) concerning subject ex-
traction, arguing that there is cross-language evi-
dence that subjects are also extracted in the same
way as complements.

In this paper we provide a feature-based analy-
sis of extraction that treats the extraction of sub-
jects out of embedded interrogatives and relative
clauses in a uniform manner, and show that the
asymmetry between the clauses follow from a
more general constraint on adjuncts clauses.

In section 2 we show the relevant Danish extrac-
tion data. Then in section 3 we go on to present
the analytical background that the formalization of
our analysis is based on. Then our analysis is for-
malized in section 4. In section 5 we discuss the
Complex NP Constraint, and finally we conclude
in section 6.

2 The Danish data

As stated above, relative and embedded interrog-
ative clauses are not extraction islands in Danish.
In (1) we find examples of object extractions from
these clauses.1

Apart from the difference in extraction potential
between subjects and objects, the insertion of ex-
pletive der (’there’) instead of a gap in some of the
clauses should be noted. As observed in Hansen
(1974), der is inserted in local subject extractions
in standard Danish, cf. (1a) and (1b). In non-local
subject extractions der is not inserted in standard
Danish, cf. (2a). In non-standard Danish der inser-
tion is also found in non-local subject extractions,
cf. (2b).

3 Analytical background

Before our analysis is presented we will go
through the analytical background that we base
our analysis on. The analysis is largely based
on the feature-based account of extraction in
Ginzburg and Sag (2000), cf. also Neville and
Paggio (2004) for an analysis of Danish relative
clause constructions. The presentation of the for-
mal background here is by no means exhaustive,
and the semantics of the analysis is left out. How-
ever, a number of important assumptions for the
purpose of understanding the formalization in sec-
tion 4 are explained. The grammar used is a hi-
erarchy of typed feature structures with associated
implicational constraints constraining what consti-
tutes well-formed linguistic entities.

Within the HPSG framework, constructions in-
volving extractions are called filler-gap construc-
tions. Filler-gap constructions are specified for the
feature SLASH, and filler-gap dependencies are es-
tablished through the inheritance of SLASH speci-
fications. A non-empty SLASH specification is in-
troduced at the lowest level where the “gap” is in-
troduced, then passed up through the structure, to
be bound off by the filler. In (5) the specification
for the SLASH feature in a filler-gap construction,
like the highlighted part of (4), is illustrated.

A “gap” in the structure is a feature structure
of type gap-s(yn)s(em). The gap-ss type does
not have any phonological content, and it shares
its syntactic and semantic content with its corre-
sponding overt element. It is constrained by the
constraint in (6).

The structure in (5) is constrained by a set
of constraints. The non-empty SLASH feature is
introduced by the Argument Realization Princi-
ple, (Ginzburg and Sag, 2000, p. 171), and the
SLASH-Amalgamation Constraint, (Ginzburg and
Sag, 2000, p. 169). These are shown in (7) and (8),
respectively.

The Argument Realization Principle may in-
troduce a “gap” on the ARG-ST list of a word,

at the same time, removing synsems that have
been resolved to gap-ss from the COMPS list of a
word. The SLASH-Amalgamation Constraint en-
sures that the SLASH values of the arguments of
a word are inherited by the word itself. This is
also known as lexicalized SLASH-amalgamation.
The SLASH-Amalgamation Constraint is a default
constraint. The inheritance of the SLASH value in
constructions is taken care of by the Generalized
Head Feature Principle, (Ginzburg and Sag, 2000,
p. 33), which specifies inter alia the inheritance of
the SLASH feature from the head-daughter to the
mother in a construction.

Finally, various constraints are responsible for
binding off the SLASH value, either constraints in-
volving a filler daughter or constraints involving
constructional gap-binding. Contraints involving
a filler daughter are constraints that are subtypes
of the more general constraint on hd-fill-ph, e.g.
wh2-interrogative clauses. This contraint is shown
in (9), cf. Ginzburg and Sag (2000, p. 174).

⊎ Σ2




This constraint removes the gap-ss from the
SLASH set which corresponds to the LOCAL value
of the filler daughter.

Constructional gap-binding occurs in e.g. rel-
ative clauses which do not contain relative pro-
nouns. In such cases a certain construction binds
off the “gap” instead of a wh-word. Sag (1997)
introduces the non-wh-rel-cl with the constraint
shown in (10).

(10) non-wh-rel-cl:[
HEAD |MOD Ni

[
SLASH

The effect is to build a unary branching struc-
ture which turns a clause into a relative clause by
binding off the “gap”, while at the same time intro-
ducing a MOD feature and co-indexing the index
on the element in the SLASH set with the index of
the MOD value. In this way co-indexing between
the modified noun and the “gap” is ensured. The

3We follow Erteschik-Shir (1984) and Vikner (1991) in
treating “som” as a complementizer. This is motivated e.g.
by (non-standard) examples like (1) where we have combi-
nations of wh-pronouns and “som”, and another complem-
tizer “at” (’that’). In such cases, the wh-pronoun binds off
the Slash value.

Note that because of the Generalized Head Fea-
ture Principle, the SLASH value is passed up to the
clause via the complementizer which is analyzed
as the head of the clause.

4 Formal analysis

In this section the proposed formal analysis of
Danish extraction is presented. The analysis is a
further development of the analysis presented in
Bjerre (to appear).

As explained in section 3, a “gap” in the struc-
ture is a feature structure of type gap-s(yn)s(em)
which does not have any phonological content, cf.
the constraint in (6). To account for the Danish der
insertion phenomenon in certain subject extrac-
tion contexts, we introduce another type of non-
canonical synsem type. The extended hierarchy is
shown in (13).

(13) synsem

canon-ss noncan-ss

expl-ss gap-ss pro-ss

The type expl-ss is a synsem which has phono-
logical content, and it is consequently a subtype
of canon-ss. But, as the gap-ss, the expl-ss does
not have any semantic content of its own. The two
latter types differ in that the gap-ss also has no
syntactic content, unlike the expletive. (14) shows
the constraint for expl-ss.




LOC

[
CAT |HEAD expl




In Danish, the Argument Realization Principle
additionally removes synsems that have been re-
solved to gap-ss from the SUBJ list of the word.
However, the subject is visible as the value of the
SUBJECT feature.5 The Danish Argument Realiza-
tion Principle is shown in (15).



Words with a subject which has a gap-ss value
have an empty SUBJ list. This is in contrast to
Ginzburg and Sag (2000), where a gap-ss remains
on the SUBJ list. This is to account for the poten-
tial realization of an expletive in subject position
in Danish. If the subject is resolved to an expl-ss,
it remains on the SUBJ list to be cancelled off in
the hd-subj-ph.

Now to the lexical inheritance of SLASH spec-
ifications. Here we have to take into account the
Danish der insertion phenomenon. So in addition
to the default SLASH-Amalgamation Constraint
we need a second constraint for Danish, the Ex-
pletive SLASH Constraint in (18), cf. (Bjerre, to
appear).

(18)
Expletive SLASH Constraint:


, . . .

〉




The constraint in (18) makes sure that der in-
sertion only takes place if we have a local subject
extraction. The constraint excludes words which
contain an element on the ARG-ST list with an ex-
pletive subject corresponding to an element in the

SLASH set. This means that a SLASH value orig-
inating from an expletive can only be bound off
locally. The Expletive SLASH Constraint applies
in standard Danish, but as we saw in section 2, not
in non-standard Danish.

Now we come to the binding off of the SLASH
value. For the present purpose, extraction out of
embedded interrogatives and relative, we need the
types listed in (19), cf. the clause hierarchy set up
in Ginzburg and Sag (2000).

(19) a. fin-wh-ns-int-cl

b. fin-wh-ns-rel-cl

c. fin-non-wh-rel-cl

In the following we will concentrate on what
constraints are involved in structures of these
types, but we will not be specific about where the
constraints originate from. Some of the constraints
may be specific to these types, others may be in-
herited from more general types.

The data we need to account for with the fin-
wh-ns-int-cl construction are (2) repeated in (20).
The construction covers the highlighted parts of

off. The SLASH set may contain a second ele-
ment, corresponding to an extracted subject. This
element is not bound off, but passed on to the
mother. The value of the head daughter’s scshape
subject list may in that case be either a gap-ss,
as in (20a) or a expl-ss as in (20b). If both the
SLASH-Amalgamation Constraint and the Exple-
tive SLASH Constraint are applied, only the exam-
ple without an expletive subject is well-formed, as
an element in the SLASH set corresponding to the
expletive subject will not be amalgamated by a se-
lecting head. If only the SLASH-Amalgamation
Constraint is applied both examples are well-
formed, as the SLASH set corresponding to an ex-
pletive subject is not excluded by the Expletive
SLASH Constraint. Importantly, nothing prevents
a subject from being extracted.

We turn now to the relative clause examples.
The data we need to account for with the fin-wh-
ns-rel-cl construction are the examples in (3b) and
(3c) repeated in (22). The construction covers the
highlighted parts.

We use an extended ARG-ST list for words as in
Ginzburg and Sag (2000). There it is used for cer-
tain optionally selected adjuncts. We assume that
noun words may be derived from noun lexemes
with an additional element on the ARG-ST list, ie.
a restrictive relative clause. This means that the
Argument Realization Principle will give rise to a
representation as shown in (23) with a restrictive
relative clause on the COMPS list.

The consequence of this analysis is that the
SLASH value of a restrictive relative clause will
be passed on to the head noun by the SLASH-
Amalgamation Constraint.

The important constraint on finite adjunct
clauses that gives rise to the asymmetry be-
tween relative clauses and embedded interrogative
clauses is introduced in (24).

The constraint expresses the generalization that
adjunct clauses require a subject. The constraint
excludes adjunct clauses which contain a non-
canonical subject which has not already been
bound off.

The fin-wh-ns-rel-cl is a subtype of fin-adjunct-
cl and is subject to the constraint in (24). The
constraints for non-subject wh-relative clauses is
given in (25).

As in (21) the element in the head daughter’s
SLASH set which corresponds to the filler daugh-
ter is bound off and the SLASH set may contain
a second element, corresponding to an extracted
subject. The value of the head daughter’s scshape
subject list may again be either a gap-ss, as in
(22a) or a expl-ss as in (22b). This element is
not bound off, but passed on to the mother. If
the SLASH-Amalgamation Constraint and the Ex-
pletive SLASH Constraint are both applied to the
examples in (22), only the example with a gap-
ss subject will pass on the corresponding SLASH
element. However, because of the constraint in
(24) on adjunct clauses, the example in (22a) is

not bound off. If only the SLASH-Amalgamation
Constraint is applied, the example with a expl-ss
subject will also pass on the corresponding SLASH
element. However, again because of the additional
contraint in (24) on adjunct clauses, the example
in (22b) is also ill-formed. Importantly, in neither
case is it allowed to extract the subject.

With respect to the fin-non-wh-rel-cl, it is the
examples in (3e) and (3f) repeated in (26) we
need to exclude. The construction covers the high-
lighted part of the examples.

In (27) the “object” element in the head daugh-
ter’s SLASH set is bound off constructionally.
Again the SLASH set may contain a second ele-
ment, corresponding to an extracted subject which
is passed on to the mother. Again the value of the
head daughter’s scshape subject list may be either
a gap-ss, as in (26a)or a expl-ss as in (26b). In
any case, because of the constraint on finite ad-
junct clauses, a SLASH element corresponding to
the highest subject in the clause will not be passed
on for the noun to amalgamate so that it can escape
the noun phrase. Again, we see it is not allowed to
extract a subject in (26a) and (26b) as predicted.

5 The Complex NP Constraint

We have already seen that Ross’ Complex NP
Constraint does not apply for Danish NPs with rel-
ative clauses, when we looked at object extraction
from relative clauses. The constraint that finite ad-
junct clauses cannot contain a non-canonical sub-
ject which is not already bound off rules out sub-
ject extraction from relative clauses in an NP. Now,
our analysis predicts that subject extraction out of
complement clauses in NPs is allowed, and hence
that the Complex NP Constraint does not apply in
Danish. The examples in (28) contain subject ex-
tractions out of complement clauses in NPs.

Our analysis thus correctly predicts that Dan-
ish does not adhere to the Complex NP constraint,
cf. also Allwood (1976) and Andersson (1982) for
a discussion of the Complex NP Contstraint in
Swedish.

6 Conclusion and further research

The paper has shown that Danish allows extraction
extensively. We have presented a formal HPSG
analysis of extraction which treats the extraction
out of relative and embedded interrogative clauses
in a uniform manner. The apparent asymmetry
wrt. extraction between the two clause types have
been shown to follow from a more general con-
straint on adjunct clauses, i.e. Danish finite adjunct
clauses require a subject. If the subject is non-
canonical, it must have be bound off internally. We
have presented data which show that subject ex-
traction out of complement clauses in NPs is pos-
sible. This was shown not to contradict our anal-
ysis, rather it follows naturally as our constraint
on adjunct clauses does not apply to NP comple-
ments. Finally it should be noted that the appar-
ent lack of syntactic constraints on extraction, with
varying degrees of acceptability, admittedly, sug-
gests that further research into the pragmatics of
extraction is called for in Danish, cf. Erteschik-
Shir (1973) and Erteschik-Shir (1982), and for
Swedish Allwood (1976) and Engdahl (1997).
