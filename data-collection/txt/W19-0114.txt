Abstract

This paper outlines a formal model of
socially motivated language change which
unites insights from identity-oriented theo-
ries of language change with formal theo-
ries of language use and understanding. We
use (Gärdenfors, 2000)’s Conceptual Spaces
framework to formalize socially motivated
ideological change and use signaling games
with an iterated best response solution con-
cept (Franke, 2009; Frank and Goodman,
2012) to formalize the link between ideol-
ogy, linguistic meaning and language use. We
then show how this new framework can be
used to shed light on the mechanisms un-
derlying socially-motivated change in French
grammatical gender.

1 Introduction

Since the mid 1990s, the development of mathemat-
ical and computational models of language varia-
tion and change, such as (Clark and Roberts, 1993;
Niyogi and Berwick, 1997; Yang, 2000; Yang,
2002; Kauhanen and Walkden, 2018) among others,
has yielded enormous advances in our understand-
ing of the cognitive processes that underly these
phenomena. However, although it has been ob-
served since at least (Labov, 1963) that many (if not
most) linguistic changes are socially conditioned,
formal models have been almost exclusively fo-
cused on the grammatical and/or psychological as-
pects of change, neglecting its social aspects. On
the other hand, many non-mathematically oriented
approaches in sociolinguistics and linguistic anthro-
pology (see (Bucholtz and Hall, 2005; Bucholtz and

Hall, 2008) for an overview) have stressed the role
that social meaning, ideologies and identity con-
struction play in language use, and they have devel-
oped articulated theories of how meaning and ideo-
logical structure mediate the relation between social
change and language change. The goal of this paper
is to outline a model which brings together insights
from identity-oriented theories of language change
and unites them with formal theories of language
use and understanding. More specifically, we use
(Gärdenfors, 2000; Gärdenfors, 2014)’s Concep-
tual Spaces framework to formalize speaker/listener
ideological change and use epistemic game the-
ory, particularly signaling games with an iterated
best response solution concept, such as the Ratio-
nal Speech Act model (RSA) (Franke, 2009; Frank
and Goodman, 2012; Burnett, 2017) to formalize the
link between ideology, linguistic meaning and lan-
guage use. We then show how this new framework
can be used to shed light on the mechanisms under-
lying socially-motivated change in French grammat-
ical gender.

2 Variation and change in French g-gender

French is a g(rammatical) gender language, which
means that its grammar sorts all nouns into two
classes, masculine and feminine, that determine pat-
terns of agreement in sentences (Hockett, 1958; Cor-
bett, 1991). Although with inanimate nouns, there
is no relation between noun meaning and g-gender,
there is a non-arbitrary relation between social and
grammatical gender with most human nouns. This
paper focuses on change in the use of nouns denot-
ing social functions. When referring to a woman,

either the feminine or the masculine can be used
with these nouns; whereas, only the masculine can
be used to refer to a man (1)-(2).

(1) a. Le président ‘the (fe)male president’
b. La présidente ‘the female president’

(2) a. Le ministre ‘the (fe)male minister’
b. La ministre ‘the female minister’

(Burnett and Bonami, 2018) present a study of
variation and change in g-gender of terms of ad-
dress for women (Madame le/la N1) in the tran-
scripts of the debates of the Assemblée Nationale
(French House of Representatives) from 1983-2005.
This corpus features a high degree of intra-speaker
variation in g-gender, an example of which is shown
in (3) for Madame le/la ministre ‘Madam Minister’.

(3) a. M. Jean-Marc Ayrault. Madame le min-
istre de l’environnement, plus de 6 000 per-
sonnes ont défilé, samedi dernier, dans les
rues de Nantes. . . (29/01/1997)

b. M. Jean-Marc Ayrault. Monsieur le
président, madame la ministre, mes chers
collègues,. . . (19/12/1997)

The use of grammatical gender in expressions
referring to women has been the subject of enor-
mous amounts of prescription and language plan-
ning, see (Houdebine, 1998; Burr, 2003; Viennot,
2014) among others, and these actions can be nat-
urally divided into two main waves of activism at
the end of the 20th century. The first wave cen-
tered around on March 11th 1986, when the Social-
ist Prime Minister Laurent Fabius legislated the use
feminine grammatical gender (eg. la ministre, la
présidente) in the Assemblée Nationale and in offi-
cial documents. Figure 1 shows the proportion of the
use of feminine vs masculine grammatical gender
in female terms of address (Madame le/la N) in the
Assemblée Nationale from 1983 to 2005. This fig-
ure shows that use of the feminine form is extremely
limited throughout the 1980s, and that Fabius’ lan-
guage policy in 1986 had little to no effect on the
speech of the politicians.

However, twelve years later, on March 6th 1998,
1The authors focused on terms of address because the ti-

tle (Madame) allowed for the automatic identification of female
referents from the transcripts.

the Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin issued a
statement (a circulaire) acknowledging that Fabius’
policy was never obeyed/enforced and recalling to
the government that they are supposed to be using
feminine g-gender. Figure 1 shows that the second
wave of activism has very different results, with use
of the feminine form rising dramatically in 1997-98,
around the time of Jospin’s statement.

(Burnett and Bonami, 2018) argue that the strik-
ing contrast between the mid 1980s and the mid
1990s, and the reason Jospin’s reiteration of Fabius’
language policy was successful when the original
policy failed, was due to a change in the social con-
text in which the policies were enacted. Whereas, in
the 1980s, social and political attention to issues of
gender equality was limited, the mid-1990s saw an
explosion of public reflection on the properties of fe-
male politicians and the place of women in govern-
ment within the context of the parité political move-
ment (Gaspard et al., 1992), which aimed to ensure
equal representation of men and women across elec-
toral lists.

(Burnett and Bonami, 2018) show that the spread
of the use of feminine g-gender mirrors the spread of
the support for parité, with left wing politicians, who
supported parité early, using significantly more fem-
inine (61% F 1356/2133) than right wing politicians
(28% F 793/2023), who only supported the move-
ment after mid 1998 (Bereni, 2007). Furthermore,
right wing politicians who actively support parité,
such as Roselyne Bachelot (81% F 105/129), be-
have like left wing politicians. Following (Ramsay,
2003; Achin et al., 2007; Julliard, 2012; Montini,
2017) among others, (Burnett and Bonami, 2018)
argue that the parité movement was accompanied
by enormous discussion in news and literary me-
dia, and many of the discourses emerging from these
discussions constructed female politicians as having
stereotypically feminine properties, such as being
sensitive, pragmatic and honest. Thus, the authors
propose that the parité movement and the public dis-
cussion surrounding it served to introduce new so-
cial types (or personae) for female politicians into
the ideologies of French speakers in the late 1990s.
(Burnett and Bonami, 2018) show that politicians in
their corpus, such as Bachelot and Ségolène Royal,
who personally construct a new feminine persona,
use significantly more feminine than their female

136

party colleagues who have a more masculine gen-
der construction, such as Michèle Alliot-Marie and
Martine Aubry. Furthermore, women constructing a
feminine persona, such as Royal, are referred to sig-
nificantly more often in the feminine than women
constructing less a feminine persona, like Aubry.

Social meaning of French g-gender

To account for these patterns, following
(McConnell-Ginet, 2013), (Burnett and Bonami,
2018) propose that French feminine g-gender
marking has social meaning; in particular, the
authors propose that feminine g-gender marking
(F) is associated with, or indexes (Ochs, 1992), sets
of properties called their indexical fields (Eckert,
2008), notated [F], which contain properties stereo-
typically associated with women at the time, such as
those referenced in the discourses on female politi-
cians mentioned above (4-a). Correspondingly,
masculine g-gender marking indexes properties
stereotypically associated with men at the time
(4-b).

(4) a. [F] = {sensitive, pragmatic, non-dominant,
honest. . . }

b. [M] = {tough, abstract, dominant, dishon-
est. . . }

Since the new feminine personae have stereotypi-
cally feminine properties, speakers are predicted to
use the feminine when attempting to construct such
a persona and/or when describing someone who in-
stantiates one. Conversely, they are predicted to
use the masculine when constructing a more stereo-

typically masculine persona or when referring to
women with a more stereotypically masculine gen-
der presentation. In the 1980s, all personae for fe-
male politicians had masculine properties; therefore,
the masculine form dominated. As speaker ideolo-
gies change to incorporate the new feminine per-
sonae in the mid 1990s and speakers started viewing
themselves and others in these terms, and the fem-
inine became more useful and eventually replaced
the masculine in the Assemblée Nationale with the
help of Jospin’s circulaire.

(Burnett and Bonami, 2018) provide an intuitive
explanation of the change and why Jospin’s reitera-
tion of Fabius’ policy was successful; however, they
do not make completely explicit how the develop-
ment of the new personae translates into the change
from masculine g-gender to feminine g-gender, and
why Fabius’ and Jospin’s language policies had dif-
ferent statuses. Therefore, in the rest of this pa-
per, we flesh out the relation between ideologi-
cal change, language change and language policy
in terms of the Conceptual Spaces and signaling
games.

3 Ideological change in Conceptual Spaces

To formalize ideological change, we will make
use of formal tools from the Conceptual Spaces
framework for lexical semantics (Gärdenfors, 2000;
Gärdenfors, 2014). In this approach speaker and lis-
tener conceptual and ideological structures are rep-
resented as a tuple hD, sim, PERSi, where hD, simi
is an |D|-dimensional vector space with a relation
sim measuring distance between points, and PERS is
a distinguished set of points. Socially meaningful

137



expressions are interpreted into these vector spaces
whose dimensions are found in their indexical fields.
In synchronic research, the dimensions and personae
in the spaces can be constructed based on experi-
mental data, as in (Douven, 2016), and the index-
ical fields associated with sociolinguistic variants
can likewise be determined by experimentation (see,
for instance, (Campbell-Kibler, 2007; Levon, 2014;
Podesva et al., 2015)). The study that we are model-
ing in this paper is a historical one, and it’s possible
that g-gender’s indexical fields have changed in the
past twenty years. Therefore, we will use simula-
tions to illustrate how our formal model works.

In the analysis of the social meaning of French
g-gender, we will take the dimensions from public
discourses about French politicians in the 1990s de-
scribed in (Burnett and Bonami, 2018), shown in (5).
This being said, for ease of visualisation, we will
limit our illustration to a three dimensional space
consisting of Institutional dominance, Abstraction
and Toughness.

(5) 4 dimensions of ideological space
a. Institutional dominance

(dominant $ non-dominant)
b. Abstraction (abstract $ pragmatic)
c. Toughness (tough $ sensitive)
d. Honesty (dishonest $ honest)

We propose that personae are represented as dis-
tinguished points within this space (i.e. PERS) ac-
cording to their properties,2 and changes in speakers
and listeners’ ideological structure will be modeled
as changes in how personae are distributed across
the ideological space. For example, suppose we
consider most politicians’ ideological structures in
1986, i.e. when Fabius formulated the first language
policy. (Burnett and Bonami, 2018) argue that there
was a very tight correlation in the minds of politi-
cians between institutional dominance, abstraction
and toughness at this time, and we can represent this
as a correlation between values on the different di-
mensions. Of course we do not know exactly how
many personae a speaker represents and how ex-
actly they are arranged in the ideological space, so
as a demonstration of how the framework works, we
generated 20 points in the conceptual space such that

2Our personae play the role of Gärdenfors’ prototypes.

10 occupy the higher two thirds of the space on the
dominance, abstraction, and toughness scales, while
10 occupy the lower two thirds of the space, using
the rand function in Octave (Eaton et al., 2015).
Thus, we propose that most politicians in the AN
have an ideological structure similar to that found in
Figure 2 in 1986.

Figure 2: Ideological structure in the late 1980s (PERS86)

Observe that there are some significant empty
spaces in the cube shown in Figure 2. Most impor-
tantly, no personae are highly dominant, very prag-
matic and also very sensitive in this model.

Both the truth conditional and social meanings of
linguistic expressions pick out regions of the ide-
ological space, and speakers use their language to
communicate information about the location of the
individual that they are talking about. By analogy
with Gärdenfors’s work on prototypes in lexical se-
mantics, we assume that the arrangement of per-
sonae in the space imposes constraints on which re-
gions noun phrases like le ministre and la ministre
can identify. Given an n-dimensional conceptual
space and a distinguished set of points, there is a nat-
ural way of partitioning this space into discrete re-
gions: voronoi polygons. The voronoi polygon as-
sociated with a persona pi, v(pi), is the set of points
that lie closer to pi than to any other persona in the
domain (6-a). The Voronoi tesselation generated by
a set of personae PERS, V(PERS), is the collection of
voronoi polygons associated with every persona in
PERS (6-b).

(6) Let pi 2 PERS be a persona.
a. v(pi) := {x|8j(sim(x, pi)  sim(x, pj))}

138



b. V (PERS) := {v(pi)|pi 2 PERS}

Thus, the voronoi tessalation of the personae in
the 1986 model are shown (in two dimensions for
readability) in Figures 3 and 4.3

Figure 3: 1986 ideological space: Dominance vs Toughness

Figure 4: 1986 ideological space: Dominance vs Abstraction

Crucially, in this model, individuals that are both
highly institutionally dominant and very sensitive
fall within the ideological region of a less dominant
persona (Figure 3). Likewise, highly dominant and
very pragmatic individuals are obligatorily grouped

3All the tesselations in this paper were calculated using Oc-
tave.

into the region defined by the less dominant persona
(Figure 4).

Function nouns and indexical fields
The nouns that alternate in the Assemblée Nationale
corpus all refer to very powerful government posi-
tions (ministre, garde des sceaux, président(e) etc.).
Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume that, in
virtue of occupying one of these positions, individ-
uals in the denotation of a word like ministre (writ-
ten JministreK) acquire a high level of institutional
dominance. For convenience, we will assume that
the level of institutional dominance of ministers is
greater than or equal to 0.7, as shown in (7). This is
materialized by the red line in Figures 5 and 6: all
ministers are by virtue of their function to the right
of that line.

(7) JministreK is a subset of the set of individu-
als that lie in the voronoi polygons associated
with personae whose institutional dominance
exceeds 0.7.

Figure 5: Dominance vs. toughness in 1986: No minister is
sensitive enough to be within the feminine indexical field

We propose that grammatical gender marking
(M/F) also picks out regions: the space associated
with all the personae that have a high level of at least
one of the properties in the indexical field (Burnett,
2017). So the social meaning of masculine g-gender
is the concave region within the cube containing
all the personae that are above the third quartile on

139



Figure 6: Dominance vs. abstraction in 1986: No minister is
pragmatic enough to be within the feminine indexical field

the institutional dominance, abstraction or tough-
ness scales. In the two-dimensional projections of
Figures 5 and 6, this is materialized by the horizon-
tal blue lines: all and only individuals above those
lines are in the masculine indexical field. In 1986,
it happens that there is a strong correlation between
the three dimensions. As a result, 1986 personae
compatible with masculine cluster in the upper right
corners of the two squares in Figures 5 and 6.

Following the analysis in (4), the social meaning
of feminine g-gender corresponds to the concave re-
gion associated with all the personae that are lower
than the first quartile on the dimensions in the in-
dexical field. In the two-dimensional projections of
Figures 5 and 6, this is materialized by the horizon-
tal green lines: all and only individuals below those
lines are in the feminine indexical field. Again, in
1986, having a low value in one dimension predicts
having a low value in other dimensions, so that per-
sonae compatible with the feminine cluster in the
lower left corners of the two squares in Figures 5
and 6.

The ideological structure in 1986 is such that the
space picked out by the indexical field of the femi-
nine is disjoint from JministreK: in both Figure 5 and
Figure 6, the rectangle to the right of the red line and
below the blue line is empty. So, in this model, the
expression la ministre does not pick out a populated
chunk of ideological space; this makes reference to

a woman minister in the feminine very unlikely.
In contrast, in 1998, speakers’ ideological struc-

tures are very different: the lower righthand corner
of the ideological space contains personae who are
both sensitive and pragmatic, but also highly dom-
inant. These are the feminine political personae
described above, who are instantiated by individu-
als like Bachelot and Royal. A model of such an
ideological space is shown in Figure 7: although
the relationship between other dimensions has not
changed (i.e. there is still a correlation between ab-
straction and toughness), there has been a weaken-
ing of the relationship between institutional domi-
nance and the other dimensions.

Figure 7: Ideological structure in the late 1990s (PERS98)

Keeping the same definitions as in the 1986
model, we see that these new personae change the
denotation of ministre and the indexical fields of M
and F. Firstly, JministreK now has more polygons of
personae in its denotation. This is materialized in
the two-dimensional projections in Figures 8 and 9
by having more points to the right of the red line.

Secondly, some of these ministers stand within
the indexical field of the feminine, because they are
very sensitive or pragmatic (Figure 8). Thus, we ob-
serve the following facts comparing the models:

(8) a. JministreK86 \ [F ]86 = Ø.
b. JministreK98 \ [F ]98 6= Ø.

We propose that this difference is what explains that
use of the feminine to refer to a female minister was
just unavailable in 1986 but was possible in 1998.

Also noticeable is the fact that the relevant minis-
ters, by virtue of being dominant, also stand within

140



Figure 8: Dominance vs. toughness in 1998: Some ministers
are sensitive enough to be within the feminine indexical field

Figure 9: Dominance vs. abstraction in 1998: Some ministers
are pragmatic enough to be within the feminine indexical field

the masculine indexical field (the third quartile of
dominance, not materialized in the Figures, is at
0.76, just to the to the right of the red line).

(9) JministreK98 \ [F ]98 \ [M ]98 6= Ø.

This explains why there can be variation in 1998:
both the use of the feminine and the use of the mas-
culine to refer to a female minister convey a relevant
social message.

4 Linking ideology and language use

When it comes to capturing the relationship between
conceptual spaces and communication, the majority
of the work has focused on how multi-dimensional
spaces with prototypes constrain meanings in the
context of signaling games (Jäger, 2007; Jäger and
Van Rooij, 2007; Warglien and Gärdenfors, 2013;
Gärdenfors, 2014). In this paper, we will also use
signaling game architecture combined with an iter-
ated best response solution concept of the kind used
by (Franke, 2009; Frank and Goodman, 2012; Bur-
nett, 2017) and many others. The basic structure of
the game is as follows: the speaker (S) knows the
location of a (female) minister in ideological space
and wishes to communicate that location to the lis-
tener. In order to do this, they choose how they gen-
der mark ministre using the determiner le or la. The
listener (L) hears le/la ministre and updates their be-
liefs with respect to the location of the referent in
their conceptual space. More formally, we represent
each time period as a game as follows:

(10) Model for 1986
G86 = hS, L, hD, sim, PERS86i, M, [·], C, P i:
a. S, L are the players.
b. hD, sim, PERS86i is the ideological space

in Figure 2.
c. M = {le, la} is a set of messages.
d. [·] is an indexation relation mapping each

message to its indexical field.
[le] = [M ]86
[la] = [F ]86

e. C is a cost function assigning a natural
number to each message.

f. P86 is a probability distribution over
{v(p) : p 2 PERS86\JministreK86}, encod-
ing L’s prior beliefs concerning in which
voronoi polygon the referent is located.

(11) Model for 1998
G98 = hS, L, hD, sim, PERS98i, M, [·], C, P i:
a. S, L are the players.
b. hD, sim, PERS98i is the ideological space

in Figure 7.
c. M = {le, la} is a set of messages.
d. [·] is an indexation relation mapping each

message to its indexical field.
[le] = [M ]98

141



[la] = [F ]98
e. C is a cost function assigning a natural

number to each message.
f. P98 is a probability distribution over

{v(p) : p 2 PERS98 \ JministreK98}.

For convenience, we assume that both P86 and
P98 are uniform distributions over {v(p) : p 2
PERS86 \ JministreK86} and {v(p) : p 2 PERS98 \
JministreK98},4 as shown in Tables 1 and 2.

Table 2: L’s prior belief distribution over voronoi polygons as-
sociated with personas in the 1998 model

Following (Frank and Goodman, 2012), we as-
sume that S and L’s actions are calculated based on a
number of steps. When L hears a message, the first
thing they do is condition their prior beliefs on the
meaning of the message, as shown in (12) (for the
1986 model).

(12) P86(v(p)|m) = P86(v(p)\[m])P86([m])
As shown in Table 3, since there are no minis-

ters who are located within the indexical field of
la, P86(v(p)|la) = 0, for all p 2 JministreK86.
However, since there are two personae in [F] in
JministreK98, P86 conditioned under la for these two
personae is 0.5.

4This assumption does not affect our formal results.

0.86 0.05 0.16 0.143 0.5

Table 4: L’s belief distribution over polygons conditioned on
the indexical field associated with a message, in the 1998 model

Again following (Frank and Goodman, 2012), we
assume that speaker utility is calculated based on
message informativity, which is calculated based
on the negative surprisal (positive natural log prob-
ability (Shannon, 1948)) of the prior conditioned on
the the message, minus whatever costs are assigned
to m by C, as shown in (13) (for the 1986 model).

(13) US(v(p), m) = log(P98(v(p)|m)) � C(m)

We will use the cost functions to model the effects of
the language policies.5 Both in 1986 and 1998, we
have two situations: before the policy, where there
no message costs: C(le) = C(la) = 0, and after
the policy, where there is a cost for using the mascu-
line: C(la) = 0, C(le) 6= 0.

To account for variability in action selection, we
assume that the speaker chooses a message based
on the soft-max choice rule (Luce, 1959; Sutton and
Barto, 1998) (14), where � is a parameter governing
how (non)deterministic the choice is.

(14) S(m|v(p)) / exp(� ⇤ US(v(p), m))

5This seems reasonable, given that disobeying the policy has
monetary costs. For example, in 2014, Julien Aubert (UMP)
was required to pay 1378 euros for saying Madame le président.

Results

Our model makes predictions concerning the prob-
ability that the speaker will use le or la to describe
some female minister. Firstly, as shown in Theorem
1, in the 1986 model, where there are no costs put
on the messages (i.e. before Fabius’ policy), we pre-
dict that speakers categorically use the masculine in
the 1986 model. This is due to the fact in (8-a): the
regions picked out by the feminine’s indexical field
are disjoint from where the ministers lie.

Theorem 1 Before Fabius’ policy (1986). Let
C(le) = C(la) = 0. For all (non-1) values for
�, all v(p) 2 PERS86\ JministreK86, S(la|v(p)) = 0
and S(le|v(p)) = 1.6

Furthermore, we show that, with the 1986 ideo-
logical structure, adding costs to the masculine does
not predict an increase in use of the feminine, as
shown in Theorem 2. This is because the calculation
of speaker utility (13) in the RSA model prioritizes
informativity over message costs.

Theorem 2 After Fabius’ policy (1986). Let
C(la) = 0. For all values n 2 N such that
C(le) = n, and for all (non-1) values for �, all
v(p) 2 PERS86 \ JministreK86, S(la|v(p)) = 0 and
S(le|v(p)) = 1.7

On the other hand, in both models for 1998, the
feminine is predicted to be used, particularly to com-
municate that the referent lies close to the new fem-
inine personae. For example, if we set � = 2, for
illustration, we see that use of la to communicate
the polygons in the bottom right corner of the ide-
ological space is predicted to be 0.925 in 1998, as
shown in Table 5.

Dominance Abstraction Toughness le la
0.87 0.11 0.16 0.075 0.925
0.86 0.05 0.16 0.075 0.925

Table 5: Probability of S choosing a message conditioned on
the polygon in which S locates the referent, before policy

6PROOF. Suppose � = n 6= 1 and let p 2 PERS86 \
JministreK86. By Table 3, P86(v(p)|la) = 0, so by (13),
US(v(p), la) = �1. Therefore, by (14), S(la|v(p)) = 0
and S(le|v(p)) = 1. ⌅

7PROOF. Let C(le) = n, � = m and p 2 PERS86 \
JministreK86. Since P86(v(p)|la) = 0 (see proof of Theorem 1,
US(v(p), la) = �1 + 1 = �1. So, by (14), S(la|v(p)) = 0
and S(le|v(p)) = 1. ⌅

Likewise, if we add a cost to using the mascu-
line (say C(le) = 1), the probability of using la in-
creases to 0.971, as shown in Table 6.

Dominance Abstraction Toughness le la
0.87 0.11 0.16 0.029 0.971
0.86 0.05 0.16 0.029 0.971

Table 6: Probability of S choosing a message conditioned on
the polygon in which S locates the referent, after policy

Thus, the model correctly predicts 1) increase of
the feminine from 1986 to 1998, and 2) effectiveness
of language policy in 1998 but not in 1986.

5 Conclusion

We presented a formal model of socially driven
linguistic change that is centered around the rela-
tionship between ideological structure and linguistic
meaning. In our approach, which follows (Foucault,
1976; Butler, 1993; Butler, 1997; Livia and Hall,
1997) among others, social changes and discourse
about them construct and change speaker/listener
ideologies. These ideologies then constrain what
meanings can be assigned to linguistic expres-
sions in the way proposed by (Gärdenfors, 2000;
Gärdenfors, 2014). Expressions’ meanings then de-
termine how they can be used in communication, as
in the Rational Speech Act model.

We used our model to explicitly characterize both
the ideological change in late 1990s and the conse-
quences that this change had on the use of le ministre
vs la ministre. We therefore conclude that frame-
works such as Conceptual Spaces and the RSA are
promising for capturing the link between ideologies
and linguistic production, and that tools from formal
semantics and pragmatics have a role to play in the
study of sociolinguistic phenomena.
