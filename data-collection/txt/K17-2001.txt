Abstract

The CoNLL-SIGMORPHON 2017 shared
task on supervised morphological gener-
ation required systems to be trained and
tested in each of 52 typologically di-
verse languages. In sub-task 1, submit-
ted systems were asked to predict a spe-
cific inflected form of a given lemma. In
sub-task 2, systems were given a lemma
and some of its specific inflected forms,
and asked to complete the inflectional
paradigm by predicting all of the remain-
ing inflected forms. Both sub-tasks in-
cluded high, medium, and low-resource
conditions. Sub-task 1 received 24 system
submissions, while sub-task 2 received 3
system submissions. Following the suc-
cess of neural sequence-to-sequence mod-
els in the SIGMORPHON 2016 shared
task, all but one of the submissions in-
cluded a neural component. The re-
sults show that high performance can be
achieved with small training datasets, so
long as models have appropriate inductive
bias or make use of additional unlabeled
data or synthetic data. However, different
biasing and data augmentation resulted in
non-identical sets of inflected forms being
predicted correctly, suggesting that there is
room for future improvement.

1 Introduction

Morphology interacts with both syntax and
phonology. As a result, explicitly modeling mor-
phology has been shown to aid a number of tasks
in human language technology (HLT), including
machine translation (MT) (Dyer et al., 2008),
speech recognition (Creutz et al., 2007), pars-
ing (Seeker and Çetinoǧlu, 2015), keyword spot-

ting (Narasimhan et al., 2014), and word embed-
ding (Cotterell et al., 2016b). Dedicated systems
for modeling morphological patterns and complex
word forms have received less attention from the
HLT community than tasks that target other levels
of linguistic structure. Recently, however, there
has been a surge of work in this area (Durrett
and DeNero, 2013; Ahlberg et al., 2014; Nico-
lai et al., 2015; Faruqui et al., 2016), represent-
ing a renewed interest in morphology and the po-
tential to use advances in machine learning to
attack a fundamental problem in string-to-string
transformations: the prediction of one morpho-
logically complex word form from another. This
increased interest in morphology as an indepen-
dent set of problems within HLT arrives at a par-
ticularly opportune time, as morphology is also
undergoing a methodological renewal within the-
oretical linguistics where it is moving towards
increased interdisciplinary work and quantitative
methodologies (Moscoso del Prado Martı́n et al.,
2004; Milin et al., 2009; Ackerman et al., 2009;
Sagot and Walther, 2011; Ackerman and Malouf,
2013; Baayen et al., 2013; Blevins, 2013; Pirrelli
et al., 2015; Blevins, 2016). Pushing the HLT re-
search agenda forward in the domain of morphol-
ogy promises to lead to mutually highly beneficial
dialogue between the two fields.

Rich morphology is the norm among the lan-
guages of the world. The linguistic typology
database WALS shows that 80% of the world’s
languages mark verb tense through morphology
while 65% mark grammatical case (Haspelmath
et al., 2005). The more limited inflectional system
of English may help to explain the fact that mor-
phology has received less attention in the compu-
tational literature than it is arguably due.

The CoNLL-SIGMORPHON 2017 shared task
worked to promote the development of robust sys-
tems that can learn to perform cross-linguistically

reliable morphological inflection and morpholog-
ical paradigm cell filling using varying amounts
of training data. We note that this is also the
first CoNLL-hosted shared task to focus on mor-
phology. The task itself featured training and
development data from 52 languages represent-
ing a range of language families. Many of the
languages included were extremely low-resource,
e.g., Quechua, Navajo, and Haida. The chosen
languages also encompassed diverse morpholog-
ical properties and inflection processes. Whenever
possible, three data conditions were given for each
language: low, medium, and high. In the inflec-
tion sub-task, these corresponded to seeing 100
examples, 1,000 examples, and 10,000 examples
respectively in the training data for almost all lan-
guages. The results show that encoder-decoder re-
current neural network models (RNNs) can per-
form very well even with small training sets, if
they are augmented with various mechanisms to
cope with the low-resource setting. The shared
task training, development, and test data are re-
leased publicly.1

2 Task and Evaluation Details

This year’s shared task contained two sub-tasks,
which represented slightly different learning sce-
narios that might be faced by an HLT engineer or
(roughly speaking) a human learner. Beyond man-
ually vetted2 data for training, development and
test, monolingual corpus data (Wikipedia dumps)
was also provided for both of the sub-tasks. Fig-
ure 1 illustrates the two tasks and defines some ter-
minology.

Table 2: Example training and test data from sub-task 2
in Spanish. At training time, the system is provided with
complete paradigms, i.e., tables of all inflections for a given
lemma, like the example at top. At test time, the system is
asked to complete partially filled paradigms, like the example
at bottom; note that the inflectional features for the missing
paradigm cells are provided in the input.

The CoNLL-SIGMORPHON 2017 shared task
is the second shared task in a series that began with
the SIGMORPHON 2016 shared task on morpho-
logical reinflection (Cotterell et al., 2016a). In
contrast to 2016, it happens that both of the 2017
sub-tasks actually involve only inflection, not re-
inflection.3 Nonetheless, we kept “reinflection” in
this year’s title to make it easier to refer to the se-
ries of tasks.

2.1 Sub-Task 1: Inflected Form from Lemma

The first sub-task in Figure 1 required morpholog-
ical generation with sparse training data, some-
thing that can be practically useful for MT and
other downstream tasks in NLP. Here, participants
were given examples of inflected forms as shown
in Table 1. Each test example asked them to
produce some other inflected form when given a
lemma and a bundle of morphosyntactic features.

The training data was sparse in the sense that
it included only a few inflected forms from each
lemma. That is, as in human L1 learning, the
learner does not necessarily observe any complete
paradigms in a language where the paradigms are

3Cotterell et al. (2016a) defined the term: “Systems de-
veloped for the 2016 Shared Task had to carry out reinflec-
tion of an already inflected form. This involved analysis of
an already inflected word form, together with synthesis of a
different inflection of that form.” In 2016, sub-task 1 involved
only inflection while sub-tasks 2–3 required reinflection.

Figure 1: Overview of sub-tasks. Each large rectangle represents a paradigm, i.e., the full set of inflected forms for some
lemma. Each small rectangle within the paradigm is a cell that is associated with a known morphological feature bundle, and
lists a string that either is observed (shaded background) or must be predicted (white background). Sub-task 1 featured sparse
training data and asked systems to inflect individual forms at test time. Sub-task 2 provides dense paradigms as training data
and asks for full paradigm completion of unseen items.

large (e.g., dozens of inflected forms per lemma).4

Key points:

1. Our sub-task 1 is similar to sub-task 1 of the
SIGMORPHON 2016 shared task (Cotterell
et al., 2016a), but with structured inflectional
tags (Sylak-Glassman et al., 2015a), learn-
ing curve assessment, and many new typo-
logically diverse languages, including low-
resource languages.

2. The task is inflection: Given an input lemma
and desired output tag, participants had to
generate the correct output inflected form (a
string).

3. The supervised training data consisted of in-
dividual forms (Table 1) that were sparsely
sampled from a large number of paradigms.

4. Forms that are empirically more frequent
were more likely to appear in both training
and test data (see §3 for details).

5. Unannotated corpus data was also provided
to participants.

6. Systems were evaluated after training on 102,
103, and 104 forms.

4 Of course, human L1 learners do not get to observe ex-
plicit morphological feature bundles for the types that they
observe. Rather, they analyze inflected tokens in context to
discover both morphological features (including inherent fea-
tures such as noun gender (Arnon and Ramscar, 2012)) and
paradigmatic structure (number of forms per lemma, number
of expressed featural contrasts such as tense, number, per-
son. . . ).

2.2 Sub-Task 2: Paradigm Completion

The second sub-task in Figure 1 focused
on paradigm completion, also known as “the
paradigm cell filling problem” (Ackerman et al.,
2009).

Here, participants were given a few complete
inflectional paradigms as training data. At test
time, partially filled paradigms, i.e. paradigms
with significant gaps in them, were to be com-
pleted by filling out the missing cells. Table 2
gives examples.

Thus, sub-task 2 requires predicting many in-
flections of the same lemma. Recall that sub-task
1 also required the system to predict several in-
flections of the same lemma (when they appear
as separate examples in test data). However, in
sub-task 2, one of our test-time evaluation met-
rics (§2.3) is full-paradigm accuracy. Also, the
sub-task 2 training data provides full paradigms,
in contrast to sub-task 1 where it included only
a few inflected forms per lemma. Finally, at test
time, sub-task 2 presents each lemma along with
some of its inflected forms, which is potentially
helpful if the lemma had not appeared previously
in training data.

Apart from the theoretical interest in this prob-
lem (Ackerman and Malouf, 2013), this sub-task
is grounded in the practical problem of extrapola-
tion of basic resources for a language, where only
a few complete paradigms may be available from
a native speaker informant (Sylak-Glassman et al.,
2016) or a reference grammar. L2 classroom in-
struction also asks human students to memorize

3



example paradigms and generalize from them.
Key points:

1. The training data consisted of complete
paradigms.

2. Not all paradigms within a language have the
same shape. A noun lemma will have a dif-
ferent set of cells than a verb lemma does, and
verbs of different classes (e.g., lexically per-
fective vs. imperfective) may also have dif-
ferent sets of cells.

3. The task was paradigm completion: given
a sparsely populated paradigm, participants
should generate the inflected forms (strings)
for all missing cells.

4. The task simulates learning from compiled
grammatical resources and inflection tables,
or learning from a limited time with a native-
language informant in a fieldwork scenario.

5. Three training sets were given, building up in
size from only a few complete paradigms to
a large number (dozens).

2.3 Evaluation
Each team participating in a given sub-task was
asked to submit 156 versions of their system,
where each version was trained using a different
training set (3 training sizes × 52 languages) and
its corresponding development set. We evaluated
each submitted system on its corresponding test
set, i.e., the test set for its language.

We computed three evaluation metrics: (i)
Overall 1-best test-set accuracy, i.e., is the pre-
dicted paradigm cell correct? (ii) average Lev-
enshtein distance, i.e., how badly does the pre-
dicted form disagree with the answer? (iii) Full-
paradigm accuracy, i.e., is the complete paradigm
correct? This final metric only truly makes sense
in sub-task 2, where full paradigms are given
for evaluation. For each sub-task, the three data
conditions (low, medium, and high) resulted in a
learning curve. For each system in each condi-
tion, we report the average metrics across all 52
languages.

3 Data

3.1 Languages
The data for the shared task was highly multilin-
gual, comprising 52 unique languages. Data for 47

of the languages came from the English edition of
Wiktionary, a large multi-lingual crowd-sourced
dictionary containing morphological paradigms
for many lemmata.5 Data for Khaling, Kurmanji
Kurdish, and Sorani Kurdish was created as part
of the Alexina project (Walther et al., 2013, 2010;
Walther and Sagot, 2010).6 Novel data for Haida,
a severely endangered North American language
isolate, was prepared by Jordan Lachler (Univer-
sity of Alberta). The Basque language data was
extracted from a manually designed finite-state
morphological analyzer (Alegria et al., 2009).

The shared task language set is genealogi-
cally diverse, including languages from 10 lan-
guage stocks. Although the majority of the lan-
guages are Indo-European, we also include two
language isolates (Haida and Basque) along with
languages from Athabaskan (Navajo), Kartvelian
(Georgian), Quechua, Semitic (Arabic, Hebrew),
Sino-Tibetan (Khaling), Turkic (Turkish), and
Uralic (Estonian, Finnish, Hungarian, and North-
ern Sami). The shared task language set is also
diverse in terms of morphological structure, with
languages which use primarily prefixes (Navajo),
suffixes (Quechua and Turkish), and a mix, with
Spanish exhibiting internal vowel variations along
with suffixes and Georgian using both infixes and
suffixes. The language set also exhibits features
such as templatic morphology (Arabic, Hebrew),
vowel harmony (Turkish, Finnish, Hungarian),
and consonant harmony (Navajo) which require
systems to learn non-local alternations. Finally,
the resource level of the languages in the shared
task set varies greatly, from major world languages
(e.g. Arabic, English, French, Spanish, Russian)
to languages with few speakers (e.g. Haida, Khal-
ing).

3.2 Data Format

For each language, the basic data consists of
triples of the form (lemma, feature bundle, in-
flected form), as in Table 1. The first feature in
the bundle always specifies the core part of speech
(e.g., verb). All features in the bundle are coded
according to the UniMorph Schema, a cross-
linguistically consistent universal morphological
feature set (Sylak-Glassman et al., 2015a,b).

3.3 Extraction from Wiktionary

For each of the 47 Wiktionary languages, Wik-
tionary provides a number of tables, each of which
specifies the full inflectional paradigm for a par-
ticular lemma. These tables were initially ex-
tracted via a multi-dimensional table parsing strat-
egy (Kirov et al., 2016; Sylak-Glassman et al.,
2015a).

As noted in §2.2, different paradigms may have
different shapes. To prepare the shared task data,
each language’s parsed tables from Wiktionary
were grouped according to their tabular structure
and number of cells. Each group represents a dif-
ferent type of paradigm (e.g., verb). We used only
groups with a large number of lemmata, relative
to the number of lemmata available for the lan-
guage as a whole. For each group, we associated a
feature bundle with each cell position in the table,
by manually replacing the prose labels describ-
ing grammatical features (e.g. “accusative case”)
with UniMorph features (e.g. acc). This allowed
us to extract triples as described in the previous
section.

By applying this process across the 47 lan-
guages, we constructed a large multilingual
dataset that refines the parsed tables from previ-
ous work. This dataset was sampled to create
appropriately-sized data for the shared task, as de-
scribed in §3.4.7 Full and sampled dataset sizes by
language are given in Table 3.

Systematic syncretism is collapsed in Wik-
tionary. For example, in English, feature bun-
dles do not distinguish between different per-
son/number forms of past tense verbs, because
they are identical.8 Thus, the past-tense form
went appears only once in the table for go, not
six times, and gives rise to only one triple, whose
feature bundle specifies past tense but not person
and number.

3.4 Sampling the Train-Dev-Test Splits

From each language’s collection of paradigms,
we sampled the training, development, and
test sets as follows. These datasets can be
obtained from http://www.sigmorphon.
org/conll2017.

7Full, unsampled Wiktionary parses are made available at
unimorph.org on a rolling basis.

8In this example, Wiktionary omits the single exception:
the lemma be distinguishes between past tenses was and
were.

Our first step was to construct probability distri-
butions over the (lemma, feature bundle, inflected
form) triples in our full dataset. For each triple,
we counted how many tokens the inflected form
has in the February 2017 dump of Wikipedia for
that language. Note that this simple “string match”
heuristic overestimates the count, since strings are
ambiguous: not all of the counted tokens actually
render that feature bundle.9

From these counts, we estimated a unigram
distribution over triples, using Laplace smooth-
ing (add-1 smoothing). We then sampled 12000
triples without replacement from this distribution.
The first 100 were taken as the low-resource train-
ing set for sub-task 1, the first 1000 as the medium-
resource training set, and the first 10000 as the
high-resource training set. Note that these training
sets are nested, and that the highest-count triples
tend to appear in the smaller training sets.

The final 2000 triples were randomly shuffled
and then split in half to obtain development and
test sets of 1000 forms each. The final shuffling
was performed to ensure that the development set
is similar to the test set. By contrast, the devel-
opment and test sets tend to contain lower-count
triples than the training set.10 In those languages
where we have less than 12000 total forms, we
omit the high-resource training set (all languages
have at least 3000 forms).

To sample the data for sub-task 2, we per-
form a similar procedure. For each paradigm
in our full dataset, we counted the number of
tokens in Wikipedia that matched any of the
inflected forms in the paradigm. From these
counts, we estimated a unigram distribution over
paradigms, using Laplace smoothing. We sam-
pled 300 paradigms without replacement from this

9For example, in English, any token of the string walked
will be double-counted as both the past tense and the past
participle of the lemma walk. This problem holds for all
regular English verbs. Similarly, when we are counting the
present-tense tokens lay of the lemma lay, we will also
include tokens of the string lay that are actually the past
tense of lie, or are actually the adjective or noun senses
of lay. The alternative to double-counting each ambiguous
token would have been to use EM to split the token’s count
of 1 unequally among its possible analyses, in proportion to
their estimated prior probabilities (Cotterell et al., 2015).

10This is a realistic setting, since supervised training is
usually employed to generalize from frequent words that ap-
pear in annotated resources to less frequent words that do not.
Unsupervised learning methods also tend to generalize from
more frequent words (which can be analyzed more easily by
combining information from many contexts) to less frequent
ones.

distribution. The low-resource training sets con-
tain the first 10 paradigms, the medium-resource
training set contains the first 50, and high-resource
training set contains the first 200. Again, these
training sets are nested. Note that since differ-
ent languages have paradigms of different sizes,
the actual number of training exemplars may dif-
fer drastically.

With the same motivation as before, we shuffled
the remaining 100 forms and took the first 50 as
development and the next 50 as test. (In those lan-
guages with fewer than 300 forms, we again omit-
ted the high-resource training setting.) For each
development or test paradigm, we chose about 15
of the slots to provide to the system as input along
with the lemma, asking the system to predict the
remaining 45 . We determined which cells to keep
by independently flipping a biased coin with prob-
ability 0.2 for each cell.

Because of the count overestimates mentioned
above, our sub-task 1 dataset overrepresents triples
where the inflected form (the answer) is ambigu-
ous, and our sub-task 2 dataset overrepresents
paradigms that contain ambiguous inflected forms.
The degree of ambiguity varied among languages:
the average number of triples per inflected form
string ranged from 1.00 in Sorani to 2.89 in Khal-
ing, with an average of 1.43 across all languages.
Despite this distortion of true unigram counts, we
believe that our datasets captured a sufficiently
broad sample of the feature combinations for ev-
ery language.

4 Previous Work

Most recent work in inflection generation has fo-
cused on sub-task 1, i.e., generating inflected
forms from the lemma. Numerous, methodolog-
ically diverse approaches have been published.
We highlight a representative sample of recent
work. Durrett and DeNero (2013) heuristically
extracted transformation rules and trained a semi-
Markov model (Sarawagi and Cohen, 2004) to
learn when to apply them to the input. Nico-
lai et al. (2015) trained a discriminative string-to-
string monotonic transduction tool—DIRECTL+
(Jiampojamarn et al., 2008)—to generate inflec-
tions. Ahlberg et al. (2014) reduced the prob-
lem to multi-class classification, where they used
finite-state techniques to first generalize inflec-
tional patterns and then trained a feature-rich clas-
sifier to choose the optimal such pattern to inflect

unseen words (Ahlberg et al., 2015). Finally, Mal-
ouf (2016), Faruqui et al. (2016) and Kann and
Schütze (2016) proposed a neural-based sequence-
to-sequence models (Sutskever et al., 2014), with
Kann and Schütze making use of an attention
mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2015). Overall, the
neural approaches have generally been found to be
the most successful.

Some work has also focused on scenarios sim-
ilar to sub-task 2. For example, Dreyer and
Eisner (2009) modeled the distribution over the
paradigms of a language as a Markov Random
Field (MRF), where each cell is represented as a
string-valued random variable. The MRF’s fac-
tors are specified as weighted finite-state machines
of the form given by Dreyer et al. (2008). Build-
ing upon this, Cotterell et al. (2015) proposed us-
ing a Bayesian network where both lemmata (re-
peated within a paradigm) and affixes (repeated
across paradigms) were encoded as string-valued
random variables. That work required its finite-
state transducers to take a more restricted form
(Cotterell et al., 2014) for computational reasons.
Finally, Kann et al. (2017a) proposed a multi-
source sequence-to-sequence network, allowing a
neural transducer to exploit multiple source forms
simultaneously.

SIGMORPHON 2016 Shared Task. Last year,
the SIGMORPHON 2016 shared task (http://
sigmorphon.org/sharedtask) focused on
10 languages (including 2 surprise languages). As
for the present 2017 task, most of the 2016 data
was derived from Wiktionary. The 2016 shared
task had submissions from 9 competing teams
with members from 11 universities. As mentioned
in §2.1, our sub-task 1 is an extension of sub-task
1 from 2016. The other sub-tasks in 2016 focused
on the more general reinflection problem, where
systems had to learn to map from any inflected
form to any other with varying degrees of anno-
tations. See Cotterell et al. (2016a) for details.

5 The Baseline System

The shared task provided a baseline system to
participants that addressed both tasks and all lan-
guages. The system was designed for speed of ap-
plication and also for adequate accuracy with little
training data, in particular in the low and medium
data conditions. The design of the baseline was in-
spired by the University of Colorado’s submission
(Liu and Mao, 2016) to the SIGMORPHON 2016

Table 3: Total number of lemmata and forms available for sampling, and number of distinct lemmata present in each data
condition in Task 1. For almost all languages, these were spread across 10000,1000, and 100 forms in the High, Medium, and
Low conditions, respectively, and 1000 forms in each Dev and Test set. For †-marked languages, there was not enough total
data to support these numbers. Bengali had 4423 forms in the High condition, and Dev and Test sets of 100 forms each. Haida
had 6840 forms in the High condition and Dev and Test sets of 100 forms. Scottish Gaelic had no High condition, a Medium
condition of 681 forms, and Dev and Test sets of 50 forms each. The three last columns indicate how many inflected forms
have undergone changes in a prefix (Pr), a change in a suffix (Su), or a stem-internal change (Ap) versus the given lemma form.

Table 4: Quantity of data available in sub-task 2. For each
possible part of speech in each language, we present the
range in the number of forms that comprise a paradigm as
an indication of the difficulty of the task of forming a full
paradigm. These ranges were computed using the data in the
Train Medium condition.

shared task.

5.1 Alignment
For each (lemma, feature bundle, inflected form)
triple in training data, the system initially aligns
the lemma with the inflected form by finding the
minimum-cost edit path. Costs are computed with
a weighted scheme such that substitutions have a
slightly higher cost (1.1) than insertions or dele-
tions (1.0). For example, the German training data
pair schielen-geschielt ‘to squint’ (going
from the lemma to the past participle) is aligned
as:

--schielen
geschielt-

The system now assumes that each aligned pair
can be broken up into a prefix, stem and a suffix,
based on where the inputs or outputs have initial
or trailing blanks after alignment. We assume that
initial or trailing blanks in either input or output
reflect boundaries between a prefix and a stem, or
a stem and a suffix. This allows us to divide each
training example into three parts. Using the exam-
ple above, the pairs would be aligned as follows,
after padding the edges with $-symbols:

prefix stem suffix
$ schiele n$

$ge schielt $

5.2 Inflection Rules
From this alignment, the system extracts a prefix-
changing rule based on the prefix pairing, as well
as a set of suffix-changing rules based on suf-
fixes of the stem+suffix pairing. The example
alignment above yields the eight extracted suffix-
modifying rules

n$→ $ ielen$→ ielt$
en$→ t$ hielen$→ hielt$
len$→ lt$ chielen$→ chielt$
elen$→ elt$ schielen$→ schielt$

as well as the prefix-modifying rule $→ $ge.
Since these rules were obtained from the triple

(schielen, V;V.PTCP;PST, geschielt),
they are associated with a token of the feature bun-
dle V;V.PTCP;PST.

5.3 Generation
At test time, to inflect a lemma with features,
the baseline system applies rules associated with

training tokens of the precise feature bundle.
There is no generalization across bundles that
share features.

Specifically, the longest-matching suffix rule
associated with the feature bundle is consulted and
applied to the input form. Ties are broken by fre-
quency, in favor of the rule that has occurred most
often with this feature bundle. After this, the pre-
fix rule that occurred most often with the bundle is
likewise applied. That is, the prefix-matching rule
has no longest-match preference, while the suffix-
matching rule does.

For example, to inflect kaufen ‘to buy’ with
the features V;V.PTCP;PST, using the single ex-
ample above as training data, we would find that
the longest matching stored suffix-rule is en$ →
t$, which would transform kaufen into an in-
termediate form kauft, after which the most fre-
quent prefix-rule, $ → $ge would produce the
final output gekauft. If no rules have been as-
sociated with a particular feature bundle (as often
happens in the low data condition), the inflected
form is simply taken to be a copy of the lemma.

In sub-task 2, paradigm completion, the base-
line system simply repeats the sub-task 1 method
and generates all the missing forms independently
from the lemma. It does not take advantage of the
other forms that are presented in the partially filled
paradigm.

In addition to the above, the baseline system

uses a heuristic to place a language into one of
two categories: largely prefixing or largely suffix-
ing. Some languages, such as Navajo, are largely
prefixing and have more complex changes in the
left periphery of the input rather than at the right.
However, in the method described above, the op-
eration of the prefix rules is more restricted than
that of the suffix rules: prefix rules tend to per-
form no change at all, or insert or delete a prefix.
For largely prefixing languages, the method per-
forms better when operating with reversed strings.
Classifying a language into prefixing or suffixing
is done by simply counting how often there is a
prefix change vs. suffix change in going from the
lemma form to the inflected form in the training
data. Whenever a language is found to be largely
prefixing, the system works with reversed strings
throughout to allow more expressive changes in
the left edge of the input.

6 System Descriptions

The CoNLL-SIGMORPHON 2017 shared task re-
ceived submissions from 11 teams with members
from 15 universities and institutes (Table 5). Many
of the teams submitted more than one system,
yielding a total of 25 unique systems entered in-
cluding the baseline system.

In contrast to the 2016 shared task, all but one
of the submitted systems included a neural com-
ponent. Despite the relative uniformity of the sub-

mitted architectures, we still observed large differ-
ences in the individual performances. Rather than
differences in architecture, a major difference this
year was the various methods for supplying the
neural network with auxiliary training data. For
ease of presentation, we break down the systems
into the features of their system (see Table 6) and
discuss the systems that had those features. In all
cases, further details of the methods can be found
in the system description papers, which are cited
in Table 5.

Neural Parameterization. All systems except
for the EHU team employed some form of a neu-
ral network. Moreover, all teams except for SU-
RUG, which employed a convolutional neural net-
work, made use of some form of gated recurrent
network—either a gated recurrent network (GRU)
(Chung et al., 2014) or long short-term memory
(LSTM) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997). In
these neural models, a common strategy was to
feed in the morphological tag of the form to be
predicted along with the input into the network,
where each subtag was its own symbol.

Hard Alignment versus Soft Attention. An-
other axis, along which the systems differ is the
use of hard alignment, over soft attention. The
neural attention mechanism was introduced in
Bahdanau et al. (2015) for neural machine transla-
tion (NMT). In short, these mechanisms avoid the
necessity of encoding the input word into a fixed
length vector, by allowing the decoder to attend to
different parts of the inputs. Just as in NMT, the
attention mechanism has led to large gains in mor-

phological inflection. The CMU, CU, IIT (BHU),
LMU, UE-LMU, UF and UTNII systems all em-
ployed such mechanisms.

An alternative to soft attention is hard, mono-
tonic alignment, i.e., a neural parameterization
of a traditional finite-state transduction system.
These systems enforce a monotonic alignment be-
tween source and target forms. In the 2016 shared
task (see Cotterell et al., 2016a, Table 6) such a
system placed second (Aharoni et al., 2016), and
this year’s winning system—CLUZH—was an ex-
tension of that one. (See, also, Aharoni and Gold-
berg (2017) for a further explication of the tech-
nique and Rastogi et al. (2016) for discussion of
a related neural parameterization of a weighted
finite-state machine.) Their system allows for ex-
plicit biasing towards a copy action that appears
useful in the low-resource setting. Despite its neu-
ral parameterization, the CLUZH system is most
closely related to the systems of UA and EHU,
which train weighted finite-state transducers, al-
beit with a log-linear parameterization.

Reranking. Reranking the output of a weaker
system was a tack taken by two systems: ISI
and UA. The ISI system started with a heuristi-
cally induced candidate set, using the edit tree ap-
proach described by Chrupała et al. (2008), and
then chose the best edit tree. This approach is
effectively a neuralized version of the lemma-
tizer proposed in Müller et al. (2015) and, indeed,
was originally intended for that task (Chakrabarty
et al., 2017). The UA team, following their 2016
submission, proposed a linear reranking on top of
the k-best output of their transduction system.

Data Augmentation. Many teams made use of
auxiliary training data—unlabeled or synthetic
forms. Some teams leveraged the provided
Wikipedia corpora (see §3). The UE-LMU team
used these unlabeled corpora to bias their meth-
ods towards copying by transducing an unlabeled
word to itself. The same team also explored a sim-
ilar setup that instead learned to transduce random
strings to themselves, and found that using ran-
dom strings worked almost as well as words that
appeared in unlabeled corpora. CMU used a varia-
tional autoencoder and treated the tags of unanno-
tated words in the Wikipedia corpus as latent vari-
ables (see Zhou and Neubig (2017b) for more de-
tails). Other teams attempted to get silver-standard
labels for the unlabeled corpora. For example,

the UA team trained a tagger on the given train-
ing examples, and then tagged the corpus with the
goal to obtain additional instances, while the UE-
LMU team used a series of unsupervised heuris-
tics. The CU team—which did not make use of ex-
ternal resources—hallucinated more training data
by identifying suffix and prefix changes in the
given training pairs and then using that informa-
tion to create new artificial training pairs. The
LMU submission also experimented with hand-
written rules to artificially generate more data. It
seems likely that the primary difference in the per-
formance of the various neural systems lay in these
strategies for the creation of new data to train the
parameters, rather than in the neural architectures
themselves.

Three teams exploited external resources in
some form: UA, CMU, and UE-LMU. In gen-
eral, any relative performance gained was mini-
mal. The CMU system was outranked by sev-
eral systems that avoided external resource use in
the High and Medium conditions in which it com-
peted. UE-LMU only submitted a system that
used additional resources in the Medium condi-
tion, and saw gains of ∼%1 compared to their ba-
sic system, while it was still outranked overall by
CLUZH. In the Low condition, UA saw gains of
∼%3 using external data. However, all UA sub-
missions were limited to a small handful of lan-
guages.

All but one of the systems submitted were neu-
ral. As expected given the results from SIGMOR-
PHON 2016, these systems perform very well
when in the High training condition where data
is relatively plentiful. In the Low and Medium
conditions, however, standard encoder-decoder ar-
chitectures perform worse than the baseline us-
ing only the training data provided. Teams that
beat the baseline succeeded by biasing networks
towards the correct solutions through pre-training
on synthetic data designed to capture the overall
inflectional patterns in a language. As seen in Ta-
ble 9, these techniques worked better for some lan-
guages than for others. Languages with smaller,
more regular paradigms were handled well (e.g.,

90%). Languages with more complex systems,
like Latin, proved more challenging (the best sys-
tem achieved only 19% accuracy in the low con-
dition). For these languages, it is possible that the
relevant variation required to learn a best per-form
inflectional pattern was simply not present in the
limited training data, and that a language-specific
learning bias was required.

Even though the top-ranked systems do well
on their own, different systems may contain some
amount of complementary information, so that an
ensemble over multiple approaches has a chance
to improve accuracy. We present an upper bound
on the possible performance of such an ensemble.
Table 7 and Table 8 include an “Ensemble Oracle”
system (oracle-e) that gives the correct answer if
any of the submitted systems is correct. The ora-
cle performs significantly better than any one sys-
tem in both the Medium (∼10%) and Low (∼15%)
conditions. This suggests that the different strate-
gies used by teams to “bias” their systems in an
effort to make up for sparse data lead to substan-
tially different generalization patterns.

For sub-task 1, we also present a second “Fea-
ture Combination” Oracle (oracle-fc) that gives
the correct answer for a given test triple iff its fea-
ture bundle appeared in training (with any lemma).
Thus, oracle-fc provides an upper bound on the
performance of systems that treat a feature bundle
such as V;SBJV;FUT;3;PL as atomic. In the low-
data condition, this upper bound was only 71%,
meaning that 29% of the test bundles had never
been seen in training data. Nonetheless, systems
should be able to make some accurate predictions
on this 29% by decomposing each test bundle into
individual morphological features such as FUT
(future) and PL (plural), and generalizing from
training examples that involve those features. For
example, a particular feature or sub-bundle might
be realized as a particular affix. Several of the
systems treated each individual feature as a sep-
arate input to the recurrent network, in order to
enable this type of generalization. In the medium
data condition for some languages, these systems
sometimes far surpassed oracle-fc. The most no-
table example of this is Basque, where oracle-fc
produced a 47% accuracy while six of the sub-
mitted systems produced an accuracy of 85% or
above. Basque is an extreme example with very
large paradigms for the verbs that inflect in the lan-
guage (only a few dozen common ones do). This

result demonstrates the ability of the neural sys-
tems to generalize and correctly inflect according
to unseen feature combinations.

8 Future Directions

As regards morphological inflection, there is a
plethora of future directions to consider. First,
one might consider morphological transductions
over pronunciations, rather than spellings. This
is more challenging in the many languages (in-
cluding English) where the orthography does not
reflect the phonological changes that accompany
morphological processes such as affixation. Or-
thography usually also does not reflect predictable
allophonic distinctions in pronunciation (Samp-
son, 1985), which one might attempt to predict,
such as the difference in aspiration of /t/ in English
[thAp] (top) vs. [stAp] (stop).

A second future direction involves the effec-
tive incorporation of external unannotated mono-
lingual corpora into the state-of-the-art inflection
or reinflection systems. The best systems in our
competition did not make use of external data and
those that did make heavy use of such data, e.g.,
the CMU team, did not see much gain. The best
way to use external corpora remains an open ques-
tion; we surmise that they can be useful, especially
in the lower-resource cases. A related line of in-
quiry is the incorporation of cross-lingual infor-
mation, which Kann et al. (2017b) did find to be
helpful.

A third direction revolves around the efficient
elicitation of morphological information (i.e., ac-
tive learning). In the low-resource section, we
asked our participants to find the best approach to
generate new forms given existing morphological
annotation. However, it remains an open question,
which of the cells in a paradigm are best to collect
annotation for in the first place. Likely, it is better
to collect diagnostic forms that are closer to princi-
pal parts of the paradigm (Finkel and Stump, 2007;
Ackerman et al., 2009; Montermini and Bonami,
2013; Cotterell et al., 2017) as these will con-
tain enough information such that the remaining
transformations are largely deterministic. Experi-
mental studies however suggest that speakers also
strongly rely on pattern frequencies for inferring
unknown forms (Seyfarth et al., 2014). Another
interesting direction would therefore also include
the organization of data according to plausible real
frequency distributions (especially in spoken data)

13



and exploring possibly varying learning strategies
associated with lexical items of various frequen-
cies.

Finally, there is a wide variety of other tasks
involving morphology. While some of these
have had a shared task, e.g., the parsing of
morphologically-rich languages (Tsarfaty et al.,
2010) and unsupervised morphological segmenta-
tion (Kurimo et al., 2010), many have not, e.g.,
supervised morphological segmentation and mor-
phological tagging. A key purpose of shared
tasks in the NLP community is the preparation
and release of standardized data sets for fair com-
parison among methods. Future shared tasks in
other areas of computational morphology would
seem in order, giving the overall effectiveness of
shared tasks in unifying research objectives in sub-
fields of NLP, and as a starting point for possible
cross-over with cognitively-grounded theoretical
and quantitative linguistics.

9 Conclusion

The CoNLL-SIGMORPHON shared task pro-
vided an evaluation on 52 languages, with large
and small datasets, of systems for inflection and
paradigm completion—two core tasks in compu-
tational morphological learning. On sub-task 1
(inflection), 24 systems were submitted, while on
sub-task 2 (paradigm completion), 3 systems were
submitted. All but one of the systems used rather
similar neural network models, popularized by the
SIGMORPHON shared task in 2016.

The results reinforce the conclusions of the
2016 shared task that encoder-decoder architec-
tures perform strongly when training data is plen-
tiful, with exact-match accuracy on held-out forms
surpassing 90% on many languages; we note there
was a shortage of non-neural systems this year to
compare with. In addition, and contrary to com-
mon expectation, many participants showed that
neural systems can do reasonably well even with
small training datasets. A baseline sequence-to-
sequence model achieves close to zero accuracy:
e.g., Silfverberg et al. (2017) reported that all the
team’s neural models on the low data condition
delivered accuracies in the 0-1% range without
data augmentation, and other teams reported sim-
ilar findings. However, with judicious applica-
tion of biasing and data augmentation techniques,
the best neural systems achieved over 50% exact-
match prediction of inflected form strings on 100

examples, and 80% on 1,000 examples, as com-
pared to 38% for a baseline system that learns sim-
ple inflectional rules. It is hard to say whether
these are “good” results in an absolute sense. An
interesting experiment would be to pit the small-
data systems against human linguists who do not
know the languages, to see whether the systems
are able to identify the predictive patterns that hu-
mans discover (or miss).

An oracle ensembling of all systems shows that
there is still much room for improvement, in par-
ticular in low-resource settings. We have released
the training, development, and test sets, and expect
these datasets to provide a useful benchmark for
future research into learning of inflectional mor-
phology and string-to-string transduction.

A Detailed Results

This section contains detailed results for each submitted system on each language. Systems are ordered
by average per-form accuracy for each sub-task and data condition. Three metrics are presented for each
system/language combination.

1. Per-Form Accuracy: Percentage of test forms inflected correctly.

2. Levenshtein Distance: Average Levenshtein distance of system-predicted form from gold inflected
form.

3. Per-Paradigm Accuracy: Percentage of unique lemmata (paradigms) for which every form was
inflected correctly.

Scores in bold include the highest scoring non-oracle system for each language as well as any other sys-
tems that did not differ significantly in terms of per-form accuracy according to a sign test (p >= 0.05).
Scores marked with a † indicate submissions that were significantly better than the feature combination
oracle (p < 0.05), showing per-feature generalization. Scores marked with ‡ did not differ significantly
from the ensemble oracle, suggesting minimal complementary information across systems.
