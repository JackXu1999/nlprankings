Sarcasm is a form of verbal irony that is intended to
express contempt or ridicule. Often quoted as a chal-
lenge to sentiment analysis, sarcasm involves use of
words of positive or no polarity to convey negative sen-
timent. Incongruity has been observed to be at the heart
of sarcasm understanding in humans. Our work in sar-
casm detection identifies different forms of incongruity
and employs different machine learning techniques to
capture them. This talk will describe the approach,
datasets and challenges in sarcasm detection using dif-
ferent forms of incongruity.

We identify two forms of incongruity: incongruity
which can be understood based on the target text
and common background knowledge, and incongruity
which can be understood based on the target text and
additional, specific context. The former involves use of
sentiment-based features, word embeddings, and topic
models. The latter involves creation of author’s histor-
ical context based on their historical data, and creation
of conversational context for sarcasm detection of dia-
logue.
