Abstract

This paper presents an approach to the annotation of quantification, developed in the context of
an ISO project aiming to define standards for semantic annotation. The approach is illustrated for a
range of quantification phenomena, including cumulative, collective, and group quantification.

1 Introduction

In 2012, two ISO standards for semantic annotation were established, one for time and events (ISO
24617-1), and one for dialogue acts (ISO 24617-2); others are under development for semantic roles,
spatial information, and discourse relations. Quantification turns up as a problem in nearly all of these
efforts. ISO 24617-1 has some provisions for dealing with quantification (see Pustejovsky et al., 2010),
but these are too limited and do not always give correct results (Bunt and Pustejovsky, 2010).

The annotation of quantification faces three main issues:

1. Which set of semantic features, expressed most likely as XML attributes and values, adequately
characterize a wide range of forms of quantification;

2. Is it possible to define a formal semantics of these expressions;
3. How can the relevant features (attributes and values) be defined as components of the semantic

annotations in a way that respects compositional semantics?

Bunt ( 2005) proposed a way to representing quantifications in terms of feature structures, however,
in this proposal the properties of a quantification are all expressed as properties of an event, which is
inconvenient for annotators and is hard to combine with a compositional NP semantics. This paper
presents an approach where quantification features are distributed over annotation structure components
in a way that corresponds to their linguistic expression in syntactic structures, and shows the semantic
adequacy of the proposal by a compositional translation into discourse representation structures.

2 Aspects of quantification

Quantification occurs when a predicate is applied to sets of arguments. Questions then arise concerning
the precise way that the predicate is applied to members of these sets. As an example, consider the
sentence (1a); some of the questions that may be asked (and answered) are (1b) - (1f):

(1) a. Although a threat had been made before, three men rather unexpectedly moved both pianos.
b. How many men were involved? (Answer: Three.)
c. How many pianos were involved? (Answer: Two.)
d. Did the same men move both pianos? (Answer: Yes.)
e. Did the men act collectively or individually? (Answer: Collectively, probably.)
f. Were the pianos acted upon collectively or individually? (Answer: Individually, probably.)



Given the restriction part of a quantification, that specifies a domain from which elements can be
taken that participate in certain events individually, in groups, or collectively, the distribution is a function
that computes the set of those entities that participate in the events as agents, as themes, as instruments,
etc. We call such a set of participants a predication domain, and the domain, defined by the restriction,
the reference domain. In the case of individual distribution, the two are the same.

A common function of proportional quantifier words like all, some, and most, and of absolute quanti-
fiers like three, more than five, 2 litres of is to specify the fraction of the reference domain that is involved
in the events under consideration. Numerical and amount quantifiers may also be used to indicate the
size of a reference domain, like twelve in The twelve students in this room all speak two languages.

Proportional and absolute quantifiers can also be used to indicate the number/amount of a predication
domain per element of another predication domain, like five in Each of the dogs ate five sausages.

Some of the most important aspects of quantification, distinguished in (Bunt, 1985) are:

(2) 1. the quantifier’s restriction, describing the reference domain of the quantification;
2. the distribution, defining the predication domain;
3. size of the reference domain;
4. involvement of the reference domain (in absolute or relative terms);
5. relative scoping of the quantifications associated with argument NPs;
6. scoping of NP-quantifications relative to quantified events;
7. size of groups of elements from a reference domain;
8. number of elements of a reference domain involved per element of a predication domain.

3 Events, participants, and quantification annotation

In a davidsonian approach to meaning, we may view the combination of a verb with its arguments
as introducing a set of events (‘eventualities’, more generally) of the type indicated by the verb, and
with a number of properties concerning the way in which the participants of these events are involved.
Applying this view to sentence (1a), we obtain a descriptions in terms of a set of move-events, a set
of men, participating in these events as agents, and a set of pianos that participate as themes. This is
exactly what is expressed in an annotation of semantic roles according to the ISO standard 24617-4
under development (see Bunt & Palmer, 2013):

(3)

[v1:] <event xml:id="e1" target="#m2" eventType="move"/>
[p1:] <participant xml:id="x1" target="#m1" entityType="man"/>
[p2:] <participant xml:id="x2" target="#m3" entityType="piano"/>
[L1:] <srLink event="#e1" participant="#x1" semRole="agent"/>
[L2:] <srLink event="#e1" participant="#x2" semRole="theme"/>

Since quantification occurs when two or more sets of arguments are related by a predicate, we can view
the quantifications in (1a) as due to the Agent and Theme predicate relating sets of events and partici-
pants. This information can thus be represented as properties of the semantic role links (<srLink>),
adding features to these links as follows, where the feature @signature="set" expresses that the
sentence is about sets of events and participants :

(4)

[v1:] <event xml:id="e1" target="#m2" eventType="move" signature="set"/>
[p1:] <participant xml:id="x1" target="#m1" entityType="man”

signature ="set" involvement="3"/>
[p2:] <participant xml:id="x2" target="#m3" entityType="piano"

signature ="set" definiteness="def" involvement="2"/>
[L1:] <srLink event="#e1" participant="#x1" semRole="agent"/>

distribution="collective"/>
[L2:] <srLink event="#e1" participant="#x2" semRole="theme"

distribution="individual"/>

The correctness and usefulness of annotating quantification this way depends on how well it deals
with the three issues mentioned in Section 1: expressive adequacy of attributes and values; their semantic
adequacy; and compatibility with compositional phrase semantics. These issues are addressed next.



4 Representational and semantic adequacy

Of the information types listed in (2), those numbered 1, 2, 4, and 8 can be represented by the attributes
and values shown in (4). For types 3, 5, 6 and 7, the attribute @cardinality is defined for <event>
(for “say twice” etc.) and <participant> elements; the attribute @outScoping allows the expres-
sion of relative scope restrictions; and the values of the @groupCard attribute can be used to indicate
group sizes in group quantifications. This provides the expressive power to represent a wide range of
quantification phenomena.

The issue of compatibility with compositional NP semantics arises because we propose to represent
some of the properties of a quantification as parts of semantic role links, where traditionally the semantic
representation of quantification is considered to be part of NP semantics. This is in particular the case
with distribution, as in (4). Having @distribution as an attribute of <participant> elements
would run into problems for a sentence such as The men had a beer before they moved the piano, where
the subject NP should be interpreted individually for the drinking, but collectively for the lifting.

The semantic adequacy of the proposed annotation format can be shown by defining a systematic
translation of annotations into DRSs, following Bunt (2011; 2013). XML elements describing sets of
events or participants, like those in (4), are translated to a DRS which introduces a higher-order (i.e.
set-valued) discourse marker,1 and conditions translating the other features. DRSs interpreting linking
elements introduce discourse markers for the linked sets of elements, and conditions that further charac-
terize the link, e.g.:

[v1:]; 〈{E1},{〈〈{e},{e ∈ E1}〉 ⇒ 〈{},{move(e)}〉〉}〉, or in box form:
E1

e

e ∈ E ⇒ MOVE(e)

[p1]: ;

X

card(X)=3
x

x ∈ X ⇒ MAN(x)

[L1:];

E, X

e

e ∈ E ⇒ AGENT(e,X)

The merge of these DRSs plus those translating [p2] and [L2] yields the satisfactory result:2

[p1 ∪ L1] ∪ [p2 ∪ L2] ∪ v1 =

E, X , Y

card(X)=3 card(Y )=2

e

e ∈ E ⇒ MOVE(e)
AGENT(e,X)

y

y ∈ Y ⇒

e

e ∈ E
PIANOcr(y)
THEME(e,y)

x

x ∈ X ⇒ MAN(x)

Note that in this example both NPs outscope the verb; their relative scoping is irrelevant since the group
of three men acted collectively, as a single entity. While verbs very often have narrow scope relative to
argument NPs, this is not always the case, as (5) illustrates. Using the attributes and values introduced
so far, the wide-scope interpretation of “die” is easily annotated:3

(5) a. Everybody will die.
b. Annotation for wide-scope ‘die’:

1The presentation is simplified here; see Bunt (2013) for the use of pairs 〈m,x〉 of markables and discourse markers, where
the markables make sure that only the intended marker variables are unified upon DRS-merging.

2The subscript ‘cr’ (for ‘contextually relevant’) indicates the interpretation of the definiteness of the NP both pianos.
3We assume here an approach to semantic roles which allows an event to have more than one theme, such as the LIRICS

annotation scheme (Petukhova & Bunt, 2007).



[v1:] <event xml:id="e1" target="#m1" eventType="die" signature="set"
cardinality="1"/>

[p1:] <participant xml:id="x1" target="#m2" entityType="person"
signature="set" involvement="all"/>

[L1:] <srLink event="#e1" participant="x1" semRole="theme"
outScoping="#e1 #x1"/>

c. Semantics:

E, X

card(E) = 1
x

e ∈ E ⇒ DIE(e)

x

PERSON(x)
⇒

THEME(e,x)

Cases of quantified NPs with unequal scope are readily annotated in the format outlined here, but in order to
support these annotations by a well-defined semantics a new kind of merge operation on DRSs is neede, the scoped
merge, which is defined as follows:

(6)

δ
ε

α1
α2

⇒
β1
β2

⊕ γ =

δ
ε

α1
α2

⇒ (
β1
β2

∪ γ)

For instance, applied to the classical scoping example (7a), we obtain the semantics (7c) of the annotation (7b):

(7) a. All the students read two papers
b. Annotation for wide-scope two papers:

[v1:] <event xml:id="e1" target="#m1" eventType="read" signature="set"/>
[p1:] <participant xml:id="x1" target="#m2" entityType="student"

definiteness="def" signature ="set" involvement="all"/>
[p2:] <participant xml:id="x2" target="#m3" entityType="paper"

signature ="set" cardinality="2" involvement="all"/>
[L1:] <srLink event="#e1" participant="x1" semRole="agent"

distribution="individual" outScoping="#x1 #e1"/>
[L2:] <srLink event="#e1" participant="x2" semRole="theme"

distribution="individual" outScoping="#x2 #x1"/>
c. Semantics:

[p2 ∪ L2] ⊕ [p1 ∪ L1∪v1] =

Y

card(Y)=2
y

y ∈ Y ⇒

E, X

PAPER(y)
x

x ∈ X ⇒ STUDENTcr(x)

e

e ∈ E ⇒
x

READ(e) AGENT(e,x)
x ∈ X THEME(e,y)

x

x ∈ X ⇒
e

e ∈ E AGENT(e,x)

Besides scoped quantifications, also unscoped, partially scoped, and equally scoped quantifications
have to be considered. Partially and unscoped scoped cases, where there is no or incomplete information
about relative scoping, are easily annotated by not specifying values for @outScoping attributes, and
interpreted with underspecified DRSs (see Reyle 1993; 1994). Equally scoped quantifications, as occur-
ring in cumulative quantification (Scha, 1981) and in group quantification (Bunt, 1985), can be annotated
using the attribute @eqScope, as shown in (8) and (9). The semantics is obtained simply by using the
ordinary rather than the scoped merge of the sub-DRSs.

(8) a. Three breweries supplied fifteen inns.



b. Annotation of cumulative reading (In total 3 breweries supplied in total 15 inns):
[v1:] <event xml:id="e1" target="#m2" eventType="supply" signature="set"/>
[p1:] <participant xml:id="x1" target="#m1" entityType="brewery"

signature ="set" involvement="3"/>

[p2:] <participant xml:id="x2" target="#m3" entityType="inn"
signature ="set" involvement="15"/>

[L1:] <srLink event="#e1" participant="#x1" semRole="agent"
distribution="individual" eqScope="#x1 #x2"/>

[L2:] <srLink event="#e1" participant="x2" semRole="theme"
distribution="individual" eqScope="#x2 #x1"/>

c. Semantics:

(p1 ∪ L1) ∪ (p2 ∪ L2) ∪ v1 =

E, X , Y

card(X) = 3 card(Y ) = 5

x

x ∈ X ⇒

e

BREWERY(x)
e ∈ E
AGENT(e,x)

y

y ∈ Y ⇒

e

INN(y)
e ∈ E
THEME(e,y)

e

e ∈ E ⇒

x, y

SUPPLY(e)
x ∈ X y ∈ Y
AGENT(e,x) THEME(e,y)

Group quantification, as in Three boys played soccer against five girls on the reading where teams of
3 boys played against teams of 5 girls, can be annotated by using, besides the @eqScope attribute, the
@groupCard attribute. The semantics is obtained by interpreting the participant annotations as DRSs
introducing discourse markers for sets of sets of 3 boys and 5 girls.

(9)

[e1:] <event xml:id="e1" target="#m2" eventType="play" signature="set"/>
[p1:] <participant xml:id="x1" target="#m1" entityType="boy"

signature ="set" groupCard="3"/>
[p2:] <participant xml:id="x2" target="#m3" entityType="girl"

signature ="set" distribution="group" groupCard="5"/>
[L1:] <srLink event="#e1" participant="x1" semRole="agent"

distribution="group" eqScope="#x1 #x2"/>
[L2:] <srLink event="#e1" participant="x2" semRole="co-agent"

distribution="group" eqScope="#x2 #x1"/>

5 Concluding Remarks
We have described the essentials of a way of annotating quantification phenomena where the features
that characterize different forms of quantification and their properties are distributed over components
of annotation structures in a way that corresponds to their linguistic expression (e.g., involvement and
cardinality are features of <participant> components, corresponding to their expression in NPs).

Taking a davidsonian approach, we have introduced attributes and values for events, event partici-
pants, and the semantic roles of participants in events. However, the view of quantification which under-
lies this is more general; when predicate and argument structures are used, rather than events with partic-
ipants and semantic roles, that is easily accommodated, by introducing <predicate>. <argument>,
and <argLink> elements, and e.g. attaching distribution and scoping features to the letter, as in:

(10) <argLink pred="#P1" arg="#x1" argNum="arg1" distr="collective"/>

Quantification over events, time and place can be annotated in a similar way. As suggested by
Lee & Bunt (2012), Temporal quantification can be annotated by adding features to the <event> and
<timex3> elements defined in ISO 24617-2 and to the <tLink> that represents the semantic relation
between a set of events and a set of temporal entities (as in Most of the professors teach every Monday.

Clearly, something similar can be done for the annotation of quantifications over events and space,
as occurring in Policemen can be found at every streetcorner, adding the same features to the elements
defined in the ISO-Space language under development (see Pustejovsky et al., 2012).
