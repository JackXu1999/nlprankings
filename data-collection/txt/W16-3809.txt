Abstract

Verb@net is a French lexicon developed by “translation” of its English counterpart — VerbNet
(Kipper-Schuler, 2005) — and treatment of the specificities of French syntax (Pradet et al., 2014;
Danlos et al., 2016). One difficulty encountered in its development springs from the fact that the
list of (potentially numerous) frames has no internal organization. This paper proposes a type
system for frames that shows whether two frames are variants of a given alternation. Frame typ-
ing facilitates coherence checking of the resource in a “virtuous circle”. We present the principles
underlying a program we developed and used to automatically type frames in Verb@net. We also
show that our system is portable to other languages.

1 Introduction

VerbNet is a broad-coverage resource for English verbs in which verbs are grouped according to shared
syntactic behaviors, namely surface realizations of their argument structure and syntactic alternations
they are involved in (Kipper-Schuler, 2005; Kipper et al., 2006). Based on the hypothesis that verbs
with similar semantics share similar syntactic properties (Levin, 1993), VerbNet extends Levin’s classi-
fication up to 270 hierarchically organized verb classes. VerbNet has proven useful for NLP thanks to
its high coverage (more than five thousand distinct verbs), useful verb separation and systematic coding
of thematic roles. In particular, VerbNet is widely used in Semantic Role Labelling (SRL), a task that
has grown steadily in importance: it serves as an aid to information extraction (Surdeanu et al., 2003),
question-answering (Shen and Lapata, 2007), event extraction (Exner and Nugues, 2011), plagiarism
detection (Osman et al., 2012), machine translation (Bazrafshan and Gildea, 2013), or stock market
prediction (Xie et al., 2013).

Given the success of VerbNet, equivalent ressources for other languages have been developed, includ-
ing Italian (Busso and Lenci, 2016), Portuguese (Scarton et al., 2014) and others. For French, a French
Verb@net was first automatically derived from English VerbNet (Pradet et al., 2014); next the focus turned
to accounting for the syntactic specificities of French – for example the existence of pronominal forms
(noted as se V) which are illustrated in (1) for the middle alternation (Danlos et al., 2016).

(1) a. Le boucher a coupé le rumsteak = Agent V Patient (The butcher cut the rump steak)

b. Le rumsteak se coupe facilement = Patient se V<+middle> ADV (The rump steak cuts easily)

During the development of French Verb@net, problems were encountered owing to the lack of structure
in the list of frames for a given class in the original English resource. The aim of this paper is to propose a
solution to these problems. We first explain why the current organization of the information is detrimental
to the resource quality (Section 2). Then, after highlighting differences between English VerbNet and
its French counterpart in terms of optionality and order of complements (Section 3), we explain how
frames are automatically typed for French and how this typing helps to enhance the resource (Section 4).
Finally, Section 5 discusses the portability of the typing program to other languages.

2 Problems with frame structuring in VerbNet

In VerbNet, verb classes are organized in a hierarchy in which sub-classes inherit properties of parent
classes. The components of a class are 1) Members, a list of verbs – considered in one of their senses, if
polysemous – belonging to the class; 2) Roles, a list of thematic roles shared by the members, with each
thematic role optionally further characterized by certain selectional restrictions;1 and 3) Frames which
is a list of frames characterizing the syntactico-semantic behavior of the members. Each frame consists
of a syntactic surface construction, an EXAMPLE sentence, a SYNTAX field in which thematic roles
are mapped to syntactic complements, and a SEMANTICS field that indicates how the participants are
involved in the event. As an illustration, Figure 1 shows the list of the seven frames that describe the
get-13.5.1 class.2 This class includes verbs that denote an action consisting of obtaining something (e.g
buy, catch, order, reach). This kind of action generally implies the following thematic roles: Agent,
Theme, Source, Beneficiary and Asset.

Figure 1: List of frames for the get-13.5.1 class.

One can see in Figure 1 that frames differ in the number of complements (e.g. one complement in
the 1st and 6th frames, two complements in the 2nd and 3rd frame, etc.), in their syntactic nature (e.g.
Beneficiary is realized as a prepositional complement in the 3rd frame, as a direct complement in
the 4th frame), in their syntactic function (e.g. Asset is realized as an oblique complement in the 5th
frame, as the subject in the 6th frame), etc. In addition to these cases, it must be noted that if a given
argument can be realized in different ways (nominal, infinitival, sentential, etc.), then there is one frame
by type of realization. This is illustrated in Figure 2 showing the list of frames for the urge-58-1 class
with two frames according to the realization of Topic. The non-nominal syntactic realizations of a
thematic role are specified in syntactic restrictions, which are written between (angle) brackets.

In summary, there can be quite a number of frames in English VerbNet for a given class. The problem
we want to highlight is the absence of organization and typing in the list of frames. First, alternation
variants are not explicitly related, which is a loss of information for any NLP system using VerbNet.

1The terms thematic and semantic roles refer to the very same notion.
2Because of lack of room, the SEMANTICS field is cut.

62



Figure 2: List of frames for the urge-58-1 class.

For instance, the 3rd and 4th frames in Figure 1 are not explicitly related as variants in the “Benefactive
Alternation” (Levin, 1993, pp 48-49). The information that they describe exactly the same situation is
thereby lost. By the same way, the alternations that induce a change of meaning — e.g. the “locative
alternation” (Levin, 1993, pp 49-55) — are not identified and so the change in meaning is lost. Next, it is
difficult to know whether a combination of complements is either impossible or possible but not coded.
For example, the sentence Carmen bought a dress from Diana for Mary seems to be correct but no frame
explicitly encodes this configuration. Similarly, the sentence in the 4th frame Carmen bought Mary a
dress can be extended with a Source complement (Carmen bought Mary a dress from Diana) or an
Asset complement (Carmen bought Mary a dress for $50) but there is no frame for such extensions.

Our point is not to criticize the coding of the get-13.5.1 class or any class but to emphasize that the
absence of organization and/or typing in the list of frames for a given class can lead to errors, incoheren-
cies and oversights, because the linguist is not guided in her work when creating the list of frames. In
Section 4, we propose a solution to overcome this problem. We first underscore the differences in frame
coding between the English and French resources.

3 Optionality and order of complements in French Verb@net

As stated previously, the French Verb@net was initially created by adapting the English resource to
French, which means that the structure of this French resource is nearly identical to that of the English
one (Pradet et al., 2014). It was developed using a web interface available at https://verbenet.
inria.fr and illustrated in Figure 3 for the Settle-89 class.

However, there are two points where the French Verb@net differs from the English VerbNet.3 The
first one is that sub-structures, i.e. structures in which an optional complement is unexpressed, are never
coded for French while they are sometimes coded for English. The second one is that the order of
complements is not coded in French Verb@net. A prime example of the different coding choices between
English VerbNet and French Verb@net is given in the class send-11.1. It has five frames in English given
in Figure 4, while it has only one frame in French, which corresponds to the fourth one in Figure 4 (Nora
a envoyé le livre de Paris à Londres / Nora sent the book from Paris to London). We will see that these
different coding choices have implications for the automatic frame typing program (Section 5).

The choice not to encode sub-structures in French Verb@net is due to the fact that an unexpressed
complement may lead to different interpretations. Considering only optional objects, (Levin, 1993, pp
33-40) identified eight unexpressed object alternations such as “Unspecified object Alternation” (Mike
ate the cake ! Mike ate) or “Characteristic property of Agent Alternation” (That dog bites people !
That dog bites). In conclusion, it’s not informative to simply encode a sub-structure as acceptable without
stating to which situation it corresponds. For example, the frame for That dog bites should be typed as a
variant in the “Characteristic property of Agent Alternation”. For French Verb@net, such a work has not

3We remind the reader (Section 1) that the differences between French and English VerbNet due to the discrepancies between
the two languages are discussed in (Danlos et al., 2016) and left aside here.

yet been done, and so no sub-structure is coded.4

The choice not to encode the order of complements is due to the fact that the order of the complements
of a verb in French does not depend on the verb itself but on the “weight” of the complements, the
weight being computed according to the number of words (Gross, 1975) or other factors described in
(Thuilier, 2012). 5 In English VerbNet, it happens that two frames in a class differ only by the order of
the complements. This is the case in the class send-11.1, where the last two frames in Figure 4 differ
only by the order of Initial-Location and Destination complements.

4 French Verb@net: version with typed frames

The typed version of Verb@net from the English-like version has been created automatically 6. In this
typed version, any frame is typed so as to show explicitly whether it is “canonical” or obtained by an
alternation. Before going into detail, let us provide an illustrative example. The settle-89 class, which
was shown in Figure 3 in the English-like version, is shown in the typed version in Figure 5. The type of
the first frame is Canonique (canonical). The type of the second one is Canonique avec Goal[+V-inf]
which states that the Goal complement is realized as an infinitival phrase, while it is understood that is
is realized as a noun phrase — the default value — in the canonical frame. The type of the third frame
is Alt. Symetrique which states that this frame is obtained from the canonical one by the alternation
named “Simple reciprocal Alternation (intransitive)” in (Levin, 1993, pp 62-63). The type of the last
frame is Alt. Symetrique avec Goal[+V-inf] which states that the Goal complement is realized as an
infinitival phrase in the symmetrical (reciprocal) alternated form.

The automatic conversion of the untyped version of Verb@net into the typed one led us to discover and
correct incoherencies for the enhancement of the resource in a virtuous circle: the untyped version is
changed until the typed version is satisfactory.

The conversion program is going to be explained step by step, first in parent classes (section 4.2),
second in sub-classes (section 4.3). Next we will illustrate how the frame typing allows the enhancement
of the original resource by discovering and correcting incoherences (section 4.4). Before that, we need
to discuss the notion of canonical frame.

4To use French Verb@net for a task such as SRL, as an initial approximation one may consider any complement to be
optional.

5To use French Verb@net for a task such as SRL, one may consider any permutation of complements to be acceptable.

4.1 What is a canonical frame ?

In Levin’s description of English alternations, this notion is absent: there exists only the notion of two
variants of an alternation which are on the same footing. It is not our intention here to enter a theoretical
discussion on the topic, however, from a lexicographic and NLP perspective, it seems justified to state
that verbs such as break, cut, hit and touch are “canonically” transitive and participate in various diathe-
sis alternations (middle, conative, causative/inchoative alternations) which makes them intransitive —
although some authors, e.g. (Dubois and Dubois-Charlier, 1997) for French, consider intransitive forms
such as The carafe broke as canonical compared to the transitive causative form Fred broke the carafe.

One of the outcomes of this work — which is still in progress — will be to determine classes of verbs
for which a canonical form can be identified and to understand why the other classes do not exhibit
a canonical frame. As a prime illustration, our frame typing program gives poor results and doesn’t
identify a canonical frame in class 55 of aspectual verbs (commencer (begin), continuer (continue)), but
this is not a surprise: these verbs are included in VerbNet for the sake of coverage, but they could have
been excluded, much as modal and light verbs are excluded.

A second question is: should there exist only a unique canonical frame? Consider the class banish-

66



10.2 in Figure 6. In (Levin, 1993, p 123) it is stated that all banish verbs “allow to phrases as well as
from phrases, though not simultaneously”, so the second or third frame in Figure 6 cannot be considered
as a sub-structure of a frame including both Source and Destination complements. Thus, there
is apparently no reason to consider one as more canonical than the other, except that banish verbs are
verbs “which relate to the removal of an entity, typically a person, from a location” (Levin, 1993, p 123),
which seems to promote the frame with a Source as canonical on semantic grounds. So the idea of two
canonical frames could be accepted and one of the outcomes of this work will be to understand what are
the classes of verbs with two potential canonical forms and whether one of these forms can be promoted
as canonical on semantic grounds.

Figure 6: List of frames for the banish-10.2 class.

4.2 Frame typing in parent classes
The typing program identifies first the canonical frame, then the alternated frames and finally the frames
with syntactic restrictions, as described below.

Canonical frame. The program which converts the untyped version into the typed one first requires the
canonical frame to be identified, which raises problems discussed above. Currently, the strategy we use
to automatically identify the canonical form is to spot the frame that includes all the thematic roles listed
in the component Roles of the class (Section 2) — and which doesn’t include any syntactic restrictions
(written between (angle) brackets). This strategy relies on the fact that the order of complements is not
coded in French Verb@net (Section 3).

Alterned frame. The program detects an alternated frame thanks to a set of rules designed for
the set of coded alternations. For example, a rule can type a frame as Alt. Instrument subject
(Levin, 1993, pp 80) when the subject of the canonical frame, i.e. the thematic role on the left of
the symbol V, is replaced by the thematic role Instrument, see Agent V Patient {avec}
Instrument! Instrument V Patient. Another rule types a frame as Alt. Symetrique when
a Co-Agent (resp. Co-Patient) in the canonical frame is replaced by an Agent (resp. Patient)
marked as <+plural>, see Agent V {avec} Co-Agent {sur} Goal! Agent<+plural>
V {sur} Goal.

One of the main difficulties encountered in typing alternated frames is observed with cascades of
alternations. This is illustrated in the paradigm in (2) from the almagate-22.2 class: (2a) gives the
canonical frame, (2b) the symmetrical alternated frame, (2c) the neutral alternated frame. The difficulty
in typing is for (2d) which gives the alternated form when both the symmetrical and neutral alternations
apply in any order from the canonical frame.

(2) a. Canonique: Agent V Patient {avec} Co-Patient
Fred a associé la compagnie ↵ avec la compagnie � (Fred associated company ↵ with company �)

b. Alt. Symetrique: Agent V Patient<+plural>
Fred a associé les compagnies ↵ et � (Fred associated companies ↵ and �)

c. Alt. Neutre: Patient se V<+neutre> {avec} Co-Patient

67



La compagnie ↵ s’est associée avec la compagnie � (Company ↵ associated itself with company �)
d. Alt. Symetrique & Neutre: Patient<+plural> se V<+neutre>

Les compagnies ↵ et � se sont associées (Companies ↵ and � associated themselves with one another)

Frame with syntactic restriction Finally, the program has to identify two frames which are identical
except that in one of the frames a thematic role X has a syntactic restriction [synt], which states that the
realization of X is not nominal but infinitival, for example. The two frames are then easily typed T and
T with X[synt].

4.3 Frame typing in sub-classes
For sub-classes, the frame typing program relies on the idea that the canonical frame is in the parent
class. Consider the French sub-class bend-45.2.1 which includes verbs for which the non-pronominal
inchoative form — named Alternation inchoative — is possible on top of the pronominal form (La tige
a plié / La tige s’est pliée (The rod bent)), whereas the parent class bend-45.2 includes verbs for which
only the pronominal inchoative form — named Alternation neutre — is possible (La tige s’est incurvée
/ *La tige a incurvé (The rod curved)).7 As a consequence, the unique frame in the sub-class bend-45.2.1
receives the type Alternation inchoative which is to be understood as an alternated form of the canonical
form in the parent class. More generally, if a sub-class was created because of an alternation A which is
possible for only some verbs of the parent class, there is no problem with frame typing: the unique frame
in the sub-class receives type Alternation A.

However, a sub-class may also be created for other reasons, one of them being variants in prepositions
introducing complements. In French, the class correspond-36.1 includes communication verbs for which
the Theme is introduced by the preposition sur, as illustrated in Le comité a délibéré sur ce point (The
committee deliberated on this issue). A sub-class of correspond-36.1 includes verbs that also allow
the Theme to be introduced by the preposition de, as illustrated in Le comité a discuté de ce point
(The committee discussed this issue). The frame in the sub-class, which does not fall within alternation
variants nor alternative syntactic realization (in the sense given above), has not been typed yet.

4.4 Discovering incoherencies
The automatic conversion of the untyped Verb@net version into the typed one led us to discover inco-
herencies. As an illustration, it has been discovered that the coding of “possessor-attribute factoring
alternations” (Levin, 1993, pp 72-78) called “restructurations” in French was not satisfactory (it is not
satisfactory in English either). These alternations arise because a possessor and a possessed attribute
may be expressed in two different ways. As one option, they may be expressed in a single complex noun
phrase whose head is the attribute modified by a genitive for the possessor (Fred adores Jane’s humour).
Alternatively, they may be expressed separately, one as a direct argument (subject or object), and the
other via a prepositional phrase (Fred adores Jane for her humour). A unique syntactic function which is
expressed in a complex noun phrase is thus restructured into two syntactic functions. For thematic roles,
this is unusual since the complex noun phrase receives a unique thematic role while there must be two
roles for the two syntactic functions in the restructured variant.

As a consequence, we chose the following solution: we use two distinct frames to code that a given
thematic role, for example Stimulus for the object of adorer (adore), is either a simple noun phrase
(Fred adores this paint) or a complex noun phrase (Fred adores Jane’s humour), see (3a) and (3b).
The frame with the complex noun phrase is identified with the restriction Stimulus[+genitive],
which requires to divide the role Stimulus into two parts: Stimulus.prop for the attribute which
is the head noun and Stimulus.poss for the possessor expressed in a genitive phrase. These two
parts are naturally used in the restructured form, see (3c) with two thematic roles assigned to the two
complements. The coding for a verb such as adorer in the admire-31.2 class is schematized in (3), in
which the non-nominal realizations of Stimulus are left aside. 8

7In English, there is no sub-class bend-45.2.1 since the inchoative alternated form is compulsorily a non-pronominal form
while it is pronominal and/or non-pronominal in French.

8In VerbNet, the role Stimulus.prop is named Attribute in the frame equivalent to (3c), and (3b) is not coded in a
specific frame.

68



(3) a. Canonique: Experiencer V Stimulus
Fred adore cette peinture (Fred adores this paint)

b. Canonique with Stimulus[+genitive] : Experiencer V Stimulus.prop<+genitive(Stimulus.poss)>
Fred adore l’humour de Jane (Fred adores Jane’s humour)

c. Restructuration: Experiencer V Stimulus.poss {pour} Stimulus.prop
Fred adore Jane pour son humour (Fred adores Jane for her humour)

We have not yet finished our virtuous circle between the un-typed and typed versions of Verb@net but
the first results we get are promising. As an illustration, 16 classes have been corrected for the coding of
restructuration alternations.

5 Methods and portability for typing VerbNet-like resources in other languages

Typing frames can be done in two ways: manually or automatically. Manual typing can be a good
solution for a language for which no VerbNet-like ressource exists. When starting the work from scratch,
the linguist has every reason to type each frame right away so as to be guided in her work. Manual typing
for a language for which a VerbNet-like ressource already exists can be time-consuming (and tiresome).
This is why we choose automatic typing for French with the existing Verb@net. This automatic typing is
effective in improving the resource as typing errors are more often attributable to errors in the resource
itself than to the typing program.

What is the feasibility of porting a typing program from one language to another? We cannot currently
answer this question since, as far as we know, French is the only language for which there is a typing
program, however we do have some indication. We focus on the identification of the canonical frame (in
a parent class) since it should be clear from the description of the French typing program in Section 4
that this is the most difficult point. The canonical frame in a parent class can generally be identified
thanks to the fact that it is this frame that includes all the thematic roles pertinent for the class with no
restriction on any thematic role (which means that all thematic roles are realized as simple noun phrases)
and no role such as Stimulus.poss or Stimulus.prop (which means that no restructuration is
involved, Section 4). In French, there are only a few exceptions to this principle. For example, in class
appoint-29.1 (nommer (nominate)), the two frames include all the thematic roles and differ only by the
presence of comme (as) in the “as Alternation” (Levin, 1993, p 78). For this class, we typed (somewhat
arbitrarily) Canonique the frame without comme (as) and Alt. comme the other frame. In English,
there are more exceptions to this principle. First, the “Dative and Benefactive alternations” (Levin, 1993,
pp 45-49), which don’t exist in French, don’t change the number of thematic roles. So specific rules
must be designed to spot these alternated frames. Second, two frames may differ only by the order of
complements (Section 3). In this case, it is not clear what should be done.

Finally, let us examine sub-structures. As we explained in Section 3, sub-structures have not yet been
coded in French Verb@net because it is not informative to code a sub-structure as acceptable without stat-
ing to which situation it corresponds. This means that when they are coded they will be simultaneously
typed, e.g. Agent V = Ce chien mord (This dog bites) typed as Alternation Characteristic property
of Agent variant of the canonical frame Agent V Patient = Ce chien a mordu Jane (This dog bit
Jane). For English, an automatic typing program from the existing VerbNet can only type This dog bites
as a sub-structure, without any other information.

6 Conclusion

We have shown that the lack of structure/typing in the list of frames for a VerbNet class make the coding
task of the linguist difficult and it can lead to incoherencies or oversights. We have proposed frame typing
as a method to overcome this problem. The types are: (i) canonical, (ii) canonical with a non-nominal or
complex (i.e with a genitive) nominal realization of a thematic role, (iii) alternated form of another frame
where the other frame can iteratively be canonical, canonical with a non-nominal simple realization or
alternated form, (iv) untyped when the typing program gives no result.

We have presented an automatic typing program for French which we believe is easily portable to
other languages. The automatic conversion of the untyped Verb@net version into the typed one enabled

69



us to discover and correct incoherencies, thus enhancing the resource in a “virtuous circle”. We have not
yet evaluated the effects of this enhancement, but other VerbNet-like resources could be enhanced as we
have done for French.
