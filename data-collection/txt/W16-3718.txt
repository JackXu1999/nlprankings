Abstract 

This paper presents a new comprehensive multi-level Part-Of-Speech tag set and a Support Vector 

Machine based Part-Of-Speech tagger for the Sinhala language. The currently available tag set for Sinhala 

has two limitations: the unavailability of tags to represent some word classes and the lack of tags to capture 

inflection based grammatical variations of words. The new tag set, presented in this paper overcomes both 

of these limitations. The accuracy of available Sinhala Part-Of-Speech taggers, which are based on Hidden 

Markov Models, still falls far behind state of the art. Our Support Vector Machine based tagger achieved 

an overall accuracy of 84.68% with 59.86% accuracy for unknown words and 87.12% for known words, 

when the test set contains 10% of unknown words.  

1 Introduction 

Sinhala, the official language of Sri Lanka, which is used by a 16 million odd population, is a 

morphologically rich and highly inflected language. Sinhala belongs to Indo-Aryan family of languages 

and has its own alphabet. Compared to the advancement in the area of computational linguistics, Sinhala 

language lacks many linguistic resources, holding back natural language processing research for the 

same (Manamini et al., 2016; Palihakkara et al.,2015). A standard and accurate Part-Of-Speech (POS) 

tagger is one such basic resource.  

Automatic POS tagging requires two main resources: a comprehensive tag set and a tagger. Further, 

a manually annotated corpus is required to train the tagger, when using supervised learning techniques. 

Comprehensiveness of the tag set can be defined as the ability of the tag set to represent all word classes 

of the language. As such any grammatically correct sentence of the language can be tagged using the 

tag set. Quality of the manually tagged corpus is a measurement of how accurately the words are tagged 

manually. Comprehensiveness of the tag set and quality of the corpus directly affect the performance of 

tagger.  

Some research has been carried out in Sinhala POS tagging. They use the UCSC Tag Set, which has 

three versions. The latest version consists of 29 tags (Gunasekara & Weerasinghe, 2016). However, a 

closer inspection reveals that this tag set is not comprehensive. There are some word classes in Sinhala 

that are not covered by this tag set. As reported by Gunasekara & Weerasinghe (2016), out of the 100,000 

words in the manually POS tagged corpus, 3989 words do not fall into any category of the UCSC Tag 

Set, which means that even manual POS tagging cannot achieve 100% accuracy. This limitation has 

created unnecessary ambiguities in the tagged corpus, resulting some words being tagged as unknown 

and some words being tagged with multiple tags in different places even when they appear in the same 

context with a similar meaning.  In addition, this tag set is not comprehensive enough to cover the 

inflection based grammatical variations of Sinhala language. Sinhala noun base forms are inflected by 

suffixing a morpheme to indicate number, definiteness and case. Finite Verbs are inflected based on 

person, tense, number and gender. UCSC Tag Set does not capture such grammatical features in inflected 

nouns and verbs. In this research, we designed a complete, multi-level tag set1 for Sinhala that covers 

all word classes and grammatical variations of Sinhala words, with the help of Sinhala language experts. 

The new tag set resolves the identified limitations of the previous tag set.

Previous research on Sinhala POS taggers used Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based tagging models 

and a hybrid tagging model using HMM and morphological rules (Jayasuriya & Weerasinghe, 2013; 

Jayaweera & Dias, 2014; Gunasekara & Weerasinghe, 2016). The highest reported overall accuracy is 

72% with 20% of average unknown words by the hybrid tagger. One reason for the low accuracy can be 

the ambiguities and limitations of the used tag set.  

There are many other stochastic, rule based, and hybrid POS tagging techniques such as Support 

Vector Machines (SVM), Maximum Entropy, Brill Tagger, TnT and Neural Network based taggers that 

achieved higher accuracies (Ojha et al,2015; Antony & Soman, 2011; Kumar & Josan, 2010) when 

employed for other morphologically rich languages. Comparatively, SVM based taggers have provided 

promising results for POS tagging on other Indo-Aryan languages. SVM is a suitable method to use with 

a high dimensional feature space and it has proven results with a small training set. Given that Sinhala 

is an under-resourced language with a severe limitation in finding linguistic experts to prepare the 

annotated corpus, we opted to choose the SVM based approach. 

This research is carried out as part of a larger initiative to build a computer assisted Sinhala to Tamil 

(another official language of Sri Lanka) translator for official documents. Based on the parent project, 

the corpus used for this research consists of official Sinhala documents such as official letters, annual 

reports and circulars. Creating a manually tagged corpus is a challenging task in Sinhala due to the lack 

of annotators with good knowledge in Sinhala linguistics.   

Currently this study is carried out using a corpus of 70,000 words. We are continuously increasing 

the size of the corpus.  The corpus is manually tagged using the second level of the new tag set that 

consists of 30 tags.  The second level of the new tag set resolves the ambiguities of the previous tag set. 

From the third level onwards, separate tags are provided for each inflected form of a word. In Sinhala, 

inflecting factors are Number, Gender, Person, Animacy, Definiteness, Case and Tense. After tagging a 

word from a second level tag, expanding it to the third level based on above inflecting factors is 

straightforward and unambiguous. Thus, manually tagging at level 3 is straightforward and does not 

need high level of language skills. Automatic tagging at third level can also be done using a simple 

classification process followed by morphological analysis.  Therefore, although we did not use the full 

tag set to annotate the corpus (due to time constraints and resource limitations), getting this done in a 

later stage is much straightforward. 

An SVM based tagger was created using the SVM based sequential POS tagger generator provided 

by Giménez and Màrquez (2004a). Our tagger was successful in achieving an overall accuracy of 

84.68%, with 87.12% and 59.86% accuracy for known words and unknown words, respectively. This 

accuracy was achieved when 10% of words are unknown words in the test set.  

The rest of the paper is arranged as follows. Section two explains the current status of POS tagging 

research in Sinhala language and other south Asian languages. The new tag set is presented in detail in 

section three, explaining how it solves the problems identified in the previous tag set. Section four 

explains the corpus creation process. Section five explains the SVM based tagger and the selected feature 

set. Section six presents the experiment results and a discussion on the results. Finally section seven 

concludes the paper.  

2 Literature Review 

POS tagging related research done up to now for Sinhala language has used the UCSC Tag Set, which 

now has three versions.  The latest version of UCSC Tag Set consists of 29 tags where 27 of them are 

language related tags. The remaining two tags are for Foreign Words and Symbols. Changes from the 

UCSC Tag Set Version 1 to Version 3 include addition of Common Noun Root tag and splitting the 

Verb Participle tag to four sub categories. All three versions of this tag set are hereafter collectively 

referred to as ‘UCSC Tag Set’, unless otherwise specifically referred to by the version number. UCSC 

Tag Set has two limitations. The main limitation is that some Sinhala words do not fall under any POS 

tag in the tag set, thus happens to be tagged as Unknown. Some examples are හැකි - hæki “can” ,යුතු - 

yuthu “should/must”, න ොහැකි - nohæki “cannot”, කුම  - kumana “which”, ඉටු - itu2 ,සිදු - sidu2 ,පත් - 

path2 and බව - bava2. Such unknown words fall in to a small set of distinct categories that have special 
language characteristics, thus can be grouped under new tag categories. The second limitation is 

                                                           
2 No comparable word in English 

174



inflection based grammatical variations of words have not been captured in the tag set. For example, 

common nouns in Sinhala that get inflected based on cases (Nominative: ගස - gasa “the tree”, 

Accusative :ගසක් - gasak “a tree”, Dative :ගසට - gasata “to the tree”, Genitive :ගනසේ/ගනසහි - 

gase/gasehi “in the tree”, Instrumental :ගනසන් - gasen “from the tree”) are tagged under a single tag. 
Previous research reported on creating Sinhala POS taggers (Jayasuriya & Weerasinghe,2013; 

Jayaweera & Dias, 2014; Gunasekara & Weerasinghe, 2016) has used the UCSC Tagged Corpus built 

from Sinhala newspaper articles which was tagged using the UCSC Tag Set. Jayasuriya and 

Weerasinghe (2013) used an HMM based statistical method to train a tagger and achieved 62% overall 

accuracy using an 80,000 word tagged corpus for training. Jayaweera & Dias (2014) reported an 

accuracy of 90% for known words. The accuracy for unknown words is not reported. Improving the 

previous work, Gunasekara and Weerasinghe (2016) have built a hybrid POS tagger using HMM based 

statistical tagging followed by a morphological rule based tag prediction technique for unknown words, 

and reported an overall tagging accuracy of 72% with 20% of average unknown words. 

As seen above, very limited amount of research has been done on Sinhala POS tagging. Other south 

Asian languages (such as Hindi, Urdu, Bengali, Nepali, Bhojpuri, etc.) belonging to the same language 

family as Sinhala have comparably higher amount of research in the field of POS tagging (Modi & Nain, 

2016; Joshi et al.,2013; Dandapat et al.,2007; Chakrabarti & CDAC, 2011; Gupta et al.,2016; Ekbal & 

Bandyopadhyay,2008; Shahi et al.,2013; Singh & Jha, 2015).  These works have used different POS 

tagging techniques such as HMM, Maximum Entropy, Conditional Random Field(CRF) and SVM. 

Comparisons between the experimented POS tagging methodologies for south Asian languages have 

shown that, SVM based POS tagging method has shown promising results (Antony & Soman, 2011). 

For example, an SVM based tagger for Bengali has obtained an accuracy of 86.84% and found to be 

outperforming other tagging systems based on HMM, Maximum Entropy and CRF (Ekbal & 

Bandyopadhyay,2008). A POS tagger for Nepali, based on SVM has shown an accuracy of 93.27% and 

reported to be accurate than the TnT tagger (Shahi et al.,2013). POS tagger for Bhojpuri used an SVM 

based tagger with 87.67% accuracy when 3.7% words are unknown (Singh & Jha, 2015), where training 

is done using 10,440 tokens. Ojha et. al (2015) have done a comparison of two POS tagging methods: 

CRF and SVM for three Indo-Aryan languages : Hindi, Odia and Bhojpuri. Error rate in POS tagging is 

found to be lower in SVM for two languages except Bhojpuri. Similarly, English POS taggers based on 

SVM has achieved comparable results with the state of art (Giménez & Marquez, 2004b). Based on the 

above observations, SVM appears to be a promising option to create an accurate POS tagger.  

3 Tag Set 

This section describes the new comprehensive multi-level Sinhala tag set. This tag set was created 

based on the available tag set for Sinhala UCSC Tag Set. The UCSC Tag Set was improved based on 

the consultation with Sinhala language experts and some comparable tags were borrowed from the Penn 

Treebank tag set. The UCSC Tagged Corpus was taken as a reference to analyse language usage in 

creating the new tag set. The new tag set is defined in multiple levels, where in each new level, tags are 

divided in to sub tags based on inflecting factors or contextual definitions. The complete Sinhala POS 

tag set contains 148 tags. The hierarchical nature of the new tag set allows users to select the appropriate 

level of tagging for their application or purpose. Because of this multi-level nature, it was 

straightforward for us to tag the new corpus using only a 30 sub-set of this tag set.  

 

3.1 Tags in Level One 

Sinhala language has five primary top level parts of speech: Nouns ( ාම - nāma), Adjectives ( ාම 

වින ේෂණ - nāma viśēṣaṇa), Verbs (ක්‍රියා - kriya), Adverbs (ක්‍රියා වින ේෂණ - kriya viśēṣaṇa ), and Nipāta 

(නිපාත). 
 

3.2 Tags in Level Two 

Each primary tag at level 1 is divided in to sub categories at level 2 based on context definitions. 

Noun Categorization at Level Two 

Nouns are divided in to 7 categories at secondary level based on the definition. Those are Common 

Noun, Proper Noun, Pronoun, Noun in Compound Verb, Questioning Pronoun, Deterministic Pronoun, 

175



and Question Based Pronoun. From these, the first four tags are the most obvious and can be found in 

the UCSC Tag Set as well. The remaining three are newly introduced. 

Common nouns in Sinhala are similar to common nouns in any other language and denote a class of 

objects or a concept.  Similarly, proper nouns identify an exact entity (person, place or thing) and cannot 

have an indefinite form. Pronouns, similar to any other language, are words that can be substituted for 

a noun or a noun phrase. Questioning pronouns, a special category of pronouns, are words used to ask a 

question. This category is comparable to WH-Pronouns in Penn Treebank tag set. Questioning pronoun 

is a new tag introduced in the tag set. Sinhala examples for questioning pronouns are කුමක්ද - kumakda 

“what” ,නෙනසේද - kesēda “how” ,ෙවදාද - kavadāda “when”  and නෙොනහේදීද - kohēdīda “where” . An 

example usage of a questioning pronoun කුමක්ද - kumakda “what” would be ඔබ ට අව ය කුමක්ද? – obata 
avashaya kumakda? “What do you want?”. As seen from the examples, all questioning pronouns in 

Sinhala end in letter ‘ද’-‘da’. In the UCSC annotated corpus that uses the UCSC Tag Set, these words 

have been broken down to two parts where the last letter ‘ද’-‘da’ is separated. In the UCSC tagged 

corpus, ‘ද’-‘da’ is tagged as particle. Tagging of the first part was also ambiguous. For example කුමක්ද 

- kumakda “what”, is first broken up in to ‘කුමක්’ + ‘ද’, former part කුමක් - kumak “which” is tagged as 

Pronoun. At the same time, කුමක් - kumak “which” is tagged as unknown in some other places. We refer 
to this first part as question base pronouns.  Question base pronouns are used to show the uncertainty 

of a noun/noun phrase of interest. As discussed above, questioning pronouns are created by adding the 

suffix ‘ද’-‘da’ to question base pronouns. An example usage of question base pronoun කුමක් - kumak 

“what” would be ඔබ කුමක් ෙනේද? – oba kumak kaleda? “What did you do?”.  Deterministic pronouns 
are words built up from a combination of a determiner (discussed below) and a pronoun. For example 

සමහනෙක් - samaharek “some of them” is a word in Sinhala derived from සමහෙ - samahara “some”, 

which is a determiner and නදන ක් - denek “them”, which is a pronoun. Finally, Noun in compound verb 
is a common noun followed by a verb to build up a compound verb.  

 

Adjective Categorization at Level Two 

 At the second level, adjectives are divided in to 3 categories: adjective, adjectival noun and adjective 

in compound verb. The whole purpose of an adjective is to describe a noun, and cannot be used as any 

other word type. This same tag is present in the UCSC Tag Set as well. Adjectival noun is a noun that 

acts as an adjective to describe another noun based on the context. Therefore the same word form can 

act as a common noun and adjectival noun based on the context. For example, පාසේ - pāsal “schools” 

is a common noun but in the phrase පාසේ වත්ත - pāsal vatta “school ground”, පාසේ - pāsal “schools” 

is used to describe the වත්ත - vatta “ground”, thus tagged as an adjectival noun. Another observation 
here is, adjectival nouns in Sinhala take the plural, base form of its related common noun.  In contrast, 

English language uses the singular form of the common noun, even when it is used as a modifier of 

another noun. In the UCSC Tag Set Version 3, the base form of a common noun is identified as common 

noun root that is always plural. But Common Noun Root can either be used as a common noun alone, or 

as an adjectival noun. So in our new tag set, we use two tags, adjectival noun or common noun to tag 

common noun roots, based on the context. Adjectival noun is a new tag introduced in our tag set. In 

contrast, in the Penn Treebank tagged corpus, as well as the UCSC tagged corpus, all adjectival nouns 

are tagged as some variation of common noun. Advantage of having an adjectival noun is it helps to 

identify noun phrases that need to be treated as a single entity. Finally, adjective in compound verb is an 

adjective followed by a verb to create a compound verb.  

 

Verb Categorization at Level Two 

Verbs are divided into five sub categories, based on the definition: verb finite, verb participle, verbal 

noun, verb non-finite and modal auxiliary. Verb finite refers to verbs used in a sentence ending. All other 

verb types are used in the middle of sentences. Verbal noun is an inflected form of a verb that acts as a 

noun. Verb participle is another inflected form of a verb that is used in a sentence to modify a noun, 

noun phrase, verb or a verb phrase. Thus it plays the same role as adjective or adverb. Verb non-finite 

contains all other inflected forms of the verb that do not belong to verb finite, verb participle and verbal 

noun. Sinhala has a set of words similar to English modal verbs:  හැකි - hæki “Can’, යුතු - yuthu “Should/ 

Must”, න ොහැකි - nohæki “Cannot”. To cover this word group, modal auxiliary tag is borrowed from 

176



the Penn Treebank tag set. UCSC Tag Set has not defined this tag, and consequently, the corresponding 

words in the corpus have been marked as unknown.  

Adverbs, similar to other languages, are words used to describe a verb, and are not divided in to sub 

categories at level two.  

 

Nipātha Categorization at Level Two 

Nipātha are further divided in to 8 categories: Postposition, conjunction, particle, interjection, 

determiner, nipathana, case marker and preposition in compound verb. Postpositions in Sinhala are 

words used after nouns, verbs and sometimes even after adjectives and adverbs to show their relationship 

to other words in order to build up a meaningful sentence. Conjunctions are words used to connect 

words, phrases or sentences. Interjections in Sinhala, similar to other languages, are words used to show 

the emotion or feeling. Determiners are words that are used before a noun to show which particular 

example of the noun is referred to. Postposition, conjunction, particle, interjection and determiner are 

present in the UCSC Tag Set as well. Nipathana is a special subset of Nipātha. Usually, nipātha words 

cannot be used alone. In contrast, nipathana can be used alone in some contexts, and can be used as a 

postposition as well if needed. Examples are ඇති - æti “enough/have/in3”and  පුළුවන් - puluwan “able”. 
Sinhala nouns are morphologically inflected based on the case. A suffix is added to the noun to show 

the case. For animate nouns and inanimate singular nouns, suffix ට - ta is added for dative case, suffix 
නේ - ge is added for genitive case and suffix නගන් - gen is added for instrumental case. For inanimate 
plural nouns, suffix වලට - valata is added for dative case, suffix වල - vala is added for genitive case and 
suffix වලින් - valin is added for instrumental case. According to Sinhala language rules, it is wrong to 
separate these case marking suffixes from the main noun (Dissanayaka, 2008; Dissanayaka, 2014). 

However, some Sinhala writers tend to separate this case marking suffix from the main noun. To cope 

with such cases, a POS tag called case marker is introduced. In the corpus tagged using the UCSC Tag 

Set, case markers have been handled in an ambiguous manner. For example, dative ‘ට’ case marking 

suffix is tagged as particle whereas dative ‘වලට’ case marking suffix is tagged as a noun. Finally, 
preposition in compound verbs are words that do not have a meaning by themselves but, when combined 

with another verb, make up a compound verb.  

 

Compound Verbs 

Three tags discussed above under Nouns, Verbs and Nipāta, deserve further discussion: noun in 

compound verb, adjective in compound verb, and preposition in compound verb. There are verbs in 

Sinhala that cannot be written using a single word, thus they need two words. These verb types are 

referred to as ‘compound verbs’ hereafter. Second word of a compound verb is always a verb type. 

Examples for such compound verbs are පාඩම් ෙෙ වා - pāḍam karanavā “study” ,අඩු ෙෙ වා - adu 

karanavā “reduce”, අඩු නව වා - adu venavā  “reducing”  සිදු ෙෙ වා - sidu karanavā “make something 

happen”. The latter words of above examples, ෙෙ වා - karanavā “doing” and නව වා venavā 

“happening” are verbs. When analyzing the former words, it can be a common noun as පාඩම් - pāḍam 

“lesson”, an adjective as අඩු - adu “less/lesser” or a word that does not have a meaning on its own such 

as සිදු - sidu. Respectively, these three former words are tagged using noun in compound verb, adjective 
in compound verb and preposition in compound verb. Noun in compound verb and adjective in 

compound verb tags are present in UCSC Tag Set under the names noun in kriya mula, and adjective in 

kriya mula, respectively. Words that we categorize under preposition in compound verb are taken as 

unknown words in the UCSC Corpus. ‘kriya mula’ in Sinhala means ‘base verb’ and it could be 

misleading. Thus we substituted the term kriya mula with the term compound verb.  

 

Additional Tags at Level Two 

Apart from the above discussed sub categorization of 5 primary tags, there are 5 other POS tags that 

are added to the tag set. These are number, abbreviation, full stop, punctuation, and foreign word, which 

are self-explanatory. Another special tag called sentence ending is introduced to mark all the words that 

end a sentence but do not belong to the category verb finite. In Sinhala, sentences can end in an inflected 

form of a noun, adjective or a nipātha. Examples are ගසකි - gasaki “a tree”, which is a noun, සඳහායි - 

san̆dahāyi “for” which is a postposition ,and වින ේෂිතයි - viśēṣitayi “special”, which is an adjective. In 

                                                           
3 English meaning can vary based on the context 

177



the UCSC Tag Set, these words are tagged using their original tag: common noun, postposition, and 

adjective, respectively.  

These categorizations mark the second level of the tag set consisting of 30 tags.   

 

3.3 Tags at Level Three  

Nouns and verbs in Sinhala can be inflected based on number, gender, person, animacy, definiteness, 

case, and tense. From third level onwards, each tag at second level is further categorized based on 

inflection factors.  

For example, Common noun can be inflected based on animacy (animate/ inanimate), gender 

(masculine/ feminine), number (singular/plural), definiteness (definite/indefinite) and case 

(nominative/accusative/dative/genitive /instrumental). Finite verb is further inflected based on person 

(first/second/third), tense (past/non past), number (singular/plural) and gender (masculine/ feminine). 

As per the requirement, tag set can be extended up to more levels by taking the selected set of 

inflecting factors at each level. For example, one can do the third level classification only using animacy 

and gender for common nouns, and then further categorize each third level noun based on definiteness 

at fourth level. Granularity of categorization can be decided based on the requirements of the specific 

application. At the most fine grained level, our tag set contains a total of 148 tags. 

Sentence ending tag holds the possibility of further categorization depending on its original word 

class such as Noun Finite, Adjective Finite and Nipātha Finite, which is not included in the current tag 

set and thus not used to tag the corpus. 

There are some postpositions in Sinhala that can be inflected by suffixing a particle. For example, 

සඳහා - san̆dahā “for” can be inflected as සඳහාම - san̆dahāma “especially for” and සඳහාද - san̆dahāda 
“even for”. Such inflections are not captured in this tag set.   

4 Corpus Creation 

This research is initiated as part of a larger project for creating a ‘Sinhala to Tamil Machine assisted 

translation system for official documents in Sri Lanka’.  Therefore, the corpus used for the research is 

built up using official documents used in various government organizations, such as official letters, 

circulars and annual reports. 

A corpus of 70,000 words was created using official letters, circulars and annual reports. Corpus was 

manually annotated using the second level of the tag set, consisting of 30 tags. Training was given for 

each annotator before commencing annotation. Continuous feedback was provided for annotators to 

reduce errors. 

Annotation was done by 7 annotators who are native Sinhala speakers. However, their Sinhala 

linguistic knowledge is naive. Due to the nature of their knowledge on the Sinhala language and human 

errors, annotators tend to make mistakes in tagging. Therefore a verification process was carried out on 

the initial phases of manually tagging during the training period of the annotators to overcome this 

limitation.  

Table 1 shows the composition of the corpus in terms of frequency of frequencies of unique words. 

Our corpus of 70,000 words contains 12% of unique words.

Finally, it should be noted that we were able to assign a tag for each word in our corpus, unlike the 

corpus tagged with the UCSC Tag Set. 

5  Tagger 

SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm for binary classification (Cortes & Vapnik, 1995). 

Given a set of training examples, where each instance is a vector in multidimensional space, SVM learns 

178



a Maximum Margin Hyperplane that separates positive examples from negative examples. Margin is the 

distance from the hyperplane to the nearest positive and negative examples in the vector space. 

POS tagging is a multi-class classification problem. SVM, which by default is a binary classifier, is 

used to solve the multi-class classification problem by taking one POS tag at a time as positive class and 

rest of the tags as negative. Following this technique, the sequential POS tagger generator based on SVM 

(Giménez and Màrquez 2004a) was used to train a POS tagging model for Sinhala.  

Three feature types are considered in tagger generation: word features, POS features, and lexicalized 

features. Word features are word unigrams, bigrams and trigrams. POS features are POS unigrams, 

bigrams and trigrams. Lexicalized features used for this experiment are prefixes, suffixes and word 

length. Lexicalized features related to English language that are based on character capitalization are 

irrelevant to Sinhala language.  

A centred window of size N around the word to be disambiguated is considered in feature generation. 

N value 7 is used for feature generation in English (Giménez & Marquez, 2004b). But it may not be 

optimal for a language like Sinhala, which is highly inflected. To find out the best N value for Sinhala 

language, an experiment was done for N= 7, 5 and 3. From the 70,000 word corpus 55,000 words were 

used as training data and remaining 15,000 were used for testing. The tagger uses simple left-to-right 

tagging, so POS tags of following words are not decided at run time. To cope with this problem, 

ambiguity class tags are defined for proceeding context words. Ambiguity class for a word is a 

concatenation of all possible POS tags for that word. Each individual tag of ambiguity classes is taken 

as a ‘May Be’ binary feature. For example, if a word has an ambiguity class NN_VV (that word can be 

a Noun or a Verb), then May Be features are defined as “Following class May Be NN” and “Following 

class May Be VV”. Feature set used for window size 3 is shown in Table 2. 

To check the effect of ambiguity class related features, a tagger model is recreated with optimal 

window size. Features related to ambiguity classes (May Be’s, POS unigrams for current and next (right) 

tag, and POS bigrams) were removed from the feature set. This is because those features use the 

ambiguity class of a specific word as its POS tag if its POS tag is not yet decided at run time. Finally, to 

analyze the effect of lexical features (prefixes, suffixes and word length), the experiment was carried 

out by removing them from the feature set.

6 Evaluation 

Table 3 shows the performance of the tagger when features are generated using a centred window of 

size 7, 5 and 3. As observed, overall accuracy was increased when window size is reduced from 7 to 3. 

Sinhala words are inflected based on morphology. When compared with languages such as English, 

same information can be given using a lesser number of words. This may be the reason for increased 

accuracy when window size is decreasing. Further, the training time has drastically reduced when 

window size is reduced from 7 to 3. Based on these observations, window size 3 is selected for further 

experiments.

Table 4: Accuracies with ambiguous and lexical features removed 

 

Table 4 presents the accuracies of the tagger when ambiguous class related features and lexical 

features are omitted from the feature set, respectively. After removing ambiguous class related features 

from the features provided in Table 2, results provided an overall accuracy of 84.68% which is a further 

improvement. However, accuracy of unknown word tagging was reduced to 59.86%. Comparing results 

provided in Table 3 and Table 4, best unknown word accuracy is obtained when window size is 5 

whereas best overall accuracy is obtained when window size is 3 and ambiguous class related features 

are omitted. Improvement in results for known word accuracy has contributed to the increase in the 

overall accuracy at this case. This opens up an interesting experiment to find out the reason behind 

unknown word accuracy decrement and known word accuracy increment, when features are generated 

from window of size 5 and 3, respectively. 

When lexicalized features (prefixes, suffixes and word length) are removed from the feature set of 

window size 3, overall accuracy was reduced to 84.08%. This was due to the reduction in accuracy for 

unknown words to 53.01%. Therefore we can conclude that lexical features have contributed directly on 

determining POS tags for unknown words. 

SVM based POS tagger for Sinhala was successful in obtaining an highest overall accuracy of 84.68% 

with known word accuracy of 87.12% and unknown word accuracy of 59.86% when test set contains 

10% unknown words. Here, lexical features have helped improving the unknown word accuracy. Table 

5 summarizes the feature set used to obtain the highest overall accuracy.

Table 5: Feature set used in obtaining the best results 

 

Table 6 provides tagging accuracy per each language related POS tags. Question pronoun, question 

base pronoun, modal auxiliary, pronoun, case marker, conjunction, postposition, particle, determiner 

and nipathana have obtained tagging accuracy of 90% and above. Not surprisingly, these are closed 

class words. As discussed before, common nouns and finite verbs are two tags that will be further 

categorized based on inflection factors at third level tagging. These two tags have achieved 89% and 

88% accuracy respectively at second level. Since third level tagging is straightforward and 

unambiguous, this will contribute to an increased accuracy of the tagger even when third level tagging 

is done. Preposition in compound verb, a new tag we introduced to tag set, has achieved 80% accuracy. 

Words belonging to this tag were tagged as Unknown in the UCSC tag set. Thus the new addition has 

contributed positively to POS tagging of Sinhala. Adjectival noun, again introduced in our tag set, has 

achieved a 67% of accuracy. This is due to ambiguity when the same word is used as an adjectival noun 

and common noun in two contexts. Sentence ending, another newly introduced tag has only achieved 

48% accuracy. Accuracy of tagging Adjectival Noun and sentence ending can be improved by increasing 

the size of the corpus and avoiding the errors in manual tagging.

7 Conclusion and Future Work 

This study presented a comprehensive, multi-level Sinhala POS tag set. This tag set covers most of 

the word classes and inflection based grammatical variations of the language. The new tag set overcomes 

the identified ambiguities and limitations of the UCSC Tag Set. The new tag set was designed by 

analysing the UCSC Tag set and the UCSC tagged corpus, which was a corpus of news articles. The 

new tag set is then used to tag a corpus created from official documents, a different domain, and found 

to be successful. Further, an SVM based approach is followed in creating an automatic tagger for 

Sinhala, which is found to outperform existing taggers proposed for Sinhala language up to now. 

The current accuracy of the tagger can be further improved by increasing the size of the corpus. 

Human errors in manual tagging has contributed to a certain percentage of errors in automatic tagging. 

The quality of the manually tagged corpus should be verified and improved further. Moreover, the tag 

set should be tested with other corpora of different domains to check the validity. Finally, the tagged 

corpus using the new tag set should be tested with advanced NLP tasks, such as machine translation, to 

evaluate the correctness and effect of the new tag set and the corpus tagged with it.
