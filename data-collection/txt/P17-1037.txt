Abstract

We present in this paper our approach for
modeling inter-topic preferences of Twit-
ter users: for example, those who agree
with the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)
also agree with free trade. This kind of
knowledge is useful not only for stance
detection across multiple topics but also
for various real-world applications includ-
ing public opinion surveys, electoral pre-
dictions, electoral campaigns, and online
debates. In order to extract users’ prefer-
ences on Twitter, we design linguistic pat-
terns in which people agree and disagree
about specific topics (e.g., “A is com-
pletely wrong”). By applying these lin-
guistic patterns to a collection of tweets,
we extract statements agreeing and dis-
agreeing with various topics. Inspired by
previous work on item recommendation,
we formalize the task of modeling inter-
topic preferences as matrix factorization:
representing users’ preferences as a user-
topic matrix and mapping both users and
topics onto a latent feature space that ab-
stracts the preferences. Our experimental
results demonstrate both that our proposed
approach is useful in predicting missing
preferences of users and that the latent
vector representations of topics success-
fully encode inter-topic preferences.

1 Introduction

Social media have changed the way people shape
public opinion. The latest survey by the Pew
Research Center reported that a majority of US
adults (62%) obtain news via social media, and
of those, 18% do so often (Gottfried and Shearer,
2016). Given that news and opinions are shared

and amplified by friend networks of individu-
als (Jamieson and Cappella, 2008), individuals are
thereby isolated from information that does not fit
well with their opinions (Pariser, 2011). Ironi-
cally, cutting-edge social media technologies pro-
mote ideological groups even with its potential to
deliver diverse information.

A large number of studies already analyzed
discussions, interactions, influences, and commu-
nities on social media along the political spec-
trum from liberal to conservative (Adamic and
Glance, 2005; Zhou et al., 2011; Cohen and Ruths,
2013; Bakshy et al., 2015; Wong et al., 2016).
Even though these studies provide intuitive vi-
sualizations and interpretations along the liberal-
conservative axis, political analysts argue that the
axis is flawed and insufficient for representing
public opinion and ideologies (Kerlinger, 1984;
Maddox and Lilie, 1984).

A potential solution for analyzing multiple axes
of the political spectrum on social media is stance
detection (Thomas et al., 2006; Somasundaran
and Wiebe, 2009; Murakami and Raymond, 2010;
Anand et al., 2011; Walker et al., 2012; Moham-
mad et al., 2016; Johnson and Goldwasser, 2016),
whose task is to determine whether the author of
a text is for, neutral, or against a topic (e.g., free
trade, immigration, abortion). However, stance
detection across different topics is extremely dif-
ficult. Anand et al. (2011) reported that a so-
phisticated method with topic-dependent features
substantially improved the performance of stance
detection within a topic, but such an approach
could not outperform a baseline method with sim-
ple n-gram features when evaluated across topics.
More recently, all participants of SemEval 2016
Task 6A (with five topics) could not outperform
the baseline supervised method using n-gram fea-
tures (Mohammad et al., 2016).

In addition, stance detection encounters dif-

ficulties with different user types. Cohen and
Ruths (2013) observed that existing methods on
stance detection fail on “ordinary” users because
such methods primarily obtain training and test
data from politically vocal users (e.g., politicians);
for example, they found that a stance detector
trained on a dataset with politicians achieved 91%
accuracy on other politicians but only achieved
54% accuracy on “ordinary” users. Establishing
a bridge across different topics and users remains
a major challenge not only in stance detection, but
also in social media analytics.

An important component in establishing this
bridge is commonsense knowledge about topics.
For example, consider a topic a revision of Arti-
cle 96 of the Japanese Constitution. We infer that
the statement “we should maintain armed forces”
tends to favor this topic even without any lexical
overlap between the topic and the statement. This
inference is reasonable because: the writer of the
statement favors armed forces; those who favor
armed forces also favor a revision of Article 91;
and those who favor a revision of Article 9 also fa-
vor a revision of Article 962. In general, this kind
of commonsense knowledge can be expressed in

1Article 9 prohibits armed forces in Japan.
2Article 96 specifies high requirements for making

amendments to Constitution of Japan (including Article 9).

the format: those who agree/disagree with topic
A also agree/disagree with topic B. We call this
kind of knowledge inter-topic preference through-
out this paper.

We conjecture that previous work on stance
detection indirectly learns inter-topic preferences
within the same target through the use of n-gram
features on a supervision data. In contrast, in the
present paper, we directly acquire inter-topic pref-
erences from an unlabeled corpus of tweets. This
acquired knowledge regarding inter-topic prefer-
ences is useful not only for stance detection, but
also for various real-world applications including
public opinion survey, electoral campaigns, elec-
toral predictions, and online debates.

Figure 1 provides an overview of this work. In
our system, we extract linguistic patterns in which
people agree and disagree about specific topics
(e.g., “A is completely wrong”); to accomplish
this, as described in Section 2.1, we make use of
hashtags within a large collection of tweets. The
patterns are then used to extract instances of users’
preferences regarding various topics, as detailed in
Section 2.2. Inspired by previous work on item
recommendation, in Section 3, we formalize the
task of modeling inter-topic preferences as a ma-
trix factorization: representing a sparse user-topic
matrix (i.e., the extracted instances) with the prod-

399



uct of low-rank user and topic matrices. These
low-rank matrices provide latent vector represen-
tations of both users and topics. This approach
is also useful for completing preferences of “or-
dinary” (i.e., less vocal) users, which fills the gap
between different types of users.

The contributions of this paper are threefold.

1. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
study that models inter-topic preferences for
unlimited targets on real-world data.

2. Our experimental results show that this ap-
proach can accurately predict missing topic
preferences of users accurately (80–94%).

3. Our experimental results also demonstrate
that the latent vector representations of topics
successfully encode inter-topic preferences,
e.g., those who agree with nuclear power
plants also agree with nuclear fuel cycles.

This study uses a Japanese Twitter corpus because
of its availability from the authors, but the core
idea is applicable to any language.

2 Mining Topic Preferences of Users

In this section, we describe how we collect state-
ments in which users agree or disagree with vari-
ous topics on Twitter, which then serves as source
data for modeling inter-topic preferences. More
formally, we are interested in acquiring a collec-
tion of tuples (u, t, v), where: u ∈ U is a user; U
is the set of all users on Twitter; t ∈ T is a topic;
T is the set of all topics; and v ∈ {+1,−1} is +1
when the user u agrees with the topic t and −1
otherwise (i.e., disagreement).

Throughout this work, we use a corpus consist-
ing of 35,328,745,115 Japanese tweets (7,340,730
users) crawled from February 6, 2013 to Septem-
ber 30, 2016. We removed retweets from the cor-
pus.

2.1 Mining Linguistic Patterns of Agreement
and Disagreement

We use linguistic patterns to extract tuples (u, t, v)
from the aforementioned corpus. More specifi-
cally, when a tweet message matches to one of
linguistic patterns of agreement (e.g., “t is nec-
essary”), we regard that the author u of the tweet
agrees with topic t. Conversely, a statement of dis-
agreement is identified by linguistic patterns for
disagreement (e.g., “t is unacceptable”).

In order to design linguistic patterns, we fo-
cus on hashtags appearing in the corpus that
have been popular clues for locating subjective
statements such as sentiments (Davidov et al.,
2010), emotions (Qadir and Riloff, 2014), and
ironies (Van Hee et al., 2016). Hashtags are
also useful for finding strong supporters and crit-
ics, as well as their target topics; for example,
#immigrantsWelcome indicates that the au-
thor favors immigrants; and #StopAbortion is
against abortion.

Based on this intuition, we design reg-
ular expressions for both pro hashtags
“#(.+)sansei”3 and con hashtags
“#(.+)hantai”4, where (.+) matches a
target topic. These regular expressions can find
users who have strong preferences to topics.
Using this approach, we extracted 31,068 occur-
rences of pro/con hashtags used by 18,582 users
for 4,899 topics. We regard the set of topics found
using this procedure as set of target topics T in
this study.

Each time we encounter a tweet containing a
pro/con hashtag, we searched for corresponding
textual statements as follows. Suppose that a
tweet includes a hashtag (e.g., #TPPsansei) for
a topic t (e.g., TPP). Assuming that the author of
the given tweet does not change their attitude to-
ward a topic over time, we search for other tweets
posted by the same author that also have the topic
keyword t. This process retrieves tweets like “I
support TPP.” Then, we replace the topic keyword
into a variable A to extract patterns, e.g., “I sup-
port A.” Here, the definition of the pattern unit is
language specific. For Japanese tweets, we simply
recognize a pattern that starts with a variable (i.e.,
topic) and ends at the end of the sentence5.

Because this procedure also extracts useless
patterns such as “to A” and “this is A”, we man-
ually choose useful patterns in a systematic way:
sort patterns in descending order of the number of
users who use the pattern; and check the sorted list
of patterns manually; and remove useless patterns.

3Unlike English hashtags, we systematically attach a noun
sansei, which stands for pro (agreement) in Japanese, to a
topic, for example, #TPPsansei. This paper uses the al-
phabetical expression sansei only for explanation; the ac-
tual pattern uses Chinese characters corresponding to sansei.

4A Japanese noun hantai stands for con (disagreement),
for example, #TPPhantai. This paper uses the alphabetical
expression hantai only for explanation; the actual pattern
uses Chinese characters corresponding to hantai.

5In English, this treatment roughly corresponds to extract-
ing a verb phrase with the variable A.

400



Using this approach, we obtained 100 pro patterns
(e.g., “welcome A” and “A is necessary”) and 100
con patterns (“do not letA” and “I don’t wantA”).

2.2 Extracting Instances of Topic Preferences
By using the pro and con patterns acquired using
the approach described in Section 2.1, we extract
instances of (u, t, v) as follows. When a sentence
in a tweet whose author is user u matches one of
the pro patterns (e.g., “t is necessary”) and the
topic t is included in the set of target topics T , we
recognize this as an instance of (u, t,+1). Sim-
ilarly, when a sentence matches one of the con
patterns (e.g., “I don’t want t”) and the topic t
is included in the set of target topics T , we rec-
ognize this as an instance of (u, t,−1). Using
this approach, we collected 25,805,909 tuples cor-
responding to 3,302,613 users and 4,899 topics.
Because these collected tuples included compar-
atively infrequent users and topics, we removed
users and topics that appeared less than five times.
In addition, there were also meaningless frequent
topics such as “of” and “it”. Therefore, we sorted
topics in descending order of their co-occurrence
frequencies with each of the pro patterns and con
patterns, and then removed meaningless topics in
the top 100 topics. This resulted in 9,961,509 tu-
ples regarding 273,417 users and 2,323 topics.

3 Matrix Factorization

Using the methods described in Section 2, from
the corpus, we collected a number of instances of
users’ preferences regarding various topics. How-
ever, Twitter users do not necessarily express pref-
erences for all topics. In addition, it is by nature
impossible to predict whether a new (i.e., nonexis-
tent in the data) user agrees or disagrees with given
topics. Therefore, in this section, we apply matrix
factorization (Koren et al., 2009) in order to pre-
dict missing values, inspired by research regard-
ing item recommendation (Bell and Koren, 2007;
Dror et al., 2011). In essence, matrix factorization
maps both users and topics onto a latent feature
space that abstracts topic preferences of users.

Here, letR be a sparse matrix of |U |×|T |. Only
when a user u expresses a preference for topic t do
we compute an element of the sparse matrix ru,t,

ru,t =
#(u, t,+1)−#(u, t,−1)
#(u, t,+1) + #(u, t,−1) (1)

Here, #(u, t,+1) and #(u, t,−1) represent the
numbers of occurrences of instances (u, t,+1)

and (u, t,−1), respectively. Thus, an element ru,t
approaches +1 as the user u favors the topic t,
and −1 otherwise. If the user u does not make
any statement regarding the topic t (i.e., neither
(u, t,+1) nor (u, t,−1) exists in the data), we do
not fill the corresponding element, leaving it as a
missing value.

Matrix factorization decomposes the sparse ma-
trix R into low-dimensional matrices P ∈ Rk×|U |
andQ ∈ Rk×|T |, where k is a parameter that spec-
ifies the number of dimensions of the latent space.
We minimize the following objective function to
find the matrices P and Q,

min
P,Q

∑

(u,t)∈R

(
(ru,t − puᵀqt)2

+λP ‖pu‖2 + λQ ‖qt‖2
)
. (2)

Here, (u, t) ∈ R is repeated for elements filled in
the sparse matrix R, pu ∈ Rk and qv ∈ Rk are
u column vectors of P and v column vectors of
Q, respectively, and λP ≥ 0 and λQ ≥ 0 repre-
sent coefficients of regularization terms. We call
pu and qt the user vector and topic vector, respec-
tively.

Using these user and topic vectors, we can pre-
dict an element r̂u,t that may be missing in the
original matrix R,

r̂u,t ' puᵀqt. (3)

We use libmf6 (Chin et al., 2015) to solve the
optimization problem in Equation 2. We set reg-
ularization coefficients λP = 0.1 and λQ = 0.1
and use default values for the other parameters of
libmf.

4.1 Determining the Dimension Parameter k
How good is the low-rank approximation found by
matrix factorization? And can we find the “sweet
spot” for the number of dimensions k of the la-
tent space? We investigate the reconstruction er-
ror of matrix factorization using different values
of k to answer these questions. We use Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE) to measure error,

RMSE =

Here, N is the number of elements in the sparse
matrix R (i.e., the number of known values).

Figure 2 shows RMSE values over iterations
of libmf with the dimension parameter k ∈
{1, 2, 5, 10, 30, 50, 100, 300, 500}. We observed
that the reconstruction error decreased as the itera-
tive method of libmf progressed. The larger the
number of dimensions k was, the smaller the re-
construction error became; the lowest reconstruc-
tion error was 0.3256 with k = 500. We also ob-
served the error with k = 1, which corresponds to
mapping users and topics onto one dimension sim-
ilarly to the political spectrum of liberal and con-
servative. Judging from the relatively high RMSE
values with k = 1, we conclude that it may be
difficult to represent everything in the data using
a one-dimensional axis. Based on this result, we
concluded that matrix factorization with k = 100
is sufficient for reconstructing the original matrix
R and therefore used this parameter value for the
rest of our experiments.

4.2 Predicting Missing Topic Preferences

How accurately can the user and topic vectors pre-
dict missing topic preferences? To answer this
question, we evaluate the accuracy in predicting
hidden preferences in the matrix R as follows.
First, we randomly selected 5% of existing ele-
ments in R and let Y represent the collection of
the selected elements (test set). We then perform
matrix factorization on the sparse matrix without
the selected elements of Y , that is, only with the
remaining 95% elements of R (training set). We
define the accuracy of the prediction as

Matrix factorization

Majority baseline

Figure 3: Prediction accuracy when changing the
threshold for the number of known topic prefer-
ences of each user.

Here, ru,t denotes the actual (i.e., self-declared)
preference values, r̂u,t represents the preference
value predicted by Equation 3, sign(.) represents
the sign of the argument, and 1(.) yields 1 only
when the condition described in the argument
holds and 0 otherwise. In other words, Equation 5
computes the proportion of correct predictions to
all predictions, assuming zero to be the decision
boundary between pro and con.

Figure 3 plots prediction accuracy values cal-
culated from different sets of users. Here the x-
axis represents a threshold θ, which filters out
users whose declarations of topic preferences are
no greater than θ topics. In other words, Figure
3 shows prediction accuracy when we know user
preferences for at least θ topics. For comparison,
we also include the majority baseline that predicts
pro and con based on the majority of preferences
regarding each topic in the training set.

Our proposed method was able to predict miss-
ing preferences with an 82.1% accuracy for users
stating preferences for at least five topics. This ac-
curacy increased as our method received more in-
formation regarding the users, reaching a 94.0%
accuracy when θ = 100. This result again in-
dicates that our proposed method reasonably uti-
lizes known preferences to complete missing pref-
erences.

In contrast, the performance of the majority
baseline decreased as it received more informa-
tion regarding the users. Because this result was
rather counter-intuitive, we examined the cause of
this phenomenon. Consequently, this result turned
out to be reasonable because preferences of vo-
cal users deviated from those of the average users.
Figure 4 illustrates this finding, showing the mean
of variances of preference values ru,t across self-

declared topics. In the figure, the x-axis repre-
sents a threshold θ, which filters out users whose
statements of topic preferences are no greater than
θ topics. We observe that the mean variance in-
creased as we focused on vocal users. Overall,
these results demonstrate the usefulness of user
and topic vectors in predicting missing prefer-
ences.

Table 1 shows examples in which missing pref-
erences of two users were predicted from known
statements of agreements and disagreements7. In
the table, predicted topics are accompanied by the
corresponding r̂u,t value in parentheses. As an
example, our proposed method predicted that the
user A, who is positive toward regime change but
negative toward Okinawa US military base, may
also be positive toward vote of non-confidence to
Cabinet but negative toward construction of a new
base.

4.3 Inter-topic Preferences

Do the topic vectors obtained by matrix fac-
torization capture inter-topic preferences, such as
“People who agree with A also agree with B”?

Because no dataset exists for this evaluation,
we created a dataset of pairwise inter-topic pref-
erences by using a crowdsourcing service8. Sam-
pling topic pairs randomly, we collected 150 topic
pairs whose cosine similarities of topic vectors

7We anonymized user names in these examples. In addi-
tion, we removed topics that are too discriminatory or aggres-
sive to other countries and races. Even though the experimen-
tal results of this paper do not necessarily reflect our idea, we
do not think it is a good idea to distribute politically incorrect
ideas through this paper.

8We used Yahoo! Crowdsourcing, a Japanese online ser-
vice for crowdsourcing.
http://crowdsourcing.yahoo.co.jp/

were below −0.6, 150 pairs whose cosine simi-
larities were between −0.6 and 0.6, and 150 pairs
whose cosine similarities were above 0.6. In this
way, we obtained 450 topic pairs for evaluation.

Given a pair of topics A and B, a crowd worker
was asked to choose a label from the following
three options: (a) those who agree/disagree with
topic A may also agree/disagree with topic B;
(b) those who agree/disagree with topic A may
conversely disagree/agree with topic B; (c) other-
wise (no association between A and B). Creating
twenty pairs of topics as gold data, we removed la-
beling results from workers whose accuracy is less
than 90%.

Consequently, we obtained 6–10 human judge-
ments for every topic pair. Regarding (a) as +1
point, (b) as −1 point, and (c) as 0 point, we com-
puted the mean of the points (i.e., average human
judgements) for each topic pair. Spearman’s rank
correlation coefficient (ρ) between cosine similar-
ity values of topic vectors and human judgements
was 0.2210. We could observe a moderate correla-
tion even though inter-topic preferences collected
in this manner were highly subjective.

In addition to the quantitative evaluation, as
summarized in Table 2, we also checked simi-
lar topics for three controversial topics, Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP), constitutional amend-
ment and right of foreigners to vote (Table 2).
Topics similar to LDP included synonymous ones
(e.g., Abe’s LDP and Abe administration) and
other topics promoted by the LDP (e.g., resuming
nuclear power plant operations, bus rapid tran-
sit (BRT) and hate speech countermeasure law).
Considering that people who support the LDP may
also tend to favor its policies, we found these re-
sults reasonable. As for the other example, consti-
tutional amendment had a feature vector that was
similar to that of amendment of Article 9, enforce-
ment of specific secret protection law and security
related law. From these results, we concluded that
topic vectors were able to capture inter-topic pref-
erences.

model the political spectrum from liberal to con-
servative (Adamic and Glance, 2005; Zhou et al.,
2011; Cohen and Ruths, 2013; Bakshy et al., 2015;
Wong et al., 2016), political parties (Tumasjan
et al., 2010; Boutet et al., 2013; Makazhanov
and Rafiei, 2013), and elections (O’Connor et al.,
2010; Conover et al., 2011).

Employing a single axis (e.g., liberal to conser-
vative) or a few axes (e.g., political parties and
candidates of elections), these studies provide in-
tuitive visualizations and interpretations along the
respective axes. In contrast, this study is the first
attempt to recognize and organize various axes of
topics on social media with no prior assumptions
regarding the axes. Therefore, we think our study
provides a new tool for computational social sci-
ence and political science that enables researchers
to analyze and interpret phenomena on social me-
dia.

Next, we describe previous research focused
on acquiring lexical knowledge of politics. Sim
et al. (2013) measured ideological positions of
candidates in US presidential elections from their

speeches. The study first constructs “cue lexicons”
from political writings labeled with ideologies
by domain experts, using sparse additive genera-
tive models (Eisenstein et al., 2011). These con-
structed cue lexicons were associated with such
ideologies as left, center, and right. Representing
each speech of a candidate with cue lexicons, they
inferred the proportions of ideologies of the candi-
date. The study requires a predefined set of labels
and text data associated with the labels.

Bamman and Smith (2015) presented an
unsupervised method for assessing the politi-
cal stance of a proposition, such as “global
warming is a hoax,” along the political spec-
trum of liberal to conservative. In their
work, a proposition was represented by a tu-
ple in the form 〈subject, predicate〉, for example,
〈global warming, hoax〉. They presented a gen-
erative model for users, subjects, and predicates
to find a one-dimensional latent space that corre-
sponded to the political spectrum.

Similar to our present work, their work (Bam-
man and Smith, 2015) did not require labeled data

404



to map users and topics (i.e., subjects) onto a la-
tent feature space. In their paper, they reported
that the generative model outperformed Principal
Component Analysis (PCA), which is a method
for matrix factorization. Empirical results here
probably reflected the underlying assumptions that
PCA treats missing elements as zero and not as
missing data. In contrast, in the present work,
we properly distinguish missing values from zero,
excluding missing elements of the original matrix
from the objective function of Equation 2. Further,
this work demonstrated the usefulness of the latent
space, that is, topic and user vectors, in predicting
missing topic preferences of users and inter-topic
preferences.

Fine-grained Opinion Analysis The method
presented in Section 2 is an instance of fine-
grained opinion analysis (Wiebe et al., 2005; Choi
et al., 2006; Johansson and Moschitti, 2010; Yang
and Cardie, 2013; Deng and Wiebe, 2015), which
extracts a tuple of a subjective opinion, a holder of
the opinion, and a target of the opinion from text.
Although these previous studies have the potential
to improve the quality of the user-topic matrix R,
unfortunately, no corpus or resource is available
for the Japanese language. We do not currently
have a large collection of English tweets, but com-
bining fine-grained opinion analysis with matrix
factorization is an immediate future work.

Causality Relation Some of inter-topic prefer-
ences in this work can be explained by causality
relation, for example, “TPP promotes free trade.”
A number of previous studies acquire instances of
causal relation (Girju, 2003; Do et al., 2011) and
promote/suppress relation (Hashimoto et al., 2012;
Fluck et al., 2015) from text. The causality knowl-
edge is useful for predicting (hypotheses of) future
events (Radinsky et al., 2012; Radinsky and Davi-
dovich, 2012; Hashimoto et al., 2015).

Inter-topic preferences, however, also include
pairs of topics in which causality relation hardly
holds. As an example, it is unreasonable to infer
that nuclear plant and railroading of bills have a
causal relation, but those who dislike nuclear plant
also oppose railroading of bills because presum-
ably they think the governing political parties rush
the bill for resuming a nuclear plant. In this study,
we model these inter-topic preferences based on
preferences of the public. That said, we have as a
promising future direction of our work plans to in-

corporate approaches to acquire causality knowl-
edge.

6 Conclusion

In this paper, we presented a novel approach for
modeling inter-topic preferences of users on Twit-
ter. Designing linguistic patterns for identifying
support and opposition statements, we extracted
users’ preferences regarding various topics from
a large collection of tweets. We formalized the
task of modeling inter-topic preferences as a ma-
trix factorization that maps both users and top-
ics onto a latent feature space that abstracts users’
preferences. Through our experimental results, we
demonstrated that our approach was able to accu-
rately predict missing topic preferences of users
(80–94%) and that our latent vector representa-
tions of topics properly encoded inter-topic pref-
erences.

For our immediate future work, we plan to em-
bed the topic and user vectors to create a cross-
topic stance detector. It is possible to generalize
our work to model heterogeneous signals, such
as interests and behaviors of people, for example,
“those who are interested in A also support B,”
and “those who favor A also vote for B”. There-
fore, we believe that our work will bring about new
applications in the field of NLP and other disci-
plines.
