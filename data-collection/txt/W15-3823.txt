Abstract 

Constructing standard and computable clini-
cal diagnostic criteria is an important and 

challenging research area in clinical informat-

ics community. In this study, we present our 

framework and methods for representing clin-

ical diagnostic criteria in Quality Data Model 

(QDM) using natural language processing 

(NLP) technologies. We used a clinical NLP 

tool known as cTAKES for preprocessing of 

textual diagnostic criteria. We created map-

pings between cTAKES type system and 

QDM elements in both datatype and data lev-
els. We evaluated the performance of our 

NLP-based approach by annotating 218 indi-

vidual diagnostic criteria in the categories of 

Symptom and Laboratory Test. In conclusion, 

our NLP-based approach is a feasible solu-

tion in developing diagnostic criteria repre-

sentation and computerization. 

1 Introduction 

The term diagnostic criteria designates the spe-
cific combination of signs, symptoms, and test 

results that the clinician uses to attempt to deter-

mine the correct diagnosis
1
. It is one kind of the 

most valuable sources of knowledge for support-
ing clinical decision-making and improving pa-

_criteria 

tient care (Yager and Mcintyre, 2014). Diagnos-

tic criteria are a critical evidence resource of 
clinical decision support system; however, diag-

nostic criteria are usually described without uni-

form standard, scattered over different media 

such as medical textbooks, literatures and clini-
cal practice guidelines, and mostly in free text 

formats. Several methods based on natural lan-

guage processing (NLP) technology have been 
reported and used in structuring free-text-based 

clinical guidelines, clinical notes and electronic 

health records (EHRs), as (Rea, etc., 2012) and 
(Ohno-Machado, etc., 2013). However, there are 

not sufficient researches on using NLP-based 

approaches to support the formalization of free-

text diagnostic criteria. To achieve computable 
diagnostic criteria, we consider that a computa-

ble model to represent diagnosis criteria and the 

use of clinical NLP applications to support the 
modeling are two essential research areas. 

Current efforts on development of international 

recommendation standard models in clinical do-

mains have laid the foundation for modeling and 
representing computable diagnostic criteria. Na-

tional Quality Forum (NQF) Quality Data Model 

(QDM) (Quality Data Model, 2015) as an infor-
mation model that describes clinical concepts in 

a standardized format. It allows quality measure 

developers and many clinical researchers or per-
formers to describe clearly and unambiguously 

the data required to calculate the performance 

measure. QDM is designed with the purpose to 

177



allowing EHRs (Li,  etc., 2012) and other clinical 

electronic systems to share a common under-

standing and interpretation of the clinical data. In 

a previous study, researcher Jiang (2015) evalu-
ated the application feasibility of QDM through a 

data-driven approach and demonstrated that the 

use of QDM is feasible in building a standards-
based information model for representing com-

putable diagnostic criteria. 

On clinical NLP studies, many NLP tools cur-
rently are applied in the clinical unstructured free 

text processing and also support terminology 

annotation, such as Health Information Text Ex-

traction tool (HITex)
2
, MetaMap (Aronson and 

Lang, 2010), OpenNLP
3
 and Clinical Text Anal-

ysis and Knowledge Extraction System 

(cTAKES) (Savova, etc., 2010). Some studies 
compared the performance of the frequently used 

NLP tools, and the results showed that cTAKES 

scored best in both performance and usability. 
cTAKES is an open source Apache project and it 

is a NLP system for extraction of information 

from electronic medical record clinical free-text. 

cTAKES was built on the Unstructured Infor-
mation Management Architecture (UIMA) 

framework which is an open source framework 

designed by IBM and a series of comprehensive 
NLP methods (Bruce, 2012). In this study, we 

use cTAKES as a NLP tool to support the for-

malization of diagnostic criteria. 

The objective of our study is to describe our ef-
forts in developing a semi-automatic approach 

using NLP to facilitate the representation of clin-

ical diagnostic criteria in QDM. 

2 Materials & Methods 

2.1 Materials 

cTAKES: The components of cTAKES are 
specifically trained for the clinical domain, and 

create rich linguistic and semantic annotations 

that can be utilized by clinical decision support 
systems and clinical research

. cTAKES 

discovers clinical named entities and clinical 

events using a dictionary lookup algorithm and a 
subset of the Unified Medical Language System 

(UMLS)

, mainly including the following 

mentions: disease/disorders, sign/symptoms, 

medications, anatomical sites and procedures.

.html.

5 http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/ 

Besides, cTAKES extract named entity attributes 

and assigns values for the attributes such as 

UMLS concept unique identifiers (CUIs) and 

SNOMED CT codes, polarity, uncertainty, 
conditional, etc. In this study, we used the 

cTAKES version 3.2.1.  

NQF QDM: The QDM consists of criteria for 
data elements, relationships for relating data el-

ement criteria to each other, and functions for 

filtering criteria to the subset of data elements 
that are of interest

6
. The basic components of the 

QDM include: category (e.g., Symptom), 

datatype (e.g., Symptom, Active), attribute (e.g., 

information about severity, start Datetime, stop 
Datetime, and ordinality), and value set compris-

ing concept codes from one or more code sys-

tems. In this study, we used the QDM version 4.1 
(Quality Data Model, 2015). 

2.2 Methods 

Figure 1 shows a framework we designed for the 

NLP-supported QDM modeling of diagnostic 

criteria. The framework comprises three modules. 
The first module is an NLP annotation module. 

We use cTAKES as a NLP tool to support struc-

tured representation of diagnostic criteria. The 
second module is a data model transformation 

between cTAKES type system and QDM ele-

ments. The transformation is supported using 
both manual mapping strategies and machine 

learning algorithms. The third module is a uni-

fied web interface for human review. As the out-

put, all collected data elements, value sets and 
logic expressions of diagnostic criteria are for-

malized by using QDM-based standard represen-

tation.

2.2.1 NLP annotation 

We first used the cTAKES to perform NLP 

annotation on textual diagnostic criteria. 

cTAKES is a modular system of pipelined 
components combining rule-based and machine 

learning techniques, introduced in  (Savova, 

Masanz, etc., 2010). As an operable interface, 
UIMA provides the tooling for selecting which 

descriptors are used together and determining the 

order of the descriptors, see detail in (cTAKES 
3.2 Component Use Guide, 2015). Dictionaries 

such as UMLS, SNOMED CT and RxNorm are 

integrated into cTAKES clinical pipeline. 

2.2.2 Data Model Transformation 
We implemented the model mapping and data 

transformation on two levels: the datatype-level 

mapping and the data-level mapping. 

(1) Datatype-level Mapping 
We created the datatype-level mappings between 

cTAKES UIMA Common Analysis System 
(CAS) type system and QDM datatypes, as well 

as corresponding attributes and features between 

these two heterogeneous schemas (Figure 2). We 

established the mapping relations through 
analyzing the textual definitions of datatypes in 

both models. Datatype-level mappings are 

mainly focused on 7 selected QDM datatypes 
and 8 cTAKES types that frequently appear in 

diagnostic criteria.  

 
Figure 2. Datatype-level Mapping between 

cTAKES type system and QDM elements 

(2) Data-level Mapping 
The second level of mapping analysis is the data-

level mappings which are created between the 

data structure of cTAKES CAS and QDM Health 

Quality Measure Format (HQMF) (HQMF 
Templates for QDM December 2013, 2015). The 

cTAKES processes text and stores the results in 

the UIMA-CAS structure, whereas the HQMF as 
a standard format is used to represent QDM-

based eMeasure data. All cTAKES instance data 

output as CAS XML data and are converted into 

HQMF XML data using the data-level mapping 

rules. 

Figure 3 illustrates the data-level mapping rules 

between CAS and HQMF elements we created 

for QDM datatype Laboratory Test, Performed.

CAS XML and QDM HQMF XML 

2.2.3 Evaluation 

For evaluation, we manually annotated a 

collection of individual criteria with QDM 
datatypes and attributes. We used the manual 

annotations as gold standard and evaluated the 

performance of NLP-based annotations. Two 

authors (HN, GJ) reviewed the annotations and 
the consensus was resolved through discussions. 

Three standard measures were used to describe 

the performance of the NLP module: precision, 
recall and F-measure. 

3 Results 

To implement experiment and evaluation, we 
first collected 218 individual criteria in the 

Symptom and Laboratory Test categories. The 

individual criteria were extracted manually from 
the text of 44 diagnostic criteria in 13 different 

clinical topics (an example of textual diagnostic 

criteria is shown in Appendix A). All the 

diagnostic criteria are collected from a number of 
sources including medical textbooks, journal 

papers, documents issued by professional 

organization (such as the World Health 
Organization - WHO) and Internet. Table 1 

shows the number of individual criteria of the 13 

clinical topics. We used a cTAKES (V.3.2.1) 
NLP analysis engine known as the 

AggregatePlaintxtUMLSProcessor and 

processed the test criteria. Using the datatype-

179



level mapping rules we created and the cTAKES 

annotation results of two EventMentions 

(LabMention and SignSymptomMention), our 

algorithm automatically allocated a QDM 
datatype for each individual diagnostic criteria.

vidual criteria.

The allocation results could reflect the automatic 

mapping classification performance for QDM 

datatypes (Laboratory Test, Performed and 
Symptom, Active). For example, Figure 4 and 

Figure 5 show the text of two individual 

diagnostic criteria with CTAKES annotations in 

LabMention and SignSymptomMention. 

Example1: Thrombocytopenia (platelets 

<100,000 cells/mm3) 

 

Figure 4. “platelets” is highlighted as an  

cTAKES annotation in LabMention 

Example2: Gastrointestinal-hepatic dysfunction: 
Moderate (diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, 

abdominal pain) 

 

Figure 5. “diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal 

pain” are highlighted as the cTAKES annotations 
in SignSymptomMention. 

After automatically mapping based on our 

mapping rules between two systems, diagnostic 

criteria in free-text are transformed into QDM 

based HQML XML structure. One of the QDM 
data examples attached in the Appendix B. Table 

2 shows the evaluation results in terms of 

whether mapping rules correctly allocate a QDM 
datatype for an individual criterion.  

To evaluate the performance of data-level 

mappings, we tested the mapping results of 78 
individual diagnostic criteria which were 

annotated manually using the QDM datatype 

Laboratory Test, Performed. The test was mainly 

focused on the mapping performance of four 
attribute elements, including code/code system, 

laboratory test value, measurement and unit, 

comparison operator. Table 3 shows the 
evaluation results of elements mapping in the 

QDM datatype Laboratory Test, Performed.

4 Discussion 

To bridge the semantic gap between cTAKES 
type system and QDM Model, we performed 

critical element analysis and created element 

mappings in both datatype and data levels. As 

cTAKES UIMA-CAS and QDM both are 
comprehensive models with independent 

structures, more semantic analysis need to be 

studied in order to extend our current mapping 
rules, e.g., the mapping analysis on QDM 

temporal representation and cTAKES temporal 

type. Furthermore, there exist elements that 

could not be directly mapped between two 
models under different contexts.  

180



Previous studies investigated the eligibility 

criteria in clinical trial protocol and developed 

approaches (known as EliXR) for eligibility 

criteria extraction and semantic representation, 
and used hierarchical clustering for dynamic 

categorization of such criteria (Weng , etc., 2011) 

(Luo, etc.,2011). In future, we will develop 
machine learning-based methods leveraging the 

EliXR approach to enable the analysis for a large 

amount of clinical diagnostic criteria data.  

The study demonstrated overall performance of 

cTAKES used for generating the QDM-based 

representation of diagnostic criteria. The 

evaluation results in Table 2 indicated that 
criteria in the Laboratory Test category could be 

automatically classified into the QDM datatype 

effectively; whereas the performance for 
classifying criteria in the Symptom category was 

sub-optimal.  The reason is mainly because that 

cTAKES uses the SignSymptomMention that 
doesn’t distinguish between a sign and a 

symptom. The evaluation results in Table 3 

indicated that the code/code system and value 

mappings could acquire satisfactory performance 
whereas the performance for the unit annotation 

is good in precision but sub-optimal in recall. In 

addition, the operator recognition was 
insufficient, for examples, in criteria 'Sézary cells 
with a diameter > 14 um representing > 20% of the 

circulating lymphocytes' ， ‘%’ is annotated as 
Symbol but ‘>’ is not recognized in cTAKES 

that cause low precision. Above all, the mapping 

rules were able to generate validated QDM 

datatypes and related elements, covering most 
typical model elements used in diagnostic criteria. 

NLP-based technologies could provide a semi-

automatic way to support the preliminary 
classification and enable a pattern-based QDM 

representation. 

5 Conclusion 

In this study, we demonstrated that clinical NLP 

tool (e.g., cTAKES) could support the QDM 

modeling of free-text diagnostic criteria in a 
semi-automatic way. We are actively working on 

developing machine learning algorithms to im-

prove the performance of our NLP-based ap-

proaches for representing clinical diagnostic cri-
teria in QDM.
