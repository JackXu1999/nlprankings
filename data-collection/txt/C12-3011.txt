ABSTRACT 

In this paper we focus on detecting Romanian words without rhymes, using knowledge about 
stressed vowels and syllabification. We also investigate quantitative aspects and the etymological 
origins of the Romanian words without rhymes.

1 Introduction 

Rhyme represents the correspondence of final sounds of words, beginning with the rightmost 
stressed vowel. Hence, two words rhyme if their final stressed vowels and all following 
phonemes are identical (Reddy and Knight 2011). 

In Romanian language the accent is variable and therefore cannot be determined in a 
deterministic manner. It can differentiate between words (“mozaic” – adjective, “mozaic” - noun) 
and grammatical forms (DOOM dictionary). Syllabification is a challenging and important task, 
considering that a rigorous research on syllable structure and characteristics cannot be achieved 
without a complete database of the syllables in a given language (Dinu and Dinu 2006, Dinu and 
Dinu 2009).  Some attempts have been made for the automation of syllabification. Dinu and Dinu 
(2005) proposed a parallel manner of syllabification for Romanian words, using some parallel 
extensions of insertion grammars, and in (Dinu, 2003) is proposed a sequential manner of 
syllabification, based on a Marcus contextual grammar. 

Identifying words without rhyme is an important problem for poets and especially for automatic 
or assisted poetry translation. Reddy and Knight (2011) emphasize another related research area – 
historical linguistics, as rhymes of words in poetry can provide valuable information about dialect 
and pronunciation at a given time. We propose an instrument which can provide rhyming words 
for a given input word and offers other features as well, such as detection of words without 
rhymes and clustering words based on syllable number. These tools contribute to determination 
of rhythm and metrics. This instrument can be very useful in identifying words with sparse 
rhyme. Reddy and Knight (2011) affirm that repetition of rhyming pairs is inevitable in 
collections of rhyming poetry and is partially caused by sparsity of rhymes. In addition, we focus 
on identifying the etymological origins for input words in a given language. This feature proves 
especially useful for words without rhyme. 

2 Related work 

To our knowledge, there are two sites that focus on finding rhymes for Romanian words 
(http://www.webdex.ro/online/dictionar/rime and http://www.spunetiparerea.ro/dictionar-de-
rime/cauta-rime.php). Both of them accept an input word and identify rhyming words. However, 
both systems determine rather the longest common suffix than rhyme. To our knowledge, they do 
not provide the other features that we discussed: the ability to automatically identify all words 
without rhymes from the dictionary and clustering words based on syllable number.  

3 On the rhyme detection 

The dataset we used is a Romanian language resource containing 525528 words, including all 
inflectional forms (Barbu, 2008). For each word, the following pieces of information are 
provided: syllabification, type of syllabification (based on pronunciation or structure), position of 
the stressed vowels and inflectional form. Below is represented a word entry in our dataset. The 
“obs” field indicates that the word is syllabified based on its structure.

In order to determine the words that do not rhyme with other words, we focused on clustering 
them based on their rhymes.  

1. For polysyllabic words, which had stressed vowels marked, we considered the substring 
beginning with the rightmost stressed vowel.  

2. For monosyllabic words, which did not have stressed vowels marked, we had to focus 
on the position of the vowels within diphthongs and triphthongs in order to correctly 
determine the rhymes. 
2.1. Therefore, for ascendant diphthongs we considered the substring beginning with the 

second character of the structure and for descendant diphthongs we considered the 
substring beginning with the first character of the structure.  

2.2. We applied similar rules for triphthongs, considering the substring beginning with 
the third character of the structure for ascendant triphthongs and the substring 
beginning with the second character of the structure for balanced triphthongs.  

3. Once all the words in the dataset were clustered based on their rhymes, we easily 
identified those that did not have any correspondent words and were, hence, without 
rhyme. 

We identified 8851 different rhymes, among which the most frequent is “áţi”, having 8142 
corresponding words. 10808 words of our database (2.05%) do not have rhyme. 

  

FIGURE 2 – Words with rhymes FIGURE 3 – Words without rhymes 

Some observations can be derived from these charts. Most words with rhymes have more than 
four syllables, while most words without rhymes have three syllables. The number of 
monosyllabic words that do not have rhyme is small, only 174 out of 2894 do not rhyme with any 
other word. For each syllable cluster, the number of rhyming words is greater than the number of 

89



words without rhymes. The percentages in Table 1 do not add up to 100% because of the 
rounding.

Once we detected which words of the dataset rhyme with other words, we could implement the 
other features stated above. Our tool provides rhyming words for a given input, relevant in 
automatic or assisted poetry translation. Below are selected words that rhyme with the 
monosyllabic word “strict”, whose rhyme is “íct”. The output words are syllabified and their 
stressed vowels are marked. It can be easily observed that all retrieved words have the same 
rhyme as the input word.

Another important feature of our tool is the capability of clustering words based on their number 
of syllables. This feature proves very useful in identifying rhythm and metrics for poetry. In 
Figure 5 our tool identified words having an equal number of syllables with the Romanian word 
“geotip”, which is formed by three syllables (“ge-o-típ”).

FIGURE 5 – Clustering words based on number of syllables 

Our tool is able to identify words without rhymes, based on the algorithm we described above. In 
addition, the number of syllables can be selected, in order to retrieve only words without rhyme 
having the desired number of syllables. This feature is demonstrated below by selecting words 
without rhymes formed by four syllables. 

 

FIGURE 6 – Retrieving words without rhyme 

After identifying words without rhymes, we were interested in establishing their etymological 
origin. In order to automatically detect this information, we used the dexonline.ro database 
(Copyright (C) 2004-2012 DEX online (http://dexonline.ro)), which gathers information from 
numerous Romanian dictionaries. We were thus able to determine the origins of the words in our 
dataset. This feature is valuable especially for words without rhymes. In Figure 7 our tool 
detected the origin of the word “legumă” and provided the Latin corresponding word 
(“legumen”).

Conclusion and perspectives 

In this paper we present a method of identifying words without rhyme using knowledge regarding 
stressed vowels and syllabification applied on a dataset containing 525528 Romanian words, 
including all inflectional forms. Our main objective was to determine the words that do not have 
rhyme and to analyse their syllabic structure and etymological origin.  The main result is that 
2.05% of the words do not have rhyme. Most words with rhymes have more than four syllables, 
while most words without rhymes have three syllables.  

Further, we presented a tool that is able to identify words without rhymes, to cluster words based 
on syllable number, to retrieve rhyming words for a given input and to identify etymological 
origins of the words. Being able to achieve all these pieces of information, our tool can be 
relevant in detection of words with sparse rhyme and automatic or assisted poetry translation.  
This research area has received attention in the past, but less effort has been spent on poetry 
analysis and translation until now (Greene et al 2010).
