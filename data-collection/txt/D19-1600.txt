Abstract

Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) has
become enormously popular recently and has
attracted a lot of attention. However, the exist-
ing reading comprehension datasets are mostly
in English. In this paper, we introduce a Span-
Extraction dataset for Chinese machine read-
ing comprehension to add language diversities
in this area. The dataset is composed by near
20,000 real questions annotated on Wikipedia
paragraphs by human experts. We also anno-
tated a challenge set which contains the ques-
tions that need comprehensive understanding
and multi-sentence inference throughout the
context. We present several baseline systems
as well as anonymous submissions for demon-
strating the difficulties in this dataset. With
the release of the dataset, we hosted the Sec-
ond Evaluation Workshop on Chinese Ma-
chine Reading Comprehension (CMRC 2018).
We hope the release of the dataset could fur-
ther accelerate the Chinese machine reading
comprehension research.1

1 Introduction

To read and comprehend natural languages is the
key to achieve advanced artificial intelligence.
Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) aims
to comprehend the context of given articles and
answer the questions based on them. Various
types of machine reading comprehension datasets
have been proposed, such as cloze-style reading
comprehension (Hermann et al., 2015; Hill et al.,
2015; Cui et al., 2016), span-extraction reading
comprehension (Rajpurkar et al., 2016; Trischler
et al., 2016), open-domain reading comprehension
(Nguyen et al., 2016; He et al., 2017), reading
comprehension with multiple-choice (Richardson
et al., 2013; Lai et al., 2017), etc. Along with

the development of the reading comprehension
dataset, various neural network approaches have
been proposed and made a big advancement in this
area (Kadlec et al., 2016; Cui et al., 2017; Dhingra
et al., 2017; Wang and Jiang, 2016; Xiong et al.,
2016; Liu et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017; Hu et al.,
2018; Wang et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2018).

We also have seen various efforts on the con-
struction of Chinese machine reading compre-
hension datasets. In cloze-style reading compre-
hension, Cui et al. (2016) proposed a Chinese
cloze-style reading comprehension dataset: Peo-
ple’s Daily & Children’s Fairy Tale. To add dif-
ficulties to the dataset, along with the automati-
cally generated evaluation sets (development and
test), they also release a human-annotated evalua-
tion set. Later, Cui et al. (2018) propose another
dataset, which is gathered from children’s reading
material. To add more diversity and for further in-
vestigation on transfer learning, they also provide
another evaluation dataset, which is also annotated
by human experts, but the query is more natu-
ral than the cloze type. The dataset was used in
the first evaluation workshop on Chinese machine
reading comprehension (CMRC 2017). In open-
domain reading comprehension, He et al. (2017)
propose a large-scale open-domain Chinese ma-
chine reading comprehension dataset (DuReader),
which contains 200k queries annotated from the
user query logs on the search engine. Shao et al.
(2018) proposed a reading comprehension dataset
in Traditional Chinese.

Though we have seen that the current machine
learning approaches have surpassed the human
performance on the SQuAD dataset (Rajpurkar
et al., 2016), we wonder if these state-of-the-art
models could also give a similar performance on
the dataset of different languages. To further ac-
celerate the development of the machine read-
ing comprehension research, we propose a span-

extraction dataset for Chinese machine reading
comprehension. Figure 1 shows an example of the
proposed dataset. The main contributions of our
work can be concluded as follows.

• We propose a Chinese span-extraction read-
ing comprehension dataset which contains near
20,000 human-annotated questions, to add lin-
guistic diversity in reading comprehension field.

• To thoroughly test the ability of the MRC sys-
tems, besides the development and test set, we
also make a challenge set which contains care-
fully annotated questions that require various
clues in the passage. The BERT-based ap-
proaches could only give under 50% F1-score
on this set, indicating its difficulty.

• The proposed Chinese RC data could also be
a resource for cross-lingual research purpose
when studied along with SQuAD and other sim-
ilar datasets.

2 The Proposed Dataset

2.1 Task Definition
Generally, the reading comprehension task can
be described as a triple 〈P,Q,A〉, where P rep-
resents Passage, Q represents Question and the
A represents Answer. Specifically, for span-
extraction reading comprehension task, the ques-
tion is annotated by the human, which is much
more natural than the cloze-style MRC datasets
(Hill et al., 2015; Cui et al., 2016). The answer A
should be a span which is directly extracted from

the passage P . According to most of the works on
SQuAD, the task can be simplified by predicting
the start and end pointer in the passage (Wang and
Jiang, 2016).

2.2 Data Pre-Processing
We downloaded Chinese portion of Wikipedia
webpage dump2 on Jan 22, 2018 and used
open-source toolkit Wikipedia Extractor3 for pre-
processing the raw files into plain text. We also
convert the Traditional Chinese characters into
Simplified Chinese for normalization purpose us-
ing opencc4 toolkit.

2.3 Human Annotation
The questions in the proposed dataset are com-
pletely annotated by human experts, which is dif-
ferent from previous works that rely on the auto-
matic data generation (Hermann et al., 2015; Hill
et al., 2015; Cui et al., 2016). Before annotating,
the document is divided into several passages, and
each passage is limited to have no more than 500
Chinese words, where the word is counted by us-
ing LTP (Che et al., 2010). Then, the annotator
was instructed to first evaluate the appropriateness
of the passages, because some of the passages are
extremely difficult for the public to understand.
Following rules are applied when discarding the
passages.

• Contain over 30% non-Chinese characters.

• Contain many professional words that hard to
understand.

• Contains many special characters and symbols.

• The paragraph is written in classical Chinese,
which is substantially different from the Chi-
nese language nowadays.

After identifying the passage is appropriate for
annotation, the annotator will read the passage and
ask the questions based on it and annotated a pri-
mary answer. During the question annotation, the
following rules are applied.

• No more than five questions for each passage.

• The answer MUST be a span in the passage to
meet the task definition.

• Encourage the question diversity, such as
who/when/where/why/how, etc.

• Avoid directly using the description in the pas-
sage. Use paraphrase or syntax transformation
to add difficulties for answering.

• Long answers (say over 30 characters) will be
discarded.

For the evaluation sets, i.e., development, test,
challenge, there are three answers available for
better evaluation. Besides the primary answer that
was annotated by the question proposer, we also
invite two additional annotators to write the sec-
ond and third answers for the question. During
this phase, the annotators could not see the pri-
mary answer to ensure the answer was not copied
from others and encourage the diversities in the
answer.

2.4 Challenge Set

In order to examine how well can reading compre-
hension models deal with the questions that need
comprehensive reasoning over various clues in the
context, we additionally annotated a small chal-
lenge set for this purpose while keeping the span-
extraction style. The annotation was also done by
three annotators in a similar way that for develop-
ment and test set. Figure 1 shows an example in
the challenge set. The question should meet the
following standards to be qualified into this set.

12.30%

8.60% 1.20%

7.80%

12.80%

5.70%

51.40%

where who how what when why other

Figure 2: Question types of the development set.

• The answer cannot be only inferred by a single
sentence in the passage if the answer is a single
word or short phrase. We encourage the annota-
tor to ask the questions that need comprehensive
reasoning in the passage to increase the difficul-
ties.

• If the answer belongs to a type of named entity,
or specific genre (such as date, color, etc.), it
can not be the only one in the context, or the
machine could easily pick it out according to its
type. For example, if there is only one person
name appears in the context, then it cannot be
used for annotating questions. There should be
at least two person names that could mislead the
machine for answering.

the Chinese language is quite different from En-
glish, we adapt the original metrics in the follow-
ing ways. Note that, the common punctuations,
white spaces are ignored for normalization.

3.1 Exact Match

Measure the exact match between the prediction
and ground truths that is 1 for the exact match.
Otherwise, the score is 0. This is the same as the
one proposed by Rajpurkar et al. (2016).

3.2 F1-Score

Measure the character-level fuzzy match between
the prediction and ground truths. Instead of treat-
ing the predictions and ground truths as bag-of-
words, we calculate the length of the longest com-
mon sequence (LCS) between them and compute
the F1-score accordingly. We take the maximum
F1 over all of the ground truth answers for a given
question. Note that, non-Chinese words will not
be segmented into characters.

3.3 Estimated Human Performance

We also report the estimated human performance
in order to measure the difficulty of the proposed
dataset. As we have illustrated in the previous sec-
tion, there are three answers for each question in
development, test, and challenge set. Unlike Ra-
jpurkar et al. (2016), we use a cross-validation
method to calculate the performance. We regard
the first answer as human prediction and treat the
rest of the answers as ground truths. In this way,

we can get three human prediction performance by
iteratively regarding the first, second, and third an-
swer as the human prediction. Finally, we calcu-
late the average of three results as the final esti-
mated human performance on this dataset.

4 Experimental Results

4.1 Baseline System
Following Devlin et al. (2019), we adopt BERT
for our baseline system. Specifically, we slightly
modify the run squad.py script5 for adjusting
our dataset, while keeping the most of the original
implementation. For the baseline system, we used
an initial learning rate of 3e-5 with a batch size
of 32 and trained for two epochs. The maximum
lengths of document and query are set to 512 and
64.

4.2 Results
The results are shown in Table 2. Besides the base-
line systems, we also include the participants’ re-
sults of CMRC 2018 evaluation. We release the
training and development set to the public and
accepted submissions from participants to evalu-
ate their models on the hidden test and challenge
set to preserve the integrity of the evaluation pro-
cess following Rajpurkar et al. (2016). As we can
see that most of the participants could obtain over
80 in the test F1. While compared to F1 met-
ric, the EM metric is substantially lower compared

to the SQuAD dataset (usually within 10 points).
This suggests that how to determine the exact span
boundary in Chinese machine reading comprehen-
sion plays a key role to improve the system perfor-
mance.

Not surprisingly, as shown in the last column of
Table 2, though the top-ranked systems obtain de-
cent scores on the development and test set, they
are failed to give satisfactory results on the chal-
lenge set. However, as we can see that the es-
timated human performance on the development,
test, and challenge set are relatively similar, where
the challenge set gives slightly lower scores. We
also observed that though Z-Reader obtains best
scores on the test set, it failed to give consistent
performances on the EM metric of the challenge
set. This suggests that the current reading compre-
hension models are relatively not capable of han-
dling difficult questions that need comprehensive
reasoning among several clues in the passage.

BERT-based approaches show competitive
performance against participants submissions.6

Though traditional models have higher scores in
the test set, when it comes to the challenge set,
BERT-based baselines are consistently higher,
demonstrating that rich representation provided
by BERT is beneficial for solving harder questions
and generalize well among both easy and hard
questions.

5 Conclusion

In this work, we propose a span-extraction dataset
for Chinese machine reading comprehension. The
dataset is annotated by human experts with near
20,000 questions as well as a challenging set
which is composed of the questions that need rea-
soning over multiple clues. The evaluation re-
sults show that the machine could give excellent
scores on the development and test set with only
near 10 points below the estimated human perfor-
mance in F1-score. However, when it comes to
the challenge set, the scores are declining dras-
tically while the human performance remains al-
most the same with the non-challenge set, indicat-
ing that there are still potential challenges in de-
signing more sophisticated models to improve the
performance. We hope the release of this dataset
could bring language diversity in machine reading

tigation on solving the questions that need com-
prehensive reasoning over multiple clues.
