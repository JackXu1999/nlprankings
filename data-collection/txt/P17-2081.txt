Abstract

We show that the task of question answer-
ing (QA) can significantly benefit from the
transfer learning of models trained on a
different large, fine-grained QA dataset.
We achieve the state of the art in two
well-studied QA datasets, WikiQA and
SemEval-2016 (Task 3A), through a basic
transfer learning technique from SQuAD.
For WikiQA, our model outperforms the
previous best model by more than 8%.
We demonstrate that finer supervision pro-
vides better guidance for learning lexical
and syntactic information than coarser su-
pervision, through quantitative results and
visual analysis. We also show that a sim-
ilar transfer learning procedure achieves
the state of the art on an entailment task.

1 Introduction

Question answering (QA) is a long-standing chal-
lenge in NLP, and the community has introduced
several paradigms and datasets for the task over
the past few years. These paradigms differ from
each other in the type of questions and answers
and the size of the training data, from a few hun-
dreds to millions of examples.

We are particularly interested in the context-
aware QA paradigm, where the answer to each
question can be obtained by referring to its accom-
panying context (paragraph or a list of sentences).
Under this setting, the two most notable types of
supervisions are coarse sentence-level and fine-
grained span-level. In sentence-level QA, the task
is to pick sentences that are most relevant to the
question among a list of candidates (Yang et al.,
2015). In span-level QA, the task is to locate the

smallest span in the given paragraph that answers
the question (Rajpurkar et al., 2016).

In this paper, we address coarser, sentence-
level QA through a standard transfer learning1

technique of a model trained on a large, span-
supervised QA dataset. We demonstrate that the
target task not only benefits from the scale of the
source dataset but also the capability of the fine-
grained span supervision to better learn syntactic
and lexical information.

For the source dataset, we pretrain on
SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), a recently-
released, span-supervised QA dataset. For the
source and target models, we adopt BiDAF (Seo
et al., 2017), one of the top-performing mod-
els in the dataset’s leaderboard. For the tar-
get datasets, we evaluate on two recent QA
datasets, WikiQA (Yang et al., 2015) and Se-
mEval 2016 (Task 3A) (Nakov et al., 2016), which
possess sufficiently different characteristics from
that of SQuAD. Our results show 8% improve-
ment in WikiQA and 1% improevement in Se-
mEval. In addition, we report state-of-the-art re-
sults on recognizing textual entailment (RTE) in
SICK (Marelli et al., 2014) with a similar transfer
learning procedure.

2 Background and Data

Modern machine learning models, especially deep
neural networks, often significantly benefit from
transfer learning. In computer vision, deep con-
volutional neural networks trained on a large im-
age classification dataset such as ImageNet (Deng
et al., 2009) have proved to be useful for initial-
izing models on other vision tasks, such as ob-
ject detection (Zeiler and Fergus, 2014). In nat-

1 The borderline between transfer learning and domain
adaptation is often ambiguous (Mou et al., 2016). We choose
the term “transfer learning” because we also adapt the pre-
trained QA model to an entirely different task, RTE.

ural language processing, domain adaptation has
traditionally been an important topic for syntactic
parsing (McClosky et al., 2010) and named entity
recognition (Chiticariu et al., 2010), among oth-
ers. With the popularity of distributed represen-
tation, pre-trained word embedding models such
as word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013b,a) and glove
(Pennington et al., 2014) are also widely used
for natural language tasks (Karpathy and Fei-Fei,
2015; Kumar et al., 2016). Instead of these, we
initialize our models from a QA dataset and show
how standard transfer learning can achieve state-
of-the-art in target QA datasets.

There have been several QA paradigms in NLP,
which can be categorized by the context and su-
pervision used to answer questions. This context
can range from structured and confined knowl-
edge bases (Berant et al., 2013) to unstructured
and unbounded natural language form (e.g., doc-
uments on the web (Voorhees and Tice, 2000))
and unstructured, but restricted in size (e.g., a
paragraph or multiple sentences (Hermann et al.,
2015)). The recent advances in neural question an-
swering lead to numerous datasets and successful
models in these paradigms (Rajpurkar et al., 2016;
Yang et al., 2015; Nguyen et al., 2016; Trischler
et al., 2016). The answer types in these datasets
are largely divided into three categories: sentence-
level, in-context span, and generation. In this
paper, we specifically focus on the former two
and show that span-supervised models can better
learn syntactic and lexical features. Among these
datasets, we briefly describe three QA datasets to
be used for the experiments in this paper. We also
give the description of an RTE dataset for an ex-
ample of a non-QA task. Refer to Table 1 to see
the examples of the datasets.

SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) is a recent span-
based QA dataset, containing 100k/10k train/dev
examples. Each example is a pair of context para-

graph from Wikipedia and a question created by a
human, and the answer is a span in the context.

SQUAD-T is our modification of SQuAD
dataset to allow for sentence selection QA. (‘T’
for senTence). We split the context paragraph
into sentences and formulate the task as classi-
fying whether each sentence contains the answer.
This enables us to make a fair comparison between
pretraining with span-supervised and sentence-
supervised QA datasets.

WikiQA (Yang et al., 2015) is a sentence-level
QA dataset, containing 1.9k/0.3k train/dev an-
swerable examples. Each example consists of a
real user’s Bing query and a snippet of a Wikipedia
article retrieved by Bing, containing 18.6 sen-
tences on average. The task is to classify whether
each sentence provides the answer to the query.

SemEval 2016 (Task 3A) (Nakov et al., 2016)
is a sentence-level QA dataset, containing
1.8k/0.2k/0.3k train/dev/test examples. Each ex-
ample consists of a community question by a user
and 10 comments. The task is to classify whether
each comment is relevant to the question.

SICK (Marelli et al., 2014) is a dataset for
recognizing textual entailment (RTE), containing
4.5K/0.5K/5.0K train/dev/test examples. Each ex-
ample consists of a hypothesis and a premise, and
the goal is to determine if the premise is entailed
by, contradicts, or is neutral to the hypothesis
(hence classification problem). We also report re-
sults on SICK to show that span-supervised QA
dataset can be also useful for non-QA datasets.

3 Model

Among numerous models proposed for span-
level QA tasks (Xiong et al., 2017; Wang and
Jiang, 2017b), we adopt an open-sourced model,
BiDAF2 (Seo et al., 2017).

2https://allenai.github.io/bi-att-flow

511



BiDAF. The inputs to the model are a ques-
tion q, and a context paragraph x. Then the
model selects the best answer span, which is
argmax(i,j) y

start
i y

end
j , where i <= j. Here,

ystarti and y
end
i are start and end position proba-

bilities of i-th element, respectively.
Here, we briefly describe the answer mod-

ule which is important for transfer learning to
sentence-level QA. The input to the answer mod-
ule is a sequence of vectors {hi} each of which
encodes enough information about the i-th con-
text word and its relationship with its surrounding
words and the question words. Then the role of the
answer module is to map each vector hi to its start
and end position probabilities, ystarti and y

end
i .

BiDAF-T refers to the modified version of
BiDAF to make it compatible with sentence-level
QA. (‘T’ for senTence). In this task, the inputs are
a question q and a list of sentences, x1, . . . ,xT ,
where T is the number of the sentences. Note that,
unlike BiDAF, which outputs single answer per
example, Here we need to output a C-way clas-
sification for each k-th sentence.

Since BiDAF is a span-selection model, it can-
not be directly used for sentence-level classifica-
tion. Hence we replace the original answer mod-
ule of BiDAF with a different answer module,
and keep the other modules identical to those of
BiDAF. Given the input to the new answer mod-
ule, {hk1, . . . ,hkN}, where the superscript is the
sentence index (1 ≤ k ≤ T ), we obtain the
C–way classification scores for the k-th sentence,
ỹk ∈ [0, 1]C via max-pooling method:

ỹk = softmax(Wmax(hk1, . . . ,h
k
N ) + b) (1)

where W ∈ RC×d,b ∈ RC are trainable weight
matrix and bias, respectively, and max() function
is applied elementwise.

For WikiQA and SemEval 2016, the number of
classes (C) is 2, i.e. each sentence (or comment) is
either relevant or not relevant. Since some of the
metrics used for these datasets require full rank-
ing, we use the predicted probability for “relevant”
label to rank the sentences.

Note that BiDAF-T can be also used for the RTE
dataset, where we can consider the hypothesis as
a question and the premise as a context sentence
(T = 1), and classify each example into ‘entail-
ment’, ‘neutral’, or ‘contradiction’ (C = 3).

Transfer Learning. Transfer learning between
the same model architectures3 is straightforward:
we first initialize the weights of the target model
with the weights of the source model pretrained on
the source dataset, and then we further train (fine-
tune) on the target model with the target dataset.
To transfer from BiDAF (on SQuAD) to BiDAF-
T, we transfer all the weights of the identical
modules, and initialize the new answer module in
BiDAF-T with random values. For more training
details, refer to Appendix A.

iQA, they are from Wang and Jiang (2017a); Tymoshenko

2016, they are from Filice et al. (2016); Joty et al. (2016);
Mihaylov and Nakov (2016). SQuAD*&Yes sets the new
state of the art on both datasets.

Question Answering Results. Table 2 reports
the state-of-the-art results of our transfer learn-
ing on WikiQA and SemEval-2016 and the per-
formance of previous models as well as several
ablations that use no pretraining or no finetuning.
There are multiple interesting observations from
Table 2 as follows:
(a) If we only train the BiDAF-T model on the
target datasets with no pretraining (first row of Ta-
ble 2), the results are poor. This shows the impor-
tance of both pretraining and finetuning.
(b) Pretraining on SQuAD and SQuAD-T with
no finetuning (second and third row) achieves re-
sults close to the state-of-the-art in the WikiQA
dataset, but not in SemEval-2016. Interestingly,
our result on SemEval-2016 is not better than
only training without transfer learning. We con-
jecture that this is due to the significant differ-
ence between the domain of SemEval-2016 and

that of SQuAD, which are from community and
Wikipedia, respectively.

(c) Pretraining on SQuAD and SQuAD-T with
finetuning (fourth and fifth row) significantly out-
performs (by more than 5%) the highest-rank sys-
tems on WikiQA. It also outperforms the second
ranking system in SemEval-2016 and is only 1%
behind the first ranking system.

(d) Transfer learning models achieve better re-
sults with pretraining on span-level supervision
(SQuAD) than coarser sentence-level supervision
(SQuAD-T).4

Finally, we also use the ensemble of 12 differ-
ent training runs on the same BiDAF architecture,
which obtains the state of the art in both datasets.
This system outperforms the highest-ranking sys-
tem in WikiQA by more than 8% and the best sys-
tem in SemEval-2016 by 1% in every metric. It is
important to note that, while we definitely benefit
from the scale of SQuAD for transfer learning to
smaller WikiQA, given the gap between SQuAD-
T and SQuAD (> 3%), we see a clear sign that
span-supervision plays a significant role well.

Varying the size of pretraining dataset. We
vary the size of SQuAD dataset used during pre-
training, and test on WikiQA with finetuning. Re-
sults are shown in Table 3. As expected, MAP on
WikiQA drops as the size of SQuAD decreases. It
is worth noting that pretraining on SQuAD-T (Ta-
ble 2) yields 0.5 point lower MAP than pretraining
on 50% of SQuAD. In other words, roughly speak-
ing, span-level supervision data is worth more than
twice the size of sentence-level supervision data
for the purpose of pretraining. Also, even a small
size of fine-grained supervision data helps; pre-
training with 12.5% of SQuAD gives an advantage
of more than 7 points than no pretraining.

Analysis. Figure 1 shows the latently-learned at-
tention maps between the question and one of the
context sentences from a WikiQA example in Ta-
ble 1. The top map is pretrained on SQuAD-
T (corresponding to SQuAD-T&Yes in Table 2)
and the bottom map is pretrained on SQuAD
(SQuAD&Yes). The more red the color, the higher

4We additionally perform Mann-Whitney U Test and Mc-
Nemars Test to show the statistical significance of the advan-
tage of span-level pretraining over sentence-level pretraining.
For WikiQA, the advantage is statistically significant with the
confidence levels of 97.1% and 99.6%, respectively. For Se-
mEval, we obtain the confidence levels of 97.8% and 99.9%,
respectively.

the relevance between the words. There are two
interesting observations here.

First, in SQuAD-pretrained model (bottom),
we see a high correspondence between ques-
tion’s airbus and context’s aircraft and
aerospace, but the SQuAD-T-pretrained model
fails to learn such correspondence.

Second, we see that the attention map of the
SQuAD-pretrained model is more sparse, indicat-
ing that it is able to more precisely localize cor-
respondence between question and context words.
In fact, we compare the sparsity of WikiQA test
examples in SQuAD&Y and SQuAD-T&Y. Fol-
lowing Hurley and Rickard (2009), the sparsity of
an attention map is defined by

sparsity =
| {x ∈ V|x ≤ �} |

|V| (2)

where V is a set of values between 0 and 1 in at-
tention map, and � is a small value which we de-
fine 0.01 for here. A histogram of the sparsity is
shown in Figure 2. There is a large gap in the av-
erage sparsity of WikiQA test examples between
SQuAD&Yes and SQuAD-T&Yes, which are 0.84
and 0.56, respectively.

More analyses including error analysis and
more visualizations are shown in Appendix B.

Entailment Results. In addition to QA experi-
ments, we also show that the models trained on
span-supervised QA can be useful for textual en-
tailment task (RTE). Table 4 shows the trans-

fer learning results of BiDAF-T on SICK dataset
(Marelli et al., 2014), with various pretraining rou-
tines. Note that SNLI (Bowman et al., 2015) is
a similar task to SICK and is significantly larger
(150K/10K/10K train/dev/test examples). Here
we highlight three observations:
(a) BiDAF-T pretrained on SQuAD outperforms
that without any pretraining by 6% and that pre-
trained on SQuAD-T by 2%, which demonstrates
that the transfer learning from large span-based
QA gives a clear improvement.
(b) Pretraining on SQuAD+SNLI outperforms
pretraining on SNLI only. Given that SNLI is
larger than SQuAD, the difference in their perfor-
mance is a strong indicator that we are benefiting
from not only the scale of SQuAD, but also the
fine-grained supervision that it provides.
(c) We outperform the previous state of the art
by 2% with the ensemble of SQuAD+SNLI pre-
training routine.

It is worth noting that Mou et al. (2016) also
shows improvement on SICK by pretraining on
SNLI.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we show state-of-the-art results on
WikiQA and SemEval-2016 (Task 3A) as well as
an entailment task, SICK, outperforming previous
results by 8%, 1%, and 2%, respectively. We show
that question answering with sentence-level super-
vision can greatly benefit from standard transfer
learning of a question answering model trained on
a large, span-level supervision. We additionally
show that such transfer learning can be applicable
in other NLP tasks such as textual entailment.

A Training details
Parameters. For pretraining BiDAF on
SQuAD, we follow the exact same procedure in
Seo et al. (2017). For pretraining BiDAF-T on
SQuAD-T, we use the same hyperparameters for
all modules except the answer module, for which
we use the hidden state size of 200. The learning
rate is controlled by AdaDelta (Zeiler, 2012) with
the initial learning rate of 0.5 and minibatch size
of 50. We maintain the moving averages of all
weights of the model with the exponential decay
rate of 0.999 during training and use them at test.
The loss function is the cross entropy between ỹk

and the one-hot vector of the correct classification.

Convergence. For all settings, we train models
until performance on development set continue to
decrease for 5k steps. Table 5 shows the median
selected step on each setting.

mance on development set.

B More Analysis
Attention maps. We show some more examples
of attention maps in Figure 3. (Top) We see high
correspondence between same word from ques-
tion and context such as senator and john,
in SQuAD-pretrained model, but the SQuAD-T-
pretrained model fails to learn such correspon-
dence. (Bottom) We see high correspondence
between stems from question and stem from
context (left) as well as plant from question
and plants from context (right), in SQuAD-
pretrained model, but the SQuAD-T-pretrained
model fails to learn such correspondence.

Error Analysis. Table 7 shows the comparison
between answers by SQuAD-T-pretrained model
and SQuAD-pretrained model on the example

correspondence.

of WikiQA and SemEval-2016 from Table 1.
On WikiQA, SQuAD-T-pretrained model selects
C2 instead of the groundtruth answer C1. On
SemEval-2016, SQuAD-pretrained model ranks
C3 (bad comment) higher than C2 (good com-
ment).

In addition, we sampled 100 example randomly

from WikiQA and SemEval-2016, and classified
them into 6 categories(Table 6). In Table 8, we
compare the performance on these WikiQA exam-
ples by SQuAD-T-pretrained model and SQuAD-
pretrained model. It shows that span supervision
clearly helps answering questions on Category 1
and 2, which are easier to answer, with answering

correctly on most of the questions in Category 1.
Similarly, we show the comparison of the perfor-
mance on classified examples of the model with-
out pretraining and SQuAD-pretrained model on
SemEval-2016. It also shows that span supervi-
sion helps answering questions asking information
or opinion/recommendation.

C More Results
SQuAD-T. To better understand SQuAD-T
dataset, we show the performance BiDAF-T with
different training routines. We get MAP 89.46 and
accuracy 85.34% with SQuAD-trained BiDAF
model, and MAP 90.18 and accuracy 84.69% with
SQuAD-T-trained BiDAF-T model. There is no
large gap between the two models, as each para-
graph of SQuAD-T has 5 sentences on average,
which makes the classification problem easier than
WikiQA.

SNLI. Other larger RTE datasets such as SNLI
also benefit from transfer learning, although the
improvement is smaller. We confirm the improve-
ment by showing that the result on SNLI when
pretraining on SQuAD with BiDAF is 82.6%,
which is slightly higher than that of the model
pretrained on SQuAD-T (81.6%). This, however,
did not outperform the state of the art (88.8%) by
Wang et al. (2017). This is mostly because BiDAF
(or BiDAF-T) is a QA model, which is not de-
signed for RTE tasks.
