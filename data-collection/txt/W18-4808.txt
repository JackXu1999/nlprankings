Abstract

Machine translation from polysynthetic to fusional languages is a challenging task, which gets
further complicated by the limited amount of parallel text available. Thus, translation per-
formance is far from the state of the art for high-resource and more intensively studied lan-
guage pairs. To shed light on the phenomena which hamper automatic translation to and from
polysynthetic languages, we study translations from three low-resource, polysynthetic languages
(Nahuatl, Wixarika and Yorem Nokki) into Spanish and vice versa. Doing so, we find that in a
morpheme-to-morpheme alignment an important amount of information contained in polysyn-
thetic morphemes has no Spanish counterpart, and its translation is often omitted. We further
conduct a qualitative analysis and, thus, identify morpheme types that are commonly hard to
align or ignored in the translation process.

1 Introduction

Until a few years ago, research on machine translation (MT) between polysynthetic and fusional lan-
guages did not get much attention from the natural language processing (NLP) community. Furthermore,
with the rise of neural MT (NMT), the common assumption that machine learning approaches for MT
were language independent routed the efforts into the direction of general model improvements. But this
assumption does not hold completely true, and, recently, efforts have been made to adapt models to indi-
vidual languages, e.g., in order to improve poor results on morphologically-rich languages (Ataman and
Federico, 2018; Al-Mannai et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2016). Koehn (2005) mentioned this problem while
he analyzed the Europarl corpus, stating that “translating from an information-rich into an information-
poor language is easier than the other way around”. However, doing so, we unfortunately note a loss of
information. This idea that some languages encode more information in one phrase than others given
rise to many questions in linguistics and NLP, and motivated this paper. Polysynthetic languages are a
special type of information-rich languages, and come with their own set of challenges for translation.
Studying their particularities is an important prerequisite to enable successful translation to or from them
in the future.

Many polysynthetic languages—many of which endangered—are spoken in regions where Spanish,
English, or Portuguese are dominant. Thus, improving the translation quality of MT between fusional
and polysynthetic languages might play an important role for communities which speak a polysynthetic
language, e.g., by making documents in key fields such as legal, health and education accessible to
them. Although many members of these communities can obtain access to this information using another
dominant language which they also speak, this situation might have a negative effect on their native
languages due to them not playing a functional role in day-to-day interaction about these important
fields. As a result, these dominated languages might be perceived as less important. Well-performing

MT might offer the mechanism to invert this situation, by making important documents accessible to the
communities in their native languages, thus mitigating the need to consider one language more important,
since both allow access to the same sets of documents. Rule-based MT (RBMT) has been a common
approach to deal with low-resource MT. However, statistical MT (SMT) and NMT are essential for a
broad coverage, due to the vast diversity of polysynthetic languages.

In this paper, we introduce the following research questions: (i) Which information is commonly not
encoded in the target text when translating to a fusional language from a polysynthetic one? (ii) How can
this information loss be explained from a linguistic point of view? (iii) Are some morphemes particularly
hard to translate?

In an attempt to start answering the before mentioned questions, we present a quantitative study,
using morpheme-based SMT alignments (Brown et al., 1993) between the following language pairs:
Nahuatl-Spanish, Wixarika-Spanish, and Yorem Nokki-Spanish1. With the exception of Spanish, all
these languages are from the Yuto-Nahua linguistic family and have different levels of polysynthesis.
We search for commonly not aligned morphemes and analyze the results. Trying to find answers to our
research questions, we also present the qualitative aspects of this information loss.

2 About Polysynthetic Languages

Translating from a polysynthetic language to a fusional one faces difficulties; a significant number of
morphemes can get lost because polysynthetic languages have structures that are different from those
of fusional languages. A main difference between the fusional and the polysynthetic languages lays
at the syntax level of a sentence. Johanna Nichols refers to a binary system, “directed relations be-
tween a head and a dependent” (Nichols, 1986), between a head-marked and a dependent-marked rela-
tion. While the dependent-marked sentence is characterized by a relation of dependent pronoun-noun
and relative construction, the head-marked construction prefers governed arguments, possessed noun,
main-clause predicate and inner and outer adverbial constructions. For her “the head is the word which
governs, or is subcategorized for –or otherwise determines the possibility of occurrence of– the other
word. It determines the category of its phrase.” In contrast of the most Indo-European languages, “the
Mayan, Athabaskan, Wakashan, Salishan, Iroquoian, Siouan, and Algonkian families are consistently
head-marking” (Nichols, 1986), among others. So the polysynthetic languages prefer a head-marked
morphology, where the verb has a preference position; “the verb itself normally constitutes a complete
sentence; full NP’s are included only for emphasis, focus, disambiguation etc.” (Nichols, 1986).

In the same way, Baker distinguishes “head-marking” languages from “dependent-marking” ones
(Baker, 1996). The first type of languages, in the most cases, has a “head-final structure (SOV)” or
a free word order, while the second type exhibits a head-initial structure (SVO or VSO) (Baker, 1996).
We must note that not all polysynthetic languages have the head-final structure, for example in Nahuatl
we also find an SVO structure as we will see in §6. Jeff MacSwan pointed out that in Southeast Puebla
Nahuatl we can find different structures, depending the meaning of each sentence: the SVO-structure is
the most natural, the VSO-structure is employed for focus and contrast only and the SOV-structure for
light emphasis, but is “also possible for focus or contrast” (MacSwan, 1998). In contrast, in Wixarika
the SOV-structure dominates, which makes it less flexible that Nahuatl. The same phenomenon can also
be observed in fusional languages. While English prefers an SVO-structure, in German different or-
ders are possible: we can find the SOV-structure only in subordinate sentences, while in main sentences
we can have either an SVO-structure, or an OVS-structure for emphasis. In contrast, in Nahuatl the
OVS-structure is unacceptable (MacSwan, 1998).

Baker states “that in a polysynthetic language like Mohawk, all verbs necessarily agree with subjects,
objects, and indirect objects, except for the special case when the direct object is incorporated into the
verb” (Baker, 1996). So “every argument of a head element must be related to a morpheme in the word
containing that head (an agreement morpheme, or an incorporated root)” (Baker, 1996), often expressed

1The language we call Wixarika is also known as Huichol, and Yorem Nokki is also known as Mayo or Yaqui. Similarly,
the Yuto-Nahua linguistic family also goes by the name of Uto-Aztec. We use these names out of respect to the communities
that have chosen these names within the language.

by asserts. José Luis Iturrioz and Paula Gómez López observe a semantic relation between the predicate
and the arguments. For this reason, the enunciative functions as a perspective or situation, individua-
tion, or identification (attribution, reference), discursive cohesion, culminating in the integration of one
clause in another (Iturrioz Leza and López Gómez, 2006). This phenomenon cannot be observed in
fusional languages; thus, morphemes with specific incorporation functions do not exist in fusional lan-
guages. Therefore translation of such kind of morphemes can be challenging in the machine translation
process. Moreover, it can be difficult for these morphemes to be inferred when the target language is a
polysynthetic one.

Incorporation is a common phenomenon in polysynthetic languages. Wilhelm von Humboldt first
described it. For him, incorporation has a syntactical, but not a morphological function (Iturrioz Leza
and López Gómez, 2006). In contrast, Marianne Mithun referred to noun incorporation (NI) (Mithun,
1986) in the context of verb morphology. For her “New topics may be introduced in other ways, however
IN’s do, on occasion, serve to introduce new topics – simply because they are parts of complex verbs
denoting conceptually unitary activities” (Mithun, 1986). Also, the NI is not simply a combination of a
noun with a verb stem “to yield a more specific, derived verb stem” (Mithun, 1986). According to Baker’s
theory of incorporation, in polysynthetic languages there exists an interrelation of morphemes, in the way
“that one part of a derived stem is the syntactic complement of the other part. In both cases, syntactic
argument relationships are being expressed morphologically” (Baker, 1996). Then, we have agreement
morphemes, expressing the argument of the verb, e.g., pronominal affixes and incorporated roots (Baker,
1996). “The word-internal structure in these languages is very configurational indeed (...) the order of
basic morphemes is also quite consistent (...) Furthermore, (...) this morpheme order provides a clue to
the basic syntactic structure of these languages” (Baker, 1996).

One important property of polysynthetic languages is the high number of morphemes which often
occur in the verb structure. According to Paula Gómez, in the Wixarika language there are three posi-
tions before the verb stem for approximately twelve prefixes, which correspond to different senses; for
example, expression of localization, individuation, participation, aspects and modes of action, among
others (Gómez, 1999). Like Nichols, his phenomenon of three-place verbs we observe also in the Bantu
and Mayan languages (Nichols, 1986). Hence, a considerable number of words, encoding a signifi-
cant amount of information, may be produced when combining these items. In polysynthetic languages,
there is a higher fragmentation of words and an interrelation of the morphemes, making their translation
more difficult. Nichols mentions that “in a number of North American families (Uto-Aztecan, Yuman,
Pomoan, Siouan, Algonkian, Cadoan), instrumental, locative, and directional affixes on verbs are gram-
maticalized” (Nichols, 1986). Besides, the morphology of the Wixarika verbs presents complications
due to the great number of positions of affixes, which can reach to 20 morphemes or more, forming a
morphological chain (Gómez, 1999). Also, in Wixarika, the spatial or local relationships are expressed
by adverbs, postpositions, nominal suffixes, and verbal prefixes (Gómez, 1999). For this reason, in many
cases, we do not have a correlation of structures in a pair consisting of a polysynthetic and a fusional
language, which can make translating difficult. In languages like Spanish, this information is commonly
inferred or not encoded in the translation between languages of these two typologies. For instance,
consider the Wixarika morpheme “u” that indicates that an action happens in the visual sphere of the
speaker. This information is usually not directly translated to Spanish. However, as a result, a problem
arises when trying to translate such a phrase back to Wixarika, because the information if the action is
held in the visual field of the speaker or not is not available.

3 Previous Work

Nowadays, the area of NLP is largely dominated by data-driven—often neural—approaches which, as
far as the machine learning model is concerned, strive to be language-independent. However, the perfor-
mance of such systems does still vary in dependence of the typology of each language. In order to shed
light on this phenomenon and its causes, Cotterell et al. (2018) studied how the difficulty of language
modeling (LM) depends on the language. They found inflectional morphology to be a key factor: even
character-based long short-term memory (LSTM) models performed worse for morphologically rich lan-



76

guages. In this paper, we will study the causes of possible performance loss for polysynthetic languages
in MT.

MT has made a big step forward with the development of SMT and, later on, NMT. Those approaches
make it possible to construct reasonably well performing MT systems using parallel corpora that can be
gathered from a wide range of sources, and do not need handwritten rules generated by experts. This is
crucial, due to the large number of polysynthetic languages. However, most systems fail to achieve good
performances for polysynthetic languages, particularly in a low-resource context; with often better results
for SMT than for NMT (Mager and Meza, 2018). In recent years, character-based NMT systems were
claimed to handle sub-word phenomena (Sennrich et al., 2016), and others target specifically morpho-
logical rich languages (Passban et al., 2018; Peyman et al., 2018), but with the condition of feeding the
neural network with vast amounts of data. Character-based NMT systems can learn some morphological
aspects (Belinkov et al., 2017) even for morphologically rich languages like Arabic. Vania and Lopez
(2017) analyzed this proposal, concluding that, although character-based models improve translation,
best results are achieved with accurate morphological segmentation.

The problem exposed in this paper has mainly been studied in the context of SMT approaches. This
line of research has pursued both the goal of improving translation from morphologically-rich languages
into morphologically-poorer ones like English (Habash and Sadat, 2006), and the other way around
(Avramidis and Koehn, 2008; Oflazer, 2008). One important development was the inclusion of linguistic
markups into factored translation models (Koehn and Hoang, 2007; Oflazer, 2008; Fraser, 2009). Vir-
pioja et al. (2007) proposed a combined usage of Morfessor (Creutz and Lagus, 2005), an unsupervised
segmentation model, and phrase-based SMT systems, in order to make use of segmented input. The
translation improvement through initial morphological segmentation was also found for translation of
the polysynthetic Wixarika into Spanish (Mager Hois et al., 2016). In each case the main goal of previ-
ous work was to increase the BLEU score. However, in this paper we aim to improve our understanding
of the information which is lost in the translation process; and particularly for polysynthetic languages.
For this, we make use of morphological segmentation.

4 Morpheme Alignment Between a Polysynthetic and a Fusional Language

Morphemes are the smallest meaning-bearing units of words. Here, we want to know why some of them
are not aligned correctly by common SMT systems. We use the surface form of morphemes obtained
from manually segmented words in each language and apply the IBM models 2, 3 and 4 (Brown et al.,
1993) to get alignment cepts for each morpheme. Each cept contains a (possibly empty) set of positions
with which a token is aligned. Also a special cept is defined, that is aligned to morphemes that could not
be aligned to any other cept, and is referred to with number 0. A set of alignments is denoted by A(e, f),
where f is a phrase of size m in a source language and e is a phrase of size l in a target language.

For our experiments, we use the resulting alignment function obtained from the training process which
consists of maximizing the translation likelihood of the training set. The probability of a translation f in
the target language, given a source sentence e, is then calculated as:

Pr(f |e) =
∑
a

Pr(f, a|e) (1)

The alignments a ∈ A are trained jointly with the whole translation model, as defined by Brown et al.
(1993). The underlined conditional probability a in Equation 2 is what we use for our work.

Pr(f, a|e) = P (m|e)

After computing the alignments for each sentence pair in our dataset, we count all morphemes which
are not aligned, in order to find information that is not expressed in the target language. As SMT is a
probabilistic method the resulting alienations are not exact and should be taken as an approximation.
Adding this fact, also the amount of data used to train the system influences the resulting inference.

5 Experiments

In order to get the alignments of morphemes in Nahuatl, Wixarika and Yorem Nokki with their Spanish
counterparts, we train a word-based SMT system using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) on parallel datasets
in the respective languages, which we will describe below. We parsed the resulting alignment files to ex-
tract non-aligned morphemes in each translation direction. As we are working with three language pairs
and are interested in both translation directions, we trained six models (Spanish-Wixarika, Wixarika-
Spanish, Spanish-Nahuatl, Nahuatl-Spanish, Spanish-Yorem Nokki and Yorem Nokki-Spanish).

5.1 Languages

Nahuatl is a language of the Yuto-Nahua language family and the most spoken native language in
Mexico. The variants of this language are diverse, and in some cases can be considered linguistic sub-
groups. Its almost 1, 700 thousand native speakers mainly live in Puebla, Guerrero, Hidalgo, Veracruz,
and San Luis Potosi, but also in Oaxaca, Durango, Modelos, Mexico City, Tlaxcala, Michoacan, Nayarit
and the State of Mexico. In this work we use the Northern Puebla variant.

Like all languages of the Yuto-Nahua family, Nahuatl is agglutinative, and a word can consist of a
combination of many different morphemes. In contrast to other languages, Nahuatl has a preference for
SVO, but SOV and VSO are also used. An example phrase is:

ka-te ome no-kni-wan
is-pl. two pos.1sg:s.-brother-pl.

I have two brothers

This Nahuatl variant has five vowels ({i, u, e, o, a}) and does not distinguish if they are short or large.
The alphabet of Nahuatl consists of 17 symbols: ΣNahuatl = {a,e,h,i,k,m,n,o,p,r,s,t,u,w,x,y,’}.

Wixarika is a language spoken by approximately fifty thousand people in the Mexican states of Jalisco,
Nayarit, Durango and Zacatecas. It belongs to the Coracholan group of languages within the Yuto-Nahua
family. Its alphabet consists of 17 symbols (ΣWixarika={‘,a,e,h,i,+,k,m,n,p,r,t,s,u,w,x,y}), out of which
five are vowels {a,e,i,u,+}2 with long and short variants. An example for a phrase in the language is:

yu-huta-me ne-p+-we-’iwa
an-two-ns 1sg:s-asi-2pl:o-brother

I have two brothers

This language has a strong SOV syntax, with heavy agglutination on the verb. Wixarika is consid-
ered morphologically more complex than other languages from the same family (Iturrioz Leza and
López Gómez, 2006).

Yorem Nokki is part of the Taracachita subgroup of the Yuto-Nuahuan language family. Its Southern
dialect (commonly known as Mayo) is spoken by close to fifty thousand people in the Mexican states
of Sinaloa and Durango, while its Northern dialect (also known as Yaqui) has about forty thousand
speakers in the Mexican state of Sonora. In this work, we consider the Mayo dialect. As in the other
studied languages, the nominal morphology of Yorem Nokki is rather simple, but, again, the verb is
highly complex. Yorem Nokki uses mostly SOV.

The symbols used in our dataset are ΣY oremNokki= {á,k,s,g,ó,j,y,w,β,p,m,e,n,d,r,é,t,u,c,o,h,f,b,’,i,l,a},
with 8 being vowels: {a,e,i,o,u,á,é,ó}. An example phrase is:

woori saila-m-ne hipu-re
two brother-pl.-me have-r

I have two brothers

2While linguists often use a dashed i (i) to denote the last vowel, in practice almost all native speakers use a plus symbol
(+). In this work, we chose to use the latter.



78

5.2 Dataset

To create our datasets, we use phrases in the indigenous languages paired with their Spanish equivalents.
Namely, our translations are taken from books of the collection Archive of Indigenous Languages for
Nahuatl (Lastra de Suárez, 1980), Wixarika (Gómez, 1999), and Yorem Nokki (Freeze, 1989). A total
of 594 phrases is available for each language. To obtain these phrases, a questionnaire of 594 utter-
ances made by Ray Freeze was used (Freeze, 1989, p. 15). In essence, each author elicited equivalent
expressions from speakers of the target language. Also, the uniformity of the questionnaire may have
been modified because of cultural or environmental circumstances. In cases where the expression could
not be elicited, a sentence was offered as similar as possible, grammatically and semantically, to the
original utterance. In this manner, the sets of expressions are equivalent for all languages, so we can
directly compare results. The words of the polysynthetic languages have already been segmented by
linguists in the cited books. In order to achieve a morpheme-to-morpheme translation (instead of a word-
to-morpheme one) we segment the Spanish phrases with Morfessor (Virpioja et al., 2013) and manually
correct segmentation errors.

5.3 Results and Discussion

Table 1 shows the top fifteen non-aligned morphemes resulting from translating Nahuatl, Wixarika, and
Yorem Nokki into Spanish. Naturally, it would be interesting to discuss the syntax of all morphemes in
detail. In this way it could be established, for example, what kinds of markers are more characteristic of
which kind of language. However, this is out-of-scope for this work, such that we will limit ourselves to
the following remarks.

For Wixarika we can see that the eight morphemes which are most challenging for translation are
sub-word units. The important Wixarika independent asserters “p+” and “p” are the most frequent mor-
phemes in this language. However, as they have no direct equivalent in Spanish, their translation is
mostly ignored. The same is true for the object agreement morphemes “a” and “ne”. This is particularly
problematic for the translation in the other direction, i.e., from Spanish into Wixarika, as a translator has
no information about how the target language should realize such constructions. Human translators can,
in some cases, infer the missing information. However, without context it is generally complicated to
get the right translation. Also, other morphemes like “u”, “e”, and “r” encode precise information about
forms and movement that are not usually expressed in Spanish. Some of the other morphemes for which
the alignment fails, like “ne” and “ti”, could have been translated as a first person possessive, or as a
question mark, respectively. The reason for those errors might be our low-resource setting.

The Yorem Nokki suffixes “k” and “ka” are realization morphemes. As this construction is not com-
monly expressed in a fusional or isolating language, it will frequently not be aligned with any Spanish
token. Another difficulty is the translation of a concatenative word construction into a fusional one.
Yorem Nokki does not use as many agreement morphemes as Wixarika or Nahuatl, but the “si” noun
agreement morpheme still is one of the hardest to align. The morpheme “ta” represents the accusative
verbal case that can be expressed in Spanish, but still appears as one of the most difficult morphemes to
align. This can be a consequence of the low-resource setting we have.

The last language pair (Nahuatl-Spanish) has less non-aligned morphemes than the previews ones.
Nahuatl is also the only language for which the most frequently unaligned token is a word: the token
“in” is an article. However, its translation is not trivial. As most Yuto-Nahua languages, Nahuatl does
not mark grammatical gender (Mager Hois, 2017). The lack of gender information can hurt SMT per-
formance. In practice, for such cases post-processing can be used to correct some of the system errors
(Stymne, 2011). However, as in the previous cases, the object (“k” and “ki”) a noun agreement mor-
phemes (“ni” and “ti”) are the most frequently unaligned morphemes.

Table 2 shows the amount of non-aligned tokens, words, and morphemes for each language pair and
each translation direction. Our first observation is that the rate of non-aligned tokens for the direction
Spanish-polysynthetic language is far lower than the other way around. The highest rates of non-aligned
tokens are found for Wixarika and Yorem Nokki with 0.617 and 0.616, respectively. For Nahuatl and
Spanish, this rate is with 0.448 notably lower. On the other hand, the translation direction from Spanish

to our polysynthetic languages seems to work much better and shows less variability. The lowest rate
is obtained for Yorem Nokki with 0.264, followed by Nahuatl with 0.277, and Wixarika with 0.35. For
both directions, translation with Wixarika got the highest non-alignment rates. This suggests that the
phenomenon might be related to the number of morphemes per word: Kann et al. (2018) showed that
Wixarika has the highest morphemes-per-word rate among the languages considered here.

To sum up, some fine-grained information from verbs in our polysynthetic languages are not usually

translated to Spanish, since this information is not commonly expressed in this target languages. It is
particularly true for structure morphemes and agreement morphemes, as well as enunciation functions
(situations, individuation, attribution, reference, and discursive cohesion).

The severity of the alignment problem seems to correlate with the BLEU metric for translation of these
language pairs (Mager and Meza, 2018): translation from polysynthetic languages to fusional ones has
been reported to work notably better than the opposite direction. We expect the alignment issue to be
fundamental for explaining this dynamic.

6 Information Loss in Translation Between Polysynthetic and Fusional Languages

As discussed in §5, an important amount of morphemes from a polysynthetic language usually will often
not be aligned to morphemes of an fusional language. However, how can we explain such a loss of
information? In this section, we will conduct a qualitative analysis to obtain a better understanding of
this phenomenon.

Namely, we will analyze the phrase “She always asks us for tortillas.” in our three polysynthetic
languages. The first example, taken from Gómez (1999), will be in Wixarika:

m+k+ pa:pa ya p+-ta-ti-u-ti-wawi-ri-wa
Ella tortilla enf asi-1pl:o-its-vis-pl:a-pedir-apl-hab

Free Spanish translation: Ella siempre nos pide tortillas
Free English translation: She always asks us for tortillas

Abbreviations:
enf empathic
asi independent asserter

pl:o plural of the indirect object
its intensifier
vis visible: in the ambit of the speaker

pl:a plurality of the action
appl applicative
hab habitual

Wixarika employs a head-final structure (SOV) as can be seen in the example. Therefore, we have in
the third place the emphatic factor “ya” which realizes the agreement of the initial subject and the direct
object; also we need an asserter for the indirect object “ta”, what in this case is the morpheme “p+”,
which we cannot translate. In fact, “p+” was the most unaligned morpheme in table 1. The verb exists
of different prefixes collocated before the verb stem “wawi”: the morpheme “ti” is an intensifier of the
visibility of the ambit of the speaker, expressed with the morpheme “u”; the prefix “ti” on the first place
of the verb refers to the plurality of the action and the plural of the direct object. Therefore, we can speak
of an incorporation of the object into the verb. All these prefixes cannot be directly translated.

Next, we analyze our example phrase in the Nahuatl Acaxochitlan dialect, spoken in Hidalgo (Las-
tra de Suárez, 1980), and its translation into Spanish:

ye’wa tech-tla-tlanilia semian in-tlaxkal-i
ella 1pl.obj-indef-pide siempre art-tortilla-abs



81

Free Spanish translation: Ella siempre nos pide tortillas
Free English translation: She always asks us for tortillas

Abbreviations:
abs absolutive
art article

indef indefinite
obj object
pl plural

In the Nahuatl language we also see a loss of information, but less than in Wixarika. Here, we notice a
different syntactic structure: the direct object is located at the end of the phrase and the indirect object is
located in the second place. Thus, we have an SOVO structure. What is not translated is the prefix “ya”
of the verb “yanilia” (ask for) because the undefined situation of an action is unknown in the fusional
languages, as well as the absolutive suffix “i” of the object “tlaxkal” (tortillas)

Finally, we consider the same example for Yorem Nokki, taken from the Mayo dialect of Yorem Nokki
(Southern branch), which is spoken in the Mexican state of Sinaloa (Freeze, 1989):

hiβa a:po tahkari-m ito-wi a’a:wa
siempre ella ortilla-pl nosotros-a hab-pide

Free Spanish translation: Ella siempre nos pide tortillas
Free English translation: She always asks us for tortillas

Abbreviations:
hab habitual

pl plural

In the Yorem Nokki language, we have a head final structure (SOV) like in Wixarika. However this
phrase has only one morpheme that cannot be directly translated to Spanish, e.g., the prefix “a” that
expresses an habitual action.

7 Conclusion and Future Work

We presented a quantitative and a qualitative study of the information loss that occurs during MT from
three polysynthetic languages of the Yuto-Nahua family into Spanish, a fusional language, and vice
versa. Based on GIZA++ alignments between Spanish morphemes and the corresponding morphemes
in our polysynthetic languages, we got insight into which morphemes are commonly not translated. We
found that, in contrast to the morphemes in the polysynthetic languages, most Spanish tokens get aligned
by the aligner.

We further noticed that often fine-grained information which is encoded into polysynthetic verbs is
not translated, since this information is not commonly expressed in our fusional language. The same
holds true for polysynthetic structure morphemes and agreement morphemes. Other morphemes which
are hard to translate are the enunciation functions, like perspectives or situations, individuation, attri-
bution, reference, and discursive cohesion. In Wixarika, the hardest morphemes to translate are the
assignors “p+”, “p” and “m+”, the object agreement morphemes “a” and “ne”, and the action perspec-
tive morphemes “u” and “e”; for Yorem Nokki the realization morphemes “ka” and “k” and the “si”
noun agreement morpheme; for Nahuatl the object agreement morphemes like “k” and “ki” and the noun
agreement morphemes “ni” and “ti”. By revision of non-aligned morphemes we could also see that our
three analyzed polysynthetic languages have entirely different structures, but in all cases, the agreement
morphemes represented were hard to align with Spanish morphemes.

In future work, we aim to increase the amount of data to train our MT models. For instance, with the
usage of automatic morphological segmentation systems like the one presented by Kann et al. (2018),
we could use larger amounts of parallel data for training and, thus, reduce alignment errors in our exper-
iments. Such an error reduction for alignments could help us to identify in a cleaner way the underlying
phenomena that hurt MT for the languages considered here.
