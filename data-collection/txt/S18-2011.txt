Abstract

In this paper we analyze the use of emojis in
social media with respect to gender and skin
tone. By gathering a dataset of over twenty
two million tweets from United States some
findings are clearly highlighted after perform-
ing a simple frequency-based analysis. More-
over, we carry out a semantic analysis on the
usage of emojis and their modifiers (e.g. gen-
der and skin tone) by embedding all words,
emojis and modifiers into the same vector
space. Our analyses reveal that some stereo-
types related to the skin color and gender seem
to be reflected on the use of these modifiers.
For example, emojis representing hand ges-
tures are more widely utilized with lighter skin
tones, and the usage across skin tones differs
significantly. At the same time, the vector cor-
responding to the male modifier tends to be
semantically close to emojis related to busi-
ness or technology, whereas their female coun-
terparts appear closer to emojis about love or
makeup.

1 Introduction

Gender and race stereotypes are still present in
many places of our lives. These stereotype-based
biases are directly reflected on the data that can
be gathered from different sources such as vi-
sual or textual contents. In fact, it has been
shown how these biases can lead to problematic
behaviours such as an increase in discrimination
(Podesta et al., 2014). These biases have already
been studied in diverse text data sources (Zhao
et al., 2017), and have been proved to propagate to
supervised and unsupervised techniques learning
from them, including word embeddings (Boluk-
basi et al., 2016; Caliskan et al., 2017; Zhao et al.,
2018) and end-user applications like online ads
(Sweeney, 2013).

In this paper we study the biases produced in
a newer form of communication in social media

from an analytical point of view. We focus on the
use of emojis and their interaction with the textual
content within a social network (i.e. Twitter). We
study emojis as another part of the message, as it
could be words. An interesting feature about emo-
jis, apart from their increasing use in diverse social
media platforms, is that they enable us to numeri-
cally measure some biases with respect to gender
and race. Recently, emojis have introduced mod-
ifiers as part of their encoding. With these mod-
ifiers the same emoji can be used with different
features: as male or female, or with different skin
colors, for example.

We approach the problem from two method-
ological perspectives. First, we analyze the use of
emojis and their modifiers from a numerical point
of view, counting their occurrences in a corpus.
This already gives us important hints of how these
emojis are used. Then, we leverage the SW2V
(Senses and Words to Vectors) embedding model
(Mancini et al., 2017) to train a joint vector space
in which emojis and their modifiers are encoded
together, enabling us to analyze their semantic in-
terpretation. While there have been approaches at-
tempting to model emojis with distributional se-
mantics (Aoki and Uchida, 2011; Barbieri et al.,
2016; Eisner et al., 2016; Ljubešic and Fišer, 2016;
Wijeratne et al., 2017), to the best of our knowl-
edge this is the first work that semantically ana-
lyzes modifiers as well. In fact, even though the in-
formation provided by modifiers can be extremely
useful (for the modeling of emojis in particular,
and of messages in social media in general), this
has been neglected by previous approaches mod-
eling and predicting emojis (Barbieri et al., 2017;
Felbo et al., 2017).

Following our two complementary methodolog-
ical perspectives, we reached similar conclusions:
many stereotypes related to gender and race are
also present in this new form of communication.

(dark skin color in the first and medium-dark in
the second).

Moreover, we encountered other interesting find-
ings related to the usage of emojis with respect to
gender and skin tones. For instance, our analy-
sis revealed that light skin tones are more widely
used than dark ones and their usage is different in
many cases. However, incidentally the dark raised
fist emoji (i.e. ) is significantly more used, pro-
portionally, than its lighter counterparts. This is
mainly due to the protest black community started
in favour of human rights, dating back from the
Olympic Games of Mexico 1968. This sign was
known as the Black Power salute (Osmond, 2010)
and is still widely used nowadays, especially in
social media symbolized by the above-mentioned
dark-tone fist emoji. Figure 1 shows two recent
tweets using this emoji as a response to some Don-
ald Trump critics to NFL players protesting for
black civil rights by kneeing during the national
anthem before their games. As far as gender-based
features are concerned, female modifiers appear
much closer to emojis related to love and makeup,
while the male ones are closer to business or tech-
nology items.

2 Methodology

For this paper we make use of the encoding of
emoji modifiers (Section 2.1) and exploit an em-
bedding model that enables us to learn all words,
emojis and modifiers in the same vector space
(Section 2.2).

2.1 Emoji Modifiers
Emoji modifiers are features that provide more
precise information of a given emoji. For exam-

ple, a hand-based emoji (e.g. ) can have dif-
ferent skin colors: light, medium-light, medium,
medium-dark, or dark. This information has been
recently added in the official encoding of emojis1.
At the same time, some emojis like a person rising
a hand could be displayed as a woman (i.e. ) or
a man (i.e. ). We exploit this information pro-
vided by modifiers to study the role of gender and
skin color in social media communication.

2.2 Joint Vector Space Model
We construct a vector space model in which
words, emojis and their modifiers share the same
space. To this end, we exploit SW2V2 (Mancini
et al., 2017), which is an extension of Word2Vec
(Mikolov et al., 2013) and was originally designed
for learning word and sense embeddings on the
same vector space. Given an input corpus, SW2V
trains words and its associated senses simultane-
ously, exploiting their intrinsic connections. In
our work, however, we are not interested in learn-
ing embeddings for senses but for emojis and their
modifiers.

Formally, we use the SW2V model by extend-
ing the input and output layers of the neural net-
work with emoji modifiers. The main objective
function of the CBOW architecture of Word2Vec
aiming at predicting the target word in the mid-
dle does not change, except when the model has to
predict an emoji with its modifier(s). In this case,
instead of simply trying to classify the word in the
middle, we also take into account the set of associ-
ated emojis. This is equivalent to minimizing the
following loss function:

− log(p(et|Et,M t))−
∑

m∈Mt
log(p(m|Et,M t))

where Mt refers to the set of modifier(s) of the tar-
get emoji et. Et = wt−n, ..., wt−1, wt+1, ..., wt+n
and M t = Mt−n, ...,Mt−1,Mt+1, ...,Mt+n both
represent the context of the target emoji. While
Et includes surface words (wi) as context, M t in-
cludes the modifiers of the emojis (Mi) within the
surrounding context, if any3.

The resulting output is a shared space of word,
emoji and modifier embeddings. In addition, we

context of the target emoji.

propose a second variant4 of the SW2V archi-
tecture modeling words, non-modified emojis and
emojis associated with their modifiers (e.g. ).
For example, for the emoji black hand ( ) this
variant would learn the embedding for the hand
without any modifier, and the same emoji with the
modifier dark (i.e. ) instead of the embedding
for the modifier alone learned in the main config-
uration of our SW2V model.

The advantages of using this model with respect
to a usual word embedding model are manifold:
first, it enables us to separate modifiers from emo-
jis so we can learn accurate representations for
both types; second, with this model we can learn
embeddings for words, emojis and their modifiers
in the same vector space, a property that is ex-
ploited in our experiments; third, since an emoji
with modifiers may occur quite infrequently, by
using this approach we take into account the se-
mantic of the emoji (e.g. ) so the representation
of the emoji with their modifiers (e.g. , ...) is
more accurate; finally, with this model we can as-
sociate a given emoji with one or more modifiers
(e.g. skin color and gender on the same emoji).

3 Experiments

All our experiments are carried out on a corpus
compiled from Twitter, including all tweets geolo-
calized in United States from October 2015 to Jan-
uary 2018. The corpus contains over 22M tweets
and around 319M tokens overall. In the corpus we
encode emojis and their modifiers as single joint
instances. Taking this corpus as reference, we in-
spect the use of emojis with respect to skin tone
and gender from two complementary methodolog-
ical perspectives: frequency-based (Section 3.1)
and semantics-based (Section 3.2).

3.1 Frequency

By exploring the frequency of emojis in Twitter
we can obtain a clear overview of their diverse
use regarding skin tone. To this end, we carried
out a frequency analysis on hand-related emojis
with different skin color modifiers: light, medium-
light, medium, medium-dark, dark, and neutral
(i.e. no modifier). Table 1 shows the frequency
of the top twenty most frequent hand-related emo-
jis according to skin tone. As can be clearly seen,
the emojis without any particular skin tone mod-

experiment in Section 3.2.2.

ifier (yellow), which are displayed by default, are
the most frequent. However, it is surprising to note
the gap between the usage of the light-tone emo-
jis (over 70K occurrences with over almost 17%
overall) with respect to dark-tone emojis (less than
8K occurrences which corresponds to less than 2%
overall). Nevertheless, this gap may be simply due
to demographics, since many Twitter users employ
modifiers as a form of self-representation (Robert-
son et al., 2018).

In addition to the raw frequencies of these emo-
jis and their modifiers we analyze how these emo-
jis were used proportionally for each skin tone. Ta-
ble 2 displays the proportion of emojis used per
skin color. Interestingly, the pattern followed by
the darker emojis is clearly different from the dis-
tribution followed by lighter ones (Pearson cor-
relation of 98% between light and medium-light
tones in comparison to the relatively low 71% be-
tween light and dark tones). For example, the
emoji corresponding to the raised fist (i.e. ) is
significantly more used for the dark tone than the
light ones (10.3% to 1.6%). The reason, as ex-
plained in the introduction, dates back from the
Olympic Games of 1968 (Osmond, 2010). It rep-
resents the fight of the black community for hu-
man rights, which is still present nowadays, as
highlighted in the recent tweets of Figure 1. Ad-
ditionally, the hand emoji representing the middle
finger raised (i.e. ), which is often used as an in-
sult, occurs proportionally significantly more of-
ten with the dark skin color (2.2% to 0.5%). In
contrast, light skin tone emojis tend to be more
used for emojis including some form of assertion:
e.g. (12% vs 6.7%), and the (7.8% vs 3.7%).

3.2 Semantics

For inspecting the semantics of each emoji and
its modifiers we rely on the joint semantic vec-
tor space (SW2V) of words, emojis and modifiers
described in Section 2.2. We ran SW2V in our
Twitter corpus with the following hyperparame-

ters: 100 dimensions and window size of 6 tokens.
We performed two kinds of experiment: one rely-
ing on the nearest neighbours in the vector space
to understand the main semantics of skin tone and
gender modifiers (Section 3.2.1) and another ex-
periment in which we analyze the main semantic
divergences between opposing modifiers (Section
3.2.2), i.e. dark vs. light (skin tone) and male vs.
female (gender).

3.2.1 Nearest Neighbours

For this experiment we analyze the nearest neigh-
bours of skin tone and gender modifiers in the
SW2V vector space using cosine similarity as
comparison measure. Table 3 shows the fifteen
nearest neighbours for the five skin tone and two
gender modifiers. For the skin tone modifiers it is
noteworthy the fact that while lighter tones contain
love-related emojis as nearest neighbours, these do
not appear on the list of darker tones. Instead, we
can see some money-related (e.g. , or )
and electric-related emojis (e.g. a battery or a
plug ) as nearest neighbours of dark tone emo-
jis. These two electric emojis are often used in
the context of music, sport or motivational tweets

Table 3: Fifteen emoji nearest neighbours of the
seven modifiers in our analysis.

along with hashtags like #energy or #chargedup
(e.g. The GRIND begins!!! Refuse to settle for
average!! #chargedup). As a possibly
more worrying trend we found many versions of
the (often derogatory) word nigger and gang as
nearest neighbours of dark tone modifiers. A more
focused analysis on this issue would be required
in order to understand the possible racist implica-
tions.

As far as gender modifiers are concerned,
business-related emojis (e.g. a briefcase , a suit

or a handshake ) are among the closest emo-
jis to the man modifier in the SW2V vector space,
while nail polishing (i.e. ) or the selfie emoji (i.e.

), for example, are among the nearest neighbours
of the female modifier.

3.2.2 Semantic Divergences

In addition to the nearest neighbours experiments,
we analyze the highest semantic similarity gap be-
tween skin tone and gender modifiers. In Table 4
we display in each row the emojis with the highest
similarity gap with respect to the opposite mod-
ifier (light vs. dark and male vs. female), be-
ing more similar to the corresponding modifier
row. In this case we can see a similar pattern as
in the nearest neighbours experiment. A money-
related emoji appears again semantically close to
the dark-skin modifier ( ) but far from the light
skin modifier, and love-related emojis closer to the
light skin modifier (e.g. , and ). Likewise,

104



Table 4: Emojis with highest similarity gap be-
tween opposite modifiers (light vs dark, male vs
female).

we can see how technology-related emojis (e.g. a
CD , a video camera or a television ) are
close to the man modifier and far from the female
one. In contrast, makeup-related emojis like nail
polishing (i.e. ) or the lipstick emoji (i.e. ) are
clearly female-based.

In order to complement this experiment, we
also inspect the emojis whose similarity was lower
when changing the modifier.5 We compare the
similarity between all emojis which can have a
skin color or gender modifier. Table 5 shows the
fifteen emojis whose semantic similarity, as mea-
sured by cosine similarity, was lower by switch-
ing to the corresponding opposite modifier. The
first surprising finding that arises is the low sim-
ilarity values (negative values lower than -0.6 in
some cases), considering that the only change is
the modifier, while the emoji does not change. The
emojis that change most when switching the skin
tone are in the main hand gestures. Conversely,
the emojis that change most when switching the
gender modifier are people in job roles such as de-
tective (i.e. ), judge (i.e. ), police officer (i.e.

) or teacher (i.e. ). From these four items only
the teacher emoji is closer to the female modifier,
while the other three are closer to the male modi-
fier. In contrast, emojis referring to other jobs like
fireman (i.e. ), artist (i.e. ) or singer (i.e. )
do not seem to considerably change their meaning
when switching their gender.

4 Conclusion

In this paper we have studied the role of gen-
der and skin tone in social media communication
through emojis. Thank to the modifiers associated
with different emojis and the usage of a joint se-
mantic vector space of words, emojis and modi-
fiers, we were able to model the semantics of emo-

5For this last experiment we used the SW2V variant in
which emojis with their modifiers are included in the vector
space (cf. Section 2.2).

jis with respect to gender and skin tone features6.
Our analysis on a corpus of tweets geolocalized

in United States reveals clear connotations associ-
ated with each gender. For example, male mod-
ifiers being much closer to business and technol-
ogy while female ones are often associated with
love and makeup. Other connotations are present
with respect to the skin color, being dark tone hand
emojis more associated with derogatory words and
emojis7. In a more general perspective, these
modifiers clearly increase the ambiguity of emo-
jis, which were already shown highly ambiguous
in many cases (Wijeratne et al., 2016; Miller et al.,
2017). In fact, modifiers can render emoji mean-
ings very far apart, as clearly showed in Table 5.

While in this work we have approached the
problem from a purely analytical point of view,
our work can also be viewed as a starting point for
the development of accurate education guidelines
that could contribute to a reduction of gender- and
race-associated stereotypes in society. Addition-
ally, the understanding of emoji semantics pro-
vided in our analysis paves the way for the devel-
opment of debiasing techniques to be leveraged on
supervised and unsupervised models which make
use of social media data, in the lines of Bolukbasi
et al. (2016) and Zhao et al. (2017).
