Abstract

There is an extensive history of scholarship
into what constitutes a “basic” color term,
as well as a broadly attested acquisition se-
quence of basic color terms across many lan-
guages, as articulated in the seminal work of
Berlin and Kay (1969). This paper employs
a set of diverse measures on massively cross-
linguistic data to operationalize and critique
the Berlin and Kay color term hypotheses. Col-
lectively, the 14 empirically-grounded compu-
tational linguistic metrics we design—as well
as their aggregation—correlate strongly with
both the Berlin and Kay basic/secondary color
term partition (g = 0.96) and their hypothe-
sized universal acquisition sequence. The mea-
sures and result provide further empirical ev-
idence from computational linguistics in sup-
port of their claims, as well as additional nu-
ance: they suggest treating the partition as a
spectrum instead of a dichotomy.

1 Introduction

How many colors are in the rainbow? An infinite
number, but each language divides up perceptual
space into a finite number of categories by giving
names to colors. The seminal work on color cate-
gories, by Berlin and Kay (1969, hereafter B&K),
characterizes a universal evolutionary sequence for
languages’ core colors (their basic color terms)
and their corresponding categories, at each stage
refining the partition of color space.

A handful of criteria define basic color terms, in-
cluding abstractness, monomorphemicity, and not
being subsumed by a broader basic term. (See §2
for the complete list.) These criteria are accused
of biasing analyses of color systems—especially
in non-Western societies (Wierzbicka, 2006). To
mitigate this bias, a pan-lingual approach to analyz-
ing color systems may reveal general (“universal”)
trends more reliably than smaller datasets. While

data are hard to find in the long tail of languages,
we still aim to consider more than ever before—
2491 languages and dialects.1 We leverage natural
language processing tools to operationalize long-
standing literature on language universals.

We provide a three-pronged investigation of the
classic criteria for basic color terms, examining
the degree to which color words are abstract (§5),
monomorphemic/monolexemic (§6), and salient
(§7). Our operationalization of these (B&K) cri-
teria shows that individual features do not reflect
the basic/non-basic divide. Nor is this divide bi-
nary, as B&K suggest: We show that abstract-
ness, monomorphemicity, and even salience do not
cleanly divide colors.

Nonetheless, by treating basicness as a spectrum
and aggregating these features (like human-judged
concreteness, frequency of compounding, and word
length) into basicness scores (§8), we can largely
distinguish between basic and non-basic colors (val-
idating our measures), and our scores recreate the
historical sequence of color acquisition in lan-
guage. The sequence is in no way directly encoded
in the criteria for basic color terms; as such, recre-
ating it is a separate and novel empirical discovery.

1 To this end, we present a large cross-lingual, type-level
database of translations of basic and secondary color terms
across 2491 languages (§3).

2 Color Terminology

Not all languages have the same number of color
words; for instance, a single Korean color word
(pureu-n) applies to both grass and sky—an un-
usual concept for native English speakers. Simi-
larly, Russian distinguishes between two families
of what English speakers call “blue”: the lighter
goluboy and the darker siniy. Reaction time ex-
periments show the cognitive importance of these
categories (Gilbert et al., 2006; Winawer et al.,
2007), and the existence of a named category both
aids (Brown and Lenneberg, 1954) and guides (Bae
et al., 2015; Cibelli et al., 2016) color judgment and
memory.

Color terms may be concrete (i.e., derived from
a real-world referent like “blood” or “sky”) or ab-
stract. Diachronic processes can weaken the link
between a concrete term and its referent, until a new
cohort of speakers believes the term to be abstract.
Indeed, this process explains the development of
English color words (Casson, 1994). In addition
to metonymy with named things, the words may
be borrowed, compounded, or inherited from an
ancestor language.

While industrialized societies’ languages pos-
sess a wealth of color words (Hardin, 2014), only
a handful are considered basic color terms; the re-
mainder are secondary. A basic color term (BCT)
must satisfy four obligatory criteria (B&K):

1. It must be monolexemic (and monomor-
phemic). “Light blue” and “blue-green” each
contain two lexemes and do not qualify.

2. It may not possess any color hypernyms (su-
perordinate color terms). (E.g., “lavender” has
the hypernym “purple”.)

3. It may not be limited in application to a nar-
row class of objects. “Blond(e)” may only
be applied to a handful of referents like hair,
wood, and beer, for example.

4. It must be psychologically salient. This im-
plies that the color term has a stable range
of reference across speakers and has an entry
in the lexemic inventory of most (if not all)
native speakers’ respective idiolects.

Additional criteria are introduced in cases of doubt
(Kay and McDaniel, 1978), though these are subjec-
tively applied (Crawford, 1982). Among these: (5)
a BCT is not the name of an object that character-
istically has a particular color; in other words, the
color must be abstract, and not grounded in some
concrete object (which rules out colors like gold

and salmon). Additionally, (6) recent foreign loan
words “are suspect”, and (7) if the lexemic status of
the word is difficult to judge, then multimorphemic
words are also “suspect”.

In addition to this definition, (B&K) surveyed
speakers of 20 languages in the San Francisco Bay
Area, plus a sweeping examination of the literature,
to find a sequence to the emergence of color words
in language. Cultures with two color words uni-
versally used them to distinguish light and warm
colors from dark and cool ones; the third color was
universally red, and the sequence continued until
matching the set of eleven colors represented by
English basic color terms. We present their par-
tial ordering in Figure 1, though later authors have
proposed alterations (Heider, 1972; Kay, 1975).

We are not the first to assess the notion of a
basic color term. Crawford (1982) gives a point-by-
point rebuttal on pragmatic grounds—the criteria
are hard for a field worker to assess, and many
introduce subjectivity that will bias data collec-
tion. Lucy (1997) argues that the definition pro-
vides more of a post-hoc screening tool for when
the “denotational net” of elicitation has captured
too many terms, as opposed to a morphosyntacti-
cally informed approach (e.g., Conklin, 1955). Fi-
nally, Wierzbicka (2006) argues that other societies
may not share the Western conception of hue-based
color terms, making the application of the concept
inappropriate. In addition to these postulatory ob-
jections, a vast literature of similarity judgments,
reaction times, and other human measures debates
the question from a cognitive perspective (Heider,
1972; Jameson, 2005; Roberson et al., 2005, 2008;
Goldstein et al., 2009; Loreto et al., 2012; Persaud
and Hemmer, 2014, inter alia).

By contrast, we examine the conditions empir-
ically, broadly and automatically on a massively
multilingual scale (versus manually and theoreti-
cally). Our evidence for assessing B&K’s criteria
of abstractness, monomorphemicity, and salience
comes from a multilingual dragnet of color terms.

3 Data
We investigate the three aspects of our the-
ory assessment—abstractness, monomorphemic-
ity, and salience—through multilingual dictionar-
ies. We additionally leverage English corpora to
explore abstractness and salience. We use these
to construct a dataset of color senses and transla-
tions, with scores along numerous axes. As a final
resource to investigate salience, we use a global
elicitation of color terms from pre-industrialized
societies.

In English, the basic color terms are red, orange,
yellow, green, blue, purple, brown, pink, black,
white, and grey. These align to the eleven ba-
sic color categories identified by Berlin and Kay
(1969). In addition to these eleven, we consider a
list of 92 second-tier color terms identified by Cas-
son (1994). These were elicited from 30 speakers
over several days to ensure salience, then filtered
by a dictionary to keep only conventional (rather
than novel) color descriptors. We omit 12 of these
which do not appear in the datasets we employ.

Translation may act as a useful resource for dis-
ambiguating word senses (Diab and Resnik, 2002).
By translating English BCTs into other languages,
we can find their basic color terms. Then, back-
translating to English, we obtain a list of the poten-
tial senses of a given color term. We draw trans-
lations of color terms from two large type-level
dictionary resources, PanLex (Baldwin et al., 2010;
Kamholz et al., 2014) and Wiktionary, which to-
gether provide color word translations for 2491
languages or dialects.

For each of the 11 basic color concepts and
80 secondary terms e in English, we translate
it into every available foreign language ` by
dictionary lookup to get a set of non-English
color words F̀ . We then back-translate each
term into English (again by lookup) to get a
set E(e)` =

S
f2F̀ {e0 | trans`!En ( f ) = e0} of possi-

ble round-trip translations through the language `.
The final dataset contains tuples of the form (En-
glish color word, foreign language, foreign word,
English back-translation).

4 Summary of Experiments
We perform a series of experiments to explore the
abstractness, morphology, and salience of color
terms across thousands of languages.2 In addition

github.com/aryamccarthy/basic-color-terms.

to qualitative observations, our experiments evalu-
ate these qualities through several metrics, illumi-
nating flaws in the definition of “basic color term”.
When averaging the 14 features together, the im-
plied total ordering is suggestive of the original
B&K sequence.

Goodman and Kruskal’s gamma We measure
correlation between basicness and our features with
Goodman and Kruskal’s gamma (Goodman and
Kruskal, 1954, 1959, 1963, 1972), which is well
suited for comparing binary variables to ordinal
ones. It is a pair-counting measure which ignores
tied values. We compute it by maximum likelihood
estimation, giving an expression:

g = Ns �Nd
Ns +Nd

, (1)

where Ns is the number of color pairs for which
basicness and a feature agree in their ranking; Nd
is the number of pairs ranked in opposite orders.
Arbitrarily, we represent basicness as 1 and non-
basicness as 0. We will be concerned only with
the magnitude, not the direction of correlation. A
score of ±1 thus indicates perfect correlation with
basicness.

A remark on noise Each of our measures is im-
perfect; it possesses a bias. Combining the results
from many weak indicators gives robustness to the
noise in any given measure. Foreshadowing future
discussion, we see this supported empirically by the
effect of aggregation on Goodman and Kruskal’s
gamma.

5 Abstractness

The basic color terms in English did not start as ab-
stract concepts. For instance, “orange” and “pink”
were originally derived from the concrete color of a
fruit (Citrus sinensis) and flower (Dianthus plumar-
ius) respectively, and earlier the English color term
“black” had its origin in a word for soot, but the
abstract color senses of these words rose in relative
popularity; many supplanted the original defini-
tions as the more common word sense (Casson,
1994). It could be that many “basic” color terms
emerged metonymically from concrete, real-world
referents, as in English.

5.1 Concreteness judgments
As a first pass, we directly look up the concrete-
ness for each color word on our list, in a dataset of

et al., 1989).

40,000 English lemmas’ concreteness (Brysbaert
et al., 2014) as rated on a Likert scale by Ama-
zon Mechanical Turk workers in the United States.
As expected, we find that concreteness negatively
correlates with basicness (g =�0.58). Many non-
basic colors are less concrete than basic terms; for
instance, “beige” is the least concrete color (3.41),
and most words are less concrete than “orange”.

5.2 A hologeistic perspective
A word may have multiple senses, which we hope
to capture by taking a pan-lingual, or hologeis-
tic, perspective, getting at the concept itself rather
than any surface form. To do this, we find the

human-judged concreteness of each of our back-
translations, then average these for each color term,
weighted by the number of languages for which a
word is a back translation. This balances between
a single frequent sense and multiple infrequent
senses.

Performing this averaging over languages and
senses magnifies our correlation to g = �0.62;
clearly, exploiting the diversity of senses is ben-
eficial. Still, there is no clear separation between
basic and secondary color terms. Concreteness or
abstractness thus provides incomplete evidence of
basicness.

5.3 Part of speech as a proxy for concreteness
Adjectives are, on average, perceived as more ab-
stract than nouns (Darley et al., 1959). We af-
firm this finding: in the Brysbaert et al. judgments,
nouns are less abstract than adjectives on average
(3.53 versus 2.50). Because of this, we are comfort-
able using color words’ part of speech as a coarse
hint of their abstractness.

We collect part of speech annotations from two
sources: the Google Books Ngram Corpus, con-
taining about 4% of all books ever printed (Michel
et al., 2011), and the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al.,
1993). The former is machine-annotated for part-
of-speech (and thus noisier); the latter is annotated
by linguists. For each corpus, we compute the ratio
of adjectival relative to nominal part of speech, as
well as total frequency.3

6 Morphology

In this section, we ask whether there are affixes that
are highly correlated with color; these can be either
general derivational affixes or sequences specific to
color terms, as in Table 1 and Table 4. The presence
of subword structure in basic concepts’ translations
would show that they violate the monomorphemic-
ity criterion.

Although the B&K criteria demand monolex-
emic and monomorphemic words, color terms in
many languages are formed by some derivational
process from a concrete term. To discover the com-
ponents in an unsupervised fashion, as is necessary
for languages in the long tail of linguistic resource

3 These features work double duty—they shed insight into
both the concreteness and the salience as descriptive concepts
of each color word. It can lead to spurious ordering, though, if
not tempered by other measures—“gold” and “flesh” are both
frequent because of their material senses, so raw frequency is
not an indicator of basicness.



2245

availability, we look for constituent morphemes
and constituent lexemes by segmentation and com-
pound detection, respectively, on each foreign lan-
guage of our dataset, then use these to score colors’
basicness.

6.1 Affix discovery

Segmentation and affix discovery is a challenge
for the low-resource languages in our study. To
give signal to the model, we leverage our other met-
rics. We compute the percentage of the time that a
color word’s translation occurs with a suffix that is
strongly associated with one of the top 10-highest-
ranking colors on the basicness scale, according to
the aggregation we mention in §4 and detail in §8.
In other words, words that associate with a typical
color affix in that language tend to be colors.

This is not a test for basicness, per se, but rather
being a likely color, so it supplements the part of
speech measures. But it does diminish the rank of
almost all words with senses/translations that are
not primarily colors. In addition, this measure has
the highest correlation of any of ours with basicness
(g = 0.92)—though this is not surprising, as it was
computed by bootstrapping from the other results,
which already correlate well in aggregate.

As another tack, we identify likely color-
related and general derivational affixes by un-
supervised morphological segmentation. We
define a probability distribution over segmenta-
tions. Let S = s1s2 . . .sm segment the word W =
BOSw1w2 . . .wnEOS. We seek to find the optimal
S⇤. To do this, we decode a model

S⇤ = argmax
S

Pr(S) = argmax
S ’si2S

Pr(si)

using the Viterbi algorithm, where the individual
segment probabilities are maximum a posteriori
estimates under a Dirichlet prior (a = 0.01). The
model, inspired by Ge et al. (1999), is similar to
other unigram segmentation models (Creutz and
Lagus, 2005; Kudo, 2018). We then search for
these affixes across the terms recorded in that lan-
guage, to determine whether the affix is broadly
derivational or specific to color terms. Select re-
sults are given in Table 3.

Consider the -tic suffix in Nahuatl (nci). This
morpheme semantically denotes “color”; one com-
bines real-world referents with this suffix to obtain
colors, e.g., chichiltic (chili-color). This appears
even with black and white—the first basic color

terms in B&K’s ordering—implying that Nahuatl
lacks basic color terms under the B&K definition.

We also see derivational morphemes, which are
applied to words from a given part-of-speech class
to convert them to another class—e.g., “тут” in
Archi (aqc) in Table 3, which is a fused morpheme
denoting adjectivalization and marking Archi’s
fourth gender. This morpheme appears in the
Archi’s terms for black and white. As with Nahu-
atl, this implies that Archi lacks basic color terms—
according to a strict interpretation of the criteria.

6.2 Compound detection

To particularly identify color names which are
formed by compounding of words, we extend a
model for compound discovery to identify color
terms which were produced compositionally. This
lets us ask two questions about the BCT defini-
tion: (1) Across languages, are there “basic” color
terms that are not monolexemic, and (2) Are “basic”
terms less likely to be compounds? The answer to
both, we find, is “yes”.

Wu and Yarowsky (2018) propose a multilin-
gual compound analysis and generation method
that only requires a readily available multilingual
dictionary. They first extract potential compounds
by splitting any word into three substrings corre-
sponding to a left component, glue, and right com-

ponent. These compounds are used to construct
compound “recipes”. For example, they discovered
that the concept of ‘hospital’ is frequently repre-
sented across a variety of languages as a compound
of ‘sick’/‘disease’ and ‘house’/‘home’ in their re-
spective language. They use these recipes to score
their initial list of potential compounds, filter out
low-scoring, unlikely compounds, and performing
a second pass of recipe construction, resulting in a
higher-quality compound dataset. Compound anal-
ysis is performed in a similar manner as recipe con-
struction. Compound generation takes into account
language-specific knowledge of which components
and glues are common in that language.

Wu and Yarowsky (2018) consider only single-
or zero-character glue between the two components.
By contrast, we allow glues of arbitrary length,
exhaustively searching through all segmentations
into three parts. This increases the algorithmic
complexity by Q(K), where K is the length of the
word. Searching through our PanLex and Wik-
tionary foreign translations of only our basic color
terms, we find several examples of compounded
words. Some examples are given in Table 4. The
frequency of a color being expressed by compound-
ing, though, turns out to be a weak indicator of
basicness (g = 0.35).

6.3 An aside on borrowings
One of B&K’s lower-tier criteria for color terms
was that borrowings were “suspect”. Here we ex-
amine how often color terms are borrowed, as well
as other avenues for color construction.

In addition to translations and definitions, Wik-
tionary provides etymologies for many languages.
These relations have been parsed and extracted as
EtymDB (Sagot, 2017).

We report the aggregation of EtymDB’s parsed
etymologies in Table 5; these are broken down by
color in the supplementary material. Basic colors
are more often created by borrowing, suffixing, and

compounding than secondary colors; nevertheless,
this should be taken with a grain of salt: The an-
notations for secondary colors are less complete,
so while we use these scores, we do not take the
criterion of borrowings as a prong of our criticism.

7 Salience

B&K assessed salience by a color’s tendency to
appear earlier when asking speakers to list their
language’s colors. More general assessments are
outlined by Hays et al. (1972): word length, fre-
quency of use, ethnographic frequency, and corre-
lation of vocabulary size with cultural complexity.
While the final one of these is beyond our scope, we
present simple experiments to test the other three,
based on our translation dataset.

7.1 Word length
Durbin (1972) supposed, based on Zipf’s Law of
Abbreviation (Zipf, 1932, 1949), that word length
would decrease for more salient, broadly used color
terms. We test this across over 2400 languages by
computing the mean length of all translations for
each English color word, regardless of script.

With the exception of grey, the first six colors
of the (B&K) sequence—black white, red, yellow,
green, and blue—have lower average lengths than
the subsequent five. This supports Durbin’s two-
phase theory of basic color terms. Still, beyond this
handful, there is no clear separation between basic
and non-basic colors. There is only a moderate
correlation (g =�0.41) with basicness.

7.2 Frequency: Usage and ethnography
Neither English corpora nor multilingual dictio-
naries give a complete picture of the world’s lan-
guages; after all, only 3 to 4 thousand of them have
writing systems (Lewis et al., 2015). To augment
our analyses, we consider the grounded speaker
elicitation performed in the World Color Survey
(WCS; Cook et al., 2005). In it, 2568 speakers
from 110 pre-industrialized societies gave their
color naming judgments about colored chips on a
stimulus palette (see Figure 2) which evenly varied
hue and brightness. Field workers then transcribed
the utterances and applied the B&K criteria to as-
certain which colors were basic. With the WCS,
we can discover the synchronic homogeneity of a
term’s use for the labeling task.

Do all speakers agree that a given term should
be used? We examine the consensus of use

among words elicited in the World Color Survey.
For each elicited color word in the language, we
count the number of speakers who used it. In-
deed, the distribution is varied. In Figure 3, we
give a histogram of the total number of color terms
elicited from each language, as well as the con-
sensus for each individual color. We see a lexical
core and periphery for most languages. Most color
terms are unique, and languages may have up to
79 terms given among their speakers. It is natu-
ral for a speaker to use an unexpected word, still
believing the color to fit in a more basic category
(as with ‘turquoise’ and ‘blue’ in English), but it is
surprising that these words would not be sifted out
by field linguists’ “denotational net”.

Table 6: Goodman and Kruskal’s gamma rank correla-
tion between each measure and both basicness and the
diachronic color sequence. Features not thought to indi-
cate basicness (as discussed) have been negated. As or-
dering the sequence is more nuanced than sifting basic
from non-basic, one might expect consistently lower
correlations. However, the sequence gamma can have
larger magnitude if, despite poor sifting, the order of
the basic terms is correct.

Do all speakers have the same number of col-
ors? We look at the variability of sizes of each
speaker’s inventory for a language, rather than the
consensus on each term. The standard deviation of
inventory sizes from the speakers of each language
shows notable variation, especially when the mean
inventory size exceeds 6.

Heterogeneity in within-language color invento-
ries is unsurprising; as Kay (1975) noted, younger
members of numerous language communities pos-
sess a broader inventory of basic color terms, fol-
lowing Berlin and Kay’s evolutionary sequence of
inventories. Nevertheless, basic color terms are de-
fined on a per-language level; they ignore this syn-
chronic variation. This raises questions for future
work: Are there categories salient only to young
speakers, not the old? What would be a popula-
tion’s (or language’s) basic color terms?

8 Aggregation of Features

We have operationalized some B&K criteria for ba-
sic color terms. Independently, each fails to match
up with the known set of basic color terms. Now,
we aggregate our independent scores to create a ro-
bust measure of basicness from the weak measures.

We do not cherry-pick our measures; some that
we include actually harm the ordering. Instead, we

operationalize each criterion, then see what shakes
out. We take an unweighted average of normal-
ized scores for the same reason. This makes the
result more evocative; they come purely from our
operationalization, rather than targeted tuning.4

Using the aggregated measure produces the high-
est correlation with both basicness and the order of
the B&K sequence; see Table 6. We recover the
first six colors in the evolutionary sequence from
Figure 1: white and black, red, green and yellow,
and blue! An extended ordering is given in Table 7;
it suggests that the most primary of the non-basic
terms are gold, scarlet, crimson, and beige.

Some further inquiry is possible. We see that
orange is the 24th ranked color out of 91. This is
a stark separation from the ten other basic color
terms; beyond this, it has the highest concreteness
of the basic terms.

4 Nonetheless, we characterize the contribution of individ-
ual features in Appendix B.

9 Discussion

While the notion of a basic color term has been
widely used, its validity has been taken as given.
With NLP techniques in the broadest multilingual
survey by far, we add to the literature investigat-
ing the definition of basic color terms. The ability
to produce color templates shows that monomor-
phemicity is an unreasonable criterion. The con-
creteness of many color words’ back-translations
violates abstractness. Finally, the heterogeneity of
color naming data contends with the salience re-
quirement. None of the traditional criteria for basic
color terms hold up robustly. Despite this, when
taken in aggregate (and operationalized as we do),
they suggest the traditional sequence of color terms
and a coarse division between basic and non-basic
colors.

As color terms are often decomposable, we can
turn the decomposition on its head to generate miss-
ing color words. We have shown cross-lingual
patterns of word formation that future work can
exploit, giving plausible entries in a bilingual dic-
tionary (Wu and Yarowsky, 2018): Without the
word for “hospital”, one can convey the concept
by “sick”+“house”; likewise, without the word for
“gray”, one can use “ash”+DERIVATIONAL AFFIX.
Future work will investigate generation and valida-
tion of unseen color terms.

Finally, given that the divide between basic and
secondary color terms is so blurred, future compu-
tational models of these should employ models of
graded membership, such as fuzzy set theory.

10 Conclusion

This paper has investigated the universal basic color
term theories of Berlin and Kay (1969) and oth-
ers. It provides empirically-grounded computa-
tional linguistic metrics with evidence from 2491
languages, harnessing multiple on-line resources of
varying quality. We have shown that although the
obligatory criteria do not in fact cleanly separate
basic from non-basic colors, our features’ aggrega-
tion correlates strongly with the Berlin and Kay ba-
sic/secondary color term partition (g = 0.96). The
aggregation also largely predicts the Berlin and
Kay hypothesized universal acquisition sequence,
which is in no way directly entailed by the basic-
ness criteria. Thus, we provide further empirical
evidence from computational linguistics in support
of the B&K claims, while also providing additional
nuance and perspective thereon.
