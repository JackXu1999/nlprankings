Abstract

People typically assume that killers are
mentally ill or fundamentally different
from the rest of humanity. Similarly, peo-
ple often associate mental health condi-
tions (such as schizophrenia or autism)
with violence and otherness—treatable
perhaps, but not empathically understand-
able. We take a dictionary approach
to explore word use in a set of autobi-
ographies, comparing the narratives of 2
killers (Adolf Hitler and Elliot Rodger)
and 39 non-killers. Although results sug-
gest several dimensions that differentiate
these autobiographies—such as sentiment,
temporal orientation, and references to
death—they appear to reflect subject mat-
ter rather than psychology per se. Addi-
tionally, the Rodger text shows roughly
typical developmental arcs in its use of
words relating to friends, family, sex, and
affect. From these data, we discuss the
challenges of understanding killers and
people in general.

1 Introduction

In May of 2014, seven people were killed and sev-
eral others injured as part of a stabbing and spree
shooting in Isla Vista, California, that ended with
the attacker’s suicide. The killer wrote an autobi-
ography, which, in part, attempted to explain their1

actions. That piece of text is what initially moti-
vated this project.

Autobiographies are works that assimilate
memories of the past, largely in such a way as
to make sense of the present. Attempting to un-
derstand such works brings to bear fundamental,

or plural, of any sex (cf. AHD, 2016; AP, 2017).

opposing forces in the interpretation of any form
of self-report: Pulling in one direction are consid-
erations of reliability; these are the distorted rec-
ollections of a single, biased individual, so they
should be interpreted with skepticism. Pulling
in the other direction are considerations of privi-
leged insight; these are reports of experience oth-
erwise unobservable, so they should be valued.
These forces seem to be amplified when the re-
port under consideration is from someone who
has done or plans to do horrible things. Killers
are often unquestioningly regarded as mentally
unwell, which further questions the reliability of
their reporting. Killers are also often unquestion-
ingly regarded as (rare and interesting) monsters,
further evidenced—beyond the mere fact of their
actions—by the monstrous things they say. Both
of these forces in such extremes work to encour-
age a view of those who kill as ununderstandable2.

As an exercise in understanding, killers might
be viewed as reasonable (if perhaps biased; Davies
et al., 2001) people making sense of and acting on
their experience (much like a symptoms approach
to understanding mental disorder, such as imagin-
ing interlocutors have no faces for a perspective on
autism; Graham, 2013). Perhaps more accurately,
but to the same effect, the actions of killers might
be thought of as the same in kind as any other
action—that is, fundamentally irrational. The ac-
curacy of such an understanding is entirely irrele-
vant; there is no clear ground truth when it comes
to understanding others, so breadth and flexibility
of perspective make for better standards than ex-
actitude and certainty (in a similar vein to Feyer-
abend, 1975). Making assumptions, taking a stand
for or against, and deeming truths or falsehoods
are all stopping behaviors. Such behaviors allow

2007).

us to move forward and to think about other things
by providing a sense of clarity at the expense of
complexity.

2 Methods

Comparison Texts. Publicly available autobi-
ographies from Project Gutenberg3 were used as
comparisons to the Rodger text. This set includes
the autobiography of Adolf Hitler, which we con-
sidered to be more comparable to the Rodger
text, at least in terms of radical, murderous senti-
ment (particularly considering each text was writ-
ten prior to the actions that made these authors
killers). These and the authors of the other, “non-
killer” comparison autobiographies are listed in
Table 1, along with total word counts. Each text
was cleaned of meta information such as prefaces
and chapter headings, and larger segments of in-
serted text such as block quotes or included cor-
respondences. Texts were then parsed into sen-
tences, in order to analyze them at different lev-
els while holding the number of segments constant
and retaining some logical structure (as compared
with segmenting by word). Most of the presented
results use a set of 100 segments per text, with
17 to 113 sentences constituting each segment, de-
pending on the length of the text4.

Analysis. Text analysis applied to the study
of extraordinary events like murder and suicide
has tended to focus mostly on classification (e.g.,
Pestian et al., 2010), with a mind toward pre-
vention (e.g., Brynielsson et al., 2013). Though
such work is certainly interesting and worthwhile,
the goals of this project are more oriented to-
ward understanding (in a phenomenological rather
than explanatory sense). To this end, our analy-
ses were primarily concerned with patterns over
time (across segments), with a particular inter-
est in patterns appearing in both the Rodger and
Hitler texts, but not in the majority of comparison
texts. This was motivated in part by the appar-
ent contamination theme (McAdams et al., 2001)
through the Rodger text, in which an idyllic child-
hood takes a turn toward murder.

In this brief report, we focus on Linguistic In-
quiry and Word Count (LIWC; Pennebaker et al.,
2015) categories, looking at mean use frequen-

4To account for the disparity in word count to some de-

gree, category frequencies were weighted by segment word
count: adjusted frequency = frequency * (1 + segment word
count * .0001).

cies and trends through the course of each text.
All analyses (after LIWC processing) were per-
formed in R (R Core Team, 2017). Sentiment anal-
ysis was performed with the sentimentr package
(Rinker, 2017) using a dictionary based on Hu and
Liu (2004), and most figures were made with a
package currently in development5. The collected
dataset and all analyses are available on the Open
Science Framework6.

3 Results and Discussion

Anger and Death. Killers are generally thought
to be angrier and more death-obsessed than the
general population. Though word use does map
directly onto thoughts and feelings (as recently
discussed by Galasiński, 2017), certain relevant
word categories might be expected to track them.
This expectation is borne out to some degree when
looking at LIWC’s anger and death categories
across segments of each text. Figures 1 and 2
show local polynomial regression (LOESS) lines
for each text, with the Hitler and Rodger texts
showing marked increases in the two categories in
their ending segments. It is notable, however, that
the “killers” are not the most exaggerated of either
category (and are even, at times, among the least).
The Hawk and Lawrence texts each use death and
anger words at a high frequency, which is fitting
with their war-related content. Another compari-
son with a high anger use frequency is the Beers
text, in which anger words mostly appear in the
descriptions of treatment in psychiatric hospitals
(e.g., “. . . this man was cruelly assaulted, and I
do not know how many times he suffered assaults
of less severity.”7; Beers, 1917).

A slightly more refined, sentiment analytic
method accounts for some of this subject matter,
but makes much the same characterizations (Fig-
ure 3; see Table 2 for correlations between senti-
ment and LIWC categories). Here, the Douglass
text shows up among the lowest in positive senti-
ment. Much like the Beers text, the Douglass text
deals with cruel treatment, this time at the hands
of slave owners (Douglass, 1845). In the death
category, another comparison with a high use fre-
quency is the Darrow text, in which death words
are mostly used in the discussion of murderers and

is not captured by LIWC2015 version 1.3.1.

the justice system (e.g., “The killer’s psychology
is not different from that of any other man. Indeed,
in a large proportion of the cases the murderer had
no malice toward the dead.”; Darrow, 1932).

In both anger and death, the “killers” are similar
to their comparisons in that their high use rate of
each category is mostly reflective of subject mat-
ter. The Hitler text talks of war, which results in
high anger and death frequencies, due largely to
the words of war, such as attack, fight, destroy, and
enemy in the anger category, and, most notably,
war in both the death and anger categories8. In
terms of these LIWC categories, degrees of pas-
sion or sentiment may be washed out in discus-

sions of war. The Rodger text often looks similar
to the Beers and Douglass texts in its description
of cruel treatment (e.g., “I had been rejected, in-
sulted, humiliated, cast out, bullied, starved, tor-
tured, and ridiculed for far too long.”; Rodger,
2014), though, particularly with talk of death, it
gets more concrete and intentional than other texts
(e.g., “When they are dead, I will behead them and
keep their heads in a bag . . .”; Rodger, 2014).

These texts that are high in anger and death
word use seem to differ in level of focus—from
the grand, collective panorama of war, to the per-
sonal, singular experience of cruelty. Considering
pronoun use seems to clarify this difference. In a
cluster analysis (Figure 4), when i and we are in-
cluded with anger and death, the killers no longer
appear in the same cluster.

Affiliation and Personal Pronouns. Another
potential feature of killers is a certain purposive-
ness, particularly in their drive and planning. Op-
posing the similarities that showed up in anger and
death word usage, here the two killers differ in in-
teresting ways. On initial inspection of LIWC’s
drive categories (affiliation, achieve, power, re-
ward, and risk), affiliation seemed to have the
clearest trend over segments. The affiliation cat-
egory is something of a hodgepodge of social and
organizational terms, including pronouns, so it can

be difficult to make sense of all together. A look
at potentially group-related pronouns on their own
(i.e., the they and we categories) offers a some-
what clearer picture of references to affiliation.
As Figure 5 depicts, the Hitler text increases in
we category use frequency, while they category
use remains stable. In contrast, the Rodger text
both increases in they and decreases in we usage
over its course. These trends in affiliative refer-
ences track the broader narratives of each text: The
Hitler text ramps up to a political point, speak-
ing of the imperatives of a group (e.g., “We, Na-
tional Socialists, must never allow ourselves to
re-echo the hurrah patriotism of our contempo-
rary bourgeois circles.”; Hitler, 1939), whereas the
Rodger text moves from recounting early experi-
ences with others (e.g., “We would play Pokémon
on our Gameboys, and sometimes we would have
playdates where we played Nintendo 64 games . .
.”; Rodger, 2014) to speaking of others as targets
(e.g., “They deserve it. They must be punished.”;
Rodger, 2014).

Future Orientation. Part of the story told by
pronoun usage, particularly in the Rodger text, is
to do with temporal orientation—that is, a shifting
of focus over time. Looking at LIWC’s focusfu-
ture category (Figure 6), a similar trend appears,
with references to the future (e.g., will, soon, go-
ing) regularly increasing through the Rodger text.
The clear temporal structure of the Rodger text
may be partially due to its length; being so much
shorter than the Hitler text, for example, makes
for a tighter narrative with a single arc. An-
other contribution to the clarity of structure in the
Rodger text may be its clarity of intent; this text
was written expressly to explain the motivations
behind carefully planned, near-future events: “I
didn’t want things to turn out this way, but hu-
manity forced my hand, and this story will ex-
plain why.” (Rodger, 2014). The Hughes text—
which shows a similar clarity of structure in terms
of focusfuture—seems to share this clarity of in-
tent: “the narrator presents his story in compliance
with the suggestion of friends, and in the hope that
it may add something of accurate information re-
garding the character and influence of an institu-
tion . . .” (Hughes, 1897). In contrast, while
the Hitler text certainly has its intents, these are
broader and hold a longer view, being offered as a
description of a movement and its development, a
commitment of its doctrine, and the development

of its leader (Hitler, 1939).
Developmental Categories. The Rodger text is

in some sense a linear coming of age story, pro-
gressing at a steady pace from an idyllic early
childhood to a troubled adolescence and homi-
cidal early adulthood. Given this straightfor-
ward chronological layout of the autobiography,
it should be possible to assess whether Rodger’s
life (at least as presented) followed typical devel-
opmental trajectories over time, or was develop-
mentally aberrant in some way.

Research on child and adolescent development,
as well as text analytic studies on associations be-
tween language use and age, propose several clear
hypotheses of how language use should change as
individuals mature from children to young adults.
First, children gradually depend on friends more
than family to satisfy attachment needs; for ex-
ample, children tend to start shifting attachment
functions of proximity seeking (wanting to be near
someone) and safe haven (seeking support during
times of stress) from caregivers to friends in early
adolescence (Nickerson and Nagle, 2005). Thus,
normally developing adolescents should refer less
often to family and more often to friends as they
mature (Figure 7).

Adolescence is also associated with the often
abrupt emergence of sexual desires and a new de-
sire to seek romantic partners in addition to in-
timate platonic friends (Furman and Buhrmester,
1992). Accordingly, heterosexual adolescents
should pay less attention to same-sex peers or
friends, and focus more on potential mates of the
other sex over the course of their teens and early
20s (Figure 8).

Adolescence is also a time of increasingly in-
tense emotionality, due largely to rapid increases
in sex hormones, and stressful physical and social
changes, such as emerging secondary sex charac-
teristics and going to college, respectively (Com-
pas et al., 2001; Pennebaker and Stone, 2003).
Therefore, typical individuals may use more in-
tense affective language overall and more negative
emotion language in particular as they transition
from childhood to adolescence (Figure 9).

Perhaps surprisingly, given the fact that Rodger
is atypical in many respects—for example, their
intense antipathy towards women, homicidal fan-
tasies, and suicidality—the Rodger text follows
the predicted trajectories for most of the categories
mentioned (Figures 7-9). In becoming more nega-

tive in sentiment and using more emotional word,
and making fewer references to family and males,
and more references to sex through the course of
their text, Rodger appears to be a typical young
person struggling with the transition from child-
hood to adulthood. This apparent typicality is con-
sistent with analyses of larger samples of adoles-
cent mass murderers, who often experience de-
pressive symptoms and social rejection, but are
only rarely psychotic or diagnosed with severe
mental health conditions (Meloy et al., 2001).

4 Limitations and Future Directions

There are several clear limitations in the present
analysis and sample, and in this type of research
more broadly. First, most of the presented results
were of a few intuitively relevant categories that
showed both similarities and differences between
killers and non-killers. Other categories show sim-
ilar patterns, but are less clear in their interpreta-
tion (such as markedly lower rates of comma use
within the killer texts). There are also likely some
theoretically interesting categories we did not con-

sider, which show less clear patterns. This report
is more interested in thinking about the language
use and perspectives of killers than saying any-
thing definitive about them.

Second, very few spree or serial killers have
written autobiographies. Most existing autobi-
ographies of killers were written after the fact,
looking back and making sense of actions (as in
those of Donald Gaskins, Charles Manson, and
Dennis Nilsen) rather than ramping up to them,
as in the Rodger text. Additionally, few of these
texts are publicly or even readily available. Most
text written by killers nearer to the time of their
actions are short form (as in the journals of Al-
varo Castillo, Eric Harris, Dylan Klebold, or
Aaron Ybarra; or the suicide notes of Wellington
Oliveira, Jose Reyes, or Charles Whitman), are
primarily focused on some philosophical or po-
litical motivation (as in the manifestos of Pekka-
Eric Auvinen, Anders Breivik, Ted Kaczynski, or
even Mitchell Heisman—who wrote a substantial,
philosophical suicide note, but killed only them-
self), or are some combination of the two (as in
texts left by Christopher Dorner, Jim Adkisson, or
Marc Lépine).

Other texts from killers might include social
media activity (as in forum posts from T. J. Ready,
Jared Loughner, or Kimveer Gill) or creative
works (such as writings from Seung-Hui Cho, Kip
Kinkel, Jeff Weise, or Luke Woodham). These
want for better comparisons than the current auto-
biographies, due to the disparate forms of each text
and to the times in which they were written. Viable
comparisons would be time-paired, and might in-
clude anything from suicide notes by those who
died by suicide but did not kill others, to everyday
social media posts by controls matched on key de-
mographic or mental health characteristics.

5 Ethical Caveats

Although killers are increasingly leaving behind
linguistic traces of their thought patterns on social
media, email, and other forms of internet commu-
nication, a larger analytic issue is the base rate of
mass murder. The rate of homicide victims per
100,000 citizens is below 4 in nearly all developed
countries (3.9 in the United States, 0.9 in Ger-
many; UNODC, 2013), and mass homicides are
much rarer (Krouse and Richardson, 2015). As
others have noted (Cohen et al., 2014; Fox and
Fridel, 2016), with such sparse data it is doubtful
that behavioral scientists will ever be able to pre-
dict which potential killers will go on to commit
homicide, without incorrectly identifying a trou-
bling number of non-violent individuals. False
positives become particularly ethically problem-
atic with the prospect of labeling students, em-
ployees, or military personnel (for example) as po-
tential or likely murderers. A more realistic model
of prevention may be less psychological, and more
temporally proximal (e.g., involving weapons pro-
curement near to the time of a planned attack,
along the lines of Brynielsson et al., 2013).

A separate ethical concern involves speculation
about the mental health of individuals who are not
subject to standard diagnostic procedures, such as
structured clinical interviews (First and Gibbon,
2004). For over 40 years, the American Psychi-
atric Association has upheld the so-called Gold-
water Rule, stating that it is unethical for profes-
sional psychologists to diagnose a public figure
they have not personally treated (APA, 2013). Al-
though some have criticized the Goldwater Rule
for being overcautious (Kroll and Pouncey, 2016),
and argued that exceptions should be made for
mass murderers (Knoll and Meloy, 2014; Lake,
2014) or world leaders (Lenzer, 2017), the ma-
jority of mental health practitioners today abide
by it. Though we are not clinical psychologists
or psychiatrists (equally unqualified and unmoved
by APA principals), we have limited our com-
ments to the content of the two killers’ texts rather
than speculating about their reported behavior,
or claims about psychotherapeutic treatment they
may have received in their lives. That is, this
project sought insight into the mindset of killers,
and did not set out to diagnose anyone, or sug-
gest anyone was free of mental health conditions,
which may well have been present and diagnos-
able.

6 Conclusion

On something of a flipside to the ethical caveats
discussed, the main takeaway from this initial look
into the autobiographies of killers and non-killers
is that killers are not different in kind than non-
killers—as with people in general, these texts are
more similar than different. The clearest mark
of a killer is what defines them (i.e., killing).
This framing leads into two related considerations
when conceiving of others. The first is of catego-
rization: When we categorize (label, name, or de-
fine), we are modeling the world in terms of kinds.
This sort of modeling is useful for the purposes of
sense making, but those same sense making forces
attempt to realize and rarefy the models they pro-
pose. Once a categorization has been made (e.g.,
“killers” and “non-killers”), the second considera-
tion plays within that model. Part of the work of
a category is to add information beyond what is
observed. For example, sex might be defined by
the reproductive system, but the sex-bases sense
of others we have goes far beyond that distinction;
sex is seen as essential to the individual, which
is realized and reinforces through social and con-
ceptual processes. That is, we classify individu-
als based on a physiological feature, then fill out
those classes with patterns of behavior and ways
of being. In the same way, killers are classified
by a small set of their actions, which blossom in
the mind into monstrous figures with regular, de-
tectable patterns of thought and feeling.

Categorization is neither good nor bad; it is a
modeling tool. When and how we should cate-
gorize is a pragmatic question, much like classi-
fication problems in general. Posed in this way,
the limiting influence of a calcified model should
be evident; in the parlance of machine learning, it
is fully biased and invariant. Calcification in our
modeling occurs when we start to believe in the
realities suggested by our categorizations. If we
are too rigid in our model selection, we may fail
to make interesting, alternative model connections
(in the present context, rather than killers from
non-killers, we may more pragmatically distin-
guish individual- from group-level focus, as hinted
at by Figure 4). If our models themselves are too
rigid, we may start to view our data as ununder-
standable. That is, if the concept ‘killer’ rigidly
contains the feature ‘mentally unwell’, we will be
unable to even conceive of, much less understand,
a mentally well killer.
