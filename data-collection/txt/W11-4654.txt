Abstract

This paper presents the statistical part-of-
speech tagger HunPoS trained on a Per-
sian corpus. The result of the experiments
shows that HunPoS provides an overall ac-
curacy of 96.9%, which is the best result
reported for Persian part-of-speech tag-
ging.

1 Introduction

Data driven (machine learning) techniques for
word sense disambiguation have always been a
very active field and have attracted great attention
from many researchers in the computational lin-
guistics community. One of the usages of these
methods is in the task of automatic part-of-speech
tagging and that has resulted in some successful
data driven part-of-speech taggers such as MX-
POST (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) based on the maxi-
mum entropy framework, the memory-based tag-
ger (MBT) (Daelemans et al., 1997), Brill’s tag-
ger based on transformation-based learning (TBL)
(Brill, 1995) and Trigram ’n’ Tags (TnT) based on
Hidden Markov models (Brants, 2000). More re-
cent work on data-driven taggers include condi-
tional random fields and support vector machines
(Kumar and Gurpreet Singh, 2010) (Gimenez and
Marquez, 2004).

HunPoS (Halacsy et al., 2007) is an open source
part-of-speech tagger that was released as a reim-
plementation of TnT. The user can tune the tag-
ger by using different feature settings depending
on the language type. Hitherto, a lot of models
and implementations have been designed and are
already available for the task of tagging and most
of them have been tested for English and other lan-
guages but not many have been tested on Persian
texts. However, some statistical tagging methods;
namely a memory-based tagging (MBT) approach
and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), as

well as TnT have been tried out, but comparing
to other languages like English it is not sufficient.
Therefore, the evaluation of other part-of-speech
taggers like HunPoS would be of great interest to
discover how the tagger performs when applied
to Persian compared to other data-driven taggers.
This paper describes an evaluation of the perfor-
mance of the part-of-speech tagger HunPoS on
Persian. We apply the tagger on BijanKhan corpus
(Bijankhan, 2004) and vary the features used for
tagging seen and unseen tokens. This paper con-
tains the following sections. Section 2 presents the
open source tagger HunPoS. Section 3 describes
briefly the classification, the properties and the
script of Persian, prior studies of some statistical
tagging methods and also introduces BijanKhan’s
corpus. In section 4 the design of this experiment
follows and it introduces the experimental set-up.
Section 5 describes the results of the evaluation.
Finally, section 6 concludes this study.

2 HunPoS

HunPoS is an open source reimplementation of
TnT that is based on Hidden Markov Models
(HMM) with trigram language models, allowing
the user to tune the tagger by using different fea-
ture settings. The tagger is similar to TnT with the
difference that it estimates emission/lexical prob-
abilities based on current and previous tags. One
additional difference compared to TnT stands in
the fact that the tagger is open source whereas TnT
is not. The strong side of TnT, namely its suffix-
based guessing algorithm that is used for handling
unseen words is also implemented in HunPoS.
Moreover, HunPoS inserts a morphological ana-
lyzer to narrow down the list of alternatives (pos-
sible tags) that the algorithm needs to deal with,
which not only speeds up search but also very
significantly improves precision. In other words,
the morphological analyzer generates the possible
tags, to which the weights are assigned by suffix-

based gussing algorithm (Halacsy et al., 2007).

3 Persian

3.1 The Persian Language

Persian, also known as Parsi or Farsi belongs to
the Indo-Iranian languages, a subfamily of the
Indo-European languages. Persian is spoken in
Iran (Farsi), Afghanistan (referred to as Dari) and
Tajikistan (referred to as Tajiki). The language has
been greatly influenced by Arabic vocabulary and
has the same alphabet including four additional
letters; H� ,h� , �P ,À, which are the sounds of [p],
[Ù], [Z], [g], and texts are written from right to
left. Although Persian is classified as a SOV lan-
guage, colloquial speech does not usually follow
this order. Assi and Abdolhosseini (2000) notes
that the existence of a direct object marker en-
ables the speakers of Persian to use subjects and
objects in a free word order. In addition, there are
no gender distinctions in Persian as there are for
example in English (she/he). Possessiveness is in-
dicated by the genitive morpheme -e (ezafeh) in a
conversation but it is invisible in writing. Adverbs
can appear virtually everywhere in a sentence and
adjectives can follow or precede nouns. In Per-
sian there are several plural markers; ”-hâ” and ”-
ân”, Arabic plural suffixes such as ”-ât”, ”-in” and
”un” (used only for words of Arabic origin). There
is also a plural form in Persian that follows the
Arabic template morphology and is called ”broken
plural”.

3.2 Prior Studies of Some Statistical Tagging
Methods

The lack of a perspicuous morphology in Persian
for marking boundaries in an SOV system makes
it difficult to determine where the subject ends
and where the object begins. With respect to all
the factors existing in Persian such as the com-
plex verbal paradigm as well as the highly am-
biguous structure of the noun phrase and so forth,
quite good results have been reported on the per-
formance of several part-of-speech tagging meth-
ods such as TnT, memory-based tagger (MBT) and
Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) (Raja et
al., 2007). The utilized corpus in these exper-
iments is the BijanKhan corpus, consisting of
nearly 2.6 million words. Training and test set
were created by randomly dividing the corpus into
two parts with an 85% to 15% ratio and each ex-
periment repeated five times in order to avoid acci-

dental results. The overall accuracies reported for
the three taggers in due order are 96.6%, 96.6%,
and 95.9% (Raja et al., 2007).

3.3 Corpus

BijanKhan corpus was introduced in 2004 as the
first manually tagged Persian (Farsi) corpus in
Iran. The corpus is basically gathered from daily
news and common texts, and consists of syntac-
tic and semantic annotation of nearly 2.6 million
words, done by Prof. M. BijanKhan (and several
linguistics students following a particular instruc-
tion) prepared at the Research Center of Intelli-
gent Signal Processing (RCISP) in Tehran. The
corpus comes with statistical software for the cal-
culation and extraction of language features such
as: conditional distribution probability, word fre-
quency, and recognition of homonyms, synonyms,
concordances and lexical order with report func-
tionality. In addition, the corpus original tag set
contains 550 tags and are organized in a tree struc-
ture. The tag name starts with the name of the
most general tag and continues with the names
of the subcategories until it reaches the name of
the leaf tag. An example of a hierarchical tag in
third level of depth can be ”N PL LOC”; where
”N” represents noun, ”PL” shows the tag plural-
ity, and ”LOC” defines the tag as location. This
enormous number of tags are used to attain a
fine grained part-of-speech tagging that discrimi-
nates the subcategories in a general category but
since this vast amount of tags makes any ma-
chine learning process impracticable Oroumchian
et al. (Oroumchian et al., 2006), decided to re-
duce the number of tags to 40. All tags with
three or more levels in hierarchy were accord-
ingly reduced to two-level tags; in other words,
the above example reduced to ”N PL”. Some two-
level tags that were unnecessarily too specific were
also reduced to one-level tags. More specifi-
cally, these tags are conjunctiones, morphemes,
prepositions, pronouns, prepositional phrase, noun
phrase, conditional prepositions, objective adjec-
tives and wishes, quantifiers and mathematical sig-
natures (Oroumchian et al., 2006). The corpus was
processed in 2007 in order to be more suitable for
NLP tasks. This version of BijanKhans corpus is
in Unicode text format.

4 Experimental Set-up

This experiment has two phases, model selection
and model assessment. The goal of choosing these
two phases was to use model selection for esti-
mating the performance of different models in or-
der to choose the best one, and model assessment
for having chosen a final model and estimating
its generalization error on new data. The corpus
was split into a training set for learning or fitting
the models, a validation set (development test set)
for validating and estimating prediction error for
model selection, and a test set preserved for test-
ing and evaluating the generalization error for the
final chosen model. The size of each set was 80%,
10% and 10%, respectively, while in the model as-
sessment the sample data was divided into 90%
for training and 10% for testing. Prior to tagging
we need to train the tagger on a suitable tagged
corpus (the Bijankhan corpus) in order to build a
model. The tagging process requires two files con-
taining the model built by the training process and
an untagged (raw) corpus. The untagged corpus,
as its name indicates, contains no part-of-speech
tags and it has only one column consisting of one
token per line. Since the tagger has several train-
ing options we tried to make use of this flexibility
by setting several parameters for training. There-
fore, we ran several experiments to train the tagger
with different feature settings and combining these
as well. We experimented with the order of the tag
transition probability by setting the option -t to ei-
ther bigram tagging or the default trigram tagging
in order to estimate the probability of a tag based
on the previous tags. We also examined the order
of the emission probability -e for estimating the
probability of a token based on the tag of the token
itself as well as the previous tags. For tag distri-
butions of unseen words based on tag distributions
of rare words (words seen less than N times in the
training corpus) we used the option -f with the de-
fault value 10. Finally, we tested the -s parameter
that sets the length of the longest suffix to be con-
sidered by the algorithm when it estimates an un-
seen words tag distribution with the default value
10. It is noteworthy that the most desirable pos-
sible value of this parameter (-s) may depend on
the morphology and orthography of the language
involved (Halacsy et al., 2007). Thus, we tested
suffixes of length 10 (the default value), 8 and 4.

5 Results of the Evaluation

5.1 Model Selection

For the purpose of evaluating the results, the
tagged file by HunPoS was compared to the gold
standard (the original manually tagged validated
file) and the differences were registered. We have
evaluated the performance of HunPoS from differ-
ent aspects: the accuracy of the assigned tags, pre-
cision, recall and F score (harmonic mean of the
precision and recall) for different part-of-speech
tags, training the tagger with different feature set-
tings for the tagging lexical probabilities as well as
for the treatment of unseen words. The results of
training the tagger with a combination of different
feature settings showed that by applying the tri-
gram models, as could be predicted, we achieved a
higher accuracy than with the bigram models (Ta-
ble 1). In order to examine the tagger performance
for unseen words we had the possibility to vary the
length of the suffixes. Therefore, since the optimal
value of this parameter can be dependent on the
morphology and orthography of the language, we
tested suffixes of length 10 (the default value), 8,
and 4. Looking at the results appearing in Table 2,
we can infer a decrease in accuracy when reduc-
ing the length of the suffixes. Thus, for Persian,
suffix length set to 10 yields the best results. The
accuracy of the model selection as it is depicted in
Table 3 is 96.0%.

5.2 Model Assessment

Finally, in the model assessment, we augmented
the size of the training data from 80% to 90% by
adding the validation set (the development test set)

the model assessment, the file tagged by HunPoS
was compared to the gold standard (the original
manually tagged test file) and the differences were
recorded. Results in Table 4 shows the accuracy
achieved in the model assessment. However, we
can also conclude that the tagger performance was
probably influenced by the size of the training set,
since the accuracy increased with the extension of
the training data.

6 Conclusion

An evaluation of the open source part-of-speech
tagger HunPoS on Persian was presented here. We
applied the tagger to a Persian corpus and trained
it with different feature settings. The experimental
results revealed an overall accuracy of 96.9% for
the Persian language. By training the tagger with
different feature settings in this study we can de-
duce that applying the default settings of the tagger
can yield the best results for Persian. Moreover,
the size increment of the training data in the model
assessment (90%) led the system to achieve higher
accuracy. Finally, to conclude this paper, we can
state that with respect to the performance of other
data-driven part-of-speech taggers, such as TnT,
memory-based tagger, and Maximum Likelihood
Estimation, HunPoS is a good alternative for part-
of-speech tagging of Persian. The results reported
in this paper are the best published results so far,
although the scores may not be directly compara-
ble to those of Raja et al. (2007) because we do
not know whether the two studies used the same

training-test split.
