Abstract

This paper presents a case study on meaning
representation for Vietnamese. Having intro-
duced several existing semantic representation
schemes, we select AMR (Abstract Meaning
Representation) as a basis for our work on
Vietnamese. From it, we define a meaning rep-
resentation label set by adapting the English
schema and taking into account the specific
characteristics of Vietnamese.

1 Introduction

Semantic parsing, the task of assigning to a nat-
ural language expression a machine-interpretable
meaning representation, is one of the most dif-
ficult problems in NLP. A meaning representa-
tion of a document will describe who did what
to whom, when, where, why and how in the
context. This problem is well studied in NLP,
and many methods have been proposed to solve
semantic parsing, such as rule-based (Popescu
et al., 2003), supervised (Zelle, 1995), unsuper-
vised (Goldwasser et al., 2011), etc. Some appli-
cations of semantic parsing include machine trans-
lation (Andreas et al., 2013), question-answering
(He and Golub, 2016), and code generation (Ling
et al., 2016). Current research on open-domain
semantic parsing focuses on supervised learning
methods, using large semantic annotated corpus as
training data. However, few annotated corpora are
available.

Semantic representations have been developed
from different linguistic perspectives, in rela-
tion with diverse practical problems. Previously,
meaning representation frameworks such as Min-
imum Recursive Semantics (MRS) (Copestake
et al., 2005) and Discourse Representation Theory
(Kamp et al., 2010) were developed with the aim
of accounting for a variety of linguistic phenom-
ena including anaphora, presupposition, temporal

expressions, etc. Some recent meaning represen-
tations (Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR)
(Banarescu et al., 2013), Universal Conceptual
Cognitive Annotation (UCCA) (Abend and Rap-
poport, 2013), Dependency based Compositional
Semantics (Liang et al., 2013), Treebank Seman-
tics System (Alastair and Yoshimoto, 2012)) have
been designed to focus on presenting semantic in-
formation such as semantic role and word mean-
ing, or entities and relationships.

This paper focuses on Abstract Meaning Repre-
sentation (AMR) to design a meaning representa-
tion for Vietnamese. In the next section, we dis-
cuss in greater detail the existing semantic repre-
sentations for other languages and some dictionar-
ies and corpora in Vietnamese that are useful for
meaning representation. We then delve into the se-
mantic research that has been developed for Viet-
namese. Finally, we introduce our own work on
building a meaning representation for Vietnamese
based on AMR, and highlight the characteristics
and the difficulties met when expressing seman-
tics for Vietnamese text.

2.1 Meaning representation

Typically, semantic representations for a sentence
often focuses on the predicate (usually verb) and
its arguments. Researchers have been developing
meaning representations for a sentence or para-
graph to maximally exploit the semantics of each
context.

One of the most common meaning representa-
tions is the "logical form", which is based on pred-
icates and lambda calculus. When a sentence or
paragraph has been fully parsed and all ambigu-
ities resolved, its meaning will be represented in
a unique logical form. However, this only fully
solves a few simple cases. In contrast, in seman-



149

tic analysis, we often encounter complex structures
that cannot be captured in tree structures or simple
logical expressions, requiring the development of
more advanced semantic representations.

In Dependency-Based Compositional Seman-
tics (Liang et al., 2013), the authors present a rep-
resentation of formal semantics using trees. The
full version of this model can handle linguistic
phenomena such as quantification or comparison.
For their part, the authors of Treebank Semantics
System (Alastair and Yoshimoto, 2012) 1 describe
a method to convert existing treebanks with syn-
tactic information into banks of meaning repre-
sentation. Inputs to the system are expressions of
the formal language obtained from the conversion
of parsed treebank data, and outputs are predicate
logic-based meaning representations.

Universal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation
(UCCA) (Abend and Rappoport, 2013), based on
Basic Linguistic Theory (Genetti, 2011), denotes
semantic differences and aims to abstract specific
syntax structures. It includes a rich set of seman-
tic distinctions. UCCA contains a set of scenes
which includes: relationships, argument structures
of verbs, nouns and adjectives.

In this section, we focus more on two meaning
representations: Abstract Meaning Representation
(AMR) and Groningen Meaning Bank (GMB).

2.1.1 Abstract Meaning Representation
(AMR)

AMR, built in 2013 by (Banarescu et al., 2013),
is a logic-labeled semantic data warehouse (sem-
bank) for English. AMR captures the informa-
tion: "Who did what to whom?". Each sentence
is represented by a directional non-cyclic graph
whose labeled arcs represent relations and leaf
nodes represent concepts (Figure 1). AMR seman-
tic information is captured through events and con-
cepts described as predicates with their arguments.
AMR concepts are either English words, Prop-
Bank framesets, or special keywords.

AMR is used in many NLP tasks, and much re-
search has been dedicated to automatically gener-
ating AMR for various languages. This requires
several pre-processing tasks such as named entity
recognition, semantic role labeling, word sense
disambiguation, etc. Some AMR parsing tools use
stack-lstms (Miguel and Yaser, 2017), recurrent
neural networks (Foland and Martin, 2017), or

1http://www.compling.jp/ajb129/ts.html

Figure 1: An example of a graph in AMR

transition-based parsing (Wang et al., 2015). Most
of those methods are very recent and experimen-
tal. Besides, AMR has some limitations: it does
not present quantifier scope, co-references, tense,
aspect, or quotation marks.

2.1.2 Groningen Meaning Bank (GMB)
GMB (Bos, 2013) is a crowdsourced semantic re-
source. Its aim is to provide a large collection
of semantically annotated English texts with for-
mal rather than shallow semantics. It also focuses
on annotating texts, not isolated sentences, and
can integrate various semantic phenomena such
as predicate argument structure, scope, tense, the-
matic roles, rhetorical relations and presupposi-
tions into a single semantic formalism: Discourse
Representation Theory (Kamp et al., 2010).

Annotations in GMB are introduced in two
main ways: direct edition is done by experts, while
a game called Wordrobe lets anyone enrich it indi-
rectly. A first release of GMB contains 1,000 texts
with 4,239 sentences and 82,752 tokens. The fi-
nal version includes 10,000 documents with more
than 1 million words.

All those semantic corpora rely on the exis-
tence of resources such as dictionary, constituency
treebank, dependency treebank, Verbnet, Wordnet,
Propbank, etc. In the next section, we discuss the
necessary resources towards meaning representa-
tion for Vietnamese.

2.2 Resources for Vietnamese

Vietnamese language has received the attention
of many NLP research groups in recent years,
and many basic problems of parsing and semantic
analysis have been solved, but they generally only
revolve around simple vocabulary and syntactic is-
sues. Some notable efforts to build data for Viet-
namese NLP are:

• Dictionary: the largest dictionary built ac-
cording to the Lexical Markup Framework



150

(LMF) standard is the Vietnamese Compu-
tational Lexicon - VCL (Huyen et al., 2006),
(Luong and Huyen, 2008). Built in the frame-
work of a Vietnam national project, it con-
tains about 42,000 word entries. Its initial
goal is to serve for Vietnamese syntax pro-
cessing, and each item is described along
three dimensions: morphology, syntax, and
semantics.

• VietTreebank is a corpus containing about
10,000 syntactically annotated sentences in
Penn treebank format. As for English, the
label set of VietTreeBank includes part-of-
speech labels, phrase labels, and functional
syntactic labels.

• vnPropbank: the authors of (Linh et al., 2015)
have applied semantic role labeling to build
a vnPropbank that contains over 5000 sen-
tences from VietTreeBank. Contrary to the
English Propbank, Vietnamese framesets are
not connected with any other resource, since
there is no Vietnamese lexicon similar to
VerbNet.

• Vietnamese dependency treebank: in (Thi
et al., 2013), the authors define a dependency
label set based on the English dependency
schema. Next, they propose an algorithm to
transform more than 10000 sentences from
VietTreebank into a dependency treebank
(Phuong et al., 2015), (T-L et al., 2016). 3000
sentences from the Vietnamese dependency
treebank were integrated into Stanford Uni-
versity’s Universal Dependency project (Lu-
ong Nguyen Thi and Le-Hong, 2018).

In addition, (Nguyen et al., 2016) introduces
a lexicon enriched with syntactic and semantic
information, based on the VCL. This lexicon is
designed to serve for a syntactic and semantic
parser using the TAG (tree adjoining grammar)
formalism. The authors have assigned 23826 of
the 44812 entries in the VCL lexicon to TAG el-
ementary trees and logical semantic representa-
tions. This allows us to be able to make the infer-
ence of new knowledge from the original sentence.
It can be considered as a work of great significance
for analyzing Vietnamese semantics based on the
predicate frames and lexicons.

Thus, a number of dictionaries and corpora
which are useful for meaning representation ex-

ist for Vietnamese. However, these corpora have
limitations, and Vietnamese still lacks lexical re-
sources comparable to VerbNet, FrameNet or
WordNet for English, making the building of a
good semantic representation a difficult problem
and that will take a lot of time and effort.

3 A case study: Vietnamese meaning
representation

3.1 Annotation model
For Vietnamese, we have chosen to base our work
on AMR, which is a flexible and easy to under-
stand semantic representation, and benefits from
many AMR analysis algorithms developed for En-
glish. However, we identify some differences be-
tween ways of expressing meaning in English and
Vietnamese, and therefore need to design some ad-
ditional components.

Our goal is not only to answer the simple ques-
tion "Who is doing what to whom", but also to
add other information such as: where, when, why
and how. We want to show the relationship be-
tween entities in the sentence in the most complete
and understandable way. In addition, we would
like to overcome some limitations of AMR such
as adding co-reference, tense and some labels to
express function words and extra words, which are
very important in Vietnamese since they carry all
the information about gender, tense, time, etc.

3.2 Data
Vietnamese text: the data we use to test seman-
tic representation is a Vietnamese translation of
Saint-Exupéry’s The Little Prince. An AMR ver-
sion of it exists for English, which will provide us
with a reference for design, discussion and com-
parison.

We first implement a number of pre-processing
steps such as: word segmentation, part of speech
tagging and dependency parsing. These pre-
processing steps are necessary because they al-
low us to identify what the sentence components
are, their meanings, and the relationships between
them.

For example, the sentence "Nó [It] vẽ [draw]
một [one] con [animal classifier2] trăn [boa]
đang [present continuous tense] nuốt [swallow]
một [one] con [animal classifier] thú [animal]"
(It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act

2Vietnamese, like many Asian languages, has noun clas-
sifiers



151

of swallowing an animal) is pre-processed as fol-
lows:

1 nó P 2 nsubj
2 vẽ V 0 root
3 một M 5 nummod
4 con Nc 5 compound
5 trăn N 7 nsubj
6 đang R 7 advmod
7 nuốt V 2 dobj
8 một M 10 nummod
9 con Nc 10 compound
10 thú N 7 dobj
11 . PUNCT 2 punct

In which the third, fourth and fifth columns are
respectively the POS label3, the word from which
the current word depends on (head of a word), and
the dependency label.

We then build a meaning representation for this
sentence and conduct a comparison with the orig-
inal sentence in the AMR corpus:

(v / vẽ-01
:domain (n / nó)
:topic (t / trăn

:Arg0-of (n2 / nuốt-01
:tense (đ / đang)
:Arg1 (t2 / thú))))

(p / picture
:domain (i / it)
:topic (b2 / boa

:mod (c2 / constrictor)
:ARG0-of (s / swallow-01

:ARG1 (a / animal))))

In this example, English uses the copula verb
(was) while the Vietnamese version use a nor-
mal verb (vẽ - draw). Therefore, the main event in
the English sentence is p / picture, while in Viet-
namese we have v / vẽ-01. The word "constrictor"
is not translated in the Vietnamese sentence, so
there is no mod relation. In addition, as we want
to keep trace the tense information, we add the
new label "tense" to indicate the present contin-
uous tense in this sentence.

Vietnamese computational lexicon (VCL): we
rely on the aforementioned VCL (Huyen et al.,
2006) to extract the necessary Vietnamese seman-
tic information. Each of its 42,000 entries contains
information such as definition, POS, examples,

3P: pronoun, V: verb, N: noun, M: numeral, Nc: noun clas-
sifier, R: adverb, PUNC: punctuation

synonyms, antonyms, as well as some very useful
(albeit incomplete) information such as predicate
frameset, semantic tree, semantic role 4.

3.3 Discussion
We developed an application to assist the manual
annotation process, allowing us to choose, for an
input text, the meaning of words in the VCL dic-
tionary, add or update semantic labels. The output
is a meaning representation of the sentence.

We perform the labeling and build the AMR
label set for single sentences in the text of The
Little Prince. In addition to using the English la-
bels already in AMR, mapping 193 kinds of se-
mantic categories in VCL to entities in AMR, we
have introduced specific labels for Vietnamese to
overcome some limitations of AMR. While this is
an ongoing work, we can already present a few
first remarks on the application of AMR to Viet-
namese:

• Syntactic modals: we do not group words
like in AMR English. For example: "obligate-
01" instead of "must", "obligate". . . In Viet-
namese, there is not yet a list of synonyms
that could be helpful for this grouping, as in
English. For now, we still keep original syn-
tactic modals in the sentence such as: "phải"
(must), "nên" (should), "có_thể" (can). . .

• Adverbs with -ly: in Vietnamese, these
words do not exist. But we still use the "man-
ner" for adjectives that act as adverbs in a
sentence (which is similar to English, since
adverbs normally get stemmed to the adjec-
tive form). For example: "nhanh" (quickly -
quick), chậm (slowly - slow). . .

• Adjectives that invoke predicates: there is
a syntactic difference between English and
Vietnamese. In a sentence such as "Cô ấy rất
đẹp" (She is very beautiful), in Vietnamese,
"đẹp" (beautiful) is a predicate without "be"
as in English. However, they have the same
meaning representation because AMR leaves
out the "be" information in this case.

• Noun classifiers: in Vietnamese, a noun clas-
sifier is used before common nouns in the
noun phrase. They are generally referred to
as "individual classifier" such as: "cái nhà"
(house), "cái mũ" (hat), "con chó" (dog), etc.

152

Similar to Chinese (Li et al., 2016), we leave
out this word in the meaning representation.
There is, however, a special case: if a noun
classifier stands alone in a sentence, we need
to show its co-reference in the previous sen-
tence. For example: "Tôi có hai cái mũ. Tôi
thích cái màu xanh." (I have two hats. I like
the blue one.). In this sentence, "cái" indi-
cates "cái mũ" which is mentioned before.

• Tenses: the Vietnamese tenses are often de-
scribed by using function words such as "đã"
(in past), "đang" (in present), "sẽ" (in future).

4 Conclusion

We have presented some ways to represent seman-
tic information, and have further studied the appli-
cation of the AMR formalism to the representation
of Vietnamese semantics. Currently, we are con-
ducting AMR-based labeling of the text The Little
Prince using the VCL dictionary. As this task pro-
gresses, we will keep refining and proposing fur-
ther improvements to the semantic representation
schema for Vietnamese.

In the future, after completing the data labeling,
we hope to build an alignment tool between AMR
in English and AMR in Vietnamese so that we can
make a comparison between the two languages.
Besides, we would like to build a converter across
semantic representations such as from AMR to
GMB or UCCA.
