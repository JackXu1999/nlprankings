Abstract

This paper presents COAST, a web-based ap-
plication to easily and automatically enhance
syllable structure, word stress, and spacing in
texts, that was designed in close collaboration
with learning therapists to ensure its practical
relevance. Such syllable-enhanced texts are
commonly used in learning therapy or private
tuition to promote the recognition of syllables
in order to improve reading and writing skills.

In a state of the art solutions for automatic syl-
lable enhancement, we put special emphasis
on syllable stress and support specific marking
of the primary syllable stress in words. Core
features of our tool are i) a highly customiz-
able text enhancement and template function-
ality, and ii) a novel crowd-sourcing mecha-
nism that we employ to address the issue of
data sparsity in language resources. We suc-
cessfully tested COAST with real-life practi-
tioners in a series of user tests validating the
concept of our framework.

1 Introduction

Reading and writing disabilities are a pressing is-
sue for today’s society – approximately 4–8 % of
the German population suffer from dyslexia (Moll
and Landerl, 2009; Bundesverband Legasthenie
und Dyskalkulie e.V, 2014). Research on reading
acquisition has shown that phonological awareness
is a crucial skill for successful reading and writing
acquisition (Röber-Siekmeyer, 2005). Important
dimensions of phonological awareness are syllable
synthesis and analysis. Syllable synthesis refers
to the ability to blend syllables to a whole word,
and syllable analysis to the ability of segmenting a
word into its syllables. Experimental studies have
shown that syllable synthesis and syllable analysis
are essential components of evidence-based read-
ing training (Galuschka and Schulte-Körne, 2016;

∗ These authors contributed equally to this work.

Galuschka et al., 2014). Scheerer-Neumann (1981)
have shown that specific training of segmenting
words into syllables can improve reading accuracy
of impaired German primary-school children sig-
nificantly. Additionally, computer-based programs
for primary-school children that sequentially speak
and highlight syllables can facilitate the learning
process of reading (Jiménez et al., 2007; Olson and
Wise, 1992).

Based on these empirical findings, enhanced
texts with custom spacing and syllables alternately
displayed in different font colors are commonly
used in teaching and learning therapy to support ac-
quisition of reading and writing. This so-called Sil-
benmethode (syllable method) (Mildenberer Verlag,
2018) teaches children to focus on and understand
syllables and their structures rather than single char-
acters and is commonly used in Germany, which
is reflected by popular reading materials , such as
ABC der Tiere and Leselöwe, and by available tools
that facilitate the learning process of reading and
writing, such as Celeco Druckstation and ABC Sil-
bengenerator.

While first language acquisition happens through
mere exposure, learning to read and write is a
learned skill and thus requires explicit instruction,
similar to Second Language Acquisition (SLA). In
this regard, insights form SLA research on input
enhancement relate to reading and writing acqui-
sition. The well-established Noticing Hypothesis
(Schmidt, 1990) states that learning requires the
exposure to salient linguistic constructions that
may be recognized by the learner. To facilitate
this recognition of relevant linguistic constructions,
Input Enhancement (Smith, 1993) has been suc-
cessfully used, in particular in terms of visual en-
hancement of texts (e.g. colors, font changes, cap-
italization, spacing), cf. (Rello and Baeza-Yates,
2017; Zorzi et al., 2012; Meurers et al., 2010).

In response to this, we developed COAST.1

COAST is a web-based application to easily and au-
tomatically enhance syllable structure, word stress,
and spacing in texts. Its primary focus is on func-
tionality and practicability. In terms of functional-
ity, COAST offers a high degree of customization
for text enhancement, supports management of an-
notation schemes, and includes syllable stress. The
performance of detecting syllable stress strongly
predicts dyslexia (e.g., Goswami et al. (2013); Lan-
derl (2003)) and correlates highly with reading and
writing skills (Sauter et al., 2012) and, thus, is of
special importance for dyslexic children. Trainings
to improve the awareness of syllable stress are be-
ing developed and evaluated (Holz et al., 2017). We
extend the approach of text enhancement that are
provided by state of the art tools to make syllable
structures and stress more salient for German native
(dyslexic) speakers using NLP resources. Enhanc-
ing the text with such additional linguistic infor-
mation might boost children’s ability to segment
words into relevant components and might help
them to learn to focus on relevant areas of words
– as major orthographic challenges, such as vowel
length markers, mainly occur in (conjunction with)
stressed syllables (Staffeldt, 2010). To account for
practicability, we implement this functionality by
collaborating closely with prospective users and in
particular teaching practitioners to meet real-life
demands.

The remainder of the article is structured as fol-
lows: In Section 2, we report findings of a require-
ment analysis that we conducted in form of expert
interviews prior to the system design to determine
the wishes and needs of practitioners and compare
COAST to two state of the art tools currently used
in learning therapy and reading and writing acqui-
sition. In Section 3, we describe the framework
of COAST and explain the two core functional-
ities crowd-sourcing and text enhancement with
real-life use cases. In Section 4, we evaluate the
usability and user experience of COAST by means
of user tests conducted with learning therapists and
validate its practical applicability. We conclude
by describing the current state of COAST and pro-
viding an outlook for its further development in
Section 5.

2 Requirements Analysis

2.1 Expert Interviews

As the primary focus of our work was on the design
of a tool that allowed for the immediate practical

application by language teachers and learning ther-
apists, we performed a requirement analysis for
our system preceding its implementation. We con-
ducted four expert interviews with teaching thera-
pists to establish their wishes and requirements for
a text-enhancement tool that would facilitate their
work. During this process, we identified a series of
concrete requests going beyond the tool’s basic text
analysis functionality. They were centered around
four main issues: i) input/output options, ii) flex-
ible customization settings, iii) user profiles and
re-usability of settings, and iv) optional expert/user
judgments.

Input/Output Options proved to be of particu-
lar interest for prospective users. They emphasized
the wish to not only be allowed to upload their own
texts, but also to be able to flexibly edit them while
seeing the syllable enhancement. Therefore, we
provide a text box for users in which they may enter
and alter their texts. Regarding output options users
expressed interest in being able to choose between
the formats HTML, MS Word, and PDF/printing,
or simply copying texts with enhancements to the
clipboard. All of these were incorporated into our
system.

Flexible Customization Settings were, aside
from the I/O options, one of the most prominent
user concerns. We found that the text represen-
tations should be customizable not only in terms
of the basic text layout, but also preferably in all
aspects of the actual syllable enhancement. Thus,
users may freely customize the spacing of lines,
words, syllables, and characters, as well as differ-
ent font sizes. Furthermore, the visual syllable
enhancement is customizable in terms of the colors
used for stressed and unstressed syllables with the
additional options to assign a separate color to sec-
ondary unstressed syllables. Colors may either be
applied to the background or the font. Users may
further decide to additionally highlight stressed syl-
lables with bold font. They may also choose to
mark syllable boundaries with a freely selectable
delimiter. Finally, users can select certain parts-
of-speech to be either i) annotated, ii) marked as
unstressed, or iii) ignored. Combined, these param-
eters allow for a highly customizable text design
and visual enhancement, that gives users a high
degree of freedom regarding the representation of
their texts.

90



User Profiles and Re-Usability became rele-
vant concerns in the course of our expert interviews:
Our flexible customization options give users the
freedom to design text representations and visual
enhancements that are tailored specifically to their
purposes. However, users stressed the importance
that they could re-use their elaborate customization
across sessions, and that they need to be able to
switch between various customized enhancement
templates. To allow users to save, manage, and
re-use their templates, we created user accounts
that allow users to locally save their customization.
Users may also save the texts they uploaded under
a user-defined title in previous sessions.

Expert/User Judgments proved to be a final,
pressing issue for prospective users: The option to
adjust the automatic analyses in cases where users
disagree with the syllabification or stress annota-
tion performed by the system was crucial to our
prospective users. To give them complete authority
over their analyses, each of both analyses may be al-
tered by the user on click. Furthermore, they asked
us to flag words that were unknown to our system
and thus more error prone. To facilitate manual
corrections, we offer users to review all unknown
words consecutively in a separate view, where they
are supported by the syllabification and stress sug-
gestions of our systems. All changes conducted by
users are saved in their local syllabification data
base and used for future analyses. Users may re-
view and edit these new entries in their account
settings. A final suggestion of our expert users was
to allow the system to learn from user feedback.
We thus include a crowd-sourcing based mecha-
nism for updates to the global data base, which is
explained in detail in Section 3.2.

2.2 Related Work

There are two dominant syllable enhancement tools
for German whose functionality is centered around
the so called Silbenmethode (“syllable method”),
in which reading is taught by focusing on sylla-
bles and their pronunciation rather than single char-
acters: the Silbengenerator (“syllable generator”)
and the Celeco Druckstation (“Celeco printing sta-
tion”).2 Table 1 shows a comparison of the tools
with COAST based on the characteristics that we
identified in our expert interviews and some more

2We are not aware of any tools for the English market that
provide any syllable enhancement beyond character-based
markings.

general usability considerations.

Silbengenerator is a Windows program pub-
lished by Mildenberger Verlag (2018).3 It is part of
their ABC der Tiere (“animal alphabet”) series of
learning materials based on syllabification as read-
ing aid. Its main functionality is to allow teachers
to visually enhance syllables in their reading ma-
terials. While the full version has to be purchased,
a free demo is freely available for downloads on
their web page.The tool allows users to upload own
texts for analyses, but not to modify them from
within the tool via some form of text box. Sup-
ported output formats for enhanced texts are MS
Word or PDF/print. The general text layout is ad-
justable in terms of line spacing, fonts, font sizes,
text alignment, line breaks, and background color.
However, more advanced changes to the text lay-
out, such as customized syllable, character, or word
distances are not supported. The latest customized
layout may be re-used upon system restart, but it
is not possible to store multiple templates. Sylla-
bles are visually enhanced using the conventions
of the ABC der Tiere materials, which hyphenates
syllables and additionally marks alternating sylla-
bles with red and blue font. Monosyllabic words
default to blue. Word stress is not encoded. To
accommodate limited printing capacities, syllables
may be enhanced using gray and black instead of
red and blue, but further customization is not sup-
ported. Users may locally overwrite the syllable
boundaries set by the system for individual words
by editing a plain text file outside of the program.
Changes are applied to all documents upon restart.
Changes during run-time or for individual docu-
ments are not supported User corrections are not

re-used to improve the system’s syllabification per-
formance. The Silbengenerator also includes a
limited tutoring functionality, which includes two
variations of syllable reading exercises as well as
capitalization, vowel, and spelling training.

Celeco Druckstation is a Windows program dis-
tributed by Celeco (Klische, 2007).4 Since there is
no free demo version, we base our review on the
elaborate tool description provided on their web
page. It should be pointed out that – unlike the Sil-
bengenerator and our system – the Celeco Druck-
station is distributed as a full fledged diagnosis and
therapy tool for reading disorders for learning ther-
apists and home tutoring alike. It thus provides a
number of tests and exercises for reading and diag-
nosis, which are generated from texts specified by
the user. This also includes a syllable enhancement
facility that allows to load texts into the program,
visually enhance syllables, and print them. Celeco
Druckstation offers to adjust the basic text layout
in terms of fonts, font size, font color, and back-
ground color. It also supports advanced layout
modifications in terms of text segmentation: users
may choose to put spaces after every syllable or
every 3rd, 4th, or 5th character. Syllables are en-
hanced with two alternating, freely customizable
colors, or with syllable arcs. No special encoding
of word stress is offered. Users may provide indi-
vidual syllable analyses of unknown words. These
are saved in a local data base. However, the syllab-
ification of known words can – as far as we could
determine – not be altered by the user. We could
not determine whether enhancement settings may
be saved and re-used as templates.

3 Tool

3.1 System Description
We developed COAST as a platform-independent
web-based tool that is deployed with Apache on
a server hosted on the Amazon Web Services
(AWS).5 The front-end was developed with HTML,
CSS, JavaScript, and AngularDart. 6 The back-
end was developed with Python using the frame-
works Flask,7 and SQLAlchemy. 8 We use spaCy
(Honnibal and Johnson, 2015) for natural language
processing (NLP).

Target Users are on the one hand teaching prac-
titioners, but on the other hand any person with an
interest in syllabified reading material, such as tu-
tors or parents. We account for this divide with two
separate types of user accounts: regular and expert
users. Currently, this distinction is relevant for our
crowd-sourcing mechanism, which is discussed in
Section 3.2.

Analyzing Input Texts is the core functionality
of COAST. Figure 1 shows the workflow of auto-
matic text analysis and enhancement. Before users
can enhance texts in the front-end as described
in Section 3.2, texts need to be processed accord-
ingly: First, spaCy is used for parsing, tokenization,
and part-of-speech (PoS) tagging. The letters of
a word and its PoS are used as a combined pri-
mary key to query the global and local database
stored in SQLite. The global database is initialized
with the German version of the language corpus
CELEX2 of Baayen et al. (1995) and is available
to all users. For the approximately 360,000 lem-
mas and inflected word forms that are included in
CELEX2, we infer primary word stress and syl-
lable structure from CELEX2’s orthographic and
phonetic transcriptions.The local database consists
of manually annotated entries and is only avail-
able to the specified user. If an entry was found,
the syllabification, syllable stress, and lemma of
the word are returned. If no entry was found, the
word is marked as unknown and must be manually
annotated. Manually annotated entries are auto-
matically stored in the local database of the user
and forwarded to the crowd-sourcing mechanism
explained in detail in Section 3.2. The annotated
information is used afterwards to enhance syllables
and words of the text as can be seen in Appendix A,
Figure 5. Further linguistic information for each
enhanced word may be obtained individually, see
Appendix A, Figure 6.

3.2 Features

Crowd-Sourcing is one of COAST’s most inno-
vative features. We exploit the crowd-knowledge
for long-term improvements of our automatic syl-
labification and word stress analysis. Currently, the
crowd is derived from COAST’s active users. To re-
liably identify not only syllable boundaries but also
stress patterns is one of the biggest challenges in
automatic syllable enhancement due to limitations
of the available linguistic resources. This is espe-
cially true for languages other than English and

92

for German this issue is particularly pressing, be-
cause irrespective of the size of the underlying data
base, morphological composition and derivation
are highly productive in German, which makes the
occurrence of unknown words more likely. This
issue of data sparsity is well-known from other
NLP applications such as machine translation or
information retrieval, and often addressed in work
on compound splitting (Ziering and van der Plas,
2016; Weller et al., 2014). Furthermore, both pro-
cesses may alter the word stress making the issue
more difficult (Féry, 1998).

During the expert interviews it became apparent
that prospective users prefer to be alerted to un-
known words that may have been mis-analyzed, so
they may review and if necessary manually correct
them. In this context, we found that users would
also prefer the system to learn from their correc-
tions so that they could contribute to making the
system more efficient in the long run. Together
with our experts we therefore developed a crowd-
sourcing mechanism, that would allow local cor-
rections of users to be incorporated to our system’s
global data base after they have been verified by
either two more users or an expert user. We de-
rived this role of an expert user to prioritize the
votes of learning therapists and linguists over lay-
man judgments. Upon registration, new users may
self-identify as experts or as regular users. A veri-
fication of this self-assignment remains for future
work.Experts may also revoke crowd-induced up-
dates to the data base. With this combined expertise

and additional layer of control through experts, our
system may draw from a constantly growing pool
of analyses, which ultimately increases its usability
and robustness while building a promising resource
for future work.

The verification mechanism is located on a sep-
arate page that asks users to voluntarily identify
syllable boundaries and word stress of words un-
known to the system. To facilitate analyses, we
provide users with information on how our auto-
matic tools would analyze a word as help as well
as with previous analyses of other users. We incor-
porate the freely accessible MARY-TTS (Schröder
and Trouvain, 2003) for automatic suggestions for
stress annotation and Pyphen for syllabification.
We require users to manually annotate each word
unknown to the database due to insufficient per-
formance of automatic stress assignment. This is
an extensible framework, which may be expanded
with more detailed information in the future.

The following use case illustrates this process:
User 1 uploads a text containing two words un-
known to the system: Hitzeschock (“heat shock”)
and Hacken (“heels”). She is asked to determine
the syllable boundaries and stress (marked in bold
font) for both words and submits Hit-ze-schock and
Hac-ken. This syllabification assumes a bisyllabic
consonant doubling for both terms. While this is
correct for most consonants at syllable boundaries,
ck is an exception to this rule which is unknown
to many laymen. Thus, when our system prompts
Users 2 and 3 to verify User 1’s analysis, they agree
with her and both analyses are updated to the global
data base. User 4 uploads another text containing
Hitzeschock. Afterwards, the word is not flagged
as unknown, but analyzed together with all other
words that were originally included in the data base.
Expert User 5 is asked to review the updates to the
data base. She identifies the mistake that has been
made and revokes the analysis of Hacken to Ha-
cken. The entry is immediately corrected in the
global data base and will be displayed correctly for
all future analyses.

Text Enhancement is the core functionality of
our tool. We enhance syllable boundaries as well
as – unlike other systems – stress. For this, we
rely on automatic analyses and manual post-hoc
corrections by the user for words that are flagged
as unknown: Our expert interviews clearly showed
that prospective users not only prefer a high de-
gree of customization in the visual representation

93

of their texts, but also want to re-use and switch be-
tween templates. Therefore, we not only facilitate
advanced customization options for the text and
enhancement layout, but also allow users to store
various templates, which may be consecutively ap-
plied to a text with a simple click.

Our settings feature two main categories: First,
they allow to modify the enhancement of syllable
stress by allowing users to choose freely the col-
ors assigned to i) stressed syllables, ii) unstressed
syllables, and optional iii) the second unstressed
syllable. Stressed syllables may be enhanced with
bold font. Users can choose whether to apply
the color enhancement to the font or the syllables’
background. Furthermore, syllable boundaries may
be made more salient by using a syllable delim-
iter character that users may choose freely. Finally,
users may specify to which extend certain parts of
speech should be analyzed, e.g. they may choose
to ignore articles or to default connectives to be
enhanced as unstressed. Second, they allow users
to customize the text layout independent of the syl-
lable enhancement. This includes basic options
such as adjusting font size or line space. How-
ever, we also allow to freely choose the distance of
words, syllables, and characters. Users may further
make word boundaries more salient by choosing
a background color for them. The combination
of these syllable enhancement and text layout set-
tings may be saved under a descriptive title as a
template, which may be re-used and altered at any
point across texts or sessions.

The following use case illustrates how this
works: User 1 works with children with reading dis-
abilities from two groups: Group A uses the ABC
der Tiere materials in school. The children are thus
used to the blue and red layout, which User 1 wants
to alter as little as possible, while still providing her
pupils with materials that also mark syllable stress.
Therefore, she customizes a template to use the

Figure 3: Template inspired by Leselöwen.

ABC der Tiere style for her enhancement. Figure 2
shows the result for the sentence Ich beratschlagte
mein Meisterwerk mit einem Elefanten und einer
Riesenschlange (“I consulted my masterpiece with
an elephant and a giant snake”).

She sets the marking color of stressed syllables
to dark red and of unstressed to blue. In order to
make the alternation of syllables more salient, sec-
ondary unstressed syllables are also marked in red.
To clearly distinguish them from stressed syllables,
she additionally uses bold font to mark stress and
uses a lighter type of red to mark secondary un-
stressed syllables. Because ABC der Tiere colors
monosyllabic words in blue, User 1 further sets
typically monosyllabic parts of speech, such as
articles and prepositions, from the analysis to be
analyzed as unstressed. Finally, she makes syllable
boundaries more salient by widening the distance
between syllables. To make word boundaries more
salient, despite this increased syllable distance, she
further widens word distance and assigns a beige
background color to words.

Children from Group B do not use the ABC der
Tiere materials at school, but they are reading syl-
labified stories at home from the Leselöwen (“read-
ing lions”) materials by the Loewe publisher.9

These materials use three colors to mark alternating
syllables and they do not treat monosyllabic words
differently from others. For this group, too, User
1 wants to make stressed syllables more salient in
her materials, while otherwise not deviating much
from the layout the children are already used to.
Thus, she designs a second layout which mimics
the Leselöwen style. The result of applying this
template to the same sentence she used for Group
A may be seen in Figure 3.

The colors used by Leselöwen are green, red,
and blue. She assigns stressed syllables the color

content-1013-1013/leseloewen/

94



green and again additionally marks them with bold
font. Unstressed and secondary unstressed sylla-
bles are colored red and blue. Because this style
already features three colors, she does not want to
use a background color for words. At the same
time, she wants to make word as well as syllable
boundaries more salient. For this, User 1 chooses
to mark syllable boundaries with a delimiter (in
this case =) but without additional space between
syllables and increases the distance between words.
While the initial customization took a couple of
minutes, User 1 may re-apply her two templates to
any text in the future, reducing the time required
for customization to mere seconds. She may also
alter the templates at any time or add new ones
when required.

4 Evaluation

We conducted user tests to evaluate COAST with
both practitioners as well as with non-experts. Prior
to these, we performed an internal pilot testing to
identify runtime issues that are not directly related
to the functionality of COAST.

Five scenarios were defined to evaluate the
tool’s functionality, usability, and user experience.
They cover i) account creation, ii) text analysis and
enhancement, iii) generation and use of annotation
templates, iv) reuse of previously stored texts, and
v) verification of user-generated entries (“crowd-
sourcing”).

In the first scenario, the users were asked to
create an account with given credentials.

The second scenario consisted of four major
steps: First, users were asked to log into the re-
cently created account. Secondly, they had to
switch to the Text Analysis view of the tool and
to analyze and enhance a given text. After analyz-
ing the text, they were told to clarify all words un-
known to the system, which are flagged and shaded
in red. Finally, users were asked to adjust the anno-
tation settings based on their personal preferences.

The third scenario covered the instructed genera-
tion and use of annotation templates. Users were
asked to rebuild two annotation schemes by adjust-
ing the annotation settings and save them as new
templates.

In the fourth scenario, users were asked to store
the analyzed text in their account and re-analyze it
by selecting the stored text in the Account view of
the tool.

In the fifth and final scenario, users were re-
quired to verify entries added by other users that
are unknown to the global database. In order to do
so, they were asked to switch to the Verification
view (see Figure 7) and approve or edit five entries.

The second, third, and fifth scenario are of spe-
cial importance as they cover the core-functionality
of COAST and can be seen in Figure 8.

User Tests were conducted by seven users from
two groups: three experts (learning therapists) to
receive subject-specific feedback and four laymen
to evaluate the general usability of the tool. The
three experts were women aged between 40 and 51
(M = 45). The laymen aged between 22 and 27
(M = 25) included two men and two women with
non-educational professions. The user test was
carried out equally for both groups. None of the
participants had interacted with the system before.

We used the after-scenario questionnaire (ASQ)
by Lewis (1995) for quantitative data analysis.
They were answered for each scenario directly after
its completion. The ASQ consists of three ques-
tions covering ease of use, time efficiency, and
documentation of the tool:

1. Overall, I am satisfied with the ease of use of
completing the tasks in this scenario

2. Overall, I am satisfied with the amount of time
it took to complete the tasks in this scenario

3. Overall, I am satisfied with the support and
documentation when completing the tasks

We used a five-point Likert scale ranging from
strongly agree to strongly disagree.

For qualitative analysis, the users were explic-
itly instructed to “think-aloud” (Rauterberg, 1996)
while working on a scenario, thus told to accurately
comment each of their actions and to express ex-
pectations, thoughts, and critics.

The user test was carried out as follows: Users
were free to use their preferred browser for the
user test. The default browser was Google Chrome.
The user test was conducted on the users’ personal
laptop if possible, to recreate their home or work
environment and to mimic a real-life application
as close as possible. If no personal laptop was
available, users were provided with one. All input
devices were configured according to user prefer-
ences. After setting up the work place, users were
informed and instructed about the procedure of the
user test, its purpose and the think-aloud method.

95



After clarifying all questions, users processed all
scenarios consecutively in fixed order. The user
tests were concluded with an interview to get gen-
eral feedback and to assess the usefulness of the
tool with respect to the users’ professions.

4.1 Results
The results of the second, third, and fifth scenario
are explained in detail due to their relevance, results
for scenario one and four can be found in the Table
2.

We normalized the options of the ASQ to range
from −2 (strongly disagree) to +2 (strongly agree)
with 0 (neither) being neutral. In the following, we
report positive values (i.e. agree, strongly agree)
as positive feedback, negative values (i.e. disagree,
strongly disagree) as negative feedback. For a more
detailed differentiation of the user feedback, please
see Figure 4.

The second scenario was successfully completed
by all users. The ease of use (M = 1.57, SD =
0.53) and documentation (M = 1.57, SD = 0.53)
of the tool was rated 100 % positively in the ASQ,
time efficiency received 86 % positive and 16 %
neutral ratings (M = 1.57, SD = 0.78). Some
users criticized the layout of the Text Analysis view,
suggesting a more compact representation of the
annotation settings.

The third scenario was completed by five users
without help, two needed hints from the investiga-
tor to complete all tasks. While the first template
could be rebuilt by all users, two users required
help with the second template. Error source was
the confusion about and between the features Silbe
hervorheben (enhance syllables), with which either
the fore- or background color of syllables could
be adjusted accordingly, and Wort Hintergrund-
farbe (word background color), with which the
background color of words could be set (see Fig-
ure 5). Three users completed this scenario by
trial-and-error. The ease of use of this scenario was

The think-aloud and concluding interviews addi-
tionally revealed general layout and design flaws
of COAST’s visual appearance. While this goes
beyond the scope of this paper, we list problems,
comments, and feature requests directly linked to
the core features of our tool: i) the general navi-
gation of the tool was not very intuitive and self-
explaining, ii) some features could only be ac-
cessed with scrolling, which was not explicitly visi-
ble to the users, iii) some features, e.g. background
color of words and syllable enhancement, need
explicit documentation/tutorials, iv) some users
asked for a simple solution to color syllables al-
ternately independently of syllable stress, v) the
feature to not enhance monosyllabic words instead

96



of unchecking the annotation of typically monosyl-
labic parts of speech was requested, vi) fore- and
background color of syllables and words should
independently be customizable.

5 Conclusion and Outlook

COAST is a highly user-oriented, platform inde-
pendent, web-based and easily extensible frame-
work for the automatic augmentation of texts with
syllable, stress, and word enhancement. It was de-
veloped in close collaboration with practitioners
and includes a series of features which were ex-
plicitly requested by prospective users and that are
lacking from currently available, state of the art
systems. This paper presents and evaluates its abil-
ity to generate appropriate reading materials based
on real-life use cases. Additionally, we evaluated
the practical applicability of our tool by conducting
user tests based on a series of real-life scenarios.

Our exemplary enhanced texts (see Figure 2 and
3) prove that appropriate reading materials can be
easily generated automatically, customized, and
exported with COAST. The use cases show that
the tool meets the requirements deduced from the
a priori requirement analysis based on our expert
interviews. Compared to other tools that support
syllable enhancement, COAST offers a higher de-
gree of customization and more features, such as
annotating syllable stress, setting spacing of lines,
words, syllables, and characters. The automatic
analysis of syllable stress and part of speech also
make COAST linguistically more informed than
other tools. Finally, we carried out user tests with
special focus on practical application. These indi-
cate that the majority of users were able to solve
the tasks intuitively and time efficiently for each of
the scenarios.

We have successfully shown that the current ver-
sion of COAST allows practitioners to generate
enhanced texts as reading materials for their teach-
ing. Being able to save annotation templates and
texts has proven to be an especially useful func-
tionality to easily generate new reading materials
within the application with little time effort. Fur-
thermore, COAST features a novel crowd-sourcing
approach to overcome the pressing issue of limited
resources and data sparsity. This is particularly rel-
evant for languages other than English. Currently,
our tool illustrates this for the German language.
However, the entire framework was designed to be
easily extended for any other language for which

sufficient resources are available.
Our consultation with prospective users also

yielded a series of practical suggestions to opti-
mize user experience further and to include more
features. In particular, we aim at including the fea-
tures discussed in Section 4.1. We also plan to re-
design COAST’s visual appearance. Furthermore,
we intend to elaborate on the current documen-
tation and to provide application-oriented feature
tutorials. To improve the reliability of our proposed
crowd-sourcing mechanism, we plan to address the
verification of user roles, i.e. expert and regular
users. In this regard, the need of further user type
customization shall be analysed and implemented
accordingly. Finally, we intend to carry out user
studies to compare COAST’s efficiency and effi-
cacy to state of the art tools that support syllable
enhancement in texts.

Our ultimate goal is to develop and include a
front-end for learners, the COAST App. This results
in a tutoring system offering reading and spelling
exercises optimized for mobile devices. The cur-
rent COAST Tool could be used by practitioners to
generate teaching materials to be shared with the
COAST App and, thus, to supply exercises directly
to their pupils.

A Supplemental Material

A.1 Screenshots of COAST

Figure 5: COAST – View for text analysis and enhancement. Users can insert or edit text in the lower
text box. The preview of syllable enhancement is given in the upper box. On the left side, users can
edit settings regarding syllable annotation: boldness, colors of stressed and unstressed syllables (either
background or foreground), background color of words, font size, and spacing between syllables, words,
and lines.

Figure 6: COAST – Word-Popup. Popup with additional information that is invoked when a known word
is clicked in the text-view. At the moment, we offer information about syllabification, part of speech, and
lemma. Users can additionally manually change the syllabification or stress assignment of the selected
word and apply it to the preview.
