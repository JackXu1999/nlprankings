Abstract

We develop a novel cross-lingual word
representation model which injects syn-
tactic information through dependency-
based contexts into a shared cross-lingual
word vector space. The model, termed CL-
DEPEMB, is based on the following as-
sumptions: (1) dependency relations are
largely language-independent, at least for
related languages and prominent depen-
dency links such as direct objects, as ev-
idenced by the Universal Dependencies
project; (2) word translation equivalents
take similar grammatical roles in a sen-
tence and are therefore substitutable within
their syntactic contexts. Experiments with
several language pairs on word similarity
and bilingual lexicon induction, two fun-
damental semantic tasks emphasising se-
mantic similarity, suggest the usefulness of
the proposed syntactically informed cross-
lingual word vector spaces. Improvements
are observed in both tasks over standard
cross-lingual “offline mapping” baselines
trained using the same setup and an equal
level of bilingual supervision.

1 Introduction

In recent past, NLP as a field has seen tremendous
utility of distributed word representations (or word
embeddings, termed WEs henceforth) as features in
a variety of downstream tasks (Turian et al., 2010;
Collobert et al., 2011; Baroni et al., 2014; Chen
and Manning, 2014). The quality of these repre-
sentations may be further improved by leveraging
cross-lingual (CL) distributional information, as
evidenced by the recent body of work focused on
learning cross-lingual word embeddings (Klemen-
tiev et al., 2012; Zou et al., 2013; Hermann and

Blunsom, 2014; Gouws et al., 2015; Coulmance et
al., 2015; Duong et al., 2016, inter alia).1 The inclu-
sion of cross-lingual information results in a shared
cross-lingual word vector space (SCLVS), which
leads to improvements on monolingual tasks (typ-
ically word similarity) (Faruqui and Dyer, 2014;
Rastogi et al., 2015; Upadhyay et al., 2016), and
also supports cross-lingual tasks such as bilingual
lexicon induction (Mikolov et al., 2013a; Gouws et
al., 2015; Duong et al., 2016), cross-lingual infor-
mation retrieval (Vulić and Moens, 2015; Mitra et
al., 2016), entity linking (Tsai and Roth, 2016), and
cross-lingual knowledge transfer for resource-lean
languages (Søgaard et al., 2015; Guo et al., 2016).

Another line of work has demonstrated that
syntactically informed dependency-based (DEPS)
word vector spaces in monolingual settings (Lin,
1998; Padó and Lapata, 2007; Utt and Padó, 2014)
are able to capture finer-grained distinctions com-
pared to vector spaces based on standard bag-of-
words (BOW) contexts. Dependency-based vector
spaces steer the induced WEs towards functional
similarity (e.g., tiger:cat) rather than topical simi-
larity/relatedness (e.g., tiger:jungle), They support
a variety of similarity tasks in monolingual settings,
typically outperforming BOW contexts for English
(Bansal et al., 2014; Hill et al., 2015; Melamud et
al., 2016). However, despite the steadily growing
landscape of CL WE models, each requiring a dif-
ferent form of cross-lingual supervision to induce
a SCLVS, syntactic information is still typically
discarded in the SCLVS learning process.

To bridge this gap, in this work we develop a new
cross-lingual WE model, termed CL-DEPEMB,
which injects syntactic information into a SCLVS.
The model is supported by the recent initiatives
on language-agnostic annotations for universal lan-

bedding models, we refer the reader to two recent survey
papers (Upadhyay et al., 2016; Vulić and Korhonen, 2016b).

guage processing (i.e., universal POS (UPOS) tag-
ging and dependency (UD) parsing) (Nivre et al.,
2015). Relying on cross-linguistically consistent
UD-typed dependency links in two languages plus
a word translation dictionary, the model assumes
that one-to-one word translations are substitutable
within their syntactic contexts in both languages. It
constructs hybrid cross-lingual dependency trees
which could be used to extract monolingual and
cross-lingual dependency-based contexts (further
discussed in Sect. 2 and illustrated by Fig. 1).

In summary, our focused contribution is a new
syntactically informed cross-lingual WE model
which takes advantage of the normalisation pro-
vided by the Universal Dependencies project to
facilitate the syntactic mapping across languages.
We report results on two semantic tasks, monolin-
gual word similarity (WS) and bilingual lexicon
induction (BLI), which evaluate the monolingual
and cross-lingual quality of the induced SCLVS.
We observe consistent improvements over baseline
CL WE models which require the same level of
bilingual supervision (i.e., a word translation dic-
tionary). For this supervision setting, we show a
clear benefit of joint online training compared to
standard offline models which construct two sepa-
rate monolingual BOW-based or DEPS-based WE
spaces, and then map them into a SCLVS using
dictionary entries as done in (Mikolov et al., 2013a;
Dinu et al., 2015; Lazaridou et al., 2015; Vulić and
Korhonen, 2016b, inter alia)

2 Methodology
Representation Model In all experiments, we
opt for a standard and robust choice in vector
space modeling: skip-gram with negative sam-
pling (SGNS) (Mikolov et al., 2013b; Levy et al.,
2015). We use word2vecf, a reimplementation
of word2vec which is capable of learning from
arbitrary (word, context) pairs2, thus clearly em-
phasising the role of context in WE learning.

(Universal) Dependency-Based Contexts A
standard procedure to extract dependency-based
contexts (DEPS) (Padó and Lapata, 2007; Utt
and Padó, 2014) from monolingual data is as
follows. Given a parsed training corpus, for
each target w with modifiers m1, . . . ,mk and
a head h, w is paired with context elements

2https://bitbucket.org/yoavgo/word2vecf
For details concerning the implementation and learning, we
refer the interested reader to (Levy and Goldberg, 2014a)

m1 r1, . . . ,mk rk, h r
−1
h , where r is the type of

the dependency relation between the head and the
modifier (e.g., amod), and r−1 denotes an inverse
relation.3 When extracting DEPS, we adopt the
post-parsing prepositional arc collapsing procedure
(Levy and Goldberg, 2014a) (see Fig. 1a-1b).

Cross-Lingual DEPS: CL-DEPEMB First, a
UD-parsed monolingual training corpus is obtained
in both languages L1 and L2. The use of the inter-
lingual UD scheme enables linking dependency
trees in both languages (see the structural similar-
ity of the two sentences in English (EN) and Italian
(IT), Fig. 1a-1b). For instance, the link between EN
words Australian and scientist as well as IT words
australiano and scienzato is typed amod in both
trees. This link generates the following monolin-
gual EN DEPS: (scientist, Australian amod), (Aus-
tralian, scientist amod−1) (similar for IT).

Now, assume that we possess an EN-IT transla-
tion dictionary D with pairs [w1, w2] which con-
tains entries [Australian, australiano] and [scien-
tist, scienzato]. Given the observed similarity in the
sentence structure, and the fact that words from a
translation pair tend to take similar UPOS tags and
similar grammatical roles in a sentence, we can sub-
stitute w1 with w2 in all DEPS in which w1 partici-
pates (and vice versa, replace w2 with w1). Using
the substitution idea, besides the original monolin-
gual EN and IT DEPS contexts, we now generate
additional hybrid cross-lingual EN-IT DEPS con-
texts: (scientist, australiano amod), (australiano,
scientist amod−1), (scienzato, Australian amod),
(Australian, scienzato amod−1) (again, we can also
generate such hybrid IT-EN DEPS contexts).

CL-DEPEMB then trains jointly on such ex-
tended DEPS contexts containing both monolin-
gual and cross-lingual (word, context) dependency-
based pairs. With CL-DEPEMB, words are con-
sidered similar if they often co-occur with similar
words (and their translations) in the same depen-
dency relations in both languages. For instance,
words discovers and scopre might be considered
similar as they frequently co-occur as predicates for
the nominal subjects (nsubj) scientist and scien-
zato, and stars and stelle are their frequent direct
objects (dobj). An illustrative example of the core
idea behind CL-DEPEMB is provided in Fig. 1.

3Given an example from Fig. 1, the DEPS contexts of dis-
covers are: scientist nsubj, stars dobj, telescope nmod. Com-
pared to BOW, DEPS capture longer-range relations (e.g., tele-
scope) and filter out “accidental contexts” (e.g., Australian).

Figure 1: An example of extracting mono and CL DEPS contexts from UD parses in EN and IT assuming
two dictionary entries [scientist, scienzato], [stars, stelle]. (T1): the example EN sentence taken from
(Levy and Goldberg, 2014a), UD-parsed. (T2): the same sentence in IT, UD-parsed; Note the very similar
structure of the two parses and the use of prepositional arc collapsing (e.g., the typed link prep with). (T3):
the hybrid EN-IT dependency tree where the EN word scientist is replaced by its IT translation scienzato.
(T4): the hybrid IT-EN tree using the same translation pair. (T5) and (T6): the hybrid EN-IT and IT-EN
trees obtained using the lexicon entry (stars, stelle). While monolingual dependency-based representation
models use only monolingual trees T1 and T2 for training, our CL-DEPEMB model additionally trains on
the (parts of) hybrid trees T3-T6, combining monolingual (word, context) training examples with cross-
lingual training examples such as (discovers, stelle dobj) or (australiano, scientist amod−1). Although
the two sentences (T1 and T2) are direct translations of each other for illustration purposes, we stress that
the proposed CL-DEPEMB model does not assume the existence of parallel data nor requires it.

Offline Models vs CL-DEPEMB (Joint) CL-
DEPEMB uses a dictionary D as the bilingual sig-
nal to tie two languages into a SCLVS. A standard
CL WE learning scenario in this setup is as fol-
lows (Mikolov et al., 2013a; Vulić and Korhonen,
2016b): (1) two separate monolingual WE spaces
are induced using SGNS; (2) dictionary entries
from D are used to learn a mapping function mf
from the L1 space to the L2 space; (3) when mf
is applied to all L1 word vectors, the transformed
L1 space together with the L2 space is a SCLVS.
Monolingual WE spaces may be induced using dif-
ferent context types (e.g., BOW or DEPS). Since
the transformation is done after training, these mod-
els are typically termed offline CL WE models.

On the other hand, given a dictionary link
[w1, w2], between an L1 word w1 and an L2 word
w2, our CL-DEPEMB model performs an online
training: it uses the word w1 to predict syntactic
neighbours of the word w2 and vice versa. In fact,
we train a single SGNS model with a joint vocabu-
lary on two monolingual UD-parsed datasets with
additional cross-lingual dependency-based training
examples fused with standard monolingual DEPS
pairs. From another perspective, the CL-DEPEMB
model trains an extended dependency-based SGNS

model now composed of four joint SGNS models
between the following language pairs: L1 → L1,
L1 → L2, L2 → L1, L2 → L2 (see Fig. 1).4

3 Experimental Setup

We report results with two language pairs: English-
German/Italian (EN-DE/IT) due to the availability
of comprehensive test data for these pairs (Leviant
and Reichart, 2015; Vulić and Korhonen, 2016a).

Training Setup and Parameters For all lan-
guages, we use the Polyglot Wikipedia data (Al-
Rfou et al., 2013).5 as monolingual training data.
All corpora were UPOS-tagged and UD-parsed us-
ing the procedure of Vulić and Korhonen (2016a):
UD treebanks v1.4, TurboTagger for tagging (Mar-
tins et al., 2013), Mate Parser v3.61 with suggested
settings (Bohnet, 2010).6 The SGNS preprocessing
scheme is standard (Levy and Goldberg, 2014a):

4A similar idea of extended joint CL training was discussed
previously by (Luong et al., 2015; Coulmance et al., 2015).
In this work, we show that expensive parallel data and word
alignment links are not required to produce a SCLVS. Further,
instead of using BOW contexts, we demonstrate how to use
DEPS contexts for joint training in the CL settings.

0.852 (EN), 0.884 (IT), 0.802 (DE).

all tokens were lowercased, and words and contexts
that appeared less than 100 times were filtered out.7

We report results with d = 300-dimensional WEs,
as similar trends are observed with other d-s.

Implementation The code for generating mono-
lingual and cross-lingual dependency-based (word,
context) pairs for the word2vecf SGNS train-
ing using a bilingual dictionary D is available at:
https://github.com/cambridgeltl/
cl-depemb/.

Translation Dictionaries We report results with
a dictionary D labelled BNC+GT: a list of 6,318
most frequent EN lemmas in the BNC corpus (Kil-
garriff, 1997) translated to DE and IT using Google
Translate (GT), and subsequently cleaned by native
speakers. A similar setup was used by (Mikolov et
al., 2013a; Vulić and Korhonen, 2016b). We also
experiment with dict.cc, a freely available large
online dictionary (http://www.dict.cc/),
and find that the relative model rankings stay the
same in both evaluation tasks irrespective to the
chosen D.

Baseline Models CL-DEPEMB is compared
against two relevant offline models which also learn
using a seed dictionaryD: (1) OFF-BOW2 is a linear
mapping model from (Mikolov et al., 2013a; Dinu
et al., 2015; Vulić and Korhonen, 2016b) which
trains two SGNS models with the window size
2, a standard value (Levy and Goldberg, 2014a);
we also experiment with more informed positional
BOW contexts (Schütze, 1993; Levy and Goldberg,
2014b) (OFF-POSIT2); (2) OFF-DEPS trains two
DEPS-based monolingual WE spaces and linearly
maps them into a SCLVS. Note that OFF-DEPS uses
exactly the same information (i.e., UD-parsed cor-
pora plus dictionary D) as CL-DEPEMB.

4 Results and Discussion

Evaluation Tasks Following Luong et al. (2015)
and Duong et al. (2016), we argue that good cross-
lingual word representations should preserve both
monolingual and cross-lingual representation qual-
ity. Therefore, similar to (Duong et al., 2016; Upad-
hyay et al., 2016), we test cross-lingual WEs in two
core semantic tasks: monolingual word similarity
(WS) and bilingual lexicon induction (BLI).

7Exactly the same vocabularies were used with all mod-
els (∼ 185K distinct EN words, 163K DE words, and 83K
IT words). All word2vecf SGNS models were trained us-
ing standard settings: 15 epochs, 15 negative samples, global

we also report results on the verb translation sub-
task (numbers in square brackets).

Word Similarity Word similarity experiments
were conducted on the benchmarking multilin-
gual SimLex-999 evaluation set (Leviant and Re-
ichart, 2015) which provides monolingual similar-
ity scores for 999 word pairs in English, German,
and Italian.8 The results for the three languages are
displayed in Tab. 1.

These results suggest that CL-DEPEMB is the
best performing and most robust model in our com-
parison across all three languages, providing the
first insight that the online training with the ex-
tended set of DEPS pairs is indeed beneficial for
modeling true (functional) similarity.

We also carry out tests in English using another
word similarity metric: QVEC,9 which measures
how well the induced word vectors correlate with
a matrix of features from manually crafted lexical
resources and is better aligned with downstream
performance (Tsvetkov et al., 2015). The results are
again in favour of CL-DEPEMB with a QVEC score
of 0.540 (BNC+GT) and 0.543 (dict.cc), com-
pared to those of OFF-BOW2 (0.496), OFF-POSIT2
(0.510), and OFF-DEPS (0.528).

Bilingual Lexicon Induction BLI experiments
were conducted on several standard test sets: IT-

(decreasing) learning rate 0.025, subsampling rate 1e− 4.

Table 3: WS EN results on SimVerb-3500 (Spear-
man’s ρ correlation scores). BEST-BASELINE refers
to the best score across all baseline modeling
variants. We report results of CL-DEPEMB with
dict.cc after multilingual training with Italian
(+IT) and German (+DE).

EN was evaluated on VULIC1K (Vulić and Moens,
2013a), containing 1,000 IT nouns and their EN
translations, and DE-EN was evaluated on UP1328
(Upadhyay et al., 2016), containing 1,328 test pairs
of mixed POS tags. In addition, we evaluate both
language pairs on SimLex-999 word translations
(Leviant and Reichart, 2015), containing ∼ 1K test
pairs (SL-TRANS). We report results using a stan-
dard BLI metric: Top 1 scores. The same trends are
visible with Top 5 and Top 10 scores. All test word
pairs were removed from D for training.

The results are summarised in Tab. 2, indicat-
ing significant improvements with CL-DEPEMB
(McNemar’s test, p < 0.05). The gap between the
online CL-DEPEMB model and the offline base-
lines is now even more prominent,10 and there is a
huge difference in performance between OFF-DEPS
and CL-DEPEMB, two models using exactly the
same information for training.

Experiments on Verbs Following prior work,
e.g., (Bansal et al., 2014; Melamud et al., 2016;
Schwartz et al., 2016), we further show that WE
models which capture functional similarity are es-
pecially important for modelling particular “more
grammatical” word classes such as verbs and ad-
jectives. Therefore, in Tab. 1 and Tab. 2 we also
report results on verb similarity and translation.
The results indicate that injecting syntax into cross-
lingual word vector spaces leads to clear improve-
ments on modelling verbs in both evaluation tasks.

We further verify the intuition by running exper-
iments on another word similarity evaluation set,
which targets verb similarity in specific: SimVerb-
3500 (Gerz et al., 2016) contains similarity scores
for 3,500 verb pairs. The results of the CL-

10We also experimented with other language pairs repre-
sented in VULIC1K (Spanish/Dutch-English) and UP1328
(French/Swedish-English). The results also show similar im-
provements with CL-DEPEMB, not reported for brevity.

DEPEMB on SimVerb-3500 with dict.cc are
provided in Tab. 3, further indicating the usefulness
of syntactic information in multilingual settings for
improved verb representations.

Similar trends are observed with adjectives: e.g.,
CL-DEPEMB with dict.cc obtains a ρ correla-
tion score of 0.585 on the adjective subset of DE
SimLex while the best baseline score is 0.417; for
IT these scores are 0.334 vs. 0.266.

5 Conclusion and Future Work

We have presented a new cross-lingual word em-
bedding model which injects syntactic information
into a cross-lingual word vector space, resulting
in improved modeling of functional similarity, as
evidenced by improvements on word similarity and
bilingual lexicon induction tasks for several lan-
guage pairs. More sophisticated approaches involv-
ing the use of more accurate dependency parsers
applicable across different languages (Ammar et
al., 2016), selection and filtering of reliable dic-
tionary entries (Peirsman and Padó, 2010; Vulić
and Moens, 2013b; Vulić and Korhonen, 2016b),
and more sophisticated approaches to constructing
hybrid cross-lingual dependency trees (Fig. 1) may
lead to further advances in future work. Other cross-
lingual semantic tasks such as lexical entailment
(Mehdad et al., 2011; Vyas and Carpuat, 2016) or
lexical substitution (Mihalcea et al., 2010) may also
benefit from syntactically informed cross-lingual
representations. We also plan to test the portability
of the proposed framework, relying on the abstrac-
tive assumption of language-universal dependency
structures, to more language pairs, including the
ones outside the Indo-European language family.
