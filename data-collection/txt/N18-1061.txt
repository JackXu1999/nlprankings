Abstract

Temporal orientation refers to an individual’s
tendency to connect to the psychological con-
cepts of past, present or future, and it af-
fects personality, motivation, emotion, de-
cision making and stress coping processes.
The study of the social media users’ psycho-
demographic attributes from the perspective of
human temporal orientation can be of utmost
interest and importance to the business and
administrative decision makers as it can pro-
vide an extra precious information for them to
make informed decisions. In this paper, we
propose a very first study to demonstrate the
association between the sentiment view of the
temporal orientation of the users and their dif-
ferent psycho-demographic attributes by an-
alyzing their tweets. We first create a tem-
poral orientation classifier in a minimally su-
pervised way which classifies each tweet of
the users in one of the three temporal cate-
gories, namely past, present, and future. A
deep Bi-directional Long Short Term Memory
(BLSTM) is used for the tweet classification
task. Our tweet classifier achieves an accuracy
of 78.27% when tested on a manually created
test set. We then determine the users’ overall
temporal orientation based on their tweets on
the social media. The sentiment is added to
the tweets at the fine-grained level where each
temporal tweet is given a sentiment with either
of the positive, negative or neutral. Our exper-
iment reveals that depending upon the senti-
ment view of temporal orientation, a user’s at-
tributes vary. We finally measure the correla-
tion between the users’ sentiment view of tem-
poral orientation and their different psycho-
demographic factors using regression.

1 Introduction

The rapid growth of social media data in recent
years has encouraged different studies which only
existed at the psychological level (theory or pure

logic). Various attributes of users can be analyzed
from the texts they write on the social media plat-
form. The studies include age, gender prediction
(Marquardt et al., 2014; Sap et al., 2014), psy-
chological well being (Dodds et al., 2011; Choud-
hury et al., 2013), and a host of other behavioural,
psychological and medical phenomena (Kosinski
et al., 2013). However, a few works exist which
analyze these factors using socio-economic char-
acteristics of the Twitter users.

Time is generally defined by a dimension where
the events are ordered from the past through the
present into the future which includes duration and
intervals. Major studies on time have been done
for event detection (Ihler et al., 2006; Batal et al.,
2012; Sakaki et al., 2013) which are mainly of the
subjective consent. In contrast, temporal orien-
tation of a user is defined by his/her tendency to
emphasize past, present or future (Zimbardo and
Boyd, 2015) which gives more objective consent
of time. The growth of social media content has
enabled us to study this objective consent more
precisely.

Past studies have established a consistent link
between the temporal orientation and several user
characteristics such as age, gender, education, and
psychological traits (Webley and Nyhus, 2006;
Adams and Nettle, 2009; Schwartz et al., 2013;
Zimbardo and Boyd, 2015). However, the senti-
ment dimension (positive, negative or neutral) of
the temporal orientation is merely studied at the
empirical level on a large-scale. For example, peo-
ple who are optimistic are future-oriented and pos-
itive at the same time. So, only defining the tempo-
ral orientation cannot specify the optimistic peo-
ple correctly. We need the sentiment dimension as
well to find the exact correlation.

In this paper, we first develop a temporal-
orientation classifier to classify tweets into past,
present, and future and then group over the users

to create user-level assessments. We use a Bidi-
rectional Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM)
network for tweet temporal classification where
tweet vectors are fed to generate the classifica-
tion model. We propose a hash tag-based mini-
mally supervised method with the two-pass filter-
ing to create the past, present and future-oriented
tweets for the training of the Bi-LSTM network.
We manually examined trending hashtags in Twit-
ter for a specific period of time and selected hash-
tags which represent past, present/ongoing, or fu-
ture events. The English tweets containing one
of the selected hashtags are crawled using Twit-
ter streaming API.1 The tweet temporal orienta-
tion classifier is validated on a manually annotated
test set. Finally, we use this classifier to automat-
ically classify a large dataset consisting of ≈10
million tweets from 5,191 users mapped to their
user-level features.

Besides these three temporal categories (past,
present or future), we have considered the posi-
tive, negative and neutral sentiments of the tweets
for the fine-grained classification. The user-level
tweets with a particular temporal orientation is fur-
ther subdivided into either positive, negative or
neutral sentiment. Finally, we evaluated whether
the sentiment view of temporal orientation (i.e.
past-positive, past-negative, past-neutral, present-
positive, present-negative, present-neutral, future-
positive, future-negative, and future-neutral) of
the users is related to their several psycho-
demographic attributes. In this research, we have
considered five psycho-demographic attributes,
namely age, eduction, relationship, intelligence,
and optimism.

Our contributions are summarised as below:

• We introduce the sentiment dimensions in the
human temporal orientation to infer the social
media users’ psycho-demographic attributes
on a large-scale.

• We propose a minimally supervised approach
to the temporal orientation classification task
that leverages large quantities of unlabeled
data and requires no hand-annotated training
corpora. The empirical evidence shows that
the method performs reasonably well.

• We create a gold-standard temporal orienta-
tion tweet corpus.

• We define a way to find a novel associ-
ation between the sentiment view of tem-
poral orientation and the different psycho-
demographic factors of the tweet users.

2 Related Background

The temporal study has recently received an in-
creased attention in several application domains of
Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Informa-
tion Retrieval (IR). The introduction of the Tem-
pEval task (Verhagen et al., 2009) and the sub-
sequent challenges i.e. TempEval-2 and -3 (Ver-
hagen et al., 2010; UzZaman et al., 2013) in the
Semantic Evaluation workshop series have clearly
established the importance of time in dealing with
the different NLP tasks. Alonso et al. (2011) re-
viewed the current research trends and presented a
number of interesting applications along with the
open problems.

The shared task like the NTCIR-11 Temporalia
task (Joho et al., 2014) further pushed this idea and
proposed to distinguish whether a given query is
related to past, recency, future or atemporal. It is
the first such challenge, which is organized to pro-
vide a common platform for designing and analyz-
ing the time-aware information access systems. In
parallel, new trends have emerged in the context of
the human temporal orientation (Schwartz et al.,
2013; Sap et al., 2014; Park et al., 2015; Schwartz
et al., 2015; Park et al., 2017). The underlying
idea is to understand how the past, present, and
future emphasis in the text may affect people’s fi-
nances, health, and happiness. For that purpose,
the temporal classifiers are built to detect the over-
all temporal dimension of a given sentence. For
instance, the following sentence “can’t wait to get
a pint tonight” would be tagged as future.

In summary, most of the temporal text pro-
cessing applications have been mainly relying on
the rule-based time taggers, for e.g. HeidelTime
(Strötgen and Gertz, 2015) or SUTime (Chang and
Manning, 2012) to identify and normalize time
mentions in the texts. Although interesting results
have been reported (UzZaman et al., 2013), but the
coverage is limited to the finite number of rules
they implement.

The time perspective and its importance in var-
ious social science and psychological studies is
well established in literature. It plays a funda-
mental role in our interpersonal relation influenced
by cognitive process (Zimbardo and Boyd, 2015).

664



This is also useful in forming goals, expectations
and imaginations. Time perspective is a funda-
mental process, which intern, influenced by many
user attributes such as age, religion, education etc.
In their research, Zimbardo and Boyd (2015) have
shown that the negative view of the past is related
to depression, anxiety, unhappiness, and low self-
esteem but the positive view of the past is related
to self-esteem and happiness. The hedonistic view
of the present is related to novelty seeking and sen-
sation seeking whereas the fatalistic view of the
present is related to aggression, anxiety and de-
pression. The future is related to conscientious-
ness but negatively correlated with depression and
anxiety.

Another research suggests that the satisfaction
with life of the older adults depends on their pos-
itive views of past (Kazakina, 1999). In their re-
search, Drake et al. (2008) described that the past-
positive is positively correlated to happiness. The
link between the past-negative and many psycho-
logical distress like depression and anxiety has
been well established in literature (Cully et al.,
2001). A focus on the future is very effective for
functioning positively. The future orientation also
helps in better health in later life (Kahana et al.,
2005). In a research, George (2009) evaluated
that subjective well-being, happiness, psychologi-
cal well-being, positive effects and morale refer to
the positive orientation towards life.

Past research has established that the time per-
spective is an important factor to determine the hu-
man emotional intelligence (Stolarski et al., 2011).
In our work, we measure the relationship with
different level of intelligence and the sentiment
view of the temporal orientation by more objec-
tive consent of the time perspective, i.e. tempo-
ral orientation from the tweets on the social me-
dia. In a social science research, Guthrie et al.
(2009) have shown that the future time perspec-
tive is associated with the current socioeconomic
status, and the past-fatalistic time perspective is
associated with the both current and childhood so-
cioeconomic status.

Although these kinds of research exist exten-
sively in the psychological study, it is not well ex-
plored with the empirical study using more objec-
tive consent of the time perspective, i.e the tempo-
ral orientation. As per our best knowledge, only a
very few studies exist that focus on the temporal
orientation where only the coarse-grained classes

have been considered (Schwartz et al., 2015; Park
et al., 2017). In these researches, many user at-
tributes were correlated with the temporal orien-
tation which include conscientiousness, age, gen-
der, openness, extraversion, agreeableness, neu-
roticism, satisfaction with life, depression, IQ,
number of friends etc. In our work, we incorpo-
rated fine-grained temporal orientation and found
the correlation with the users’ age, education, re-
lationship, intelligence, and optimism. The fine-
grained study of the temporal orientation only ex-
isted at the theoretical level validated with very
limited user dataset. Besides validating these find-
ings in the empirical way for the large number of
users, we also discuss some previously unexplored
relationships.

3 Methodology

We first create a deep temporal-orientation clas-
sifier to capture the temporal orientation (past,
present and future) of the users’ tweets. Thereafter
we further classify the users’ tweets at the fine-
grained level by associating sentiment, i.e. pos-
itive, negative or neutral for each temporal cate-
gory. We compare our temporal-orientation clas-
sifier with an existing state-of-the-art method.

3.1 Temporal Orientation Classification

The temporal orientation of tweets is defined by
classifying each tweet T in one of the temporal
categories t, where t ∈ { past, present, or fu-
ture}. Given the following tweet “Let me change
lanes and turn left legally”, the temporal orienta-
tion classifier should predict it as an instance of
future orientation. At first we create a temporal
oriented tweet dataset in a minimally supervised
way by exploiting the hashtag information. Deep
Bi-LSTM network is then trained on this dataset.
We use LSTM networks (Hochreiter and Schmid-
huber, 1997) as these are well known for capturing
the long-term dependencies within the text.

Many times we fail to capture the temporal ori-
entation of a text using just the tense information
or the existing temporal keywords. In particu-
lar, the tweet “Today I have a plan for a meet-
ing at night.” is future-oriented. Here, the tempo-
ral keyword ‘Today’ has a time sense of present
whereas the tense of the verb is also present.
The deep learning networks have been very use-
ful to correctly capture the temporal dimension of
these kinds of tweets. Although the basic Artifi-

665



cial Neural Networks (ANNs) (Schalkoff, 1997)
and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) (Le-
Cun et al., 1995) capture the temporal orienta-
tion of many tweets correctly, they fail to properly
identify where the validating temporal information
in the tweet has a long dependency between them.
For example, the tweet “Working in the same unit
today with different staff was much better.” has
temporal orientation as past. Here, the word which
has a temporal sense (i.e. working, today, was) are
placed at a distance from each other. This moti-
vates us to use the LSTM network.

Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory Net-
works (Bi-LSTM): LSTMs are a special kind of
recurrent neural network (RNN) capable of learn-
ing long-term dependencies in the text by effec-
tively handling the vanishing or exploding gradi-
ent problem. The Bidirectional LSTMs (Schuster
and Paliwal, 1997) train two LSTMs, instead of
one, on the input sequence. The first on the in-
put sequence and the second on a reversed copy of
the input sequence. It is designed to capture in-
formation of the sequential dataset and maintain
the contextual features from the past and the fu-
ture. This can provide an additional context to the
network and result in faster and even fuller learn-
ing on the problem without keeping the redundant
context information.

Figure 1: Temporal Orientation learning architecture.

The previous study on the temporal orientation
classification based on machine learning includes
a supervised classification based on the manu-
ally created training set (Schwartz et al., 2015).
The multi-class classification was based on a one
vs rest approach. But adapting the multiple bi-
nary classifiers is not always the best way to deal

with a multi-class classification problem. It re-
quires building of three independent classifiers for
each temporal category, which consumes more
time. Unlike this approach, we incorporate a deep
learning-based multi-class classification method
for the temporal orientation. The training corpus
is generated in a minimally supervised way and
fitted to the Bi-LSTM network.

Our experiment uses Bi-LSTM with 200 neu-
rons at the input layer. The loss function we
used is categorical cross-entropy and the opti-
mizer used is Root Mean Square Propagation (rm-
sprop). We repeat the training for 100 number
of epochs with batch size set to 128. We also
employ dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014) for reg-
ularization with a dropout rate of 0.2 to prevent
over-fitting. All of these attributes are finalized by
parameter tuning with the performance obtained
on 10-fold cross-validation using the grid search
method. Tweet vectors are generated by existing
Glove vectors (Pennington et al., 2014) for tweets2

of 200 dimensions which are trained on 27 billion
tweets. We also validate our model on the valida-
tion set which was 10% of the training set.

3.2 Sentiment View of Temporal Orientation

We use an existing sentiment classifier available
with the NLTK toolkit (Bird, 2006) to classify the
user-level tweets into positive, negative or neu-
tral.3 Sentiment is added at the fine-grained level
of the temporal orientation. Given the tweets of a
user, the sentiment view of temporal orientation of
that user is defined by the following equation:

orientations,t(user) =
|tweetss/t(user)|
|tweetst(user)|

(1)

where, (t ∈ { past, present, or future}), and (s ∈
{ positive, negative, or neutral}), in equation (1).
Here, we first classify each user’s tweet into the
past, present or future temporal category. Then for
each temporal category, we find the percentage of
each sentiment class (i.e positive, negative or neu-
tral) to obtain the sentiment view of temporal ori-
entation.

We measure the correlation between a user’s
sentiment view of temporal orientation with their

age, education, intelligence, optimism, and rela-
tionship using a linear regression (LR) classifier
(Neter et al., 1996).

4 Data Sets

For experiments we categorize the datasets into
three kinds: training, test and user-level. Train-
ing set consists of 27k tweets, whereas the test set
is manually annotated with 741 tweets.4 The user-
level tweets consist of ≈10 million tweets from
5,191 users mapped to their user-level features.

4.1 Training Set

Training tweets are collected using the Twitter
streaming API.5 The tweets are collected for the
duration of September 2017 and October 2017.
We consider day-wise trending topics during this
period.6 We only consider those hashtags which
signify a temporal event. Finally, we chose world-
wide trending events and collected the tweets
based on the hashtags.

The collection of the temporal tweets are based
on the following three hypotheses: (a) if a trend-
ing topic is of a future event then mostly people
would write the futuristic tweets; (b) if a trend-
ing topic is about a past incident, then the peo-
ple would write more about the past but they also
write about the present effects of that event; (c) the
tweets of trending present event are most critical
to handle as besides writing about the present in-
cidents, people always join the links with the past
incidents and also give opinion about the future ef-
fects.

The task was challenging as the tweets contain
a lot of noises and people use various ways to re-
fer to the past, the present and the future. To deal
with the pitfalls described in the hypotheses, we
filter the tweets using a two-pass filtering method.
The method is based on two assumptions (a) ev-
ery meaningful sentence should contain a verb. (b)
mostly past-oriented tweets have tense of the verb
as past.

The first assumption is well-established in lit-
erature, whereas the second assumption is based
on our observation on the tweets and validation
against a tense-based classifier. In the first pass of

6The reason for this selection strategy was the fact that

during the passage of time, the future events become present
event and the present event becomes past event.

the filtering method, we filter out the tweets which
do not contain a verb. The verb part-of-speech tag
is determined using the CMU tweet-tagger (Gim-
pel et al., 2011). In the second pass of the filter-
ing method, we removed the tweets having tense
as past from the tweets of the present and future
events.

The CMU tweet-tagger does not provide verbs
in different sub-categories. For this reason, we
also retrieve the Part-of-Speech (PoS) tag infor-
mation from the Standford PoS-tagger (Manning
et al., 2014) for all the tweets to get the sub-
categories of verb (i.e. VB, VBD, VBG, VBN,
VBP, VBZ). We observed that although Stand-
ford PoS-tagger assigned the required verb sub-
categories, it also incorrectly tagged some non-
verbs as verbs. This is the reason why we consid-
ered only those verbs for sub-categorization which
were identified (as verbs) by the CMU tweet-
tagger.

We varied the training set starting from 3K
(equally distributed) to 30K and observed that the
accuracy on the gold standard test set did not im-
prove after 27K training instances. Few example
tweets with the trending topics are depicted in Ta-
ble 1.

4.2 Test Set

We evaluate our temporal-orientation classifier on
a manually created test set. To get proper assess-
ment on the user-level test set, we randomly se-
lected 800 tweets from the user-level test tweets.
Three annotators (post-graduate level students)
were asked to tag the tweets in one of the four
available classes, namely past, present, future and
other. The annotation guidelines were as follows:

• Tag a tweet as past if it talks about an event
which has started as well as ended or the un-
derlaying temporal connotation of the tweet
refers to the past time.

• Tag a tweet as present if it talks about an
event which started but not ended yet or the
tweet has a present temporal connotation,

• Tag a tweet as future if it talks about an event
which is yet to happen.

• Tag a tweet as other in case they found it
difficult to get the exact temporal tag for the
tweets.

Table 1: Example tweets for different temporal orientation categories with trending topics.

We measured the multi-rater kappa agreement
(Fleiss, 1971) among the annotators and it was
found to have a substantial kappa value of 0.82.
The higher kappa value indicates that associat-
ing text with temporal dimensions, namely, past,
present, future, and other is relatively straightfor-
ward task for humans by using world knowledge
than words (Dias et al., 2014). Moreover, our
inter-annotator agreement value is in line with the
literature.7 Finally, we select the temporal class
of a tweet based on the majority voting among the
annotators. The distribution of annotated tweets is
as follows:

• Past- 375 Tweets

• Present- 164 Tweets

• Future- 202 Tweets

• Other- 59 Tweets

We removed tweets tagged as Other and used 741
tweets as the test set.8

4.3 User-level Test Set

The user-level tweets consist of ≈10 million
tweets from 5,191 users mapped to their user-
level psycho-demographic features developed by
Preoţiuc-Pietro et al. (2015) are used for this cur-
rent work. In particular, we use five psycho-
demographic attributes such as age, education, in-
telligence, optimism, and relationship for our ex-
periment. The users’ psycho-demographic fea-
tures are automatically deduced based on the
users’ published texts. Preoţiuc-Pietro et al.
(2015) used a predictive model to automatically
infer user-level features. The method uses vari-
ous user properties (annotated using crowdsourc-

ing) including age, gender, income, education, re-
lationship status, optimism and life satisfaction as
well as all the tweets published by a user to infer
user-level features.

5 Experimental Results

We first evaluate our temporal orientation classi-
fier which measures the orientation of each tweet
as either of past, present or future. The classifier
was trained on the training set and evaluated on
the test set. We obtain the highest accuracy of
78.27% over 741 test samples. For comparative
evaluation, we can consider a strong baseline sys-
tem proposed by Schwartz et al. (2015). The base-
line system was built following a supervised learn-
ing strategy over different features such as ngrams,
time expression, PoS tags, tweet length, and tem-
poral class-specific lexicons. The system achieved
an accuracy of 71.8% when tested over 500 man-
ually annotated data. The baseline was not re-
producible as both the training and test set were
manually tagged and the datasets were not avail-
able.9 The baseline model was constructed using
the manually annotated data, creation of which in-
volved considerable efforts and expenses. In con-
trast, we follow a minimally supervised method
(does not incur any manual effort) to create our
own datasets which are of acceptable quality. We
show the results in Table 2.

the data. They did not share the data due to copyright issues.
This is the reason for generating our own gold-standard test
set.

Results in Table 2 show that the past class is
the most correctly classified followed by the fu-
ture and the present. We observe low recall for
the present class as many present tweets were
mis-classified into either past or present class.
The confusion matrix is shown in Figure 2. The

classification.

present class is mis-classified into future when the
tweet is of the declarative type. For example, the
tweet “Its not a casserole as theres no binding ma-
trix” has present orientation but our classifier clas-
sifies it as of future orientation. Another reason
could be the fact that the words in the sentence rep-
resenting present temporal orientation are not in
the correct form (Its, theres). The present classes
are mis-classified into the past classes in those
cases where mainly the existence of the tense of
a verb is past but actually the tweet has present
orientation. For example, the tweet “For me gloves
and mitts made for Cross Country skiing work well
for ventilated warmth” is mis-classified into past
because of the existence of the word (made) which
has tense as past. The tweets with future orien-
tation are mostly mis-classified into past orienta-
tion. These kinds of mis-classification is due to
either for the presence of past tense or the tweet
is a compound sentence which has an independent
clause of the past orientation. For example, the
tweet “Hoping to have fun among my friends but
wishing I were with you instead” has a future ori-
entation but it is mis-classified into the past orien-
tation.

We measure the potential limitations of the
NLTK sentiment classifier on 100 randomly se-
lected tweets from the test set. The manual ob-

servation shows that the classifier generally mis-
classifies where the sentiment of the tweet is not
well understood (example: “Big Trucks parked all
over). In some cases, the tweets having conflict
sentiment are mis-classified in either of positive or
negative class. For example, the tweet “I am very
sorry that is a working weekend for me but thank-
ing you very much for the invitation has a conflict
sentiment but the classifier classified it into an in-
stance of negative sentiment.

We measure the predictive power of the senti-
ment view of temporal orientation by performing
regression on different psycho-demographic fac-
tors. The correlation results between the users’
sentiment view of temporal orientation and their
psycho-demographic factors using linear regres-
sion are presented in Table 3 and Table 4. The
performance is measured using a standard met-
ric, namely Pearson’s correlation coefficient r be-
tween the inferred and the target values. All
the results in Table 3 and Table 4 are statisti-
cally significant when tested against null hypothe-
sis (p value <0.05).

6 Discussion and Findings

We measure the correlation between the Twitter
users’ psycho-demographic features and their sen-
timent view of temporal orientation. In this sec-
tion, all the discussions and analyses are based on
the correlation results over the user test set.

6.1 Demographic Correlates

We select ‘age’, ‘education’ and ‘relationship’ as
demographic features for this study. The correla-
tion coefficients between the users’ demographic
attributes and their sentiment view of temporal ori-
entation are shown in Table 3.

Results in Table 3 demonstrate that any
user’s past-orientation is significantly correlated
(0.4677) with their age. In other words, it sug-
gests that when people age they think more about
the past than the present and future. To the best
of our knowledge, psychology literature (Nurmi,
2005; Steinberg et al., 2009) has not established
the correlation of the past orientation with age.
Our finding is consistent with a recent compu-
tational study on the human temporal orienta-
tion (Schwartz et al., 2015) which shows positive
correlation between age and the past orientation.
However, we also observed that the users’ age has
the highest positive correlation (0.5235) with the

future-positive. It indicates that people become
positively future-orientated when they age, though
not surprising, yet somewhat novel. The results
indicate that only considering the temporal ori-
entation without the sentiment dimensions can be
sometimes misleading as we can observe that the
negative future-orientation has a negative correla-
tion (-0.4547) with age while the future-positive
has a positive correlation with age.

Figure 3 explains how the trends of the senti-
ment view of temporal orientation varies from age
10 to 60. We observe that for all the temporal
classes, the positive sentiment increases rapidly
with the increase of age. Most interestingly, for
all the temporal orientation people become neg-
ative up to the age of 28 and then their negative
sentiment steadily reduces. We also observe that
human’s neutral sentiment rapidly decreases up to
the age of 27 and then it decreases steadily.

The second demographic attribute we consid-
ered is ‘education’. We measure the correla-
tion between the temporal orientation and three
different levels of education: degree, gradu-
ate degree, and high school. In the psycholog-
ical literature (Horstmanshof and Zimitat, 2007;
Richardson et al., 2012), it was reviewed that
the students’ temporal orientations is a new di-
mension to approaches in enhancing student en-
gagement in the academics. It was found that
the first year students of university were more
future-oriented rather than present or past ori-
ented. From our results in Table 3, we found
that the users who have education of degree level
are present-oriented. But interestingly they nei-

orientation of the users over their age. Smoothing

positive, neg-negative, neu-neutral.

ther think positively nor negatively-they express
more neutral sentiment. Users with education of
graduate degree are found to be future-oriented.
Here, the fine-grained classification suggests that
they also express the neutral sentiment. Interest-
ingly, we found that the users with education of
high school had positive correlation with past ori-
entation. However, when we considered the sen-
timent dimension, we found that it was actually
correlated with present orientation with negative
sentiment.

Our third and final demographic feature ‘rela-
tionship’ is categorized into four types in our cur-
rent study: divorced, in a relationship, married,
and single. From the results in Table 3, we observe
that the users who are divorced found to be more
future oriented and they seem to express the neu-

670



tral sentiment. The in a relationship users seem
to be more past-oriented. They also found to be
negative minded. Married people are found to be
present oriented while expressing the neutral sen-
timent. The users who are single, are generally
futuristic but they are negative about it.

6.2 Psychological Correlates

We chose two psychological factors, intelligence
and optimism. The correlation coefficient results
are shown in Table 4.

The intelligence level of the users was
measured in three sub-categories: intelli-
gence:below average, intelligence:average and
intelligence:much above. Some novel findings
have been observed through our results. We
found a modest yet significant positive correlation
between intelligence below average and negative
view of the present orientation. It suggests that
the users having intelligence below average are
present oriented but they seem to have negative
view of it. Surprisingly, we found that average
intelligent users are past-oriented but considering
the sentiment dimension they seem to be more
future-positive. However, this should be validated
with further investigation. We found that the
users who have intelligence much above are
more future orientated. Interestingly, we found
a negative correlation with the future-positive.
However, we found a positive correlation (0.3614)
with the future-neutral which suggests that the
users with much above intelligence are futuristic
and they express a neutral view.

We chose three categories of optimism: opti-
mistic, pessimistic, and neither for our observa-
tion. The result shown in Table 4 suggests that the
optimistic people are future oriented. They also
seem to have positive sentiment. Although the
link between the future orientation and optimism
is well established in literature (Lennings, 2000;
Busseri et al., 2013), there is no empirical study
for a large number of users. We find a relatively
higher positive correlation between the pessimist
and the present-negative which suggests that the
pessimistic people are negative minded and focus
more on present. People who are neither opti-
mistic nor pessimistic are found to be future ori-
ented with the neutral sentiment which is also a
novel finding.

7 Conclusion and Future Work

This paper presents a first large-scale study to
associate the psycho-demographic profile of the
Twitter users with their sentiment view of tempo-
ral orientation based on language they use in Twit-
ter. We first detect the temporal orientation of the
tweets using the Bi-LSTM based temporal orien-
tation classifier. We generated the temporal cat-
egories of our training set in a minimally super-
vised way. We created a benchmark dataset for
the evaluation of our temporal orientation classi-
fier. The temporal orientation classifier achieved
an accuracy of 78.27% when run on the manu-
ally tagged test data. We added the sentiment di-
mension at the fine-grained level of the temporal
orientation. The associations between the users’
sentiment view of temporal orientation and their
different psycho-demographic attributes (age, ed-
ucation, intelligence, optimism, and relationship)
are somewhat novel in the context of the com-
putational social science studies. Whereas the
study on the temporal orientation concentrated on
a coarse-grained level, we focused on the fine-
grained level of temporal orientation which opens
more aspects of the social, economic, and psycho-
logical research which was not possible previously
on a large scale.

Acknowledging the possible limitations of this
study including the quality of the sentiment clas-
sifier and a low recall of the present temporal ori-
entation, in future, we will consider more sophis-
ticated sentiment classifier for better performance
and explore more linguistic insight into consider-
ation to improve the performance of the temporal
orientation classifier. We also like to extend our
work with the link to more behavioral study and
analysis.
