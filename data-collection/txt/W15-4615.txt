Abstract

Dialogue topic tracking aims at analyz-
ing and maintaining topic transitions in
on-going dialogues. This paper proposes
to utilize Wikification-based features for
providing mention-level correspondences
to Wikipedia concepts for dialogue topic
tracking. The experimental results show
that our proposed features can signifi-
cantly improve the performances of the
task in mixed-initiative human-human
dialogues.

1 Introduction

Dialogue topic tracking aims at detecting topic
transitions and predicting topic categories in on-
going dialogues which address more than a single
topic. Since human communications in real-world
situations tend to consist of a series of multiple
topics even for a single domain, tracking dialogue
topics plays a key role in analyzing human-human
dialogues as well as improving the naturalness of
human-machine interactions by conducting multi-
topic conversations.

Some researchers (Nakata et al., 2002; Lagus
and Kuusisto, 2002; Adams and Martell, 2008) at-
tempted to solve this problem with text categoriza-
tion approaches for the utterances in a given turn.
However, these approaches can only be effective
for the cases when users mention the topic-related
expressions explicitly in their utterances, because
the models for text categorization assume that the
proper category for each textual unit can be as-
signed based only on its own contents.

The other direction of dialogue topic tracking
made use of external knowledge sources including
domain models (Roy and Subramaniam, 2006),
heuristics (Young et al., 2007), and agendas (Bo-
hus and Rudnicky, 2003; Lee et al., 2008). While

these knowledge-based methods have an advan-
tage of dealing with system-initiative dialogues
by controlling dialogue flows based on given re-
sources, they have drawbacks in low flexibility
to handle the user’s responses and high costs for
building the resources.

Recently, we have proposed to explore domain
knowledge from Wikipedia for mixed-initiative di-
alogue topic tracking without significant costs for
building resources (Kim et al., 2014a; Kim et al.,
2014b). In these methods, a set of articles that
have similar contents to a given dialogue segment
are selected using vector space model. Then vari-
ous types of information obtained from the articles
are utilized to learn topic trackers based on kernel
methods.

In this work, we focus on the following limi-
tations of our former work in retrieving relevant
concepts at a given turn with the term vector sim-
ilarity between each pair of dialogue segment and
Wikipedia article. Firstly, the contents of conver-
sation could be expressed in totally different ways
from the descriptions in the actual relevant articles
in Wikipedia. This mismatch between spoken dia-
logues and written encyclopedia could bring about
inaccuracy in selecting proper Wikipedia articles
as sources for domain knowledge. Secondly, a set
of articles that are selected by comparing with a
whole dialogue segment can be limited to reflect
the multiple relevances if more than one concept
are actually mentioned in the segment. Lastly,
lack of semantic or discourse aspects in concept
retrieval could cause a limited capability of the
tracker to deal with implicitly mentioned subjects.

To solve these issues, we propose to incorpo-
rate Wikification (Mihalcea and Csomai, 2007)
features for building dialogue topic trackers. The
goal of Wikification is resolving ambiguities and
variabilities of every mention in natural language
by linking the expression to its relevant Wikipedia
concept. Since this task is performed using not

only surface form features, but also various types
of semantic and discourse aspects obtained from
both given texts and Wikipedia collection, our pro-
posed method utilizing the results from Wikifica-
tion contributes to improve the tracking perfor-
mances compared to the former approaches based
on dialogue segment-level correspondences.

2 Dialogue Topic Tracking

Dialogue topic tracking can be defined as a classi-
fication problem to detect where topic transitions
occur and what the topic category follows after
each transition. The most probable pair of topics
at just before and after each turn is predicted by
the following classifier:

f(xt) = (yt−1, yt),

where xt contains the input features obtained at a
turn t, yt ∈ C, and C is a closed set of topic cate-
gories. If a topic transition occurs at t, yt should be
different from yt−1. Otherwise, both yt and yt−1
have the same value.

Figure 1 shows an example of dialogue topic
tracking in a given dialogue fragment on Singa-
pore tour guide domain between a tourist and a
guide. This conversation is divided into four seg-
ments, since f detects three topic transitions at t1,
t4 and t6. The mixed-initiative aspects are also
shown in this dialogue, because the first two tran-
sitions are initiated by the tourist, while the other
one is driven by the guide without any explicit re-
quirement from the tourist. From these results,
we could obtain a topic sequence of ‘Attraction’,
‘Transportation’, and ‘Food’.

3 Wikification of Concept Mentions in
Spoken Dialogues

Wikification aims at linking mentions to the rele-
vant entries in Wikipedia. As shown in the exam-
ples in Figure 2 for the dialogue in Figure 1, this
task is performed by dealing with co-references,
ambiguities, and variabilities of the mentions.

Following most previous work on Wikifica-
tion (Bunescu and Pasca, 2006; Mihalcea and Cso-
mai, 2007; Milne and Witten, 2008; Dredze et al.,
2010; Han and Sun, 2011; Chen and Ji, 2011), this
work also takes a supervised learning to rank al-
gorithm for determining the most relevant concept
for each mention in transcribed utterances.

In this work, every noun phrase in a given di-
alogue session is defined as a single mention. To
capture more abstract concepts, we take not only
named entities or base noun phrases, but also ev-
ery complex or recursive noun phrase in a dialogue
as the instance to be linked. For each mention,
a set of candidates are retrieved from a Lucene 1

index on the whole Wikipedia collection divided
by section-level. The ranking score s(m, c) for a
given pair of a mention m and its candidate con-
cept c is assigned as follows:

s(m, c) =


4 if c is the exactly same as g(m),
3 if c is the parent article of g(m),
2 if c belongs to the same article

but different section of g(m),
1 otherwise.

,

where g(m) is the manual annotation for the most
relevant concept of m.

directed title to c
RIM whether a re-directed title to c is a sub-string of

the m’s surface form
PMT similarity score based on edit distance between

the surface of m and the title of c
PMR maximum similarity score between the surface of

m and the redirected titles to c

w ∈ {1, 3, 5, 10}

Table 1: List of features for training the ranking
SVM model for Wikification

Then, a ranking SVM (Joachims, 2002) model,
a pairwise ranking algorithm learned from the
ranked lists, is trained based on the scores and the
features in Table 1. In the execution time, the top-
ranked item in the list of candidates scored by this
model is considered as the result of Wikification
for a given mention.

4 Wikification-based Features for
Dialogue Topic Tracking

Following our previous work (Kim et al., 2014a;
Kim et al., 2014b), the classifier f for dialogue
topic tracking is trained on the labeled dataset us-
ing supervised machine learning techniques.

The simplest baseline is to learn the classi-
fier based on the vector space model (Salton et
al., 1975) considering bag-of-words for the terms
within the given utterances. An instance for each
turn is represented by a weighted term vector de-
fined as follows:

φ(x) =
(
α1, α2, · · · , α|W |

) ∈ R|W |,
where αi =

∑h
j=0

(
λj · tfidf(wi, u(t−j))

)
, ut is

the utterance mentioned in a turn t, tfidf(wi, ut)
is the product of term frequency of a word wi in
ut and inverse document frequency of wi, λ is a
decay factor for giving more importance to more
recent turns, |W | is the size of word dictionary,
and h is the number of previous turns considered
as dialogue history features.

To overcome the limitations caused by lack of
semantic or domain-specific aspects in the first
baseline, we previosly proposed (Kim et al.,
2014b) to leverage on Wikipedia as an external
knowledge source with an extended feature space
defined by concatenating the concept space with
the previous term vector space as follows:

φ′(x) =
(
α1, α2, · · · , α|W |, β1, β2, · · · , β|D|

)
,

where φ′(x) ∈ R|W |+|C|, βi is the semantic re-
latedness between the input x and the concept in
the i-th Wikipedia article and |C| is the number of
concepts in the Wikipedia collection. The value
for βi is computed with the cosine similarity be-
tween term vectors as follows:

βi = sim(x, ci) = cos (θ) =
φ(x) · φ(ci)
|φ(x)||φ(ci)| ,

where φ(ci) is the term vector composed from the
i-th Wikipedia concept in the collection.

In this work, the results of Wikification de-
scribed in Section 3 are utilized to extend the fea-
ture space for training the topic tracker, instead of
or in addition to the above mentioned feature val-
ues obtained from dialogue segment-level analy-
ses. A value γi in the new feature space is defined
as the weighted sum of the number of mentions
linked to a given concept ci within a dialogue seg-
ment as follows:

γi =
h∑

j=0

(
λj · ∣∣{mk ∈ u(t−j)|g(mk) = ci}∣∣) ,

where mk is the k-th mention in a given utterance
u, g(m) is the top-ranked result of Wikification
for the mention m, λ is a decay factor, and h is the
window size for considering dialogue history.

5 Evaluation

To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
approach for dialogue topic tracking using Wik-
ification results, we performed experiments on
the Singapore tour guide dialogues which consists
of 35 sessions collected from human-human con-
versations between tour guides and tourists. All
the recorded dialogues with the total length of
21 hours were manually transcribed, then these
31,034 utterances were manually annotated with
the following nine topic categories: Opening,
Closing, Itinerary, Accommodation, Attraction,
Food, Transportation, Shopping, and Other.

Table 2: Comparisons of the topic tracking performances with different combinations of features

For topic tracking, an instance for both train-
ing and prediction of topic transition was created
for every utterance in the dialogues. For each in-
stance x, the term vector φ(x) was generated with
the α values from utterances within the window
sizes h = 2 for the current and previous turns
and h = 10 for the history turns. The β values
for representing the segment-level relevances were
computed based on 3,155 Singapore-related arti-
cles which were used in our previous work (Kim
et al., 2014b).

For Wikification, all the utterance were pre-
processed by Stanford CoreNLP toolkit 2, firstly.
Each noun phrase in the constituent trees provided
by the parser was considered as an instance for
Wikification and manually annotated with the cor-
responding concept in Wikipedia. For every men-
tion, we retrieved top 100 candidates from the
Lucene index based on the Wikipedia database
dump as of January 2015 which has 4,797,927 ar-
ticles and 25,577,464 sections in total and added
one more special candidate for NIL detection.
Then, a ranking function using SVMrank3 was
trained on this dataset, which achieved 38.04,
31.97, and 34.74 in precision, recall, and F-
measure, respectively, in the evaluation for Wik-
ification for each mention-level based on five-fold
cross validation. The γ values in our proposed ap-
proach were assigned based on the top-ranked re-
sults from this ranking fuction for the mentions in
the dialogues.

In this evaluation, the following three different
schedules were applied for both training the mod-
els and prediction the topic transitions: (a) taking
every utterance regardless of the speaker into ac-
count; (b) considering only the turns taken by the
tourists; and (c) by the guides. While the first
schedule aims at learning the human behaviours
in topic tracking from the third person point of

3http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/svm light/svm rank.html

view, the others could show the tracking capabil-
ities of the models as a sub-component in the di-
alogue system which act as a guide and a tourist,
respectively.

The SVM models were trained using
SVMlight 4 (Joachims, 1999) with different
combinations of the features. All the evaluations
were done in five-fold cross validation to the man-
ual annotations with two different metrics: one
is accuracy of the predicted topic label for every
turn, and the other is precision/recall/F-measure
for each event of topic transition occurred either
in the answer or the predicted result.

Table 2 compares the performances of the fea-
ture combinations for each schedule. While the
dialogue segment-level β features failed to show
significant improvement compared to the baseline
only with term vectors, the models with our pro-
posed Wikification-based features γ achieved bet-
ter performances in both transition and turn-level
evaluations for all the schedules. The further en-
hancement led by the oracle features with the man-
ual annotations for Wikification represented by γ′

indicates that the overall performances could be
improved by refining the Wikification model.

6 Conclusions

This paper presented a dialogue topic tracking ap-
proach using Wikification-based features. This ap-
proach aimed to incorporate more detailed infor-
mation regarding the correspondences between a
given dialogue and Wikipedia concepts. Exper-
imental results show that our proposed approach
helped to improve the topic tracking performances
compared to the baselines. For future work, we
plan to apply the kernel methods proposed in our
previous work also on the feature spaces based on
Wikification as well as to improve the Wikifica-
tion model itself for achieving better overall per-
formances in dialogue topic tracking.
