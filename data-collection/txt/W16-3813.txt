Abstract

This paper presents our ongoing work on compilation of English multi-word expression (MWE)
lexicon and corpus annotation. We are especially interested in collecting flexible MWEs, in
which some other constituents can intervene the expression such as “a number of” vs “a large
number of” where a modifier of “number” can be placed in the expression while inheriting the
original meaning. We first collect possible candidates of flexible English MWEs from the web,
and annotate all of their occurrences in the Wall Street Journal portion of OntoNotes corpus. We
make use of word dependency structure information of the sentences converted from the phrase
structure annotation. This process enables semi-automatic annotation of MWEs in the corpus and
simultaneously produces the internal and external dependency representation of flexible MWEs.

1 Introduction

Multiword Expressions (MWEs) are roughly defined as those that have “idiosyncratic interpretations
that cross word boundaries (or spaces)”(Sag, 2002), and are classified into the following categories:

• Lexicalized phrases
– fixed expressions: Those with fixed word order and forms (e.g. with respect to).
– semi-fixed expressions: Those with lexical variation such as inflection, etc. (e.g. keep up with,

kept up with).
– syntactically flexible expressions: Those with a wide range of syntactic variability (e.g. some

of the internal words in an MWE can have a modifier).

• Institutionalized phrases
– Phrases that are syntactically compositional but semantically specific (e.g. traffic light).

In this paper we mainly focus on English syntactically flexible multi-word expressions, since they
are less investigated than other types of MWEs. There are a number of MWEs that grammatically
behave as single lexical items belonging to some specific parts-of-speech, such as adverbs, determiners,
prepositions, subordinate conjunctions, and so on. Other than MWEs with those functions, we also
consider multi-word verbs such as take into consideration, but not multi-word nouns. The reason we
do not consider multi-word nouns is that most of them are syntactically not flexible, meaning they do
not allow to have modifiers within them. MWEs have specific grammatical functionalities and can be
regarded as an important part of an extended lexicon.

The objective of our work is to construct a wide coverage English syntactically flexible MWE lexicon,
to describe their structures in dependency structures with possible modifiers within them, and to annotate
their occurrences in the Wall Street Journal portion of OntoNotes corpus (Pradhan et al., 2007).

There have been some attempts for constructing English MWE lexicon. An English fixed MWE
lexicon and a list of phrasal verbs are presented in (Shigeto et al., 2015) and (Komai et al., 2015). They

also annotated the occurrences of those expressions in Penn Treebank. While most of English dictionaries
for human use include a large list of multi-word expressions and idioms, to the best of our knowledge,
there has been no comprehensive lexicon of English flexible MWEs constructed that is usable for NLP
tasks.

The main contributions of our work are the following:

1. We constructed a large scale syntactically flexible English multi-word lexicon by collecting them
from various web sites that list MWEs.

2. Through annotation of collected MWEs in OntoNotes corpus, we identified possible modifiers that
can appear within the expressions.

Our current work has clear limitation that we cannot know how flexible those expressions are that
do not appear in a form of flexible usage in OntoNotes. So, the first contribution is still ongoing. But,
for the second contribution, we try to annotate all the occurrences of flexible MWEs in OntoNotes. In
the following sections, we first describe related research, then explain how we collected English flexible
MEWs and the method we used to annotate the occurrences of MWEs in OntoNote. We also give some
statistics concerning with our experiments.

2 Related Works

Corpus annotation of MWEs hasn’t been done in large scale in English. On the other hand, in French
there is a large scale MWE annotated corpus (Abeillé et al., 2003), which includes 18,000 sentences
annotated with 30,000 MWEs. In English, (Schneider et al., 2015) constructed an MWE-annotated
corpus on English Social Web Corpus with all types pf English MWEs. However, the size of the corpus
is small (3,800 sentences). This is the first and only corpus that has annotation of syntactically flexible
English MWEs.

For English fixed and semi-flexible MWEs there are some works on construction of lexicons and on
annotation on a large scale corpus. (Shigeto et al., 2015) and (Kato et al., 2016) annotated the Wall Street
Journal portion of OnteNotes with fixed functional MWEs. The size of the corpus is 37,000 sentences
and the number of annotated MWEs is 6,900. In the former work they constructed an English fixed MWE
lexicon and annotated the spans of all occurrences of MWEs in the corpus. The latter work annotated and
modified dependency structure of the sentences in accordance with their functionality. A specific type of
English MWEs, phrasal verbs, are annotated on the same corpus by (Komai et al., 2015), in which they
annotated 22,600 occurrences of phrasal verbs in 37,000 sentences.

PARSEME (PARSing and Multi-word Expressions) Project1 is a project devoted to the issue of Mul-
tiword Expressions in parsing and in linguistic resources in multi-lingual perspective. A comprehensive
introduction of the project is found in (Savary et al., 2015). A detailed survey of MWEs in Treebanks is
found in (Rosén et al., 2016).

3 Collection of English Flexible Multi-word Expressions

For collecting English flexible MWE candidates, we explored ALL IN ONE English learning site2 and
the index of the English Idiom dictionary by Weblio3. Both sites provide useful information for English
learners such as dictionaries, examples and useful expressions. In addition, we explored the entiries in
Wiktionary4 that contain white space(s) within the expressions whose part-of-speech are either Verb,
Adjective, Adverb, Preposition, or Conjunction.

All of those collected 16,339 MWE candidates. Then, we counted the corpus occurrences of those
expressions using Web 1T 5-gram(LDC2006T13)5. By ordering them according to the occurrence fre-
quencies, we collected top 3,000 expressions. We then deleted all the MWEs already known as fixed

MWEs or phrasal verbs based on the lexicons constructed by previous works, (Shigeto et al., 2015) and
(Komai et al., 2015). This results in 2,927 MWEs, which are our starting candidate flexible MWEs. At
this stage, we do not know they are really flexible MWEs. Moreover, even if a candidate MWE is known
as a flexible MWE, we do not know how flexible it is, that is, what kind of modifications it can involve.

4 Identification and Annotation of MWEs with Dependency Structure

4.1 Overview and objective
One of our objectives is to construct an English flexible MWE lexicon with the information of the degree
of flexibility. Here, we only focus on flexibility concerning modification within the expression. For
example, an MWE “a number of” can be used as “a growing number of” or “a very large number of”.
Finding those occurrences and their syntactic uniformity, we can guess that “a number of” can involve a
word that modifies “number” in the expression6. To know correct syntactic structure of candidate MWEs,
we make use of the Wall Street Journal portion of OntoNotes Release 5.0 (LDC2013T19) and converted
all the phrase structure trees into dependency structure trees (those based on Stanford dependency7).
The reason we used dependency tree rather than phrase structure trees is that the phrase structures in
Peen Treebank are not uniform on their structure and phrase names. The same MWEs or the phrases
that include them are in places annotated in slightly different phrase structures or with different phrase
names. When they are converted into dependency structures, they become quite uniform.

Another objective is to annotate all the occurrences of MWEs in OntoNotes both in fixed or flexible
forms. For all the possible occurrences of an MWE, that is, the occurrences of not only the exact appear-
ances of the MWE but also the appearances that have one or more words intervened in the expression,
we made annotation. With the help of dependency information obtained from the phrase structure tree,
we semi-automatically annotated correct occurrences of MWEs. The same forms of some MWEs can be
in literal usage. So, we are going to manually check all the annotation results before making them open
to public.

The following subsections explain how we conducted the semi-automatic annotation of MWE candi-
dates.

4.2 Extraction of Dependency Structure that Cover MWEs
This section describes the method for extracting dependency tree fragments that cover candidate MWEs.
We used the Wall Street Journal portion (wsj 00-24) of OntoNotes after converting the phrase structure
trees into Stanford dependency trees.

We took the following steps:

1. For each candidate MWE, we first extract all the sentences in OntoNotes that include the MWE in
a flexible form. Fo example, in the case of “a number of”, we extract all the sentences contain “a”,
“number” and “of” in this ordering. This process extracts quite a large number of sentences, but
captures all sentences that potentially include the MWE.

2. We convert all the sentences into Stanford dependency (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008)8.

3. For each sentence, we extract the minimal dependency subtree that covers the all the words com-
prising the MWE. An example of an extracted subtree is shown in Figure 1.

4. Within the subtree, there can be some other words or subtree that do not comprise the MWE. In
the above case, the subtree consisting of “division heads” is an example. In such a case, we leave
only the head of the subtree and delete all other children. Then we replace all the words that do not
comprise the MWE with the POS labels. In the above example, we obtain the tree that represents a
flexible usage of the MWE, “a JJ number of NN” (shown in Figure 2).

6The example “a very large number of” includes two words between “a” and “number”, while only “large” modifies “num-
ber”.

Figures 3, 4, and 5 show three occurrences of “a number of” in different forms (all the figures show
the minimal subtrees that include this MWE).

Figure 4: Subtree of ”a number of workers ...” Figure 5: Subtree of ”a number of division heads ...”

After the procedure described above, we obtain isomorphic trees with only difference of existence of
modifiers within the expression, e.g., the tree in Figure 3 includes a JJ as a modifier of “number”. From
those trees we can obtain the dependency tree shown in Figure 6 as a flexible MWE so that “number”
can have an internal modifier. In the figure, *1 is a wild card to be defined as a JJ or an empty element
in the current case, but will be eventually defined as {ϵ, JJ, NN, VBG, VBN} and *2 is defined as {NN,
SYM} since words with those POS tags appear at the corresponding positions in some examples.

Figure 6: Representation of flexible MWE “a number of”

For each candidate MWE, we run the above procedure and obtain all possible subtrees. Some of
the subtrees are from the fixed form of the MWE, i.e., in the original sentences there are no extra words
intervening the expression. Still, they do not necessarily produce the same subtree. Within those subtrees,
we pick up the smallest one, and assume it as the dependency structure of the MWE in the usage of its
fixed form and call it as the canonical tree of the MWE. We assume all the other cases as non-MWE
usages of the expression. We extract all the subtrees extracted from flexible occurrences and compare
them with the canonical tree. If they are isomorphic except for the structure stemming from additional
words that appear within the MWE, we regard them as the true flexible usage of the MWE. For all the
subtrees that are not the same as the canonical tree nor isomorphic to the canonical tree are regarded as
false cases, meaning they are not the true usage of the MWE.

For the 2927 MWE candidates we collected, we looked for all the fixed and flexible occurrences of
them in the total of 37,015 sentences. Only 1871 MWEs have at least one occurrence in the corpus. We
then obtained 26,358 minimal subtrees, and 14,146 unique minimal subtrees. We summarize them in
Table 1.

Number of MWE types 1871
Number of Minimal Subtrees 26,358
Number of Unique Subtrees 14,146

Those figures suggest and we confirmed that most of the false occurrences of MWEs are unique.

5 Automated Annotation of MWEs

By comparing the subtrees for each MWE, we apply the above mentioned process for identifying positive
usages of the MWE and for obtaining the dependency tree representation of the MWE.

For each MWE candidate, the instances that correspond to the canonical dependency trees and those
that produce its isomorphic dependency trees are regarded as positive and true usages of the MWE. We
cannot make any decision on the MWEs that appear only once in the corpus. In the following analysis,
we excluded those MWEs.

When we decided that the canonical usages and their isomorphic usages are positive usages of MWEs,
we found 1,194 positive fixed cases (i.e., canonical usages), 1,704 positive flexible cases (i.e., isomorphic
to canonical form), and 11,248 negative cases. Table 2 summarizes them.

5.1 Some Problematic Examples
In this section, we show some examples that are difficult to discriminate based on the structure uniformity
with canonical usages. Figure 7 shows a positive usage (i.e., the canonical usage) of “a certain”. Figure
8 shows a negative occurrence of this MWE. The dependency tree in Figue 8 is isomorphic to that in
Figure 7 except for the existence of an adverb “almost” within the expression as a parent of “certain”.
Although our procedure cannot identify the latter case as a negative example, it is clear that the head
NN’s in the trees are at different positions in the latter expression. The head NN in the canonical usage
appears to the right of “certain”, while the head NN in the negative case appears to the left of “certain”.
Taking the relative positons of head or modifiers into consideration solves this problem. We are going to
investigate if this is true in all other cases.

Figure 7: Canonical Subtree of ”a certain” Figure 8: Negative Subtree of ”a certain”

Another problematic and difficult case is shown in Figures 9 and 10. Figure 9 shows the canonical
usage of “a couple of”, and Figure 10 shows a variation of this MWE. Since the minimal subtree extracted
from the latter example is not isomorphic to the former subtree, we cannot recognize this as a positive
usage. On the other hand, if we like to regard the latter case as an admissible variation of the MWE
“a couple of”, we need to find better ways for identifying these types of positive usages where an extra
element is not necessarily a modifier (child) of a component of an MWE.

6 Conclusion and Feature work

We presented our ongoing project of English flexible multi-word expression lexicon construction and
corpus annotation. We especially described a method of flexible MWE lexicon construction and their

annotation on a part of OntoNotes corpus. Our method enables semi-automatic annotation of flexible
MWEs and also produces dependency structure representations of flexible MWEs.

While the method can achieve high recall of annotating positive occurrences in treebank, we need man-
ual checking for those cases where the extracted minimal dependency subtrees are close but a slightly
different from the canonical subtrees. Another problem we need to pursue is that the coverage of can-
didate MWEs is not wide enough. As we show in the experiments, within the MWE candidates we
collected, only one third of them appear in the OntoNotes corpus. Furthermore, many of them show one
or a small number of occurrences.

For the future work, we will try to collect far larger number of occurrences of the candidate MWEs
in a large scale corpus, parse all the extracted sentences in dependency structure, and apply the method
presented in this paper to those parsed results. Although the parsing accuracy is not 100%, handling a
large number of examples hopefully provides results with high confidence.
