Abstract

Recent studies have shown that word embed-
dings exhibit gender bias inherited from the
training corpora. However, most studies to
date have focused on quantifying and mitigat-
ing such bias only in English. These analy-
ses cannot be directly extended to languages
that exhibit morphological agreement on gen-
der, such as Spanish and French. In this paper,
we propose new metrics for evaluating gender
bias in word embeddings of these languages
and further demonstrate evidence of gender
bias in bilingual embeddings which align these
languages with English. Finally, we extend an
existing approach to mitigate gender bias in
word embedding under both monolingual and
bilingual settings. Experiments on modified
Word Embedding Association Test, word sim-
ilarity, word translation, and word pair transla-
tion tasks show that the proposed approaches
effectively reduce the gender bias while pre-
serving the utility of the embeddings.

1 Introduction

Word embeddings are widely used in modern nat-
ural language processing tools. By virtue of their
being trained on large, human-written corpora, re-
cent studies have shown that word embeddings, in
addition to capturing a word’s semantics, also en-
code gender bias in society (Bolukbasi et al., 2016;
Caliskan et al., 2017). As a result of this bias, the
embeddings may cause undesired consequences
in the resulting models (Zhao et al., 2018a; Font
and Costa-jussà, 2019). Therefore, extensive ef-
fort has been put toward analyzing and mitigating
gender bias in word embeddings (Bolukbasi et al.,
2016; Zhao et al., 2018b; Dev and Phillips, 2019;
Ethayarajh et al., 2019).

Existing studies on gender bias almost exclu-
sively focus on English (EN) word embeddings.
Unfortunately, the techniques used to mitigate bias

in English word embeddings cannot be directly
applied to languages with grammatical gender1,
where all nouns are assigned a gender class and
the corresponding dependent articles, adjectives,
and verbs must agree in gender with the noun (e.g.
in Spanish: la buena enfermera the good female
nurse, el buen enfermero the good male nurse) (Cor-
bett, 1991, 2006). This is because most existing ap-
proaches define bias in word embeddings based on
the projection of a word on a gender direction (e.g.
“nurse” in English is biased because its projection
on the gender direction inclines towards female).
When the grammatical gender exists, such bias def-
inition is problematic as masculine and feminine
words naturally carry gender information. For ex-
ample, “enfermero” (male nurse) and “enfermera”
(female nurse) lean toward male and female, re-
spectively. This is due to morphological agreement
and should not be considered as a stereotype.

However, gender bias in the embeddings of lan-
guages with grammatical gender indeed exists. For
example, when we align Spanish (ES) embeddings
to English embeddings, the word “abogado” (male
lawyer) is closer to “lawyer” than “abogada” (fe-
male lawyer). This observation implies a discrep-
ancy in semantics between the masculine and femi-
nine forms of the same occupation in Spanish word
embeddings. A similar observation is also found in
other languages, such as French (FR).

In this paper, we refer languages that have gen-
der distinctions for all nouns (e.g., Spanish and
German) as gendered languages and others that do
not mark grammatical gender as languages with-
out grammatical gender (e.g., English). We use
Spanish and French as running examples and pro-

1Grammatical gender is a complicated linguistic phe-
nomenon; many languages contain more than two gender
classes. In this paper, we focus on languages with masculine
and feminine classes. For gender in semantics, we follow the
literature and address only binary gender.

pose quantitative methods for evaluating bias in
word embeddings of gendered languages and bilin-
gual word embeddings that align a gendered lan-
guage with English. We first define gender bias
in the word embeddings of gendered languages by
constructing two gender directions: the semantic
gender direction and the grammatical gender di-
rection. We then analyze gender bias in bilingual
embeddings using a similar approach.

To mitigate gender bias in these embeddings, we
propose two approaches. One is shifting words
along the semantic gender direction with respect to
an anchor point and the other is mitigating English
first and then aligning the embedding spaces. Re-
sults show that a hybrid of these two approaches ef-
fectively mitigate bias in Spanish and French word
embeddings as well as ES-EN, FR-EN bilingual
word embeddings. We also show through word
similarity and word translation experiments that
the utility of the original monolingual and bilingual
word embeddings is preserved.

Our contributions are summarized in the follow-
ing. (1) We show that word embeddings of gen-
dered languages such as Spanish and French con-
tain gender bias and bilingual word embeddings
aligning these languages to English also inherit
the bias. (2) Based on the observation, we pro-
pose new definitions of gender bias by constructing
two gender directions. (3) We propose methods to
reduce gender bias for both monolingual and bilin-
gual embeddings and show that they effectively
mitigate bias while preserving the original utility
of embeddings. Source code and data are avail-
able at https://github.com/shaoxia57/

2 Gender Bias Analysis

This section discusses how to analyze bias in em-
beddings of gendered languages and bilingual word
embeddings.

2.1 Bias in Gendered Languages

In gendered languages, all nouns are assigned a
gender class. However, inanimate objects (e.g., wa-
ter and spoon) do not carry the meaning of male
or female. To address this issue, we define two
gender directions: (1) semantic gender, which is
defined by a set of gender definition words (e.g.,
man, male, waitress) and (2) grammatical gender,
which is defined by a set of masculine and femi-
nine nouns (e.g., water, table, woman). Most anal-

ysis of gender bias assumes that the language (e.g,.
English) only has the former direction. However,
when analyzing languages like Spanish and French,
considering the second is necessary. We discuss
these two directions in detail as follows.

Semantic Gender Following Bolukbasi et al.
(2016), we collect a set of gender-definition pairs
(e.g., “mujer” (woman) and “hombre” (man) in
Spanish). Then, the gender direction is de-
rived by conducting principal component analysis
(PCA) (Jolliffe, 2011) over the differences between
male- and female-definition word vectors. Similar
to the analysis in English, we observe that there is
one major principal component carrying the mean-
ing of gender in French and Spanish and we define
it as the semantic gender direction ~dPCA.

Grammatical Gender The number of grammat-
ical gender classes ranges from two to several
tens (Corbett, 1991). To simplify the discussion,
we focus on noun class systems where two major
gender classes are feminine and masculine. How-
ever, the proposed approach can be generalized to
languages with multiple gender classes (e.g., Ger-
man). To identify grammatical gender direction,
we collect around 3,000 common nouns that are
grammatically masculine and 3,000 nouns that are
feminine. Since most nouns (e.g., water) do not
have a paired word in the other gender class, we do
not have pairs of words to represent different gram-
matical genders. Therefore, instead of applying
PCA, we learn the grammatical gender direction
~dg by Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) (Fisher,
1936), which is a standard approach for supervised
dimension reduction. The model achieves an aver-
age accuracy of 0.92 for predicting the grammatical
gender in Spanish and 0.83 in French with 5-fold
cross-validation.

Comparing ~dPCA with ~dg, the cosine similar-
ity between them is 0.389, indicating these two
directions are overlapped to some extent but not
identical. This is reasonable because words such
as “mujer (woman)”, “doctor (female doctor)” are
both semantically and grammatically marked as
feminine. To better distinguish between these two
directions, we project out the grammatical gender
component in the computed gender direction to
make the semantic gender direction ~ds orthogonal
to the grammatical gender direction:

~ds = ~dPCA −
〈
~dPCA, ~dg

〉

where 〈~x, ~y〉 represents the inner product of two
vectors.

Visualizing and Analyzing Bias in Spanish We
take Spanish as an example and analyze gender bias
in Spanish fastText word embeddings (Bojanowski
et al., 2017) pre-trained on Spanish Wikipedia. For
simplicity, we assume that the embeddings contain
all gender forms of the words. To show bias, we
randomly select several pairs of gender-definition
and occupation words as well as inanimate nouns
in Spanish and visualize them on the two gender
directions defined above.

Figure 1 shows that the inanimate nouns lie near
the origin point on the semantic gender direction,
while the masculine and feminine forms of the oc-
cupation words are on the opposite sides for both
directions. However, while projections of occupa-
tion words on the grammatical gender direction are
symmetric with respect to the origin point, they
are asymmetric when projected on the semantic
gender direction. Along the semantic gender direc-
tion, female occupation words incline more to the
feminine side than the male occupation words to
the masculine side. This discrepancy shows that
the embeddings carry unequal information for two
genders.

Quantification of Gender Bias To quantify
gender bias in English embeddings, Caliskan
et al. (2017) propose Word Embedding Associa-
tion Test (WEAT), which measures the association
between two sets of target concepts and two sets
of attributes. Let X and Y be equal-sized sets of
target concept embeddings (e.g., words related to
mathematics and art) and let A and B be sets of
attribute embeddings (e.g., male and female defi-
nition words such as “man”, “girl”). Let cos(~a,~b)
denote the cosine similarity between vectors ~a and
~b. The test statistic is a difference between sums
over the respective target concepts,

s(X,Y,A,B) =
∑
~x∈X

s(~x,A,B)−
∑
~y∈Y

s(~y,A,B),

where s(~w,A,B) is the difference between aver-
age cosine similarities of the respective attributes,

s(~w,A,B)=
1

|A|
∑
~a∈A

cos(~w,~a)− 1
|B|
∑
~b∈B

cos(~w,~b).

In the following, we extend the definition to
quantify individual words in gendered languages.

Figure 1: Projections of selected words in Spanish on
grammatical and semantic directions with masculine
nouns in blue and feminine nouns in red. We find
that: (1) Most inanimate nouns (e.g., map, spoon; en-
closed by black dotted lines) lie near the origin point of
the semantic gender axis; (2) Masculine definition and
occupation words (blue dotted lines) lie in the mascu-
line side for both gender directions and so do feminine
words (red dotted lines). But the feminine words are
farther on the feminine side on the semantic gender di-
rection compared to masculine words.

We consider two types of words. One is inanimate
nouns, like “agua” (water, feminine). They are as-
signed as either a masculine or feminine noun. The
other is animate nouns that usually have two gender
forms, like “doctor” (male doctor) and “doctora”
(female doctor).2

For inanimate nouns that should not be semanti-
cally leaning towards one gender, we can quantify
the gender bias for word w simply using WEAT,

bw = |s(~w,A,B)| ,

which measures the association strength of the
word w with the gender concepts. The larger bw
is, the stronger its association with the gender con-
cepts.

For nouns with two gender forms, we test if
their masculine (~wm) and feminine (~wf ) forms are
symmetrical with respect to gender definition terms.

bw = ||s(~wm, A,B)| − |s(~wf , A,B)|| . (1)

The larger the value is, the larger gender bias
presents. For example, if “doctor” (male doctor)
leans more toward to masculine (i.e., close to mas-
culine definition words like “el” (he) and far away

2Note that some animate nouns in certain languages, like
“médecin” (male doctor) in French, only have one gender form.
We omit such cases in this paper for the sake of simplicity.

from feminine definition words like “ella” (she))
than “doctora” leans toward to feminine, then em-
beddings of “doctor” and “doctora” are biased. We
will discuss detailed quantitative analysis using this
metric in Section 4.

2.2 Bias in Bilingual Word Embeddings

Bilingual word embeddings are used widely in
tasks such as multilingual transfer. It is essential
to quantify and mitigate gender bias in these em-
beddings to avoid them from affecting downstream
applications. We focus on bilingual word embed-
dings that align a grammatical gender language like
Spanish with a language without grammatical gen-
der like English. The definitions of the two gender
directions are similar: we construct the grammati-
cal gender direction using the same sets of words
in the gendered language since the other language
does not mark grammatical gender. We combine
the gender-definition words for both languages and
remove the grammatical gender component to get
the semantic gender direction similarly.

We use bilingual word embeddings from
MUSE (Conneau et al., 2018) that align English
and Spanish fastText embeddings together in a sin-
gle vector space. Figure 2 shows the projections
of 5 occupation words on the semantic gender di-
rection. First, we notice that the embeddings of
some English occupations are much closer to one
gender form than the other in Spanish. For ex-

ample, “nurse” in English is closer to “enfermera”
(female nurse) than “enfermero” (male nurse) in
Spanish. We further separate out the bias in English
embedding in the analysis by mitigating the En-
glish embeddings using “hard-debiasing” approach
proposed in Bolukbasi et al. (2016) and aligning
Spanish embedding with the bias-reduced English
embedding (words annotated with “*”). Results in
Figure 2 demonstrate another type of gender un-
equal in bilingual embedding: masculine occupa-
tion words are closer to the corresponding English
occupation words than the feminine counterparts.
This result aligns with the observation in Figure 1.

More quantitative analyses about gender bias
in bilingual embedding will be discussed in Sec-
tion 4.3.

3 Mitigation Methods

In the following, we first describe the optimization
objectives for mitigating gender bias. Then, we
present mitigation methods under two settings: (1)
monolingual setting, where we only have access to
word embeddings of the gendered language, and (2)
bilingual setting, where the embeddings of a lan-
guage without grammatical gender (e.g. English)
aligned in the same space are also provided. Specif-
ically, for the bilingual setting, we can use English
word vectors to facilitate the bias mitigation.

3.1 Mitigation Objectives
For inanimate nouns, we project out their semantic
gender component as they should not carry seman-
tic gender. Equivalently, we minimize the inner
product 〈

~w, ~ds

〉
(2)

between the inanimate word vector ~w and the se-
mantic gender direction ~ds.

For nouns with both gender forms, we aim at
removing the gender inequality on the semantic
gender direction as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2.
Specifically, we minimize the difference between
the distance of feminine form of the word ~wf and
the masculine form of the word ~wm to an anchor
point (e.g., the origin point) on the semantic gender
direciton ds:∣∣∣∣∣∣〈~wm, ~ds〉−〈~wa, ~ds〉∣∣∣−∣∣∣〈~wf , ~ds〉−〈~wa, ~ds〉∣∣∣∣∣∣ .

(3)
Note that for most cases, ~wm and ~wf lie on the
opposite sides of the anchor point on the semantic



5280

gender axis. Therefore, we can simplify Eq. (3) as∣∣∣〈~wm, ~ds〉+ 〈~wf , ~ds〉− 2〈~wa, ~ds〉∣∣∣ . (4)
Intuitively, this measures how much we need to

move the word pair on the semantic gender direc-
tion so that they are symmetric with respect to the
anchor point. If the anchor point is the origin point
(i.e.

〈
~wa, ~ds

〉
= 0), this objective is the absolute

value of the sum of two projections.

3.2 Monolingual Setting

Shifting Along Semantic Gender Direction
(Shift) We mitigate bias by minimizing Eq. (4)
and Eq. (2) in a post-processing manner. Effec-
tively, for inanimate nouns, we remove the seman-
tic gender component from the embeddings. For
nouns with two gender forms (e.g., occupations),
we shift the two forms along the semantic gender
direction so that they have the same distance to the
anchor point. For monolingual setting, we use the
origin point on the gender direction as the anchor
point and call the method Shift Ori.

Note that Gonen and Goldberg (2019) show that
mitigating gender bias in word embeddings by mov-
ing on the gender direction is not sufficient and
words with gender bias still tend to group together.
Similairly, our approach might not entirely remove
the gender bias. However, the approach in Go-
nen and Goldberg (2019) to test the remainder bias
cannot be applied directly for gendered languages,
because grouping of the embeddings of masculine
and feminine words does not always indicate bias
due to grammatical gender .

3.3 Bilingual Setting

Mitigating Before Alignment (De-Align) As
gender bias can be observed when aligning gen-
dered languages with language without grammati-
cal gender, we consider using English to facilitate
mitigating bias. Specifically, we first apply the
“hard-debasing” approach Bolukbasi et al. (2016)
to English embedding and then align gendered lan-
guage with the bias-reduced English. Because most
words with both gender forms align to the same
word in English (e.g., “enfermero” and “enfermera”
in Spanish both align to “nurse” in English), the
alignment places the two gender forms of the words
in a more symmetric positions in the vector space
after the alignment.

Shifting Along Semantic Gender Direction
(Shift) We consider using English words as an-
chor positions when mitigating bias using Eq (4).
We call this approach Shift EN. For example,
when applying Eq. (4) to re-position “enfermero”
and “enfermera” in Spanish we take English word
“nurse” aligned in the same space as the anchor
position.

Hybrid Method (Hybrid) We also consider a
hybrid method that integrates the aforementioned
two approaches. In particular, we first mitigate
English embeddings, align English embeddings
with the embeddings of gendered languages, and
then shift words in languages with grammatical
gender along the semantic gender direction. We
consider two variants based on how the anchor
positions are chosen: (1) Hybrid Ori uses the origin
point as the anchor position; and (2) Hybrid EN
uses the corresponding bias-reduced English word
as an anchor position when shifting a pair of words
with different gender forms.

4 Experiments

We evaluate gender bias mitigation methods in both
monolingual and bilingual settings and test the util-
ity of the bias-reduced embeddings in word-level
translation tasks Conneau et al. (2018). Follow-
ing other analyses on gender bias (Bolukbasi et al.,
2016; Caliskan et al., 2017), we quantify the gen-
der bias based on a set of animate nouns including
occupations and gender-definition words. These
words are representative to the major challenge
when quantifying and mitigating gender bias. Dif-
ferent from previous analyses in English, most oc-
cupation words in gendered languages have more
than one forms and their embeddings are inherently
different from each other due to morphological
agreement.

4.1 Data and Configuration
We apply the proposed mitigation methods on
Spanish-English and French-English bilingual em-
beddings from MUSE (Conneau et al., 2018) that
align the fastText monolingual embeddings pre-
trained on Wikipedia corpora together in a single
vector space. We collect 58 occupation words in
Spanish from the occupation list provided by Font
and Costa-jussà (2019) and 23 in French (some oc-
cupations in French do not distinguish between two
forms) for the bias mitigation experiments. We use
WEAT word lists from Caliskan et al. (2017) for

periments and translate them to Spanish and French.
For the word pair translation task, we use 7 com-
mon adjectives and pair every adjective with each
occupation, resulting in 406 pairs for Spanish and
161 for French.

4.2 Monolingual Experiments

Modified Word Embedding Association Test
(MWEAT) As discussed in Section 2, we eval-
uate the gender bias using modified WEAT and
we treat the absolute value of the sum of dif-
ferences between mean cosine similarities of the
two gender attributes for these occupation words∣∣∑

~x∈X s(~x,A,B)
∣∣ as the association of male oc-

cupation target concepts X with the gender at-
tributes. Similarly, we use

∣∣∣∑~y∈Y s(~y,A,B)∣∣∣ as
the association of female occupation words with
the gender attributes. Finally our test statistic is∣∣∣∣∣∣

which measures the difference in the association
strength for two target sets with the two attribute
sets occupation words. We then calculate the one-
side p-value of the permutation test.

Word Similarity We test the quality of the em-
beddings after mitigation on the SemEval 2017
word similarity task (Camacho-Collados et al.,
2017) for monolingual embeddings. This task eval-
uates how well the cosine similarity between two
words correlates with a human-labeled score for
which we report the Pearson correlation score.

Results Table 1 shows that Hybrid Ori signifi-
cantly decreases the difference of association be-
tween two genders as indicated by MWEAT–Diff
and p-value. Other methods only show marginal

that the performance of our mitigation methods on
word similarity is largely preserved as indicated by
the Pearson correlation scores.

4.3 Cross-lingual Experiments

Word Translation We use word translation to
examine whether our mitigation approaches pre-
serve the utility of the bilingual word embedid-
dings. This task aims to retrieve the translation of a
source word in the target language. We use the test
set provided by Conneau et al. (2018), which con-
tains 200,000 randomly selected candidate words
for 1,500 query words. We translate a query word
and report the precision at k (i.e., fraction of cor-
rect translations that are ranked not larger than k)
by retrieving its k nearest neighbours in the target
language. We report both results with k = 1 and
k = 5.

pose a word pair translation task to evaluate the bias

in gendered languages. In languages with grammat-
ical gender, word forms of articles and adjectives
need to agree with the gender of nouns they are
associated with. For example, the word “good” has
two forms in Spanish: “bueno” (masculine form)
and “buena” (feminine form). Following the notion
of analogy, we design an evaluation task to test
how bilingual word embeddings translate an En-
glish occupation with the presence of another word.
Specifically, given an English word Ei (a noun, an
adjective or a verb), an English occupation word
Eo, and the corresponding Spanish/French transla-
tion Si of Ei, we adopt the analogy test “Ei:Eo =
Si:?” (e.g., “good:doctor = buena: ?”) to rank all
the words So in Spanish/French based on the cosine
similarity: cos(So, Eo −Ei + Si). Ideally, the cor-
rect translation of Eo that agree with gender of Si
should be ranked on the top (“doctora” in the above
example). Quantitatively, we use the mean recipro-
cal ranks (MRR) to evaluate the performance of the
ranking. If the bilingual embedding is not biased,
the model should perform similarly on answering
the translation of masculine and feminine occupa-
tions. Based on this, we use the gap between the
performances on two form of genders to quantify
the bias in the bilingual embedding space. Besides,
we also report the average cosine similarity dif-
ference (ASD) of occupation words between two
different gender forms.

Figure 4: (M)WEAT scores for occupations in English
and Spanish. For both axes, the smaller the number, the
occupation is more leaning towards to female.

Results Table 2 shows the results. Results on
word translation shows that the mitigation ap-
proaches do not harm the utility of bilingual word
embedding and words in different languages still
align well. From the results of word pair trans-
lation, the original bilingual embedding exhibits
strong bias and the gap between two genders are
around 0.49 in MRR in both ES-EN and FR-EN
bilingual embeddings and the average cosine sim-
ilarity difference is larger than 0.1. Hybrid Ori
results in smallest difference for cosine similarity
and MRR gap between two gender forms. How-
ever, the discrepancy between two forms is not
completely removed.

To visualize the effect of bias mitigation, we

project the bias-reduced embeddings of occupation
words on the semantic gender direction as shown
in Figure 2. Figure 3 shows that after debiasing
using Hybrid Ori, the two gender forms of occupa-
tion words are more symmteric with respect to the
corresponding English embedding.

4.4 Bias Correlation between Languages

Finally, we compute the WEAT/MWEAT scores3

for each occupation and show the commonality
and difference of gender bias between English and
Spanish embedding. Results in Figure 4 shows
that occupations (“nurse” and “mathematician”)
lean towards the same gender in both languages.
However, some occupations (e.g., “chef”) lean to
different genders in different languages. In gen-
eral, there is a strong correlation between gender
bias in English and Spanish embedding (Spearman
correlation=0.45 with p-value=0.0004).

5 Related Work

Previous work has proposed to quantify bias in
English Embedding definitions for gender bias in
English word embeddings. Besides the aforemen-
tioned studies (Bolukbasi et al., 2016; Caliskan
et al., 2017) in quantifying bias in English em-
bedding, McCurdy and Serbeti (2017) examine
grammatical gender bias in word embeddings of
gendered languages by computing the WEAT asso-
ciation score (Caliskan et al., 2017) between gen-
dered object nouns (e.g. moon-sun) and gender-
definition words. They propose to mitigate bias by
applying lemmatization to remove gender informa-
tion from the training corpus. However, their focus
is different from us as our approaches aim at keep-
ing the grammatical gender information and only
removing the bias in semantic genders. A few re-
cent studies focus on measuring and reducing gen-
der bias in contextualized word embeddings (Zhao
et al., 2019; May et al., 2019; Basta et al., 2019).
However, they only focus on English embeddings
in which the gender is mostly only expressed by
pronouns (Stahlberg et al., 2007). An interesting
future direction is to extend their analyses to lan-
guage with grammatical gender.

Regarding bias mitigation appraoches, Zhao et al.
(2018b) mitigate bias by saving one dimension of
the word vector for gender. Bordia and Bowman

3We use WEAT score for English and MWEAT for Span-
ish. To show the direction of bias, we take out the outer
absolute function in Eq. (1).

(2019) propose a regularization loss term for word-
level language models. Zhang et al. (2018) use
an adversarial network to mitigate bias in word
embeddings. All these approaches consider only
English embeddings. Moreover, Gonen and Gold-
berg (2019) show that mitigation methods based
on gender directions are not sufficient, since the
embeddings of socially-biased words still cluster
together.

Bias in word embedding may affect the down-
stream applications (Zhao et al., 2018a; Rudinger
et al., 2018; Font and Costa-jussà, 2019). Be-
sides the gender bias in word embeddings, implicit
stereotypes have been shown in other real world
applications, such as online reviews (Wallace and
Paul, 2016), advertisement (Sweeney, 2013) and
web search (Kay et al., 2015).

6 Conclusion and Future Work

We analyze gender bias in the embeddings of lan-
guages with grammatical gender and bilingual
word embeddings that align such a language with a
language without grammatical gender. We propose
new methods to evaluate and mitigate gender bias
for languages with grammatical gender and bilin-
gual word embeddings and results show that our
methods can mitigate gender bias while preserving
the quality of original embeddings.

Directions for future work include testing mono-
lingual and bilingual word embeddings on down-
stream tasks like machine translation to measure
bias and also test the performance for mitigation
methods. Moreover, the number of noun classes for
other languages with grammatical gender ranges
from two to several tens (Corbett, 1991) and future
work can extend methods proposed in this paper
to address grammatical gender in languages with
more gender forms.
