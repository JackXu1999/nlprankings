Abstract

We describe work consisting in porting two
large German lexical resources into the
OntoLex-Lemon model in order to establish
complementary interlinkings between them.
One resource is OdeNet (Open German Word-
Net) and the other is a further development of
the German version of the MMORPH morpho-
logical analyzer. We show how the Multiword
Expressions (MWEs) contained in OdeNet can
be morphologically specified by the use of the
lexical representation and linking features of
OntoLex-Lemon, which also support the for-
mulation of restrictions in the usage of such
expressions.

1 Introduction

WordNets are well-established lexical resources
with a wide range of applications. For more than
twenty years they have been elaborately set up
and maintained by hand, especially the original
Princeton WordNet of English (PWN) (Fellbaum,
1998). In recent years, there have been increas-
ing activities in which open WordNets for different
languages have been automatically extracted from
other resources and enriched with lexical seman-
tics information, building the so-called Open Mul-
tilingual WordNet (Bond and Paik, 2012). These
WordNets were linked to PWN via shared synset.
In this context a German lexical semantics re-
source with the name Open German WordNet
(OdeNet)1 is being developed with the aim to be
included as the first open German WordNet into
the Open Multilingual WordNet.

This paper deals with the morphological enrich-
ment of OdeNet, with a focus on complex OdeNet
entries. The first morphological resource we are

1We collected information on OdeNet from https://
github.com/hdaSprachtechnologie/odenet.

considering for this task is an updated German
version of the MMORPH morphological analyzer
(Petitpierre and Russell, 1995).2 Besides this re-
source we have consulted the on-line editions of
Duden and CanooNet,3 as well as entries in the
German Wiktionary4 for manually checking a few
lexical features of both OdeNet and MMORPH.

As a representation mean we have adopted
OntoLex-Lemon (Cimiano et al., 2016),5 as this
model was shown to be able to represent both
classical lexicographic description (McCrae et al.,
2017) and lexical semantics networks, like Word-
Net (McCrae et al., 2014). OntoLex-Lemon is a
further development of the “LExicon Model for
Ontologies” (lemon).6 Guidelines for mapping
Global WordNet formats onto lemon-based RDF7

have been published8 and already some WordNets
have been mapped onto lemon, as described for
example in (McCrae et al., 2014).

We follow in this work the suggestion made in
(Hüning and Schlücker, 2015) to consider MWEs
as being “a general term that includes phenom-
ena with different degrees of syntactic fixedness
and semantic compositionality”, allowing us to
treat German compounds in a similar way as

2The German version of this analyzer has been fur-
ther developed, also improving the inclusion of com-
pounds, and the resulting OntoLex-Lemon representation
of this extended resource will be made publicly available,
in the Linguistic Linked Open Data cloud (see http://
linguistic-lod.org/llod-cloud).

OdeNet “phrasal entries”, so that OdeNet entries
“Rotkraut” (red kraut or red cabbage) and “rote
Bete” (beetroot) can be equally considered as
MWEs, but both terms will be associated to dif-
ferent morphological patterns, as the German ad-
jective “rote” in the second case is also displaying
an inflectional behavior in order to be in agreement
with the morphology of the noun (for example in
singular genitive or in all forms of plural, and also
in dependency of the preceding presence of a def-
inite or indefinite determiner).

In the next sections, we give first background in-
formation on OdeNet and on OntoLex-Lemon. We
then describe the mapping of OdeNet to OntoLex-
Lemon. We continue with an introduction of
MMORPH, followed by a section that describes
how the use of MMORPH and OntoLex-Lemon is
supporting the linking of MWEs in OdeNet to full
morphological descriptions.

2 OdeNet

A candidate for representing German lexical se-
mantics data in OntoLex could be for sure Ger-
maNet, which is a manually well-designed Word-
Net resource for German (Hamp et al., 1997). Ger-
maNet was developed over 20 years now and is
very stable and precise. The problem with Ger-
maNet is that it is not available under an open-
source license. The restricted license makes Ger-
maNet unable to be included in the aforemen-
tioned Open Multilingual WordNet. Therefore we
selected OdeNet as the German lexical semantics
resource we want to work with, also with the aim
of publishing the resulting data set as part of the
Linguistic Linked Open Data cloud.9

OdeNet combines two existing resources: The
OpenThesaurus German synonym lexicon10 and
the Open Multilingual WordNet (OMW)11 En-
glish resource: the Princeton WordNet of English
(PWN) (Fellbaum, 1998). Considering the inte-
gration of OpenThesaurus in OdeNet means mak-
ing use of a large resource for German that is gen-
erated and updated by the crowd. A consequence
of this approach is that OdeNet needs to be cu-
rated. While generally automatically generated

9In a next step we will also consider the resource
lemonUby (Eckle-Kohler et al., 2015), which contains a
lemon representation of the German version of Omega-Wiki.
A dump of this resource can be downloaded at https:

entries have a confidence score of “0.7”, manually
curated entries get a score of “1.0”.

We downloaded the most recent version of
OdeNet from its GitHub page,12 and first analyzed
its content. The resource comes in an XML format
and shares its DTD with the other WordNets in
the Open Multilingual WordNet initiative.13 Lexi-
cal entries give information about the sense of the
lexeme, such as “Kernspaltung” or “Kernfission”
(nuclear fission), both sharing the same synset:14

<LexicalEntry id="w1">
<Lemma writtenForm="Kernspaltung"

partOfSpeech="n"/>
<Sense id="w1_1-n"

synset="odenet-1-n"/>
</LexicalEntry>
<LexicalEntry id="w2">

<Lemma writtenForm="Kernfission"
partOfSpeech="n"/>

<Sense id="w2_1-n"
synset="odenet-1-n"/>

</LexicalEntry>

Lexical senses are grouped in synsets, i.e., groups
of word senses with the same meaning. Hierarchi-
cal relations are introduced as synset relations:
<Synset id="odenet-1-n" ili="i107577"
partOfSpeech="n" dc:description="a

nuclear reaction in which a
massive nucleus splits into
smaller nuclei with the
simultaneous release of energy">

<SynsetRelation
target=’odenet-5437-n’
relType=’hypernym’/>

</Synset>

An example for the curated entry “Stuhl”: (chair):
<LexicalEntry id="w224"

confidenceScore="1.0">
<Lemma writtenForm="Stuhl"

partOfSpeech="n"/>
<Sense id="w224_49-n"

<Sense id="w224_1172-n"

synset="odenet-1172-n"/>
</LexicalEntry>

[’Sitz’, ’Platz’, ’Sitzplatz’,
’Sitzgelegenheit’]

>>> hyponyms("odenet-49-n")

[’Rolli’, ’Krankenfahrstuhl’,
’Rollstuhl’]),

odenet-20127-n:
[’Lehnsessel’, ’Fauteuil’]),
odenet-34983-n:
[’Lehnstuhl’, ’Polsterstuhl’,
’Polstersessel’, ’Sessel’, ...])]

3 OntoLex-Lemon

The OntoLex-Lemon model was originally devel-
oped with the aim to provide a rich linguistic
grounding for ontologies, meaning that the natu-
ral language expressions used in the description
of ontology elements are equipped with an exten-
sive linguistic description.15 This rich linguistic
grounding includes the representation of morpho-
logical and syntactic properties of lexical entries
as well as the syntax-semantics interface, i.e. the
meaning of these lexical entries with respect to an
ontology or to specialized vocabularies. The main
organizing unit for those linguistic descriptions is
the lexical entry, which enables the representation
of morphological patterns for each entry (a MWE,
a word or an affix). The connection of a lexical
entry to an ontological entity is marked mainly
by the denotes property or is mediated by the
LexicalSense or the LexicalConcept proper-
ties, as this is represented in Figure 1, which dis-
plays the core module of the model.

As stated in Section 1, OntoLex-Lemon builds
on and extends the lemon model. A major dif-
ference is that OntoLex-Lemon includes an ex-
plicit way to encode conceptual hierarchies, us-
ing the SKOS standard.16 As can be seen

15See (McCrae et al., 2012), (Cimiano et al., 2016) and
also https://www.w3.org/community/ontolex/
wiki/Final_Model_Specification.

16SKOS stands for “Simple Knowledge Organization Sys-

Figure 1: The core module of OntoLex-Lemon: Ontol-
ogy Lexicon Interface. Graphic taken from https:
//www.w3.org/2016/05/ontolex/.

in Figure 1, lexical entries can be linked, via
the ontolex:evokes property, to such SKOS
concepts, which can represent WordNet synsets.
This structure is paralleling the relation be-
tween lexical entries and ontological resources,
which is implemented either directly by the
ontolex:reference property or mediated by
the instances of the ontolex:LexicalSense
class.17 The ontolex:LexicalConcept
class seems to be best appropriated to model
the “sets of cognitive synonyms (synsets)”18 that
Princeton WordNet (PWN) describes, while the
ontolex:LexicalSense class is meant to
represent the bridge between lexical entries and
ontological entities (which do not necessarily have
semantic relations between them).

4 Mapping OdeNet to OntoLex-Lemon

A main issue with the original partly crowd-
sourced data for OdeNet was that additional tex-
tual information or special characters were added

tem”. SKOS provides “a model for expressing the basic struc-
ture and content of concept schemes such as thesauri, clas-
sification schemes, subject heading lists, taxonomies, folk-
sonomies, and other similar types of controlled vocabulary”
(https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/)

17Quoting from Section 3.6 “Lexical Concept” https:
//www.w3.org/2016/05/ontolex/: “We [...] cap-
ture the fact that a certain lexical entry can be used to denote
a certain ontological predicate. We capture this by saying
that the lexical entry denotes the class or ontology element
in question. However, sometimes we would like to express
the fact that a certain lexical entry evokes a certain mental
concept rather than that it refers to a class with a formal in-
terpretation in some model. Thus, in lemon we introduce the
class Lexical Concept that represents a mental abstraction,
concept or unit of thought that can be lexicalized by a given
collection of senses. A lexical concept is thus a subclass of
skos:Concept.”

by the crowd to the headwords. In order to clean
the data, we wrote a Python script, which not only
is filtering out noisy data, but also mapping cer-
tain GWN codes (like part of speech (PoS)) into
the vocabularies used in OntoLex-Lemon, like for
example the LexInfo vocabulary for PoS and se-
mantic relations.19

As for now, we have in the OntoLex-Lemon
encoding of OdeNet 120,012 lexical entries, the
same number of lexical senses and 36,192 synsets,
which are encoded as instances of the class
ontolex:LexicalConcept and included in
a SKOS-based conceptual hierarchy, supporting
also the description of lexical semantic relations
between synsets, like synonymy, hyponomy etc.
It is interesting to notice that 44,506 entries con-
tain a blank and can therefore be considered as
Multi Word Expressions. And if we add to this
figure all the 14,080 compound entries20 we note
that approximately half of the lexical entries in the
OntoLex-Lemon representation can be considered
as MWEs.

The following listings give some details on
the OntoLex-Lemon encoding of the first entry
in OdeNet, which is “Kernspaltung” (nuclear fis-
sion).

.

In Listing 1 we display the full OntoLex-
Lemon entry. One aspect that can be imme-
diately noted by the reader, is the possibility
to represent the components of the compound
word, which is encoded as being an instance of

19See https://www.lexinfo.net/ontology/
2.0/lexinfo and also (Cimiano et al., 2011).

20This figure was computed merely by compari-
son with the list of split nominal compounds offered
by the GermaNet project on its web page: http:
//www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/GermaNet/
documents/compounds/split_compounds_
from_GermaNet13.0.txt, We expect to have a
larger number of compounds by applying a decomposition
algorithm, not only to nominal entries.

the class ontolex:MultiWordExpression
(which in OntoLex-Lemon marks any type of
entries that can be segmented, thus including
compounds). This possibility is demonstrating
one of the added-value of linking synsets to the
(complex) representation of lexical entries, as we
can state (see below) semantic relations between
synsets associated to the components of a com-
pound word and its synsets.

Listing 2 below is displaying the form informa-
tion associated to the w1 entry in Listing 1.

Listing 2: The ontolex:Form Kernspaltung

.

Listing 3 is showing the conversion of the original
OdeNet sense information into an instance of the
ontolex:LexicalSense class.

Kernspaltung

.

In this code we can see how a sense can
be linked to a synset, via the property
ontolex:isLexicalizedSenseOf, while
the entry itself can be linked to the synset via the
property ontolex:evokes, as this is displayed
in Listing 1. The sense itself is also linking
(ontolex:reference) to an ontological
entity, here in the form of a Wikidata entry.

Listing 4 displays the representation of the
synset associated to both the w1 lexical entry
and the w1 1-n sense. There we can also
see that this lexical concept (synset) is also
“evoked” by other entries/senses. For example
by the entries for “Kernfission” or “Atomspal-
tung”, which are synonyms of “Kernspaltung”.
The lexinfo:hypernym property is provid-
ing the information on the semantic relation this
synset has to another synset.

Finally, in Listing 5 we display the “entries” for
the components of the compound word “Kernspal-
tung”. Those components are pointing to the
lexical entries they are related to (the entry
:entry w23527 is for example the one corre-
sponding to the noun “Spaltung” (split, fission,
separation, cleavage, etc.), which has again its
own senses and associated synsets. We can here
disambiguate the meaning of “Spaltung” as used
in the compound, as being the one of “fission”.
And the whole compound can then be considered
as an hyponym of the synset for “fission”.

Listing 5: The two components of the entry Kernspal-
tung
: Kern comp

r d f : t y p e decomp : Component ;
decomp : c o r r e s p o n d s T o : en t ry w3542 ;

.

r d f : t y p e decomp : Component ;
decomp : c o r r e s p o n d s T o : en t ry w23527 ;

.

In Listing 1 above, we can see the information on
the sequence those components have in this en-
try. For sure, those component “entries” can be
re-used separately for other compound, like for
example for “Atomspaltung”. So that we can col-
lect all the corresponding meanings of a word, also
when they are used in compounds, also in depen-
dency of their position in the compounds. Details
on the decomposition module of OntoLex-Lemon
are shown in Figure 2.

In this section we described the current state
of the OntoLex-Lemon representation of the data
we can find in the OdeNet resource. But we also
touched the possible use of OntoLex-Lemon for
bridging WordNet-like resources and full lexical
descriptions, concentrating in the above section on
the topic of German compound nouns. In the next
section we present the morphological resource we
mapped onto OntoLex-Lemon in order to be able

Figure 2: The Decomposition module of OntoLex-
Lemon. Graphic taken from https://www.w3.
org/2016/05/ontolex/.

to link OdeNet elements to a full morphological
description.

5 MMORPH

As mentioned in Section 1 we work with an
updated German version of MMORPH (Petit-
pierre and Russell, 1995), which covers also
English, Spanish, French and Italian morphol-
ogy. Our German version of MMORPH contains
over 2,630,000 full-forms, and has specifically
improved the coverage of compounds compared
to the original German version of MMORPH.
MMORPH presents its data in a well structured
fashion, as the (simplified) example for the noun
”Kernspaltung” (nuclear fission) below demon-
strates:

Listing 6: The MMORPH entry for Kernspaltung
” k e r n s p a l t u n g ” =

” k e r n s p a l t u n g ” Noun [ ge nd e r =fem
number= s i n g u l a r c a s e =nom | gen | d a t | acc ]

” k e r n s p a l t u n g e n ” =
” k e r n s p a l t u n g ” Noun [ ge nd e r =fem

number= p l u r a l c a s e =nom | gen | d a t | acc ]

We wrote a script in order to transform the
MMORPH data into OntoLex-Lemon, in its
turtle syntax serialization.21 We made use for
this of the Python rdflib module,22 which sup-
ports the generation of RDF-graphs in rdf:xml,
json-ld or turtle formats. As for nouns, out of
349,874 original full forms 67,717 instances of
the ontolex:LexicalEntry class have been

generated, and 224,439 instances of the class
ontolex:Form. 67,717 forms are referred
to as a ontolex:canonicalForm (one for
each lexical entry). We have 27,387 adjectives
as instances of the ontolex:LexicalEntry
class, and 474.459 instances of the class
ontolex:Form. This figure shows the high
number of morphological variants for adjectives in
German (447,072 forms are marked with the prop-
erty ontolex:otherForm).

6 Linking the OdeNet Resource to the
MMORPH Resource

We see the use of OntoLex-Lemon for represent-
ing WordNets as a chance to not only port in-
formation from one format to another (with the
possibility to publish WordNets in the Linguistic
Linked Open Data cloud), but also as an opportu-
nity to extend the coverage of WordNet descrip-
tions to more complex lexical phenomena, beyond
lemma and PoS considerations. One case we have
been studying concerns the morphological specifi-
cation of MWEs included in OdeNet.

As we could see, there are more than a sig-
nificant number of MWEs in OdeNet, being
compounds or “phrasal entries”, like for exam-
ple “Rotkohl” (purple cabbage or red cabbage),
“Rotkraut” (red kraut or red cabbage), “rote Bete”
(beetroot), or “geistiges Eigentum” (intellectual
property). A note on those examples: While
“Rotkraut” and “Rotkohl” are essentially pointing
to the same vegetable,23, the word “Rotkraut” is
typically used only in its singular form.24 The
same remark for the MWE “geistiges Eigen-
tum”.25

There is no way in the original OdeNet (or in
general in PWN or other WordNets) to explicitly
formulate this restriction, that an entry can be used

23See for this the OpenThesaurus: https://www.
openthesaurus.de/synonyme/Rotkohl or Duden:
https://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/
Rotkohl.

24See for this Wiktionary: https://de.
wiktionary.org/wiki/Rotkraut or Duden:
https://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/
Rotkraut where only the singular forms are
listed. Wiktionary indicates a plural for “Rotkohl”
(https://de.wiktionary.org/wiki/Rotkohl).

25It is interesting to note that neither Duden nor CanooNet
have an entry for such MWEs like “rote Bete” or “geistiges
Eigentum”, but Wiktionary and OdeNet include such MWEs
as entries. We guess that a lexicography view is dedicated
to include only words, also resulting from word formation
processes, as entries, while the other dictionary tradition is
more closely related to the description of meanings.

only in singular. It is possible in PWN though to
get the information that a concept is only lexical-
ized by a plural form, by just querying for a plural
form, like for example “peoples”. If this plural
form is not reduced exclusively to its lemma, then
a synset for it will be returned, together with the
synsets for the singular form, as can be seen in the
following listing, where the plural form is high-
lighted26:

Listing 7: The Synsets for “people” vs. “peoples”

But it is to be noticed, that when the user is query-
ing for “people”, the synset for the plural form
“peoples” will not be displayed.

The example of the OntoLex-Lemon represen-
tation of the German adjective “rot” (red) dis-
played in Listing 8 is introduced in order to give
an idea of the complexity of the inflectional vari-
ants for a German adjective, whereas we do not
include the form variants that are conditioned by
the preceding use of a definite or an indefinite de-
terminer.

of the noun “Bete” (beet)27, as represented in
OntoLex-Lemon.

Listing 9: The MMORPH entry for Bete (beet) and its

resentation

But even if we can limit the number of forms for
the noun “Bete”, we have to combine those with
the possible forms of “rot”, and also consider the
possible use of a preceding indefinite or definite
determiner. This gives us 32 forms to be con-
sidered, compared to the maximum of 8 different
forms if we deal with a nominal compound like
“Rotkohl”. And in fact, the OntoLex-Lemon link-
ing mechanisms allow us to precise only the “pos-
itive” adjectival forms, as “rot” can not appear in
this MWE as a comparative or superlative.

We have a similar situation with the entry
“geistiges Eigentum” (intellectual property)28 in
OdeNet. But there is another restriction, follow-
ing which this concept of intellectual property can
be used only in the singular form. We select from
the list of 24 possible forms of the adjective only
the “positive” ones (see Listing 10).

27The number of forms can be reduced as all forms in sin-
gular have the same ending, the same for the plural, so that
we do not need to list all different grammatical cases.

28We note that “intellectual property” is also a MWE entry
in PWN WordNet.

the links to the associated forms, which are not
displayed here, is shown in Listing 11

Listing 11: The MMORPH noun Eigentum (property)
with the corresponding form variants

.

One possibility would be to link the OdeNet entry
“geistiges Eigentum” to both the relevant forms
displayed just above in the Listings 10 and 11,
with an additional information on the word order-
ing and that only the singular forms can be se-
lected. This can be ensured by the use of the
ontolex:usage usage property. This solution
has the advantage that we do not have to intro-
duce the phrasal MWE in the MMORPH repre-
sentation corresponding to the OdeNet “geistiges
Eigentum”. But at the price of introducing some
rules, like the ordering of the words, an agreement
rule or the specific restriction that an OdeNet entry
has only singular forms for its lexicalization.

The other possibility is to introduce an entry for
the OdeNet MWE and the corresponding forms, as
this is shown in Listing 12

Listing 12: The OdeNet entry geistiges Eigentum (in-
tellectual property) pointing to all possible (singular)
forms
: l e x g e i s t i g e s e i g e n t u m

o n t o l e x : c a n o n i c a l F o r m

: f o r m g e i s t i g e s e i g e n t u m ;
o n t o l e x : o the rForm

: f o r m g e s i t i g e s e i g e n t u m g e n s i n g u l a r ;
o n t o l e x : usage l e x i n f o : s i n g u l a r ;

.

In this example we included the decompo-
sition information, including the ordering of
the components. We also included the line
ontolex:usage lexinfo:singular,
which can be considered as redundant as we
already selected as ontolex:otherForm all



29

the singular forms, discarding thus the (possible)
plural forms.

As a purely morphological information source,
MMORPH does not have any sense or synset as-
sociated with its entries. Linking them to the
OdeNet resources is adding thus a conceptual view
to the MMORPH data. Additionally one can add
reference information by querying DBpedia29 or
Wikidata30 This can be done very easily by just
adding the line ontolex:denotes with the
corresponding URL pointing to an ontological ref-
erence.

7 Conclusion

We described our current work consisting in port-
ing a recently developed German WordNet com-
pliant lexical resource, OdeNet, to OntoLex-
Lemon, in order to support its publication in
the Linguistic Linked Open Data cloud. While
processing those data, we noticed that OntoLex-
Lemon can be used for bridging the WordNet type
of lexical resources to a full description of lexi-
cal entries, leading to an extension of the coverage
of WordNets beyond the consideration of lemmas
and PoS information. In order to test our intu-
ition, we ported an updated version of the German
MMORPH morphological analyzer to OntoLex-
Lemon and we established links between the two
new OntoLex-Lemon data sets. We documented
our interlinking work with the example of the full
morphological representation of components of
German compounds and MWEs used in OdeNet,
also being able to express usage restrictions.
