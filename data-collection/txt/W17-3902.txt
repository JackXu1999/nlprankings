Abstract

O Poeta Artificial is a bot that tweets poems, in Por-
tuguese, inspired by the latest Twitter trends. Built on
top of PoeTryMe, a poetry generation platform, so far
it had only produced poems based on a set of keywords
in tweets about a trend. This paper presents recently im-
plemented features for increasing the connection between
the produced text and the target trend through the reuti-
lisation and production of new text fragments, for high-
lighting the trend, paraphrasing text by Twitter users, or
based on extracted or inferred semantic relations.

1 Introduction

Poetry generation is a popular task at the intersection
of Computational Creativity and Natural Language
Generation. It aims at producing text that exhibits
poetic features at formal and content level, while, to
some extent, syntactic rules should still be followed
and a meaningful message should be transmitted, of-
ten through figurative language. Instead of generat-
ing a poem that uses a set of user-given keywords
or around an abstract concept, several poetry gener-
ators produce poetry inspired by a given prose docu-
ment. Besides the potential application to entertain-
ment, this provides a specific and tighter context for
assessing the poem’s interpretability.

This paper presents new features of O Poeta Arti-
ficial (Portuguese for “The Artificial Poet”), a com-
putational system that produces poems written in
Portuguese, inspired by the latest trends on the so-
cial network Twitter and, similarly to other creative
systems, posts them in the same network, through
the @poetartificial account. O Poeta Artificial is
built on top of PoeTryMe (Gonçalo Oliveira, 2012),

a poetry generation platform, and originally used
the latter for producing poetry from a set of fre-
quent keywords in tweets that mentioned the target
trend. O Poeta Artificial 2.0, hereafter shortened
to Poeta 2.0, resulted from recent developments on
the original version, aimed at increasing the inter-
pretability of its results through a higher connection
with the trend. The new features enable the reutilisa-
tion of fragments of human-produced tweets, possi-
bly with a word replaced by its synonym, as well as
the inclusion of fragments that highlight the trend,
or fragments obtained from relations extracted from
tweets about the trend, or even inferred from the lat-
ter. Produced poems may include some new frag-
ments and others produced by the original proce-
dure (hereafter, the classic way), based on the ex-
tracted keywords, while keeping a regular metre and
favouring the presence of rhymes.

The remainder of this paper starts with a brief
overview on poetry generation systems and creative
Twitter bots, followed by a short introduction to
PoeTryMe and how it is used by the Twitter bot. Af-
ter this, the new features of Poeta 2.0 are described,
with a strong focus on new kinds of fragments pro-
duced by this system. Before concluding, the results
of Poeta 2.0 are illustrated with some poems pro-
duced, using different kinds of fragments.

2 Related Work

Automatic poetry generators are a specific kind of
Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems where
the produced text exhibits poetic features, such
as a pre-defined metre and rhymes, together with
some level of abstraction and figurative language.



Many poetry generators have been developed and
described in the literature (see Gonçalo Oliveira
(2017b)), especially in the domain of Computational
Creativity. They are typically knowledge-intensive
intelligent systems that deal with several levels of
language, from lexical choice to semantics.

Several systems produce poetry based on given
stimuli, which can be a set of semantic predi-
cates (Manurung, 2003), one (Charnley et al., 2014)
or more seed words (Gonçalo Oliveira, 2012), a
prose description of a message (Gervás, 2001), or
a longer piece of text, such as blog posts (Misztal
and Indurkhya, 2014) or newspaper articles (Colton
et al., 2012; Rashel and Manurung, 2014; Toiva-
nen et al., 2014; Tobing and Manurung, 2015;
Gonçalo Oliveira and Alves, 2016). Longer docu-
ments used as inspiration can be reflected in the po-
ems through the use of keywords (Rashel and Ma-
nurung, 2014), associations (Toivanen et al., 2014),
phrases (Charnley et al., 2014), similes (Colton
et al., 2012), dependency (Tobing and Manurung,
2015) or semantic relations (Gonçalo Oliveira and
Alves, 2016) extracted from them, and may also
transmit the same sentiment (Colton et al., 2012) or
emotions (Misztal and Indurkhya, 2014). Poems are
typically built from templates, either handcrafted or
extracted from human-produced poems, then filled
with information from the inspiration document.

Twitter has become a popular platform for bots,
mostly because of its nature – many users posting
short messages (tweets), available on real time –
and its friendly API, which exposes much informa-
tion, easily used by computational systems. This is
also true for creative bots. Some use Twitter merely
as a showcase for exhibiting their results, possibly
enabling some kind of user interaction, liking or
retweeting. Those include, for instance, bots for
producing riddles (Guerrero et al., 2015) or Inter-
net Memes (Gonçalo Oliveira et al., 2016). Other
bots also exploit information on Twitter for pro-
ducing their contents. This happens, for instance,
for @poetartificial (Gonçalo Oliveira, 2016), which
produces poetry, in Portuguese, roughly inspired
by current trends, and is the focus of the follow-
ing sections. It is also the case of @Metaphor-
Magnet (Veale et al., 2015) and its “brother” bots,
who produce novel metaphors, through the same
generating mechanisms as a poetry generation sys-

tem (Veale, 2013), more focused on content and not
so much on form.

Despite the growing number of intelligent bots,
Twitter has many other bots, some of which
performing tasks that are typically in the do-
main of creativity, but through not so intelli-
gent and knowledge-poor processes. Those in-
clude @MetaphorMinute, which generates random
metaphors, or @pentametron, which retweets pair-
ings of random rhyming tweets, both with ten met-
rical syllables.

Besides bots, other creative systems produce con-
tent inspired by information circulating on Twitter,
including poetry. FloWr (Charnley et al., 2014) is a
platform for implementing creative systems, which
has been used for producing poetry by selecting
phrases from human-produced tweets, based on sen-
timent and theme, and organising them according
to a target metre and rhyme. TwitSonnet (Lamb et
al., 2017) builds poems with tweets retrieved with a
given keyword in a time interval, scored according
to the poetic criteria of: reaction (presence of words
that transmit a desired emotion), meaning (pres-
ence of given keywords and frequent tri-grams), and
craft (metre and rhyme, plus words with strong im-
agery). Several poems by TwitSonnet were posted
on Tumblr, another micro-blogging social network.
Instead of templates, the previous systems reuse
complete text fragments extracted from Twitter.

3 PoeTryMe and O Poeta Artificial

O Poeta Artificial (Gonçalo Oliveira, 2016) is
a Twitter bot that tweets poems written in Por-
tuguese and inspired by recent trends in the Por-
tuguese Twitter community. It is built on top of
PoeTryMe (Gonçalo Oliveira, 2012), a poetry gen-
eration platform with a modular architecture, so far
adapted to produce poetry in different languages and
from different stimuli.

PoeTryMe’s architecture, explained in detail else-
where (Gonçalo Oliveira et al., 2017), is based on
two core modules – a Generation Strategy and the
Lines Generator – and some complementary ones.
To some extent, a parallelism can be made between
this architecture and the traditional ‘strategy’ and
‘tactical’ components of a NLG system (Thompson,
1977). The Generation Strategy implements a plan



for producing poems according to user-given param-
eters. It may have different implementations and
interact with the Syllable Utils for metre scansion
and rhyme identification. The Lines Generator in-
teracts with a semantic network and a context-free
grammar for producing semantically-coherent frag-
ments of text, to be used as lines of a poem. Each
of those lines will generally use two words that, in
the semantic network, are connected by some rela-
tion R. Those words fill a line template, provided by
the grammar, which is generalised to suit all pairs of
words related by R. For instance, the line template
you’re the X of my Y can be used for render-
ing partOf relations, such as:
• estuary partOf river
→ you’re the estuary of my river

• periscope partOf submarine
→ you’re the periscope of my submarine

• fiber partOf personality
→ you’re the fiber of my personality

In most instantiations of PoeTryMe, a set of seed
words is provided as input for setting the poem do-
main. This constrains the semantic network to re-
lations that involve one of the seeds, with a proba-
bility of selecting also relations with indirectly re-
lated words (known as the ‘surprise factor’). There
is also a module for expanding the set of seeds with
structurally-relevant words, possibly constrained by
a target polarity (positive or negative). Though orig-
inally developed for Portuguese, poetry may also be
generated in Spanish or English, depending on the
underlying linguistic resources, namely the seman-
tic network, the lexicons and the grammars (Gonçalo
Oliveira et al., 2017).

O Poeta Artificial adds an initial layer for select-
ing the seed words to use. Before generation, it:
(i) Selects one of the top trends in the Portuguese
Twitter (the highest not used in the last three po-
ems); (ii) Retrieves recent tweets (currently, up to
200), written in Portuguese and mentioning the tar-
get trend; (iii) Processes each tweet and extracts
every content word used; (iv) Selects top frequent
content words (currently, 4) to be used as seeds;
(v) May expand the seeds, either according to the
main sentiment of the tweets (based on the pres-
ence of emoticons) or, if there is a Wikipedia article
about the trend, with content words from its abstract.
PoeTryMe is then used for producing 25 poems from

the seeds, following a generate-and-test strategy at
the line level. The poem with the highest score for
metre and presence of rhymes is tweeted.

In the original version of O Poeta Artificial, the re-
sult was always a block of four lines, generally with
10 syllables each, and with occasional rhymes. Due
to their generation process, lines were syntactically-
correct and semantically coherent, but the connec-
tion with the trend was often too shallow. For in-
stance, as the trend is typically a hashtag or a named
entity, it is not in the semantic network and thus
never used in the poem. The following section de-
scribes recent developments towards a higher con-
nection with the trend, thus contributing to an im-
proved meaningfulness.

4 Poeta Artificial 2.0: beyond seed words

Poeta 2.0 aims at improving the meaningfulness of
the original bot by increasing the connection of the
produced poems with the target trend and with what
people are saying about it.

A minor improvement occurs in the seed selection
process. Instead of relying exclusively on the fre-
quency of each content word in the tweets, Poeta 2.0
divides it by its frequency in a large Portuguese cor-
pus (Santos and Bick, 2000). This aims to use more
relevant words, and can be seen as an application of
the tf.idf weighting scheme.

Yet, the main feature of Poeta 2.0 is that, besides
seed words, it also provides a set of pre-generated
text fragments to PoeTryMe, somehow connected to
the target trend and that may be used as poem lines.
For every line of the poem to fill, there is a probabil-
ity of using one of the generated fragments instead
of a line produced in the classic way, based on the se-
mantic network and generation grammar. This prob-
ability is proportional to the number of fragments of
this kind available for the target number of syllables.
One of the previous fragments is also used if it has
exactly the target number of syllables and rhymes
with one of the previously used lines.

Another new feature is that, based on the pro-
duced fragments, Poeta 2.0 sets the target length of
the poem lines, though having in mind the maximum
of 140 characters a tweet can contain. More pre-
cisely, it counts the number of syllables of each text
fragment produced and selects a number, between 5



and 10, for which there are more fragments avail-
able. Poems by Poeta 2.0 are still blocks of four
lines, but each line will have the selected number of
syllables or close.

The remainder of this section describes the differ-
ent types of text fragments that Poeta 2.0 produces,
namely fragments that highlight the trend, fragments
of the processed tweets, paraphrases of the former,
and fragments based on semantic relations. All are
put together in a set of usable fragments. PoeTryMe
will have no idea of how they were produced.

4.1 Fragments Highlighting the Trend

The first kind of fragments is based on a small set
of templates with a placeholder for the target trend,
each highlighting the latter by referring to it as a re-
cent topic that many people are talking about. Some
of those templates are shown in table 1, where T is
the trend placeholder.

andam a escrever/falar sobre T
(they are writing/talking about T )
hoje fala-se de T
(today, people are talking about T )
sobre T vim escrever
(about T I came to write)
interesse por T é global?
(interest for T is global)
T é tendência social
(T is a social trend)
T é um assunto recente
(T is a recent topic)
fala de T muita gente!
(many people chatting about T )
T , porque falam de ti?
(T , why do they chat about you?)
T , T , e T
(T , T , and T )

Table 1: Examples of trend-highlighting templates.

4.2 Fragments of Tweets

Similarly to other systems (Charnley et al., 2014;
Lamb et al., 2017), Poeta 2.0 may reuse text from
human-produced tweets. Recall that, in order to
select the most relevant words for the target trend,
200 tweets written in Portuguese and mentioning
this trend are used as an inspiration set. Among
the processing steps, those tweets are broken into
smaller units, when possible, following simple rules,
such as line breaks or punctuation signs. Each of
the obtained units is added to the set of fragments

Original fragment:
Salvador com dúvidas em aceitar
(Salvador with doubts whether to accept)
Synonyms:
dúvidas = {indecisões, hesitações, incertezas}
(doubts = {indecisions, hesitations, uncertainties}))
aceitar = {aprovar, acatar, adoptar}
(accept = {aprove, obey, adopt})
Paraphrases:
Salvador com indecisões em aceitar
Salvador com hesitações em aceitar
Salvador com incertezas em aceitar
Salvador com dúvidas em aprovar
Salvador com dúvidas em acatar
Salvador com dúvidas em adoptar

Table 2: Tweet and some generated paraphrases.

provided to PoeTryMe. The main difference be-
tween Poeta 2.0 and other poetry generators that use
human-written tweets is that Poeta 2.0 mixes them
with the other kinds of fragments it produces.

4.3 Paraphrases of Tweets
Besides human-written tweets, Poeta 2.0 produces
variations of them. More precisely, it retrieves syn-
onyms of the content words in the previous frag-
ments from PoeTryMe’s semantic network, and pro-
duces new fragments by replacing each content word
with one of its synonyms. Poeta 2.0 may thus find
alternative ways of expressing the same messages
humans did, possibly also covering a wider range of
metres. This has similarities with Tobing and Ma-
nurung (2015), though Poeta 2.0 does not perform
word sense disambiguation because PoeTryMe’s se-
mantic network is not organised in word senses. Al-
though some issues may result from ambiguity, we
prefer to think that, though not completely inten-
tional, using synonyms that only apply for other
senses may create interesting domain shifts. Table 2
illustrates this procedure for a specific fragment.

In order to avoid poems where all lines paraphrase
each other, a maximum of 5 paraphrases are gener-
ated for each content word in a fragment. If a word
has more than 5 synonyms, 5 are randomly selected.

4.4 Semantic Relation-based Fragments
In order to keep the philosophy behind PoeTryMe,
the natural way of increasing interpretability would
be to extract semantic relations from the tweets men-
tioning the trend and adding them to the set of rela-
tions to use. To some extent, we kept this philoso-



phy, but we also wanted Poeta 2.0 to be independent
from the core of PoeTryMe. This enables the extrac-
tion of relations of different types, more focused on
Twitter text, on the trends, and possibly not so well-
defined, which can be managed without changing
PoeTryMe. The same happens for a new set of line
templates based on the extracted relations, smaller
but more controlled than the line templates covered
by PoeTryMe’s grammars, most of which acquired
automatically from collections of poetry.

Another important reason for this decision is that,
in Portuguese, determiners, adjectives and other
words are declined according to gender and num-
ber. In PoeTryMe, this is handled by a morphology
lexicon and different grammar productions are still
required, depending on the gender and number of the
related words. Yet, while the same lexicon could be
used for acquiring the gender and number of nouns
or adjectives extracted from Twitter, it would not
cover all the trends, which are typically named en-
tities, or hashtags. Therefore, the templates for the
Twitter relations are, as much as possible, gender
and number independent, and only consider these at-
tributes when they can be obtained from PoeTryMe.

In order to produce text fragments based on se-
mantic relations involving the trend, Poeta 2.0 re-
lies primarily on a small set of line templates com-
patible with each of the covered semantic relations.
Yet, it goes further and combines the extracted re-
lations with the relations in PoeTryMe’s semantic
network for inferring new relations and increasing,
once again, the set of available fragments. The fol-
lowing sections describe the three steps involved in
the production of relation-based fragments: extrac-
tion, inference, and text generation.

4.4.1 Relation Extraction
Since Hearst (1992) proposed a set of lexical-

syntactic patterns for the automatic acquisition of
hyponym-hypernym pairs from text, much work has
targeted the automatic extraction of semantic rela-
tions from text, sometimes with much more sophis-
ticated approaches. Yet, when recall is not critical,
one of the arguments is fixed (the trend), and we are
focused on a closed set of relation types, relying on
a small set of lexical-syntactical patterns is proba-
bly the fastest way for achieving this goal. More-
over, it avoids the need for large quantities of en-

coded knowledge and provides higher control on the
results than for machine learning approaches.

Currently, four different relation types are ex-
tracted from the inspiration tweets. This is per-
formed with the help of a small set of patterns, re-
vealed in table 3 and with possible results illustrated
in table 4. In both tables, T stands for the trend, and
a rough translation of the patterns, from Portuguese
to English, is provided.

The extracted relations – isA, hasProperty, has,
can – are tied to the extraction patterns but are not
as semantically well-defined as relations in a word-
net or ontology. Yet, as long as we are aware of this
in the following steps, it is not a critical issue.

4.4.2 Relation Inference
Based on the extracted relations, implicit in the

text, other relations are inferred, when combined
with relations in PoeTryMe’s semantic network. For
Portuguese, the network currently used includes
all the relations in at least two out of nine Por-
tuguese lexical-semantic knowledge bases, includ-
ing wordnets and dictionaries (Gonçalo Oliveira,
2017a). Therefore, it covers a rich set of rela-
tion types including not only synonymy, hyper-
nymy and partOf, but also others, such as isSaid-
OfWhatDoes (in Portuguese, dizSeDoQue), isSaid-
About (dizSeSobre), hasQuality (temQualidade), has-
State (temEstado), antonymyOf (antonimoDe), is-
Part/Member/MaterialOf (parte/membro/materialDe),
and isPartOfWhatIs (parteDeAlgoComPropriedade),
which are exploited by Poeta 2.0

A set of rules was handcrafted for inferring new
relations from a combination of one relation ex-
tracted from the tweets and another in PoeTryMe’s
semantic network. Although more inference rules
may be defined in the future, possibly exploiting ad-
ditional relations, the current rules are in figure 1.
Again, the inferred relations are not as well-defined
as those in a wordnet. Some are of the same types as
the relations originally extracted, but new types are
introduced (e.g. isLike, isNot, withQuality, with-
State, mayCause), some of which may result in
metaphors or less obvious connections, and are thus
useful for poetry generation. Table 5 illustrates some
of the previous rules with examples of relations ex-
tracted, known (i.e. in PoeTryMe’s semantic net-
work), and inferred.



Pattern Relation

4.4.3 Semantic Relations as Text

Both extracted and inferred relations are used for
producing text fragments by filling, with the rela-
tion arguments, a small set of handcrafted templates,
compatible with each relation type. Table 6 illus-
trates this with examples of fragments produced for
a set of relations. Some fragments use both relation
arguments, while others only use the second argu-
ment, and not the trend, to avoid much repetition.

5 Examples

This section presents some poems produced by
Poeta 2.0, their rough English translations, and a
short discussion on the fragments used. Despite
the new features introduced, sometimes, poems still
have all of their lines generated in the classic way.
This happens especially when no tweets are reused,
possibly due to their long size, and when no relations
are extracted. The following poem is of this kind:



Relation Example fragments
Bruno Mars isA rei ser rei como Bruno Mars (being a king like Bruno Mars)

por ser rei (for being a king)
Centeno hasProperty brilhante quero ser brilhante como Centeno (I want to be brilliant like Centeno)

dizem que é brilhante (people say he’s brilliant)
Lorde has talento Lorde tem talento (Lorde has talent)

tem mesmo talento! (she really has talent!)
Adele can cantar a cantar como Adele (singing like Adele)

dizem que sabe cantar! (people say she knows how to sing!)
Centeno isLike luminosidade Centeno lembra a luminosidade (Centeno resembles brightness)

com uma luminosidade tal (with such a brightness)
Lula withQuality sinceridade a sinceridade do Lula (Lula’s sincerity)

a demonstrar sinceridade (showing sincerity)
Lula isNot hipócrita Lula não será hipócrita (Lula is probably not a hipocrit)

nada hipócrita (not a hipocrit)
Manuel Serrão is pensante Manuel Serrão parece pensante (Manuel Serrão seems to be a thinker)

também quero ser pensante (I also want to be a thinker)
Manuel Serrão mayCause pensamento como o pensamento de Manuel Serrão? (Iike Manuel Serrão’s thought?)

a gerar pensamento (generating a thought)

Figure 1: Rules for relation inference

delatar sempre causa delação
delação negra sem acusação
acusação em meia delação
sem achar cita, nem citação

To denounce always causes denunciation
Black denunciation without accusation
Accusation in half denunciation
Without quotation or citation

It was generated for the trend Carlos Alexandre,
the name of a Portuguese judge in charge of sev-

eral cases with great public impact. All lines rhyme
and all have 10 syllables, except the last, which
has only 9. The seeds collected from the tweets
were delação (denunciation), advogada (lawyer),
telefónica (of telephone), cita (citation). The first
line was produced from the semantic relation ‘de-
latar causes delação’, the second and third from
‘acusação synonymOf delação’, and the fourth from
‘citação synonymOf cita’.

The following example was produced on the
morning of 4th of June 2017, after the attacks at
London Bridge, when there was a trending hashtag
#LondonBridge:

fala de #LondonBridge muita gente!
O universo é mesmo doente
Polı́cia procura suspeitosos
Polı́cia procura duvidosos

Many people talking about
#LondonBridge!

The universe is really sick
Police searching for suspects
Police searching for dubious

All the lines have 10 syllables, except the first,
because the syllable division tool considered the #
as a syllable. Every line ends in rhyme: the first pair
of lines ends in -ente and the second in -osos. The
first line highlights the trend and the remaining are
paraphrases of the following fragments from human-
written tweets:

O mundo é mesmo doente (The world is really sick)

Polı́cia procura suspeitos (Police looking for suspects)

The next example was produced for the trend
Rui Santos, a Portuguese football commentator, two
days after Benfica won the Portuguese Football



Cup (30th May 2017). It uses three lines based on
relations extracted from the processed tweets:

Rui Santos consegue falar
também posso ser miliar?
também quero ser miliar
seboso a par, par a par

Rui Santos can speak
can I be very small as well?
I also want to be very small
greasy at hand, parwise

All of its lines have 8 syllables and all have the
same termination. The first line was produced from
the relation ‘Rui Santos can falar’ (talk), extracted
from more than one tweet, including the following:
No lugar do Rui Vitória deixava o seboso do Rui Santos a falar
sozinho com o seu troféu.
(If I were Rui Vitória, I would leave greasy Rui Santos talking alone
with his trophy)

Another relation is ‘Rui Santos has dimensão’ (di-
mension), extracted from:
Rui Santos tem dimensão para o Sporting. É pequenino.
(Rui Santos has dimension for Sporting. He is little.)

The second and third lines of the poem were pro-
duced from the relation ‘Rui Santos is miliar’ (very
small), inferred from the previous, due to the rela-
tion ‘dimensão isPartOfWhatIs miliar’.

The final example was produced for the trend
Ronaldo, one day after the football player Cris-
tiano Ronaldo won the fourth European Champions
League of his career (5th June 2017). It mixes dif-
ferent kinds of fragments:
Ronaldo é muito falado
arte e dança amor calado
num estado de felicidade
Ronaldo mostra simplicidade

Ronaldo is widely spoken
art and dance silent love
in a state of happiness
Ronaldo shows simplicity

All lines have 9 syllables, with two rhymes: the
first pair ends in -ado and the second in -ade.
The first line highlights the trend. Due to a
video of Ronaldo dancing, one of the seeds ex-
tracted was dança (dance), which originated the
second line, based on the relation ‘arte hyperny-
mOf dança’. The remaining lines result from two
relations: ‘Ronaldo withQuality simplicidade’ (in-
ferred from ‘Ronaldo hasProperty feliz’ and ‘fe-
liz hasState felicidade’), and ‘Ronaldo withQuality
simples’ (inferred from ‘Ronaldo hasProperty sim-
ples’ and ‘simples hasQuality simplicidade’).

6 Concluding Remarks

In order to increase the connection between poems
by a Twitter bot and a recent trend, more meaning-
ful text fragments are now produced and, when pos-

sible, used in the poems. This paper described the
production of those fragments.

The first impression of the poems now generated
is positive, which is also shown by the examples in-
cluded in this paper. Some poems are still produced
in the classic way, where the only connection be-
tween lines and trend is the presence of associated
words in semantically-coherent sentences. Yet, sev-
eral have now lines that highlight the trend, lines that
are built from relations involving the trend, or lines
that reuse text by other users about the trend, thus
making them more meaningful. Each kind of frag-
ments may be further augmented, for instance, by
exploiting additional patterns and semantic relations
in the tweets, but the manual labour involved is a
practical issue, as it may become quite complex to
manage all the patterns and inference rules.

Another limitation is that the semantic relation-
based fragments have to be gender and number in-
dependent. This may be minimised in the future,
if the determiners frequently used before the trends
are considered for identifying the previous proper-
ties. Yet, as there are other kinds of fragments, other
relations, and poems only have four lines, this is cur-
rently not critical.

Most limitations of PoeTryMe (Gonçalo Oliveira
et al., 2017) are also present. For instance, despite
targeting the same semantic domain, lines are gener-
ated independently of each other, not always result-
ing in the most logical sequence. This could be min-
imised if a reordering procedure was applied, similar
to the one by Lamb et al. (2017), where abstraction
and imagery are considered.

The extraction of long-term information on the
trend may also be improved. Currently, if the trend
has a Wikipedia article, associations are extracted
from its abstract. In the future, relations may be ex-
tracted directly from DBPedia.

A final issue, not yet discussed, is that the sys-
tem may reuse fragments that contain typos, thus de-
creasing the quality of the poems. Of course, every
word could be spellchecked and words with typos
could be corrected, possibly to a different word than
it should be, or their fragments could be discarded,
possibly with many false positives.

As it happened for the original bot, every
two hours, Poeta 2.0 tweets through the account
@poetartificial, which has about 260 followers.
