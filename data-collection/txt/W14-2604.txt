Abstract

In this paper, we discuss how domain-
specific noun polarity lexicons can be in-
duced. We focus on the generation of
good candidates and compare two ma-
chine learning scenarios in order to estab-
lish an approach that produces high pre-
cision. Candidates are generated on the
basis of polarity preferences of adjectives
derived from a large domain-independent
corpus. The polarity preference of a word,
here an adjective, reflects the distribution
of positive, negative and neutral arguments
the word takes (here: its nominal head).
Given a noun modified by some adjectives,
a vote among the polarity preferences of
these adjectives establishes a good indica-
tor of the polarity of the noun. In our ex-
periments with five domains, we achieved
f-measure of 59% up to 88% on the basis
of two machine learning approaches car-
ried out on top of the preference votes.

1 Introduction

Polarity lexicons are crucial for fine-grained sen-
timent analysis. For instance, in approaches
carrying out sentiment composition (Moilanen
and Pulman, 2007), where phrase-level polar-
ity is composed out of word level polarity (e.g.
disappointed− hope+ → NP−). However, often
freely available lexicons are domain-independent,
which is a problem with domain-specific texts,
since lexical gaps reduce composition anchors.
But how many domain-specific words do we have
to expect? Is it a real or rather a marginal problem?
In our experiments, we found that domain-specific
nouns do occur quite often - so they do matter. In
one of our domains, we identified about 1000 neg-
ative nouns, 409 were domain-specific. In that do-
main, the finance sector, more than 13’000 noun

types exist that do not occur at all in the DeWac
corpus - a large Web corpus (in German) with over
90 Million sentences. Thus, most of them must
be regarded as domain-specific. It would be quite
time-consuming to go through all of them in order
to identify and annotate the polar ones. Could we,
rather, predict good candidates? We would need
polarity predictors - words that take other, polar
words e.g. as their heads. If they, moreover, had
a clear-cut preference, i.e. they mostly took one
kind of polar words, say negative, then they were
perfect predictors of the polarity of nouns. We
found that adjectives (e.g. acute) can be used as
such polarity predictors (e.g. acute mostly takes
negative nouns, denoted n−, e.g. acute pain)).

Our hypothesis is that the polarity prefer-
ences of adjectives are (more or less) domain-
independent. We can learn the preferences from
domain-independent texts and apply it to domain-
specific texts and get good candidates of domain-
specific polar nouns. Clearly, if the polarity pref-
erences of an adjective are balanced (0.33 for each
polarity), than the predictions could not help at all.
But if one polarity clearly prevails, we might even
get a good performance by just classifying the po-
larity of unknown nouns in a domain according to
the dominant polarity preference of the adjectives
they co-occur with.

In this paper, we show how to generate
such a preference model on the basis of a
large, domain-independent German corpus and
a domain-independent German polarity lexicon.
We use this model to generate candidate nouns
from five domain-specific text collections - rang-
ing from 3’200 up to 37’000 texts per domain.
In order to see how far an automatic induction
of a domain-specific noun lexicon could go, we
also experimented with machine learning scenar-
ios on the output of the baseline system. We ex-
perimented with a distributional feature setting on
the basis of unigrams and used the Maximum En-

18



tropy learner, Megam (Daumé III, 2004), to learn
a classifier. We also worked with Weka (Frank et
al., 2010) and features derived from the German
polarity lexicon. Both approaches yield significant
gains in terms of precision - so they realize a high-
precision scenario.

2 Inducing the Preference Model

We seek to identify adjectives which impose a
clear-cut polar preference on their head nouns.
The polarity preference of an adjective reflects the
distribution of positive, negative and neutral nouns
the adjective modifies given to some text corpus.
We used the domain-independent DeWac corpus
(Baroni M., 2009) comprising about 90 million
German sentences. We selected those adjectives
that frequently co-occurred with polar nouns from
PoLex, a freely available German polarity lexicon
(Clematide and Klenner, 2010). Since the original
polarity lexicon contained no neutral nouns, we
first identified 2100 neutral nouns and expanded
the lexicon1. Altogether 5’500 nouns were avail-
able, 2100 neutral, 2100 negative and 1250 pos-
itive. For each adjective, we counted how often
it took (i.e. modified) positive, negative or neu-
tral nouns in the DeWac corpus and determined
their polarity preferences for each class (positive,
negative and neutral). This way, 28’500 adjec-
tives got a probability distribution, most of them,
however, with a dominating neutral polarity pref-
erence. Two lexicons were derived from it: a pos-
itive and a negative polarity preference lexicon.

An adjective obeys a polar polarity preference if
the sum of its positive and negative polarity pref-
erences is higher than its neutral preference. If the
positive preference is higher than the negative, the
adjective is a positive polarity predictor, otherwise
it is a negative polarity predictor. This procedure
leaves us with 506 adjectives, 401 negative polar-
ity predictors and 105 positive polarity predictors.
Figure 1 shows some examples of negative polar-
ity predictors. It reveals that, for instance, the ad-
jective akut (acute) is mostly coupled with neg-
ative nouns (61.50%). Nouns not in PoLex that
co-occur with an adjective are not considered. We
assume that these unknown nouns of an adjective
follow the same distribution that we are sampling
from the known co-occurring nouns. Note that po-

1We searched for nouns that frequently co-occurred with
the same adjectives the polar nouns from the polarity lexicon
did and stopped annotating when we reached 2’100 neutral
nouns.

larity predictors not necessarily must have a prior
polarity itself. Actually, only 3 of the 12 adjectives
from Figure 1 do have a prior polarity (indicated as
n−). For instance, the adjective plötzlich (immedi-
ate) is not polar but has a negative polarity pref-
erence. The polarity preference of a word is not
useful in composition, it just reveals the empirical
(polar) context of the word. If, however, the polar-
ity of the context word is unknown, the preference
might license an informed polarity guess.

(n− denotes a negative noun from PoLex, aj an
adjective modifying an instance of n−)2:

ber of adj-noun types of the adjective aj for all
classes: positive (+), negative(-) and neutral (=).

3 Applying the Preference Model

We applied the preference model to texts from five
domains: banks (37’346 texts), transport (3221),

2This could be interpreted as the conditional probability
of a negative noun given the adjective.

19



insurance (4768), politics (3208) and pharma
(4790). These texts have been manually classified
over the last 15 years by an institute carrying out
media monitoring3, not only wrt. their domain,
but also wrt. target-specific polarity (we just use
the domain annotation, currently).

The polarity of a noun is predicted by the vote
of the adjectives it occurred with. The following
formula shows the polarity prediction pol+,−,= for
the class negative (pol−):

pol−(ni) = Ai ∗
∏

aj∈PM−∧∃(aj ,ni)
prefn−(aj)

Ai is the number of adjectives that modify the
noun ni in the domain-specific texts. PM− is the
set of adjectives from the polarity model (PM )
with a negative polarity preference and (aj , ni) is
true, if the adjective aj modifies the noun ni ac-
cording to the domain-specific documents.

4 Improving the Predictions

The preference model serves two purposes: it gen-
erates a list of candidates for polar nouns and it
establishes a baseline. We experimented with two
feature settings in order to find out whether we
could improve on these results.

In the first setting, the WK setting, we wanted to
exploit the fact that for some adjectives that mod-
ify a noun, we know their prior polarity (from the
polarity lexicon). These adjectives do not nec-
essarily have a clear positive or negative polarity
preference. If not, then they are not used in the
prediction of the noun polarity.

But could the co-occurrence of a noun with ad-
jectives bearing a prior polarity also be indicative
of the noun polarity? For instance, if a noun is
coupled frequently and exclusively with negative
adjectives. Does this indicate something? Ones
intuition might mislead, but a machine learning
approach could reveal correlations. We used Sim-
ple Logistic Regression (SRL) from Weka and the
following features:

1. the number of positive adjectives with a prior
polarity that modify the noun

2. the number of negative adjectives with a prior
polarity that modify the noun

3We would like to thank the fög institute (cf.
www.foeg.uzh.ch/) for these data (mainly newspaper texts in
German).

3. the difference between 1) and 2): absolute
and ratio

4. the ratio of positive and negative adjectives

5. two binary features indicating the majority
class

6. three features for the output of the prefer-
ence model: the positive, negative and neu-
tral scores: pol−, pol+, pol=, respectively.

In the second setting, the MG setting, we trained
Megam, a Maximum Entropy learner, among the
following lines: we took all polar nouns from
PoLex and extracted from the DeWac corpus all
sentences containing these nouns. For each noun,
all (context) words (nouns, adjectives, verbs) co-
occurring with it in these sentences are used as
bag of words training vectors. In other words, we
learned a tri-partite classifier to predict the polarity
class (positive, negative or neutral) given a target
noun and its context, i.e. those nouns co-occurring
with it in a text collection.

5 Experiments

The goal of our experiments were the prediction
of positive and negative domain-specific nouns in
five domains. We used our preference model to
generate candidates. Then we manually annotated
the results in order to obtain a domain-specific
gold standard. We evaluated the output of the
preference model relative to the new gold stan-
dards and we run our experiments with Megam
and Weka’s Simple Logistic Regression (SRL).
Megam and Weka’s SLR were trained on the basis
of the positive, negative and neutral nouns from
PoLex and the DeWac corpus.

Figure 3 shows the results. #PM gives the num-
ber of nouns predicted by the preference model
to be negative (e.g. 220 in the politics domain).
These are the nouns we annotated for polarity
and that formed our gold standard afterwards (e.g.
75.90 out of 110 predicted are true negative nouns
and are kept as the gold standard). Since the gen-
eration of the gold standard is based on the prefer-
ence model’s output, its recall is 1. We cannot fix
the real recall since this would require to manu-
ally classify all nouns occurring in those texts (e.g.
13’000 in the banks domain). However, since we
wanted to compare the machine learning perfor-
mance with the preference model, we had to mea-

sure recall, otherwise we could not determine the
overall performance.

From Figure 3 we can see that the preference
model (PM) performs best in terms of f-measure
(in bold). Of course, recall (i.e. 1, not shown) is
idealized, since we took the output of the prefer-
ence model to generate the gold standard. Note
however that this was our premise, that we needed
an approach that delivers good candidates, other-
wise we were lost given the vast amount of can-
didate nouns (e.g. remember the 13’000 nouns in
the finance sector).

Figure 4: Domain-specific Negative Nouns

Figure 4 shows examples of negative nouns
from two domains: banks and pharma. But: are all
found nouns domain-specific negative nouns? In
the bank domain, we have manually annotated for
domain specificity: out of 1013 nouns predicted
to be negative by the model, 409 actually were
domain-specific (40.3 %)4. The other nouns could
also be in a domain-independent polarity lexicon.

Now, we turn to the prediction of positive
domain-specific nouns. It is not really surpris-
ing that the preference model is unbalanced - that
there are far more negative than positive polarity
predictors: 401 compared to 105. PoLex, the pool

451 of the 131 (38.93%) as positive classified nouns actu-
ally were domain-specific.

of nouns used for learning of the polarity prefer-
ences already is unbalanced (2100 negative com-
pared to 1250 positive nouns). Also, the major-
ity of the texts in our five domains are negative
(all texts are annotated for document-level polar-
ity). It is obvious then that our model is better
in the prediction of negative than positive polarity.
Actually, our base model comprising 105 positive
polarity predictors does not trigger often within
the whole corpus. For instance, only 10 predic-
tions were made in the banks domain, despite the
37’346 texts. Clearly, newspaper texts often are
critical and thus more negative than positive vo-
cabulary is used. This explains the very low recall.

However, what if we relaxed our model? If we,
for example, keep those adjectives in our model
that have a positive polarity preference > 0.35, at
least 35 out of 100 nouns co-occurring with those
adjectives should be positive.

D5 135 76.2 174 71.2 58 87.9 40 82.5

Figure 5: Prediction of Positive Nouns

We report the results of two runs. The first one,
labelled #1, where adjectives are used to predict a
positive noun polarity if they have a positive po-
larity preference > 0.35 and where the negative
polarity preference is < 0.1. In the second run, la-
belled #2, we only require the positive preference
to be > 0.35. Table 5 shows the results. We also
show the results of Weka (label #3) and Megam
(label #4) for the candidates generated by #2.

Compared to the negative settings, the number
of found positive nouns is rather low. For instance,
in the banks domain, 174 nouns were suggested
compared to 1013 negative ones. However, pre-
cision has not dropped and it is especially higher
than the threshold value of 0.35 seemed to indi-
cate (as discussed previously). Weka (#3) and
Megam (#4) again show better precision, however

21



the number of found nouns is too low (in a setting
that suffers already from low numbers). Figure 6
shows a couple of found positive nouns.

Figure 6: Predicted Positive Nouns

So far, we have discussed a binary approach
where each class (positive, negative) was predicted
and classified independently and where especially
no adjectives with a neutral preference where con-
sidered. What happens if we include these adjec-
tives? The results are given in Figure 7.

insurance 132 66.66 0 0

Figure 7: Unrestricted Prediction of Noun Polarity

Although precision is good, the results are very
conservative, e.g. in the banks domain, only 288
nouns were found compared to 1013 nouns given
the binary mode. Recall and f-measure are lower
compared to the binary setting. The huge amount
of neutral preference adjectives (about 28’000)
seems to neutralize polar tendencies. But even
then, some predictions survive - so these contexts
seem to be strong.

6 Related Work

The expansion or creation of sentiment lexicons
has been investigated in many variations from dif-
ferent perspectives and for various goals. Liu
and Zhang (2012) subdivide the work in this field
into three groups: manual approaches, dictionary-
based approaches and corpus-based approaches.
While the manual approach is time-consuming, it
is still often used to create core lexicons which are
not domain-specific, e.g. (Taboada et al., 2011).

The dictionary-based approaches which are also
called thesaurus-based approaches (Huang et al.,
2014) try to make use of existing dictionaries or
thesauri like WordNet (e.g. (Esuli and Sebastiani,
2006; Baccianella et al., 2010; Neviarouskaya et
al., 2011)) while the corpus-based approaches rely
on statistical measures based on different con-
cepts, for example, sentiment consistency (Hatzi-
vassiloglou and McKeown, 1997), pointwise mu-
tual information (Turney, 2002), context co-
herency (Kanayama and Nasukawa, 2006), double
propagation (Qiu et al., 2011) or label propagation
(Huang et al., 2014). Our approach is based on the
use of an existing dictionary and of an domain-
independent corpus. But rather than using the cor-
pus to directly detect new entries for the lexicon,
we use it to derive the polarity preference of adjec-
tives which in turn is used to generate candidates
from the domain-specific corpus.

The model most similar to our approach is
(Klenner and Petrakis, 2014), where the contex-
tual and prior polarity of nouns is learned from the
polarity preference of verbs for the verb’s direct
object. However, no attempt is made to induce
domain-specific polarity as we do. We also fo-
cus on the polarity preference of adjectives and we
also try to improve precision by machine learning.

7 Conclusions

We have introduced a plain model for the in-
duction of domain-specific noun lexicons. First,
the polarity preferences of adjectives are learned
from domain-independent text and from a gen-
eral polarity lexicon. A voting approach then pre-
dicts noun polarity from adjective noun pairings
sampled from domain-specific texts. The predic-
tions based only on adjectives acting as positive
or negative polarity predictors perform astonish-
ingly well. Machine Learning can be used to im-
prove precision at the cost of recall. Our approach
thus even might be useful for fully automatic gen-
eration of a high precision, domain-specific prior
noun polarity lexicons.

In future work, we will apply our approach to
other languages than German. We then will also
have to cope with multiword expressions as well,
since compounds not longer - as in German - come
as single words. We also would like to carry out
an extrinsic evaluation in order to see how big the
impact of an induced domain-specific lexicon on
polarity text classification actually is.
