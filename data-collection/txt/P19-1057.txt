Abstract

Existing argumentation datasets have suc-
ceeded in allowing researchers to develop
computational methods for analyzing the con-
tent, structure and linguistic features of argu-
mentative text. They have been much less
successful in fostering studies of the effect
of “user” traits — characteristics and beliefs
of the participants — on the debate/argument
outcome as this type of user information is
generally not available. This paper presents
a dataset of 78, 376 debates generated over a
10-year period along with surprisingly com-
prehensive participant profiles. We also com-
plete an example study using the dataset to an-
alyze the effect of selected user traits on the
debate outcome in comparison to the linguistic
features typically employed in studies of this
kind.

1 Introduction

Previous work from Natural Language Processing
(NLP) and Computational Social Science (CSS)
that studies argumentative text and its persuasive
effects has mainly focused on identifying the con-
tent and structure of an argument (e.g. Feng and
Hirst (2011)) and the linguistic features that are in-
dicative of effective argumentation strategies (e.g.
Tan et al. (2016)). The effectiveness of an argu-
ment, however, cannot be determined solely by its
textual content; rather, it is important to consider
characteristics of the reader, listener or partici-
pants in the debate or discussion. Does the reader
already agree with the argument’s stance? Is she
predisposed to changing her mind on the particu-
lar topic of the debate? Is the style of the argu-
ment appropriate for the individual? To date, ex-
isting argumentation datasets have permitted only
limited assessment of such “user” traits because
information on the background of users is gen-
erally unavailable. In this paper, we present a

dataset of 78, 376 debates from October of 2007
until November of 2017 drawn from debate.org
along with quite comprehensive user profile infor-
mation — for debate participants as well as users
voting on the debate quality and outcome. Back-
ground information on users includes demograph-
ics (e.g. education, income, religion) and stance on
a variety of controversial debate topics as well as a
record of user activity on the debate platform (e.g.
debates won and lost). We view this new dataset as
a resource that affords the NLP and CSS commu-
nities the opportunity to understand the effect of
audience characteristics on the efficacy of differ-
ent debating and persuasion strategies as well as to
model changes in user’s opinions and activities on
a debate platform over time. (To date, part of our
debate.org dataset has been used in one such study
to understand the effect of prior beliefs in persua-
sion1 (Durmus and Cardie, 2018). Here, we focus
on the properties of the dataset itself and study a
different task.)

In the next section, we describe the dataset in
the context of existing argumentation datasets. We
then provide statistics on key aspects of the col-
lected debates and user profiles (Section 3). Sec-
tion 4 reports a study in which we investigate the
predictive effect of selected user traits (namely, the
debaters’ and audience’s experience, prior debate
success, social interactions, and demographic in-
formation) vs. standard linguistic features. Ex-
perimental results show that features of the user
traits are significantly more predictive of a de-
bater’s success than the linguistic features that are
shown to be predictive of debater success by the
previous work (Zhang et al., 2016). This suggests
that user traits are important to take into account
in studying success in online debating.

tion 4 for details.

2 Related Work and Datasets

There has been a tremendous amount of re-
search effort to understand the important lin-
guistic features for identifying argument structure
and determining effective argumentation strategies
in monologic text (Mochales and Moens, 2011;
Feng and Hirst, 2011; Stab and Gurevych, 2014;
Guerini et al., 2015). For example, Habernal and
Gurevych (2016) has experimented with differ-
ent machine learning models to predict which of
two arguments is more convincing. To understand
what kind of persuasive strategies are effective,
Hidey et al. (2017) has further annotated differ-
ent modes of persuasion (ethos, logos, pathos) and
looked at which combinations appear most often
in more persuasive arguments.

Understanding argumentation strategies in con-
versations and the effect of interplay between the
language of the participants has also been an im-
portant avenue of research. Tan et al. (2016), for
example, has examined the effectiveness of argu-
ments on ChangeMyView3, a debate forum web-
site in which people invite others to challenge
their opinions. They found that the interplay be-
tween the language of the opinion holder and that
of the counterargument provides highly predic-
tive cues of persuasiveness. Zhang et al. (2016)
has examined the effect of conversational style in
Oxford-style debates and found that the side that
can best adapt in response to opponents’ discus-
sion points over the course of the debate is more
likely to be more persuasive. Although research
on computational argumentation has mainly fo-
cused on identifying important linguistic features
of the text, there is also evidence that it is impor-
tant to model the debaters themselves and the peo-
ple who are judging the quality of the arguments:
multiple studies show that people perceive argu-
ments from different perspectives depending on
their backgrounds and experiences (Correll et al.,
2004; Hullett, 2005; Petty et al., 1981; Lord et al.,
1979; Vallone et al., 1985; Chambliss and Garner,
1996). As a result, we introduce data from a so-
cial media debate site that also includes substan-
tial information about its users and their activity
and interaction on the website. This is in contrast

to the datasets commonly employed in studies of
argument strategies (Johnson and Goldman, 2009;
Walker et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2016; Wang et al.,
2017; Cano-Basave and He, 2016; Al Khatib et al.,
2016). Lukin et al. (2017) is the closest work to
ours as it studies the effect of OCEAN personality
traits (Roccas et al., 2002; T. Norman, 1963) of the
audience on how they perceive the persuasiveness
of monologic arguments. Note that, in our dataset,
we do not have information about users’ personal-
ity traits; however, we have extensive information
about their demographics, social interactions, be-
liefs and language use.

3 Dataset4

Debates. The dataset includes 78, 376 debates
from 23 different topic categories including Poli-
tics, Religion, Technology, Movies, Music, Places-
Travel. Each debate consists of different rounds in
which opposing sides provide their arguments. An
example debate along with the user information
for PRO and CON debaters and corresponding com-
ments and votes are shown in Figure 1. The ma-
jority of debates have three or more rounds; Pol-
itics, Religion, and Society are the most common
debate categories. Each debate includes comments
as well as the votes provided by other users in the
community. We collected all the comments and
votes for each debate with 606,102 comments and
199,210 votes in total. Voters evaluate each de-
bater along diverse set of criteria such as convinc-
ingness, conduct during the debate, reliability of
resources cited, spelling and grammar. With this
fine-grained evaluation scheme, we can study the
quality of arguments from different perspectives.

User Information. The dataset also includes
self-identified information for 45, 348 users par-
ticipating in the debates or voting for the debates:
demographic information such as age, gender, ed-
ucation, ethnicity; prior belief and personal infor-
mation such as political, religious ideology, in-
come, occupation and the user’s stance on a set of
48 controversial topics chosen by the website. The
controversial debate topics5 include ABORTION,
DEATH PENALTY, GAY MARRIAGE, and AFFIR-
MATIVE ACTION. Information about user’s ac-
tivity is also provided and includes their debates,
votes, comments, opinion questions they ask, poll

4 Task: What makes a debater
successful?

To understand the effect of user characteristics vs.
language features, and staying consistent with ma-
jority of previous work, we conduct the task of
predicting the winner of a debate by looking at ac-
cumulated scores from the voters. We model this
as a binary classification task and experiment with
a logistic regression model, optimizing the regu-
larizer (`1 or `2) and the regularization parameter
C (between 10−5 and 105) with 3-fold cross vali-
dation.

4.1 Data preprocessing
Controlling for the debate text. We eliminate
debates where a debater forfeits before the debate
ends. From the remaining debates, we keep only
the ones with three or more rounds with at least 20
sentences by each debater in each round to be able
to study the important linguistic features 6.
Determining the winner. For this particular
dataset, the winning debater is determined by the
votes of other users on different aspects of the ar-
guments as outlined in Section 3, and the debaters
are scored accordingly7. We determine the winner
by the total number of points the debaters get from

6After all the eliminations, we have 1635 debates in our
dataset.

and grammar: 1 point, making more convincing arguments:
3 points, using the most reliable sources: 2 points.

the voters. We consider the debates with at least 5
voters and remove the debates resulting in a tie.

4.2 Features

Experience and Success Prior. We define the ex-
perience of a user during a debate dt at time t as
the total number of debates participated as a de-
bater by the user before time t. The success prior
is defined as the ratio of the number of debates the
user won before time t to the total number of de-
bates before time t.

Similarity with audience’s user profile. We
encode the similarity of each of the debaters and
the voters by comparing each debaters’ opinions
on controversial topics, religious ideology, gen-
ders, political ideology, ethnicity and education
level to same of the audience. We include the fea-
tures that encode the similarity by counting num-
ber of voters having the same values as each of
the debaters for each of these characteristics. We
also include features that corresponds to cosine
distance between the vectors of each debater and
each voter where the user vector is one-hot repre-
sentation for each user characteristic.

Social Network. We extract features that repre-
sent the debaters’ social interactions before a par-
ticular debate by creating the network for their
commenting and voting activity before that de-
bate. We then computed the degree, centrality, hub
and authority scores from these graphs and include
them as features in our model.

Linguistic features of the debate. We per-
form ablation analysis with various linguistic
features shown to be effective in determining

token ratio, tf-idf, and punctuation. To get a text
representation for the debate, we concatenated
all the turns of each of the participants, extracted
features for each and finally concatenated the
feature representation of each participant’s text.
We also experimented with conversational flow
features shown to be effective in determining the
successful debaters by (Zhang et al., 2016) to
track how ideas flow between debaters throughout
a debate. Consistent with (Zhang et al., 2016), to
extract these features, we determine the talking
points that are most discriminating words for each
side from the first round of the debate applying
the method introduced by (Monroe et al.) which
estimates the divergence between the two sides

4.3 Results and Analysis
Table 1 shows the results for the user and linguistic
features. We find that combination of the debater
experience, debater success prior, audience sim-
ilarity features and debaters’ social network fea-
tures performs significantly better8 than the major-

ity baseline and linguistic features achieving the
best accuracy (68.43%). We observe that expe-
rience and social interactions are positively cor-
related with success. It suggests that as debaters
spend more time on the platform, they probably
learn strategies and adjust to the norms of the plat-
form and this helps them to be more successful.
We also find that success prior is positively corre-
lated with success in a particular debate. In gen-
eral, the debaters who win the majority of the de-
bates when first join the platform, tend to be suc-
cessful in debating through their lifetime. This
may imply that some users may already are good
at debating or develop strategies to win the debates
when they first join to the platform. Moreover, we
find that similarity with audience is positively cor-
related with success which shows that accounting
for the characteristics of the audience is important
in persuasion studies (Lukin et al., 2017).

Although the linguistic features perform better
than the majority baseline, they are not able to
achieve as high performance as the features en-
coding debater and audience characteristics. This
suggest that success in online debating may be
more related to the users’ characteristics and so-
cial interactions than the linguistic characteristics
of the debates. We find that use of argument lex-
icon features and subjectivity are the most impor-
tant features and positively correlated with success
whereas conversational flow features do not per-
form significantly better than length. This may be
because debates in social media are much more in-
formal compare to Oxford style debates and there-
fore, in the first round, the debaters may not nec-
essarily present an overview of their arguments
(talking points) they make through the debate.

We observe that (44%) of the mistakes made
by the model with user features are classified cor-
rectly by the linguistic model. This motivated us
to combine the user features with linguistic fea-
tures which gives the best overall performance
(71.35%). This suggests that user aspects and lin-
guistic characteristics are both important compo-
nents to consider in persuasion studies. We believe
that these aspects complement each other and it is
crucial to account for them to understand the ac-
tual effect of each of these components. For fu-
ture work, it may be interesting to understand the
role of these components in persuasion further and
think about the best ways to combine the informa-
tion from these two components to better represent
