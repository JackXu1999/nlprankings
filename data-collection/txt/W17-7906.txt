The  TM  memory  systems  changed  the

the 
translators not benefiting from these tools

cannot  benefit  from  already  translated 
texts  which  are  synonymous

paraphrased  versions  of)  the  text  to  be

based  on

the current TM systems was the subject of 
the  present  study  and  was  empirically 
proven  in  the  experiments  we conducted. 
To 
this  end,  we  compiled  a  small 
translation  memory (English-Spanish) and 
lexical  and  syntactic 
applied  several

being the source language. 
 
The results of this study show that current 
TM  systems  have  a  long  way  to  go  and 
highlight 
the  need  for  TM  systems 
equipped  with  NLP  capabilities  which 
will  offer  the  translator  the  advantage  of 
he/she  not having to translate a sentence 
again  if  an  almost  identical  sentence  has 
already been already translated.

1. Introduction 
 
While  automatic  translation  has  taken  off  to 
work  reasonably  in  some  scenarios  and  to  do 
well  for  gisting  purposes,  even  today,  against 
the  background  of  the  latest  promising  results 
delivered  by  statistical  Machine  Translation 
(MT)  systems  such  as  Google  Translate  and 
latest  developments 
in  Neural  Machine 
Translation  and  in  general  Deep  Learning  for 
MT,  automatic  translation  gets  it  often  wrong 
and  is  not  good  enough  for  professional 
translation.  Consequently,  there  has  been  a 

the 

the 

speed  up 

further  and  proposed 

pressing need for a new generation of tools for 
professional  translators  to  assist  them  reliably 
and 
translation  process. 
Historically,  it  was  Krollman  who  first  put 
forward 
reuse  of  existing  human 
translations in 1971. A few years later, in 1979 
Arthern  went 
the 
retrieval  and  reuse  not  only  of  identical  text 
fragments  (exact  matches)  but  also  of  similar 
source  sentences  and  their  translations  (fuzzy 
matches).  It  took  another  decade  before  the 
ideas sketched by Krollman and Arthern were 
commercialised as a result of the development 
of  various  computer-aided  translation  (CAT) 
tools  such  as  Translation  Memory  (TM) 
systems  in  the  early  1990s.  These  translation 
tools revolutionised the work of translators and 
the  last two decades saw dramatic changes in 
the translation workflow. 
 
The  TM  memory systems indeed  changed the 
work of translators and now the translators not 
benefiting  from these tools are a tiny minority. 
However,  while  these tools have proven to be 
very  efficient  for  repetitive  and  voluminous 
texts, they operate on fuzzy (surface) matching 
mostly  and  cannot  benefit  from  already 
translated  texts  which  are  synonymous  to  (or 
paraphrased  versions  of) 
the  text  to  be 
translated. The match score is mostly based on 
character-string  similarity,  calculated  through 
Levenshtein  distance 
the 
minimum  number  of  insertions,  deletions  and 
substitutions  needed  to  change  one  sequence 
of letters into another.”; Somers 2003) 
 
The  limitations  of  the  traditional  TM  systems 
in  terms  of matching have been highlighted by 
a  number  of  authors.  By  way  of  example, 
Somers  (2003)  gives  the  example  below  to 
illustrate  one drawback: 
 

(“measure  of 

a.  Select ‘Symbol’  in the Insert menu. 
b.  Select  ‘Symbol’  in  the  Insert  menu to 

enter character from the symbol set. 

c.  Select ‘Paste’ in the Edit menu. 

 

45

Given  the input sentence (a), (c) would be the 
highest  match  percentage,  as  it  differs in only 
two  words,  while  (b)  has  eight  additional 
words.  Intuitively (b) is a better match since it 
includes  the text of (a) in its entirety.  
 
Before  Mitkov  (2005)  elaborated  on  the 
specific  matching  limitations  of  TM  systems, 
Macklovitch  and  Russel  (2000)  pointed  out 
‘Current  Translation  Memory  technology  is 
limited 
techniques 
employed  for  approximate  matching’.  They 
went on to illustrate that unless an TM system 
can  do  morphological  analysis,  it  will  have 
difficult  recognising  that  (f)  is  more  similar  to 
(d) than (e):

Gow  (2003)  notes  that  SDL  Trados  gives the 
segments ‘Prendre des mesures de dotation et 
de  classification.’  and  ‘Connaissance  des 
techniques  de  rédaction  et  de  révision.’  a 
match  rating  of  as  high  as  56%  even  though 
the  above  sentences  have  nothing  to  do  with 
each  other  the  reason  being that  because half 
of the words are the same and they are in the 
same position, even though the common words 
are only function  words. 
 
Recent  work  on  new  generation  TM  systems 
(Gupta  2015;  Gupta  et  al.  2016a;  Gupta et al. 
2016b;  Timonera  and Mitkov 2015; Gupta and 
Orasan 2014) show that when NLP techniques 
such  as  paraphrasing  or  clause  splitting  are 
applied,  TM systems performance is enhanced. 
 
While  that  it  is  clear  that  TM  systems  are 
incapable  of  any 
linguistic  or  semantic 
interpretation,  we  maintain  that  they  have 
difficulties  with  detecting  similarities  even  in 
sentences  which  represent  a minor revision of 
sentences  already  available  in  the  translation 
memory.  In  order  to  substantiate  this  claim 
empirically,  we  conducted 
following 
experiments.  
 
We  conducted  experiments  using  a  small 
translation  memory 
in 
which  we  apply  several  lexical  and  syntactic

the  purpose  of 

transformation rules to the source sentences – 
both for English and Spanish serving as source 
language.  The 
rules  are 
selected in such a way that they are simple and 
the  transformed  sentences  do  not  change  in 
meaning.  The  hypothesis  of  this  study  is  that 
in  many  cases  the  TM  systems cannot detect 
the  fact  that  the  transformed  sentences  are 
practically  the  same  as  sentences  already 
translated as the match computed is below the 
threshold.  This 
turn,  would  mean 
insufficient  efficiency  as  the  new,  practically 
the  same  sentences, will have to be translated 
again.  For  the  purpose  of  this  study  we 
experimented  with 
the  well-known  TM 
systems  Trados,  Wordfast,  Omega  T  and 
MemoQ. 
 
2. Data Description 
 
For 
this  experiment  a 
translation  memory  or  alternatively  parallel 
corpora  were  needed.  To 
this  end,  we 
compiled  a  parallel  English-Spanish  corpus 
consisting  of  online  documents  of 
the 
European  Union and the United Nations.  The 
English  documents  selected  were  Charter  of 
the Fundamental Rights, Declaration on the 
Right  to  Development,  Declaration  on  the 
Rights  of Persons Belonging to National or 
Ethnic,  and  Religious  and  Linguistic 
Minorities, United Nations Declaration on the 
Rights  of  Indigenous People, and Universal 
Declaration  of  Human  Rights.  We  also 
selected  the  Spanish  equivalents  of  these 
documents:  Carta 
derechos 
fundamentals  de 
la  Unión  Europea, 
Declaración de las Naciones Unidades sobre 
el derecho al desarrollo, Declaración sobres 
los derechos de las personas pertenecientes a 
minorías  nacionales  o  étnicas,  religiosas  y 
lingüísticas,  Declaración  de  las  Naciones 
Unidades sobre los derechos de los pueblos 
indígena  and  Declaración  universal  de  los 
derechos  humanos.1  The  size  of  the  English 
corpus was 14,153 words while the size of the 
Spanish  corpus  is  15,461  words  (for  more 
details see Table 1).

We  are  aware  the  compiled  corpus  is  very 
small  but  we  regard  this  study  and  results  as 
preliminary.  In  fact  for  the  purpose  of  our 
experiments we selected a small sample of 150 
aligned  sentences  in  English  and  Spanish;  this 
‘experimental  TM’  served  as  a  basis  for  the 
experiments outlined. 
 
3. Transformations 
 
For the purpose of this study, we developed 10 
transformation  rules.  Rule  1  was to  transform 
an  original  sentence  in  active  voice  into  a 
passive voice sentence, if possible. Rule 2 was 
a mirror image of rule 1 – transform a sentence 
in  passive  voice  into  active  voice  sentence. 
Rule  3  had  to  do  with  changing  the  order 
inside  the  sentence  –  changing  the  order  of 
words,  phrases  or  clauses  within  a  sentence.  
Rule  4  sought  to  replace  a  word  with  a 
synonym  whereas Rule 5 replaced 2 words of 
 

their 

sentence  with 

a 
synonyms.  The 
replacement  with  synonyms  was  applied  to 
nouns,  verbs  and  adverbs  and  in cases where 
the  existence  of  synonym  with 
identical 
meaning  was  ‘obvious’.  Rule  6  built on rule 3 
by changing the order within a sentence but in 
addition  replaced  a  noun  with  a  pronoun  for 
which  it  served  as  antecedent.  Rule  7  was  a 
combination of rule 1 and 4 – change of active 
voice  into  passive  and  replacement  of a word 
with  its  synonym.  Rule  8  changed  passive 
voice into passive and like rule 6  - noun with a 
coreferential pronoun. Rule 9 was combination 
of  rule  3  and  rule  5,  and  finally  was  a 
subsequent  application  of  rule  2,  rule  3  and 
pronominalisation  of a noun. 
 
Table  2  below  lists  the rules with examples in 
English,  whereas  Table  3  lists  the  rules  with 
examples in Spanish.

4. Experiments,  Results and Discussion 
 
We  use  the  above  parallel  corpus  as  a 
translation  memory  and  experiment  with  both 
English  and  Spanish  as  source  languages.  If 
we  had to translate again a sentence from the 
source  Language, 
the  match  would  be 
obviously  100%.  For  the  purpose  of  the 
experiment,  each  sentence  of  the  source  text 
undergoes  a  transformation  after  applying  the 
rules  listed  below,  which  convert  the  original 
 

sentences 
into  syntactically  different  but 
semantically  same  sentences.  As  the  new 
sentences have the same meaning, it would be 
desirable  that  the  TM systems produce a high 
match between the transformed sentences and 
the  original  ones. By ‘high match’ we mean a 
match  above  the  threshold  of  a  specific  TM 
tool  so  that  the  user  can  benefit  from  the 
translation  of 
the  original  sentence  being 
displayed.

The  results  obtained  with  English  as  a source 
language  show  that  the  lexical  and  syntactic 
transformations  cause  significant  problems  to 
the  TM  systems  and  their  inability  to  return 
matching  above  the  default  threshold  means 
that  the  translator  may  miss out on the re-use 
of translations he/she has already made. In the 

case of Trados there are as many as 36% of the 
sentences  not  being  returned  after  being 
transformed  with  rule 1; this figure goes up to 
38%  when  applying  rule  6  and  35% with rule 
7. Wordfast fails to propose similarity for 54% 
of the sentences once rule 7 is applied. As for 
Omega  T,  the  application  of  rule  8  results  in 

49

56%  of  the  transformed  sentences  not  being 
detected  as  similar  to  the  original  sentence. 
MemoQ’s  failures  are  even  more  dramatic  in 
that  the  applications of rules 10, 9 and 7 leads 
to  inability  to  detected  similarity  in  70%,  76% 
and  85%  of  the  cases  respectively!  Overall, 
MemoQ  reports  the  most  negative  results 
which  is  surprising  given  the  very  positive 
feedback of users in general for this tool. 
It  appears  that  TM  systems  in  general  have 
more  problems  with  syntactic  transformations 
–  after  applying  rules  1,  2,  3  or the combined 
 

rules 6-10. The TM systems also report fewer 
problems  for lexical transformation only  – e.g. 
after applying  rules 4 and 5 only. 
 
As  the  transformations  are  language  specific, 
we  conducted 
similar  experiments  with 
Spanish  being  the  source  languages.  We 
transformed  the  original  Spanish  sentences 
using  the  above  rules  and  the  TM  systems 
computed  the  match between the transformed 
sentences and the original ones.

Table 5: Matching results Spanish 

cause  more 

 
The  results  obtained  with Spanish as a source 
language  show  that  the  lexical  and  syntactic 
transformations 
significant 
problems to the TM systems than with English 
as  a  source  language.  In  the  case  of  Trados 
there are as many as 40% of the sentences not 
being  returned  after  being  transformed  with 
rule  6  and  9;  this  figure  goes  up  around  60% 
when  applying  rule  8  and  61%  with  rule  2. 
Wordfast  fails  to propose similarity for around 
55%  of  the  sentences  once  rule  2  and  9  are 
applied;  and  up  to  63%  when  rule  5  is  also 
applied.  As  for  Omega  T,  the  application  of 
rule  8  results  in  59%  of  the  transformed 
sentences  not  being  detected  as  similar to the 
original  sentence  and  up 
to  61%  when 
applying  rule  2.  MemoQ’s  failures  after 
applying  rules  8,  9  and  2  leads  to  inability  of 
detecting  similarity  in  52%,  60%  and  67%  of 
the  different  cases.  On  the  whole,  every  TM

system  exhibits 
related to combining  different rules.  
 
It  is  worth  noting  the  high  errors  rates  for  all 
TM  systems  even  with  rule  2 which confirms 
their 
syntactic 
transformations.  
 
Finally,  it  is  worth  observing  that  for  Spanish 
as  source  language  the  matching  failures  are 
higher.  As  the  above  TM  systems  have  no 
NLP 
use 
Levenstein  distance  as  a  matching  algorithm, 
we  conjecture  that  this  has  to  do  with  the 
slightly  more complex syntax in Spanish.   
 
5. Conclusion 
 
Current  TM  systems  have  a  long  way  to  go. 
The  above  results  highlight  the  need  for  TM 

functionalities

technology  to  embrace  NLP  techniques  such 
as  parsing  or  paraphrasing.  A  TM  system 
equipped  with  NLP  capabilities  will  offer  the 
translator  the  advantage  of  he/she  not  having 
to  translate  a  sentence  again  if  an  almost 
identical  sentence  has  already  been  already 
translated.
