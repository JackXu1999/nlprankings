Abstract 

This study focuses on highly accurate 
prediction of the onset of type-2 diabe-
tes. We investigated whether predic-
tion accuracy can be improved by uti-
lizing lab test data obtained from 
health checkups and incorporating 
health claim text data such as medical-
ly diagnosed diseases with ICD10 
codes and pharmacy information. In a 
previous study, prediction accuracy 
was increased slightly by adding diag-
nosis disease name and independent 
variables such as prescription medi-
cine. Therefore, in the current study 
we explored more suitable models for 
prediction by using state-of-the-art 
techniques such as XGBoost and long 
short-term memory (LSTM) based on 
recurrent neural networks. In the cur-
rent study, text data was vectorized us-
ing word2vec, and the prediction 
model was compared with logistic re-
gression. The results obtained con-
firmed that onset of type-2 diabetes 
can be predicted with a high degree of 
accuracy when the XGBoost model is 
used. 

1 Introduction 

The incidence of lifestyle-related diseases is in-
creasing in many regions (WHO, 2009; Lim SS 
et al., 2012). Predicting the onset of lifestyle-
related diseases and implementing preventive 
measures in advance is important for municipali-
ties and insurers. Particularly in type-2 diabetes 
mellitus, not only medical cost but also indirect 
cost such as reduced productivity present a seri-
ous problem (American Diabetes Association, 
2018), and therefore, it is very important to take 
preventive measures early. 

From reports to date on the prediction of the 
onset of diabetes, it is well known that health 
checkup data items such as HbA1c, BMI, and 
ages are important indicators for estimating the 
onset of type-2 diabetes (Edelstein et al., 1997). 
Many related studies achieved accurate results by 
means of logistic regression and cox hazards 
regression models mainly based on bood test 
results (Droumaguet et al., 2006; Guasch-Ferr√© et 
al., 2012). These studies are aimed at predicting 
the onset of type-2 diabetes using a simple form. 
However, it is now common for machine learn-
ing and data mining methods to be used due to 
higher computer performance. Several studies 
have reported the effectiveness of using machine 
learning technique to improve classification ac-
curacy (Meng et al., 2013; Tapak et al., 2013; 
Kavakiotis et al., 2017). Another attempt in-
volved using clinical information such as health 
claims or electronic health records (EHRs). 
Health insurance claims data could prove to be a 
rich source of information for the early detection 
of type-2 diabetes as a previous study showed a 
slight improvement in prediction using such data 
(Krishnan et al., 2013; Razavian et al., 2015).  

In this study, we aim to develop and evaluate 
prediction models for the risk of type-2 diabetes 
using health insurance claims data in addition to 
health checkup data. 

2 Related work 

Many related studies are based on conventional 
prediction models for early detection of type-2 di-
abetes (Schulze et al., 2006, Thomas et al., 2006). 
Some research groups use a small number of risk 
factors as variables as their intention is to develop 
a practical method. A simple risk score enables 
healthcare providers to evaluate patients for fur-
ther intervention and treatment (Lindstr√∂m et al., 
2013; Kengne et al., 2014; Nanri et al., 2015). Lo-
gistic regression is one of the most effective mod-
els in these studies when compared to other ma-
chine learning models. On the other hand,

currently, healthcare data management systems in-
tegrate large amounts of medical information, 
such as diagnoses, medical procedures, lab test re-
sults, and more. Health claims and EHRs are two 
examples of this medical information which in-
cludes medical text data. It is suggested that there 
are latent factors that could improve diseases pre-
diction models by including diagnoses and pre-
scribed medicines (Krishnan et al., 2013; Razavi-
an et al., 2015). In addition, some natural lan-
guage processing (NLP) techniques such as 
word2vec have been widely used to discover nov-
el patterns and features (Choi et al., 2017; Jo et al., 
2017). It is expected that data-driven assessment 
of individual patient risk would provide better 
personalized care (Neuvirth et al., 2011). 

 Recently, Razavian et al. (2015) showed that 
using an L1-regularized logistic regression 
(L1LR) model with about 900 variables from 
health insurance claim data resulted in an area un-
der the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.80 compared with 
an AUC of 0.75 when using conventional diabetes 
risk factors. The L1LR model is an effective 
method where there are many independent varia-
bles, although a recent machine learning study has 
suggested that a gradient boosting method 
(XGBoost) could achieve high performance pre-
diction (Wei et al., 2017). Furthermore, long 
short-term memory (LSTM), which is based on a 
recurrent neural networks model, is feasible for 
long-range dependencies in sequential data. 

In this paper, we compare multiple prediction 
models for diabetes incidence using health check-
up and insurance claims data. In the study, three 
classification models (i.e. L1LR, XGBoost and 
LSTM) are developed, and their prediction per-
formance is evaluated as an AUC. 

3 Methods 

In this section, the dataset and variables used for 
the evaluation of the proposed methods are de-
scribed, and three prediction models are also pre-
sented. 

3.1 Dataset 
In the experiments, a collection of anonymized 
yearly health checkup and health claims at a 
health insurance society in Japan is used. The 
health checkup items consist of profile infor-
mation (e.g. age, sex), lab test results (e.g. body 
mass index, blood pressure, HbA1c), and health 
questionnaire (e.g. smoking, alcohol intake, exer-

cise level). We used 33 health checkup items as 
features for further experiments. The data were 
obtained from about 40,000 people aged 20 to 64 
years. From the whole dataset, we selected those 
subjects who had health checkups regularly over a 
period of at least three years. In addition, we ex-
cluded some samples missing blood test data. Af-
ter selection was complete, the final total sample 
size was 31,000. We used 20% of the dataset ran-
domly sampled for test data, and the rest was used 
for training. Subjects were diagnosed with diabe-
tes if they had a measured fasting blood sugar 
(FBS) ‚â•126 mg/dL, or HbA1c 6.5%, or a diagno-
sis of diabetes on a health insurance claim. Out-
come was evaluated if a subject had onset of dia-
betes in a year in the last of dataset. 

3.2 Health insurance claims 
Patient records of health insurance claims include 
medical cost, laboratory test, medical diagnosed 
disease with ICD10 (International Statistical Clas-
sification of Diseases and Related Health Prob-
lems) codes and pharmacy information related to 
the individuals between the years 2011 and 2016. 
About 5% of subjects had no claim data and had 
never visited clinics or hospitals. We used ICD10 
codes and medicine name data for additional fea-
tures. To build a training data, firstly, we checked 
FBS level and HbA1c of health checkup data, and 
ICD10 codes of diabetes in health insurance 
claims to extract positive examples. 

Our goal is to predict onset of diabetes later 
than next year and the after that. Thus, for training 
and prediction, we did not use health checkup re-
sults and health insurance claims of immediate 1 
year before of diabetes diagnosis.  

Since the health insurance claims are issued in 
monthly unit, there can be more than one ICD10 
codes and medicine names in one health insurance 
claim. We preprocessed them by using word2vec 
(Mikolov et al., 2013; Rehurek R 2014; Choi et al., 
2017). Here, we regarded array of ICD10 codes or 
medicinal ingredients of prescribed medicine as 
one sentence. Then we simply preprocessed by 
word2vec to obtain distributed expression of 
ICD10 codes and medicinal ingredients. In our 
experiments, we set both dimensions of ICD10 
vector and medical ingredient vector to be 200. 
By the aforementioned preprocessing, a health in-
surance claim of one month was converted to 2 
vectors (ICD10 vectors and medical ingredients 
vectors).

3.3 Prediction model 
As baseline, a conventional L1LR model was 
used. For L1 regularization hyper-parameter, we 
searched over values of [0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10], 
and 0.1 was selected as the optimum value. 

In the experiment, we compare two state of 
the art prediction models. One is XGBoost which 
is a scalable machine learning system based on 
tree boosting (Chen T. and Guestrin C. 2016). To 
train the XGBoost model, we used scikit-learn 
API with default parameters. For XGBoost train-
ing and L1LR models training, all features includ-
ing medical checkup results, and distributed ex-
pressions of ICD10 and medical ingredients are 
simply concatenated. 

The other prediction model is Long Short-
term Memory (LSTM). Figure 1 shows the LSTM 
architecture used in our experiments. As shown in 
the figure, the LSTM method consists of two 
training parts. The first part is health checkup, and 
second is the ICD10 code, or/and medicinal in-
gredients of prescribed medicines. 
{ùê±#,‚ãØ , ùê±&,‚ãØ , ùê±'} are an array of input sequence 
for LSTM. For example, ùê±&  could be embedded 
insurance claim vector at t-th month. 

LSTM consist of four components comprising 
forget gate (ùêü&), input gate (ùê¢&),	 output gate (ùê®&), 
and memory state (ùêú&). These real value vectors 
are calculated using the following formulas: 

ùêü& = 	ùúé	(ùêñ2ùê±& + ùêî2ùê°&6# + ùêõ2),     

 ùê¢& = 	ùúé	(ùêñ9ùê±& + ùêî9ùê°&6# + ùêõ9), 

ùê®& = 	ùúé	(ùêñ:ùê±& + ùêî:ùê°&6# + ùêõ:), 

 ùêú&; = tanh	(ùêñ@ÃÉùê±& + ùêî@ÃÉùê°&6# + ùêõ@ÃÉ), 

ùêú& = 	 ùêü& ‚äô ùêú&6# + ùê¢& ‚äô ùêú&;  (1) 

where ùêñ and U are weight matrices, and b are 
bias vectors. 	ùúé (¬∑) and tanh (¬∑) are an element-
wise sigmoid function and hyperbolic tangent 
function, respectively.  Using these vectors, the 
hidden layer vector (ùê°&) is calculated as follows: 

ùê°& = 	ùê®& ‚äô tanh(ùêú&)  (2) 

Where ‚äô is an element-wise multiplication. In 
our experiments, we used up to three kinds of fea-
ture sets (shows in Table 1). Each feature set is 
processed by individual LSTM. After processing 
all of feature sets by LSTMs, each of the last hid-
den layer vectors are concatenated as follows: 

ùê°ùíÇùíÉùíÑ = 	ùê°ùíÇùê°ùíÉùê°ùíÑ                                      (3) 

By using ùê°ùíÇùíÉùíÑ, the output layer calculates proba-
bilities of diabetes. The output layer calculates 
probability of diabetes. 

4 Results 

Incidence of type 2 diabetes in our dataset was 
4%. The characteristics detailed statistics are 
shown in Table 2. 

We developed three models namely XGBoost, 
LSTM, and L1LR. For each model, we used four 
patterns of health claim variables. Table 3 shows 
the AUC when using the three models. The results 
show that the performance of the XGBoost and 
LSTM models was superior to that of the L1LR 
model without health claim features. In our exper-
iments, the highest performance was obtained

when the XGBoost with ICD10 plus medicine 
features was used. On the other hand, the L1LR 
model had the lowest AUC, though a slight im-
provement was obtained by incorporating health 
claim data. 

LSTM with the ICD10 model showed a rela-
tively high performance, however, adding pre-
scribed medicine features did not improve its level 
of prediction. 

5 Discussion 

In this study, we compared the predictive perfor-
mance of a conventional model to that of machine 
learning-based models using health checkup data 
and additional health claim features vectorized by 
word2vec. The results showed that the XGBoost 
and LSTM models achieved better performance 
compared to the L1LR model without using health 
claim information. Adding health claim features 
improved prediction performance in each of the 
three models. This is consistent with a previous 
study in which use of the L1LR model obtained 
slightly improved prediction performance (Ra-
zavian et al. 2015). These results suggest that 
medical information contains latent signals for 
risk factors associated with the onset of diabetes. 

In terms of how to use health claim data, a 
previous study used the data as one-hot vectors. 
However, one-hot encoding cannot express the re-
lationship and meaning between words. On the 
other hand, word2vec makes it possible to give a 
latent meaning to the vector. This effect was con-
sidered to be valid in the case of the XGBoost 
model. 

In recent years, the LSTM model has been 
used to estimate disease name or mortality from 
medical information obtained from medical sys-
tems with a high degree of performance (Ayyar et 
al., 2016; Lipton et al., 2016; Jo et al., 2017). 
LSTM can embed influence over time series data 
across multiple layers. Therefore, although we ex-
pected this effect in our experiments, prediction 
performance was not improved much when 
ICD10 and medicine name were used in combina-
tion, compared with the case when using only 
ICD10. This result can probably be attributed to 
the difference in the quality of the information be-
tween the diagnosis disease name and prescription 
medicine.  

Our study has several limitations. First, the 
vectorization from health claims data was empiri-
cally set to 200 dimensions. However, it is not 
clear what the optimal dimension is. Second, the 
duration in terms of years of the dataset is rela-
tively short. From the standpoint of disease pre-
vention, it may be desirable for predictive purpos-
es to extend this period to three years or more. Fi-
nally, the dataset sample population may have 
been biased because our data collection depended 
on information from one health insurance society. 

6 Conclusion and Future Work 

It would be useful in terms of practicality if risk 
could be estimated easily with noninvasive data.  
However, it is also very important, from the view-
point of personal care, to predict onset of disease 
with a high degree of precision with obtained 
from various types of medical information. In this 
study, we developed and evaluated several predic-
tion models for type-2 diabetes to explore an ef-
fective means of vectorization using health claims. 
We used health claims, ICD10 and prescribed 
medicine name as variables in addition to health 
checkup data by vectorizing via word2vec. The 
results showed that the XGBoost model with 
health claim variables achieved a higher perfor-
mance compared to the LSTM and L1LR models. 
Our study suggests that there are potential factors 
contained in large amounts of medical information 
which may be signals to the onset of diabetes. It is 
possible that the LSTM model may still be able to 
further improve prediction performance as well. 
As future work, we plan to test the effect of di-
mensional compression by parameter tuning.
