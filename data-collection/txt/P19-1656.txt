Abstract

Human language is often multimodal, which
comprehends a mixture of natural language,
facial gestures, and acoustic behaviors. How-
ever, two major challenges in modeling such
multimodal human language time-series data
exist: 1) inherent data non-alignment due
to variable sampling rates for the sequences
from each modality; and 2) long-range depen-
dencies between elements across modalities.
In this paper, we introduce the Multimodal
Transformer (MulT) to generically address the
above issues in an end-to-end manner with-
out explicitly aligning the data. At the heart
of our model is the directional pairwise cross-
modal attention, which attends to interactions
between multimodal sequences across distinct
time steps and latently adapt streams from one
modality to another. Comprehensive experi-
ments on both aligned and non-aligned multi-
modal time-series show that our model outper-
forms state-of-the-art methods by a large mar-
gin. In addition, empirical analysis suggests
that correlated crossmodal signals are able to
be captured by the proposed crossmodal atten-
tion mechanism in MulT.

1 Introduction

Human language possesses not only spoken words
but also nonverbal behaviors from vision (facial
attributes) and acoustic (tone of voice) modali-
ties (Gibson et al., 1994). This rich information
provides us the benefit of understanding human
behaviors and intents (Manning et al., 2014). Nev-
ertheless, the heterogeneities across modalities of-
ten increase the difficulty of analyzing human lan-
guage. For example, the receptors for audio and
vision streams may vary with variable receiving
frequency, and hence we may not obtain optimal
mapping between them. A frowning face may re-
late to a pessimistically word spoken in the past.

That is to say, multimodal language sequences
often exhibit “unaligned” nature and require in-
ferring long term dependencies across modalities,
which raises a question on performing efficient
multimodal fusion.

To address the above issues, in this paper we
propose the Multimodal Transformer (MulT), an
end-to-end model that extends the standard Trans-
former network (Vaswani et al., 2017) to learn rep-
resentations directly from unaligned multimodal
streams. At the heart of our model is the cross-
modal attention module, which attends to the
crossmodal interactions at the scale of the entire
utterances. This module latently adapts streams
from one modality to another (e.g., vision →
language) by repeated reinforcing one modality’s
features with those from the other modalities, re-

gardless of the need for alignment. In compari-
son, one common way of tackling unaligned mul-
timodal sequence is by forced word-aligning be-
fore training (Poria et al., 2017; Zadeh et al.,
2018a,b; Tsai et al., 2019; Pham et al., 2019;
Gu et al., 2018): manually preprocess the vi-
sual and acoustic features by aligning them to
the resolution of words. These approaches would
then model the multimodal interactions on the (al-
ready) aligned time steps and thus do not directly
consider long-range crossmodal contingencies of
the original features. We note that such word-
alignment not only requires feature engineering
that involves domain knowledge; but in practice,
it may also not always be feasible, as it entails
extra meta-information about the datasets (e.g.,
the exact time ranges of words or speech utter-
ances). We illustrate the difference between the
word-alignment and the crossmodal attention in-
ferred by our model in Figure 1.

For evaluation, we perform a comprehensive set
of experiments on three human multimodal lan-
guage benchmarks: CMU-MOSI (Zadeh et al.,
2016), CMU-MOSEI (Zadeh et al., 2018b), and
IEMOCAP (Busso et al., 2008). Our experi-
ments show that MulT achieves the state-of-the-
art (SOTA) results in not only the commonly eval-
uated word-aligned setting but also the more chal-
lenging unaligned scenario, outperforming prior
approaches by a margin of 5%-15% on most of the
metrics. In addition, empirical qualitative analysis
further suggests that the crossmodal attention used
by MulT is capable of capturing correlated signals
across asynchronous modalities.

Human Multimodal Language Analysis. Prior
work for analyzing human multimodal language
lies in the domain of inferring representations
from multimodal sequences spanning language,
vision, and acoustic modalities. Unlike learning
multimodal representations from static domains
such as image and textual attributes (Ngiam et al.,
2011; Srivastava and Salakhutdinov, 2012), hu-
man language contains time-series and thus re-
quires fusing time-varying signals (Liang et al.,
2018; Tsai et al., 2019). Earlier work used
early fusion approach to concatenate input fea-
tures from different modalities (Lazaridou et al.,
2015; Ngiam et al., 2011) and showed improved
performance as compared to learning from a sin-

gle modality. More recently, more advanced mod-
els were proposed to learn representations of hu-
man multimodal language. For example, Gu et al.
(2018) used hierarchical attention strategies to
learn multimodal representations, Wang et al.
(2019) adjusted the word representations using ac-
companying non-verbal behaviors, Pham et al.
(2019) learned robust multimodal representations
using a cyclic translation objective, and Dumpala
et al. (2019) explored cross-modal autoencoders
for audio-visual alignment. These previous ap-
proaches relied on the assumption that multimodal
language sequences are already aligned in the res-
olution of words and considered only short-term
multimodal interactions. In contrast, our proposed
method requires no alignment assumption and de-
fines crossmodal interactions at the scale of the en-
tire sequences.

Transformer Network. Transformer net-
work (Vaswani et al., 2017) was first introduced
for neural machine translation (NMT) tasks,
where the encoder and decoder side each lever-
ages a self-attention (Parikh et al., 2016; Lin
et al., 2017; Vaswani et al., 2017) transformer.
After each layer of the self-attention, the encoder
and decoder are connected by an additional
decoder sublayer where the decoder attends to
each element of the source text for each element
of the target text. We refer the reader to (Vaswani
et al., 2017) for a more detailed explanation of
the model. In addition to NMT, transformer
networks have also been successfully applied to
other tasks, including language modeling (Dai
et al., 2018; Baevski and Auli, 2019), semantic
role labeling (Strubell et al., 2018), word sense
disambiguation (Tang et al., 2018), learning
sentence representations (Devlin et al., 2018), and
video activity recognition (Wang et al., 2018).

This paper absorbs a strong inspiration from
the NMT transformer to extend to a multimodal
setting. Whereas the NMT transformer focuses
on unidirectional translation from source to tar-
get texts, human multimodal language time-series
are neither as well-represented nor discrete as
word embeddings, with sequences of each modal-
ity having vastly different frequencies. Therefore,
we propose not to explicitly translate from one
modality to the others (which could be extremely
challenging), but to latently adapt elements across
modalities via the attention. Our model (MulT)
therefore has no encoder-decoder structure, but it

is built up from multiple stacks of pairwise and
bidirectional crossmodal attention blocks that di-
rectly attend to low-level features (while remov-
ing the self-attention). Empirically, we show that
our proposed approach improves beyond standard
transformer on various human multimodal lan-
guage tasks.

3 Proposed Method

In this section, we describe our proposed Multi-
modal Transformer (MulT) (Figure 2) for mod-
eling unaligned multimodal language sequences.
At the high level, MulT merges multimodal time-
series via a feed-forward fusion process from mul-
tiple directional pairwise crossmodal transform-
ers. Specifically, each crossmodal transformer
(introduced in Section 3.2) serves to repeatedly
reinforce a target modality with the low-level
features from another source modality by learn-
ing the attention across the two modalities’ fea-
tures. A MulT architecture hence models all pairs
of modalities with such crossmodal transformers,
followed by sequence models (e.g., self-attention
transformer) that predicts using the fused features.

The core of our proposed model is crossmodal
attention module, which we first introduce in Sec-
tion 3.1. Then, in Section 3.2 and 3.3, we present
in details the various ingredients of the MulT ar-
chitecture (see Figure 2) and discuss the difference
between crossmodal attention and classical multi-
modal alignment.

3.1 Crossmodal Attention
We consider two modalities α and β, with two
(potentially non-aligned) sequences from each of
them denoted Xα ∈ RTα×dα and Xβ ∈ RTβ×dβ ,
respectively. For the rest of the paper, T(·) and d(·)
are used to represent sequence length and feature
dimension, respectively. Inspired by the decoder
transformer in NMT (Vaswani et al., 2017) that
translates one language to another, we hypothesize
a good way to fuse crossmodal information is pro-
viding a latent adaptation across modalities; i.e., β
to α. Note that the modalities consider in our pa-
per may span very different domains such as facial
attributes and spoken words.

We define the Querys as Qα = XαWQα , Keys
as Kβ = XβWKβ , and Values as Vβ = XβWVβ ,
where WQα ∈ Rdα×dk ,WKβ ∈ Rdβ×dk and
WVβ ∈ Rdβ×dv are weights. The latent adapta-
tion from β to α is presented as the crossmodal
attention Yα := CMβ→α(Xα, XB) ∈ RTα×dv :

Yα = CMβ→α(Xα, Xβ)

XβWVβ .

(1)

Note that Yα has the same length as Qα (i.e.,
Tα), but is meanwhile represented in the feature
space of Vβ . Specifically, the scaled (by

√
dk)

softmax in Equation (1) computes a score matrix
softmax (·) ∈ RTα×Tβ , whose (i, j)-th entry mea-
sures the attention given by the i-th time step of
modality α to the j-th time step of modality β.
Hence, the i-th time step of Yα is a weighted sum-
mary of Vβ , with the weight determined by i-th
row in softmax(·). We call Equation (1) a single-
head crossmodal attention, which is illustrated in
Figure 3(a).

Following prior works on transform-
ers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2018;
Devlin et al., 2018; Dai et al., 2018), we add
a residual connection to the crossmodal atten-
tion computation. Then, another positionwise
feed-forward sublayer is injected to complete
a crossmodal attention block (see Figure 3(b)).
Each crossmodal attention block adapts directly
from the low-level feature sequence (i.e., Z [0]β in
Figure 3(b)) and does not rely on self-attention,
which makes it different from the NMT encoder-
decoder architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017; Shaw
et al., 2018) (i.e., taking intermediate-level
features). We argue that performing adaptation

preserve the low-level information for each
modality. We leave the empirical study for
adapting from intermediate-level features (i.e.,
Z

[i−1]
β ) in Ablation Study in Section 4.3.

3.2 Overall Architecture

Three major modalities are typically involved in
multimodal language sequences: language (L),
video (V ), and audio (A) modalities. We de-
note with X{L,V,A} ∈ RT{L,V,A}×d{L,V,A} the in-
put feature sequences (and the dimensions thereof)
from these 3 modalities. With these notations, in
this subsection, we describe in greater details the
components of Multimodal Transformer and how
crossmodal attention modules are applied.

Temporal Convolutions. To ensure that each el-
ement of the input sequences has sufficient aware-
ness of its neighborhood elements, we pass the
input sequences through a 1D temporal convolu-
tional layer:

X̂{L,V,A} = Conv1D(X{L,V,A}, k{L,V,A}) ∈ RT{L,V,A}×d
(2)

where k{L,V,A} are the sizes of the convolutional
kernels for modalities {L, V,A}, and d is a com-
mon dimension. The convolved sequences are
expected to contain the local structure of the se-
quence, which is important since the sequences
are collected at different sampling rates. More-
over, since the temporal convolutions project the
features of different modalities to the same di-
mension d, the dot-products are admittable in the
crossmodal attention module.

Positional Embedding. To enable the se-
quences to carry temporal information, follow-
ing (Vaswani et al., 2017), we augment positional
embedding (PE) to X̂{L,V,A}:

Z
[0]
{L,V,A} = X̂{L,V,A} + PE(T{L,V,A}, d) (3)

where PE(T{L,V,A}, d) ∈ RT{L,V,A}×d computes
the (fixed) embeddings for each position index,
and Z [0]{L,V,A} are the resulting low-level position-
aware features for different modalities. We leave
more details of the positional embedding to Ap-
pendix A.

Crossmodal Transformers. Based on the cross-
modal attention blocks, we design the crossmodal
transformer that enables one modality for receiv-
ing information from another modality. In the fol-
lowing, we use the example for passing vision (V )
information to language (L), which is denoted by
“V → L”. We fix all the dimensions (d{α,β,k,v})
for each crossmodal attention block as d.

Each crossmodal transformer consists of D lay-
ers of crossmodal attention blocks (see Figure
3(b)). Formally, a crossmodal transformer com-
putes feed-forwardly for i = 1, . . . , D layers:

divisible by the number of heads). LN means layer
normalization (Ba et al., 2016).

In this process, each modality keeps updating its
sequence via low-level external information from
the multi-head crossmodal attention module. At
every level of the crossmodal attention block, the
low-level signals from source modality are trans-
formed to a different set of Key/Value pairs to in-
teract with the target modality. Empirically, we
find that the crossmodal transformer learns to cor-
relate meaningful elements across modalities (see
Section 4 for details). The eventual MulT is based
on modeling every pair of crossmodal interactions.
Therefore, with 3 modalities (i.e., L, V,A) in con-
sideration, we have 6 crossmodal transformers in
total (see Figure 2).

Self-Attention Transformers and Prediction.
As a final step, we concatenate the outputs from
the crossmodal transformers that share the same
target modality to yield Z{L,V,A} ∈ RT{L,V,A}×2d.
For example, ZL = [Z

[D]
V→L;Z

[D]
A→L]. Each of

them is then passed through a sequence model to
collect temporal information to make predictions.
We choose the self-attention transformer (Vaswani
et al., 2017). Eventually, the last elements of the
sequences models are extracted to pass through
fully-connected layers to make predictions.

3.3 Discussion about Attention & Alignment

When modeling unaligned multimodal language
sequences, MulT relies on crossmodal atten-
tion blocks to merge signals across modalities.
While the multimodal sequences were (manually)
aligned to the same length in prior works be-
fore training (Zadeh et al., 2018b; Liang et al.,

2018; Tsai et al., 2019; Pham et al., 2019; Wang
et al., 2019), we note that MulT looks at the non-
alignment issue through a completely different
lens. Specifically, for MulT, the correlations be-
tween elements of multiple modalities are purely
based on attention. In other words, MulT does not
handle modality non-alignment by (simply) align-
ing them; instead, the crossmodal attention en-
courages the model to directly attend to elements
in other modalities where strong signals or rele-
vant information is present. As a result, MulT can
capture long-range crossmodal contingencies in a
way that conventional alignment could not eas-
ily reveal. Classical crossmodal alignment, on the
other hand, can be expressed as a special (step di-
agonal) crossmodal attention matrix (i.e., mono-
tonic attention (Yu et al., 2016)). We illustrate
their differences in Figure 4.

4 Experiments

In this section, we empirically evaluate the Multi-
modal Transformer (MulT) on three datasets that
are frequently used to benchmark human multi-
modal affection recognition in prior works (Pham
et al., 2019; Tsai et al., 2019; Liang et al., 2018).
Our goal is to compare MulT with prior compet-
itive approaches on both word-aligned (by word,
which almost all prior works employ) and un-
aligned (which is more challenging, and which
MulT is generically designed for) multimodal lan-
guage sequences.

4.1 Datasets and Evaluation Metrics

Each task consists of a word-aligned (processed in
the same way as in prior works) and an unaligned
version. For both versions, the multimodal
features are extracted from the textual (GloVe
word embeddings (Pennington et al., 2014)), vi-
sual (Facet (iMotions, 2017)), and acoustic (CO-
VAREP (Degottex et al., 2014)) data modalities.
A more detailed introduction to the features is in-
cluded in Appendix.

For the word-aligned version, following (Zadeh
et al., 2018a; Tsai et al., 2019; Pham et al., 2019),
we first use P2FA (Yuan and Liberman, 2008)
to obtain the aligned timesteps (segmented w.r.t.
words) for audio and vision streams, and we then
perform averaging on the audio and vision fea-
tures within these time ranges. All sequences in
the word-aligned case have length 50. The pro-
cess remains the same across all the datasets. On
the other hand, for the unaligned version, we keep
the original audio and visual features as extracted,
without any word-segmented alignment or man-
ual subsampling. As a result, the lengths of each
modality vary significantly, where audio and vi-
sion sequences may contain up to > 1, 000 time
steps. We elaborate on the three tasks below.

CMU-MOSI & MOSEI. CMU-MOSI (Zadeh
et al., 2016) is a human multimodal sentiment
analysis dataset consisting of 2,199 short mono-
logue video clips (each lasting the duration of a
sentence). Acoustic and visual features of CMU-
MOSI are extracted at a sampling rate of 12.5 and
15 Hz, respectively (while textual data are seg-
mented per word and expressed as discrete word

embeddings). Meanwhile, CMU-MOSEI (Zadeh
et al., 2018b) is a sentiment and emotion analy-
sis dataset made up of 23,454 movie review video
clips taken from YouTube (about 10× the size
of CMU-MOSI). The unaligned CMU-MOSEI se-
quences are extracted at a sampling rate of 20 Hz
for acoustic and 15 Hz for vision signals.

For both CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, each
sample is labeled by human annotators with a
sentiment score from -3 (strongly negative) to 3
(strongly positive). We evaluate the model per-
formances using various metrics, in agreement
with those employed in prior works: 7-class ac-
curacy (i.e., Acc7: sentiment score classification
in Z ∩ [−3, 3]), binary accuracy (i.e., Acc2: pos-
itive/negative sentiments), F1 score, mean abso-
lute error (MAE) of the score, and the correlation
of the model’s prediction with human. Both tasks
are frequently used to benchmark models’ ability
to fuse multimodal (sentiment) information (Po-
ria et al., 2017; Zadeh et al., 2018a; Liang et al.,
2018; Tsai et al., 2019; Pham et al., 2019; Wang
et al., 2019).

IEMOCAP. IEMOCAP (Busso et al., 2008)
consists of 10K videos for human emotion anal-
ysis. As suggested by Wang et al. (2019), 4 emo-
tions (happy, sad, angry and neutral) were selected
for emotion recognition. Unlike CMU-MOSI and
CMU-MOSEI, this is a multilabel task (e.g., a per-
son can be sad and angry simultaneously). Its mul-
timodal streams consider fixed sampling rate on
audio (12.5 Hz) and vision (15 Hz) signals. We
follow (Poria et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019; Tsai
et al., 2019) to report the binary classification ac-
curacy and the F1 score of the predictions.

4.2 Baselines

We choose Early Fusion LSTM (EF-LSTM) and
Late Fusion LSTM (LF-LSTM) as baseline mod-
els, as well as Recurrent Attended Variation
Embedding Network (RAVEN) (Wang et al.,
2019) and Multimodal Cyclic Translation Net-
work (MCTN) (Pham et al., 2019), that achieved
SOTA results on various word-aligned human
multimodal language tasks. To compare the mod-
els comprehensively, we adapt the connection-
ist temporal classification (CTC) (Graves et al.,
2006) method to the prior approaches (e.g., EF-
LSTM, MCTN, RAVEN) that cannot be applied
directly to the unaligned setting. Specifically,
these models train to optimize the CTC alignment

4.3 Quantitative Analysis

Word-Aligned Experiments. We first evaluate
MulT on the word-aligned sequences— the “home
turf” of prior approaches modeling human multi-
modal language (Sheikh et al., 2018; Tsai et al.,
2019; Pham et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019). The
upper part of the Table 1, 2, and 3 show the results
of MulT and baseline approaches on the word-
aligned task. With similar model sizes (around
200K parameters), MulT outperforms the other
competitive approaches on different metrics on all
tasks, with the exception of the “sad” class results
on IEMOCAP.

Unaligned Experiments. Next, we evaluate
MulT on the same set of datasets in the unaligned
setting. Note that MulT can be directly applied to
unaligned multimodal stream, while the baseline
models (except for LF-LSTM) require the need of
additional alignment module (e.g., CTC module).

The results are shown in the bottom part of Ta-
ble 1, 2, and 3. On the three benchmark datasets,
MulT improves upon the prior methods (some
with CTC) by 10%-15% on most attributes. Em-

pirically, we find that MulT converges faster to
better results at training when compared to other
competitive approaches (see Figure 5). In addi-
tion, while we note that in general there is a per-
formance drop on all models when we shift from
the word-aligned to unaligned multimodal time-
series, the impact MulT takes is much smaller than
the other approaches. We hypothesize such perfor-
mance drop occurs because the asynchronous (and
much longer) data streams introduce more diffi-
culty in recognizing important features and com-
puting the appropriate attention.

Ablation Study. To further study the influence
of the individual components in MulT, we per-
form comprehensive ablation analysis using the
unaligned version of CMU-MOSEI. The results
are shown in Table 4.

First, we consider the performance for only

change), despite the lack of alignment between original L/V sequences. Note that due to temporal convolution,
each textual/visual feature contains the representation of nearby elements.

using unimodal transformers (i.e., language, au-
dio or vision only). We find that the language
transformer outperforms the other two by a large
margin. For example, for the Acch2 metric, the
model improves from 65.6 to 77.4 when compar-
ing audio only to language only unimodal trans-
former. This fact aligns with the observations in
prior work (Pham et al., 2019), where the authors
found that a good language network could already
achieve good performance at inference time.

Second, we consider 1) a late-fusion trans-
former that feature-wise concatenates the last
elements of three self-attention transformers;
and 2) an early-fusion self-attention trans-
former that takes in a temporal concatenation of

three asynchronous sequences [X̂L, X̂V , X̂A] ∈
R(TL+TV +TA)×dq (see Section 3.2). Empirically,
we find that both EF- and LF-Transformer (which
fuse multimodal signals) outperform unimodal
transformers.

Finally, we study the importance of individ-
ual crossmodal transformers according to the tar-
get modalities (i.e., using [V,A → L], [L,A →
V ], or [L, V → A] network). As shown in
Table 4, we find crossmodal attention modules
consistently improve over the late- and early-
fusion transformer models in most metrics on un-
aligned CMU-MOSEI. In particular, among the
three crossmodal transformers, the one where
language(L) is the target modality works best.
We also additionally study the effect of adapt-
ing intermediate-level instead of the low-level fea-
tures from source modality in crossmodal atten-
tion blocks (similar to the NMT encoder-decoder
architecture but without self-attention; see Sec-
tion 3.1). While MulT leveraging intermediate-
level features still outperform models in other ab-
lative settings, we empirically find adapting from
low-level features works best. The ablations sug-
gest that crossmodal attention concretely benefits
MulT with better representation learning.

4.4 Qualitative Analysis

To understand how crossmodal attention works
while modeling unaligned multimodal data, we
empirically inspect what kind of signals MulT
picks up by visualizing the attention activations.
Figure 6 shows an example of a section of the
crossmodal attention matrix on layer 3 of the V →



6566

L network of MulT (the original matrix has di-
mension TL × TV ; the figure shows the attention
corresponding to approximately a 6-sec short win-
dow of that matrix). We find that crossmodal at-
tention has learned to attend to meaningful signals
across the two modalities. For example, stronger
attention is given to the intersection of words that
tend to suggest emotions (e.g., “movie”, “disap-
pointing”) and drastic facial expression changes in
the video (start and end of the above vision se-
quence). This observation advocates one of the
aforementioned advantage of MulT over conven-
tional alignment (see Section 3.3): crossmodal
attention enables MulT to directly capture po-
tentially long-range signals, including those off-
diagonals on the attention matrix.

5 Discussion

In the paper, we propose Multimodal Trans-
former (MulT) for analyzing human multimodal
language. At the heart of MulT is the cross-
modal attention mechanism, which provides a la-
tent crossmodal adaptation that fuses multimodal
information by directly attending to low-level fea-
tures in other modalities. Whereas prior ap-
proaches focused primarily on the aligned multi-
modal streams, MulT serves as a strong baseline
capable of capturing long-range contingencies, re-
gardless of the alignment assumption. Empiri-
cally, we show that MulT exhibits the best perfor-
mance when compared to prior methods.

We believe the results of MulT on unaligned
human multimodal language sequences suggest
many exciting possibilities for its future appli-
cations (e.g., Visual Question Answering tasks,
where the input signals is a mixture of static and
time-evolving signals). We hope the emergence
of MulT could encourage further explorations on
tasks where alignment used to be considered nec-
essary, but where crossmodal attention might be
an equally (if not more) competitive alternative.

A Positional Embedding

A purely attention-based transformer network is
order-invariant. In other words, permuting the or-
der of an input sequence does not change trans-
former’s behavior or alter its output. One solution
to address this weakness is by embedding the posi-
tional information into the hidden units (Vaswani
et al., 2017).

Following (Vaswani et al., 2017), we encode the
positional information of a sequence of length T
via the sin and cos functions with frequencies dic-
tated by the feature index. In particular, we de-
fine the positional embedding (PE) of a sequence
X ∈ RT×d (where T is length) as a matrix where:

PE[i, 2j] = sin
(

i

10000
2j
d

)

PE[i, 2j + 1] = cos
(

i

10000
2j
d

)

for i = 1, . . . , T and j = 0, bd2c. Therefore,
each feature dimension (i.e., column) of PE are
positional values that exhibit a sinusoidal pat-
tern. Once computed, the positional embedding is
added directly to the sequence so that X + PE en-
codes the elements’ position information at every
time step.

B Connectionist Temporal Classification

Connectionist Temporal Classification
(CTC) (Graves et al., 2006) was first pro-
posed for unsupervised Speech to Text alignment.
Particularly, CTC is often combined with the
output of recurrent neural network, which enables
the model to train end-to-end and simultaneously
infer speech-text alignment without supervision.
For the ease of explanation, suppose the CTC
module now are aiming at aligning an audio
signal sequence [a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6] with length
6 to a textual sequence “I am really really happy”
with length 5. In this example, we refer to
audio as the source and texts as target signal,
noting that the sequence lengths may be different
between the source to target; we also see that the
output sequence may have repetitive element (i.e.,
“really”). The CTC (Graves et al., 2006) module
we use comprises two components: alignment
predictor and the CTC loss.

First, the alignment predictor is often chosen as
a recurrent networks such as LSTM, which per-
forms on the source sequence then outputs the

possibility of being the unique words in the tar-
get sequence as well as a empty word (i.e., x).
In our example, for each individual audio sig-
nal, the alignment predictor provides a vector of
length 5 regarding the probability being aligned to
[x, ‘I’, ‘am’, ‘really’, ‘happy’].

Next, the CTC loss considers the negative log-
likelihood loss from only the proper alignment for
the alignment predictor outputs. The proper align-
ment, in our example, can be results such as

i) [x, ‘I’, ‘am’, ‘really’, ‘really’, ‘happy’];

ii) [‘I’, ‘am’, x, ‘really’, ‘really’, ‘happy’];

iii) [‘I’, ‘am’, ‘really’, ‘really’, ‘really’, ‘happy’];

iv) [‘I’, ‘I’, ‘am’, ‘really’, ‘really’, ‘happy’]

In the meantime, some examples of the subopti-
mal/failure cases would be

i) [x, x, ‘am’, ‘really’, ‘really’, ‘happy’];

ii) [‘I’, ‘am’, ‘I’, ‘really’, ‘really’, ‘happy’];

iii) [‘I’, ‘am’, x, ‘really’, x, ‘happy’]

When the CTC loss is minimized, it implies the
source signals are properly aligned to target sig-
nals.

To sum up, in the experiments that adopting
the CTC module, we train the alignment predic-
tor while minimizing the CTC loss. Then, ex-
cluding the probability of blank words, we mul-
tiply the probability outputs from the alignment
predictor to source signals. The source signal
is hence resulting in a pseudo-aligned target sin-
gal. In our example, the audio signal is then
transforming to a audio signal [a′1, a

′
2, a
′
3, a
′
4, a
′
5]

with sequence length 5, which is pseudo-aligned
to [’I’, ’am’, ’really’, ’really’, ’happy’].

C Hyperparameters

Table 5 shows the settings of the various MulTs
that we train on human multimodal language
tasks. As previously mentioned, the models are
contained at roughly the same sizes as in prior
works for the purpose of fair comparison. For hy-
perparameters such as the dropout rate and number
of heads in crossmodal attention module, we per-
form a basic grid search. We decay the learning
rate by a factor of 10 when the validation perfor-
mance plateaus.

D Features

The features for multimodal datasets are extracted
as follows:

- Language. We convert video transcripts
into pre-trained Glove word embeddings
(glove.840B.300d) (Pennington et al., 2014).
The embedding is a 300 dimensional vector.

- Vision. We use Facet (iMotions, 2017) to in-
dicate 35 facial action units, which records
facial muscle movement (Ekman et al., 1980;
Ekman, 1992) for representing per-frame ba-
sic and advanced emotions.

- Audio. We use COVAREP (Degottex et al.,
2014) for extracting low level acoustic fea-
tures. The feature includes 12 Mel-frequency
cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), pitch track-
ing and voiced/unvoiced segmenting fea-
tures, glottal source parameters, peak slope
parameters and maxima dispersion quotients.
Dimension of the feature is 74.
