Abstract

Aspect-based opinion summarization is the
task of automatically generating a summary
for some aspects of a specific topic from a
set of opinions. In most cases, to evaluate the
quality of the automatic summaries, it is nec-
essary to have a reference corpus of human
summaries to analyze how similar they are.
The scarcity of corpora in that task has been
a limiting factor for many research works. In
this paper, we introduce OpiSums-PT, a cor-
pus of extractive and abstractive summaries of
opinions written in Brazilian Portuguese. We
use this corpus to analyze how similar human
summaries are and how people take into ac-
count the issues of aspect coverage and sen-
timent orientation to generate manual sum-
maries. The results of these analyses show
that human summaries are diversified and peo-
ple generate summaries only for some aspects,
keeping the overall sentiment orientation with
little variation.

1 Introduction

Opinion summarization, also known as sentiment
summarization, is the task of automatically gener-
ating summaries for a set of opinions about a spe-
cific target (Conrad et al., 2009). According to Liu
(2012), there are three main approaches to gener-
ate summaries of opinions: traditional summariza-

tion, contrastive view summarization and aspect-
based summarization. Most of the works in opinion
summarization follows the aspect-based approach,
because it produces summaries with more informa-
tion (Hu and Liu, 2004).

Aspect-based opinion summarization generates
summaries of opinions for the main aspects of an
object or entity. Objects could be products, services,
organizations (e.g., a smartphone), and aspects are
attributes or components of them (such as the bat-
tery or the screen for a smartphone). An automatic
system of aspect-based opinion summarization re-
ceives as input a set of opinions about an object and
produces a summary that expresses the sentiment for
some relevant aspects.

Opinion summaries could be extractive or ab-
stractive. Most automatic methods in opinion sum-
marization produces extractive summaries, which
are created selecting the most representative text
segments (usually sentences) from the original opin-
ions (Mani, 1999) (Radev et al., 2004). An opin-
ion summary could also be abstractive, in which
the content of the summary is rewritten using new
text segments (Radev and McKeown, 1998) (Lin and
Hovy, 2000). There are few works that produce
abstractive summaries, because they require some
complex Natural Language Processing tasks such as
text generation or sentence fusion.

In both cases, to evaluate the performance of au-

62



tomatic methods, it is usually necessary to have a
reference corpus of human summaries. With a cor-
pus, automatic and human summaries could be com-
pared to know how similar they are. Through that
comparison, we could identify the errors of these
automatic methods and, consequently, improve their
performance. Moreover, a corpus of opinion sum-
maries could be used in machine learning methods
as training data to learn patterns for extracting im-
portant information from opinions.

Unfortunately, there are few available corpora for
aspect-based opinion summarization (Ganesan et al.,
2010) (Zhu et al., 2013) (Kim and Zhai, 2009),
which difficults the progress of this task. Most of
these corpora have focused on English. For Brazil-
ian Portuguese language, to the best of our knowl-
edge, there is no available corpus of opinion sum-
maries.

In this paper, we present OpiSums-PT (Opinion
Summaries in Portuguese), a corpus of opinion
summaries based on aspects, written in Brazilian
Portuguese. OpiSums-PT contains multiple human
summaries, in which each summary comes from the
analysis of 10 opinions. The building of this cor-
pus was motivated by two main reasons: (i) to ad-
dress the absence of a corpus of opinion summaries
in Brazilian Portuguese and (ii) to evaluate how peo-
ple generate summaries of opinions. Particularly, we
analyze how similar human summaries are (for the
same set of opinions) and how important the infor-
mation of aspect coverage and sentiment orientation
are.

The results of these analyses indicate that agree-
ment for human summaries, in terms of Kappa coef-
ficient (Carletta, 1996) and ROUGE-1 measure (Lin,
2004), is low. The results also show that people gen-
erate summaries only for some aspects and they keep
the overall sentiment orientation, with little varia-
tion, in the summaries.

The remaining of the paper is organized as fol-
lows: in Section 2, we introduce the main related
works; in Section 3, we describe the resources used
in this research; in Section 4, we explain how the
corpus of summaries was created; the experiments
and results of annotator agreement, aspect coverage
and sentiment orientation are presented in Section 5;
finally, in Section 6, we conclude this work.

2 Related Work

Many research works in aspect-based opinion sum-
marization have created their own dataset crawl-
ing review websites or social networks. Of these
resources, few could be considered as standard
datasets. The dataset proposed in Hu and Liu (2004)
is the most used resource in aspect-based opinion
summarization. However, that corpus did not con-
tain manual summaries, but aspects annotated and
their associated sentiment. To evaluate automatic
summaries in those works, the authors have used
survey questions to select the best summaries.

In previous works in which opinion summaries
were manually created, the annotation of the corpus
has not been described in detail because it was not
the main focus of these studies.

In Tadano et al. (2010), three participants anno-
tated 25 reviews (approximately with 450 sentences)
of opinions about a videogame. From the 25 re-
views, 50 sentences were selected to the summary.
In the experiments, ROUGE-1 measure between the
annotator’s summaries was 0.480, which shows that
it is difficult to generate the same summary for opin-
ions, even among humans.

Xu et al. (2011) crawled 32,007 reviews for
three aspects (food, service and ambience) from 173
restaurants. From these reviews, 10 restaurants were
chosen for evaluations and 7 restaurants to configure
some parameters of the automatic method proposed
by Xu et al. For each aspect of a restaurant, the au-
thors created an extractive summary selecting sev-
eral sentences with representative and diverse opin-
ions. Each summary was composed by 100 words in
average.

In Carenini et al. (2006), 28 annotators created ab-
stractive summaries for a corpus of reviews about
a digital camera and a DVD player. Each partici-
pant in the annotation received 20 reviews randomly
selected from the corpus and generated a summary
of 100 words. As instructions, the participants as-
sumed that they worked for a manufacturer of prod-
ucts (either digital camera or DVD player). The pur-
pose of these instructions was to motivate the user
to look for the most important information worthy
of summarization.

Ganesan et al. (2010) created a corpus of man-
ual abstractive summaries using reviews of hotels,

63



cars and various electronic products. To collect
the reviews, the authors used 51 “topic queries”
(e.g., Ipod:sound and Toyota:comfort). Each “topic
query” had 100 redundant sentences related to the
query. Ganesan et al. used a crowdsourcing market-
place to get 5 human workers to create 5 different
summaries for each “topic query”. After the creation
of the summaries, the authors reviewed each set of
summaries and dropped summaries that had little or
no correlation with the majority of them. Finally,
each “topic query” had approximately 4 reference
summaries.

Unlike these works, we performed a qualitative
analysis of opinion summaries based on aspects. Be-
sides that, we also compare extractive and abstrac-
tive summaries in terms of annotators agreement, as-
pect coverage and sentiment orientation. To the best
of our knowledge, there are no similar works, most
likely due to the difficulty of generating human-
written summaries for opinions.

3 Corpora

To create the corpus of opinion summaries, we used
reviews from two domains: books and electronic
products. For the first one, we used the opinions
of ReLi corpus (Freitas et al., 2013), a collection of
opinions about 13 books. For the second domain,
we collected reviews of 4 electronic products from
Buscapé1 website. The purpose of using these two
domains is to have a corpus with different charac-
teristics in the opinions. In the following sections,
these two resources are explained in more detail.

3.1 Books

For book opinions, we used the ReLi corpus (Freitas
et al., 2013). This corpus is composed of 1,600 re-
views with 12,000 sentences about 13 books written
by 7 famous authors of classical and contemporary
literature. The opinions of ReLi were freely written
by different users in specialized review websites.

The annotated opinions in ReLi are directly re-
lated to the books and their aspects (e.g., characters,
chapters and story). Opinions about other books or
movies of the books were not considered. In ReLi,
reviews were annotated at the segment and sentence
levels in three phases: (i) identification and anno-

1http://www.buscape.com.br/

tation of the sentence polarity, (ii) identification of
objects in sentences and (iii) identification of polar-
ity in segments that contain sentiment. E.g., for the
sentence “The book is very interesting but its chap-
ters are too long”, the polarity sentence is positive,
the identified objects are book and chapters, and the
polarities for the segments very interesting and too
long are positive and negative, respectively.

The annotation of ReLi was conducted by lin-
guists who attended a training process to be familiar
with the task and instructions. According to Freitas
et al. (2013), the agreement was calculate in a sam-
ple of 170 reviews and the obtained results were sat-
isfactory. In the polarity identification of sentences,
identification of objects and polarity identification in
segments that contain sentiment, the agreement val-
ues were 98.3%, 72.6% and 99.8% in average, re-
spectively.

For the annotation of our corpus, we randomly se-
lected 10 reviews for each book of ReLi, taking as
example other related works ((Carenini et al., 2006),
(Tadano et al., 2010)) that have used a similar num-
ber of opinions as data source. In the selection of
reviews, we determined that they contain at most
300 words. We used this filter because people pre-
fer to read concise opinions instead of reviews with
too many words. This criterion was also used in the
selection of electronic product opinions.

3.2 Electronic Products
We collected opinions about electronic products
from Buscapé, a website where users comment
about different products (e.g. smartphones, clothes,
videogames, etc.). These comments are written in
a free format within a template with three sections:
Pros, Cons, and Opinion.

To create the corpus of summaries, we collected a
set of reviews about 4 electronic products: 2 smart-
phones (Samsung Galaxy S III and Iphone 5) and 2
televisions (LG Smart TV and Samsung Smart TV).
For each product, we randomly selected 10 reviews.

This set of reviews was annotated by one person
with strong knowledge in Sentiment Analysis. The
annotation consisted in the identification of product
aspects, e.g., battery and photo for smartphones, and
sound and price for televisions. The identification of
the polarity of segments that contain sentiment about
the aspects was also annotated.

4 Corpus Annotation

According to Ulrich et al. (2008), abstractive sum-
marization is the main goal of many research works,
since it is what people naturally do, but extractive
summarization has been more explored and effec-
tive since it is easier to compute. In this annotation,
we generated both, extractive and abstractive sum-
maries, to assistant different researches and to ana-
lyze how they are generated in opinions.

In OpiSums-PT, we created multiple reference
summaries in order to reduce the overall subjectivity
and any possible bias. For each book and electronic
product, we generated 5 extractive and 5 abstractive
summaries. In total, 170 summaries were manually
created. Table 1 shows the content of OpiSums-PT
in relation to the number of sentences, tokens, types
and their average by summary.

Table 1: Content of OpiSums-PT

Types 1702 1833
Average sentences by summary 6.3 5.1
Average tokens by summary 99.2 101.3
Average types by summary 71.1 72.4

This annotation was carried out by 14 participants
with strong knowledge in Computational Linguistics
and Natural Language Processing. Each participant
created 12 summaries approximately during the an-
notation process. Each set of 5 summaries (extrac-
tive or abstractive) was generated by 5 different an-
notators.

To generate a summary, either extractive or ab-
stractive, each annotator read 10 opinions about
books or electronic products. This number of opin-
ions was chosen because we believe that, when peo-
ple look for opinions, they do not read large amounts
of opinions, but a small sample of them.

The task of annotation was daily performed dur-
ing 13 days, approximately. In the first meeting, the
annotators received a training session together with
the annotation manual document to be familiar with
the task. In that document, we presented all instruc-
tions as well as the aspects identified in the opin-
ions of ReLi and Buscapé. These aspects were taken

from the annotation of these two data sources and
were shown to the participants with the sole inten-
tion that annotators know them. Table 2 shows the
objects and aspects presented to the participants in
the annotation of OpiSums-PT.

Table 2: Objects and aspects identified in opinions

price, camera, weight, operating
system, internet, photo, video, wi-fi,
sound, size, headphones, speed, chip

TVs design, price, camera, image quality,
brightness, wi-fi, sound, durability,
internet

In the other days of annotation, the annotators cre-
ated summaries at home and sent them by email, as
it was conducted in (Dias et al., 2014). Each day, an
annotator generated only one summary (extractive
or abstractive). We opted for this scheme in order to
simplify the task for annotators and, consequently,
to get good summaries.

Another instruction in the annotation was related
to the summary length. Both extractive and abstrac-
tive summaries should be composed by 100 words
with a tolerance of ±10 words, approximately. We
choose the same number of words for these types of
summaries to evaluate how they are generated un-
der similar restrictions. A compression ratio in per-
centage (e.g., 25%) was not used because the vast
majority of the works in aspect-based opinion sum-
marization do not use this scheme (Carenini et al.,
2006) (Ganesan et al., 2010) (Tadano et al., 2010).

4.1 Extractive Summaries
To create extractive summaries in our annotation,
we asked the annotators to select the most important
sentences from the original opinions. We did not es-
tablish a criterion to determine the importance of a
sentence, it was a decision of each annotator. Like-
wise, we did not oblige to exclude sentences with
dangling anaphora. We opted for this autonomy with
the purpose that the creation of summaries to be as
natural as possible. The number of aspects included
in the final summary was chosen by each annotator.

The final summary was composed by complete

65



sentences. It was not allowed to rewrite the sen-
tences of the original opinions. If a sentence pre-
sented misspellings and/or grammatical mistakes,
they should not be corrected.

Each sentence of the source opinions had an iden-
tifier in the end part. This identifier allowed link-
ing the summary sentence with the source opinion.
Thus, for example, the identifier “<D20 S3>” in-
dicates the third sentence of the opinion (document)
20. Figure 1 shows an example of an extractive sum-
mary (in bold, the identifiers of the sentences).

Figure 1: Example of Extractive Summary

As we can see in Figure 1, the extractive summary
is composed by seven sentences from different opin-
ions (D2, D3, D6 and D7). This happened frequently
in our extractive summaries, indicating that relevant
sentences for annotators were written by different
web users. As consequence of this, the lack of cohe-
sion between summary sentences was notorious.

4.2 Abstractive Summaries
To create abstractive summaries is more difficult
than extractive summaries, since it implies generat-
ing new text. In our annotation, we asked the anno-
tators to generate summaries as rewritten as possible
in order to get more differentiated summaries in re-
lation to the extractive summaries.

Abstractive summaries should indicate the actual
scenario of source opinions (general predominant

sentiment). Similar to the extractive summaries, the
number of aspects to be included in abstractive sum-
maries and the structure of the text were decisions of
each annotator.

In Figure 2, we show an example of abstractive
summary about Twilight book. In the first part of
the text, the author’s summary gives the overall sen-
timent for this book, and, then, describes the web
user’s sentiment for some book aspects. This struc-
ture was adopted by the majority of annotators.

 

 
A grande maioria dos leitores avaliaram 

negativamente o livro Crepúsculo, pois em geral, 

eles argumentaram que o livro tem um romance 

exagerado. Entre as principais desvantagens do 

livro, os leitores mencionaram que os personagens 

são superficiais, a escrita é péssima e a história é 

chata. Muitos dos usuários não conseguiram terminar 

de ler o livro e não recomendariam ele para outras 

pessoas. Por outro lado, outra pequena parte dos 

leitores acharam que o livro Crepúsculo é bom, pois 

consideraram que ele é intenso, romântico, cheio de 

mistérios e brilhante. Estes leitores afirmaram que, 

embora Crepúsculo seja um livro fictício, ele mostra 

a importância de um verdadeiro amor. 

 

[Translation] 

 

The vast majority of readers evaluated negatively 

Twilight book, because, in general, they argued that 

it has an exaggerated romance. Among the main 

disadvantages of this book, readers mentioned that 

characters are superficial, the writing is bad and 

the story is boring. Many users were not able to 

finish the reading of the book and they would not 

recommend it to other people. On the other hand, 

another small part of readers think that Twilight 

book is good, because they considered it intense, 

romantic, full of mysteries and amazing. These 

readers said that, although Twilight is a fictional 

book, it shows the importance of the true love. 

 

 

 

Figure 2: Example of Abstractive Summary

In comparison with extractive summaries, these
ones did not present the problem of lack of cohesion
and show explicitly what was the predominant sen-
timent in the source opinions.

5 Experiments

After the annotation, we performed some experi-
ments over OpiSums-PT. First, we calculated the an-
notators agreement to know how difficult this task
is. Second, we analyzed the aspect coverage to es-
timate the proportion of aspects that is preserved in
the summaries. Finally, the sentiment orientation in
the summaries was computed to verify if it is propor-
tional to the general sentiment in source opinions.

In this paper, we focused on these three issues. It
is believed that (i) people generate not very similar
opinion summaries, (ii) not all aspects are consid-

ered in the final summary and (iii) humans consider
the sentiment orientation to create an opinion sum-
mary. However, as far as we know, there are no pre-
vious works that proved these hypotheses. In this
study, we explore these three hypotheses.

5.1 Inter-Annotator Agreement

We calculated the inter-annotator agreement for ex-
tractive and abstractive summaries. For both, we
used the ROUGE score (Lin, 2004). For extractive
summaries, Kappa coefficient (Carletta, 1996) was
also calculated, as well as the percentage of com-
mon sentences in the summaries.

In extractive summaries, we calculated Kappa
agreement for each book and electronic product, tak-
ing the sentences of source opinions and verifying
which of them were included in the human sum-
maries. In average, the Kappa value obtained in the
experiments was 0.185. According to Liu and Liu
(2008), the Kappa values reported for text and meet-
ing summarization were 0.38 and 0.28 in average,
respectively. Compared to these values, the Kappa
agreement obtained by us in aspect-based opinion
summarization is lower. This is likely due to the fact
that in opinion summarization there are many differ-
ent sentences that express the same meaning. Thus,
different annotators could have chosen different sen-

tences with similar content.
To compensate this problem of Kappa, we also

used the ROUGE-N score. The ROUGE measure
computes the n-gram overlap between summaries
and, thus, could help to identify sentences that are
similar in content. In our experiments, we used the
ROUGE-1 score (unigram overlap).

For each annotator, we computed ROUGE-1
scores using other annotators’ summaries as refer-
ences, and then we calculated the average between
them. Table 3 shows the values of ROUGE-1 ob-
tained for each book and electronic product in ex-
tractive and abstractive summaries. These results
are better than Kappa results and may indicate that
annotators choose different sentences that have sim-
ilar content. The results for extractive summaries
are better than abstractive summaries, because in ab-
stracts annotators have independence to use different
words, possibly synonyms and paraphrases.

For extractive summaries, we also computed the
percentage of common sentences among the sum-
maries created by annotators. In Table 3, we show
the results. Total Agreement indicates the propor-
tion of common sentences selected by five annota-
tors; Majority Agreement, by four or three annota-
tors; and Minority Agreement, by two annotators.
No agreement indicates that annotators did not agree

67



in the selection of sentences.
On one hand, the results for these metrics in-

dicate that annotators choose the same sentences
in few cases. In average, only 1.1% (0.011) of
sentences was selected by all annotators, and only
17.3% (0.173) of them by the majority of annotators.
We believe that this is mainly due to the large num-
ber of sentences that annotators have to read to gen-
erate the summary (in average, 40 sentences). On
the other hand, in many cases, annotators choose
different sentences (see columns Minority and No
Agreement), because, as it is reported in (Rath et al.,
1961), in the summarization task, there is no single
set of representative sentences chosen by humans.
In addition, we believe that some especial linguistic
characteristics of opinions, such as irony or usage of
slangs, make this task more challenging.

In general, all results reported in Table 3 show
that it is difficult to generate similar opinion sum-
maries based on aspects (extractive or abstractive)
even among humans. Although these results are low,
they could be used as a topline performance to eval-
uate other automatic methods.

5.2 Aspect Coverage
An important issue in aspect-based opinion summa-
rization is the aspect coverage. Aspect coverage is
an indicator of how many aspects of the source opin-
ions are preserved in the generated summary. Most
research works have been focused on producing a
summary for each aspect (Blair-Goldensohn et al.,
2008) (Tadano et al., 2010) (Xu et al., 2011). How-
ever, if we want an overall summary, that approach
could be not ideal.

In our work, we produced overall summaries
based on aspects, i.e., a summary contains the most
important aspects, according to the annotators, for a
set of source opinions. In the experiments, to calcu-
late the aspect coverage, we considered the objects
or entities as aspects, similar to Gerani et al. (2014).

To estimate the aspect coverage for extractive
summaries, we get the aspects annotated in the opin-
ions of ReLi and Buscapé, and then it was verified
how many of them are preserved in the summaries.
In abstractive summaries, we used a semi-automatic
search. We look for aspects using a list with their
names. After that, we manually reviewed the sum-
maries in order to add possible synonyms to the as-

pect list. For example, the word “narrative” was
considered a synonym of the “story” aspect. Finally,
we determined how many aspects were in the sum-
maries. For each book and electronic product, we
calculated the proportion of aspects preserved in the
five summaries, and then we computed the average.

Table 4 shows the percentage of aspect coverage
for extractive and abstractive summaries. As we
can see, abstractive summaries have wider coverage
than extractive summaries because annotators have
less restriction to write an abstractive summary and,
thus, they can include more aspects. On the other
hand, in extractive summaries, annotators are lim-
ited to the content of the source opinion’s sentences.

There are few cases where all aspects are included
in the summaries (books “Fala sério, amiga!” and
“Fala sério, professor!”). In these cases, less than
three aspects were presented in source opinions. By
contrast, when the number of aspects in the source
opinions was high, few of them were included in the
summary (e.g., product Samsung Galaxy S III). It
was most notorious in electronic products because
they have more technical opinions that include many
aspects.

Results in Table 4 indicate that, for an overall
aspect-based summary, humans consider only some
aspects in the text. We did not find other works

to compare the results of aspect coverage, but we
believe that our results show an approximation of
how many aspects humans consider in a summary.
Thus, automatic opinion summarization methods
could use these results as indicator of how many as-
pects could be included in the summaries.

5.3 Sentiment Orientation

To communicate to summary’s readers what is the
sentiment in the opinions about the entity and its as-
pects is not simply a matter of classifying the sum-
mary as positive or negative. Summary’s readers
want to know if all opinions that evaluate the en-
tity made it in a similar way or if they were varied.
Thus, opinion summaries must preserve the polarity
distribution as much as possible to reflect the overall
sentiment about the entity and its aspects.

In our experiments, we evaluated how much hu-
mans (annotators) maintain the sentiment orienta-
tion in the manual summaries. To estimate the gen-
eral sentiment presented in the source opinions, we
extract the segments that contain sentiment with its
polarities from the annotations of ReLi and Buscapé.
We calculated the percentage of positive and nega-
tive segments. Table 5 shows the percentage of pos-
itive and negative sentiments presented in the source
opinions (column “Actual Polarity”) for each book
and electronic product.

To calculate the sentiment in extractive sum-

maries, we estimate the sentiment for positive and
negative classes using the annotations of ReLi and
Buscapé. For abstractive summaries, we calcu-
lated the sentiment with the automatic lexicon-based
method proposed in Taboada et al. (2011) using the
SentiLex lexicon (Silva et al., 2012), because, ac-
cording to Balage Filho et al. (2013), it gets bet-
ter results in comparison with other Brazilian Por-
tuguese dictionaries.

Table 5 shows the results of the sentiment orien-
tation for each book and electronic product. In gen-
eral, annotators reflected the sentiment distribution
of source opinions in the summaries. The propor-
tions between positive and negative sentiments were
not exactly the same, but were very similar. This
shows that humans (annotators) take into account
the sentiment to create the summary and consider
both classes, positive and negative, according to how
they appeared in the source opinions.

There are few cases where the sentiment orienta-
tion of summaries is opposite of the source opinions
(marked in bold). This indicates that annotators fo-
cused only in one part of the source opinions ignor-
ing the overall sentiment.

Extractive summaries got better correlations than
abstractive summaries because the sentences of ex-
tractive summaries are the same of the source opin-
ions and also because the sentiment in abstractive
summaries was automatically calculated.

6 Conclusion

In this paper, we presented OpiSums-PT, a corpus of
opinion summaries, extractive and abstractive, based
on aspects written in Brazilian Portuguese. We also
made a qualitative analysis about how people gen-
erate these types of summaries. As was previously
showed, human summaries are diversified and peo-
ple generate summaries only for some aspects keep-
ing the overall sentiment orientation with little vari-
ation.

This work has been motivated, mainly, by the im-
portance that a corpus has in this task and to assist
future researches in the opinion summarization field.

The complete version of OpiSums-PT is available
for download through the Sucinto project webpage2

under a Creative Commons license.
Future work includes extending OpiSums-PT

with other type of annotations, such as sentence
alignment between summaries and identification of
elementary discourse units.
