Abstract

With the growth of the internet, the num-
ber of fake-news online has been proliferat-
ing every year. The consequences of such
phenomena are manifold, ranging from lousy
decision-making process to bullying and vio-
lence episodes. Therefore, fact-checking algo-
rithms became a valuable asset. To this aim, an
important step to detect fake-news is to have
access to a credibility score for a given infor-
mation source. However, most of the widely
used Web indicators have either been shut-
down to the public (e.g., Google PageRank)
or are not free for use (Alexa Rank). Further
existing databases are short-manually curated
lists of online sources, which do not scale.
Finally, most of the research on the topic is
theoretical-based or explore confidential data
in a restricted simulation environment. In
this paper we explore current research, high-
light the challenges and propose solutions to
tackle the problem of classifying websites into
a credibility scale. The proposed model auto-
matically extracts source reputation cues and
computes a credibility factor, providing valu-
able insights which can help in belittling du-
bious and confirming trustful unknown web-
sites. Experimental results outperform state of
the art in the 2-classes and 5-classes setting.

1 Introduction

With the enormous daily growth of the Web, the
number of fake-news sources have also been in-
creasing considerably (Li et al., 2012). This social
network era has provoked a communication rev-
olution that boosted the spread of misinformation,
hoaxes, lies and questionable claims. The prolifer-
ation of unregulated sources of information allows
any person to become an opinion provider with

no restrictions. For instance, websites spread-
ing manipulative political content or hoaxes can
be persuasive. To tackle this problem, differ-
ent fact-checking tools and frameworks have been
proposed (Zubiaga et al., 2017), mainly divided
into two categories: fact-checking over natural
language claims (Thorne and Vlachos, 2018) and
fact-checking over knowledge bases, i.e., triple-
based approaches (Esteves et al., 2018). Over-
all, fact-checking algorithms aim at determining
the veracity of claims, which is considered a very
challenging task due to the nature of underlying
steps, from natural language understanding (e.g.
argumentation mining) to common-sense verifi-
cation (i.e., humans have prior knowledge that
makes far easier to judge which arguments are
plausible and which are not). Yet an important
underlying fact-checking step relies upon com-
puting the credibility of sources of information,
i.e. indicators that allow answering the question:
“How reliable is a given provider of informa-
tion?”. Due to the obvious importance of the Web
and the negative impact that misinformation can
cause, methods to demote the importance of web-
sites also become a valuable asset. In this sense
the high number of new websites appearing at ev-
eryday (Netcraft, 2016), make straightforward ap-
proaches - such as blacklists and whitelists - im-
practical. Moreover, such approaches are not de-
signed to compute credibility scores for a given
website but rather to binary label them. Thus,
they aim at detecting mostly “fake” (threatening)
websites; e.g., phishing detection, which is out of
scope of this work. Thus, open credibility mod-
els have a great importance, especially due to the
increase of fake news being propagated. There is
much research into credibility factors. However,
they are mostly grouped as follows: (1) theoret-
ical research on psychological aspects of credi-
bility and (2) experiments performed over private



51

and confidential users information, mostly from
web browser activities (strongly supported by pri-
vate companies). Therefore, while (1) lacks prac-
tical results (2) report findings which are not much
appealing to the broad open-source community,
given the non-open characteristic of the conducted
experiments and data privacy. Finally, recent re-
search on credibility has also pointed out impor-
tant drawbacks, as follows:

1. Manual (human) annotation of credibility in-
dicators for a set of websites is costly (Haas
and Unkel, 2017).

2. Search engine results page (SERP) do not
provide more than few information cues
(URL, title and snippet) and the dominant
heuristic happens to be the search engine
(SE) rank itself (Haas and Unkel, 2017).

3. Only around 42.67% of the websites are cov-
ered by the credibility evaluation knowledge
base, where most domains have a low credi-
bility confidence (Liu et al., 2015)

Therefore, automated credibility models play an
important role in the community - although not
broadly explored yet, in practice. In this paper,
we focus on designing computational models to
predict the credibility of a given website rather
than performing sociological experiments or ex-
periments with end users (simulations). In this
scenario, we expect that a website from a domain
such as bbc.com gets a higher trustworthiness
score compared to one from wordpress.com,
for instance.

2 Related Work

Credibility is an important research subject in sev-
eral different communities and has been the sub-
ject of study over the past decades. Most of the
research, however, focuses on theoretical aspects
of credibility and its persuasive effect on differ-
ent fundamental problems, such as economic the-
ories (Sobel, 1985).

2.1 Fundamental Research

A thorough examination of psychological aspects
in evaluating documents credibility has been stud-
ied (Fogg and Tseng, 1999; Fogg et al., 2001,
2003), which reports numerous challenges. Apart
from sociological experiments, Web Credibility -

in a more practical perspective - has a different fo-
cus of research, described as follows:

Rating Systems, Simulations are mostly
platform-based solutions to conduct experiments
(mostly using private data) in order to detect cred-
ibility factors. Nakamura et al. (2007) surveyed
internet users from all age groups to understand
how they identified trustworthy websites. Based
on the results of this survey, they built a graph-
based ranking method which helped users in gaug-
ing the trustworthiness of search results retrieved
by a search engine when issued a queryQ. A study
by Stanford University revealed important factors
that people notice when assessing website credi-
bility (Fogg et al., 2003), mostly visual aspects
(web site design, look and information design).
The writing style and bias of information play a
small role as defining the level of credibility (se-
lected by approximately 10% of the comments).
However, this process of evaluating the credibil-
ity of web pages by users is impacted only by
the number of heuristics they are aware of (Fogg,
2003), biasing the human evaluation w.r.t. a lim-
ited and specific set features. An important fac-
tor considered by humans to judge credibility re-
lies on the search engine results page (SERP).
The higher ranked a website is when compared
to other retrieved websites the more credible peo-
ple judge a website to be (Schwarz and Morris,
2011). Popularity is yet another major credibility
factor (Giudice, 2010). Liu et al. (2015) proposed
to integrate recommendation functionality into a
Web Credibility Evaluation System (WCES), fo-
cusing on the user’s feedback. Shah et al. (2015)
propose a full list of important features for credi-
bility aspects, such as 1) the quality of the design
of the website and 2) how well the information is
structured. In particular, the perceived accuracy
of the information was ranked only in 6th place.
Thus, superficial website characteristics as heuris-
tics play a key role in credibility evaluation. Dong
et al (2015) propose a different method (KBT) to
estimate the trustworthiness of a web source based
on the information given by the source (i.e., ap-
plies fact-checking to infer credibility). This in-
formation is represented in the form of triples ex-
tracted from the web source. The trustworthiness
of the source is determined by the correctness of
the triples extracted. Thus, the score is computed
based on endogenous (e.g., correctness of facts)
signals rather then exogenous signals (e.g., links).

Unfortunately, this research from Google does not
provide open data. It is worth mentioning that -
surprisingly - their hypothesis (content is more im-
portant than visual) contradicts previous research
findings (Fogg et al., 2003; Shah et al., 2015).
While this might be due to the dynamic character-
istic of the Web, this contradiction highlights the
need for more research into the real use of web
credibility factors w.r.t. automated web credibility
models. Similar to (Nakamura et al., 2007), Singal
and Kohli (2016) proposes a tool (dubbed TNM)
to re-rank URLs extracted from Google search en-
gine according to the trust maintained by the ac-
tual users). Apart from the search engine API,
their tool uses several other APIs to collect web-
site usage information (e.g., traffic and engage-
ment info). (Kakol et al., 2017) perform extensive
crowdsourcing experiments that contain credibil-
ity evaluations, textual comments, and labels for
these comments.

SPAM/phishing detection: Abbasi et
al. (2010) propose a set of design guidelines
which advocated the development of SLT-based
classification systems for fraudulent website
detection, i.e., despite seeming credible - websites
that try to obtain private information and defraud
visitors. PhishZoo (Afroz and Greenstadt, 2011)
is a phishing detection system which helps users
in identifying phishing websites which look simi-
lar to a given set of protected websites through the
creation of profiles.

2.2 Automated Web Credibility

Automated Web Credibility models for website
classification are not broadly explored, in practice.
The aim is to produce a predictive model given
training data (annotated website ranks) regardless
of an input queryQ. Existing gold standard data is
generated from surveys and simulations (see Rat-
ing Systems, Simulations related work). Currently,
state of the art (SOTA) experiments rely on the
Microsoft Credibility dataset1 (Schwarz and Mor-
ris, 2011). Recent research use the website label
(Likert scale) released in the Microsoft dataset as
a gold standard to train automated web credibility
models, as follows:

Olteanu et al. (2013) proposes a number of
properties (37 linguistic and textual features) and

1It is worth mentioning that this survey is mostly based on
confidential data and it is not available to the open community
(e.g., overall popularity, popularity among domain experts,
geo-location of users and number of awards)

applies machine learning methods to recognize
trust levels, obtaining 22 relevant features for
the task. Wawer et al. (2014) improve this
work using psychosocial and psycholinguistic fea-
tures (through The General Inquirer (GI) Lexical
Database (Stone and Hunt, 1963)) achieving state
of the art results.

Finally, another resource is the Content Credi-
bility Corpus (C3) (Kakol et al., 2017), the largest
Web credibility Corpus publicity available so far.
However, in this work authors did not perform ex-
periments w.r.t. automated credibility models us-
ing a standard measure (i.e., Likert scale), such as
in (Olteanu et al., 2013; Wawer et al., 2014). In-
stead, they rather focused on evaluating the theo-
ries of web credibility in order to produce a much
larger and richer corpus.

3 Experimental Setup

3.1 State-of-the-art (SOTA) Features
Recent research on credibility factors for web
sites (Olteanu et al., 2013) have initially divided
the features into the following logical groups:

1. Content-based (25 features): number of spe-
cial characters in the text, spelling errors, web
site category and etc..

(a) Text (20 features)
(b) Appearance (4 features)
(c) Meta-information (1 feature)

2. Social-based (12 features): Social Media
Metadata (e.g., Facebook shares, Tweets
pointing to a certain URL, etc.), Page Rank,
Alexa Rank and similar.

(a) Social Popularity (9 features)
(b) General Popularity (1 feature)
(c) Link structure (2 features)

According to (Olteanu et al., 2013), a resultant
number of 22 features (out of 37) were selected
as most significant (10 for content-based and all
social-based features). Surprisingly (but also fol-
lowing (Dong et al., 2015)), none from the sub-
group Appearance, although studies have system-
atically shown the opposite, i.e., that visual aspects
are one of the most important features (Fogg et al.,
2003; Shah et al., 2015; Haas and Unkel, 2017).

In this picture, we claim the most negative as-
pect is the reliance on Social-based features. This
dependency not only affects the final performance



53

of the credibility model, but also implies in finan-
cial costs as well as presenting high discriminative
capacity, adding a strong bias to the performance
of the model2. The computation of these features
relies heavily on external (e.g., Facebook API3 and
AdBlock4) and commercial libraries (Alchemy5,
PageRank6, Alexa Rank7. Thus, engineering and
financial costs are a must. Furthermore, popu-
larity on Facebook or Twitter can be measured
only by data owners. Additionally, vendors may
change the underlying algorithms without further
explanation. Therefore, also following Wawer et
al. (2014), in this paper we have excluded Social-
based features from our experimental setup.

On top of that, (Wawer et al., 2014) incre-
mented the model, adding features extracted from
the General Inquirer (GI) Lexical Database, result-
ing in a vector of 183 extra categories, apart from
the selected 22 base features, i.e. total of 205 fea-
tures (However, this is subject to contradictions.
Please see Section 4.1 for more information).

3.2 Datasets

3.2.1 Website credibility evaluation
Microsoft Dataset (Schwarz and Morris, 2011)
consists of thousands of URLs and their credibil-
ity ratings (five-point Likert Scale8), ranging from
1 (”very non-credible”) to 5 (”very credible”). In
this study, participants were asked to rate the web-
sites as credible following the definition: “A cred-
ible webpage is one whose information one can
accept as the truth without needing to look else-
where”. Studies by (Olteanu et al., 2013; Wawer
et al., 2014) use this dataset for evaluation. Con-
tent Credibility Corpus (C3)9 is the most recent
and the largest credibility dataset currently pub-
licly available for research (Kakol et al., 2017). It
contains 15.750 evaluations of 5.543 URLs from
2.041 participants with some additional informa-
tion about website characteristics and basic demo-
graphic features of users. Among many metadata
information existing in the dataset, in this work
we are only interested in the URLs and their re-

spective five-point Likert scale, so that we obtain
the same information available in the Microsoft
dataset.

3.2.2 Fact-checking influence
In order to verify the impact of our web credibility
model in a real use-case scenario, we ran a fact-
checking framework to verify a set of input claims.
Then we collected the sources (URLs) containing
proofs to support a given claim. We used this as a
dataset to evaluate our web credibility model.

The primary objective is to verify whether our
model is able, on average, to assign lower scores to
the websites that contain proofs supporting claims
which are labeled as false in the FactBench dataset
(i.e., the source is providing false information,
thus should have a lower credibility score). Sim-
ilarly, we expect that websites that support posi-
tive claims are assigned with higher scores (i.e.,
the source is supporting an accurate claim, thus
should have a higher credibility score).

The (gold standard) input claims were obtained
from the FactBench dataset10, a multilingual
benchmark for the evaluation of fact validation al-
gorithms. It contains a set of RDF11 models (10
different relations), where each model contains
a singular fact expressed as a subject-predicate-
object triple. The data was automatically extracted
from DBpedia and Freebase KBs, and manually
curated in order to generate true and false exam-
ples.

The website list extraction was carried out by
DeFacto (Gerber et al., 2015), a fact-checking
framework designed for RDF KBs. DeFacto re-
turns a set of websites as pieces of evidence to sup-
port its prediction (true or false) for a given input
claim.

3.3 Final Features
We implemented a set of Content-based fea-
tures (Section 3.1) adding more lexical and textual
based features. Social-based features were not
considered due to financial costs associated with
paid APIs. The final set of features for each web-
site w is defined as follows:

1. Web Archive: the temporal information w.r.t.
cache and freshness. ∆b and ∆e correspond to
the temporal differences of the first and last 2 up-
dates, respectively. ∆a represents the age ofw and
finally ∆u represents the temporal difference for

words within the page HTML content wc (e.g.,

4. Outbound Links: searches the number of
different outbound links in w ∧ wd ∈ d, i.e.,∑P

n=1 φ(wc) where P is the number of web-based
protocols.

probabilities P for each pre-trained category c of
w w.r.t. the sentences of the website ws and page

_γ(wt). We trained a set of
binary multinomial Naive Bayes (NB) classifiers,
one per class, as follows: business, entertainment,
politics, religion, sports and tech.

6. Text Category - LexRank: reduces the
noisy of wb by classifying only top N sen-
tences generated by applying LexRank (Erkan
and Radev, 2004) over wb (S′ = Γ(wb, N)),
which is a graph-based text summarizing tech-
nique:

∑S′
s′=1 γ(s′)_γ(wt).

7. Text Category - LSA: similarly, we ap-
ply Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Stein-
berger and Jeek, 2004) to detect semantically
important sentences in wb (S′ = Ω(wb, N)):∑S′

s′=1 γ(s′)_γ(wt).
8. Readability Metrics: returns a vector result-

ing of the concatenation of several R readability
metrics (Si and Callan, 2001)

9. SPAM: detects whether the wb or wt are clas-
sified as spam: ψ(wb)_ψ(wt)

10. Social Tags: returns the frequency of social

tags in wb:
R⋃

ϕ(i, wb)

11. OpenSources: returns the open-source clas-
sification (x) for a given website:

x =

1, if w ∈ O
0, if w 6∈ O

12. PageRankCC: PageRank information com-
puted through the CommonCrawl12 Corpus

13. General Inquirer (Stone and Hunt, 1963): a
182-lenght vector containing several lexicons

14. Vader Lexicon: lexicon and rule-based sen-
timent analysis tool that is specifically attuned to
sentiments

15. HTML2Seq: we introduce the concept of
bag-of-tags, where similarly to bag-of-words13 we
group the HTML tag occurrences in each web site.
We additionally explore this concept along with a
sequence problem, i.e. we encode the tags and
evaluate this considering a window size (offset)
from the header of the page.

4 Experiments

Previous research proposes two application set-
tings w.r.t. the classification itself, as follows:
(A.1) casting the credibility problem as a classi-
fication problem and (A.2) evaluating the credi-
bility on a five-point Likert scale (regression). In
the classification scenario, the models are evalu-
ated both w.r.t. the 2-classes as well as 3-classes.
In the 2-classes scenario, websites ranging from 1
to 3 are labeled as “low” whereas 4 and 5 are la-
beled as “high” (credibility). Analogously, in the
3-classes scenario, websites labeled as 1 and 2 are
converted to “low”, 3 remains as “medium” while
4 and 5 are grouped into the “high” class.

We first explore the impact of the bag-of-tags
strategy. We encode and convert the tags into a
sequence of tags, similar to a sequence of sen-
tences (looking for opening and closing tags, e.g.,
<a>and</a>). Therefore, we perform document
classification over the resulting vectors. Figures 1a
to 1d show results of this strategy for both 2 and
3-classes scenarios. The x-axis is the log scale of
the paddings (i.e., the offset of HTML tags we re-
trieved from w, ranging from 25 to 10.000). The
charts reveal an interesting pattern in both gold-
standard datasets (Microsoft Dataset and C3 Cor-
pus): the first tags are the most relevant to pre-
dict the credibility class. Although this strategy
does not achieve state of the art performance14, it
presents reasonable performance by just inspect-
ing website metadata: F1-measures = 0.690 and
0.571 for the 2-classes and 3-classes settings, re-
spectively. However, it is worth mentioning that
the main advantage of this approach lies in the fact
that it is language agnostic (while current research

We then evaluate the performance of the tex-
tual features (Section 3.3) isolated. Results for the
2-classes scenario are presented as follows: Fig-
ure 2a highlights the best models performance us-
ing textual features only. While this as a single
feature does not outperform the lexical features,
when we combine the bag-of-tags approach (pre-
dictions of probabilities for each class) we boost
the performance (F1 from 0.738 to 0.772) and out-
perform state of the art (0.745), as shown in Fig-
ure 2b. Tables 1 to 3 shows detailed results for both
datasets (2-classes, 3-classes and 5-classes config-
urations, respectively). For 5-class regression, we
found that the best pad = 100 for the Microsoft
dataset and best pad = 175 for the C3 Corpus. We
preceded the computing of both classification and
regression models with feature selection accord-
ing to a percentile of the highest scoring features
(SelectKBest). We tested the choice of 3, 5, 10,
25, 50 75 and K=100 percentiles (thus, no selec-
tion) of features and did not find a unique K value
for every case. It is worth noticing that in general
it is easy to detect high credible sources (F1 for
“high” class around 0.80 in all experiments and
both datasets) but recall of “low” credible sources
is still an issue.

the fact-checking algorithm. For 1500 claims, it
collected pieces of evidence for over 27.000 web-
sites. Table 5 depicts the impact of the credibility
model in the fact-checking context. We collected
a small subset of 186 URLs from the FactBench
dataset and manually annotated15 the credibility
for each URL (following the Likert scale). The
model corrected labeled around 80% of the URLs
associated with a positive claim and, more im-
portantly, 70% of non-credible websites linked to
false claims were correctly identified. This helps
to minimize the number of non-credible informa-
tion providers that contain information that sup-
ports a false claim.

4.1 Discussion
Reproducibility is still one of the cornerstones of
science and scientific projects (Baker, 2016). In
the following, we list some relevant issues encoun-
tered while performing our experiments:

Microsoft dataset: presents inconsistencies.
Although all the web pages are cached (in theory)
in order to guarantee a deterministic environment,
the dataset - in its original form16 - has a number
of problems, as follows: (a) web pages not physi-
cally cached (b) URL not matching (dataset links
versus cached files) (c) Invalid file format (e.g.,
PDF). Even though these issues have also been
previously identified by related research (Olteanu
et al., 2013) it is not clear what the URLs for the
final dataset (i.e., the support) are nor where this
new version is available.

Contradictions: w.r.t. the divergence of the im-
portance of visual features have drawn our atten-
tion (Dong et al., 2015) and (Fogg, 2003; Shah
et al., 2015) which corroborate to the need of more
methods to solve the web credibility problem, in
practice. The main hypothesis that supports this
contradiction relies on the fact that feature-based
credibility evaluation eventually ignites cat-and-
mouse play between scientists and people inter-

ested in manipulating the models. In this case,
reinforcement learning methods pose as a good al-
ternative for adaptation.

Proposed features: The acknowledgement
made by authors in (Wawer et al., 2014) that “so-
lutions based purely on external APIs are diffi-
cult to use beyond scientific application and are
prone for manipulation” confirming the need to
exclude social features from research of (Olteanu
et al., 2013) contradicts itself. In the course of ex-
periments, authors mention the usage of all fea-
tures proposed by (Olteanu et al., 2013): “Table
1 presents regression results for the dataset de-
scribed in [13] in its original version (37 features)
and extended with 183 variables from the General
Inquirer (to 221 features)”.

Therefore, due to the number of relevant issues
presented w.r.t. reproducibility and contradiction
of arguments, the comparison to recent research
becomes more difficult. In this work, we solved
the technical issues in the Microsoft dataset and
released a new fixed version17. Also, since we
need to perform evaluations in a deterministic en-
vironment, we cached and released the websites
for the C3 corpus. After scraping, 2.977 URLs
were used (out of 5.543). Others were left due
to processing errors (e.g., 404). The algorithms
and its hyperparameters and further relevant meta-
data are available through the MEX Interchange
Format (Esteves et al., 2015). By doing this, we
provide a computational environment to perform
safer comparisons, being engaged in recent discus-
sions about mechanisms to measure and enhance

5 Conclusion

In this work, we discuss existing alternatives, gaps
and current challenges to tackle the problem of
web credibility. More specifically, we focused on
automated models to compute a credibility fac-
tor for a given website. This research follows the
former studies presented by (Olteanu et al., 2013;
Wawer et al., 2014) and presents several contribu-
tions. First, we propose different features to avoid
the financial cost imposed by external APIs in or-
der to access website credibility indicators. This
issue has become even more relevant in the light
of the challenges that have emerged after the shut-
down of Google PageRank, for instance. To bridge
this gap, we have proposed the concept of bag-
of-tags. Similar to (Wawer et al., 2014), we con-
duct experiments in a highly-dimensional feature
space, but also considering web page metadata,
which outperforms state of the art results in the 2-
classes and 5-classes settings. Second, we identi-
fied and fixed several problems on a gold standard
dataset for web credibility (Microsoft), as well as
indexed several web pages for the C3 Corpus. Fi-
nally, we evaluate the impact of the model in a
real fact-checking use-case. We show that the pro-
posed model can help in belittling and supporting
different websites that contain evidence of true and
false claims, which helps the very challenging fact
verification task. As future work, we plan to ex-
plore deep learning methods over the HTML2Seq
module.
