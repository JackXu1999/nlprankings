Abstract

In this paper we introduce Latent Tree Lan-
guage Model (LTLM), a novel approach to
language modeling that encodes syntax and
semantics of a given sentence as a tree of word
roles.

The learning phase iteratively updates the
trees by moving nodes according to Gibbs
sampling. We introduce two algorithms to in-
fer a tree for a given sentence. The first one is
based on Gibbs sampling. It is fast, but does
not guarantee to find the most probable tree.
The second one is based on dynamic program-
ming. It is slower, but guarantees to find the
most probable tree. We provide comparison
of both algorithms.

We combine LTLM with 4-gram Modified
Kneser-Ney language model via linear inter-
polation. Our experiments with English and
Czech corpora show significant perplexity re-
ductions (up to 46% for English and 49%
for Czech) compared with standalone 4-gram
Modified Kneser-Ney language model.

1 Introduction

Language modeling is one of the core disciplines
in natural language processing (NLP). Automatic
speech recognition, machine translation, optical
character recognition, and other tasks strongly de-
pend on the language model (LM). An improve-
ment in language modeling often leads to better
performance of the whole task. The goal of lan-
guage modeling is to determine the joint probabil-
ity of a sentence. Currently, the dominant approach
is n-gram language modeling, which decomposes

the joint probability into the product of conditional
probabilities by using the chain rule. In traditional
n-gram LMs the words are represented as distinct
symbols. This leads to an enormous number of word
combinations.

In the last years many researchers have tried to
capture words contextual meaning and incorporate
it into the LMs. Word sequences that have never
been seen before receive high probability when they
are made of words that are semantically similar to
words forming sentences seen in training data. This
ability can increase the LM performance because it
reduces the data sparsity problem. In NLP a very
common paradigm for word meaning representation
is the use of the Distributional hypothesis. It sug-
gests that two words are expected to be semanti-
cally similar if they occur in similar contexts (they
are similarly distributed in the text) (Harris, 1954).
Models based on this assumption are denoted as dis-
tributional semantic models (DSMs).

Recently, semantically motivated LMs have be-
gun to surpass the ordinary n-gram LMs. The most
commonly used architectures are neural network
LMs (Bengio et al., 2003; Mikolov et al., 2010;
Mikolov et al., 2011) and class-based LMs. Class-
based LMs are more related to this work thus we
investigate them deeper.

Brown et al. (1992) introduced class-based LMs
of English. Their unsupervised algorithm searches
classes consisting of words that are most probable
in the given context (one word window in both di-
rections). However, the computational complex-
ity of this algorithm is very high. This approach
was later extended by (Martin et al., 1998; Whit-

436



taker and Woodland, 2003) to improve the complex-
ity and to work with wider context. Deschacht et
al. (2012) used the same idea and introduced La-
tent Words Language Model (LWLM), where word
classes are latent variables in a graphical model.
They apply Gibbs sampling or the expectation max-
imization algorithm to discover the word classes
that are most probable in the context of surround-
ing word classes. A similar approach was pre-
sented in (Brychcı́n and Konopı́k, 2014; Brychcı́n
and Konopı́k, 2015), where the word clusters de-
rived from various semantic spaces were used to im-
prove LMs.

In above mentioned approaches, the meaning of a
word is inferred from the surrounding words inde-
pendently of their relation. An alternative approach
is to derive contexts based on the syntactic relations
the word participates in. Such syntactic contexts are
automatically produced by dependency parse-trees.
Resulting word representations are usually less top-
ical and exhibit more functional similarity (they are
more syntactically oriented) as shown in (Padó and
Lapata, 2007; Levy and Goldberg, 2014).

Dependency-based methods for syntactic parsing
have become increasingly popular in NLP in the last
years (Kübler et al., 2009). Popel and Mareček
(2010) showed that these methods are promising
direction of improving LMs. Recently, unsuper-
vised algorithms for dependency parsing appeared
in (Headden III et al., 2009; Cohen et al., 2009;
Spitkovsky et al., 2010; Spitkovsky et al., 2011;
Mareček and Straka, 2013) offering new possibili-
ties even for poorly-resourced languages.

In this work we introduce a new DSM that uses
tree-based context to create word roles. The word
role contains the words that are similarly distributed
over similar tree-based contexts. The word role
encodes the semantic and syntactic properties of a
word. We do not rely on parse trees as a prior knowl-
edge, but we jointly learn the tree structures and
word roles. Our model is a soft clustering, i.e. one
word may be present in several roles. Thus it is the-
oretically able to capture the word polysemy. The
learned structure is used as a LM, where each word
role is conditioned on its parent role. We present the
unsupervised algorithm that discovers the tree struc-
tures only from the distribution of words in a training
corpus (i.e. no labeled data or external sources of in-

formation are needed). In our work we were inspired
by class-based LMs (Deschacht et al., 2012), unsu-
pervised dependency parsing (Mareček and Straka,
2013), and tree-based DSMs (Levy and Goldberg,
2014).

This paper is organized as follows. We start with
the definition of our model (Section 2). The pro-
cess of learning the hidden sentence structures is ex-
plained in Section 3. We introduce two algorithms
for searching the most probable tree for a given sen-
tence (Section 4). The experimental results on En-
glish and Czech corpora are presented in Section 6.
We conclude in Section 7 and offer some directions
for future work.

2 Latent Tree Language Model

In this section we describe Latent Tree Language
Model (LTLM). LTLM is a generative statistical
model that discovers the tree structures hidden in the
text corpus.

Let L be a word vocabulary with total of |L| dis-
tinct words. Assume we have a training corpus w
divided into S sentences. The goal of LTLM or
other LMs is to estimate the probability of a text
P (w). Let Ns denote the number of words in the
s-th sentence. The s-th sentence is a sequence of
words ws = {ws,i}Nsi=0, where ws,i ∈ L is a word
at position i in this sentence and ws,0 = < s > is
an artificial symbol that is added at the beginning of
each sentence.

Each sentence s is associated with the dependency
graph Gs. We define the dependency graph as a
labeled directed graph, where nodes correspond to
the words in the sentence and there is a label for
each node that we call role. Formally, it is a triple
Gs = (V s,Es, rs) consisting of:

• The set of nodes V s = {0, 1, ..., Ns}. Each
token ws,i is associated with node i ∈ V s.
• The set of edges Es ⊆ V s × V s.
• The sequence of roles rs = {rs,i}Nsi=0, where
1 ≤ rs,i ≤ K for i ∈ V s. K is the number of
roles.

The artificial word ws,0 = < s > at the beginning
of the sentence has always role 1 (rs,0 = 1). Anal-
ogously to w, the sequence of all rs is denoted as r
and sequence of allGs asG.

437



Figure 1: Example of LTLM for the sentence ”Ev-
erything has beauty, but not everyone sees it.”

Edge e ∈ Es is an ordered pair of nodes (i, j).
We say that i is the head or the parent and j is the
dependent or the child. We use the notation i → j
for such edge. The directed path from node i to node
j is denoted as i ∗→ j.

We place a few constraints on the graphGs.

• The graphGs is a tree. It means it is the acyclic
graph (if i → j then not j ∗→ i), where each
node has one parent (if i → j then not k → j
for every k 6= i).

• The graph Gs is projective (there are no cross
edges). For each edge (i, j) and for each k be-
tween i and j (i.e. i < k < j or i > k > j)
there must exist the directed path i ∗→ k.

• The graphGs is always rooted in the node 0.

We denote these graphs as the projective depen-
dency trees. Example of such a tree is on Figure 1.
For the treeGs we define a function

hs(j) = i, when (i, j) ∈ Es (1)

that returns the parent for each node except the root.
We use graph Gs as a representation of the

Bayesian network with random variables Es and
rs. The roles rs,i represent the node labels and the
edges express the dependences between the roles.
The conditional probability of the role at position
i given its parent role is denoted as P (rs,i|rs,hs(i)).
The conditional probability of the word at position
i in the sentence given its role rs,i is denoted as
P (ws,i|rs,i).

We model the distribution over words in the sen-
tence s as the mixture

P (ws) = P (ws|rs,0) =
Ns∏

i=1

K∑

k=1

P (ws,i|rs,i = k)P (rs,i = k|rs,hs(i)). (2)

The root role is kept fixed for each sentence (rs,0
= 1) so P (ws) = P (ws|rs,0).

We look at the roles as mixtures over child roles
and simultaneously as mixtures over words. We can
represent dependency between roles with a set of K
multinomial distributions θ over K roles, such that
P (rs,i|rs,hs(i) = k) = θ

(k)
rs,i . Simultaneously, de-

pendency of words on their roles can be represented
as a set of K multinomial distributions φ over |L|
words, such that P (ws,i|rs,i = k) = φ(k)ws,i . To make
predictions about new sentences, we need to assume
a prior distribution on the parameters θ(k) and φ(k).

We place a Dirichlet prior D with the vector of
K hyper-parameters α on a multinomial distribu-
tion θ(k) ∼ D(α) and with the vector of |L| hyper-
parameters β on a multinomial distribution φ(k) ∼
D(β). In general, D is not restricted to be Dirichlet
distribution. It could be any distribution over dis-
crete children, such as logistic normal. In this paper,
we focus only on Dirichlet as a conjugate prior to
the multinomial distribution and derive the learning
algorithm under this assumption.

The choice of the child role depends only on its
parent role, i.e. child roles with the same parent are
mutually independent. This property is especially
important for the learning algorithm (Section 3) and
also for searching the most probable trees (Section
4). We do not place any assumption on the length of
the sentence Ns or on how many children the parent
node is expected to have.

3 Parameter Estimation

In this section we present the learning algorithm for
LTLM. The goal is to estimate θ and φ in a way
that maximizes the predictive ability of the model
(generates the corpus with maximal joint probability
P (w)).

Let χk(i,j) be an operation that changes the treeGs
toG′s

χk(i,j) : Gs → G′s, (3)

438



such that the newly created tree G′(V ′s,E
′
s, r
′
s)

consists of:

• V ′s = V s.
• E′s = (Es \ {(hs(i), i)}) ∪ {(j, i)}.

• r′s,a =
{
rs,a for a 6= i
k for a = i

, where 0 ≤ a ≤ Ns.

It means that we change the role of the selected
node i so that rs,i = k and simultaneously we
change the parent of this node to be j. We call this
operation a partial change.

The newly created graph G′ must satisfy all con-
ditions presented in Section 2, i.e. it is a projec-
tive dependency tree rooted in the node 0. Thus not
all partial changes χk(i,j) are possible to perform on
graphGs.

Clearly, for the sentence s there is at most
Ns(1+Ns)

2 parent changes
1.

To estimate the parameters of LTLM we apply
Gibbs sampling and gradually sample χk(i,j) for trees
Gs. For doing so we need to determine the posterior
predictive distribution2

G′s ∼ P (χk(i,j)(Gs)|w,G), (4)
from which we will sample partial changes to update
the trees. In the equation, G denote the sequence of
all trees for given sentences w and G′s is a result of
one sampling. In the following text we derive this
equation under assumptions from Section 2.

The posterior predictive distribution of Dirichlet
multinomial has the form of additive smoothing that
is well known in the context of language modeling.
The hyper-parameters of Dirichlet prior determine
how much is the predictive distribution smoothed.
Thus the predictive distribution for the word-in-role
distribution can be expressed as

P (ws,i|rs,i,w\s,i, r\s,i) =
n
(ws,i|rs,i)
\s,i + β

n
(•|rs,i)
\s,i + |L|β

, (5)

1The most parent changes are possible for the special case
of the tree, where each node i has parent i − 1. Thus for each
node i we can change its parent to any node j < i and keep the
projectivity of the tree. That is Ns(1+Ns)

2
possibilities.

2The posterior predictive distribution is the distribution of
an unobserved variable conditioned by the observed data, i.e.
P (Xn+1|X1, ..., Xn), where Xi are i.i.d. (independent and
identically distributed random variables).

where n(ws,i|rs,i)\s,i is the number of times the role
rs,i has been assigned to the word ws,i, exclud-
ing the position i in the s-th sentence. The sym-
bol • represents any word in the vocabulary so that
n
(•|rs,i)
\s,i =

∑
l∈L n

(l|rs,i)
\s,i . We use the symmetric

Dirichlet distribution for the word-in-role probabili-
ties as it could be difficult to estimate the vector of
hyper-parameters β for large word vocabulary. In
the above mentioned equation, β is a scalar.

The predictive distribution for the role-by-role
distribution is

P
(
rs,i|rs,hs(i), r\s,i

)
=
n
(rs,i|rs,hs(i))
\s,i + αrs,i

n
(•|rs,hs(i))
\s,i +

K∑
k=1

αk

. (6)

Analogously to the previous equation,
n
(rs,i|rs,hs(i))
\s,i denote the number of times the

role rs,i has the parent role rs,hs(i), excluding the
position i in the s-th sentence. The symbol •
represents any possible role to make the probability
distribution summing up to 1. We assume an
asymmetric Dirichlet distribution.

We can use predictive distributions of above men-
tioned Dirichlet multinomials to express the joint
probability that the role at position i is k (rs,i = k)
with parent at position j conditioned on current val-
ues of all variables, except those in position i in the
sentence s

P (rs,i = k, j|w, r\s,i) ∝
P (ws,i|rs,i = k,w\s,i, r\s,i)

× P (rs,i = k|rs,j , r\s,i)
× ∏
a:hs(a)=i

P (rs,a|rs,i = k, r\s,i).
(7)

The choice of the node i role affects the word that
is produced by this role and also all the child roles
of the node i. Simultaneously, the role of the node
i depends on its parent j role. Formula 7 is derived
from the joint probability of a sentence s and a tree
Gs, where all probabilities which do not depend on
the choice of the role at position i are removed and
equality is replaced by proportionality (∝).

We express the final predictive distribution for
sampling partial changes χk(i,j) as

439



P (χk(i,j)(Gs)|w,G) ∝
P (rs,i = k, j|w, r\s,i)
P (rs,i, hs(i)|w, r\s,i)

(8)
that is essentially the fraction between the joint
probability of rs,i and its parent after the partial
change and before the partial change (conditioned
on all other variables). This fraction can be in-
terpreted as the necessity to perform this partial
change.

We investigate two strategies of sampling partial
changes:

• Per sentence: We sample a single partial
change according to Equation 8 for each sen-
tence in the training corpus. It means during
one pass through the corpus (one iteration) we
perform S partial changes.

• Per position: We sample a partial change for
each position in each sentence. We perform in
totalN =

∑S
s=1Ns partial changes during one

pass. Note that the denominator in Equation 8
is constant for this strategy and can be removed.

We compare both training strategies in Section 6.
After enough training iterations, we can estimate the
conditional probabilities φ(k)l and θ

(p)
k from actual

samples as

φ
(k)
l ≈

n(ws,i=l|rs,i=k) + β

n(•|rs,i=k) + |L|β (9)

θ
(p)
k ≈

n(rs,i=k|rs,hs(i)=p) + αk

n(•|rs,hs(i)=p) +
K∑

m=1
αm

. (10)

These equations are similar to equations 5 and 6, but
here the counts n do not exclude any position in a
corpus.

Note that in the Gibbs sampling equation, we
assume that the Dirichlet parameters α and β are
given. We use a fixed point iteration technique de-
scribed in (Minka, 2003) to estimate them.

4 Inference

In this section we present two approaches for search-
ing the most probable tree for a given sentence as-
suming we have already estimated the parameters θ
and φ.

(a) The root has two or more children.

(b) The root has only one child.

Figure 2: Searching the most probable subtrees.

4.1 Non-deterministic Inference

We use the same sampling technique as for estimat-
ing parameters (Equation 8), i.e. we iteratively sam-
ple the partial changes χk(i,j). However, we use equa-
tions 9 and 10 for predictive distributions of Dirich-
let multinomials instead of 5 and 6. In fact, these
equations correspond to the predictive distributions
over the newly added wordws,i with the role rs,i into
the corpus, conditioned on w and r. This sampling
technique rarely finds the best solution, but often it
is very near.

4.2 Deterministic Inference

Here we present the deterministic algorithm that
guarantees to find the most probable tree for a given
sentence. We were inspired by Cocke-Younger-
Kasami (CYK) algorithm (Lange and Leiß, 2009).

Let T ns,a,c denote the subtree of Gs (subgraph
of Gs that is also a tree) containing subsequence
of nodes {a, a + 1, ..., c}. The superscript n de-
notes the number of children the root of this sub-
tree has. We denote the joint probability of a sub-
tree from position a to position c with the cor-
responding words conditioned by the root role k
as Pn({ws,i}ci=a,T ns,a,c|k). Our goal is to find
the tree Gs = T 1+s,0,Ns that maximizes probability
P (ws,Gs) = P

1+({ws,i}Nsi=0,T 1+s,0,Ns |0).
Similarly to CYK algorithm, our approach fol-

lows bottom-up direction and goes through all pos-
sible subsequences for a sentence (sequence of
words). At the beginning, the probabilities for sub-
sequences of length 1 (i.e. single words) are calcu-
lated as P 1+({ws,a},T 1+s,a,a|k) = P (ws,a|rs,a = k).
Once it has considered subsequences of length 1, it
goes on to subsequences of length 2, and so on.

Thanks to mutual independence of roles under the
same parent, we can find the most probable subtree
with the root role k and with at least two root chil-
dren according to

P 2+({ws,i}ci=a,T 2+s,a,c|k) = max
b:a<b<c

[P 1+({ws,i}bi=a,T 1+s,a,b|k)×
P 1+({ws,i}ci=b+1,T 1+s,b+1,c|k)]. (11)

It means we merge two neighboring subtrees with
the same root role k. This is the reason why the new
subtree has at least two root children. This formula
is visualized on Figure 2a. Unfortunately, this does
not cover all subtree cases. We find the most proba-
ble tree with only root child as follows

P 1({ws,i}ci=a,T 1s,a,c|k) = max
b,m:a≤b≤c,1≤m≤K

[P (ws,b|rs,b = m)× P (rs,b = m|k)×
P 1+({ws,i}b−1i=a ,T 1+s,a,b−1|m)×
P 1+({ws,i}ci=b+1,T 1+s,b+1,c|m)]. (12)

This formula is visualized on Figure 2b.
To find the most probable subtree no matter how

many children the root has, we need to take the
maximum from both mentioned equations P 1+ =
max(P 2+, P 1).

The algorithm has complexity O(N3sK2), i.e. it
has cubic dependence on the length of the sentence
Ns.

5 Side-dependent LTLM

Until now, we presented LTLM in its simplified ver-
sion. In role-by-role probabilities (role conditioned
on its parent role) we did not distinguish whether the
role is on the left side or the right side of the parent.
However, this position keeps important information
about the syntax of words (and their roles).

We assume separate multinomial distributions θ̇
for roles that are on the left and θ̈ for roles on the
right. Each of them has its own Dirichlet prior with
hyper-parameters α̇ and α̈, respectively. The pro-
cess of estimating LTLM parameters is almost the
same. The only difference is that we need to rede-
fine the predictive distribution for the role-by-role
distribution (Equation 6) to include only counts of
roles on the appropriate side. Also, every time the
role-by-role probability is used we need to distin-
guish sides:

P (rs,i|rs,hs(i)) =
{
θ̇
(rs,hs(i))
rs,i for i < hs(i))

θ̈
(rs,hs(i))
rs,i for i > hs(i))

.

(13)
In the following text we always assume the side-

dependent LTLM.

6 Experimental Results and Discussion

In this section we present experiments with LTLM
on two languages, English (EN) and Czech (CS).

As a training corpus we use CzEng 1.0 (Bojar
et al., 2012) of the sentence-parallel Czech-English
corpus. We choose this corpus because it contains
multiple domains, it is of reasonable length, and it
is parallel so we can easily provide comparison be-
tween both languages. The corpus is divided into
100 similarly-sized sections. We use parts 0–97 for
training, the part 98 as a development set, and the
last part 99 for testing.

We have removed all sentences longer than 30
words. The reason was that the complexity of the
learning phase and the process of searching most
probable trees depends on the length of sentences.
It has led to removing approximately a quarter of
all sentences. The corpus is available in a tokenized
form so the only preprocessing step we use is lower-
casing. We keep the vocabulary of 100,000 most fre-
quent words in the corpus for both languages. The
less frequent words were replaced by the symbol
<unk>. Statistics for the final corpora are shown
in Table 1.

We measure the quality of LTLM by perplexity
that is the standard measure used for LMs. Perplex-
ity is a measure of uncertainty. The lower perplexity
means the better predictive ability of the LM.

perplexities in every 100th iteration.

P (w,G) , where N is the number of all words in
the training data w.

As we describe in Section 3, there are two ap-
proaches for the parameter estimation of LTLM.
During our experiments, we found that the per-
position strategy of training has the ability to con-
verge faster, but to a worse solution compared to the
per-sentence strategy which converges slower, but to
a better solution.

We train LTLM by 500 iterations of the per-
position sampling followed by another 500 iterations
of the per-sentence sampling. This proves to be effi-

cient in both aspects, the reasonable speed of con-
vergence and the satisfactory predictive ability of
the model. The learning curves are showed on Fig-
ure 3. We present the models with 10, 20, 50, 100,
200, 500, and 1000 roles. The higher role cardinal-
ity models were not possible to create because of
the very high computational requirements. Similarly
to the training of LTLM, the non-deterministic in-
ference uses 100 iterations of per-position sampling
followed by 100 iterations of per-sentence sampling.

In the following experiments we measure how
well LTLM generalizes the learned patterns, i.e.
how well it works on the previously unseen data.
Again, we measure the perplexity, but of prob-
ability P (w) for mutual comparison with differ-
ent LMs that are based on different architectures
(PPX(P (w)) = N

√
1

P (w) ).

To show the strengths of LTLM we compare
it with several state-of-the-art LMs. We experi-
ment with Modified Kneser-Ney (MKN) interpola-
tion (Chen and Goodman, 1998), with Recurrent
Neural Network LM (RNNLM) (Mikolov et al.,
2010; Mikolov et al., 2011)3, and with LWLM (De-

MST parser (McDonald et al., 2005). We use the
same architecture as for LTLM and experiment with
two approaches to represent the roles. Firstly, the
roles are given by the part-of-speech tag (denoted as
PoS STLM). No training is required, all information
come from CzEng corpus. Secondly, we learn the
roles using the same algorithm as for LTLM. The
only difference is that the trees are kept unchanged.
Note that both deterministic and non-deterministic
inference perform almost the same in this model so
we do not distinguish between them.

We combine baseline 4-gram MKN model with
other models via linear combination (in the tables
denoted by the symbol +) that is simple but very ef-
ficient technique to combine LMs. Final probability
is then expressed as

P (w) =
S∏

s=1

Ns∏

i=1

[
λP LM1 + (λ− 1)P LM2

]
. (14)

In the case of MKN the probability PMKN is the
probability of a word ws,i conditioned by 3 previous
words with MKN smoothing. For LTLM or STLM
this probability is defined as

P LTLM(ws,i|rs,hs(i)) =
K∑

k=1

P (ws,i|rs,i = k)P (rs,i = k|rs,hs(i)). (15)

We use the expectation maximization algorithm
(Dempster et al., 1977) for the maximum likelihood
estimate of λ parameter on the development part of
the corpus. The influence of the number of roles
on the perplexity is shown in Table 3 and the final

results are shown in Table 2. Note that these per-
plexities are not comparable with those on Figure
3 (PPX(P (w)) vs. PPX(P (w,G))). Weights of
LTLM and STLM when interpolated with MKN LM
are shown on Figure 4.

From the tables we can see several important
findings. Standalone LTLM performs worse than
MKN on both languages, however their combi-
nation leads to dramatic improvements compared
with other LMs. Best results are achieved by 4-
gram MKN interpolated with 1000 roles LTLM and
the deterministic inference. The perplexity was
improved by approximately 46% on English and
49% on Czech compared with standalone MKN.
The deterministic inference outperformed the non-
deterministic one in all cases. LTLM also signifi-

cantly outperformed STLM where the syntactic de-
pendency trees were provided as a prior knowledge.
The joint learning of syntax and semantics of a sen-
tence proved to be more suitable for predicting the
words.

An in-depth analysis of semantic and syntactic
properties of LTLM is beyond the scope of this pa-
per. For better insight into the behavior of LTLM,
we show the most probable word substitutions for
one selected sentence (see Table 4). We can see
that the original words are often on the front po-
sitions. Also it seems that LTLM is more syntac-
tically oriented, which confirms claims from (Levy
and Goldberg, 2014; Padó and Lapata, 2007), but to
draw such conclusions a deeper analysis is required.
The properties of the model strongly depends on
the number of distinct roles. We experimented with
maximally 1000 roles. To catch the meaning of var-
ious words in natural language, more roles may be
needed. However, with our current implementation,
it was intractable to train LTLM with more roles in
a reasonable time. Training 1000 roles LTLM took
up to two weeks on a powerful computational unit.

7 Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper we introduced the Latent Tree Lan-
guage Model. Our model discovers the latent tree
structures hidden in natural text and uses them to
predict the words in a sentence. Our experiments
with English and Czech corpora showed dramatic
improvements in the predictive ability compared
with standalone Modified Kneser-Ney LM. Our Java
implementation is available for research purposes at
https://github.com/brychcin/LTLM.

It was beyond the scope of this paper to explic-
itly test the semantic and syntactic properties of the
model. As the main direction for future work we
plan to investigate these properties for example by
comparison with human-assigned judgments. Also,
we want to test our model in different NLP tasks
(e.g. speech recognition, machine translation, etc.).

We think that the role-by-role distribution should
depend on the distance between the parent and the
child, but our preliminary experiments were not met
with success. We plan to elaborate on this assump-
tion. Another idea we want to explore is to use
different distributions as a prior to multinomials.
For example, Blei and Lafferty (2006) showed that
the logistic-normal distribution works well for topic
modeling because it captures the correlations be-
tween topics. The same idea might work for roles.
