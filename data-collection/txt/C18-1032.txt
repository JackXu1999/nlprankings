Abstract

The exponential increase in the usage of Wikipedia as a key source of scientific knowledge among
the researchers is making it absolutely necessary to metamorphose this knowledge repository
into an integral and self-contained source of information for direct utilization. Unfortunately,
the references which support the content of each Wikipedia entity page, are far from complete.
Why are the reference section ill-formed for most Wikipedia pages? Is this section edited as
frequently as the other sections of a page? Can there be appropriate surrogates that can auto-
matically enhance the reference section? In this paper, we propose a novel two step approach
– WikiRef – that (i) leverages the wikilinks present in a scientific Wikipedia target page and,
thereby, (ii) recommends highly relevant references to be included in that target page appropri-
ately and automatically borrowed from the reference section of the wikilinks. In the first step,
we build a classifier to ascertain whether a wikilink is a potential source of reference or not. In
the following step, we recommend references to the target page from the reference section of
the wikilinks that are classified as potential sources of references in the first step. We perform an
extensive evaluation of our approach on datasets from two different domains – Computer Science
and Physics. For Computer Science we achieve a notably good performance with a precision@1
of 0.44 for reference recommendation as opposed to 0.38 obtained from the most competitive
baseline. For the Physics dataset, we obtain a similar performance boost of 10% with respect to
the most competitive baseline.

1 Introduction

Wikipedia, the largest online encyclopedia, is a collaborative work of 33,778,487 users and 1,210 ad-
mins, with 5,662,889 English articles and a total of 45,132,517 articles in more than 250 languages as
of June 7, 20181. Introduced in 2001, it has become one of the most visited websites having global
Alexa Rank – 52. Each Wikipedia article contains a rich collection of concepts along with a set of hyper-
links associating crucial terms to other wiki pages (termed as wikilinks), which makes the article more
comprehensive. In addition, the ability to edit the entity pages easily with proper source citations and
to view the edits reflected in the pages timely are some of the key reasons behind Wikipedia’s growth
and popularity. As a consequence, Wikipedia has become a destination of all kinds of information about

entities and events. Further, Wikipedia is being widely utilized by many applications focused on entity
linking and disambiguation (Moro et al., 2014; Hachey et al., 2013; Cucerzan, 2007; Hoffart et al., 2011),
named entity disambiguation (Cucerzan, 2007; Barrena et al., 2015), semantic similarity (Gabrilovich
and Markovitch, 2007; Wu and Giles, 2015), information extraction (Wu and Weld, 2010) etc.
What is lacking? Nevertheless, there are different competing opinions among the researchers regarding
the reliability, integrity and usage of Wikipedia as an authentic source of scientific information. While
many researchers consider Wikipedia as a valuable resource, others question the accuracy, comprehen-
siveness and completeness of the articles. For instance, according to Gorman (2007), Wikipedia is an
“unethical resource unworthy of our respect” whereas Orlowski (2005) questions that the technology
which makes Wikipedia possible is not a substitute for expert editors, and poor writing will remain un-
avoidable without any expertise. Chesney (2006) conducted an experiment to evaluate the credibility of
Wikipedia and found that the studies focusing only on history articles provide mixed evidence concern-
ing its accuracy. The general solution is to post-process the edits done by the users. In order to ensure
the accuracy and quality of writing of articles, Wikipedia has imposed a new policy of requiring senior
editors to approve changes to articles.

Even then, the completeness of the article is not fully ensured. Not all Wikipedia pages referring
to entities (entity pages) are comprehensive: relevant information can either be missing or added with
a delay. In addition, the frequency of editing of different sections in a given Wikipedia article varies
extensively. For instance, frequency of editing text is higher than frequency of editing wikilinks or
references; also add/edit references is considered as the hardest task3. This opens up the requirement for
an automated system which increases the number of relevant references by either processing the content
of the target article itself or by appropriately collating references from alternative sources so as to make
the overall information content of the article more complete.
State-of-the-art: Efforts have been made by the researchers to populate Wikipedia pages automat-
ically. Sauper and Barzilay (2009) propose an approach for populating Wikipedia pages with con-
tent coming from external sources by automatically generating whole entity pages for specific entity
classes. Taneva and Weikum (2013) propose an approach to generate novel summaries from the external
information which could be added to Wikipedia entity pages. Balog and Ramampiaro (2013) and Balog
et al. (2013) try to recommend news citations for an entity in Wikipedia. West et al. (2014) focuses on
the problem of knowledge base completion, through question answering and tries to complete missing
facts in Freebase based on templates. All these works significantly rely on high quality input sources
which are utilized to extract textual facts for Wikipedia page population. In one of the recent works, Fe-
tahu et al. (2015) propose a two-stage supervised approach for suggesting news articles corresponding
to entity pages. Attempt has also been made to introduce appropriate wikilinks automatically (İkıkat et
al., 2015). In a similar line, Raganato et al. (2016) present the automatic construction and evaluation of
a Semantically Enriched Wikipedia (SEW) in which the overall number of wikilinks has been more than
tripled. Efforts have also been made to generate Wikipedia articles of named entities in a semi-supervised
framework (Pochampally et al., 2016).
Motivation: Recently, with the increasing number of scientific articles and with the need for getting
an overall view of a particular scientific topic within a very less amount of time, researcher’s tendency
of referring to the Wikipedia pages instead of going through a set of very specific scientific articles is
massively increasing. Given that, such a huge community of researchers rely on Wikipedia for scientific
information, it becomes absolutely necessary to deeply focus on the completeness of the Wikipedia
articles which talk about some scientific topics.

In the following we enlist some initial observations to show that there is a huge scope of improve-
ment of the scientific Wikipedia articles through the inclusion of a proper set of references. Figure 1
illustrates the snapshot of the reference section of the ‘Bigram’ page4 in the year 2018. There are only
five references present in the page; very relevant scientific articles like, “Statistical Identification of
Language” (Dunning, 1994), “Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing” (Manning and

Schütze, 1999), etc. are missing, without which the article seems to be incomplete. Also from the survey
conducted by wikimedia 5 it has been observed that adding or editing the reference section is harder
compared to adding or editing simple text or a wikilink which therefore leads to much less frequent
changes of the reference section. In order to further confirm this trend, we conduct an analysis on the
edit history of 1120 Wikipedia articles from the Computer Science category and observe that till Jan,
2017 on average around 65% edits are in the text content, 32% are wikilink edits and strikingly only 1%
are reference edits. Rest correspond to table, template and category edits etc. We present some example
Wikipedia articles along with the statistic of their edit history in Table 1. Clearly, all these observations
point to the requirement of an automated reference recommendation system to keep the reference section
of a scientific Wikipedia article up-to-date.

analysis of edit history.

What we envisage? Motivated by the fact that wikilink edits are less hard and more frequent compared
to reference edits, a natural question that arises is that whether it is possible to develop an automatic
procedure to add a set of references whenever there is a wikilink edit on a target page. In this paper,
we investigate the possibility of enriching the reference section of a scientific Wikipedia article using
the wikilinks present in the article as a surrogate. In particular, we introduce the novel idea of reference
inheritance from the source pages pointed to by the wikilinks present on the target page to populate the
reference section of the target page with relevant references.

For this study, we consider 3842 target Wikipedia pages (till June, 2017) from the Computer Sci-
ence domain. In order to show that our method is quite generic, we also consider an additional dataset
comprising 2871 target Wikipedia pages (till February, 2018) from the Physics domain.

We propose a novel two step approach as follows. In the first step, we determine the potential wikilinks
from which references could be inherited. In the second step, we recommend the most relevant references
from the potential wikilinks obtained in the first step.
Key contributions: In summary, we make the following contributions:
a) Novel problem formulation: We formulate and address the problem of automatically populating the
reference section by inheriting the references from the wikilinks present in a target scientific Wikipedia
article.
b) The two step approach: We propose a two-step reference recommendation system and show its advan-
tage over simple baselines that do not implement the first step of potential wikilink selection from which

references could be inherited.
c) Evaluation: We perform extensive experiments to evaluate our system. We evaluate in two different
ways - first, by comparing our recommendations with the references already present on the target page
(acting as a ground-truth) and second, through human judgement where experts are tasked to judge the
appropriateness of the recommended references. For the automatic evaluation we obtain a precision@1
of 0.44 for the Computer Science dataset compared to 0.38 obtained for the most competitive baseline.
For the Physics dataset we obtain a similar performance boost of 10% over the best baseline. Human
judgement experiments show that the average Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (ρ) between the
ranked list returned by WikiRef and the one produced by averaging the responses of the annotators is
0.203 compared to 0.168 obtained for the most competitive baseline6.

2 Problem formulation

Let us assume that we have a scientific Wikipedia article A (i.e., target) whose reference section we wish
to populate using a set of relevant references. As an input we use only the text content and wikilinks
present inA. Suppose,A has a set of nwikilinksB1, B2, . . . , Bn which in this case simply correspond to
the nWikipedia source articles from whichA could possibly inherit the references. We assume that while
the reference sections of the individual source pages themselves may not be “well populated”, together
the reference sections of all the source articles may provide a potential set of references, relevant to A.
We divide this task in two major steps. First, we obtain the wikilinks (i.e., a set ofBs) that are appropriate
for inheriting references from. We pose this as a binary classification problem thus dividing the set ofBs
in those that are relevant (appropriate for inheriting references) vs those that are not. Second, we prepare
a ranked list of k references taken from each of the correctly classified (i.e., relevant) wikilinks which
could be added to the reference section of A. We pose this second step as a “learning-to-rank” problem
and use various features to prepare the final list of recommendations.

3 Dataset

We use datasets from two different domains – Computer Science (CS) and Physics (PH) – to evaluate
our system. Note that while CS is our primary focus (owing to the background of the authors) we use the
PH dataset to show that our method is quite generic.
CS dataset: In order to prepare the CS dataset we crawl a set of 3842 target Wikipedia pages till June,
2017. The topics we span in this crawl are information retrieval, machine learning, automata theory,
graph theory etc. In addition, we also crawl all the source pages corresponding to all the wikilinks
present in the 3,842 target articles. The total number of wikipages thus crawled is 121,154.
PH dataset: For the PH dataset we crawl a total of 2,871 target articles spanning topics like gravitation,
mechanics, motion etc. The source pages pointed to by the wikilinks present on these target articles
together make the total crawl size of 107,332 pages.

4 Building WikiRef

Recall, that our approach works in two steps. We present the details of each of these steps below which
together refers to our system – WikiRef.

4.1 Classification of wikilinks (Step - I)

As discussed in Section 2, we have a target Wikipedia articleAwith nwiklinks (B1, B2, . . . , Bn) present
in it. Our goal in this step is to ascertain how appropriate a source page pointed to by a wikilink Bi is
for inheriting references. To estimate this, we measure the extent of similarity between A and the page
pointed to by Bi. The hypothesis is that the higher this similarity, the more relevant is the source page to
A and thus higher is the propensity of reference inheritance. We define various notions of similarity that
act as features to a binary classifier which classifies if the source is relevant or not.

6We perform the human judgement experiment only for the CS domain because of the background of the contributing
authors of this paper.



383

• Tf-idf similarity of article summaries (TIS): We represent the summaries (first paragraphs) of A
and the source page pointed to byBi as tf-idf vectors and compute the cosine similarity between them.
Note that, inverse document frequency (idf) is calculated only from the dataset we have prepared.

• Outlinks similarity (OS): Outlinks of a Wikipedia article (say A) is the set of Wikipedia articles that
A hyperlinks to. We compute outlinks similarity as the Jaccard overlap between the outlinks of A and
the source page pointed to by Bi.

• Inlinks similarity (IS): Inlinks of a Wikipedia article (say A) is the set of Wikipedia articles that
hyperlink to the page A. We compute inlinks similarity as the Jaccard overlap between the inlinks
of A and the source page pointed to by Bi. Note that, for computing inlinks we consider the articles
present only in our dataset.

• Out sentence similarity (OSS): Here we consider the common outlinks of A and the source page
pointed to by Bi. We collate all the sentences in A where these common outlinks occur, to prepare a
document OSA. Similarly, we collate all sentences in the page pointed to by Bi where these common
outlinks occur to form a document OSBi . Now we represent OSA and OSBi as tf-idf vectors and
compute cosine similarity between them.

• In sentence similarity (ISS): This is same as OSS with the exception that here we construct the
documents based on the sentences where the common inlinks of A and the page pointed to by Bi
occur.

Additional deep neural representations: Apart from these five similarity measures we use additional
variants of TIS, OSS and ISS where instead of representing a text document as a tf-idf vector we represent
it as a document vector obtained using an encoder based on a bi-directional LSTM architecture with max
pooling, trained on the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset (Bowman et al., 2015) as
proposed by Conneau et al. (2017). Note that, for applying this architecture we use the GloVe vectors
trained on Common Crawl data (840B tokens)7as seeds for representing words in a document. We
name these variants of TIS, OSS and ISS respectively as vector similarity of article summaries (VS),
out-sentence vector similarity (OSVS) and in-sentence vector similarity (ISVS) respectively.

We plug in all these features in classifiers like SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression etc. We
observe that Random Forest performs the best among these and therefore report the results for this
classifier only. This step automatically identifies the wikilinks that are potential candidates for reference
inheritance.

4.2 Recommending the exact list of references (Step - II)

As an outcome of the previous step, we have a target Wikipedia article A and a wikilink Bi which is
classified as either relevant for reference inheritance or not. Let us assume that for a Bi that is classified
as relevant in the first step, the source page pointed to by Bi has m references R1, R2, ..., Rm. However,
all of these m references might not be appropriate to inherit. Therefore, the task here is to produce a
ranked list of k references which A can inherit depending on the relevance of the reference with respect
to the content of A. In order to estimate the relevance of a reference (say Rj) we propose the following
features.
• Similarity between the citation context of the reference Rj in the source page pointed to by Bi

and the citation context of Bi in A: Citation context represents the sentence in which a reference
or wikilink gets cited. We represent the citation contexts as simple tf-idf vectors and compute the
cosine similarity between the tf-idf vectors of the citation context of Rj in the source page pointed
to by Bi and the citation context of Bi in A. We term this feature as F1-TI. We also represent
citation contexts as sentence vectors using the bi-LSTM architecture proposed by Conneau et al. (2017)
(already discussed earlier) and compute the cosine similarity of these vector representations of the
citation contexts of Rj in the source page pointed to by Bi and the citation context of Bi in A. We call
this feature F1-Vec.

• Similarity between the title of the reference Rj in the source page pointed to by Bi and the
citation context of Bi in A: As the title of any reference contains the most important clue about the
7https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/

https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/


384

reference itself, we represent the title of the reference Rj in the source page pointed to by Bi and
citation context of Bi in A as tf-idf vectors and compute the cosine similarity between them. We call
this feature F2-TI8.
We use – SVMRank (Joachims, 2006) – a standard learning-to-rank framework and plug in the above

three features to obtain a ranked list of k references to recommend. We report the performance our
approach for different values of k in Section 5.

5 Evaluation

We first individually evaluate Step - I and Step - II and subsequently report the performance of WikiRef
as a whole. We evaluate the performance using the standard precision-recall metrics and compare it with
various baseline approaches that we ourselves propose since there is no known work in the literature that
could serve as a suitable baseline for this task.

5.1 Gold standard dataset

As discussed in section 3 we have a total of 3,842 target Wikipedia pages from the Computer Science
(CS) domain and 2,871 target Wikipedia pages from the Physics (PH) domain for which we aim to come
up with a list of references. We consider the existing references in the target pages (i.e., the A pages) at
the time-point of crawling as the gold standard references to be evaluated against.

5.2 Baselines

There have been several reference recommendation systems (Huang et al., 2015; Caragea et al., 2013;
Huang et al., 2014; Tang et al., 2014; Ren et al., 2014; Meng et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2012) for scientific
articles but all of them either use the the text of the cited paper or the underlying citation network which
makes these systems inappropriate to be used as baselines to compare with WikiRef. Therefore, we
propose some standard baselines to ascertain the importance of each step in our approach.
Baseline I: Here, Step - I of our approach is skipped and we assume that all the wikilinks present in the
target Wikipedia article are relevant for reference inheritance. In Step - II we rank the references of each
wikilink only on the basis of tf-idf similarity between references’ citation context in the page pointed to
by the wikilink and the wikilink’s citation context in target Wikipedia article.
Baseline II: Here again, Step - I of our approach is skipped and we assume that all the wikilinks present
in the target Wikipedia article are relevant for reference inheritance. In Step - II we rank the references of
each wikilink only on the basis of tf-idf similarity between the references’ title and the wikilink’s citation
context in the target Wikipedia article.
Baseline III: Step - I is fully retained. In Step - II we rank the references of each wikilink only on the
basis of tf-idf similarity between references’ citation context in wikilink’s content and wikilink’s citation
context in target Wikipedia article (F1-TI).
Baseline IV: Step - I is fully retained. In Step - II we rank the references of each wikilink only on the
basis of tf-idf similarity between references’ title and wikilink’s citation context in the target Wikipedia
article (F2-TI).
Baseline V: Step - I is fully retained. In Step - II we rank the references of each wikilink only on
the basis of cosine similarity between sentence vector representation of references’ citation context in
the page pointed to by the wikilink and the wikilink’s citation context in the target Wikipedia article
(F1-Vec).

We compare the performance of these baselines with WikiRef in section 5.5.

5.3 Performance analysis of Step - I

We use 70% of the Wikipedia pages for training and rest 30% of them for testing using the gold standard
dataset. However, we observe from the gold standard dataset that on average only 10% wikilinks are
suitable for reference inheritance while the rest 90% are irrelevant. To tackle this imbalance in the

8We do not use the corresponding deep vectors since the reference title are in many cases very small and do not produce
appropriate vectors thus negatively affecting the overall performance of our system.



385

dataset, we follow the under-sampling technique based on the repeated edited nearest neighbour method
proposed by Lemaı̂tre et al. (2017).

First, in order to understand the importance of the proposed features we perform a χ-square test for
the classification. We report the ranking of the features in Table 2. Subsequently, we plug the features
according to this rank from top to bottom one by one into the classifier; the performance obtained thereby
are presented in Table 3. We observe that appending the features one by one according to the χ-square
test ranking helps to improve the overall performance of the classifier except the last feature which causes
no improvements.

Some of the representative Wikipedia articles from the CS dataset along with the relevant/irrelevant
wikilinks for reference inheritance as correctly predicted by our classifier are noted in Table 4. We
observe that the relevant wikilinks are semantically more close to the target Wikipedia articles compared
to the irrelevant ones, thus making the former ones as more probable candidates for reference inheritance.

5.4 Performance analysis of Step - II

Table 5 reports the performance of our approach for various values of k. Considering the difficulty of the
task we observe that our system achieves very good performance in terms of precision even for higher
values of k. Some of the representative recommended references along with the target Wikipedia articles
are shown in Table 6. The correct references in the table signify the references which are actually present
in the target Wikipedia article’s reference section (i.e., in the gold standard dataset). We also observe
that the incorrect references which are actually not present in the target Wikipedia article’s reference
section are not adjudged as relevant by our system. As we cannot compare these references with the gold
standard, we perform manual evaluation for only these references in order to analyze how suitable these
references are for the target Wikipedia article (see Section 5.6).

5.5 WikiRef vs the baselines

The comparisons of the performances of different baselines with WikiRef are noted in Table 7. The table
shows that for all the values of k the performance of BL-III and BL-IV is significantly better than BL-I
and BL-II respectively leading to the fact that the role of Step - I is very crucial in this context and, in
particular, helps boost the performance of the full system. In addition, we observe that the performance
we get only using unsupervised ranking in step - II based on any one of the three features (used in BL-
III, BL-IV and BL-V respectively) described in section 4.2 cannot beat the performance of our approach
where we use a supervised approach like SVMRank that draws advantage of all the three features.

5.6 Manual evaluation

The aim of this manual evaluation is to understand the quality of the recommendations returned by
WikiRef for the cases which are not present in the gold standard dataset. In the survey, we provide
a total of 25 Wikipedia pages from the Computer Science (CS) dataset along with five recommended
references which are not already present in the gold standard and ask the annotators to choose the appro-
priate references which should be there in the reference section of the given Wikipedia article to make
it more resourceful. A sample evaluation page can be seen in this link9. The list of scientific Wikipedia
articles that we use for manual evaluation are noted in Table 8. 10 participants with Computer Science
background have taken part in this survey. First, we compute absolute performance of our system which
shows on an average, the fraction of references actually found to be relevant by the annotators. We
compute the performance score per Wikipage as the fraction of the proposed references found to be rel-
evant by the annotators (averaged over all the annotators). We then compute the average over the full
list of 25 Wikipages, obtaining a very good performance score of 0.63 leading to the fact that out of 5
recommended references, close to 3 references are found to be relevant by the annotators.

Next, we also attempt to correlate the ranking of the competing systems with the implicit ranking
imposed by the annotators. For each Wikipedia article, we rank the five references depending on the
number of participants voting for a particular reference, using standard fractional ranking method. Then
we compute the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (ρ) between these ranks and the ranked list
returned by WikiRef as well as other baselines. Table 9 shows that WikiRef beats the most competitive
baseline by a significant margin.

5.7 Performance analysis for the Physics (PH) dataset

So far, we have reported all the performance figures for the Computer science (CS) dataset. In order to
investigate the applicability of our system in other domains, we repeat the experiments on the Physics
(PH) dataset as well. The results for both step - I and step - II are noted in Table 10. We use the same
eight features (TIS, OSS, ISS, OS, OSVS, VS, ISVS, IS) with Random Forest classifier for step - I and
for step - II we again choose the same SVMRank framework fed in with the three features (F1-TI, F1-Vec
and F2-TI) as discussed earlier. From Table 11 we observe that for almost all the cases WikiRef performs
better than the baselines.

6 Conclusion

This paper presented a novel two-step recommendation system for enhancing the reference section of the
Wikipedia entity pages, dealing with scientific concepts by inheriting the references from the wikilinks
present in the page itself. In the first stage we obtain relevant wikilinks for an entity page via a supervised



388

classification approach. In the second stage we recommend a ranked list of references from the relevant
wikilinks obtained from the first stage. WikiRef achieves an overall precision@1 of 0.44 for the CS
dataset and 0.45 for the PH dataset. These are very significant improvements over the most competing
baselines in both cases. In addition, manual evaluations over 25 wikipages show that WikiRef also
recommends the most relevant references that are absent in the gold standard dataset. We have made our
code and data publicly available10.

Immediate future work would be to focus on further evaluations on various datasets including biology
and medicine. Also, the proposed approach can be adapted to filter any type of entity pages’ reference
section. We further plan to prepare an online tool that triggers WikiRef to recommend references as soon
as relvant wikilinks are added to a target Wikipedia article.
