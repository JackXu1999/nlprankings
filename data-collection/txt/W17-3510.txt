Abstract 

This talk will present a few NLG systems developed within Thomson Reuters providing information to 

professionals such as lawyers, accountants or traders. Based on the experience developing these system, I 

will discuss the usefulness of automatic metrics, crowd-sourced evaluation, corpora studies and expert 

reviews. I will conclude with exploring the question of whether developers of NLG systems need to follow 

ethical guidelines and how those guidelines could be established.
