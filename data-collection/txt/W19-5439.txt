Abstract

The filtering task of noisy parallel corpora in
WMT2019 aims to challenge participants to
create filtering methods to be useful for train-
ing machine translation systems. In this work,
we introduce a noisy parallel corpora filter-
ing system based on generating hypotheses by
means of a translation model. We train trans-
lation models in both language pairs: Nepali–
English and Sinhala–English using provided
parallel corpora. To create the best possible
translation model, we first join all provided
parallel corpora (Nepali, Sinhala and Hindi to
English) and after that, we applied bilingual
cross-entropy selection for both language pairs
(Nepali–English and Sinhala–English). Once
the translation models are trained, we trans-
late the noisy corpora and generate a hypoth-
esis for each sentence pair. We compute the
smoothed BLEU score between the target sen-
tence and generated hypothesis. In addition,
we apply several rules to discard very noisy
or inadequate sentences which can lower the
translation score. These heuristics are based
on sentence length, source and target similar-
ity and source language detection. We com-
pare our results with the baseline published on
the shared task website, which uses the Zip-
porah model, over which we achieve signifi-
cant improvements in one of the conditions in
the shared task. The designed filtering system
is domain independent and all experiments are
conducted using neural machine translation.

1 Introduction

A large amount of parallel corpora can be ex-
tracted using web-crawling. This technique of
data acquisition is very useful to increase the train-
ing set for low-resourced languages. Unfortu-
nately, the extracted data can include noisy sen-
tence pairs, such as unaligned sentences, partially
translated pairs, or sentences containing different
languages than those intended. For these reasons

the creation of systems for filtering of noisy paral-
lel corpora are needed.
In this paper, we introduce a filtering method for
noisy parallel corpora based mainly on generating
hypotheses for each sentence pair from noisy data
and scoring based on hypothesis and target sen-
tence similarity. This technique consists of build-
ing the best possible translation engine for each
language pair and generating a translation hypoth-
esis for each sentence of the noisy data. Once the
hypotheses are generated, we compute the BLEU
(Papineni et al., 2002), smoothed by adding one
to both numerator and denominator from (Lin and
Och, 2004), between each target and hypothesis.
To create a translation engine, which will be used
for generating hypothesis for each sentence from
noisy corpus, we select sentence pairs using bilin-
gual cross-entropy selection (Axelrod et al., 2011)
from all parallel corpora provided (Nepali, Sin-
hala, Hindi to English) jointly. To apply bilingual
cross-entropy, we first train language models using
the provided monolingual corpora in Nepali, Sin-
hala and English. In addition, we use some rules
to discard useless sentences by filtering according
to sentence length, Nepali and Sinhala characters
detection, and BLEU scoring between source and
target sentences. The last rule is used to discard
highly similar sentence pairs.
The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 de-
scribes the shared task, the provided data, the sub-
sampling process and the evaluation system. In
Section 3 we describe the developed method for
filtering noisy data. We describe the experiments
conducted and the results. Conclusions and future
work are drawn in Section 4.

2 WMT 2019 shared task on parallel
corpus filtering for low-resource
conditions

The task “Parallel Corpus Filtering for Low-
Resource Conditions”1 tackles the problem of
cleaning noisy parallel corpora for low-resourced
language pairs. Given a noisy parallel corpus, par-
ticipants are required to develop methods to fil-
ter it down to a smaller size with a high qual-
ity subset. This year there are two language
pairs: Nepali–English and Sinhala–English. Par-
ticipants are asked to provide score files for each
sentence in each of the noisy parallel sets. The
scores will be used to subsample sentence pairs
into two different training set sizes: 1 million
and 5 million English words. For this task, very
noisy corpora of 40.6 million English words in
Nepali–English and 59.6 million English words
in Sinhala–English are provided. The data were
crawled from the web as part of the Paracrawl
project2. The quality of the resulting subsets is
determined by the quality of a statistical machine
translation (SMT) and neural machine translation
(NMT) systems trained on this data. The qual-
ity of the machine translation system is measured
with the sacreBLEU score (Post, 2018) on a held-
out test set of Wikipedia translations for Nepali-
English (ne–en) and Sinhala-English (si–en). The
organisers provide development and test sets for
each pair of languages but due to the fact that the
task addresses the challenge of data quality and
not domain-relatedness of the data for a particular
use case, the test sets may be very different from
the final official test set in terms of topics.

2.1 Data provided

Organisers provide noisy corpora for the Nepali–
English and Sinhala–English language pairs. The
main figures of both corpora are shown in Table 1.

In addition, organisers provide links to the
permissible third-party sources of bilingual data
to be used in the competition. Parallel cor-
pora for the Nepali–English language pair comes
from the Bible, Global Voices, Penn Tree Bank,
GNOME/KDE/Ubuntu and Nepali Dictionary cor-
pora. For the Sinhala–English language pair, the
Open Subtitles and GNOME/KDE/Ubuntu paral-
lel corpora are provided. The main figures of the

2.2 Sub-sampling of noisy data
Participants submit files with numerical scores,
giving one score per line for the original unfiltered
parallel corpus. A tool provided by the organisers
takes as input the scores and the noisy parallel cor-
pus. The tool then selects sentences with higher
scores to complete the desired 1M and 5M words
in target. Systems trained on these data sets are
used for evaluation by the organisers.

2.3 Translation evaluation
As specified in the shared task, the evaluation of
a selected subset of sentences is done using SMT
and NMT. The SMT system is implemented using
Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) and the NMT system is
built using the FAIRseq (Ott et al., 2019) toolkit.
Organisers provided scripts which allow for im-
plementing the same translation system which will
be used in the final evaluation. However, we only
conducted experiments using NMT. The FAIRseq
system tokenises source and target sentences and
applies BPE (Sennrich et al., 2016). The tokeni-
sation of Nepali, Sinhala and Hindi sentences is
done using the Indic NLP Library3. The system
(Guzmán et al., 2019) uses a Transformer archi-
tecture with 5 encoder and 5 decoder layers, where
the number of attention heads, embedding dimen-
sion and inner-layer dimension are 2, 512 and
2048, respectively. The model is regularised with
dropout, label smoothing and weight decay. The
model is optimised with Adam (Kingma and Ba,
2014) using β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98, and � = 1e− 8.
The learning rate is fixed to lr = 1e3, as described
in (Ott et al., 2019). The NMT system from the
shared task is trained for 100 epochs and mod-
els are saved every 10 epochs. The best model
is chosen according to validation set loss function
value. The script which allowed us to reproduce
the network used in the shared task can be found
at https://github.com/facebookresearch/flores. All
experiments were performed using NVidia Titan
Xp GPUs.

3 System description

In this section, the entire process of sentence scor-
ing is detailed.

Our process for scoring noisy corpora is as fol-
lows:

1. We apply bilingual cross-entropy selection
(described in 3.1.1) to select the best set of
sentences from Nepali, Sinhala and Hindi
to English jointly for each language pair:
Nepali–English and Sinhala–English.

2. We train an NMT engine using the above se-
lected data for each language pair.

3. Once the NMT engine is trained, we generate
a hypothesis for each sentence in the noisy
corpus.

4. We then compute smoothed BLEU for each
target sentence in the noisy corpus, along
with its corresponding hypothesis. These
computed BLEU scores will be used for the
selection of the required subsets of 1M and
5M words of English tokens for the final eval-
uation.

5. Additionally, we apply a few rules (described
in 3.3) to discard some sentences which
are considered useless, by replacing their
smoothed BLEU score to zero, effectively
avoiding that the selection algorithm includes
such sentences into the selected subsets.

3.1 Translation engine
The main core of the scoring process is hypothesis
generation using a well-trained translation model.
To create the translation model we used the NMT
system from the shared task and we selected sen-
tences from all provided bilingual corpora in all
three language pairs jointly: Nepali, Sinhala and
Hindi to English. To select the subset of sentences
to train the translation model we used the bilin-
gual cross-entropy selection method (Moore and
Lewis, 2010) described in the next subsection.

3.1.1 Bilingual Cross-Entropy selection
We ranked sentences from all bilingual corpora
by their perplexity score according to a language
model trained on the monolingual corpora in
Nepali, Sinhala and English. The perplexity ppl
of a string s with empirical ngram distribution p
given a language model q is:

ppl(s) = 2−
∑

x∈s p(x)log q(x) = 2H(p,q) (1)

where H(p, q) is the cross-entropy between p and
q. Selecting the sentences with the lowest per-
plexity is therefore equivalent to choosing the sen-
tences with the lowest cross-entropy according to
the language model trained on monolingual data.
To compute bilingual cross-entropy score X (s) of
a sentence s, we sum the cross-entropy difference
over each side of the corpus, both source and tar-
get:

X (s) = [HM−src(s)−HN−src(s)]+
[HM−tgt(s)−HN−tgt(s)]

(2)

where HM−src(s) and HM−trg(s) are the cross-
entropy of a source/target sentence, respectively,
according to a language model trained on the

monolingual data provided, and HN−src(s) and
HN−trg(s) are the cross-entropy of a source/target
sentence, respectively, according to a language
model trained on the noisy corpora. Lower scores
are presumed to be better.

3.2 Filtering by hypothesis

Here, the purpose is to filter the noisy data accord-
ing to the potential smoothed BLEU score of the
sentence pair and the generated hypothesis. With
the purpose of building a translation system for ob-
taining this probability, we trained an NMT sys-
tem with different training set sizes selected us-
ing the bilingual cross-entropy technique above.
The system was trained for 200 epochs, which was
enough to achieve convergence. As development
set, and for selecting the best model for comput-
ing the BLEU score of the hypothesis associated
to a sentence pair, we used the same development
set as provided in the shared task. We selected the
best epoch according to validation set loss func-
tion value. In Table 6 we show sacreBLEU scores
for models trained with different number of sen-
tences.

gual cross-entropy selection results depending on the

lected, we translated the noisy corpora and we ob-
tained the hypothesis for each sentence, which al-
lowed us to compute the corresponding smoothed
BLEU score. This is the final score provided as
competition result. However, and before providing
the score, we also applied other filtering strategies,
as described in the following subsections.

3.3 Rule based Filtering

After obtaining the hypothesis for each sentence
from the noisy corpora, we applied a few rules to
filter the sentence pairs. These rules are the fol-
lowing:

1. Remove sentence pairs where the source or
target sentence contains more than 250 BPE
segments.

2. Remove sentences where the lower-cased
source sentence is equal to the lower-cased
target sentence.

3. Remove sentence pairs which do not contain
any Nepali/Sinhala characters in the source
sentence.

4. Remove sentences where the smoothed
BLEU score between the source and the tar-
get sentence is higher than a fixed thresh-
old µ. We explored different values for this
threshold µ = {0.20, 0.25, 0.30, 0.35, 1.0}.
Note that the space between 0.35 and 1.0 was
not explored because values of µ only slightly
above 0.35 already implied that no sentences
were filtered.

The order in which the rules are applied is impor-
tant, since sentences that are filtered out with zero
score assigned by one rule will not be a candidate
for selection in subsequent rules. After applying
different threshold values we used the provided
script to subsample sentence pairs to amount to 1
million and 5 million English words. The results
of training the final NMT system by applying dif-
ferent thresholds µ are shown in Tables 7 and 8.

Finally, we selected thresholds µ = 0.35 for the
Nepali–English corpus, and µ = 1.00 (no thresh-
old, all BLEU values between source and target
sentences accepted) for the Sinhala–English lan-
guage pair. In Table 9, the number of removed
sentences by each rule are shown.

In total, we discarded 1.2M from Nepali noisy
corpus and 1.9M sentences from Sinhala noisy

pus were scored using target-hypothesis smoothed
BLEU described previously.

3.4 Baseline comparision

Once we selected the best models, we compared
the obtained sacreBLEU scores with the Zipporah
model results published on wmt2019 website. The
Zipporah model extracts a bag-of-words transla-
tion feature, and trains logistic regression models
to classify good data and synthetic noisy data in
the proposed feature space. The trained model is
used to score parallel sentences in the data pool
for selection. In Table 10 we show our result com-
pared to the Zipporah model.

4 Conclusions and future work

We introduced filtering of noisy parallel corpora
based on hypothesis generation and combined this
filtering with several filtering rules. We submitted
only the best set of scores for each language pair
to the shared task. In both language pairs, Nepali–
English and Sinhala–English, we achieved results
that performed better than the Zipporah baseline
with corpora containing 5M English words. Our
conclusion is that the designed filtering method is
able to reach better performance when confronted

with larger amounts of data.
Future work should concentrate on further im-

proving of our filtering method. We would train
a logistic model to combine the BLEU score be-
tween the generated hypothesis and target with
the BLEU score between source and target in-
stead of threshold values. Also, we would ap-
ply data selection techniques such as infrequent
n-gram selection (Parcheta et al., 2018) or con-
tinuous vector-space representation of sentences
(Chinea-Rios et al., 2019).
