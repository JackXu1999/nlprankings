Abstract

We describe our approach for the
SemEval-2014 task 9: Sentiment Analy-
sis in Twitter. We make use of an en-
semble learning method for sentiment
classification of tweets that relies on
varied features such as feature hash-
ing, part-of-speech, and lexical fea-
tures. Our system was evaluated in
the Twitter message-level task.

1 Introduction

The sentiment analysis is a field of study that
investigates feelings present in texts. This
field of study has become important, espe-
cially due to the internet growth, the content
generated by its users, and the emergence of
the social networks. In the social networks
such as Twitter people post their opinions in a
colloquial and compact language, and it is be-
coming a large dataset, which can be used as
a source of information for various automatic
tools of sentiment inference. There is an enor-
mous interest in sentiment analysis of Twit-
ter messages, known as tweets, with applica-
tions in several segments, such as (i) directing
marketing campaigns, extracting consumer re-
views of services and products (Jansen et al.,
2009); (ii) identifying manifestations of bully-
ing (Xu et al., 2012); (iii) predicting to fore-
cast box-office revenues for movies (Asur and
Huberman, 2010); and (iv) predicting accep-
tance or rejection of presidential candidates
(Diakopoulos and Shamma, 2010; O’Connor
et al., 2010).

One of the problems encountered by re-
searchers in tweet sentiment analysis is the
scarcity of public datasets. Although Twit-
ter sentiment datasets have already been cre-
ated, they are either small — such as Obama-
McCain Debate corpus (Shamma et al., 2009)
and Health Care Reform corpus (Speriosu et
al., 2011) or big and proprietary such as in
(Lin and Kolcz, 2012). Others rely on noisy
labels obtained from emoticons and hashtags
(Go et al., 2009). The SemEval-2014 task 9: Sen-
timent Analysis in Twitter (Nakov et al., 2013)
provides a public dataset to be used to com-
pare the accuracy of different approaches.

In this paper, we propose to analyse tweet
sentiment with the use of Adaptive Boost-
ing (Freund and Schapire, 1997), making
use of the well-known Multinomial Classi-
fier. Boosting is an approach to machine
learning that is based on the idea of creat-
ing a highly accurate prediction rule by com-
bining many relatively weak and inaccurate
rules. The AdaBoost algorithm (Freund and
Schapire, 1997) was the first practical boost-
ing algorithm, and remains one of the most
widely used and studied, with applications in
numerous fields. Therefore, it has potential to
be very useful for tweet sentiment analysis, as
we address in this paper.

2 Related Work

Classifier ensembles for tweet sentiment anal-
ysis have been underexplored in the literature
— a few exceptions are (Lin and Kolcz, 2012;
Clark and Wicentwoski, 2013; Rodriguez et
al., 2013; Hassan et al., 2013).

Lin and Kolcz (2012) used logistic regres-
sion classifiers learned from hashed byte 4-
grams as features – The feature extractor con-
siders the tweet as a raw byte array. It moves
a four-byte sliding window along the array,

123



and hashes the contents of the bytes, the value
of which was taken as the feature id. Here the
4-grams refers to four characters (and not to
four words). They made no attempt to per-
form any linguistic processing, not even word
tokenization. For each of the (proprietary)
datasets, they experimented with ensembles
of different sizes. The ensembles were formed
by different models, obtained from different
training sets, but with the same learning algo-
rithm (logistic regression). Their results show
that the ensembles lead to more accurate clas-
sifiers.

Rodrı́gues et al. (2013) and Clark et al.
(2013) proposed the use of classifier ensem-
bles at the expression-level, which is related
to Contextual Polarity Disambiguation. In this
perspective, the sentiment label (positive,
negative, or neutral) is applied to a specific
phrase or word within the tweet and does not
necessarily match the sentiment of the entire
tweet.

Finally, another type of ensemble frame-
work has been recently proposed by Hassan
et al. (2013), who deal with class imbalance,
sparsity, and representational issues. The au-
thors propose to enrich the corpus using mul-
tiple additional datasets related to the task of
sentiment classification. Differently from pre-
vious works, the authors use a combination of
unigrams and bigrams of simple words, part-
of-speech, and semantic features.

None of the previous works used AdaBoost
(Freund and Schapire, 1996). Also, lexicons
and/or part-of-speech in combination with
feature hashing, like in (Lin and Kolcz, 2012)
have not been addressed in the literature.

3 AdaBoost Ensemble

Boosting is a relatively young, yet extremely
powerful, machine learning technique. The
main idea behind boosting algorithms is to
combine multiple weak learners – classifi-
cation algorithms that perform only slightly
better than random guessing – into a power-
ful composite classifier. Our focus is on the
well known AdaBoost algorithm (Freund and
Schapire, 1997) based on Multinomial Naive
Bayes as base classifiers (Figure 1).

AdaBoost and its variants have been ap-
plied to diverse domains with great success,

owing to their solid theoretical foundation,
accurate prediction, and great simplicity (Fre-
und and Schapire, 1997). For example, Viola
and Jones (2001) used AdaBoost to face de-
tection, Hao and Luo (2006) dealt with im-
age segmentation, recognition of handwritten
digits, and outdoor scene classification prob-
lems. In (Bloehdorn and Hotho, 2004) text
classification is explored.

4 Feature Engineering

The most commonly used text representation
method adopted in the literature is known as
Bag of Words (BOW) technique, where a doc-
ument is considered as a BOW, and is repre-
sented by a feature vector containing all the
words appearing in the corpus. In spite of
BOW being simple and very effective in text
classification, a large amount of information
from the original document is not considered,
word order is ruptured, and syntactic struc-
tures are broken. Therefore, sophisticated fea-
ture extraction methods with a deeper under-
standing of the documents are required for
sentiment classification tasks. Instead of us-
ing only BOW, alternative ways to represent
text, including Part of Speech (PoS) based fea-
tures, feature hashing, and lexicons have been
addressed in the literature.

We implemented an ensemble of classifiers
that receive as input data a combination of
three features sets: i) lexicon features that cap-
tures the semantic aspect of a tweet; ii) fea-
ture hashing that captures the surface-form as
abbreviations, slang terms from this type of
social network, elongated words (for exam-
ple, loveeeee), sentences with words without
a space between them (for instance, Ilovveap-
ple!), and so on; iii) and a specific syntactic fea-
tures for tweets. Technical details of each fea-
ture set are provided in the sequel.

Lexicon Features

We use the sentimental lexicon provided by
(Thelwall et al., 2010) and (Hu and Liu, 2004).
The former is known as SentiStrength and

124



provides: an emotion vocabulary, an emoti-
cons list (with positive, negative, and neutral
icons), a negation list, and a booster word list.
We use the negative list in cases where the
next term in a sentence is an opinion word
(either positive or negative). In such cases
we have polarity inversion. For example, in
the sentence “The house is not beautiful”, the
negative word “not” invert the polarity of the
opinion word beautiful. The booster word list
is composed by adverbs that suggest more or
less emphasis in the sentiment. For exam-
ple, in the sentence “He was incredibly rude.”
the term “incredibly” is an adverb that lay em-
phasis on the opinion word “rude”. Besides
using SentiStrength, we use the lexicon ap-
proach proposed by (Hu and Liu, 2004). In
their approach, a list of words and associa-
tions with positive and negative sentiments
has been provided that are very useful for
sentiment analysis.

These two lexicons were used to build the
first feature set according to Table 1, where it
is presented an example of tweet representa-
tion for the tweet1: “The soccer team didn’t
play extremely bad last Wednesday.” The
word “bad” exists in the lexicon list of (Hu
and Liu, 2004), and it is a negative word.
The word “bad” also exists in the negation
list provided by (Thelwall et al., 2010). The
term “didn’t” is a negative word according to
SentiStrength (Thelwall et al., 2010) and there
is a polarity inversion of the opinion words
ahead. Finally, the term “extremely” belongs
the booster word list and this word suggests
more emphasis to the opinion words existing
ahead.

Feature hashing

Feature hashing has been introduced for text
classification in (Shi et al., 2009), (Wein-
berger et al., 2009), (Forman and Kirshen-
baum, 2008), (Langford et al., 2007), (Caragea
et al., 2011). In the context of tweet classi-
fication, feature hashing offers an approach
to reducing the number of features provided

as input to a learning algorithm. The origi-
nal high-dimensional space is “reduced” by
hashing the features into a lower-dimensional
space, i.e., mapping features to hash keys.
Thus, multiple features can be mapped to the
same hash key, thereby “aggregating” their
counts.

We used the MurmurHash3 function
(SMHasher, 2010), that is a non-cryptographic
hash function suitable for general hash-based
lookup tables. It has been used for many
purposes, and a recent approach that has
emerged is its use for feature hashing or
hashing trick. Instead of building and storing
an explicit traditional bag-of-words with
n-grams, the feature hashing uses a hash
function to reduce the dimensionality of the
output space and the length of this space
(features) is explicitly fixed in advance. For
this paper, we used this code (in Python):

Code Listing 1: Murmurhash:

from sklearn.utils.murmurhash
import murmurhash3_bytes_u32

for w in "i loveee apple".split():
print("{0} => {1}".format(

w,murmurhash3_bytes_u32(w,0)%2**10))

The dimensionality is 2 ∗ ∗10, i.e 210 fea-
tures. In this code the output is a hash code
for each word “w” in the phrase “i loveee
apple”, i.e. i => 43, loveee => 381 and
apple => 144. Table 2 shows an example of
feature hashing representation.

tweet2 0 1 0 3 · · · 0 negative

tweetn 0 0 2 1 · · · 0 neutral

Table 2: Representing Twitter messages with
feature hashing.

Specific syntactic (PoS) features

We used the Part of Speech (PoS) tagged for
tweets with the Twitter NLP tool (Gimpel et
al., 2011). It encompasses 25 tags including
Nominal, Nominal plus Verbal, Other open-
class words like adjectives, adverbs and in-
terjection, Twitter specific tags such as hash-
tags, mention, discourse marker, just to name

125



a few. Table 3 shows an example of syntactic
features representation.

tweet2 0 2 0 1 · · · 0 negative

Table 3: Representing Twitter messages with
syntactic features.

A combination of lexicons, feature hashing,
and part-of-speech is used to train the ensem-
ble classifiers, thereby resulting in 1024 fea-
tures from feature hashing, 3 features from
lexicons, and 25 features from PoS.

WEKA platform1. Table 4 shows the class dis-
tributions in training, development, and test-
ing sets. Table 5 presents the results for posi-
tive and negative classes with the classifiers

6 Concluding Remarks

From our results, we conclude that the use of
AdaBoost provides good performance in the
sentiment analysis (message-level subtask).
In the cross-validation process, Multinomial
Naive Bayes (MNB) has shown better results
than Support Vector Machines (SVM) as a
component for AdaBoost. However, we feel

Overall, the SemEval Tasks have make evi-
dent the usual challenges when mining opin-
ions from Social Media channels: noisy text,
irregular grammar and orthography, highly
specific lingo, and others. Moreover, tempo-
ral dependencies can affect the performance if
the training and test data have been gathered
at different.
