Abstract

We assume that unknown words with in-
ternal structure (afﬁxed words or com-
pounds) can provide speakers with linguis-
tic cues as for their meaning, and thus help
their decoding and understanding. To ver-
ify this hypothesis, we propose to work
with a set of French medical words. These
words are annotated by ﬁve annotators.
Then, two kinds of analysis are performed:
analysis of the evolution of understandable
and non-understandable words (globally
and according to some sufﬁxes) and anal-
ysis of clusters created with unsupervised
algorithms on basis of linguistic and extra-
linguistic features of the studied words.
Our results suggest that, according to lin-
guistic sensitivity of annotators, technical
words can be decoded and become under-
standable. As for the clusters, some of
them distinguish between understandable
and non-understandable words. Resources
built in this work will be made freely avail-
able for the research purposes.

Introduction

Often, people face unknown words, be they neol-
ogisms (like in Some of the best effects in my gar-
den have been the result of serendipity.) or techni-
cal words from specialized areas (like in Jacques
Chirac’s historic corruption trial, due to start on
Monday is on the verge of collapse, after doc-
tors diagnosed him with ”anosognosia”). In both
cases, their semantics may be opaque and their un-
derstanding not obvious.

Several linguistic operations are available for
enriching the lexicon, such as afﬁxation, com-
pounding and borrowings (Guilbert, 1971). We
are particularly interested in words with internal

structure, like anosognosia, because we assume
that linguistic regularities (components, afﬁxes,
and rules that form their structure) can help speak-
ers in deducing their structure and semantics. Our
hypothesis is that if regularities can be observed
at the level of linguistic features, they can also be
deduced and managed by speakers.
Indeed, lin-
guistic understanding is related to factors like:

• knowledge and recognition of components of
complex words: how to segment words, like
anosognosia, in components;

• morphological patterns and relations between
components: how to organize the compo-
nents and to construct the word semantics (Ia-
cobini, 2003; Amiot and Dal, 2008).

To verify our hypothesis, we propose to work
with a set of French medical words. These words
are considered out of context for several reasons:
1. when new words appear, they have little and
poor contexts, which cannot usually help
their understanding;

2. similarly, in specialized areas, the contexts,
except some deﬁnitional contexts, often bring
little help for the understanding of terms;

3. working with words out of context permits to
process a bigger set of words and to make ob-
servations with larger linguistic material;

4. from another point of view, analysis of words
in context corresponds to their perception in
extension relying on external clues, while
analysis of words out of context corresponds
to their perception in intension relying on
clues and features internal to these words.

For these reasons, we assume that internal struc-
ture of unknown words can help their understand-
ing. According to our hypothesis, afﬁxed words

33

and compounds, which are given internal struc-
ture, can provide the required linguistic clues.
Hence, the speakers may linguistically analyze un-
known words thanks to the exploitation of their
structure that they are able to detect.

Our interest for medical words is motivated by
an increasing presence of medical notions in our
daily life, while medicine still keeps a lot of mys-
teries unknown to lay persons because medical
knowledge is typically encoded with technical and
very specialized terms.

In what follows, we present some existing
works (section 2), the data which we propose to
process (section 3), and the experiments we pro-
pose to exploit (sections 4 to 6). We conclude with
some orientations for future work (section 7).

2 Existing work
We concentrate on work related to text difﬁculty
and understanding. Work on processing of words
unknown in dictionaries by automatic applica-
tions, although well studied, is not presented.

NLP provides a great variety of work and ap-
proaches dedicated to understanding and readabil-
ity of words and texts. The goal of readabil-
ity is to deﬁne whether texts are accessible for
readers or not. Readability measures are typi-
cally used for evaluation of document complex-
ity. Classical readability measures exploit infor-
mation on number of characters and syllables of
words (Flesch, 1948; Gunning, 1973), while com-
putational measures can involve vectorial models
and different features, among which combination
of classical measures with terminologies (Kokki-
nakis and Toporowska Gronostaj, 2006); n-grams
of characters (Poprat et al., 2006); stylistic (Grabar
et al., 2007) or discursive (Goeuriot et al., 2007)
features; lexicon (Miller et al., 2007); morpho-
logical information (Chmielik and Grabar, 2011);
and combination of various features (Wang, 2006;
Zeng-Treiler et al., 2007; Leroy et al., 2008;
Franc¸ois and Fairon, 2013; Gala et al., 2013).

In linguistics and psycholinguistics, the ques-

tion on understanding of lexicon may focus on:

• Knowledge of components of complex words
and their decomposition. The purpose is to
study how complex words (afﬁxed or com-
pounds) are processed and recorded. Several
factors may facilitate reading and production
of complex words: when these compounds
contain hyphens (Bertram et al., 2011) or

spaces (Frisson et al., 2008); when they are
presented with other morphologically related
words (L¨uttmann et al., 2011); and when
primes (Bozic et al., 2007; Beyersmann et al.,
2012), pictures (Dohmes et al., 2004; Koester
and Schiller, 2011) or favorable contexts
(Cain et al., 2009) are used;

• Order of components and variety of mor-
phological patterns. Position of components
(head or modiﬁer) proved to be important
for processing of complex words (Libben
et al., 2003; Holle et al., 2010; Feldman and
Soltano, 1999). The notions of semantic
transparency and of morphological headed-
ness have been isolated (Jarema et al., 1999;
Libben et al., 2003);

• Word length and types of afﬁxes (Meinzer

et al., 2009);

• Frequency of bases and components (Feld-

man et al., 2004).

Our hypothesis on emerging of linguistic rules in-
volved in word formation has also been addressed
in psycholinguistics, and it has to face two other
hypothesis on acquisition in context and on pro-
viding explicit information on semantics of com-
ponents (Baumann et al., 2003; Kuo and Ander-
son, 2006; McCutchen et al., 2014). Currently, the
importance of morphological structure for word
processing seems to be accepted by psycholin-
guists (Bowers and Kirby, 2010), which supports
our hypothesis. Yet, in our work, for verifying this
hypothesis, we exploit NLP methods and NLP-
generated features. Hence, we can work with large
linguistic data and exploit quantitative and unsu-
pervised methods.

3 Exploited data

The data processed are obtained from medical ter-
minology Snomed International (Cˆot´e, 1996) in
French, which purpose is to describe the medi-
cal area. This terminology contains 151,104 terms
structured in eleven semantic axes (e.g. disorders
and abnormalities, medical procedures, chemicals,
leaving organisms, anatomy). We keep terms from
ﬁve axes (disorders, abnormalities, medical pro-
cedures, functions and anatomy), which we con-
sider to be central and frequent. Hence, we do not
wish to concentrate on very specialized terms and

words, like chemicals or leaving organisms. Nev-
ertheless, such words can be part of terms stud-
ied here. The selected terms (104,649) are seg-
mented in words to obtain 29,641 unique words,
which are our working material. This set contains
compounds (abdominoplastie (abdominoplasty),
dermabrasion (dermabrasion)), constructed (car-
lipo¨ıde (lipoid)) and simple
diaque (cardiac),
(fragment) words, as well as abbreviations (AD-
Pase, ECoG, Fya) and borrowings (stripping,
Conidiobolus, stent, blind).

These terms are annotated by ﬁve French na-
tive speakers, aged from 25 to 60, without med-
ical training and with different social and profes-
sional status. Each annotator received a set with
randomly ordered 29,641 words. According to
the guidelines, the annotators should not use ad-
ditional information (dictionaries, encyclopedia,
etc.), should not change annotations done previ-
ously, should manage their time and efforts, and
assign each word in one of the three categories:
(1) I can understand, containing known words;
(2) I am not sure, containing hesitations; (3) I
cannot understand, containing unknown words.
We assume that our annotators represent moder-
ate readability level (Schonlau et al., 2011), i.e.
the annotators have a general language proﬁciency
but no speciﬁc knowledge in medical domain, and
that we will be able to generalize our observations
on the same population. Besides, we assume that

these annotations will allow to observe the pro-
gression in the understanding of technical words.
Manual annotation required from 3 weeks up
to 3 months.
The inter-annotator agreement
(Cohen, 1960) is over 0.730. Manual annota-
tion allows to distinguish several types of words
which are difﬁcult to understand: (1) abbrevia-
tions (e.g. , OG, VG, PAPS, j, bat, cp); (2) proper
names (e.g. , Gougerot, Sj¨ogren, Bentall, Glas-
gow, Babinski, Barthel, Cockcroft), which are of-
ten part of terms meaning disorders and proce-
dures; (3) medications; (4) several medical terms
meaning disorders, exams and procedures. These
are mainly compounds (e.g. antih´emophile (anti
haemophilus), scl´erodermie (sclerodermia), hy-
drolase (hydrolasis), tympanectomie (tympanecto-
mia), synesth´esie (synesthesia)); (5) borrowings;
(6) words related to human anatomy (e.g. cloa-
cal (cloacal), nasopharyng´e (nasopharyngal), mi-
tral (mitral), diaphragmatique (diaphragmatic),
inguinal (inguinal), ´eryth`eme (erythema), maxillo-
facial (maxillo-facial), m´esent´erique (mesenteric),
m´esent`ere (mesentry)).

4 Experiments

We propose two experiments:

1. Study of understanding progression of words
globally and according to some components
(section 5);

2. Unsupervised classiﬁcation of words, anal-
ysis of clusters and their comparison with
manual annotations (section 6).

5 Progression in word understanding
Progression of word understanding corresponds to
the rate of understandable and non-understandable
words at a given moment t for a given annotator.
This permits to observe whether the annotators can
become familiar with some components or mor-
phological rules, and improve their understanding
of words while the annotation is going on. This
analysis is done on the whole set of words and on
words with some components.

Figure 1 indicates the evolution of the three cat-
egories of words. The line corresponding to I can-
not understand is in the upper part of the graphs,
while the line I can understand is in the lower part.
The category I am not sure is always at the bottom.
We can distinguish the following tendencies:

• Annotators A2, A1 and especially A5 show
the tendency to decrease the proportion of un-
known words. We assume that they are be-
coming more familiar with some components
and bases, and that they can better manage
medical lexicon;

• Annotators A1, and in a lesser way A2 and
A4, show the tendency to decrease the num-
ber of hesitation (category 2).
Indeed, the
proportion of these words decreases, while
the proportion of words felt as known (cat-
egory 1) increases. Later, the number of
known words seems not to increase, except
for A5. Besides, this learning effect is es-
pecially observable with the top 2,000 words
and it mainly affects the transition of hesita-
tion words to known words;

• For annotators A3 and A4, after a small in-
crease of proportion of unknown words, this
proportion remains stable. We assume that
the annotation process of a large lexicon did
not allow to gain in understanding of compo-
nents of the processed technical words.

Figures 2 and 3 show the evolution of under-
standing of words ending with -ite (-itis) (mean-
ing inﬂammation) and -tomie (-tomy) (meaning re-
moval), respectively. We can see that A5 has dif-
ﬁculty to understand these words:
the percent-
age of unknown words is increasing, while on

the whole set of words (ﬁgure 1(e)) this annota-
tor shows the opposite tendency, with the percent-
age of unknown words decreasing. Annotators A2
and A4 also have understanding difﬁculties with
these words. Figures of other annotators suggest
that they make progress in decoding and under-
standing of words in -ite and -tomie. They ﬁrst
show an improvement in understanding of these
words, and later there is another small progres-
sion. On the basis of these observations, we can
see that, according to types of words, to their lin-
guistic features and to the sensitivity of annotators,
it it possible to make progressive improvement in
understanding of technical lexicon which a priori
is unknown by speakers. As already noticed, we
assume that linguistic regularities play an impor-
tant role in improving of the understanding of new
lexicon. We propose to observe now if such regu-
larities can also be detected by unsupervised clus-
tering algorithms.

6 Unsupervised classiﬁcation of words

Unsupervised classiﬁcation is performed with
several algorithms implemented in Weka: SOM
(Kohonen, 1989), Canopy (McCallum et al.,
2000), Cobweb (Fisher, 1987), EM (Dempster
et al., 1977), SimpleKMeans (Witten and Frank,
2005). Excepting SimpleKMeans and EM, it
is not necessary to indicate the expected number
of clusters. Each word is described with 23 lin-
guistic and extra-linguistic features, which can be
grouped in 8 classes (an excerpt is provided in Ta-
ble 1):

• POS-tags. POS-tags and lemmas are com-
puted by TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994) and
then checked by Flemm (Namer, 2000).
POS-tags are assigned to words within the
context of their terms.
If a given word re-
ceives more than one tag, the most frequent is
kept as feature. Among the main tags we ﬁnd
for instance nouns, adjectives, proper names,
verbs and abbreviations;

• Presence of words in reference lexica. We
exploit two French reference lexica: TLFi1
and lexique.org2. TLFi is a dictionary of the
French language covering XIX and XX cen-
turies, and contains almost 100,000 entries.

lexique.org has been created for psycholin-
guistic experiments. It contains over 135,000
entries, including inﬂectional forms. It con-
tains almost 35,000 lemmas. We assume that
words that are part of these lexica may be eas-
ier to understand;

• Frequency of words through a non special-
ized search engine. For each word, we query
the Google search engine in order to know
its frequency attested on the web. We assume
that words with higher frequency may be eas-
ier to understand;

• Frequency of words in medical terminology.
For the same reason as above, we compute
the frequency of words in the medical termi-
nology Snomed International;

• Number and types of semantic categories as-
sociated to words. We also exploit the infor-
mation on semantic axes of Snomed Interna-
tional and assume that words which occur in
several axes are more central;

• Length of words in number of characters and
syllables. For each word, we compute the
number of its characters and syllables, be-
cause we think that longer words may be
more difﬁcult to understand;

• Number of bases and afﬁxes. Each lemma
is analyzed by the morphological analyzer
D´erif
(Namer and Zweigenbaum, 2004),
adapted to the treatment of medical words.
It performs decomposition of lemmas into
bases and afﬁxes, and provides semantic ex-
planation of the analyzed lexemes. We ex-
ploit morphological decomposition, which
permits to compute the number of afﬁxes and
bases. Here again we focus on complexity of
the internal structure of words;

• Initial and ﬁnal substrings. We compute the
initial and ﬁnal substrings of different length,
from three to ﬁve characters. This allows
to isolate some components and possibly the
morphological head of words;

• Number and percentage of consonants, vow-
els and other characters. We compute the
number and the percentage of consonants,
vowels and other characters (i.e.
hyphen,
apostrophe, comas).

We perform experiments with three featuresets:
• Ec: the whole set with 23 features,
• Er: set with features reduced to linguistic
properties of words, such as POS-tag, num-
ber of syllables, initial and ﬁnal substrings,
which permits to take into account observa-
tions from psycholinguistics (Jarema et al.,
1999; Libben et al., 2003; Meinzer et al.,
2009),

• Ef : set with linguistic features and frequency
collected with the search engine, which per-
mits to consider other psycholinguistic obser-
vations (Feldman et al., 2004).

With SimpleKMeans and EM, we perform two
series of experiments, in which the number of
clusters is set to 1,000 and 2,000 (for almost
30,000 individuals to cluster). We expect to ﬁnd
linguistic regularities of words in clusters, accord-
ing to the features exploited. More speciﬁcally, we
want to observe whether the content of clusters is
related to the understanding of words.

Table 2: Generated clusters

In Table 2, we indicate the number of clusters
obtained with various sets of features: SOM gen-
erates very few clusters, which are big and het-
erogeneous. For instance, with Ef , clusters con-
tain up to 13,088, 4,840, 7,023 and 4,690 individ-
uals; Cobweb generates a lot of clusters among
which several singletons. For instance, with Ef ,
we obtain 9,374 clusters out of which 9,861 are
singletons; EM and SimpleKMeans generate the
required number of clusters, 1,000 and 2,000;
Canopy generates between 30 and 60 clusters,
according to the features used. We propose to
work with clusters obtained with Canopy because
it generates reasonnable number of clusters, which
number and contents are motivated by features.

With features from sets Er and Ef , cluster cre-
ation is mainly motivated by initial substrings (not
always equal to 3 to 5 ﬁrst or ﬁnal characters) and
in a lesser way by their POS-tags and frequen-
cies. For instance, we can obtain clusters with
words beginning by p or a, or clusters grouping

38

phosphats or enzymes ending with -ase.
In this
last case, clusters with chemicals become interest-
ing for our purpose, although globally the clusters
generated on basis of features from sets Er and
Ef show little interest. We propose to work with
clusters obtained with the Ec featureset.

With Canopy, the size of clusters varies be-
tween 1 and 2,823 individuals. Several clusters
are dedicated to two main annotation categories.
Hence, 30 clusters contain at least 80% of words
from the category 1 (I can understand), while 6
clusters contain at least 80% of words from the
category 3 (I cannot understand). Among the clus-
ters with understandable words, we can ﬁnd clus-
ters with:

• numerals (mil (thousand), quinzi`eme (ﬁf-
teen)), verbs (allaite (breast-feed),
´etend
(expand)), and adverbs (massivement (mas-
sively), probablement (probably)) grouped
according to their POS-tags and sometimes
to their ﬁnal substrings;

• grammatical words (du (of), aucun (any), les
(the)) grouped on basis of length and POS-
tags;

• common adjectives (rudimentaire (rudimen-
tary), prolong´e (extended), perm´eable (per-
meable), hyst´erique (hysterical), inad´equat
(inadequate), traumatique (traumatic), mil-
itaire (military)) grouped according to their
POS-tags and frequency;

• participial adjectives (inappropri´e (inappro-
priate), stratiﬁ´e (stratiﬁed), reli´e (related),
modiﬁ´e
(localised),
pr´ecis´e (precise), quadrupl´e (quadrupled))
grouped
their POS-tags,
frequencies and ﬁnal substrings;

(modiﬁed),

according

localis´e

to

• specialized but

frequent adjectives

(ro-
tulien (patellar), spasmodique (spasmodic),
putr´eﬁ´e (putrefactive),
(redun-
dant), tremblant (trembling), v´enal (venal),
synchrone (synchronous),
(sen-
sory)), also grouped according to their POS-
tags and frequencies;

redondant

sensoriel

• specialized frequent nouns (dentiste (dentist),
brosse (brush), altitude (altitude), glucose
(glucose), fourrure (fur), ankylose (ankylo-
sis), aversion (aversion), carcinome (carci-

noma)) grouped according to their POS-tags
and frequencies.

Among the clusters with non-understandable

words, we can ﬁnd:

• chemicals

(dihydroxyisoval´erate,

h´eparosane-N-sulfate-glucuronate,
d´esoxythymidine-monophosphate,
dim´ethylallyltransf´erase) grouped according
to their POS-tags, types of characters they
contain and their frequency;

• borrowings
(punctum, Saprolegnia, pig-
framboesia, equuli, rubidium,
mentosum,
dissimilis,
frutescens,
l´eontiasis, materia,
m´egarectum, diminutus, ghost, immitis, fol-
liclis, musculi) grouped according to their
POS-tags, ﬁnal substrings and frequency;

• proper names grouped according to their

POS-tags.

Within clusters with over 80% of words from
the category 3 (I cannot understand), we do not
observe understanding progression of annotators.
Yet, we have several mixed clusters, that contain
words from the two main categories (1 (I can un-
derstand) and 3 (I cannot understand)), as well as
hesitations. These clusters contain for instance:

(antitussive),

• chemicals and food (cr´eatinine (creatinine),
c´ephalosporine
antitussif
(cephalosporine),
(eggplant),
carotte (carrot), antid´epresseur (antidepres-
sant), dioxyde (dioxide)) grouped according
to their ﬁnal substrings, semantic axes and
frequency;

aubergine

• organism functions, disorders and medi-
cal procedures (parapar´esie (paraparesis),
n´evralgie (neuralgia), extrasystole (extrasys-
tole), my´eloblaste (myeloblast),
syncope
(syncope), psychose (psychosis), spasticit´e
(spasticity)) grouped according to their fre-
quency, ﬁnal substrings and POS-tags;

• more

related

adjectives

specialized

and disorders

to
(p´eriprostatique
anatomy
(periprostatic),
(tensor),
condylienne (condylar), ﬁbrosante (ﬁbrotic),
n´ecrosant (necrosis)) grouped according to
their POS-tags and frequency.

Evolution of understanding is observable mainly
within this last set of clusters. For instance, a
typical example is the cluster containing medical
procedures ending in -tomie, which words become
less frequently assigned to the category 3 (I cannot
understand) and more frequently to the categories
2 (I am not sure) and 1 (I can understand).

The content of clusters and our observations
suggest that, given an appropriate set of features
and unsupervised algorithms, it is possible to cre-
ate clusters which reﬂect the readability and un-
derstandability of lexicon by lay persons. Besides,
within some clusters, it is possible to observe the
evolution of annotators in their understanding of
technical words. For instance, this effect can typ-
ically be observed with words meaning disorders
and procedures. Nevertheless, with other types of
words (chemicals, borrowings, proper names) no
evolution is observable.

Notice that the same reference data have been
used with supervised categorization algorithms. In
this case, automatic algorithms can reproduce the
reference categorization with F-measure over 0.80
and up to 0.90, which is higher than the inter-
annotator agreement rate. Besides, in the super-
vised categorization task, the behaviour of features
is different from what we can observe in unsuper-
vised clusters: several individual features can re-
produce the reference categories while the best re-
sults are obtained with the whole set of features.

7 Conclusion and Future work

According to our hypothesis, linguistic regulari-
ties, when they occur systematically, can help in
decoding and understanding of technical words
with internal structure (like compounds or derived
words). To test the hypothesis, we work with
French medical words. Almost 30,000 words are
annotated by ﬁve annotators and assigned in one
of the three categories I can understand, I am not
sure, I cannot understand. For each annotator, the
words are ordered randomly.

We then perform an analysis of the whole set of
words, and of words ending with -ite and -tomie.
Our results suggest that several annotators show
the learning effect as the annotation is going on,
which supports our hypothesis and the ﬁndings
of psycholinguistic work (L¨uttmann et al., 2011).
This effect is observed for the whole set of words
and for the two analyzed sufﬁxes. Yet, with chem-
icals, borrowings and proper names, we do not ob-

serve the learning effect.

These observations have been corroborated with
clusters generated using linguistic and extra-
linguistic features. Several clusters are dedicated
to words from either 1 (I can understand) or 3
(I cannot understand) categories. Besides, when
clusters contain some semantically homogeneous
words (disorders, procedures...) we can observe
the expected learning effect. These results are very
interesting and conﬁrm our hypothesis, according
to which linguistic regularities can help to decode
and understand technical and unknown words.
Appropriate features can also help to distinguish
between understandable and non-understandable
words with unsupervised methods. Correlations
between social and demographic status and under-
standing require additional annotations. It will be
studied in the future.

We have several directions for future work: (1)
collect the same type of annotations, but providing
semantics of some or of all components, although
it will be difﬁcult to verify whether this informa-
tion is really exploited by annotators; (2) collect
the same type of annotations, but permitting the
annotators to use external sources of informations
(dictionaries, online examples...). Since this ap-
proach requires more time and cognitive effort,
smaller set of words will be used; (3) analyze the
evolution of understanding of words taking into
account a larger set of components; (4) validate
the observations with tests for statistical signiﬁ-
cance; (5) exploit the results for training and ed-
ucation of non-experts in order to help them with
the understanding of medical notions; (6) exploit
the results for simpliﬁcation of technical texts. For
instance, features of words that show understand-
ing difﬁculties can be used to deﬁne classes of
words that should be systematically simpliﬁed.
