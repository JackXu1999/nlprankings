Abstract

Machine translation between closely related languages is less challenging and exhibits a smaller
number of translation errors than translation between distant languages, but there are still obsta-
cles which should be addressed in order to improve such systems. This work explores the ob-
stacles for machine translation systems between closely related South Slavic languages, namely
Croatian, Serbian and Slovenian. Statistical systems for all language pairs and translation direc-
tions are trained using parallel texts from different domains, however mainly on spoken language
i.e. subtitles. For translation between Serbian and Croatian, a rule-based system is also explored.
It is shown that for all language pairs and for both translation systems, the main obstacles are the
differences between syntactic properties.

1 Introduction

Machine translation (MT) between (closely) related languages is a specific field in the domain of MT
which has attracted the attention of several research teams. Nevertheless, it has not attracted as much
attention as MT between distant languages. This is, on the one side, due to the fact that speakers of these
languages often easily understand each other without switching to the foreign language. Furthermore,
many documents are distributed in their original language, even in the neighbouring countries. Another
fact is that MT between related languages is less problematic than between distant languages (Kolovratnı́k
et al., 2009).

Still, there is a need for translation even between very closely related language pairs such as Serbian
and Croatian, for example, for the sake of producing standard official documents which exixst in one
language but not the other. Another application of such systems is the two-stage (also called “pivot”)
MT (Babych et al., 2007): for example, if an adequate English-Croatian system is available whereas an
English-Serbian system is not, or is of poor quality, English source sentences can first be translated into
Croatian, and then the obtained output is further translated into Serbian by a Croatian-Serbian MT system.
A similar application can also include enriching parallel training corpora by producing “synthetic” data
in the less resourced related language (Bertoldi and Federico, 2009).

This work examines MT systems between three closely related South Slavic languages, namely Croa-
tian, Serbian and Slovenian. Therefore we used the Asistent1 phrase-based translation system (Arčan et
al., 2016), which was developed to translate text between English and the morphological complex south
Slavic languages: Slovene, Serbian and Croatian. Additionally, an RBMT system2 (Klubička et al., 2016)
is analysed for translation between Croatian and Serbian in both directions in order to explore advantages
and disadvantages of both approaches for very close language pairs.

Research questions
Taking into account the language differences among Croatian, Serbian and Slovenian, our main questions
are:

• What are the main obstacles for machine translation between these languages?
• Considering the closeness between Serbian and Croatian, which approach exhibits fewer errors,

SMT or RBMT? What are the most important differences between the two approaches?

1.1 Related work
Although all South Slavic languages are still rather under-resourced and under-investigated, in the last
decade several MT systems have been built between these languages and English. Nevertheless, the
translation between them has been investigated to a much lesser extent.

A rule-based translation system between Slovenian and Serbian has been described in Vičič (2008)
and automatic scores (BLEU, METEOR and edit-distance) as well as adequacy and fluency are reported.
Another work on RBMT between Serbian, Croatian and Slovenian is presented in Peradin et al. (2014).
The SUMAT project3 included a statistical approach for Serbian and Slovenian subtitles (Etchegoyhen
et al., 2014). Nevertheless, a deeper analysis of translation errors or problems has not been performed in
any of these articles.

Evaluation of several scenarios with different models and data-sets involving Croatian are explored
in Toral et al. (2016) in the framework of the Abu-MaTran project4, but only for translation from and to
English. Three MT systems between Croatian and Serbian for the news domain are described in Popović
and Ljubešić (2014), one very basic rule-based system and two SMT systems trained on small and on
large parallel texts. Their performance was not examined in detail however, as they are only used as a
bridge for translation from and into English.

Analysis of problems for MT between closely related languages together with a comparison between
an RBMT and an SMT system is presented in Kubon and Vičič (2014) for the Czech-Slovak language pair.
Similar analysis for South Slavic languages has been performed in Popović and Arčan (2015), though
not for translation between these languages but from and into English and German.

To the best of our knowledge, no systematic investigation of actual difficulties for MT systems trans-
lating between South Slavic languages has been carried out yet.

2 Language properties – similarities and differences

2.1 Common properties
All three languages, Croatian, Serbian and Slovenian, belong to the South-Western Slavic branch. As
Slavic languages, they have a very rich inflectional morphology for all word classes. There are six distinct
cases affecting not only common nouns, but also proper nouns as well as pronouns, adjectives and some
numbers. Some nouns and adjectives have two distinct plural forms depending on the number (less than
five or not). There are also three genders for the nouns, pronouns, adjectives and some numbers leading
to differences between the cases and also between the verb participles for past tense and passive voice.
When it comes to verbs, person and many tenses are expressed by the suffix, and, similarly to Spanish
and Italian, the subject pronoun (e.g. I, we, it) is often omitted. In addition, negation of three quite
important verbs, biti (all languages) (to be), imati (Croatian, Serbian) / imeti (Slovenian) (to have) and
ht(j)eti (Croatian, Serbian) / hoteti (Slovenian) (to want), is formed by adding the negative particle to the
verb as a prefix. There are also two verb aspects, and so many verbs have perfective and imperfective
form(s) depending on the duration of the described action. The different forms are lexicalized, and are
often either different but very similar (e.g. skakati-skočiti), or are distinguished only by prefix (e.g.
gledati-pogledati). It should be noted that this phenomenon is less prominent in Slovenian.

As for syntax, all three languages have quite a free word order, and neither language uses articles,
either definite or indefinite. In addition to this, multiple negation is always used.

It should be also noted that while the Latin alphabet is common for all three languages, Serbian also
uses the Cyrillic script. However, this poses no problem regarding MT because a Cyrillic Serbian text
can be easily transliterated into Latin, as there is one-to-one correspondence between the characters.

2.2 Differences between Croatian and Serbian
Croatian and Serbian exhibit a large overlap in vocabulary and a strong morpho-syntactic similarity so
that the speakers can understand each other without difficulties. Nevertheless, there is a number of small
but notable and also frequently differences occurring differences between them.

The largest differences between the two languages are in vocabulary: some words are completely dif-
ferent, some however differ only by one or two letters. In addition, Serbian language usually phonetically
transcribes foreign names and words although both transcription and transliteration are allowed, whereas
the Croatian standard only transliterates.

Apart from lexical differences, there are also structural differences mainly concerning verbs: modal
verb constructions, future tense, conditional, as well as constructions involving the verb trebati (to need,
should). When it means should, in Croatian it takes the tense according to the subject and it is transitive
as in English (trebam raditi equals I should work). In Serbian however, it is impersonal followed by the
conjunction da and the present of the main verb (treba da radim equals I should work). When it means
to need, the Croatian structure is the same (trebam posao equals I need a job, Petar treba knjige equals
Petar needs books), whereas in Serbian, the verb is conjugated according to the needed object, and the
subject which needs something is an indirect grammatical object in dative case (meni treba posao = I
need a job, Petru trebaju knjige = Petar needs books). The Serbian structure is also possible in Croatian,
although the other one is preferred. Impersonal constructions (treba uraditi = it should be done) are same
in both languages, namely the verb trebati in third person singular is followed by infinitive of the main
verb.

Regarding other modal verbs, the infinitive is prescribed in Croatian (moram raditi = I have to work),
whereas the construction with conjunction da (en. that/to) and present tense is preferred in Serbian
(moram da radim). The mentioned difference partly extends to the future tense which is formed in a
similar manner to English, i.e. using present of the verb ht(j)eti as the auxiliary verb. The infinitive is
formally required in both variants, however, when da+present is used instead, it can additionally express
the subject’s will or intention to perform the action. This form is frequent in Serbian (ja ću da radim
= I will work), whereas in Croatian only the infinitive form is used (ja ću raditi). Another difference
regarding future tense exists when the auxiliary and main verb are reversed: in Croatian, the final i of the
infinitive is removed (radit ću), whereas in Serbian the main and the auxiliary verb merge into a single
word (radiću).

2.3 Differences from Slovenian
Even though Slovenian is very closely related to Croatian and Serbian, and the languages share a large
degree of mutual intelligibility, a number of Croatian/Serbian speakers may have difficulties with Slove-
nian and the other way round.

The nature of the lexical differences is similar to the one between Croatian and Serbian, namely a
number of words is completely different and a number only differs by one or two letters. However, the
amount of different words is much larger. In addition to that, the set of overlapping words includes a
number of false friends (e.g. brati means to pluck in Croatian and Serbian but to read in Slovenian).

The amount of grammatical differences is also larger and includes local word order, verb mood and/or
tense formation, question structure, dual in Slovenian, usage of some cases, structural properties for
certain conjunctions as well as some other structural differences. Local word order differences include,
for example, the order of auxiliary and main verbs: Slovenian allows the auxiliary verb to be at the
beginning of the clause, whereas Croatian and Serbian do not (sem videl/videl sem = video sam = I’ve
seen). Also, the place of reflexive pronoun is different (se vidi = vidi se = it can be seen, se mi zdi = čini
mi se = it seems to me).

Constructions involving the Croatian/Serbian verb trebati differ significantly: in Slovenian, the mean-
ing should is expressed by the adverb treba (bi bilo treba = trebalo bi = it should). For the meaning to

45



need, the verb potrebovati is used in the same form as the verb trebati in Croatian, i.e. it requires the
needed object in accusative case (potrebujem knjigo = trebam knjigu = I need a book).

The main difference regarding tense formation is the future tense. In Slovenian, it is formed using the
auxiliary verb biti and the past participle of the main verb – in Croatian and Serbian, another auxiliary
verb is used, ht(j)eti with the infinitive or da + present tense of the main verb (jaz bom videl = ja ću da
vidim = ja ću vid(j)eti = I will see). Another important difference is Slovenian conditional formed using
the adverb lahko and present tense of the main verb: in Croatian and Serbian it is formed by the modal
verb moći (can and infinitive or da + present tense (lahko vidim = mogao bih da vidim = mogao bih videti
= I could see).

Some conjunctions and/or require completely different structuring. For example, Slovenian tudi (en.
also, too) has a direct equivalent in Croatian and Serbian (takodje(r)), but it is often translated by i. For
negation form neither in Slovenian the construction tudi ne is used, whereas in Croatian and Serbian
a negation conjunction ni is used. Slovenian conjunction pa also has different usage and structural
requirements, and it can also be considered as a false friend.

Another important difference is the Slovenian dual grammatical number which refers to two entities
(apart from singular for one and plural for more than two). It requires additional sets for noun, adjective
and verb inflexion rules not existing either in Croatian or in Serbian.

3 Experimental set-up

3.1 Machine translation systems

The statistical phrase-based systems (Koehn, 2004) were trained using the Moses toolkit (Koehn et al.,
2007) with MERT tuning. The word alignments were built with GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) and
a 5-gram language model was built with kenLM (Heafield, 2011). The parallel texts used to train the
SMT systems were mostly obtained from the OPUS5 web site (Tiedemann, 2009), which contains vari-
ous corpora of different sizes and domains. Although corpora in distinct domains, e.g., legal, medical,
financial, IT, exist for many language pairs including some of the South Slavic languages and English,
parallel data between South Slavic languages pairs consist mostly of the OpenSubtitles6 corpus and a
little portion of the technical domain. For Serbian-Croatian language pair, the SEtimes corpus from the
news domain (Tyers and Alperen, 2010) is also available. In total, about 15 million of sentence/segment
pairs containing about 100 million of running words was used for training (Table 1). For tuning, 2000
sentence pairs were used for each language pair.

The Croatian-Serbian RBMT system is a bidirectional rule-based system which is based on the open-
source Apertium platform (Forcada et al., 2011) and has been built collaboratively between several insti-
tutions as part of the aforementioned Abu-MaTran project. The process involved several workshops that
employed the work of experts and non-experts to gather the necessary data to build a bilingual dictionary
and to verify correct transfer rules automatically inferred using a tool developed by Sánchez-Cartagena
et al. (2015). Work on the translator has continued since, and at the time of writing this paper the bilin-
gual dictionary has quite a high coverage, containing a total of 88521 bilingual lemma entries, while
the number of defined transfer rules in the Serbian-Croatian direction is 99, and 86 in the Croatian-
Serbian direction. At the time of publication, the system was automatically evaluated on 351 Serbian
sentences gathered from newspaper texts that were manually translated into Croatian, and when com-
pared to Google Translate, the only other available system at the time, the RBMT system yielded higher
scores. For more details on the construction and evaluation of the system, refer to Klubička et al. (2016).

3.2 Test sets

The in-domain data set used for evaluating SMT performance consists of about 2000 sentences for each
language pair isolated from the training data set. Therefore, the test data consist mostly out of the Open-
Subtitles corpus, since this corpus builds the largest part (95%) of the data used to train the translation
models.

Table 1: Statistics on parallel corpora used to build the translation models (explanation: Slovene-Croatian

Such data sets are usual for evaluation and comparing SMT systems, however, they are not optimal
for comparing an SMT and an RBMT system since they originate from the same text type as the SMT
training corpus – the results would probably be biased. Therefore, additional test sets were created for
this comparison:

• 1000 Croatian source sentences were extracted from the hrenWaC and DGT part of the OPUS data
and translated by both systems into Serbian; about 300 segments from each of the translation outputs
were post-edited by native speakers.

• 3000 Serbian source sentences were extracted from a corpus containing language course material
and translated by both systems into Croatian; about 450 segments from each of the translation
outputs were post-edited by native speakers.

In addition, a subset of the Slovenian-to-Serbian SMT translation output containing about 350 sentences
was post-edited as well.
The test sets were post-edited for two reasons:

1. post-edited data are generally more convenient for analysis and identifying prominent errors and
issues;

2. the OpenSubtitles contain translations from English the as original source so that the obtained trans-
lations are often too different and do not fully reflect the language closeness.

Although it was not the motivation for post-editing, it should be noted that there were no available
reference translations for Croatian-Serbian additional test sets.

3.3 Evaluation
For all test sets and MT systems, BLEU scores (Papineni et al., 2002) and character n-gram F-scores
CHRF3 (Popović, 2015) are reported. BLEU is a well-known and widely used metric, and CHRF3 is
shown to correlate very well with human judgments for morphologically rich languages (Stanojević et
al., 2015). Besides, it seems convenient for closely related languages since a large portion of differences
is on the character level.

In order to better understand the overall evaluation scores and differences between the MT systems,
five error classes, produced by the automatic error analysis tool Hjerson (Popović, 2011), are reported.

Finally, in order to determine most prominent language related issues for the MT systems, a manual
inspection of the errors and their causes is carried out, predominantly on the post-edited data.

4 Evaluation results on standard in-domain test sets

Table 2 presents the automatic scores for standard test sets for all SMT systems together with the scores
for translations7 by the publicly available Google translate8 system.

The obtained scores are rather high for translation between Serbian and Croatian and lower for trans-
lations involving Slovenian. Nevertheless, considering the language closeness, the scores are not particu-
larly high – the most probable reason are the “unnecessary” differences introduced by human translation
from a third language, namely English. It can be noted that translation into Serbian is worse than into
the other two languages and that translation into Slovenian is better than into the other two languages.

Table 3 gives details on the translation error classes. For the Serbian-Croatian language pair most
errors are lexical, whereas there is a rather low number of inflectional and ordering errors. This can
be expected considering that the main differences between the languages are on the lexical level, as
described in Section 2.2. As for translating from and into Slovenian, lexical errors are also predominant
and much more frequent. Furthermore, the amount of ordering and inflectional errors is not negligible.
These results are consistent with the language differences described in Section 2.3, however, they are not
giving precise information of which phenomena are causing which errors. For this purpose, a shallow
manual inspection of errors is carried out. It has been noted that the structural differences often result
in different error types. Nevertheless it was not easy to isolate specific phenomena due to the described
suboptimal test sets. Therefore the manual inspection of errors has been carried out thoroughly on the
post-edited data and the results are reported in the next section.

5 Evaluation results on post-edited test sets

The first evaluation step of post-edited test sets was performed to calculate automatic evaluation metrics
and class error rates. After that, a detailed manual inspection of language related phenomena leading to
particular errors is carried out. Finally, the most problematic phenomena were isolated from test sets and
evaluated separately.

5.1 Croatian-Serbian translation
The manual analysis revealed that for the Croatian-Serbian translation in both directions, constructions
involving the verb trebati pose the most problems, both for the SMT as well as the RBMT system. There-
fore, the segments containing this verb were isolated and analysed separately. The automatic evaluation
scores are presented in Table 4, both for the whole test set as well as for the segments containing trebati.

• the overall performance is better for the SMT system, mainly due to less lexical errors;
• the RBMT system handles better the constructions with trebati producing less inflectional and lexical

errors which are the predominant error types produced in these constructions

• both systems perform slightly better for translation into Croatian, but trebati constructions are better
translated into Serbian by both systems. A probable reason for this is the different nature of the used
test texts.

Especially problematic structures for both systems are long range dependencies where the main verb(s)
is/are separated from the verb trebati. Furthermore, mistranslations were detected because of impersonal
constructions and conditional forms, which are more problematic for the RBMT system. In addition, the
meaning to need is often incorrectly translated by both systems, especially from Serbian into Croatian.

All in all, there is no significant difference between the performance of the SMT and the RBMT ap-
proach. Nevertheless, the systems do not always fail in the same way of the same segment, which
indicates that a hybrid approach for this language pair could be beneficial.

5.2 Slovenian-to-Serbian translation
Manual evaluation has shown that the most frequent problems in Slovenian→Serbian post-edited trans-
lations are the future tense and the structures involving the Slovenian conjunction tudi (also/too). There-

fore, sentences containing these two structures were identified and analysed separately.
For this translation direction, an additional preliminary experiment has been carried out, namely an

attempt to improve the translation quality by two-stage (bridge, pivot) translation via Croatian.
Table 5 shows the overall post-edited results as well as the results on segments containing future tense

and tudi both for direct as well as for two-stage SMT system. In addition, results for the overall standard
test set are also shown for both systems. The following can be observed from the presented results:

• as expected, the automatic scores on post-edited test are lower than for Croatian-Serbian translation,
but not so much lower as for the standard (suboptimal) test sets;

• scores on segments containing future tense and tudi are lower than overall scores;
• two-stage translation via Croatian generally helps, especially for the problematic segments – it

reduces the number of inflectional edits, omissions and lexical edits;

• main disadvantage of two-stage translation is the increased amount of reordering errors.
The results show that two-stage translation has a good potential and should be further investigated.

Further investigation should also include other translation directions from and into Slovenian, using
different types of data sets.

6 Summary and outlook

This work represents a first step in the systematic evaluation of MT results between Croatian, Serbian
and Slovenian and it has already shown several interesting results.

The analysis has revealed that the differences between the structural properties represent the most
prominent issue for all translation directions. For translation between Croatian and Serbian, the construc-
tions involving the verb trebati (should/need) definitely represent the larger obstacle for both translation
directions and for both MT approaches, statistical as well as rule-based. However, the systems do not fail
in the same way on the same segments, therefore hybrid systems should be investigated in future work.

For translations from Slovenian into Serbian, future tense represents one of the dominant issues fol-
lowed by conjunction/adverb tudi. Other translation directions involving Slovenian have to be explored
in future work. Two-stage translation via Croatian improves significantly the performance of the seg-
ments containing those problematic structures, the rest of the segments, however, are partially improved
and partially deteriorated by introducing reordering errors and should be further investigated.

50



Future work should also include working on the identified issues, namely improving the systems by
targeting the verb trebati and the Slovenian future tense. Also, other MT methods, such as hierarchical
phrase-based and neural approach, should be investigated.
