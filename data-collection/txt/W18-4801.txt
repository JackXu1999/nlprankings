Abstract 

Given advances in computational linguistic analysis of complex languages using Machine 
Learning as well as standard Finite State Transducers, coupled with recent efforts in language 
revitalization, the time was right to organize a first workshop to bring together experts in 
language technology and linguists on the one hand with language practitioners and 
revitalization experts on the other. This one-day meeting provides a promising forum to discuss 
new research on polysynthetic languages in combination with the needs of linguistic 
communities where such languages are written and spoken. Finally, this overview article 
summarizes the papers to be presented, along with goals and purpose. 

 

Motivation 

Polysynthetic languages are characterized by words that are composed of multiple morphemes, often 
to the extent that one long word can express the meaning contained in a multi-word sentence in lan-
guage like English. To illustrate, consider the following example from Inuktitut, one of the official 
languages of the Territory of Nunavut in Canada. The morpheme -tusaa- (shown in boldface below) is 
the root, and all the other morphemes are synthetically combined with it in one unit.1 
 
(1) tusaa-tsia-runna-nngit-tu-alu-u-junga  
      hear-well-be.able-NEG-DOER-very-BE-PART.1.S 
    ‘I can't hear very well.’ 
 
Kabardian (Circassian), from the Northwest Caucasus, also shows this phenomenon, with the root -še- 
shown in boldface below: 
 
(2)  wə-q’ə-d-ej-z-γe-še-ž’e-f-a-te-q’əm 
      2SG.OBJ-DIR-LOC-3SG.OBJ-1SG.SUBJ-CAUS-lead-COMPL-POTENTIAL-PAST-PRF-NEG 
      ‘I would not let you bring him right back here.’ 
 
Polysynthetic languages are spoken all over the globe and are richly represented among Native North 
and South American families. Many polysynthetic languages are among the world’s most endangered 
languages,2 with fragmented dialects and communities struggling to preserve their linguistic heritage. 
In particular, polysynthetic languages can be found in the US Southwest (Southern Tiwa, Kiowa 
Tanoan family), Canada, Mexico (Nahuatl, Uto-Aztecan family), and Central Chile (Mapudungun,

2	In fact, the majority of the languages spoken in the world today are endangered and disappearing fast (See Bird, 2009). 
Estimates are that, of the approximately 7000 languages in the world today, at least one disappears every day  
(https://www.ethnologue.com).

Araucanian), as well as in Australia (Nunggubuyu, Macro-Gunwinyguan family), Northeastern Siberia 
(Chukchi and Koryak, both from the Chukotko-Kamchatkan family), and India (Sora, Munda family), 
as shown in the map below (Figure 1). 

This workshop addresses the needs for documentation, archiving, creation of corpora and teaching ma-
terials that are specific to polysynthetic languages. Documentation and corpus-building challenges 
arise for many languages, but the complex morphological makeup of polysynthetic languages makes 
consistent documentation particularly difficult. This workshop is the first ever meeting where re-
searchers and practitioners working on polysynthetic languages discuss common problems and diffi-
culties, and it is intended as the capstone to establishing possible collaborations and ongoing partner-
ships of the relevant issues.

Defining Polysynthesis:  An Ongoing Linguistic Challenge   

Although there are many definitions of polysynthesis, there is often confusion on what constitutes the 
exact criteria and phenomena (Mithun 2017). Even authoritative sources categorize languages in con-
flicting ways.4 Typically, polysynthetic languages demonstrate holophrasis, i.e. the ability of an entire 
sentence to be expressed in what is considered by native speakers to be just one word (Bird 2009). In

4 For example, the article in the Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Linguistics on “Polysynthesis: A Diachronic and Typologi-
cal Perspective” by Michael Fortescue (Fortescue, 2016), a well-known expert on polysynthesis, lists Aymara as possibly 
polysynthetic, whereas others designate it as agglutinative (http://www.native-languages.org).

linguistic typology, the opposite of polysynthesis is isolation. Polysynthesis technically (etymological-
ly) refers to how many morphemes there are per word. Using that criterion, the typological cline can 
be represented as follows: 

(3)  isolating/analytic languages > synthetic languages > polysynthetic languages  

Adding another dimension of morphological categorization, languages can be distinguished by the de-
gree of clarity of morpheme boundaries. If we apply this criterion, languages can be categorized ac-
cording to the following typological cline: 

(4)  agglutinating > mildly fusional > fusional 

Thus, a language might be characterized overall as polysynthetic and agglutinating, that is, generally a 
high number of morphemes per word, with clear boundaries between morphemes and thus easily seg-
mentable. Another language might be characterized as polysynthetic and fusional, so again, many 
morphemes per word, but so many phonological and other processes have occurred that segmenting 
morphemes becomes less trivial. 

So far we have discussed the morphological aspects of polysynthesis. Polysynthesis also has a number 
of syntactic ramifications, richly explored in the work of Baker (Baker 1997; 2002). He proposes a 
cluster of correlated syntactic properties associated with polysynthesis. Here we will mention just two 
of these properties: rich agreement (with the subject, direct object, indirect object, and applied objects 
if present) and omission of free-standing arguments (pro-drop). 

Polysynthetic languages are of interest for both theoretical and practical reasons.  On the theoretical 
side, these languages offer a potentially unique window into human cognition and language capabili-
ties as well as into language acquisition (Mithun 1989; Greenberg 1960; Comrie 1981; Fortescue et al. 
2017). They also pose unique challenges for traditional computational systems (Byrd et al. 1986). 
Even in allegedly cross-linguistic or typological analyses of specific phenomena, e.g. in forming a the-
ory of clitics and cliticization (Klavans 1995), finding the full range of language types on which to test 
hypotheses proves difficult. Often, the data is simply not available so claims cannot be either refuted 
or supported fully. 

On the applied side, many morphologically complex languages are crucial to purposes in domains 
ranging from health care,5 search and rescue, to the maintenance of cultural history. Add to this the 
interest in low-resource languages (from Inuktitut and Yup’ik in the North and East of Canada with 
over 35,000 speakers, and all the way to Northwest Caucasian), which is important for linguistic, cul-
tural and governmental reasons. Many of the data collections in these languages, when annotated and 
aligned well, can serve as input to systems to automatically create correspondences, and these in turn 
can be useful to teachers in creating resources for their learners (Adams, Neubig, Cohn, & Bird 2015). 
These languages are generally not of immediate commercial value, and yet the research community 
needs to cope with fundamental issues of language complexity. Consequently, research on these lan-
guage could have unanticipated benefits on many levels. 
																																																								
5 For example, the USAID has funded a program in the mountains of Ecuador to provide maternal care in 
Quechua-dominant areas to reduce maternal and infant mortality rates, taking into account local cultural and lan-
guage needs (https://www.usaidassist.org). Quechua is highly agglutinative, not polysynthetic; it is spoken by 
millions of speakers and has few corpora with limited annotation.

Finally, many of these understudied languages occur in areas that are key for health concerns (e.g. the 
AIDS epidemic) and international security. Consider the map in Figure 2, which shows languages 
identified as Language Hotspots, i.e. low resource and/or endangered. For example, many languages in 
the Siberian peninsula (which is of strategic political importance) are endangered and polysynthetic. 
Comparing the two maps in Figures 1 and 2 shows these languages are more widespread than is com-
monly believed.  Understanding theoretical mechanisms underlying the range of language types con-
tributes to teaching, learning, maintaining and data-mining across both speech and text in these lan-
guages and beyond.

Corpus Collection and Annotation 

The more language data that is gathered and accurately analyzed, the more deep cross-linguistic anal-
yses can be conducted which in turn will contribute to a range of fields including linguistic theory, 
language teaching and lexicography. For example, in examining cross-linguistic analyses of headed-
ness, Polinsky (Polinsky 2012) gathered as much data as possible to examine the question of whether 
the noun-verb ratio differs across headedness types. She collected as much numerical data as she could 
identify across a sample of languages. However, she notes that: 

“[T]he seemingly simple question of counting nouns and verbs is a quite difficult one; even obtaining data 
about the overall number of nouns and verbs proves to be an immense challenge. The ultimate consequence 
is that linguists lack reasonable tools to compare languages with respect to their lexical category size. Co-
operation between theoreticians and lexicographers is of critical importance: just as comparative syntax 
received a big boost from the micro-comparative work on closely related languages (Romance; Germanic;

Semitic), so micro-comparative WordNet building may lead to important breakthroughs that will benefit the 
field as a whole.” (Polinsky, 2012, p. 351) 

One of the underlying causes of this difficulty is that there are many languages for which a clear lexi-
cal division between nouns and verbs has been challenged; these languages are characterized by a 
large class of roots that are used either nominally or verbally, and many of these languages typically 
have polysynthetic features (cf. Lois & Vapnarsky 2006 for Amerindian, Aranovich 2013 for Austro-
nesian, Testelets et al. 2009 for Adyghe, Davis & Matthewson 2009, Watanabe 2017 for Salish). 
Without a clear definition of what counts as a verb and what as a noun, there is no reliable way to 
compute significant correlations. Thus, a deeper understanding of polysynthetic phenomena may well 
contribute to a more nuanced understanding of cross-language comparisons and generalizations and 
enable researchers to pose meaningful and answerable questions about comparative features across 
languages. 

One of the goals of the workshop is to identify and build new resources, with annotation that is effec-
tive for a range of efforts, as outlined in Levow et al. (2017). We will ensure that all materials resulting 
from this workshop are listed in the LDC catalog with adequate metadata giving descriptions, pointers, 
terms and conditions and other facts necessary for use. What we have found is that there are corpora in 
many different places by different types of community actors, and often they are difficult to locate and 
obtain. Building models and theoretical descriptions can be challenging without adequate data, and this 
is a gap we plan to address along with the many others involved in this endeavor. 

While collections of annotated corpora (spoken and written) for major isolating, agglutinative and in-
flectional languages exist (https://www.ldc.upenn.edu), there are significant additional complexities 
involved when it comes to polysynthetic languages, including: 

● tokenization - what are the boundaries for units of meaning?  How are morphology and 
syntax delimited?	

● lemmatization - where is the root? which morphemes are affixes? which are clitics?	
● part-of-speech tagging 	
● glossing and translation into other languages	

 
Linguistic data in these languages, be it text or audio, is scarce. This has created challenges for lan-
guage analysis as well as for revitalization efforts. Only recently have researchers started collecting 
well-designed corpora for polysynthetic languages, e.g. for Circassian (Arkhangelskiy & Lander 2016) 
or Arapaho (Kazeminejad et al. 2017). 

Towards a shared task 

Concomitant with the collection and cataloging of corpora, as part of the workshop, we aim to formu-
late a shared task, that meets the goals outlined in Levow, et al. (2017), namely, to “align the interests 
of the speech and language processing communities with those of endangered language documentation 
communities.” Levow et al. 2017 propose an initial set of possible shared tasks based on the design 
principles of realism, typological diversity, accessibility of the shared task, accessibility of the result-

ing software, extensibility and nuanced evaluation. In addition to coordinating with the NSF-funded 
EL-STEC project, we have consulted with the SIGMORPHON organizers,7 and Morpho Challenge 
project. We have also collaborated with organizers of the Documenting Endangered Languages Work-
shops (notably Jeff Good of the University at Buffalo). We have also coordinated with the NSF-funded 
CoLang program (Institute on Collaborative Language Research) at the University of Florida 
(http://colang.lin.ufl.edu/).  Given the challenges of compiling a shared task, we have planned sessions 
during the workshop for participants to engage together in the creation of a shared task. In this way, 
we will involve community activists in the task formulation, which will lead to a higher chance of ac-
tually meeting local language needs. 

Related Projects and Conferences 

In recent years, there has been a surge of major research on many of these languages. For example, the 
first Endangered Languages (ELs) Workshop held in conjunction with ACL was held in 2014 and the 
second in 2017.8 The National Science Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities 
jointly fund a program for research on ELs.9 The US government through IARPA and DARPA both 
have programs for translation, including for low resource languages.10 The IARPA BABEL project 
focused on keyword search over speech for a variety of typologically different languages, including 
some with polysynthetic features. 

To reiterate, an interdisciplinary workshop specifically on the challenges of dealing with polysynthesis 
in computational linguistics has not been held before. The languages involved in Morph-Challenge 
(http://morpho.aalto.fi/events/morphochallenge/) did not include polysynthetic languages, nor did 
SIGMORPHON (http://ryancotterell.github.io/sigmorphon2016/). Given recent advances in computa-
tional morphology, a workshop that addresses the full range of morpho-syntactic features of language, 
extending to and including polysynthesis, is timely.  

As indicated above, this workshop brings together researchers from multidisciplinary fields to address 
ongoing challenges and to compare outputs of various recent approaches, resulting in a lively venue 
for discussion and argument. The specific goals of the proposed workshop include:  

1. To bring together experts in linguistic theory and computational linguistics with those working 
on preserving and reviving indigenous languages. 

2. To discuss the potential of technologies (e.g., text-to-speech systems, segmentation of speech 
files by speaker, audio-indexing, morphological analysis) to assist in language revitalization. 

3. To construct and annotate data sets in these languages for use by the relevant linguistic com-
munities; these datasets can be used for research and practical applications.

Discussion of Workshop Papers 

Eight papers were accepted to the Workshop.  The languages and technologies discussed are wide-
ranging and reflected the intended nature of the meeting as inclusive and exploratory.  Languages in-
clude: 

• Hinónoʼeitíít  - Arapaho (in English:), one of the highly-endangered Plains Algonquian lan-
guages (unknown numbers, ranging from 500 to 2500 speakers) 

• Nahuatl, Wixarika and Yorem Nokki - from the Uto-Aztecan language family (estimated 1.5 
million speakers) 

• Kwak'wala - spoken by the Kwakwaka'wakw people (which means "those who speak Kwa-
k'wala") and highly-endangered, belonging to the Wakashan language family (estimated 250 
speakers). 

• Kanyen'kéha (Ohsweken dialect) - language of the Iroquoian family commonly known as Mo-
hawk, spoken in parts of Canada (Ontario and Quebec) and the United States (New York state) 
with about 3500 native speakers. 

• Inuktitut - one of the principal Inuit languages used in parts of Newfoundland and Labrador, 
Quebec, the Northwest Territories and Nunavit, recognized as an official language in the Prov-
ince of Nunavut with about 40,000 speakers.  

• Chuckchi - a Chukotko–Kamchatkan language spoken in the easternmost extremity of Siberia, 
mainly in Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, rapidly decreasing in speakers with only about 500 
native speakers left, down from nearly 8000 15 years ago. 

We accepted one paper on an agglutinative language, with projected hypotheses on how the techniques 
might apply to some of the challenges of polysynthesis, namely; 

• Lezgi (лезги ), a statutory language of provincial identity in Dagestan Autonomous Republic 
west of the Caspian sea coast in the  central Caucasus and a member of the Nakh-
Daghestanian languages (approx. 600,000 speakers). 

Our justification for including this paper is that we believe the authors may be able to test their tech-
niques on other languages, so this paper will serve as a baseline for future research. 

The technologies range from research on Finite State Transducers (FSTs), Statistical and Rule-Based 
Machine Translation (SMTs), Conditional Random Fields (CRF) and CRF with Support Vector Ma-
chines (CRF-SVM), Neural Machine Translation (seq2seq) and Segmental Recurrent Neural Nets 
(SRNNs).  Applications include morphological analysis, glossing, verb conjugation and generation, 
machine translation. 

Although each article in the Workshop represents a specific and original contribution, either in method 
or in application of method to a given polysynthetic language or language group, as a whole, this col-

lection of papers contributes to the literature that addresses the interdependence between linguistic 
theory, language revitalization, education and computational contributions.  These relationships are 
reflected in the choice of invited speaker and in the panel. 

Invited speaker 

We are honored to have had the invited talk from Brian Maracle (Owennatekha, Turtle Clan, Mo-
hawk), founder and teacher at the Onkwawenna Kentyohkwa Mohawk immersion school and head of 
the Mohawk-language school on the Six Nations Reserve near Brantford, Ontario. Maracle has been a 
language activist for nearly 25 years and has developed and published materials, as well as teaching 
adults and young people.  He left a lucrative career to return to the reservation of his youth.  His book 
Back on the Rez: Finding the Way Home (Penguin 1993) documents his path back and struggles to 
understand meetings held in the Kanyen’kehaka (Mohawk) language.  These experiences led to his 
groundbreaking work in language revitalization.11  Brian’s dynamic and deep commitment to language 
documentation, teaching, and policy have had an impact on many people from linguists to anthropolo-
gists to teachers to elders to children and even to politicians. 

Invited Panel – How Can We Work Together? 
One of the goals of the Workshop is to create dialog between those language professionals who collect 
and annotate language data for polysynthetic languages, those who are committed to linguistic analy-
sis, those who develop and apply computational methods to these languages, and those who are dedi-
cated to revitalization through policy, education and community activism.  Too often, these communi-
ties do not interact enough to benefit each other, so there is a lost opportunity cost all around. This lost 
opportunity, especially in the case of endangered languages, is one that cannot be recuperated.  Thus, it 
is urgent to work towards the goal of leveraging each other’s efforts. 
 
Towards this end, we have organized a panel the purpose of which is to address and debate some of 
the controversial issues that arise in the process of establishing better communication.  Some of these 
issues include such provocative and often divisive points such as: 

• I am a teacher and none of your so-called useful tools are of any use to me.  Why can’t you 
come to my classroom and see what we really need? 

• I am a computer scientist and I want to find out what is the best method to use to figure out 
how to morphologically analyze and label your really long words?  How much text can you 
annotate for me so that I can train my systems? 

• I am a speech recognition expert and I really need more data of spoken language transcribed 
into an accurate phonetic representation?  Why can’t you just ask people to make some record-
ings for me and then turn that into text? 

• I am a revitalization expert and I want to establish new policy for my town so we can get a 
new school started.  If you’re a linguist, what can you tell me about other programs and how it 
might help in enforcing cultural identity and competence so I can convince people that we 
need funding?

• I am developing curricula for a set of new classes for my endangered language.  What kind of 
experience do you have in making dictionaries so my students can look up words they don’t 
know? 

• I am the child in a family where my parents and grandparents only speak their local language 
and not the dominant language of the government. I want to make sure that all important gov-
ernment documents are translated into my local language so the many elders like mine are em-
powered and so that I can pass this language onto my children.  You are a computational lin-
guist so how can you help?  In fact, do you even care about this? 

 
Future work will include follow up on documentation, corpus collection, revitalization, annotation, 
tools for analysis and methods to contribute both to the wide range of fields this research draws upon 
and impacts. 
 
Acknowledgements: 
 
Of the many workshops this author has organized and of the many program chairships she has held, 
she has never experienced 100% fulfillment of reviewing commitments from the program committee.  
The reviewers were thorough and detailed, which was deeply appreciated by the authors.  More than 
one author thanked the organizing committee for the exhaustive in-depth anonymous reviews from the 
different perspectives of the fields represented.   I believe this is due to the fact that each of the re-
viewers is committed to language maintenance, to linguistic accuracy and to the potential for computa-
tional approaches to make a contribution to teaching and learning of these rich and challenging lan-
guages.
