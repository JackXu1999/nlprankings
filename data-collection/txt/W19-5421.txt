Abstract

The 2019 WMT Biomedical translation task
involved translating Medline abstracts. We ap-
proached this using transfer learning to ob-
tain a series of strong neural models on dis-
tinct domains, and combining them into multi-
domain ensembles. We further experiment
with an adaptive language-model ensemble
weighting scheme. Our submission achieved
the best submitted results on both directions of
English-Spanish.

1 Introduction

Neural Machine Translation (NMT) in the
biomedical domain presents challenges in addi-
tion to general domain translation. Firstly, avail-
able corpora are relatively small, exacerbating the
effect of noisy or poorly aligned training data.
Secondly, individual sentences within a biomed-
ical document may use specialist vocabulary from
small domains like health or statistics, or may con-
tain generic language. Training to convergence on
a single biomedical dataset may therefore not cor-
respond to good performance on arbitrary biomed-
ical test data.

Transfer learning is an approach in which a
model is trained using knowledge from an exist-
ing model (Khan et al., 2018). Transfer learning
typically involves initial training on a large, gen-
eral domain corpus, followed by fine-tuning on the
domain of interest. We apply transfer learning iter-
atively on datasets from different domains, obtain-
ing strong models that cover two domains for both
directions of the English-German language pair,
and three domains for both directions of English-
Spanish.

The domain of individual documents in the
2019 Medline test dataset is unknown, and may
vary sentence-to-sentence. Evenly-weighted en-
sembles of models from different domains can

give good results in this case (Freitag and Al-
Onaizan, 2016). However, we suggest a better
approach would take into account the likely do-
main, or domains, of each test sentence. We there-
fore investigate applying Bayesian Interpolation
for language-model based multi-domain ensemble
weighting.

1.1 Iterative transfer learning

Transfer learning has been used to adapt models
both across domains, e.g. news to biomedical
domain adaptation, and within one domain, e.g.
WMT14 biomedical data to WMT18 biomedical
data (Khan et al., 2018). For en2de and de2en we
have only one distinct in-domain dataset, and so
we use standard transfer learning from a general
domain news model.

For es2en and en2es, we use the domain-
labelled Scielo dataset to provide two distinct
domains, health and biological sciences (‘bio’),
in addition to the complete biomedical dataset
(Neves et al., 2016). We therefore experiment
with iterative transfer learning, in which a model
trained with transfer learning is then trained fur-
ther on the original domain.

NMT transfer learning for domain adaptation
involves using the performance of a model on
some general domain A to improve performance
on some other domain B: A → B. However, if
the two domains are sufficiently related, we sug-
gest that task B could equally be used for trans-
fer learning A: B → A. The stronger general
model A could then be used to achieve even bet-
ter performance on other tasks: B → A → B,
B → A→ C, and so on.

1.2 Adaptive decoding

Previous work on transfer learning typically aims
to find a single model that performs well on a
known domain of interest (Khan et al., 2018).



170

The biomedical translation task offers a scenario
in which the test domain is unknown, since indi-
vidual Medline documents can have very different
styles and topics. Our approach is to decode such
test data with an ensemble of distinct domains.

For intuitive ensemble weights, we use
sequence-to-sequence Bayesian Interpolation (BI)
as described in Saunders et al. (2019), which also
contains a more in-depth derivation and discusses
possible hyperparameter configurations. We
consider models pk(y|x) trained on K domains,
used for T = K domain decoding tasks. We
assume throughout that p(t) = 1T , i.e. that tasks
are equally likely absent any other information.
Weights λk,t define a task-conditional ensemble.
At step i, where hi = y1:i−1 is decoding history:

p(yi|hi,x) =
K∑
k=1

pk(yi|hi,x)
T∑
t=1

p(t|hi,x)λk,t

(1)

This is an adaptively weighted ensemble where,
for each source sentence x and output hypothesis
y, we re-estimate p(t|hi,x) at each step:

p(t|hi,x) =
p(hi|t,x)p(t|x)∑T

t′=1 p(hi|t′,x)p(t′|x)
(2)

p(hi|t,x) is found from the last score of each
model:

p(hi|t,x) = p(yi−1|hi−1, t,x) (3)

=
∑
k

pk(yi−1|hi−1, t,x)λk,t

We use Gt, an n-gram language model trained on
source training sentences from task t, to estimate
initial task posterior p(t|x):

p(x|t)p(t)∑T
t′=1 p(x|t′)p(t′)

=
Gt(x)

α∑T
t′=1Gt′(x)

α
(4)

Here α is a smoothing parameter. If Gk,t =∑
x∈Testt Gk(x), we take:

λk,t =
G
α
k,t∑

k′ G
α
k′,t

Figure 1 demonstrates this adaptive decoding
when weighting a biomedical and a general (news)
domain model to produce a biomedical sentence.
The model weights are even until biomedical-
specific vocabulary is produced, at which point the
in-domain model dominates.

1.3 Related work

Transfer learning has been applied to NMT in
many forms. Luong and Manning (2015) use
transfer learning to adapt a general model to in-
domain data. Zoph et al. (2016) use multilin-
gual transfer learning to improve NMT for low-
resource languages. Chu et al. (2017) intro-
duce mixed fine-tuning, which carries out trans-
fer learning to a new domain combined with some
original domain data. Kobus et al. (2017) train a
single model on multiple domains using domain
tags. Khan et al. (2018) sequentially adapt across
multiple biomedical domains to obtain one single-
domain model.

At inference time, Freitag and Al-Onaizan
(2016) use uniform ensembles of general and fine-
tuned models. Our Bayesian Interpolation experi-
ments extend previous work by Allauzen and Ri-
ley (2011) on Bayesian Interpolation for language
model combination.

we additionally reuse strong general domain mod-
els trained on the WMT19 news data, includ-
ing filtered Paracrawl. Details of data prepara-
tion and filtering for these models are discussed
in Stahlberg et al. (2019).

For each language pair we use the same train-
ing data in both directions, and use a 32K-merge
source-target BPE vocabulary (Sennrich et al.,
2016) trained on the ‘base’ domain training data
(news for en-de, Scielo health for es-en)

For the biomedical data, we preprocess the data
using Moses tokenization, punctuation normaliza-
tion and truecasing. We then use a series of simple
heuristics to filter the parallel datasets:

• Detected language filtering using the Python
langdetect package6. In addition to mis-
labelled sentences, this step removes many
sentences which are very short or have a high
proportion of punctuation or HTML tags.

• Remove sentences containing more than 120
tokens or fewer than 3.

• Remove duplicate sentence pairs

• Remove sentences where the ratio of source
to target tokens is less than 1:3.5 or more than
3.5:1

• Remove pairs where more than 30% of either
sentence is the same token.

2.2 Model hyperparameters and training
We use the Tensor2Tensor implementation of the
Transformer model with the transformer big
setup for all NMT models (Vaswani et al., 2018).
By default this model size limits batch size of

6https://pypi.org/project/langdetect/

2K due to memory constraints. We delay gra-
dient updates by a factor of 8, letting us effec-
tively use a 16K batch size (Saunders et al., 2018).
We train each domain model until it fails to im-
prove on the domain validation set in 3 consecu-
tive checkpoints, and perform checkpoint averag-
ing over the final 10 checkpoints to obtain the final
model (Junczys-Dowmunt et al., 2016).

At inference time we decode with beam size
4 using SGNMT (Stahlberg et al., 2017). For
BI we use 2-gram KENLM models (Heafield,
2011) trained on the source training data for each
domain. For validation results we report cased
BLEU scores with SacreBLEU (Post, 2018)7; test
results use case-insensitive BLEU.

2.3 Results
Our first experiments involve iterative transfer
learning in es2en and en2es to obtain models on
three separate domains for the remaining evalua-
tion. We use health, a relatively clean and small
dataset, as the initial domain to train from scratch.
Once converged, we use this to initialise training
on the larger, noiser all-biomed corpus. When
the all-biomed model has converged, we use it to
initialise training on the health data and bio data
for stronger models on those domains. Figure 2
shows the training progression for the health and
all-biomed models, as well as the standard transfer
learning case where we train on all-biomed from
scratch.

Table 2 gives single model validation scores for
es2en and en2es models with standard and itera-
tive transfer learning. We find that the all-biomed
domain gains 1-2 BLEU points from transfer
learning. Moreover, the health domain gains on

all domains from iterative transfer learning rela-
tive to training from scratch and relative to stan-
dard transfer learning(All-biomed→ Health), de-
spite being trained twice to convergence on health.

We submitted three runs to the WMT19
biomedical task for each language pair: the best
single all-biomed model, a uniform ensemble of
models on two en-de and three es-en domains, and
an ensemble with Bayesian Interpolation. Tables
3 and 4 give validation and test scores.

We find that a uniform multi-domain ensemble
performs well, giving 0.5-1.2 BLEU improvement
on the test set over strong single models. We see
small gains from using BI with ensembles on most
validation sets, but only on en2es test.

Following test result release, we noted that, in
general, we could predict BI (α = 0.5) perfor-
mance by comparing the uniform ensemble with
the oracle model performing best on each valida-
tion domain. For en2es uniform ensembling un-
derperforms the health and bio oracle models on
their validation sets, and the uniform ensemble
slightly underperforms BI on the test data. For
en2de, by contrast, uniform ensembling is consis-
tently better than oracles on the dev sets, and out-
performs BI on the test data. For de2en and es2en,

uniform ensembling performs similarly to the ora-
cles, and performs similarly to BI.

From this, we hypothesise that BI (α = 0.5)
has a tendency to converge to a single model.
This is effective when single models perform well
(en2es) but ineffective if the uniform ensemble is
predictably better than any single model (en2de).
Consequently in Table 5 we experiment with BI
(α = 0.1). In this case BI matches or out-performs
the uniform ensemble. Notably, for en2es, where
BI (α = 0.5) performed well, taking α = 0.1 does
not harm performance.

3 Conclusions

Our WMT19 Biomedical submission covers the
English-German and English-Spanish language
pairs, achieving the best submitted results on both
directions of English-Spanish. We use transfer
learning iteratively to train single models which
perform well on related but distinct domains,
and show further gains from multi-domain en-
sembles. We explore Bayesian Interpolation for
multi-domain ensemble weighting, and find that a
strongly smoothed case gives small gains over uni-
form ensembles.
