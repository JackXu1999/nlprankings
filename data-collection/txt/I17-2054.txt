Abstract 

Corpus is a valuable resource for in-

formation retrieval and data-driven 

natural language processing systems, 

especially for spoken dialogue re-

search in specific domains. However, 

there is little non-English corpora, par-

ticular for ones in Chinese. Spoken by 

the nation with the largest population 

in the world, Chinese become 

increasingly prevalent and popular 

among millions of people worldwide. 

In this paper, we build a large-scale 

and high-quality Chinese corpus, 

called CSDC (Chinese Spoken Dia-

logue Corpus). It contains five do-

mains and more than 140 thousand di-

alogues in all. Each sentence in this 

corpus is annotated with slot infor-

mation additionally compared to other 

corpora. To our best knowledge, this is 

the largest Chinese spoken dialogue 

corpus, as well as the first one with 

slot information. With this corpus, we 

proposed a method and did a well-

designed experiment. The indicative 

result is reported at last.   

1 Introduction 

Spoken dialogue system is regarded as the origi-

nal form of the famous Turing test, as well as a 

long goal in artificial intelligence and natural lan-

guage processing field. Though much progress 

has achieved, the research for spoken dialogue in 

specific domains faces many challenges, such as 

query understanding and the response generation 

and so on. Large-scale conversation corpus with 

rich annotation will offer great support to the re-

search. 

With the development of network and commu-

nication technology, there is a vast amount of data 

available documenting human communication. 

Much of them could be used, perhaps after some 

preprocessing, to train a dialogue system. English 

receives much more research attention than any 

other languages. In the last few decades, several 

English conversation corpora have been pub-

lished, such as Carnegie Mellon Communicator 

Corpus (Bennett and Rudnicky,2002), Dialog 

State Tracking Challenge (DSTC) (Williams et 

al.,2013) and DIALOG mathematical proof da-

taset (Wolska et al., 2004). However, little re-

search on other language discourse have been re-

ported, which limits the growing research interest 

in these languages.  

In this paper, we mainly focus on Chinese cor-

pus creation for its wide range of use and its popu-

larity. To overcome this problem, we build a large-

scale corpus of spoken dialogue system, which 

consists of five domains and more than 140 thou-

sand dialogues. To our best knowledge, it is the 

largest scale Chinese spoken dialogue corpus. 

Moreover, different to all other corpora including 

ones in English and any other languages, each 

sentence in our corpus is annotated with rich slot 

information. It is the first corpus annotated with 

this kind of information, which will play a major 

role in building spoken dialogue system. 

The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 

2 introduces some related works on spoken dia-

logue corpus. Section 3 lays out the process of 

corpus construction and the statistics about our 

corpus. Section 4 proposes a method combination

with the constructed corpus and presents the re-

sult. Section 5 gives the conclusions to end the 

paper. 

2  Related word 

In this section, we review some English corpus 

and some related efforts for building Chinese cor-

pus. Since there are many English corpora, we just 

list some examples. 

1) Switchboard dataset (Godfrey et al.,1992)  

One popular corpus is Switchboard dataset 

(Godfrey et al.,1992). It consists of approximately 

2,500 dialogues over the phone from 500 speak-

ers, along with word-by-word transcriptions. 

About 70 casual topics were provided, of which 

about 50 were frequently used. The corpus has 

been used for a wide variety of other tasks, includ-

ing the modeling of dialogue acts such as 

‘statement’, ‘question’, and ‘agreement’ (Stolcke 

et al., 2000). 

2) The Ritel corpus (Rosset and Petel, 2006) 

It is a small dataset of 528 spoken questions 

and answers in a conversational format. The pur-

pose of the project was to integrate spoken lan-

guage dialogue systems with open domain infor-

mation retrieval systems, with the end goal of al-

lowing humans to ask general questions and itera-

tively refine their search. The questions in the 

corpus mostly revolve around politics and the 

economy, along with some conversations about 

arts and science-related topics. 

3) The DIALOG mathematical proof dataset 

(Wolska et al., 2004) 

It is a Wizard-of-Oz dataset involving an auto-

mated tutoring system that attempts to advise stu-

dents on proving mathematical theorems. The 

system is completed by using a hinting algorithm 

that provides clues when students come up with 

an incorrect answer. At only 66 dialogues, the da-

taset is tiny and consists of a conglomeration of 

text-based interactions with the system, as well as 

think-aloud audio and video footage recorded by 

the users as they interacted with the system. 

Chinese corpus is few, and we list two relative-

ly popular ones. 

4) CASIA-CASSIL(Zhou) 

It is a large-scale corpus of Chinese casual tele-

phone conversations in tourism domain. The 

source data is collected from a large number of 

spontaneous telephone recordings up to the pre-

sent. After a strict selection, only a minority of 

dialogs remains, which are with good voice 

quality, enough turns and strictly belong to re-

quired domains. 

5) Lancaster Los Angeles Spoken Chinese 

Corpus (LLSCC) 

It is a corpus of spoken Mandarin Chinese. The 

corpus is composed of 1,002,151 words of dia-

logues and monologs, both spontaneous and 

scripted, in 73,976 sentences and 49,670 utterance 

units (paragraphs). LLSCC has seven sub-corpora, 

Conversations: Telephone Calls Play & Movie 

Transcripts, TV Talk Show Transcripts: Debate 

Transcripts Oral Narratives and Edited Oral Nar-

ratives. 

Both Chinese corpora cannot fulfill the demand 

for Chinese spoken dialogue system research. So 

we built a larger and richer corpus in this paper. 

3 Corpus Creation  

In this section, we describe the steps we took in 

the construction of our corpus.  Figure 1 gives an 

overview of the main workflow of our corpus cre-

ation. We will illustrate the details in the following 

subsections.  

 

Figure 1 Overview of the main workflow of our 

corpus creation 

3.1 Collection 

The source of the corpus is very crucial to deter-

mine the quality of corpus. The dialogue data in a 

specific domain in real life is often combined with 

commercial secrets as well as with peoples’ pri-

vate information. For example, when a person 

books ticket through phone, he/she has to offer 

private information. So it is hard to obtain such 

data from a website or by some free methods.  

That is why there is a little corresponding corpus 

of dialogue in particular domains.

While collecting original data, we are assisted 

by volunteers, who offer the data from their real 

life for research purpose. The data consists of their 

audio data (phone recorders) while they call for 

some service, such as booking restaurant or hotel. 

Since we have got the original data, we then 

employ speech recognition technology to transfer 

audio to text. 

3.2 Data Processing and Annotation 

Since we have the real data, we make two steps fol-

lowing. Firstly, for protecting the privacy right, we 

remove the private information. We used the encod-

ed token to replace any information which may 

release private information such as name, phone 

number and so on.   

Second, after analyzing the data, we find that 

there is much rough data, due to either the error of 

transferring audio to text or meaningless sentences 

caused by the bad habits of oral communication. 

Furthermore, many people are hired as expert 

assisted roles to select high-quality data and make 

the text more formal. 

Slot information is required in specific domains. 

We manually extracted the slot as attachment in-

formation of dialogues.  The slot number is limited 

in one specific area, for example in the domain of 

weather querying there are only two slots, time and 

location. Table 1 gives the example of the final ver-

sion in booking hotel domain. 

 

 

Table 1: dialogue example in booking hotel 

domain. 

The content in braces is the corresponding Eng-

lish version for better understanding. The content in 

brackets is corresponding slots information. 0 

means the slot is empty at present.  In this example, 

the slots are room type, number of rooms, the data 

check in, stay time, customer name and phone 

number. 

3.3 Analysis  

As a result, we have got the final version corpus 

of 5 domains. The detailed statistics are 

summarized in this subsection.  

Table 2 gives the slot distribution in each domain. 

 

 

Table 2: slot distribution in each domain 

We can see that booking hotel domain has the 

most slots. Weather query and top up has only two 

slots. 

Figure 2 gives the dialogue distribution in each 

domain. 

Figure 2: The dialogue distribution in each do-

main 

From Figure 2, we know that booking hotel 

domain has the most dialogues, and weather query 

domain has the least dialogues. This distribution 

relates closely to the slot distribution. 

Figure 3 gives the sentence length distribution 

of each domain.

Figure 3: The sentence length distribution 

From Figure 3, we know that the average 

length of sentences in each domain is similar. 

Figure 4 gives the Dialogue turn distribution in 

each domain. 

 

 

Figure 4: The Dialogue turn distribution 

From Figure 4, we can see booking hotel and 

ordering taxi needs more turns to finish the dia-

logue.  This distribution relates closely to the slot 

distribution. It is easy to understand that more 

slots, more turns required to obtain all infor-

mation. 

Figure 5 gives the word distribution in the 

sentences. 

Figure 5: The word distribution in sentence 

From Figure 5, we know that average length of 

sentences in each domain is similar. 

From the statistics, we can see that the distribu-

tion of our corpus is relatively stable. 

4 Method Based on the Corpus 

Based on the corpus, we develop a model for spo-

ken dialogue research in specific domains. The 

basic idea of the method is to introduce slot in-

formation in the corpus into the sequence-to-

sequence framework. 

After a query is given, the first slot is set as ze-

ro as there is no slot information at the beginning. 

Slot information is extracted at next turn, so the 

slot state is changed by fulfilling the correspond-

ing information. The dialogue system works grad-

ually like this and as a result, finish the dialogue 

when all the slot information received. 

Evaluation metrics for dialogue is still an open 

problem. At present, the popular metric is the 

turns that the model needs to fulfill all the slots 

and finish the process. The experiment result 

shows that combination with the created corpus, it 

requires almost the same turn as used in real life. 

However, there are still many open problems 

worthy researching. 

5 Conclusion 

In this paper, we introduce a high-quality and 

large corpus for spoken dialogue research in spe-

cific domains. The corpus consists of five differ-

ent domains and more than 140 thousand dia-

logues. All the data are created based on real life 

data. As our best knowledge, this is the largest 

Chinese spoken dialogue corpus, as well as the 

first one with rich slot information. We believe 

that the corpus will greatly support the spoken 

dialogue system research.
