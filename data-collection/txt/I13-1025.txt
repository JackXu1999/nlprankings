Abstract
Dialog behavior is affected by power re-
lations among the discourse participants.
We show that four different types of power
relations (hierarchical power, situational
power, influence, and power over commu-
nication) affect written dialog behavior in
different ways. We also present a system
that can identify power relations given a
written dialog.

1 Introduction

The recent increase in online social interactions
has triggered great interest in computationally an-
alyzing such interactions to gain insights about
the discourse participants (DPs). Within the field
of analyzing online interactions, there is a grow-
ing interest in finding how social power relations
between participants are reflected in the various
facets of interactions, and whether the power rela-
tions can be detected using computational means
(Rowe et al., 2007; Bramsen et al., 2011). More
recent work has shown that an analysis of the di-
alog structure (and not just the message content)
helps detecting power relations (Biran et al., 2012;
Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2012).

Understanding the relation between dialog and
power may help in various applications. For ex-
ample, if a dialog system is engineered to behave
appropriately given the user’s expectation of rela-
tive power (for different types of power), then the
user may experience the interaction with the sys-
tem as more natural. Turning to dialog analysis
rather than generation, we can build a computa-
tional system to analyze power relations between
participants in an interaction. Such a system could
have various applications. Power analysis in on-
line forums and communities could be useful in

determining relevance to a user searching the fo-
rum. For example, a user may want to limit his
search to posts authored by the DPs with higher
power. Power analysis may also aid law enforce-
ment agencies to detect leaders and influencers in
suspicious online communities. This is especially
useful since the real identities of the members of
such communities are often not revealed and their
hierarchies may not be available to the law en-
forcement agencies.

The power differential between the DPs may be
based on a multitude of factors such as status, au-
thority, role, knowledge and so on. Early com-
putational approaches to analyzing power in in-
teractions relied solely on static power structures
such as corporate hierarchies as the source of the
power differential (Rowe et al., 2007; Bramsen et
al., 2011). More recent studies have looked into
dynamic notions of power as well, such as influ-
ence (Biran et al., 2012). However, not much work
has been done to understand how different types
of power differ in the ways they affect how people
interact in dialog.

In this paper, we study four different types of
power — hierarchical power, situational power, in-
fluence and power over communication. We in-
vestigate whether all four social power relations
are manifested in dialog behavior; we restrict our
attention to written dialog, specifically email ex-
changed in an American corporation. By “dia-
log behavior”, we mean the choices a DP makes
while engaging in dialog. Dialog behavior in-
cludes choices that affect dialog structure, such as
the choice of when to participate (e.g., does the
DP initiate the dialog?), how much to contribute
(e.g., is the DP terse or loquacious?), what sort of
contribution to make (e.g., which dialog acts does
the DP perform? how does the contribution link

216



to previous dialog contributions?), and what form
the contribution should take (e.g., whether to make
an overt display of power). The main contribu-
tion of this paper is to show that the four types of
power we consider are in fact different from one
another and that they affect the DPs’ behavior in
written dialog in different but predictable ways.
We analyze these manifestations in the language
as well as the dialog structure of interactions. We
also present a system to detect the DPs with one of
these types of power from threaded email interac-
tions.

In Section 2, we discuss related work in the
field. Section 3-4 presents the data, annotations,
and inter-rater agreement studies on the annota-
tions. Section 5 summarizes the dimensions of in-
teractions we analyze. We then present the main
contributions of this paper: Section 6 analyzes the
variations in the manifestations of power among
the four types, and Section 7 describes a system
to predict persons with any of the four types of
power. We then conclude and discuss future work.

2 Related Work

Within the dialog community, researchers have
studied notions of control and initiative in dialogs
(e.g. (Walker and Whittaker, 1990; Jordan and
Di Eugenio, 1997)). Walker and Whittaker (1990)
define “control of communication” in terms of
whether the discourse participants are providing
new, unsolicited information. They use utterance
level rules to determine which discourse partici-
pant (whether the speaker or the hearer) is in con-
trol, and extend it to segments of discourse. Their
notion of control differs from our notion of power
over communication. They model control locally
over discourse segments. What we are interested
in (and what our annotations capture) is the pos-
session of controlling power by one (or more) par-
ticipant(s) across the entire dialog, i.e. how a par-
ticipant controls the communication in a dialog
thread in order to achieve its intended goals. De-
spite this difference in definition, we show in Sec-
tion 6 that our notion of power over communica-
tion correlates with Walker and Whittaker (1990)’s
notion of control over discourse segments. Jordan
and Di Eugenio (1997) suggest that “initiative” ap-
plies to the level of problem solving, just as “con-
trol” applies to the dialog level. We leave the in-
vestigation into the relation between initiative and
situational power for future work.

In social sciences, different typologies of power
have been proposed. Wartenberg (1990) makes
the distinction between power-over and power-to
in the context of interactions. Power-over refers
to relationships between interactants set by exter-
nal power structures, while power-to refers to the
ability an interactant possesses within the interac-
tion, even if it is temporary. Our notions of hi-
erarchical power and influence are special cases
of power-over. Hierarchical power is determined
by organizational hierarchy, while influence is de-
termined by knowledge, expertise etc. Similarly,
our notions of situational power and power over
communication are special cases of power-to. Sit-
uational power applies to the situation or task at
hand, while power over communication applies to
the interaction itself. French and Raven (1959)
proposed five bases of power: Coercive, Reward,
Positional, Referent, and Expert. They are widely
used to study power in sociology. We consider
hierarchical power, situational power and power
over communication to be positional in nature; al-
though the former two can also have bases in co-
ercion and rewards. The bases of influence are
mainly referent and expert power.

Studies in sociolinguistics have also explored
the relation between dialog behavior and social
power. O’Barr (1982) shows that power relations
are manifested in language use in courtroom di-
alogs. Locher (2004) studies politeness in dialogs
in relation to the exercise of power. The corre-
lation between discourse structure and perceived
influence of participants has also been studied (Ng
et al., 1993; Ng et al., 1995). Specifically, factors
such as frequency of contribution, proportion of
turns, and number of successful interruptions have
been identified as important indicators of influence
(Reid and Ng, 2000). This work was done entirely
on spoken dialog. In our work, we show that the
core insight — conversation is a resource for in-
fluence — carries over to written dialog; we also
show that it carries over to other forms of power.
However, some of the characteristics of spoken di-
alog do not carry over directly to written dialog,
most prominently among them the issue of inter-
ruptions: there is no interruption in written dialog.

We now look at various computational ap-
proaches to extract power relations from online
dialogs. Several studies have used Social Net-
work Analysis (e.g., (Rowe et al., 2007)) to ex-
tract social relations from online communication.

217



Researchers have also applied NLP techniques on
message content to detect power relations. Ear-
lier approaches used simple lexical features (e.g.
(Bramsen et al., 2011; Gilbert, 2012)) while later
studies have performed deeper discourse analy-
sis and used features such as linguistic coordina-
tion (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2012), lan-
guage uses such as attempts to persuade and vari-
ous other dialog patterns (Biran et al., 2012). We
present a more detailed discussion of the above
mentioned studies and how they differ from our
line of research in (Prabhakaran et al., 2012c).

Our research also falls into the category of stud-
ies that go beyond pure lexical features and use
dialog structure based features to extract social
power relations. In (Prabhakaran et al., 2012c),
we studied the notion of situational power in depth
and presented a system to detect persons with sit-
uational power using dialog features. In this pa-
per as well, we use the system described in (Prab-
hakaran et al., 2012c). However, this work differs
from (Prabhakaran et al., 2012c) and other studies
described above in that our focus is on how differ-
ent types of power are manifested differently in the
dialog behavior of the participants. We show that
the types of power we consider are in fact differ-
ent and vary in the ways they manifest in dialogs
(Section 6). We also present a system that predicts
different types of power (Section 7), not just hier-
archical or situational power.

3 Data and Annotations

We use the subset of the Enron email corpus with
power annotations presented in Prabhakaran et al.
(2012a) for our experiments. The corpus also con-
tains manual dialog act annotations by Hu et al.
(2009), which enable us to perform the analysis
of how power affects dialog behavior. The corpus
contains 122 email threads with a total of 360 mes-
sages and 20,740 word tokens. There are about 8.5
participants per thread. There are 221 active par-
ticipants (participants of a thread who has sent at
least one email message in the thread) in the cor-
pus. Table 1 presents the counts and percentages
of active participants with each type of power in
the corpus. We now define the four types of power
we investigate in this paper.
Hierarchical Power (HP): We use the gold orga-
nizational hierarchy for Enron released by Agar-
wal et al. (2012) to model hierarchical power. It
contains relations between 1,518 employees, and

Type of power Count Percentage

Hierarchical Power (HP) 18 8.1
Situational Power (SP) 81 36.7
Power over Communication (PC) 127 57.5
Influence (INFL) 11 5.0

Table 1: Annotation statistics

13,724 dominance pairs (pairs of employees such
that the first dominates the second in the hierarchy,
not necessarily immediately). We labeled a partic-
ipant to have hierarchical power within a thread if
there exist a dominance pair in the gold hierarchy
such that he/she dominates any other participant in
the same thread.

For the other three types of power — situational
power, power over communication, and influence,
we utilize the manual annotations present in the
corpus of (Prabhakaran et al., 2012a).1 We labeled
a participant to have one of these types of power
within a thread if he or she was judged to have
that type of power over any other participant in
the same thread. We explain the annotations in de-
tail below with an example thread and correspond-
ing annotations shown in Table 2; the email body
contains dialog act and link annotations in [square
brackets] which will be explained in Section 3.1.
Situational Power (SP): Person1 is said to
have situational power over person2 if person1
has power or authority to direct and/or approve
person2’s actions in the current situation or while
a particular task is being performed, based on the
communication in the current thread. Situational
power is independent of organizational hierarchy:
person1 with situational power may or may not be
above person2 in the organizational hierarchy (or
there may be no organizational hierarchy at all). In
our example thread, our annotator judged Kathryn
to posses situational power over Leslie, Sara and
Brent because Kathryn is following up on and as-
signing a task to others, and because Kathryn uses
language that shows that she is in charge of the
situation.
Power over Communication (PC): A person is
said to have power over communication if he ac-
tively attempts to achieve the intended goals of the
communication.2 These are people who ask ques-
tions, request others to take action, etc., and not

1The manual annotations also capture the perception of
hierarchical power. In this work, we use only the actual gold
hierarchy (Agarwal et al., 2012) as described above.

2In (Prabhakaran et al., 2012a), power over communica-
tion was called “control of communication”.

people who simply respond to questions or per-
form actions when directed to do so. There could
be multiple such participants in a given thread. In
our example thread, no one was judged to have
power over communication since the communica-
tion is broken into two separate interactions of just
one message each — one from Kathryn to every-
one and the other between Brent and Mark.

Influence (INFL): A person is defined to have
influence if she 1) has credibility in the group,
2) persists in attempting to convince others, even
if some disagreement occurs, 3) introduces top-
ics/ideas that others pick up on or support, and 4)
is a group participant but not necessarily active in
the discussion(s) where others support/credit her.
In addition, the influencer’s ideas or language may
be adopted by others and others may explicitly
recognize influencer’s authority. In our example,

our annotator judged Mark to have influence over
Brent since the latter seeks advice from the former
on how to deal with the situation.

3.1 Dialog Act Annotations

The corpus we used contains manual dialog act
annotations as described in Hu et al. (2009). We
use these annotations to model the dialog struc-
ture of the communication thread. For each mes-
sage, Hu et al. (2009) assign a Dialog Act (DA)
label to each segment of text with a coherent com-
municative function. The label could be one of
the following: ReqAction, ReqInfo, Inform, In-
formOffline,3 Conventional, and Commit. In ad-
dition, the segments are linked by three types of
links to reflect the dialog structure. These links
capture the patterns of local alternation between
an initiating dialog act and a responding one. A
forward link (Flink) is the analog of a “first pair-
part” of an adjacency pair, is restricted to ReqInfo
and ReqAction segments. The responses to such
requests are assigned a backward link (Blink). If
an utterance can be interpreted as a response to a
preceding segment, it gets a Blink even where the
preceding segment has no Flink. The preceding
segment taken to be the “first pair-part” of the link
is assigned a secondary forward link (SFlink).

3.2 Overt Display of Power

Our corpus also contains the overt display of
power (ODP) (Prabhakaran et al., 2012b) annota-
tions. An utterance is defined to have an ODP if it
is interpreted as creating additional constraints on
the response beyond those imposed by the general
dialog act. Syntactically, an ODP can be an imper-
ative, a question, or a declarative sentence. In our
example thread, utterance M1.2 is an instance of
ODP. The inter-annotator agreement value (κ) of
ODP annotations was 0.67.

4 Reliability of Annotations

The power annotations in the corpus are per-
formed by a single annotator and capture her per-
ception of the overall power structure among the
participants of the interaction. To verify the relia-
bility of these annotations, we performed an inde-
pendent inter-annotator agreement (IAA) study on
a subset of 47 threads from the corpus. We trained

communication which did not happen in the email thread it-
self. Such cases are marked as Offline.

two annotators — AnnA and AnnB — using
the same annotation manual described in (Prab-
hakaran et al., 2012a) and compared the annota-
tions they produced on the selected threads. Anno-
tators were asked to read the entire thread before
performing the annotations. They are also asked
to provide, in free-form English, a short “power
narrative” which describes their perception of the
overall power structure among the discourse par-
ticipants of that thread. Annotators build a fairly
consistent mental image of a power narrative — an
outline of the power structure between the partic-
ipants — based on various indicators from across
the thread. Their individual power annotations are
based on this power narrative. Hence, the cogni-
tive process behind labeling a participant to have
a particular type of power is not a binary decision
the annotator makes for each participant. How-
ever, evaluating agreement on such a formulation
is not straightforward. Thus, for the purpose of
this IAA study, we port this task into a binary deci-
sion task of identifying whether participant X has
power of type P or not.

There were 289 participants in the selected 47
threads. The κ values obtained for each type of
power is shown in Table 3 under Round 1. Since
the κ values obtained in round 1 were only fair to
moderate, we performed another round of training
and inter annotator study. For this round, AnnB
was not available, and we hired another annotator
AnnC. The κ values obtained between AnnA and
AnnC on another set of 10 threads is presented in
Table 3 under Round 2.

Type of power Round 1 Round 2

Situational Power (SP) 0.47 0.47
Power over Communication (PC) 0.27 0.76
Influence (INFL) 0.50 0.79

Table 3: Inter Rater Agreement (κ)

The κ values obtained in both round 1 and round
2 are in the range of those previously reported for
similar tasks (e.g., 0.18 for managerial influence
and 0.52 for establishing solidarity (Bracewell et
al., 2012); 0.72 for influence (Biran et al., 2012)).
The agreement in round 2 improved considerably
for both PC and INFL after the second round of
training. The issue of moderate agreement for SP
and its possible reasons are discussed in detail in
(Prabhakaran et al., 2012c). For the rest of this
paper, we use the original annotations that were
present in the corpus.

5 Dialog Behavior

We use five sets of features to capture the dia-
log behavior of participants: dialog act percent-
ages (DAP), dialog link counts (DLC), positional
(PST), verbosity (VRB), and overt displays of
power (ODP). The specific features within each
set are listed in Table 4. PST and VRB are readily
derivable from the data, without any annotations.

Set Features
DAP ReqAction, ReqInform, Inform, InformOffline,

Conventional, Commit
DLC Flink, SFlink, Blink, Clink, Dlink, DlinkRatio
PST Initiator, FirstMsg, LastMsg
VRB MsgCount, MsgRatio, TokenCount, TokenRatio,

TokensPerMsg
ODP ODPCount

Table 4: Feature Sets

DAP captures the percentages of each dialog
act labels in each participant’s utterances. DLC
captures the metrics on various kinds of links in
each participant’s messages. Flink, SFlink and
Blink corresponds to counts of respective link an-
notations in participants’ messages. We refer to
Flinks with one or more backward links as con-
nected links (Clink) and those with no matching
Blink as dangling links (Dlink). A dangling link
denotes a request that was ignored. The DlinkRa-
tio is the ratio of Dlinks to Flinks for a partici-
pant. This captures what percentage of a partic-
ipant’s requests went unanswered. PST captures
the positions within the thread where the partici-
pant joined and left the conversation. Initiator is
a binary feature capturing whether the participant
initiated the thread or not. FirstMsg and LastMsg
are real valued features between 0 and 1, captur-
ing the relative position of the first and last mes-
sages by the participant. VRB features are self ex-
planatory. ODP captures the number of instances
of ODP in the messages by each participant.

6 Variations in Manifestations of Power

In this section, we present the results of a statisti-
cal analysis of the dialog features with respect to
people with the four types of power. For each type
of power (HP, SP, INFL and PC), we consider two
populations of people who participated in the di-
alog: P , those judged to have that type of power,
and N , those not judged to have that power. Then,
for each feature, we perform a two-sample, two-
tailed t-test comparing means of feature values of

P and N . Table 5 presents means of each feature
value for both populationsP andN (as “mean(P)|
mean(N )”) along with the p-value associated with
the t-test as the subscript. For p < 0.05, we reject
the null hypothesis and consider the feature to be
statistically significant (boldfaced in Table 5).

We find many features which are statistically
significant, which suggests that power types are
reflected in the dialog structure. The t-test re-
sults also show that significance of features differ
considerably from one type of power to another,
which suggests that different power types are re-
flected differently in the dialog structure, and that
they are thus indeed different types of power.

For HP, we find that people with HP are less ac-
tive in threads than those without. For example,
persons with hierarchical power tend to talk less
within a thread (TokenRatio). They tend to start
participating much later in the threads (FirstMsg)
and do not initiate threads often (Initiator). SP
and PC manifest in stark contrast from HP. Per-
sons with SP and persons with PC both tend to
talk more within a thread (TokenRatio). They also
tend to be the initiators of the thread (Initiator) or
start participating in the thread closer to the begin-
ning (FirstMsg). SP and PC have many other fea-
tures which are also statistically significant. For

example, they send significantly more messages
(MsgCount). They also have significantly more
instances of overt displays of power (ODPCount)
than others. It is interesting to note that ODP-
Count was not a significant feature for HP. It sug-
gests that bosses don’t always display their power
overtly when they interact. SP and PC also dif-
fer from one another. For example, those with SP
tend to request actions (ReqAction) significantly
more than those without. However, this was not
significant in case of PC. Similarly, the number of
back links (Blink) was not a significant feature for
SP. But, people with PC tend to have significantly
fewer back links (Blink) than those without.

This finding — people with PC have fewer
back links — is interesting, since it aligns PC
with the characterization of control by Walker
and Whittaker (1990). According to them, con-
trol over a discourse segment is determined by
whether the participant provide unsolicited infor-
mation in the dialog or not. In the dialog act
annotation scheme we use, solicited information
(in other words, responses to requests and com-
mands) places an obligatory Blink on the corre-
sponding text segment. Hence, the fact that peo-
ple with PC have significantly larger contributions
to the dialog (VRB features), but with fewer back

221



links, suggest that most of their contribution is un-
solicited information. This is in line with Walker
and Whittaker (1990)’s definition of control over
discourse segments.

Although INFL has fewer data points, we found
a few significant features for INFL. People with
INFL never request actions (ReqAction) as op-
posed to those with SP who request actions more
frequently than others. Also, people with INFL
tend to have significantly more inform utterances
(Inform). They also have significantly fewer overt
displays of power (ODPCount) than others, a stark
contrast to those with SP and PC.

The statistical measures presented in previous
section are exploratory in nature, presenting tests
on all combinations of features and power types.
We do not draw theoretical conclusions from the
specific combination of interactions that are found
statistically significant. Hence, we did not apply
any corrections for multiple tests in statistical sig-
nificance for individual features. When we ap-
ply, the Bonferroni correction for multiple tests
to adjust the p-value for number of test performed
(threshold = 0.05|84 = 6.0E-4), 10 features would
still remain statistically significant. Hence the
global null hypothesis that the features we consid-
ered do not interact with the power types would
still be rejected.

7 Predicting Persons with Power

In this section, we present a system to predict
whether a person has a given type of power in the
context of an email thread. We show that differ-
ent sets of features are helpful to detect different
types of power. We build a separate binary clas-
sifier for each power type predicting whether or
not a given participant in a communication thread
has that type of power or not. Since our dataset
is skewed especially for HP & INFL (with very
few persons with power), we balanced our dataset
by up-sampling minority class instances in the
training step. This has proven useful in cases of
unbalanced datasets (Japkowicz, 2000). All re-
sults presented below have been obtained after bal-
ancing the training folds in cross validation; the
test folds remain unchanged. We used the to-
kenizer, POS tagger, lemmatizer and SVMLight
(Joachims, 1999) wrapper in the ClearTK (Ogren
et al., 2008) package. The ClearTK wrapper for
SVMLight internally shifts the prediction thresh-
old based on a posterior probabilistic score calcu-

We first find the best performing subset of fea-
tures for each feature set by exhaustive search
within the set. Once we have the best subset of
each feature set, we do another round of exhaus-
tive search combining best performers of each set
to find the overall best performing feature subset.
We report micro-averaged (P)recision, (R)ecall
and (F)-measure on 5-fold cross validation for
each power type. We experimented with a linear
kernel and a quadratic kernel; the latter performed
better. All results presented in this paper are ob-
tained using a quadratic kernel.

Table 6 shows cross validation results for all

four types of power for each set of features.4 The
corpus was split into folds at the thread level. We
present two simple baseline measures - Random
and AlwaysTrue and a langauge-based baseline,
LEX. In the Random baseline, we predict an ac-
tive participant to have the particular type of power
at random. In AlwaysTrue baseline, we always
predict an active participant to have power. For
LEX, we use only lexical features (unigrams and
bigrams) from messages sent by each participant
to train the SVM model described above. For each
power type, the table also lists (in the last row) the
best performing feature subset combination and
corresponding results.

HP is hard to predict, which could partly be due
to the very small number of positive training ex-
amples in the corpus. For the LEX baseline us-
ing purely word ngrams, the system did not get
any correct predictions. All feature subsets out-
performed the other baselines of 11.3% and 15.0%
(for Random and AlwaysTrue respectively), and a
combination of VRB, PST and ODP gave the best
model obtaining an F measure of 29.5%.

For SP, the best performing individual feature
sets are ODP and DLC, both at or near 60.0%.
While ODP gave a high precision (71.2%) model,
DLC gave a high recall (75.3%) model, the com-
bination of both gave the best performing system
with an F measure of 64.4%.

For PC, the best single feature was FirstMsg
(relative position of first message). This is because
the person with the power over communication is
almost always the initiator of the thread. Note that
the notion of PC is not defined in terms of posi-
tional features: annotators were asked to find the
participants who “actively attempt to achieve the
intended goals of the communication”. It is our
finding that those who are in PC were also the ones
who did initiate the thread. It is also worth noting
that ODP is the worst performer for PC which is in
contrast with the case of SP, supporting the claim
that these two types of power are in fact different.

INFL is another very hard class to predict,
again, possibly partly due to the very small num-
ber of positive training examples. The simple
baseline F measures were both 9.5, while the LEX
did not produce any correct predictions at all. All
feature sets except PST outperformed these base-
line measures. The best performance was obtained

by DLC with counts of Blinks, Flinks, Dlinks and
SFlinks as features.

For assessing statistical significance of F mea-
sure improvements over baseline, we used the Ap-
proximate Randomness Test (Yeh, 2000). We
found the improvements to be statistically signifi-
cant for SP (p = 0.001), HP (p=0.001) and PC (p =
0.01) with a threshold for significance at p = 0.05.
However, for INFL, the improvement was not sta-
tistically significant (p = 0.3). The statistical sig-
nificance of SP, HP and PC would hold even after
applying Bonferroni correction for multiple tests.

8 Conclusion and Future Work

We studied four types of power between partici-
pants of written dialog. We have shown that these
types of power are manifested very differently
with respect to the features we are using, which
validates our claim that these are indeed different
types of power. We also presented a supervised
learning system to predict persons with one of the
types of power in written dialog yielding encour-
aging results. We have shown that dialog features
are very significant in predicting power relations
in online written communication.

In future work, we intend to try predicting
power relations between pairs of participants. It
would be interesting to see how dialog features
correlate with the other direction of power; that
is from a submitter to an exerciser of power. We
will investigate the use of additional features re-
lated to the dialog participants, such as gender. We
will also investigate using a dialog act tagger, link
predictor and an ODP tagger to build a fully au-
tomatic power predicting system. We would also
like to extend this work to other genres of written
communication like discussion forums and blogs.
