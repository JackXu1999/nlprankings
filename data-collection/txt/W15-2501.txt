Abstract
We describe the design, the evaluation
setup, and the results of the DiscoMT 2015
shared task, which included two sub-
tasks, relevant to both the machine trans-
lation (MT) and the discourse communit-
ies: (i) pronoun-focused translation, a prac-
tical MT task, and (ii) cross-lingual pro-
noun prediction, a classification task that
requires no specific MT expertise and is
interesting as a machine learning task in
its own right. We focused on the Eng-
lish–French language pair, for which MT
output is generally of high quality, but has
visible issues with pronoun translation due
to differences in the pronoun systems of
the two languages. Six groups participated
in the pronoun-focused translation task and
eight groups in the cross-lingual pronoun
prediction task.

1 Introduction

Until just a few years ago, there was little aware-
ness of discourse-level linguistic features in stat-
istical machine translation (SMT) research. Since
then, a number of groups have started working on
discourse-related topics, and today there is a fairly
active community that convened for the first time
at the Workshop on Discourse in Machine Trans-
lation (DiscoMT) at the ACL 2013 conference in
Sofia (Bulgaria). This year sees a second DiscoMT
workshop taking place at EMNLP 2015 in Lisbon
(Portugal), and we felt that the time was ripe to
make a coordinated effort towards establishing the
state of the art for an important discourse-related
issue in machine translation (MT), the translation
of pronouns.

Organizing a shared task involves clearly de-
fining the problem, then creating suitable datasets
and evaluation methodologies. Having such a setup
makes it possible to explore a variety of approaches
for solving the problem at hand since the particip-
ating groups independently come up with various
ways to address it. All of this is highly beneficial
for continued research as it creates a well-defined
benchmark with a low entry barrier, a set of res-
ults to compare to, and a collection of properly
evaluated ideas to start from.

We decided to base this shared task on the prob-
lem of pronoun translation. Historically, this was
one of the first discourse problems to be considered
in the context of SMT (Le Nagard and Koehn,
2010; Hardmeier and Federico, 2010); yet, it is
still far from being solved. For an overview of the
existing work on pronoun translation, we refer the
reader to Hardmeier (2014, Section 2.3.1). The typ-
ical case is an anaphoric pronoun – one that refers
to an entity mentioned earlier in the discourse, its
antecedent. Many languages have agreement con-
straints between pronouns and their antecedents.
In translation, these constraints must be satisfied
in the target language. Note that source language
information is not enough for this task. To see
why, consider the following example for English–
French:1

The funeral of the Queen Mother will
take place on Friday. It will be broadcast
live.

Les funérailles de la reine-mère auront
lieu vendredi. Elles seront retransmises
en direct.

1The example is taken from Hardmeier (2014, 92).

1



Here, the English antecedent, the funeral of the
Queen Mother, requires a singular form for the
anaphoric pronoun it. The French translation of
the antecedent, les funérailles de la reine-mère, is
feminine plural, so the corresponding anaphoric
pronoun, elles, must be a feminine plural form
too. Note that the translator could have chosen to
translate the word funeral with the French word
enterrement ‘burial’ instead:

L’enterrement de la reine-mère aura lieu
vendredi. Il sera retransmis en direct.

This time, the antecedent noun phrase (NP) is mas-
culine singular and thus requires a masculine sin-
gular anaphoric pronoun and singular verb forms.
Therefore, correctly translating anaphoric pronouns
requires knowledge about a pronoun’s antecedent
and its translation in the target language.

Early SMT research on pronoun translation fo-
cused exclusively on agreement in the target lan-
guage (Le Nagard and Koehn, 2010; Hardmeier
and Federico, 2010). While this is one of the main
issues with pronoun translation, it soon became
clear that there were other factors as well. On the
one hand, the same source language pronoun can
have both anaphoric and non-anaphoric functions,
with different constraints. On the other hand, ana-
phoric reference can be realized through different
types of referring expressions, including personal
pronouns, demonstrative pronouns, zero pronouns,
full noun phrases, etc., with different languages ex-
ploiting these means in different ways. The precise
mechanisms underlying these processes in various
language pairs are not well understood, but it is
easy to see that pronoun translation is not a trivial
problem, e.g., by noting that the number of pro-
nouns on the source and on the target side of the
same parallel text may differ by up to 40 % (Mitkov
and Barbu, 2003).

2 Task Description

The shared task had two subtasks. The first subtask,
pronoun-focused translation, required full transla-
tion of texts from one language into another with
special attention paid to the translation of pronouns.
The second, cross-lingual pronoun prediction, was
a classification task requiring only the generation of
pronouns in the context of an existing translation.
Its purpose was to lower the entrance barrier by
allowing the participants to focus on the actual pro-
noun translation problem without having to worry
about the complexities of full MT.

Experiments on discourse-related aspects of MT
are unlikely to be successful unless a strong MT
baseline is used. Also, evaluation is much easier
if there are clear, relevant, measurable contrasts in
the translation task under consideration (Hardmeier,
2012). For the DiscoMT shared task, we chose to
study translation from English into French because
this language pair is known from other evaluations
such as WMT or IWSLT to have good baseline per-
formance. Also, there are interesting differences in
the pronoun systems of the two languages. French
pronouns agree with the grammatical gender of
their antecedent in both singular and plural. In Eng-
lish, the singular pronouns he and she agree with
the natural gender of the referent of the antecedent,
and the pronoun it is used with antecedents lack-
ing natural gender; the plural pronoun they is not
marked for gender at all.

The text type, or “domain”, considered in the
shared task is that of public lectures delivered at
TED conferences. This choice was motivated by
the ready availability of suitable training data in the
WIT3 corpus (Cettolo et al., 2012), together with
the fact that this text type is relatively rich in pro-
nouns compared to other genres such as newswire
(Hardmeier et al., 2013b).

In the pronoun-focused translation task, parti-
cipants were given a collection of English input
documents, which they were asked to translate into
French. As such, the task was identical to other MT
shared tasks such as those of the WMT or IWSLT
workshops. However, the evaluation of our shared
task did not focus on general translation quality, but
specifically on the correctness of the French trans-
lations of the English pronouns it and they. Since
measuring pronoun correctness in the context of
an actual translation is a very difficult problem in
itself, the evaluation of this task was carried out
manually for a sample of the test data.

The cross-lingual pronoun prediction task was a
gap-filling exercise very similar to the classification
problem considered by Hardmeier et al. (2013b).
Participants were given the English source text of
the test set along with a full reference translation
created by human translators. In the reference trans-
lations, the French translations of the English pro-
nouns it and they were substituted with placehold-
ers. For each of these placeholders, the participants
were asked to predict a correct pronoun from a
small set of nine classes (see Table 1), given the
context of the reference translation.

The evaluation for the cross-lingual pronoun pre-
diction task was fully automatic, comparing the
predictions made by the participating systems with
the translations actually found in the reference.

3 Datasets

As already noted, the corpus data used in the Dis-
coMT shared task comes from the TED talks. In
the following, the datasets are briefly described.

3.1 Data Sources

TED is a non-profit organization that “invites the
world’s most fascinating thinkers and doers [...] to
give the talk of their lives”. Its website2 makes the
audio and video of TED talks available under the
Creative Commons license. All talks are presen-
ted and captioned in English, and translated by
volunteers world-wide into many languages. In
addition to the availability of (audio) recordings,
transcriptions and translations, TED talks pose in-
teresting research challenges from the perspective
of both speech recognition and machine transla-
tion. Therefore, both research communities are
making increased use of them in building bench-
marks. TED talks address topics of general interest
and are delivered to a live public audience whose
responses are also audible on the recordings.3 The
talks generally aim to be persuasive and to change
the viewers’ behaviour or beliefs. The genre of the
TED talks is transcribed planned speech.

resources for the shared task.

Table 2 provides statistics about the in-domain
tokenized bitexts we supplied for training, develop-
ment and evaluation purposes.

Note that TED talks differ from other text types
with respect to pronoun use. TED speakers fre-
quently use first- and second-person pronouns (sin-
gular and plural): first-person pronouns to refer to
themselves and their colleagues or to themselves
and the audience, and second-person pronouns to
refer to the audience, to the larger set of viewers, or
to people in general. Moreover, they often use the
pronoun they without a specific textual antecedent,
in phrases such as “This is what they think”, as
well as deictic and third-person pronouns to refer
to things in the spatio-temporal context shared by
the speaker and the audience, such as props and
slides. In general, pronouns are abundant in TED
talks, and anaphoric references are not always very
clearly defined.

3.2 Selection Criteria
The training and the development datasets for our
tasks come from the English-French MT task of
the IWSLT 2014 evaluation campaign (Cettolo et
al., 2014). The test dataset for our shared task,
named DiscoMT.tst2015, has been compiled from
new talks added recently to the TED repository that
satisfy the following requirements:

1. The talks have been transcribed (in English)
and translated into French.

2. They were not included in the training, de-
velopment, and test datasets of any IWSLT
evaluation campaign, so DiscoMT.tst2015 can
be used as held-out data with respect to those.

3. They contain a sufficient number of tokens
of the English pronouns it and they translated
into the French pronouns listed in Table 1.

4. They amount to a total number of words suit-
able for evaluation purposes (e.g., tens of thou-
sands).

3



To meet requirement 3, we selected talks for
which the combined count of the rarer classes ça,
cela, elle, elles and on was high. The resulting
distribution of pronoun classes, according to the
extraction procedure described in Section 5.1, can
be found in Table 8 further below.

We aimed to have at least one pair of talks given
by the same speaker and at least one pair translated
by the same translator. These two features are not
required by the DiscoMT shared task, but could be
useful for further linguistic analysis, such as the
influence of speakers and translators on the use of
pronouns. Talks 1756 and 1894 were presented by
the same speaker, and talks 205, 1819 and 1825
were translated by the same translator.

Once the talks satisfying the selection criteria
were found, they were automatically aligned at the
segment level and then manually checked in order
to fix potential errors due to either automatic or
human processing. Table 3 shows some statistics
and metadata about the TED talks that are part of
the DiscoMT.tst2015 set.

4 Pronoun-Focused Translation

4.1 Baseline System
For comparison purposes and to lower the entry
barrier for the participants, we provided a baseline
system based on a phrase-based SMT model. The
baseline system was trained on all parallel and
monolingual datasets provided for the DiscoMT
shared task, namely aligned TED talks from the
WIT3 project (Cettolo et al., 2012), as well as Euro-
parl version 7 (Koehn, 2005), News Commentary
version 9 and the shuffled news data from WMT
2007–2013 (Bojar et al., 2014).

The parallel data were taken from OPUS
(Tiedemann, 2012), which provides sentence-
aligned corpora with annotation. The latter is
useful for finding document boundaries, which
can be important when working with discourse-
aware translation models. All training data were
pre-processed with standard tools from the Moses
toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007), and the final datasets
were lower-cased and normalized (punctuation was
unified, and non-printing characters were removed).
The pre-processing pipeline was made available on
the workshop website in order to ensure compatib-
ility between the submitted systems.

The parallel data were prepared for word align-
ment using the cleaning script provided by Moses,
with 100 tokens as the maximum sentence length.
The indexes of the retained lines were saved to
make it possible to map sentences back to the an-
notated corpora. The final parallel corpus contained
2.4 million sentence pairs with 63.6 million words
in English and 70.0 million words in French. We
word-aligned the data using fast_align (Dyer et al.,
2013) and we symmetrized the word alignments us-
ing the grow-diag-final-and heuristics. The phrase
tables were extracted from the word-aligned bi-
text using Moses with standard settings. We also
filtered the resulting phrase table using significance
testing (Johnson et al., 2007) with the recommen-
ded filter values and parameters. The phrase table
was provided in raw and binary formats to make it
easy to integrate it in other systems.

For the language model, we used all monolingual
datasets and the French parts of the parallel datasets
and trained a 5-gram language model with modified
Kneser-Ney smoothing using KenLM (Heafield et
al., 2013). We provided the language model in
ARPA format and in binary format using a trie data
structure with quantization and pointer compres-
sion.

The SMT model was tuned on the IWSLT 2010
development data and IWSLT 2011 test data using
200-best lists and MERT (Och, 2003). The res-
ulting baseline system achieved reasonably good
scores on the IWSLT 2010 and 2012 test datasets
(Table 4).

IWSLT 2012 40.06 (BP=0.959)

chine translation: case-insensitive BLEU scores.

We experimented with additional datasets and
other settings (GIZA++ instead of fast_align, un-
filtered phrase tables), but could not improve.

All datasets, models and parameters were made
available on the shared task website to make it
easy to get started with new developments and to
compare results with the provided baseline. For
completeness, we also provided a recasing model
that was trained on the same dataset to render it
straightforward to produce case-sensitive output,
which we required as the final submission.

4.2 Submitted Systems

We received six submissions to the pronoun-
focused translation task, and there are system de-
scriptions for five of them. Four submissions were
phrase-based SMT systems, three of which were
based on the baseline described in Section 4.1. One
was a rule-based MT system using a completely
different approach to machine translation.

The IDIAP (Luong et al., 2015) and the AUTO-
POSTEDIT (Guillou, 2015) submissions were
phrase-based, built using the same training and tun-
ing resources and methods as the official baseline.
Both adopted a two-pass approach involving an
automatic post-editing step to correct the pronoun
translations output by the baseline system, and both
of them relied on the Stanford anaphora resolution
software (Lee et al., 2011). They differed in the
way the correct pronoun was assigned: the IDIAP
submission used a classifier with features that in-
cluded properties of the hypothesized antecedent
together with the output of the baseline system,
whereas the AUTO-POSTEDIT system followed a
simpler rule-based decision procedure.

The UU-TIEDEMANN system (Tiedemann, 2015)
was another phrase-based SMT system extending
the official baseline. In contrast to the other sub-
missions, it made no attempt to resolve pronominal
anaphora explicitly. Instead, it used the Docent
document-level decoder (Hardmeier et al., 2013a)
with a cross-sentence n-gram model over determ-
iners and pronouns to bias the SMT model towards
selecting correct pronouns.

The UU-HARDMEIER system (Hardmeier, 2015)
was yet another phrase-based SMT using Docent,
but built on a different baseline configuration. It
included a neural network classifier for pronoun
prediction trained with latent anaphora resolution
(Hardmeier et al., 2013b), but using the Stanford
coreference resolution software at test time.

ITS2 (Loáiciga and Wehrli, 2015) was a rule-
based machine translation system using syntax-
based transfer. For the shared task, it was extended
with an anaphora resolution component influenced
by Binding Theory (Chomsky, 1981).

For the sixth submission, A3-108, no system
description paper was submitted. Its output seemed
to have been affected by problems at the basic MT
level, yielding very bad translation quality.

4.3 Evaluation Methods

Evaluating machine translations for pronoun cor-
rectness automatically is difficult because standard
assumptions fail. In particular, it is incorrect to
assume that a pronoun is translated correctly if it
matches the reference translation. If the translation
of an anaphoric pronoun is itself a pronoun, it has
to agree with the translation of its antecedent, and
a translation deviating from the reference may be
the only correct solution in some cases (Hardmeier,
2014, 92). Doing this evaluation correctly would
require a working solution to the cross-lingual pro-
noun prediction task, the second challenge of our
shared task. Given the current state of the art, we
have little choice but to do manual evaluation.4

Our evaluation methodology is based on the gap-
filling annotation procedure introduced by Hard-
meier (2014, Section 9.4). We employed two annot-
ators, both of whom were professional translators,
native speakers of Swedish with good command of
French. Tokens were presented to the annotators
in the form of examples corresponding to a single
occurrence of the English pronouns it or they. For
each example, the sentence containing the pronoun
was shown to the annotator along with its machine
translation (but not the reference translation) and
up to 5 sentences of context in both languages. In
the MT output, any French pronouns aligned to
the pronoun to be annotated were replaced with
a placeholder. The annotators were then asked to
replace the placeholder with an item selected from
a list of pronouns that was based on the classes of
the cross-lingual pronoun prediction task (Table 1).

Compared to the perhaps more obvious meth-
odology of having the annotators judge examples
as good or bad, treating evaluation as a gap-filling
task has the advantage of avoiding a bias in favour
of solutions generated by the evaluated systems.

4While discourse-aware MT evaluation metrics were pro-
posed recently (Guzmán et al., 2014b; Joty et al., 2014;
Guzmán et al., 2014a), they do not specifically focus on pro-
noun translation.

Guidelines
For each example, you are presented with up to 5 sentences of English source text and a corresponding French machine translation. In the
last sentence, an English pronoun is marked up in red, and (in most cases) the French translation contains a red placeholder for a pronoun.
You are asked to select a pronoun that fits in the context.

Please select the pronoun that should be inserted in the French text instead of the placeholder XXX to create the most fluent
translation possible while preserving the meaning of the English sentence as much as possible.
If different, equally grammatical completions are available, select the appropriate checkboxes and click on "Multiple options
possible". The buttons "il/ce" and "ça/cela" are special shortcuts for cases where these two options are possible.
Select "Other" if the sentence should be completed with a pronoun not included in the list.
Select "Bad translation" if there is no way to create a grammatical and faithful translation without making major changes to the
surrounding text.
Select "Discussion required" if an example should be taken up for discussion.
Minor disfluencies (e.g., incorrect verb agreement or obviously missing words) can be ignored. For instance, if the placeholder should
be replaced with the words c'est, just select "ce".
You should always try to select the pronoun that best agrees with the antecedent in the machine translation, even if the antecedent is
translated incorrectly, and even if this forces you to violate the pronoun's agreement with the immediately surrounding words such as
verbs, adjectives or participles. So if the antecedent requires a plural form, but the placeholder occurs with a singular verb, you should
select the correct plural pronoun and ignore the agreement error.
If the French translation doesn't contain a placeholder, you should check if a pronoun corresponding to the one marked up in the
English source should be inserted somewhere and indicate which if so.
If the French translation doesn't contain a placeholder, but it already includes the correct pronoun (usually an object pronoun like le,
la or les), you should annotate the example as if there had been a placeholder instead of the pronoun (i.e., click on "Other" in the case
of an object pronoun).

Decision help for difficult cases

Always remember that the goal of the annotation is to create a standard to evaluate a machine translation system by.

Figure 1: The web interface used for annotation.

This is particularly relevant when the overall
quality of the translations is imperfect and the eval-
uators might be tempted to accept the existing solu-
tion if it looks remotely plausible. Moreover, this
form of annotation creates a dataset of correct pro-
noun translations in the context of MT output that
can be used in future work and that would be very
difficult to obtain otherwise.

In the annotation interface, the pronouns ça and
cela were merged into a single class because the
annotators found themselves unable to make a con-
sistent and principled distinction between the two
pronouns, and the grammar books we consulted
(Grevisse and Goosse, 1993; Boysen, 1996) did not
offer enough guidance to create reliable guidelines.
Moreover, the annotation interface allowed the an-
notators to select BAD TRANSLATION if the MT
output was not sufficiently well-formed to be annot-
ated with a pronoun. However, they were instructed
to be tolerant of ill-formed translations and to use
the label BAD TRANSLATION only if it was neces-
sary to make more than two modifications to the
sentence, in addition to filling in the placeholder,
to make the output locally grammatical.

In earlier work, Hardmeier (2014) reported an
annotation speed of about 60 examples per hour.
While our annotators approached that figure after
completed training, the average speed over the en-
tire annotation period was about one third lower
in this work, mostly because it proved to be more
difficult than anticipated to settle on a consistent
set of guidelines and reach an acceptable level of
inter-annotator agreement.

We believe there are two reasons for this. On the
one hand, the MT output came from a number of
systems of widely varying quality, while previous
work considered different variants of a single sys-
tem. Achieving consistent annotation turned out to
be considerably more difficult for the lower-quality
systems. On the other hand, unlike the annotators
used by Hardmeier (2014), ours had a linguistic
background as translators, but not in MT. This is
probably an advantage as far as unbiased annota-
tions are concerned, but it may have increased the
initial time to get used to the task and its purpose.

We computed inter-annotator agreement in terms
of Krippendorff’s α (Krippendorff, 2004) and
Scott’s π (Scott, 1955), using the NLTK toolkit
(Bird et al., 2009), over 28 examples annotated by
the two annotators. After two rounds of discus-
sion and evaluation, we reached an agreement of
α = 0.561 and π = 0.574. These agreement fig-
ures are lower than those reported by Hardmeier
(2014, 149), which we believe is mostly due to the
factors discussed above. Some of the disagreement
also seems to stem from the annotators’ different
propensity to annotate examples with demonstrat-
ive pronouns. This point was addressed in discus-
sions with the annotators, but we did not have time
for another round of formal annotator training and
agreement evaluation. We do not believe this had a
major negative effect on the MT evaluation quality
since, in most cases where the annotators disagreed
about whether to annotate ça/cela, the alternative
personal pronoun would be annotated consistently
if a personal pronoun was acceptable.

6



In case of insurmountable difficulties, the annot-
ators had the option to mark an example with the
label DISCUSSION REQUIRED. Such cases were
resolved at the end of the annotation process.

In total, we annotated 210 examples for each of
the six submitted systems as well as for the official
baseline system. The examples were paired across
all systems, so the same set of English pronouns
was annotated for each system. In addition, the
sample was stratified to ensure that all pronoun
types were represented adequately. The stratific-
ation was performed by looking at the pronouns
aligned to the English pronouns in the reference
translation and separately selecting a sample of
each pronoun class (according to Table 1) in pro-
portion to its relative frequency in the complete test
set. When rounding the individual sample sizes
to integer values, we gave slight preference to the
rarer classes by rounding the sample sizes upwards
for the less frequent and downwards for the more
frequent classes.

After completing the human evaluation, we cal-
culated a set of evaluation scores by counting how
often the output of a particular system matched the
manual annotation specific to that system. This
is straightforward for the annotation labels cor-
responding to actual pronouns (ce, ça/cela, elle,
elles, il, ils and on). The examples labelled as BAD
TRANSLATION were counted as incorrect. The
label OTHER leads to complications because this
label lumps together many different cases such as
the use of a pronoun not available as an explicit la-
bel, the complete absence of a pronoun translation
on the target side, the translation of a pronoun with
a full noun phrase or other linguistic construct, etc.
As a result, even if the MT output of an example
annotated as OTHER contains a translation that is
compatible with this annotation, we cannot be sure
that it is in fact correct. This must be kept in mind
when interpreting aggregate metrics based on our
annotations.

The evaluation scores based on manual annota-
tions are defined as follows:

Accuracy with OTHER (Acc+O) Our primary
evaluation score is accuracy over all 210 ex-
amples, i.e., the proportion of examples for
which the pronouns in the MT output are com-
patible with those in the manual annotation.
We include items labelled OTHER and count
them as correct if the MT output contains any
realisation compatible with that label.

Accuracy without OTHER (Acc–O) This is
an accuracy score computed only over those
examples that are not labelled OTHER, so it
does not suffer from the problem described
above. However, the set of examples annot-
ated as OTHER differs between systems, which
could in theory be exploited by a system to in-
crease its score artificially, e.g., by predicting
OTHER for all hard cases. In practice, it is very
unlikely that this happened in this evaluation
since details about the evaluation modalities
were not known to the participants at submis-
sion time.

Pronoun-specific Fmax-score To permit a
more fine-grained interpretation of the eval-
uation results, we also computed individual
precision, recall and F-score values for each of
the pronoun labels available to the annotators
(excluding OTHER and BAD TRANSLATION).
Since multiple correct choices are possible for
each example, an example need not (and can-
not) match each of the annotated pronouns to
be correct. To account for this, we operate
with a non-standard definition of recall, which
we call Rmax because it can be interpreted as
a sort of upper bound on the “intuitive” no-
tion of recall. Rmax for a given type of pro-
noun counts as matches all correct examples
labelled with a given pronoun type, even if the
actual pronoun used is different. To illustrate,
suppose an example is annotated with il and
ce, and the MT output has ce. This example
would be counted as a hit for the Rmax of both
pronoun types, il and ce. The Fmax score in
Table 6 is the harmonic mean of standard pre-
cision and Rmax.

Pron-F The fine-grained precision and recall
scores give rise to another aggregate measure,
labelled Pron-F in Table 6, which is an F-score
based on the micro-averaged precision and
recall values of all pronoun types.

In addition to the above manual evaluation
scores, we also computed automatic scores
(Table 5). This includes the pronoun preci-
sion/recall scores as defined by Hardmeier and
Federico (2010), as well as four standard MT evalu-
ation metrics: BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), NIST
(Doddington, 2002), TER (Snover et al., 2006), and
METEOR (Denkowski and Lavie, 2011).

4.4 Evaluation Results

The standard automatic MT evaluation scores
(BLEU, NIST, TER, METEOR; Table 5) do not of-
fer specific insights about pronoun translation, but
it is still useful to consider them first for an easy
overview over the submitted systems. They clearly
reveal a group of systems (IDIAP, UU-TIEDEMANN
and AUTO-POSTEDIT) built with the data of the
official BASELINE system, with very similar scores
ranging between 36.4 and 37.2 BLEU points. The
baseline itself achieves the best scores, but consid-
ering the inadequacy of BLEU for pronoun evalu-
ation, we do not see this as a major concern in itself.
The other submissions fall behind in terms of auto-
matic MT metrics. The UU-HARDMEIER system is
similar to the other SMT systems, but uses different
language and translation models, which evidently
do not yield the same level of raw MT perform-
ance as the baseline system. ITS2 is a rule-based
system. Since it is well known that n-gram-based
evaluation metrics do not always do full justice
to rule-based MT approaches not using n-gram
language models (Callison-Burch et al., 2006), it
is difficult to draw definite conclusions from this
system’s lower scores. Finally, the extremely low
scores for the A3-108 system indicate serious prob-
lems with translation quality, an impression that we
easily confirmed by examining the system output.

The results for the manual evaluation are shown
in Table 6: we show aggregate scores such as ac-
curacy, with and without OTHER, as well as Fmax
scores for the individual pronouns. We have chosen
Acc+O to be the primary metric because it is well
defined as it is calculated on the same instances
for all participating systems, so it cannot be eas-
ily exploited by manipulating the system output in
clever ways. It turns out, however, that the rankings
of our participating systems induced by this score
and the Acc–O score are exactly identical. In both
cases, the BASELINE system leads, followed relat-
ively closely by IDIAP and UU-TIEDEMANN. Then,
UU-HARDMEIER and AUTO-POSTEDIT follow at a
slightly larger distance, and finally A3-108 scores
at the bottom. The micro-averaged Pron-F score
would have yielded the same ranking as well, ex-
cept for the first two systems, where IDIAP would
have taken the lead from the BASELINE. This is
due to the fact that the IDIAP system has a higher
number of examples labelled BAD TRANSLATION,
while maintaining the same performance as the
baseline for the examples with acceptable transla-
tions. Rather than implying much about the quality
of the systems, this observation confirms and jus-
tifies our decision to choose a primary score that
is not susceptible to effects arising from excluded
classes.

8



The low scores for the ITS2 system were partly
due to a design decision. The anaphora prediction
component of ITS2 only generated the personal
pronouns il, elle, ils and elles; this led to zero recall
for ce and ça/cela and, as a consequence, to a large
number of misses that would have been comparat-
ively easy to predict with an n-gram model.

There does not seem to be a correlation between
pronoun translation quality and the choice of (a) a
two-pass approach with automatic post-editing
(IDIAP, AUTO-POSTEDIT) or (b) a single-pass
SMT system with some form of integrated pro-
noun model (UU-TIEDEMANN, UU-HARDMEIER).
Also, at the level of performance that current sys-
tems achieve, there does not seem to be an inher-
ent advantage or disadvantage in doing explicit
anaphora resolution (as IDIAP, UU-HARDMEIER,
AUTO-POSTEDIT and ITS2 did) as opposed to
considering unstructured context only (as in UU-
TIEDEMANN and the BASELINE).

One conclusion that is supported by relatively
ample evidence in the results concerns the import-
ance of the n-gram language model. The BASELINE
system, which only relies on n-gram modelling
to choose the pronouns, achieved scores higher
than those of all competing systems. Moreover,
even among the submitted systems that included
some form of pronoun model, those that relied
most on the standard SMT models performed best.
For example, the IDIAP submission exploited the
SMT decoder’s translation hypotheses by parsing
the search graph, and UU-TIEDEMANN extended
the baseline configuration with additional n-gram-
style models. By contrast, those systems that act-
ively overrode the choices of the baseline n-gram
model (UU-HARDMEIER and AUTO-POSTEDIT)
performed much worse.

Based on these somewhat depressing results, one
might be tempted to conclude that all comparison
between the submitted systems is meaningless be-
cause all they managed to accomplish was to “dis-
figure” the output of a working baseline system to
various degrees. Yet, we should point out that it
was possible for some systems to outperform the
baseline at least for some of the rarer pronouns. In
particular, the IDIAP system beat the baseline on
4 out of 6 pronoun types, including the feminine
plural pronoun elles, and the UU-TIEDEMANN sys-
tem performed better on both types of feminine
pronouns, elle and elles. Results like these suggest
that all hope is not lost.

5 Cross-Lingual Pronoun Prediction

5.1 Data Preparation

For the second task, cross-lingual pronoun transla-
tion, we used the same bitext as for the MT baseline
in the first task (Section 4.1); we pre-processed it
like before, except for lowercasing. Then, we gen-
erated the following two resources: (i) a bitext
with target pronouns identified and their transla-
tions removed, and (ii) word alignments between
the source and the target sentences in the bitext.

Since the word alignments in the training and
in the testing datasets were created automatic-
ally, without manual inspection, we performed a
small study in order to investigate which align-
ment method performed best for pronouns. We
followed the methodology in Stymne et al. (2014),
by aligning English–French data using all IBM
models (Brown et al., 1993) and the HMM model
(Vogel et al., 1996) as implemented in GIZA++
(Och and Ney, 2003), as well as fast_align (Dyer
et al., 2013), with a number of different symmet-
rization methods. IBM models 1, 2 and 3 yielded
subpar results, so we will not discuss them.

To evaluate the alignments, we used 484 gold-
aligned sentences from Och and Ney (2000).5 We
used the F-score of correct sure and possible links
(Fraser and Marcu, 2007) for a general evaluation,
which we will call Fall.6 In order to specifically
evaluate pronoun alignment, we used the F-score
of the subset of links that align the two sets of pro-
nouns we are interested in, Fpro. For all alignment
models, grow-diag-final-and symmetrization per-
formed best on the pronoun metric, followed by
grow-diag and intersection, which also performed
best for general alignments.

Table 7 shows the results for different models
with grow-diag-final-and symmetrization. We can
see that, for all three models, the results on pronoun
links are better than those on all links. Moreover,
IBM model 4 and HMM are better than fast_align
both for general alignments and for pronoun align-
ments. In the final system, we chose to use IBM
model 4 since it finds slightly more possible links
than HMM. Overall, we find the results very good.
In the best system, all pronoun links except for one
possible link were found, and there are only four
pronoun links that are not in the gold standard.

Table 7: F-score for all alignment links (Fall), and
for pronoun links (Fpro), for different alignment
models with grow-diag-final-and symmetrization.

Ultimately, we applied GIZA++ with grow-diag-
final-and symmetrization and we used fast_align as
a backoff alignment method for the cases that could
not be handled by GIZA++ (sentences longer than
100 tokens and sentence pairs with unusual length
ratios). This was necessary in order to align the
full bitext without missing any sentence pair in the
discourse, as all sentences may contain valuable
information for the classifier.

We developed a script that takes the word-
aligned bitext and replaces the tokens that are
aligned with the English target pronouns it and they
with placeholders, keeping the information about
the substitutions for training and evaluation pur-
poses. Note that the substitutions are always single
words. Pronouns corresponding to one of the target
classes were preferred among the aligned tokens. If
none of the tokens matched any of the classes, we
kept the shortest aligned word as the substitution
and set the class to OTHER. We marked the un-
aligned words with the substitution string “NONE”.
Figure 2 shows two examples of training instances
that we created.

The final data contains five TAB-separated
columns for each aligned segment pair from the
bitext: (1) the classes to be predicted in the same
order as they appear in the text (may be empty),
(2) the actual tokens that have been substituted,
(3) the source language segment, (4) the target lan-
guage segment with placeholders, and (5) the word
alignment. The placeholders have the format RE-
PLACE_XX where XX refers to the index (start-
ing with 0) of the English token that is aligned
to the placeholder. We normalized instances of
c’ and ca to ce and ça, respectively. The substi-
tuted tokens are case-sensitive and the class OTHER
also includes empty alignments. For the latter, we
developed a strategy that inserts placeholders at a
reasonable position into the target language seg-
ment by looking at the alignment positions of the
surrounding words of the selected English pronoun
and then putting the placeholder next to the closest
link in the target sentence.

In the unlikely case that there is no alignment
link in the neighbourhood of the pronoun, the place-
holder will be inserted at a similar position as the
source language position or at the end of the seg-
ment before any punctuation.

The test data were prepared in the same way
but with empty columns for the classes and the
substitution strings. We also provided informa-
tion about the document boundaries in each dataset.
For Europarl, we included file names, sentence
IDs and annotations such as SPEAKER and para-
graph boundaries. For the News Commentaries, we
supplied document IDs and paragraph boundaries.
Finally, the IWSLT data included the TED talk IDs.

Table 8 shows the distribution of classes in the
three training datasets and the official test dataset.
We can see that there are significant differences
between the different genres with respect to pro-
noun distributions.

5.2 Baseline System

The baseline system tries to reproduce the most
realistic scenario for a phrase-based SMT system
assuming that the amount of information that can
be extracted from the translation table is not suffi-
cient or is inconclusive. In that case, the pronoun
prediction would be influenced primarily by the
language model.

Thus, our baseline is based on a language model.
It fills the gaps by using a fixed set of pronouns
(those to be predicted) and a fixed set of non-
pronouns (which includes the most frequent items
aligned with a pronoun in the provided test set) as
well as NONE (i.e., do not insert anything in the
hypothesis), with a configurable NONE penalty that
accounts for the fact that n-gram language models
tend to assign higher probability to shorter strings
than to longer ones.

Figure 3: Performance of the baseline cross-lingual pronoun prediction system as a function of the NONE
penalty and the n-gram order. Shown are results on the development and on the test datasets.

The official baseline score was computed with
the NONE penalty set to an unoptimized default
value of 0. We used the same 5-gram language
model that was part of the baseline for the pronoun-
focused translation task, constructed with news
texts, parliament debates, and the TED talks of
the training/development portion.

After completing the evaluation, we ran addi-
tional experiments to analyze the effect of the
NONE penalty and the order of the n-gram model
on the performance of the baseline system. The
results are shown on Figure 3, where we can see
that the optimal value for the NONE penalty, both
for the development and for the test set, would have
been around −2. This is expected, since a negative
penalty value penalizes the omission of pronouns
in the output. The system works robustly for a wide
variety of negative penalty values, but if the penalty
is set to a positive value, which encourages pronoun
omission, the performance degrades quickly.

It is interesting that the performance of a 3-gram
model is very similar on the development and on
the test set. Increasing the n-gram order has al-
most no effect for the development set, but for the
test set it yields substantial gains in terms of both
macro-averaged F-score (see Figure 3) and accur-
acy (not shown here). We plan a detailed analysis
of this in future work, but one hypothesis is that it
is due to the test set’s better coverage of infrequent
pronouns.

Overall, the language model baseline is surpris-
ingly strong since the following (or preceding) verb
group often contains information about number,
gender, obliqueness, and animacy. It goes without
saying that much of this information is not present
in an actual MT system, which would have as much
difficulty reconstructing number and gender in-
formation in verb groups as in argument pronouns.
Thus, to achieve a good score, systems have to use
both source-side and target-side information.

11



5.3 Submitted Systems

For the cross-lingual pronoun prediction task, we
received submissions from eight groups. Some of
them also submitted a second, contrastive run. Six
of the groups submitted system description papers,
and one of the two remaining groups formally with-
drew its submission after evaluation.

All six groups with system description papers
used some form of machine learning. The main dif-
ference was whether or not they explicitly attemp-
ted to resolve pronominal coreference. Two sys-
tems relied on explicit anaphora resolution: UEDIN
and MALTA. They both applied the Stanford core-
ference resolver (Lee et al., 2011) on the source
language text, then projected the antecedents to the
target language through the word alignments, and
finally obtained morphological tags with the Mor-
fette software (Chrupała et al., 2008). The UEDIN
system (Wetzel et al., 2015) was built around a max-
imum entropy classifier. In addition to local context
and antecedent information, it used the NADA tool
(Bergsma and Yarowsky, 2011) to identify non-
referring pronouns and included predictions by a
standard n-gram language model as a feature. The
MALTA system (Pham and van der Plas, 2015) was
based on a feed-forward neural network combined
with word2vec continuous-space word embeddings
(Mikolov et al., 2013). It used local context and
antecedent information.

The other systems did not use explicit anaphora
resolution, but attempted to gather relevant inform-
ation about possible antecedents by considering
a certain number of preceding, or preceding and
following, noun phrases. They differed in the type
of classifier and in the information sources used.
UU-TIEDEMANN (Tiedemann, 2015) used a lin-
ear support vector machine with local features and
simple surface features derived from preceding
noun phrases. WHATELLES (Callin et al., 2015)
used a neural network classifier based on work by
Hardmeier et al. (2013b), but replacing all (expli-
cit or latent) anaphora resolution with information
extracted from preceding noun phrases. The IDIAP
system (Luong et al., 2015) used a Naïve Bayes
classifier and extracted features from both preced-
ing and following noun phrases to account for the
possibility of cataphoric references. The GENEVA
system (Loáiciga, 2015) used maximum entropy
classification; unlike the other submissions, it in-
cluded features derived from syntactic parse trees.

5.4 Evaluation
For the automatic evaluation, we developed a scor-
ing script that calculates the following statistics:

• confusion matrix showing (i) the count for
each gold/predicted pair, and (ii) the sums for
each row/column;

• accuracy;
• precision (P), recall (R), and F-score for each

label;

• micro-averaged P, R, F-score (note that in our
setup, micro-F is the same as accuracy);

• macro-averaged P, R, F-score.
The script performs the scoring twice:

• using coarse-grained labels (ce, {cela+ça},
elle, elles, il, ils, {OTHER+on});

• using fine-grained labels (ce, cela, elle, elles,
il, ils, on, ça, OTHER).

The official score was the macro-averaged F-
score using fine-grained labels.

5.5 Discussion
The results for the cross-lingual pronoun prediction
task are shown in Table 9. The table includes the
scores for both the primary and the secondary sub-
missions; the latter are marked with 2. The three
highest scores in each column are marked in bold-
face. The official score was the macro-averaged
F-score, which is reported in the second column.

As in the first subtask (the pronoun-focused
translation task), we find that the baseline sys-
tem, BASELINE-NP0 (here a simple n-gram-based
model) outperformed all the participating systems
on the official macro-averaged F-score. Note that
the performance of the baseline depends on the
NONE penalty; we set this parameter to 0, a default
value which we did not optimize in any way.

Immediately following the baseline, there are
several systems with macro-averaged F-scores ran-
ging between 0.55 and 0.58 (Table 9). This seems
to mark the level of performance that is achievable
with the methods currently at our disposal.

We should note that while our baseline system
outperformed all submissions, both primary and
secondary, in terms of macro-averaged F-score,
several systems performed better in terms of ac-
curacy.

Table 9: Results for the cross-lingual pronoun prediction task.

The reason why we chose macro-averaged F-
score rather than accuracy as our primary metric
is that it places more weight on the rare categor-
ies: we wanted to reward efforts to improve the
performance for the rare pronouns such as elles.
This choice was motivated by the findings of Hard-
meier et al. (2013b), who observed that the per-
formance on the rare classes strongly depended on
the classifier’s capacity to make use of coreference
information. It is worth noting that none of their
classifiers used target language n-gram information.
Yet, in our shared task, we observed that our n-gram
baseline, despite having no access to antecedent in-
formation beyond the extent of the n-gram window,
performed better than systems that did have access
to such information; this was especially true for
classes such as elle and elles, which supposedly
require knowledge about antecedents.

While a detailed analysis of this observation
must be deferred to future work, we can think of
two possible explanations. On the one hand, even
after removing the pronoun translations, there re-
mains enough information about gender and num-
ber in the inflections of the surrounding words, and
n-gram models are very good at picking up on this
sort of information. Thus, the presence of a nearby
adjective or participle with feminine inflection may
be enough for an n-gram model to make the right
guess about the translation of a pronoun.

On the other hand, there is evidence that n-gram
models are very good at recognising the typical,
rather than the actual, antecedent of a pronoun
based on context features (Hardmeier, 2014, 137–
138). This may be another factor contributing to
the good performance of the n-gram baseline.

Finally, it is interesting to note that systems
with similar overall performance perform very
differently on individual pronoun classes. UU-
TIEDEMANN, which is the second-best submission
after the baseline in terms of both macro-averaged
F-score and accuracy, is very strong on all classes
except for personal pronouns, that is, the classes
ce, cela, on, and ça. In contrast, the third-best
system, UEDIN is much stronger on elle and elles.
Without additional experiments, it is impossible
to say whether this is due to its use of anaphora
resolution or to some other factors.

6 Conclusions

We have described the design and evaluation of the
shared task at DiscoMT 2015, which included two
different, but related subtasks, focusing on the dif-
ficulty of handling pronouns in MT. We prepared
and released training and testing datasets, evalu-
ation tools, and baseline systems for both subtasks,
making it relatively easy to join. This effort was
rewarded by the attention that the task attracted
in the community. With six primary submissions
to the pronoun-focused translation task, and eight
to the cross-lingual pronoun prediction task, we
feel that the acceptance of the task was high and
that our goal of establishing the state of the art in
pronoun-aware MT has been accomplished.

The results suggest that the problem of pronoun
translation is far from solved. Even for cross-
lingual pronoun prediction, where the entire trans-
lation of the input, except for the translations of
the pronouns, is given, none of the participating
systems reached an accuracy of more than 75 % or
a macro-averaged F-score of more than 60 %.

13



In other words, even though the actual challenge
of translating the source text was completely re-
moved from the task, and despite the focused ef-
forts of eight groups, we still find ourselves in a
situation where one pronoun in four was predicted
incorrectly by the best-performing system.

This tells us something about the difficulty of
the task: In the real world, an MT system has to
generate hypotheses not only for the translation of
pronouns, but also for the full text. Many clues
that are successfully exploited by the pronoun pre-
diction systems, such as word inflections in the
neighbourhood of the pronouns, cannot be relied
on in an MT setting because they must be gener-
ated by the MT system itself and are likely to be
absent or incorrect before the translation process
is completed. If it is difficult to choose the correct
pronoun given the entire target language context,
this should be even more challenging in MT.

In both tasks, the baseline systems, whose
strongest components are standard n-gram mod-
els, outperformed all submissions on the official
metrics. This suggests that there are aspects of
the pronoun generation problem, and possibly of n-
gram models, that we do not fully understand. As a
first step towards deeper analysis of the shared task
results, it will be necessary to study why n-gram
models perform better than systems specifically
targetting pronoun translation. In the pronoun pre-
diction task, they may exploit local context clues
more aggressively, while the submitted classifiers,
designed with MT applications and unreliable con-
text in mind, tend to make incomplete use of this
readily available information. However, while this
may be a reason for the good performance of the
baseline in the prediction task, it does not explain
the results for the pronoun-focused translation task.

In any case, while this shared task has not re-
vealed a substantially better method for pronoun
translation than a plain n-gram model, we should
certainly not conclude that n-gram models are suf-
ficient for this task. In the pronoun-focused transla-
tion task, all systems, including the baseline, had er-
ror rates of 1 in 3 or higher, which confirms earlier
findings showing that pronoun translation is indeed
a serious problem for SMT (Hardmeier and Fe-
derico, 2010; Scherrer et al., 2011). We should
therefore see the results of this shared task as an
incentive to continue research on pronoun transla-
tion. We believe that our resources, methods and
findings will prove useful for this endeavour.
