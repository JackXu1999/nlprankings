Abstract

In this paper we present the first neural-based machine translation system trained to translate
between standard national varieties of the same language. We take the pair Brazilian - European
Portuguese as an example and compare the performance of this method to a phrase-based statis-
tical machine translation system. We report a performance improvement of 0.9 BLEU points in
translating from European to Brazilian Portuguese and 0.2 BLEU points when translating in the
opposite direction. We also carried out a human evaluation experiment with native speakers of
Brazilian Portuguese which indicates that humans prefer the output produced by the neural-based
system in comparison to the statistical system.

1 Introduction

In the last five years Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has evolved from a new and promising paradigm
in Machine Translation (MT) to an established state-of-the-art technology. A few studies pose that per-
formance difference between Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) and NMT is not as a great as one
could imagine (Castilho et al., 2017) while others show interesting challenges for NMT (compared to
SMT) such as learning with limited amount of data, out-of-domain, long sentences, low frequency words
or lack of word alignment model (Koehn and Knowles, 2017). Even so, NMT systems have constantly
ranked in the top positions in the competitions held in MT conferences and workshops such as WMT
(Bojar et al., 2016) and WAT (Nakazawa et al., 2016). They have also been achieving commercial success
(e.g. Google’s GNMT (Wu et al., 2016)).

Far from being settled, the architecture of NMT systems is constantly evolving. Given the youth of
the paradigm and while the main structure of encoder-decoder is still maintained, the implementation of
such is done either using recurrent neural networks (RNN) with attention mechanisms (Bahdanau et al.,
2015), to convolutional neural networks (CNN) (Gehring et al., 2017) and to only attention mechanisms
(Vaswani et al., 2017). For the same reason, research in NMT goes in many directions, including minimal
units (Sennrich et al., 2016), unsupervised training and low resources (Artetxe et al., 2018) or transfer
learning (Zoph et al., 2016), to name and cite just a few.

In this paper we tackle an under-explored problem and apply NMT techniques to translate between
language varieties. In previous work (Costa-jussà, 2017), NMT has been used to translate between
Spanish and Catalan, two closely-related Romance languages from the Iberian peninsula, outperforming
phrase-based SMT approaches. In this paper we test whether this is also true for national varieties of the
same language taking Brazilian and European Portuguese as a case study. To the best of our knowledge
the use of NMT to translate between national language varieties has not yet been studied and this paper
contributes to opening new avenues for future research.

1.1 Linguistic Motivation
Translating1 between varieties of pluricentric languages such as French, Portuguese, and Spanish is
an important task carried out in localization companies and language service providers. In the case of
Portuguese, although mutually intelligible, the varieties spoken in Brazil and Portugal differ substantially
in terms of phonetics, syntax, and lexicon. In previous work, researchers have shown that texts from these
two varieties can be discriminated using word and character n-gram-based models with 99% accuracy
(Zampieri and Gebre, 2012).

Books written in Brazil are often edited when published in Portugal and vice-versa. Many companies
adapt content, product instructions, and user manuals from one country to the other to meet the expec-
tations of costumers and readers of the target country. Brazilian and European Portuguese – henceforth
BP and EP – is therefore a particularly relevant and interesting language variety pair to investigate the
use of NMT approaches.

A few of the most distinctive characteristics of these two language varieties are summarized next:

• Orthographic differences:2 In the European variety muted consonants such as in acto, baptismo
(EP) for act, baptism (EN) continue to be written whereas in the Brazilian variety for many decades
speakers no longer write them ato, batismo (BP).

• Verb tenses: When expressing progressive events (e.g. I am running (EN)), the Brazilian variety
prefers the gerund form correndo (BP) whereas the European one typically favors the use of the
infinitive form a correr (EP).

• Clitics: Personal pronouns are used in different positions in the two varieties. European Portuguese
speakers prefer the use of enclitic personal pronouns, that is after the verb, such as in Ele viu-
me (EP) whereas Brazilian speakers would typically prefer to use personal pronouns in a proclitic
position, before the verb, as in Ele me viu (BP) (He saw me (EN)).

• Use of pronouns: The use of the second person singular pronoun tu (you (EN)), is only restricted
to regional use in Brazil but widespread in Portugal. BP speakers use você in most contexts whereas
this form is considered to be a formal register in Portugal used only in specific formal contexts
similar to the use of tu - usted in Spanish and du - Sie in German.

Apart from the aforementioned differences, lexical variation is abundant between these two varieties.
Examples of these are preferences such as nomeadamente which is rare in BP and very frequent in EP
and false cognates such as the word propina. Its most frequent sense in BP is bribe and in EP is fee.

2 Related Work

There have been a few papers published on translating texts between Brazilian and European Portuguese.
One example is the work by Marujo et al. (2011) which proposed a rule-based system to adapt texts from
BP to EP. Marujo et al. (2011) used comparable journalistic corpora available at Linguateca (Santos,
2014), namely CETEMPublico and CETEMFolha, a collection of texts collected from the Brazilian
newspaper Zero Hora, and Ted Talks to evaluate their method.

Another example of a system developed to translate between Brazilian and European Portuguese is
the one by Fancellu et al. (2014) who presented and SMT system trained on a parallel collection from
Intel translation memories. The authors report 0.589 BLEU score using a Moses baseline system.

Apart from the two aforementioned studies on translating between Portuguese varieties there have
been a few studies published on translating between similar languages, language varieties, and dialects
of other languages. Examples of such studies include Zhang (1998) on Mandarin and Cantonese Chinese,
Scannell (2006) on Irish and Scottish Gaelic, (Goyal and Lehal, 2010) on Hindi and Punjabi, a few studies

1In this paper, when talking about language varieties, we use the verbs adapt, edit, and translate interchangeably. In previous
work Marujo et al. (2011) used the word adaptation whereas Fancellu et al. (2014) used the word conversion. We consider it,
however, as a full-fledged translation task and approach the task as such.

2The 1990 orthographic agreement has been recently introduced in both countries diminishing these differences.

on Afrikaans and Dutch (Van Huyssteen and Pilon, 2009; Otte and Tyers, 2011), and Hassani (2017) on
Kurdish dialects.

To the best of our knowledge, however, the use of NMT is under-explored in these tasks and no
language variety translation system has been developed using NMT. The most similar study is the one
by (Costa-jussà et al., 2017) who developed a neural-based MT system to translate between Catalan and
Spanish. The use of NMT to translate between language varieties is the main contribution of our work.

3 Methods

To be able to compare MT approaches, we trained SMT and NMT systems using the same dataset
described in Section 3.1. The two systems are described in detail in Section 3.2.

Systems within the SMT category use statistical techniques to compose the final translation. There are
a variety of alternatives that are state-of-the art, including: n-gram (Mariño et al., 2006), syntax (Yamada
and Knight, 2001) or hierarchical to name a few. In this paper, we are using the popular phrase-based
system (Koehn et al., 2003).

Systems within the NMT category use a machine learning architecture based on neural networks to
compose the final translation. As mentioned, there are several architectures which have been proven
state-of-the-art, all of them based on an encoder-decoder schema but using either recurrent neural net-
works (Cho et al., 2014), convolutional neural networks (Gehring et al., 2017) or the transformer ar-
chitecture based only on attention-based mechanisms (Vaswani et al., 2017). These architectures can
be adapted to deal with different input representations either words, subwords (Sennrich et al., 2016),
characters (Costa-jussà and Fonollosa, 2016; Lee et al., 2017) or bytes (Costa-jussà et al., 2017).

In this paper, we are using the first option of recurrent neural networks with an added attention-based
mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2015) and bytes as input representations (Costa-jussà et al., 2017).

3.1 Data

Compiling suitable parallel language variety corpora for NLP tasks is not trivial. Popular and freely
available data sources (e.g. Wikipedia) used in NLP do not account for regional variation. One possible
data source that includes national varieties of the same language are technical user manuals which are
often localized between countries. However, user manuals contain a very specific technical language
with short and idiomatic sentences representing commands.

We searched for suitable datasets and we acquired an aligned Brazilian - European Portuguese parallel
corpus of film subtitle dialogues from Open Subtitles available at Opus3 (Tiedemann, 2012). We removed
all XML tags available in the data. The cleaned corpus, which we will be making available for the
community as another contribution of our work4, comprises 4.3 million sentences in each language for
training, with over 33 million tokens for BP and over 34 million tokens for EP. Finally, 2,000 parallel
sentences were kept for development and another 2,000 sentences for testing.

3.2 Systems

Statistical-based. In a phrase-based system, the main model, which is the translation model, is ex-
tracted by statistical co-occurrences from a parallel corpus at the level of sentences. This translation
model is combined in the decoder with other models to compose the most probable translation given a
source input. We built a standard phrase-based system with Moses open source toolkit (Koehn et al.,
2007). The main parameters of our implementation include: grow-diagonal-final-and word alignment
symmetrization, lexicalized reordering, relative frequencies (conditional and posterior probabilities) with
phrase discounting, lexical weights, phrase bonus, accepting phrases up to length 10, 5-gram language
model with Kneser-Ney smoothing, word bonus and MERT (Minimum Error Rate Training) optimisa-
tion. These parameters are taken from previous work (Costa-jussà et al., 2017).

4The clean version of the corpus is available upon request.



278

Neural-based. Specifically, neural MT computes the conditional probability of the target sentence
given the source sentence by means of an encoder-decoder or sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) archi-
tecture, where the encoder reads the source sentence, does a word embedding, and encodes it into an
intermediate representation using a bidirectional recurrent neural network with Long Short Term Mem-
ory units (LSTM) as activation functions. Then, the decoder, which is also a recurrent neural network,
generates translation based on this intermediate representation. This baseline seq2seq architecture is im-
proved with an attention-based mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2015) which allows for the introduction of
contextual information while decoding. This architecture is extended to deal with bytes (Costa-jussà et
al., 2017) to overcome unknown words. We are adopting the same parameters as set in mentioned previ-
ous work. We use an in-house Theano implementation based on code available5. We use a bidirectional
LSTM of 512 units for encoding, a batch size of 32, no dropout and ADAM optimization. For more
details about the architecture refer to previous work (Costa-jussà et al., 2017).

3.3 Human Evaluation

To validate the results obtained with the automatic evaluation metrics, we used the ranking and rating
features available in CATaLog online (Pal et al., 2016a; Pal et al., 2016b), a web-based CAT tool devel-
oped for translation process research. We ask native speakers of Brazilian Portuguese first to compare
segments translated by NMT and SMT, choosing the best output, and subsequently to rate translations
taking both fluency and adequacy into account using a 1 to 7 Likert scale. More information and the
results of these experiments are presented in Section 4.2.

4 Results

4.1 Automatic Metrics

In this section we present the results obtained by the statistical-based system based of phrases and the
neural-based system based on seq2seq with attention and bytes in terms of BLEU score (Papineni et al.,
2002). Table 1 presents the results obtained by the three systems when translating from EP to BP and
Table 2 presents results obtained from BP to EP. The best results for each setting are presented in bold.

System BLEU Score

Phrase-based SMT 47.68
Neural MT 48.58

System BLEU Score

Phrase-based SMT 47.34
Neural MT 47.54

Table 2: Brazilian to European Portuguese translation results in terms of BLEU score.

We observed that in both directions the NMT system outperformed the SMT approach. The neural system
obtained the best performance translating from European to Brazilian Portuguese achieving 48.58 BLEU
points on average, and from Brazilian to European Portuguese achieving 47.54 BLEU points on average.
This performance was 0.9 and 0.2 BLEU points better than the average performance obtained by the
SMT system.

4.2 Human Evaluation
Following the best practice in translation evaluation, as observed in the WMT shared tasks (Bojar et al.,
2016; Bojar et al., 2017), we present two human evaluation experiments to validate the results obtained
with the automatic evaluation metrics. The first one is a ranking experiment in which participants were
asked to choose which translation of a given segment they preferred without knowing which system
produced the translations. The second one is a pilot rating experiment in which participants were asked
to rate translations using a 1 to 7 Likert scale.

We start by reporting the results obtained in the ranking experiment. We evaluated the quality of the
EP-BP translation direction asking a group of seven native speakers of BP to rank sentences produced
by the SMT system and by the NMT system. We presented native speakers with the source segment in
EP and two translations in BP. Their task was to select the best output (ties were allowed). The decision
to use only BP native speakers was motivated by the findings reported in (Goutte et al., 2016) which
indicate that speakers of BP are generally not familiar with what is acceptable in the European variety
and vice-versa.

We considered the full set of 2,000 test sentences and disregard sentences where 1) no transformation
has been made (the source, outputs, and the reference are the same), and 2) transformations have been
made but NMT and SMT outputs are the same. After filtering, 679 distinct segments were left for the
human evaluation. We randomly selected 20% of these segments 679 (136 sentences) and presented them
to two annotators to calculate inter-annotator agreement. Finally, the set of 815 segments, 679 segments
plus 136 segments (20% redundancy), divided into 23 sub-sets and presented to each of the annotators.
Each annotator evaluated between three and four sub-sets.

To assess the reliability of the rankings, we first compute the agreement between the annotators. We
report substantial inter-annotator agreement achieving 0.88 pairwise Kappa score. We present the re-
sults obtained by the ranking experiment in terms of the percentage of segments in which 1) NMT was
preferred by the annotator, 2) the two segments were consider the same, 3) SMT was preferred by the an-
notator. Results are summarized in Table 3. We observed that the NMT output was judged to be equal or
better the SMT output in 57.81% of the cases. The NMT output was preferred in 48.43% of the rankings
and judged to be of same quality as SMT in 9.38% of the cases.

Outcome Percentage of Cases
NMT preferred 48.43%
Ties 9.38%
SMT preferred 42.19%

Table 3: Human evaluation scores - Raking experiment.

To further investigate how humans perceive the quality of the EP-BP translations, we carry out a pilot
rating experiment with two of the aforementioned annotators. From the 679 segments included in the
ranking experiment, we randomly selected 100 segments and create two sub-sets of 50 segments each.
We provide each annotator with a sub-set and ask them to rate the translations taking both fluency and
adequacy into account using a Likert scale of 1 to 7. The average results obtained by each system in the
pilot rating experiment are presented in Table 4.

Outcome Average Score
Neural MT 5.4
Phrase-based SMT 5.1

Table 4: Human evaluation scores - Ranking pilot experiment.

The average results suggest that humans have a rather positive opinion about the translations produced



280

by both systems. The average score obtained by the NMT system was 5.4 whereas the SMT obtained 5.1.
The outcomes of both the ranking and the rating experiments confirm that the NMT system produces a
higher quality output than SMT for this task and that the improvement in BLEU score is indeed perceived
by humans. We are currently replicating this pilot experiment with more annotators.

4.3 Discussion
We observed several interesting patterns in the NMT and SMT outputs and here we present a brief
linguistic analysis of the output of both systems.

In our analysis, we observed that NMT was generally better in handling the transformation from the
proclitic pronominal position generally used in BP to the enclitic pronominal position generally preferred
in EP as shown in Example 1. This is just true for declarative-affirmative main clauses (other syntactic
contexts involve proclisis).

(1) SOURCE (EP): Fizeste-me chorar
SMT: Fez chorar.
NMT: Você me fez chorar.
REFERENCE (BP): Me fez chorar.
EN: You made me cry.

In Example 1 NMT produces the correct translation in a particularly challenging case in which tu was
omitted in the source segment. Even when this re-ordering operation had to occur in the opposite di-
rection, EP enclitic and BP proclitic, NMT was able to handle it better than SMT as demonstrated in
Example 2.

(2) SOURCE (EP): Nem me estás a ouvir, querido.
SMT: Nem me está a ouvir, querido.
NMT: Nem está me ouvindo, querido.
REFERENCE (BP): Nem está me ouvindo, querido.
EN: You are not even hearing me, honey.

NMT also proved to be better in translating the infinitive form used in EP a ouvir to the gerund preferred
in BP ouvindo (EN: doing). Example 2 is a good example in which NMT produced a better output than
SMT handling both pronominal positions and verb form correctly.

In Example 1 both systems translated fizeste from the second person singular tu preferred in EP to
the third person singular fez as in você fez (EN: you did) preferred in BP. However, we observed a wide
variation when handling the forms tu and você and their respective verbs. We spotted several translations
in which SMT handled this phenomenon better than the NMT system as in Example 3.

(3) SOURCE (EP): Tu não pedes nada a ninguém.
SMT: Você não pede nada a ninguém.
NMT: Tu não pedes nada a ninguém.
REFERENCE (BP): E você jamais pediria nada, não é?
EN: You don’t ask anything to anyone.

Finally, it is important to note that, as evidenced in Example 3, in many cases the reference BP translation
was substantially or completely different from the EP source. This is probably related to the data domain,
movie subtitles, which presents a great deal of variability and encourages creative translations, in this case
from the language of the movie to the respective variety of Portuguese. This variability certainly led both
systems to obtain lower BLEU scores. Nevertheless, the results of the pilot rating experiment indicate
that humans have a rather positive opinion about both systems’ output and that NMT is preferred.

5 Conclusion and Future Work

This paper presented the first NMT system trained to translate between national language varieties. We
used the language variety pair Brazilian and European Portuguese as an example and a parallel corpus of
subtitles to train the NMT system.



281

Compared to an SMT system trained on the same data, we report a performance improvement of 0.9
BLEU points in translating from European to Brazilian Portuguese and 0.2 BLEU points when translating
in the opposite direction. Our results indicate that the NMT system produces better translations than the
SMT system not only in terms of BLEU scores but also according to the judgments of seven native
speakers. The human evaluation experiments contribute to recent empirical evaluations on the quality of
NMT output beyond automatic metrics (Castilho et al., 2017).

We would like to carry out a more comprehensive human evaluation experiment in future work. This
includes a rating experiment with more annotators and replicating the EP to BP evaluation to the BP
to EP translations. A pilot experiment with EP speakers indicates that NMT output is also preferred.
We would like to measure the cognitive effort and post-editing time for both SMT and NMT outputs.
This could provide valuable information for translation and localization companies about translation
productivity. Finally, and since NMT is progressing fast, future comparisons will be built with other
NMT architectures like (Vaswani et al., 2017).
