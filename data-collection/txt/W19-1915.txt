Abstract

Recently natural language processing (NLP)
tools have been developed to identify and ex-
tract salient risk indicators in electronic health
records (EHRs). Sentiment analysis, although
widely used in non-medical areas for improv-
ing decision making, has been studied mini-
mally in the clinical setting. In this study, we
undertook, to our knowledge, the first domain
adaptation of sentiment analysis to psychiatric
EHRs by defining psychiatric clinical senti-
ment, performing an annotation project, and
evaluating multiple sentence-level sentiment
machine learning (ML) models. Results indi-
cate that off-the-shelf sentiment analysis tools
fail in identifying clinically positive or nega-
tive polarity, and that the definition of clinical
sentiment that we provide is learnable with rel-
atively small amounts of training data. This
project is an initial step towards further re-
fining sentiment analysis methods for clinical
use. Our long-term objective is to incorporate
the results of this project as part of a machine
learning model that predicts inpatient readmis-
sion risk. We hope that this work will initiate
a discussion concerning domain adaptation of
sentiment analysis to the clinical setting.

1 Introduction

Psychotic disorders typically emerge in late ado-
lescence or early adulthood (Kessler et al., 2007;
Thomsen, 1996) and affect approximately 2.5-4%
of the population (Perälä et al., 2007; Bogren et al.,
2009), making them one of the leading causes of
disability worldwide (Vos et al., 2015). A sub-
stantial proportion of psychiatric inpatients are
readmitted after discharge (Wiersma et al., 1998).
Readmissions are disruptive for both patients and
families, and are a key driver of rising health-
care costs (Mangalore and Knapp, 2007; Wu et al.,
2005). Reducing readmission risk is therefore a
major unmet need of psychiatric care. Developing

clinically implementable ML tools to enable accu-
rate assessment of readmission risk factors offers
opportunities to inform the selection of treatment
interventions and to subsequently implement ap-
propriate preventive measures.

Sentiment analysis (also known as opinion min-
ing) has been used for capturing the subjective
“feeling” (e.g. positive, negative, or neutral va-
lence) of reviews and has recently been expanded
to include other domains such as reactions to stock
market prediction or political trends (Mäntylä
et al., 2018). With the rise of social media and
other user-generated web content, sentiment anal-
ysis has been adopted by many industries as a way
of monitoring opinions towards their products,
reputations, and for identifying opportunities for
improvement. Traditionally, sentiment analysis
has been approached with a lexicon-based major-
ity vote approach, where a dictionary of terms and
their associated sentiments (e.g. SentiWordnet,
Pattern, SO-CAL, VADER) are queried to deter-
mine the sentiment of a given text (Taboada et al.,
2011). However, this approach fails to account
for many associated linguistic challenges such as
negation handling, scope, sarcasm, qualified state-
ments, and out-of-vocabulary terms. As such, re-
search groups have moved towards approaching
the problem from a corpus-based machine learn-
ing perspective. This approach has the added ben-
efit of model flexibility depending on the training
data and can capture more syntactic nuance. Most
state-of-the-art performances on sentiment analy-
sis benchmarks are currently achieved with deep
learning sequence models that are trained on syn-
tactically parsed corpora such as the Stanford Sen-
timent Treebank (Socher et al., 2013).

In clinical and medical domains, however, sen-
timent analysis has not yet been well studied. Yet
retrieving subjective clinical attitudes (sentiment)
from EHR narratives has the potential to facili-



118

tate identification of a patient’s symptomatologi-
cal worsening or increased readmission risk.

The concept of medical sentiment is complex
and vocabularies differ from general-domain sen-
timent. In the field of psychiatry, this is especially
true. Therefore, there is a need for domain adap-
tation of sentiment analysis that includes a richer
array of attributes than can typically be found in
off-the-shelf tools. In this work, we established
an annotation scheme to characterize sentiment-
related features in EHRs, and used this to carry
out, to our knowledge, the first psychiatry-specific
sentiment annotation project on EHRs. The result-
ing datasets are used to train and evaluate a clas-
sifier to predict clinical sentiment at the sentence
level. This classifier, which in future works will be
integrated in a pipeline for predicting readmission
risk, is clinically useful for targeting treatments
and aiding in decision making.

2 Related Works

Although there has been some work on clinical
adaptation of sentiment analysis using healthcare-
related data extracted from web forums, biomedi-
cal texts, or social media postings (See for exam-
ple (Smith and Lee, 2012; Niu et al., 2005; Salas-
Zárate et al., 2017; Nguyen et al., 2014)), there has
been minimal work on sentiment analysis when
applied to actual EHR data.

McCoy et al. (2015) used a corpus of psychosis
patient discharge summaries and the 3,000 word
Pattern lexical opinion mining dictionary (Smedt
and Daelemans, 2012) to classify the associated
sentiment of documents using a majority vote clas-
sifier. Results of their Cox regression models
showed that greater positive sentiment was associ-
ated with a reduction in inpatient readmission risk.
Waudby-Smith et al. (2018) applied the same Pat-
tern sentiment lexicon to a corpus of ICU nursing
notes to predict 30-day mortality risk. They found
that stronger negative sentiment polarity was as-
sociated with an increased 30-day mortality risk.
One of the limitations in both studies is that Pat-
tern is a general-domain sentiment lexicon that
contains few informative medical or psychiatry-
specific terminology. Also, the authors did not
manually annotate the datasets they worked with.
As a result, they were not able to confirm that
the predicted sentiment aligned with the sentiment
from a clinical perspective.

(Deng et al., 2014) and (Denecke and Deng,

2015) systematically compared word usage and
sentiment distribution between clinical narratives
(nurse letters, discharge summary, and radiology
reports) and medical social media (MedBlog, drug
reviews). They concluded that off-the-shelf senti-
ment tools were not ideal for analyzing sentiment
in medical documents and that EHRs were sig-
nificantly more difficult in predicting sentiment,
in particular neutral sentiment (Neutral F1=0.216
and 0.080 for nurse letters and radiology reports,
respectively). They developed annotation guide-
lines and undertook a span-level annotation task
on 300 ICU nurse letters to identify words related
to clinical sentiment (Deng et al., 2016). Results
of applying ML algorithms to these data are not
available yet.

3 Methods

In this work, we define psychiatric clinical sen-
timent as a clinician’s attitudes (positive, neg-
ative, or neutral) towards a patient’s prognosis
with regards to seven readmission risk factor do-
mains (appearance, mood, interpersonal relations,
substance use, thought content, thought process,
and occupation) that were identified in prior work
(Holderness et al., 2018). The scope of our cur-
rent definition is intentionally narrow such that the
sentiment of a given sentence is considered in iso-
lation without any prior knowledge.

Three clinicians participated in an annotation
project that focused on identifying the clinical sen-
timent associated with psychiatric EHR texts at
the sentence level. In total, two corpora of clin-
ical narratives from institutional EHRs, one con-
taining 3,500 sentences (training dataset) and the
other 1,650 (test dataset) were annotated using the
definition established in the annotation scheme.

The training dataset consisted exclusively of
sentence-length sequences that involved only one
risk factor domain in each example. The exam-
ples in the dataset were identified from a large
corpus of unannotated psychosis patient EHR
data sourced from the psychiatric units of several
Boston-area hospitals in the Partners HealthCare
network, including Massachusetts General Hospi-
tal and Brigham & Women’s Hospital. We used
our risk factor domain topic extraction model to
automatically identify relevant sentences, which
were then manually validated by one of the clin-
icians involved in this project to ensure they did
not involve multiple domains in the same exam-

ple. See Table 1 for example sentences for each
domain.

The test dataset is an extension of the corpus
used previously to evaluate our risk factor domain
topic extraction model and is non-overlapping
with the training data, consisting of discharge
summaries, admission notes, individual encounter
notes, and other clinical notes from 220 patients
in the OnTrackTM program at McLean Hospital.
OnTrackTM is an outpatient program, focusing on
treating adults ages 18 to 30 who are experienc-
ing their first episodes of psychosis. Because we
are interested in identifying the clinical sentiment
associated with each risk factor domain individu-
ally, the test dataset consists of examples that were
intentionally selected to be challenging for our
model: they are variable in length, wide-ranging
in vocabulary, and can involve multiple risk factor
domains (e.g. “Work functioning is impaired, but
pt has good relationship w/ his girlfriend and is not
engaging in substance use.”).

These corpora are available to other researchers
upon request. Table 2 details the distribution of
the training and test data. The imbalance of train-
ing examples across the three sentiment classes re-
flects the natural distribution of sentiment reflected
in EHRs, as certain risk factor domains (e.g. sub-
stance use) will rarely be reflected in a neutral or

We evaluated three classification models. Our
baseline model is a majority vote approach using
the Pattern sentiment lexicon employed by Mc-
Coy (2015) and Waudby-Smith (2018). The sec-
ond and third models use fully supervised and
semi-supervised multilayer perceptron (MLP) ar-
chitectures, respectively. Since positive and neg-
ative clinical sentiment can differ across each do-
main, we train a suite of seven models, one for
each risk factor domain. The training and test
data were vectorized at the sentence level using the
pretrained Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) em-
bedding module (Cer et al., 2018) that is available
through TensorFlow Hub and is designed specifi-
cally for transfer learning tasks. Although USE is
trained on a large volume of web-based, general-
domain data, we have found in prior work that
the embeddings lead to higher accuracy on down-

stream classification tasks than embedding mod-
els (e.g. ELMo, Doc2Vec, FastText) trained on
smaller volumes of EHR data (Holderness et al.,
2019).

Hyperparameters were tuned using grid search
with 5-fold cross-validation on the training dataset
and are specified in Table 4. Due to the rela-
tively small amount of labeled training data, our
proposed model architecture is designed to pre-
vent overfitting by using a restricted view of the
training data via a high rate of dropout in the hid-
den layers. Additionally, we use two hidden lay-
ers to extract a more abstracted form of the input.
Additionally, because neutral sentiment is much
broader in scope and has fewer training examples,
resulting in covariate shift, we compute a thresh-
old for classifying positive and negative sentiment
using the formula min=avg(sim)+*(sim), where is
standard deviation and is a constant, which we set
to 0.2. If a given test sentence does not have posi-
tive or negative outputs that exceed this threshold,
the sentence is classified as neutral even if neutral
is not the maximal output.

We experimented with two semi-supervised
learning configurations, Self-Training and K-
Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The self-training ap-
proach involved first training our model on the la-
beled training data and then using this model to
identify unlabeled examples from a large prepro-

cessed corpus of unlabeled EHR data (2,100,000
sentences, 85,000,000 tokens). For the KNN ap-
proach, we projected all of the labeled and un-
labeled examples into vector space and treated
the labeled examples as centroids. For each cen-
troid, we then used Euclidean distance to compute
the five nearest unlabeled examples. Both mod-
els were trained using a 20:80 combination of the
original labeled data and the additional unlabeled
data.

4 Results and Discussion

Inter-annotator agreement (IAA) was substan-
tial on the first corpus (Scott’s Pi=0.691, Co-
hen’s Kappa=0.693) and higher on the second
(Pi=0.768, Kappa=0.768) (Fleiss, 1971; Davies
and Fleiss, 1982). This is expected as the first
corpus contains many sentences involving multi-
ple readmission risk factor domains and annota-



121

tors were instructed to provide clinical sentiment
labels for each, whereas the second corpus con-
sists entirely of single domain sentences. In both
cases, IAA surpasses that reported by Denecke
and Deng (2016), primarily because of the clinical
expertise of the annotators involved in this project.

Results of the three classifiers are shown in
Table 3, with the highest score on each perfor-
mance metric in bold. The ‘All’ row for each
model configuration was computed by averaging
the scores of the sentiment models for each risk
factor domain. Applying the Pattern sentiment
lexicon to our test corpus showed a strong trend
towards underclassification of positive and neg-
ative examples, which led to poor recall scores
while maintaining moderate precision. Neutral ex-
amples, however, were correctly classified signif-
icantly more often. This confirms that many of
the most informative words in terms of clinical
sentiment (e.g. ‘hallucination’, ‘depressed’, ‘em-
ployed’, etc.) do not hold significance in general-
domain sentiment and are therefore not part of the
Pattern lexicon.

Despite the relatively small size of the train-
ing corpus, the EHR data used for training cap-
tured much of the domain-specific vocabulary re-
lated to clinical sentiment and our suite of models
achieved F-measures on classifying positive and
negative sentiment that exceed those reported in
prior literature (Deng et al., 2014). Although di-
rect comparison between our EHR dataset and the
EHR datasets used by other researchers is limited
due to HIPAA restrictions, our training EHR data
is sourced from the same EHR database as McCoy
(2015). Therefore, a better performance of our
models indirectly supports that our model can bet-
ter capture the underlying clinical sentiment em-
bedded in EHRs.

Because clinical documents are written for a
specific purpose such as assessing the outcome of
treatment, they contain less neutral content and as
a result sentiment distributions are intrinsically bi-
ased to either positive or negative polarity. Thus,
identifying training examples with neutral senti-
ment was challenging and consequently both the
fully and semi-supervised models were poor at
identifying neutral sentiment across all seven do-
mains. In addition, unless the patient is markedly
improved, clinicians tend to document continuing
unresolved symptoms. leading to a greater amount
of negative content. We hypothesize that this may

be one reason for the lower overall F1 perfor-
mance on positive versus negative sentiment.

We observed that per-domain performance of
our models aligned with the natural distribution of
positive vs. negative clinical sentiment in EHRs.
Substance use, for example, had low positive F1
scores as the majority of references to substance
use in EHRs involve negative sentiment unless the
patient is noted to be abstaining from substance
use. We also observed that sentiment distribution
towards negative polarity is more evident in mood
and thought content, which include, for example,
delusions, depression, anxiety, and hallucinations.

When applying semi-supervised learning meth-
ods, we found self-training to marginally improve
performance on negative clinical sentiment but the
overall F1 score was not better than the fully su-
pervised model due to lower precision. We ob-
served minimal change in performance when us-
ing a k-nearest neighbors approach.

5 Conclusion and Future Work

We focused in this study on the clinical sentiment
associated with readmission for seven risk factor
domains identified in prior work by undertaking
an annotation project and using the resultant gold
standard to train semi-supervised ML algorithms
to automatically infer this sentiment. Our results
indicate that domain adaptation of sentiment anal-
ysis is necessary for aligning with clinician opin-
ions.

We intend to improve our clinical sentiment
classifier in future work by increasing the size of
the annotated training corpus (in particular neutral
examples) and by changing the model input to a
sequence model as opposed to a full sentence vec-
tor representation. We also intend to modify our
definition of clinical sentiment to include tempo-
ral linking of elements that involve clinical senti-
ment in an EHR to establish gradients of changes
in patient status over time. Finally, we will incor-
porate our sentiment analysis model in a classifier
that predicts inpatient readmission risk.
