Abstract 

This paper describes an on-going project of 
transcribing and annotating digitized manu-
scripts of medieval Spanish with paleograph-
ic and lexical information. We link lexical 
units from the manuscripts with the Multilin-
gual Central Repository (MCR), making 
terms retrievable by any of the languages that 
integrate MCR. The goal of the project is 
twofold: creating a paleographic knowledge 
base from digitized medieval facsimiles, that 
will allow paleographers, philologist, histori-
cal linguist, and humanities scholars in gen-
eral, to analyze and retrieve graphemic, lexi-
cal and textual information from historical 
documents; and on the other hand, develop-
ing machine readable documents that will 
link image representations of graphemic and 
lexical units in a facsimile with Linked Open 
Data resources. This paper concentrates on 
the encoding and cross-linking procedures. 

1 Introduction 
In recent years, historical documents have been 
massively digitized and published online in 
openly available databases, gathering much of 
the attention of the Digital Humanities communi-
ty. As a result, large collections of historical 
handwriting online databases have emerged such 
as Pares1, paleographic resources like DigiPal2, 
citizen scholar projects (Deciphering Secrets: 
Unlocking the Manuscripts of Medieval Spain3) 
and digital paleography learning tools (Spanish 
Paleography Digital Teaching and Learning 
Tool4). In this context, computerized tools have

become part of the toolkit of the current humani-
ties scholar.   
   Most of the research in the computational anal-
ysis of digitized historical handwritten docu-
ments, has concentrated in its paleographic anal-
ysis: the deciphering, dating, and description of 
ancient manuscripts (Wolf, et. al, 2011; Hassner, 
et. al, 2013). In this paper, we describe an ongo-
ing project for encoding digitized medieval 
Spanish manuscripts from the 13th, 14th and early 
15th centuries, and linking their content with the 
Multilingual Central Repository (MCR)5 (Gonza-
lez-Agirre et al., 2012).  

The main goal of the project is the develop-
ment of an online database of digitized medieval 
manuscripts that will enable users to obtain gra-
phemic and lexical information from facsimiles. 
Manuscripts will be fully searchable using any of 
the languages that integrate the MCR.  

The resource will aid the paleographic under-
standing of medieval manuscripts as well as the 
linguistic and philological analysis of medieval 
Spanish. Also, the database can be a valuable 
source for computational researchers interested 
in the automatic processing of medieval manu-
scripts, since image data will be linked to text 
and lexical information. To our knowledge, an 
online resource of this type does not exist. 

In this paper we concentrate on: the descrip-
tion of the methods for transcribing, annotating, 
and encoding manuscripts; the process of auto-
matically linking their content at a lexical level 
with MCR entries, and for codifying these rela-
tionships in a model. 

2 Encoding transcriptions of medieval 
manuscripts 

Historical Spanish language varieties exhibit im-
portant differences not only at the syntactical and

morphological level, but also at the graphemic. 
This is due to the fact that orthographic rules in 
Spanish were not defined until the 18th century6, 
bringing serious difficulties for the understand-
ing of Medieval Spanish 7  manuscripts, since 
there is substantial variation even within docu-
ments of the same period; mostly because scribes 
had different handwriting styles. Medieval or-
thography also does not follow contemporary 
patterns, there is not in a strict sense, different 
options between graphemes, but rather a combi-
nation of factors that may explain certain solu-
tions. As mentioned by Sánchez-Prieto (2004), 
medieval manuscripts should be understood 
following a triple correlation of factors: 

1. Paleographic uses and shapes of the 
letters. 

2. Identification of the letters. 
3. Phonetic changes. 

In this triple relation lies the evolution of 
handwriting, and may reveal important aspects of 
phonetic change. For that reason, handwritten 
medieval documents are nowadays manually 
transcribed with the aid of computational tools. 
In Figure 1, two examples of different handwrit-
ing styles from early 15th century are shown, 
where the grapheme “a” at the end of each word, 
is written in a triangular shape (for the first word 
“la”), and in a square shape (for the second word 
“buena”). In our work, we segmented the tran-
scribed words in manuscripts using the UVic 
Image Markup Tool8, which allows for the anno-
tation and transcription of facsimiles using the 
Text Encoding Initiative (TEI9) model. We cus-
tomize the markup of the TEI document to be 
able to codify graphemic and lexical information.

sentation of texts in digital form. Following TEI

graphic rules in 1726, as part of the first volume of the Dic-
cionario de Autoridades. 
   7 Medieval Spanish is an early form of Spanish that ranges 
from the 10th to the 15th century, as it is considered by most 
scholars.

XML-based file format for exchanging text.  

guidelines, different graphemic representations 
are declared using the element <glyph> in the 
header of the document (see Figure 2). Image 
representations of words in the facsimile are 
segmented using the element <surface>, which 
defines a written surface as a two-dimensional 
coordinate space, specifying zones of interest or 
grouping graphic representations within that 
space; and the <zone> element, that defines a 
two dimensional area within a  <surface>. The 
attributes @ulx, @uly, @lrx and @lry, represent 
respectively, the x and y values for the upper left 
and lower right corners of a rectangular space 
(see Figure 3). Declarations of graphemes are 
linked to the transcribed text using the element 
<g>, so variations of a grapheme can be identi-
fied and compared. Transcribed words are repre-
sented in the TEI document using the <w> ele-
ment. We automatically generate unique xml:id 
for each element in the TEI document. The nest-
ed representation of words and graphemes in a 
facsimile is shown in Figure 4.

3 Linking medieval manuscripts with 
multilingual lexical resources  

In order to link image representations of words in 
a historical variety with a multilingual lexical 
database, two operations need to take place: 

1. Matching the historical form of the 
word with its contemporary standard. 

2. Codifying that relation in the docu-
ment. 

3.1 Mapping medieval Spanish with con-
temporary standard 

Before the cross-linking of the transcribed words 
from the manuscript with MCR entries, words 
from medieval Spanish will need to be mapped 
to the standard form of contemporary Spanish. 
We follow the rules presented in (Sánchez-
Prieto, 2004) and previous computational work 
on historical language varieties (Sánchez-Marco 
et. al, 2010). 
   The mapping rules used can be divided into 
substring rules and word rules. In Table 1 
examples of the mappings using substring rules 
are introduced. Words that are not covered by the 
substring rules include graphemic variation of 
the type: decaydo→decaído, fablar→hablar.

3.2 Linking terms from medieval manu-
scripts with MCR synsets 

WordNet is a large lexical database of English 
(Miller, 1995), where open class words are 
grouped into concepts represented by synonyms 
(synsets) that are linked to each other by 
semantic relations such as hyponymy and 
meronymy. There are multiple wordnets for 
different languages, and wordnets for groups of 
languages like the Euro WordNet (Vossen, 
1998). Wordnets have also been extended by 
using external lexical resources like Wiktionary 
(McCrae et al., 2012) or with a combination of 
multilingual resources (De Melo & Weikum, 
2009; Bond & Foster, 2013). Also, the 
Portuguese wordnet incorporates non standard 
varieties of the language (Marrafa et al., 2011). 
Our goal is to link words from historical varieties 
of Spanish extracted from manuscripts, to 
synsets in MCR, in such a way that the image 
representation of a medieval word can be directly 
associated to its contemporary form or via se-
mantic relations to a sense. 
   The MCR integrates wordnets in five different 
languages, English, Spanish, Catalan, Basque 
and Galician that are linked to each other via an 
Inter-Lingual-Index (ILI). Each of the wordnets 
in the MCR is aligned to the Princeton WordNet 
3.0 and encoded using Lexicon Model for Ontol-
ogies (lemon)10. One of the main advantages of 
using lemon is its linguistically sound structure 
based on the Lexical Markup Framework (LMF), 
making it an ideal model for lexicons and ma-
chine-readable dictionaries in the Linked Data 
Cloud. 
  We use a Python script for linking words from 
historical Spanish manuscripts encoded in a TEI 
document with existing MCR synsets, by match-
ing lemmas in medieval Spanish with contempo-
rary standard. We follow the substring and word 
mapping rules described in the previous subsec-
tion, matching them with contemporary Spanish 
lemmas in MCR. This approach is imperfect, 
since there are medieval words that no longer 
exist or might have different lexical realizations. 
In these cases, medieval words will need to be

linked with synsets via the linguistic analysis of 
their meanings using a historical dictionary, fol-
lowing an approach similar to the one described 
in (Declerck et al., 2014). Also, we should note 
that PoS-taggers of standard contemporary Span-
ish used in a historical variety context, perform 
below state of the art taggers (Sánchez-Marco et. 
al, 2011), which makes manual verification an 
unavoidable step.  
   In order to represent the semantic linking of the 
words in the TEI document with lexical entries in 
the lemon model of the MCR, we need to extend 
our initial TEI representation with pointing 
mechanisms associated to the TEI <relation> 
element. In Figure 5 we show how semantic 
relationships can be established between words 
in the manuscripts and external lexical resources.

sources. 
 

4 Next steps: sharing knowledge be-
tween manuscripts 

In the encoding presented in this paper, manu-
scripts are annotated, codified, and linked to ex-
ternal lexical resources. Even though several 
paleographic and graphemic relations are estab-
lished implicitly in the markup of the TEI docu-
ment, this representation of a manuscript does 
not provide semantic relationships beyond the 
ones defined at a lexical level. In order to share 
paleographic knowledge with other open re-
sources across the web, following Linked Open 
Data principles (Chiarcos et. al, 2011), a 
paleographic ontology for medieval Spanish 
documents needs to be develop. The ontology 
should capture relationships within a given 
document, between different manuscripts in a 
collection and between different collections. 
Allographs, glyphs, ligatures, word and common 
name abbreviations, contractions, acronyms, 
numbers and dates variations in notation should 

be defined at an ontological level. More general 
relationships and document data such as 
typology (legal, church, private document, etc), 
style, place of origin, manuscript collection, 
archive, author and year of the transcription,  will 
also be included in the ontology. 
   Since we are dealing with cultural heritage 
materials, existing ontologies such as the 
Functional Requirements for Bibliographic 
Records (FRBR), CIDOC Conceptual Reference 
Model (CIDOC CRM), and more directly related 
to our work, the General Ontology for Linguistic 
Description (GOLD), already define the 
terminology and some of the relationships that 
can be found in medieval manuscripts; in these 
cases classes can be directly imported and 
reused. In some other cases, classes may need to 
be created to define specific graphemic objects 
and paleographic relationships that are not 
defined in the existing ontologies.  

In the TEI representation described in this pa-
per, unique ids are given to lexical and graphem-
ic units, allowing for the automatic creation of 
URIs that can be used for external resources to 
link to it. The RDF annotation can be done fol-
lowing the example given in Figure 5 using the 
element <relation> and the relationships defined 
in the paleographic ontology. 

At a lexical level, semantic relations are estab-
lished in the TEI document via external re-
sources. Even though lexical ontologies such as 
lemon, and to some extent WordNet, define lin-
guistic relationships between lexical units, they 
may not be specific enough to describe the dif-
ferent relationships of a language with its histori-
cal varieties. Future steps in the project should 
consider adding such detailed linguistic relation-
ships. 

 

5 Conclusions 

In this paper we described the first steps towards 
the creation of an online resource of digitized 
medieval Spanish manuscripts, where graphemic, 
lexical and textual information can be retrieved 
directly from facsimiles. We have shown and 
demonstrated a method for transcribing and en-
coding in TEI P5 image data from manuscripts. 
We have described also how medieval Spanish 
can be linked to its contemporary standard and to 
the rest of the languages that integrate MCR, 
making manuscript terms retrievable using any 
of these languages. Next steps in the project in-
clude: developing a paleographic ontology of 

76



medieval Spanish, extending semantic annota-
tions at a lexical level incorporating historical 
varieties relationships, building a web interface, 
and making data available in the cloud.
