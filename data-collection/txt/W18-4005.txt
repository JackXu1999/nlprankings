Abstract

This paper illustrates the interface of the tool we developed for crowd sourcing and we explain the
annotation procedure in detail. Our tool is named as ‘Parupalli Padajaalam1’ which means web
of words by Parupalli. The aim of this tool is to populate the OntoSenseNet, sentiment polarity
annotated Telugu resource. Recent works have shown the importance of word-level annotations
on sentiment analysis. With this as basis, we aim to analyze the importance of sense-annotations
obtained from OntoSenseNet in performing the task of sentiment analysis. We explain the fea-
tures extracted from OntoSenseNet (Telugu). Furthermore we compute and explain the adverbial
class distribution of verbs in OntoSenseNet. This task is known to aid in disambiguating word-
senses which helps in enhancing the performance of word-sense disambiguation (WSD) task(s).

1 Introduction

OntoSenseNet is a lexical resource developed on the basis of Formal Ontology proposed by (Otra, 2015).
The formal ontology follows approaches developed by Yaska, Patanjali and Bhartrihari from Indian lin-
guistic traditions for understanding lexical meaning and by extending approaches developed by Leibniz
and Brentano in the modern times. Based on this proposed formal ontology, a lexical resource for Telugu
language has been developed (Parupalli and Singh, 2018) - OntoSenseNet for Telugu. The resource con-
sists of words tagged with a primary and a secondary sense-types of verbs and sense-classes of adverbs.
The sense-identification in OntoSenseNet for Telugu is manually done by experts in the field.

Sentiment analysis deals with the task of determining the polarity of text. To distinguish positive and
negative opinions in simple texts such as reviews, blogs, and news articles, sentiment analysis (or opinion
mining) is used. There are three ways in which one can perform sentiment analysis : document-level,
sentence-level, entity or word-level. These determine the polarity value considering the whole document,
sentence-wise polarity, word-wise in some given text respectively (Naidu et al., 2017).

2 Related Work

Extensive work has been done in the domain of sentiment analysis for English. We discuss few novel
and relevant approaches here. (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005) determines a new method for identifying
the opinionated words (subjective terms) in the text based on the quantitative analysis of the glosses of
such terms. (Gamon et al., 2005) present a prototype system for mining topics and sentiment orientation
jointly from free text customer feedback. (Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000) studies the role of adjec-
tives in understanding the subjectivity. (Kaji and Kitsuregawa, 2007) aims at building a polarity lexicon
from massive HTML documents. They propose a model to build a word-level polarity lexicon from the
sentence-level polarity annotations.

(Gangula and Mamidi, 2018) created corpus ”Sentiraama” for different domains like movie reviews,
song lyrics, product reviews and book reviews in Telugu. Furthermore, his work aims to determine
the performance of multi-domain sentiment analysis using reviews from several domains in Sentiraama

corpus. (Naidu et al., 2017) utilizes Telugu SentiWordNet on the news corpus to perform the task of
Sentiment Analysis. (Mukku and Mamidi, 2017) developed a polarity annotated corpus where positive,
negative, neutral polarities are assigned to 5410 sentences in the corpus collected from several sources.

(Abburi et al., 2016) proposes an approach to detect the sentiment of a song based on its multi-modality
natures (text and audio). The textual lyric features are extracted from the bag of words. By using these
features, Doc2Vec generates a single vector for every song. Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive
Bayes (NB) and a combination of both these classifiers are developed to classify the sentiment using the
textual lyric features as a part of this work.

3 Crowd-sourcing Platform

Crowd-sourcing is an online, distributed problem-solving and production model that has emerged in
recent years. Early user input can substantially improve the interaction design. Collecting input from
only a small set of participants is problematic in many design situations. To address the above discussed
problems, crowd-sourcing is widely adopted by research groups.

3.1 Add a Word
Any user can add a word to the resource. The user is prompted to enter the word, it’s gloss and a sample
sentence which shows the usage of the word. List of words received through this page are manually
reviewed before adding to our resource.

3.2 User Profiling
As shown in Figure 1, any new user who wants to do the annotations must request the login credentials.
This is necessary to control the access and avoid unauthentic annotations of the resource. Users are
requested to submit their information such as name, email ID, profession, educational background and
a score is assigned to the user based on his/her proficiency in Telugu. Score is assigned based on their
responses to few questions asked in the request credentials form. This score is used in resolving the
conflicts that may arise during annotation. For example, if any word has different tags given by different
annotators, the tag given by the annotator with higher score is considered to be accurate. Once the profile
is verified, the login credentials are sent to the user through an email.

3.3 Annotations

We use this tool to perform two kinds of annotations that are discussed as the part of this thesis.

3.3.1 Ontological Sense Annotations
After logging in, all the users are requested to go through the annotation guidelines before performing the
task. These annotation guidelines clearly explain the sense-types and sense-classes proposed. The user is
shown a word, its meanings and is prompted to choose the appropriate primary and secondary sense-type
of the verbs through the list of options available in the drop down menu as shown in figure 2. Along
with the 7 sense-type tags, the user has the liberty to tag a word(verb) as ‘uncertain’ in case of an unclear
judgment. The list of uncertain words are added to the list of the word to-be annotated. Words which
are tagged to be uncertain consistently are reviewed and removed from the resource. Similar scheme is
followed for the adjectives. In case of adjectives, the user could choose to tag the word as any of the 6
defined sense-types or tag the word as ‘uncertain’.

Figure 2: Verb annotation interface with options given to the user

3.3.2 Sentiment Polarity Annotations
In case of polarity annotations, sentiment polarities are classified into 4 labels : positive, negative, neutral
and uncertain. Positive and negative labels are given in case of positive and negative sentiments in the
word respectively. Uncertain/ambiguous label is given to words which acquire sentiment based on the
words it is used along with or it’s position in a sentence. Neutral label is given when the word has no
sentiment in it.

4 Adverbial Class Distribution of Verbs

We have extracted all the Verb-Adverb and Adverb-Verb pairs from the Telugu Wikipedia. In order to
acquire these patterns we performed the task of POS tagging2 on Wikipedia corpus. From the extracted
pairs, we noticed that there are comparatively more Adverb-Verb pairs than Verb-Adverb pairs which
align with the structure of Telugu language(RJ et al., 2008). 400 verbs and 445 adverbs are annotated
according to the formal ontology that is discussed in (Parupalli and Singh, 2018). These words formed

about 2000 Verb-Adverb and Adverb-Verb pairs. Our aim is to study the adverbial class distribution of
verbs in Telugu. (Otra, 2015) proves that such annotations help in disambiguating the word senses thus
result in improved word-sense disambiguation (WSD) task(s). This is one of the major applications of
OntoSenseNet.

In table 1, we show the adverbial class distribution of verbs in Verb-Adverb and Adverb-Verb pairs.
Adverbial sense-classes are labeled as columns and sense-types of verbs are labeled as rows. Any cell
in the table represents the percentage of a ‘sense-class’ of adverbs that modify a particular ‘sense-type’
of verbs. For example : Column-1 of 1 means 20.0% of ‘spatial’; 13.6% of ‘temporal’; 18.8% of
‘force’ and 24.4% of ‘measure’ sense-classed of adverbs modify ‘to know’ sense-type of verbs. This
shows that majority of the ‘to know’ verbs are primarily modified by adverbs with ‘measure’ sense-
class. For example : cl anipicidi (feel immensely). ‘To move’, ‘to do’ verbs are primarily modified by
‘spatial’, ‘force’ sense-class of adverbs respectively. Examples are nerug mlutu(talk in a straight forward
manner), emoanalg locistu (think emotionally). ‘Temporal’ sense-class of adverbs can modify all the
sense-types of verbs. ‘To be’ sense-type of verbs is also significantly modified by ‘force’ sense-class of
adverbs. However, ‘temporal’ and ‘measure’ sense-classes also seem to show comparable performance
in modifying ‘to be’ sense-type. We can find many such examples in Telugu language.

To Know To Move To Do To Have To Be To Cut To Bound
Spatial 20.0 % 28.5% 20 % 9.5 % 9.5 % 8.5% 4.0 %

Temporal 13.6 % 22.0 % 14.6% 20.5% 20.5 % 4.4% 4.4 %
Force 18.8 % 21.5 % 22.2% 7.2% 22.9% 6.0% 4.1%

Measure 24.4% 16.5 % 19.5% 5.2% 20.3 % 7.5% 3.8%

5 Validating Importance of Sense-annotations from OntoSenseNet on Sentiment
Analysis.

In an attempt to understand how the sense-type classification of verbs and sense-classes for adverbs could
affect sentiment analysis, we perform experiments using sense-annotations from OntoSenseNet(Telugu)
as additional features to an existing system as discussed in (Parupalli et al., 2018). We develop a bench-
mark Word2Vec approach which utilizes averaged word vectors generated from all the words in a review,
adopted from Sentiraama corpus(Gangula and Mamidi, 2018). The constructed review vector is used to
determine the benchmark accuracy for sentiment classification. To validate the importance of word-level
annotations, the following features are added to our review vectors:

5.1 Word-level Polarity Features
SentiWordNet(Das and Gambäck, 2012; Das and Bandyopadhyay, 2010; Amitava and Bandyopadhyay,
2011) is a lexical resource with sentiment polarity annotations. It has 4076 negative and 2135 positive
unigrams. (Parupalli et al., 2018) shows the importance of word-level annotations on sentiment analysis
task. The features they consider are number of positive unigrams from SentiWordNet + their anno-
tated data, number of negative unigrams from SentiWordNet + their annotated data, number of positive
bigrams, number of negative bigrams from Sentiraama (Gangula and Mamidi, 2018).

5.2 Additional Features from OntoSenseNet
Utilizing the sense-annotations from OntoSenseNet resource, we added the following features to our
review vectors:

• Verbs from OntoSenseNet are annotated with 7 sense-type tags namely- To Know, To Move, To Do,
To Have, To Be, To Cut, To Bound. We add the frequency of these sense-types in the review, to
the averaged word vector of the review. This results in addition of 7 features to the review (feature)
vector.



43

• Adverbs from OntoSenseNet are annotated with 4 sense-class tags namely- Spatial, Temporal,
Force, Measure adverbs in the review. We add the frequency of these sense-class tags to the re-
view vector. Along with features from obtained from verbs, we add these 4 features. On the whole,
we get 11 additional features from OntoSenseNet resource.

5.3 Results
2 shows results of our experiments with various classifiers. K-Nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier shows
a huge drop in accuracy after inclusion of the new features. This might be because KNN doesn’t dif-
ferentiate between the features and holds all with equal importance for classification. Hence, it fails to
ignore the probable noisy features among the newly added ones. On the other hand, Random Forest
(RF) classifier keeps learning from additional features and is good at ignoring the noisy ones. We ob-
serve an interesting trend in the accuracies i.e. performance of Linear SVM keeps decreasing and at the
same time performance of Gaussian SVM keeps increasing. This shows loss of linear separability. On
the whole, we find Neural Network (NN) to be best performing classifier when averaged over repeated
trials. However, repeated trials of the experiment show high variance. 3 shows in detail the precision,
recall, and f1-scores of Neural Network’s performance with two hidden layers of size 100 and 25 and
input vectors of 200 dimensions without additional features. The increment in accuracy over addition of
features extracted from OntoSenseNet validate our hypothesis that OntoSenseNet does contain semantic
knowledge valuable to the task of sentiment analysis.

6 Conclusion

This paper presents the tool developed for crowd-sourcing the annotations that are yet to-be done. In
the development of OntoSenseNet only 1673 adjectives out of 11,000 were annotated. Rest of these
adjectives will be annotated through crowd-sourcing approach. Additional verbs extracted from WordNet
also need annotations to be done. In sentiment analysis task, most of the unigram annotations are done
through crowd-sourcing approach. Before this tool is developed, annotations are crowd-sourced using
Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) 3. The bigrams (verb, adverb pairs) discussed in section 4 are yet
to be annotated through the tool. The adverbial class distribution of verbs is extracted from Telugu
Wikipedia that is aimed to improvise WSD tasks. We present the insights obtained from the statistics.
We validate our hypothesis that features extracted from OntoSenseNet carry relevant information that is
useful for sentiment analysis through machine learning approaches.
