Abstract

This paper describes the SemEval 2016 shared
task on Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis
(ABSA), a continuation of the respective tasks
of 2014 and 2015. In its third year, the task
provided 19 training and 20 testing datasets
for 8 languages and 7 domains, as well as a
common evaluation procedure. From these
datasets, 25 were for sentence-level and 14 for
text-level ABSA; the latter was introduced for
the first time as a subtask in SemEval. The task
attracted 245 submissions from 29 teams.

1 Introduction

Many consumers use the Web to share their experi-
ences about products, services or travel destinations
(Yoo and Gretzel, 2008). Online opinionated texts
(e.g., reviews, tweets) are important for consumer
decision making (Chevalier and Mayzlin, 2006) and
constitute a source of valuable customer feedback
that can help companies to measure satisfaction and
improve their products or services. In this setting,
Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) - i.e.,
mining opinions from text about specific entities and
their aspects (Liu, 2012) - can provide valuable in-
sights to both consumers and businesses. An ABSA

aspect of an entity.

method can analyze large amounts of unstructured
texts and extract (coarse- or fine-grained) informa-
tion not included in the user ratings that are available
in some review sites (e.g., Fig. 1).

Sentiment Analysis (SA) touches every aspect
(e.g., entity recognition, coreference resolution,
negation handling) of Natural Language Processing
(Liu, 2012) and as Cambria et al. (2013) mention “it
requires a deep understanding of the explicit and im-
plicit, regular and irregular, and syntactic and se-
mantic language rules”. Within the last few years
several SA-related shared tasks have been organized
in the context of workshops and conferences focus-

19



ing on somewhat different research problems (Seki
et al., 2007; Seki et al., 2008; Seki et al., 2010;
Mitchell, 2013; Nakov et al., 2013; Rosenthal et al.,
2014; Pontiki et al., 2014; Rosenthal et al., 2015;
Ghosh et al., 2015; Pontiki et al., 2015; Moham-
mad et al., 2016; Recupero and Cambria, 2014; Rup-
penhofer et al., 2014; Loukachevitch et al., 2015).
Such competitions provide training datasets and the
opportunity for direct comparison of different ap-
proaches on common test sets.

Currently, most of the available SA-related
datasets, whether released in the context of shared
tasks or not (Socher et al., 2013; Ganu et al., 2009),
are monolingual and usually focus on English texts.
Multilingual datasets (Klinger and Cimiano, 2014;
Jiménez-Zafra et al., 2015) provide additional ben-
efits enabling the development and testing of cross-
lingual methods (Lambert, 2015). Following this di-
rection, this year the SemEval ABSA task provided
datasets in a variety of languages.

ABSAwas introduced as a shared task for the first
time in the context of SemEval in 2014; SemEval-
2014 Task 41 (SE-ABSA14) provided datasets of
English reviews annotated at the sentence level with
aspect terms (e.g., “mouse”, “pizza”) and their po-
larity for the laptop and restaurant domains, as well
as coarser aspect categories (e.g., “food”) and their
polarity only for restaurants (Pontiki et al., 2014).
SemEval-2015 Task 122 (SE-ABSA15) built upon
SE-ABSA14 and consolidated its subtasks into a
unified framework in which all the identified con-
stituents of the expressed opinions (i.e., aspects,
opinion target expressions and sentiment polarities)
meet a set of guidelines and are linked to each other
within sentence-level tuples (Pontiki et al., 2015).
These tuples are important since they indicate the
part of text within which a specific opinion is ex-
pressed. However, a user might also be interested
in the overall rating of the text towards a partic-
ular aspect. Such ratings can be used to estimate
the mean sentiment per aspect from multiple re-
views (McAuley et al., 2012). Therefore, in addition
to sentence-level annotations, SE-ABSA163 accom-
modated also text-level ABSA annotations and pro-
vided the respective training and testing data. Fur-

thermore, the SE-ABSA15 annotation framework
was extended to new domains and applied to lan-
guages other than English (Arabic, Chinese, Dutch,
French, Russian, Spanish, and Turkish).

The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows: the task set-up is described in Section 2. Sec-
tion 3 provides information about the datasets and
the annotation process, while Section 4 presents the
evaluation measures and the baselines. General in-
formation about participation in the task is provided
in Section 5. The evaluation scores of the participat-
ing systems are presented and discussed in Section
6. The paper concludes with an overall assessment
of the task.

2 Task Description

The SE-ABSA16 task consisted of the following
subtasks and slots. Participants were free to choose
the subtasks, slots, domains and languages they
wished to participate in.
Subtask 1 (SB1): Sentence-level ABSA. Given

an opinionated text about a target entity, identify all
the opinion tuples with the following types (tuple
slots) of information:

• Slot1: Aspect Category. Identification of the
entity E and attribute A pairs towards which
an opinion is expressed in a given sentence. E
and A should be chosen from predefined in-
ventories4 of entity types (e.g., “restaurant”,
“food”) and attribute labels (e.g., “price”,
“quality”).

• Slot2: Opinion Target Expression (OTE).
Extraction of the linguistic expression used in
the given text to refer to the reviewed entity E
of each E#A pair. The OTE is defined by its
starting and ending offsets. When there is no
explicit mention of the entity, the slot takes the
value “null”. The identification of Slot2 val-
ues was required only in the restaurants, hotels,
museums and telecommunications domains.

• Slot3: Sentiment Polarity. Each identified
E#A pair has to be assigned one of the following
polarity labels: “positive”, “negative”, “neu-
tral” (mildly positive or mildly negative).

4The full inventories of the aspect category labels for each
domain are provided in Appendix A.

Table 1: Datasets provided for SE-ABSA16.

An example of opinion tuples with Slot1-3 values
from the restaurants domain is shown below: “Their
sake list was extensive, but we were looking for Pur-
ple Haze, which wasn’t listed but made for us upon
request!” → {cat: “drinks#style_options”, trg:
“sake list”, fr: “6”, to: “15”, pol: “positive”}, {cat:
“service#general”, trg: “null”, fr: “0”, to: “0”,
pol: “positive”}. The variable cat indicates the as-
pect category (Slot1), pol the polarity (Slot3), and
trg the ote (Slot2); fr, to are the starting/ending
offsets of ote.
Subtask 2 (SB2): Text-level ABSA. Given a cus-

tomer review about a target entity, the goal was
to identify a set of {cat, pol} tuples that summa-
rize the opinions expressed in the review. cat can
be assigned the same values as in SB1 (E#A tu-
ple), while pol can be set to “positive”, “negative”,
“neutral”, or “conflict”. For example, for the re-
view text “The So called laptop Runs to Slow and
I hate it! Do not buy it! It is the worst laptop
ever ”, a system should return the following opin-
ion tuples: {cat: “laptop#general”, pol: “nega-
tive”}, {cat: “laptop#operation_performance”,
pol: “negative”} .
Subtask 3 (SB3): Out-of-domain ABSA. In SB3

participants had the opportunity to test their systems

in domains for which no training data was made
available; the domains remained unknown until the
start of the evaluation period. Test data for SB3 were
provided only for the museums domain in French.

3 Datasets

3.1 Data Collection and Annotation

A total of 39 datasets were provided in the context of
the SE-ABSA16 task; 19 for training and 20 for test-
ing. The texts were from 7 domains and 8 languages;
English (en), Arabic (ar), Chinese (ch), Dutch (du),
French (fr), Russian (ru), Spanish (es) and Turk-
ish (tu). The datasets for the domains of restaurants
(rest), laptops (lapt), mobile phones (phns), digital
cameras (came), hotels (hote) and museums (muse)
consist of customer reviews, whilst the telecommu-
nication domain (telc) data consists of tweets. A to-
tal of 70790 manually annotated ABSA tuples were
provided for training and testing; 47654 sentence-
level annotations (SB1) in 8 languages for 7 do-
mains, and 23136 text-level annotations (SB2) in 6
languages for 3 domains. Table 1 provides more in-
formation on the distribution of texts, sentences and
annotated tuples per dataset.

The rest, hote, and lapt datasets were annotated

21



at the sentence-level (SB1) following the respective
annotation schemas of SE-ABSA15 (Pontiki et al.,
2015). Below are examples5 of annotated sentences
for the aspect category “service#general” in en
(1), du (2), fr (3), ru (4), es (5), and tu (6) for the
rest domain and in ar (7) for the hote domain:

1. Service was slow, but the people were friendly.
→ {trg: “Service”, pol: “negative”}, {trg:
“people”, pol: “positive”}

2. Snelle bediening en vriendelijk personeel moet
ook gemeld worden!! → {trg: “bediening”,
pol: “positive”}, {trg: “personeel”, pol: “posi-
tive”}

3. Le service est impeccable, personnel agréable.
→ {trg: “service” , pol: “positive”}, {trg: “per-
sonnel”, pol: “positive”}

4. Про сервис ничего негативного не скажешь-
быстро подходят, все улябаются, подходят
спрашивают, всё ли нравится. → {trg:
“сервис”, pol: “neutral” }

5. También la rapidez en el servicio. → {trg: “ser-
vicio”, pol: “positive” }

6. Servisi hızlı valesi var. → {trg: “Servisi”, pol:
“positive”}

7. .. سریعة و جدا جیدة الخدمة → {trg: “الخدمة” , pol:
“positive”}

The lapt annotation schema was extended to two
other domains of consumer electronics, came and
phns. Examples of annotated sentences in the lapt
(en), phns (du and ch) and came (ch) domains are
shown below:

1. It is extremely portable and easily connects to
WIFI at the library and elsewhere. → {cat:
“laptop#portability”, pol: “positive”} , {cat:
“laptop#connectivity”, pol: “positive”}

2. Apps starten snel op en werken
vlot, internet gaat prima. → {cat:
“software#operation_performance”, pol:
“positive”}, {cat: “phone#connectivity”,
pol: “positive”}

5The offsets of the opinion target expressions are omitted.

3. 当然屏幕这么好→{cat: “display#quality”,
pol: “positive”}

4. 更 轻 便 的 机 身 也 便 于 携 带。→ {cat:
“camera# portability”, pol: “positive”}

In addition, the SE-ABSA15 framework was ex-
tended to two new domains for which annotation
guidelines were compiled: telc for tu and muse for
fr. Below are two examples:

1. #Internet kopuyor sürekli :( @turkcell → {cat:
“internet#coverage”, trg: “Internet”, pol:
“positive”}

2. 5€ pour les étudiants, ça vaut le coup. → {cat:
“museum#prices”, “null”, “positive”}

The text-level (SB2) annotation task was based
on the sentence-level annotations; given a customer
review about a target entity (e.g., a restaurant) that
included sentence-level annotations of ABSA tu-
ples, the goal was to identify a set of {cat, pol}
tuples that summarize the opinions expressed in it.
This was not a simple summation/aggregation of the
sentence-level annotations since an aspect may be
discussed with different sentiment in different parts
of the review. In such cases the dominant sentiment
had to be identified. In case of conflicting opin-
ions where the dominant sentiment was not clear, the
”conflict” label was assigned. In addition, each re-
view was assigned an overall sentiment label about
the target entity (e.g., “restaurant#general”,
“laptop#general”), even if it was not included in
the sentence-level annotations.

3.2 Annotation Process
All datasets for each language were prepared by one
or more research groups as shown in Table 2. The
en, du, fr, ru and es datasets were annotated using
brat (Stenetorp et al., 2012), a web-based annota-
tion tool, which was configured appropriately for the
needs of the task. The tu datasets were annotated us-
ing a customized version of turksent (Eryigit et al.,
2013), a sentiment annotation tool for social media.
For the ar and the ch data in-house tools6 were used.

6The ar annotation tool was developed by the technical
team of the Advanced Arabic Text Mining group at Jordan Uni-
versity of Science and Technology. The ch tool was developed
by the Research Center for Social Computing and Information
Retrieval at Harbin Institute of Technology.

Below are some further details about the annotation
process for each language.
English. The SE-ABSA15 (Pontiki et al., 2015)

training and test datasets (with some minor correc-
tions) were merged and provided for training (rest
and lapt domains). New data was collected and an-
notated from scratch for testing. In a first phase, the
rest test data was annotated by an experienced7 lin-
guist (annotator A), and the lapt data by 5 under-
graduate computer science students. The resulting
annotations for both domains were then inspected
and corrected (if needed) by a second expert linguist,
one of the task organizers (annotator B). Borderline
cases were resolved collaboratively by annotators A
and B.
Arabic. The hote dataset was annotated in re-

peated cycles. In a first phase, the data was annotated
by three native Arabic speakers, all with a computer
science background; then the output was validated
by a senior researcher, one of the task organizers. If
needed (e.g. when inconsistencies were found) they
were given back to the annotators.
Chinese. The datasets presented by Zhao et al.

(2015) were re-annotated by three native Chinese
speakers according to the SE-ABSA16 annotation
schema and were provided for training and testing
(phns and came domains).
Dutch. The rest and phns datasets (De Clercq

and Hoste, 2016) were initially annotated by a
trained linguist, native speaker of Dutch. Then,
the output was verified by another Dutch linguist
and disagreements were resolved between them. Fi-

7Also annotator for SE-ABSA14 and 15.

nally, the task organizers inspected collaboratively
all the annotated data and corrections were made
when needed.
French. The train (rest) and test (rest, muse)

datasets were annotated from scratch by a linguist,
native speaker of French. When the annotator was
not confident, a decision was made collaboratively
with the organizers. In a second phase, the task or-
ganizers checked all the annotations for mistakes and
inconsistencies and corrected them, when necessary.
For more information on the French datasets consult
Apidianaki et al. (2016).
Russian. The rest datasets of the SentiRuEval-

2015 task (Loukachevitch et al., 2015) were auto-
matically converted to the SE-ABSA16 annotation
schema; then a linguist, native speaker of Russian,
checked them and added missing information. Fi-
nally, the datasets were inspected by a second lin-
guist annotator (also native speaker of Russian) for
mistakes and inconsistencies, which were resolved
along with one of the task organizers.
Spanish. Initially, 50 texts (134 sentences) from

the whole available data were annotated by 4 annota-
tors. The inter-anotator agreement (IAA) in terms of
F-1 was 91% for the identification of OTE, 88% for
the aspect category detection (E#A pair), and 80%
for opinion tuples extraction (E#A, OTE, polarity).
Provided that the IAA was substantially high for all
slots, the rest of the data was divided into 4 parts and
each one was annotated by a different native Spanish
speakers (2 linguists and 2 software engineers). Sub-
sequently, the resulting annotations were validated
and corrected (if needed) by the task organizers.

23



Turkish. The telc dataset was based on the data
used in (Yıldırım et al., 2015), while the rest dataset
was created from scratch. Both datasets were anno-
tated simultaneously by two linguists. Then, one of
the organizers validated/inspected the resulting an-
notations and corrected them when needed.

3.3 Datasets Format and Availability

Similarly to SE-ABSA14 and SE-ABSA15, the
datasets8 of SE-ABSA16 were provided in an XML
format and they are available under specific license
terms through META-SHARE9, a repository de-
voted to the sharing and dissemination of language
resources (Piperidis, 2012).

4 Evaluation Measures and Baselines

The evaluation ran in two phases. In the first phase
(Phase A), the participants were asked to return
separately the aspect categories (Slot1), the OTEs
(Slot2), and the {Slot1, Slot2} tuples for SB1. For
SB2 the respective text-level categories had to be
identified. In the second phase (Phase B), the gold
annotations for the test sets of Phase A were pro-
vided and participants had to return the respective
sentiment polarity values (Slot3). Similarly to SE-
ABSA15, F-1 scores were calculated for Slot1, Slot2
and {Slot1, Slot2} tuples, by comparing the anno-
tations that a system returned to the gold annota-
tions (using micro-averaging). For Slot1 evaluation,
duplicate occurrences of categories were ignored in
both SB1 and SB2. For Slot2, the calculation for
each sentence considered only distinct targets and
discarded “null” targets, since they do not corre-
spond to explicit mentions. To evaluate sentiment
polarity classification (Slot3) in Phase B, we calcu-
lated the accuracy of each system, defined as the
number of correctly predicted polarity labels of the
(gold) aspect categories, divided by the total num-
ber of the gold aspect categories. Furthermore, we
implemented and provided baselines for all slots of
SB1 and SB2. In particular, the SE-ABSA15 base-
lines that were implemented for the English language

8The data are available at: http://metashare.ilsp.
gr:8080/repository/search/?q=semeval+2016

9META-SHARE (http://www.metashare.org/) was
implemented in the framework of the META-NET Network of
Excellence (http://www.meta-net.eu/).

(Pontiki et al., 2015), were adapted for the other lan-
guages by using appropriate stopword lists and to-
kenization functions. The baselines are briefly dis-
cussed below:
SB1-Slot1: For category (E#A) extraction, a Sup-

port Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel is
trained. In particular, n unigram features are ex-
tracted from the respective sentence of each tuple
that is encountered in the training data. The cat-
egory value (e.g., “service#general”) of the tu-
ple is used as the correct label of the feature vec-
tor. Similarly, for each test sentence s, a fea-
ture vector is built and the trained SVM is used
to predict the probabilities of assigning each possi-
ble category to s (e.g., {“service#general”, 0.2},
{“restaurant#general”, 0.4}. Then, a thresh-
old10 t is used to decide which of the categories will
be assigned11 to s. As features, we use the 1,000
most frequent unigrams of the training data exclud-
ing stopwords.
SB1-Slot2: The baseline uses the training

reviews to create for each category c (e.g.,
“service#general”) a list of OTEs (e.g.,
“service#general” → {“staff”, “waiter”}).
These are extracted from the (training) opinion
tuples whose category value is c . Then, given a test
sentence s and an assigned category c, the baseline
finds in s the first occurrence of each OTE of c’s
list. The OTE slot is filled with the first of the target
occurrences found in s. If no target occurrences are
found, the slot is assigned the value “null”.
SB1-Slot3: For polarity prediction we trained a

SVM classifier with a linear kernel. Again, as in
Slot1, n unigram features are extracted from the re-
spective sentence of each tuple of the training data.
In addition, an integer-valued feature12 that indicates
the category of the tuple is used. The correct label
for the extracted training feature vector is the corre-
sponding polarity value (e.g., “positive”). Then, for
each tuple {category, OTE} of a test sentence s, a
feature vector is built and classified using the trained
SVM.
SB2-Slot1: The sentence-level tuples returned by

the SB1 baseline are copied to the text level and du-
plicates are removed.

10The threshold t was set to 0.2 for all datasets.
11We use the –b 1 option of LibSVM to obtain probabilities.
12Each E#A pair has been assigned a distinct integer value.

Table 3: English REST results for SB1.

SB2-Slot3: For each text-level aspect category c
the baseline traverses the predicted sentence-level
tuples of the same category returned by the respec-
tive SB1 baseline and counts the polarity labels (pos-
itive, negative, neutral). Finally, the polarity label
with the highest frequency is assigned to the text-
level category c. If there are no sentence-level tuples
for the same c, the polarity label is determined based
on all tuples regardless of c.

The baseline systems and evaluation scripts are
implemented in Java and are available for down-
load from the SE-ABSA16 website13. The LibSVM
package14 (Chang and Lin, 2011) is used for SVM
training and prediction. The scores of the baselines

in the test datasets are presented in Section 6 along
with the system scores.

5 Participation

The task attracted in total 245 submissions from 29
teams. The majority of the submissions (216 runs)
were for SB1. The newly introduced SB2 attracted
29 submissions from 5 teams in 2 languages (en and
sp). Most of the submissions (168) were runs for
the rest domain. This was expected, mainly for two
reasons; first, the rest classification schema is less
fine-grained (complex) compared to the other do-
mains (e.g., lapt). Secondly, this domain was sup-
ported for 6 languages enabling also multilingual or
language-agnostic approaches. The remaining sub-
missions were distributed as follows: 54 in lapt, 12
in phns, 7 in came and 4 in hote.

Table 4: REST and HOTE results for SB1.

An interesting observation is that, unlike SE-
ABSA15, Slot1 (aspect category detection) attracted
significantly more submissions than Slot2 (OTE ex-
traction); this may indicate a shift towards concept-
level approaches. Regarding participation per lan-
guage, the majority of the submissions (156/245)
were for en; see more information in Table 5. Most
teams (20) submitted results only for one language
(18 for en and 2 for ru). Of the remaining teams,
3 submitted results for 2 languages, 5 teams submit-
ted results for 3-7 languages, while only one team
participated in all languages.

The evaluation results are presented in Tables 3
(SB1: rest-en), 4 (SB1: rest-es, fr, ru, du, tu
& hote-ar), 6 (SB1: lapt, came, phns), and 7
(SB2)15. Each participating team was allowed to
submit up to two runs per slot and domain in each
phase; one constrained (C), where only the provided
training data could be used, and one unconstrained
(U), where other resources (e.g., publicly available

lexica) and additional data of any kind could be used
for training. In the latter case, the teams had to re-
port the resources used. Delayed submissions (i.e.,
runs submitted after the deadline and the release of
the gold annotations) are marked with “*”.

As revealed by the results, in both SB1 and SB2
the majority of the systems surpassed the baseline
by a small or large margin and, as expected, the un-
constrained systems achieved better results than the
constrained ones. In SB1, the teams with the high-
est scores for Slot1 and Slot2 achieved similar F-1
scores (see Table 3) in most cases (e.g., en/rest,
es/rest, du/rest, fr/rest), which shows that the
two slots have a similar level of difficulty. How-
ever, as expected, the {Slot1, Slot2} scores were sig-
nificantly lower since the linking of the target ex-
pressions to the corresponding aspects is also re-
quired. The highest scores in SB1 for all slots (Slot1,
Slot2, {Slot1, Slot2}, Slot3) were achieved in the
en/rest; this is probably due to the high participation
and to the lower complexity of the rest annotation
schema compared to the other domains. If we com-
pare the results for SB1 and SB2, we notice that the
SB2 scores for Slot1 are significantly higher (e.g.,
en/lapt, en/rest, es/rest) even though the respec-
tive annotations are for the same (or almost the same)
set of texts. This is due to the fact that it is easier to
identify whether a whole text discusses an aspect c
than finding all the sentences in the text discussing
c . On the other hand, for Slot3, the SB2 scores are
lower (e.g., en/rest, es/rest, ru/rest, en/lapt) than
the respective SB1 scores. This is mainly because an
aspect may be discussed at different points in a text
and often with different sentiment. In such cases a
system has to identify the dominant sentiment, which

7 Conclusions

In its third year, the SemEval ABSA task provided
19 training and 20 testing datasets, from 7 domains
and 8 languages, attracting 245 submissions from
29 teams. The use of the same annotation guide-
lines for domains addressed in different languages
gives the opportunity to experiment also with cross-
lingual or language-agnostic approaches. In addi-
tion, SE-ABSA16 included for the first time a text-

the enrichment of the annotation schemas with other
types of SA-related information like topics, events
and figures of speech (e.g., irony, metaphor).
