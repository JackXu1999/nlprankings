Abstract

Most state-of-the-art models for named en-
tity recognition (NER) rely on the availabil-
ity of large amounts of labeled data, mak-
ing them challenging to extend to new, lower-
resourced languages. However, there are now
several proposed approaches involving either
cross-lingual transfer learning, which learns
from other highly resourced languages, or ac-
tive learning, which efficiently selects effec-
tive training data based on model predictions.
This paper poses the question: given this re-
cent progress, and limited human annotation,
what is the most effective method for effi-
ciently creating high-quality entity recognizers
in under-resourced languages? Based on ex-
tensive experimentation using both simulated
and real human annotation, we find a dual-
strategy approach best, starting with a cross-
lingual transferred model, then performing tar-
geted annotation of only uncertain entity spans
in the target language, minimizing annotator
effort. Results demonstrate that cross-lingual
transfer is a powerful tool when very little data
can be annotated, but an entity-targeted anno-
tation strategy can achieve competitive accu-
racy quickly, with just one-tenth of training
data. The code is publicly available here.1

1 Introduction

Named entity recognition (NER) is the task of de-
tecting and classifying named entities in text into
a fixed set of pre-defined categories (person, loca-
tion, etc.) with several downstream applications
including machine reading (Chen et al., 2017), en-
tity and event co-reference (Yang and Mitchell,
2016), and text mining (Han and Sun, 2012). Re-
cent advances in deep learning have yielded state-
of-the-art performance on many sequence label-
ing tasks, including NER (Collobert et al., 2011;

EntityTargetedActiveLearning

Ma and Hovy, 2016; Lample et al., 2016; Pe-
ters et al., 2018). However, the performance of
these models is highly dependent on the availabil-
ity of large amounts of annotated data, and as a
result their accuracy is significantly lower on lan-
guages that have fewer resources than English. In
this work, we ask the question “how can we effi-
ciently bootstrap a high-quality named entity rec-
ognizer for a low-resource language with only a
small amount of human effort?” Specifically, we
leverage recent advances in data-efficient learning
for low-resource languages, proposing the follow-
ing “recipe” for bootstrapping low-resource entity
recognizers: First, we use cross-lingual transfer
learning (Yarowsky et al., 2001; Ammar et al.,
2016), which applies a model trained on another
language to low-resource languages, to provide
a good preliminary model to start the bootstrap-
ping process. Specifically, we use the model of
Xie et al. (2018), which reports strong results on
a number of language pairs. Next, on top of this
transferred model we further employ active learn-
ing (Settles and Craven, 2008; Marcheggiani and
Artieres, 2014), which helps improve annotation
efficiency by using model predictions to select in-
formative, rather than random, data for human an-
notators. Finally, the model is fine-tuned on data
obtained using active learning to improve accuracy
in the target language.

Within this recipe, the choice of specific method
for choosing and annotating data within active
learning is highly important to minimize human
effort. One relatively standard method used in
previous work on NER is to select full sequences
based on a criterion for the uncertainty of the en-
tities recognized therein (Culotta and McCallum,
2005). However, as it is often the case that only a
single entity within the sentence may be of inter-
est, it can still be tedious and wasteful to annotate
full sequences when only a small portion of the

Figure 1: Our proposed recipe: cross-lingual transfer is used for projecting annotations from an English labeled
dataset to the target language. Entity-targeted active learning is then used to select informative sub-spans which
are likely entities for humans to annotate. Finally, the NER model is fine-tuned on this partially-labeled dataset.

sentence is of interest (Neubig et al., 2011; Sper-
ber et al., 2014). Inspired by this finding and con-
sidering the fact that named entities are both im-
portant and sparse, we propose an entity-targeted
strategy to save annotator effort. Specifically, we
select uncertain subspans of tokens within a se-
quence that are most likely named entities. This
way, the annotators only need to assign types to
the chosen subspans without having to read and
annotate the full sequence. To cope with the re-
sulting partial annotation of sequences, we apply
a constrained version of conditional random fields
(CRFs), partial CRFs, during training that only
learn from the annotated subspans (Tsuboi et al.,
2008; Wanvarie et al., 2011).

To evaluate our proposed methods, we con-
ducted simulated active learning experiments on
5 languages: Spanish, Dutch, German, Hindi and
Indonesian. Additionally, to study our method
in a more practical setting, we conduct human
annotation experiments on two low-resource lan-
guages, Indonesian and Hindi, and one simulated
low-resource language, Spanish. In sum, this pa-
per makes the following contributions:

1. We present a bootstrapping recipe for im-
proving low-resource NER. With just one-
tenth of tokens annotated, our proposed
entity-targeted active learning method pro-
vides the best results among all active learn-
ing baselines, with an average improvement
of 9.9 F1.

2. Through simulated experiments, we show
that cross-lingual transfer is a powerful tool,
outperforming the un-transferred systems by
an average of 8.6 F1 with only one-tenth of
tokens annotated.

3. Human annotation experiments show that an-
notators are more accurate in annotating enti-
ties when using the entity-targeted strategy as
opposed to full sequence annotation. More-
over, this strategy minimizes annotator effort
by requiring them to label fewer tokens than
the full-sequence annotation.

2 Approach

As noted in the introduction, our bootstrapping
recipe consists of three components (1) cross-
lingual transfer learning, (2) active learning to se-
lect relevant parts of the data to annotate, and (3)
fine-tuning of the model on these annotated seg-
ments. Steps (2) and (3) are continued until the
model has achieved an acceptable level of accu-
racy, or until we have exhausted our annotation
budget. The system overview can be seen in Fig-
ure 1. In the following sections, we describe each
of these three steps in detail.

2.1 Cross-lingual Transfer Learning

The goal of cross-lingual learning is to take a rec-
ognizer trained in a source language, and transfer
it to a target language. Our approach to doing so
for NER follows that of Xie et al. (2018), and we
provide a brief review in this section.

To begin with, we assume access to two sets of
pre-trained monolingual word embeddings in the
source and target languages, X and Y , one small
bilingual lexicon, either provided or obtained in an
unsupervised manner (Artetxe et al., 2017; Con-
neau et al., 2017a), and labeled training data in
the source language. Using these resources, we
train bilingual word embeddings (BWE) to create
a word-to-word translation dictionary, and finally



5166

use this dictionary to translate the source training
data into the target language, which we use to train
an NER model.

To learn BWE, we first obtain a linear mapping
W by solving the following objective:

W ∗ = arg min
W

‖WXD−YD‖F s.t. WW> = I,

where XD and YD correspond to the aligned word
embeddings from the bilingual lexicon. F denotes
the Frobenius norm. We can first compute the sin-
gular value decomposition Y TDXD = U

∑
V >,

and solve the objective by takingW ∗ = UV >. We
obtain BWE by linearly transforming the source
and target monolingual word embeddings with U
and V , namely XU and Y V .

After obtaining the BWE, we find the nearest
neighbor target word for every source word in
the BWE space using the cross-domain similar-
ity local scaling (CSLS) metric (Conneau et al.,
2017b), which produces a word-to-word transla-
tion dictionary. We use this dictionary to translate
the source training data into the target language,
and simply copy the label for each word, which
yields transferred training data in the target lan-
guage. We train an NER model on this transferred
data as our preliminary model. Going forward, we
refer to the use of cross-lingual transferred data as
CT.

2.2 Entity-Targeted Active Learning
After training a model using cross-lingual transfer
learning, we start the active learning process based
on this model’s outputs. We begin by training a
NER model Θ using the above model’s outputs as
training data. Using this trained model, our pro-
posed entity-targeted active learning strategy, re-
ferred as ETAL, then selects the most informative
spans from a corpus D of unlabeled sequences.
Given an unlabeled sequence s, ETAL first selects
a span of tokens sji = si · · · sj such that s

j
i is a

likely named entity, where i, j ∈ [0, |s|]. Then, in
order to obtain highly informative spans across D,
ETAL computes the entropyH for each occurrence
of the span sji in D and then aggregates them over
the entire corpus D, given by:

Haggregate(s
j
i ) =

∑
xji∈D

H(xji )1(x
j
i = s

j
i )

where x is an unlabeled sequence in D. Finally,
the spans sji with the highest aggregate uncertainty
Haggregate are selected for manual annotation.

We now describe the procedure for calculating
H(xji ), which is the entropy of a span x

j
i being

a likely entity. Given an unlabeled sequence x,
the trained NER model Θ is used for computing
the marginal probabilities pθ(yi|x) for each to-
ken xi across all possible labels yi ∈ Y using
the forward-backward algorithm (Rabiner, 1989),
where Y is the set of all labels. Using these
marginals we calculate the entropy of a given span
xji being an entity as shown in Algorithm 1.

Algorithm 1 Entity-Targeted Active Learning
1: B← label-set denoting beginning of an entity
2: I← label-set denoting inside of an entity
3: O← outside of an entity span
4: pθ(yi|x)← marginal probability of label yi
5: for token xi
6:

7: for i← 1...len(x), j = 1 do
8: pijspan =

∑
y∈B pθ(yi|x)

9: for j ← i+ 1...len(x) do
10: pentity = p

ij
span ∗ pθ(Oj |x)

11: H = entropy (pentity)
12: if H > Hthreshold then
13: Haggregate(x

j
i )+ = H

14: pijspan = p
ij
span ∗

∑
y∈I pθ(yj |x)

Let B denote the set of labels indicating begin-
ning of an entity, I the set of labels indicating in-
side of an entity and O denoting outside of an en-
tity. First, we compute the probability of a span
xji being an entity, starting with the token i, by
marginalizing pθ(yi|x) over all labels in B, de-
noted as pijspan. Since an entity can span multiple
tokens, for each subsequent token j being part of
that entity, we marginalize pθ(yj |x) over all labels
in I and combine it with pijspan. Finally, we com-
pute pentity = p

ij
span ∗ pθ(Oj |x), which denotes

end of a likely entity. Since we use the marginal
probability for computing pentity, it already fac-
tors in the transition probability between tags.
Thus, any invalid sequences such as BPERIORG
have low scores. Since contiguous spans have
overlapping tokens, using dynamic programming
(DP) to compute pijspan avoids an exponential com-
putation when considering all possible spans in a
sequence. Using pentity, we compute the entropy
H and only consider the spans having H higher
than a pre-defined threshold Hthreshold. The rea-
son for this thresholding is purely for computa-
tional purposes as it allows us to discard all spans



5167

that have a very low probability of being an en-
tity, keeping the number of spans actually stored in
memory low. As mentioned above, we aggregate
the entropy of spans Haggregate over the entire un-
labeled set, thus combining uncertainty sampling
with a bias towards high frequency entities.

Using this strategy, we select subspans in each
sequence for annotation. The annotator only needs
to assign named entity types to the chosen sub-
spans, adjust the span boundary if needed, and ig-
nore the rest of the sequence, saving much effort.

2.3 Training the NER model

With the newly obtained training data from active
learning, we attempt to improve the original trans-
ferred model. In this section, we first describe
our model architecture, and try to address: 1) how
to train the NER model effectively with partially
annotated sequences? 2) what training scheme is
best suited to improve the transferred model?

2.3.1 Model Architecture
Our NER model is a BiLSTM-CNN-CRF model
based on Ma and Hovy (2016) consisting of: a
character-level CNN, that allows the model to cap-
ture subword information; a word-level BiLSTM,
that consumes word embeddings and produces
context sensitive hidden representations; and a
linear-chain CRF layer that models the depen-
dency between labels for inference. We use the
above model for training the initial NER model on
the transferred data as well as for re-training the
model on the data acquired from active learning.

2.3.2 PARTIAL-CRF
Active learning with span-based strategies such
as ETAL, produces a training dataset of partially
labeled sequences. To train the NER model on
these partially labeled sequences, we take inspi-
ration from Bellare and McCallum (2007); Tsuboi
et al. (2008) and use a constrained CRF decoder.
Normally, CRF computes the likelihood of a label
sequence y given a sequence x as follows:

pθ(y|x) =
∏T
t=1 ψi(yt−1, yt,x, t)

Z(x)

Z(x) =
∑

y∈Y(T )

T∏
t=1

ψi(yt−1, yt,x, t)

where T is the length of the sequence, Y(T )
denotes the set of all possible label sequences with

length T , andψi(yt−1, yt,x) = exp(WTyt−1,ytxi+
byt−1,yt) is the energy function. To compute
the likelihood of a sequence where some labels
are unknown, we use a constrained CRF which
marginalizes out the un-annotated tokens. Specif-
ically, let YL denote the set of all possible se-
quences that include the partial annotations (for
un-annotated tokens, all labels are possible), and
we compute the likelihood as: pθ(YL|x) =∑

y∈YL pθ(y|x), referred as PARTIAL-CRF.

2.3.3 Training Scheme
To improve our model with the newly labeled data,
we directly fine-tune the initial model, trained on
the transferred data, on the data acquired through
active learning, referred as FINETUNE. Each ac-
tive learning run produces more labeled data, for
which this training procedure is repeated again.
We also compare the NER performance using
two other training schemes: CORPUSAUG, where
we train the model on the concatenated corpus
of transferred data and the newly acquired data,
and CORPUSAUG+FINETUNE, where we additionally
fine-tune the model trained using CORPUSAUG on
just the newly acquired data.

3 Experiments

In this section, we evaluate the effectiveness of
our proposed strategy in both simulated (§3.2) and
human-annotation experiments (§3.3).

3.1 Experimental Settings
Datasets: The first evaluation set includes the
benchmark CoNLL 2002 and 2003 NER datasets
(Tjong Kim Sang, 2002; Tjong Kim Sang and
De Meulder, 2003) for Spanish (from the Ro-
mance family), Dutch and German (like English,
from the Germanic family). We use the stan-
dard corpus splits for train/dev/test. The sec-
ond evaluation set is for the low-resource setting
where we use the Indonesian (from the Austrone-
sian family), Hindi (from the Indo-Aryan fam-
ily) and Spanish datasets released by the Lin-
guistic Data Consortium (LDC).2 We generate the
train/dev/test split by random sampling. Details of
the corpus statistics are in the Appendix.

English-transferred Data: We use the same ex-
perimental settings and resources as described in
Xie et al. (2018) to get the translations of the En-
glish training data for each target language.

5168

Active Learning Setup: As described in Sec-
tion §2.2, a DP-based algorithm is employed to
select the uncertain entity spans which runs for all
n-grams having length <= 5. This length was ap-
proximated by computing the 90th percentile on
the length of entities in the English training data.
Hthreshold is a hyper-parameter set to 1e-8. The
details of the NER model hyper-parameters can be
found in the Appendix.

3.2 Simulation Experiments

Setup: We use cross-lingual transfer (§2.1) to
train our initial NER model and test on the tar-
get language. This is the same setting as Xie et al.
(2018) and serves as our baseline. Then we use
several active learning strategies to select data for
manual annotation using this trained NER model.
We compare our proposed ETAL strategy with the
following baseline strategies:

SAL: Select whole sequences for which the
model has least confidence in the most likely la-
beling (Culotta and McCallum, 2005).

CFEAL: Select least confident spans within a
sequence using the confidence field estimation
method (Culotta and McCallum, 2004).

RAND: Select spans randomly from the unla-
beled set for annotation.

In this experimental setting, we simulate man-
ual annotation by using gold labels for the data
selected by active learning. At each subsequent
run, we annotate 200 tokens and fine-tune the NER
model on all the data acquired so far, which is then
used to select data for the next run of annotation.

3.2.1 Results
Figure 2 summarizes the results for all datasets
across the different experimental settings. Each
data-point on the x-axis corresponds to the NER
performance after annotating 200 additional to-
kens. CT denotes using cross-lingual transferred
data to train the initial NER model for both kick-
starting the active learning process and also for
fine-tuning the NER model on the newly-acquired
data. PARTIAL-CRF/FULL-CRF denote the type of
CRF decoder used in the NER model. Through-
out this paper, we report results averaged across
all active learning runs unless otherwise noted. In-
dividual scores are reported in the Appendix.

As can be seen in the figure, our proposed recipe
ETAL+PARTIAL-CRF+CT outperforms the previous

active learning baselines for all the datasets. Hold-
ing the other two components of CT and PARTIAL-
CRF constant, we conduct experiments to compare
the different active learning strategies, which are
denoted by the solid lines in Figure 2. We see that
ETAL outperforms the other strategies by a signif-
icant margin for both the CoNLL datasets: Ger-
man (+6.1 F1), Spanish (+5.3 F1), Dutch (+6.3 F1)
and the LDC datasets: Hindi (+9.3 F1), Indonesian
(+9.0 F1), Spanish (+7.5 F1), at the end of all runs.
Furthermore, even with just one-tenth annotated
tokens, the proposed recipe is only (avg.) -5.2 F1
behind the model trained using all labeled data,
denoted by SUPERVISED ALL. Although CFEAL
also selects informative spans, ETAL outperforms
it because ETAL is optimized to select likely en-
tities, causing more entities to be annotated for
Hindi (+43), Indonesian (+207), Spanish-CoNLL
(+1579), German (+906), Dutch (+836), except
for Spanish-LDC (-184). Despite fully labeled
data being adding in SAL, ETAL outperforms it be-
cause SAL selects longer sentences with fewer en-
tities: Hindi (-934), Indonesian (-1290), Spanish-
LDC (-527), Spanish-CoNLL (-2395), German (-
2086), Dutch (-2213).

From Figure 2 we see that ETAL performs better
than the baselines across multiple runs. To ver-
ify that this is not an artifact of randomness in
the test data, we use a paired bootstrap resampling
method, as illustrated in Koehn (2004), to compare
SAL, CFEAL, RAND with ETAL. For each system,
we compute the F1 score on randomly sampled
50% of the data and perform 10k bootstrapping
steps at three active learning runs. From Table 1
we see that the baselines are significantly worse
than ETAL at 600 and 1200 annotated tokens.

3.2.2 Ablation Study
In order to study the contribution of CT and
PARTIAL-CRF in improving the NER performance,
we conduct the following ablation, denoted by
dashed lines in Figure 2.

CT: We observe that the transferred data from
English provides a good start to the NER model:
69.4 (Dutch), 63.0 (Spanish-LDC), 65.7 (Spanish-
CoNLL), 54.7 (German), 45.4 (Indonesian), 45.0
(Hindi) F1. As expected, cross-lingual transfer
helps more for the languages closely related to En-
glish which are Dutch, German, Spanish. For this
ablation, we train a ETAL+PARTIAL-CRF where no
transferred data is used. Therefore, to create the
seed data, we randomly annotate 200 tokens in the
target language and thereafter use ETAL. We ob-
serve that as more in-domain data is acquired, the
un-transferred setting soon approaches the trans-
ferred setting ETAL+PARTIAL-CRF+CT suggesting
that an efficient annotation strategy can help close
the gap between these two systems with as few as
∼1000 tokens (avg.).

PARTIAL-CRF: We study the effect of using the
original CRF (FULL-CRF) instead of the PARTIAL-
CRF for training with partially labeled data. Since
the former requires fully labeled sequences, the

un-annotated tokens in a sequence are labeled with
the model predictions. We see from Figure 2 that
the ETAL+FULL-CRF+CT performs worse (avg. -
4.1 F1) than ETAL+PARTIAL-CRF+CT. This is be-
cause the FULL-CRF significantly hurts the recall, as
much as by an average of -11.0 points for Hindi, -
1.4 for Indonesian, -7.4 for Spanish-LDC, -3.3 for
German, -3.7 for Dutch, -4.8 for Spanish CoNLL.

3.2.3 Comparison of Training Schemes
We experiment with different NER training
regimes (described in §2.3.3) for ETAL. We ob-
serve that generally fine-tuning not only speeds up
the training but also gives better performance than
CORPUSAUG. For brevity of space, we compare re-
sults for two languages in Figure 3:3 Dutch, a rel-
ative of English, and Hindi, a distant language.
We see that FINETUNE performs better for Hindi
whereas CORPUSAUG+FINETUNE performs better for
Dutch. This is because Dutch is closely related to
English and benefits the most from the transferred
data being explicitly augmented. Whereas for
Hindi, which is typologically distant from English,
the transferred data is noisy and thus the model
doesn’t gain much from the transferred data. Xie
et al. (2018) make a similar observation in their

3.3 Human Annotation Experiments

Setup: We conduct human annotation experi-
ments for Hindi, Indonesian and Spanish to under-
stand whether ETAL helps reduce the annotation
effort and improve annotation quality in practical
settings. We compare ETAL with the full sequence
strategy (SAL). We use six native speakers, two for
each language, with different levels of familiarity
with the NER task. Each annotator was provided
with practice sessions to gain familiarity with the
annotation guidelines and the user interface. The
annotators annotated for 20 mins time for each
strategy. For ETAL, the annotator was required to
annotate single spans i.e each sequence contained
one span of tokens. This involved assigning the
correct label and adjusting the span boundary if
required. For SAL, the annotator was required to
annotate all possible entities in the sequence. We
randomized the order in which the annotators had
to annotate using ETAL and SAL strategy. Figure
5 illustrates the human annotation process for the
ETAL strategy in the annotation interface. 4

3.3.1 Results
Table 2 records the results of the human annota-
tion experiments. We first compare each annota-
tor’s annotation quality with respect to the oracle
under both ETAL and SAL, denoted by Annotator
Performance. We see that both Hindi and Span-
ish annotators have higher annotation quality us-
ing ETAL. This is because by selecting possible en-
tity spans, ETAL not only saves effort on searching
the entities in a sequence but also allows the an-
notators to read less overall and concentrate more

on the things that they do read, as seen in Figure
4(a). However, for SAL we see that the annotator
missed a likely entity because they focused on the
other more salient entities in the sequence. For In-
donesian, we see an opposite trend due to several
inconsistencies in the gold labels. The most com-
mon inconsistency being when a common noun is
part of an entity. For instance, the gold standard
annotates the span Kabupaten Bogor as an en-
tity where Kabupaten means “district”. Whereas
for Kabupaten Aceh tengah, the gold standard
does not include Kabupaten. Similarly, the same
span gunung krakatau is annotated inconsistently
across different mentions where sometimes they
exclude the gunung (mountain) token.Since the
annotators referred to these examples during their
practice session, their annotations had similar in-
consistencies. This issue affects ETAL more than
SAL because ETAL selects more entities for anno-
tation.

The Test Performance compares the perfor-
mance of the NER models trained with these an-
notations. The number in the brackets denotes the
total number of annotated tokens used for train-

ing the NER model. We observe that SAL has a
larger number of annotated tokens than ETAL. This
is because most sequences selected by SAL did not
have any entities. Since “not-an-entity” is the de-
fault label in the annotation interface, no operation
is required for annotating these, allowing for more
tokens to be annotated per unit times. When we
count the number of entities present in the data
selected by the two strategies, we see in Figure
4(b) that data selected by ETAL has a significantly
larger number of entities than SAL, across all the 6
annotation experiments. Therefore, we first com-
pare the NER performance on the same number of
annotated tokens. From Table 2 we see that under
this setting ETAL outperforms SAL, similar to the
simulation results. We note that when we consider
all the annotated tokens, SAL (denoted by SAL-
FULL) has slightly better results. However, despite
having 6 times fewer annotated tokens, the differ-
ence between ETAL and SAL-FULL is (avg.) 2.1 F1.
This suggests that ETAL can achieve competitive
performance with fewer annotations.

From both the simulation and human experi-
ments, we can conclude that a targeted annotation
strategy such as ETAL achieves competitive perfor-
mance with less manual effort while maintaining
high annotation quality. Given that ETAL can help
find twice as many entities as SAL, a potential ap-
plication of ETAL can also be for creating a high-
quality entity gazetteer under a short time budget.
Since a naive strategy of SAL allows for more la-
belled data to be acquired in the same amount of
time, in the future we plan to explore mixed-mode
annotation where we choose either full sequences

or spans for annotation.

4 Related Work

Cross-Lingual Transfer: Transferring knowl-
edge from high-resource languages has been ex-
tensively used for improving low-resource NER.
More common approaches rely on annotation pro-
jection methods where annotations in source lan-
guage are projected to the target language us-
ing parallel corpora (Zitouni and Florian, 2008;
Ehrmann et al., 2011) or bilingual dictionaries
(Xie et al., 2018; Mayhew et al., 2017). Cross-
lingual word embeddings (Bharadwaj et al., 2016;
Chaudhary et al., 2018) also provide a way to
leverage annotations from related languages.

Active Learning (AL): AL has been widely ex-
plored for many NLP tasks- NER: Shen et al.
(2017) explore token-level annotation strategies,
Chen et al. (2015) present a study on AL for clin-
ical NER; Baldridge and Palmer (2009) evaluate
how well AL works with annotator expertise and
label suggestions, Garrette and Baldridge (2013)
study type and token based strategies for low-
resource languages. Settles and Craven (2008)
present a nice survey on the different AL strategies
for sequence labeling tasks, whereas Marcheg-
giani and Artieres (2014) discuss the strategies for
acquiring partially labeled data. Wanvarie et al.
(2011); Neubig et al. (2011); Sperber et al. (2014)
show the advantages of training a model on this
partially labeled data. All above methods focus on
either token or full sequence annotation.

The most similar work to ours perhaps is that of

Fang and Cohn (2017), which selects informative
word types for low-resource POS tagging. How-
ever, their method requires the annotator to anno-
tate single tokens, which is not trivially applicable
for multi-word entities in practical settings.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we presented a study on how to ef-
ficiently bootstrap NER systems for low-resource
languages using a combination of cross-lingual
transfer learning and active learning. We con-
ducted both simulated and human annotation ex-
periments across different languages and found
that: 1) cross-lingual transfer is a powerful tool,
constantly beating systems without using trans-
fer; 2) our proposed recipe works the best among
known active learning baselines; 3) our proposed
active learning strategy saves annotator much ef-
fort while ensuring high quality. In future, to ac-
count for different levels of annotator expertise,
we plan to combine proactive learning (Li et al.,
2017) with our proposed method.
