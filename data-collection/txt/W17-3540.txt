Abstract

We introduce the properties to be satisfied by
measures of referential success of set refer-
ring expressions with fuzzy properties. We
define families of measures on the basis of k-
specificity measures and we illustrate some of
them with a toy example.

1 Introduction

The classical referring expression generation (REG)
problem intends to determine a noun phrase which
univocally identify an object in a collection. From a
knowledge representation perspective, the problem
is to determine (if possible) a collection of object
properties that can be employed in the noun phrase
for the abovementioned purpose (van Deemter,
2016).

The most usual version of the REG problem can
be formalized as follows: given a context formed by
a collection of objects O and a set of properties P of
objects in O, determine a subset re⊆ P such that⋂

pi∈re
[[ pi ]] = {o} (1)

where [[ pi ]] is the set of objects that satisfy pi.
This formalization assumes that properties in re are
combined conjunctively; other logical combinations
are possible (van Deemter, 2016).

There are many different extensions of the classi-
cal REG problem. One such extension is that of re-
ferring to sets (Krahmer and van Deemter, 2012; van
Deemter, 2016), where the objective is to generate a
referring expression able to identify an distinguish

a subset of objects Oi ⊂ O, that is, to determine a
subset re⊆ P such that

⋂
pi∈re

[[ pi ]] = Oi (2)

Note that the classical problem is a particular case
of set referring where Oi is a singleton.

Another extension considers that properties in P
may be vague or uncertain in several respects (van
Deemter, 2012). When the fulfilment of proper-
ties in P is gradual in nature, they may be mod-
elled by means of fuzzy sets (Gatt et al., 2016).
Fuzzy properties are modelled by means of fuzzy
sets, corresponding to membership functions of the
form pi : O → [0,1] ∀pi ∈ P, where 0 means “no
fulfilment” and 1 means “total fulfilment”, allowing
intermediate degrees. Note that classical crisp prop-
erties are particular cases of fuzzy ones in which
no intermediate degrees are allowed, and hence the
classical REG problem is again a particular case of
the REG problem with fuzzy properties.

In the aforementioned crisp versions of the prob-
lem, when Eq. (1) (resp. Eq. (2)) holds, it is said that
re has referential success for o (resp. Oi). One prob-
lem that arises in REG with fuzzy properties is that,
as the fulfilment of properties by objects is a mat-
ter of degree, so it is the referential success. Several
proposals for determining the degree of referential
success have been provided in the literature (Gatt et
al., 2016; Marı́n et al., 2016; Marı́n et al., 2017c),
some of them based on the notion of specificity in-
troduced by R. Yager (Yager, 1982; Yager, 1990;
Yager, 1992; Garmendia et al., 2003; Garmendia et
al., 2006).

In this paper we show a preliminary proposal for
extending referential success measures to the case of
set referring expressions with fuzzy properties.

2 Referential Success for Individual
Objects with Fuzzy Properties

Let us assume that properties in P are fuzzy and let
pi(o) be the accomplishment degree of property pi
for object o. The accuracy of the referring expres-
sion is then calculated as (Gatt et al., 2016):

Ore(o) =
n⊗

i=1

pi(o) (3)

where ⊗ is a t-norm. Unless otherwise stated,
we shall employ the minimum, that is, Ore(o) =
min{pi(o)}. Ore can be seen as the fuzzy set induced
by re on O.

In (Marı́n et al., 2016), a minimal set of proper-
ties that a referential success measure rs(re,o) must
fulfill in relation to the induced Ore is presented:

Property 2.1 rs(re,oi) = 1 iff Ore = {oi}.

Property 2.2 If Ore(oi) = 0 then rs(re,oi) = 0.

Property 2.3 If Ore(o) ≤ Ore′(o) ∀o ∈ O\{oi} and
Ore(oi)≥ Ore′(oi) then rs(re,oi)≥ rs(re′,oi).

Additionally, a general family of measures is pro-
vided in (Marı́n et al., 2016) on the basis of Yager’s
specificity measures, as follows:

Definition 2.1 (Marı́n et al., 2016) Let t be a t-norm
and Sp be a specificity measure. The referential suc-
cess measure associated to Sp and t is defined as
follows:

−→
RSt(Sp)(re,oi) =

{
t(Ore(oi),Sp(O∗re)) condmax
0 otherwise

(4)
where

O∗re(o j) =
Ore(o j)

max
o∈O

Ore(o)
(5)

and condmax stands for the following condition:

max
o∈O

Ore(o) = Ore(oi) > 0.

3 Referential success of Set Referring
Expressions

We propose the following minimal set of properties
to be fulfilled by a referential success measure rs of
set referring expressions:

Property 3.1 rs(re,Oi) = 1 iff Ore = Oi.

Property 3.2 If ∃o ∈ Oi such that Ore(o) = 0 then
rs(re,Oi) = 0.

Property 3.3 If Ore(o) ≤ Ore′(o) ∀o ∈ O\Oi and
Ore(o) ≥ Ore′(o) ∀o ∈ Oi then rs(re,Oi) ≥
rs(re′,Oi).

Our proposal of measures in this paper is based on
the measures of k-specificity introduced in (Sánchez
et al., 2016) and related to cardinality in (Marı́n et
al., 2017a). The measure Spk indicates to which de-
gree the cardinality of a fuzzy set is exactly k. Eqs.
(6) to (8) show three such measures:

Sp fk (A) =

Table 2: Different referential success measures applied to scenes in Fig. 2.

SpΛ,k(A) = ak(ak−ak+1) (7)

SpL,k(A) = ak−ak+1 (8)
We define the following family of measures of ref-

erential success:

Definition 3.1 Let t be a t-norm, let |Oi|= n > 0 and
Spk be a measure of k-specificity. The referential
success measure associated to Spk and t is defined
as follows:

−→
RSt(Spk)(re,Oi) =

{
t(Oire,Spk(O

∗
re)) condmax

0 otherwise
(9)

where Oire is the conjunction via t of the member-
ships of all the objects in Oi. Also

O∗re(o j) =
Ore(o j)

max
o∈O

Ore(o)
(10)

and condmax holds iff ∀o ∈ O\Oi,o′ ∈ Oi it is
Ore(o)≤ Ore(o′).

4 Examples

Fig. 1 shows an scene containing several objects,
that have been numbered for easier identification.
Table 1 shows several fuzzy properties for objects in
the scene, and the corresponding fulfilment degrees.

Fig. 2 shows four sets of three objects Oi, marked
with an “x” in each case, intended to be referred to

by referring expressions “The dark triangles” (Fig.
2(a)), “The circles” (Fig. 2(b)), “The objects at the
top-right” (Fig. 2(c)), and “The dark squares” (Fig.
2(d)). Table 2 shows the referential success obtained
using Def. 3.1 with the three k-specificity measures
of Eqs. (6) to (8) and minimum and product as t-
norms. The best behaviour is that of measures CΛ,3
and CL,3, since they yield the expected values 1 and
0 for the first two cases, and reasonable intermediate
values in the other two cases. Measure C f3 , as dis-
cussed in (Marı́n et al., 2017b) for its corresponding
specificity measure, is more suitable for ranking in-
termediate results when generating the referring ex-
pression by means of Greedy approaches.

5 Conclusions

The measures proposed are to be employed in REG
algorithms for set referring expressions with fuzzy
properties. We are about to begin testing which mea-
sures are more suitable for providing good results in
such setting, in order to validate the proposal.
