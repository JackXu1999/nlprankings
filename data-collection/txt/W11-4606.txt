Abstract
This paper presents work on a comprehensive 
FrameNet  for Danish (cf.  www.framenet.dk), 
with over 12.000 frames, and an almost com-
plete  coverage  of  Danish  verb  lemmas.  We 
discuss  design  principles  and  frame  roles  as 
well as the distinctional use of valency, syn-
tactic function and semantic noun classes. By 
converting  frame  distinctors  into  Constraint 
Grammar rules, we were able to build a robust 
frame  tagger  for  running  Danish  text,  using 
DanGram parses as input. The combined con-
text-informed coverage of the parser-frametag-
ger  was  94.3%,  with  an  overall  F-score  for 
frame senses of 85.12.

1 The FrameNet concept

Classification of the lexicon is central to many 
aspects of linguistic research, and modern com-
putational linguistics in particular has a need for 
robust  classification  systems  to  support  on  the 
one hand automatic analysis, on the other hand 
applicational tasks such as information extraction 
and question answering. As the pivot of the sen-
tence,  verbs  play  a  special,  integrative  role  in 
lexical ontologies. While noun ontologies are rel-
atively easy to build around ISA/hypernym-rela-
tions, verbs are somewhat harder to classify be-
cause structural aspects are meshed with seman-
tics, with complex combinatorial restrictions re-
siding in both a verb's meaning and its syntactic 
nature. While one of the largest ontological re-
sources, WordNet (Fellbaum 1998),  does cover 
verbs, but provides little structural-relational in-
formation,  a  number  of  other  classification 
projects link verb classes to certain verbo-nomi-
nal combination patterns, providing information 
on the form, function and semantics of comple-
ments. For English, Levin's original verb classifi-
cation  (Levin  1993)  has  been  expanded  in  the 
VerbNet project (Kipper et al. 2006) to include 
non-np complements and employs 23 (25) the-
matic  roles  and  94  semantic  predicates.  In  the 
FrameNet project (Baker et al. 1998, Johnson & 
Fillmore 2000, Ruppenhofer et al. 2010), seman-
tic  frames  like  Commerce  are  drawn  up  with 
roles  like  Buyer,  Seller,  Goods  and  Money,  
which are then associated with verbs (or nouns 

and adjectives) from corpus examples. Since the 
same verb may appear in more than one frame, 
verb sense  lists  are  created  implicitly,  with  no 
guarantee  for  full  coverage.  Conversely,  the 
PropBank  Project  (Palmer  et  al.  2005)  departs 
from syntactically  annotated corpus data to  as-
sign both roles  and argument structure to  each 
verb  consecutively.  Both  FrameNet  and  Prop-
Bank provide morphosyntactic restrictions, while 
FrameNet also adds ontological  information on 
slot fillers. 

For  Danish,  the  target  language  of  our  own 
work, some semantic verb classification has been 
undertaken as part of the Danish DanNet project 
(Pedersen et al. 2008), covering ca. 3000 verbs 
with 6000 senses falling into 80 top classes, e.g. 
BoundedEvent + Physical + Location. However, 
while some incorporated adverbial material and 
reflexivity are provided as verb sense discrimina-
tors,  no frame roles or  systematic  selection re-
strictions are listed. Earlier work comprises the 
STO database, with almost 6000 verbal entries of 
which 4/5 offer syntactic, and 1/5 semantic infor-
mation (Braasch & Olsen 2004), and the Odense 
Valency Dictionary (Schösler & Kirchmeier-An-
dersen 1997), that classified verbal argument se-
mantics through the semantics of pronoun com-
plements, covering ca. 4000 verbs.

 The project described here, launched in 2006, 
also regards valency as a useful  stepping stone 
towards the semantic classification of verb struc-
tures,  assuming  that  almost  all  subsenses  of  a 
given verb can be distinguished, and a full the-
matic role frame assigned, if the form, function 
and  (noun)  semantics  of  complements  are 
known. Thus, using the DanGram parser's valen-
cy dictionary (Bick 2001) as a point of departure, 
we manually assigned verb classes and thematic 
role frames to each valency “sense” of a given 
verb, using corpus data and dictionaries to check 
sense coverage, and adding sense-based subdis-
tinctions  for  the  broader  valency  senses  where 
necessary. Syntactic functions and forms of com-
plements  were  already  implicit  in  the  valency 
tags and could therefore be assigned semi-auto-
matically. At the same time, our methodology of 
building  semantic  frames  from  “syntactic

frames”  considerably  facilitated  locating  and 
checking  corpus  examples,  since  all  syntactic 
complementation patterns were already available 
- and searchable - in corpora annotated with the 
DanGram parser (Bick 2001), allowing focused 
inspection of semantic variation.

2 The Danish FrameNet

After 4 years, our framenet (inspection demo at 
www.framenet.dk) has a very good  coverage for 
the DanGram lexicon, and while further senses 
and patterns are being added and existing ones 
revised,  the overall  number of  lexemes is  now 
fairly  stable,  at  6825,  with  an average  of  1.77 
frames and 1.46 senses per lexeme. At the time 
of writing, this corresponds to about 11.000 va-
lency patterns and 12.075 different verb frames, 
roughly  twice  the  volume  of  DanNet.  We  use 
494 different verb categories1 (cp. Appendix 1) 
that are grouped using the original Levine senses 
and  VerbNet  numbering  system,  albeit  with  a 
modified naming system2 and expanded subclas-
sification system. Thus, though syntactic alterna-
tions such as diathesis or word order are not con-
sidered  frame-distinctors,  we  do  deviate  from 
WordNet and VerbNet by making a class distinc-
tion  for  polarity  antonyms  like  increase  -  de-
crease, like - dislike,  and for the self/other dis-
tinction (move_self, move_other).  We also try to 
avoid  large  underspecified  classes  (e.g. 
change_of_state), while at the same time keeping 
the classification scheme as flat  as possible,  in 
order  to  facilitate  the  use  of  our  categories  as 
corpus  annotation  tags  or  Constraint  Grammar 
disambiguation  tags.  We  have  therefore  intro-
duced classes like  heat - cool, activate - deacti-
vate  or  open  -  close,  reducing  the  larger 
change_of_state to a kind of wastebin rest cate-
gory. 

3 Frame role  distinctors:  valency,  syn-
tactic function and semantic classes

The distinctional backbone of our frame invento-

1 A smaller set of 200 frame senses was also established, 
with a hypernym-mapping from the more fine-grained 
set, in part to allow some generalisation when used in 
e.g. syntactic disambiguation rules, in part  to facilitate 
robust cross-language comparison - and possibly trans-
fer - of frame types.

2 We wanted the class names to on the one hand be real 
verbs, on the other to reflect hypernym meanings wher-
ever possible. Therefore, we avoided both example-
based names (common in VerbNet) and - mostly - ab-
strac concept names (commen in FrameNet) that are not 
verbs themselves.

ry are syntactic valency frames like <vt> (mono-
transitive),  <vdt>  (ditransitive),  <på^vtp-ind> 
(prepositional  ditransitive  with  the  preposition 
“på” and a verb-incorporated 'ind'-adverb). Each 
of these valency frames is assigned at least one 
(or more3) verb senses, each with its own seman-
tic frame. Depending, for instance, on the num-
ber of obligatory arguments,  several valency or 
semantic frames may share the same verb sense, 
but two different verb senses will almost always 
differ in at least one syntactic or semantic aspect 
of  their  argument frame - guaranteeing that  all 
senses can in principle be disambiguated exploit-
ing  a  parser's  argument  tags  and  dependency 
links.

For  each of  our  12.000 verb sense frames,  we 
provide a list of arguments with the following in-
formation:

1. Thematic role (Table 1)
2. Syntactic function (Table 2)
3. Morphosyntactic form (Table 4)
4. for np's, a list of typical semantic proto-

types to fill the slot (Table 3)
5. An  English  language  gloss  /  skeleton 

sentence

For  about  half  the  frames  (46%),  a  best-guess 
link  to  a  DanNet  verb  sense  is  also  provided, 
based on semi-automatic matches on adverb in-
corporation and hypernym classification.

Our  FrameNet  uses  38  thematic  roles  (or 
case/semantic roles, Fillmore 1968), leaving out 
adverbial  roles  that  never  occur  as  valency-
bound elements in a frame, but only in free ad-
verbials  (such  as  §COND for  conditional  sub-
clauses). The 38 roles are far from evenly distrib-
uted in running text. Table 1 provides some live 
corpus data, showing that the top 5 roles account 
for 2/3 of all role taggings in running text.

Thematic Role in corpus
§TH Theme 31.75%
§AG Agent 12.25%
§ATR Attribute 12.25%
§PAT Patient 5.12%
§COG Cognizer 4.69%
§SP Speaker 4.15%
§RES Result 3.78%
§LOC Location 2.95%
§DES Destination 2.86%

3 In 780 cases multiple verb senses share the same valen-
cy frame - in other words, in 6.5% of cases, verb senses 
cannot be disambiguated on syntactic function and form 
alone, but need help from semantic (noun) classes.

Even in  a  case-poor  language  like  Danish,  we 
found  some  clear  likelihood  relations  between 
thematic roles and syntactic functions (table 2). 
Thus, agents (§AG, §COG, §SP) are typical sub-
ject roles, while patients (§PAT), actions (§ACT) 
and results (§RES) are typical direct object roles, 
and recipients (§REC) and beneficiaries (§BEN) 
call for dative object function.

Table 2: Syntactic Functions

The prototypical frame consists of a full verb and 
its nominal, adverbial or subclause complements. 
Like most other languages, however, Danish em-
ploys also verb incorporations that are not, in the 
semantical  sense,  complements.  The  simplest 
kind are adverb incorporates, which we mark in 
the valency frame, but not in the argument list:

kaste op (vomit) - <vi-op>

slå fra (deactivate) - <vt-fra>

komme ind på (discuss) - <på^vt-ind>

More  complicated  are  support  verb  construc-
tions, where the semantic weight and - to a cer-
tain  degree  -  valency  reside  in  a  nominal  ele-
ment,  typically  a noun that  syntactically  fills  a 
(direct or prepositional) object slot, but semanti-
cally orchestrates the other complements. While 
adverb incorporates are marked as such already 
at  the  syntactic  level  (@MV<)4,  noun incorpo-
rates receive an ordinary syntactic tag (@ACC), 
but  are  marked with an empty §INC (incorpo-
rate) role tag at the semantic level:

holde kæft (shut up) - <vt-kæft>

have brug for (need) - <for^vtp-brug>

One could argue that  the real frame arguments 
(like the noun expressing what is needed in have 
brug for)  should  be  dependency-linked  to  the 
§INC noun brug and the frame class marked on 
the latter, but for consistency and processing rea-
sons we decided to center all  dependency rela-
tions on the support verb in these cases, and also 
mark the frame name on the verbal element of 
support constructions.

Pp  incorporates  are  in  principle  handled  in 
the same way, with a syntactic @PIV tag on the 
preposition  and  an  §INC role  tag  on  its  argu-
ment:

træde i kraft (take effect) - <vi-i=kraft>

However, some of these incorporates, especially 
those containing dative case, which is otherwise 
extinct in Danish, can be said to be so “frozen” 
that a preprocessing stage can turn them into one 
token, assigning an adverb tag to the pp, and al-
lowing the  role-free  adverb incorporation solu-
tion: 

have i sinde (intend) - <vt-i=sinde>

være på færde (be going on)- <vi-på=færde>

Independently  of  the  one-  or  two-token  treat-
ment,  incorporated pp's  are treated alike in our 
FrameNet dictionary, as '-prp=noun' parts in the 
valency frame, without a separate argument line, 
the annotational difference being triggered solely 
by preprocessing conventions. 

4 Frame annotation

One would assume that using argument informa-
tion from our verb frame lexicon on the one hand 
and a functional dependency parser on the other, 

4 We are here taking into account the (syntactic) annota-
tion performed by DanGram, the parser used as input 
for our frame annotation system.

it should in theory be possible to annotate run-
ning text with verb senses and frame elements, 
simply by checking verb-argument dependencies 
for function and semantic class. To prove this as-
sumption, we implemented our annotation mod-
ule in the Constraint Grammar formalism, choos-
ing this particular approach in part because that 
made it  easier  to  exploit  the  DanGram-parser's 
existing CG annotation tags, but also to allow for 
later fine-tuning and contextual exceptions.

As  a  first  step,  we  wrote  a  converter  program 
(framenet2cgrules.pl) that turned each frame into 
a verb sense mapping rule - a relatively simple 
task, since argument checking amounts to simple 
LINKed dependency contexts in the CG formal-
ism:

SUBSTITUTE  (V)  (<fn:consist>  <r:SUBJ:HOL> 
<r:PIV:PART/MAT> V) TARGET ("bestå" <mv> V)

(1 (*) LINK *-1 VFIN LINK c @SUBJ LINK 0 
<cc>) (c @PIV LINK 0 ("af") LINK c @P< LINK 0 
<cc> OR <mat>) ;

In the example rule, apart from the <fn:consist> 
framenet class (implicitly: sense), argument rela-
tion tags  (<r:....>)  are  added indicating a  HOL 
role (whole) for the subject and a PART/MAT 
role (part/material) for the prepositional “af”-ob-
ject,  IF the  former  is  a  concrete  object  (<cc>) 
and the latter a physical object (<cc> = concrete 
countable) or a material (<mat>). In the defini-
tion section of the grammar, such semantic noun 
sets are expanded to individual semantic proto-
type classes (table 3): 

LIST  <cc>  =  <cc.*>r  <cloH.*>r  <con>  <fruit> 
<furn> <tool.*>r <V.*>r  ;  (subtypes,  clothing, con-
tainers, fruits, furniture, tools, vehicles)

LIST  <mat>  =  <mat>  <mat-cloth>  <cm-chem> 
<cm.*>r ; (materials, chemicals, mass nouns)

Semantic (prototype) noun class
<H> human (<Hprof>, <Hfam>, <Hideo> ....)
<cc> concrete object
<act> action
<L> location (<Lh, Ltop, Lwater, Labs ...)
<fact> fact
<event> event
<A> animal
<sem-r> “read”-semantical
<sem-s> “speak”-semantical
<food> food
<cm-liq> liquid
<mon> money
<sit> situation
<sem-c> semantic concept

<cm> substance (concrete mass noun)
<Lsurf> surface
<V> vehicle (<Vground>,<Vair> ...)
<conv> convention
<HH> group
<an> anatomical (body part)
..... (about 200 classes)

Table 3: Semantic prototypes

Apart from semantic classes, the frame mapping 
rules  in  step  one  may  exploit  word  class  or 
phrase type (table 4).  With noun phrases being 
the  default,  special  context  conditions  will  be 
added for finite or non-finite clausal arguments, 
adverbs or pronouns.

Form type
np noun phrase or noun phrase in @PIV
refl reflexive pronoun
fcl finite subclause
icl non-finite subclause
advl adverb, adverb phrase or adverbial pp
pl plural np
pron impersonal pronoun (usually 'det')
adj adjective
num numeral
pp prepositional phrase, not in @PIV
lex incorporated lexical item

Table 4: Morphosyntactic Form

For the second step, assigning thematic roles to 
arguments,  we  needed  to  either  perform  map-
pings on multiple (argument) contexts, or to tar-
get arguments and unify their function with the 
head verb's new <r:....> tag in order to retrieve 
(and map) the correct thematic role from the lat-
ter. To the best of our knowledge, no current CG 
compiler  allowed  either  method,  so  we  had  to 
make changes in the compiler code of the open 
source CG3 variant we were using, for the first 
time  allowing  unification  between  tag-internal 
string variables and ordinary tag and map sets.  

MAP  KEEPORDER  (VSTR:§$1)  TARGET 
@SUBJ (*p V LINK -1 (*) LINK *1 (<r:.*>r) LINK 
0 PAS LINK 0 (<r:ACC:\(.*\)>r)) ;

The rule above is a simple example, retrieving a 
thematic role variable from the verb's accusative 
argument tag (<r:ACC.:..>) and mapping it as a 
VSTR expression  onto  the  subject  in  case  the 
verb is in the passive voice. Complete rules will 
also contain negative contexts (omitted here), for 
instance ruling out the presence of objects for in-
transitive valency frames.

While  helping  to  distinguish  between  verb 
senses with the same syntactic argument frame, 
using semantic  noun classes  as  context  restric-
tions  raises  the  issue of  circularity  in  terms of 
corpus  example  extraction,  and  also  reduces 
overall robustness of frame tagging, not least in 
the  presence of  metaphor.  Therefore,  all  frame 
mapping rules are run twice - first with semantic 
noun class restrictions in place, then - if neces-
sary - without. This way “skeletal-syntactic” (se-
mantics-free)  argument  structures  can  still  be 
used as a backup for frame assignment, allowing 
corpus-based  extension  of  semantic  noun  class 
restrictions. 

In a vertical,  one-word-per-line CG notation, 
the frame-tagger adds <fn:sense> and <v:valen-
cy>  tags  on  verbs,  and  §ROLE  tags  on  argu-
ments.  So  far,  free  adverbial  adjuncts  are  not 
role-tagged. The example demonstrates a frame 
sense distinction for the Danish verb  nedsætte.  
Dependency arcs are shown as #n->m ID-links.

5 Evaluation

To evaluate  the  coverage  and  precision  of  our 
frame tagger,  we annotated a 2.4 million word 
chunk of newspaper text from the Danish daily 
Information, building on a DanGram dependency 
annotation (Bick 2005) as input, and  using only 
the rules automatically created by our FrameNet 
conversion  program,  with  no  manual  rule 
changes, rule ordering or additions. 

Out of  289.720 main verbs,  98.8% were as-
signed a frame verb sense,  albeit  19.2% of as-
signments  were  default  senses  for  the  verb  in 
question  because  of  the  lack  of  surface  argu-
ments to match for sense-disambiguation. 15.0% 
of frames were subject-less infinitive and partici-
ple  constructions,  but  of  these,  two  thirds 
(10.9%) did have other, non-subject arguments to 
support frame assignment. The corpus contained 
4051 verb lexeme types, and the frame tagger as-
signed 9195 different frame types, and 5929 verb 
sense  types.  Type-wise,  this  amounts  to  2.26 
frames, and 1.46 senses per verb type (similar to 
the distribution in the frame lexicon itself), but 
token-wise ambiguity is about double that figure, 
as we will discuss later in this chapter.

Table 5: Surface expression of arguments

Table 5 contains a break-down of surface expres-
sion percentages for individual argument types. 
Apart from subjects in non-finite clauses, dative 
objects are the least obligatory category. Predica-
tive  arguments,  of  verbs  like  være  (be),  blive  
(become), are 100% expressed, and prepositional 
arguments (PIV) have almost as high an expres-
sion rate simply because most verbs have alter-
native valency frames of lower order (intransitive 
or  monotransitive  accusative)  that  the  tagger 
would have chosen in the absence of a PIV argu-
ment. In other words, PIV arguments are strong 
sense  markers,  and  there  absence  will  sooner

lead to false-positive senses of lower valency-or-
der than to PIV-senses without surface PIV.

On a random 5000-word chunk of the frame-an-
notated  data,  a  complete  error  count  was  per-
formed for all verbs. All in all, there were 566 
main  verb  tags,  4  of  which  (0.7%)  had  been 
wrongly verb-tagged by the parser,  in one case 
due to a spelling error. For 3 verbs (0.5%), the 
parser offered a wrong (same-form) lemma.  Our 
frame tagger  assigned 561 frames,  missing out 
on 3 regular verbs, and (wrongly) tagging 2 of 
the  false-positive  verbs.  Only  1  verb  was  not 
covered by the frame lexicon, suggesting a very 
good raw coverage (99.82%). In 15.7% of cases, 
the frame tagger assigned a default frame, usual-
ly  a  low-order  valency frame without  incorpo-
rates5. Of 562 possible frames, 478 were correct-
ly tagged, yielding the following correctness fig-
ures:

Table 6: Recall and precision

These figures are an encouraging result, despite 
the  “weak”  (inspection-based)  evaluation 
method.  No  other  frame-/role-tagger  could  be 
found for  Danish,  but  Shi  & Mihalcea (2004), 
also using FrameNet-derived rules, report an F-
score of 74.5% for English, while Gildea & Ju-
rafsky (2002), using statistical methods, report F-
scores of 80.4% and 82.1% for frame roles and 
abstract thematic roles, respectively. For copula 
and support verb constructions,  not included in 
the  earlier  evaluations,  Johansson  &  Nugues 
(2006) report  tagging accuracies for English of 
71-73%, respectively, but a comparison is hard 
to make, since we only looked at  support  con-
structions that our FrameNet does know, with no 
idea about the theoretical lexical “coverage ceil-
ing”.

A  break-down  of  error  types  revealed  that 
39% of all  false positive errors (but only 5.7% 
of all frames)  were cases where the human “gold 
sense” was not on the list of possible senses in 
the  framenet  database.  11   false  positives

into a Constraing Grammar, as the first intransitive or 
monotransitive valency frame by order of appearance in 
the lexicon. Ultimately, therefore, the default choice is 
under the control of the lexicographer, who can change 
the frame order in the lexicon.

(13.3%) were caused by errors from the parsing 
stage (wrong lemma, auxiliary or syntactic tag). 
Ignoring these errors, i.e. assuming correct pars-
ing input, would influence precision, in particu-
lar, and raise the overall F-score by 1 percentage 
point. As one might expect, default mappings ac-
counted for a higher percentage (24.7%) among 
error verbs than in the chunk as a whole (15.7%), 
and contributed to almost a third of the “frame-
not-in-lexicon” cases.

Frequent verbs have a high sense ambiguity, 
and verbs with a high sense ambiguity were more 
error-prone than one-sense verbs, as can be seen 
from table  7.  Thus,  the  verbs  occurring in  our 
evaluation chunk had 4.21 potential  senses  per 
verb  (6.77  for  the  ambiguous  ones),  and  the 
verbs accounting for frame tagging errors had a 
theoretical 10.08 senses each.

6 Conclusion and future work

We have reported work on a comprehensive fra-
menet for Danish, with over 12.000 frames, and 
a lexeme coverage of almost 100%. After con-
version of our framenet into CG rules, the com-
bined  parser-frametagger  coverage  was  94.3% 
(i.e.  only  5.7%  match-less  default  mappings), 
with  an  overall  F-score  for  frame  senses  of 
85.12.

Still, given the fact that almost 40% of frame 
tagging errors were due to missing frame senses, 
the current framenet should be checked against 
larger amounts of corpus data to identify senses 
not captured by our valency-based approach. In 
particular, noun-incorporations (e.g.  finde sted -  
take place)  may require  further  research,  since 
the  original  DanGram  valency  lexicon  only 
treated adverb  incorporations,  and  all  other  in-
corporations were added in a piecemeal fashion.

On the frametagger side, our CG conversion 
approach should allow improvements by manu-
ally  ordering or modifying frame-derived map-

ping rules, adding more complex context condi-
tions where necessary. Finally, to confirm our in-
tuition as to the effectiveness of the CG conver-
sion approach, it should be compared to a scor-
ing method where frame conditions are matched 
and counted individually against the parse tree. 
With either method, the Danish FrameNet could 
be used to annotate large corpora for manual re-
vision, ultimately allowing hybridization with a 
statistical frame tagger.
