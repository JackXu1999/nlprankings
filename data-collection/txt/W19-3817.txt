Abstract

Pronoun resolution is part of coreference res-
olution, the task of pairing an expression to
its referring entity. This is an important task
for natural language understanding and a nec-
essary component of machine translation sys-
tems, chat bots and assistants. Neural machine
learning systems perform far from ideally in
this task, reaching as low as 73% F1 scores on
modern benchmark datasets. Moreover, they
tend to perform better for masculine pronouns
than for feminine ones. Thus, the problem is
both challenging and important for NLP re-
searchers and practitioners. In this project, we
describe our BERT-based approach to solving
the problem of gender-balanced pronoun reso-
lution. We are able to reach 92% F1 score and
a much lower gender bias on the benchmark
dataset shared by Google AI Language team.

1 Introduction

In this work, we are dealing with gender bias in
pronoun resolution. A more general task of coref-
erence resolution is reviewed in Sec. 2. In Sec.
3, we give an overview of a related Kaggle com-
petition. Then, Sec. 4 describes the GAP dataset
and Google AI’s heuristics to resolve pronomial
coreference in a gender-agnostic way, so that pro-
noun resolution is done equally well in cases of
masculine and feminine pronouns. In Sec. 5,
we provide the details of our BERT-based solution
while in Sec. 6 we analyze pleasantly low gender

bias specific for our system (our code is shared on
GitHub1). Lastly, in Sec. 7, we draw conclusions
and express some ideas for further research.

2 Related work

Among popular approaches to coreference res-
olution are:2 rule-based, mention pair, mention
ranking, and clustering. As for rule-based ap-
proaches, they describe naïve Hobbs algorithm
(Hobbs, 1986) which, in spite of being naïve,
has shown state-of-the-art performance on the
OntoNotes dataset3 up to 2010.

Recent state-of-the-art approaches (Lee et al.,
2018, 2017; Peters et al., 2018a) are pretty
complex examples of mention ranking systems.
The 2017 version is the first end-to-end corefer-
ence resolution model that didn’t utilize syntactic
parsers or hand-engineered mention detectors. In-
stead, it used LSTMs and attention mechanism to
improve over previous NN-based solutions.

Some more state-of-the-art coreference resolu-
tion systems are reviewed in (Webster et al., 2018)
as well as popular datasets with ambiguous pro-
nouns: Winograd schemas (Levesque et al., 2012),
WikiCoref (Ghaddar and Langlais, 2016), and

The Definite Pronoun Resolution Dataset (Prad-
han et al., 2007). We also refer to the GAP paper
for a brief review of gender bias in machine learn-
ing.

We further outline that e2e-coref model (Lee
et al., 2018), in spite of being state-of-the-art in
coreference resolution, didn’t show good results in
the pronoun resolution task that we tackled, so we
only used e2e-coref predictions as an additional
feature.

3 Kaggle competition “Gendered
Pronoun Resolution”

Following Kaggle competition “Gendered Pro-
noun Resolution”,4 for each abstract from
Wikipedia pages we are given a pronoun, and we
try to predict the right coreference for it, i.e. to
which named entity (A or B) it refers. Let’s take a
look at this simple example:

“John entered the room and saw [A] Julia.
[Pronoun] She was talking to [B] Mary Hendriks
and looked so extremely gorgeous that John was
stunned and couldn’t say a word.”

Here “Julia” is marked as entity A, “Mary Hen-
driks” – as entity B, and pronoun “She” is marked
as Pronoun. In this particular case the task is to
correctly identify to which entity the given pro-
noun refers.

If we feed this sentence into a coreference res-
olution system (see Fig. 1 and online demo5), we
see that it correctly identifies that “she” refers to
Julia, it also correctly clusters together two men-
tions of “John” and detects that Mary Hendriks is
a two-word span.

For instance, if you take an abstract like this it’s
pretty hard to resolve coreference.

“Roxanne, a poet who now lives in France. Is-
abel believes that she is there to help Roxanne dur-
ing her pregnancy with her toddler infant, but later
realizes that her father and step-mother sent her
there so that Roxanne would help the shiftless Is-
abel gain some direction in life. Shortly after she
(pronoun) arrives, Roxanne confides in Isabel that
her French husband, Claude-Henri has left her.”

Google AI and Kaggle (organizers of this com-
petition) provided the GAP dataset (Webster et al.,
2018) with 4454 snippets from Wikipedia articles,
in each of them named entities A and B are labeled

4https://www.kaggle.com/c/
gendered-pronoun-resolution

5https://bit.ly/2I4tECI

along with a pronoun. The dataset is labeled, i.e.
for each sentence a correct coreference is speci-
fied, one of three mutually-exclusive classes: ei-
ther A or B or “Neither”. Thus, the prediction task
is actually that of multiclass classification type.

Moreover, the dataset is balanced w.r.t. mascu-
line and feminine pronouns. Thus, the competition
was supposed to address the problem of building
a coreference resolution system which is not sus-
ceptible to gender bias, i.e. works equally well for
masculine and feminine pronouns.

These are the columns provided in the dataset
(Webster et al., 2018):

• ID - Unique identifier for an example
(matches to Id in output file format)

• Text - Text containing the ambiguous pro-
noun and two candidate names (about a para-
graph in length)

• Pronoun - target pronoun (text)

• Pronoun-offset - character offset of Pronoun
in Text

• A - first name candidate (text)

• A-offset - character offset of name A in Text

• B - second name candidate

• B-offset - character offset of name B in Text

• URL - URL of the source Wikipedia page for
the example

Evaluation metric chosen for the competition6

is multiclass logarithmic loss. Each pronoun has
been labeled with whether it refers to A, B, or
“Neither”. For each pronoun, a set of predicted
probabilities (one for each class) is submitted. The
formula is then

logloss = − 1
N

N∑
i=1

M∑
j=1

yij log pij ,

where N is the number of samples in the test set,
M is 3, log is the natural logarithm, yij is 1 if ob-
servation i belongs to class j and 0 otherwise, and
pij is the predicted probability that observation i
belongs to class j.

Unfortunately, the chosen evaluation metric
does not reflect the mentioned above goal of build-
ing a gender-unbiased coreference resolution al-
gorithm, i.e. the metric does not account for gen-
der imbalance - logarithmic loss may not reflect
the fact that e.g. predicted pronoun coreference
is much worse for masculine pronouns than for
feminine ones. Therefore, we explore gender bias
separately in Sec. 6 and compare our results with
those published by the Google AI Language team
(reviewed in Sec. 4).

4 Mind the GAP: A Balanced Corpus of
Gendered Ambiguous Pronouns

Google AI Language team addresses the prob-
lem of gender bias in pronoun resolution (when
systems favor masculine entities) and a gender-
balanced labeled corpus of 8,908 ambiguous
pronoun-name pairs sampled to provide diverse
coverage of challenges posed by real-world text
(Webster et al., 2018) (further referred to as the
GAP dataset). They run 4 state-of-the-art coref-
erence resolution models (Lee et al., 2013; Clark
and Manning, 2015; Wiseman et al., 2016; Lee
et al., 2017) on the OntoNotes and GAP datasets
reporting F1 scores separately for masculine and
feminine pronoun-named entity pairs (metrics M
and F in the paper). Also they measure “gender
bias” defined as B = F / M. In general, they con-
clude, these models perform better for masculine
pronoun-named entity pairs, but still pronoun res-
olution is challenging - all achieved F1 scores are
less than 0.7 for both datasets.

Further, they propose simple heuristics (called
surface, structural and Wikipedia cues). The best
reported cues are “Parallelism” (if the pronoun is
a subject or direct object, select the closest can-

didate with the same grammatical argument) and
“URL” (select the syntactically closest candidate
which has a token overlap with the page title).
They compare the performance of “Parallelism +
URL” cue with e2e-coref (Lee et al., 2017) on
the GAP dataset and, surprisingly enough, con-
clude that heuristics work better achieving bet-
ter F1 scores (0.742 for M and 0.716 for F) at
the same time being less gender-biased (some of
heuristics are totally gender-unbiased, for “Paral-
lelism + URL” B = F / M = 0.96).

Finally, they explored Transformer architecture
(Vaswani et al., 2017) for this task and observed
that the coreference signal is localized on specific
heads and that these heads are in the deep layers
of the network. In Sec. 5 we confirm this obser-
vation. Actually, they select the candidate which
attends most to the pronoun (“Transformer heuris-
tic” in the paper). Even though they conclude
that Transformer models implicitly learn language
understanding relevant to coreference resolution,
as for F1 scores, they didn’t make it work bet-
ter than e2e-coref or Parallelism cues (F1 scores
lower that 0.63). More to that, proposed Trans-
formers heuristics are a bit biased towards mascu-
line pronouns with B from 0.95 to 0.98.

Further we report a much stronger gender-
unbiased BERT-based (Devlin et al., 2018) pro-
noun resolution system.

5 System

BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) is a transformer archi-
tecture, pre-trained on a large corpus (Wikipedia
+ BookCorpus), with 12 to 24 transformer layers.
Each layer learns a 1024-dimensional representa-
tion of the input token, with layer 1 being similar
to a standard word embedding, layer 24 special-

https://huggingface.co/coref/

ized for the task of predicting missing words from
context. At the same time BERT embeddings are
learned for a second auxiliary task of resolving
whether two consequent sentences are connected
to each other or not.

In general, motivated by (Tenney et al., 2019),
we found that BERT provides very good token em-
beddings for the task in hand.

Our proposed pipeline is built upon solutions
by teams “Ken Krige” and “[ods.ai] five zeros”
(placed 5 and 22 in the final leaderboard7 corre-
spondingly). The way these two teams approached
the competition task are described in two Kaggle
posts.89 The combined pipeline includes several
subroutines:

• Extracting BERT-embeddings for named en-
tities A, B, and pronouns

• Fine-tuning BERT classifier

• Hand-crafted features

• Neural network architectures

• Correcting mislabeled instances

5.1 Extracting BERT-embeddings for named
entities A, B, and pronouns

We concatenated embeddings for entities A, B,
and Pronoun taken from Cased and Uncased large
BERT “frozen” (not fine-tuned) models.10 We no-
ticed that extracting embeddings from intermedi-
ate layers (from -4 to -6) worked best for the task.
Also we added pointwise products of embeddings
for Pronoun and entity A, Pronoun and entity B as
well as AB - PP. First of these embedding vectors
expresses similarity between pronoun and A, the
second one expresses similarity between pronoun
and B, the third vector is supposed to represent the
extent to which entities A and B are similar to each
other but differ from the Pronoun.

5.2 Fine-tuning BERT classifier

Apart from extracting embeddings from original
BERT models, we also fine-tuned BERT classi-
fier for the task in hand. We made appropri-
ate changes to the “run_classifier.py” script from
Google’s repository.11 Preprocessing input data
for the BERT input layer included stripping text to
64 symbols, then into 4 segments, running BERT
Wordpiece for each segment, adding start and end
tokens (with truncation if needed) and concatenat-
ing segments back together. The whole prepro-
cessing is reproduced in a Kaggle Kernel12 as well
as in our final code on GitHub.13

5.3 Hand-crafted features

Apart from BERT embeddings, we also added 69
features which can be grouped into several cate-
gories:

• Neuralcoref,14 Stanford CoreNLP (Manning
et al., 2014) and e2e-coref (Lee et al., 2017)
model predictions. It turned out that these
models performed not really well in the task
in hand, but their predictions worked well as
additional features.

• Predictions of a Multi-Layered Perceptron
trained with ELMo (Peters et al., 2018b) em-
beddings

• Syntactic roles of entities A, B, and Pro-
noun (subject, direct object, attribute etc.) ex-
tracted with SpaCy 15.

• Positional and frequency-based (distances
between A, B, Pronoun and derivations,
whether they all are in the same sentence or
Pronoun is in the following one etc.). Many
of these features we motivated by the Hobbs
algorithm (Hobbs, 1986) for coreference res-
olution.

• Named entities predicted for A and B with
SpaCy

• GAP heuristics outlined in the corresponding
paper (Webster et al., 2018) and briefly dis-
cussed in Sec. 4

We need to mention that adding all these fea-
tures had only minor effect on the quality of pro-
noun resolution (resulted in a 0.01 decrease in log-
arithmic loss when measured on the Kaggle test
dataset) as compared to e.g. fine-tuning BERT
classifier.

5.4 Neural network architectures

Final setup includes:

• 6 independently trained fine-tuned BERT
classifiers with preprocessing described in
Subsec. 5.2. In Tables 1, 2, and 3, we re-
fer to their averaged prediction as to that of a
“fine-tuned” model ( )

• 5 multi-layered perceptrons trained with dif-
ferent combinations of BERT embeddings for
A, B, Pronoun (see Subsec. 5.1) and hand-
crafted features (see Subsec. 5.3), all together
referred to as “frozen” in Tables 1, 2, and 3
( ). Using MLPs with pre-trained BERT
embeddings is motivated by (Tenney et al.,
2019). Two MLPs- separate for Cased and
Uncased BERT models - both taking 9216-
d input and outputting 112-d vectors. Two
Siamese networks were trained on top of dis-
tances between Pronoun and A-embeddings,
Pronoun and B-embeddings as inputs. One
more MLP took only 69-dimensional fea-
ture vectors as an input. Finally, a single
dense layer mapped outputs from the men-
tioned 5 models into 3 classes corresponding
to named entities A, B or “Neither”.

• Blending ( ) involves taking predicted
probabilities for A, B and “Neither” with
weight 0.65 for the “fine-tuned” model and
summing the result with 0.35 times corre-
sponding probabilities output by the “frozen”
model.

In the next Section, we perform the analysis
identical to the one done in (Webster et al., 2018)
to measure the quality of pronoun resolution and
the severity of gender bias in the task in hand.

Table 1: Logarithmic loss reported for the GAP test set,
and Kaggle test (Stage 2) data for the model with fine-
tuned BERT classifier ( ), MLPs with pre-trained
BERT embeddings and hand-crafted features ( ) and
a blend of the previous two ( ). There are 66 correc-
tions done for GAP test labels as described in Subsec.
5.5.

5.5 Correcting mislabeled instances
During the competition, 158 label corrections
were proposed for the GAP dataset16 - when Pro-
noun is said to mention A but actually mentions
B and vice versa. For the GAP test set, this re-
sulted in 66 pronoun coreferences being corrected.
It’s important to mention that the observed misla-
beling is a bit biased against female pronouns (39
mislabeled feminine pronouns versus 27 misla-
beled masculine ones), and it turned out that most
of the gender bias for F1 score and accuracy comes
from these mislabeled examples.

6 Results

In Table 1, we report logarithmic loss that we
got on GAP test (“gap-test.tsv”), and Kaggle test
(Stage 2) datasets. Kaggle competition results
can also be seen on the final competition leader-
board.17 We report GAP test results as well to
further compare with the results reported in the
GAP paper: measured are logarithmic loss, F1
score and accuracy for masculine and feminine
pronouns (Table 2). Logarithmic loss and accu-
racy are computed for a 3-class classification prob-
lem (A, B, or Neither) while F1 is computed for
a 2-class problem (A or B) to compare with re-
sults reported by the Google AI Language team in
(Webster et al., 2018).

We also incorporated 66 label corrections as de-
scribed in 5.5 and, interestingly enough, this lead
to a conclusion that with corrected labels, models
are less susceptible to gender bias. Table 3 reports
the same metric in case of corrected labeling, and
we see that in this case the proposed models are

almost gender-unbiased.
These results imply that:

• Overall, in terms of F1 score, the proposed
solution compares very favorably with the re-
sults reported in the GAP paper, achieving as
high as 0.911 overall F1 score, compared to
0.729 for “Parallelism + URL” heuristic from
(Webster et al., 2018);

• Blending model predictions improves loga-
rithmic loss pretty well but does not impact
F1 score and accuracy that much. It can be
explained: logarithmic loss is high for con-
fident and at the same time incorrect predic-
tions. Blending averages predicted probabil-
ities so that they end up less extreme (not so
close to 0 or 1);

• With original labeling, all models are some-
what susceptible to gender bias, especially in
terms of logarithmic loss. However, in terms
of F1 score, gender bias is still less than for
e2e-coref and “Parallelism + URL” heuristic
reported in (Webster et al., 2018);

• Fixing some incorrect labels almost elimi-
nates gender bias, when we talk about F1
score and accuracy of pronoun resolution.

7 Conclusions and further work

We conclude that we managed to propose a BERT-
based approach to pronoun resolution which re-
sults in considerably better quality (as measured
in terms of F1 score and accuracy) than in case of
pronoun resolution done with heuristics described
in the GAP paper. Moreover, the proposed solu-
tion is almost gender-unbiased - pronoun resolu-
tion is done almost equally well for masculine and
feminine pronouns.

Further we plan to investigate which semantic
and syntactic information is carried by different
BERT layers and how it refers to coreference reso-
lution. We are also going to benchmark our system
on OntoNotes, Winograd, and DPR datasets.
