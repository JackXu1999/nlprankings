Abstract

The framing of an action influences how
we perceive its actor. We introduce conno-
tation frames of power and agency, a prag-
matic formalism organized using frame se-
mantic representations, to model how dif-
ferent levels of power and agency are im-
plicitly projected on actors through their
actions. We use the new power and
agency frames to measure the subtle, but
prevalent, gender bias in the portrayal of
modern film characters and provide in-
sights that deviate from the well-known
Bechdel test. Our contributions include
an extended lexicon of connotation frames
along with a web interface that provides
a comprehensive analysis through the lens
of connotation frames.

1 Introduction

A viewer’s impression of a movie character is in-
fluenced by how they are written and portrayed,
which can in turn influence how people form
stereotypes on gender norms (Behm-Morawitz
and Mastro, 2008). A character’s actions can be
projected with varying levels of power and agency,
depending on the specific verbs used. For instance,
somebody who “accepts” things is implied to be a
passive decision-maker (or of lower agency) than
somebody who “assesses” things. While not ex-
plicitly stated, these connotative meanings pro-
jected by different verbs can influence the assump-
tions the audience makes about the people being
described. These assumptions can have negative
consequences if they reinforce negative stereo-
types (Walton and Spencer, 2009).

To formalize this implicit information about
people projected by actions, we introduce power
and agency connotation frames, two new types of

predicate-specific connotative relationships as an
extension to Rashkin et al. (2016)’s connotation
frame lexicon. For instance, in Figure 1, the verb
“beckoning” implies that its theme (Irene) has less
power than its agent (the man). In the third line,
Irene displays strong agency when she “slices” in
self-defense. In contrast, when the man “obeys”,
the man has low implied agency.

Using the new connotation lexicon, we present
a quantitative study to reveal the subtle, but preva-
lent gender1 bias in modern films. Going beyond
the surface level analysis such as screen time or
number of female characters (Google, 2017), our
study aims for a more focused and precise anal-
ysis of power differentials between fictional men
and women.

In summary, our major contributions include the
creation and release of a lexicon with two new
connotative dimensions: power and agency and an

ducing it to a male-female binary is simplistic, however our
data limits a more complex understanding of gender.

shows the relative power differential implied by
the verb “implored”, i.e., the agent (“he”) is in
a position of less power than the theme (“the tri-

over the theme. The second example shows the

interactive demo website of our findings (see Fig-
ure 5 in the appendix for a screenshot).2 Further-
more, as will be seen in Section 4.1, connotation
frames offer new insights that complement and de-
viate from the well-known Bechdel test (Bechdel,
1986). In particular, we find that high-agency
women through the lens of connotation frames are
rare in modern films. It is, in part, because some
movies (e.g., Snow White) accidentally pass the
Bechdel test and also because even movies with
strong female characters are not entirely free from
the deeply ingrained biases in social norms.

2 Connotation Frames of Power and
Agency

We create two new connotation relations, power
and agency (examples in Figure 3), as an expan-
sion of the existing connotation frame lexicons.3

Three AMT crowdworkers annotated the verbs
with placeholders to avoid gender bias in the con-
text (e.g., X rescued Y; an example task is shown
in the appendix in Figure 7). We define the anno-
tated constructs as follows:

Power Differentials Many verbs imply the au-
thority levels of the agent and theme relative to

agency(AG)=− agency(AG)=+

one another. For example, if the agent “dom-
inates” the theme (denoted as power(AG>TH)),
then the agent is implied to have a level of control
over the theme. Alternatively, if the agent “hon-
ors” the theme (denoted as power(AG<TH)), the
writer implies that the theme is more important or
authoritative. We used AMT crowdsourcing to la-
bel 1700 transitive verbs for power differentials.
With three annotators per verb, the inter-annotator
agreement is 0.34 (Krippendorff’s α).

Agency The agency attributed to the agent of the
verb denotes whether the action being described
implies that the agent is powerful, decisive, and
capable of pushing forward their own storyline.
For example, a person who is described as “ex-
periencing” things does not seem as active and de-
cisive as someone who is described as “determin-
ing” things. AMT workers labeled 2000 transi-
tive verbs for implying high/moderate/low agency
(inter-annotator agreement of 0.27). We denote
high agency as agency(AG)=+, and low agency
as agency(AG)=−.

Pairwise agreements on a hard constraint are
56% and 51% for power and agency, respec-
tively. Despite this, agreements reach 96% and
94% when moderate labels are counted as agree-
ing with either high or low labels, showing that an-
notators rarely strongly disagree with one another.
Some contributing factors in the lower KA scores
include the subtlety of choosing between neutral

and positive/negative as well as the skews in the
distributions of labels (i.e. more positive than neg-
ative labels, see Figure 4). Note that a similar dif-
ference between KA scores and soft percent agree-
ment was found in our previous connotation frame
work (Rashkin et al., 2016).

3 Bias in Movie Scripts

We use 772 movie scripts from (Gorinski and La-
pata, 2015) as a test bed to validate our new con-
notation frames. Scripts have distinct structure,
which allows us to easily parse narrations, dia-
logues and character names.

We automatically extract 21K male/female
characters, using a name-gender list4 along with
gender specific lexicons (e.g., “actor”/“actresses”,
“duke”/“duchess”) to automatically assign gender
based on their first three narrations. To iden-
tify verbs with characters as their agent, we de-
pendency parse the narratives using the SpaCy5

parser. Power and agency label distributions in our
corpus are consistent with the annotation distribu-
tion (Figure 4), and there is little variance across
movies (see Figure 8 in the appendix).

In our dataset, there are nearly twice as many
men as there are women (34.6% women), in line
with previous findings by Smith et al. (2015)
and Radford and Gallé (2015). Women are also
less present on screen and speak less in movies
(Google, 2017). We control for that disparity in
all subsequent analyses by including the number
of words for each character (standardized) as a co-
variate. Findings in all the following sections hold
when controlling for movie genre (as retrieved
from IMDB.com), as well as when controlling for
effects from individual movies.

nificant results (∗∗ : p<.001) are in bold. “Male”
was coded as 0, “Female” as 1.

3.1 Bias in Narratives

Narratives describe what characters are doing. We
investigate how they vary in terms of power and
agency, using our connotation frames. We mea-
sure how each standardized frame metric is asso-
ciated with the gender of the character through a
logistic regression, controlling for the total num-
ber of words that the character said, and correcting
for multiple comparisons using Holm’s correction
(Holm, 1979).

Listed in Table 1, our results show that male
characters are portrayed with higher level of
agency compared to women. Men are also por-
trayed to have more authority than women as they
are more often the agent of powerful verbs.

This suggests that screenwriters tend to have fe-
male characters contribute more to the aesthetic of
the movie through low-agency verbs, rather than
the plot, which is reminiscent of existing gender
bias tests for movies (Yehl, 2013).

3.2 Bias in Character Expression

To further our validation of the new connota-
tive dimensions, we look at how characters ex-
press themselves in movies. Using our connota-
tion frames and LIWC (Tausczik and Pennebaker,
2016), we compile metrics for every character’s
dialogue. As in subsection 3.1, metrics were stan-
dardized for better β interpretability. LIWC re-
sults that are not discussed below can be found in
the appendix (Tables 4 and 5).

From Table 2, it seems male characters display
more power and authority through their speech
than their female counterparts do. Specifically,
women are written to use more hedges (# Hedges)
whereas men are written to use more imperative
sentences (# Imperative Sent.), a finding that re-

flects real-world dialogues (Prabhakaran et al.,
2014). The usage of imperatives tends to con-
vey power and dominance according to the find-
ings of Bramsen et al. (2011). Along with the fact
that female characters tend to agree (assent) more
than male characters, this corroborates the finding
in subsection 3.1 that male characters are gener-
ally given more power and agency. Furthermore,
male characters use inhibitory language more (in-
hib), which contains words pertaining to blocking
or allowing, suggesting that these characters are in
positions of power.

Further evidence of power imbalances is found
through function words. Women tend to use I and
you pronouns more, whereas men use we and they
pronouns more, echoing real life (Schwartz et al.,
2013). Kacewicz et al. (2014) found an associa-
tion between using “I” pronouns and being lower
status, and conversely between “we” pronouns and
being higher status. This corroborates the theory
that women in movies are generally portrayed with
a lower status than men.

Men in movies tend to mention more physi-
cal actions (space category) whereas women tend
talk about what “could” be but isn’t (discrep;
e.g.,“should”, “would”). This evokes more com-
manding connotations for male characters and
subordinate connotations for female ones, rein-
forcing gender stereotypes.

These findings, rooted in previous research,
confirm that our connotation frames capture exist-

ing bias in how male and female characters display
different levels of power and agency in their dia-
logue.

4 Power, Agency and the Bechdel test

A movie passes the Bechdel test (Bechdel, 1986) if
it (1) has two (named) female characters, (2) who
talk to each other, (3) about something other than a
man. While this is a low bar, a surprising number
of movies fail at least one of the three criteria. In
particular, as many as 42% of the movies in our
dataset fail the test according to an online database
of the Bechdel scores.6

4.1 Beyond the Bechdel Test

We provide comparative insights between the
analysis based on connotation frames and the
Bechdel test. First, we aggregate our connota-
tion frames, both on dialogue and narration, into
movie-level averages per gender. Then, we add
features capturing presence of female/male char-
acters (e.g., # F/M words, # F/M characters).
Table 3 shows the correlation between passing
the Bechdel test and our movie-level connotation
frame features using a multivariate logistic regres-
sion.

As expected, a movie with more female speak-
ing time is more likely to pass the Bechdel test
since it mostly captures female representation.
We also find that female characters using agent-
empowering verbs, which tend to be more as-
sertive, slightly increases the odds of passing the
Bechdel test. Female speakers who use empower-
ing verbs, regardless of the verb’s agent, tend to
go against the gender-norms of hedging and being
less assertive (as we showed in subsection 3.2).

Unexpectedly, movies where women talk with
high agency are much less likely to pass the

pus.

Bechdel test. Perhaps these movies typically
only show scenes of women interacting in a
male-dominated setting. Similarly, the use of
more agent-empowering verbs in female narra-
tives decrease the odds of passing the Bechdel
test. Chances of two powerful women talking to
each other might be lower because movies are less
likely to have a lot of powerful women.7

Power and Agency of Princesses We further
provide a qualitative analysis using Wikipedia plot
summaries for movies that are not in our script
dataset. Bechdel-passing movies with female pro-
tagonists, such as Frozen (2013) or Cinderella
(1950), still perpetuate negative female stereo-
types. In Frozen, Elsa is portrayed as the only
high agency, high power woman, as seen below.8

Anna and Cinderella, despite also being protago-
nists, display significantly less power and agency.

The Bechdel test is limited, either by being too
inclusive of movies who portray women in non-
authoritative, passive positions or by excluding
movies that have strong women with agency, who
just happen not to talk to each other about some-
thing besides men. Our extensions to the connota-
tion frame lexicon provide finer grained informa-
tion about how women are portrayed through their
expression and their actions, which can act com-
plementary to measures of their presence.

There is much prior research focus on bias in so-
cial media (Garcia et al., 2014; Prabhakaran et al.,
2014; Ratkiewicz et al., 2011; Yano et al., 2010;
Srivastava and Sahami, 2009), complementing our
investigation on movies. Fast et al. (2016) ex-
amine the stereotypes present in fan-fiction us-

7Similar observations may have inspired the Mako Mori
test (Romano, 2013), which looks at whether there’s a female
character with a story arc that doesn’t support a man’s.

verbs, which explains the low negative agency for all charac-
ters.

ing a lexicon-based strategy that focus on com-
monly gender-biased attributes (e.g., emotional for
women) rather than the overall power dynamics of
the story. In a similar vein, Ramakrishna et al.
(2015) learn word-level “gender ladenness” fea-
tures by looking at the neighbors of 925 manually
annotated words.

There exist various sets of high-level criteria to
assess gender bias of character portrayal in fic-
tion (Yehl, 2013; Romano, 2013; Powers, 2016).
Agarwal et al. (2015), in particular, automate the
Bechdel test using social network features, finding
that women are less central to the plot in movies
that fail it. We compare our linguistic analysis of
power and agency with the Bechdel test, demon-
strating the need for more fine-grained analysis of
how gender is depicted in movies.

Close in spirit to our investigation, Schofield
and Mehr (2016) train a number of classifiers over
movie scripts for determining the gender of indi-
vidual (and pairs) of speakers as well as the ex-
pected length of their relationships. In contrast,
we focus on understanding how the gender of a
given character implicitly relates to features that
track their control over their own path (agency)
and the world around them (power).

6 Conclusion

We created and released new connotation frames
of power and agency, allowing for more nuanced
writing analysis than previously possible. We vali-
date our new frames through a case study on movie
scripts. Specifically, we analyze differences in
power and agency for male and female characters,
and compare these dimensions to the Bechdel test.
Our connotation frames confirm evidence of im-
balances in gender portrayal in movies.
