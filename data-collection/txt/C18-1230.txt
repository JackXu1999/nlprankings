Abstract

In this paper, we propose a method for obtaining sentence-level embeddings. While the problem
of securing word-level embeddings is very well studied, we propose a novel method for obtaining
sentence-level embeddings. This is obtained by a simple method in the context of solving
the paraphrase generation task. If we use a sequential encoder-decoder model for generating
paraphrase, we would like the generated paraphrase to be semantically close to the original
sentence. One way to ensure this is by adding constraints for true paraphrase embeddings to be
close and unrelated paraphrase candidate sentence embeddings to be far. This is ensured by using
a sequential pair-wise discriminator that shares weights with the encoder that is trained with a
suitable loss function. Our loss function penalizes paraphrase sentence embedding distances from
being too large. This loss is used in combination with a sequential encoder-decoder network. We
also validated our method by evaluating the obtained embeddings for a sentiment analysis task.
The proposed method results in semantic embeddings and outperforms the state-of-the-art on the
paraphrase generation and sentiment analysis task on standard datasets. These results are also
shown to be statistically significant.

1 Introduction

The problem of obtaining a semantic embedding for a sentence that ensures that the related sentences
are closer and unrelated sentences are farther lies at the core of understanding languages. This would
be relevant for a wide variety of machine reading comprehension and related tasks such as sentiment
analysis. Towards this problem, we propose a supervised method that uses a sequential encoder-decoder
framework for paraphrase generation. The task of generating paraphrases is closely related to the task of
obtaining semantic sentence embeddings. In our approach, we aim to ensure that the generated paraphrase
embedding should be close to the true corresponding sentence and far from unrelated sentences. The
embeddings so obtained help us to obtain state-of-the-art results for paraphrase generation task.

Our model consists of a sequential encoder-decoder that is further trained using a pairwise discrim-
inator. The encoder-decoder architecture has been widely used for machine translation and machine
comprehension tasks. In general, the model ensures a ‘local’ loss that is incurred for each recurrent unit
cell. It only ensures that a particular word token is present at an appropriate place. This, however, does
not imply that the whole sentence is correctly generated. To ensure that the whole sentence is correctly
encoded, we make further use of a pair-wise discriminator that encodes the whole sentence and obtains an
embedding for it. We further ensure that this is close to the desired ground-truth embeddings while being
far from other (sentences in the corpus) embeddings. This model thus provides a ‘global’ loss that ensures
the sentence embedding as a whole is close to other semantically related sentence embeddings. This is
illustrated in Figure 1. We further evaluate the validity of the sentence embeddings by using them for the
task of sentiment analysis. We observe that the proposed sentence embeddings result in state-of-the-art
performance for both these tasks.

Our contributions are: a) We propose a model for obtaining sentence embeddings for solving the
paraphrase generation task using a pair-wise discriminator loss added to an encoder-decoder network. b)
We show that these embeddings can also be used for the sentiment analysis task. c) We validate the model
using standard datasets with a detailed comparison with state-of-the-art methods and also ensure that the
results are statistically significant.

Figure 1: Pairwise Discriminator based Encoder-Decoder for Paraphrase Generation: This is the basic
outline of our model which consists of an LSTM encoder, decoder and discriminator. Here the encoders
share the weights. The discriminator generates discriminative embeddings for the Ground Truth-Generated
paraphrase pair with the help of ‘global’ loss. Our model is jointly trained with the help of a ‘local’ and
‘global’ loss which we describe in section 3.

2 Related Work

Given the flexibility and diversity of natural language, it has always been a challenging task to represent
text efficiently. There have been several hypotheses proposed for representing the same. (Harris, 1954;
Firth, 1957; Sahlgren, 2008) proposed a distribution hypothesis to represent words, i.e., words which
occur in the same context have similar meanings. One popular hypothesis is the bag-of-words (BOW) or
Vector Space Model (Salton et al., 1975), in which a text (such as a sentence or a document) is represented
as the bag (multiset) of its words. (Lin and Pantel, 2001) proposed an extended distributional hypothesis
and (Deerwester et al., 1990; Turney and Littman, 2003) proposed a latent relation hypothesis, in which a
pair of words that co-occur in similar patterns tend to have similar semantic relation. Word2Vec(Mikolov
et al., 2013a; Mikolov et al., 2013b; Goldberg and Levy, 2014) is also a popular method for representing
every unique word in the corpus in a vector space. Here, the embedding of every word is predicted
based on its context (surrounding words). NLP researchers have also proposed phrase-level and sentence-
level representations (Mitchell and Lapata, 2010; Zanzotto et al., 2010; Yessenalina and Cardie, 2011;
Grefenstette et al., 2013; Mikolov et al., 2013b). (Socher et al., 2011; Kim, 2014; Lin et al., 2015; Yin et
al., 2015; Kalchbrenner et al., 2014) have analyzed several approaches to represent sentences and phrases
by a weighted average of all the words in the sentence, combining the word vectors in an order given by a
parse tree of a sentence and by using matrix-vector operations. The major issue with BOW models and
weighted averaging of word vectors is the loss of semantic meaning of the words, the parse tree approaches
can only work for sentences because of its dependence on sentence parsing mechanism. (Socher et al.,
2013; Le and Mikolov, 2014) proposed a method to obtain a vector representation for paragraphs and use
it to for some text-understanding problems like sentiment analysis and information retrieval.

Many language models have been proposed for obtaining better text embeddings in Machine Trans-
lation (Sutskever et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2014; Vinyals and Le, 2015; Wu et al., 2016), question
generation (Du et al., 2017), dialogue generation (Shang et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016b; Li et al., 2017a),



2717

document summarization (Rush et al., 2015), text generation (Zhang et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2017; Yu et
al., 2017; Guo et al., 2017; Liang et al., 2017; Reed et al., 2016) and question answering (Yin et al., 2016;
Miao et al., 2016). For paraphrase generation task, (Prakash et al., 2016) have generated paraphrases using
stacked residual LSTM based network. (Hasan et al., 2016) proposed a encoder-decoder framework for
this task. (Gupta et al., 2017) explored a VAE approach to generate paraphrase sentences using recurrent
neural networks. (Li et al., 2017b) used reinforcement learning for paraphrase generation task.

3 Method

In this paper, we propose a text representation method for sentences based on an encoder-decoder
framework using a pairwise discriminator for paraphrase generation and then fine tune these embeddings
for sentiment analysis task. Our model is an extension of seq2seq (Sutskever et al., 2014) model for
learning better text embeddings.

3.1 Overview

Task: In the paraphrase generation problem, given an input sequence of words X = [x1, ..., xL], we need
to generate another output sequence of words Y = [q1, ..., qT ] that has the same meaning as X . Here L
and T are not fixed constants. Our training data consists of M pairs of paraphrases {(Xi, Yi)}Mi=1 where
Xi and Yi are the paraphrase of each other.

Our method consists of three modules as illustrated in Figure 2: first is a Text Encoder which
consists of LSTM layers, second is LSTM-based Text Decoder and last one is an LSTM-based
Discriminator module. These are shown respectively in part 1, 2, 3 of Figure 2. Our network with all
three parts is trained end-to-end. The weight parameters of encoder and discriminator modules are shared.
Instead of taking a separate discriminator, we shared it with the encoder so that it learns the embedding
based on the ‘global’ as well as ‘local’ loss. After training, at test time we used encoder to generate
feature maps and pass it to the decoder for generating paraphrases. These text embeddings can be further
used for other NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis.

Figure 2: This is an overview of our model. It consists of 3 parts: 1) LSTM-based Encoder module
which encodes a given sentence, 2) LSTM-based Decoder Module which generates natural language
paraphrases from the encoded embeddings and 3) LSTM-based pairwise Discriminator module which
shares its weights with the Encoder module and this whole network is trained with local and global loss.

3.2 Encoder-LSTM

We use an LSTM-based encoder to obtain a representation for the input question Xi, which is represented
as a matrix in which every row corresponds to the vector representation of each word. We use a one-hot
vector representation for every word and obtain a word embedding ci for each word using a Temporal



2718

CNN (Zhang et al., 2015; Palangi et al., 2016) module that we parameterize through a function G(Xi,We)
where We are the weights of the temporal CNN. Now this word embedding is fed to an LSTM-based
encoder which provides encoding features of the sentence. We use LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber,
1997) due to its capability of capturing long term memory (Palangi et al., 2016). As the words are
propagated through the network, the network collects more and more semantic information about the
sentence. When the network reaches the last word (Lth word), the hidden state hL of the network
provides a semantic representation of the whole sentence conditioned on all the previously generated
words (q0, q1..., qt). Question sentence encoding feature fi is obtained after passing through an LSTM
which is parameterized using the function F (Ci,Wl) where Wl are the weights of the LSTM. This is
illustrated in part 1 of Figure 2.

3.3 Decoder-LSTM
The role of decoder is to predict the probability for a whole sentence, given the embedding of input
sentence (fi). RNN provides a nice way to condition on previous state value using a fixed length hidden
vector. The conditional probability of a sentence token at a particular time step is modeled using an
LSTM as used in machine translation (Sutskever et al., 2014). At time step t, the conditional probability
is denoted by P (qt|fi, q0, .., qt−1) = P (qt|fi, ht), where ht is the hidden state of the LSTM cell at time
step t. ht is conditioned on all the previously generated words (q0, q1.., qt−1) and qt is the next generated
word.

Generated question sentence feature p̂d = {p̂1, . . . , p̂T } is obtained by decoder LSTM which is
parameterized using the function D(fi,Wdl) where Wdl are the weights of the decoder LSTM. The output
of the word with maximum probability in decoder LSTM cell at step k is input to the LSTM cell at step
k + 1 as shown in Figure 2. At t = −1, we are feeding the embedding of input sentence obtained by the
encoder module. Ŷi = {q̂0, q̂1, ..., q̂T+1} are the predicted question tokens for the input Xi. Here, we are
using q̂0 and q̂T+1 as the special START and STOP token respectively. The predicted question token (q̂i)
is obtained by applying Softmax on the probability distribution p̂i. The question tokens at different time
steps are given by the following equations where LSTM refers to the standard LSTM cell equations:

d−1 = Encoder(fi)

h0 = LSTM(d−1)

dt =Wd ∗ qt,∀t ∈ {0, 1, 2, ...T − 1}
ht+1 = LSTM(dt, ht),∀t ∈ {0, 1, 2, ...T − 1}
p̂t+1 =Wv ∗ ht+1
q̂t+1 = Softmax(p̂t+1)

Losst+1 = loss(q̂t+1, qt+1)

(1)

Where q̂t+1 is the predicted question token and qt+1 is the ground truth one. In order to capture local label
information, we use the Cross Entropy loss which is given by the following equation:

Llocal =
−1
T

T∑
t=1

qtlogP(q̂t|q0, ..qt−1) (2)

Here T is the total number of sentence tokens, P(q̂t|q0, ..qt−1) is the predicted probability of the sentence
token, qt is the ground truth token.

3.4 Discriminative-LSTM
The aim of the Discriminative-LSTM is to make the predicted sentence embedding fpi and ground truth
sentence embedding fgi indistinguishable as shown in Figure 2. Here we pass p̂d to the shared encoder-
LSTM to obtain fpi and also the ground truth sentence to the shared encoder-LSTM to obtain f

g
i . The

discriminator module estimates a loss function between the generated and ground truth paraphrases.
Typically, the discriminator is a binary classifier loss, but here we use a global loss, similar to (Reed et al.,



2719

2016) which acts on the last hidden state of the recurrent neural network (LSTM). The main objective of
this loss is to bring the generated paraphrase embeddings closer to its ground truth paraphrase embeddings
and farther from the other ground truth paraphrase embeddings (other sentences in the batch). Here
our discriminator network ensures that the generated embedding can reproduce better paraphrases. We
are using the idea of sharing discriminator parameters with encoder network, to enforce learning of
embeddings that not only minimize the local loss (cross entropy), but also the global loss.

Suppose the predicted embeddings of a batch is ep = [f

discriminator and encoder module. As we can see that our proposed method EDD-LG(shared) clearly
outperforms the other ablations on all metrics and detailed analysis is present in section 4.1.3.

4 Experiments

We perform experiments to better understand the behavior of our proposed embeddings. To achieve this,
we benchmark Encoder Decoder Discriminator Local-Global (shared) (EDD-LG(shared)) embeddings
on two text understanding problems, Paraphrase Generation and Sentiment Analysis. We use the Quora
question pairs dataset 1 for paraphrase generation and Stanford Sentiment Treebank dataset (Socher et al.,

1website: https://data.quora.com/First-Quora-Dataset-Release-Question-Pairs



2720

2013) for sentiment analysis. In this section we describe the different datasets, experimental setup and
results of our experiments.

4.1 Paraphrase Generation

Paraphrase generation is an important problem in many NLP applications such as question answering,
information retrieval, information extraction, and summarization. It involves generation of similar meaning
sentences.

4.1.1 Dataset

We use the newly released Quora question pairs dataset for this task. The dataset consists of over 400K
potential question duplicate pairs. We have IDs for each question in the pair, the full text for each question,
and a binary value that indicates whether the questions in the pair are truly a duplicate of each-other.
Wherever the binary value is 1, the question in the pair are not identical; they are rather paraphrases of
each-other. So, for our study, we choose all such question pairs with binary value 1. There are a total of
149K such questions. Some examples of question and their generated paraphrases can be found in Table 3.
More results are present in the appendix.

Table 2: Analysis of Baselines and State-of-the-Art methods for paraphrase generation on Quora dataset.
As we can see clearly that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin in
terms of BLEU and TER scores. Detailed analysis is present in section 4.1.4. A lower TER score is better
whereas for the other metrics, a higher score is better. Details for the metrics are present in the appendix.

4.1.2 Experimental Protocols

We follow the experimental protocols mentioned in (Gupta et al., 2017) for the Quora dataset. In our
experiments, we divide the dataset into 2 parts 145K and 4K question pairs. We use these as our training
and testing sets. We further divide the training set into 50K and 100K dataset sizes and use the rest 45K
as our validation set. We trained our model end-to-end using local loss (cross entropy loss) and global
loss. We have used RMSPROP optimizer to update the model parameter and found these hyperparameter
values to work best to train the Paraphrase Generation Network: learning rate = 0.0008, batch size =
150, α = 0.99, � = 1e− 8. We have used learning rate decay to decrease the learning rate on every epoch
by a factor given by:

Decay factor = exp
(
log(0.1)

a ∗ b

)
where a = 1500 and b = 1250 are set empirically.

Table 3: Examples of Paraphrase generation on Quora Dataset. We observe that our model is able to
understand abbreviations as well and then ask questions on the basis of that as is the case in the second
example.

4.1.3 Ablation Analysis

We experimented with different variations for our proposed method. We start with baseline model which
we take as a simple encoder and decoder network with only the local loss (ED-Local) (Sutskever et al.,
2014). Further we have experimented with encoder-decoder and a discriminator network with only global
loss (EDD-Global) to distinguish the ground truth paraphrase with the predicted one. Another variation of
our model is used both the global and local loss (EDD-LG). The discriminator is the same as our proposed
method, only the weight sharing is absent in this case. Finally, we make the discriminator share weights
with the encoder and train this network with both the losses (EDD-LG(shared)). The analyses are given in
table 1. Among the ablations, the proposed EDD-LG(shared) method works way better than the other
variants in terms of BLEU and METEOR metrics by achieving an improvement of 8% and 6% in the
scores respectively over the baseline method for 50K dataset and an improvement of 10% and 7% in the
scores respectively for 100K dataset.

4.1.4 Baseline and State-of-the-Art Method Analysis

There has been relatively less work on this dataset and the only work which we came across was that
of (Gupta et al., 2017). We further compare our method EDD-LG(shared) model with their VAE-SVG-eq
which is the current state-of-the-art on Quora datset. Also we provide comparisons with other methods
proposed by them in table 2. As we can see from the table that we achieve a significant improvement of
24% in BLEU score and 11% in TER score (A lower TER score is better) for 50K dataset and similarly
22% in BLEU score and 7.5% in TER score for 100K dataset.

4.1.5 Statistical Significance Analysis

We have analysed statistical significance (Demšar, 2006) for our proposed embeddings against different
ablations and the state-of-the-art methods for the paraphrase generation task. The Critical Difference (CD)
for Nemenyi (Fišer et al., 2016) test depends upon the given α (confidence level, which is 0.05 in our
case) for average ranks and N (number of tested datasets). If the difference in the rank of the two methods
lies within CD, then they are not significantly different, otherwise they are statistically different. Figure 3
visualizes the post hoc analysis using the CD diagram. From the figure, it is clear that our embeddings
work best and the results are significantly different from the state-of-the-art methods.

4.2 Sentiment Analysis with Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST) Dataset
4.2.1 Dataset
This dataset consists of sentiment labels for different movie reviews and was first proposed by (Pang and
Lee, 2005). (Socher et al., 2013) extended this by parsing the reviews to subphrases and then fine-graining
the sentiment labels for all the phrases of movies reviews using Amazon Mechanical Turk. The labels are
classified into 5 sentiment classes, namely {Very Negative, Negative, Neutral, Positive, Very Positive}.
This dataset contains a total 126k phrases for training set, 30k phrases for validation set and 66k phrases
for test set.

4.2.2 Tasks and Baselines
In (Socher et al., 2013), the authors propose two ways of benchmarking. We consider the 5-way fine-
grained classification task where the labels are {Very Negative, Negative, Neutral, Positive, Very Positive}.
The other axis of variation is in terms of whether we should label the entire sentence or all phrases in
the sentence. In this work we only consider labeling all the phrases. (Socher et al., 2013) apply several
methods to this dataset and we show their performance in table 4.

4.2.3 Experimental Protocols
We follow the experimental protocols as described in (Socher et al., 2013). To make use of the available
labeled data, in our model, each subphrase is treated as an independent sentence and we learn the
representations for all the subphrases in the training set. After learning the vector representations
for training sentences and their subphrases, we feed them to a logistic regression to learn a predictor
of the movie rating. At test time, we freeze the vector representation for each word, and learn
the representations for the sentences using gradient descent. Once the vector representations for
the test sentences are learned, we input them to a logistic regression model to predict the movie

rating. In order to train a sentiment classification model, we have used RMSPROP, to optimize the
classification model parameter and we found these hyperparameter values to be working best for our case:
learning rate = 0.00009, batch size = 200, α = 0.9, � = 1e− 8.

4.2.4 Results

We report the error rates of different methods in table 4. We can clearly see that the bag-of-words or
bag-of-n-grams models (NB, SVM, BiNB) perform poorly. Also the advanced methods (such as Recursive
Neural Network (Socher et al., 2013)) perform much better on the task of fine-grained sentiment analysis.
Our method outperforms all these methods by an absolute margin of 15.7% which is a significant increase
considering the rate of progress on this task. We have also uploaded our models to the online competition
on Rotten Tomatoes dataset 2 and obtained an accuracy of 62.606% on their test-set of 66K phrases.
We also provide 5 examples for each sentiment in table 5. We can see clearly that our proposed embeddings
are able to get the complete meaning of smaller as well as larger sentences. For example, our model
classifies ‘Although it bangs a very cliched drum at times’ as Negative and ‘Although it bangs a very
cliched drum at times, this crowd-pleaser’s fresh dialogue, energetic music, and good-natured spunk are
often infectious.’ as positive showing that it is able to understand the finer details of language. More
results and visualisations showing the part of the phrase to which the model attends while classifying are
present in the appendix. The link for the project website and code is provided here 3.

5 Conclusion

In this paper we have proposed a sentence embedding using a sequential encoder-decoder with a pairwise
discriminator. We have experimented with this text embedding method for paraphrase generation and
sentiment analysis. We also provided experimental analysis which justifies that a pairwise discriminator
outperforms the previous state-of-art methods for NLP tasks. We also performed ablation analysis for our
method, and our method outperforms all of them in terms of BLEU, METEOR and TER scores. We plan
to generalize this to other text understanding tasks and also extend the same idea in vision domain.

A Appendix

A.1 Quantitative Evaluation
We use automatic evaluation metrics which are prevalent in machine translation domain: BLEU (Papineni
et al., 2002), METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), ROUGE-n (Lin, 2004) and Translation Error
Rate (TER) (Snover et al., 2006). Previous work has shown that these metrics can perform well for
the paraphrase recognition task (Madnani et al., 2012) and correlate well with human judgments in
evaluating generated paraphrases (Wubben et al., 2010). BLEU considers exact match between reference
paraphrases and system generated paraphrases using the concept of modified n-gram precision and
brevity penalty, whereas ROUGE considers recall for the same. METEOR also uses stemming and
synonyms (using WordNet) while calculating the score and is based on a combination of unigram-
precision and unigram-recall with the reference paraphrases. TER is based on the number of edits
(insertions, deletions, substitutions, shifts) required for a human to convert the system output into one of
the reference paraphrases. We provided our results using all these metrics and compared it with existing
baselines.

A.2 Paraphrase Generation
Here we provide some more examples of the paraphrase generation task in table 6. Our model is also able
to generate sentences which capture higher level semantics like in the last example of table 6.

A.3 Sentiment Analysis
We also provide visualization of different parts of the sentence on which our model focuses while
predicting the sentiment in Figure 4 and some more examples of the Sentiment analysis task on SST
dataset in Table 7.

A.3.1 Sentiment Visualization of the sentence
(Li et al., 2016a) have proposed a mechanism to visualize language features. We conducted a toy
experiment for our EDD-LG(shared) model. Figure 4 represents saliency heat map for EDD-LG(shared)
model sentiment analysis. We obtained 60 dimensional feature maps for each word present in the target
sentence. The heat map captures the measure of influence of the sentimental decision. In the heat map,
each word of a sentence (from top to bottom, first word at top) represents its contribution for making the



2728

sentimental decision. For example in the first image in 4, the word ‘comic’ contributed more (2nd word,
row 10-20). Similarly in the second image, first, second, and third (‘A’,‘wildly’,‘funny’) words have more
influence for making this sentence have a positive sentiment.

(Very Positive) 
A comic gem with some serious

sparkles. 
(Neutral) 

A hero can stumble sometimes 
(Positive) 

A wildly funny prison caper 

                                 (Very Negative) 
This one is pretty miserable, resorting to string-pulling rather
than legitimate character development and intelligent plotting 

(Negative) 
No good jokes, no good scenes, 

barely a moment

Figure 4: These are the visualisations for the sentiment analysis for some examples and we can clearly
see that our model focuses on those words which we humans focus while deciding the sentiment for any
sentence. In the second image, ‘wildly’ and ‘funny’ are emphasised more than the other words.
