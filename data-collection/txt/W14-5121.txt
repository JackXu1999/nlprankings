Abstract
While large data dependent techniques
have made advances in between-genre
classification, the identification of sub-
types within a genre has largely been over-
looked. In this paper, we approach auto-
matic classification of within-genre Bun-
deli folk music into its subgenres; Gaari,
Rai and Phag. Bundeli, which is a domi-
nant dialect spoken in a large belt of Ut-
tar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh has a
rich resource of folk songs and an atten-
dant folk tradition. First, we success-
fully demonstrate that a set of common
stopwords in Bundeli can be used to per-
form broad genre classification between
standard Bundeli text (newspaper corpus)
and lyrics. We then establish the prob-
lem of structural and lexical similarity in
within-genre classification using n-grams.
Finally, we classify the lyrics data into
the three genres using popular machine-
learning classifiers: Support Vector Ma-
chine (SVM) and kNN classifiers achiev-
ing 91.3% and 85% and accuracy respec-
tively. We also use a Naı̈ve Bayes clas-
sifier which returns an accuracy of 75%.
Our results underscore the need to extend
popular classification techniques to sparse
and small corpora, so as to perform hith-
erto neglected within genre classification
and also exhibit that well known classi-
fiers can also be employed in classifying
‘small’ data.

1 Introduction

Bundeli is spoken in regions of Madhya Pradesh
and Uttar Pradesh, in a region known as Bundelk-

hand, which encompasses several administrative
districts in India. While the 2001 census identi-
fies 3,070,000 Bundeli speakers, Ethnologue esti-
mates 20,000,000 speakers1. Inspite of the large
population, Bundeli, often considered a dialect of
Western Hindi, would be considered an under-
resourced language because of the lack of tex-
tual and literary resources that are available. Bun-
delkhand, however, is home to a rich tradition of
lyrical styles and genres that are both performa-
tive and poetic. In addition to the major gen-
res; Gaaris, Rais and Phags, several other gen-
res can be found in this region, including Sora,
Hori, and Limtera. With the exception of sev-
eral Phags2, Bundeli is a resource poor language,
in that there are no available sources of textual
material. Using a bag-of-words technique on the
lyrics corpus, and Term Frequency-Inverse Docu-
ment Frequency tfidf scores, we report on the per-
formance of a k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN) clas-
sifier. We demonstrate that a 10-fold kNN cross
validation exhibits an accuracy of nearly 85% in
classifying within the Bundeli folk genres when a
k of 2 neighbours is used. Using the SVM clas-
sification, we achieve an accuracy of over 90%.
Following a brief description of related classifica-
tion techniques applied to song genre classifica-
tion within Indian and Western music, in general,
in section 2 below, we provide a detailed account
of methods used for creating news and folk song
lyrics corpora in section 3. Following that, in sec-
tion 4, we emphasize the need to use commonly-
removed stopwords towards affecting a classifica-
tion between news and song lyrics corpora. In
this section, we also report on the feasibility of
using probability density functions on word level

n-grams to better understand lexical and structural
similarity within-genres. In section 5, we present
detailed classification analyses on the song lyrics
corpus and show the extent of accuracy that can
be achieved when popular machine learning tech-
niques are employed to classify within folk genres,
that exhibit a great deal of lexical and structural
overlap. In Section 6, we present the conclusions
our analysis and also future directions for further
research.

2 Related Work

Song genre classification as one of the primary
tasks of music information retrieval, has been ap-
proached from analysis and classification of au-
dio signal features (Kini et al., 2011; Jothilak-
shmi and Kathiresan, 2012; Tzanetakis and Cook,
2002); retrieval of lyrics based features (Howard
et al., 2011; Mayer et al., 2008) and approaches
which use both audio and lyrics based features
for genre classification (Mayer and Rauber, 2011;
Neumayer and Rauber, 2007). Within the West-
ern context, both popular, classical, and folk mu-
sic genres have been classifed using common ma-
chine learning algorithms. The techniques used
for classification include both stochastic and prob-
abilistic methods; Hidden Markov Models (Chai
and Vercoe, 2001), Machine-learning etc. How-
ever, within the Indian context most all work
on song genre classification has been restricted
to audio feature vector extraction and classifica-
tion. More precisely, various classification tech-
niques such as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM),
k-nearest neighbour (kNN) classifiers and Support
Vector Machine classifiers (SVM) have been em-
ployed to classify between Hindustani, Carnatic,
Ghazal, Folk and Indian Western genres (Kini
et al., 2011) and north Indian devotional music
(Jothilakshmi and Kathiresan, 2012). The only in-
stance of lyrics based classification has been ex-
plored in the context of Bollywood music in an
effort to identify specific features of Bollywood
song lyrics using Complex Networks (Behl and
Choudhury, 2011). However, classification of folk
genres has not received any attention so far. In
this paper, we propose a two-fold approach, first,
we suggest that classification between broad text
genres such as news and songs can be success-
fully accomplished using common stopwords in
Bundeli. And second, we also demonstrate that
big data based machine learning approaches could

be successfully used to classify, relatively small
corpus of Bundeli folk songs into specific genres;
namely, Gaari, Rai and Phag.

3 Corpus Creation

The three genres Gaari, Phag and Rai were cho-
sen because they are commercially available in the
form of analog audio tapes. These audio tapes
were digitized and converted to MP3 format for
transcription and future analyses. As far as stylis-
tic register go, gaaris are marriage songs that are
sung in repeated choruses. The chorus is period-
ically repeated after each verse. Phags are lyrical
poems, showing rich lexical diversity and rhyth-
mic meter. Rais are dance songs, sung to the beat
of the increasing speed of the Dholak (local per-
cussion instrument). In Rais, we see the usage
of repeated lines more than any other genre. In
Gaaris and Rais, a significant level of semantic
overlap can be predicted. Both use simple, con-
versational terms, and owing to their content being
repeated, they pose a challenge for classification.
These patterns can be evinced from repetitive cho-
ruses as in Figure 1, below.

Figure 1: Panel A depicts Gaari with repeated cho-
rus. Panel B shows Rais with repeated lines. Panel
C shows the lyrical form of the Phag

Therefore, within-genre classification remains a
problem at the textual level because there is signif-
icant lexical overlap between Gaaris and Rais.

3.1 Song Corpus

The songs come from various sources. Our first
source was a collection from an oral tradition of
singing from regions near Sagar, Madhya Pradesh.
Online videos and audio cassestes from a Jhansi
based casette company, Kanhaiya Casette, became
our second source. Phags were mined from a web134



resource for poetry and prose which contains col-
lections of the famous Bundeli poet Isuri 3. Isuri’s
phags, however, are also available in a few text-
books on Bundeli folk culture. The lyrics were or-
thographically transcribed by listening to the song
files in MP3 format in Devanagari. Owing to poor
audio quality of the songs, they required a native
Bundeli speaker for transcription, the first author
being one. Orthographic normalisation was main-
tained for words that used non-contrastive phone-
mic or morphological features. For example, the
function word “se” and “sein” meaning “from”
was normalised to “sein”. Similarly for “un-
honein” and “unne”, meaning third person erga-
tive was normalised to “unne”. Where necessary,
similar normalization procedures were used to ho-
mogenize orthographic variation. Since there was
no available list of stopwords, we adopted the cor-
responding stoplist from Hindi. We narrowed the
scope of the exhaustive stopword list by select-
ing only the most frequent stopwords occurring in
songs.

3.2 News corpus

Before analysing the songs within themselves, we
needed to establish a differentiation between a
generalised corpus and a song corpus. The only
available online resource was the publication of a
Delhi-based region specific newspaper4. Although
the newspaper was published in Bundeli, there was
no normalisation of dialectal variation. The arti-
cles featuring from Mahoba region alone were the
ones that could be employed for comparison with
our song corpus. This website was not properly
designed using standardised web-designing tech-
niques, and automatic web-scraping techniques.
So the data was hand-mined by copy-pasting the
relevant region-specific articles. Details of the
song and news corpora are presented in Table 1.
While 98 news articles formed the news corpus,
the song corpus consisted of 37, 39 and 40 Gaaris,
Rais, and Phags, respectively.

4 News and Song Corpus Classification

Most common text classification methods, includ-
ing music genre classification, begin by remov-
ing common stopwords derived from a general-
ized corpus. Token frequencies of a set of 7
common stopwords was used for the purpose of

this classification. One way ANOVA with Broad
Genre as predictor shows a significant main effect
F[1,26]=5.438;p<0.05. As the boxplot in Figure
2 shows, stopword token frequencies are signifi-
cantly higher in news as compared to songs. Thus,
stopwords when included in any corpus, can help
classify news from songs, even though, more com-
monly, stopwords are excluded during the prepro-
cessing stages of standard classification-based ap-
proaches.

We also performed a test of lexical diversity to
classify between the news and song corpus. Using
Python scripts we calculated the type-token ratio
of the two broad genres. The news corpus had a
lexical diversity of 0.028% while the song corpus
had nearly half the lexical diversity of the news
corpus, i.e., 0.014%.

4.1 Kernel Density Estimates

Kernel Density Estimates (KDEs) of ngram terms
are generated using Equation 1 below. KDE is
a non-parametric estimate of the probability den-
sity function of random variables, in this case the
counts of the ngrams. KDEs allow for better in-
ferences about the population, based on a real
and finite data sample. KDEs make it possible
for us to examine the probability density function
of ngrams for the various genres. Based on the135



KDEs we make inferences about the possible pres-
ence of categorical features in the sample based on
smoothed bins and probability density. Equation
1 shows the KD function estimator. In our esti-
mates, we use a normal kernel such that K(x) =
φ(x), where φ is the standard normal density func-
tion.

4.2 Structural Description using KDEs

After making a collection of the entire corpus, we
employed n-gram methods to examine the struc-
tural distribution of the data with respect to the
genres. Therefore, using Python scripts, we first
generated unigrams, bigrams and trigrams for all
the 3 genres. Then, we used R Studio to generate
KDEs to identify the n-gram based structural de-
scription of Gaaris, Rais and Phags. A frequency
range was used such that it captured the most fre-
quent n-gram terms in Gaaris, Rais and Phags.

The figures show a representation of the n-gram
structure of the songs. As can be seen in the three
figures, unigrams and bigrams show a high degree
of overlap between the three genres in the same
frequency range. The genres cannot be differen-
tiated using the structural description detailed by
the unigrams and bigrams. In the case of trigrams,
although the peaks of the distribution differ, the
probability density is extremely low. These terms
would easily be eliminated in the sparsity calcu-
lation and cannot be termed as predictors of the
genre-variation. The KDEs show a structural de-
scription of the songs, establishing the existing
overlap in the three genres.

5 Classification using Machine Learning
Techniques

kNN, SVM and Naı̈ve Bayes classifiers were the
machine-learning techniques used for the pur-
pose of this classification. The pre-processing
techniques included collection and compilation
of the corpus made of text files. The corpus
was cleaned of stopwords, punctuation marks and
white-spaces. The sparsity was set to 85%. A
term-document matrix was created from the cor-
pus where each song file is converted to a vector
space where term frequency-inverse document fre-
quencies (tfidf ) are stored. The tf (term frequency)

Bigrams and Trigrams

scores were calculated with Equation 2 and the in-
verse document document frequency (idf) scores
were calculated with equation 3. The product of
the tf and idf scores are used to train a classifier
with 10-fold cross-validation.

The tf-idf scores are a product of the tf and idf

For training, the rows and columns of the train-
ing set and the genre names for just the training
set, and for testing, the rows and columns ex-
cluding that of genre names is passed to the kNN
model. A sparsity of 85% is maintained for the
training dataset.

ing, testing and cross-validation

A first pass kNN classification yields an ac-
curacy of 86.95% when k=2 nearest neighbours
are used to measure the distance between the tfidf
scores with a precision of 0.818 and an F-score
of 0.9. A 10-fold cross-validation is then em-

ployed to choose the optimal k-neighbour, results
of which are given in Table 2. Based on the lowest
test, CV mean and CV Standard errors an optimal
K=2 is found to be the best kNN classifier for our
dataset. The results of the k=fold cross-validation
can be seen in Figure 4.

5.2 SVM Classification
We use the e1071 package in R to perform a SVM
classification on the songs dataset (Meyer et al.,
2014). The term-document matrix used for kNN
classification is passed to the SVM algorithm. We
partition the corpus into training and test sets. An
80-20% partition is used for training and test, re-
spectively. Thus, the training dataset contains 93
songs, and the test dataset has 23 songs. The
training data contains the genre-labels but the test
dataset does not. When a 5-fold cross-validated
SVM is trained, the SVM performs classification
with a diagonal accuracy of 91.3% and kappa ac-
curacy of 85.7%. Table 3 shows the confusion ma-
trix as predicted by the SVM Classifier.

5.3 Naı̈ve Bayes Classification
We use the e1071 package in R to perform a Naı̈ve
Bayes classification on the songs dataset (Meyer
et al., 2014). The term-document matrix used for
kNN classification is passed to the Naı̈ve Bayes
algorithm. We partition the corpus into training
and test sets. An 80-20% partition is used for
training and test, respectively. Thus, the training
dataset contains 93 songs, and the test dataset has
23 songs. The training data contains the genre-
labels but the test dataset does not. When trained,
the Naı̈ve Bayes performs classification with a di-
agonal accuracy of 78.2% and kappa accuracy of
68.4%. Table 4 shows the confusion matrix as pre-
dicted by the Naı̈ve Bayes Classifier.

6 Conclusions and Further Research

In this paper, we explored both statistical and
machine-learning techniques to perform lyrics-137

based classification within the genres of Bundeli
folk music. Using different sources, we created a
corpus of 116 Bundeli folk songs to perform clas-
sification. To separate lyrics from standard Bun-
deli texts, we performed a broad-genre classifica-
tion using stopwords and lexical diversity mea-
sures. Finally, we extended existing machine-
learning techniques to successfully classify the
three genres. Our findings report that popular
methods of classification that are employed on
’big data’ can be used to perform within-genre
classification. Our results indicate that the SVM
and kNN Classifiers perform better than Naı̈ve
Bayes classifier.

The present research can be extended to clas-
sify more genres in Bundeli folk-music. The
models can be further expanded to include genre-
classification from other dialects of Western Hindi
like Awadhi, Bagheli and Braj. The lyrics-based
approach can be combined with an audio-feature
vector analysis to build a multi-modal classfica-
tion system.
