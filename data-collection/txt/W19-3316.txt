Abstract

Research on adpositions and possessives in
multiple languages has led to a small inven-
tory of general-purpose meaning classes that
disambiguate tokens. Importantly, that work
has argued for a principled separation of the se-
mantic role in a scene from the function coded
by morphosyntax. Here, we ask whether
this approach can be generalized beyond ad-
positions and possessives to cover all scene
participants—including subjects and objects—
directly, without reference to a frame lexicon.
We present new guidelines for English and the
results of an interannotator agreement study.

1 Introduction

Studies of verbal argument structure have estab-
lished some clear semantic correlations of syntactic
relations like subject and object, and there are vari-
ous approaches to expressing these generalizations
using categorical semantic roles (Fillmore, 1968,
1982; Levin, 1993) or bundles of proto-properties
(Dowty, 1991; Reisinger et al., 2015) that gener-
alize across verbs. A parallel line of work (§2)
has looked at the meanings coded by grammati-
cal phrase-markers such as prepositions and pos-
sessives and how to disambiguate them. These
inquiries necessarily overlap because many prepo-
sitions mark verb arguments or modifiers. Conse-
quently, insights from the study of prepositions/
case may improve the meaning representation of
core syntactic arguments, or vice versa.

In this paper, we investigate whether SNACS
(Schneider et al., 2018b), an approach to semantic
disambiguation of adpositions and possessives, can
be adapted to cover syntactically core grammatical
relations (subjects and objects). We believe this
may have several practical advantages for NLP.

First, many of the semantic labels in SNACS de-
rive from VerbNet (Kipper et al., 2008) role labels.

However, VerbNet and other frame-semantic ap-
proaches like FrameNet (Fillmore and Baker, 2009)
and PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) assume a lexi-
con as a prerequisite for semantic role annotation.
This can be an obstacle to comprehensive corpus
annotation when out-of-vocabulary predicates are
encountered. But is a lexicon really necessary for
role annotation? A general-purpose set of role la-
bels with detailed criteria for each can potentially
bypass coverage limitations of lexicon-based ap-
proaches, while still supporting some degree of
generalization across grammatical paraphrases.

Second, the nonreliance on a lexicon potentially
simplifies the annotation process in some respects.
For example, no explicit predicate disambiguation
step is necessary, and the annotator does not need
to consult frame-specific role definitions.1

Third, the semantic criteria for SNACS labels are
designed to be language-neutral, and investigations
thus far suggest that they can be generalized to
languages besides English (Hwang et al., 2017;
Zhu et al., 2019). While this paper focuses on
English, we see the future opportunity for cross-
lingual extension without the construction of new
lexicons as a major advantage.

Finally, SNACS is unique in allowing two se-
mantic labels per target, one reflecting a level of
meaning closer to the grammatical coding, and the
other at a deeper level associated with the predicate
scene type (§3). We show below that the SNACS
analysis, while designed for PPs, can be extended
to subjects and objects, to the extent that the coarse-
grained inventory distinguishes roles in the scene.

We summarize SNACS in §2, and in §3 propose
a strategy for adapting SNACS for English subjects

1On the other hand, consulting a frame-specific set of core
roles may simplify the role labeling task for an annotator, pro-
ducing higher-quality annotations. In the future it may be
worth exploring a hybrid solution that maps lexicon-defined
roles to supersenses and asks the annotator to apply super-
senses directly only for out-of-vocabulary predicates.

and objects. This involves minor changes to the
label inventory and new annotation guidelines for
a variety of challenging phenomena. We conduct a
pilot interannotator agreement study on Wikipedia
articles (§4) and release the annotations.2

2 Background

The SNACS3 hierarchy is a taxonomy of coarse-
grained supersenses developed to mark semantic
relations as expressed by adpositions (prepositions
+ postpositions) and possessives (Schneider et al.,
2018b). The complete SNACS hierarchy is shown
in figure 1 with our modifications highlighted.

SNACS includes the usual thematic relations
(e.g., AGENT, THEME, RECIPIENT) and adjunct
relations (e.g., TIME, LOCUS including locations,
PURPOSE) used by most resources designed for
SRL annotation. SNACS diverges from the general
predicate-argument labeling standards in its inclu-
sion of non-standard roles such as ORIGINATOR in
creation (creator), transfer (giver) and communica-
tion (speaker) events, and labels regarding proper-
ties involved in a static relationship to one another
(e.g., POSSESSION in “owner of the car”).

Unlike labels used by efforts such as PropBank
and FrameNet, SNACS labels are highly coarse-
grained and generalize across various scenes and
situations. This approach also differs from frame-
alternation–based lexicons like VerbNet, which de-
fines classes of verbs whose members exhibit simi-
lar syntactic alternations involving the same subset

3Semantic Network of Adposition and Case Supersenses

of roles. Instead, SNACS places the burden of
semantics directly on a fixed set of supersenses,
forgoing the use of frame (or class) definitions. The
supersenses can be thought of as disambiguating
coarse-grained adposition senses. The supersense
labels effectively encapsulate—at a highly abstract/
schematic level—various basic scenarios that are
important to language and grammar, such as transi-
tive action, motion, unidirectional transfer/commu-
nication, and psychological events, as well as sta-
tive relations like possession, quantity, comparison,
and identity. SNACS does not formalize a seman-
tic core/non-core or argument/adjunct distinction,
though roles in the PARTICIPANT hierarchy are typ-
ically core and roles in the CIRCUMSTANCE hier-
archy are typically non-core in predicate-argument
annotation schemes like PropBank and FrameNet.

SNACS further adopts a device called construal
(Hwang et al., 2017), explained below.

3 Applying SNACS

We adopt the SNACS labels originally developed
for disambiguating adpositions and possessives as
exemplified in (1) and extend their use to annotate
the subject and object of a verb as seen in (2).

(1) a. The bagel was eaten byAGENT Jane.
b. Jane dined onTHEME a bagel.

(2) [Jane]AGENT ate [a bagel]THEME.

Following the construal approach, which is il-
lustrated in table 1 for adpositions, we separate
two semantic dimensions of an annotation target:
Scene Role: What semantic role is most closely as-
sociated with the type of scene (typically indicated
by the verb/predicate)? Function: What semantic
role is most salient in the morphosyntactic coding
of the phrase (with a grammatical relation like sub-
ject or object, or overt marking with closed-class
morphology like adpositions and case)? Consider
the following examples. Construal is notated by
SCENE ROLE↝FUNCTION.

(3) [Jane]RECIPIENT↝AGENT bought [the
book]POSSESSION↝THEME.

(4) [Bingley]SOCIALREL↝THEME married
[Jane]SOCIALREL↝THEME.

The scene role indicates the participation role of
the target in the scene described by the verb. Jane
is the RECIPIENT in a transfer scene in (3), and
she is in a certain social relationship with Bingley
(i.e., SOCIALREL) given the marriage scene in (4).
The function label, on the other hand, captures the

Table 1: SNACS for adpositions/possessives (Schneider et al., 2018b,a). The scene role and function annotations
are labels from figure 1 and are often but not always congruent for a particular token. The function annotation
reflects the semantics of the morphosyntactic coding (such as the choice of adposition). Note that, especially for
adnominal PPs and genitives, the governor sometimes does not lexically denote an event or state; rather, a semantic
relation such as possession or part-whole is indicated by the morphosyntax.

orthogonal dimsension of agency which is more
closely tied to syntactic realization: Jane is the
AGENT of the buying action, while the book is the
THEME in (3); Jane and Bingley are the THEMEs
of the marriage in (4). Further examples are shown
in figure 2. In many cases, the scene role will be
identical to the function. These are called congru-
ent construals. But in other cases, they can differ,
as illustrated in table 1.

In the rest of the section, we discuss a few dif-
ficult cases while assessing SNACS labels for the
annotation of subject and objects, and decisions
made regarding these challenges including slight
deviations from the latest SNACS standards.
Scene role prioritization. In some cases, multi-
ple supersenses are equally applicable at the scene
level. In such cases, we give highest priority to
more complex and less frequent scene types such as
transfer (ORIGINATOR, RECIPIENT) or employee-
organization (or social) relations (ORGMEMBER,
ORG, SOCIALREL). The causal roles (AGENT,
INSTRUMENT, THEME), if appearing in the scene
position, are prioritized next. The highly frequent
locative scenes (LOCUS, SOURCE, GOAL) are
given the lowest priority. In example (10), the
subject “I” could be considered either a metaphor-
ical source location of the recommendation (i.e.,
SOURCE) or can be considered the speaker in a
communication event (i.e., ORIGINATOR). The lat-
ter scene is prioritized, and the scene roles ORIGI-
NATOR, TOPIC (i.e., the message), and RECIPIENT
reflect the prioritized choice.

(10) [I]ORIGINATOR↝AGENT recommended [the
book]TOPIC↝TOPIC [to him]RECIPIENT↝GOAL.

Transfer of possession often implies change of
location, and being a part of something often im-
plies being located in it. If both are salient, for
the scene role annotation, we prioritize the more

complex scene over the locative semantics:

(11) [Jane]RECIPIENT↝AGENT took the book from
me.

(12) I relinquished the book [to
Jane]RECIPIENT↝GOAL.

(13) At the play, he spotted Mary [in the
cast]ORG↝LOCUS.

In (11, 12), Jane is arguably a GOAL of motion by
virtue of being a RECIPIENT of something physi-
cal. We do not use GOAL as the scene role, how-
ever, if RECIPIENT applies. In (13), Mary can be
understood as part of the cast (which is an orga-
nization) or as located within the cast. We prior-
itize the former. Other pairs that tend to overlap
include: RECIPIENT/BENEFICIARY, closely cor-
related when someone is given or told something
for their benefit or harm—we prioritize RECIPIENT
for the scene role; and STIMULUS/TOPIC, closely
correlated when a thought or message triggers an
emotional reaction—we prioritize STIMULUS for
the scene role.

If two equally prioritized scenes are in conflict
with one another, we rely on the semantics of the
predicate to disambiguate the scene. Note that in
(14), CJ is likely an employee of the White House.
However, CJ is not considered the ORGMEMBER
as the verb “brief” does not intrinsically conven-
tionalize the employee-organization relationship
in its semantics. With a predicate that conven-
tionally encodes employment or some other sta-
ble relationship—employ, hire, work for/at, etc.—
ORGMEMBER would be annotated.

(14) [CJ]ORIGINATOR↝AGENT briefs the press [for the
White House]ORG↝BENEFICIARY.

labels such as AGENT or THEME to appear multi-
ple times in a given scene, opting for the use of a
“Co-” label for the second participant sharing the
same role (e.g., CO-AGENT). In applying SNACS
guidelines for subjects and objects, this became
untenable, as “Co-” prefixation could apply to a
good majority of the PARTICIPANT labels, threat-
ening a quick proliferation of the supersenses. E.g.,
(4) would require CO-SOCIALREL, (16) would re-
quire CO-EXPERIENCER, and so forth. In an effort
to keep the supersense inventory limited, we di-
verge from the latest SNACS standards to allow
role duplication in a scene. This is allowed even
when targets assigned the same role are not fully
symmetric or are qualitatively distinct as in (17).

dinner]THEME↝THEME.

(16) [He]EXPERIENCER↝THEME heard the news [with a
stranger]EXPERIENCER↝ACCOMPANIER.

(17) Replace [the old one]THEME↝THEME [with the new
one]THEME↝ACCOMPANIER.

Thematic hierarchy. As discussed above, the
function label generally reflects AGENT-THEME
relations of a proposition. More specifically, we
annotate all subjects and direct objects with a func-
tion in the following thematic hierarchy: {AGENT,
CAUSER} > {INSTRUMENT, MEANS} > {THEME,
TOPIC, COST}. In a transitive clause, the super-
sense of the subject cannot be ranked lower than the
direct object (e.g., a subject construed as a THEME
cannot have a direct object construed as an AGENT).
Indirect objects in the English double object con-
struction4 are treated as RECIPIENT construals.

(18) I sent [John]RECIPIENT↝RECIPIENT a cake.

(19) I sent a cake [to John]RECIPIENT↝GOAL.

(20) I baked [John]RECIPIENT↝RECIPIENT a cake.

(21) I paid [John]RECIPIENT↝RECIPIENT [$10]COST↝COST.

4If there is a single overt object, we treat it as an indirect
object if what would normally be a direct object is implicit:
e.g., John is treated as an indirect object in I told John. (where
the content of what is told is implicit).

Copular sentences. These are treated differently
from non-copular sentences. The English copula
relates a subject to an object in what is semantically
an identificational (22a) or predicational (22b) re-
lationship. To these cases we assign IDENTITY-
IDENTITY or GESTALT-CHARACTERISTIC at the
scene level, respectively. Roughly speaking, IDEN-
TITY indicates the identified or identifying cate-
gory or referent, and CHARACTERISTIC indicates
a property being ascribed to the GESTALT:

(22) a. [John]IDENTITY↝IDENTITY is [a
man]IDENTITY↝IDENTITY.

b. [John]GESTALT↝THEME is
[tall]CHARACTERISTIC↝CHARACTERISTIC.

Open issues. The unresolved problem of
causatives and caused-motion constructions is
discussed in appendix A.

4 Interannotator Agreement Study

Data. We piloted our guidelines using a sample
of 100 scenes from the English UCCA-annotated
Wiki corpus5 as detailed by Abend and Rappoport
(2013). UCCA is a scheme for annotating coarse-
grained predicate-argument structure such that
syntactically varied paraphrases and translations
should receive similar analyses. It captures both
static and dynamic scenes and their participants,
but does not mark semantic roles.
Annotators. Four annotators (A, B, C, D), all
authors of this paper, took part in this study. All
are computational linguistics researchers.
Datasets. Prior to development of guidelines for
subjects and objects, one of the annotators (Anno-
tator A) sampled 106 Wiki documents (44k tokens)
and tagged all 10k instances of UCCA Participants6

with a supersense based on the existing guidelines
5http://cs.huji.ac.il/~oabend/ucca.html; the

Wikipedia corpus contains 369 documents (biographies
of entertainment industry figures) with 159k tokens and
36k Participant units.

6The UCCA category Participant is broader than the PAR-
TICIPANT supersense, also including locations, for example.

for adpositions. This preliminary dataset was used
to stimulate discussion for developing guidelines
for subjects and objects. Once the new guidelines
were written, four annotators first annotated a prac-
tice dataset of 48 UCCA Participant tokens, then
adjudicated disagreements through discussion and
clarified certain policies before annotating a final
sample of 100 tokens for measuring agreement.7

Participant units were sampled based on the pre-
liminary annotation, stratified across subtypes of
PARTICIPANT and CONFIGURATION to ensure di-
versity. In the final sample, the syntactic distribu-
tion is as follows: 31 subjects (including 4 passive
subjects and 6 copular subjects); 26 objects (includ-
ing 1 indirect object and 2 copular complements);
42 PPs; and 1 possessive.
Coverage of the hierarchy. Under the PARTIC-
IPANT tree in the hierarchy, there are 12 super-
senses, of which 11 were used as scene roles and
9 as functions. (By design, PARTICIPANT itself is
never used and exists only to organize the hierar-
chy.) The CONFIGURATION tree includes 19 super-
senses, of which 14 were used as scene roles and 10
as functions. In the CIRCUMSTANCE tree—which
primarily applies to syntactic adverbials—GOAL,
LOCUS, SOURCE, MANNER, MEANS, and CIR-
CUMSTANCE were all used as functions, and all but
SOURCE also appeared as a scene role.
Quantitative IAA results. We first compare
agreement on two subsamples: the subject/object
Participants, and the prepositional phrase Partici-
pants. Pairwise Cohen’s κ scores appear in table 2.

Subjects/objects: For the scene role, all anno-
tators agree on 46% of items (26/57), and at least
3 annotators on 84%. For the function, 51% have
total agreement, and 86% have a majority. Average
pairwise κ is 0.66 for scene and 0.61 for function.

PPs: At the scene level, 48% (20/42) have to-
tal agreement, and 71% have a majority. For the
function, 64% have total agreement, and 88% have
a majority. Average pairwise κ is 0.64 for scene
and 0.77 for function.

74 tokens where annotators noticed a problem with the
UCCA annotation were discarded and replaced.

Thus subjects/objects (SOs) receive higher scene
role agreement than PPs—somewhat surprising
given that the labels were originally designed for
prepositions! This may be an artifact of the par-
ticular sample, or may indicate that the scene role
is more intuitive for SOs than for PPs. PPs have
higher agreement than SOs with respect to function;
this may be due to some difficulty deciding between
AGENT and THEME for the function of SOs, plus
the availability of extensive guidelines/examples
for prepositional SNACS annotation.8

Disagreements involving agentivity. We found
it can be difficult to choose between AGENT and
THEME for the function of a subject with borderline
agentivity, e.g., in scenes of befriending someone
or forming a musical group with others. Likewise,
the line between AGENT and THEME for the func-
tion can be unclear in cognition/perception scenes
like [She] enjoyed the fame and [She] saw the so-
cial scene as tedious and superficial. We decided
the annotator should consider whether the scene
involves judgment or is more of a passive experi-
ence; EXPERIENCER↝THEME would thus apply to
the first example and EXPERIENCER↝AGENT to
second.9 Finally, the line between CAUSER and IN-
STRUMENT can be unclear in sentences like I was
hit [by a car] and I was quoted [by a magazine].
UCCA issues. We found a handful of UCCA an-
notation errors—primarily where two verbs were
analyzed as separate scenes but the first ought to
be considered a light verb. A more interesting
case was the relation between the two bolded ex-
pressions in William S. Paley set terms that in-
cluded. . . ownership of the negative at the end of
the contract. The UCCA annotation treats William
S. Paley as a Participant of ownership (i.e., the
owner). Though POSSESSOR is a natural scene
role for the owner of something, we concluded
that this was an indirect inference not suitable for
annotating with a function.

5 Conclusion

We explored whether a system for semantic relation
annotation can be extended beyond prepositions
and possessives to cover English subjects and ob-
jects. While initial annotation results are promising,
further work is needed to substantiate the approach
on a larger scale, and ideally in multiple languages.

8Raw agreements are higher than kappa, but the same
trends hold.

9There is precedent for this distinction in FrameNet’s Per-
ception_active vs. Perception_experience frames.

A Open Issues

Sometimes a sentence will construe a scene as in-
volving more arguments than a predicate normally
licenses, as in the following causative or caused-
motion examples (Goldberg, 2006):

(23) [Rachel]THEME↝? sneezed (implicit: blew) [the
napkin]THEME↝THEME [off the table]PATH↝SOURCE.

(24) [Rachel]AGENT↝? (implicit: caused) jumped [the
horse]AGENT↝THEME [over the fence]PATH↝PATH.

So far, we have posited the scene to be the situation
or event described by the predicate. The problem
is that in addition to the scene evoked by the verb
(sneezing in (23) and jumping in (24)), there is
an added caused-motion scene whose semantics
derives from the construction. Should there be an
indication that the sneezer is also the causer of
motion, and that the ultimate causer of jumping is
separate from the impelled jumper? One possible
solution would be to add implicit predicates so the
verb- and construction-triggered scenes would be
annotated separately. A different solution may be
to relax the definition of what constitutes a scene
to allow for non-predicate-driven scenes as well.
