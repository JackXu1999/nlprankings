Abstract
At the early phase of the Great East Japan
Earthquake a vast number of tweets were
made on Twitter. Even though many
of them were calling for emergency res-
cue, they were not found timely due to
the vast number of tweets including well-
intentioned tweets to support those emer-
gency rescues. In order to deal with
the situation, the authors developed and
launched a website on March 16, 2011,
which automatically extracts rescue re-
quests, categorizes similar statements into
several statements and then lists them.
This paper covers in detail not only the
technology of the system but also how it
has already collaborated and been applied
to #99japan, a project to support de-
livering emergency rescue requests. Note
that #99japan is an activity to monitor
the process of the rescue based on Twit-
ter and coming from the thread started by
temporary volunteers who organized on a
Japanese textboard 2 “2chan-
nel.”

1 Introduction

The Great East Japan Earthquake occurred on
March 11, 2011 has obviously caused a wide range
of damages. At the early phase of the earthquake,
a large number of transmissions of information
were made not only through mass-media in exis-
tence such as TV broadcast, newspaper and maga-
zines but also social media such as Twitter. While
the leading mass-media companies focused on in-
formation about the seriousness and damages due
to the earthquake at affected areas for general pub-
lic, the information which is useful for disaster

survivor were also absolutely imperative. Under
this situation, local radio broadcast, local news-
paper and social media contributed to satisfy the
needs.

From the early phase of the earthquake, a
vast number of the tweets with the hashtag
’#j j helpme’, meaning requesting rescues,
were made on Twitter, one of the most famous
social media in Japan. These kinds of tweets in-
cluded “[Want to spread the infor-
mation]”, so that well-intentioned people who just
wanted to contribute to help people highly tended
to retweet those tweets unconditionally. As the re-
sult, similar rescue requests were flowed on Twit-
ter and this made it very difficult to trace whether
the rescue requests were actually reported to rele-
vant authorities, which is the most important pro-
cess.

In order to deal with the situation, we developed
a website on March 15, 2011, which automatically
extracts rescue requests, categorizes similar state-
ments into several statements and then lists them
and launched the website on the next day (Aida
et al., 2011; Aida et al., 2013). This paper cov-
ers in detail not only the technology of the sys-
tem but also how it has already collaborated and
been applied to #99japan, a project to support
delivering emergency rescue requests. Note that
#99japan is an activity to monitor the process
of the rescue based on Twitter and coming from
the thread started by temporary volunteers who
organized on a Japanese textboard 2
“2channel”.

2 Rescue Requests

2.1 Identification of Rescue Requests
We analysed the vast number of rescue requests in
the early stages of the earthquake on Twitter; as a
result, we identified the following four cases:

1. Primary rescue request information;

2. Secondary rescue request information, in-
cluding redundant information;

3. Non-rescue request information; and

4. Rescue completion report.

We call information categorized in the case 1
or 2 rescue requests and one in the case 3 a
non-rescue request respectively. Information cat-
egorized in the case 2 also includes a statement
that contains the string “[Want to
spread the information].” Volunteers might not
know whether or not each request was reported
to authorities at each information; however, they
still understood the current situation in the disas-
ter area from a remote location by spread requests.
Primary rescue requests on Twitter correspond to
original tweets by some survivor and each sec-
ondary ones correspond to retweet, reply or men-
tion.

On Twitter, it should be noted that statement is
preceded by a time series back from the beginning
of a sentence, where each quoted statement is post-
fix, and the primary rescue request is shown at the
last place of the tweet in many cases:

user1: a mention for user2; RT
@user2: a mention for user3; RT

@user3 . . . RT @usern: a primary

rescue request.

2.2 Rescue Requests
In order to extract rescue requests on Twitter, we
tried to find the words below that tended to be in-
cluded in rescue requests, categorized them, and
then summarized them as regular expressions in
heuristics:

1. Rescue requests should include the follow-
ing:

• Words included in street addresses in or-
der to identify the address of the rescue
request (5 words).

• Words related to the safety confirmation
and to circumstances of life lines (21
words).
Example: “whereabouts,”
“serious,” “request,” “evacua-
tion.”

2. Non rescue requests should include the fol-
lowing:

• Proper names that have been included in
the past false rumours (14 words).
Example: “Hanayama village,”
which became Kurihara city merged
with other surrounding municipalities in
2005, so it did not exist in 2011.

• Official Twitter account names of the
news media, because the media has al-
most already reported to relevant author-
ities (20 words).
Examples: radio rfc japan,
fct staff, [Aa]sahi, FKSminpo,
[Nn][Hh][Kk], nhk seikatsu,
i jijicom eqa, kahoku shimpo,
akt akita tv, NTV,
telebee tnc, NISHINIPPON,
zakdesk, 781fm.

• Specific person’s names, such as
celebrities and politicians, countries,
party names and organization names,
because there is no possibility of rescue
requests including the thought and creed
(9 words).
Examples: “Democratic Party
of Japan,” “Liberal Demo-
cratic Party of Japan,” “Social
Democratic Party,” “Communist
Party,”

• The names of countries and interna-
tional organizations, because they are al-
most secondary information of the news
media (6 words).
Examples: “USA,”
“France,” “United Nations,”

“UNICEF.”
• Words related to the nuclear accident,

because rescue requests are not in-
clude scientific technical terminology
(10 words).
Examples: “cesium,”
“iodine,” “uranium,”

20



“plutonium,” “radiation,”
“radioactivity.”

• Words unused in rescue requests (8
words).
Examples: “laughing,” “criti-
cism,” “terrorism.”

• Words included in tweets using too
many hashtags, because they are inde-
pendent of the original meaning of the
tags (6 words).
Examples: “forecasts market,”

“risk manage-
ment information.”

3 Listing Policy for Rescue Requests

In the early stages of the earthquake, because we
needed to release immediately our site extracting
rescue requests, we decided to dare to volume dis-
play their requests on a single page in order for
users not to look over information that they needed
due to the info glut. Our site has been displayed
300 requests initially but now displayed 1000 re-
quests at one time.

There were two reasons why we adopted the
policy as listed below:

1. Extracted requests might include noise infor-
mation. If we tightened filtering rules by our
regular expression, it would be possible that
the serious rescue requests would not be dis-
played.

2. By displaying rescue requests on the same
page, volunteers could search requests in de-
fault feature of any web browser and, further-
more, avoid from checking multiple pages
due to pagination.

Based on this policy, we manufacture a system ex-
tracting rescue requests by way of trial March 15,
2011, and launched the website on the next day
(Aida et al., 2011).

3.1 Extraction Algorithm of Rescue Request
Information

Overview of the method of extraction algorithm
of rescue request information on Twitter is as fol-
lows:

1. Obtain HTMLs on the tweet information in-
cluding each search word listed in Figure 1
which is related to the earthquake disaster.

2. Perform the following process for all infor-
mation obtained:

(a) Merge tweets included in the HTMLs
into the existing log file of the site and
store the merged log file.

(b) Preclude what appears to be non-rescue
request information from the extracted
log file by filtering according to the rules
described in Section 2.2

(c) Produce a similar tweet key by the fol-
lowing procedure based on the result of
(b):

i. Remove the longest string of up to
“@” from the beginning of a tweet
sentence.

ii. Convert a similar tweet key into
15 letters obtained by removing the
Japanese syllabary and ASCII char-
acters.

(d) Classify tweets into equivalent tweet
classes, where we call the oldest tweet
in equivalent class represented tweet,
by using an associative array of similar
tweet keys.

3. Make a list of latest 1000 items including the
following lines and update the site:

• Sentence of a represented rescue request
tweet;

• Tweet latest date and time of the tweet;
• Tweet oldest date and time of the tweet:
• The number of tweets in class including

the tweet; and
• Estimated source URL in the

form “http://twitter.com/
screen_name/statuses/
tweet_ID”) .

4 Rescue Activity

In web-based rescue activities, volunteers needed
to share situations about rescue activities. After
our site opened, we scouted out for such activi-
ties to cooperate the site and really participated in
a rescue activity #99japan organized by Kaichi
Tamiya.

Figure 1: Search Words to Extract Rescue Re-
quests

4.1 Situation on the Net of In the Early
Stages of the Great East Japan
Earthquake

In the early stages of the earthquake, many activi-
ties have been launched in the Net. Disaster infor-
mation has been made public in portal sites such
as Yahoo! and Google.

In particular, “Google Person Finder” was well-
known safety as confirmation system, which was
used from the Haiti earthquake of January 2010
(Google, 2011). “ANPI NLP” was a project
launched by voluntary researchers to augment the
safety information of the system from the Net in a
method of natural language processing (Murakami
et al., 2011; Neubig et al., 2011).

As a system including rescue operations, “sin-
sai.info” was also well-known (Seki et al., 2011).
The site was constructed using a crowdsourcing
tool Ushahidi, which was used in many disasters
since 2007 and was famous as a system built on the
day of the earthquake. Also, a variety of systems
were published such as sites displaying a time line
of tweets related to the earthquake tags on Twitter,

radiation dose maps and so on.
However, countless volunteers and systems

across the country could not quickly cooperate
necessarily in the early stage; rather, utilizing ex-
isting systems, volunteers had decided the rules by
trial and error and was involved in rescue activi-
ties.

In textboard 2channel, the thread on rescue ac-
tivities (2channel, 2011) was opened immediately
in the day of the earthquake, Some anonymous
volunteers participated in the thread launched a
Wiki (2channel ID:nx64KwTT, 2011) and a res-
cue map (#99japan, 2011a) on the earthquake.

4.2 Rescue Assistance Project for The Great
East Japan Earthquake: #99japan

March 15, 2011, Kaichi Tamiya (Twitter ID:
@ktamiya) was managing a report activity his-
tory by using the comments section of his blog
(Tamiya, 2011a). March 18, inviting members
our rescue support activities taking advantage fol-
lowers on Twitter, he organized ‘the rescue as-
sistance project for The Great East Japan Earth-
quake #99japan” (Tamiya, 2011b).

Overview of this project activity was as follows:

• : Twitter

Purpose: We notify agencies about the res-
cue requests obtained from the Net, such as
Twitter, to save the survivors.

• :

Activities: We report of rescue requests, ver-
ify the accuracy of request information and
advice for survivors, until request supplies
prevail in disaster-stricken areas and the ar-
eas enter the first stages of recovery.

This project adopted an existing editing rule
for the rescue request map (#99japan, 2011a)
and a supply request map (#99japan, 2011b),
which were based on Google maps. In addi-
tion administrators of the maps also participated
in #99japan, so it was notable that #99japan
was one of the rescue projects for survivors in the
early phase of the Great East Japan Earthquake.
#99japan was also a hashtag on Twitter

as well as a project name. Any member of

22



#99japan could tweet many rescue requests and
related activities appended with #99japan on
Twitter, so their tweets shared among members.
Of course, their tweets were also visible in the
non-members. It was the biggest feature to com-
municate among users by the hashtag #99japan
in the Twitter-based activities.

We proposed using our site to volunteers of
#99japan to find rescue requests on the Net ef-
ficiently.

4.3 Activity Flow
We show below the activity flow of information
sharing, map editing and source verification in
#99japan (@ma chiman, 2011):

• Information sharing and map editing:
1. Member of the project tweets rescue re-

quest information with a street address
obtained by our site or other informa-
tion sources, to which are appended the
string “#99japan” as a hashtag in or-
der to facilitate to share information to
the members in a short period of time.

2. According to of the shared information,
member selects a point of the street ad-
dress on the map and reports to relevant
organizations such as the police, where
the point is classified into
(a) not reported;
(b) reported but unknown whether re-

solved;
(c) resolved already; or
(d) other.

3. Member fills in the content of report to
the pop-up point in the map in a descrip-
tion rules.

• Source verification work:
1. To update the local information that is

constant number of days elapsed from
the time of the rescue request, mem-
ber follow the information providers and
ask the change of environment.

2. Member contacts the neighbourhood
residents, asks their situation and writes
a checking status to the map.

3. Depending on the content and the pres-
ence or absence of reply, member re-
flects the following information on the
pop-up of the point at the map:

(a) resolved;
(b) there is no new information;
(c) not contact; or
(d) other information,
which are added the modified date and
Twitter ID of reporting member.

4.4 Cooperative Rescue Activities with
#99japan and Our Site

We continued to improve the site after the date as
March 20 to conform to the needs of members.

We show a line graph about the number of ac-
cesses to the site as Figure 2. Analyzing the graph,

Figure 2: Changes in the Number of Accesses Our
Site Extracting Rescue Requests.

we have confirmed the following trends:

• The number of accesses was particularly high
activity immediately after the start of March
20 and the release date.

• Early April emerged from an emergency
state, the number of accesses was increased
temporarily.

• When large afterquakes was invoked in
Miyagi April 4 and Fukushima of April 11
and 12 respectively, the number of accesses
was increased again.

There was no quantitative data to show whether
our site was helpful. Because most of the project
members at the time is the anonymous partici-
pant, it is too difficult for our site to survey effi-
ciency of rescue. However, we got good evaluated
tweets on Twitter by the project #99japan chair
Tamiya, @ma chiman who opened the official
website (@ma chiman, 2011) of the project,
and the rescue map (#99japan, 2011a) admin-
istrator @juntaro33 as follows:

23



• Immediately after organizing #99japan,
@ma chiman suggested that the project
members used our site to find rescue requests.
(March 20, 2011.)

• When we implemented several additional
functions into our site, @ma chiman and
@juntaro33 admire our implementation.
(March 25, 2011.)

• @juntaro33 said that he was using our site
as the most useful now. (April 2, 2011.)

• @juntaro33 said that most of the informa-
tion on the map were obtained from our site.
(April 6, 2011.)

By the project activity used the rescue map and
the supply request map (Figure 3), The project had
reporting and supporting activities more than 200
points on the rescue and supply request maps, re-
spectively, in about three weeks until early April.

#99japan.

5 Consideration for Our Actively

Looking back on #99japan, it was important
to have 2channel textboard as a virtual place to
gather in case of large earthquake existed. In fact,
2channel users became volunteers and shared dis-
aster information such as rescue requests on the
day of the earthquake on several social media,
such as Twitter, mixi which was a famous SNS in
Japan, Wiki sites and so on.

Then, Twitter users and others naturally joined
the #99japan and they could share more res-
cue requests on Twitter. In particular, utilizing
“#99japan” as a hashtag was a very signifi-
cant as a mechanism that could be shared rescue
progress and completion report. Importance of
progress and completion report like this has been

pointed out by many researchers on Twitter (Ya-
mazaki et al., 2012).

In the rescue activities, “freshness of the rescue
request information” was particularly important;
our site had contributed to the report activities sup-
port efficient, utilized as a source of information
sources to #99japan.

6 Conclusion and Future Work

We developed and launched a website which ex-
tracted and listed rescue requests among all the in-
formation on Twitter on March 16, 2011, which
was right after the Great East Japan Earthquake.

Through participating and collaborating with
the activities of #99japan, a relief project of the
Great East Japan Earthquake based on Twitter, it
has turned out that exchanging messages to find
appropriate information, report and check the sta-
tus of the process on a timely basis based on the
information of rescue requests listed on the web-
site.

According to the requests of the members of
#99japan, we also made efforts in order to in-
crease the precision of extraction of information
of rescue requests and to improve functions of the
website for that. It is reported that social media
was taken advantage of in backup activities at the
early phase after the earthquake.

Further research could be analyzing the needs
among the log file of the website which is still
processing at present, and creating a well adaptive
system for the disaster recovery relief.

It should be also noted that fortunately sev-
eral important factors got connected by chance in
#99japan. However it is also important to refine
a framework of social system for letting volunteers
work effectively and rapidly at disasters and at fol-
lowing restriction activities now in normal time.
