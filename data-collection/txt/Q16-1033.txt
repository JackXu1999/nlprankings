Abstract

Mental illness is one of the most pressing pub-
lic health issues of our time. While counsel-
ing and psychotherapy can be effective treat-
ments, our knowledge about how to conduct
successful counseling conversations has been
limited due to lack of large-scale data with la-
beled outcomes of the conversations. In this
paper, we present a large-scale, quantitative
study on the discourse of text-message-based
counseling conversations. We develop a set of
novel computational discourse analysis meth-
ods to measure how various linguistic aspects
of conversations are correlated with conver-
sation outcomes. Applying techniques such
as sequence-based conversation models, lan-
guage model comparisons, message cluster-
ing, and psycholinguistics-inspired word fre-
quency analyses, we discover actionable con-
versation strategies that are associated with
better conversation outcomes.

1 Introduction

Mental illness is a major global health issue. In the
U.S. alone, 43.6 million adults (18.1%) experience
mental illness in a given year (National Institute of
Mental Health, 2015). In addition to the person di-
rectly experiencing a mental illness, family, friends,
and communities are also affected (Insel, 2008).

In many cases, mental health conditions can be
treated effectively through psychotherapy and coun-
seling (World Health Organization, 2015). However,
it is far from obvious how to best conduct counsel-
ing conversations. Such conversations are free-form
without strict rules, and involve many choices that

could make a difference in someone’s life. Thus
far, quantitative evidence for effective conversation
strategies has been scarce, since most studies on
counseling have been limited to very small sample
sizes and qualitative observations (e.g., Labov and
Fanshel, (1977); Haberstroh et al., (2007)). How-
ever, recent advances in technology-mediated coun-
seling conducted online or through texting (Haber-
stroh et al., 2007) have allowed counseling ser-
vices to scale with increasing demands and to col-
lect large-scale data on counseling conversations and
their outcomes.

Here we present the largest study on counseling
conversation strategies published to date. We use
data from an SMS texting-based counseling service
where people in crisis (depression, self-harm, sui-
cidal thoughts, anxiety, etc.), engage in therapeutic
conversations with counselors. The data contains
millions of messages from eighty thousand counsel-
ing conversations conducted by hundreds of coun-
selors over the course of one year. We develop a set
of computational methods suited for large-scale dis-
course analysis to study how various linguistic as-
pects of conversations are correlated with conversa-
tion outcomes (collected via a follow-up survey).

We focus our analyses on counselors instead of
individual conversations because we are interested
in general conversation strategies rather than prop-
erties of specific issues. We find that there are sig-
nificant, quantifiable differences between more suc-
cessful and less successful counselors in how they
conduct conversations.

Our findings suggest actionable strategies that are
associated with successful counseling:

1. Adaptability (Section 5): Measuring the dis-
tance between vector representations of the lan-
guage used in conversations going well and go-
ing badly, we find that successful counselors
are more sensitive to the current trajectory of
the conversation and react accordingly.

2. Dealing with Ambiguity (Section 6): We de-
velop a clustering-based method to measure
differences in how counselors respond to very
similar ambiguous situations. We learn that
successful counselors clarify situations by writ-
ing more, reflect back to check understanding,
and make their conversation partner feel more
comfortable through affirmation.

3. Creativity (Section 6.3): We quantify the di-
versity in counselor language by measuring
cluster density in the space of counselor re-
sponses and find that successful counselors re-
spond in a more creative way, not copying the
person in distress exactly and not using too
generic or “templated” responses.

4. Making Progress (Section 7): We develop a
novel sequence-based unsupervised conversa-
tion model able to discover ordered conversa-
tion stages common to all conversations. Ana-
lyzing the progression of stages, we determine
that successful counselors are quicker to get to
know the core issue and faster to move on to
collaboratively solving the problem.

5. Change in Perspective (Section 8): We de-
velop novel measures of perspective change us-
ing psycholinguistics-inspired word frequency
analysis. We find that people in distress are
more likely to be more positive, think about
the future, and consider others, when the coun-
selors bring up these concepts. We further
show that this perspective change is associated
with better conversation outcomes consistent
with psychological theories of depression.

Further, we demonstrate that counseling success on
the level of individual conversations is predictable
using features based on our discovered conversation
strategies (Section 9). Such predictive tools could be
used to help counselors better progress through the
conversation and could result in better counseling
practices. The dataset used in this work has been re-
leased publicly and more information on dataset ac-

cess can be found at http://snap.stanford.
edu/counseling.

Although we focus on crisis counseling in this
work, our proposed methods more generally apply
to other conversational settings and can be used to
study how language in conversations relates to con-
versation outcomes.

2 Related Work

Our work relates to two lines of research:

Therapeutic Discourse Analysis & Psycholinguis-
tics. The field of conversation analysis was born in
the 1960s out of a suicide prevention center (Sacks
and Jefferson, 1995; Van Dijk, 1997). Since then
conversation analysis has been applied to various
clinical settings including psychotherapy (Labov
and Fanshel, 1977). Work in psycholinguistics has
demonstrated that the words people use can re-
veal important aspects of their social and psycho-
logical worlds (Pennebaker et al., 2003). Previous
work also found that there are linguistic cues as-
sociated with depression (Ramirez-Esparza et al.,
2008; Campbell and Pennebaker, 2003) as well as
with suicude (Pestian et al., 2012). These find-
ings are consistent with Beck’s cognitive model of
depression (1967; cognitive symptoms of depres-
sion precede the affective and mood symptoms) and
with Pyszczynski and Greenberg’s self-focus model
of depression (1987; depressed persons engage in
higher levels of self-focus than non-depressed per-
sons).

In this work, we propose an operationalized psy-
cholinguistic model of perspective change and fur-
ther provide empirical evidence for these theoretical
models of depression.

Large-scale Computational Linguistics Applied
to Conversations. Large-scale studies have re-
vealed subtle dynamics in conversations such as co-
ordination or style matching effects (Niederhoffer
and Pennebaker, 2002; Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil,
2012) as well as expressions of social power and
status (Bramsen et al., 2011; Danescu-Niculescu-
Mizil et al., 2012). Other studies have connected
writing to measures of success in the context of re-
quests (Althoff et al., 2014), user retention (Althoff
and Leskovec, 2015), novels (Ashok et al., 2013),
and scientific abstracts (Guerini et al., 2012). Prior

464

http://snap.stanford.edu/counseling
http://snap.stanford.edu/counseling


work has modeled dialogue acts in conversational
speech based on linguistic cues and discourse coher-
ence (Stolcke et al., 2000). Unsupervised machine
learning models have also been used to model con-
versations and segment them into speech acts, top-
ical clusters, or stages. Most approaches employ
Hidden Markov Model-like models (Barzilay and
Lee, 2004; Ritter et al., 2010; Paul, 2012; Yang et
al., 2014) which are also used in this work to model
progression through conversation stages.

Very recently, technology-mediated counseling
has allowed the collection of large datasets on coun-
seling. Howes et al. (2014) find that symptom sever-
ity can be predicted from transcript data with com-
parable accuracy to face-to-face data but suggest that
insights into style and dialogue structure are needed
to predict measures of patient progress. Counseling
datasets have also been used to predict the conversa-
tion outcome (Huang, 2015) but without modeling
the within-conversation dynamics that are studied in
this work. Other work has explored how novel inter-
faces based on topic models can support counselors
during conversations (Dinakar et al., 2014a; 2014b;
2015; Chen, 2014).

Our work joins these two lines of research by de-
veloping computational discourse analysis methods
applicable to large datasets that are grounded in ther-
apeutic discourse analysis and psycholinguistics.

3 Dataset Description

In this work, we study anonymized counseling con-
versations from a not-for-profit organization provid-
ing free crisis intervention via SMS messages. Text-
based counseling conversations are particularly well
suited for conversation analysis because all interac-
tions between the two dialogue partners are fully ob-
served (i.e., there are no non-textual or non-verbal
cues). Moreover, the conversations are important,
constrained to dialogue between two people, and
outcomes can be clearly defined (i.e., we follow up
with the conversation partner as to whether they feel
better afterwards), which enables the study of how
conversation features are associated with actual out-
comes.

Counseling Process. Any person in distress can
text the organization’s public number. Incoming re-
quests are put into a queue and an available coun-

selor picks the request from the queue and engages
with the incoming conversation. We refer to the cri-
sis counselor as the counselor and the person in dis-
tress as the texter. After the conversation ends, the
texter receives a follow-up question (“How are you
feeling now? Better, same, or worse?”) which we
use as our conversation quality ground-truth (we use
binary labels: good versus same/worse, since we
care about improving the situation). In contrast to
previous work that has used human judges to rate
a caller’s crisis state (Kalafat et al., 2007), we di-
rectly obtain this feedback from the texter. Further-
more, the counselor fills out a post-conversation re-
port (e.g., suicide risk, main issue such as depres-
sion, relationship, self-harm, suicide, etc.). All crisis
counselors receive extensive training and commit to
weekly shifts for a full year.

Dataset Statistics. Our dataset contains 408 coun-
selors and 3.2 million messages in 80,885 conversa-
tions between November 2013 and November 2014
(see Table 1). All system messages (e.g., instruc-
tions), as well as texts that contain survey responses
(revealing the ground-truth label for the conversa-
tion) were filtered out. Out of these conversations,
we use the 15,555, or 19.2%, that contain a ground-
truth label (whether the texter feels better or the
same/worse after the conversation) for the follow-
ing analyses. Conversations span a variety of issues
of different difficulties (see rows one and two of Ta-
ble 2). Approval to analyze the dataset was obtained
from the Stanford IRB.

4 Defining Counseling Quality

The primary goal of this paper is to study strategies
that lead to conversations with positive outcomes.
Thus, we require a ground-truth notion of conver-
sation quality. In principle, we could study individ-

ual conversations and aim to understand what fac-
tors make the conversation partner (texter) feel bet-
ter. However, it is advantageous to focus on the
conversation actor (counselor) instead of individual
conversations.

There are several benefits of focusing analy-
ses on counselors (rather than individual conversa-
tions): First, we are interested in general conversa-
tion strategies rather than properties of main issues
(e.g., depression vs. suicide). While each conver-
sation is different and will revolve around its main
issue, we assume that counselors have a particular
style and strategy that is invariant across conversa-
tions. Second, we assume that conversation qual-
ity is noisy. Even a very good counselor will face
some hard conversations in which they do every-
thing right but are still unable to make their conver-
sation partner feel better. Over time, however, the
“true” quality of the counselor will become appar-
ent. Third, our goal is to understand successful con-
versation strategies and to make use of these insights
in counselor training. Focusing on the counselor is
helpful in understanding, monitoring, and improv-
ing counselors’ conversation strategies.

More vs. Less Successful Counselors. We split
the counselors into two groups and then compare
their behavior. Out of the 113 counselors with more
than 15 labeled conversations of at least 30 messages
each, we use the most successful 40 counselors as
“more successful” counselors and the bottom 40 as
“less successful” counselors. Their average success
rates are 66.3-85.5% and 42.1-58.6%, respectively.
While the counselor-level analysis is of primary con-
cern, we will also differentiate between counselor
behavior in “positive” versus “negative” conversa-
tions (i.e., those that will eventually make the texter
feel better vs. not). Thus, in the remainder of the
paper we differentiate between more vs. less suc-
cessful counselors and positive vs. negative conver-

sations. Studying the cross product of counselors
and conversations allows us to gain insights on how
both groups behave in positive and negative conver-
sations. For example, Figure 1 illustrates why differ-
entiating between counselors and as well as conver-
sations is necessary: differences in counselor mes-
sage length over the course of the conversation are
bigger between more and less successful counselors
than between positive and negative conversations.

Initial Analysis. Before focusing on detailed anal-
yses of counseling strategies we address two impor-
tant questions: Do counselors specialize in certain
issues? And, do successful counselors appear suc-
cessful only because they handle “easier” cases?

To gain insights into the “specialization hypoth-
esis” we make use the counselor annotation of the
main issue (depression, self-harm, etc.). We com-
pare success rates of counselors across different
issues and find that successful counselors have a
higher fraction of positive conversations across all
issues and that less successful counselors typically
do not excel at a particular issue. Thus, we conclude

466



that counseling quality is a general trait or skill and
supporting that the split into more and less success-
ful counselors is meaningful.

Another simple explanation of the differences be-
tween more and less successful counselors could be
that successful counselors simply pick “easy” issues.
However, we find that this is not the case. In par-
ticular, we find that both counselor groups are very
similar in how they select conversations from the
queue (picking the top-most in 60.1% vs. 60.3%,
respectively), work similar shifts, and handle a sim-
ilar number of conversations simultaneously (1.98
vs. 1.83). Further, we find that both groups face sim-
ilar distributions of issues over time (see Table 2).
We attribute the largest difference, “NA” (main issue
not reported), to the more successful counselors be-
ing more diligent in filling out the post-conversation
report and having fewer conversations that end be-
fore the main issue is introduced.

5 Counselor Adaptability

In the remainder of the paper we focus on factors
that mediate the outcome of a conversation. First,
we examine whether successful counselors are more
aware that their current conversation is going well
or badly and study how the counselor adapts to the
situation. We investigate this question by looking
for language differences between positive and neg-
ative conversations. In particular, we compute a
distance measure between the language counselors
use in positive conversations and the language coun-
selors use in negative conversations and observe how
this distance changes over time.

We capture the time dimension by breaking up
each conversation into five even chunks of messages.
Then, for each set of counselors (more successful
or less successful), conversation outcome (positive
or negative), and chunk (first 20%, second 20%,
etc.), we build a TF-IDF vector of word occurrences
to represent the language of counselors within this
subset. We use the global inverse document (i.e.,
conversation) frequencies instead of the ones from
each subset to make the vectors directly comparable
and control for different counselors having differ-
ent numbers of conversations by weighting conver-
sations so all counselors have equal contributions.
We then measure the difference between the “posi-

tive” and “negative” vector representations by taking
the cosine distance in the induced vector space. We
also explored using Jensen-Shannon divergence be-
tween traditional probabilistic language models and
found these methods gave similar results.

Results. We find more successful counselors are
more sensitive to whether the conversation is going
well or badly and vary their language accordingly
(Figure 2). At the beginning of the conversation,
the language between positive and negative conver-
sations is quite similar, but then the distance in lan-
guage increases over time. This increase in distance
is much larger for more successful counselors than
less successful ones, suggesting they are more aware
of when conversations are going poorly and adapt
their counseling more in an attempt to remedy the
situation.

6 Reacting to Ambiguity

Observing that successful counselors are better at
adapting to the conversation, we next examine how
counselors differ and what factors determine the dif-
ferences. In particular, domain experts have sug-
gested that more successful counselors are better at
handling ambiguity in the conversation (Levitt and
Jacques, 2005). Here, we use ambiguity to refer to
the uncertainty of the situation and the texter’s ac-
tual core issue resulting from insufficiently short or
uncertain descriptions. Does initial ambiguity of the
situation negatively affect the conversation? How do
more successful counselors deal with ambiguous sit-
uations?

Figure 4: All counselors react to short, ambiguous mes-

Ambiguity. Throughout this section we measure
ambiguity in the conversation as the shortness of the
texter’s responses in number of words. While ambi-
guity could also be measured through concreteness
ratings of the words in each message (e.g., using
concreteness ratings from Brysbaert et al. (2014)),
we find that results are very similar and that length
and concreteness are strongly related and hard to
distinguish.

6.1 Initial Ambiguity and Situation Setter

It is challenging to measure ambiguity and reactions
to ambiguity at arbitrary points throughout the con-
versation since it strongly depends on the context of
the entire conversation (i.e., all earlier messages and
questions). However, we can study nearly identi-

cal beginnings of conversations where we can di-
rectly compare how more successful and less suc-
cessful counselors react given nearly identical situa-
tions (the texter first sharing their reason for texting
in). We identify the situation setter within each con-
versation as the first long message by the texter (typ-
ically a response to a “Can you tell me more about
what is going on?” question by the counselor).

Results. We find that ambiguity plays an important
role in counseling conversations. Figure 3 shows
that more ambiguous situations (shorter length of
situation setter) are less likely to result in success-
ful conversations (we obtain similar results when
measuring concreteness (Brysbaert et al., 2014) di-
rectly). Further, we find that counselors generally
react to short and ambiguous situation setters by
writing significantly more than the texters (Figure 4;
if counselors wrote exactly as much as the texter,
we would expect a horizontal line y = 1). How-
ever, more successful counselors react more strongly
to ambiguous situations than less successful coun-
selors.

6.2 How to Respond to Ambiguity
Having observed that ambiguity plays an important
role in counseling conversations, we now examine
in greater detail how counselors respond to nearly
identical situations.

We match situation setters by representing them
through TF-IDF vectors on bigrams and find similar
situation setters as nearest neighbors within a certain
cosine distance in the induced space.1 We only con-
sider situation setters that are part of a dense cluster
with at least 10 neighbors, allowing us to compare
follow-up responses by the counselors (4829/12770
situation setters were part of one of 589 such clus-
ters). We also used distributed word embeddings
(e.g., (Mikolov et al., 2013)) instead of TF-IDF vec-
tors but found the latter to produce better clusters.

Based on counselor training materials we hypoth-
esize that more successful counselors

• address ambiguity by writing more themselves,
• use more check questions (statements that tell

the conversation partner that you understand

matches from randomly chosen clusters. Results were not

them while avoiding the introduction of any
opinion or advice (Labov and Fanshel, 1977);
e.g.“that sounds like...”),

• check for suicidal thoughts early (e.g., “want to
die”),

• thank the texter for showing the courage to talk
to them (e.g., “appreciate”),

• use more hedges (mitigating words used
to lessen the impact of an utterance; e.g.,
“maybe”, “fairly”),

• and that they are less likely to respond with sur-
prise (e.g., “oh, this sounds really awful”).

A set of regular expressions is used to detect each
class of responses (similar to the examples above).

Results. We find several statistically significant dif-
ferences in how counselors respond to nearly iden-
tical situation setters (see Table 3). While situation
setters tend to be slightly longer for more success-
ful counselors (suggesting that conversations are not
perfectly randomly assigned), counselor responses
are significantly longer and also spur longer texter
responses. Further, the more successful counselors
respond in a way that is less similar to the original
situation setter (measured by cosine similarity in TF-
IDF space) compared to less successful counselors
(but the texter’s response does not seem affected).
We do find that more successful counselors use more
check questions, check for suicide ideation more of-
ten, show the texter more appreciation, and use more
hedges, but we did not find a significant difference
with respect to responding with surprise.

Figure 5: More successful counselors use less com-
mon/templated responses (after the texter first explains
the situation). This suggests that they respond in a more
creative way. There is no significant difference between
positive and negative conversations.

6.3 Response Templates and Creativity

In Section 6.2, we observed that more successful
counselors make use of certain templates (including
check questions, checks for suicidal thoughts, affir-
mation, and using hedges). While this could suggest
that counselors should stick to such predefined tem-
plates, we find that, in fact, more successful coun-
selors do respond in more creative ways.

We define a measure of how “templated” the
counselors responses are by counting the number of
similar responses in TF-IDF space for the counselor
reaction (c.f., Section 6.2; again using a manually
defined and validated threshold on cosine distance).

Figure 5 shows that more successful counselors
use less common/templated questions. This sug-
gests that while more successful counselors ques-
tions follow certain patterns, they are more creative
in their response to each situation. This tailoring of
responses requires more effort from the counselor,
which is consistent with the results in Figure 1 that
showed that more successful counselors put in more
effort in composing longer messages as well.

7 Ensuring Conversation Progress

After demonstrating content-level differences be-
tween counselors, we now explore temporal differ-
ences in how counselors progress through conversa-
tions. Using an unsupervised conversation model,
we are able to discover distinct conversation stages
and find differences between counselors in how they

469



move through these stages. We further provide ev-
idence that these differences could be related to
power and authority by measuring linguistic coor-
dination between the counselor and texter.

7.1 Unsupervised Conversation Model

Counseling conversations follow a common struc-
ture due to the nature of conversation as well as
counselor training. Typically, counselors first intro-
duce themselves, get to know the texter and their
situation, and then engage in constructive prob-
lem solving. We employ unsupervised conversation
modeling techniques to capture this stage-like struc-
ture within conversations.

Our conversation model is a message-level Hid-
den Markov Model (HMM). Figure 6 illustrates the
basic model where hidden states of the HMM rep-
resent conversation stages. Unlike in prior work on
conversation modeling, we impose a fixed ordering
on the stages and only allow transitions from the cur-
rent stage to the next one (Figure 7). This causes
it to learn a fixed dialogue structure common to all
of the counseling sessions as opposed to conversa-
tion topics. Furthermore, we separately model coun-
selor and texter messages by treating their turns in
the conversation as distinct states. We train the con-
versation model with expectation maximization, us-
ing the forward-backward algorithm to produce the
distributions during each expectation step. We ini-
tialized the model with each stage producing mes-
sages according to a unigram distribution estimated
from all messages in the dataset and uniform transi-
tion probabilities. The unigram language models are
defined over all words occurring more than 20 times
(over 98% of words in the dataset), with other words
replaced by an unknown token.

Results. We explored training the model with vari-
ous numbers of stages and found five stages to pro-
duce a distinct and easily interpretable representa-
tion of a conversation’s progress. Table 4 shows the
words most unique to each stage. The first and last
stages consist of the basic introductions and wrap-
ups common to all conversations. In stage 2, the
texter introduces the main issue, while the counselor
asks for clarifications and expresses empathy for the
situation. In stage 3, the counselor and texter dis-
cuss the problem, particularly in relation to the other

ter discuss actionable strategies that could help the

training called “collaborative problem solving.”

7.2 Analyzing Counselor Progression
Do counselors differ in how much time they spend
at each stage? In order to explore how counselors
progress through the stages, we use the Viterbi al-
gorithm to assign each conversation the most likely
sequence of stages according to our conversation
model. We then compute the average duration in
messages of each stage for both more and less suc-
cessful counselors. We control for the different
distributions of positive and negative conversations
among more successful and less successful coun-
selors by giving the two classes of conversations
equal weight and control for different conversation
lengths by only including conversations between 40
and 60 messages long.

Results. We find that more successful counselors
are quicker to move past the earlier stages, partic-

ularly stage 2, and spend more time in later stages,
particularly stage 4 (Figure 8). This suggests they
are able to more quickly get to know the texter and
then spend more time in the problem solving phase
of the conversation, which could be one of the rea-
sons they are more successful.

7.3 Coordination and Power Differences

One possible explanation for the more successful
counselors’ ability to quickly move through the
early stages is that they have more “power” in the
conversation and can thus exert more control over
the progression of the conversation. We explore
this idea by analyzing linguistic coordination, which
measures how much the conversation partners adapt
to each other’s conversational styles. Research has
shown that conversation participants who have a
greater position of power coordinate less (i.e., they
do not adapt their linguistic style to mimic the other
conversational participant as strongly) (Danescu-
Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2012).

In our analysis, we use the “Aggregated 2” coordi-
nation measure C(B,A) from Danescu-Niculescu-
Mizil (2012), which measures how much group B
coordinates to group A (a higher number means
more coordination). The measure is computed by

counting how often specific markers (e.g., auxiliary
verbs) are exhibited in conversations. If someone
tends to use a particular marker right after their con-
versation partner uses that marker, it suggests they
are coordinating to their partner.

Formally, let set S be a set of exchanges, each
involving an initial utterance u1 by a ∈ A and a
reply u2 by b ∈ B. Then the coordination of b to A
according to a linguistic marker m is:

Cm(b, A) = P (Emu2→u1 |Emu1)− P (Emu2→u1)
where Emu1 is the event that utterance u1 exhibits m
(i.e., contains a word from category m) and Emu2→u1
is the event that reply u2 to u1 exhibits m. The prob-
abilities are estimated across all exchanges in S. To
aggregate across different markers, we average the
coordination values of Cm(b, A) over all markers m
to get a macro-average C(b, A). The coordination
between groups B and A is then defined as the mean
of the coordinations of all members of group B to-
wards the group A.

We use eight markers from Danescu-Niculescu-
Mizil (2012), which are considered to be processed
by humans in a generally non-conscious fashion: ar-
ticles, auxiliary verbs, conjunctions, high-frequency
adverbs, indefinite pronouns, personal pronouns,
prepositions, and quantifiers.

Results. Texters coordinate less than coun-
selors, with texters having a coordination value
of C(texter, counselor)=0.019 compared to the
counselor’s C(counselor, texter)=0.030, suggest-
ing that the texters hold more “power” in
the conversation. However, more successful
counselors coordinate less than less successful
ones (C(more succ. counselors, texter)=0.029 vs.
C(less succ. counselors, texter)=0.032). All differ-
ences are statistically significant (p < 0.01; Mann-
Whitney U test). This suggests that more successful
counselors act with more control over the conversa-

471



tion, which could explain why they are quicker to
make it through the initial conversation stages.

8 Facilitating Perspective Change

Thus far, we have studied conversation dynamics
and their relation to conversation success from the
counselor perspective. In this section, we show that
perspective change in the texter over time is asso-
ciated with a higher likelihood of conversation suc-
cess. Prior work has shown that day-to-day changes
in writing style are associated with positive health
outcomes (Campbell and Pennebaker, 2003), and
existing theories link depression to a negative view
of the future (Pyszczynski et al., 1987) and a self-
focusing style (Pyszczynski and Greenberg, 1987).
Here, we propose a novel measure to quantify three
orthogonal aspects of perspective change within a
single conversation: time, self, and sentiment. Fur-
ther, we show that the counselor might be able to
actively induce perspective change.

Time. Texters start explaining their issue largely
in terms of the past and present but over time talk
more about the future (see Figure 9A; each plot
shows the relative amount of words in the LIWC
past, present, and future categories (Tausczik and
Pennebaker, 2010)). We find that texters writing
more about the future are more likely to feel better
after the conversation. This suggests that changing
the perspective from issues in the past towards the
future is associated with a higher likelihood of suc-
cessfully working through the crisis.

Self. Another important aspect of behavior change
is to what degree the texter is able to change their
perspective from talking about themselves to con-
sidering others and potentially the effect of their sit-
uation on others (Pyszczynski and Greenberg, 1987;
Campbell and Pennebaker, 2003). We measure how
much the texter is focused on themselves by the rela-
tive amount of first person singular pronouns (I, me,
mine) versus third person singular/plural pronouns
(she, her, him / they, their), again using LIWC. Fig-
ure 9B shows that a smaller amount of self-focus is
associated with more successful conversations (pro-
viding support for the self-focus model of depres-
sion (Pyszczynski and Greenberg, 1987)). We hy-
pothesize that the lack of difference at the end of
the conversation is due to conversation norms such

as thanking the counselor (“I really appreciate it.”)
even if the texter does not actually feel better.

Sentiment. Lastly, we investigate how much a
change in sentiment of the texter throughout the con-
versation is associated with conversation success.
We measure sentiment as the relative fraction of pos-
itive words using the LIWC PosEmo and NegEmo
sentiment lexicons. The results in Figure 9C show
that texters always start out more negative (value be-
low 0.5), but that the sentiment becomes more posi-
tive over time for both positive and negative conver-
sations. However, we find that the separation be-
tween both groups grows larger over time, which
suggests that a positive perspective change through-
out the conversation is related to higher likelihood
of conversation success. We find that both curves
increase significantly at the very end of the con-
versation. Again, we attribute this to conversation
norms such as thanking the counselor for listening
even when the texter does not actually feel better.
Together with the result on talking about the fu-
ture, these findings are consistent with the theory of
Pyszczynski et al. (1987) that depression is related
to a negative view of the future.

Role of a Counselor. Given that positive conver-
sations often exhibit perspective change, a natural
question is how counselors can encourage perspec-
tive change in the texter. We investigate this by ex-
ploring the hypothesis that the texter will tend to talk
more about something (e.g., the future), if the coun-
selor first talks about it. We measure this tendency
using the same coordination measures as Section 7.3
except that instead of using stylistic LIWC markers
(e.g., auxiliary verbs, quantifiers), we use the LIWC
markers relevant to the particular aspect of perspec-
tive change (e.g., Future, HeShe, PosEmo). In all
cases we find a statistically significant (p < 0.01;
Mann-Whitney U-test) increase in the likelihood of
the texter using a LIWC marker if the counselor used
it in the previous message (~4-5% change). This link
between perspective change and how the counselor
conducts the conversation suggests that the coun-
selor might be able to actively induce measurable
perspective change in the texter.

9 Predicting Counseling Success

In this section, we combine our quantitative insights
into a prediction task. We show that the linguistic as-
pects of crisis counseling explored in previous sec-
tions have predictive power at the level of individ-
ual conversations by evaluating their effectiveness as
features in classifying the outcome of conversations.
Specifically, we create a balanced dataset of positive
and negative conversations more than 30 messages
long and train a logistic regression model to predict
the outcome given the first x% of messages in the
conversation. There are 3619 such negative conver-
sations and and we randomly subsample the larger
set of positive conversations. We train the model
with batch gradient descent and use L1 regulariza-
tion when n-gram features are present and L2 reg-
ularization otherwise. We evaluate our model with
10-fold cross-validation and compare models using
the area under the ROC curve (AUC).

Features. We include three aspects of counselor
messages discussed in Section 6: hedges, check
questions, and the similarity between the counselor’s
message and previous texter message. We add a
measure of how much progress the counselor has
made (Section 7) by computing the Viterbi path of
stages for the conversation (only for the first x%)
with the HMM conversation model and then adding
the duration of each stage (in #messages) as a fea-
ture. Additionally, we add average message length

and average sentiment per message using VADER
sentiment (Hutto and Gilbert, 2014). Further, we
add temporal dynamics to the model by adding fea-
ture conjunctions with the stages HMM model. Af-
ter running the stages model over the x% of the con-
versation available to the classifier, we add each fea-
ture’s average value over each stage as additional
features. Lastly, we explore the benefits of adding
surface-level text features to the model by adding
unigram and bigram features. Because the focus
of this work is on counseling strategies, we primar-
ily experiment with models using only features from
counselor messages. For completeness, we also re-
port results for a model including texter features.

Prediction Results. The model’s accuracy increases
with x, and we show that the model is able to dis-

tinguish positive and negative conversations after
only seeing the first 20% of the conversation (see
Figure 10). We attribute the significant increase
in performance for x = 100 (Accuracy=0.687,
AUC=0.716) to strong linguistic cues that appear as
a conversation wraps up (e.g., “I’m glad you feel
better.”). To avoid this issue, our detailed feature
analysis is performed at x = 80.

Feature Analysis. The model performance as fea-
tures are incrementally added to the model is shown
in Table 5. All features improve model accuracy sig-
nificantly (p < 0.001; paired bootstrap resampling
test). Adding n-gram features produces the largest
boost in AUC and significantly improves over a
model just using n-gram features (0.638 vs. 0.652
AUC). Note that most features in the full model are
based on word frequency counts that can be derived
from n-grams which explains why a simple n-gram
model already performs quite well. However, our
model performs well with only a small set of lin-
guistic features, demonstrating they provide a sub-
stantial amount of the predictive power. The effec-
tiveness of these features shows that, in addition to
exhibiting group-level differences reported earlier in
this paper, they provide useful signal for predicting
the outcome of individual conversations.

10 Conclusion & Future Work

Knowledge about how to conduct a successful coun-
seling conversation has been limited by the fact that
studies have remained largely qualitative and small-
scale. In this work, we presented a large-scale quan-

titative study on the discourse of counseling con-
versations. We developed a set of novel computa-
tional discourse analysis methods suited for large-
scale datasets and used them to discover actionable
conversation strategies that are associated with bet-
ter conversation outcomes. We hope that this work
will inspire future generations of tools available to
people in crisis as well as their counselors. For ex-
ample, our insights could help improve counselor
training and give rise to real-time counseling qual-
ity monitoring and answer suggestion support tools.
