Abstract

Learning functional expressions is one of the difficulties for language learners, since functional
expressions tend to have multiple meanings and complicated usages in various situations. In
this paper, we report an experiment of simplifying example sentences of Japanese functional
expressions especially for Chinese-speaking learners. For this purpose, we developed
“Japanese Functional Expressions List” and “Simple Japanese Replacement List”. To evaluate
the method, we conduct a small-scale experiment with Chinese-speaking learners on the
effectiveness of the simplified example sentences. The experimental results indicate that the
simplified sentences are helpful in learning Japanese functional expressions.

1 Introduction

In Japanese grammar, there is a large number of functional expressions consisting of one or more
words and behave like a single functional word, such as “たい (want to)、に対して(to)、なければ
ならない (must)”. Matsuyoshi et al. (2006) developed a Japanese functional expression lexicon
consisting of 292 headwords and 13,958 different surface forms. It is crucial to develop a Japanese
learning assistant system which supports Japanese language learners to learn such a large number of
complicated functional expressions.
Recently, with the help of natural language processing technology, many Japanese learning assistant

systems have been constructed. For example, Pereira and Matsumoto (2015) presents a Collocation
Assistant for Japanese language learners, which flags possible collocation errors and suggests
corrections with example sentences. Han and Song (2011), and Ohno et al. (2013) attempt to develop
Japanese learning systems for learning and using Japanese sentence patterns with the use of illustrative
examples extracted from the Web.
As mentioned above, some studies have paid attention to assist learners to learn Japanese functional

expressions. However, none of the existing studies has aimed at simplifying difficult example
sentences for the need of Chinese-speaking learners of Japanese language. In this paper, we describe
our proposed method in Section 2. Section 3 explains the result and evaluation of a small-scale
experiment for examining the effectiveness of the proposed method. Finally, we conclude in Section 4.

2 Proposed Method

In this section, we propose a method to simplify difficult Japanese sentences that contain Japanese
functional expressions for Chinese-speaking learners of Japanese language.

2.1 Making Japanese Functional Expressions List

In order to identify Japanese functional expressions, Tsuchiya et al. (2006) developed an example

database with 337 types of Japanese compound functional expressions. Shime et al. (2007) proposed
an approach to detecting 59 types of Japanese functional expressions through a machine learning
technique based on a chunking program. However, the major drawback of these studies is in the scale
of Japanese functional expressions, which does not reach the need of the five levels (from N1 to N5)
of the new Japanese-Language Proficiency Test (JLPT).
According to the requirements of the new JLPT, we manually constructed a list of Japanese

functional expressions, which consists of about 680 headwords and 4,000 types of different surface
forms. Here, we consider levels 3-5 as easy level, and levels 1-2 as difficult level, respectively. Table
1 shows some examples of Japanese functional expressions and their surface form variations.

Headword Difficulty Level Surface Forms
たあとで(after) N5 たあとで、た後で、だあとで、だ後で

かもしれない(maybe) N4 かもしれない、かもしれません、かもしれず...
にたいして(to) N3 にたいして、に対して、にたいしては、に対しては...

ざるをえない(have to) N2 ざるをえない、ざるを得ない、ざるをえず、ざるを得ず...
やいなや(as soon as) N1 やいなや、や否や

Table 1: Examples of Japanese functional expressions and surface form variations

2.2 Creating Simple Japanese Replacement List

Text simplification, defined narrowly, is the process of reducing the linguistic complexity of a text,
while retaining the original information contents and meaning (Siddharthan, 2014). Watananabe and
Kawamura (2013) introduced a Japanese simplification system with the use of a “Simple Japanese
Replacement List”. Kaneniwa and Kawamura (2013) used the same list to rewrite difficult vocabulary
automatically for Japanese learners who have non-kanji backgrounds. Kajiwara and Yamamoto (2015),
constructed an evaluation dataset for Japanese lexical simplification. They extracted 2330 sentences
from a newswire corpus and simplified only one difficult word using several Japanese lexical
paraphrasing databases. Kodaira et al. (2016) built a controlled and balanced dataset for Japanese
lexical simplification. They extracted 2010 sentences with only one difficult word in each sentence
from a balanced corpus and collected simplification candidates using crowdsourcing techniques.
Different from the previous research mentioned above, we used a large scale Japanese balanced

corpus to extract simplification candidates for difficult words and through manual selection we
constructed a “Simple Japanese Replacement List” for Chinese-speaking Japanese language learners.
For the levels of word difficulty, we consider levels 3-5 of the new JLPT as easy level, and levels 1-2
as difficult level according to the vocabulary list of the new JLPT, which consists of about 16,000
words. Besides, we consider the words which are not included in the vocabulary list of the new JLPT
as difficult words. Since a large number of Kanji characters are used both in Japanese and in Chinese,
Chinese-speaking learners can easily understand the Japanese words of Chinese origin (Japanese-
Chinese homographs), such as “安全(safety)”, “学習(study)”, “擁立(support)”, or easily guess the
meaning of many Japanese original words with the help of Kanji characters, such as “壊す(break)”,
“打つ (hit)”, “取り消す (cancel)”. Kanji characters in these Japanese words are also included in
Chinese dictionary and have the same or similar meaning with Chinese words. Therefore, we consider
these words as easy words for Chinese-speaking learners, although some of these words are difficult
words in the vocabulary list of the new JLPT.
We obtain a list of similar words associated with each difficult word which we are going to use for

replacement, using Word2vec (https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/). As the training data for the
Word2vec model, we use the Balanced Corpus of Contemporary Written Japanese (Maekawa, 2008),
which consists of about 5,800,000 sentences in various domains. Based on the list of similar words, we
choose easy words which are included in the vocabulary list of new JLPT as simplified words. If there
is no appropriate easy word in the vocabulary list of the new JLPT, we use Japanese-Chinese
homographs whose meaning is the same, or similar to Chinese words based on Japanese dictionaries
(Bunrui goihyo zouhokaiteiban, 2004; Kadokawa ruigo shin jiten, 2002; Kojien 5th Editon, 1998).
Japanese-Chinese homographs for simplification are specific for Chinese-natives. Therefore, our
“Simple Japanese Replacement List” differs from previous research mentioned above on this aspect.

For simplification of Japanese functional expressions, we rewrite some difficult Japanese functional
expressions using easy Japanese functional expressions or easy words in the vocabulary list of the new
JLPT based on a Japanese sentence pattern dictionary (Group Jamasi, Xu. 2001).

Original words Difficulty Level Part of speech Simplified words Difficulty Level
合鍵 (duplicate key) N1 Noun 鍵 (key) N5
負け戦 (defeat) N0 Noun 敗戦 (defeat) N0
出会う(meet) N0 Verb 会う (meet) N5

胸苦しい (tough) N1 Adjective 苦しい (tough) N3
が早いか (when) N1 Functional Expression と (when) N5
の際には (when) N2 Functional Expression の時 (when) N5/N5

Table 2: Examples of the Simple Japanese Replacement List

Finally, we created a “Simple Japanese Replacement List,” which consists of words and functional
expressions. Table 2 shows some examples in the list.

3 Experiment and Evaluation

Our aim is to obtain appropriate example sentences that ease understanding of Japanese functional
expressions. We conducted a small-scale experiment for evaluating the method for generating
simplified example sentences. For the source data, the Balanced Corpus of Contemporary Written
Japanese was used. We removed too short or too long sentences by limiting the sentence length
between 3 to 25 words and then used the remaining 4,232,120 sentences for the experimental data.
To identify occurrences of Japanese functional expressions in the extracted sentences, we used a

publicly available morphological analyzer MeCab (taku910.github.io/mecab/). We add the two lists
we created, “Japanese Functional Expressions List” and “Simple Japanese Replacement List”, into the
IPA (mecab-ipadic-2.7.0-20070801) dictionary used as the standard dictionary for MeCab, with
appropriate part-of-speech information for each expression, hoping that the morphological analyzer
MeCab extracts the usages of functional expressions automatically. The accuracy is evaluated in the
next section. Table 3 shows some example sentences of Japanese functional expressions and their
corresponding simplified sentences.

functional expressions and the words in bold are simplified words.

3.1 Evaluation of Japanese functional expressions

In this section, we randomly extract 200 sentences from the experimental data to examine whether the
identified Japanese functional expressions are correct or not. Table 4 gives the evaluation results of
identification of Japanese functional expressions.

Correct rate Correctly extracted sentences 171 (85.5%)

Error rate Incorrectly extracted sentences 10 (5%) 29 (14.5%)Japanese functional expressions are not recognized 19 (9.5%)
Total 200 (100%)

Table 4: Evaluation results of Japanese functional expression identification

According to Table 4, we obtained 85.5% accuracy for identifying Japanese functional expressions.
Cases of failures of functional expression identification can be viewed from the following three causes.
First, the lack of discriminative contextual information causes failure. For example, “をめぐる(with
related to)” in “決算 を めぐる 政策評価 の 問題”, is incorrectly recognized as a literal usage. Here,
both literal usage and functional usage of this expression share almost the same contexts and cannot be
distinguished only by the surrounding information used in MeCab. Second is the opposite case where
a literal usage is recognized as a functional expression. For example, in “青少年 期 から 身 につけ
て しまう”, “につけて(concerning)” was incorrectly extracted. Third, functional expressions are not
included in the current “Japanese Functional Expressions List”. For example, a colloquial expression
“わけじゃない(it does not mean that)” was not recognized as a functional expression.

3.2 Evaluation of Simplified Sentences

In this section, we evaluate the simplified sentences from the following two aspects, fluency and
readability. From the 200 example sentences that include functional expressions, we removed 36
sentences which are easy sentences since they include no difficult words. We do not need to simplify
such sentences. We then used the remaining 164 sentences for evaluation.
For the evaluation of fluency, we invited three Japanese natives to check the simplified sentences

whether they are natural Japanese sentences. Meanwhile, for readability of the simplified sentences,
we invited three Chinese-speaking learners who are all beginners of Japanese language. To compare
the readability, we provided them with the Chinese translation of the original sentences and simplified
sentences using an online translation software “Google translation” (translate.google.cn). We asked
them to read and judge which sentence is easier to understand. Tables 5 and 6 show the evaluation
results of fluency and readability respectively.

Natural sentences 142 (86.6%)
Unnatural sentences 22 (13.4%)
Total 164 (100%)

Table 5: Evaluation results of fluency of the simplified sentences

Easy to understand 132 (80.5%)
Difficult to understand 32 (19.5%)
Total 164 (100%)

Table 6: Evaluation results of readability of the simplified sentences

According to the evaluation results in Table 6, 80.5% sentences are simplified appropriately and
become easier to understand. Two cases are identified in simplification failure. One is lack of
appropriate simplified rules. For example, “請求しうる ” contains a functional expression “うる
(possible)” with the difficulty level 2. However, no corresponding simplified word for the functional
expression “うる” is found in the current “Simple Japanese Replacement List”. This case cannot be
coped with by lexical simplification. The other is the usage of inappropriate words, which is the main
reason for generation of unnatural simplified sentences. For example, “市内の青果物商を片っ端か
ら尋ねて回った。” was rewritten as “市内の野菜と果物商を一つ一つから尋ねて回った。”,
which is an unnatural sentence that produces unnatural connections for words.

4 Conclusion

In this paper, we presented our attempt to produce simplified example sentences for learning Japanese
functional expressions using “Japanese Functional Expressions List” and “Simple Japanese
Replacement List”. A small-scale experiment was conducted to verify the effectiveness of the
proposed method. The experimental results showed that simplified example sentences are helpful in
learning Japanese functional expressions. In the future, we plan to estimate the difficulty level of the
extracted example sentences automatically and offer better example sentences for Chinese-speaking
learners of Japanese language.
