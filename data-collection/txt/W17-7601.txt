Abstract

Building systems able to provide a semantic representation of texts has long been an objective, both in
linguistics and in applied NLP. Although advances in machine learning sometimes seem to diminish the
need to use as input sophisticated structured representations of sentences, the enthusiasm for interpreting
trained neural networks somewhat seems to reaffirm that need.
Because they represent schematic situations, semantic frames (Fillmore, 1982), as intantiated into

FrameNet (Baker, Fillmore and Petruck, 1983) are an appealing level of generalization over the eventu-
alities described in texts.
In this talk, I will present some feedback from the development of a French FrameNet, including anal-

ysis of the main difficulties we faced during annotation. I will describe how linking generalizations can
be extracted from the frame-annotated data, using deep syntactic annotations. I will then investigate what
kind of input is most effective for FrameNet parsing, from no syntax at all to deep syntactic representa-
tions.

The work I’ll present is a joint work with:
• Marianne Djemaa, Philippe Muller, Laure Vieu, G. de Chalendar,
B. Sagot, P. Amsili (French FrameNet),

• C. Ribeyre, D. Seddah, G. Perrier, B. Guillaume (deep syntax),
• Olivier Michalon, Alexis Nasr (semantic parsing).
