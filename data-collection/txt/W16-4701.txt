Abstract

Cancer (a.k.a neoplasms in a broader sense) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide
and its incidence is expected to exacerbate. To respond to the critical need from the society,
there have been rigorous attempts for the cancer research community to develop treatment for
cancer. Accordingly, we observe a surge in the sheer volume of research products and outcomes
in relation to neoplasms.

In this talk, we introduce the notion of entitymetrics to provide a new lens for understanding the
impact, trend, and diffusion of knowledge associated with neoplasms research. To this end, we
collected over two million records from PubMed, the most popular search engine in the medi-
cal domain. Coupled with text mining techniques including named entity recognition, sentence
boundary detection, string approximate matching, entitymetrics enables us to analyze knowledge
diffusion, impact, and trend at various knowledge entity units, such as bio-entity, organization,
and country.

At the end of the talk, the future applications and possible directions of entitymetrics will be
discussed.
