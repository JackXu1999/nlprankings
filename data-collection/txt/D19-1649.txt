Abstract

We present FewRel 2.0, a more challenging
task to investigate two aspects of few-shot
relation classification models: (1) Can they
adapt to a new domain with only a hand-
ful of instances? (2) Can they detect none-
of-the-above (NOTA) relations? To construct
FewRel 2.0, we build upon the FewRel dataset
(Han et al., 2018) by adding a new test set
in a quite different domain, and a NOTA re-
lation choice. With the new dataset and ex-
tensive experimental analysis, we found (1)
that the state-of-the-art few-shot relation clas-
sification models struggle on these two as-
pects, and (2) that the commonly-used tech-
niques for domain adaptation and NOTA de-
tection still cannot handle the two challenges
well. Our research calls for more attention
and further efforts to these two real-world
issues. All details and resources about the
dataset and baselines are released at https:

1 Introduction

Few-shot learning, which requires models to han-
dle new classification tasks with only a handful
of training instances, has drawn much attention in
recent years (Ravi and Larochelle, 2017; Vinyals
et al., 2016; Munkhdalai and Yu, 2017; Snell et al.,
2017). To advance this field in NLP, Han et al.
(2018) propose FewRel, a large-scale dataset to
explore few-shot learning in relation classification.
Many efforts (Gao et al., 2019; Soares et al., 2019)
have been devoted to the new task and some of
the methods even exceed human performance1 on
FewRel. Based on the dataset FewRel, we pro-
pose FewRel 2.0, a new task containing two real-
world issues that FewRel ignores: (1) few-shot
domain adaptation, and (2) few-shot none-of-the-
above detection.

Figure 1: The comparison between the best results of
the current models on FewRel, few-shot DA and few-
shot NOTA. From the figures we can see that even the
state-of-the-art models struggle on the new tasks.

Few-shot domain adaptation (few-shot DA)
aims to evaluate the abilities of few-shot models to
transfer across domains, which is crucial for real-
world applications, since the test domains usually
lack of annotations and could differ vastly from
the training domains. To this end, we construct a
new test set sharing great disparities with the orig-
inal FewRel dataset, and carry out extensive ex-
periments on the state-of-the-art few-shot models
and commonly-used domain adaptation methods.
Some prior experimental results in Figure 1 show
that even the performance of the most effective
methods on FewRel drops drastically on the new
test set, proving that few-shot DA is challenging
and requires further investigations.

Few-shot none-of-the-above detection (few-
shot NOTA) is an advanced version of the ex-
isting N -way K-shot setting in few-shot learn-
ing. The original N -way K-shot setting sam-
ples N classes, as well as K supporting instances
and several queries from each class for each test
batch, assuming that all queries belong to the sam-
pled N classes. However, in few-shot NOTA,
queries could also be none-of-the-above (NOTA),
which brings one more option in classification and
challenges existing few-shot methods. Consider-

Table 1: An example for a 2-way 1-shot scenario, in-
cluding both few-shot DA and few-shot NOTA. Dif-
ferent colors indicate different entities, blue for head
entities, and red for tail entities. For few-shot DA, in-
stances in the training phase and test phase come from
different domains. For few-shot NOTA, it requires
models to detect the none-of-the-above (NOTA) rela-
tion.

ing few-shot NOTA has not yet been widely ex-
plored, we propose several solutions based on the
state-of-the-art few-shot models and evaluate them
with few-shot NOTA setting. Figure 1 shows that
though achieving promising results, there is still a
room of improvements for few-shot NOTA.

In the following sections, we first describe the
two newly-added challenges in FewRel 2.0, then
introduce possible directions for addressing these
two issues, and finally present results and observa-
tions from our experiments.

2 FewRel 2.0

Formulation for N -Way K-Shot Setting
The original FewRel task adopts the N -way K-
shot setting. The whole dataset is divided into
training, validation and test subsets, which have
no intersection in relation types. Models are eval-
uated with batches sampled from the test set, each
of which consists of (R,S, x, r), where R =
{r1, r2, ..., rN} is the sampled relation set, r ∈ R
is the correct relation label for the query x, and
S is the supporting set containing K instances for
each relation,

S = {(xjri , ri)}, 1 ≤ i ≤ N, 1 ≤ j ≤ K. (1)

Models should predict the relation label y ∈ R for
the query instance x based on the given S and R.
Both of the following two challenges are based on
this N -way K-shot setting.

Few-Shot Domain Adaptation
Both the training and test sets of the original
FewRel dataset are constructed by manually an-
notating the distantly supervised (Bunescu and
Mooney, 2007; Mintz et al., 2009) results on
Wikipedia corpus and Wikidata (Vrandečić and
Krötzsch, 2014) knowledge bases. In other words,
they are from the same domain, yet in a real-world
scenario, we might train models on one domain
and perform few-shot learning on a different one.
For example, we may train models on Wikipedia,
which has large amounts of data and adequate an-
notations, and then perform few-shot learning on
some domains suffering data sparsity, like litera-
ture, finance and medicine. Note that, not only
do these corpora differ vastly from each other in
morphology and syntax, but there are wide dis-
parities between the relation sets defined on these
domains as well, which makes transferring knowl-
edge across different domains more challenging.

To explore few-shot DA, we construct a new
test set by aligning PubMed 2, a database contain-
ing large amounts of biomedical literature, with
UMLS 3, a large-scale knowledge base in the
biomedical sciences. Then we let the annotators
classify whether each instance we get from the
distant supervision is correct. Every sentence is
assigned to at least two annotators, and if their an-
notation results do not agree with each other, the
third annotator is assigned. In the end, we gather
a valid dataset with 25 relations and 100 instances
for each relation.

For few-shot DA, we adopt the original FewRel
training set for training, and the newly-annotated
dataset for test, as shown in Table 1. Besides, we
use SemEval-2010 task 8 dataset (Hendrickx et al.,
2009) as the validation set, since both the corpora
and the schema of SemEval-2010 task 8 are in dif-
ferent domains from the original FewRel dataset
and the newly-annotated test set.

Few-Shot None-of-the-Above Detection
In a N -way K-shot, all queries are assumed to be
in the given relation set, yet sentences expressing
no specific relations or relations not in the given
set should also be taken into consideration, for
they make up the vast majority of text. This calls
for the none-of-the-above (NOTA) relation, which

Systemr, which is the trademark of U.S. National Library
of Medicine.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/


6252

indicates that the query instance does not express
any of the given relations. Though it is common
in some conventional classification tasks, where
NOTA is usually regarded as an extra class, de-
tecting NOTA could be hard in few-shot learning,
because the given relation sets are not fixed so that
the NOTA relation requires to cover a different se-
mantic space each time. An example of NOTA is
given in Table 1.

We formalize few-shot NOTA based on the
N -way K-shot setting. For the query in-
stance x, the correct relation label becomes
r ∈ {r1, r2, ..., rN ,NOTA} rather than r ∈
{r1, r2, ..., rN}. We use the parameter NOTA rate
to describe the proportion of NOTA queries during
the whole test phase. For example, 0% NOTA rate
means no queries are NOTA and 50% NOTA rate
means half of the queries have the label NOTA.

The NOTA queries are sampled from those re-
lations outside the given N relations. To be more
specific, denoting the whole test set as Dtest, the
set containing all instances in the relation setR as
DR and the NOTA rate as α, α of the query in-
stances (NOTA queries) are from Dtest \DR and
1− α of the instances are from DR.

Note that during the test phase, all the queries
are from the test set, though models can sam-
ple instances from the training set as supporting
instances for NOTA relation (this method is de-
scribed explicitly in Section 4). Also note that to
better demonstrate the effects of the NOTA rela-
tion, we use the original FewRel dataset for few-
shot NOTA, instead of the new test set, which can
get rid of the influence of domain adaptation.

3 Approaches for Few-Shot DA

Many efforts have been devoted for domain adap-
tation, like subspace mapping (Pan et al., 2010;
Fernando et al., 2013), finding domain-invariant
spaces (Baktashmotlagh et al., 2013; Ganin et al.,
2016), feature augmentation (Blitzer et al., 2006)
and minimax estimators (Provost and Fawcett,
2001). Among them, adversarial training (Good-
fellow et al., 2015; Ganin et al., 2016; Wang et al.,
2018) has been proved to be efficient in finding
domain-invariant features. It is a game process
between an encoder and a discriminator, where the
encoder tries to generate domain-invariant features
while the discriminator tries to tell which domain
the features are from.

Here we follow the adversarial training setting

in Wang et al. (2018), where a two-layer percep-
tron network is used as the discriminator. While
training the few-shot learning task, we feed the
sentence encoder E and the discriminator D with
the corpora from the training domain and the test
domain, and optimize the min-max game,

where [·]i is the i-th element of the vector, C0 is
the training corpus and C1 is the test corpus.

4 Approaches for Few-Shot NOTA

A simple way to handle NOTA is to regard it as
an extra class in the N -way K-shot setting. To
be more specific, we can sample instances outside
the N relations as the supporting data of NOTA,
and perform the (N+1)-wayK-shot learning. As
compared to the current methods ignoring NOTA,
this approach does not bring much improvements,
since the supporting data for NOTA actually be-
long to several different relations and are scattered
in the feature space, making it hard to perform
classification.

To better address few-shot NOTA, we propose a
model named BERT-PAIR based on the sequence
classification model in BERT (Devlin et al., 2019).
We pair each query instance with all the support-
ing instances, concatenate each pair as one se-
quence, and send the concatenated sequence to
the BERT sequence classification model to get the
score of the two instances expressing the same re-
lation. Denote the BERT model as B, the query
instance as x and the paired supporting instance
as xjr (the j-th supporting instance for the relation
r), B(x, xjr) outputs a two-element vector corre-
sponding to scores of the pair sharing the same re-
lation and not sharing the same relation. The prob-
ability over each relation in the few-shot scenario,
including NOTA, is addressed as follows,

p(y = r|x) = exp(or)∑
r′∈R exp(or′)

, r ∈ R (3)

where y is the predicted label and R =
{r1, ..., rN ,NOTA} is the relation set including
NOTA. For r ∈ {r1, ..., rN}, or is calculated by
averaging,

5 Experiments

5.1 Baseline Models for Few-Shot Learning
We pick the two best models from the results in
Han et al. (2018), GNN (Satorras and Estrach,
2018) and Prototypical Networks (Snell et al.,
2017), as our baseline models. As for the en-
coders, besides the CNN encoder used in Han et al.
(2018), we also adopt BERT since it achieves the
state-of-the-arts in multiple tasks (Devlin et al.,
2019). For all models and encoders, we follow the
parameter settings from Han et al. (2018) and De-
vlin et al. (2019).

5.2 Evaluation Results on Few-Shot DA
Table 2 demonstrates the evaluation results of
few-shot DA on the existing FewRel test set and

(1) All few-shot models suffer dramatic perfor-

(2) Adversarial training does improve the re-
sults on the new test domain, yet still has large
space for growth.

(3) BERT-PAIR outperforms all other few-shot
models on both 1.0 and 2.0 test set.

Besides, to see where the growth boundary is,
we split 10 relations, 1, 000 instances out of the 2.0
test set and add them to the training set, then train
and evaluate BERT-PAIR on the new data. We get
72.30% for 5-way 1-shot and 80.50% for 5-way 5-
shot, 16 and 13 points higher than the current best
results. Note that only 1, 000 training instances
can lead to such an enormous gap, indicating that

there is still a huge room for improvements.

5.3 Evaluation Results on Few-Shot NOTA

We evaluate Prototypical Networks with the naive
NOTA solution described in Section 4 and BERT-
PAIR under the NOTA setting. All models are
trained given 50% NOTA queries and tested under
four different NOTA rates: 0%, 15%, 30%, 50%.
To show how accuracy falls if ignoring the NOTA
relation, we also demonstrate the results of models
without considering NOTA (marked with * in Fig-
ure 2). We demonstrate the evaluation results in
Figure 2. For detailed numbers of results on few-
shot NOTA, please refer to Table 3. From Figure 2
we can conclude that:

(1) Treating NOTA as the N +1 relation is ben-
eficial for handling Few-Shot NOTA, though the
results still fall fast when the NOTA rate increases.

(2) BERT-PAIR works better under the NOTA
setting for its binary-classification style model,
and stays stable with rising NOTA rate.

(3) Though BERT-PAIR achieves promising re-
sults, huge gaps still exist between the conven-
tional (0% NOTA rate) and NOTA settings (gaps
of 8 points for 5-way 1-shot and 7 points for 5-
way 5-shot with 50% NOTA rate), which calls for
further research to address the challenge.

6 Conclusion

In this paper, we propose FewRel 2.0, a more chal-
lenging few-shot relation classification task with

a new test set from the biomedical domain and
the none-of-the-above setting. The purpose of
the new task is to explore two aspects which are
ignored in the previous work: few-shot domain
adaptation (few-shot DA) and few-shot none-of-
the-above detection (few-shot NOTA). Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the existing state-
of-the-art few-shot models struggle on the new
task. We also point out some possible direc-
tions to handle these two issues, implement sev-
eral new models and evaluate them with the new
task. Though achieving promising improvements,
these commonly-used techniques are still not the
satisfactory solutions for few-shot DA and few-
shot NOTA, which requires further explorations in
these two real-world challenges.
