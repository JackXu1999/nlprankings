Abstract

This paper presents the task on the evalu-
ation of Compositional Distributional Se-
mantics Models on full sentences orga-
nized for the first time within SemEval-
2014. Participation was open to systems
based on any approach. Systems were pre-
sented with pairs of sentences and were
evaluated on their ability to predict hu-
man judgments on (i) semantic relatedness
and (ii) entailment. The task attracted 21
teams, most of which participated in both
subtasks. We received 17 submissions in
the relatedness subtask (for a total of 66
runs) and 18 in the entailment subtask (65
runs).

1 Introduction

Distributional Semantic Models (DSMs) approx-
imate the meaning of words with vectors sum-
marizing their patterns of co-occurrence in cor-
pora. Recently, several compositional extensions
of DSMs (CDSMs) have been proposed, with the
purpose of representing the meaning of phrases
and sentences by composing the distributional rep-
resentations of the words they contain (Baroni and
Zamparelli, 2010; Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh,
2011; Mitchell and Lapata, 2010; Socher et al.,
2012). Despite the ever increasing interest in the
field, the development of adequate benchmarks for
CDSMs, especially at the sentence level, is still
lagging. Existing data sets, such as those intro-
duced by Mitchell and Lapata (2008) and Grefen-
stette and Sadrzadeh (2011), are limited to a few
hundred instances of very short sentences with a
fixed structure. In the last ten years, several large

data sets have been developed for various com-
putational semantics tasks, such as Semantic Text
Similarity (STS)(Agirre et al., 2012) or Recogniz-
ing Textual Entailment (RTE) (Dagan et al., 2006).
Working with such data sets, however, requires
dealing with issues, such as identifying multiword
expressions, recognizing named entities or access-
ing encyclopedic knowledge, which have little to
do with compositionality per se. CDSMs should
instead be evaluated on data that are challenging
for reasons due to semantic compositionality (e.g.
context-cued synonymy resolution and other lexi-
cal variation phenomena, active/passive and other
syntactic alternations, impact of negation at vari-
ous levels, operator scope, and other effects linked
to the functional lexicon). These issues do not oc-
cur frequently in, e.g., the STS and RTE data sets.

With these considerations in mind, we devel-
oped SICK (Sentences Involving Compositional
Knowledge), a data set aimed at filling the void,
including a large number of sentence pairs that
are rich in the lexical, syntactic and semantic phe-
nomena that CDSMs are expected to account for,
but do not require dealing with other aspects of
existing sentential data sets that are not within
the scope of compositional distributional seman-
tics. Moreover, we distinguished between generic
semantic knowledge about general concept cate-
gories (such as knowledge that a couple is formed
by a bride and a groom) and encyclopedic knowl-
edge about specific instances of concepts (e.g.,
knowing the fact that the current president of the
US is Barack Obama). The SICK data set contains
many examples of the former, but none of the lat-
ter.

2 The Task

The Task involved two subtasks. (i) Relatedness:
predicting the degree of semantic similarity be-
tween two sentences, and (ii) Entailment: detect-
ing the entailment relation holding between them

1



(see below for the exact definition). Sentence re-
latedness scores provide a direct way to evalu-
ate CDSMs, insofar as their outputs are able to
quantify the degree of semantic similarity between
sentences. On the other hand, starting from the
assumption that understanding a sentence means
knowing when it is true, being able to verify
whether an entailment is valid is a crucial chal-
lenge for semantic systems.

In the semantic relatedness subtask, given two
sentences, systems were required to produce a re-
latedness score (on a continuous scale) indicating
the extent to which the sentences were expressing
a related meaning. Table 1 shows examples of sen-
tence pairs with different degrees of semantic re-
latedness; gold relatedness scores are expressed on
a 5-point rating scale.

In the entailment subtask, given two sentences
A and B, systems had to determine whether the
meaning of B was entailed by A. In particular, sys-
tems were required to assign to each pair either
the ENTAILMENT label (when A entails B, viz.,
B cannot be false when A is true), the CONTRA-
DICTION label (when A contradicted B, viz. B is
false whenever A is true), or the NEUTRAL label
(when the truth of B could not be determined on
the basis of A). Table 2 shows examples of sen-
tence pairs holding different entailment relations.

Participants were invited to submit up to five
system runs for one or both subtasks. Developers
of CDSMs were especially encouraged to partic-
ipate, but developers of other systems that could
tackle sentence relatedness or entailment tasks
were also welcome. Besides being of intrinsic in-
terest, the latter systems’ performance will serve
to situate CDSM performance within the broader
landscape of computational semantics.

3 The SICK Data Set

The SICK data set, consisting of about 10,000 En-
glish sentence pairs annotated for relatedness in
meaning and entailment, was used to evaluate the
systems participating in the task. The data set
creation methodology is outlined in the following
subsections, while all the details about data gen-
eration and annotation, quality control, and inter-
annotator agreement can be found in Marelli et al.
(2014).

3.1 Data Set Creation

SICK was built starting from two existing data
sets: the 8K ImageFlickr data set1 and the
SemEval-2012 STS MSR-Video Descriptions data
set.2 The 8K ImageFlickr dataset is a dataset of
images, where each image is associated with five
descriptions. To derive SICK sentence pairs we
randomly chose 750 images and we sampled two
descriptions from each of them. The SemEval-
2012 STS MSR-Video Descriptions data set is a
collection of sentence pairs sampled from the short
video snippets which compose the Microsoft Re-
search Video Description Corpus. A subset of 750
sentence pairs were randomly chosen from this
data set to be used in SICK.

In order to generate SICK data from the 1,500
sentence pairs taken from the source data sets, a 3-
step process was applied to each sentence compos-
ing the pair, namely (i) normalization, (ii) expan-
sion and (iii) pairing. Table 3 presents an example
of the output of each step in the process.

The normalization step was carried out on the
original sentences (S0) to exclude or simplify in-
stances that contained lexical, syntactic or seman-
tic phenomena (e.g., named entities, dates, num-
bers, multiword expressions) that CDSMs are cur-
rently not expected to account for.

The expansion step was applied to each of the
normalized sentences (S1) in order to create up to
three new sentences with specific characteristics
suitable to CDSM evaluation. In this step syntac-
tic and lexical transformations with predictable ef-
fects were applied to each normalized sentence, in
order to obtain (i) a sentence with a similar mean-
ing (S2), (ii) a sentence with a logically contradic-
tory or at least highly contrasting meaning (S3),
and (iii) a sentence that contains most of the same
lexical items, but has a different meaning (S4) (this
last step was carried out only where it could yield
a meaningful sentence; as a result, not all normal-
ized sentences have an (S4) expansion).

Finally, in the pairing step each normalized
sentence in the pair was combined with all the
sentences resulting from the expansion phase and
with the other normalized sentence in the pair.
Considering the example in Table 3, S1a and S1b
were paired. Then, S1a and S1b were each com-
bined with S2a, S2b,S3a, S3b, S4a, and S4b, lead-

ing to a total of 13 different sentence pairs.
Furthermore, a number of pairs composed of

completely unrelated sentences were added to the
data set by randomly taking two sentences from
two different pairs.

The result is a set of about 10,000 new sen-
tence pairs, in which each sentence is contrasted
with either a (near) paraphrase, a contradictory or
strongly contrasting statement, another sentence
with very high lexical overlap but different mean-
ing, or a completely unrelated sentence. The ra-
tionale behind this approach was that of building
a data set which encouraged the use of a com-
positional semantics step in understanding when
two sentences have close meanings or entail each
other, hindering methods based on individual lex-
ical items, on the syntactic complexity of the two
sentences or on pure world knowledge.

3.2 Relatedness and Entailment Annotation

Each pair in the SICK dataset was annotated to
mark (i) the degree to which the two sentence
meanings are related (on a 5-point scale), and (ii)
whether one entails or contradicts the other (con-

sidering both directions). The ratings were col-
lected through a large crowdsourcing study, where
each pair was evaluated by 10 different subjects,
and the order of presentation of the sentences was
counterbalanced (i.e., 5 judgments were collected
for each presentation order). Swapping the order
of the sentences within each pair served a two-
fold purpose: (i) evaluating the entailment rela-
tion in both directions and (ii) controlling pos-
sible bias due to priming effects in the related-
ness task. Once all the annotations were collected,
the relatedness gold score was computed for each
pair as the average of the ten ratings assigned by
participants, whereas a majority vote scheme was
adopted for the entailment gold labels.

3.3 Data Set Statistics

For the purpose of the task, the data set was ran-
domly split into training and test set (50% and
50%), ensuring that each relatedness range and en-
tailment category was equally represented in both
sets. Table 4 shows the distribution of sentence
pairs considering the combination of relatedness
ranges and entailment labels. The “total” column

4 Evaluation Metrics and Baselines

Both subtasks were evaluated using standard met-
rics. In particular, the results on entailment were
evaluated using accuracy, whereas the outputs on
relatedness were evaluated using Pearson correla-
tion, Spearman correlation, and Mean Squared Er-
ror (MSE). Pearson correlation was chosen as the
official measure to rank the participating systems.

Table 5 presents the performance of 4 base-
lines. The Majority baseline always assigns
the most common label in the training data
(NEUTRAL), whereas the Probability baseline
assigns labels randomly according to their rela-
tive frequency in the training set. The Overlap
baseline measures word overlap, again with
parameters (number of stop words and EN-
TAILMENT/NEUTRAL/CONTRADICTION
thresholds) estimated on the training part of the
data.

Baseline Relatedness Entailment
Chance 0 33.3%
Majority NA 56.7%
Probability NA 41.8%
Overlap 0.63 56.2%

5 Submitted Runs and Results

Overall, 21 teams participated in the task. Partici-
pants were allowed to submit up to 5 runs for each
subtask and had to choose the primary run to be in-
cluded in the comparative evaluation. We received
17 submissions to the relatedness subtask (for a
total of 66 runs) and 18 for the entailment subtask
(65 runs).

We asked participants to pre-specify a pri-
mary run to encourage commitment to a
theoretically-motivated approach, rather than
post-hoc performance-based assessment. Inter-
estingly, some participants used the non-primary
runs to explore the performance one could reach
by exploiting weaknesses in the data that are not
likely to hold in future tasks of the same kind
(for instance, run 3 submitted by The Meaning
Factory exploited sentence ID ordering informa-
tion, but it was not presented as a primary run).
Participants could also use non-primary runs to
test smart baselines. In the relatedness subtask
six non-primary runs slightly outperformed the
official winning primary entry,3 while in the
entailment task all ECNU’s runs but run 4 were
better than ECNU’s primary run. Interestingly,
the differences between the ECNU’s runs were

fordNLP’s run4 (0.83462) and run2 (0.83103).

due to the learning methods used.
We present the results achieved by primary runs

against the Entailment and Relatedness subtasks in
Table 6 and Table 7, respectively.4 We witnessed
a very close finish in both subtasks, with 4 more
systems within 3 percentage points of the winner
in both cases. 4 of these 5 top systems were the
same across the two subtasks. Most systems per-
formed well above the best baselines from Table
5.

The overall performance pattern suggests that,
owing perhaps to the more controlled nature of
the sentences, as well as to the purely linguistic
nature of the challenges it presents, SICK entail-
ment is “easier” than RTE. Considering the first
five RTE challenges (Bentivogli et al., 2009), the
median values ranged from 56.20% to 61.75%,
whereas the average values ranged from 56.45%
to 61.97%. The entailment scores obtained on
the SICK data set are considerably higher, being
77.06% for the median system and 75.36% for
the average system. On the other hand, the re-
latedness task is more challenging than the one
run on MSRvid (one of our data sources) at STS
2012, where the top Pearson correlation was 0.88
(Agirre et al., 2012).

6 Approaches

A summary of the approaches used by the sys-
tems to address the task is presented in Table 8.
In the table, systems in bold are those for which
the authors submitted a paper (Ferrone and Zan-
zotto, 2014; Bjerva et al., 2014; Beltagy et al.,
2014; Lai and Hockenmaier, 2014; Alves et al.,
2014; León et al., 2014; Bestgen, 2014; Zhao et
al., 2014; Vo et al., 2014; Biçici and Way, 2014;
Lien and Kouylekov, 2014; Jimenez et al., 2014;
Proisl and Evert, 2014; Gupta et al., 2014). For the
others, we used the brief description sent with the
system’s results, double-checking the information
with the authors. In the table, “E” and “R” refer
to the entailment and relatedness task respectively,
and “B” to both.

Almost all systems combine several kinds of
features. To highlight the role played by com-
position, we draw a distinction between compo-
sitional and non-compositional features, and di-
vide the former into ‘fully compositional’ (sys-

nical problems with the submission. The best ITTK’s non-
primary run scored 78,2% accuracy in the entailment task and
0.76 r in the relatedness task.

tems that compositionally computed the meaning
of the full sentences, though not necessarily by as-
signing meanings to intermediate syntactic con-
stituents) and ‘partially compositional’ (systems
that stop the composition at the level of phrases).
As the table shows, thirteen systems used compo-
sition in at least one of the tasks; ten used compo-
sition for full sentences and six for phrases, only.
The best systems are among these thirteen sys-
tems.

Let us focus on such compositional methods.
Concerning the relatedness task, the fine-grained
analyses reported for several systems (Illinois-
LH, The Meaning Factory and ECNU) shows that
purely compositional systems currently reach per-
formance above 0.7 r. In particular, ECNU’s
compositional feature gives 0.75 r, The Meaning
Factory’s logic-based composition model 0.73 r,
and Illinois-LH compositional features combined
with Word Overlap 0.75 r. While competitive,
these scores are lower than the one of the best

purely non-compositional system (UNAL-NLP)
which reaches the 4th position (0.80 r UNAL-NLP
vs. 0.82 r obtained by the best system). UNAL-
NLP however exploits an ad-hoc “negation” fea-
ture discussed below.

In the entailment task, the best non-
compositional model (again UNAL-NLP)
reaches the 3rd position, within close reach of the
best system (83% UNAL-NLP vs. 84.5% obtained
by the best system). Again, purely compositional
models have lower performance. haLF CDSM
reaches 69.42% accuracy, Illinois-LH Word
Overlap combined with a compositional feature
reaches 71.8%. The fine-grained analysis reported
by Illinois-LH (Lai and Hockenmaier, 2014)
shows that a full compositional system (based
on point-wise multiplication) fails to capture
contradiction. It is better than partial phrase-based
compositional models in recognizing entailment
pairs, but worse than them on recognizing neutral
pairs.

Given our more general interest in the distri-
butional approaches, in Table 8 we also classify
the different DSMs used as ‘Vector Space Mod-

els’, ‘Topic Models’ and ‘Neural Language Mod-
els’. Due to the impact shown by learning methods
(see ECNU’s results), we also report the different
learning approaches used.

Several participating systems deliberately ex-
ploit ad-hoc features that, while not helping a true
understanding of sentence meaning, exploit some
systematic characteristics of SICK that should be
controlled for in future releases of the data set.
In particular, the Textual Entailment subtask has
been shown to rely too much on negative words
and antonyms. The Illinois-LH team reports that,
just by checking the presence of negative words
(the Negation Feature in the table), one can detect
86.4% of the contradiction pairs, and by combin-
ing Word Overlap and antonyms one can detect
83.6% of neutral pairs and 82.6% of entailment
pairs. This approach, however, is obviously very
brittle (it would not have been successful, for in-
stance, if negation had been optionally combined
with word-rearranging in the creation of S4 sen-
tences, see Section 3.1 above).

Finally, Table 8 reports about the use of external
resources in the task. One of the reasons we cre-
ated SICK was to have a compositional semantics
benchmark that would not require too many ex-
ternal tools and resources (e.g., named-entity rec-
ognizers, gazetteers, ontologies). By looking at
what the participants chose to use, we think we
succeeded, as only standard NLP pre-processing
tools (tokenizers, PoS taggers and parsers) and rel-
atively few knowledge resources (mostly, Word-
Net and paraphrase corpora) were used.

7 Conclusion

We presented the results of the first task on the
evaluation of compositional distributional seman-
tic models and other semantic systems on full sen-
tences, organized within SemEval-2014. Two sub-
tasks were offered: (i) predicting the degree of re-
latedness between two sentences, and (ii) detect-
ing the entailment relation holding between them.
The task has raised noticeable attention in the
community: 17 and 18 submissions for the relat-
edness and entailment subtasks, respectively, for a
total of 21 participating teams. Participation was
not limited to compositional models but the major-
ity of systems (13/21) used composition in at least
one of the subtasks. Moreover, the top-ranking
systems in both tasks use compositional features.
However, it must be noted that all systems also ex-

Table 8: Summary of the main characteristics of the participating systems on R(elatedness), E(ntailment)
or B(oth)

ploit non-compositional features and most of them
use external resources, especially WordNet. Al-
most all the participating systems outperformed
the proposed baselines in both tasks. Further anal-
yses carried out by some participants in the task
show that purely compositional approaches reach
accuracy above 70% in entailment and 0.70 r for
relatedness. These scores are comparable with the
average results obtained in the task.
