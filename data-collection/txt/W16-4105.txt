Abstract

Computational approaches to readability assessment are generally built and evaluated using gold
standard corpora labeled by publishers or teachers rather than being grounded in observations
about human performance. Considering that both the reading process and the outcome can be
observed, there is an empirical wealth that could be used to ground computational analysis of text
readability. This will also support explicit readability models connecting text complexity and the
reader’s language proficiency to the reading process and outcomes.

This paper takes a step in this direction by reporting on an experiment to study how the rela-
tion between text complexity and reader’s language proficiency affects the reading process and
performance outcomes of readers after reading We modeled the reading process using three eye
tracking variables: fixation count, average fixation count, and second pass reading duration. Our
models for these variables explained 78.9%, 74% and 67.4% variance, respectively. Performance
outcome was modeled through recall and comprehension questions, and these models explained
58.9% and 27.6% of the variance, respectively. While the online models give us a better under-
standing of the cognitive correlates of reading with text complexity and language proficiency,
modeling of the offline measures can be particularly relevant for incorporating user aspects into
readability models.

1 Introduction

Automatic Readability Assessment (ARA) has been an active area of research in computational linguis-
tics over the past two decades, resulting in a wide range of supervised machine learning models that used
both theory driven and data driven features (Petersen, 2007; Feng, 2010; Vajjala and Meurers, 2014b;
Jiang et al., 2015, for example). Though the purpose of ARA is to predict text complexity, the even-
tual goal is ensure that the predictions reflect the comprehension difficulties in the reader. However, so
far, ARA models primarily used training corpora that were based on judgements of teachers and other
language experts, and not based on the actual reading performance of students, as was also recently criti-
cized by education researchers (Valencia et al., 2014; Williamson et al., 2014; Cunningham and Mesmer,
2014). While this can be considered a shortcoming, obtaining large amounts of data on the actual reading
performance of target population is difficult and time consuming. One way to tackle this is to develop a
hybrid ARA model, which separately models text complexity and user’s language comprehension ability
and link them through another model. In this paper, we describe one approach to integrate reader and
text characteristics into a single model for automatic readability assessment.

Eye-tracking was employed as a method to understand various NLP problems such as annotation
task difficulty (Tomanek et al., 2010; Joshi et al., 2013; Joshi et al., 2014; Barrett and Søgaard, 2015),

38



translation difficulty (Mishra et al., 2013), and studying reader eye movements using standard corpora
(Martı́nez-Gómez et al., 2012; Matthies and Søgaard, 2013). Cognitive psychologists have for a long
time studied eye-movement patterns of readers to understand the cognitive processes in reading and
comprehension, and what causes reading difficulty (Just and Carpenter, 1980; Rayner, 1998; Clifton Jr
et al., 2007). Studying the eye movements of readers during reading considering both text and reader
factors will give us a better understanding about the online link (during reading) between text complexity
and reader proficiency. Asking readers to answer questions about the text will give us an understanding
about the offline link (after reading) between text complexity and reader proficiency. Finally, having a
means to combine readability models with a model of readers’ language proficiency will provide us a
solution to create efficient content recommendation system for readers, considering reader characteristics
into account.

On this background, we report on an experiment that studies the relation between text complexity
and reader proficiency during and after reading. To our knowledge, this is the first reported study to
combine online and and offline measures in one experiment, and develop models for more than one form
of questions. In sum, the contributions of this paper are:

1. We explored modeling the cognitive correlates of text complexity and reader proficiency by studying
the eye movements of readers using three eye-tracking measures: fixation count, average fixation
count, and second pass reading durations.

2. We modeled how readers will respond to two types of questions (recall and comprehension) after
reading the texts of varying reading difficulty, based on their language proficiency. We believe that
this model paves way for the development of better text recommendation systems for readers based
on their proficiency and the readability of the text itself.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 surveys existing literature on the topic and puts our
research in context. Section 3 explains the experimental procedure, Section 4 explains the data analy-
sis methods and variables studied, Section 5 describes the results and Section 6 summarizes the main
conclusions of this paper.

2 Related Work

The effect of text complexity on a reader’s comprehension was studied in cognitive psychology literature
in the 70s and 80s, for various reader groups such as high school students (Evans, 1972), elderly readers
(Walmsley et al., 1981) and primary school students (Green and Olsen, 1988; Smith, 1988). The primary
conclusion from this research so far has been that carefully written simplified versions of texts resulted
in better comprehension. Britton and Gülgöz (1991) showed that rewriting a text based on Kintsch’s
reading comprehension model (Kintsch and van Dijk, 1978) resulted in better free recall of the text.

Apart from this above mentioned research on complex texts and their revised versions, studying eye
movement patterns was shown to be useful in understanding the cognitive processes involved in reading
and comprehension (e.g., Just and Carpenter, 1980; Rayner, 1998; Clifton et al., 2007). Eye tracking,
though time and cost consuming, provides a more natural way to study the reading processes and allows
us to study the processes like re-reading of the text by readers. Eye movements in reading research
are typically studied in terms of fixations, saccades and regressions. Fixations refer to the relatively
stationary positions of the eye at specific areas of text and saccades refer to the rapid eye movements
between fixations. Regressions refer to the cases where the reader revisits and fixates on parts that were
already read. Reader’s comprehension difficulties were shown to manifest in longer fixations, shorter
saccades and more regressions in previous research (cf. Rayner (1998) for a review).

Text readability and its effects on reading comprehension have not been explored much from the
perspective of reader proficiency and reading performance, to our knowledge. Two studies that are
closely related to the current research are Rayner et al. (2006) and Crossley et al. (2014). Rayner et
al. (2006) explicitly studied how text’s difficulty level affects eye movement measures in reading and
concluded that the text difficulty rating correlated strongly with average fixation duration, number of

39



fixations and total time. Readers’ performance with comprehension questions did not have a significant
correlation with text difficulty in their experiment. More recently, Crossley et al. (2014) used a moving
window self-paced reading task to study the effect of text simplification on text comprehension and
reading time of second language learners of English. The moving window shows a sentence step by
step, without showing the full text, and with no means to do re-reading. Comprehension was assessed by
means of yes/no questions and the subjects also participated in an English proficiency test. Their results
showed that while text complexity affected the reading time, this effect was no longer significant upon
including the subject’s English reading proficiency as a covariate. In terms of comprehension, while
text complexity was significant, the effect of text complexity on comprehension was less for highly
proficient readers compared to low proficiency readers. Our study differs from Rayner et al. (2006)
in terms of materials and analysis methods. While they used a collection on unrelated text passages
for their study, we use same texts written in two versions for the experiments. Our study differs from
Crossley et al. (2014) in terms of the experimental methods. While they did a self-paced reading time
study with a moving window approach, we used eye-tracking, which allows us to observe more reading
variables. Finally, our study differs from both the studies in terms of additional eye-tracking and reader
performance variables studied.

3 Experiment

Participants: 48 non-native English speakers studying in a German university participated in this
study. Their English proficiency was evaluated using a standardized online c-test (Taylor, 1953) used at
the University for placement testing, and the average score of the participants was 72.6 (range: [21, 112])
where a score of 100+ is considered highly proficient. The participants came from different L1 back-
grounds. We collected this information but it was not used in the analyses reported here.

Texts: Four texts, each written in two versions (advanced and beginner), taken from on-
estopenglish.com, were used in this study. Texts from the same source were used in related research
(Crossley et al., 2014). Since the participants read the text from an eye-tracker, we restricted the length
of texts used to 300-350 words in both versions. They read a practice text and answered questions before
starting the actual experiment. Eight recall questions and six comprehension questions per text were
created, which had the same answer in both versions of a text. While the recall questions primarily dealt
with the factual information in the text and had short answers spanning a few words, comprehension
questions were yes/no questions that needed drawing inferences. All the authors worked together to cre-
ate the questions, and the final list of questions was created after a discussion to reach consensus about
the questions and answers to the questions.1 The responses of participants were manually evaluated by a
graduate student, by comparing them with the gold standard answers.

Table 1 shows some statistics about the texts used, along with additional information about the com-
plexity of the texts based on automated approaches.

Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (Kincaid et al., 1975) is a standard readability formula. VM refers to the
readability score assigned by the model of Vajjala and Meurers (2014a), which is a regression model
based on several lexical and syntactic features, and outputs a score between 1–6, with higher values in-
dicating more difficult texts. Surprisal is a psycholinguistic measure of expected cognitive load during
sentence processing, based on information theory. We took the average total surprisal for all sentences
from Roark parser (Roark et al., 2009) as a measure of surprisal for each text. Though we modeled
different notions of complexity, we only report about the models with the binary complexity from on-
estopenglish.com in this paper.

Procedure: We employed Latin square design for the experiment, making sure each participant read
all four texts, alternating between easy and difficult versions. No participant read the same text in two
versions. They answered questions on paper after each text and the eye-tracker was re-calibrated for their
next reading. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the four experimental conditions, which
differed in the order of texts read. We conducted the experiment using iViewXTM Hi-speed eye-tracker
from Senso Motoric Instruments (SMI) and collected the reading data through SMI BeGaze2 software
with Reading package.

4 Analysis Methods

4.1 Modeling

We modeled our experimental data using Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs, Wood (2006))
and in a cross validation setup. GAMMs are a combination of Generalized Additive Models (GAM)
and mixed effects models. Whereas GAM allows us to model complex non-linear interactions between
variables by modeling the response variable as a function a smoothed version of predictor variables,
GAMM adds an additional layer of modeling convenience to GAM by allowing us to delineate between
variables with fixed effects and random effects as in a mixed effects model. In these models, fixed effects
refer to the independent variables considered in the experiment design and random effect variables are
used to model the variation due to sampling choices. In our experiment, texts and participants can be
considered random variables, since we cannot sample all possible texts or humans in a single experiment.
Following previous research which used GAMMs for linguistic studies (Wieling et al., 2014; Nixon et
al., 2015), we constructed our GAMM models as implemented in the mgcv3 (Wood, 2011) package in
R.

4.2 Experimental Variables

Dependent Variables: We report on three eye-tracking variables and two reader performance measures
as our dependent variables:4

Three eye-tracking measures – average fixation count (average number of times a reader fixates on
a word) and average fixation duration (average duration of such fixations in milliseconds), and average
second pass reading time (in milliseconds) – were analyzed to study study how the relation between text
complexity and reader proficiency affects online processing of these texts. Previous research in cognitive
psychology has shown that a reader’s comprehension difficulties are reflected in eye-movements through
increased (Rayner, 1998) and longer (Just and Carpenter, 1980; Rayner, 1998) fixations. Both these
measures are also known to correlate with text difficulty in the experiment described by Rayner et al.
(2006).

Two reader performance outcome measures – number of correct answers for recall and comprehension
questions – were used as dependent variables related to offline measures. Each text had eight recall and
six comprehension questions, which are the maximum scores the participants can get per text respec-
tively.

Independent (fixed effect) Variables: We considered the binary text complexity (categorical: elemen-
tary and advanced as easy and difficult respectively) and the reader’s English proficiency (numeric) as
two primary independent variables. Additionally, hypothesizing that there could be some effect of read-
ing texts one after another, we also considered the order in which the participant read a given text (which
depends on the experimental condition) as another independent variable.

Random Effects Variables: The two likely random effect factors that can cause a systematic variation
in model construction in this experiment are participants and texts. Thus, we considered both of them as
random effect variables.

5 Results

For each dependent variable, multiple GAMM models were constructed with different random effect
structures, interaction components, and smoothing functions. Model performance was compared in terms
of variance explained (R2) and statistical significance of the differences were compared using the itsadug5

(van Rij et al., 2016) package in R. We report the results with only the best performing model for each
variable below.

Online measures – Fixation count: The best performing model for fixation count explained 78.9%
of the variance and included a three way interaction between text difficulty, reader proficiency and text
order, modeled with a tensor product smooth function and with log-transformed fixation counts. While
the interaction between proficiency and text complexity was not by itself a significant factor in this
model, the three way interaction between proficiency, complexity and text order was significant. The
model summary, showing the parametric coefficients and the significant smooth terms can be seen in
Table 2.

Table 2: Best Performing Model for Fixation Count (* indicates statistically significant)

The negative co-efficient for difficulty in Table 2 shows that the fixation count decreases as one goes
from difficult to easy texts. It also shows that the random variations due to the individual differences
among participants and texts are both significant factors. This reiterates the usefulness of considering
random effects and going beyond linear models, in understanding the relation between eye-tracking
variables, reader proficiency, and text complexity. A visualization of the three way interaction between
proficiency, text complexity and text order is presented in Figure 1.

We can observe from the figure that low proficiency readers make higher number of fixations (darker
color indicates lower values) when they read difficult texts compared to easy texts. However, the number
of fixations also increase depending when they read a text. The fixation counts are clearly lower for the
texts they read in the early parts of the experiment. However, this effect (and that of text complexity)
is less pronounced in more proficient readers. Thus, we can conclude that fixation count is affected by
changes in both reader proficiency and text complexity.

Online measures – Average Fixation Duration (AFD): The best model for AFD explained 74% of
the variance and uses the default thin plate regression spline smoothing without performing any transfor-
mations on the AFD. Table 3.

Table 3: Summary of the GAMM model for Average Fixation Duration

Only proficiency (p < 0.05) and text order (p < 0.001) had a significant effect for AFD, with higher
proficiencies resulting in lower fixation durations. The relationship between proficiency and AFD was
non-linear and both the random effects were significant (p < 0.001). None of the interactions were
significant. These results lead us to a conclusion that AFD is not affected by text complexity, but is
affected by a reader’s proficiency, in our experimental data.

Online measures – Second pass reading duration: The best performing model for second pass dura-
tion explained 67.4% of the variance and included a three way interaction between text difficulty, reader
proficiency and text order, modeled with a tensor product smooth function and with log-transformed
fixation counts. Table 4 summarizes the coefficients of the GAMM model. As can be observed from the
model summary in Table 4, text difficulty, text order, the three way interaction between proficiency, text
order and difficulty, and both the random effects – all were significant predictors for this model.

Offline measures – Recall: The best performing model involved a three way interaction, as in fixation
count and second pass reading duration, and with tensor smooths. Table 5 shows the model summary
in terms of its coefficients and smooth terms. As we can see in the parametric coefficients, positive
co-efficient for difficulty variable indicates that the performance of participants with recall questions
increased as one moved from difficult to easy texts, which means they scored higher for easy texts.
There is also a significant interaction between proficiency, text order and text difficulty, and both the
random effects were significant. This leads us to a conclusion that the participants’ responses to recall
questions depends on both text difficulty and reader proficiency, along with other factors.

Table 5: Best Performing Model for Recall

Offline measures – Comprehension: The best model for comprehension scores explained only 27.6%
of variance compared to other variables, with only proficiency being a significant predictor, apart from
the random variation due to texts used. Table 6 shows the model summary for comprehension scores. It
is interesting to note that text complexity did not affect reader’s comprehension of a text. Thus, though
we hypothesized that comprehension scores are affected by text complexity, it seems to depend only on
the language proficiency of the participant and not on the reading level of the text, as was also shown
by Crossley et al. (2014). However, the low performance of this model compared to others described
above needs further study, in order to understand what affects readers’ performance on such yes/no
comprehension questions.

The experiments discussed above demonstrate that the eye-tracking measures we studied seem to be
affected by text complexity, proficiency and their interaction. We also observed that one of the outcome
variables, recall, seem to be influenced by both text complexity and readers’ language proficiency while
only the latter affected the comprehension scores.

Relation between online and offline measures: Given this background, we briefly explored whether
the effect of text complexity and proficiency on online processing can be used to explain the differ-
ences in the learning outcomes of the participants. We used mediation analysis as a means to address
this question. Mediation analysis is the process of studying the relationship between the dependent and
independent variables by means of a third ”mediator” variable. In mediation models, it is generally
hypothesized that the independent variable influences the mediator, which in turn influences the depen-
dent variable. It is usually used to understand the underlying mechanism behind a known relationship.
We performed this analysis using the mediation package in R (Tingley et al., 2014)6 considering the
eye-tracking measures as mediator variables and the recall and comprehension scores as the dependent
variables, and text complexity and language proficiency as the independent variables respectively. To
perform the mediation analyses, we need to ensure that the relationship between the mediator and the
dependent variable is statistically significant in the first place. Among the three eye-tracking measures
we explored, only average fixation duration showed a significant correlation with recall and comprehen-
sion. So, we performed the mediation analysis only with this as the mediator variable. There was no
significant mediation effect of average fixation duration on either recall or comprehension performance
of the participants. Thus, we can conclude that eye-tracking is not mediating the participant differences
in the recall and comprehension scores.

6 Conclusion

In this paper, we described an approach to model the relation between text complexity and the reader’s
language proficiency. Our approach has two parts: modeling the cognitive correlates of text complexity
using eye tracking, and a modeling for performance outcomes of the reader by asking them to answer
questions about the texts they read. These experiments were motivated by the ultimate goal of recom-
mending appropriate texts to readers considering both text complexity and reader proficiency as influ-
encing factors. In terms of the cognitive correlates, while fixation count and second pass duration were
affected by both text complexity and reader proficiency, average fixation duration was affected by reader
proficiency alone. For performance measures, while the recall model explained 58.9% variance and had
both text complexity and reader proficiency as significant predictors, the comprehension model model
was affected by proficiency alone, and explained only 27.6% of the variance.

The results from the our analyses support the conclusion that the eye-movement patterns of the read-
ers are sensitive to the complexity of the text they are reading, as was seen by increased fixation counts
and second pass reading time with increased text complexity. Average fixation duration was affected
by language proficiency but not text complexity. In terms of the outcome measures, on one hand, the
performance of recall and comprehension models leaves scope for a lot of improvement to be used in real
life application scenarios. But, it also reiterates the importance of considering differences between ques-
tion types during modeling. Further, our comprehension questions here primarily consisted of Yes/No

questions that relied on short pieces of information. Modeling responses to other questions that require
detailed responses, and that address different levels of comprehension (Day and Park, 2005) may help us
build better models in future.

The approach described in this experiment used human encoded text complexity labels and an auto-
mated proficiency test. Replacing human created labels with an automated readability assessment model
prediction will make the offline measures models applicable to new texts, making it useful for text rec-
ommendation based on reader language proficiency and text complexity. Thus, the approach can provide
a means to personalize text recommendations considering both reading level and reader characteristics
into account, without requiring any search logs per user. This approach can also avoid the problem of
creating huge amounts of user based reading data to train readability assessment models by keeping the
text complexity model separate from the user proficiency model, but combining them together into a
ensemble model.

The current paper demonstrates a simple way of combining a model of text complexity and a simple
model of reader proficiency to predict the recall and comprehension of a given reader and a given text.
However, text complexity is much richer than a single number, as the wide range of linguistic features
considered in Vajjala (2015) illustrate, and future modeling of the link between text complexity and
reader proficiency arguably should consider incorporating different aspects of language form and content
(vocabulary, syntax, discourse coherence, etc.) into the model. Similarly, future modeling of users
should integrate more aspects of language proficiency (e.g., complexity, accuracy, fluency), and cognitive
individual differences (e.g., working memory capacity) to build a richer proficiency profile for the user.
Consequently, a comprehensive combined model of text complexity and reader proficiency will need to
consider all these aspects and their potential interaction.
