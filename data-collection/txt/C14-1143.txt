Abstract

We construct a hierarchically aligned Chinese-English parallel treebank by manually doing word
alignments and phrase alignments simultaneously on parallel phrase-based parse trees. The main
innovation of our approach is that we leave words without a translation counterpart (which are
mostly language-particular function words) unaligned on the word level, and locate and align the
appropriate phrases which encapsulate them. In doing so, we harmonize word-level and phrase-
level alignments. We show that this type of annotation can be performedwith high inter-annotator
consistency and have both linguistic and engineering potentials.

1 Introduction
The value of human annotated syntactic structures for Statistical Machine Translation has been clearly

demonstrated in string-to-tree (Galley et al., 2004; Galley et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006), tree-to-string
(Liu et al., 2006; Liu and Gildea, 2008), and tree-to-tree (Eisner, 2003; Liu et al., 2009; Chiang, 2010)
models. One recurring issue which hampers the utility of syntactic structures is the incompatibility be-
tween word alignments and syntactic structures (Denero and Klein, 2007; Fossum et al., 2008; Pauls et
al., 2010). The incompatibility arises because word alignments and syntactic structures are established
independently of each other. In the case of tree-to-tree models, there is also the issue of incompatible par-
allel tree structures resulting from divergent syntactic annotation standards that have been independently
conceived based on monolingual corpora (Chiang, 2010). In this paper, we report an effort in building
a Hierarchically Aligned Chinese-English Parallel Treebank (HACEPT) where we manually do word-
level and phrase-level alignments simultaneously on parallel phrase-based parse trees. In this process,
we attempt to establish an annotation standard that harmonizes word-level and phrase-level alignments.
We also analyze a common incompatibility issue between Chinese-English parallel parse trees exposed
in the annotation process, with the goal of solving the issue by semi-automatically revising the trees.
In the rest of this paper, we describe how we construct the HACEPT and discuss issues arising in the

construction process. In Section 2, we discuss the problems of word alignment done without considering
its interaction with syntactic structures. In Section 3, we describe our annotation procedure where we
perform word-level and phrase-level alignments simultaneously in a coordinated manner, and show how
our approach is free of the problems discussed in Section 2. In Section 4, we report a common incom-
patibility issue between parse trees and propose a solution. We also compare the issue with translation
divergence (Dorr, 1994) and show that they are different in nature and occurrence frequency. In Section
5, we present the results of two experiments we have done on our annotation to show the intuitiveness of
our approach and the linguistic and engineering potentials of our corpus. We then describe related work
in Section 6 and conclude our paper in Section 7.

2 Incompatibilities between word alignments and syntactic structures
All the existing word alignment practice we know of treats word alignment as a stand-alone task with-

out systematically considering its interaction with the syntactic structure of a sentence. The inevitable
consequence of the practice is that both redundancies and incompatibilities between word alignments and
syntactic structures will arise in many places. In this section, we illustrate the issues through language-
particular function words, where the problems are most frequently found. Due to language-particular
idiosyncrasy and lack of lexical content, these function words usually do not have a translation coun-
terpart, which presents a great challenge to alignment annotation. There are two logical possibilities of
dealing with these words, both of which are represented in existing annotation practice. The first is to
leave them unaligned or link them to a fictitious NULL word (Ahrenberg, 2007; Brown et al., 1990), and
the second, which also seems to be the more common pratice, is to attach these function words to a word
that has a translation counterpart, and then align the function word and its host with the counterpart of
the host (Melamed, 1998; Li et al., 2009). For ease of discussion, below we will refer to the latter pratice
as the "glue-to-a-host" strategy (GTAHS). Both approaches are less than desirable: the former leaves the
function words unaccounted for, and the latter leads to incompatibility issues we discuss in detail below.
First note that, by attaching language-particular function words to a host, the GTAHS creates redun-

dancies between word alignments and syntactic structures since many of these function words have al-
ready been associated with a host within a constituent in the parse tree (e.g., the English determiner the
is placed inside the projection of its host, namely an NP). A more serious issue is that the GTAHS cre-
ates spurious ambiguities. Lexical ambiguity is inevitable in translation. For instance, the English noun
bank has more than one lexical meaning and each of the meanings corresponds to a different Chinese
word. That fact aside, the GTAHS creates spurious ambiguities, which, in our view, would be harmful
to Machine Translation (MT) if extracted as translation rules. Consider the following example, where
the Chinese noun苹果 is aligned to six English strings (aligned elements are underlined):
(1) a. eat apples <>吃苹果

b. eat an apple <>吃苹果
c. eat the apple <>吃苹果
d. fond of apples <>喜欢苹果
e. talk about apples <>谈论苹果
f. provide them with apples <>给他们苹果

The English apple and the Chinese苹果 match in meaning and are both unambiguous. In cases where
the English noun is used with a determiner as in (1b) and (1c), since Chinese has no determiners and
the bare noun苹果 can be the appropriate translation for either an apple or the apple given a context,
the GTAHS attaches the determiner to apple and the whole string is aligned with苹果. In other similar
cases where an English element such as a preposition is absent in Chinese as in (1d), (1e) and (1f), the
GTAHS glues the preposition to apple and the whole PP is aligned with 苹果. With the GTAHS, the
unambiguous Chinese 苹果 ends up being aligned with more than one English string. This kind of
spurious ambiguity is very common given the GTAHS.
The second issue is that, by attaching function words to a host, the GTAHS effectively creates rudi-

mentary syntactic structures, which are often incompatible with the syntactic structures annotated based
on existing treebanking annotation standards. For example, all the aligned multi-word strings underlined
in (2) do not correspond to a constituent in a Penn TreeBank (Marcus et al., 1993) or Chinese TreeBank
(Xue et al., 2005) parse tree:
(2) a. If I were him <>如果我是他的话

b. He is visiting Beijing <>他正访问北京

1512



c. the beginning of the new year <>新年伊始
d. to quickly and efficiently solve the problem <>迅速有效地解决问题

Given the incompatibilities between existing word alignments and syntactic structures, in the next sec-
tion we describe an approach where we perform word-level and phrase-level alignments simultaneously
on parallel phrase-based parse trees, attempting to construct a hierarchically aligned corpus where word
alignments are harmonized with syntactic structures.

3 Annotation specification and procedure
The data we annotate is the Chinese-English portion of the Parallel Aligned Treebank (PAT) described

in (Li et al., 2012). Our data consists of two batches, one of which is weblogs and the other of which is
postings from online discussion forums. The English sentences in the data set are annotated based on the
original Penn TreeBank (PTB) annotation stylebook (Bies et al., 1995) as well as its extensions (Warner
et al., 2004), while the Chinese sentences in the data set are annotated based on the Chinese TreeBank
(CTB) annotation guidelines (Xue and Xia, 2000) and its extensions (Zhang and Xue, 2012). The PAT
only has word alignments, which are done under the GTAHS, and no phrase alignments.
The main departure of our approach is that we loosen the requirement that every word in a sentence

pair needs to be word-aligned. On the word level, we only align words that have an equivalent in terms
of lexical meaning and grammatical function. For words that do not have a translation counterpart, we
leave them unaligned and locate the appropriate phrases in which they appear to be aligned. This way, we
eliminate both the redundancies and spurious ambiguities discussed in Section 2. Since phrase alignment
is done between syntactic nodes on parallel parse trees, we also eliminate the incompatibilities between
word alignments and syntactic structures. See the discussion of the concrete example in Figure 1 below
to see the points made here.
Next we discuss our annotation procedure in detail. Our annotators are presented with sentence pairs

that come with parallel parse trees. The task of the annotator is to decide, first on the word level and then
on the phrase level, if a word or phrase needs to be aligned at all, and if so, to which word or phrase it
should be aligned. The decisions about word alignment and phrase alignment are not independent, and
must obey well-formedness constraints as outlined in (Tinsley et al., 2007):

a. A non-terminal node can only be aligned once.
b. if Node nc is aligned to Node ne, then the descendants of nc can only be aligned to descendants of

ne.
c. if Node nc is aligned to Node ne, then the ancestors of nc can only be aligned to ancestors of ne.

This means that once a word alignment is in place, it puts constraints on phrase alignments. A pair of
non-terminal nodes (nc, ne) cannot be aligned if a word that is a descendant of nc is aligned to a word
that is not a descendant of ne on the word level.
Let us use the concrete example in Figure 1 to illustrate the annotation process, which is guided by a set

of detailed annotation guidelines. On the word level, only those words that are connected with a dashed
line are aligned since they have equivalents. Note that the Chinese words把 (a function word used to
prepose the object to the left of the verb),这样 (an adverb meaning "this way"),可 (a modal meaning
"can") and the English discourse connective so that, the auxiliary verb is and the preposition from are all
left unaligned on the word level. Aligning these function words will generate artificial ambiguous cases
and create incompatibilities between word alignments and parse trees that have already been illustrated
and discussed in Section 2. For instance, if把 is to be word-aligned, it would be glued to the noun重
力 and the whole string把重力 will be aligned to the English gravity. Note that both重力 and gravity
are unambiguous and form a one-to-one correspondence. With the word alignment between 把 重力
and gravity, we make the unambiguous gravity correspond to both 重力 and 把 重力 (and possibly

more strings), thus creating a spurious ambiguity. Also note that the string 把 重力 does not form a
constituent in the Chinese parse tree, so the word alignment is incompatible with the syntactic structure
of the sentence. By leaving把 unaligned, we avoid both the spurious ambiguity and the incompatibility.
With word alignments in place, next the annotator needs to perform phrase alignments. Note that word

alignments place restrictions on phrase alignments. For instance, e9 and e10 will be ruled out as possible
alignments for c10, because淤泥, a descendant of c10, is aligned to sludge, which is not a descendant of
either e9 or e10. By contrast, e3 is a possible alignment for c10 because the alignment does not violate the
well-formedness constraints. The annotator then needs to decide whether this possible phrase alignment
can be actually made. This is a challenging task since, for a given phrase, there usually are more than one
candidate from which a single alignment needs to be picked. For instance, for e3, there are in total three
possible phrase alignments, namely c10, c3 and c9, all of which obey the well-formedness constraints.
Since a non-terminal node is not allowed to be aligned to multiple non-terminal nodes on the other side,
the annotator needs to choose one among all the candidates. This highlights the point that the alignment
of non-terminal nodes cannot be deterministically inferred from the alignment of terminal nodes. This is
especially true given our approach where some terminal nodes are left unaligned on the word level. For
instance, the reason why c9 is a possible alignment for e3 is because the word这样 is left unaligned. If
这样 were aligned with so that, c9 could not be aligned with e3 since so that is not a descendant of e3
and aligning the two nodes will violate Constraint b.
While Constraints b and c can be enforced automatically given the word alignments, the decisions

regarding the alignment of non-terminal nodes which satisfy Constraint a are based on linguistic consid-
erations. One key consideration is to determine which non-terminal nodes encapsulate the grammatical
relations signaled by the unaligned words so that the alignment of the non-terminal nodes will effectively
capture the unaligned words in their syntactic context. When identifying non-terminal nodes to align,
we follow two seemingly conflicting general principles:

• Phrase alignment should not sever key dependencies involving the grammatical relation signaled
by an unaligned word.

• Phrase alignment should be minimal, in the sense that the phrase alignment should contain only the
elements involved in the grammatical relation, and nothing more.

The first principle ensures that the grammatical relation is properly encapsulated in the aligned non-
terminal nodes. For example in Figure 1, if we attach the English preposition from to running and aligning
them to流到, we would fail to capture the fact that from signals a relation between prohibit and running
downhill. Aligning VPc3 with Se3 captures this relation.
The first principle in and of itself is insufficient to produce desired alignment. Taken to the extreme, it

can be trivially satisfied by aligning the two root nodes of the sentence pair. We also need the alignment
to be minimal, in the sense that aligned non-terminal nodes should contain only the elements involved
in the grammatical relation, and nothing more. These two requirements used in conjunction ensure that
a unique phrase alignment can be found for each unaligned word. The phrase alignments (VPc1, VPe1),
(VPc2, VPe2), (VPc3, Se3), as illustrated in Figure 1, all satisfy these two principles.
In addition to making phrase alignments, the annotator needs to assign labels to phrase alignments. We

have four labels that are designed along two dimensions: the presence/absence of word order difference
and the presence/absence of unaligned function words. The name and definition of each of the four labels
are listed below, and an example for each label is given in Figure 2:

a REO, reordering that does not involve unaligned function words (Figure 2a)
b UFW, unaligned function words (Figure 2b)
c REU, reordering that also involves unaligned function words (Figure 2c)
d STD, structural divergence due to cross-linguistic differences (Figure 2d)

Figure 2: Phrase alignment types

Figure 2a is an example where there is a reordering of the immediate children of the aligned VP nodes.
This is a very typical word order difference between Chinese and English. In Chinese, the PP modifier
is before the verb while in English the PP modifier is after the verb. The phrase alignment illustrated
by Figure 2b has an unaligned function word, namely the English infinitive marker to, which has no
counterpart in Chinese. There are both reordering (difference in the relative order of powerhouse and
economy) and unaligned function words (Chinese的 and English of ) in the phrase alignment in Figure
2c. Figure 2d provides an example where the aligned phrases have structural divergence caused by cross-
linguistic differences between Chinese and English, which we will discuss in some detail in Section 4.

4 A common incompatibility issue between parse trees
During the annotation process, we encountered some incompatibility issues between parse trees. For

a comprehensive and detailed discussion of the issues, see (Deng and Xue, 2014). Here we report the
most common issue, which is caused by differences between treebank annotation guidelines. As already
mentioned, the English parse trees we use are annotated based on the original PTB annotation stylebook
(Bies et al., 1995) as well as its extensions (Warner et al., 2004), while the Chinese parse trees are
annotated based on the CTB annotation guidelines (Xue and Xia, 2000) and its extensions (Zhang and
Xue, 2012). Since PTB and CTB are independently annotated, there are some differences in how certain
structures are annotated. The main issue is that certain structures are so flat as to make some nodes that
should be aligned impossible to be aligned. In general, our alignment task favors deeper structures over
shallower ones so that the annotator can have more choices. This is an issue for both Chinese and English
parse trees. To get a concrete idea of the issue, take a look at Figure 3.
As shown by Figure 3, VPc1 and the English string probably decrease rapidly with distance, and VPe1

and the Chinese string随距离而快速减少, cannot be aligned although they match in meaning and
should be aligned. They cannot be aligned because there is no node for either of the two strings in the
respective parse tree. Note that the incompatibility between the two trees here is due to a difference in
annotation style but not a deep cross-linguistic difference. Both PTB and CTB simplified the annotation
task by making the tree structures flatter to increase annotation speed, but the simplification does not
always come from the same places. The consequence of these annotation decisions is that relevant struc-
tures are sometimes incompatible, which has negatively affected their utility for MT purposes (Chiang,

..The

Figure 3: Unalignable nodes due to differences in tree representation

2010).

To solve this incompatibility issue, we need to create more structures through binarization, which can
be done automatically. Still take Figure 3 for instance, on the English side, if we create a new VP by
combining VPe1 and its sister ADVP, the resulting VP can be aligned with VPc1. On the Chinese side,
if we do binarization to create a VP that dominates the string随距离而快速减少, VPe1 would have
an alignment. Since changing tree structures has the potential risk of causing inconsistency with parse
trees in the original treebanks and had better be done systematically after all the annotation is finished,
we have not done binarization as of the writing of this paper. For the time being, we assign the label
UA (short for Unalignable Node) to nodes which should be aligned but cannot be aligned so that we can
gather some statistics on the extent of the problem. We will come back to revisit the nodes carrying UA
such as VPc1 and VPe1 by proposing systematic changes to the original treebanks.

The UA case discussed above should not be confused with another case of incompatibility, namely
structural divergence between parallel sentences in translation (Dorr, 1994). As shown above, UA is
basically an artificial issue that is caused by difference in parsing guideline design and fixable through
automatic binarization. Structural divergence arises mainly due to genuine cross-linguistic differences.
We provide an example of structural divergence (STD) in Figure 2d. As shown in the figure, the two
aligned phrases (VP and S) are structurally quite different: the English string is a clause with the NP the
sweat as the subject and the VP flowing over me as the predicate (the example is taken out of the sentence
I felt the sweat flowing over me to save space). The Chinese string is a simple verb phrase where the
adverb浑身 (literally whole-body) modifies the verb冒汗 (literally emerge-sweat). In terms of meaning
correspondence,浑身 expresses the meaning of the English PP over me and the verb matches in meaning
with the sweat flowing. We have run an experiment on STD and found that the STD cases are pretty rare
(on average 5 instances in a file with 500 sentence pairs), indicating that the structural difference between
Chinese and English is not so fundamental as to make a big impact on alignment annotation.

5 Annotation experiments
We did two experiments on our annotation. The first is about inter-annotator agreement (IAA), which

is a way of both evaluating the annotation quality and judging the intuitiveness of the annotation task.
An unintuitive annotation task would force the annotator to make subjective choices, which would result
in low IAA. Since the annotation task involves parse trees, ideally we need annotators who are trained
in syntax, but that would put a constraint on the pool of qualified annotators and make it difficult for
the annotation to scale up. In our annotation experiments, we use four annotators who are fluent in both
English and Chinese but have no prior linguistic training, led by a syntactician who performs the final
adjudication.
As of this writing, we have completed the single annotation of 8,932 sentence pairs, 2,500 of which

are double annotated. The IAA statistics presented in Table 1 are based on the double-annotated 2,500
sentence pairs, which are divided into 5 chunks of 500 sentence pairs each. The statistics are for phrase
alignment only, and the micro-average for the 5 chunks is 0.87 (F1), indicating we are able to get good
quality annotation for this task. In addition, the agreement statistics for the 5 chunks are very stable,
even though they are performed by different pairs of annotators, indicating we are getting consistent
annotation from different annotators.
Table 2 shows the result of the second experiment, namely the distribution of the different types of

phrase alignment. It shows that alignments that contain unaligned function words outnumber those that
do not, and that alignments that do not involve reordering outnumber those that do. It also shows that an
overwhelming number of alignments that involve reordering also have unaligned function words. This
means that the function words are potentially useful "triggers" for reordering, which is an important issue
that MT systems are trying to address.

Parallel treebanks are not something new. However, most of the existing parallel treebanks (Li et al.,

2012; Megyesi et al., 2010) do not have phrase alignments. Some (Sulger et al., 2013; Kapanadze, 2012)
do have phrase alignments, but neither discussion about the interaction between word-level and phrase-
level alignments nor report of IAA is provided. There have been a few recent attempts at automatically
aligning subtrees (comparable to our phrases) in the context ofMT research, and the automatic alignments
are evaluated against a small manually aligned data set. For example, (Tinsley et al., 2007) evaluated
an unsupervised algorithm on 810 parsed English-French pairs annotated with subtree alignment. (Xiao
and Zhu, 2013) also developed unsupervised subtree alignment methods (EM and Variational Bayes)
and evaluated their automatic alignment model on 637 sentences from the Chinese TreeBank (and use
the other 99 for tuning). (Sun et al., 2010b; Sun et al., 2010a) also report work on aligning subtrees
and evaluate their impact on MT. However, we are not aware of any attempt to systematically harmonize
word alignment with the alignment of phrases, or subtrees, or to systematically study the incompatibilities
between parallel parse trees.

7 Conclusion
In this paper we report our effort on the construction of a Chinese-English parallel treebank with both

word-level and phrase-level alignments. When constructing the treebank, we systematically consider
the interaction between word alignments and phrase alignments, and try to harmonize the two kinds of
alignments by removing redundancies and incompatibilities between them. We show that this type of
annotation can be performed with high inter-annotator consistency. Given our intention for the treebank
to be a resource for MT, the next step is to synchronize the parallel parse trees, and of course, to perform
automatic hierarchical alignment experiments and MT experiments.
