Abstract

Stance classification aims to identify, for a
particular issue under discussion, whether the
speaker or author of a conversational turn has
Pro (Favor) or Con (Against) stance on the is-
sue. Detecting stance in tweets is a new task
proposed for SemEval-2016 Task6, involv-
ing predicting stance for a dataset of tweets
on the topics of abortion, atheism, climate
change, feminism and Hillary Clinton. Given
the small size of the dataset, our team created
our own topic-specific training corpus by de-
veloping a set of high precision hashtags for
each topic that were used to query the twitter
API, with the aim of developing a large train-
ing corpus without additional human labeling
of tweets for stance. The hashtags selected for
each topic were predicted to be stance-bearing
on their own. Experimental results demon-
strate good performance for our features for
opinion-target pairs based on generalizing de-
pendency features using sentiment lexicons.

1 Introduction

Social media websites such as microblogs, weblogs,
and discussion forums are used by millions of users
to express their opinions on almost everything from
brands, celebrities, and events to important social
and political issues. In recent years, the microblog-
ging service Twitter has emerged as one of the most
popular and useful sources of user content, and re-
cent research has begun to develop tools and com-
putational models for tweet-level opinion and senti-
ment analysis. Stance classification aims to identify,
for a particular issue under discussion, whether the

speaker or author of a conversational turn has a Pro
(Favor) or Con (Against) stance on the issue (So-
masundaran and Wiebe, 2009; Somasundaran and
Wiebe, 2010; Walker et al., 2012c; Sridhar et al.,
2015; Hasan and Ng, 2013).

Detecting stance in tweets is a new task proposed
for SemEval-2016 (Mohammad et al., 2016). The
aim of the task is to determine user stance (FAVOR,
AGAINST, or NONE) in a dataset of tweets on the five
selected topics of abortion, atheism, climate change,
feminism and Hillary Clinton. Consider the tweets
in Table 1, which express stance toward the target
issue Climate Change is a Real Concern. It can be
inferred that the author of tweet T1 is in favor of the
target while the author of tweet T2 is clearly against
the target. However due to the brevity of tweets,
there is not always sufficient information about the
target to determine stance: in the case of tweet T3,
we are unsure what major development the user is
talking about. In the case of tweet T4, we know the
user acknowledges the existence of a drought, but
we do not know their stance on the issue of climate
change solely based on this information. In such
cases the stance of the tweets is labelled NONE for

this issue.
The task is nontrivial due to the challenges of the

tweet genre. Tweets are often highly informal with
language that is colorful and ungrammatical. They
may also involve sarcasm, making opinion-mining
tasks more challenging (Riloff et al., 2013; Reyes
et al., 2012). Users may assert their stance using
factual or emotional content, and due to their re-
stricted length, tweets may not be well structured or
coherent. As a result, NLP tools trained on well-
structured text do not work well in Twitter (Dey
and Haque, 2008), and new tools are constantly be-
ing developed (Qadir and Riloff, 2014; Kong et al.,
2014; Han and Baldwin, 2011; Zhu et al., 2014).

Our approach to stance classification in tweets is
primarily based on developing a suite of tools for
processing Twitter that mirrors our previous work
on stance classification in online forums (Walker et
al., 2012c; Sridhar et al., 2015; Anand et al., 2011;
Walker et al., 2012b; Misra and Walker, 2015). We
develop generalized dependency features that cap-
ture expressed sentiment or attitude towards partic-
ular targets, using the Tweebo dependency parser
(Kong et al., 2014). Given the small size of the of-
ficial task dataset, we created our own topic-specific
training corpus in a semi-supervised manner. We de-
veloped a set of high precision hashtags for each
topic that were used to query the Twitter API in
order to create a large training corpus without ad-
ditional human labeling of tweets for stance. The
hashtags and boolean combinations of hashatgs se-
lected for each topic were predicted to be stance-
bearing on their own. See Table 2.

There has been considerable previous work on
stance classification in online forums and in con-
gressional debates (Thomas et al., 2006; Burfoot
et al., 2011; Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009; So-
masundaran and Wiebe, 2010; Walker et al., 2012c;
Sridhar et al., 2015; Hasan and Ng, 2013; Boltuzic
and Šnajder, 2014; Hasan and Ng, 2014). A num-
ber of these studies show that collective classifi-
cation approaches perform well, and that the con-
text (Walker et al., 2012c; Abbott et al., 2011), and
meta information such as author constraints are use-
ful for stance classification (Hassan et al., 2012;
Hasan and Ng, 2014). Collective classification is
not possible in the current task because the only
information provided is the text of each individual

tweet. Inspired by earlier work (Joshi and Penstein-
Rosé, 2009; Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009; Soma-
sundaran and Wiebe, 2010; Walker et al., 2012b),
we apply a framework for developing features for
opinion-target pairs based on generalized structural
dependency features, using the LIWC dictionary
as the basis for generalization (Pennebaker et al.,
2001). We also develop features to capture domain
knowledge using PMI values for topic n-grams in
order to improve the recognition of tweets with the
NONE stance. We describe our system and data in
Sec. 2, our experimental set-up in Sec. 3, and our re-
sults and error analysis in Sec. 4. We conclude and
discuss future directions in Sec. 5.

2 Data

The relatively small, unbalanced training set pro-
vided for the task introduced an interesting subtask
for precise topic-oriented tweet collection without
direct human annotation. Twitter hashtags provide
a method for users to tag their own content by topic,
and we exploit this self-annotation to collect a larger
dataset for training by hand-selecting seed hashtags
for both the FAVOR and AGAINST stances for each
topic. We then query Twitter for tweets containing
these hashtags using the API, and produce a training
set from the results without further supervision. We
treat the original SemEval dataset as development
data, assuming it is similar to the SemEval test set.

When collecting data in this fashion, there are
multiple factors that must be accounted for. These
include the accuracy of labels, data uniformity and
representativeness, and dataset size. The accuracy
of our labels is directly related to the specificity of
our hashtags. We perform a small evaluation of each
hashtag added to our seed pool by checking it’s ac-
curacy on a subset of queried data by hand. With
regard to data uniformity and representativeness, we
want to ensure that our collected data is not too uni-
form as a large collection of very similar tweets pro-
vides little additional information, and we want to
ensure that our data is representative of the actual
SemEval data that may be produced from different
preprocessing and collection techniques. We evalu-
ate the uniformity and representativeness of our data
in Sec. 4.

After we finish collecting data, we create bal-

anced FAVOR, AGAINST, and NONE training sets for
each topic. Tweets in the NONE class are collected
from other topics or from a corpus of random tweets.
A summary of the final seed hashtags and dataset
sizes is shown in Table 2.

2.1 Data preprocessing

Since tweets can be noisy, uninformative, or am-
biguously labeled, we apply the three filters below
to get better quality tweets.

• Duplicate removal: Remove all tweets that
have an 80% or greater overlap with another al-
ready included tweet.

• Dictionary words: Tweets with less than 4
dictionary words are excluded. Although this
filter may not be appropriate for all tasks as
Tweets may incorporate large amounts of non-
dictionary slang, we observe that the SemEval
training data has few instances that do not pass
this test.

• Favor and Against: Remove tweets that have
both FAVOR and AGAINST hashtags.

2.2 Data Normalization

Tweets can be noisy due to irregular words and other
genre specific language. We preprocess all tweets as
follows:

• Repeated characters: Replace a sequence of re-
peated characters by two characters. For exam-
ple, convert “shooooooooot” to “shoot”.

• Lexical variation: We used the Python Enchant
dictionary to determine if a token is a dictio-
nary word. If a token is not present in the dic-
tionary then it is replaced by finding a possible
lexical variant using the English Social Media
Normalisation Lexicon (Han et al., 2012), for
example, “tmrrw” is changed to “tomorrow”.

We use a part-of-speech tagger for tweets to per-
form tokenization and POS labelling (Gimpel et al.,
2011). We also use TweeboParser, a dependency
parser specifically designed for tweets, to parse each
tweet (Kong et al., 2014).

Our data representation for the corpus keeps track
of the original tweet, the normalization replace-
ments, the POS tags, and the parses. Sec. 3 describes
the features derived from these pre-processing steps
that we also store in our corpus database, modelled
after IAC 2.0. (Abbott et al., 2016).

3 Experimental Setup

We explored a large number of machine learning al-
gorithms and feature combinations, using the auto-
matically harvested tweets as training and the train-
ing set provided for the task as our development data
to fit the parameters for the final submitted NLDS-
UCSC system. Sec. 3.1 describes the feature sets
created using the development set. To evaluate the
effects of hashtags on the test set we explored two
different ways to train the system. Table 4 presents
the results on the test set with hashtags present in
the dataset while Table 5 is the performance without
hashtags.

3.1 Features

Unigrams and Bigrams: We extracted unigrams
and bigrams from the preprocessed tweets. The use-
ful unigrams are mainly hashtags. We used both
stemmed and unstemmed ngrams.
POS bigrams and trigrams: The tweet part-of-
speech tagger is used to perform tokenization and
POS identification (Gimpel et al., 2011). We then
extracted POS bigrams and trigrams as features.
LIWC: We derived features using the Linguistics
Inquiry Word Count tool and use the count of words
in each category as the feature value (Pennebaker et
al., 2001).
Dependency: We used TweeboParser to extract de-
pendency features. For a given tweet, TweeboParser
predicts its syntactic structure, represented by unla-
beled dependencies (Kong et al., 2014).
Generalized LIWC and Opinion Dependency:
We created two kinds of generalized dependency
features. Building on the idea that partially gen-
eralized dependencies are better than ungeneral-
ized or completely generalized dependencies (Joshi
and Penstein-Rosé, 2009), we leave one depen-

dency element lexicalized and generalize the other
to its LIWC category for LIWC dependency fea-
tures. We follow a similar process to produce gen-
eralized opinion dependencies using AFINN lexicon
and opinion-lexicon-English by (Hu and Liu) replac-
ing one element of the dependency with its senti-
ment score and leaving the other element lexical-
ized (Hu and Liu, 2004; Nielsen, 2011). 1 2

Inspired by previous work on combining senti-
ment lexicons we used a combined sentiment score
to denote the accuracy of a sentiment word rather
than its strength. If dictionaries contradict one an-
other on the sentiment polarity for a word, then the
score is neutralized to zero. If a single dictionary
lists the polarity word, but it is unlisted or neutral
in the other dictionary, then the score is 1 in the
direction of the polarity. If both dictionaries list a
word with the same polarity, then the score is 2 in
the direction of the polarity. After calculating the
combined sentiment score, we check if either of the
previous two words is listed as a negation by LIWC,

/sentiment-analysis.html

2http://neuro.imm.dtu.dk/wiki/AFINN

423



and invert the polarity if a negation is found(Cho et
al., 2013; Hasan and Ng, 2012).
Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI): For each
topic, we calculate normalized pointwise mutual in-
formation over a combination of an extended version
of IAC 2.0, a topic annotated database of posts from
debate forums (Abbott et al., 2016; Walker et al.,
2012a), and our own collected tweets for each topic.
IAC 2.0 includes several topics that are in overlap
with the topics in the current task.

We then create a pool of top-N percent PMI uni-
grams, bigrams, and trigrams for each topic and use
the count of words in each tweet that are also in this
pool as a feature. We also use the highest PMI value
of an n-gram in each tweet as a feature.

4 Results

We ran experiments using the SemEval training as
our development data with NaiveBayesMultinomial,
SVM, and J48 from WEKA. We tried a large number
of feature combinations w/ and w/out stemmed n-
grams.

The best performing system ended up being dif-
ferent for each topic. Overall, NBM worked the best
for all topics. Table 3 describes the system model
submitted for each topic based on the results. The
model that performed best on the dev set was used
to report accuracies on the test set. We present the
results on the test set in Table 4. The best performing
model from the dev set for the topic of climate con-
trol shows a marginal but not significant improve-
ment, and none of the features on their own could
beat a unigram baseline for any topic. Since most of
the hashatgs are unigrams, we hypothesize this may
be due to presence of strong stance-bearing hash-
tags in the data. In order to assess the issue of strong
stance-bearing hashtags still existing in the training
data, we remove all hashtags from both the training
data and test data and retrain classifiers. See Table 5.
For the topic of abortion we see that the combined
unigram, bigram, and dependency model now out-
performs the unigram model, and the dependencies
alone start to edge out an advantage as well, sug-
gesting that it may be the case that strong stance-
bearing hashtags distract from and disguise true per-
formance of each feature and potentially the model
as a whole.

Feature ablation results reveal that for the major-
ity of the topics part-of-speech n-grams perform bet-
ter than LIWC. This was surprising because LIWC
was designed to capture emotional and psycholog-
ical behavior in conversations, and because previ-
ous research on stance classification using debate
forums shows LIWC categories can improve an n-
gram baseline (Anand et al., 2011). This may be due
to sarcam and irony, a frequent phenomena in twit-
ter not captured by LIWC, but which may to some
extent be captured by part-of-speech n-grams that
reflect the use of adjectives and adverbs in sarcastic
posts (Lukin and Walker, 2013; Reyes et al., 2012).
Generalizing Twitter-specific dependency structures
using LIWC and sentiment lexicons does however
prove useful.

4.1 Learning Curves
To asses the usefulness of increasing our training set
size we plot learning curves for each topic (abortion
shown in Figure 1 and all others in appendix A). For
each topic we plot the average f-measure (FAVOR,
AGAINST) for a unigram baseline, dependency base-
line, and best performing model on the dev set.

Figure 1: Training set size vs average Fscore for
abortion.

Figure 1 shows that the classifier for the abortion
topic gains around 0.6 f-measure when increasing
the number of instances from 5, 000 to 20, 000, and
it continues to show promise for growth, especially

in terms of the dependency and best model curves.
We see a similar promise for growth in the model
for Hillary Clinton in which dependencies have just
passed unigrams. The differences in learning rate for
each topic suggest that the precision of our stance-
sided seed hashtags varies largely by topic because
similar amounts of data provide less information
gain, signaling the data may be of lower quality. In
addition to extracting more data for each topic, it
would also be helpful to refine our hashtag selection
for topics such as atheism, where increase in training
set size do not yield performance improvement.

5 Conclusion and Future work

We explore a semi-supervised approach to stance
classification using stance-bearing hashtags and
achieve reasonable accuracies on a hand-annotated
test set. This suggests that our approach of query-
ing using seed hashtags and using some heuristic
filters to improve tweet quality may be promising
for generating a large corpus of training data. It
may also be useful in other domains where hand-
annotated data does not exist and getting annotations
is time consuming and costly effort. To determine
the feasibility of using this semi-supervised data in
other domains, we removed all the hashtags from the
tweets and again compared the performance of our
dependency and unigram features. Table 5 shows
that these results look promising. In future work,
we hope to use more intelligent features that may
capture irony and sarcasm, and we plan to expand
and refine our data collection process to account for
the varying precision of stance-sided hashtags across
topics.

A Appendix: Learning Curves

Below we show the learning curves for each topic on
the SemEval test data after removing hashtags from
both the train and test sets. Climate change is ex-
cluded due to the small number of training instances.
Each graph includes a line for unigrams, dependen-
cies, and the best model on the dev set (unigrams are
the best model for the Hillary Clinton topic).
