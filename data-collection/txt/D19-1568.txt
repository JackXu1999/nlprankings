Abstract

Research in the social sciences and psy-
chology has shown that the persuasiveness
of an argument depends not only the lan-
guage employed, but also on attributes of the
source/communicator, the audience, and the
appropriateness and strength of the argument’s
claims given the pragmatic and discourse con-
text of the argument. Among these charac-
teristics of persuasive arguments, prior work
in NLP does not explicitly investigate the ef-
fect of the pragmatic and discourse context
when determining argument quality. This pa-
per presents a new dataset to initiate the study
of this aspect of argumentation: it consists
of a diverse collection of arguments covering
741 controversial topics and comprising over
47,000 claims. We further propose predic-
tive models that incorporate the pragmatic and
discourse context of argumentative claims and
show that they outperform models that rely
only on claim-specific linguistic features for
predicting the perceived impact of individual
claims within a particular line of argument.

1 Introduction

Previous work in the social sciences and psychol-
ogy has shown that the impact and persuasive
power of an argument depends not only on the lan-
guage employed, but also on the credibility and
character of the communicator (i.e. ethos) (Miller
et al., 1976; Chaiken, 1979, 1980); the traits and
prior beliefs of the audience (G. Lord et al., 1979;
Davies, 1998; Correll et al., 2004; Hullett, 2005);
and the pragmatic context in which the argument
is presented (i.e. kairos) (Haugtvedt and Wegener,
1994; Joyce and Harwood, 2014).

Research in Natural Language Processing
(NLP) has only partially corroborated these find-
ings. One very influential line of work, for ex-
ample, develops computational methods to auto-
matically determine the linguistic characteristics

of persuasive arguments (Habernal and Gurevych,
2016; Tan et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016), but it
does so without controlling for the audience, the
communicator or the pragmatic context.

Very recent work, on the other hand, shows that
attributes of both the audience and the communi-
cator constitute important cues for determining ar-
gument strength (Lukin et al., 2017; Durmus and
Cardie, 2018). They further show that audience
and communicator attributes can influence the rel-
ative importance of linguistic features for predict-
ing the persuasiveness of an argument. These re-
sults confirm previous findings in the social sci-
ences that show a person’s perception of an argu-
ment can be influenced by his background and per-
sonality traits.

To the best of our knowledge, however, no NLP
studies explicitly investigate the role of kairos — a
component of pragmatic context that refers to the
context-dependent “timeliness” and “appropriate-
ness” of an argument and its claims within an ar-
gumentative discourse — in argument quality pre-
diction. Among the many social science studies of
attitude change, the order in which argumentative
claims are shared with the audience has been stud-
ied extensively: Haugtvedt and Wegener (1994),
for example, summarize studies showing that the
argument-related claims a person is exposed to be-
forehand can affect his perception of an alternative
argument in complex ways. Joyce and Harwood
(2014) similarly find that changes in an argument’s
context can have a big impact on the audience’s
perception of the argument.

Some recent studies in NLP have investigated
the effect of interactions on the overall persuasive
power of posts in social media (Tan et al., 2016;
Hidey and McKeown, 2018). However, in social
media not all posts have to express arguments or
stay on topic (Rakshit et al., 2017), and qualitative
evaluation of the posts can be influenced by many



5669

other factors such as interactions between the in-
dividuals (Durmus and Cardie, 2019). Therefore,
it is difficult to measure the effect of argumenta-
tive pragmatic context alone in argument quality
prediction without the effect of these confound-
ing factors using the datasets and models currently
available in this line of research.

In this paper, we study the role of kairos on ar-
gument quality prediction by examining the indi-
vidual claims of an argument for their timeliness
and appropriateness in the context of a particular
line of argument. We define kairos as the sequence
of argumentative text (e.g. claims) along a partic-
ular line of argumentative reasoning.

To start, we present a dataset extracted from
kialo.com of over 47,000 claims that are part of
a diverse collection of arguments on 741 contro-
versial topics. The structure of the website dic-
tates that each argument must present a supporting
or opposing claim for its parent claim, and stay
within the topic of the main thesis. Rather than
being posts on a social media platform, these are
community-curated claims. Furthermore, for each
presented claim, the audience votes on its impact
within the given line of reasoning. Critically then,
the dataset includes the argument context for each
claim, allowing us to investigate the characteristics
associated with impactful arguments.

With the dataset in hand, we propose the task
of studying the characteristics of impactful claims
by (1) taking the argument context into account,
(2) studying the extent to which this context is im-
portant, and (3) determining the representation of
context that is more effective. To the best of our
knowledge, ours is the first dataset that includes
claims with both impact votes and the correspond-
ing context of the argument.

2 Related Work

Recent studies in computational argumentation
have mainly focused on the tasks of identify-
ing the structure of the arguments such as argu-
ment structure parsing (Peldszus and Stede, 2015;
Park and Cardie, 2014), and argument compo-
nent classification (Habernal and Gurevych, 2017;
Mochales and Moens, 2011). More recently, there
is an increased research interest to develop com-
putational methods that can automatically evalu-
ate qualitative characteristic of arguments, such as
their impact and persuasive power (Habernal and
Gurevych, 2016; Tan et al., 2016; Kelman, 1961;

Burgoon et al., 1975; Chaiken, 1987; Tykocin-
skl et al., 1994; Dillard and Pfau, 2002; Cialdini,
2007; Durik et al., 2008; Marquart and Naderer,
2016). Consistent with findings in the social sci-
ences and psychology, some of the work in NLP
has shown that the impact and persuasive power
of the arguments are not simply related to the lin-
guistic characteristics of the language, but also
on characteristics the source (ethos) (Durmus and
Cardie, 2019) and the audience (Lukin et al., 2017;
Durmus and Cardie, 2018). These studies sug-
gest that perception of the arguments can be in-
fluenced by the credibility of the source, and the
background of the audience.

It has also been shown, in social science studies,
that kairos, which refers to the “timeliness” and
“appropropriateness” of arguments and claims, is
important to consider in studies of argument im-
pact and persuasiveness (Haugtvedt and Wegener,
1994; Joyce and Harwood, 2014). One recent
study in NLP has investigated the role of argu-
ment sequencing in argument persuasion look-
ing at (Hidey and McKeown, 2018) Change My
View1, which is a social media platform where
users post their views, and challenge other users
to present arguments in an attempt to change their
them. However, as stated in (Rakshit et al., 2017)
many posts on social media platforms either do
not express an argument, or diverge from the main
topic of conversation. Therefore, it is difficult to
measure the effect of pragmatic context in argu-
ment impact and persuasion, without confounding
factors from using noisy social media data. In con-
trast, we provide a dataset of claims along with
their structured argument path, which only con-
sists of claims and corresponds to a particular line
of reasoning for the given controversial topic. This
structure enables us to study the characteristics of
impactful claims, accounting for the effect of the
pragmatic context.

Consistent with previous findings in the social
sciences, we find that incorporating pragmatic and
discourse context is important in computational
studies of persuasion, as predictive models that
with the context representation outperform models
that only incorporate claim-specific linguistic fea-
tures, in predicting the impact of a claim. Such a
system that can predict the impact of a claim given
an argumentative discourse, for example, could
potentially be employed by argument retrieval and

generation models which aims to pick or generate
the most appropriate possible claim given the dis-
course.

3 Dataset

Claims and impact votes. We collected 47,219
claims from kialo.com23 for 741 controversial top-
ics and their corresponding impact votes. Impact
votes are provided by the users of the platform
to evaluate how impactful a particular claim is.
Users can pick one of 5 possible impact labels
for a particular claim: NO IMPACT, LOW IMPACT,
MEDIUM IMPACT, HIGH IMPACT and VERY HIGH
IMPACT. While evaluating the impact of a claim,
users have access to the full argument context and
therefore, they can assess how impactful a claim
is in the given context of an argument. An inter-
esting observation is that, in this dataset, the same
claim can have different impact labels depending
on the context in which it is presented.

Figure 1 shows a partial argument tree for
the argument thesis “PHYSICAL TORTURE OF

2The data is collected from this website in accordance
with the terms and conditions.

3There is prior work by Durmus et al. (2019) which cre-
ated a dataset of argument trees from kialo.com. That dataset,
however, does not include any impact labels.

PRISONERS IS AN ACCEPTABLE INTERROGA-
TION TOOL.”. Each node in the argument tree cor-
responds to a claim, and these argument trees are
constructed and edited collaboratively by the users
of the platform.

Except the thesis, every claim in the argument
tree either opposes or supports its parent claim.
Each path from the root to leaf nodes corresponds
to an argument path which represents a particular
line of reasoning on the given controversial topic.

Moreover, each claim has impact votes as-
signed by the users of the platform. The impact
votes evaluate how impactful a claim is within its
context, which consists of its predecessor claims
from the thesis of the tree. For example, claim O1
“IT IS MORALLY WRONG TO HARM A DEFENSE-
LESS PERSON” is an opposing claim for the thesis
and it is an IMPACTFUL CLAIM since most of its
impact votes belong to the category of VERY HIGH
IMPACT. However, claim S3 “IT IS ILLEGITI-
MATE FOR STATE ACTORS TO HARM SOMEONE

WITHOUT THE PROCESS” is a supporting claim
for its parent O1 and it is a less impactful claim
since most of the impact votes belong to the NO
IMPACT and LOW IMPACT categories.

pact votes are shown in Table 1. There are 19,512
claims in total with 3 or more votes. Out of the
claims with 3 or more votes, majority of them have
5 or more votes. We limit our study to the claims
with at least 5 votes to have a more reliable assign-
ment for the accumulated impact label for each
claim.

Impact label statistics. Table 3 shows the dis-
tribution of the number of votes for each of the
impact categories. The claims have 241, 884 total
votes. The majority of the impact votes belong to
MEDIUM IMPACT category. We observe that users
assign more HIGH IMPACT and VERY HIGH IM-
PACT votes than LOW IMPACT and NO IMPACT
votes respectively. When we restrict the claims
to the ones with at least 5 impact votes, we have
213, 277 votes in total4.

Agreement for the impact votes. To determine
the agreement in assigning the impact label for a
particular claim, for each claim, we compute the
percentage of the votes that are the same as the
majority impact vote for that claim. Let ci denote
the count of the claims with the class labels C=[NO
IMPACT, LOW IMPACT, MEDIUM IMPACT, HIGH
IMPACT, VERY HIGH IMPACT] for the impact label
l at index i.

Agreement = 100 ∗ max0≤i≤4 ci∑4

For example, for claim S1 in Figure 1, the
agreement score is 100 ∗ 3090% = 33.33% since
the majority class (NO IMPACT) has 30 votes and
there are 90 impact votes in total for this partic-
ular claim. We compute the agreement score for

426,998 of them NO IMPACT, 33,789 of them LOW IM-
PACT, 55,616 of them MEDIUM IMPACT, 47,494 of them
HIGH IMPACT and 49,380 of them VERY HIGH IMPACT.

the cases where (1) we treat each impact label
separately (5-class case) and (2) we combine the
classes HIGH IMPACT and VERY HIGH IMPACT
into a one class: IMPACTFUL and NO IMPACT and
LOW IMPACT into a one class: NOT IMPACTFUL
(3-class case).

Table 2 shows the number of claims with the
given agreement score thresholds when we include
the claims with at least 5 votes. We see that
when we combine the low impact and high impact
classes, there are more claims with high agreement
score. This may imply that distinguishing between
no impact-low impact and high impact-very high
impact classes is difficult. To decrease the sparsity
issue, in our experiments, we use 3-class repre-
sentation for the impact labels. Moreover, to have
a more reliable assignment of impact labels, we
consider only the claims with have more than 60%
agreement.

Context. In an argument tree, the claims from
the thesis node (root) to each leaf node, form an ar-
gument path. This argument path represents a par-
ticular line of reasoning for the given thesis. Sim-
ilarly, for each claim, all the claims along the path
from the thesis to the claim, represent the context
for the claim. For example, in Figure 1, the con-
text for O1 consists of only the thesis, whereas the
context for S3 consists of both the thesis and O1
since S3 is provided to support the claim O1 which
is an opposing claim for the thesis.

The claims are not constructed independently
from their context since they are written in consid-
eration with the line of reasoning so far. In most
cases, each claim elaborates on the point made by
its parent and presents cases to support or oppose
the parent claim’s points. Similarly, when users
evaluate the impact of a claim, they consider if
the claim is timely and appropriate given its con-
text. There are cases in the dataset where the same
claim has different impact labels, when presented
within a different context. Therefore, we claim
that it is not sufficient to only study the linguistic
characteristic of a claim to determine its impact,
but it is also necessary to consider its context in
determining the impact.

Context length (Cl) for a particular claim C is
defined by number of claims included in the argu-
ment path starting from the thesis until the claim
C. For example, in Figure 1, the context length for
O1 and S3 are 1 and 2 respectively. Table 4 shows
number of claims with the given range of con-

and 5-class cases. When we combine the low impact and high impact classes, there are more claims with high

4 Methodology

4.1 Hypothesis and Task Description

Similar to prior work, our aim is to understand the
characteristics of impactful claims in argumenta-
tion. However, we hypothesize that the qualitative
characteristics of arguments is not independent of
the context in which they are presented. To under-
stand the relationship between argument context
and the impact of a claim, we aim to incorporate
the context along with the claim itself in our pre-
dictive models.

Prediction task. Given a claim, we want to pre-
dict the impact label that is assigned to it by the
users: NOT IMPACTFUL, MEDIUM IMPACT, or IM-
PACTFUL.

Preprocessing. We restrict our study to claims
with at least 5 or more votes and greater than 60%
agreement, to have a reliable impact label assign-
ment. We have 7, 386 claims in the dataset satis-
fying these constraints5. We see that the impact
class IMPACFUL is the majority class since around
58% of the claims belong to this category.

For our experiments, we split our data to train
(70%), validation (15%) and test (15%) sets.

4.2 Baseline Models

4.2.1 Majority

The majority baseline assigns the most common
label of the training examples (HIGH IMPACT) to
every test example.

4.2.2 SVM with RBF kernel

Similar to (Habernal and Gurevych, 2016), we ex-
periment with SVM with RBF kernel, with fea-
tures that represent (1) the simple characteristics
of the argument tree and (2) the linguistic charac-
teristics of the claim.

The features that represent the simple character-
istics of the claim’s argument tree include the dis-
tance and similarity of the claim to the thesis, the
similarity of a claim with its parent, and the im-
pact votes of the claim’s parent claim. We encode
the similarity of a claim to its parent and the thesis
claim with the cosine similarity of their tf-idf vec-
tors. The distance and similarity metrics aim to
model whether claims which are more similar (i.e.
potentially more topically relevant) to their parent
claim or the thesis claim, are more impactful.

5We have 1,633 NOT IMPACTFUL, 1,445 MEDIUM IM-
PACT and 4,308 IMPACFUL claims.



5673

We encode the quality of the parent claim as the
number of votes for each impact class, and incor-
porate it as a feature to understand if it is more
likely for a claim to impactful given an impactful
parent claim.

Linguistic features. To represent each claim,
we extracted the linguistic features proposed by
(Habernal and Gurevych, 2016) such as tf-idf
scores for unigrams and bigrams, ratio of quo-
tation marks, exclamation marks, modal verbs,
stop words, type-token ratio, hedging (Hyland,
1998), named entity types, POS n-grams, sen-
timent (Hutto and Gilbert, 2014) and subjectiv-
ity scores (Wilson et al., 2005), spell-checking,
readibility features such as Coleman-Liau (Cole-
man and Liau, 1975), Flesch (Flesch, 1948), argu-
ment lexicon features (Somasundaran et al., 2007)
and surface features such as word lengths, sen-
tence lengths, word types, and number of complex
words6.

4.2.3 FastText
Joulin et al. (2017) introduced a simple, yet ef-
fective baseline for text classification, which they
show to be competitive with deep learning classi-
fiers in terms of accuracy. Their method represents
a sequence of text as a bag of n-grams, and each
n-gram is passed through a look-up table to get its
dense vector representation. The overall sequence
representation is simply an average over the dense
representations of the bag of n-grams, and is fed
into a linear classifier to predict the label. We use
the code released by Joulin et al. (2017) to train
a classifier for argument impact prediction, based
on the claim text7.

4.2.4 BiLSTM with Attention
Another effective baseline (Zhou et al., 2016;
Yang et al., 2016) for text classification consists of
encoding the text sequence using a bidirectional
Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter
and Schmidhuber, 1997), to get the token repre-
sentations in context, and then attending (Luong
et al., 2015) over the tokens to get the sequence
representation. For the query vector for atten-
tion, we use a learned context vector, similar to

6 We pick the parameters for SVM model according to the
performance validation split, and report the results on the test
split.

7We used maxNgram legnth of 2, learning rate of 0.8, num
epochs of 15, vector dim of 300. We also used the pre-trained
300-dim wiki-news vectors made available on the fastText
website.

Yang et al. (2016). We picked our hyperparam-
eters based on performance on the validation set,
and report our results for the best set of hyperpa-
rameters8. We initialized our word embeddings
with glove vectors (Pennington et al., 2014) pre-
trained on Wikipedia + Gigaword, and used the
Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2015) with its
default settings.

4.3 Fine-tuned BERT model

Devlin et al. (2018) fine-tuned a pre-trained deep
bi-directional transformer language model (which
they call BERT), by adding a simple classifica-
tion layer on top, and achieved state of the art re-
sults across a variety of NLP tasks. We employ
their pre-trained language models for our task and
compare it to our baseline models. For all the
architectures described below, we finetune for 10
epochs, with a learning rate of 2e-5. We employ
an early stopping procedure based on the model
performance on a validation set.

4.3.1 Claim with no context
In this setting, we attempt to classify the impact
of the claim, based on the text of the claim only.
We follow the fine-tuning procedure for sequence
classification detailed in (Devlin et al., 2018), and
input the claim text as a sequence of tokens pre-
ceded by the special [CLS] token and followed
by the special [SEP] token. We add a classifica-
tion layer on top of the BERT encoder, to which
we pass the representation of the [CLS] token, and
fine-tune this for argument impact prediction.

4.3.2 Claim with parent representation
In this setting, we use the parent claim’s text, in
addition to the target claim text, in order to clas-
sify the impact of the target claim. We treat this as
a sequence pair classification task, and combine
both the target claim and parent claim as a single
sequence of tokens, separated by the special sep-
arator [SEP]. We then follow the same procedure
above, for fine-tuning.

4.3.3 Incorporating larger context
In this setting, we consider incorporating a larger
context from the discourse, in order to assess the
impact of a claim. In particular, we consider up

8Our final hyperparams were: 100-dim word embed-
ding, 100-dim context vector, 1 layer BiLSTM with 64 units,
trained for 40 epochs with early stopping based on validation
performance.

to four previous claims in the discourse (for a to-
tal context length of 5). We attempt to incorporate
larger context into the BERT model in three differ-
ent ways.

Flat representation of the path. The first, sim-
ple approach is to represent the entire path (claim
+ context) as a single sequence, where each of the
claims is separated by the [SEP] token. BERT
was trained on sequence pairs, and therefore the
pre-trained encoders only have two segment em-
beddings (Devlin et al., 2018). So to fit multiple
sequences into this framework, we indicate all to-
kens of the target claim as belonging to segment
A and the tokens for all the claims in the dis-
course context as belonging to segment B. This
way of representing the input, requires no addi-
tional changes to the architecture or retraining,
and we can just finetune in a similar manner as
above. We refer to this representation of the con-
text as a flat representation, and denote the model
as Contextf (i), where i indicates the length of the
context that is incorporated into the model.

Attention over context. Recent work in incor-
porating argument sequence in predicting persua-
siveness (Hidey and McKeown, 2018) has shown
that hierarchical representations are effective in
representing context. Similarly, we consider hi-
erarchical representations for representing the dis-
course. We first encode each claim using the pre-
trained BERT model as the claim encoder, and use

the representation of the [CLS] token as claim rep-
resentation. We then employ dot-product attention
(Luong et al., 2015), to get a weighted representa-
tion for the context. We use a learned context vec-
tor as the query, for computing attention scores,
similar to Yang et al. (2016). The attention score
αc is computed as shown below:

αc =
exp(V Tc Vl)∑
c∈D exp(V

T
c Vl)

(2)

Where Vc is the claim representation that was
computed with the BERT encoder as described
above, Vl is the learned context vector that is used
for computing attention scores, and D is the set of
claims in the discourse. After computing the at-
tention scores, the final context representation vd
is computed as follows:

Vd =
∑
c∈D

αcVc (3)

We then concatenate the context representation
with the target claim representation [Vd, Vr] and
pass it to the classification layer to predict the
quality. We denote this model as Contexta(i).

GRU to encode context Similar to the ap-
proach above, we consider a hierarchical represen-
tation for representing the context. We compute
the claim representations, as detailed above, and
we then feed the discourse claims’ representations
(in sequence) into a bidirectional Gated Recurrent

5 Results and Analysis

Table 5 shows the macro precision, recall and F1
scores for the baselines as well as the BERT mod-
els with and without context representations9.

We see that parent quality is a simple yet ef-
fective feature and SVM model with this feature
can achieve significantly higher (p < 0.001)10

F1 score (46.61%) than distance from the thesis
and linguistic features. Claims with higher impact
parents are more likely to be have higher impact.
Similarity with the parent and thesis is not signifi-
cantly better than the majority baseline. Although
the BiLSTM model with attention and FastText
baselines performs better than the SVM with dis-
tance from the thesis and linguistic features, it has
similar performance to the parent quality baseline.

We find that the BERT model with claim only
representation performs significantly better (p <
0.001) than the baseline models. Incorporating the
parent representation only along with the claim
representation does not give significant improve-
ment over representing the claim only. However,
incorporating the flat representation of the larger
context along with the claim representation con-
sistently achieves significantly better (p < 0.001)
performance than the claim representation alone.
Similarly, attention representation over the con-
text with the learned query vector achieves signifi-
cantly better performance then the claim represen-
tation only (p < 0.05).

We find that the flat representation of the con-

ent random seed, we run them 5 times and report the mean

text achieves the highest F1 score. It may be more
difficult for the models with a larger number of
parameters to perform better than the flat repre-
sentation since the dataset is small. We also ob-
serve that modeling 3 claims on the argument path
before the target claim achieves the best F1 score
(55.98%).

To understand for what kinds of claims the best
performing contextual model is more effective, we
evaluate the BERT model with flat context rep-
resentation for claims with context length values
1, 2, 3 and 4 separately. Table 6 shows the F1
score of the BERT model without context and with
flat context representation with different lengths
of context. For the claims with context length 1,
adding Contextf (3) and Contextf (4) representa-
tion along with the claim achieves significantly
better (p < 0.05) F1 score than modeling the
claim only. Similarly for the claims with con-
text length 3 and 4, Contextf (4) and Contextf (3)
perform significantly better than BERT with claim
only ((p < 0.05) and (p < 0.01) respectively).
We see that models with larger context are helpful
even for claims which have limited context (e.g.
Cl = 1). This may suggest that when we train
the models with larger context, they learn how to
represent the claims and their context better.

6 Conclusion

In this paper, we present a dataset of claims with
their corresponding impact votes, and investigate
the role of argumentative discourse context in ar-
gument impact classification. We experiment with
various models to represent the claims and their
context and find that incorporating the context in-
formation gives significant improvement in pre-
dicting argument impact. In our study, we find that
flat representation of the context gives the best im-
provement in the performance and our analysis in-
dicates that the contextual models perform better
even for the claims with limited context.
