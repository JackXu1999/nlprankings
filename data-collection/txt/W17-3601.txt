Abstract

Deliberation is an increasingly used concept in
Argumentation Theory and Linguistic Analy-
sis. But only recently research combined em-
pirical and conceptual tool-boxes from these
disciplines for the study of deliberative dis-
course. The aim of this article is to present a
discursive analysis of deliberation as a genre
using the relational discourse structure of
texts. In particular, we want to see whether
different features of deliberation genre map
onto relational discourse structures of texts.To
do so, authors analyze, in the framework of
Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST), the rela-
tional discourse structure of a Basque-Spanish
bilingual corpus of argumentative micro-texts
written by citizens participating in a series of
deliberative mini-publics. Results suggest that
genre affects the relational discourse struc-
tures of texts and that we could analyze this ef-
fect in RST. Finally, we present, to our knowl-
edge, the first annotated corpus-based genre
analysis of the relational discourse structure of
argumentative micro-texts (available online)
with RST.

1 Introduction

Deliberation is an increasingly used concept in Ar-
gumentation Theory (Fairclough and Fairclough,
2013; van Eemeren, 2013). Argumentation Theory
analyses deliberation as a genre, meaning discourse
that is goal oriented, unfolds through stages and be-
longs to a discourse community (Bhatia, 2004). But
only recently researches (Collins and Nerlich, 2015;
Murray et al., 2013) focused on the linguistic analy-
sis of deliberation as a genre.

The aim of this article is to present a discourse
analysis of deliberation as a genre through the
rhetorical structure of texts. We want to see whether
the relational discourse structure of texts is influ-
enced by different variables linking text to con-
text: i) cultural variables (language) shaping the lin-
guistic context of text (micro-context), ii) institu-
tional design-choices (group composition) that fea-
ture the particular setting in which deliberation oc-
curs (meso-context) and iii) stages of deliberation
(macro-context). For Deliberative Democratic The-
ory and Argumentation Theory these three variables
are relevant and affect the capacity of deliberation to
achieve its purpose.

To do so, authors analyze the relational discourse
structure of a Basque-Spanish bilingual corpus of ar-
gumentative micro-texts written by citizens partic-
ipating in a series of deliberative mini-publics, in
the framework of Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST)
(Mann and Thompson, 1988).

Results suggest that the relational discourse struc-
ture of texts can be affected by the stage of discus-
sion and design-choices, but not by the language of
the participants.

Finally, we present, to our knowledge, the first
annotated corpus-based genre analysis of the rela-
tional discourse structure of argumentative micro-
texts (available online1) with RST, in which dis-
course structures map onto deliberative dialogues.
The time-cost of manual analysis in the RST frame-
work limits the size of the corpus and the scope
for application of this method. But advances have

2 Theoretical Framework: Deliberation as
an Argumentation Genre

Argumentation is broadly defined here as the pro-
cess through which people seek to reach conclu-
sions through reasons (Fischer, 2012). Delibera-
tion, on the other hand, is defined as a particular
form of argumentation procedurally regulated by an
ideal model, so that conclusions are reached only
by the force of the better argument (Steiner, 2012).
Both concepts testify for long and fruitful theoreti-
cal traditions: Argumentation Theory and Deliber-
ative Democracy. Nevertheless, only recently they
converged on the idea that deliberation is an argu-
mentation ‘genre’ (Van Eemeren, 2016; Walton et
al., 2014; Fairclough and Fairclough, 2013).

From the perspective of discourse studies, the key
concept linking language and discourse is ‘genre’
(Miller, 1984). Genre entails that texts are goal-
oriented, involve stages and both influence linguis-
tic choices. First, texts are goal-oriented because
genre defines texts as communicative events geared
to shared purposes in different discourse communi-
ties (Swales, 1990). Second, genre involves stages,
because to accomplish shared purposes communica-
tive events are structured in series of functional
steps. Finally, Taboada (2004) suggests that genre is
realized at the text level and it determines its struc-
tural organization.

In this paper, text analysis will follow basic guide-
lines from Taboada (2004, p. 29-36). According to
her, genre analysis involves: i) finding a structural
formula that will represent instances of a genre and
ii) analyzing their linguistic characteristics2.

To complete the first task, we follow conventions
from Argumentation Theory and, to complete the
second task, we follow conventions from Rhetorical
Structure Theory.

2It is specified step by step as follows: i) Identification of
segments or series of segments; ii) Definition of the social pur-
pose; iii) Functional labeling of stages; iv) Specify obligatory
and optional stages; v) Devise a structural formula; vi) An-
alyze the semantic and lexical-grammatical features for each
stage (Taboada, 2004, p. 36)

2.1 Deliberation Genre in Argumentation
Theory

Texts in the corpus are contributions written by citi-
zens in a deliberative mini-public.

The institutional point or shared purpose of politi-
cal deliberation is “preserving the democratic politi-
cal culture by means of deliberation” (van Eemeren,
2013, p. 27). Indeed, organizers made this purpose
explicit in The Konpondu Initiative. For example,
the presentation leaflet underlines that it was moti-
vated by the commitment of political representatives
to build peace and contribute to political normaliza-
tion. And it adds “the opinion of society, of people
like you, is a fundamental contribution to that end”.3

Moreover, the invitation letter4 established as rule
‘mutual respect’; the central aspect of deliberation
from the perspective of Argumentation Theory.

To accomplish this general purpose, the ideal tem-
plate of deliberation defines seven different stages
(McBurney et al., 2007, p.6).5 Nevertheless, this
template should be adapted to real circumstances
(Fairclough, 2016; Van Eemeren, 2016). In our case,
texts collected inform over the Opening stage, or
the question posed by the moderator. An Inform-
Propose stage where citizen inform over their goals
and perspectives and suggest possible courses of ac-
tion. Next, a Consider stage where citizens consider
a proposal placed by the moderator. To conclude,
a Revise stage where proposals are accepted or re-
jected.

Finally, to advance towards the shared purpose
citizens participating in a deliberative event are ex-
pected to fulfill a ‘deliberative minimum’ (Fair-
clough, 2016). In short, the ideal model of delib-
erative argumentation requires minimally “weighing
reasons in favor of a claim against reasons against it
(reasons supporting the counter-claim), or balancing
each argument against a counter-argument” (Fair-

5Deliberation dialogue begins with an open question (Open-
ing), followed by discussion on goals, constraints and perspec-
tives (Inform), next proposals are placed (Propose), jointly con-
sidered (Consider), accepted or rejected (Revise) and an op-
tion is recommend (Recommend) before deliberation dialogue
is closed (Conclude).

clough and Fairclough, 2013, p. 50).

2.2 Argumentative Discourse in RST
Regarding the linguistic characteristics of deliber-
ation genre, Taboada suggests that genre analysis
should focus on variations as realized in the in-
formation structure (rhetorical relations), thematic
structure (realization and progression) and cohe-
sive structure (chains) of a text in its social and
communicative context. Indeed, according to her,
the relevant level of genre analysis is more textual
than lexical-grammatical6 (Taboada, 2004, p. 29-
32). Our research focuses on one of those aspects in
particular: the relational discourse structure. Coher-
ence relations reflect the relational discourse struc-
ture of texts and could be analyzed with RST.

RST is an approach in which an analyst describes
coherence between text fragments. To describe co-
herence, the analyst combines three main concepts:
a) Elementary Discourse Units (EDU, henceforth)
are independent or adverbial clauses. b) Recursive
coherent relations between text fragments that have
different effects on the reader: pragmatic or presen-
tational relations and semantic or subject matter re-
lations. As relations are recursive, a coherence rela-
tion can be a text fragment of other relation. c) Nu-
clearity, that is, the importance of a text fragment
within the relation. Guided by the text, the analyst
can describe which fragments are more important in
the coherence relation (nucleus or satellite function)
and also to other EDUs (central unit of a text).

Finally, we cluster coherence relations follow-
ing Benamara and Taboada (2015) as Temporal,
Thematic, Structural and Argumentative. The Ar-
gumentative Opposition subclass includes coher-
ence relations that fulfill “the role of the classical
thesis-antithesis structure.” (Taboada and Gómez-
González, 2012, p.35) Therefore, we take the ar-
gumentative opposition subclass to represent the
‘deliberative minimum’ in the relational discourse
structures of texts in our corpus.

3 Methodology

The annotation of the corpus follows basic guide-
lines of RST implemented in the “Multilingual Dis-

the realization of the three meta-functions in language are more
closely related to register than they are to genre.

course TreeBank” (Iruskieta et al., 2015a). We will
classify texts in regards to coherence relation classes
conforming their relational discourse structure (Be-
namara and Taboada, 2015). Finally, we will statisti-
cally analyze whether different contextual variables
(relevant for the genre of deliberation) affect the re-
lational discourse structure of texts in our corpus.

3.1 Corpus

Texts in the corpus are contributions made by citi-
zens in a deliberative exercise named The Konpondu
Initiative7. This initiative was held by the Basque
Autonomous Government between 2007 and 2009
to foster citizens’ participation in the resolution of
the Basque conflict8. Texts are argumentative micro-
texts written by participants to assist their oral pre-
sentations. In short, they are fixed snapshots of dif-
ferent stages of the deliberative dialogue that took
place in The Konpondu Initiative.

Mini-publics could be divided into two different
phases depending on their structure. In the first
phase, participants were called to express their opin-
ion in response to a trigger question9 placed by the
moderator, at the beginning of the exercise. Besides,
participants were invited to reflect on the most in-
teresting contributions made by others. In the sec-
ond phase, the first question10 was more precise;
it asked participants to underline different aspects
(risks/opportunities/doubts). And, in addition to the
concluding round, a direct question11 on the Consul-
tation Law (Keating and Bray, 2006) was introduced
in the middle of the exercise.

The complete set is composed of 2,850 plain texts
ordered by language, group composition, stage of

dakaria Center, Aitziber Blanco and Paul Rios from Lokarri,
Jorge de la Herran from Agora and Igor Ahedo and Asier Blas
from Parte-Hartuz (EHU) for helping us recollecting the docu-
mentation of The Konpondu Initiative.

8The initiative provided support for citizens participation via
citizen fora held in 101 municipalities (162 fora), the diaspora
(28 fora), the University (6 fora) and the youth council (6 fora),
as well as a web fora (konpondu.net) where more than 20,000
comments were collected and over 1,000,000 hits documented

the corpus we present here is a selection of 200 texts
using length as a general criterion, to capture those
with denser discourse relational structures. We built
a comparable set for both languages considering dif-
ferent stages of discussion and group-compositions.

3.2 Annotation, Evaluation and Classification

We annotated this Argumentative Basque-Spanish
Treebank following the standard methodology in
RST. We evaluated the reliability of the corpus
following a two step process, first, implementing
a qualitative evaluation method (Iruskieta et al.,
2015a) and, second, by comparing RS-trees an-
notated by each annotator using the on-line freely
available tool RSTeval (Maziero et al., 2009).12

Firstly, a novel annotator (A1) annotated
some texts in both languages with the RSTTool
(O’Donnell, 2000), following the standard way to
annotate in RST: segmenting the text and, then,
building the RS-tree modularly and incrementally
(Pardo, 2005).

Secondly, a RST analyst (A2) annotated 20 texts
(10 in Spanish and 10 in Basque) following the same
methodology.

Thirdly, we compared RS-trees of A1 and A2 fol-
lowing a qualitative evaluation method proposed by
(Iruskieta et al., 2015a) in two ways: a) with the
extended set of RST relations and b) comparing a
collapsed set of RST relations.

Fourthly, both annotators agreed on ideal tem-
plates or macro-structures on a case by cases basis.
The annotation of the corpus was recomposed and,
based on harmonized RS-trees, the annotation of re-
lations was validated using RSTeval.

Fifthly, all the annotation data was automati-
cally enriched morphosyntactically (lemmatized and
POS-tagged) with Eustagger (Aduriz et al., 2003)
for Basque and FreeLing (Carreras et al., 2004)

for Spanish and it was exported to a database and
showed in a friendly web-service environment using
some tools developed in Iruskieta et al. (2015b).

Finally, coherence relations were clustered in
classes following Benamara and Taboada (2015) and
texts classified by their relational discourse structure
and formatted for statistical analysis.

3.2.1 Discourse Segmentation and Central Unit
annotation

Example (1) is a text selected from our Basque cor-
pus (translations are ours), to explain the segmenta-
tion and central unit detection tasks. We segmented
the text manually into Elementary Discourse Units
(EDUs) following Iruskieta et al. (2015b). EDUs are
independent sentences and adverbial clauses. The
decision to segment manually was taken because
texts were written by citizens; meaning they are full
of grammatical mistakes (and a lot verbal ellipsis)
and automatic segmentation will loose some EDUs
(and therefore relations in subsequent phases) and
produce more errors.

After segmentation, we have annotated the main
topic of the text or the most important idea of the
citizen. This EDU will be the central unit of the
RS-tree in the following annotation task15. In this

text, we think that the most important sentence of
the three is composed of segments 2 to 5 and if we
put off all the adverbial clauses of this example, the
main EDU is in bold type (EDU3).

3.2.2 Annotation and Evaluation of Rhetorical
Relations

After determining the main topic of the text, as seen
in the Example 2, one annotator has labeled the en-
tire corpus, and a part of the corpus was double an-
notated (A1 and A2) to measure the inter-annotator
agreement.

(2) ANTITHESIS (s (“1”), n (INTERPRETA-
TION (n (CIRCUMSTANCE (s (“2”), n
(PURPOSE (n (“3”), s (SEQUENCE (n
(“4”), n (“5”))))))), s (CONCESSION (s
(“6”), n (PURPOSE (n (“7”), s (“8”))))))))
[FIL965-2-83-EUS]

We evaluated the most difficult task of the rhetor-
ical annotation, which is the relation labeling in re-
gards to RST extended and collapsed relation-sets.
Results of the qualitative evaluation revealed low
(30%) and moderate (46%) inter-coder agreement
subsequently for extended and collapsed relation-
sets. The comparative analysis showed differences
regarding central unit and nuclearity explaining, par-
tially, low agreement. In short, the interpretation
was not very different, but annotators formalized
trees in different ways.

We tried that to reduce the ambivalence of inter-
pretations harmonizing the macro-structures of RS-
trees at each stage, and we realized we had to change
some decisions taken to build the corpus. Initially,
we analyzed texts responding to different aspects of
the same question as independent text-units16. For
example, we differentiated as independent text-units
texts underlining ‘problems’ and ‘opportunities’ in
response to the same question. But taken together
we found most texts at this stage were structured
with a central claim and a satellite of a SOLUTION-
HOOD relation. This approach diminished the am-
bivalence of interpretation between annotators in re-
gards to central unit detection and, correspondingly,

16The reason to take that decision was that in the original
reports those aspects of citizens’ responses were written sepa-
rately.

tion labeling.

After a training session for the novel annotator,
we recomposed the corpus following new guidelines
and re-annotated it.

Finally, taking harmonized RS-trees based on
macro-structural templates as a departure point for
the annotation of texts at each stage of discussion,
we re-annotated a sample of the original corpus
and measured inter-coder agreement using the freely
available on-line tool RSTeval (Table 2).

3.2.3 Text Classification, Cluster relations and
Statistical Analysis

At the end, we were able to classify each text ac-
cording to i) stage (1st and 2nd phase and ini-
tial (Inform/Propose), middle (Consider) or final
stage (Revise)), ii) language (Basque or Spanish)
and iii) group composition (linguistically heteroge-
neous or homogeneous)17.

To answer our research questions, we classify co-
herence relations18 in classes according to the tax-
onomy presented by Benamara and Taboada (2015)
as follows: a) Temporal class19. b) Structuring class
20. c) Thematic class is further divided in two sub-

Deschouwer, 2014).

relations as, for example, topic-comment SDRT relations. In
this case, we have used it to classify only relations annotated in
our corpus.

Finally, to get the most informative approxima-
tion possible we cluster relations at the lower level
of the hierarchy of each class and we order classes
from less argumentative (Structuring) to more argu-
mentative (Argumentative Opposition) in the light of
the ‘deliberative minimum’27. We test for high cor-
relation among our independent variables exclud-
ing multicollinearity, and we make an ordinal logis-
tic regression taking relation class as our dependent
variable and stage, group-composition and language
as our independent variables.

In Table 3 we summarize the type and the fre-
quency of each relation per subclass, group compo-
sition, and language. At first sight, we could see
that, except for texts written in Basque in hetero-
geneous groups, each column follows the same or-

ral). Within classes, there are more Elaborative rela-
tions than Framing relations and more Argumenta-
tive than Causal.

In Table 4 we have dichotomized argumentative
and non-argumentative classes per phase. Results
show that, contrary to our expectations, the bal-
ance between argumentative and non-argumentative
classes only differs slightly through stages within
the same phase. But, it is interesting to see that there
are differences if we compare both phases: in the
first phase we find more non-argumentative class re-
lations but, in the second phase, argumentative class
relations score higher than in the first.

In response to our research questions, the Tests of
Model Effects (Table 5) show that the stage of dis-
cussion and the composition of the group have a sig-
nificant effect on the prediction of whether texts will
be more argumentative. On the contrary, language
has not a statistically significant effect.

To get a more detailed approximation of the di-
rectionality and size of these effects, we summarize
main results of the ordinal logistic regression in Ta-
ble 6.

guage has an effect on the relational discourse struc-
ture of texts. Results show that the odds of texts
written in Spanish being more argumentative are al-
most equal in comparison to those written in Basque.
Therefore, language does not have a statistically sig-
nificant effect on the degree of argumentativeness of
texts in our corpus.

Our second research question asks whether the
composition of the group has an effect on the rela-
tional discourse structure of texts. In this case, re-
sults show that the odds of texts being more argu-
mentative are slightly higher (1.195; 95% CI, 1.039
to 1.374) in linguistically heterogeneous groups
than in homogeneous groups. The difference is
rather small, but the effect is statistically significant
(x2(1)=6.245, p=.012).

Finally, stages of discussion have an effect on the
relational discourse structure of texts in our corpus,
but this effect is statistically significant only of both
stages in the first phase.

In the second phase, results show that the odds
of the relational discourse structure of texts being
more argumentative are similar at any stage of dis-
cussion. It is slightly lower at the Inform stage, but
not significantly. On the contrary, at any stage in the
first phase, the odds of the relational discourse struc-
ture of texts being more argumentative are lower in
comparison to our reference category. This result is
especially interesting because the question was the
same at both phases, and we used the same macro-
structural template.

In this case, the odds of texts in the Revise stage
in the first phase being more argumentative are half
(.555; 95% CI, .420 to .733) that of those in the same
stage in the second phase, a statistically significant

effect, x2(1)=17.142, p<.001.
In sum, results show that the stage of discussion

and the composition of the group have an effect on
the relational discourse structure of texts in our cor-
pus, but not the language. The odds ratios of being
more argumentative are higher in the second phase
and in linguistically heterogeneous groups. The size
of this effect is greater for stages but rather small of
group composition. These results may suggest the
relational structures of these texts have common pat-
terns associated with their genre. But further analy-
sis is necessary, for example, including other vari-
ables or comparison to other genres.

This research builds on previous attempts to analyze
argumentation using RST.

Azar (1999) was first to propose RST as an al-
ternative to the so-called “Toulmin Model” (Toul-
min, 1958) for the analysis of argumentation. He
used the satellite-nucleus distinction to identify ar-
guments and conclusions for five types of relations:
EVIDENCE, ANTITHESIS and CONCESSION (per-
suader), JUSTIFY (justifier), and MOTIVATION (in-
centive).

More recently, Green (2010; 2015), suggested the
“Toulmin model” is more appropriate, but she out-
lined a proposal (ArgRST) where data and claim
of an argument are represented respectively as the
satellite and nucleus of an RS-tree.

Texts in our corpus are similar to the ‘Postdam
Corpus’ (Peldszus and Stede, 2016; Stede et al.,
2016) composed of 112 argumentative micro-texts
written in response to trigger questions aimed at get-
ting argumentatively dense texts. Authors conduct a

parallel annotation using different methods for the
analysis of discourse structures —Segmented Dis-
course Representation Theory (SDRT) and Rhetor-
ical Structure Theory (RST)— and argumentation
schemes (Freeman, 2011).

On the other hand, Hirst et al. (2014) combine lin-
guistically enriched RST parsing based on HILDA
discourse parser, and content analysis to analyze ar-
gumentation in political speech. They applied their
model to the analysis of issue framing and ideologi-
cal position in historical and contemporary proceed-
ings of British, Canadian and Dutch parliaments.

These studies (Hirst et al., 2014; Stede et al.,
2016) share that, despite limitations (Biran and
Rambow, 2011), rhetorical structures can be con-
sidered appropriate for the analysis of the discourse
structure of argumentative texts. But, they invite
to the parallel annotation of argumentation schemes
and relational discourse structures to enhance their
translatability.

Regarding the analysis of argumentation in
Basque and Spanish using RST, previous research
shows that the nucleus of a rhetorical tree can
be seen as the central claim of an argumentation
scheme (Iruskieta et al., 2014). Moreover, promis-
ing advances have been made regarding automatic
segmentation for Spanish28 and Basque29 (Iruskieta
and Zapirain, 2015), central unit detection30 (Ben-
goetxea et al., 2017) and causal coherence relation
annotation in the baseline hierarchical level of the
RS-tree (Kortajarena, 2016).

6 Conclusions and future work

First, in this paper, we report the creation of a
Basque-Spanish bilingual corpus composed by 200
argumentative micro-texts. We have annotated the
corpus following usual standards of RST and results
are freely available for further analysis in an online
database31. To our knowledge, this is the first genre

analysis of the relational discourse structure of texts
applied to deliberative discourse.

Second, the analysis of relation classes has shown
that the composition of the group and stages of dis-
cussion significantly affect the relational discourse
structure of texts. Indeed, texts from groups with
participants from different linguistic communities
and more controversial questions ruling discussion
are closer to the ‘deliberative minimum.’

Finally, besides statistically significant differ-
ences and given the small size of effects, we could
also suggest there are common patterns. Therefore,
it is interesting for future research to see whether
these patterns are unique and, therefore, genre re-
lated or common to other corpora from different
genres.

Further steps will follow recommendations re-
garding parallel annotation of RS-trees and argu-
mentation schemes (Stede et al., 2016). We will also
linguistically enrich the annotation signaling Dis-
course Relational Devices following (2013).
