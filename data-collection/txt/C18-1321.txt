Abstract

Current paper explores the use of multi-view learning for search result clustering. A web-snippet
can be represented using multiple views. Apart from textual view cued by both the semantic
and syntactic information, a complementary view extracted from images contained in the web-
snippets is also utilized in the current framework. A single consensus partitioning is finally ob-
tained after consulting these two individual views by the deployment of a multi-objective based
clustering technique. Several objective functions including the values of a cluster quality mea-
sure evaluating the goodness of partitionings obtained using different views and an agreement-
disagreement index, quantifying the amount of oneness among multiple views in generating par-
titionings are optimized simultaneously using AMOSA. In order to detect the number of clusters
automatically, concepts of variable length solutions and a vast range of permutation operators
are introduced in the clustering process. Finally a set of alternative partitionings are obtained on
the final Pareto front by the proposed multi-view based multi-objective technique. Experimental
results by the proposed approach on several bench-mark test datasets with respect to different
performance metrics evidently establish the power of visual and text based views in achieving
better search result clustering.

1 Introduction

Web search results clustering (SRC), also known as ephemeral clustering or post-retrieval clustering has
garnered much attention in the past few decades for making web browsing easier for users. The key
objective of SRC systems is: for a given query it can return some meaningful labeled clusters from a
set of web documents (or web snippets) retrieved from a search engine. Recent years have witnessed
a large number of attempts in solving this SRC problem (Di Marco and Navigli, 2013; Scaiella et al.,
2012). Most of them have developed some clustering algorithms optimizing a single objective criteria
(Osinski and Weiss, 2005; Zamir and Etzioni, 1998; Moreno et al., 2013). But a complex data set
like set of web-snippets can be clustered into several alternative partitionings. Therefore to detect all
possible partitionings containing clusters of different shapes automatically, application of multiobjective
optimization (MOO) for solving the problem of clustering becomes prevalent (Maulik et al., 2011). In
this context, Acharya et al. (Acharya et al., 2014) have proposed a multi objective optimization based
approach for solving SRC problem by extracting both semantic and syntactic information present in
web-snippets. Results attained by this approach outperformed the other existing single objective based
approaches. Moreover a web-snippet can be represented using different views, for example semantic
view, syntactic view. Recently, Wahid et al. (Wahid et al., 2014) have developed a multi-view based
MOO clustering technique for search result clustering where multiple views are consulted for developing
a consensus partitioning of available web-snippets.

Multimodal approaches have gained increased attention over the past few years. These models have
been used in various applications: image captioning (You et al., 2016); sentiment analysis (Poria et al.,

2016); multimodal machine translation (Specia et al., 2016); visual question answering (Antol et al.,
2015); combating human trafficking (Tong et al., 2017); and detection of Cyber-bullying (Zhong et al.,
2016). In today’s online environment, the strategic use of multimedia (image, video etc.) has become
increasingly important part of creating a successful website. Visual information embedded in web doc-
uments provides right-angled information that is free of ambiguities of natural language. It can also
improve search ranking and Search engine optimization (SEO) scores on many levels that contribute to
search visibility, find-ability, user satisfaction, experience and engagement. As a result, use of multi-
media content in web documents has become more dominant than text in recent years. Rich content of
multimedia data, constructed in alliance with the information contained in different modalities, calls for
new and innovative methods for better management of web search results.

In this paper, we hypothesize that high quality clustering can be obtained by representing different ob-
jective functions over different views of web documents and simultaneously optimizing them. In contrast
to prior works which solely depend on information extracted from text we present a multi objective based
multiview clustering algorithm which integrates both visual (images) and text content of web-documents
for solving SRC problem. Experimental results show that this new multi-view approach significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art unimodal approaches. We motivate this paper with a real example which

Figure 1: Example where text content differs but image information is same.

demonstrates the potential benefit of integrating visual information for better organization of web search
results. Figure 1 shows results from state-of-the-art approach that depends only on text part of the web
document for the web search query “3.1 Arts Bodyart Tattoo” in ODP-239 dataset. Even though it is
clear from looking at the images that they should belong to same cluster, text snippets are not provid-
ing enough clues, causing it to appear in different clusters. It is evident from the example that there is
complimentary information in the images that is either unavailable in the text or can be in contrast to
the text. Our hypothesis is that we can improve SRC performance if we can capture this complimentary
high-level visual information. We use pre-trained 19-layer VGG net (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014)
to extract high-level features directly from the image. After extracting the image features for all the
images in our dataset, image view of each document is generated (Section 3.1). To generate the textual
view of each document, we combine the benefits of both Word2Vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) and TF-IDF.
While Word2Vec vectors are better at capturing the generalized meaning of each word, combining them
together by assigning equal weight to all words of a document to generate its textual view is not ideal for
our task. For example, words that contribute to the syntax rather than the meaning of a sentence should
have lower impact on clustering algorithm compared to more specific rare words. Therefore, we scale
each word vector by the corresponding TF-IDF weight for that word and generate the textual view fol-
lowing the approach in Section 3.1. Finally, we combine both views of the dataset by our multi-objective
based multi-view clustering framework.

In order to draw conclusive remarks, we present an exhaustive evaluation where our multi objective
based multi-view algorithm (MOO-Multiview-PBM) is compared to the most competitive text-based
(endogenous) SRC algorithms: STC (Zamir and Etzioni, 1998), Bisecting Incremental K-means (BIK),
LINGO (Osinski and Weiss, 2005), GK-means (Moreno et al., 2013), MOO-clus (Acharya et al., 2014)



3795

and MMOEA (Wahid et al., 2014). Experiments are conducted on three different standard data sets
(MORESQUE, ODP- 239 and AMBIENT) for two clustering evaluation metrics (Fb3 and F1). Results
show that MOO-Multiview-PBM exceeds all text-based approaches and solutions. In this paper, our
main contributions are as follows: a) As far the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to solve
SRC by using both textual & visual information; b) A new multi objective based multi-view clustering
algorithm for SRC, that determines the number of clusters automatically; and c) Novel text representation
of document in the context of SRC by combining the benefits of both word2vec and TF-IDF.

2 Related Work

2.1 SRC Algorithms

Suffix Tree Clustering (STC) algorithm proposed by Zamir and Etzioni (1998), is a clustering technique,
that combines base clusters having maximum string overlaps based on web snippets represented as com-
pact tries. Results showed improvements over K-means, agglomerative hierarchical clustering, buckshot,
single-pass and fractionation algorithms, and this approach is a tough baseline to beat Moreno and Dias
(2014). Later, authors of Osinski and Weiss (2005) presented an approach named LINGO which utilizes
similar representation of strings as done in Zamir and Etzioni (1998). Initially frequent phrases were ex-
tracted based on suffix-arrays and later the group descriptions were matched with topics generated with
latent semantic analysis. Documents were then assigned to their relevant groups. Carpineto et al. (2009)
showed that the nature of the outputs obtained by SRC algorithms recommend the adoption of a meta
clustering approach. The core idea is to combine the complementary results obtained from SOO (single
objective) solutions. A novel approach that computes the agreement of two partitions of objects into var-
ied clusters was proposed in this paper. This is done depending on the information content related to the
series of decisions made by the partitions on single pairs of objects. OPTIMSRC results demonstrated
that meta clustering is far better than individual clustering techniques. Moreno et al. (2013), adapted the
K-means algorithm to a third-order similarity measure and proposed a stopping criterion that determines
the optimal number of clusters automatically. Experiments were conducted on two standard data sets,
MORESQUE (Navigli and Crisafulli, 2010) and ODP-239 (Carpineto and Romano, 2010), and showed
significant improvement over all existing text-based SRC techniques developed by then.

Later, Acharya et al. (2014), first defined the SRC task as a multi-objective problem. They defined two
objective functions ( separability & compactness), that are optimized parallely with the help of AMOSA
(Bandyopadhyay et al., 2008). Their evaluations outperformed knowledge-driven exogenous strategies
(Scaiella et al., 2012), text-based endogenous SRC approaches and algorithms.

In another work, the multi-view clustering approach proposed by Wahid et al. (2014) used the search
capability of multi-objective optimization for SRC. It is basically a cluster ensemble approach where
the outputs of multiple clustering techniques like hierarchical clustering approaches and K-means are
combined efficiently using NSGA-II (Deb et al., 2002) (non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II).

A considerable amount of works have also been proposed that uses exogenous information to solve
the SRC problem. One such work is proposed by Scaiella et al. (2012) which uses Wikipedia articles to
develop a bipartite graph and employs spectral clustering over it to discover relevant clusters. Recently,
authors of Di Marco and Navigli (2013) presented an approach to incorporate word sense induction on
the Web1T corpus (Brants and Franz, 2006) that improves SRC.

2.2 Multi-view Clustering

Multi-view data sets are frequent in real life because of the use of different modalities of data input
and generation, viz., text, video and audio. The growth of multi-view data in real-world applications
has increased the curiosity in multi-view learning (Sun, 2013). Multi-view clustering techniques try to
explore the available multiple representations of data for obtaining a precise and robust partitioning of
the data in contrast to single-view clustering. A two-view expectation maximization based clustering
technique was developed by (Bickel and Scheffer, 2004). A two-view spectral clustering algorithm that
generates a bipartite graph was developed by (De Sa, 2005). Another multi-view spectral clustering
technique was proposed by (Kumar and Daumé, 2011). A convex mixture model based multi-view



3796

clustering technique was proposed by (Tzortzis and Likas, 2009). The same authors later proposed a
kernel-based weighted multi-view clustering technique (Tzortzis and Likas, 2012). A cluster ensemble
based approach for multi-view clustering was proposed by (Xie and Sun, 2013). A new multi-view based
K-means clustering technique was developed by (Cai et al., 2013) for large-scale data sets. (Wahid et al.,
2014) have developed a cluster ensemble based technique to solve the multi-view clustering problem for
web documents. Although it presented a multi-view based algorithm MMOEA for solving SRC problem
but all the views (i.e., different representations of the data set) are related to semantic and syntactic
contents of the web snippets.

3 Multiobjective Multi-view Approach for SRC

In this work we have proposed a multiobjective based multi-view approach, namely MOO-Multiview-
PBM for solving the problem of search result clustering.

3.1 Generation of Different Views

In the current study we have used some standard data sets of SRC problem for the purpose of evaluation:
AMBIENT, MORESQUE (Navigli and Crisafulli, 2010) and ODP-239 (Carpineto and Romano, 2010).
For each of web-snippets present in the data set, we have generated two views as follows:

1. The Textual view: This view represents both syntactic and semantic information of a document
given a particular query. This is generated by combining the document similarity matrix obtained
from both word embedding and TF-IDF. Using word embedding each word in the vocabulary is
represented by a vector of dimension 1 × 100. Document similarity matrix using word embedding
is generated by Equation 1.

Semb(di, dj) =
1

‖di‖‖dj‖

‖di‖∑
r=1

‖dj‖∑
b=1

CosSim(wri , w
b
j) (1)

Here, wri (resp. w
b
j) represents the r

th (resp. bth) word vector of document di (resp. dj). ‖di‖ and
‖dj‖ denote the total number of words in documents di and dj , respectively. CosSim(., .) is the
cosine similarity between two vectors. TF-IDF is generated using the following steps:

(a) The terms in the documents are first extracted,

(b) A document-term matrix is created. Here, a row, a column and a cell correspond to a document,
a term, and the weighted value of a term for a document, respectively,

(c) TF-IDF (a common weighting scheme) values are used to fill this matrix. Each cell contains
the TF-IDF score of a term given a document.

The cosine similarity is calculated between TF-IDF vectors of two documents to generate the
document × document similarity matrix Stfidf . Here Stfidf (di, dj) contains cosine similarity
between TF-IDF vectors of two documents, di and dj .
The Final document× document similarity matrix, Stext, is generated by the equation:

Stext(di, dj) = Semb(di, dj)× Stfidf (di, dj), i, j = 1, . . . , n (2)
Here n is the total number of documents.

2. The Image view: Images are extracted from each web document. We feed images to the pre-trained
VGG19 network which computes a 4096 dimensional feature vector for every image that contains
the activations of the hidden layer (‘fc7’) immediately before the VGG’s object classifier. Given
two image vectors imgi and imgj from two different web documents di and dj , respectively, the
similarity between the documents is calculated by Equation 3.

Simage(di, dj) =
1

‖di‖‖dj‖

‖di‖∑
r=1

‖dj‖∑
b=1

CosSim(imgri , img
b
j) (3)

Here, imgri (resp. img
b
j) represents the r

th (resp. bth) image of the di (resp. d) web document. ‖di‖
and ‖dj‖ denote the total number relevant images present in di and dj , respectively.

3.2 String Representation and Archive Initialization

The first step of the proposed clustering approach is to initialize the Archive used in AMOSA (Bandy-
opadhyay et al., 2008) with some alternative diverse set of solutions. The solutions are generated ran-
domly. Here each solution contains a set of cluster centroids (representative web-snippets) in order to
represent the partitioning of web-snippets.

The number of cluster centroids encoded in a particular solution i, denoted byKi, is selected randomly
from the given range Kmin to Kmax as follows: Ki = (rand()mod(Kmax − 1)) + Kmin. For the
purpose of initialization, Ki number of web-snippets are randomly selected from the data set and the
corresponding indices are used as the initial cluster centers.

3.3 Formation of Clusters and Objective Function Calculations

After initializing the archive members with some randomly selected cluster centroids, the following steps
are executed to compute different objective functions. The search capability of AMOSA can be utilized
to simultaneously optimize these objective functions.

1. First, the set of representative web-snippets present in the string are extracted. Let the entire
set be {C1, C2, . . . , CK} here Ci is the ith cluster representative. K is the number of clus-
ters encoded in that particular string. K-medoids clustering is applied to the dataset using this
set of cluster representatives for different views. In case of text-view, a particular document
di is assigned to cluster t whose centroid has the maximum similarity value to di given by
t = argmaxk=1,...KStext(di, Ck).Here Stext(di, Ck) is computed using Equation 2.

In case of visual view, a particular document di is assigned to cluster t whose centroid has the max-
imum similarity value to di. t = argmaxk=1,...KSimage(di, Ck).Here Simage(di, Ck) is computed
using Equation 3.

2. The PBM-index values are calculated for the final partitionings obtained using individual views.
Let the values be denoted by PBMv, v = 1, 2.

3. The adjoint matrix (Av of size n× n, where n is the number of documents) corresponding to view
v is calculated as follows:

Avij = 1 if di and dj belong to the same cluster or i =j (4)

= 0 otherwise (5)

4. A new objective function Agreement Index is calculated as follows. This measures the agreement
between the partitionings obtained using multiple views. The measure is calculated as follows:

At a time two views are considered: v1 and v2. Let the corresponding adjoint matrices be
Av1 and Av2, respectively. The number of agreement (na) is calculated as follows: na =∑n

i=1

∑n
j=1 IAv1ij ,Av2ij

, here

IAv1ij ,Av2ij
= 1 if Av1ij = A

v2
ij (6)

= 0 otherwise
The number of disagreements (nd) is calculated as follows: nd = n2−na. Agreement index between
these two views (v1, v2) is calculated as follows: AIv1,v2 = na+1nd+1 . The values of 1 in the numerator
and denominator are used as a normalization factor to avoid the problem of division by zero. The
total Agreement index for the entire partitioning is calculated as follows:

AI =

m∑
j=1

m∑
i=1,j 6=i

2×AIvj ,vi

m× (m− 1)
, (7)

where m is the available number of views.

5. The objective functions corresponding to a particular string are:
{PBMtext, PBMimage, AI} where PBMtext and PBMimage are the values of PBM-indices cal-
culated on partitionings obtained using text based view and image based view, respectively.



3798

3.4 Update of String
After the objective functions are calculated, a consensus partitioning is obtained which satisfies all the
available views. The cluster centroids corresponding to this consensus partitioning are used to update the
string of AMOSA.

• Let the partitioning obtained using two views be represented by π1, π2. Let us denote the jth cluster
of view v as πvj . First some reordering is done among all the obtained partitionings so that there is
a one-to-one correspondence between the cluster numbers of different partitionings.

• New cluster centroids C, are selected among those documents which are present in the same clus-
ter corresponding to both the views. Let common documents of cluster i in both the views be
{di1, . . . , d

i
m}. Then the representative of this set, denoted by Ci, is dt where

t = argmaxmk=1

∑m
j=1,j 6=k

Stext(d
i
k,d

i
j)+Simage(d

i
k,d

i
j)

2

m− 1
. (8)

Here Sfinal and Simage are calculated using Equation 2 and 3, respectively.

• Next, the newly generated cluster centroidsCj , j = 1, . . . ,K are used to obtain the final consensus
partitioning as follows: πj = {∀di ∈ S : Sim(di, Cj) > Sim(di, C l) for l = 1, . . . ,K, l 6= j}.
Here, K is the number of clusters encoded in that solution.

Sim(di, Cj) =
Stext(di, Cj) + Simage(di, Cj)

2
(9)

Here Sfinal and Simage are calculated using Equation 2 and 3, respectively. S denotes the set of all
documents.

• Finally, the representatives of clusters πj , j = 1 . . . ,K are calculated using Equation 8. These
new cluster centroids Cj , j = 1, . . . ,K are used to replace the old centroids encoded in the string.

So, in order to obtain a consensus partitioning, initially the common points of different clusters present
in different partitionings obtained using different views are identified. These points are further used to
determine cluster centroids. The other points are assigned to the centroids having maximum similarity,
calculated by Equation 9, to obtain a final consensus partitioning. These cluster centroids are used to
update the given string.

3.5 Search Operators
In order to explore the search space efficiently using AMOSA, perturbation operations are introduced.
These operators also help in generating some new solutions from the current solution which can further
take part in the search process. For this purpose, three different perturbation operators are introduced.
Below we describe three types of mutation operations in detail:
Mutation 1: In this operation each centroid is parsed individually and with some probability the exist-
ing document id in the centroid is replaced by a new document id which is selected from the document
collection randomly 1.
Mutation 2: Here a cluster centroid is randomly selected and it is deleted from the string. Size of the
string is reduced by 1.
Mutation 3: Here a web document is randomly chosen and the corresponding index is added to the
string. Size of the string is increased by 1.
All the above mentioned three mutation operations are equi-probable. Any one of the above discussed
mutation operators is applied on a particular solution to generate a new solution which can further par-
ticipate in the process of AMOSA.

4 Results and Discussion

Results of different approaches are shown in Table 2 for all the data sets with respect to different per-
formance metrics. From Table 2, it is evident that our proposed approach MOO-Multiview-PBM out-
performs the results of MOO-clus (Acharya et al., 2014) by a margin of around 6.2% − 6.5% in terms

1existing document id may or may not get replaced by the new document id

of Fb3 −measure and 7.0% − 7.3% in terms of F1 −measure for both MORESQUE and ODP-239
datasets. Box plots of results obtained from combined F1−measure and combined RandIndex over
all three data sets (i.e., AMBIENT, MORESQUE and ODP-239) by our proposed method are reported in
Figure 4. This is done to compare the performance of MOO-Multiview-PBM with MMOEA algorithm
(Wahid et al., 2014). Although, AMBIENT has received less attention since the creation of ODP-239,
we have included it to show a fair comparison of our results with the results from MMOEA (Wahid et al.,
2014). In Figure 4, comparison with MMOEA (Wahid et al., 2014) is illustrated. MOO-Multiview-PBM
(word2vec*tfidf) reports an average F1 measure and Rand Index values of 0.74 and 0.77, respectively,
over all three datasets combined, which are similar to those obtained by MMOEA. Note that MMOEA
is based on three views (Topics, terms and senses) and also utilized some external information like
Wikipedia data during its processing. But our proposed method attains comparable results using infor-
mation extracted only from the given datasets. No external information was used during the computation
of our approach.

We have implemented our proposed algorithm using two different versions of textual views. Initially
we have used word embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013) for the textual view and combined it with image
view in our algorithm MOO-Multiview-PBM(word2vec). Later we have used word embeddings and tf-idf
vector together, described in Section 3.1, as textual view along with image view for our algorithm MOO-
Multiview-PBM(word2vec*tf-idf). Results in Table 2 show that MOO-Multiview-PBM(word2vec*tf-idf)
achieves an improvement of 1.2% − 1.8% over MOO-Multiview-PBM(word2vec). It substantiates our
hypothesis that combining the benefits of both word2vec and TF-IDF can improve the search result
clustering performance.

We have also quantified the influence of individual views in obtaining the final partitioning. The degree
is expressed as follows:

Degreev =
‖Av ∩A∪v‖
‖A∪v‖

whereAv denotes the adjoint matrix (expressed in Equation 4) corresponding to the partitioning obtained
using view v and A∪v is the adjoint matrix corresponding to the consensus partitioning obtained by
consulting all views. The contributions computed as above for different views are shown in Figure 2. It
is observed that knowledge extracted from images has contributed on an average 41.58% in the clustering
process (refer to Figure 2) for all three datasets.

As mentioned in Section 1 that only textual information is not sufficient for SRC clustering, here
we have presented some examples where although these web snippets belong to the same cluster, their
textual information widely vary whereas their corresponding image information classify them into the
same cluster. In Table 3, we have listed some sample queries from ODP-239 datasets whose textual
contents vary widely related to query. In Figure 3, we have shown corresponding images extracted from
websites of above mentioned queries. It is evident from these examples that image information is more
relevant to the query compared to the textual information.

5 Error Analysis

The errors made by our proposed method have been thoroughly analyzed. After a thorough manual
analysis, it has been observed that misclassification occurred because of the following reasons. Firstly,
from Table 4, it can be seen that there are many inactive web links from which we failed to extract
images. For those instances only textual information from the snippets are used for classification. For
example, in ODP-239 dataset results 2.54 and 2.65 belong to the same cluster in original labelling.
Web links of both 2.54 and 2.65 are inactive, therefore only textual information is used for clustering.

Boxplots of the best (b) F1-measure (d) Rand index values obtained for different queries combining all
the data sets together after application of MMOEA (taken from the paper (Wahid et al., 2014)).

But in these web snippets text varies widely, viz.,“Meeting schedules, contact information, calendar
of events, ftm, mtf, soffa, information, articles, book catalog, and guestbook.” in 2.65 and “Headline
links from media sources worldwide.” in 2.54, hence in predicted clustering solution both 2.54 and 2.65
belong to different clusters. Secondly, there are few instances where textual view and image view differ
widely, consensus between these two views is very less hence leads to misclassification. For example,
in ODP-239 dataset query 196.1 and 196.11 originally belong to the same cluster. But the text contents,
viz.,“Fairy and monster identification list, free e-cards, customs, recipes, games, history, and links to

of queries 196.1 (see Figures 5a and 5b) and 196.11 (see Figures 5c and 5d) differ widely hence no
concrete consensus is drawn between the two views, therefore in predicted clustering solution they are
misclassified.

6 Conclusion
In the current study a multiobjective based multi-view clustering technique is developed for solving the
problem of search result clustering (SRC). Views constructed over textual and visual information con-
tained in web-snippets are considered. We have hypothesized that two web-snippets can be similar either
with respect to content or with respect to images. These two views are exploited simultaneously in order
to detect good-quality clustering of web-snippets. Three objective functions capturing the qualities of
different partitions and a consensus function measuring the similarity between two partitions obtained
using different views are simultaneously optimized using the search capability of a MOO process. Im-
proved results on standard bench-mark data sets over state-of-the-art approaches support our hypothesis
that use of multi-view information indeed helps in solving the SRC problem. In future we would like
to exploit other views of web-snippets and incorporate it in our framework. Investigations of AMOSA
as the underlying optimization strategy and PBM -index as the internal cluster validity index are also
required to be carried out in future.

Appendix A. Objective Functions

PBM index: This is a popular cluster validity index proposed by Pakhira, Bandyopadhyay and Maulik
(Pakhira et al., 2004). It outperforms most of the cluster validity indices in the literature in properly
detecting the optimal partitioning. This index is defined as follows:

PBM(K) = (
1

K
× E1
EK
×DK) (10)



3804

Here, K denotes the number of clusters, EK =
∑K

k=1

∑nk
j=1 dist(Ck, d

k
j ) and DK =

maxKi,j=1 dist(Ci, Cj), where Cj denotes the centroid of the j
th cluster and d

k
j denotes the j

th web-
snippet of the kth cluster. nk is the total number of web-snippets of the kth cluster. The objective is to
maximize the PBM-index. In case of text-view, dist(Ck, d

k
j ) = 1 − Stext(Ck, d

k
j ), where Stext is cal-

culated using Equation 2 and in case of image-view dist(Ck, d
k
j ) = 1− Simage(Ck, d

k
j ), where Simage

is calculated using Equation 3. Similarly DK value between two centroids is also calculated either using
text-based similarity or image based similarity measure.

Appendix B. Experimental Setup

We perform web snippet tokenization and word vector generation using gensim library.2 Word embed-
dings are obtained from the pre-trained Google news word embeddings.3 Image features are extracted
from the FC7 layer of VGG19 available in Keras library.4 We executed our algorithm over three gold
standard datasets: AMBIENT5; MORESQUE (Navigli and Crisafulli, 2010); and ODP-239 (Carpineto
and Romano, 2010). Description of the datasets, total number of relevant images extracted for each query
and number of active query links present in each data set are summarized in Table 4.

The parameters of our proposed algorithms are: Tmin = 0.01, Tmax = 100, α = 0.85, HL = 20,
SL = 30, itr = 20,Kmax =

√
#ofsamples andKmin = 2. All these values have been determined after

conducting a thorough sensitivity study (and those are in line with the approach proposed by (Acharya
et al., 2014)).

images extracted for each query and number of active query links present in each data set.

Appendix C. Evaluation Metrics

An ideal SRC system should be represented by a unique cluster having all the relevant web pages in-
side. However, determining a unique and complete metric to evaluate the performance of a clustering
algorithm is still an open problem (Amigó et al., 2013).

In order to measure the qualities of partitions obtained using different clustering techniques for these
web search data sets, we have used three cluster quality measures, Fb3 measure (Amigó et al., 2009), F1
measure (Crabtree et al., 2005) and Rand Index (Hubert and Arabie, 1985). In particular, Fb3 has been
defined to evaluate completeness, cluster homogeneity, size-vs-quantity and rag-bag constraints. Fb3 is a
function of Precisionb3(Pb3 ) and Recallb3 (Rb3 ). All metrics are defined as follows:.

Fb3 =
2× Pb3 ×Rb3
Pb3 +Rb3

, Pb3 =

here πj is th jth cluster and π∗j is the gold standard of j
th cluster. h(., .) and h∗(., .) are defined in

Equation 11.

Appendix D. Model Comparisons

In order to comprehensively evaluate the performance of our proposed approach (MOO-Multiview-PBM),
we listed some strong baseline approaches for comparison.

• MOO-clus(Acharya et al., 2014): This algorithm uses archived multi-objective simulated anneal-
ing framework to simultaneously optimize two objectives, compactness and separation, for cluster-
ing web snippets.

• GK-means(Moreno et al., 2013): This algorithm has adapted the K-means algorithm to a third-
order similarity measure and proposed a stopping criterion to automatically determine the number
of clusters.

• Suffix Tree Clustering(STC)(Zamir and Etzioni, 1998): It is an incremental, linear time algo-
rithm which creates clusters based on phrases shared between documents.

• LINGO(Osinski and Weiss, 2005): In this method, initially the frequent phrases based on suffix-
arrays are extracted and later matched the group description with topics obtained with latent seman-
tic analysis.

• MMOEA(Wahid et al., 2014): This algorithm uses multiple views to generate different clustering
solutions and then select a combination of clusters to form a final clustering solution.
