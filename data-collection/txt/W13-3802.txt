The Groningen Meaning Bank

Johan Bos
University of Groningen, The Netherlands

What would be a good method to provide a large collection of semantically annotated texts with formal,
deep semantics rather than shallow? In this talk I will argue that (i) a bootstrapping approach comprising
state-of-the-art NLP tools for semantic parsing, in combination with (ii) a wiki-like interface for collabora-
tive annotation of experts, and (iii) a game with a purpose for crowdsourcing, are the starting ingredients
for fulfilling this enterprise. The result, known as the Groningen Meaning Bank, is a semantic resource that
anyone can edit and that integrates various semantic phenomena, including predicate-argument structure,
scope, tense, thematic roles, animacy, pronouns, and rhetorical relations. A single semantic formalism, Dis-
course Representation Theory, embraces all these phenonema by taking meaning representations of texts
rather than sentences as the units of annotation.
