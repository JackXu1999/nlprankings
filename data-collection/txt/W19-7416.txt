Abstract
Previous research has documented variabil-
ity in speech production by speakers with CI.
With reference to stop production, VOT du-
ration has been reported to differ for chil-
dren with Cochlear Implants (CI) and normal
hearing (NH) in different languages. As the
voicing contrast differs across languages, it
is important to examine VOT production in
the speech of individuals with CI in differ-
ent languages. The Greek stop consonant in-
ventory consists of voiceless unaspirated stops
and prevoiced stops at the bilabial, dental and
velar places of articulation. In this study, VOT
duration is examined for voiceless and voiced
word initial stops in the context of the vowel
/a/ produced by 24 Greekspeaking children
with CI and 24 agematched children with NH.
Results showed a tendency for longer VOT du-
ration for the voiceless stops produced by the
children with NH than with CI and longer pre-
voicing for the children with CI compared to
their NH peers.

1 Introduction

Past research on children with profound hear-
ing loss reported that variation in certain acous-
tic characteristics, such as the voicing contrast
in stop consonants, impacts negatively on their
speech intelligibility (Metz et al., 1990; Monsen,
1983). The speech intelligibility of children with
profound hearing loss has greatly improved fol-
lowing cochlear implantation (Lane et al., 1995).
Yet, a lot of variability in production has been ob-
served, often attributed to several factors, such as

the age of onset of hearing loss, the age of cochlear
implantation (Dunn et al., 2014; Geers et al., 2003;
Fryauf-Bertschy et al., 1997) but also to factors
relevant to limitations of cochlear implant technol-
ogy such as inadequate processing of the spectral
and fine temporal structure of speech (Oxenham
and Kreft, 2014; Zeng et al., 2008; Rubinstein,
2004).

A cue of fine acoustic contrast is Voice Onset
Time (VOT), defined as the temporal interval be-
tween the moment of the release of the stop and
the onset of glottal pulsing. It takes positive val-
ues when the stop release precedes the onset of
voicing and negative values when the stop release
occurs after the onset of voicing. Values cluster-
ing at 0 ms indicate simultaneous release of the
articulatory closure and the onset of vocalic voic-
ing (Lisker and Abramson, 1964).

Previous research has shown that VOT duration
differs in children with CI as compared to children
with NH. (Scarbel et al., 2013) reported longer
VOT durations for voiceless stops and shorter
VOT values for voiced stops for French speaking
children with CI compared to NH controls. They
interpreted their findings to suggest exaggeration
of the voicing contrast between voiced and voice-
less stops by children with CI. (Aksoy et al., 2017)
examined variation in VOT duration as a function
of the duration of cochlear implantation. They re-
ported VOT values for children with CI with 1
up to 8 years of implantation. Overall, shorter
VOT durations were reported for all voiceless and
voiced consonants for children with 1-3 years of



CI use. They also reported that longer implant use
resulted in VOT durations that were closer to the
NH controls.

As the voicing contrast differs across languages,
it is important to examine VOT production in the
speech of individuals with CI in different lan-
guages. This study aims to provide insights on
VOT production by children with CI by examin-
ing data from Greek.

The Greek stop consonant inventory consists
of voiceless unaspirated stops /p, t, k/ and pre-
voiced stops /b, d, g/ (Arvaniti, 1999). Sev-
eral studies have reported VOT duration for adult
speakers of Greek (see Arvaniti, 2007 for a re-
view) but there are few studies for children (Okali-
dou et al., 2010; Tsiartsioni, 2011; Chionidou
and Nicolaidis, 2015). (Okalidou et al., 2010)
reported VOT values ranging approximately be-
tween -140ms to -60ms for voiced stops and 10 to
50ms for voiceless stops for Greek children whose
ages ranged from 2;0 to 4;0 The same study re-
ported that Greek speaking children acquire an
adult-like two-way voicing contrast, i.e. between
the pre-voiced and the voiceless unaspirated stops,
at all places of articulation (bilabial, dental, ve-
lar) by ages 2;62;11 (3035 months). (Tsiartsioni,
2011) examined VOT duration for Greek-speaking
and English speaking children aged 10, 13 and 16
years old. VOT duration ranged between 11.98
ms to 12.85 ms for /p/, 14.29 ms to 14.83 ms for
/t/, 28.89 ms to 31.86 ms for /k/, -95.90 ms to -
98.68 ms for /b/, -91.40 ms to -99.99 ms for /d/
and -85.08 ms to -103.42 for /g/ for Greek. VOT
duration ranged between 51.9 ms to 67.98 ms for
/p/, 66.12 ms to 79.16 ms for /t/, 60 ms to 82.06
ms for /k/, -0.14 ms to -28.88 ms for /b/, -0.14 ms
to -22.66 ms for /d/ and 5.72 ms to -21.10 for /g/
for English. (Chionidou and Nicolaidis, 2015) re-
ported VOT mean values of 17 ms for [p], 17 ms
for [t] and 37 ms for [k] for Greek children whose
ages ranged from 8;2 to 12;6.

Furthermore previous research has examined
several parameters that may have an effect on VOT
production, including place of articulation, stress,
and the following vowel. For voiceless stops, as
articulation moves from the bilabial to the ve-
lar place of articulation the duration of VOT in-
creases, e.g. for English (Peterson and Lehiste,
1960; Klatt, 1975; Volaitis and Miller, 1992; Cho
and Ladefoged, 1999; Whiteside and Marshall,
2001; Morris et al., 2008), for Greek (Fourakis,

1986; Nicolaidis, 2002), for German (Lein et al.,
2016), for Spanish (Schmidt and Flege, 1996),
for Hungarian (Gósy and Ringen, 2009), for Can-
tonese (Tse, 2005), for Armenian and Korean
(Cho and Ladefoged, 1999). On the other hand,
prevoicing is longer for bilabials and dentals than
velars in various languages (e.g. Helgason and
Ringen, 2008 for Standard Swedish). Stress has
not been found to influence the VOT duration of
voiceless stops. Voiced stops tend to have longer
VOT values in unstressed syllables but this differ-
ence has not been found to be statistically signif-
icant for English (Abramson and Lisker, 1964).
Typically, the VOT of voiceless stops is longer
when a high vowel follows than in the context of
a low vowel (Lisker and Abramson, 1964, 1967;
Klatt, 1975; Smith, 1978; Port and Rotunno, 1979;
Morris et al., 2008; Nicolaidis, 2002).

In this study, the VOT duration of the Greek
stop consonants /p, t, k, b, d, g/ in word initial
position will be measured. The research ques-
tions are: a) Are there any differences in the
VOT duration between Greek-speaking children
with CI and NH? b) Are there any differences in
VOT duration as a function of place of articu-
lation for Greek-speaking children with CI com-
pared to children with NH? To our knowledge,
there has been no previous study examining VOT
production for Greekspeaking children with CI.
The study of VOT production is of theoretical
and clinical importance. Clinically, the onset of
voicing is usually used for the evaluation of de-
velopmental maturation of neuro-motor coordina-
tion (DiSimoni, 1974; Eguchi, 1969; Zlatin and
Koenigsknecht, 1976) and constitutes an essential
part of the evaluation of speech production in peo-
ple with hearing loss (Monsen, 1976).

2 Method

2.1 Participants

Twenty four children with CI and twenty four
age- and gender-matched children with NH partic-
ipated in the study. The participants ages ranged
from 2;8 to 13;3. Post-implant age ranged from
1;11 months to 11;5 (23-137 months). All partici-
pants were monolingual native speakers of Greek.
In an attempt to avoid any additional effect of
mental health, the Raven Test was administered;
the scores for both groups ranged from 90 to 135
which is within normal limits. The speakers of the
control group did not have any hearing or speech



problems as reported by their parents. Signed con-
sent was obtained from the parents of all partici-
pants.

2.2 Material

The speech material consisted of Greek disyllabic
and trisyllabic real words with word initial voice-
less and voiced stops /p, t, k, b, d, g/. Stops
were followed by the vowel /a/, e.g. (’papa, ’bala,
’tafos, ’dama, ka’fes, ga’raz). Stress placement
was on the first or second syllable.

2.3 Procedure

A word naming task was carried out and each tar-
get word was produced at least three times in ran-
dom order by all participants.

Data acquisition took place at the Cochlear Im-
plant Center of the 1stOtorhinolaryngology Clinic
of AHEPA Hospital in Thessaloniki. Data was
recorded in a sound-proof booth with a SONY
PCM D50 digital recorder.

2.4 Measurements

PRAAT was used for the measurement of VOT du-
ration (www.praat.org). For voiceless stops, VOT
was measured from the stop burst to the onset of
the first glottal cycle and formant structure on the
acoustic waveform and spectrogram respectively.
For the voiced stops, VOT was measured from the
first glottal cycle of the stop to the stop burst. A
total of 864 tokens were produced (48 children x 6
words x 3 repetitions).

Our data didnt follow a normal distribution and
violated the principle of homogeneity based on the
Levenes test. Thus, non-parametric tests Mann-
Whitney U test and Wilcoxon, were used for the
analyses. Differences between the two groups
(CI/NH) were measured.

Due to the wide range in the age of the partic-
ipants, there was not homogeneity in the sample.
So, further analyses were carried out on partici-
pants separated in four age subgroups by chrono-
logical age: the first group consisted of children
from 2 to 4 years old (4 children in total, 2 with
CI & 2 with NH), the second group ranged from
5 to 7 years old (18 children in total, 9 with CI &
9 with NH), the third group ranged from 8 to 10
years old (16 children in total, 8 with CI & 8 with
NH) and the last group ranged from 11 to 13 years
old (10 children in total, 5 with CI & 5 with NH).

3 Results

All participants with CI and NH Table 1
presents mean VOT durations of the Greek voice-
less and voiced stops (pooled for place of artic-
ulation) produced by all participants with CI and
NH. For the voiceless stops, a statistically signif-
icant difference was found in overall VOT dura-
tion between the two groups; VOT duration was
shorter in the stop productions of children with
CI as compared to NH controls, p=0.012, d=-
0.3586. For the voiced stops, children with CI
showed longer mean prevoicing values as com-
pared to their NH peers; however, the difference
was not statistically significant. Table 2 presents
mean VOT values for the stops at each place of ar-
ticulation Group comparisons for each place of ar-
ticulation, for the voiced and voiceless categories
revealed a statistically significant difference only
for the voiced alveolar stop /d/ , U=164.5, p=0.009
(d=0.36762). In particular, mean VOT for /d/ was
significantly longer for the children with CI than
NH. Longer VOT was also found for /b/ for the
same group; however it did not reach statistical
significance. VOT duration for /g/ was similar

for the two groups. In addition, there was a ten-
dency for the VOT of /p, t, k/, to be shorter for the
children with CI than NH although differences did
not reach statistical significance. Table 3 presents
the range and standard deviation values for all the
stops measured.

With reference to the influence of place of ar-
ticulation, a tendency for longer VOT duration for
the voiceless velar stops /k/ is observed, in agree-
ment with previous literature (Okalidou et al.,
2010; Tsiartsioni, 2011; Chionidou and Nico-
laidis, 2015). This is evident for both groups. For
the voiced consonants, a decrease in VOT duration
is evident from /b/ to /d/ to /g/ for both groups,
(cf. (Tsiartsioni, 2011) for children with NH); ad-
ditional statistical analyses are needed to confirm
the place of articulation effect.

Group A: 2-4 years old A comparison be-
tween the two groups shows shorter VOT val-
ues for voiceless and voiced consonants for chil-
dren with CI. However, no statistically signifi-
cant differences were found (Table 4) (p=0.333,
U=0.000, for /p/, p=0.667, U=1.000, for /t/,
p=0.667, U=1.000, for /k/, p=0.667, U=1.000, for
/b/, p=1.000, U=2.000, for /d/, p=0.667, U=1.000,
for /g/).

Group B: 5-7 years old A comparison between
the two groups shows shorter VOT values for the
voiceless and longer for the voiced consonants ex-
cept for the voiced velar /g/ for children with CI.
However, no statistically significant differences
were found (Table 4) (p=0.279, U=21.000 for /p/,
p=0.195, U=19.000 for /t/, p=0.065, U=14.000
for /k/, p=0.798, U=29.000 for /b/, p=0.083,
U=15.000 for /d/, p=0.328, U=22.000 for /g/).

Group C: 8-10 years old A comparison be-
tween the two groups shows shorter VOT val-
ues for the voiceless and longer for the voiced
for children CI. However, no statistically signif-
icant differences were found (Table 4) (p=0.297,
U=28.000 for /p/, p=1.000, U=40.500 for /t/,
p=0.863, U=38.500 for /k/, p=0.063, U=19.000
for /b/, p=0.161, U=24.000 for /d/, p=0.730,
U=36.000 for /g/).

Group D: 11-13 years old A comparison be-
tween the two groups shows shorter VOT val-
ues for the voiceless consonants and longer
for the voiced, except for the voiceless velar
/k/, for children with CI. However, no statisti-
cally significant differences were found (Table
4) (p=0.548, U=9.000 for /p/, p=0.095, U=4.500
for /t/, p=0.1.000, U=12.000 for /k/, p=0.056,
U=3.000 for /b/, p=0.095, U=4.000 for /d/,
p=0.095, U=4.000 for /g/).

4 Discussion

Many studies have measured VOT in different
languages but there is relatively limited literature
for VOT duration in Greek especially with refer-
ence to children. This study contributes to cur-
rent knowledge by providing VOT data for Greek-
speaking children with cochlear implants.

Our results have shown significantly shorter
VOT duration for the voiceless stops (pooled for
place of articulation) when produced by children
with CI compared to NH controls. Further anal-
yses for each consonant separately showed that
there was a tendency for shorter VOT values to
be produced by children with CI for all voice-
less consonants; however this difference did not
reach statistical significance. With reference to the
voiced stops, significantly longer prevoicing was
produced for /d/ by children with CI. A similar
tendency was observed for /b/ but this difference
was not statistically significant.

Further analyses per age group showed that for
the voiceless consonants there is a tendency for
shorter VOT values produced by children with CI
in all age groups. For the voiced consonants there
is a tendency for longer VOT values produced by
children with CI in all but the first age group (2-4
years of age). This may relate to ongoing develop-
mental changes for this group (cf. Okalidou et al.,
2010).

Differences in VOT values were observed as
a function of place of articulation. Both groups

age groups 1, 2, 3 & 4.

(CI/NH) present the same pattern in VOT for the
different places of articulation. For children in
all subgroups, there was a tendency for the VOT
duration of voiceless stops to increase from bil-
abials/dentals to velars, which is consistent with
previous studies reporting longer VOT duration
the further back the closure is produced (Peterson
and Lehiste, 1960; Klatt, 1975; Fourakis, 1986;
Volaitis and Miller, 1992; Cho and Ladefoged,
1999; Whiteside and Marshall, 2001; Nicolaidis,
2002; Morris et al., 2008). For voiced consonants,
there was a tendency for the VOT duration to de-
crease from bilabials to dentals to velars which is
also in agreement with previous studies (Helgason
and Ringen, 2008).

5 Conclusion

Overall our results showed a tendency for longer
VOT duration for the voiceless stops produced
by children with NH than CI and longer prevoic-
ing for the children with CI compared to their
NH peers. Few statistically significant differences
were however found in an analysis by place of ar-
ticulation and for different age subgroups.

Work currently underway aims to relate findings
to the duration of CI use, to the speech perception
abilities of children with CI, and to explore sub-
ject variability as well as variability due to other
factors including different vowel contexts.
