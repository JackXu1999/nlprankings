Abstract

Emotion Representation Mapping (ERM) has the goal to convert existing emotion ratings from
one representation format into another one, e.g., mapping Valence-Arousal-Dominance annota-
tions for words or sentences into Ekman’s Basic Emotions and vice versa. ERM can thus not only
be considered as an alternative to Word Emotion Induction (WEI) techniques for automatic emo-
tion lexicon construction but may also help mitigate problems that come from the proliferation
of emotion representation formats in recent years. We propose a new neural network approach
to ERM that not only outperforms the previous state-of-the-art. Equally important, we present a
refined evaluation methodology and gather strong evidence that our model yields results which
are (almost) as reliable as human annotations, even in cross-lingual settings. Based on these re-
sults we generate new emotion ratings for 13 typologically diverse languages and claim that they
have near-gold quality, at least.

1 Introduction

From its inception, researchers in the field of sentiment analysis aimed at predicting the affective state
that is typically associated with a given word based on a list of linguistic features, a problem referred to
as word emotion induction (WEI) (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Turney and Littman, 2003).
Early research activities have focused on semantic polarity (the positiveness or negativeness of a feeling)
for quite a long time. But more recently this focus on binary representations has been replaced by more
expressive emotion representation formats such as Basic Emotions or Valence-Arousal-Dominance. In
the meantime, WEI has become an active area of research, regularly featured in shared tasks (Rosenthal
et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2016b). Based on these achievements, WEI techniques have become a natural
methodological choice for the automatic construction of emotion lexicons (Köper and Schulte im Walde,
2016; Shaikh et al., 2016).

Yet, only very recently, a radically different approach to automatic emotion lexicon construction has
been proposed. Instead of relying on linguistic features (such as similarity with seed words or word em-
beddings), the goal of emotion representation mapping (ERM) is to derive new emotional word ratings
in one format based on known ratings of the same words in another format (Buechel and Hahn, 2017a).
For example, ERM could use empirically gathered ratings for Basic Emotions and convert them into a
Valence-Arousal-Dominance representation scheme, with greater precision than currently achievable by
WEI algorithms. As a much appreciated side effect, one of the promises of ERM is to make otherwise
incompatible resources (lexicons or annotated corpora, as well as tools) compatible, and incomparable
systems comparable. Thus, this approach has the potential to mitigate some of the negative effects that
arise from not having a community-wide standard for emotion annotation and representation (Calvo and
Mac Kim, 2013; Buechel and Hahn, 2018a).

We here want to contribute to this endeavor by providing a large-scale evaluation of previously pro-
posed ERM approaches for four typologically diverse languages and report evidence that ERM clearly

outperforms current state-of-the-art WEI algorithms. Furthermore, we present our own deep learning
model which performs even better against all competitors. Most importantly, however, we propose a
new methodology for comparing the reliability of ERM against human annotation reliability, a major
shortcoming of previous work. As a result, we find that our proposed model performs competitive to
a reasonably large group of human raters, even in cross-lingual settings. Based on this evidence, we
automatically construct emotion lexicons for 13 languages and claim that they have (near) gold quality.
These lexicons as well as our experimental code base and results are publically available.1

Psychological Models of Emotion. Models
of emotion typically fall into two main groups,
namely discrete (or categorical) and dimen-
sional ones (Stevenson et al., 2007; Calvo and
Mac Kim, 2013). Discrete models are built
around particular sets of emotional categories
deemed fundamental and universal. Ekman
(1992), for instance, identifies six Basic Emo-
tions (Joy, Anger, Sadness, Fear, Disgust and
Surprise). In contrast, dimensional models con-
sider emotions to be composed out of several in-
fluencing factors (mainly two or three). These
are often referred to as Valence (corresponding
to the concept of polarity), Arousal (a calm–
excited scale), and Dominance (perceived de-
gree of control over a (social) situation)—the
VAD model. The last dimension, Dominance,
is quite often omitted, thus constituting the VA
model. For convenience, both will be jointly re-
ferred to as VA(D). An illustration of VAD and
its relationship to Basic Emotions is given in Figure 1.

Lexical Data Sets. In contradistinction to NLP where many different representation formats for emo-
tions are being used, lexical resources originating from psychology labs almost exclusively subscribe
either to VA(D) or Basic Emotions models (typically omitting Surprise; the BE5 format). Over the years,
a considerable number of resources built on these premises have emerged from psychological research
for various languages.2 In more detail, these lexical ratings have been gathered via questionnaire studies
by collecting individual ratings from a large number of subjects for each lexical item under consideration
(typically between 20 to 30 individual ratings per item). These individual assessments are then averaged
to yield aggregated scores on which we base our experiments. The emotion values we deal with must
thus be understood as an average emotional reaction when presenting a lexical stimulus to a group of
human judges.

In this paper, we restrict ourselves to the VA(D) and BE5 format. Following the conventions
of the emotion lexicons used in our experiments (Table 1), each VA(D) dimension receives a value
from the interval [1, 9] where ‘1’ means “most negative/calm/submissive”, ‘9’ means “most posi-
tive/excited/dominant” and ‘5’ means “neutral”. Conversely, values for BE5 categories range in the
interval [1, 5] where ‘1’ means “absence” and ‘5’ means “most extreme” expression of the respective
emotion.3 Consequently, the VA(D) and BE5 formats are conceptually different from one another inso-
far as VA(D) dimensions are bi-polar, whereas BE5 categories are uni-polar.

2See, e.g., Tables 1 and 6. An enhanced list of these and similar data sets is provided in Buechel and Hahn (2018a).
3Although these intervals are fairly well established conventions, in some data sets different rating scales were used, never-

theless. In these cases, we linearly transformed the ratings so that they match the defined intervals.

Word Emotion Induction. Automatically constructing such word-level emotion data sets has been a
focus of NLP-based sentiment analysis studies from the beginning. In fact, the problem to automatically
predict polarity or emotion scores for a given word based on some linguistic features—often referred to
as Word Emotion Induction (WEI)—is already dealt with in the seminal work of Hatzivassiloglou and
McKeown (1997). At first, the features taken into account were typically derived from co-occurrence or
terminology-based similarity with a small set of seed word with known emotional scores (Turney and
Littman, 2003; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005). Nowadays, these features are almost completely replaced
by word embeddings, i.e., dense, low-dimensional vector representations of words that are trained on
large volumes of raw text in an unsupervised manner. WORD2VEC (Mikolov et al., 2013), GLOVE
(Pennington et al., 2014) and FASTTEXT (Bojanowski et al., 2017) are among today’s most popular
algorithms for generating embeddings.

WEI algorithms constitute a natural baseline for ERM because, first, they produce the same out-
put (emotion ratings for words according to some emotion representation format), yet their predictions
are based on expressively weaker features (word embeddings instead of emotion ratings for the same
word but in another format), thus constituting a harder task. Second, they form the currently prevailing
paradigm for the automatic construction of emotion lexicons (Köper and Schulte im Walde, 2016; Shaikh
et al., 2016), a problem for which ERM offers a promising alternative.

ues in VAD (second column group) and BE5 (third
column group) format. VAD scores are taken from
Warriner et al. (2013), BE5 scores were automatically
derived (see Section 4.4).

Emotion Representation Mapping. In con-
trast to WEI, ERM is based on the condition
that the pairs of data sets in Table 1 are com-
plementary in the sense that, when combining
these lexicons, a subset of their entries are then
encoded in both emotion formats, i.e., VA(D)
and BE5. This condition is illustrated for three
lexical items in Table 2.

Although such complementary data sets
have been available for quite some time, ERM
has only recently been introduced to NLP by
Buechel and Hahn (2016) in order to compare a newly proposed VAD-based prediction system against
previously established results on Basic Emotion gold standards. In a follow-up study, Buechel and Hahn
(2017b) devised EMOBANK, a VAD-annotated corpus which, in part, also bears BE5 ratings on the
sentence level. They found that both kinds of annotation were highly predictive for each other using a
k-Nearest-Neighbor approach. In later studies, they examined the potential of ERM as a substitute for
manual annotation of lexical items, also in cross-lingual settings (Buechel and Hahn, 2017a; Buechel
and Hahn, 2018a). Although their evaluation was limited in expressiveness, they already found evidence
that ERM may be comparable to human performance in terms of the quality of the resulting ratings.

Similar work has, to the best of our knowledge, only been done in the psychology domain. How-
ever, related work from this area does not target the goal of predictive modeling (Stevenson et al., 2007;
Pinheiro et al., 2017). In both contributions, linear regression models were fitted to predict VAD di-



2895

mensions given BE5 categories and vice versa. Yet, this was mainly done to inspect the respective
slope-coefficients as an indicator of the relationship of dimensions and categories. Thus, the overall
goodness of the fit was not in the center of interest and was not even reported by Stevenson et al. (2007).

3 Methods

Let L := {w1, w2, ..., wn} be a set of words. Let s,t denote two distinct emotion representation formats
such that both emos(wi) ∈ R|s| and emot(wi) ∈ R|t| describe the emotion vector associated with
wi relative to s and t, respectively, where |s|, |t| denote the number of variables which each format
employs (e.g., 3 for VAD and 5 for BE5). The task we address in this paper is to predict the target
emotion ratings T := {emot(wi)| wi ∈ L} given the set L and the corresponding source emotion
ratings S := {emos(wi)| wi ∈ L}. Performance will be measured as Pearson correlation r between
the predicted values and human gold ratings (one r-value per element of the target representation). In
general, the Pearson correlation between two data seriesX := x1, x2, ..., xn and Y := y1, y2, ..., yn takes
values between +1 (perfect positive correlation) and −1 (perfect negative correlation) and is computed
as

rxy :=

∑n
i=1(xi − x̄)(yi − ȳ)√∑n

i=1(xi − x̄)2
√∑n

i=1(yi − ȳ)2
(1)

where x̄ and ȳ denote the mean values for X and Y , respectively.

3.1 Reference Methods
The first method against which we will compare our proposed model is linear regression (LR) as used
by Stevenson et al. (2007) in their early study. LR predicts an emotion value in the target representation
t as the affine transformation

emotLR(wi) := W emo
s(wi) + b (2)

where W is a |t| × |s| matrix and b is a |t| × 1 vector. The model parameters are fitted using ordinary
least squares. In contrast, Buechel and Hahn (2017b) proposed the use of k-Nearest-Neighbor Regression
(KNN) for ERM. This simple supervised approach predicts the target value as

emotKNN(wi) :=
1

k

∑
wi′∈NEAREST(wi,k,S)

emot(wi
′) (3)

where NEAREST yields the k nearest neighbors of wi in the training set (determined by the Euclidean
distance between the source representations of two words). The k parameter was fixed to 20 based on a
pilot study.4 We used the scikit-learn.org implementation for both LR and KNN.

3.2 Proposed Model: A Multi-Task Feed-Forward Neural Network for ERM
Despite the fact that the above set-ups already perform quite well for ERM (see Section 4), both LR and
KNN are rather basic types of models lacking deeper sophistication. As a consequence, we here propose
the use of Feed-Forward Neural Networks5 (FFNNs) for ERM which have been shown to be capable of
approximating arbitrary functions, in theory at least (Hornik, 1991). In general, an FFNN consists of an
input layer with activation a(0) := emos(wi) ∈ R|s| followed by multiple hidden layers with activation
a(l+1) := σ(W (l+1)a(l) + b(l+1)) where W (l+1) and b(l+1) are the weights and biases for layer l+ 1 and
σ is a nonlinear activation function. Since the emotion formats under scrutiny capture affective states as
real-valued vectors, the activation on the output layer aout (where out is the number of non-input layers
in the network) is computed as the affine transformation

emotFFNN(wi) := a
(out) := W (out)a(out−1) + b(out) (4)

4In contrast, Buechel and Hahn (2017a) determined k for each lexicon individually based on a dev set. Now, we deviate
from this approach since it is inapplicable for the cross-lingual lexicon construction presented in Section 4.4.

5Note that applying neural architectures currently popular for other NLP tasks is not advisable because of the simplicity of
our input data (feature vectors of length 2 to 5). These more complex architectures are instead designed for, e.g., sequential
data (such as the RNN family) or spatially arranged data (such as CNNs).



2896

Consequently, our model differs from the other approaches presented in this section by sharing model
parameters (weights and biases of the hidden layers) across the different dimensions/categories of the
target format with only the last layer having parameters which are uniquely associated to one of the
outputs (see Equation 4). This can be considered as a mild form of multi-task learning (Caruana, 1997),
a machine learning technique which has been shown to strongly decrease the risk of overfitting (Baxter,
1997) and also speeds up computation by greatly decreasing the number of tunable parameters compared
to training individual layers for each affective dimension/category.

The remaining specifications of our model are as follows. We train two-hidden layer FFNNs (both
with 128 units), ReLU activation, .2 dropout on the hidden layers (none on the input layer)6 and Mean-
Squared-Error loss. Each model was trained for 10, 000 iterations (well beyond convergence, indepen-
dently of the size of the training set) using the ADAM optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2015). Keras.io
was used for implementation.

3.3 Baseline: Word Emotion Induction
As a natural baseline for ERM, we will use a recent state-of-the-art method for word emotion induc-
tion (WEI) by Du and Zhang (2016).7 They propose Feed-Forward Neural Networks (similar to our
proposed model for ERM) in combination with a boosting algorithm. The authors used FFNNs with a
single hidden layer of 100 units and ReLU activation. The boosting algorithm ADABOOST.R2 (Drucker,
1997) was used to train the ensemble (one per target variable). We implemented this approach with
scikit-learn using exactly the same settings as in the original publication.8 As for the word em-
beddings this method needs as input, we used the pre-trained FASTTEXT embeddings that Facebook
Research makes available for a wide range of languages trained on the respective Wikipedias.9 This way,
we hope to achieve a particularly high level of comparability across languages because, for each of them,
embeddings are trained on data from the same domain and of a similar order of magnitude.10

3.4 Comparison to Human Reliability
Since common metrics for Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA), such as Cohen’s Kappa, are not applicable
for real-valued emotion scores (Carletta, 1996), we will now discuss how to compare our own results
against human assessments in order to put their reliability on a safe ground.

One possible point of comparison that has been used in previous work (Buechel and Hahn, 2017a;
Buechel and Hahn, 2018a) is inter-study reliability (ISR), i.e., the correlation between the ratings of
common words in different data sets. However, this procedure comes with a number of downsides. First,
the number of pairs of data sets with substantially overlapping entries is rather small since researchers
focus mainly on acquiring ratings for novel words instead of gathering annotations anew for ones already
covered. Thus, employing ISR comparison with human performance is only possible on few data sets. In
particular, we are not aware of any pair of data sets with significantly overlapping BE5 ratings. Second,
ISR is sensitive to differences in acquisition methodologies (e.g., alternative sets of instructions or rating
scales) and may thus vary substantially between different pairs of data sets.

As an alternative, these shortcomings lead us to propose split-half reliability (SHR) as a new basis
for our comparison. SHR is computed by splitting all individual ratings for each of the items into two
groups. These individual ratings are then averaged for both groups and the Pearson correlation between
the group averages is computed. The whole processes is repeated (typically 100 times) with random
splits before averaging the results from each iteration (Mohammad and Bravo-Marquez, 2017). Thus, an

6We found the usual recommendation of .2 on input and .5 on hidden layers (Srivastava et al., 2014) too high given the
small number of features in our task (2 to 5).

7In our most recent contribution featuring a large-scale evaluation of many current WEI approaches on numerous data sets,
we found that among the existing ones the model proposed by Du and Zhang (2016) performs best, only beaten by our own,
newly proposed model (Buechel and Hahn, 2018b). Note that even compared to this more advanced approach to WEI, the
performance figures we report here for ERM still remain much higher (see Section 4). Hence, the claim of this paper that ERM
is superior to WEI, remains valid even despite most recent achievements for the latter task.

Buechel and Hahn (2018b).



2897

important difference between SHR and ISR is that the former is computed on a single data set whereas
the latter requires two different data sets with overlapping items. On the other hand, ISR can be computed
on the final ratings alone, whereas SHR requires knowledge of the judgments of the individual raters.
Most often, these individual ratings are not distributed. Yet, luckily, SHR values are commonly reported
when publishing emotion lexicons (see below).

Still, both SHR and ISR—as well as other popular approaches to reliability estimation for numerical
emotion scores, e.g., the leave-one-out approach presented by Strapparava and Mihalcea (2007)—are
heavily influenced by the number of participants of a study. For SHR, this is intuitively clear because
with enough subjects, both groups should yield reliable estimates of the true population mean ratings,
leading to very high correlation values between the groups. As a result, by splitting the number of raters
into two groups for the SHR estimate, this technique will on average produce lower correlation values
than if the study was repeated with the full number of participants and correlation between the first and
second study had been computed (test-retest reliability). To counterbalance this effect, when reporting
SHR values, authors often turn to Spearman-Brown adjustment (SBA; Vet et al. (2017)), a technique
which estimates the reliability r∗ of a study if the number of subjects was increased by the factor k:

r∗ :=
k r

1 + (k − 1) r
(5)

were r is the empirically measured SHR and k is set to 2 for the use case discussed above (virtually
doubling the number participants).

Since some authors of the data sets in Table 1 apply SBA while others do not, the reported SHR values
must be normalized to guarantee a consistent evaluation. Going one step further, we can even apply
SBA to normalize the reported values with respect to the number of participants in a given study, thus
establishing an even more consistent ground for evaluation.

Table 3: Normalized split-half reliabilities for VAD and

cates that reliability has not been reported.

We chose the normalized number of
participants to be 20, i.e., the adjusted
scores (reported in Table 3) estimate
the empirical SHR values, if the given
study was conducted with 20 participants
(the average correlation between two ran-
domly assigned groups of 10 raters). Nor-
malization was conducted by applying
Equation (5) to the reported values with
k := N∗/N , if SBA was not already ap-
plied, or k := N∗/(2 × N), if SBA was
already applied to the reported values; N
being the actual number of participants
and N∗ := 20 being the normalized number of participants.

It is important to note that the decision for N∗ = 20 is necessarily arbitrary, to some degree, with
higher SHR estimates arising from higher values of N∗. However, 20 raters are often used in psycho-
logical studies (Warriner et al., 2013; Stadthagen-Gonzalez et al., 2017b), while being way higher than
the number of raters typically used in NLP for emotion annotation, both for the word and sentence level
(Yu et al., 2016a; Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2007). Thus, we argue that this choice constitutes a rather
challenging line of comparison for our system.

Since model performance will be measured in terms of Pearson correlation (see above), the perfor-
mance figures achieved on the gold data can be compared with the adjusted SHR (also based on correla-
tion). We can interpret cases where the former outperforms the latter as the model agreeing more with the
gold data than two random groups of ten annotators would agree with each other. Thus, for these cases
we say our model achieves super-human performance, as it cannot be expected that a well-conducted
annotation study leads to more reliable results.

Figure 2: Relative importance of the affec-

vs. omitting the one under scrutiny.

Previous work has limited itself to data sets compris-
ing all three VAD dimensions with the implicit be-
lief that Dominance provides valuable affective infor-
mation which is important for ERM. However, since
only about half of the data sets developed in psy-
chology labs (and even less provided by NLP groups)
actually do comprise Dominance, this decision mas-
sively decreases the amount of data sets at hand. To
resolve this dilemma, the following experiment aims
at quantifying the relative importance of the different
affective variables of the VAD and the BE5 format.

Our set-up works as follows: For each data set
from Table 1 that includes the Dominance dimen-
sion, we trained one LR model11 (Section 3.1) to map
VAD to BE5 and another one to map BE5 to VAD
(‘dim2cat’ and ‘cat2dim’ for short) applying 10-fold
cross-validation. The resulting performance measure-
ments were averaged over all data sets.

We then repeated this procedure once for each VAD
dimension (when mapping dim2cat) and each BE5 category (when mapping cat2dim), omitting one of
the dimensions/categories from the source representation in every iteration, thus constituting a kind of
ablation experiment. Next, for each of the “incomplete” models, we computed the difference between
its performance and the performance of the “complete” model (not lacking any of the variables). Now,
we can use this loss of performance as an estimate of the relative importance of the respective left-out
dimension or category. The results of this experiment are depicted in Figure 2.

As can be seen, regarding VAD, Valence is by far the most important dimension with a performance
drop of .12 when ablating it. In turn, Arousal, the second-best dimension only increases performance by
.04, whereas Dominance contributes to less than .01 of the performance. Similarly, for Basic Emotions,
Joy is the most important category, although BE5 seems to distribute the affective information more
equally across its variables (with the exception of Disgust which contributes far less than .01 to the
performance).

Since our data suggest that Dominance plays only a minor role within the VAD framework, we will
not limit our further experiments to data sets including this dimension—as it was done in previous work
(Section 2)—but rather include the large variety of bi-representational data sets which leave it out (see
Table 1).

4.2 Monolingual Representation Mapping

In this experiment, we compared the performance of the WEI baseline, the LR- and KNN-based reference
methods for ERM and our newly proposed FFNN model. For each of these methods and data sets in
Table 1, we trained one model to map cat2dim and another one to map dim2cat (for the ERM methods)
or to predict VA(D) ratings and BE5 ratings based on word embeddings for the WEI baseline. The
whole process was conducted using 10-fold cross-validation where we used identical train/test splits
for all methods.12 The results of this experiment are displayed in Table 4a, only showing the average
values over VA(D) and BE5, respectively, but allowing for an easy comparison between the different
approaches.

11Linear regression was used because it does not comprise any hyperparameters that might heavily influence the outcome of
this experiment (thus leading to greater generality of the results).

12This procedure constitutes a more direct comparison than using different splits for each method and allows paired t-tests.

Table 4: Results of the monolingual experiment.

As can be seen, all of the ERM
approaches (LR, KNN, FFNN) per-
form more than 10%-points bet-
ter than the state of the art in
word emotion induction (WEI) for
VAD prediction and at least about
5%-points better for BE5 predic-
tions (on average over all data sets
and affective variables). This find-
ing already strongly suggests that
ERM is the superior approach for
automatic lexicon creation, given
that the required data are avail-
able. This might be especially use-
ful in situations where, say, large
VAD but only small BE5 lexicons
are available for a given language
(see Section 4.4). Regarding the
ordering of the ERM approaches,
KNN outperforms LR in almost
all cases. The advantage is more
pronounced for mapping dim2cat
(2.5%-points difference on aver-
age) than cat2dim (.4%-points dif-
ference). On top of that, our pro-
posed FFNN model outperforms
KNN by a 1.2%-point margin for
cat2dim and a .8%-point margin for
dim2cat (again as average over all
data sets) performing best on each
single data set. Regarding the 16
cases of Table 4a (8 data sets times two mapping directions), the performance gain of FFNN compared
to the respective second best system is statistically significant13 in all but 2 cases. The differences be-
tween the individual ERM approaches might appear quite small, yet become a lot more meaningful
considering the proximity to human annotation capabilities as discussed in the following paragraphs.

Table 4b displays the performance figures of the FFNN model relative to each affective variable. As
can be seen, among VAD, Valence is the easiest dimension to predict (r = .956 on average over all
data sets) whereas for Arousal the performance is worst . Similarly, for BE5, Joy obtains the best values
(r = .932) and Disgust is the hardest to predict. Interestingly, the overall ordering of performance within
the two formats is consistent with the ordering of human reliability (see Table 3).

Comparing our system performance against human SHR (based on 20 participants per study; see
Section 3.4), again our approach seems to be highly reliable (color coding of Table 4b). In particular,
ERM using the FFNN model outperforms SHR in over half of the applicable cases (25 of 38). For
mapping cat2dim it surpasses human reliability in all but 2 cases whereas when mapping dim2cat the
reported SHR is surpassed in over half of the cases (14 out of 25).

This result, astonishing as it might appear, is yet consistent with findings from previous work which,
in turn, were based on ISR (not on SHR) data (Buechel and Hahn, 2017a; Buechel and Hahn, 2018a). We
conclude that in the monolingual set-up, ERM using the FFNN model substantially outperforms current
capacities in word emotion induction and is even more reliable than a medium sized human rating study.
Thus these automatically produced ratings should be cautiously attributed gold standard quality.

Table 5: Results of crosslingual experiment in Pearson
r. Color indicates outperforming human SHR ( blue ),
being outperformed ( red ) or SHR not being reported
(white).

In the crosslingual set-up, we make use of
the fact that our model does not rely on any
language-specific information, since the cat-
egories/dimensions describe supposedly uni-
versal affective states rather than linguistic
entities. Thus, models trained on one lan-
guage could, in theory, be applied to another
one without any need for adaptation. This ca-
pability comes in handy when only data sets
according to one emotion format exist for a
given language. In such cases we could still
train our model on data available for other
languages and use it to produce new ratings
for the language in focus. This section aims
at estimating the performance of lexicons de-
rived in this manner.

For each of the data sets in Table 1, we trained FFNN models to map cat2dim and dim2cat, respec-
tively. We trained on each gold lexicon that did not cover the language of the data set under scrutiny
(e.g., for testing on en 1, the models were trained on all Spanish, Polish and German data sets, but not
on en 2). Since this set-up leads to fixed train and test sets, we did not perform cross-validation. For
comparability between data sets, the Dominance dimension was excluded for this experiment.

Overall, the results remained astonishingly stable compared to the monolingual set-up, with perfor-
mance figures for Valence and Joy dropping by less than 1%-point on average over all data sets (see
Table 5). Also, Anger, Sadness, Fear and Disgust only suffer a moderate decrease of about 5%-points at
most—only the performance of Arousal decreased more than that.

A possible explanation for these strong results is the marked increase in the amount of training data
that comes along with training on the majority of the available data (independent of language). This
circumstance seems to counterbalance much of the negative effects that may arise in this crosslingual
applications.

In comparison to SHR, the ERM approach still turns out to work quite well. Regarding VA, we
outperform human reliability in 8 of 10 cases. Concerning BE5, SHR was beaten in about half of the
cases (11 of 25). We conclude that, although the capability of our mapping approach suffers a bit in the
crosslingual set-up, it still produces very accurate predictions and can thus be attested near gold quality,
at least.

4.4 Automatic Lexicon Construction for Diverse Languages

After the positive evaluation of the FFNN model for ERM, the last bit of our contributions is to apply
the created models to a wide variety of data sets which so far bear emotion ratings for one format only
(either VA(D) or BE5). Based on the experiments reported so far, we claim that these have gold quality
(for the monolingual approach, Section 4.2) or near-gold quality (for the crosslingual approach, Section
4.3).

For the monolingual approach, we train our model on the data set on which we achieved the highest
performance in Section 4.2 for the respective language (assuming this hints at particularly “clean” data).
In contrast, in the crosslingual set-up, training data are acquired by concatenating all the available data
sets from Table 1 (consequently ignoring Dominance for compatibility).

Table 6 lists the emotion lexicons constructed in this manner together with their most important char-
acteristics. The number of new ratings ranges from almost 13,000 (for English) and 10,500 (for Spanish),
over several thousands (for Dutch, Chinese and Polish, ) and around 1,500–1,000 (for Indonesian, Italian,
Portuguese, Greek, French and German) to 200–100 (for Finnish and Swedish). For illustration, Table 2
displays three entries of the English BE5 lexicon, the largest one we constructed.

Table 6: Overview of automatically constructed emotion lexi-
cons; mapping methodology (monolingual or crosslingual), lan-
guage (codes according to ISO 639-1), target emotion format,
source lexicon of the mapping process and number of previously
unknown ratings (excluding those present in other lexicons).

In this paper, we addressed the rel-
atively new task of emotion repre-
sentation mapping. It aims at trans-
forming emotion ratings for lexical
units from one emotion representa-
tion format into another one, e.g.,
mapping from Valence-Arousal-
Dominance representations to Ba-
sic Emotion ones. Based on a
large-scale evaluation we gathered
solid empirical evidence that the
proposed neural network model
consistently outperforms the pre-
vious state-of-the-art performance
figures in both word emotion in-
duction and emotion representation
mapping. Hence, the approach we
propose currently constitutes the
best-performing method for auto-
matic emotion lexicon creation.

We also proposed a novel methodology for comparison against human rating capabilities based on
normalized split-half reliability scores. For the first time, this allows for a large-scale evaluation against
human performance. Our experimental data suggest that our models perform competitive relative to
human assessments, even in cross-lingual applications, thus producing (near) gold quality data. We take
this as a strong hint towards the reliability of the methods we propose.

Finally, we used these models to produce new emotion lexicons for 13 typologically diverse languages
which are publicly available along with our code and experimental data (see Footnote 1).
