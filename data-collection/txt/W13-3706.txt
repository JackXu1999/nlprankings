Abstract 

This article presents a new approach of us-

ing dependency treebanks in theoretical syn-

tactic research: the view of dependency 

treebanks as combined networks. This al-

lows the usage of advanced tools for net-

work analysis that quite easily provide novel 

insight into the syntactic structure of lan-

guage. As an example of this approach, we 

will show how the network approach can 

provide clear structural distinctions among 

the Chinese function words, which are very 

difficult to obtain directly from the original 

treebank. We hope to illustrate the enor-

mous potential of the language network ap-

proach through a simple example. 

1 Why treebanks? 

Treebanks are the latest hype in linguistics. 

The interest in treebanks can roughly be ex-

plained by two main charms: the NLP push to 

data driven approaches and the linguist’s fas-

cination of creating a treebank following spe-

cific theoretical principles. 

In greater detail, we can observe that Natu-

ral Language Processing requires treebanks for 

all kinds of data-driven approaches ranging 

from Machine Translation to text classification. 

Great efforts, monetary and personal, go into 

the creation of treebanks or the transformation 

of existing treebanks into new formats. In par-

ticular dependency treebanks offer interesting 

connections between texts and the representa-

tion of meaning, the ultimate goal of Computa-

tional Linguistics. This NLP interest in de-

pendency treebanks has also enthused (and 

frequently financed) the community of “pure” 

linguists, who have discovered that the crea-

tion of coherent treebanks is linguistically 

challenging and fascinating. Work has been 

done on error detection (Dickinson & Meurers 

2003), alignment of multilingual (Lopez et al. 

2002) and of multi-stratal treebanks (Böhmová 

et al. 2003; Mille & Wanner 2010), on written 

and spoken data, just to name a few. The crea-

tion of a treebank can also have a unifying ef-

fect on a linguistic community by providing a 

reference analysis, other analysis have to be 

compared to (Penn Tree Bank, Marcus et al. 

1993). But the creation of a treebank following 

a specific syntactic theory cannot in itself be 

considered as a confirmation of this theory 

(other than being a sociological proof of the 

existence of sufficient support for the theory to 

be able to create a treebank). 

What is crucially missing in this picture is 

the usage of treebanks for linguistic discovery 

and theory confirmation or refutation that goes 

beyond searching for examples in the annotat-

ed data. Simple concordancers exist, some of 

them with sophisticated query languages (Zel-

des et al. 2009) but it is up to the syntactician 

to go through the results and make conclusions. 

No generally accepted approach on how to 

interpret this type of data has been established. 

The community of “corpus linguistics” is 

nearly exclusively busy with statistical analysis 

on pure text corpora, using tools like Word-

smith or Lexico3. At most, they use POS 

tagged corpora, often simply to disambiguate 

word usages. This domain of research has 

achieved impressive results in historical lin-

guistics, sociolinguistics, and other domains 

where large amounts of data finally are sys-

tematically ploughed through (Baker 1993; 

Charteris-Black 2004). However, the men-

tioned tools and methods can not easily be ap-

plied to treebanks because first, the structure of 

the data is very different, and secondly, the 

limited size of treebanks compared to the vast 

amounts of unannotated text, makes a statisti-

cal approach less interesting. 

Notable exceptions to this rule include work 

on usually small hand-coded treebanks like the 

ones used in Liu et al. (2009) for the study of 

dependency distance and in Liu (2009a) for the 

research of probability distribution of depend-

encies, where the traditional statistical ap-

proaches have shown their potential in theoret-

ic syntactic research. As an emerging statistical 

method, the network approach brings a new 

angle to this type of research. 

In this paper, we attempt to illuminate the 

network view of dependency treebanks. We 

will show how this approach reduces the diffi-

41



culties in exploiting treebank data and how this 

approach can be successfully applied to small 

dependency treebanks, reducing the size limi-

tations of existing dependency treebanks. 

2 Language networks 

The basic idea underlying dependency net-

works is very simple: instead of viewing the 

trees as linearly aligned on the sentences of the 

corpus, we fuse together each occurrence of 

the same word to a unique node, thus creating 

a unique and (commonly) connected network 

of words, in which the tokens are the vertices 

and dependency relations are the edges or arcs. 

This connected network is then ready to un-

dergo common network analysis with tools 

like UCINET (Borgatti et al. 2002), PAJEK 

(Nooy et al. 2005), NETDRAW (Borgatti 

2002), CYTOSCAPE (Shannon 2003), and so 

on. 

In reality, extracting a network from a de-

pendency treebank is slightly more complicat-

ed, as we have to use some heuristics to fuse 

together only the words that belong to the 

same lexeme (same category, near meaning). 

We refer to Liu (2008) for a description of 

multiple ways of network creation from de-

pendency treebanks.  

Linguistic research with using modern net-

work analysis tools is an upcoming domain. 

The first conference on this subject, Modeling 

Linguistic Networks, was held in December 

2012 in Frankfurt and united nearly 40 schol-

ars from 14 countries. This community is 

guided by two assumptions: First, Language is 

physiognomicly a network and modeling of 

language should follow this guiding principle, 

and secondly, computational tools that have 

proven to be successful in sociology and com-

puter science can be used for language net-

works, too.  

The key interest of the network approach in 

linguistic research is that it provides a new 

way to analyze language systems. A central 

assumption of modern linguistic theories is 

that language is a system (Kretzschmar 2009). 

This widely accepted point of view, however, 

has remained on a purely theoretic level due to 

the absence of an operational methodology, 

until corpora and modern network analysis 

tools appeared. As language is a system, we 

expect there to be rules that cannot be predict-

ed directly on the basis of the units. So looking 

at some specific words (or the relationship be-

tween them) may not be an efficient way for 

discovering the global features of a language 

system. Modeling language as a network pro-

vides an operational way for observing the 

macroscopic features of language system and 

the relationship between the units and the 

whole system. For example, it can be used for 

determining the function or status of some 

units, such as words, in the language system as 

a whole.  

Some research has been done on the struc-

ture of syntactic dependency networks (Ferrer i 

Cancho 2005; Liu 2008; Chen & Liu 2011; 

Čech et al. 2011), the patterns in syntactic de-

pendency networks (Ferrer i Cancho 2004; 

Chen et al. 2011), the language development or 

language evolution (Ke & Yao 2008; Mukher-

jee et al. 2013; Mehler et al. 2011), language 

clustering and linguistic categorization (Liu 

2010; Liu & Cong 2013; Gong et al. 2012; 

Abramov & Mehler 2011), manual and ma-

chine translation (Amancio et al. 2008 &2011), 

word sense disambiguation (Christiano Silva & 

Raphael Amancio 2013), communication and 

interaction (Banisch et al. 2010; Mehler et al. 

2010), the structure of semantic networks 

(Borge Holthoefer & Arenas 2010; Liu 2009b), 

phonetics (Arbesman et al. 2010; Yu et al. 

2010), morphology (Čech & Mačutek 2009; 

Liu & Xu 2011), parts of speech (Ferrer i Can-

cho et al. 2007), Knowledge Networks (Allee 

2000), cognitive networks (Mehler et al. 2012).  

Works on Chinese include networks that use 

as nodes the Chinese characters (Li & Zhou 

2007; Peng et al. 2008), words and phrases (Li 

et al. 2005), phoneme and syllables (Yu et al. 

2011; Peng et al. 2008), syntactic structure 

(Liu 2008; Liu 2010; Chen & Liu 2011; Chen 

et al. 2011), semantic structure (Liu 2009b).  

In general, the language network research, 

including that on Chinese language network, is 

developing rapidly in recent years. But the 

language network research inevitably has some 

aspects that need to be improved in order to 

establish this new domain. It seems that most 

of the language networks studies put a heavy 

emphasis on common features of various net-

works, such as ‘small world’ (Watts & 

Strogatz 1998) and ‘scale-free’ (Barabási & 

Bonabeau 2003) features, treating alike differ-

ent levels of language and different concerns 

on which the networks are built. At the same 

time, many language networks were built 

without proper guide of a specific linguistic 

theory, such as words’, characters’, or phrases’

Peng et al. 2008; Liu & Sun 2007; Li et al. 

2005), resulting in research that lacks a strong 

connection to existing linguistic theories and 

research. But as more and more linguists get 

involved in the study of language networks, 

this situation is gradually changing. 

3 The Chinese Dependency Network 
for this study  

For the present work, we used the following 

treebank of Chinese: The treebank has 37,024 

tokens and is composed of 2 sections of differ-

ent styles:  

 “新闻联播” xin-wen-lian-bo ‘news feeds’ 
(name of a famous Chinese TV news 

program), hereinafter referred to as 

XWLB, is a transcription of the program. 

The text is usually read and the style of 

the language is quite formal. The section 

contains 17,061 words. 

 “实话实说” shi-hua-shi-shuo ‘straight 
talk’ (name of a famous Chinese talk 

show), hereinafter referred to as SHSS, is 

of more colloquial language type, con-

taining spontaneous speech appearing in 

interviews of people of various social 

backgrounds, ranging from farmers to 

successful businessmen, The section con-

tains 19, 963 words.  
Both sections have been annotated manually as 

described by Liu (2006). Table 1 shows the file 

format of this Chinese dependency treebank, 

which is similar to the CoNLL dependency 

format, although a bit more redundant (double 

information on the governor’s POS) to allow 

for easy exploitation of the data in a spread-

sheet and converting to language networks. 

The data can be represented as a dependency 

graph as shown in Figure 1. 

The POS and dependency annotation is done 

on the transcribed texts. As the treebank con-

tains different styles, it allows for general con-

clusions about the language, in spite of the lim-

ited size of the corpus. Another benefit of the 

double nature of the data is that we can do 

comparative work based on these 2 sections.

With words as nodes, dependencies as arcs, 

and the frequency of the dependencies as the 

value of arcs, we can build a network. For ex-

ample, the sample shown in Figure 1 can be 

converted to a network as shown in Figure 2 

(excluding punctuation).

Following the same principle, our Chinese 

treebank can be presented as Figure 3, an im-

structure of the treebank.

The resulting network has the following prop-

43



erties: it is fully connected and there are no 

isolated vertices, it is a ‘small word’ and has a 

‘scale-free’ structure. As we mentioned before, 

there are not many language characteristics 

that we can deduce directly from this big pic-

ture. What we need to do is to looki into the 

structure of some specific words in this big 

network, which in our study has brought about 

some interesting findings. The first step is to 

decide on the words we wanted to look into: 

the function words. 

4 Chinese Function Words 

Chinese is an isolating language: syntactic 

structure relies primarily on function words 

and word order rather than on rich morpholog-

ical information to encode functional relations 

between elements (Levy & Manning 2003). 

Function words are words that have little lexi-

cal meaning or have ambiguous meaning, but 

instead express grammatical relationships with 

other words within a sentence, or specify the 

attitude or mood of the speaker” (Klammer et 

al. 2000). In Chinese, function words include 

prepositions, conjunctions, and auxiliary and 

modal particles (Yu 1998). 

As in any language, function words distin-

guish themselves not only by their syntactic 

properties, but also simply by their frequency. 

The words we are interested in are among the 

most common Chinese words: 在1 zai ‘(to be 

located) in or at’, 了  le ‘perfective aspect 

marker or modal particle intensifying the pre-

ceding clause’. 

We compared the frequent function words 

shown in XWLB, SHSS, and the Modern Chi-

nese Frequency Dictionary and found that 

there are 3 function words that appear in all 

these 3 resources. They are: ‘的’ de ‘ablative 
cause suffix or possessive particle similar to 

the English genitive marker ’s’, zai and le. The 

frequency information of these 3 function 

words is shown in Table 2
2
.  

We will exclude de from this study because 

of its unique behavior
3
. We only chose zai and 

le as our research objects. 

                                                           
1 In Chinese, zai may be a verb, adverb or preposition. 

Here we only refer to the preposition. 
2 Considering the size of XWLB and SHSS, we only 

paid attention on the function words whose frequency 

is in the top 30 of all words that have shown in these 

transcriptions. 
3 In Chinese, the function word ‘的’ de ‘’s’ is a very 

special word. It can pretty much follow any language 

unit and construct a so-called de-structure, de togeth-

The differences in distribution between the two 

genres of texts are mostly based on the lexical 

poverty of spontaneous speech (SHSS) com-

pared to written style, resulting in higher fre-

quencies (of the smaller number of types) in 

the former genre. Moreover, the notably higher 

relative frequency of le in SHSS can be ex-

plained by the fact that one usage of le is an 

intensifier typical for the genre of spontaneous 

oral language. Inversely, zai can be omitted 

before locatives in oral Chinese.

5 Chinese function words in tree-
banks 

The traditional research on Chinese function 

words categorizes the linguistic units, de-

scribes which words function words can con-

nect to, and defines the relationship between 

function words and other linguistic units by 

giving some examples. This type of research 

has achieved valuable results and contributed 

to the commonly accepted classification of 

Chinese function words. But due to the lack of 

tools for collecting and processing large data, 

the examples are limited and most of them are 

not drawn from real language data either. Re-

cently, with the appearance of corpora in Chi-

nese linguistic research, these points improved 

slightly. Simple text corpora or POS tagged 

corpora can supply giant amounts of examples. 

Treebanks, however, are able to provide much 

richer structural information, of syntactic or 

semantic nature, though their size is usually 

rather limited. For studies on syntactic struc-

tures, as the present work on function words, 

treebanks are the best choice.  

                                                                                    
er with the preceding unit becoming an attribute or an 

expression referring to something or someone. Con-

sidering the complicated situations of the de-structure, 

they would require a special and extensive discussion, 

and are left for future research. 
4 In Chinese, le and zai also can be content words even 

though these phenomena are not common. The Mod-

ern Chinese Frequency Dictionary doesn’t distinguish 

these difference but we believe the deviation of the 

data won’t change the fact that these 2 function 

words are among the most common Chinese words. 

44



This paper focuses on the structural distribu-

tion of linguistic units (words, in this study), 

more specifically of the function words zai and 

le. There is similar research on Chinese with 

different concerns: Liu (2007) analyzed the 

distribution of dependency relations and de-

pendency distance in a Chinese treebank, in-

cluding but not centered on function words. 

Gao (2010) and Gao et al. (2010) described the 

syntactic functions of nouns and verbs in man-

darin Chinese, dividing syntactic functions of 

nouns and verbs into typical ones and atypical 

ones for a quantitative analysis. Chen et al. 

(2011) tried to build a model of valency pat-

tern from syntactic networks based on tree-

banks. All these works are done from the per-

spective of parts of speech instead of specific 

words. At the same time, there are several 

studies in Chinese concerned with specific 

words. For example, Liu and Liu (2011) have 

engaged in a study on the evolution process of 

the syntactic valency of the verb. They con-

structed three corpora of ancient classical Chi-

nese, ancient vernacular and the modern ver-

nacular, and selected ten verbs as the objects of 

their study to ascertain the diachronic behavior 

of these words. Even though they analyzed the 

complements and modifications of the words, 

they failed to give specific information about 

the complements and modifications, only dis-

tinguishing single word units from more com-

plicated linguistic units. In contrast, our study 

provided more information of the words that 

can connect with zai and le. 

We analyzed the distribution of the depend-

ents and governors of zai and le in XWLB and 

SHSS. The results are shown in Table 3 and 

Table 4. 

Note that the genre differences are visible 

for both words: The governors of zai are very 

similarly diversely distributed for both genres 

but in spontaneous speech, the dependents of 

zai are much more diverse than in written style. 

Compared to zai, le has simpler combinatory 

possibilities (and no dependents), and here, the 

governors are more diverse in spontaneous 

speech than in written style. 

Comparing these two words, we can see that, 

in general, zai can relate to more types of part 

of speech than le. However, it is not easy to 

interpret these tables and we will see that when 

passing to a network representation, the differ-

ences become much more easily accessible.

6 Network properties of Chinese func-
tion words 

6.1 Properties of ‘在’ zai and ‘了’ le 

With the XWLB and SHSS syntactic networks, 

we studied the most frequently used network 

parameter of the words, the degree: The de-

gree of a vertex (a word) refers to the number 

of its neighbors. This variable actually de-

scribes the number of different word types 

which are connected with a specific word. The 

directions of the arcs distinguish between 

indegree and outdegree. The indegree of a 

word is the number of arcs it receives while the 

outdegree is the number of arcs it sends. Re-

formulated linguistically, the indegree reflects 

the number of governors of a word and the 

outdegree, the number of the word’s depend-

ents. In our network, these two function words 

have the following properties in Table 5. 

Although the size of the original sections of 

XWLB and SHSS in the treebank is similar (in 

tokens), the size of the XWLB and SHSS net-

45



 
Figure 4. The sub-network of ‘在’ zai and its neighbors in the XWLB network 

 

works is quite different due to the difference in 

the lexical richness. In order to make the data 

more comparable, we standardized the original 

data, also shown in Table 5. The table clearly 

shows that: le has a zero outdegree because it 

cannot govern other words in our analysis of 

Chinese while zai has both indegree and out-

degree; Besides, le’s degree is higher in SHSS 

than XWLB which states that the combinatory 

possibilities of le is more diverse in spontane-

ous speech. On the contrary the distribution of 

word types that zai can connect with is more 

diverse in written style, especially obvious 

when it comes to the indegree.

6.2 Network Manipulation 

To see the role that these 2 words play in the 

whole language network system, we carry out 

the following manipulations on the network: 

Since we are only concerned with the vertices 

connected to these two words, we removed all 

the vertices and arcs that are not connected to 

them. Figure 4 illustrates the graph of the re-

maining vertices and arcs of zai in XWLB. 

Actually, we tried to do the same thing based 

on the original treebank. No doubt, the idea is 

workable but it is difficult to visualize the re-

sult. Since the words, which are either the gov-

ernors or dependents of these function words, 

are numerous, it would take a very big table, 

more than 200 lines, to show all the detailed 

information. A more reasonable way to visual-

ize the data, making it more readable, is mak-

ing a graphical representation of the infor-

mation, such as a scatter diagram or a network 

diagram as the one in Figure 4. 

  In this diagram, we managed to arrange the 

words by the value of their arcs connected with 

zai. The words between circle ○A  and ○B  
labeled with smallest vertices, far away from 

the center vertex zai, only connected with zai 

once in the treebank. The lines between these 

words and zai are numbered by the frequency 

of the connection shown in the treebank. Fol-

lowing the same principle, the words between 

circle ○B  and ○C  connected with zai twice in 
the treebank, and so they are nearer to the cen-

ter vertex. The words between circle ○C  and 

○D  connected zai three times and the words in 

circle ○D , except the word zai itself, connected 
with zai more than three times in the treebank. 

The more connections there are between the 

words and zai, the bigger the size of the verti-

ces representing the words, the shorter the dis-

tance between the words and zai. In this way, 

the diagram 4 clearly shows that, even though 

zai has many neighbors, most of them seem to 

prefer visiting it just once or twice, in other 

○A  

○B  ○C  ○D  

46



 
Figure 5. The distribution of governors and dependents of the function words zai and le 

 

XWLB XWLB SHSS SHSS 

words, the number of connection is distributed 

more evenly among its neighbors. 

After removing the vertices, we combined all 

the words with the same part of speech except 

the two words we are studying. So we got a 

new “mixed language network”. It mixes two 

types of vertices, one representing a word 

while the other one representing the part of 

speech. This new graph, as shown in Figure 5, 

also included the information of Table 3 and 

Table 4. The results we got from analyzing the 

treebank can also be extracted from the lan-

guage networks. 

In this diagram, we put the arcs in different 

grayscales. The higher the value of an arc is, 

i.e. the frequency in Table 3 and Table 4, the 

darker their color, the bigger size of the verti-

ces which represent the parts of speech. It is 

even easier to get the same conclusion than 

that drawn from Table 3 and Table 4: le can 

only be a dependent while zai can be a gover-

nor and a dependent; zai can relate to more 

types of part of speech than the le, zai can re-

lated to more words in XWLB than in SHSS 

while le can related to more words in SHSS 

than in XWLB. 

Now, we can see that the main difference 

between analysing the original treebank and 

the language network is that the language net-

work can provide an easier and direct access to 

a graphic output, especially when the data is 

too complex or too big to be included in a lim-

ited table.  

So are there other facts about the language 

structure that are extremely difficult to see di-

rectly from the original treebank and that can 

be seen directly in the network? One of the 

advantages of the language network model is 

that it views the language as a connected 

whole system. Without the language network 

approach, describing the language system is 

more like talking about an unspecified abstract 

structure. The language network model gives a 

more specific structure model to the language 

system and also provides different computa-

tional tools that have proven to be successful 

in sociology and computer science, which are 

able to describe the different elements of a 

network system, or, as in our case, a language 

system. So we tried to manipulate the XWLB 

and SHSS networks to find out the roles of 

these two function words in the language net-

works systems. The way we tried actually fol-

lows a very simple logic. If you want to know 

the function of one element in a system, the 

simplest way is to remove it from the system 

and then to see what the consequences are: We 

respectively removed the vertices representing 

zai and le from XWLB and SHSS language 

networks and compared several most common 

features of the networks, the number of verti-

ces, average degree, the number of isolated 

vertices, before and after removing the vertex. 

The numbers of vertices are actually the 

numbers of word types in the treebank. Alt-

hough the sizes of XWLB and SHSS are simi-

lar, the numbers of vertices of XWLB and 

SHSS networks, or the size of the networks, 

are obviously different due to the difference of 

lexical richness.

Table 6. The network data before and after re-

moving the function words. Num: Numbers of ver-

tices, IV: Isolated Vertices, AD: Average Degree 
The isolated vertices represent the vertices 

without any neighbors. This is the interesting 

part here. According to the data, there are no 

isolated vertices after removing le. All the re-

mained vertices are still fully connected. So, if 

we believe the network somehow can be seen 

as the model of the syntactic structure of the 

language system drawn from this part of the 

treebank, then removing le seems to cause no 

significant trouble here. The whole structure 

didn’t suffer from a systematic crisis, even 

though the le was a high frequency word with 

very high degrees. At the same time, removing 

zai caused isolated vertices in both XWLB and 

SHSS networks, especially in SHSS, even 

though the zai has lower frequency than le in 

the treebank and lower degrees in the network. 

In other words, removing this word created a 

much bigger systematic crisis. The reason is 

simple: le can only be a dependent. Take a pic-

ture like diagram 6: In the simple full connect-

ed network there is a vertex A that only has 

indegree and no outdegree. Because vertex A 

only attaches to other vertices and it doesn’t 

convey any unique information between its 

neighbors, removing it from the network won’t 

render any vertex isolated. 

 
Figure 6. A simple network example  

This result fits a common sense in syntax that 

the governors are somehow more important 

than dependents when it comes to the structur-

al completion of sentences. But it is very diffi-

cult to quantify the syntactic importance, espe-

cially for the whole treebank, text or language 

systems. We see that the analyzed function 

words, which share high frequency and de-

grees, in fact play very different roles in the 

system model: As a result, it seems safe to 

claim that zai is more important than le for this 

model’s structure. The syntactic importance of 

specific words can be quantified in this way. 

Developing a numeric scale of a well-defined 

notion of “syntactic importance” is left for fu-

ture research. 

This study shows that the language network 

approach can not only provide an easier and 

direct access to getting a graphic output but 

also can bring some fresh new angles for lan-

guage analyzing. 

7 Conclusion 

This paper addresses the importance of devel-

oping techniques of treebank exploitation for 

syntactic research ranging from theorem veri-

fication to discovery of new relations invisible 

to the eye. 

We advocate in particular the usage of net-

work tools in this process and show how a 

treebank can, and, in our view, should be seen 

as a unique network.  

We have shown in more detail, by opposing 

the function words zai and le, that the frequen-

cy of words is not equivalent to the word’s 

importance in the syntactic structure, pointing 

to a notion that we may call the “centrality” of 

the word. The importance in the syntactic 

structure is still a vague notion that needs to be 

refined further, but simple network manipula-

tions like removal of the words in question can 

reveal properties of the words that seem to be 

closely related to the words’ structural roles. 

For example, a word A whose removal breaks 

the network in parts is clearly more important 

than a word B whose removal preserves the 

connectedness of the network (as the word on-

ly occupies exterior nodes). Since the results 

shown in this paper confirm well-known facts 

concerning these two function words, the same 

method can be applied to other function words 

as well content words. Ongoing research in-

cludes analyses of the Chinese equivalent of 

the following words: de ‘ablative cause suffix 

or possessive particle similar to the English 

genitive marker ’s’, wo ‘I, me, myself’, shi ‘are, 

am, yes’, ge ‘individual, entries’, yi ‘one, sin-

gle’, zhe ‘this, it,these’, bu ‘do not, need not’, 

ta ‘he, him’, shuo ‘speak, talk, say’, ren ‘per-

son, people, human being’, and dao ‘arrive, 

reach, get to’.  

We leave it for further research to develop 

the notion of “centrality” into a numerical val-

ue that would allow comparing any pair of 

words.

Equally, the active field of network analysis 

will in time reveal new techniques that have in 

turn to be applied to new and bigger language 

networks based on treebanks of different types 

and languages. This could establish network 

syntax as one branch of the emerging field of 

data-driven linguistics.
