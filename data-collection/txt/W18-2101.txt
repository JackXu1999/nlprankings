Applications of 
MT technology

Machine Translation
• Enable cross-border trade
• Translate
• Search queries
• Item titles
• Item descriptions

Browse Pages: Title Generation
• Translate name-value pairs describing items into 

natural language

How to explore 
the many items 
on eBay?

Browse Pages

Idea: 
Create permanent “browse” pages for all items & 
products within a category that share a certain set 
of name-value pairs, e.g. 
• In category “Light Bulbs”
• ”Wattage” = “9W”
• ”Bulb Shape Code” = “E27”

Users can then navigate to
• Related/refined browse pages
• Hot offers
• Individual products

=> Also beneficial for Search Engines

so many items?

Why automatic 
title generation?

Browse Pages

eBay is present 
• in dozens of countries
• with thousands of categories
• with hundreds of thousands of name-value pairs 

(products aspects aka slots)

àMillions of potential browse pages (and titles) 
required!

Proceedings for AMTA 2018 Workshop: Translation Quality Estimation and Automatic Post-Editing Boston, March 21, 2018   |   Page 10



Step 1:              
rule-based title 
generation

Browse Pages

First approach we implemented for German: 
Rule-based approach
1. Use hand-written heuristics / shallow parsers to 

classify each slot
2. Order slots based on slot classes
3. Realize each slot separately based on slot class
• Use dedicated heuristics for certain 

combinations, e.g. Category + Product Type
4. Concatenate realizations

Proceedings for AMTA 2018 Workshop: Translation Quality Estimation and Automatic Post-Editing Boston, March 21, 2018   |   Page 11



Step 2:               
APE

Browse Pages

For German, we have
• Millions of browse page titles in a slightly 

artificial language 
(our output from rule-based system)

• Parallel titles in a “natural” language (human 
curated titles)

=> train an APE system on those

e.g. translate 
Kaukasische Wohnraum-Teppiche für Patchwork
into
Kaukasische Wohnraum-Teppiche mit Patchwork-
Muster

Proceedings for AMTA 2018 Workshop: Translation Quality Estimation and Automatic Post-Editing Boston, March 21, 2018   |   Page 12



APE
Pros & Cons

Browse Pages

Pro
+ Straight forward
+ Large improvements in quality 
+ Easy to integrate

Con
Can only fix data that’s there (can’t reconstruct 
missing slots, slot names or context, …)
Sometimes learns artifacts from data (esp. when 
noisy)
Will learn curation rules present when titles were 
created

Quality 
Estimation

Learning algorithms

Extremely Randomized Trees
• Ensemble of decision trees
• Random forests

• Build on random samples from training data
• Choose best split for random subset of features

• Extremely randomized: additionally choose best threshold from
random set of thresholds

AdaBoost
• Sequence of weak learners (very small decision trees)
• Fit them on original dataset
• Then fit additional copies of classifier on same data, but adjust weights

of incorrectly classified instances s.t. subsequent classifiers focus
more on difficult cases

• Final prediction: weighted majority vote of all iterations
• Time consuming

Both:
• Non-linear
• Provides feature importances

Proceedings for AMTA 2018 Workshop: Translation Quality Estimation and Automatic Post-Editing Boston, March 21, 2018   |   Page 22



Quality 
Estimation

Experimental setup

• regression
• HTER labels clipped in [0, 1]
• 75/25 train/test splits
• Model selection
• Randomized search with 5-fold cross 

validation (100 iterations)
• Optimized for mean absolute error

• Evaluation
• mean absolute error (MAE) ê
• Pearson‘s correlation é

Analysis

Analysis
• Quality prediction in the tails of the test set distribution is 

problematic
• Tails equals to

• Good translations (HTER close to 0)
• Bad translations (HTER close to 1)

WC: 32.69

• Accuracy @ 25% best (HTER near 0)
CPA: 60.37

Quality 
Estimation

Conclusion
• Best feature set on average: Quest79 + NER
• AdaBoost presents the best accuracy, but slow
• Extremely Randomized Trees offer best trade-off 

between accuracy and computing time
• Models can predict bad and good translations 

with more than 50% accuracy
• Models for single categories, no pooling
