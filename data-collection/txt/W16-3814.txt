Abstract 

 The paper presents a contrastive description of reflexive possessive pronouns “svůj” in Czech and 

“svoj” in Russian. The research concerns syntactic, semantic and pragmatic aspects. With our analysis, 

we shed a new light on the already investigated issue, which comes from a detailed comparison of the 

phenomenon of possessive reflexivization in two typologically and genetically similar languages. We 

show that whereas in Czech, the possessive reflexivization is mostly limited to syntactic functions and 

does not go beyond the grammar, in Russian it gets additional semantic meanings and moves substan-

tially towards the lexicon. The obtained knowledge allows  us to explain heretofore unclear marginal us-

es of reflexives in each language. 

1 Introduction 

It is generally known that a comparison of the performance of a phenomenon in different languages 

brings more knowledge about this phenomenon. The fact that a cross-lingual study brings more 

knowledge about how a phenomenon functions in each separate language under comparison is less 

trivial, but also challenging. Our research here contributes to the latter claim: we compare possessive 

pronouns in Czech and Russian by addressing statistics obtained from the parallel English-Czech-

Russian corpus PCEDT-R (Novák et al., 2016) as well as existing (mostly) monolingual theoretical 

knowledge with the aim to learn more about this type of pronouns in each language separately. Taking 

into account existing variety of means to express the notion of possessivity, we concentrate on reflex-

ive possessive pronouns “svůj” in Czech and “svoj” in Russian. 

In occasional references, the rules of the use of reflexive pronouns are observed as similar or the 

same (cf. Panevová, 1986; Čmejrková, 2003). Indeed, a shallow observation proves this assumption. 

Both in Czech and in Russian, the reflexive possessive “svůj/svoj” is basically coreferential with the 

subject. Situations where it is not the case are thoroughly described in the literature and, again, a shal-

low observation of research papers on this topic proves the similarity. However, there can be found a 

number of sentences, where a very frequent conventional use of Russian “svoj” cannot be translated as 

such into Czech, as can be seen in Example (1). Also, the statistics obtained from PCEDT_R (see Sec-

tion 3) provides a significant difference in the frequency of the use of possessive pronouns and the 

distribution between personal and reflexive possessive pronouns in Czech and Russian.

[lit. Each scientist has self’s/own library.] 

The analysis of these discrepancies shows that it is meaningful to compare possessives in Czech and 

Russian according to the following aspects:  

a) Syntactic rules and tendencies for the use of reflexive possessives (possibility of the use of 
“svůj/svoj” with  antecedents in direct or indirect cases, occurrences of reflexive possessives in 

the nominative case, the use and referential qualities of nominal groups with reflexive posses-

sives in sentences with embedded explicit and implicit predications, etc.); 

b) Semantics and functions of reflexive possessives (i.e. we should answer the question if

“svůj/svoj” has its own meaning, if it may change the meaning of a nominal group it is used 

with, or if it is just the formal means of possessive reflexivization); 

c) Pragmatic factors of the use of personal and reflexive possessive pronouns; 
d) Competition of personal (můj, tvůj, náš, váš, jeho, její, jejich in Czech, moj, tvoj, naš, vaš, jego, 

jeje, ich in Russian) and reflexive possessives, co-occurrence in specific contexts and compari-

son of these contexts for Czech and Russian, also with respect to pragmatic factors; 

e) Optionality of possessives, possibility to omit possessive pronouns, or, on the contrary, to insert 
them to the places where they have not been used by the speaker; 

f) Distribution between spoken and written discourse, sociolinguistic and historical factors for 
Czech and Russian, etc. 

Due to extensiveness of the topic, this paper primarily addresses the first three aspects, namely syn-

tactic, semantic and partially pragmatic factors of the use of reflexive possessive pronouns. 

We believe that our findings are interesting both from the theoretical and computational perspec-

tives. From the perspective of computational linguistics, searching for rules of expressing possessivity 

helps us find and verify specific features in text that can be further used as background knowledge for 

the improvement of multilingual tools for coreference and anaphora resolution. From the theoretical 

point of view, our research contributes to contrastive comparative analysis of typologically related 

languages. The knowledge acquired by such comparison not only gives us the typologically relevant 

information in general but also an opportunity to know more about each separate language.  

2 Theoretical Background 

The use and distribution of personal and reflexive possessive pronouns are analyzed in scientific litera-

ture both for Czech and for Russian, but mostly separately. To our knowledge, the only study concern-

ing both languages in detail is Bílý (1981), who explains the choice of pronouns on the background of 

the theory of FSP, applying the notion of communicative dynamism. 

For Czech, the description of personal and reflexive possessive pronouns begins with Svoboda 

(1880) and is further addressed in a number of theoretical studies and grammars (Gebauer, 1890; 

Trávníček, 1951; Daneš—Hausenblas, 1962; Grepl—Karlík, 1986; Daneš et al., 1987, etc). These 

studies formulate the basic rule of coreference of the reflexive possessive “svůj” with the subject 

(Gebauer, 1890) and point out an ambiguous reference of reflexive possessives in sentences with em-

bedded predications.  

The study of reflexive possessives in Russian goes back to Peškovskij (1914). After a longer time 

period, the cases of oblique control of Russian possessives were addressed within the binding theory 

by Timberlake (1980) and Rappoport (1986).  

The most intensive research, both for Czech and for Russian, begins independently in 1980s. The 

shallow and deep syntactic criteria for the use of personal and reflexive possessives in Czech have 

been formulated within the theory of Functional Generative Description (Hajičová et al., 1985; 

Panevová 1980, 1986) and it was later developed by Čmejrková (1998, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2006, 

2011), who used pragmatic criteria to explain the concurrence of personal and reflexive possessives in 

literary and colloquial Czech. 

The research of possessivity and reflexivization for Russian continued in the semantic and pragmat-

ic directions. Yokoyama—Klenin (1976) and Yokoyama (1980) analyze possessive pronouns within 

the theory of empathy (Kuno, 1975). Padučeva (1983, 1985) considers additional meanings of a re-

flexive possessive “svoj” which largely conform to the list of the meanings presented in the Dictionary 

of Russian (Ožegov—Švedova, 1997). Semantic functions and non-canonical control of Russian pos-

sessives is further addressed in Brykina (2009) and Fed’ko (2007). 

Coreference resolution of reflexive pronouns is generally considered an easy task, particularly for 

English. Usually a principle that the reflexive pronoun refers to the subject in the same clause is fol-

lowed (Mitkov 2002). However, this task may be more challenging for other languages, especially for 

those with free word order for which syntactic parsers perform worse. For example, in their error anal-

ysis of coreference resolvers for Russian, Toldova et al. (2016) report the maximum resolution accura-

cy on reflexive pronouns to be 80%. Even for English, the strict syntax-driven approach starts to fail if 

111



applied on more complicated texts, as reported on split antecedent coreference resolution on a patent 

material (Burga et al., 2016). 

3 What data show 

The analysis performed in this study is inspired by statistical results obtained from the three-language 

parallel corpus PCEDT-R (Novák et al., 2016) and presented in Nedoluzhko et al. (2016). The corpus 

contains 50 journalist texts (1078 sentences), manually translated from English into Czech and Rus-

sian. The corpus is provided with rich morphological, shallow syntactic and tectogrammatical annota-

tion, it also contains manual annotation of word alignment for Czech and English pronouns.  The Rus-

sian part was automatically aligned with the Czech part of PCEDT using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 

2000), which was run on a large amount of parallel Czech-Russian data. The resulting triples contain-

ing possessive units (in at least one of the languages used) have been manually annotated and analyzed 

from the perspective of each language separately. The absolute numbers of the mapping of 238 Eng-

lish possessive pronouns in PCEDT-R are briefly presented in Table 1.

Table 1: Counterparts of English possessive pronouns in Czech and Russian. 

 

The statistics of the correspondences of English possessive pronouns to their Czech and Russian 

counterparts showed the tendency of Czech and Russian to use possessive pronouns less frequently 

than in English. Moreover, Nedoluzhko et al. (2016) observed that the numbers differ significantly for 

Czech and for Russian. In Russian, 15% of English pronouns remain unexpressed, whereas in Czech 

this number comes up to 23%. The more frequent use of possessives in Russian texts raise the suspi-

cion that it could be influenced by lower translation quality, but the comparison with original texts 

from the Prague Dependency Treebank for Czech (PDT 3.0; Bejček et al., 2013) and the Russian 

Treebank (RTB; Boguslavsky et al., 2000) proved that the difference between the frequency of pro-

nouns in original and translated texts in Czech is even higher than in Russian.  

As concerns the distribution of personal and reflexive possessives, the data show a moderate but 

statistically significant prevalence of personal possessives over reflexive ones in both languages, and 

in Czech reflexive possessives are significantly more frequent than in Russian. 

Another finding obtained from the parallel data is a similar optionality of possessives in Czech and 

Russian. Out of the translations of English possessive pronouns, about 20% were marked as optional 

in both languages. However, we observe a substantial difference in optionality of expressing posses-

sivity between personal and reflexive possessives in both languages: Reflexive possessives can be 

omitted more frequently.  

4 Syntactic rules for reflexive possessives 

The basic “school-grammar” rule for the use of reflexive possessive pronouns was formulated for 

Czech (Gebauer, 1890) and for Russian (Peškovskij, 1914) in a similar way: a reflexive pronoun refers 

to the subject of the sentence (Example 2). The moderate difference can be observed in the modality of 

the rule: It is formulated rather prescriptively for Czech and more descriptively for Russian.

  See, e.g., the English possessive pronoun their translated with the external dative reflexive si into Czech:

their office. – CZ: Společnost zažalovali Glenn a Sharon Beebeovi z Cincinnati v roce 1981 poté, co si ko-

berce Burlington položili do kanceláře. 
2
 This difference mostly concerns the attitude on this issue in general during the research period, not primarily 

the studies of J. Gebauer (1890) and A. Peškovskij (1914). 

112



Reference to antecedents in indirect cases is restricted to a close set of Russian verbs (Padučeva, 

1983).
3
  As for Czech, the use of “svůj” referring to an antecedent in an indirect case is unacceptable 

for singular subjects (Example 3 and 4a) but, interestingly, it sounds somewhat better in distributive 

contexts (Example 4b)
4
: 

(3) RU: Jemu tošno ot svojej bespomosčnosti. – CZ: Je mu špatně ze *své bezmoci. [lit. He feels 
sick because of self’s helplessness.] 

(4a) CZ: *Petrovi je líto svého mládí. [lit. Petr feels sorry for self’s youth.] 

(4b) CZ: 
?
Každému je líto svého mládí.[lit. Everybody feels sorry for self’s youth.] 

In a simple sentence like Example (2), the speaker, as well as the interpreter, is able to process sen-

tences demanding reflexivization unambiguously. Differences occur when sentences contain embed-

ded predications (Example 5). It is not clear then, which subject (i.e. the subject of the main clause or 

the subject of the embedded predication) triggers reflexivization.  

(5) CZ: Profesor požádal asistenta přednést svůj referát. – RU: Professor poprosil assistenta 

pročitať svoj doklad. [lit. The professor asked the assistant to read self’s report.] 

The interpretation of sentences like (5) evoked intensive discussion which began with J. Gebauer 

and A. Peškovskij (such cases are even referred to as so called ‘Peškovskij sentences’), continued with 

Trávníček (1951), Daneš—Hausenblas (1962), Růžička (1973), Bílý (1981), Timberlake (1980), Rap-

poport (1986), Panevová (1980, 1986), Hajičová et al. (1985, 2002) and it is still addressed in the re-

cent studies of Feďko (2007), Brykina (2009) and Čmejrková (2011 etc.).  

There is, again, an interesting discrepancy in the modality of claims concerning referential ambigui-

ty in ‘Peškovskij sentences’ for Czech and for Russian. For Russian, their ambiguity is generally ac-

cepted. For Czech, we find contradictory opinions in different studies on this topic. According to most 

of the authors, „svůj/svoj“ in (5) is ambiguous, as it can refer to the subject of the matrix sentence 

(professor), as well as to the agent of the embedded predication (assistant). However, Fr. Trávníček in 

his Grammar of Czech (Trávníček, 1951) and even in his translation of Gebauer’s Czech grammar 

(Trávníček, 1939) gives the prescription saying that the reflexive “svůj” must refer to the subject of 

the embedded predication (assistant). Contrarily, the prescription in school grammars is opposite: 

“svůj” in sentences like (5) must refer to the shallow subject of the sentence (professor). Panevová 

(1986) formulated the following syntactic hypothesis: in cases with embedded predications, „svůj“ 

tends to refer to the Agent of the embedded structure, i.e. to the assistant in (5). Besides the cases with 

explicit embedded predications, this pattern nicely explains the acceptance of sentences with indirect 

cases of the deep subject in non-personal sentences like (6) for Czech. 

(6) CZ: Zátopkové se podařilo opakovat svůj úspěch Daneš–Hausenblas(1962) [lit. To Zátopková was possi-

ble to repeat self’s success.] 

Moreover, Panevová (1986) formulates two other syntactic tendencies for Czech, interesting from 

the comparative point of view. The first observation is the strong restriction to the use of reflexive 

possessives within the subject of the sentence (cf. impossible “svůj” in Examples 7–9 for Czech).   

(7) CZ: *Svoje děti běhají po ulici. [lit. Self’s children are running on the street.]  

(8) CZ: *Trhání svých zubů ve mně vzbudilo nelibé pocity. [lit. Pulling out the self’s teeth was un-
pleasant to me.]   

(9) CZ: *Matku dojala péče o osud svých dětí. [lit. The care for self’s children affected the mother.] 

However, these sentences contain additional restrictions. In (7), “svůj” is used in Nominative case, 

which is forbidden with the reflexive possessive in its basic function (see Section 5.1). In (8) and (9), 

the antecedent of “svůj” is different from the Agents of the verbal nouns used within the same subject 

                                                           
3
 This claim concerns the reflexive “svoj” in its basic purely possessive meaning. For other meanings see Sec-

tion 5. 
4
 Deliberately, we do not consider sentences like (6) with embedded implicit predications that determine the 

antecedent for the reflexivization. 

113



(trhání [pulling out] in (8) and péče [care] in (9)). If we change the Agent and reformulate the sen-
tence (8) to (8a) in Czech, it becomes acceptable in Czech and absolutely normal in Russian.  

(8a) CZ: Trhání 
?
svých zubů je dost nepříjemný úkol. – RU: Udalenije svoich zubov – zanjatije 

vesma neprijatnoje. [lit. Pulling out the self’s teeth is quite unpleasant.]   

Surprisingly, however, the same transformation for (9) does not give an acceptable sentence in 

Czech, whereas in Russian it becomes fully acceptable. 

(9a) CZ: Matku vždy velice těšila péče o *své dětí. – RU: Mamu vsegda očeň radovala zabota o 
svoich detjach. [lit. The care for self’s children always gave joy to the mother.] 

The second Panevová’s restriction concerns the use of personal and reflexive possessive pronouns 

in matrix and embedded predications. She claims for Czech that in the embedded clause, a reflexive 

possessive must be used when referring to the subject in the matrix clause, and only personal posses-

sive may be used when referring to the Agent of the embedded predication. The claim is demonstrated 

on Example (10). However, this delicate syntactic rule does not work for Russian, where all forms of 
possessive pronouns may be used with slight stylistic but not referential difference.

(10) CZ: Jan byl znepokojen chováním svých/*jeho dětí v jejich/*svém pokoji. – RU:  Jan byl ne-

dovolen povedenijem svoich/jeho detej v svojej/ich komnate [lit. Jan was unhappy with the behaviour 

of self’s/his children in self’s/their room.] 

5 Semantics of reflexive possessives 

Most studies addressing possessive reflexivization in Czech do not concern any special lexical seman-

tics of „svůj“, it is considered to be “lexically completely emptied” (Čmejrková, 2003:186). Uses 

mismatching this claim, such as Exampe (12) or (15) below are observed as a “special transformation” 

(Daneš – Hausenblas (1962), “implied predications […] of very low predicative quality” (Bílý, 1981), 

substandard expressions (Karlík et al., 1995), homonyms with the basic reflexive “svůj” (Dočekal, 

2000), phrasemes (Čmejrková, 2003), etc. 

On the other hand, for Russian, additional semantics of “svoj” is generally accepted and presents an 

issue of linguistic interest. Apart from its basic reflexive meaning, which expresses possession or a 

valency position (“svoj1”), Padučeva (1983) distinguishes five additional meanings of “svoj” in Rus-

sian, which were later supplied by one more meaning in Brykina (2009). In what follows, we list these 

meanings and look for Czech equivalents for them.  

 svoj2 = ‘svoj1’+‘own’ (Example 11). In Czech, “svůj” is not used in this meaning, but we meet it 
in phrasemes or collocations (cf. Example (12), prosadit své/svou [get one’s way, lit. enforce 

self‘s], or trvat na svém [insist, lit. insist on self’s]); 

(11) RU: Svoja kvartira lučše čem sjemnaja. – CZ: *Svůj byt je lepší než nájemní. [lit. Self’s flat is 

better than a rented one.]  

(12) CZ: Svá vlast je každému nejmilejší [lit. Self’s homeland is to everybody the best.] 

 svoj3 = ‘svoj1’+ distributive meaning (Example 1 in Section 1). Being very productive in Russian, 
this meaning is marginal in Czech (cf. phraseological Example 12). However, as we observed in 

Example (4b in Section 4), the distributive semantics can make reflexives in some forbidden con-

texts sound better; 

 svoj4: = ‘svoj1’+‘specific, special’ (Examples 13 and 14). In Russian, this meaning is common and 
productive, also with “svoj” in the nominative case (Example 13). In Czech, it is rather marginal, 

but yet possible in examples like (14): 

                                                           
5
  In some idiolects, the combination svoich detej v svojej komnate [self’s children in self’s room] is sup-

pressed in the meaning ‘Jan’s children in children’s room’ or ‘Jan’s children in Jan’s room’, although othe 

speakers allow for these readings. However, this form is stylistically worse than other combinations, proba-

bly due to some kind of priming effect.  

114



(13) RU: No i zdes’ kipjat svoi strasti. – CZ: Ale i tady jsou *své vášně. [lit. But here, there are also 

self’s passions.] 

(14) RU: Zdes’ jesť svoja logika. – CZ: To má svou logiku. [There is a certain (lit. self’s) logic 

here.] 

 svoj5 = ‘svoj1’+‘corresponding’ (Examples 15 and 16). The Czech “svůj” has this meaning in con-
structions with své místo [self’s place] (Example 15) and in the proverb (16). Due to its semantics, 

this meaning is not very productive in Russian, but still there are more such contexts for Russian 

than for Czech (cf. ru. Den’gi budut v svoje vremja [lit. Money will come in self’s time], Delo idet 

svoim por’adkom [The thing is going on as it should (lit. by self’s order)] which are not possible in 

Czech).  

(15) CZ: Dej to na své místo. – RU: Postav’ eto na svoje mesto. [Put it into (self’s) place.] 

(16) CZ: Všechno má svůj čas. – RU: Vsemu svoje vremja. [The better day the better deed, lit. Eve-

rything has self’s time.] 

 svoj6 = ‘a relative, close person’ (Example 17 and 18). This meaning tends to be phraseological as 
it does not contain the basic reflexive meaning of “svoj1” and does not refer to an antecedent. In 

Czech, this meaning could be slightly (almost not) acceptable in (18). A similar meaning is present 

in the Czech proverb Svůj k svému (Example 18) or the phrase být svoji [to be a married couple]. 

(17) RU: V semje jego Ivan byl svoj čelovek. – CZ: V jeho rodině byl Ivan *svůj člověk. [lit. In his 
family, Ivan was the self’s (meaning close, dear) person.] 

(18) RU: Svoj svojego izdaleka vidit. [lit. Self’s see self’s from far away.] – CZ: ??Svůj svého z 
dálky vidí. BUT Svůj k svému. [lit. Self’s to self’s, meaning ca. that people of similar background 

should associate with one another.] 

 svoj7: = ‘svoj1’+‘typical, characteristic’ (Example 19). The reflexive “svoj” used in this meaning 
functions as a modifier and makes a quality modified by it definite to the interpreter. It also 

changes the communicative structure of the utterance: the nominal group used with “svoj” be-

comes contextually bound and gets an additional intonation stress (Brykina, 2009:158). 

(19) RU: On mne nadojel svoimi žalobami na žizň. – CZ: ?Už mě nudí svým stěžováním na život.[lit. 
He bores me with self’s complaints to his life.] 

*** 

As we can see, the cases lacking a uniform description for Czech (like dej to na své místo [lit. Put it 

on its place], etc.) may be treated as having one of the additional meanings that are described for Rus-

sian. However, differently from Russian, they are rather marginal and may be considered to be 

phrasemes or collocations. 

5.1 Syntax of reflexive possessive with additional meanings 

Syntactic rules for the use of reflexive possessives with additional functions differ from those in its 

basic possessive meaning in the following respects: 

(i) Reflexive possessive in its secondary meaning allows Nominative case (cf. Examples (11), (13), 

(14) for Russian). This is also true for Czech, but because in Czech secondary meanings of reflexives 

are marginal, it is mostly considered as an exception (cf. Example (12)). 

(ii) Opposite to its basic meaning, reflexive possessives with additional semantics may refer to ante-

cedents in indirect cases in Russian without any restrictions (Example 20). This is not the case of 

Czech. However, the better acceptability of (4b) compared to (4a) in Section 4 in distributive context 

is similar to it. 

(20) RU: V redakcii malo svoich rabotnikov. – CZ: V redakci je málo *svých (vlastních) pracovníků  
[lit. There are few self’s employees in the editorial board.] 

(iii) The reflexive possessive in its secondary meaning in Russian allows the predicative use (Ex-

ample 21): 

115



(21) RU: A gruď – svoja!  – CZ: Ale prsa jsou *své!  [lit. But (her) breast is self’s.] 

(iv) Secondary meanings of reflexive possessives tend to be used in the focus of the sentence, in in-

tonationally stressed positions, etc.  

5.2 Animacy of the antecedent 

The competition between personal and reflexive possessives in Russian may be also explained by the 

animacy of their antecedents. In Padučeva (1983), the author claims that „svůj“ with inanimate ante-

cedent cannot be used if it fills the valency position of Patiens, whereas with animate antecedents it is 

allowed, cf. Example (22) for inanimate antecedent zakony [laws]. Interestingly, for Czech, this form 

is not fully prohibited
6
. As concerns animate antecedents, Padučeva suggests the example from Dosto-

jevsky (23), where „svůj/svoj“ is allowed for both languages. However, reflexive possessive reference 

to Patient is common neither in Czech nor in Russian, so many other examples sound unnatural or im-

possible (Example 24).  

(22) RU: Zakony rasšatyvajutsja ot ich (*svojego) narušenija. – CZ: Zákony trpí 
?
svým častým 

porušováním. [lit. Laws get weaker because of self’s often breaking.] 

(23) RU: Dlja mnogich naš krestjanin po osvoboždenii svojem javilsja strannym nedoumenijem. – 

CZ: Pro mnohé se náš rolník stal po svém osvobození podivnou raritou. [lit. For many people, our 

peasant became a strange creature after self’s emancipation.] 

(24) RU: Posle *svojego ubijstva, jego vskore zabyli. – CZ: Po *svém zabití byl brzy zapomenut. 

[lit. After self’s murder, he was quickly forgotten.] 

When referring to an inanimate Agent of the sentence, the reflexive possessives are freely replacea-

ble with personal possessives in Russian (Example 25). This is not the case for referring to animate 

Agent in Russian, moreover this tendency does not work in Czech. In Czech, the choice between per-

sonal and reflexive possessives is made according to syntactic (Section 4) and pragmatic (Section 6) 

criteria, the factor of animacy is not very important. 

(25) RU: Slovo „takže“ v jego/svojem osnovnom upotreblenii bezudarno.– CZ: Výraz “také” je ve 

svém (
??

jeho) primárním významu enklitický. [lit. The word „also“ is enclitic in its/self’s meaning.] 

6 Pragmatic aspects in possessive reflexivization 

Yokoyama–Klenin (1976) and Yokoyama (1980) claim that the choice between personal and reflexive 

possessive pronouns in Russian is determined by discourse-oriented factors, namely by the degree, to 

which the speaker identifies with his inner self in the process of the speech performance (Yokoyama, 

1980). According to the authors, the situation is different for the 1
st
, 2

nd
 and 3

rd
 persons. For the  1

st 
 

and 2
nd

 persons, reflexivization occurs when the speaker feels a distance between his inner self and the 

utterance, while a personal possessive is used when the speaker psychologically completely identifies 

himself with the antecedent. For the 3
rd

 person, the situation is reverse.  

The Yokoyama–Klenin’s approach was developed primarily for Russian, but not all the examples 

presented by the authors sound well in Russian, cf. almost unacceptable Example (26). 

(26) RU: Nu i čto, čto on zametil, kak kakaja-to baba uronila 
??

jeje košelek. [lit. So what, if he 

didn’t notice that a woman dropped her wallet?] 

Interestingly, Yokoyama–Klenin’s approach seem to better pass for Czech than for Russian. S. 

Čmejrková provides a series of studies (Čmejrková, 1998, 2002, 2005, 2006, 2011), where she pro-

vides numerous reliably acceptable corpus and empirical examples supporting this approach. The au-

thor also distinguishes between pragmatic rules for the pronouns of different persons and number. So, 

for the concurrence of the reflexive possessive with the 1
st
 person singular “můj” [my], she defines a 

number of emphatic contexts, in which there is a strong tendency to use personal possessive pronouns 

instead of the reflexive one. The possibility to use the reflexive increases with the increasing distance

 This sentence was presented to ten native speakers in different pragmatic contexts and it was definitely rejected 

only by two of them when they were explicitly asked if this sentence was grammatical. However, the sentence 

does not sound natural by itself, thus the language intuition could not be applied properly and the experiment is 

not fully legitimate.

between the speaker’s inner self and the utterance: from lexicalized phrasemes like na mou/*svou duši 

[lit. to my/*self’s soul], na mou/*svou čest [lit. to my/*self’s honour] through close relatives and 

friends, where the use of personal possessives is very often in (especially spoken) texts (Example 27) 

up to all other objects of possession where the special degree of empathy with the speaker may be ex-

pressed with the personal possessive (Example 28).

would like to remind to my colleagues.] 

As for Russian, this tendency exists, but it is substantially weaker than for Czech. Differently from 

Czech, the distribution rules for personal and reflexive possessives in the 1
st 

 and 2
nd

 persons are not so 

strong in Russian, so the distinction in pragmatic aspects is also missing.  

7 Conclusion 

Based on parallel corpus statistics from one hand and on existing theoretical research on the other 

hand, we contrasted the use of reflexive possessive pronouns "svůj/svoj" in Czech and in Russian. The 

observed facts indicate substantial difference in the use of possessive pronouns in Czech and Russian. 

In Czech, syntactic functions of the reflexive possessive pronoun „svůj“ absolutely prevail, its lexi-

cal semantics is so poor that expressions containing semanticalized „svůj“ are rather observed as 

phrasemes. Furthermore, there is a number of syntactic limitations determining the use of the reflexive 

possessive in Czech. Contrarily, the Russian pronoun „svoj“ has a number of secondary meanings, 

most of them supplement the basic reflexivization function of the pronoun. Syntactic rules for the use 

of „svoj“ in its secondary meanings differ from those when it is used only to express possessivity 

(common use in the nominative case, reference to antecedents in indirect cases, etc.). The limitations 

determining the use of the reflexive possessive in Russian include semantic ones (e.g., animacy of the 

antecedent). These facts indicate that the phenomenon of possessive reflexivization does not exceed 

the limits of grammar in Czech, whereas in Russian it goes beyond grammar towards the lexicon.  

On the other hand, the obtained knowledge about frequently used additional functions of the reflex-

ive possessive in Russian allows us to interpret the nature of marginal uses of reflexive possessives in 

Czech (e.g., semantic interpretation of dej to na své místo [put it on self’s place]). Furthermore, it 

opens new issues of research leading to understanding the essence of reflexivization and passivization 

phenomena. In the future work, the ideas obtained from our comparison should be secondarily 

checked on corpus data, this time also on monolingual, and also spoken texts have to be taken into 

account. 

A certain limitation, which makes the study of reflexive possessives especially hard, is the loose-

ness of standards, especially in Czech and especially in sentences with embedded constructions (but 

not exceptionally). Judging grammatical acceptability differs significantly by speakers, the reason is 

both in the social–historical background (purist influences on the topic and the prescriptive character 

of rule for Czech that can form different idiolects and attitudes) and in the nature of the phenomenon 

itself.
