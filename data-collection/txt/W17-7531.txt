Abstract

Vocabulary building is fundamental to any
language learning and effective commu-
nication relies on the mastery of vocabu-
lary. Hindi is one of the widely spoken
languages in the world. However, there is
a scarcity of quality e-learning resources
for Hindi. Also, there is lack of e-learning
content which is in-sync with Hindi cur-
riculum. This was the motivation in build-
ing educational application, Hindi Shab-
damitra, for language teaching and learn-
ing. Hindi Shabhadamitra is an e-learning
tool developed using Hindi wordnet for
Hindi language learning. This is an in-
sight of the work reported by Redkar et al.
(2017) in which Hindi Shabdamitra en-
hances the teaching-learning process has
been presented. The paper presents the
teacher and user benefits of this e-learning
tool. Further, the user evaluation informa-
tion has been reported.

1 Introduction

Hindi language is a member of the Indo-Aryan
group of the Indo-European language family1.
Hindi is the official language of India and is 4th
among the most spoken languages in the world2.
Devanagari script is recommended as the official
script for Hindi3. Hindi in Devanagari script is a
part of most of the school curriculum and covers a
large spectrum of learners in India, and around the
world. A lot of digital content is available online
for learning Hindi. Most of this content is in the
form of conversation, stories, poems, games, etc.
However, less attention is given to learning of the

spoken-languages-in-the-world

detailed grammatical and lexico-semantic features.
Also, there is a scarcity of digital resources in the
e-learning domain, especially in the formal setup
or curriculum-based setup.

The rapid change in technology and availabil-
ity of anytime, anywhere digital resources led to
the reduction in the cost of delivering the educa-
tion to the volume of students. As per Shams and
Seitz (2008); Sankey et al. (2010), e-learning en-
hances the performance of the students due to its
multi-sensory impact on education. As per Nation
and Newton (1997); Lin (1997); Carter (1987), vo-
cabulary teaching and learning should be done in
a systematic and structured manner.

Vocabulary learning is considered to be a central
activity for any language learning process (Alqah-
tani et al., 2015). Also, learning grammar is im-
portant to understand the syntax and semantics of
the word usage. Knowledge of vocabulary is one
of the primary reasons for learner’s ability and con-
fidence to communicate. Various languages learn-
ing strategies like repetition, context, usage and vi-
sual correlation were tested by language experts for
enhancing the vocabulary (Atasheneh and Naeimi,
2015; Butler et al., 2010).

The multi-modal learning environments have
been studied in different settings (Dale, 1969;
Mayer and Moreno, 2003; Moreno and Mayer,
2007; Shams and Seitz, 2008; Sankey et al., 2010)
which shows its positive impact on learners and al-
ways result in better learning and retention. Meth-
ods like self-directed technology (Lai et al., 2016),
mobile assisted language learning (Yang, 2013)
and gamification has arrived as an effective peda-
gogical strategies. These strategies help the learner
to engage and motivate to learn in a relaxed man-
ner (Werbach and Hunter, 2012; Figueroa Flores,
2015). Lexical and semantic relations of words
help in better understanding of vocabulary (Lin,
1997).245



The Princeton WordNet4 or WordNet, have been
explored by Hu et al. (1998); Sun et al. (2011);
Brumbaugh (2015); Hiray (2015) for vocabulary
learning and other related language learning appli-
cations.

Keeping vocabulary and grammar learning as
pivotal to language learning, an e-learning tool,
Hindi Shabdamitra, has been developed based on
Hindi Wordnet5 (Redkar et al., 2017). This paper
presents an insight of the features and enhance-
ments in the teaching-learning process using Hindi
Shabdamitra.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows -
section 2 presents Hindi Shabdamitra, section 3 ex-
plains the functional and unique features of Hindi
Shabdamitra and the comparative study, section 4
provides enhancements in teaching-learning and
the benefits of end-users, section 5 describes the
user evaluation and field response. Finally, in sec-
tion 6 the paper is concluded with the scope for
future work.

2 Hindi Shabdamitra
Hindi Shabdamitra (िहदंी शब्दिमतर्, hiMdI shabdami-
tra)6 is a digital aid designed for assisting in teach-
ing and learning Hindi language (Redkar et al.,
2017). The end users of this e-learning tool are stu-
dents, teachers, parents and self-learners. It is de-
veloped for formal teaching-learning environment
as well as informal learning environment. The for-
mal setup is designed in correlation with school
curriculum. Self-learners, organizations, NGOs,
NRIs, etc., belong to the informal learning envi-
ronment. It uses Hindi Wordnet as a base resource
that has been remodeled for this aid by incorporat-
ing the multi-modal features. Further, the concepts
are grammatically enriched and simplified depend-
ing upon the understanding level of the learner.

A team of lexicographers, illustrators and na-
tive language speakers has contributed to build this
multi-modal resource which has formed the base of
Hindi Shabdamitra. The tool has an online web-
based and app-based interface for wider reachabil-
ity. Also, this tool can be made available offline
for anytime, anywhere learning. The interface al-
lows the search navigation in two ways – level wise

anusaara) and class wise (कक्षा के अनुसार, kaxaa ke
anusaara). This can be seen in figure 1 and 2.

Layered Interface
Hindi Shabdamitra interface has a layered architec-
ture. Depending on the proficiency of the learner,
the layers have been designed for learners, scaling
from the beginner to the proficient. The level of a
leaner is determined by using the class-wise profi-
ciency selection criteria as shown in table 1.

The same word can be studied by the learners at
all 5 levels. At each level, incremental information
is displayed. The depth of content displayed vary
from level to level. The detailed layer-wise list of
features have been provided in the next section.

Layer Level Class
Layer 1 Beginner (पर्ाथिमक) 1 and 2
Layer 2 Intermediate (माध्यिमक) 3, 4 and 5
Layer 3 Proficient (कुशल) 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10
Layer 4 Advanced (उ त) 11 and 12
Layer 5 Proficient (िवशेषज्ञ) Above 12

3 Features of Hindi Shabdamitra
Hindi Shabdamitra provides functional features
and unique features for the learners. These features
help learners in clearly understanding the concept.
Also, it aids the teachers and parents to explain
the concept in detail. The list of features with
respect to the classes and levels is given in ta-
ble 2. Following are the detailed description of
functional and unique features of Hindi Shabdami-
tra. These features are explained with the help
of Matthews (2007), Oxford dictionaries7, Online
dictionary for language technology8, Cambridge
dictionary9, Hindi Wordnet10, etc.

Functional Features
The functional features are most commonly found
in regular dictionaries or thesauri. These features
are available for all the levels.

1. Part of Speech (POS): Hindi Shabdamitra
has content based on the part of speech viz.,
noun, adjective, verb and adverb, as it is based
on the original resource, Hindi Wordnet.

• Noun / संज्ञा (saMGYaa) : One of the
classes of words whose characteristic
role is as an argument of a verb and
which is characteristically that of words
denoting concrete entities (Matthews,
2007). Nouns are known as संज्ञा (saM-
GYaa) in Hindi. Just like nouns in En-
glish, संज्ञा (saMGYaa) is also a names of
people, places, things and ideas. For ex-
ample:
– कमला (kamalaa, name of a lady)

Table 2: Class-wise and level-wise features of
Hindi Shabdamitra

– छोटा (ChoTaa, small, young)

• Verb / िकर्या (kriyaa) : One of a class of
lexical units whose characteristic syntac-
tic role is as a predicate or predicator and
which is characteristically that of words
denoting actions or processes. The verb,
specifically the action verb, is known as
िकर्या (kriyaa) in the Hindi language. For
example:
– खाता है (khaataa hai, eats)
– पीता है (piitaa hai, drinks)
– जाता है (jaataa hai, goes)
– खेलता है (khelataa, plays)

Note that the verbs given in the example
are for singular masculine subjects. For
feminine gender and singular number,
the verbs are conjugated as खाती है (
khAtI hai), पीती है (pItI hai) and जाती
है (jAtI hai). The plurals of the verbs
for both the genders are खाते हैं (khAte
haiM), जाते हैं (jAte haiM) and पीते हैं
(pIte haiM).247



• Adverb / िकर्यािवशेषण (kriyaavisheSha-
Na ) : A word of class whose most
characteristic role is traditionally that of
modifying a verb or verb phrase. For ex-
ample:
– धीरे (dhiire, slowly)
– जल्दी (jaldii, fast)
– पास) (paasa, near)
– आज) (aaja, today)

2. Multiple Senses/Polysemy : Polysemy refers
to the situation where the same word has two
or more different meanings. In level-wise
interface of Hindi Shabdamitra polysemy is
provided where a user can click on the next
button to get the another meaning of same
word, if available. However, in class-wise in-
terface there is only one word meaning, as
it corresponds to the meaning with the text-
books.

3. Audio pronunciation : The audio pronunci-
ations are recorded by the native Hindi speak-
ers, as to promote ‘Standard Hindi’. Hindi
Shabdamitra is provided with the audio of the
search-word.

4. Illustration (Image / Picture) : Illustrations
are drawn, keeping in the mind Indian con-
text. Illustrations are targeted to the learners
of level 1 and level 2 of the Hindi Shabdami-
tra. Following are the things taken into con-
sideration while illustrating a concept:

• Omitting the sensitive context, e.g., शव
(shava, a dead body). As it may cause
adverse effect on the kid, such illustra-
tions are omitted or expressed in a dif-
ferent way.

• Overlapping: If an illustration is drawn
for पूजा करना (pUjA karanA, to wor-
ship), it overlaps with आरती करना (AratI
karanA, do ritual) as well. Such in-
stances are avoided.

• One illustration for multiple concepts:
The illustration for बड़ा (baDa�A, big) has
its counterpart i.e., छोटा (ChoTA, small).
Here, for these concepts single illustra-
tion can be used.

• Abstract nouns: Abstract nouns are il-
lustrated with the base of provided ex-
ample or a specific situation. For e.g.,

Figure 3: Illustration of a word साथ (saatha)
.

साथ (saatha, company). A sample illus-
tration of an abstract noun साथ is shown
in figure 3.

5. Gloss or Definition :
The concept is defined by providing gloss or
definition of a word. Gloss is usually picked
from Hindi wordnet, however, it is simplified
in special cases.

(a) Simplified Gloss and Example: Hindi
Shabdamitra has provided simplified
gloss for level 1 and 2, i.e. for class 1
to 5. The gloss and example sentence
from original Hindi Wordnet is further
simplified by providing the simple words
in the definition so that the students at
these levels can easily pick-up and learn
concept comfortably.
If Hindi Wordnet gloss is completely or
partly difficult to understand then it is
simplified. For example, for a concept
नदी (nadI, river) having IndoWordNet11
Synset id 4430, the original Hindi
Wordnet gloss is जल का वह पर्ाकृितक
पर्वाह जो िकसी पवर्त से िनकलकर िन श्चत
मागर् से होता हआ समुदर् या िकसी दसूरे
बड़े जल पर्वाह में िगरता है (jala kA vaha
prAkRRitika pravAha jo kisI parvata
se nikalakara nishchita mArga se hotA
huA samudra yA kisI dUsare baDa�e
jala pravAha meM giratA haiM, a large
natural stream of water) (Bhattacharyya,
2010).

11http://www.cfilt.iitb.ac.in/indowordnet/248



This concept is difficult to understand by
a level 1 and 2 learners, hence this gloss
is simplified as पवर्त से िनकलकर अपने
आप बहती हई पानी क धारा (parvata se
nikalakara apane Apa bahatI huI pAnI
kI dhArA, river). Similarly, original
Hindi Wordnet example sentence, गगंा,
यमुना, सरस्वती, सतलुज, कावेरी, सरयू
आिद भारत क पर्मुख निदयाँ हैं। (gaMgA,
yamunA, sarasvatI, sataluja, kAverI,
sarayU Adi bhArata kI pramukha
nadiyAMN haiM, Ganga, Yamuna,
Saraswati, Satluj, Kaveri, Sharayu, etc.
are India’s major rivers) is simplified to
“गगंा, यमुना बड़ी निदयाँ हैं। (gaMgA, ya-
munA baDa�I nadiyAMN haiM, Ganga,
Yamuna are major rivers).

(b) Original Hindi Gloss : If Hindi Word-
net gloss is easy to understand, it was
kept as it is for level 1 and 2. For e.g., for
a concept पदैल (synset Id: 6274), Hindi
Wordnet gloss is परै से चलकर (pairoM se
chalakara, afoot) and Hindi Wordnet ex-
ample is वह िव ालय पदैल जाता ह।ै (vaha
vidyAlaya paidala jAtA hai, he is going
to the school afoot). For levels 3, 4 and
5, the original gloss is kept as it is, as at
these levels, learners will understand the
concepts by reading the original Hindi
Wordnet gloss and examples, hence it is
not simplified further.

6. Gender / लगं (liMga) : Grammatical cat-
egory dividing nouns into classes basically
characterizable by reference to sex. In Hindi,
there are two genders:

• Masculine / पुि ंग (pulliMga): nouns de-
noting males.

• Feminine / ी लगं (strIliMga): nouns
denoting females.

7. Synonym / समानाथीर् शब्द (samAnArthI
shabda) : Two lexical units with a shared
meaning. A synonym is a word or phrase that
means exactly or nearly the same as another
word or phrase in the same language. Words
that are synonyms are said to be synonymous,
and the state of being a synonym is called
synonymy. For example, िमतर् (mitra, friend)
and दोस्त (dosta, friend) are synonyms.

8. Antonym / िवलोम शब्द (viloma shabda) :
Words that have opposite meaning. In lexi-
cal semantics, opposites are words lying in an
inherently incompatible binary relationship,
like the opposite pairs बड़ा (badaa, big) - छोटा
(ChoTaa, small).

9. Number / वचन (vachana) : Inflectional cate-
gory basically distinguishing reference to one
individual from reference to more than one.

• Singular / एकवचन (ekavachana): Term
in the category of number, at least one
of whose roles is in referring to one in-
dividual as opposed to more than one.

• Plural / बहवचन (bahuvachana): Term
in the category of number, referring to
more than one, or more than some small
number of individuals.

10. Countability / गणनीयता (gaNanIyatA) :
• Countable / गणनीय (gaNanIya): A noun

whose syntax is that of ones denoting in-
dividuals that can be counted.

• Uncountable / अगणनीय (agaNanIya):
A noun whose syntax is characteristic of
a class whose members do not denote in-
dividuals that can be counted.

Unique Features
These features provide the deeper grammatical in-
formation, i.e., lexico-semantic relations. These
are not commonly found in regular dictionaries or
thesauri. These features are made available from
level 3.

11. Affix : Any element in the morphological
structure of a word other than a root.

interdependency between them. For exam-
ple, खाना (khaanaa, to eat) has causative verb
खलाना (khilaanaa, to make someone eat).

25. Entailment / अप रहायर्तावाची (aparihaary-
ataavaachii) : Entailment refers to a relation-
ship between two verbs. Any verb A entails
B, if the truth of B follows logically from the
truth of A. The relation of entailment is uni-
lateral, i.e., it is one way relation. For exam-
ple, खरार्टा लेना (kharraaTaa lenaa, to snore)
entails सोना (sonaa, to sleep).251



26. Link Type : This has major three links as fol-
lowed:

• Ability Link आन्तर-योग्यता िनदेर्शी िकर्या
(aantara-yogyataa nirdeshii kriyaa) :
This link specifies the inherited features
of a nominal concept. For exampleमछली
(maCHlii, fish) has ability link to तरैना
(tairnaa, to swim).

• Capability Link बा -योग्यता िनदेर्शी
िकर्या (baahya-yogyataa nirdeshii
kriyaa) : This link specifies the ac-
quired features of a nominal concept.
For example व्यिक् (vyakti, person) has
capability link to तरैना (tairnaa, to
swim).

• Function Link कर्म िनदेर्शी िकर्या (krama
nirdeshii kriyaa) : This link specifies
the function of a nominal concept. For
example िशक्षक (shikshak, teacher) has
functional link to पढ़ाना (paRhaanaa, to
teach).

27. Attribute गुणवाची (guNavaachii) : This de-
notes the properties of noun. It is a linkage
between noun and an adjective. For exam-
ple, पक्षी (pakshii, bird) has an attribute पखंदार
(pankhdaar, having wings).

3.1 A Comparative Study
A study of current digital resources used by var-
ious educational institution was done as a part of
the background study. The outcome showed a big
gap of quality resources which can cover aspects
of language learning viz. grammar, concepts, us-
age and pronunciations in an effective manner; and
which are based on the curriculum.

Some of the applications for language learning
which offer Hindi learning are Duolingo12, Hindi-
pod13, Rocket Language14, Italki15, etc. Some
applications made specifically for children are
dinolingo16 , akhlesh17, galligallisimsim18, etc.
Other online resources for Hindi language learn-
ing are bilingual dictionaries which provide only
the meanings of the words, such as Shabdkosh19,

12https://www.duolingo.com/
13https://www.hindipod101.com/
14https://www.rocketlanguages.com
15https://www.italki.com
16https://dinolingo.com
17http://www.akhlesh.com/
18http://www.galligallisimsim.com/
19www.shabdkosh.com/

Collins dictionary20, etc.
The common factor among all the above

resources is their inability of customization for
formal school setups. They are more focused on
individual learning (Redkar et al., 2017).

Advantages of Hindi Shabdamitra over the
above e-learning tools:

• Hindi Shabdamitra provides an insight about
deep grammatical features of a word/concept.

• It caters to school teachers, students and par-
ents by providing the curriculum based vo-
cabulary.

• It is based on a lexically rich resource, Hindi
Wordnet, whose features like lexico-semantic
and ontological relations provide much more
information.

• It provides both, systematic learning as well
as random learning approaches.

4 Enhancing Teaching-Learning Process
According to (Dike, 1989), audio-visual resources
do not only increase the motivation of the teach-
ers and learners, they add clarity to the topic taught
and make learning more interesting. The impact of
new technologies in educational contexts has been
mostly positive as new technologies have given ed-
ucators the opportunity to enhance their knowl-
edge, skills, and therefore enhance the standard
of education. Researchers have found that student
engagement, achievement and motivation are en-
hanced through integration of such technologies.

Hindi Shabdamitra facilitates learning with the
help of illustrations and pronunciation for multi-
sensory impact. This tool can assist the teachers in
better classroom management and make learning
Hindi an interesting activity (Redkar et al., 2017).

Learning Benefits
With the help of audio-visual methods for learning,
small children learn easily and effortlessly. Hence,
for the initial phases, in Hindi Shabdamitra, con-
cepts are pictorially depicted by providing illustra-
tions for level 1 and 2, as to understand a concept
easily. Most of the illustrations are simple and con-
vey the exact information.

Also, the words are provided with the audio pro-
nunciation. These words are recorded by native

20https://www.collinsdictionary.com252



speakers of the language. The best thing about
having audio pronunciation is that the teacher can
play it multiple times, until the student understands
it properly. Another advantage is that the audio
reaches to the entire classroom, i.e., till the last
bench.

Hindi Shabdamitra promotes following aspects
with the help of audio-visual aids for learning:

• Experiential Learning:
Digital learning redefines the boundaries of a
classroom. Sitting in a class, the students ex-
perience the application of a concept through
dynamic content 21

• Flipped Classroom approach:
The reversal of traditional teaching which
provides active learning. Students are accus-
tomed to interacting with audio and video on
electronic devices, so it stands to reason that
they would digest educational content in this
manner as well22.

Teaching benefits
• Validation:

Words and their respective illustrations and
audio pronunciations give an advantage to the
teacher to validate whether the students un-
derstood the entire concept or not. S/he is able
to present the image and audio multiple times
for the clarity of the concept.

• Sharing the burden:
It is certainly difficult for a teacher to pro-
vide the meaning of every word. Since Hindi
Shabdamitra is focused on vocabulary learn-
ing, the teacher has an aid. Whenever a stu-
dent has a doubt about a specific word s/he
can simply search the word. The tool will
share the burden of the teacher.

• Effectiveness as an aid:
The teaching profession is filled with count-
less opportunities to enrich the academic lives
of students, while some concepts and edu-
cational objectives will be easy for students
to grasp, other will require you to think cre-
atively to ensure that important learning ob-
jectives are met. Using audiovisual aids in

EDUCATION_IN_INDIA

22https://www.academia.edu/16071067/Effects_
of_Flipped_Classroom

teaching is one way to enhance lesson plans
and give students additional ways to process
subject information (Kunari, 2006).

5 Field Trial and User Response

As a part of testing the tool, the field trial of Hindi
Shabdamitra interface was done at some schools
with students & teachers’ participation in the exer-
cise. Also, an online survey was conducted. The
feedback was sought for the content, ease of han-
dling the application, classroom impact and overall
experience by teachers and students. Following are
the summarized observations:

• Hindi Shabdamitra helped teachers in ex-
plaining concepts clearly with the help of il-
lustrations and simplified concepts.

• The aid assisted the teacher in better class-
room management

• Reduced effort of reiterating the concepts for
better retention.

• Audio clips helped in understanding the pro-
nunciation of a given word.

• Having the standardized pronunciation by the
native Hindi speaker.

The application has been improved based on the
feedback received by students and teachers.

6 Conclusion and Future Work

The paper presents an insight of a Hindi Shabdami-
tra, an e-learning tool for teaching and learning
Hindi language by Redkar et al. (2017). A compar-
ative study of the existing technologies with Hindi
Shabdamitra was done where it is found to have
much more features. The field trial and survey was
conducted with which the observations and student
& teacher benefits have been reported here. This
tool definitely enhances the teaching-learning ex-
perience and has an exhaustive feature list which is
not there in many of the other e-learning products.
It caters to a wide range of audience and is avail-
able in both web-based and app-based formats.

In future, the authors intend to record the learn-
ing process of student, provide a teaching-learning
process flow, an interactive assessment module for
evaluations and other game based assessment mod-
ules for fun learning.253
