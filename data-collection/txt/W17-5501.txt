Abstract

In this paper, we present an approach to
exploit phrase tables generated by statis-
tical machine translation in order to map
French discourse connectives to discourse
relations. Using this approach, we cre-
ated ConcoLeDisCo, a lexicon of French
discourse connectives and their PDTB re-
lations. When evaluated against LEX-
CONN, ConcoLeDisCo achieves a recall
of 0.81 and an Average Precision of 0.68
for the CONCESSION and CONDITION re-
lations.

1 Introduction

Discourse connectives (DCs) (e.g. because, al-
though) are terms that explicitly signal discourse
relations within a text. Building a lexicon of DCs,
where each connective is mapped to the discourse
relations it can signal, is not an easy task. To
build such lexicons, it is necessary to have lin-
guists manually analyse the usage of individual
DCs through a corpus study, which is an expensive
endeavour both in terms of time and expertise. For
example, LEXCONN (Roze et al., 2012), a man-
ually built lexicon of French DCs, was initiated in
2010 and released its first edition in 2012. The
latest version, LEXCONN V2.1 (Danlos et al.,
2015), contains 343 DCs mapped to an average of
1.3 discourse relations. This project is still ongo-
ing as 37 DCs still have not been assigned to any
discourse relation. Because of this, only a lim-
ited number of languages currently possess such
lexicons (e.g. French (Roze et al., 2012), Span-
ish (Alonso Alemany et al., 2002), German (Stede
and Umbach, 1998)).

In this paper, we propose an approach to au-
tomatically map French DCs to their associated
PDTB discourse relations using parallel texts. Our

approach can also automatically identify the us-
age of a DC where the DC signals a specific dis-
course relation. This can help linguists to study a
DC in parallel texts and/or to find evidence for an
association between discourse relations and DCs.
Our approach is based on phrase tables generated
by statistical machine translation and makes no
assumption about the target language except the
availability of a parallel corpus with another lan-
guage for which a discourse parser exists; hence
the approach is easy to expand to other languages.

We applied our approach to the Europarl
corpus (Koehn, 2005) and generated Con-
coLeDisCo1, a lexicon mapping French DCs to
their associated Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB)
discourse relations (Prasad et al., 2008a). To
our knowledge, ConcoLeDisCo is the first lexi-
con of French discourse connectives mapped to
the PDTB relation set. When compared to LEX-
CONN, ConcoLeDisCo achieves a recall of 0.81
and an Average Precision of 0.68 for the CONCES-
SION and CONDITION discourse relations.

2 Related Work

Lexicons of DCs have been developed for sev-
eral languages: English (Knott, 1996), Span-
ish (Alonso Alemany et al., 2002), German (Stede
and Umbach, 1998), Czech (Poláková et al.,
2013), and French (Roze et al., 2012). However,
constructing such lexicons requires linguistic ex-
pertise and is a time-consuming task.

Discourse connectives and their translations
have been studied within parallel texts by many
(Meyer, 2011; Meyer et al., 2011; Taboada and
de los Ángeles Gómez-González, 2012; Cartoni
et al., 2013; Zufferey and Degand, 2014; Zufferey
and Cartoni, 2014; Zufferey and Gygax, 2015;

Hoek and Zufferey, 2015). These works have ei-
ther focused on the effect of the translation of
discourse connectives on machine translation sys-
tems (Meyer, 2011; Meyer et al., 2011; Cartoni
et al., 2013) or on a small number of discourse
connectives due to the cost of manual annotations
(Taboada and de los Ángeles Gómez-González,
2012; Zufferey and Degand, 2014; Zufferey and
Cartoni, 2014; Zufferey and Gygax, 2015; Hoek
and Zufferey, 2015).

To our knowledge, very little research has ad-
dressed the automatic construction of lexicons of
DCs. Hidey and McKeown (2016) proposed an
automatic approach to identify English expres-
sions that signal the CAUSAL discourse relation.
On the other hand, Laali and Kosseim (2014) au-
tomatically extracted French DCs from parallel
texts; however, they did not associate discourse
relations to the extracted DCs. The proposed ap-
proach goes beyond this work by mapping DCs to
their associated discourse relations.

3 Methodology

3.1 Corpus Preparation

For our experiments, we used the English-French
part of Europarl (Koehn, 2005) which contains 2
million2 parallel sentences. To prepare the dataset,
we parsed the English sentences with the CLaC
discourse parser (Laali et al., 2016) to identify En-
glish DCs and the discourse relation that they sig-
nal. The CLaC parser has been learned on Section
02-20 of the PDTB and can disambiguate the us-
age of the 100 English DCs listed in the PDTB
with an F1-score of 0.90 and label them with their
PDTB discourse relation with an F1-score of 0.76
when tested on the blind test set of the CoNLL
2016 shared task (Xue et al., 2016). This parser
was used because its performance is very close to
that of the state of the art (Oepen et al., 2016) (i.e.
0.91 and 0.77 respectively), but is more efficient at
running time than Oepen et al. (2016).

Note that since the CoNLL 2016 blind test set
was extracted from Wikipedia and its domain and
genre differ significantly from the PDTB, the 0.90
and 0.76 F1-scores of the CLaC parser can be
considered as an estimation of its performance on
texts with a different domain/genre such as Eu-
roparl.

22,007,723 to be exact.

3.2 Mapping Discourse Relations

To label French DCs with a PDTB discourse re-
lation, we assumed that if a French DC is aligned
to an English DC tagged with a discourse relation
Rel, then it should signal the same discourse rela-
tion Rel. For our experiment, we used the inven-
tory of 100 English DCs from the PDTB (Prasad
et al., 2008a) and the 371 French DCs from LEX-
CONN V2.1 (Danlos et al., 2015). For the map-
ping, we used the subset of 14 PDTB discourse
relations that was used in the CoNLL shared
task (Xue et al., 2015). This list is based on the
second-level types and a selected number of third-
level subtypes of the PDTB discourse relations.

To have statistically reliable results, we ignored
French DCs that appeared less than 50 times in
Europarl. Out of the 371 French DCs listed in
LEXCONN, seven do not appear in Europarl and
55 have a frequency lower than 50. This means
that 89% (309/371) of the French DCs have a fre-
quency higher than 50 and were thus used in the
analysis. A manual inspection of the infrequent
DCs shows that they are either informal (e.g. des
fois que) or rare expression (e.g. en dépit que).
Table 1 shows the distribution of the LEXCONN
French DCs in Europarl.

Freq. = 0 ≤ 50 > 50 Total
# FR-DC 7 55 309 371

Table 1: Distribution of LEXCONN French DCs
in the Europarl corpus.

We used the Moses statistical machine trans-
lation system (Koehn et al., 2007) to extract the
number of alignments between French DCs and
English DCs. As part of its translation model,
Moses generates a phrase table (see Table 2)
which aligns phrases between the language pairs.
The phrase table is constructed based on statisti-
cal word alignment models and contains the fre-
quency of the alignments between phrase pairs.
We used the Och and Ney (2003) heuristic and
combined IBM Model 4 word alignments (Brown
et al., 1993) to construct the phrase table.

Because an English DC can signal different dis-
course relations, to ensure that Moses’s phrase ta-
ble distinguishes the different usages of the same
English DC, we modified its English tokenizer so
that each English DC and its discourse relation
make up a single token. For example, the token

2



‘although-CONCESSION’ will be created for the
DC although when it signals the discourse rela-
tion CONCESSION. Table 2 shows a few entries of
the phrase table for the French DC même si. As
the table shows, même si was aligned to three En-
glish DCs: although, labeled by the CLaC parser
as a CONTRAST or as a CONCESSION and to even
if and even though which were not tagged .

though
- 1895

même si although CONTRAST 1446
même si although CONCESSION 858

Table 2: A few entries of the phrase table for the
connective même si.

In total, 1,970 entries of the phrase table con-
tained a French DC, an English DC and a dis-
course relation3. From these, we computed the
number of times a French DC was aligned to each
discourse relation, then, created ConcoLeDisCo:
tuples of <FR-DC, Rel, Prob>, where FR-DC and
Rel indicate a French DC and a discourse relation
and Prob indicates the probability that FR-DC sig-
nals Rel. To calculate Prob, we divided the num-
ber of times FR-DC is associated to Rel by the fre-
quency of FR-DC in Europarl. In total, the ap-
proach generated a lexicon of 900 such tuples, a
few of which are shown in Table 3.

si CONDITION 0.27
même si CONCESSION 0.08
lorsque CONDITION 0.05
néanmoins CONCESSION 0.07

Table 3: A few entries of ConcoLeDisCo.

4 Evaluation

To evaluate ConcoLeDisCo, because LEXCONN
uses a different inventory of discourse relations
than the PDTB, we only considered the discourse
relations that are common across these invento-
ries: CONCESSION and CONDITION. According
to LEXCONN, 61 French DCs can signal a CON-
CESSION or a CONDITION discourse relation. Out

3We only considered entries whose texts are an exact
match of an English DC listed in the PDTB and a French
DC listed in LEXCONN.

of these, 44 have a frequency higher than 50 in
Europarl.

4.1 Automatic Evaluation

To measure the quality of ConcoLeDisCo, we
ranked the <FR-DC, Rel, Prob> tuples based
on their probability and measured the quality of
the ranked list using 11-point interpolated aver-
age precision (Manning et al., 2008). This curve
shows the highest precision at the 11 recall levels
of 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, ..., 1.0. This method allows us
to evaluate the ranked list without considering any
arbitrary cut-off point. As Figure 1 shows, the ap-
proach retrieved 50% of the French DCs in LEX-
CONN with a precision of 0.81.

In addition, we also computed Average Preci-
sion (AveP) (Manning et al., 2008); the average of
the precision obtained after seeing a correct LEX-
CONN entry in ConcoLeDisCo. More specifi-
cally, given a list of ranked tuples:

AveP =

N∑

Precision(DCi) (1)

where N is the number of LEXCONN French
DCs that signals the CONCESSION or CONDI-
TION discourse relations (i.e. 44), DCi is the
rank of the ith LEXCONN DC in ConcoLeDisCo,
and Precision(DCi) is the precision at the rank
DCi of the ranked tuples. It can be shown that
AveP approximates the area under the interpo-
lated precision-recall curve (Manning et al., 2008).
The proposed approach identified 36 (81%) of
these 44 French DCs with an AveP of 0.68.

4.2 Manual Evaluation
In addition to the quantitative evaluation, we also
performed a manual analysis of the false-positive
errors to see if they really constituted errors. To
do so, we looked at the tuples with a probability
higher than 0.01 but which did not appear in LEX-
CONN. 14 such cases, shown in Table 4, were
found.

For example, while the French connective à
défaut de (#1 in Table 4) signals a CONDITION
discourse relation in Sentence (1) below, only the
EXPLANATION and the CONCESSION discourse
relations were associated with this connective in
LEXCONN.

(1) FR: À défaut de se montrer très ambitieux,
notre industrie, nos chercheurs et nos experts
ne disposeront purement et simplement pas
du brevet moderne dont ils ont besoin.
EN: If we are anything less than ambitious in
this field, we shall simply not provide our in-
dustry, our research and development experts
with the modern patent which they need.

To evaluate if these 14 cases were true mistakes,
we randomly selected five English-French parallel
sentences from Europarl that contained the French
DC and one of its English DC translations sig-
nalling the discourse relation. Then, we showed
the French DCs within their sentence to two na-
tive French speakers and asked them to confirm
if the discourse relation identified was indeed sig-
naled by the French DCs or not. The Kappa agree-
ment between the two annotators was 0.72. For
9 French connectives, both annotators agreed that
indicated that in at least one of the five sentences,
the discourse relation was signalled by the con-
nective. This indicates that 64% (9/14) are in fact
true-positives, i.e. correct mappings that are not
listed in LEXCONN. Table 4 shows the 14 pairs of

<FR-DC/English translation, Discourse relation>
used in the manual evaluation and indicates the
newly discovered mappings by X.

We also observed that if multiple explicit con-
nectives occur in the same clause (e.g. certes and
mais), one of them can affect the discourse rela-
tion signaled by the other. This is an interesting
phenomenon as it seems to indicate that the con-
nectives are not independent. For example, in Sen-
tence (2), the combination of certes and mais sig-
nals a CONCESSION discourse relation.

(2) FR: Cela coûte certes un peu plus cher, mais
est sans conséquence pour l’environnement.
EN: Although it is a little more expensive, it
does not harm the environment.

Note that according to LEXCONN, neither
certes nor mais can signal a CONCESSION dis-
course relation. The same phenomenon was also
reported in the PDTB corpus (Prasad et al., 2008b,
p. 5).

5 Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper, we proposed a novel approach to
automatically map PDTB discourse relations to
French DCs. Using this approach, we gener-
ated ConcoLeDisCo: a lexicon of French DCs
and their PDTB discourse relations. When com-
pared with LEXCONN, our approach achieved a
recall of 0.81 and an Average Precision of 0.68
for the CONCESSION and CONDITION discourse
relations. A manual error analysis of the false-
positives showed that the approach identified new
discourse relations for 9 French DCs which are
not included in LEXCONN. As future work, we
plan to evaluate all the discourse relations in Con-
coLeDisCo and apply the approach to other lan-
guages.
