Abstract

Emotion cause analysis, which aims to iden-
tify the reasons behind emotions, is a key topic
in sentiment analysis. A variety of neural
network models have been proposed recently,
however, these previous models mostly focus
on the learning architecture with local tex-
tual information, ignoring the discourse and
prior knowledge, which play crucial roles in
human text comprehension. In this paper,
we propose a new method to extract emo-
tion cause with a hierarchical neural model
and knowledge-based regularizations, which
aims to incorporate discourse context infor-
mation and restrain the parameters by senti-
ment lexicon and common knowledge. The
experimental results demonstrate that our pro-
posed method achieves the state-of-the-art per-
formance on two public datasets in different
languages (Chinese and English), outperform-
ing a number of competitive baselines by at
least 2.08% in F-measure.

1 Introduction

Sentiment analysis has gained increasing popular-
ity in recent years due to many useful applications
(Pang and Lee, 2007). The goal of sentiment anal-
ysis is to classify the sentiment polarity of a given
text as positive, negative, neutral, or more fine-
grained classes (Kim, 2014; Li et al., 2015; Yang
et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2017;
Qian et al., 2017; Li et al., 2018b; Yu et al., 2018).
Most of these researches have assumed that emo-
tion expressions are already observed and try to
identify the emotion categories from text. How-
ever, in practice, such as in product comments or
political reviews, we may care more about the rea-
son why the customers or critics hold the emotion
rather than a simple category label. Because they
can improve the quality of the products or services

according to the emotion cause provided by users.
Emotion cause analysis (ECA) aims to identify the
reasons behind a certain emotion expression in an
event text, for example:
Ex.1 When the children saw the gifts I prepared
carefully, (c−2)|they cheered happily and hugged
me. (c−1)| I was full of happiness. (c0)
Here, Ex.1 shows a document with three clauses
marked as (c−2), (c−1), and (c0). The goal of
ECA is to determine which clause contains emo-
tion cause (e.g., (c−1)) for an emotion word (e.g.,
happiness in (c0)).

Previous approaches for emotion cause analysis
mostly depend on rule-based methods (Lee et al.,
2010; Chen et al., 2010) and machine learning
algorithms (Ghazi et al., 2015; Gui et al., 2016;
Xu et al., 2019). Most of them rely heavily on
complicated linguistic rules or feature engineer-
ing, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive.
Recent studies have focused on solving the task
using neural models (Gui et al., 2017; Li et al.,
2018a; Chen et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019) with well
designed attention mechanism based on local text.
Despite the effectiveness of neural models, there
are some defects in previous studies. First, they
usually consider each clause individually, i.e., ig-
noring the discourse context information that can
impact the semantic expression among different
clauses of a document. Second, prior knowledge
such as sentiment lexicon and relative position in-
formation that can provide crucial emotion cause
cues has not been fully exploited in neural models.

To alleviate these limitations, we propose a reg-
ularized hierarchical neural network (RHNN) for
emotion cause analysis, which combines the dis-
course context information and knowledge-based
regularizations. Our model investigates the fol-
lowing intuitions. Firstly, documents exhibit dis-
course structure which may carry valuable infor-
mation about the emotion cause cues. We em-



5615

ploy a hierarchical learning structure to capture the
mutual impacts of semantic expression among the
discourse context, to help produce better clause
representation. Secondly, in emotion events, emo-
tion causes usually express a certain sentiment po-
larity by some sentiment words. For example, in
the emotion cause of Ex.1, the sentiment words
cheered and happily express a positive polarity,
also play a crucial role to provoke the emotion
happiness. Therefore, capturing these sentiment
words can enhance the causal connection between
learned features and predictions. We approach this
issue by designing a regularizer that incorporates
linguistic knowledge (e.g., sentiment lexicon) to
enlarge the margin of attention weights of senti-
ment words and non-sentiment words. Besides,
it is often the case that humans usually write im-
portant points in different sections. For emotion
events, emotion causes generally occur on posi-
tions very close to the emotion word and occur fre-
quently. Ex.1 shows an anecdotal example illus-
trating this behavior that the emotion cause clause
c−1 adjoins the emotion word happiness. To ben-
efit from this phenomenon, we introduce a regu-
larizer biased by relative position information to
supervise the representation learning of text and
further to revise the predictive position distribu-
tion of emotion causes relative to the emotion
word (in brief, predictive distribution).

To sum up, our contribution includes:

• We propose a novel discourse-aware learn-
ing structure with knowledge-based regular-
izations for emotion cause analysis.

• We empirically evaluate the proposed model
on two public datasets in different languages
(Chinese and English) and show statistically
significant improvements compared to the
state-of-the-art methods.

• To make the mechanism of our model clear,
we also compare the performance of different
combinations by ablation experiments. Ex-
tensive analysis on both datasets confirms the
feasibility of incorporating discourse infor-
mation and restraining the parameters by sen-
timent lexicon and common knowledge.

2 Our Framework

In this section, we first give the task definition.
Then, our proposed regularized hierarchical neural

network (RHNN), as shown in Fig 1, will be de-
scribed. The two auxiliary regularizers of RHNN
will be introduced in the next section.

2.1 Task Definition

The formal definition of emotion cause analysis is
given in (Gui et al., 2016). Formally, for a docu-
ment d = {c1, c2, . . . , cn} consisting of n clauses,
it contains an emotion word e and at least an emo-
tion cause clause corresponding to this emotion
word. Each clause ci = {wi1, wi2, . . . , wik} con-
sists of k words and is labeled with emotion cause-
oriented labels ∈ {0, 1}. We regard ECA as a bi-
nary classification task and aim to identify which
clause contains emotion cause.

2.2 Hierarchical Attention Network

Documents exhibit discourse structure which can
serve as useful information for clause representa-
tion generation. One simple but effective approach
is to adopt a hierarchical attention network to sim-
ulate this structure. Our hierarchical attention net-
work consists of several parts: a word encoder, a
word attention layer, a clause attention layer and
a clause encoder. The details of each component
will be described in the following paragraphs.

Word Encoder Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
has been widely adopted for text processing (Cho
et al., 2014). In this work, we first map each
word into a low dimensional embedding space by
Word2Vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) and then feed the
whole document into a GRU-based word encoder
to extract word sequence features. To summarize
information from both directions, we use bidirec-



5616

tional GRU to exploit two parallel passes:
−→
hit =

−−−−→
GRUw(xit), t ∈ [1, k] (1)

←−
hit =

←−−−−
GRUw(xit), t ∈ [k, 1] (2)

where xit is embedding vector for the word wit in
clause ci at time step t and k is the length of clause
ci. Then we concatenate hidden states of the two
directions hit = [

−→
hit,
←−
hit] as the representation of

each word.

Word Attention We introduce an attention
mechanism to extract such words that are impor-
tant to the meaning of the clause and aggregate the
representation of these informative words to con-
struct the clause vector. Specifically,

git = w
T
m(hit ⊕ eE) (3)

αit =
exp(git)∑
t′ exp(git′)

(4)

oci =
∑
t

αithit (5)

where wm is the parameter for computing atten-
tion signals and ⊕ is concatenate operation. The
embedding of emotion word e is denoted by eE .
αit is the emotion-specific attention signal show-
ing the importance of wordwit. oci is the weighted
sum of word representation based on weights.

Clause Attention Intuitively, different clauses
of a document are different informative and should
be labeled with different importance. Targeting
this problem, we design a clause attention mech-
anism to indicate the importance of each clause.
See it differently, the attention signals can be re-
garded as some ”prior” information to bias the
clause encoder toward some content that is more
important to extracting the emotion cause.

As for details, we adopt a one-layer MLP to get
the attention signals. Apparently, position infor-
mation plays an important role in capturing the rel-
ative distance of the clause to emotion word. Thus,
we concatenate the clause vector oci and its posi-
tion embedding as the feature to obtain the atten-
tion signal, this yields:

αi = sigmoid(wv(oci ⊕ li)) (6)

o′ci = oci · αi (7)
where wv is a parameter vector, li is the ran-
domly initialized position embedding and keeps
unchanged in the training stage, αi is the weight
of clause ci. Then the clauses with different im-
portance (e.g., o′ci) are fed into a clause encoder.

Clause Encoder Just as the meaning of a word
is determined by its context, the semantic expres-
sion of a clause is usually impacted by its dis-
course context. Based on this observation, we in-
troduce a clause encoder to model the latent se-
mantic relations among different clauses. Analo-
gously, we also append the relative position infor-
mation to enhance the relations between the clause
and its position. Formally,

−→
hi =

−−−→
GRUc(o

′
ci ⊕ li), i ∈ [1, n] (8)

←−
hi =

←−−−
GRUc(o

′
ci ⊕ li), i ∈ [n, 1] (9)

where n is the number of clauses in a document.
Also, the two directional hidden state

−→
hi and

←−
hi

are concatenated as the final emotion-specific rep-
resentation oi = [

−→
hi ,
←−
hi ].

2.3 Model Training
The emotion-specific representation oi with its po-
sition embedding li as the final feature for emotion
cause prediction and the model is trained by mini-
mizing the cross entropy:

yi = softmax(Wm(oi ⊕ li)) (10)

Lce = −
∑
i

ŷilogyi (11)

where Wm is a parameter matrix, ŷi and yi are tar-
get class distribution and predictive class distribu-
tion respectively.

3 Regularizers Based on Sentiment
Lexicon and Relative Position

One crucial emotion cause cue is sentiment words
since emotion causes usually express a certain sen-
timent polarity by sentiment words. However,
there is no effective mechanism to guarantee that
the above module indeed attends the words with
sentiment polarity. Beyond this, a straightforward
solution to inject position information is to di-
rectly incorporate relative word position embed-
ding, which is a weak representation of the rela-
tive distance between the emotion word and each
clause. To ease these problems, we introduce two
auxiliary regularizers:

• Sentiment Regularizer (SR.): If a clause
contains several words which exist in a senti-
ment lexicon, the calculated average weights
of these words should be properly larger than
other words. We approach this issue with an
auxiliary hinge loss function.



5617

• Position Regularizer (PR.): Relative posi-
tion is a critical emotion cause indicator: in
general the closer a clause is to the emotion
word, the higher emotion cause probability
it should be assigned. We approach this is-
sue by introducing a proxy distribution and
an auxiliary cross entropy function.

Formally, we disassemble the joint loss of emo-
tion cause detection into an original cross entropy
loss, a sentiment regularization loss, and a position
regularization loss. The new training objective is
revised as:

J (θ) = Lce + λ1 ∗ Lsr + λ2 ∗ Lpr (12)

where Lce is the original cross entropy loss (§2.3).
λ1 and λ2 are hyper-parameters. Lsr and Lpr are
two auxiliary regularization losses (§3.1 and §3.2).
θ is the parameter set.

3.1 Sentiment Regularizer
The weak causal connection between learned fea-
tures and predictions is a major issue in emotion
cause analysis. Even though sentiment words are
key to clause representation generation, most ex-
isting models do not focus on sentiment words
or place less emphasis on them when producing
clause representation. In other words, attention is
distracted by irrelevant words with less sentiment
polarity. To address this issue and sufficiently ben-
efit from linguistic resources, we explicitly en-
courage the larger margin of attention weights be-
tween sentiment words and non-sentiment words
using a sentiment lexicon. For sentiment words,
the average attention weight is calculated by:

Avgs =
1

ls

k∑
t=1

Swit (13)

Swit =

{
αit if wit ∈ ci ∩ S
0 otherwise

(14)

where wit is the t-th word of clause ci, k is the
length of ci and ls is the number of sentiment
words in ci. αit is the calculated attention weight
in §2.2 and S is a sentiment lexicon. Correspond-
ingly, for non-sentiment words:

Avgns =
1

lns

k∑
t=1

NSwit (15)

NSwit =

{
αit if wit ∈ ci − S
0 otherwise

(16)

Our training objective is to lead the model to
pay more attention to sentiment words. Thus, the
regularization term is formally expressed as:

Lsr =
∑
i

max(0,m− (Avgs −Avgns)) (17)

where m is a hyper-parameter for margin.

3.2 Position Regularizer
Empirically, emotion causes usually occur at the
positions which are very close to the emotion
word. However, another main issue is that the pre-
dictive distribution may locates the clauses that are
distant from and irrelevant to the emotion word.
The goal of this regularizer is to narrow the dif-
ference between the predictive distribution and the
true position distribution of emotion causes rel-
ative to the emotion word (in brief, true distribu-
tion). Obviously we can not obtain the true distri-
bution. Hence, we assume that it should satisfy the
following conditions: (1) It should be a normed
function within [0, 1]; (2) It should be a symmetric
function of a certain value. Based on these condi-
tions, we employ a function defined as follows:

qi =

{
1− |ri|n if − b ≤ ri ≤ b

0 otherwise
(18)

where ri is the relative distance of clause ci to
emotion word, n is the number of clauses in a doc-
ument, and b is the left and right boundary which
limits the scope of emotion cause. Then we apply
q = (q1, q2, . . . , qn) as the proxy distribution to
simulate the true distribution.

Simultaneously, from section 2.3, we get the
predictive class distribution yi of clause ci. Then,
the probability for the emotion cause at position i
can be calculated as:

pi = yi(label = 1) (19)

Similarity, we can obtain the predictive distribu-
tion of emotion causes relative to the emotion
word by:

p = (p1, p2, . . . , pn) (20)

The goal is to enforce the model to constrain the
difference between the p and q, thus, we use cross
entropy to measure the difference:

Lpr = −
∑
i

qilog(pi) (21)

Note that the two introduced regularizers work
like L1 and L2 terms, which do not introduce

4 Datasets and Implementation Details

4.1 Datasets
We select two public datasets from different lan-
guages to evaluate the proposed model: Chinese
Dataset (Gui et al., 2016) collected from SINA
city news1 and English Dataset (Gao et al., 2017)
collected from English novels. Each document of
both datasets has only one emotion word and one
or more emotion causes. It has been ensured that
the emotion and the causes are relevant. The docu-
ments are segmented into several clauses manually
for emotion cause analysis. The details about the
two datasets are summarized in Table 1.

4.2 Implementation Details
For the Chinese dataset, there is no training/test
split, we randomly divide the documents into a
training/development/test set in a ratio of 8:1:1
and partition the clauses by Jieba2. For the English
dataset, we randomly select 10% from the original
training set as the development set and lowercase,
lemmatize all the tokens by NLTK3. We evaluate
our method 25 times with different splits and then
perform one sample t-test on the experimental re-
sults by following (Gui et al., 2017). The precision
(P ), recall (R) and F-measure (F ) are employed to
measure the performance in this task.

The sentiment lexicon adopted for the Chinese
dataset consists of two parts. The first part is se-

1http://news.sina.com.cn/society/
2https://github.com/fxsjy/jieba
3http://nltk.org

lected from HowNet (Dong et al., 2006) sentiment
analysis lexicon set4 and the second part comes
from NTUSD (Ku et al., 2006). The combination
of the two parts serves as the Chinese sentiment
lexicon of this research. The English sentiment
lexicon comes from MPQA (Wilson et al., 2005)
and we only select the words with high sentiment
polarity, because they are less sensitive to contex-
tual information and usually express consistence
sentiment polarities from their prior polarity. For
both sentiment lexica, we filter out the words that
are not in the datasets. Ultimately, 2022 and 1348
sentiment words are selected for the Chinese and
English dataset respectively.

Online learning is performed with the Adam op-
timizer (Kingma and Ba, 2015) and initial learn-
ing rate 0.001 is adopted. The number of layers in
Bi-GRU is set to 2 and dropout rate 0.5 is used to
avoid overfitting. The word vectors are pre-trained
by word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) and keep un-
changed during training stage. We perform grid
search over the hyper-parameters m ({0.10, 0.15,
0.20}), the boundary b ({2, 3, 4}), the dimension-
ality of the Bi-GRU ({64, 128}), λ1 and λ2 (both
{0.25, 0.5, 0.75 }). For each corpus, the highest
F-measure combination of these hyper-parameters
is selected using development set.

5 Experiments

In this section, we will compare our RHNN model
with the following groups of methods:

• Rule-based and commonsense-based meth-
ods: Rule-based method (RB) is a traditional
rule-based method proposed by Lee et al.
(2010). Commonsense-based methods (CB)
is a knowledge-based method proposed by
Russo et al. (2011). It uses Chinese Emotion
Cognition Lexicon (Xu et al., 2013) as com-
monsense knowledge.

• Machine learning method: SVM is a
SVM classifier trained on unigrams, bi-
grams and trigrams features (Li and Xu,
2014). Word2vec is a SVM classifier
trained on word representations pre-trained
by Word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013). Multi-
kernel represents a document by a syntac-
tic structure and utilizes a modified convolu-
tion kernel method to determine which clause
contains the emotion cause (Gui et al., 2016).

et al., 2017) and the rest are reprinted from the corre-
sponding publications (p <0.001).

LambdaMART extracts emotion causes us-
ing learning to rank methods which based
on the emotion-independent and emotion-
dependent features (Xu et al., 2019).

• Deep learning method: CNN is a convolu-
tional neural network for sentence classifica-
tion (Kim, 2014). ConvMS-Memnet consid-
ers emotion cause analysis as a reading com-
prehension task and designs a multiple-slot
deep memory network to model context in-
formation (Gui et al., 2017). CANN uses a
co-attention neural network to identify emo-
tion causes (Li et al., 2018a). HCS is pro-
posed by Yu et al. (2019) using a multiple-
level hierarchical network to detect the emo-
tion causes. MANN is the current state-of-
the-art method employing a multi-attention-
based model for emotion cause extraction (Li
et al., 2019). RHNN is our proposed model.

5.1 Main Results

The experimental results on both datasets are
shown in Table 2 and Table 3, respectively. RB
yields high precision but with low recall. CB has
an opposite scenario from RB. A possible reason
is that these linguistic-based methods depend on
some cue words to identify the emotion cause, dif-
ferent rules or common sense may contain differ-
ent cue words.

For the machine learning methods, SVM and
Word2vec have similar performance on the Chi-

nese dataset, but SVM outperforms Word2vec on
the English dataset. The main reason is that the
polysemantic phenomenon is more obvious in En-
glish expressions. Multi-kernel has better perfor-
mance by capturing context information through a
syntactic tree. LambdaMART, which is based on
ranking strategy and global emotion features, per-
forms best among feature-based methods. How-
ever, both Multi-kernel and LambdaMART rely on
expensive human-based features and lack of ex-
pandability on different dataset.

Compared with CNN, ConvMS-Memnet mod-
els the context of each word and obtains better per-
formance on both datasets. The co-attention based
CANN captures the mutual relations between the
emotion clause and each candidate clause, which
has a comparable result with hierarchical-based
HCS. MANN considers the interaction between
the emotion clause and candidate clauses by de-
signing a multi-attention mechanism and achieves
the best performance among baselines.

The proposed RHNN model further improves
the performance on both datasets as shown in
the tables. The improvement is significant with
p-value less than 0.001 in one sample t-test.
Specifically, RHNN manages to boost the perfor-
mance by 3.06% in F-measure compared to Lamb-
daMART, which exhibits that by restraining the
parameters with knowledge-based regularizations,
RHNN is better to identify the emotion cause cues
than feature engineering. RHNN also outperforms
the current best-performing method MANN by
2.08% on the Chinese dataset and 6.47% on the
English dataset in F-measure respectively. Fur-
thermore, for the English dataset, our proposed
model has balance performance in precision and
recall. The reason for this phenomenon is that
RHNN can capture more emotion cue (e.g., sen-

extracting emotion causes more exactly.

5.2 Detailed Analysis

Ablations of RHNN Model The proposed
RHNN model consists of three components, in-
cluding hierarchical structure (H.), sentiment reg-
ularizer (SR.) and position regularizer (PR.). We
conduct ablation experiments to reveal the effect
of each component. As illustrated in Table 4, all
models with the proposed component consistently
improve upon the Base model, verifying the ef-
fectiveness of the proposed approach. Compare
with H. and PR. model, the SR. improve the per-
formance most. The main reason is that there are
55.24% and 66.49% of emotion causes which con-
tain sentiment words on the Chinese dataset and
English dataset respectively, enforcing the model
to pay more attention to sentiment words can en-
hance the causal connection between learned fea-
tures and predictions.

On the Chinese dataset, the RHNN achieves the
best performance with a 7.62% improvement on

Figure 2: The F-measure of different limited scopes of
emotion cause on two datasets.

the F score compared with the baseline. How-
ever, on the English dataset, the HSR model per-
forms better than the RHNN model. It may be
caused by the overlapping between components.
Besides, the performance on the English dataset
always lower about 20% in F-measure than that
on the Chinese dataset, one possible explanation
for this phenomenon is that there are more clause
structures in English expressions which is difficult
for the model to capture this information without
discourse tree.

Effect of Sentiment Regularizer To gain more
insights into our proposed model, we conduct fur-
ther experiments to examine the effectiveness of
sentiment regularizer on the subset of two datasets.
The experiment results in Table 5 show that: 1)
RHNN and HSR model achieve the best perfor-
mance on the subset of two datasets respectively,
similar observations can be found regarding on
whole dataset; 2) With sentiment regularizer, the
performance is boosted on both subsets compared
to that on the whole dataset. This is consistent with
our intuition because sentiment regularizer con-
tributes much to pick up the words with sentiment
polarity and these words are important causal indi-
cators in clauses. Meanwhile, each clause contains
sentiment words in the subsets, resulting in a better
performance on the subsets. 3) The performance
improvement on the English subset is remarkably
higher than that on the Chinese subset, one possi-
bility is that there are more explicit emotion terms
in English expression than in Chinese.

Effect of Position Regularizer From Eq.(18),
we see that the value of b limits the scope of emo-
tion cause. In this section, we further investigate
the effect of different limited scopes. For sim-
plicity and efficiency, here we only apply the PR

without sentiment regularizer.

model on this experiment. The results are shown
in Fig 2, the percentages denote the coverage of
emotion cause in datasets. For instance, 72.77%
represents that there are 72.77% emotion causes
adjoining the emotion word in English dataset.
From Fig 2, we can see that the performance
trends for the two datasets are similar, and the
performance improves with the expanding limited
scope of emotion cause. However, when the lim-
ited scope of emotion cause is larger than a certain
value (2 or 3), the performance decreases. This
may be due to the reason that the larger of lim-
ited scope, the higher coverage of emotion cause
in datasets. Nevertheless, when the limited scope
is too large, the model is forced to allocate higher
probability to these clauses which are distant from
and irrelevant to the emotion word, and then leads
to the performance degradation.

5.3 Case Study
Essentially, sentiment regularizer (SR.) aims to
enlarge the margin between sentiment words and
non-sentiment words. The question is, will the
model focus on the words with sentiment polarity?
We randomly choose one example (Ex.2) from the
Chinese dataset to visualize its attention distribu-
tion and compare the difference between plusing
sentiment regularizer or not.
Ex.2 一个老乡来到店里问起小美的情况,
(c−2)|大熊抱怨小美不好. (c−1)|她听到后感
到既伤心又生气. (c0)
Ex.2 A fellow came to store asking XiaoMei’s sit-
uation, (c−2)|DaXiong complained XiaoMei not
good. (c−1)| She heard it then felt both sad and
angry. (c0)

In this example, the cause of emotion word sad
is in (c0). The visualization results are shown in
Fig 3, we can observe that the model without sen-
timent regularizer most focus on non-sentiment
words such as XiaoMei, she and heard it which
are inessential to provoke the emotion. However,
when we plus the SR. into model, we can see
an obvious weights shift on attention distribution.

Table 6: The error instances of RHNN model for emo-
tion cause analysis.

More clearly, the model captures the sentiment
words complained and not good which are crucial
to identify the emotion cause. This shows that our
model with sentiment regularizer is more effective
in extracting the most important keywords relat-
ing to the emotion cause. Also, better results are
obtained using sentiment regularizer, this is con-
sistent with what we observed in Table 4.

Finally, we perform error analysis to understand
what types of errors are introduced with the pro-
posed model, focusing on three cases from the En-
glish dataset. The results are listed in Table 6,
where the first column depicts the content of the
emotion cause events and the second column de-
picts the emotion causes identified by RHNN. As
shown in Table 6, the emotion causes appear in
bold and emotion word is labeled between *.

From Table 6, we can find that there are two
clauses contain the emotion cause in event 1.
However, our model only detects one emotion
cause clause. In event 2, our model has an error
prediction. One possible reason is that our model
is prone to treating clauses which contain senti-
ment words as emotion cause. RHNN extracts
nothing from event 3, it may be due to the rea-
son that the far distance between the emotion word
and emotion cause clause, resulting in a difficult
understanding of causal relations. Our proposed
model is capable of getting rich emotion cause

cues with knowledge-based regularizations. How-
ever, it also introduces some noisy into emotion
cause analysis.

6 Related Work

Emotion classification is an important fundamen-
tal aspect of sentiment analysis. Going one step
further, emotion cause analysis (ECA) which aims
to discover the reason behind emotions, can be
constructive to guide the direction of future work,
i.e., improving the quality of products or services
according to the emotion causes of comments pro-
vided by users. In this section, we describe the
related work on emotion cause analysis.

Lee et al. (2010) first gave the formal defini-
tion of emotion cause analysis and manually con-
structed a dataset from the Academia Sinica Bal-
anced Chinese Corpus. Based on this corpus,
Chen et al. (2010) designed two sets of features
built on six groups of linguistic cues to detect
emotion cause. Support vector machines (SVMs)
and conditional random fields (CRFs) were in-
vestigated to detect cause or non-cause text with
extended rule-based features in existing methods
(Gui et al., 2014; Ghazi et al., 2015). Other than
rule-based methods, Russo et al. (2011) proposed
a crowdsourcing method to construct a common-
sense knowledge base for emotion cause extrac-
tion in Italian newspaper articles. But it is chal-
lenging to extend the common-sense knowledge
base automatically. Recently, Gui et al. (2016)
proposed a multi-kernel based method to iden-
tify the emotion cause from a manually annotated
emotion cause corpus. Xu et al. (2019) proposed
a method based on learning to re-rank candidate
emotion cause clauses with extracting a number of
emotion-dependent and emotion-independent fea-
tures. However, these methods are heavily depen-
dent on the expensive human-based features and
are too difficult in a real-world application.

Inspired by the success of neural network meth-
ods, deep neural models and attention mechanisms
have been widely used in emotion cause analy-
sis. Gui et al. (2017) proposed a novel deep neu-
ral network which regarded emotion cause anal-
ysis as a question-answering task. In this study,
a convolution-based memory network was intro-
duced to store the context information. Li et al.
(2018a) considered the context around the emo-
tion word as a query instead of only emotion
word to model the mutual impacts between each

candidate clause and the emotion clause. Cheng
et al. (2017) constructed a corpus based on Chi-
nese microblog and proposed to detect emotion
cause using multiple-user structures. Besides, Yu
et al. (2019) proposed a multiple-level hierarchi-
cal network-based clause selection strategy. Li
et al. (2019) proposed a multi-attention-based neu-
ral model to capture the mutual influences between
the emotion clause and each candidate clause, and
then generate the representations for the above two
clauses separately. This method achieves the cur-
rent best performance. However, the existing ap-
proaches usually focus on the local textural infor-
mation, ignoring the discourse structure (Zubiaga
et al., 2018), and prior knowledge such as senti-
ment lexicon (Qian et al., 2017) and relative po-
sition information, which can provide important
emotion cues for emotion cause analysis task.

7 Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper, we provide a regularized hierarchical
neural network (RHNN) for emotion cause anal-
ysis. The proposed model aggregates discourse
context information through a hierarchical learn-
ing structure and restrains the parameters with
knowledge-based regularizations. We evaluate the
proposed model on two public datasets in differ-
ent languages. The experimental results demon-
strate that our proposed method achieves the state-
of-the-art performance on both datasets and exten-
sive analysis confirms the feasibility of incorpo-
rating the discourse context and knowledge-based
regularizations.

To preserve the simplicity of the proposed
model, we do not consider document as a tree
structure. In the future, we will exploit how to
incorporate discourse parse tree or discourse re-
lations into emotion cause analysis task to further
improve the performance.
