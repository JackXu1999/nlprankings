Abstract

This paper presents a semantic annotation scheme for Danish adjectives,  focusing both on
prototypical semantic content and semantic collocational restrictions on an adjective's head
noun. The core type set comprises about 110 categories ordered in a shallow hierarchy with 14
primary and 25 secondary umbrella categories. In addition, domain information and binary
sentiment tags are provided, as well as VerbNet-derived frames and semantic roles for those
adjectives  governing  arguments.  The  scheme  has  been  almost  fully  implemented  on  the
lexicon of the Danish VISL parser, DanGram, containing 14,000 adjectives. We discuss the
annotation scheme and its applicational perspectives, and present a statistical breakdown and
coverage evaluation for three Danish reference corpora.

1 Introduction

This paper describes a multi-dimensional semantic classification system for Danish adjectives. The
system has been implemented for a fairly unabridged computational lexicon, with 14,000 adjectival
lemmas,  and  is  intended for  use  with Danish NLP tools  in  general,  and machine translation and
semantic correctness grading of generated Danish sentences in particular. 

Lexical resources about the semantics of adjectives are much harder to come by than corresponding
dictionaries for nouns and verbs,  not least in the context  of  less-resourced languages like Danish.
Nouns allow the construction of ontologies based on hyponym-hyperonym relations (e.g. Princeton
WordNet, Fellbaum 1998 for English, and DanNet, Pedersen et al. 2009, for Danish), and verbs can be
classified using argument relations and restrictions (e.g. FrameNet, Baker et al. 1998 and Ruppenhofer
2010, for English). However, both methods are less ideal for adjectives - only a small set of adjectives
takes arguments, hyponym-hyperonym relations are problematic, and traditional WordNet synonym
clusters and antonym relations do not constitute a true classification system. One way out is using
noun classification as a proxy and linking adjectives to nouns or verbs:

(a) property nouns denoting the property that the adjective describes, e.g. linking "hot", "tepid",
"cool", "cold", "ice-cold" etc. to the noun "temperature", a method that works well for antonomy and
scale adjectives.  Thus,  EuroWordNet (Vossen 1998) uses a "near synonymy" relation across word
classes, e.g. "obese/obesity", "infamous/infamy".

(b) derivational base: A large percentage of adjectives are morphologically derived from nouns or
verbs using suffixes, e.g. "V-lig" (V-able), "N-lig" (N-like), "N-fuld" (being full of s.th.), "N-løs" (not
having s.th.). In addition, many Danish adjectives are morphologically past or present participles and
can thus be linked to a verbal base ("V-et" - V-ed, "V-ende" - V-ing).

(c) nominal  heads: Adjectves can be classified according to their  prototypical  head houn,  using
categories  like  "animal  adjective"  ("tame" -  tame,  "vild" -  wild,  "glubsk" -  voracious)  or  "food
adjectives" ("bagt" - baked, "fersk" - fresh, "lækker" - tasty).



However, (c) lumps semantically very different adjectives together (e.g. states, quality, source, purpos
etc. for the food category), and neither (a) nor (b) is, on its own, applicable to the entire adjective
lexicon,  and  morphological/derivational  links,  in  particular,  are  slippery  ground,  as  meaning  can
change over time, and become less transparent. Thus, "huslig" ("housely") does not mean "house-like"
(the literal meaning), but rather "house-related" (tasks) or a human psychological trait of "housewife-
ness". Also, sometimes the adjective is primary in a derivation relation, as in "tapper" > "tapper-hed"
(brave  >  braven-ess),  risking  a  sparceness  of  information,  if  the  corresponding  noun  is  simply
classified as "property" exactly because its core is really adjectival.

GermaNet  (Hamp  & Feldweg,  1997)  addresses  the  problems  with  (a)  and  (b)  by  establishing  a
separate semantic class hierarchy1 for adjectives, with 16 classes at level 1 and 78 classes at level 2,
with relations  like  "green"  >  colour > perception or  "short"  > dimension > spatial.  Transparent
denominal  and  deverbal  derivations  is  classified  as  "pertainyms".  For  Danish,  Nimb & Pedersen
(2012) suggest the use of thesaurus data to build a type (c) classification by harvesting "property_of"
relations between adjectives and typical collocate classes (e.g. person, thing, feeling, food). However,
the authors mention the need for validation, and the current public version of DanNet2 does not contain
a "property_of" feature.

2 Existing resources

DanNet (and its dictionary precursor STO3) is one of two large sets of lexical resources used in Danish
language  technology.  However,  it  only  contains  about  3,000  adjectives,  with  a  flat  12-category
ontology, and while there is information about hyperonym relations to either other adjectives or nouns,
23%  are  linked  directly  to  the  top  node  "property"  or  "property:physical"  without  any  real
classificational information. The other resource is the lexicon of the Danish VISL parser, DanGram
(Bick 2001), containing 103,000 non-name lemma entries, of which about 14,000 are adjectives. The
lexicon  specifies  syntactic  word-order  information  for  11,400  of  these,  comprising  obligatory
predicative  or  attributive  use,  and  so-called  "modificational  zones"  (ordering  in  case  of  multiple
prenominal adjectives).

<pred> predicative use only: alene (alone), beliggende (situated), slut (finished)

<att> attributive use only: al (all), aldersmæssig (age-related), aldrende (becoming older)

<mod1> (specificational): bestemte alvorlige organiske sygdomme (certain serious organic diseases)

<mod2> (descriptional): bestemte alvorlige organiske sygdomme (certain serious organic diseases)

<mod3> (classificational): bestemte alvorlige organiske sygdomme (certain serious organic diseases) 

<jj>, ad-adjectival, adjectives that modify other adjectives 

On top of these syntactic tags, the adjective lexicon also contains some semantic tags. However, while
DanGram's  noun ontology4 and Danish FrameNet  (Bick 2011)  have been used in  numerous NLP
projects (treebanks, CALL, MT etc.), so far no corresponding semantic system for adjectives has been
published. Our current work strives to review, systematize and document existing semantic tags, and
to introduce and implement a completely new ontology, more akin to the GermaNet system, where
each  category  in  addition  to  its  semantic  feature  values  also  should  allow  the  prediction  of  the
semantic class of its typical head noun.

3 Category scheme

In our proposed system, the primary semantic tags used for adjectives have the form <j....> and are
combinatorially restricted feature prototypes, meaning that they specify a feature type of a certain
semantic  head  (noun)  class.  For  instance,  <jshape>  modifies  concrete  objects,  and  <jpsych>
(psychological feature) combines with human heads (<H...>), but also actions (<act>) and semiotic
products (<sem>).

There are 110-120 tags in all5, most of which can be lumped in 14 or - with subclasses - 25 umbrella 
classes, most of them linked to prototypical head types. For instance, all tags within the people groups 
imply [+hum] (human), <jappro> (appropriateness) and <jbehave> combine with actions [+act], and 
<jsem> is about features of works of art, plans, laws or speeches [+sem]. For some category 
definitions and examples, see table 3.

 people:  <jpsych> (feelings), <janat> (body features), <jage>, <jstate-h>, <jsick>, <jclo-h> 
(clothedness), <jappear> (appearance)

 effecting: <jaff> (affection), <jeff> (effecting), <jaff-h> (affected), <jimp> (important), 
 quality: <jqual> (quality), <jpower>, <jskill>, <jappro> (appropriate), <jlike> (liked), <jreg> 

(regulated)
 properties:

 inherent: <jprop>, <jtype>, <jbuild> (building), <jornam> (ornamental)
 +measure: <jsize>, <jweight>, <jtemp> (temperature), <jspeed>,
 -measure: <jshape>, <jsurf> (surface), <jsub> (composition), <jmat> (material), <jchem> 

(chemical), <jcol> (color), <jlight>
 state: <jstate>, <jdam> (damage), <jnormal>, <jres> (result), 
 sensed properties: <jpercep> (perception)

 quantity: <jquant> (quantity), <jdegree>, <jcont> (content), <jsetop> (set operation), 
<jmanner-q>

 identity: <jident> (identity), <jauth> (authentic), <jcomp> (comparison), <jname>
 cognitive:

 thought: <jcog> (cognitive), <jideo> (ideological), <jlike-h> (liking), <jmeta>
 speech: <jcom> (communication), <jling> (language)
 epistemiological: <jfact> (fact, true, likely), <jfame>
 semiotic [+sem]: <jsem>, <jgenre>, <jdomain>, <jstruct> (structure)

 event: <jevent>, <jprocess>, <jchance>, <jchange>, <jcause>, <jsit> (situation)
 doing: <jact> (action), <juse>, <jhand> (handled), <jmove>, <jmanner>, <jbehave>, 

<jmethod>, <jres> (resulting), <jcrea> (created), <jlink>, <jtarget>
 culture:

 food: <jfood>
 society: <jsoc> (social), <jpol> (politics), <jinst> (institution), <jrel> (religious), <jprof> 

(professional), <jright> (entitled)
 domain jargon: <jtech> (technical), <jjur> (law), <jmed> (medicine)

5 This number of categories was deemed a reasonable level of granularity for empirical reasons. For 
practical purposes (parsing and corpus annotation), having too many increases the error rate in automatic tagging
and risk introducing nuances that border on vagueness and often cannot be reliably distinguished by human  
annotators either. Too few categories, on the other hand, will mean a generalisation and abstraction level that 
misses out on many interesting semantic distinctions and is too course for contextual disambiguation tasks. 



 cultural products: <jV> (vehicles), <jVwater> (ships), <jclo> (clothing features)
 money: <jmon> (money), <jmon-h>, <jposs> (owned), <jposs-h> (owning), <jval>(value)

 nature: <jbio>, <jA> (animals), <jB> (plants), <jL> (place feature), <jwea> (weather)
 auxiliary: <jbe>, <jcan> (possible), <jmust>, <jmay> (allowed), <jwill> (ready to)
 space: <jnat> (nationality), <jgeo> (geography), <jloc> (location), <jdir> (direction), <jori> 

(origin), <jpos> (position)
 time: <jtime>, <jord> (order), <jper> (period)

Sentiment and polarity markers

A number of feature types exhibit a plus/minus polarity, for instance <jtemp> (temperature: hot/cold),
<jlike> (liked or disliked), <jappro> (appropriate or inappropriate). This polarity is resolved by means
of <Q+> and <Q-> tags that are primarily meant as sentiment analysis tags, but will also double in
almost all cases as polarity distinctors. "-h" marks a separate subclass  for human heads, e.g. <poss>
("owned") and <poss-h> ("owning"). Where necessary, other, more specific, non-standard semantic
head types can be added by means of a <H:...> tag, e.g. <H:furn> for "polstret" (padded). 

4 Frames for adjectives

A small, but important, proportion6 of Danish adjectives can take valency-governed arguments, almost
all in the form of prepositional phrases (pp's). In these cases it is possible to say that the adjective is
the  core  constituent  of  a  predication,  much  like  verbs  or  de-verbal  nouns.  We  classify  these
constructions using an equivalent verbnet frame, and both frame and argument structure are provided
in the adjective lexicon.

1. forelsket i (in love with) - FN:like/head§COG/i§TH [cognizer - theme]

2. bange for (afraid of) - FN:emote_obj/for§CAU/head§EXP [cause - experiencer]

3. benovet over (embarrassed about) - FN:affect_exp/head§EXP/over§CAU 

4. beslægtet med (related to) - FN:relate/med§COM/head§TH [theme - co-argument]

5. blind for (ignorant of) - FN:neglect/for§TH/head§AG [agent - theme]

6. dygtig til (good at) - FN:can/head§AG/til§ACT'icl [agent - action]

7. sur på (angry at) FN:emote/head§EXP/på§CAU'H [experiencer - cause]
sur over at (angry because)  FN:emote/head§EXP/over§ACT'fcl [experience - action]

8. ond mod (mean against) - <FN:affect_exp/head§AG/mod§EXP'H> [agent - experiencer]

9. afhængig af - FN:depend/head§EXP'H/head§SOA'act/head§BEN/af§CAU
person hooked on s.th. - FN:depend/head§EXP'H/head§SOA'act/head§BEN/af§CAU
action depending on s.th. - FN:depend/head§EXP'H/head§SOA'act/head§BEN/af§CAU
city relying on tourism - FN:depend/head§EXP'H/head§SOA'act/head§BEN/af§CAU

Each noun frame entry (FN) lists first the corresponding verb frame and then a slash-separated list of
possible semantic role arguments7 (marked §) with their slot filler conditions (1-9). We distinguish

6 Currently, about 300 adjectives have been assigned frame-carrying valencies. As for verbs and nouns, 
structural complexity correlates with token frequency, so frame-capable adjectives are overrepresented in 
running text, with a token ratio higher than their type ratio.



between  primary  conditions  and  secondary,  optional  subconditions  (present  in  6-9).  Primary
conditions are placed before the role concerned, secondary condition after it. The former are syntactic
slot  conditions  (either  'head'  or  a  bound  preposition  lexeme),  the  latter  are  categorial  conditions
concerning semantic class (e.g. 'H'=human, 'act'=action), or form conditions such as ’icl’ (non-finite
clause, 6) or ’fcl’ (finite clause, 7).

In the Danish data, adjectives only rarely have two completely different frames. More common are
cases where there is some variation within the same frame, with different prepositions (7) or different
semantic slot fillers (9) corresponding to different semantic roles. In these cases it is optional, whether
frames are duplicated (7) or fused by appending argument variants (9).

5 Coverage statistics

In  order  to  evaluate  coverage,  we  tagged  a  Danish  reference  corpus  consisting  of  DSL's  period
corpora,  Korpus90,  Korpus2000  and  Korpus2010  (Asmussen  2015),  covering  modern  post-war
Danish up to the 90s and the years around 2000 and 2010, respectively. The first corpus has a broad
genre and period scope, including some spoken data. The second is dominated by news and magazine
texts and the third includes online material of various types. Together, the three corpora can be said to
provide a fair cross-section of modern Danish.

Based on DanGram's morphological disambiguation, and a POS error rate under 1%, the corpus set
contained 5.6 million adjective tokens distributed across 27,280 adjective types. In this count, hapaxes
were ignored - inspection showed them to be mostly spelling errors and ad hoc foreign loan words. In
about 1% of adjective tokens (37% of types), the parser had to use live compounding analysis8. Table
1 shows adjectival coverage percentages for both semantic class tagging (j-tags) and domain tagging
(D-tags), first for all words, then separately for live compound analysis.

Tag type % tokens % types
semantic class tags (j-tags) 99.24 85.10
domain tags (D-tags) 95.64 73.89
j-tags / compounds 93.96 93.40
D-tags / compounds 75.99 76.82

Table 1: Corpus overage (all words)

As can be seen from the percentages, general running text coverage is very good (99.4%), but due
to obvious Zipf-curve effects type coverage is considerably lower (85.1%). Live compounds have a
worse  token  coverage,  but  better  type  coverage.  Though  surprising  at  first  glance,  this  can  be
explained by the fact that the class-controlling second parts of compounds are dominated by relatively
few, well-know suffixes and participles, leading to a good type-coverage. At the same time, because
the individual compounds are all rare compared to ordinary adjectives, there is no pronounced positive
effect of counting tokens rather than types.

If  (a) purely heuristic (i.e. non-compound) analyses, (b) lexicon-registered erroneous forms and (c)
foreign words are excluded (about 1,800 types or 11,500 tokens),  coverage increases, as could be
expected.

7 The Danish FrameNet foresees about 35 argument-capable roles and an additional 15 satellite roles

8 These are cases, where a word was unknown in the sense, that it could not be reduced to a lemma or a 
compound found in the lexicon, but where the parser was able to come up with a likely compound analysis 
of its own at run time. 



Tag type % tokens % types
semantic class tags (j-tags) 99.39 90.53
domain tags (D-tags) 95.82 78.78
j-tags / compounds 95.12 94.47
D-tags / compounds 77.01 77.75

Table 2: Corpus overage (recognized words and compounds only)

Table 3 contains a breakdown of the 22 statistically most important tag types by frequency (covering
80% of tokens and 52% of types), providing definitions and examples. For sense discrimination and
other NLP tasks, it is an advantage that the category distribution curve is relatively even, with small
differences between neighbouring frequencies,  and even the top category below the 10% mark in
token terms. By comparison, DanNet contains not only fewer items, but also exhibits a much steeper
frequency curve, indicating less discriminatory power. Thus, when looking at type frequencies, our
system "peaks" at 6%, with a spread over several, very different categories, while DanNet links 34%
of adjective types to just "Property", and equally 34% to the hyperonym "beskaffenhed" (type). Even
when  classes  and  hyperonyms  are  combined,  23%  are  linked  to  combinations  of
Property/Property:physical and "beskaffenhed".

Table 3: Semantic class distribution

Some of the categories in table 3 have a much higher type/token ration than others, indicating a larger
lexical spread, and more work for the lexicographer per annotated token. This is true not only for the



underspecified  "type"  category,  but  also  for  people's  geographical  provenance  (<jnat>),  cognition
adjectives (<jcog>) and states-of-mind (<jpsych>). 

6 Applications

The DanGram parser is used in a number of ongoing research projects, where improving adjective
annotation might have an impact.

Greenlandic machine translation

Since Greenlandic linguistic tradition, based on morphological clues, does not recognize the existence
of adjectives in the language, it is a non-trivial task to match Danish adjectives to Greenlandic lexical
items. Often, the Greenlandic "adjective candidate" can translate into either a noun or an adjective in
Danish. With a semantic-combinatorial classification of Danish adjectives, it might be easier to decide
whether a word matches the semantics of a potential head noun, and hence should be treated as an
adjective, or not.

Sentence grading

One interesting area within Intelligent Computer-Aided Language Learning (ICALL) is the automatic
generation of exercises, and the  grading of possible solutions. For instance, an ICALL system can
generate sentences or question-answer pairs based on known vocabulary. If this is done solely based
on syntactic slots, however, a large proportion of the suggested sentences will be meaningless. Thus,
when using an adjective, it has to match the semantic type of its syntactic slot, normally defined by a
noun. "Red ideas" and "angry houses" should be weeded out, while slight or metaphorical mismatches
("angry machines" or "red elephants",  if  recognized as such,  might  even contribute to making an
exercise interesting and fun.

Sentiment analysis for hate speech

Hate speech research has lately drawn considerable public and political interest, as well as funding.
Both in terms of technology (extracting and recognizing hate speech from online data) and linguistics,
it is useful to be able to perform semantic annotation, and looking at what kind of adjectives are used
in connection with hate speech target objects (immigrants, Muslims, Jews) is one way of decoding the
linguistics  of  hate  speech.  Both sentiment  analysis  and adjective semantics  are  interesting in  this
regard, and to the best of our knowledge, no complete sentiment mark-up has ever been published for
Danish adjectives.

7 Conclusions and outlook

We have presented a full-fledged lexico-semantic annotation scheme for adjectives and shown that the
implemented  Danish  version  can  achieve  99%  token  coverage  and  90%  type  coverage,  while
exhibiting a shallow frequency distribution curve with a high discriminatory potential.

It will be interesting to see if ongoing NLP work in the area of machine translation, semantic sentence
grading and hate speech recognition can be made to profit from an improved lexical base for adjective
annotation.
