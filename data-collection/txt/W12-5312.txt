ABSTRACT
We present a prototype system — named Sentiscope — for collecting daily horoscopes from
online news portals written in Croatian, detecting polarity phrases and overall sentiment
conveyed by these texts and providing sentiment-analysis-based visualizations in a graphical
user interface on the web. The system was evaluated using a dataset of daily horoscopes which
was manually annotated for (positive and negative) polarity phrases and (positive, negative and
neutral) overall sentiment. Linearly weighted kappa coefficient of 0.593 has indicated moderate
inter-annotator agreement on overall sentiment annotation. The system achieved an F1-score of
0.566 on overall sentiment and 0.402 on phrase detection. An overview of implementation is
provided — with special emphasis on the polarity phrase detection module implemented in
NooJ linguistic IDE — and the system is made available to users on the web.

1 Introduction and related work

Sentiscope is a prototype system for sentiment analysis in daily horoscopes written in Croatian.
It crawls the Croatian web on a daily basis and collects horoscope texts from several specialized
websites and daily news portals. The texts are processed with a manually designed rule-based
module for polarity phrase detection. The texts are then assigned with overall sentiment scores
which are calculated by counting polarity phrases. The results of semantic processing are stored
and the texts with the respective annotations of both polarity phrases and the overall sentiments
are provided to users via a graphical user interface in the form of a web application.

Implementation of Sentiscope draws from the work on approaches to sentiment analysis in
financial texts and related work on sentiment analysis presented in, e.g., (Ahmad et al., 2005,
2006a,b; Almas and Ahmad, 2007; Devitt and Ahmad, 2007, 2008; Daly et al., 2009; Remus et
al., 2009). More specifically, drawing from the experiment with rule-based sentiment analysis
in financial reports written in Croatian presented in (Agić et al., 2010) — which resulted with a
high precision prototype system — and the previously mentioned work on rule-based sentiment
analysis in general, we attempted to approach the problem of sentiment analysis in Croatian
text from a very specific, narrow and expectedly difficultly processable genre, i.e., horoscope
text from the web.

Alongside system implementation and evaluation, we emphasize the ambiguity of sentiment
detection in general — end especially in narrow and ambiguous domains, represented here
by horoscope text — by creating a manually annotated dataset of horoscopes and calculating
inter-annotator agreement for the overall article sentiment manual annotation task. This special
emphasis is motivated by previous explorations of properties of various sentiment analysis
challenges, relating inter-annotator agreement and task difficulty, such as (Pang and Lee, 2008)
and (Bruce and Wiebe, 1999; Wiebe et al., 1999, 2004; Shanahan et al., 2006). For example,
it is specifically stated by (Pang and Lee, 2008) that "different researchers express different
opinions about whether distinguishing between subjective and objective language is difficult
for humans in the general case." They also state that "for example, (Kim and Hovy, 2006)
note that human annotators often disagreed on whether a belief statement was or was not an
opinion while other researchers have found inter-annotator agreement rates in various types
of subjectivity classification tasks to be satisfactory." Here we implicitly address the relation
between difficulty of manual sentiment annotation and meaningfulness of tackling the same
annotation problem algorithmically. Moreover, following (Riloff et al., 2003; Wiebe, 2000;
Wilson et al., 2005), we investigate the role of certain parts of speech — such as adjectives,
adverbs, nouns and verbs — in detecting different classes of polarity phrases.

In the following sections, we describe the system implementation and evaluation on the tasks
of detecting polarity phrases and detecting overall article sentiment. The system prototype is
available on the web (http://lt.ffzg.hr/sentiscope/).

2 System implementation

System overview is given in Figure 1 (left side). The system is basically a web- and Linux-based
application built by open source technologies and it consists of four main components:

1. the focused web crawler written in PHP that collects and stores horoscopes from a number
of Croatian horoscope and daily news portals,

2. the rule-based sentiment detector that detects positive and negative polarity phrases

116

Figure 2: Screenshot of the user interface

in horoscope text and is implemented as a set of local grammars designed in the NooJ
linguistic development environment (Silberztein, 2004, 2005),

3. overall sentiment detector written in PHP that estimates overall article sentiment, i.e.,
horoscope sentiment by counting positive and negative polarity phrases and

4. the graphical user interface for assessing sentiment-annotated daily horoscopes and
sentiment statistics over periods of time, as illustrated by Figure 2 and 4.

All horoscopes, respective polarity phrase annotations and overall sentiment scores are stored
in a MySQL database. The user interface currently provides daily horoscopes with in-line
annotations for all twelve zodiac signs (see Figure 2) and historical data in the form of overall
sentiment diagrams. Both visualizations also conveniently and entertainingly serve as indicators
of sentiment inconsistencies across zodiac signs and web sources. However, regardless of the
overall purpose (or purposelessness) of such texts, it is shown here that texts from the specific
horoscope genre written in Croatian are very difficult to process with respect to sentiment
annotation and thus deserving the given research focus.

117



Figure 3: Example of positive polarity phrase detection using NooJ local grammars — hr. nećete
biti razočarani (en. you will not be disappointed)

As mentioned previously, overall article sentiment is estimated from the number of detected
phrases denoting positive or negative sentiment. Currently, articles are tagged as positive if the
number of positive phrases is greater than the number of negative phrases contained within
them and vice versa. If their counts are equal, the article is tagged as neutral. Polarity phrase
detection is done by using a series of rules in form of local grammars or lexical finite state
transducer cascades implemented in NooJ linguistic development environment, as illustrated in
Figure 3.

Rules were designed in two stages — first from scratch and then by observing a development
set of horoscope texts. For development and testing, we have collected horoscopes from seven
largest Croatian websites containing daily horoscopes as indicated by the Google search index.
Horoscopes were collected from 2012-02-11 to 2012-05-10. 7,716 articles with 484,179 tokens
were collected. 333 articles were chosen for the development set and were manually annotated
for overall sentiment and polarity phrases. Observed agreement of 75.97% on overall sentiment
annotation was measured between the two annotators. The kappa coefficient indicated good
strength of this agreement (0.641), while the linearly weighted kappa coefficient (0.593)
assessment indicated moderate agreement. The stats are given in Table 1 and they indicate
that the disagreement between the annotators was distributed almost exclusively within the
category of neutral sentiment articles. The annotators agreed on positive sentiment in 80.69%
of the annotations, while the observed agreement was 82% on negative sentiment and 66.09%
on neutral sentiment. If we were to entirely exclude the category of neutral sentiment from
data in Table 1, the observed agreement would be 99.44% and the respective kappa coefficient
would amount to 0.989 and thus represent very good agreement strength.

Table 2 emphasizes the relation between the polarity phrases detected in articles and the overall
sentiment of the articles and as such, it is the theoretical baseline for building a system that
estimates overall sentiment of text from the number and type of polarity phrases that it contains.
The table shows that the positive sentiment articles tend to contain much more positive polarity
phrases, as 71.80% of the positive polarity phrases was found in positive sentiment articles, as
opposed to 3.33% in negative and 24.87% in neutral sentiment articles. The same was found to

Table 2: Relation between overall article sentiment (+, –, x) and polarity phrases (<p>, <n>)

apply for negative polarity phrases as well: 65.11% of them were located in negative sentiment
articles, 5.48% in positive sentiment articles and 29.41% in articles carrying neutral overall
sentiment. This justified a system design in which polarity phrases are counted in articles and
overall sentiment assigned from the polarity group with the highest count. In addition to this,
Table 2 also shows the number of articles in which both positive and negative polarity phrases
were observed (table column both), along with separate counts of positive and negative polarity
phrases (table columns <p> in both and <n> in both) for these articles. The distribution further
supports the system design, being that positive polarity phrases are once again predominant in
positive sentiment articles (75.89% positive vs. 24.11% negative) and negative polarity phrases
dominate in negative sentiment articles (73.61% negative vs. 26.39% positive) while they are
almost evenly spread in neutral sentiment articles (50.43% positive vs. 49.57% negative).

Rules for polarity phrase detection are grouped in two NooJ local grammars — one for positive
sentiment and one for negative sentiment detection (see Figure 1, right side). Each of these
grammars consists of lists of words and phrases for three parts-of-speech: adjectives, nouns and
verbs. Another part-of-speech generally considered important in sentiment analysis — adverbs
— are included within adjectives, due to the specifics in Croatian morphology, i.e., the fact that
many adverbs in Croatian are homographic with adjective forms in singular nominative case in
neuter gender: e.g., brzo dijete (en. fast child) brzo trči (en. runs fast). Words and phrases are
manually derived from a number of daily horoscopes and — except for the characteristic key
words and key phrases for the horoscope domain — there is a number of domain independent
words and phrases, e.g., dobro (en. good), izvrsno (en. great), odlǐcno (en. excellent) for positive
sentiment, and loše (en. bad), slabo (en. weak), nedovoljno (en. unsatisfying) for negative
sentiment. We derived 170 words and phrases for negative and 139 words and phrases for
positive sentiment detection. In addition to the lists of positive and negative sentiment phrases
based on their POS, there is also an aggregate of words which express positive or negative
sentiment in itself, but in context, they often occur with a negation, which results in expressing
the opposite sentiment. In the rules, there are 33 negated positive and 17 negated negative
words and phrases (an example grammar for detecting negated negative words and phrases is
given in Figure 3), which adds up in a total of 203 words and phrases for negative sentiment
detection and 146 words and phrases for positive sentiment detection.

3 Evaluation

The evaluation was conducted on a manually annotated held-out test set containing 11,500
tokens in 168 articles. The initial prototype of the polarity phrase detection module, that was
designed from scratch in NooJ, was first evaluated on the test set in a form of a dry run test
for purposes of further development. The results are given in Table 3 joint for positive and
negative polarity phrases. The results of the dry run were shown to be rather low, with an
F1-score of only 0.321. The rules were thus tuned, as previously mentioned, by observing the
development set and another two tests were performed with the improved rules — one on the
development set itself and the other on the test set. These results are also given in Table 3 and
they show an improvement over the baseline for both the development set and the test set.
Being that horoscope texts are highly complex in terms of irregularities of phrases, i.e., showing
rare re-occurrences of polarity phrases among texts from varying sources, these scores were
considered to be a satisfactory entry point for overall article sentiment detection.

The results of system evaluation with respect to overall article sentiment are given in Table
4. The rows of the confusion matrix represent gold standard annotation while the columns
present system annotation. The matrix clearly indicates that the system performance is high for
the task of discriminating between positive and negative overall sentiment, while its accuracy
steeply decreases upon inclusion of the neutral sentiment article category. This observation
is also supported by the inter-annotator agreement and the data in Table 1 and 2. The
correlation between the number of polarity phrases and overall sentiment given in Table
2 is clearly manifested in the evaluation results, being that the overall performance of the
system is satisfactory even if the rule-based phrase detection module performance might be
considered somewhat low in absolute terms, especially with respect to those obtained for, e.g.,
well-structured financial texts (Agić et al., 2010).

Table 4 also shows that positive words and phrases are more accurately detected than the
negative ones — the observed difference in F1-scores of the positive and negative phrase
detection is as high as 0.11 in favor of the positive phrase detection. Considering that there
are substantially more negative words and phrases in the rules for detection (203 vs. 146) and
that there are also considerably more negated positive phrases than vice versa (33 vs. 17),

Table 5: Horoscope sentiment by web source on 2012-05-18

we can conclude that in this type of texts, unlike positive sentiment which is expressed more
clearly and explicitly, negative sentiment is often covert and masked with various modifiers and
within very complex expressions where negations occur far from the positive word (e.g., in hr.
danas nećete imati baš dobar dan, en. you will not have such a good day today), so they are very
difficult to detect with the rules.

Table 5 is an illustration of the sentiment trend information provided by the system. As
mentioned previously, the texts are processed on a daily basis and both the texts and the
respective annotations are stored in a database. This enables graphical display of sentiment
trend across text sources (websites) and text categories (zodiac signs). The table indicates
that the overall horoscope sentiment is consistently inconsistent across the seven different web
sources and — perhaps even more interestingly — that the possible consistencies might be
observed only within single web sources, not respecting the zodiac signs. In the specific case of
sentiment analysis in the narrow domain of daily horoscope texts, this might therefore support
the claim that perhaps the most reliable sentiment detection feature is the daily sentiment
of the text authors. Sentiment trend is more explicitly encoded in Figure 4, as it presents an
illustration of a sentiment time series with respect to zodiac signs (top) and web sources of
horoscope texts (bottom). Figures for all categories, i.e., zodiac signs, web sources and different
time frames are available via the system web interface (http://lt.ffzg.hr/sentiscope/).

Conclusion and perspectives

Detecting text sentiment in a very specific and narrow domain such as daily horoscope texts
has shown not to be trivial and easy to achieve, given that such texts are characterized both
by specific and often very complex phrases and syntax and a particular, domain-dependent
style, which can be specific for each individual author, as well. This considered, obtained
F1-score of 0.566 for overall system accuracy and 0.402 for phrase detection accuracy, with
observed annotator agreement of 75.97% (kappa 0.641, linearly weighted kappa 0.593), are
here regarded as satisfactory and useful.

For future work, obtained data — the collected texts, the system and the processing results —
can be used for different types of linguistic analysis, e.g., discourse analysis and socio-linguistic

analysis. Improvements to the implemented simple link between polarity phrases and overall
sentiment might also be investigated, being that the current implementation trivially addresses
(especially) neutral sentiment articles. Besides, the developed model could be easily adjusted
and applied for sentiment annotation and visualization in other domains.
