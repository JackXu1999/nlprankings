Abstract

The aim of this paper is to argue for a coherent Universal Dependencies approach to the core
vs. non-core distinction. We demonstrate inconsistencies in the current version 2 of UD in this
respect – mostly resulting from the preservation of the argument–adjunct dichotomy despite the
declared avoidance of this distinction – and propose a relatively conservative modification of UD
that is free from these problems.

1 Introduction

Universal Dependencies (UD; Nivre et al. 2016) has recently become a de facto standard for the rep-
resentation of dependency treebanks. An important feature of UD is that it attempts not to represent
the argument–adjunct distinction. This is stated explicitly in the paper introducing UD (Nivre et al.
2016: 1661): “The scheme [. . . ] makes a distinction between core arguments (e.g., subject and object)
and other dependents, but does not attempt to distinguish complements vs. adjuncts” (recall that com-
plements are non-subject arguments), and it is confirmed on the current official UD webpage:1 “[The
UD taxonomy] does not make a distinction between adjuncts (general modifiers) versus oblique argu-
ments (arguments said to be selected by a head but not expressed as a core argument).” This decision
is not justified in Nivre et al. 2016, but it is briefly motivated on the UD webpage (cf. fn. 1): “[T]he
argument/adjunct distinction is subtle, unclear, and frequently argued over. For instance, syntacticians at
certain times have argued for various obliques to be arguments, while at other times arguing that they are
adjuncts, particularly for certain semantic roles such as oblique instruments or sources. We take the dis-
tinction to be sufficiently subtle (and its existence as a categorical distinction sufficiently questionable)
that the best practical solution is to eliminate it.”

This view goes against the theoretical-linguistic received wisdom – linguistic theories invariably as-
sume a fundamental argument–adjunct dichotomy (AAD). However, it has been repeatedly observed that
AAD has been flawed ever since its conception: the three criteria for distinguishing arguments from ad-
juncts given by Tesnière (1959) – the father of modern valency theory – are pairwise incompatible (Vater
1978a, 1978b, Przepiórkowski 1999). Multiple tests proposed since then have often been inconsistent
with linguists’ intuitions about AAD (and with each other) and short-lived; as cautiously noted by Tu-
tunjian and Boland (2008, 633), “[t]he sheer number of [purported argument/adjunct] tests underlines
the fact that no single test is entirely satisfactory”. The existence of such a universal dichotomy is also
called into doubt by typologists (see, e.g., Croft 2001: 272–280 and Haspelmath 2014). We have argued
recently that even those theories which put much emphasis on the argument–adjunct distinction have
not proposed any operational way to distinguish these two classes (Przepiórkowski 2016a, 2017b). On
the constructive side, we have demonstrated that a relatively modest modification of some assumptions
of Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG; Bresnan 1982, Dalrymple 2001, Bresnan et al. 2015) results in
a theory that does not assume AAD at any level of representation and in any theory-internal mechanisms

(Przepiórkowski 2016b, 2017a; Patejuk and Przepiórkowski 2016). This means that neither syntax nor
compositional semantics necessarily presuppose AAD. Hence, given that AAD is both non-operational
and unnecessary, the avoidance of AAD is a very attractive feature of UD, one that should be consistently
implemented and preserved.

Unfortunately, UD does not consistently follow the policy expressed in the quotes evoked at the begin-
ning of this section. The main aim of this paper is to identify those aspects of UD which do preserve AAD
and to propose a modified version of the current standard which consistently eschews this ill-defined di-
chotomy. In particular, we demonstrate that the presence of some vestiges of AAD in UD results in
serious inconsistencies in the current classification of dependents as core or non-core – a dichotomy
which is fundamental for UD.

2 Argument–Adjunct Dichotomy in UD

The declared UD avoidance of any reference to AAD is consistently implemented in the case of broadly
nominal (that is, also prepositional) dependents of verbs. For example, in the case of English, nominal
subjects (nsubj) may be defined as those dependents which agree with verbs, nominal objects (obj)
– as those bare nominal (NP) dependents which normally occur immediately after the verb, and nom-
inal indirect objects (iobj) – as those NP dependents which normally occur immediately after the direct
object. The actual UD definitions of nsubj, obj and iobj are different and somewhat internally incon-
sistent (cf. §4.2), but the point remains that no reference to AAD is made here. All other broadly nominal
non-predicative dependents – including prepositional (PP) dependents – are classified as obliques (obl).
This way the phrase at the restaurant, when it is a dependent of a (non-copula) verb, is always marked
as oblique, whether it is an argument (e.g., I looked at the restaurant) or an adjunct (e.g., I fell at the res-
taurant) according to the advocates of AAD. Hence, there is no argument–adjunct dichotomy lurking in
the process of deciding whether a typical broadly nominal dependent of a verb is core or non-core. Below
we will show that the situation is very different in the case of clausal dependents of verbs – both ‘closed’
(usually finite) and ‘open’ (controlled, often infinitival) – and in the case of secondary predicates.

2.1 Closed Clausal Dependents

Ordinary (non-controlled) subordinate clauses which are dependents of verbs are marked in UD either
as csubj, if they are subjects, or as ccomp, if they are not subjects but should still be classified as
core, or as advcl, if they are non-core. Let us assume that it is possible to recognise csubj dependents
(e.g., in English, as immediately pre-verbal clauses), but how should other clausal dependents be split
into core (i.e., ccomp) and non-core (i.e., advcl)? Current guidelines do not make this clear, saying
the following about ccomp: “A clausal complement of a verb or adjective is a dependent clause which is
a core argument. That is, it functions like an object of the verb, or adjective”2 (emphasis ours). The first
sentence, making reference to the notion of complement (i.e., non-subject argument), explicitly relies
on AAD: complement clauses are marked as ccomp, adjunct clauses – as advcl. The second sentence,
making reference to the notion of object, could in principle avoid AAD, if there were independent criteria
of deciding when a clausal dependent “functions like an object”. Since no such criteria are provided in
UD guidelines, UD practitioners implicitly rely on AAD and classify dependent clauses as ccomp when
they seem to be (non-subject) arguments, and as advcl – when they seem to be adjuncts.

It might seem then that both sentences have the same effect, but in fact they differ. On the first – broader
– view, complement clauses are treated as core, but they are not necessarily assumed to be objects. That
is, it is possible for a single head to have an obj dependent and a ccomp dependent. On the second
– narrower – view, complement clauses are (direct) objects, so – given that a head may have at most
one (direct) object dependent – it is not possible for a single head to have both an obj dependent and
a ccomp dependent. In fact, such a check is implemented in the UD validating script, UDAPY, and the
accompanying validation web page states this explicitly: “No predicate can have more than one direct
object. Ccomp counts as direct object.”3

Both approaches are found in UD (release 2.1) treebanks. The broader view is implemented, inter
alia, in the Latvian LVTB treebank and in the English EWT treebank (the latter henceforth abbreviated
to UDENEWT), where in both cases about 1% of utterances contain a head with an obj and a ccomp
dependent; one of the 160 such cases in UDENEWT is:
(1) Apparently the City informed [them]obj [that no permit is required]ccomp.

On the other hand, some treebanks – including the Finnish TDT treebank and the Polish SZ treebank
(UDPLSZ, for short) – take the stronger position: if two dependents compete for the status of the direct
object, only one of them may be labelled as obj or ccomp, and the other one is given the status of
indirect object, iobj. As indirect objects are assumed to be nominal, never clausal, ccomp always
wins the competition for the direct object status, so the nominal is marked as iobj. But this has very
unwelcome consequences, as it forces some most prototypical direct objects to be reanalysed as indirect
objects only because the verb also subcategorises for a clause. This is illustrated with example (2) from
UDPLSZ, where the verb spytało ‘asked’ combines with the numeral subject kilka osób ‘several people’,
the accusative nominal mnie ‘me’ and the subordinate clause czy jestem. . . , lit. ‘whether I am. . . ’.

‘Some people have asked me whether feminism made me happier.’
Since the subordinate clause is marked as ccomp, mnie ‘me’ must be (and is) marked as an indirect
object, iobj, contrary to linguistically motivated definitions of direct objects in Polish. On the view
prevailing in contemporary grammars of Polish, the only reasonable definition of direct objects in Polish
is as those dependents which become subjects under passivisation – and mnie ‘me’ above satisfies this
definition. A more traditional view refers to accusative bare nominal complements – and mnie ‘me’
satisfies this definition as well. In fact, when the same verb, SPYTAĆ ‘ask’, occurs in UDPLSZ with an
accusative complement but without a clausal complement, the accusative nominal is marked as obj, as
in the following sentence:
(3) Chciał

wanted
[ją]obj
her.ACC

spytać
ask.INF

[o
about

wiele
many

rzeczy]obl.
things

‘He wanted to ask her about many things.’
Note that mnie ‘me’ in (2) and ją ‘her’ in (3) bear exactly the same semantic role with respect to the two
forms of the verb SPYTAĆ ‘ask’ and have the same grammatical properties (passivisability, grammatical
case, etc.), so this is a clear case of intra-linguistic annotation inconsistency.

One line of defence could be that there are two valency frames for SPYTAĆ ‘ask’ witnessed in these
two examples and that the accusative complement – while having the same semantic role – is assigned
different grammatical functions in these frames. Consider, however, the attested4 example (4), which
involves a coordination of a nominal dependent with the preposition O ‘about’ and a clausal dependent
with the complementiser CZY ‘whether’. Such examples make it clear that the accusative phrases in
(2)–(3) occupy the same position within the same valency frame, in which another position may be
realised either as a subordinate clause, as in (2), or as a prepositional phrase with the preposition O
‘about’, as in (3), or as a coordination of such two realisations, as in (4).5,6

Let us summarise. Two views on what it means to be a (non-subject) core clausal dependent are present

5Since the accusative dependent of SPYTAĆ ‘ask’ is claimed to be iobj in (2) and obj in (3), it is not clear – on the

approach discussed here – what its label should be in (4); hence the question mark.

in UD guidelines. The broader view makes an explicit reference to AAD and defines ccomp as any non-
subject clausal argument. The narrower view defines ccomp as a clausal object, but – given the lack of
an independent definition of such clausal objects – this also boils down in practice to assuming AAD
and treating all non-subject clausal arguments as ccomp. Moreover, the narrower view, as currently
implemented, is linguistically naïve and leads to violations of annotation consistency. In §4, we propose
a solution that may be viewed as a variant of the narrower view, but one that does not make reference to
AAD and does not lead to annotation inconsistencies.

2.2 Open Clausal Dependents

While ccomp marks non-subject ‘closed’ clausal arguments, xcomp is used, inter alia (see §2.3 below),
to label so-called ‘open’ non-subject core clauses, i.e., clausal dependents with obligatorily controlled
subject, as in the English example from UDENEWT: “So [Bush]nsubj stopped [flying]xcomp.” Just as in the
case of ccomp, the xcomp relation is understood differently in different treebanks. In UDENEWT, xcomp
dependents are again understood broadly, as any open complements, and they do not compete with pro-
totypical direct objects. For example, asked in the following (partial) sentence has an obj dependent
and an xcomp dependent: “I asked [them]obj [to change it]xcomp. . . ”. On the other hand, in UDPLSZ, the
prototypical (passivisable, accusative) direct object je ‘them’ of the verb uczą ‘teach’ in (5) is marked as
an indirect object, probably due to the presence of an xcomp dependent of the same verb, which wins
the competition for the direct object position:
(5) . . . uczą

teach.3.PL
[je]iobj
them.ACC

[zjeżdżać
slide.INF

na
on

racicach]xcomp.
hooves

‘. . . they teach them to slide on their hooves.’
Again, in both cases reference is made to AAD: non-subject open dependents are marked as xcomp if

they are arguments, and as advcl – if they are adjuncts. And, again, the narrower view goes against the
linguistically-motivated definitions of direct object and results in annotation inconsistency, as illustrated
by (6), where the corresponding (passivisable, accusative) dependent nas ‘us’ is marked as a direct object,
obj, while the iobj label is used for the taught material, tego ‘this’ (which semantically corresponds
to the xcomp dependent zjeżdżać na racicach ‘slide on hooves’ in (5)).

[nas]obj
us.ACC

uczy
teach.3.SG

[Boże

Słowo]nsubj.
word.NOM

‘God’s Word teaches us that.’
Note that, unlike in the case of ‘closed’ clausal dependents, a different label (xcomp vs. advcl

here, ccomp vs. advcl there) is not the only difference between the two analyses. If an ‘open’ clausal
dependent is analysed as core, i.e., as xcomp, there is an additional secondary nsubj edge in the
enhanced representation, as in (7). Such a secondary edge is missing if the dependent is analysed as
non-core, as in (8). But since core vs. non-core distinction relies on AAD, this means that the structure
of the resulting dependency graph depends on the dichotomy that UD claims to eschew.

2.3 Secondary Predicates

Finally, AAD is also preserved in UD in the treatment of secondary predicates, as in the English “I recall
him as smart and genial” (from the iWeb corpus, https://corpus.byu.edu/iweb/). Should the
depictive dependent, smart and genial, be analysed as an argument of recall, or as its adjunct? Valency
dictionaries do not agree about this (see Appendix A). As is made clear in the description of the xcomp
label,7 secondary predicates analysed as arguments are xcomp dependents of the verb, with an enhanced

nsubj relation to the nominal they predicate of, as in (9). However, those analysed as adjuncts are acl
dependents of the nominal elements they predicate of, as in (10).

Moreover, if the subject of predication is missing or realised non-locally, as in “(This is the man)
I recall as smart”, the secondary predicate is still an xcomp dependent of the verb, if it is analysed as an
argument (cf. (11)), but it is marked with a third dependency label, advcl, if it is analysed as an adjunct
(cf. (12)). Hence, in the case of secondary predicates, the resulting structures depend on the ill-defined
AAD even more than in the case of ‘open’ clausal dependents, again, despite the declared avoidance of
this dichotomy in UD.

2.4 Summary of AAD in UD
While UD avows to forsake AAD, the core vs. non-core distinction boils down to the argument–adjunct
dichotomy at least in the case of clausal dependents of verbs – both ‘closed’ (clausal, often finite) and
‘open’ (controlled, often infinitival) – and in the case of secondary predicates. While this dichotomy
is vague and controversial, the resulting dependency representations differ sharply, depending on the
classification of the relevant constituent as an argument or an adjunct. The following section shows that
these vestiges of AAD in UD also make it impossible to coherently classify certain dependents as core
or non-core.

3 Core vs. Non-Core Distinction in UD

The fact that non-subject core nominal dependents are understood very narrowly – as bare nominal direct
objects and perhaps indirect objects – while non-subject core clausal dependents may be understood
more broadly – as any clausal complements – leads to some serious inconsistencies.

Consider the verb ASK. In sentences such as “We asked the president about the hunt for Osama bin
Laden”, the prepositional phrase about the hunt for Osama bin Laden will receive the obl – i.e., non-
core – dependency label (this is the annotation of such dependents of ASK in UDENEWT). On the other
hand, in the sentence “We asked the president whether Americans are safe at home”, the subordinate
interrogative clause, being an argument, is a core dependent, so it will be annotated as ccomp (again,
this is the annotation of such subordinate clause dependents of ASK in UDENEWT). If so, what is the
coreness status of the coordinate dependent of asked in the following example from the iWeb corpus?
(13) At the White House, we asked the president [[whether Americans are safe at home]ccomp and [about

the hunt for Osama bin Laden]obl].
At the moment, UD’s reply is inconsistent: the broadly nominal second conjunct of this coordinate struc-
ture is a non-core dependent of the verb, and the clausal first conjunct is a core dependent of the verb. On
the natural assumption that whole dependents should be classified as core or non-core (see Appendix B),
and that the coordinate structure whether Americans are safe at home and about the hunt for Osama bin
Laden is such a dependent of asked, the coreness status of this dependent is incoherent.

It is easy to provide an arbitrary technical solution of this conceptual problem: the coreness of a co-
ordinate dependent could be resolved by fiat to the coreness of the first conjunct. So, in (13), the coordin-
ate structure would be ruled as core, given that the first conjunct is a ccomp – i.e., core – dependent



3842

of asked. The arbitrariness of this technical solution is made clear by the fact that, by adopting it, the
coreness of a coordinate structure depends on the order of conjuncts. Thus, in “We asked the president
about the hunt for Osama bin Laden and whether Americans are safe at home”, the coordinate dependent
would be classified as non-core, because the first conjunct is now an obl dependent of asked.

This problem is not limited to dependents of ASK; similar examples may be found in corpora, which
involve other heads and other kinds of coordinated dependents, including the following, again from iWeb:
(14) Dennis is an important voice of moderation who worries [[whether Colorado has adequate water

reserves]ccomp, and [about the future of family farms]obl].
(15) Mr. Bernhardt told him [[about the "mediandisease" virus]obl and [that Adrian’s blood analysis

showed that he was virus free]ccomp].
(16) We counsel them [[about the dangers of giving birth]obl and [that their baby might be born

infected]ccomp].
Neither is the problem limited to English; a Polish example of this kind is in fact given above – see (4).
There, the prepositional oblique (non-core) dependent o rekomendowane leczenie ‘about recommen-
ded treatment’ of the verb spytać ‘ask’ is coordinated with the clausal (core) dependent czy można się
spodziewać wypadania włosów ‘whether one should expect hair to fall out’.

Similar inconsistency involves xcomp dependents: they are core, but they may fill the same position
as non-core dependents, as in the following attested8 example:
(17) Campbell made two visits to the home of domestic abuse victim Miss A, during which he asked her

[[for a kiss]obl and [to go on a date with him]xcomp].
Again, for a kiss would currently be classified as a non-core obl and to go on a date with him is a typical
xcomp (also in UDENEWT), i.e., a core dependent, so the status of the coordinate phrase as a core or non-
core dependent of asked is inconsistent.

4 Proposal

4.1 Basic Idea

The basic idea follows directly from the discussion of the previous sections. Since there are no generally
accepted objecthood criteria of clausal dependents of verbs, only those clausal dependents should be
treated as objects which may be coordinated with nominal – i.e., uncontroversial – objects. Similarly,
clausal dependents which may be coordinated with broadly nominal obliques – especially, prepositional
phrases – should be classified as non-core. On this approach, the clausal dependent of the Polish verb
SPYTAĆ ‘ask’, as in (2), where it is marked as ccomp, should be classified as non-core, because it may
be coordinated with a prepositional oblique, as in (4). (Note that the obstacle to treating the passivisable
accusative mnie ‘me’ in (2) as a direct object would then disappear.) Similarly, given coordination facts
such as (13), the clausal dependent of the English ASK in constructions involving an NP object (cf. the
president in (13) and in its variants discussed in the main text) would also be classified as non-core, as
it may also be coordinated with a prepositional oblique. The same holds for appropriate ‘closed’ clausal
dependents of verbs in (14)–(16). Also some ‘open’ dependents, hitherto marked as xcomp, would have
to be classified as non-core, on the basis of data such as (17).

The question arises whether, on this approach, there are any clausal dependents left that would have to
be classified as objects rather than as obliques. The answer is yes: it is clear that some clausal dependents
must be analysed as direct objects. Take the following classic example (Sag et al. 1985: 165):
(18) Pat remembered [[the appointment]obj and [that it was important to be on time]ccomp].
In the simpler “Pat remembered the appointment”, the NP the appointment is an uncontroversial direct
object. Hence, the coordinate phrase the appointment and that it was important to be on time in the
above sentence must also be considered the direct object.9 If so, it must be concluded that the direct
object position of the verb REMEMBER may be realised as either an NP or a clause. But this in turn

kiss-vulnerable-13615076

9Sag et al. 1985 convincingly argue that unlike category coordination cannot be explained away as ellipsis.



3843

implies that the subordinate clause in “Pat remembered that it was important to be on time” should also
be considered a direct object. Note that this conclusion does not lead to undesired consequences of the
kind discussed in §§2.1–2.2 above: the NP and the clause do not compete for the status of direct object,
as only one of them (or a single coordinate phrase) may occur with REMEMBER: *“Pat remembered
the appointment that it was important to be on time”. Obviously, such constructions are not limited to
linguistic papers, as the following examples from the iWeb corpus testify:
(19) I do remember [[a lot of wine bottles]obj and [that Felix spoke almost nothing]ccomp].
(20) Well, my initial reaction was, I have to assume [[the worst]obj and [that he’s really going to take his

life]ccomp].
(21) One guy who had a registered one really didn’t know [[the law]obj and [that he had to register the

gun in this state]ccomp].
Neither are they limited to English, as illustrated by the following Polish example (from the National
Corpus of Polish; http://nkjp.pl/; Przepiórkowski et al. 2011, 2012):
(22) Milena

Milena.NOM

dywan]ccomp]. . .
carpet
‘Milena sees the devastation and that the oozing thing is soiling the carpet. . . ’

Again, the same reasoning may be applied to ‘open’ clausal dependents, xcomp, as the following
attested examples illustrate:10

(23) She wants [[a career in virtual reality]obj, and [to perhaps even found her own company]xcomp].
(24) Homeless people need [[a work ethic]obj and [to be self-reliant]xcomp], Bender said.
(25) He remembers [[the cocktail napkins]obj, and [to serve the ladies first]xcomp].
Exactly such constructions in Polish are analysed in Patejuk and Przepiórkowski 2014, on the basis of
the classic (Kallas 1993: 123) example (26).
(26) Chcę

i

[papierosa]obj].
cigarette.ACC

‘I want to drink and (I want) a cigarette.’
Hence, according to the current proposal, all the examples cited in this section, (18)–(26), show that

the relevant heads (marked in italics) may combine with clausal dependents “functioning like objects”.
There are two immediate consequences of this basic proposal. First, since some obligatorily controlled

– i.e., ‘open’ – clausal dependents (e.g., the infinitival dependent of some uses of ASK; cf. (17)) are now
analysed as non-core, it would be useful to distinguish such ‘open’ oblique clauses from ‘closed’ oblique
clauses, just as ‘open’ object-like clauses (xcomp) are distinguished from ‘closed’ object-like clauses
(ccomp). For the time being we retain the label advcl for the ‘closed’ oblique clauses and we introduce
the label xadvcl for ‘open’ oblique clauses. In Appendix C, we provide independent motivation for
such ‘open’ obliques, and also for ‘open’ – obligatorily controlled – subjects, called xsubj for now.
Thus, we propose to extend the repertoire of basic dependents of verbs from (27) to (28).

(27)

clausal csubj ccomp advcl
open xcomp

(28)
subject object non-core

nominal nsubj obj/iobj obl
clausal csubj ccomp advcl
open xsubj xcomp xadvcl

Second, while some clausal dependents retain their status as core (cf. (18)–(26)), many clausal de-
pendents which are prototypical arguments according to the advocates of AAD will now be analysed
as non-core. While this may be perceived as a disadvantage of the current proposal, it is in fact its ad-
vantage, as it increases the internal consistency of UD: the treatment of broadly nominal dependents is

10The first example is taken from https://www.usatoday.com/story/sponsor-story/xq/2017/04/03/

3844

fully analogous. There, only very few of traditional arguments are assigned the status of core depend-
ents: subjects, bare nominal direct objects and perhaps bare nominal indirect objects. The whole class of
prototypical – but prepositional – arguments, as in “wait [for somebody]obl”, “rely [on somebody]obl”,
“nibble [at something]obl”, etc., is relegated to obliques, together with prototypical adjuncts.11 We see no
reason not to adopt the same solution in the verbal domain: apart from closed and open subjects (csubj,
xsubj) and objects (ccomp, xcomp), all other clausal dependents should be relegated to the respective
classes of ‘clausal obliques’, i.e., advcl and xadvcl. If this solution seems difficult to accept at first,
it is only because of the unfortunate names UD assigns to such ‘clausal obliques’, names which suggest
their necessarily adverbial character; in §4.3, we will propose a more adequate naming scheme.

Let us take stock of the proposal so far. Unlike in the current UD practice, we propose to take seriously
the stance expressed in the UD guidelines that (non-subject) core clausal dependents “function like an
object” and mark as ccomp and xcomp only those ‘closed’ and ‘open’ clausal dependents which may
be coordinated with uncontroversial – nominal – objects. The other (non-subject) ‘closed’ and ‘open’
clausal dependents should be marked as advcl and xadvcl (but see §4.3 below). But apart from
making precise the recommendation that (non-subject) core clausal dependents should “function like
objects”, this proposal has a number of other advantages. First, it removes explicit and implicit references
to AAD in the treatment of clausal dependents of verbs. Second, it is free from inconsistency problems
with the previous narrow understanding of core clausal dependents (nominal direct objects reanalysed as
indirect objects because of the presence of a clausal dependent). Third, it is free from the problem of the
incoherent coreness status of certain coordinate dependents.

4.2 Direct and Indirect Objects Revisited

The above subsection concentrated on obliques and on uncontroversial direct objects. What about indirect
objects? Can clausal dependents be coordinated with indisputable indirect objects and, hence, be claimed
to “function like indirect objects”? The answer depends on a particular understanding of the distinction
between direct and indirect objects. The current UD practice follows the linguistic tradition: indirect
objects are those NPs in double object constructions which bear the semantic role of a recipient or
a benefactor. Thus, in (29), from UDENEWT, the NP you immediately following the verb is the indirect
object, and the next NP, a voice mail, is the direct object:
(29) I left [you]iobj [a voice mail]obj on Friday.
If so, there are probably no clausal dependents that should be analysed as indirect objects – with the
possible exception of free relatives, it is difficult to imagine such a clausal dependent bearing the semantic
role of a recipient or a benefactor. So, for example, in the attested12 (30), the ‘closed’ clausal conjunct
should be analysed as a direct object, because the nominal conjunct, balance, is marked as a direct object
(and the preceding NP, me, is marked as an indirect object):
(30) Mother Nature taught [me]iobj [[balance]obj, and [that regular pattern interrupts can negate radical

change]ccomp].
Similarly for the ‘open’ clausal conjunct in the following attested sentence (from Patejuk and
Przepiórkowski 2014):
(31) My uncle said to hell with that and taught [me]iobj [[karate]obj, and [to fire weapons]xcomp].

However, as is often the case with linguistic tradition, this traditional view confuses different levels
of linguistic representation, namely, semantic roles and (syntactic) grammatical functions. As discussed
at length in Andrews 2007, grammatical functions correlate with semantic roles, but – in the end – the
precise scope of particular grammatical functions must be defined intra-linguistically, on the basis of
such ‘coding strategies’ as case marking, agreement and word order, as well as on the basis of diathesis
alternations (especially, passivisation). In the case of English, case marking and agreement do not dis-
tinguish the two NPs in double object constructions, but word order potentially does: on the simplest
definition of direct objects – as those NPs which necessarily (apart from well-defined constructions, such

11Similarly in the case of arguments which are not nominal or clausal at all, as in “behaving in some way” or “treating
somebody in some way”; they are assigned the advmod label (also in UDENEWT , despite being arguments on most accounts).

as topicalisation, heavy NP shift, etc.) immediately follow the verb – it is the pronoun me that should
be analysed as the direct object in the two examples above. This stance is strongly supported by another
grammatical property that such initial – immediately post-verbal – NPs in ditransitive constructions share
with prototypical direct objects in monotransitive constructions, namely, they normally passivise in all
varieties of English, unlike the non-initial NPs, which passivise only in some varieties and under certain
conditions: “I was taught balance by Mother Nature” vs. %“Balance was taught me by Mother Nature”
(where % indicates limited acceptability). Hence, as also argued in Andrews 2007: 184–188 with refer-
ence to passivisation facts, it is the first post-verbal NP – the recipient or benefactor – that should be
considered the direct object in double object constructions in languages such as English.

Note that the UD guidelines are actually inconsistent about the status of the immediately post-verbal
NP in double object constructions. While the fragment on indirect objects13 defines them with reference
to the semantic roles of recipient and benefactive, the fragment about direct objects14 defines a (direct)
object as “[t]ypically, [. . . ] the noun phrase that denotes the entity acted upon or which undergoes a
change of state or motion (the proto-patient).” These two definitions are often in conflict, as in the case
of “My uncle taught me karate”, where me is a much better candidate for the recipient or benefactive
role than karate, so it should be classified as iobj, but it is also clearly an “entity acted upon”, “which
undergoes a change of state”, so it should be classified as obj.

Given the arguments in Andrews 2007 and the inconsistency of current UD guidelines, we assume that
the immediately post-verbal NP in English double object constructions is the direct object. Unfortunately,
Andrews is not very clear about the status of the NP following the direct object, but he generally denies
the possibility of indirect objects in English: “In English, Bantu, and many other languages. . . , we do not
seem to find even prima facie plausible candidates for an indirect object grammatical relation” (Andrews
2007: 190). If so, perhaps the notion of core dependents should be limited to subjects and (direct) objects,
and all other broadly nominal dependents – not only PPs but also the NPs following direct objects –
should be treated as oblique. In fact, within LFG, this view is argued for in Alsina 1996 and Patejuk and
Przepiórkowski 2016. On this view, the above two examples should be labelled as follows:
(32) Mother Nature taught [me]obj [[balance]obl, and [that regular pattern interrupts can negate radical

change]advcl].
(33) My uncle said to hell with that and taught [me]obj [[karate]obl, and [to fire weapons]xadvcl].

Constraining cores to subjects and normally immediately post-verbal direct objects would also ex-
plain the following facts (Nathan Schneider, p.c.), otherwise somewhat awkward for the basic proposal
presented in the previous subsection:
(34) He told [me]obj [[an idea]obl and [that he thought it was viable]advcl].
(35) He told [me]obj [[about an idea]obl and [that he thought it was viable]advcl].
The labels indicated in these examples reflect the constrained understanding of cores: in both cases both
conjuncts are oblique, so the whole coordinate dependent is oblique. However, on the standard UD view,
(34) involves a coordination of a direct object an idea and a finite clause, which – for this reason – must
also be analysed as core. But (35) indicates that such a finite clause is oblique, as it is coordinated with
the oblique about an idea. Hence, in the sentence “He told me that the idea was viable”, the clausal
dependent should be analysed as core on the basis of (34) and as oblique on the basis of (35). On the
view advocated here, this potential problem for the current proposal is avoided: when a post-verbal NP
(i.e., the direct object) is present, the following clause is treated as non-core.

In fact, there is additional evidence that there is a valency frame of TELL with a syntactic position
which may be realised by an NP, a PP or a clause: not only is it possible to coordinate an NP and
a clause, as in (34), or a PP and a clause, as in (35), but it is also possible to coordinate an NP and a PP
directly, as in the following examples from the iWeb corpus (simplified here):
(36) I told her [[the story]obl and [about my own experiences]obl].
(37) I. . . told them [[the situation]obl and [about the expungement]obl]. . .

14http://universaldependencies.org/u/dep/obj.html



3846

This supports the decision to treat both realisations – bare nominal and prepositional – as oblique (given
that only subjects and direct objects are core).

4.3 Limited Reintroduction of AAD
Of course, any proposal to relegate to the obliques various dependents treated so far as core only increases
the sometimes perceived need to distinguish between argument-like obliques and adjunct-like obliques.
To accommodate this desire, we propose to adopt a version of the solution presented in Zeman 2017,
namely, to optionally subtype non-core dependents into ‘arguments’ – obl:arg, advcl:arg and
xadvcl:arg – and ‘adjuncts’ (no :arg suffix), but with an important proviso that this subtyping
should be optional and treebank-specific. Linguists have not made much progress since Tesnière’s 1959
three pairwise-incompatible criteria, so particular languages and treebanks should be free in applying
such subtyping or not and, if so, they should be free in deciding how they understand this distinction.

In summary, we propose the system of basic ad-verbal dependency relations in (38) (complemented
by vocative, expl, etc.). Given the proposal in Appendix C of renaming labels in a way that makes
more clear the orthogonality of grammatical function (subj, obj and obl) and grammatical category
and ‘openness’ status (n, c, x), this table translates into the more transparent table (39).

(38) subject object non-core
(arg) adj

nominal nsubj obj obl:arg obl
clausal csubj ccomp advcl:arg advcl
open xsubj xcomp xadvcl:arg xadvcl

(39) subject object non-core
(arg) adj

nominal subj:n obj:n obl:n:arg obl:n
clausal subj:c obj:c obl:c:arg obl:c
open subj:x obj:x obl:x:arg obl:x

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we identified two rather fundamental problems in the current (version 2) UD schema: re-
liance on AAD despite declared avoidance of this dichotomy and the resulting inconsistent approach to
the core vs. non-core distinction (most conspicuous in unlike category coordination). We aimed at a rel-
atively conservative modification of the schema – cf. (38) and the less conservative but more transparent
(39) – that solves these problems, as well as the problem discussed in Appendix C, namely, the lack of
support for obligatorily controlled subjects and obliques. The crux of the proposal is the definition of
(non-subject) core clausal dependents as “functioning like objects” according to the coordination test.
We also considered the possibility of constraining the notion of core dependents to subjects and dir-
ect objects, and we accommodated for the proposal of Zeman 2017 to allow for a – treebank-specific
– distinction between argument-like and adjunct-like obliques. We strongly believe that adopting these
proposals will increase both intra-lingual and inter-lingual consistency of UD treebanks and, hence, of
multiple tasks currently relying on dependency parsing.

Appendices

A Depictive Dependent of RECALL

The argument/adjunct status of various depictive dependents is perhaps even more controversial than
that of other types of dependents. The Valency Dictionary of English (Herbst et al. 2004) mentions
the depictive dependent introduced by as in the case of the verb REMEMBER (and illustrates it with “I
remember her as pretty and sort of tallish”), but not in the case of RECALL. On the other hand, this
type of dependent is considered an argument (or core) of both verbs in both FrameNet (Ruppenhofer
et al. 2016) (both verbs evoke the Remembering_experience frame) and in PropBank (Kingsbury
and Palmer 2002) (rolesets remember.01 and recall.02).15 Moreover, neither dictionary mentions
the possibility of an as-less depictive in the case of REMEMBER, as in “I look at Macie [. . . ] and try
to remember him young” (abridged from the iWeb corpus). Given the level of uncertainty about the
argument/adjunct status of such secondary predicates, UD representations should not differ dramatically
depending on their AAD classification. But – as discussed in the main text and illustrated in (9)–(12) –
they currently do. Appendix C proposes a solution that minimises such differences – see (48)–(51) there.

B Coordination of (Un)Like Grammatical Functions

The system of relations adopted in Universal Dependencies is a “mixed functional-structural system”.16

The core vs. non-core distinction is a very coarse-grained functional distinction: some grammatical func-
tions – especially, subject and direct object – are core, other are non-core.

While linguists do not any longer believe that only the same syntactic categories may be coordinated,
and many examples of unlike category coordination are given in the main text, they assume that – apart
from some well-defined exceptions to be discussed below – only the same grammatical functions may
be coordinated. For example, in the ditransitive construction, the direct object cannot normally be co-
ordinated with the other NP argument: *“John gave Mary and a book”. As core grammatical functions
are different from non-core grammatical functions, this means that core dependents cannot normally be
coordinated with non-core dependents. In other words, coordinating a core dependent and a non-core
dependent would result in the coordination of different grammatical functions, contrary to the over-
whelming generalisation that only the same grammatical functions may be coordinated.

There are two classes of exceptions to this generalisation, both very constrained empirically. The first
(pointed to us by Amir Zeldes, p.c.) is sylleptic zeugma, as in:
(40) He made [[his apologies]obj and [for the door]obl].
Such constructions, in which the two conjuncts invoke two different meanings of the head, have a meta-
linguistic feel and they are easy to distinguish from genuine coordination.

The second exception is the so-called lexico-semantic coordination (Sannikov 1979, 1980), occurring
mainly in Slavic and in some neighbouring languages (Paperno 2012), as in the following sentence from
the National Corpus of Polish (cited here after Patejuk and Przepiórkowski 2012b: 463):17

(41) Obiecać
promise.INF

można
may

[[wszystko]obj
everything.ACC

i
and

[wszystkim]iobj].
everyone.DAT

‘One may promise everything to everyone.’
As discussed in Patejuk and Przepiórkowski 2012a, 2012b and in Paperno 2012, such constructions are
limited to certain classes of pronouns and quantifiers, including question pronouns (so-called wh-words),
negative pronouns (so-called n-words) and pronominal-like words expressing existential or universal
quantifiers (the latter illustrated in (41)). Again, such exceptional constructions are easily distinguished
from run-of-the-mill cases of coordination, where the sameness of grammatical functions is preserved.

15VerbNet (Kipper et al. 2000, Kipper et al. 2006) does not seem to contain the relevant meaning of RECALL, so it is not
discussed here.

C Open Dependents in UD

UD assumes that obligatory control only targets object-like core dependents, and not subjects or obliques.
This is a reasonable first approximation, but cross-lingual facts show that it is ultimately false.

First, obligatory control into subjects, while rare, occurs in languages as diverse as Balinese and Polish.
For example, Arka and Simpson 1998 argue convincingly that in the Balinese (42), in which the main
verb orahin ‘ask’ is in the so-called objective voice (OV), the sequence teka mai prajani ‘come here
immediately’ is the subject of this main verb and that its own subject (i.e., the subject of teka ‘come’) is
obligatorily controlled by another dependent of the main verb, Nyoman.
(42) teka

come
mai
here

prajani
immediately

ane
REL

orahin
OV.ask

tiang
1

Nyoman
Nyoman

‘Coming here immediately is what I asked Nyoman to do.’
While in Balinese control into subject clauses is related to the phenomenon of objective voice, in

Polish it is a matter of lexical properties of some copular constructions (Patejuk and Przepiórkowski
2018) as well as, possibly, some (very rare) verbs, especially, UDAĆ SIĘ ‘succeed in, manage’, as in the
following example from UDPLSZ:

18

(43) Nie
NEG

udało
manage.3.SG.N

im
them.DAT

się
RM

uruchomić
start.INF

ciągnika.
tractor.GEN

‘They didn’t succeed in starting the tractor.’
Such examples involve strict (not partial, etc.; Landau 2013) obligatory control into the infinitival clause.
Moreover, the infinitival clause should be analysed as the subject here; while it triggers the 3rd person
singular neuter ‘default agreement’ (Dziwirek 1990) with the verb, expected when the subject is non-
nominative or lacks case altogether (Przepiórkowski 1999), full subject–verb agreement is witnessed
when the infinitival phrase is replaced by a nominative phrase:
(44) Nie

NEG

udał
manage.3.SG.M

im
them.DAT

się
RM

rozruch
start.NOM.SG.M

ciągnika.
tractor.GEN

‘They didn’t succeed in starting the tractor.’
Current UD guidelines do not make it possible to adequately handle control into subjects in languages
such as Balinese or Polish: as controlled core dependents, such infinitival phrases should perhaps be
marked as xcomp, but since they are subjects, they should actually be marked as csubj.19

In Polish, there are also clausal dependents which are obligatorily controlled despite being prototypical
adjuncts. Such dependents are headed by adverbial participles, sometimes called converbs, as in (45),
where the implicit subject of the participle patrząc ‘looking’ is obligatorily controlled by hrabia ‘count’,
the subject of the main verb przysiadł ‘sat down’.
(45) Hrabia

count.NOM.SG.M
przysiadł,
sat.3.SG.M

bezmyślnie
thoughtlessly

patrząc
looking

przed
before

siebie.
self

‘The count sat down, looking ahead thoughtlessly.’
Again, according to the current guidelines, such obligatorily controlled adverbial participial clauses may
either be marked as advcl, losing information about control, or as xcomp, wrongly promoting such
clauses to the status of core dependents. Recognising such open adverbial clauses is a natural step in
UD: just as the xcomp relation is based on the eponymous grammatical function in LFG, so a new
relation could be added to UD based on LFG’s XADJUNCT function.

Let us note that the above considerations make clear an elegant symmetry between different kinds of
dependents, one that is missing in the current UD system: just as there are three kinds of object-like
dependents – nominal (obj and perhaps iobj), ‘closed’ clausal (ccomp) and ‘open’ – controlled –
clausal (xcomp), the same tripartite distinction should be made within subjects and within obliques. In
the case of subjects, the distinction is currently made between nominal subjects (nsubj) and broadly
verbal subjects (csubj), but the examples above show that a subclass of controlled subjects should be

18The particle SIĘ is the so-called ‘reflexive marker’, RM, which – as in this case – is an inherent part of the verb, without
any anaphoric meaning. NEG in (43) stands for ‘negative marker’.

19In UDPLSZ , the infinitival clause in (43) is marked as an xcomp, thus losing information that it is the subject.



3849

carved out of csubj – let us call this subclass xsubj. Similarly, the current class of modifier clauses
should be split into closed modifier clauses – let us still call them advcl – and obligatorily controlled
modifiers, say, xadvcl. This leads to the repertoire of basic dependents of verbs given in (28) in the
main text.

The addition of these two relations has the effect of narrowing down the scope of csubj and advcl
so that open dependents fall out of these (and into xsubj and xadvcl, respectively). Obviously, all
open dependents – not just xcomp – are now expected to involve additional enhanced dependencies,
indicating the relation between their covert subjects and some dependents of the higher predicate (usually,
object or subject). This means that the difference between dependency representations (7)–(8) will now
be reduced to the difference in label name:

(46)

I wanted to sleep .

nsubj

mark

xcomp

punct

nsubj mark

xcomp

punct

nsubj

(47)

I came to sleep .

nsubj

mark

xadvcl

punct

nsubj mark

xadvcl

punct

nsubj

One welcome consequence of this proposal is that the representation of secondary predicates is uni-
form now: object-like secondary predicates still bear the xcomp relation, but oblique-like secondary
predicates always bear the xadvcl relation to the verb now, rather than bearing the acl relation to the
predicated nominal, if it is present, and the advcl relation to the verb, otherwise. Also, in both cases an
enhanced relation points at the subject of secondary predication (if locally present). Thus, the analysis
is essentially the same, whether the secondary predicate is considered core or non-core, with the only
difference being the name of one dependency label (xcomp or xadvcl); the following representations
should be compared to (9)–(12) in the main text.

(48)

The symmetry between the three types of dependents – nominal, ‘closed’ clausal and ‘open’ clausal
– can be made more conspicuous by renaming the labels as in (52).20 However, these new names still
mix two different types of information: grammatical function (subj, obj and obl) and grammatical
category and ‘openness’ status (n, c, x). We propose to separate these two orthogonal types of informa-
tion and make the bare grammatical function the main label of dependency relation, with categorial and
‘openness’ information given as subtypes, as in (53).

20The distinction between direct and indirect objects, if needed (see §4.2), could then be handled via a subtype to the nobj
relation, e.g., nobj:sec.



3850

(52)
subject object non-core

nominal nsubj nobj nobl
clausal csubj cobj cobl
open xsubj xobj xobl

(53)
subject object non-core

nominal subj:n obj:n obl:n
clausal subj:c obj:c obl:c
open subj:x obj:x obl:x

Given this last naming scheme, the relation of the whole coordinate structure to its head becomes clear,
even in the case of unlike category coordination. For example, the two conjuncts in (54) (based on (13)
in the main text) are obl:c and obl:n, so the whole coordinate structure could be labelled as obl,
and similarly for (55), (56) and (57) (based on (17), (19) and (24) in the main text).
(54) At the White House, we asked the president [[whether Americans are safe at home]obl:c and [about

the hunt for Osama bin Laden]obl:n]obl.
(55) Campbell made two visits to the home of domestic abuse victim Miss A, during which he asked her

[[for a kiss]obl:n and [to go on a date with him]obl:x]obl.
(56) I do remember [[a lot of wine bottles]obj:n and [that Felix spoke almost nothing]obj:c]obj.
(57) Homeless people need [[a work ethic]obj:n and [to be self-reliant]obj:x]obj, Bender said.

Once the syntactic category of a dependent is expressed by a subtype, an unlike category coordination
dependent could bear a relation which does not mention such a subtype. For example, the representation
of the relevant fragment of (55) could be as in (58).
(58)

he asked her for a kiss and to go

obj:n

mark

det

obl conj

cc

subj:n

obj:n

mark

det

obl:n

obl:x

conj

cc

subj:n

As in the case of the previous dependency structures, the differences between the basic representation
(at the top) and the enhanced representation (at the bottom) are marked in red. Thus, while the enhanced
representation contains dependency edges from asked to particular conjuncts, labelled as obl:n (for
a kiss) and obl:x (to go), the basic representation contains just one edge labelled as obl. Addition-
ally, the enhanced representation contains the explicit control information in the form of the subj:n
dependency from the second conjunct to the controller her. This way it is possible to represent in UD
the possibility of “control into selected conjuncts”, somewhat problematic for some linguistic theories
(Patejuk and Przepiórkowski 2014).
