Abstract

In this paper we present the results of a study
investigating the diachronic changes of four
stylistic features: average sentence length, Au-
tomated Readability Index, lexical density and
lexical richness in 20th century written En-
glish language. All experiments were con-
ducted on the largest existing diachronic cor-
pora of British and American English – the
Brown ‘family’ corpora, employing NLP tech-
niques for automatic extraction of the fea-
tures. Additionally, we compare the trends
of changes between the two English varieties
and make suggestions for future studies of di-
achronic language change.

1 Introduction

As time elapses, language changes and those
changes are present at various levels of the lan-
guage structure: vocabulary, phonology, morphol-
ogy and syntax (Kroch, 2001). Most of the previ-
ous studies of language change in English tended
to focus on the phonetic and lexical rather than
the stylistic or syntactic changes. Furthermore, the
vast majority of the early sociolinguistic and his-
torical linguistic studies of language change did
not provide textual evidence for their claims, i.e.
they were not corpus-based or the used corpora
were not large and representative enough. Bauer
(1994) set higher methodological standards for di-
achronic studies as he was among the first who
sought to support his statements with textual ev-
idence (Mair and Leech, 2006).

In his study of authorship attribution, Holmes
(1994) defines style of the text “as a set of mea-
surable patterns which may be unique to an au-
thor”. In the context of language change, this defi-
nition could be slightly amended and the style de-
fined as a set of measurable patterns which may be
unique to a particular period of time. In an exten-
sive overview of applications in stylochronometric
approaches in the last sixty years (Stamou, 2008)

it is hypothesised that changes in certain aspects of
an author’s writing style ought to be detectable by
using appropriate methods and stylistic markers.
Inspired by this hypothesis, one of the main goals
of our study is to investigate whether diachronic
changes in certain aspects of the writing style used
in a specific text genre can be detected by using
the appropriate methods and stylistic markers (fea-
tures).

Different authors, even from the same period
of time, will exhibit various styles. Consequently,
this will be epitomised by very heterogeneous re-
sults in each observed year and genre, making gen-
eral changes in style not readily detectable. There-
fore, our first goal is to establish a methodology
which would be appropriate for the investigation
of these types of diachronic changes. This would
lead to more precise and statistically justified con-
clusions in the corpus-based studies of diachronic
linguistics.

Our second goal is to explore diachronic
changes of several well-known stylistic markers:
average sentence length, Automated Readability
Index, lexical density and lexical richness in two
major English language varieties – British and
American and to detect whether those changes
were present in both of those varieties. As we are
using the mutually comparable corpora of British
and American English, we are able to compare the
changes of these two language varieties and to ex-
amine whether they followed the same trends of
stylistic changes.

We base our methodology on the largest pub-
licly available diachronic corpora of the 20th cen-
tury written English language – Brown ‘family’
corpora (Leech and Smith, 2005) and NLP tools
provided by the state-of-the-art Connexor Machi-
nese Syntax parser1.

2 Related Work

Various studies in the field of stylistic variation
and change use both the historical and sociolin-
guistic approach. Typical examples of this can
be seen in the early studies of author’s and pe-
riod styles (Gordon, 1966; Adolph, 1968; Ben-
nett, 1971). A preponderance of subsequent stud-
ies allude to the textual dimensions and relations
used in Biber (1988) and follow the works of
Biber and Finegan (1986, 1988, 1989). Westin
(2002) and Westin and Geisler (2002) explore
stylistic changes in the 20th century in the Corpus
of English Newspaper Editorials (CENE) across
the five linguistic dimensions described in (Biber
and Finegan, 1988). They employ the methodol-
ogy based on a multi-dimensional framework pre-
sented in (Biber, 1985; 1988).

The emergence of the FLOB and Frown corpora
in the 1990s, compared with the previous LOB and
Brown corpora, offered new possibilities for di-
achronic studies of written English language in the
20th century across two major English varieties –
American and British English. Mair and Hundt
(1995), Mair (1997, 2002), Mair, Hundt, Leech
and Smith (2002), Smith (2002, 2003a, 2003b),
Leech (2003, 2004), Leech and Smith (2006) and
Mair and Leech (2006) exploited the possibilities
of the Brown ‘family’ corpora by investigating the
trends of changes in various lexical, grammatical
and syntactic features. All of these studies were
conducted on manually corrected POS tagged cor-
pora and used the log likelihood test as a measure
of the statistical significance of the results.

To our best knowledge, there is no mention
of any investigation of diachronic changes of the
four stylistic features we used in our study nor
studies which describe automatic extraction of
the features from the raw text corpora by using
NLP techniques. All methodologies used in the
previous studies of language changes required a
great amount of human annotation or manual cor-
rections which are time-consuming and labour-
intensive or they relied on the use of very specific
language tools.

3 Corpora

The Brown ’family’ corpora (Leech and Smith,
2005) consist of four mutually comparable cor-
pora publicly available as part of the ICAME Cor-

pus Collection2. Two of these contain texts written
in British English, published in 1961 and 1991, re-
spectively:

• The Lancaster-Oslo/Bergen Corpus of British
English (LOB)

• The Freiburg-LOB Corpus of British English
(FLOB)

The other two contain texts written in American
English, published in 1961 and 1992, respectively:

• The Brown University corpus of written
American English (Brown)

• The Freiburg-Brown Corpus of American
English (Frown)

All four corpora share the same sampling frame,
as the LOB3, FLOB4 and Frown5 corpora were de-
signed to closely match the structure of the Brown
corpus6 with the aim to provide an opportunity to
compare diachronic changes within two major va-
rieties of the written English language (Leech and
Smith, 2005).

Each corpus is a one-million-word corpus, con-
sisting of 500 texts of about 2000 running words
each, selected at a random point in the original
source. The sampling range covers 15 text genres,
which can be grouped into four more generalised
categories:

• Press (Press: Reportage; Press: Editorial;
Press: Review)

• General Prose (Religion; Skills, Trades and
Hobbies; Popular Lore; Belles Lettres, Bi-
ographies, Essays)

• Learned (Miscellaneous; Science)

• Fiction (General Fiction; Mystery and De-
tective Fiction; Science Fiction; Adventure
and Western; Romance and Love Story; Hu-
mour)

In this study we separately investigate diachronic
stylistic changes in each of the four main text cat-
egories.

4 Methodology

Although all four corpora are available in their
tagged versions with the annotated sentence
boundaries, those boundaries are not consistent
throughout them. The LOB and FLOB tagged ver-
sions were manually corrected and therefore 100%
accurate, while the Brown and Frown corpora are
not manually corrected. Furthermore, some in-
consistencies regarding the sentence boundaries
in the cases of direct speech and itemised sen-
tences are present among different corpora. There-
fore, we decided to use the raw text versions of
the LOB, FLOB, Brown and Frown corpora (di-
vided into original portions of 500 texts of approx-
imately 2,000 words each) and parse them with
the Connexor Machinese Syntax parser in order to
achieve more consistent sentence splitting, tokeni-
sation and lemmatisation. The sentence bound-
aries identified by the parser offered a fairer com-
parison of the results among the corpora which
was of primary importance for this study.

Connexor Machinese Syntax parser is based on
linguistic methods and its lexicon contains hun-
dreds of thousands of base forms. For compi-
lation of the lexicon various large corpora were
used, among which the most common were news
texts, bureaucratic documents and literature (Con-
nexor Oy, 2006b). In cases when the word can-
not be found in the lexicon, word class and base
form are determined by using the heuristic meth-
ods (Connexor Oy, 2006b). POS accuracy of the
Machinese Syntax parser measured on Standard
Written English (benchmark from the Maastricht
Treaty) was 99.3% with no ambiguity (Connexor
Oy, 2006b). The earlier research of Samuelsson
and Voutilainen (1997) reported excellent accu-
racy of the software used as the base for the cur-
rent version of the parser. The fact that the lexicon
of the Machinese parser was built by using simi-
lar text genres as those represented in the Brown
’family’ corpora ensures a high accuracy of the
analysis completed in this study.

In the following two sub-sections we list some
of the specificities of the tokenisation and lemma-
tisation procedures used by the Machinese parser.
This is important for better understanding and in-
terpreting the results provided in this study.

4.1 Tokenisation

The Connexor Machinese parser has a specific
treatment of the contracted negative form and ’s.

Contracted negative form and its antecedent
verb are treated as separate tokens. E.g. in the case
of isn’t, the verb and negation are treated as two
separate tokens is and not and correspondingly as
two separate base forms be and not.

Treatment of ’s depends on its role in the sen-
tence (Connexor Oy, 2006a). In the cases where ’s
represents a genitive form, e.g. “ ... Roy’s United
Federal Party ...” (LOB:A01), Roy’s is treated as
one token Roy’s and corresponding base form is
roy. In other cases where ’s represents the contrac-
tion of the verb to be (is) or to have (has), e.g. “
... he’s nice ... ” (LOB:P05), the personal pronoun
and verb contraction are treated as two separate to-
kens – he and is. Accordingly, they are treated as
two separate base forms – he and be.

4.2 Lemmatisation

In this sub-section, we describe the results of the
lemmatisation process for the three word types –
possessive pronouns, derived adverbs and EN and
ING forms, as they differ between the current and
the previous versions of the parser.

4.2.1 Base forms of possessive pronouns and
derived adverbs

The current version of the Machinese parser as-
signs to possessive pronouns their own base forms
(lemmas), e.g. the base form of the word yours
in the current version of the parser is yours, while
in the previous versions possessive pronouns were
assigned the base forms of their corresponding
personal pronouns, e.g. the base form of the word
yours in the previous versions of the parser was
you (Connexor Oy, 2006b).

Base forms of derived adverbs, e.g. im-
mediately, fundamentally, absolutely, directly
(LOB:A01) are assigned immediately, fundamen-
tally, absolutely, directly as their base forms in the
current version of the parser while in the previ-
ous versions they were assigned the following base
forms: immediate, fundamental, absolute, direct.

4.2.2 EN and ING forms
The current version of the parser assigns different
base forms for EN and ING forms which repre-
sent the present or past participle of a verb than
for those representing corresponding nouns or ad-
jectives. Previous versions of the parser were as-
signing the same base forms for all four possible
cases of EN and ING forms. For example, in the
sentence:

80



“The Government decided to adjust the
financing ...” (LOB:A01)

the assigned base form for the noun financing is
financing while the older versions of the parser
would assign finance as the base form for the same
word financing in the given context.

Similarly, in the sentence:

“Sir Roy is violently opposed to
Africans getting an elected majority in
Northern Rhodesia ...” (LOB:A01)

the assigned base form for the adjective elected
is elected while the older versions of the parser
would assign elect as the base form for the same
word elected in the given context.

In the above sentence, the words opposed and
getting are assigned oppose and get as the base
forms in all versions of the Machinese parser, as
they represent the past and present participle of the
verbs oppose and get, respectively.

5 Experimental settings

We conducted two sets of experiments:

• Stylistic diachronic changes in British En-
glish in the period 1961–1991

• Stylistic diachronic changes in American En-
glish in the period 1961–1992

The first experiment was conducted on LOB
(1961) and FLOB (1991) corpora and the second
experiment on Brown (1961) and Frown (1992)
corpora.

In both experiments we investigated the di-
achronic changes over the four main text cate-
gories: Press, General Prose, Learned and Fiction
separately, as the preliminary results had shown
different trends of changes among these four text
categories.

As stylistic markers we used the following four
features:

• Average sentence length (ASL)

• Automated Readability Index (ARI)

• Lexical density (LD)

• Lexical richness (LR)

Average sentence length was measured as the
total number of words divided by the total number
of sentences for each text (eq.1), using the sen-
tence and word boundaries returned by the parser.
Words containing only punctuation marks were
not counted.

ASL =
total number of words

total number of sentences
(1)

Automated Readability Index (Senter and
Smith, 1967; Smith and Kincaid, 1970) belongs
to the formative era of readability studies and was
listed among eleven most commonly used read-
ability formulas (McCallum and Peterson, 1982)
of that time. It is calculated using the following
formula:

ARI = 4.71
c

w
+ 0.5

w

s
− 21.43 (2)

where c, w and s represent, respectively, total num-
ber of characters, words and sentences in the text.
The result of the Automated Readability Index
gives the US grade level necessary to understand
the given text.

Lexical density is computed as the number of
unique word types (tokens) divided by the total
number of tokens in the text (eq.3).

LD =
number of unique tokens

total number of tokens
(3)

Low lexical density indicates many repetitions of
the same words throughout the text, while high
lexical density suggests a use of a wider range of
vocabulary. This feature has been used as a stylis-
tic marker in (Ule, 1982) and for dating works in
(Smith and Kelly, 2002).

Lexical richness is computed as the number of
unique lemmas divided by the total number of to-
kens in the text (eq.4).

LR =
number of unique lemmas

total number of tokens
(4)

The use of lexical richness separately from lexi-
cal density was proposed by Corpas Pastor et al.
(2008) who argued that “lexical density is not in-
dicative of the vocabulary variety of an author as
it counts morphological variants of the same word
as different word types”. Following this argument,
we make a distinction between lexical density and
lexical richness and investigate both features sep-
arately.

6 Results and Discussion

The results of the first and second experiment are
given separately (sub-sections 6.1 and 6.2, respec-
tively). The results of each experiment are divided
into two tables, where the first table contains the
results of the investigation of diachronic changes
of ASL and ARI, and the second table contains re-
sults of the investigation of diachronic changes of
LD and LR. Each feature contains two columns –
‘change’ and ‘p’.

Column ‘change’ represents the relative change
of the feature over the period 1961–1991/2, mea-
sured as a percentage of the starting value in 1961.
The sign before the value signifies the direction
of the change; ‘+’ corresponds to an increase and
‘−’ to a decrease. Both the starting and end-
ing values in years 1961 and 1991/2, respectively,
were previously calculated as an arithmetic mean
of the feature values in all texts of the relevant text
category (Press, Prose, Learned or Fiction) and
corpus (LOB or FLOB in the sub-section 6.1 or
Brown and Frown in the sub-section 6.2).

Column ‘p’ represents the p-value of the two-
tailed t-test applied on the results obtained for each
text separately (in the corresponding text category
and corpus) and used as a measure of statistical
significance. For the results with a p-value lower
than the chosen critical value 0.05, we are more
than 95% sure that they represent real diachronic
changes rather than being a consequence of faulty
sampling. Those results were considered as statis-
tically significant and reliable enough to be used
for making further hypotheses.

Given that the corpora used in the two ex-
periments are mutually comparable, we are able
to make a comparison of the trends of changes
between British and American English in sub-
section 6.3.

6.1 Diachronic changes in British English

Results of the first experiment – diachronic stylis-
tic changes in British English over the period
1961–1991 are presented in Table 1 and Table 2.

Genre ASL ARIchange p change p
Press +4.39% 0.114 +6.43% 0.046
Prose +1.64% 0.490 +9.07% 0.002

Learned −5.05% 0.060 +3.07% 0.254
Fiction −4.85% 0.184 −1.97% 0.726

Table 1: British English: ASL and ARI.

Automated Readability Index shows a statisti-
cally significant increase over the observed period
1961–1991 in the Press and Prose text categories
(Table 1) which can be interpreted as a tendency
to render texts in these categories in a difficult-to-
read manner.

The results of the first experiment (Table 1) in-
dicate that ASL did not change significantly in the
period 1961–1991 in any of the four investigated
text categories of British English.

Genre LD LRchange p change p
Press +7.43% 0.000 +7.17% 0.000
Prose +3.90% 0.000 +4.40% 0.000

Learned +2.35% 0.248 +1.76% 0.416
Fiction +3.92% 0.008 +4.28% 0.012

Table 2: British English: LD and LR.

On the basis of the data analysed (Table 2), we
can draw the conclusion that the vocabulary was
enriched in three text categories of British English
– Press, Prose and Fiction, over the observed pe-
riod 1961–1991. The strongest intensity of these
changes can be noticed in the Press category.

6.2 Diachronic changes in American English

Results of the second experiment – diachronic
stylistic changes in American English over the pe-
riod 1961–1992 are presented in Table 3 and Table
4.

Genre ASL ARIchange p change p
Press −4.90% 0.034 −1.43% 0.598
Prose −3.35% 0.164 +3.32% 0.242

Learned −10.49% 0.000 −3.29% 0.278
Fiction −7.37% 0.058 −9.92% 0.082

Table 3: American English: ASL and ARI.

The Press and Learned text categories man-
ifested a decrease of ASL in the observed pe-
riod 1961–1992 (Table 3). This could be inter-
preted as an example of colloquialisation – “a ten-
dency for the written language gradually to ac-
quire norms and characteristics associated with the
spoken conversational language” (Leech, 2004),
as it is known that shorter sentences are a char-
acteristic of the spoken language.

The results in Table 3 indicate that ARI did
not change significantly in the period 1961–1991
in any of the four investigated text categories of
American English.

82



Lexical density and lexical richness demon-
strated a statistically significant increase only in
the Prose text category (Table 4).

Genre LD LRchange p change p
Press +2.03% 0.084 +0.71% 0.588
Prose +4.06% 0.000 +3.85% 0.004

Learned +3.89% 0.082 +3.90% 0.092
Fiction −2.51% 0.106 −3.04% 0.088

Table 4: American English: LD and LR.

These results lead to the conclusion that the vo-
cabulary used in the Prose category of American
English was enriched over the observed period
1961–1992.

6.3 British vs. American diachronic changes

From the results presented in the above four tables
we are able to make a comparison of the trends of
diachronic changes between British and American
English for the four investigated stylistic features
and provide some general observations.

The central conclusion is that British and Amer-
ican English do not follow the same trends of
stylistic diachronic changes in all genres and for
all features. The most striking differences are in
the cases of ASL and ARI. They demonstrated
statistically significant changes in only one of the
two investigated varieties of the English language.
ASL had a statistically significant decrease in the
Press and Learned categories of American English
over the period 1961–1991 (Table 3), while at the
same time did not manifest any statistically signif-
icant changes in any of the four text categories of
British English (Table 1). ARI demonstrated a sta-
tistically significant increase in the Press and Prose
categories of British English (Table 1) and no sta-
tistically significant changes in any of the four text
categories of American English (Table 3).

LD and LR manifested a statistically significant
increase in three text categories of British English
– Press, Prose and Fiction (Table 2). In Ameri-
can English, this trend was followed only in the
Press category, while the other two text categories
– Prose and Fiction, did not exhibit any statisti-
cally significant changes of LD or LR (Table 4).

In order to better understand noticed diachronic
changes and investigate possible influence be-
tween the two English language varieties, we con-
ducted an additional experiment of synchronic
comparison between British and American En-

glish in both starting and ending years – 1961
and 1991/2, for each genre and each feature sep-
arately. These results were consistent with the re-
sults of the previous two experiments – diachronic
changes in British and diachronic changes in
American English, thus supporting the hypotheses
made in the previous two subsections.

Of most interest were the results obtained from
the Press category (Table 5), as they suggested
the presence of Americanisation – “the influence
of north American habits of expression and be-
haviour on the UK (and other nations)” (Leech,
2004) in the observed period 1961-1991/2. They
indicated that the influence between the British
and American English written styles was more
pronounced in the Press category than in the other
three – Prose, Learned and Fiction.

Feature 1961 1991/2Br. Am. Br. Am.
ASL 20.63 21.50 21.53* 20.45
ARI 11.34 12.08* 12.07 11.91
LD 36.37 37.65* 39.08 38.41
LR 32.61 33.83* 34.95 34.07

Table 5: Synchronic comparison: Press category.

In Table 5, the value of the LD and LR calcu-
lated using equations 3 and 4 (Section 5) is mul-
tiplied by 100. Statistical significance of the dif-
ferences between the feature values in British and
American English is measured by the two-tailed
t-test. The results significant at the 0.05 level are
shown in bold. In those cases, the higher of the
two values (Br. or Am.) is marked with an ‘*’.

Statistically significant increases of the ARI,
LD and LR in the Press category of British En-
glish during the period 1961–1991 (Table 1 and
Table 2) together with the significantly higher val-
ues of these features in the same text category of
American English in 1961 (Table 5) could be ex-
plained using the aforementioned Americanisation
hypothesis.

7 Conclusions

On the basis of the data analysed in the previous
section, we can draw the following conclusions
about the trends of stylistic changes in the British
and American varieties of English language over
the period 1961–1991/2:

1) The Prose text category followed the same
trend of enriching the vocabulary in both varieties
of the English language.

83



2) Average sentence length had a statistically
significant decrease in the Press and Learned text
categories in American English and no statistically
significant changes in any of the four text cate-
gories in British English.

3) Automated Readability Index had a statisti-
cally significant increase in the Press and Prose
text categories in British English and no statisti-
cally significant changes in any of the four text
categories in American English.

Additionally, the presented study allowed us to
make several more general conclusions:

1) NLP tools can be successfully used in the
studies of language change and make use of the
raw text corpora customising it for the specific
purposes thus saving a great amount of human ef-
fort for annotation or manual corrections.

2) Stylistic changes are present and are notice-
able even after the 30 year time gap in various cat-
egories of the written language.

3) Different genres show different trends of
stylistic changes over the same period of time.
Therefore, it is of great importance to investigate
them separately in order to obtain a better picture
of the process of language change and the possible
influences between different genres.

4) As different language varieties show differ-
ent trends of stylistic changes inside the same text
categories, no general conclusions about the trends
of stylistic changes should be made before a de-
tailed investigation in each of the language vari-
eties. Furthermore, results of the separate investi-
gations of stylistic changes among different lan-
guage varieties enable a better understanding of
the noticed trends and their possible mutual influ-
ence. However, it is important to ensure that the
corpora of different language varieties are mutu-
ally comparable and thus any similarities or dif-
ferences among their trends of change are not due
to different sampling methods and text selection.

Finally, we demonstrated the possibility of us-
ing the Brown ‘family’ corpora and NLP tech-
niques for the investigation of diachronic stylis-
tic changes. It has created a path for many other
stylistic features to be investigated using the same
corpora and utilising the full potential of the cur-
rent state-of-the-art NLP tools and techniques.
