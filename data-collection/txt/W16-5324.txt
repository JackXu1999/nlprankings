Abstract

Although quantifiers/classifiers expressions occur frequently in everyday communications or

written documents, there is no description for them in classical bilingual paper dictionaries, nor

in machine-readable dictionaries. The paper describes a corpus and dictionary development for

quantifiers/classifiers, and their usage in the framework of French-Japanese machine translation

(MT). They often cause problems of lexical ambiguity and of set phrase recognition during analy-

sis, in particular for a long-distance language pair like French and Japanese. For the development

of a dictionary aiming at ambiguity resolution for expressions including quantifiers and classifiers

which may be ambiguous with common nouns, we have annotated our corpus with UWs (interlin-

gual lexemes) of UNL (Universal Networking Language) found on the UNL-jp dictionary. The

extraction of potential classifiers/quantifiers from corpus is made by UNLexplorer web service.

Keywords : classifiers, quantifiers, phraseology study, corpus annotation, UNL (Universal Net-

working Language), UWs dictionary, Tori Bank, French-Japanese machine translation (MT).

1 Introduction

Recent Machine Translation (MT) evaluation tends to be conducted based on (1) Automatic evaluation

metrics use reference translations for each segment such as BLEU, NIST, METEOR (Papineni et al.,

2001; Banerjee and Lavie, 2005; Doddington, 2002).

This shows frequent efforts for MT, by measuring a similarity or a distance between a translation

hypothesis and its post-editions. Basic operations used for post-editions are substitution, deletion, and

insertion of words or phrases in a sentence, whatever the MT system is. (2) Subjective measures are

based on human judgements of ”intelligibility”, ”fidelity”, “adequacy” and “fluency” of MT outputs.

These methods are really suitable for evaluating the progress of MT systems, but they do not contribute

directly to improve the quality ofMT outputs. Here we focus on lexical ambiguities, which are considered

as a main cause of the degradation of the quality in MT for spoken or written sentences. Several types of

ambiguity appear on each phase of MT for different types of documents.

We have categorized ambiguity problems according to the levels of MT analysis and to the MT con-

texts in which they are encountered, and we have proposed a formal ambiguity representation as well as

guidelines for ambiguity labelling to build an ambiguity data base1.

In fact, according to our studies of ambiguities, 14% of analysis errors2 are due to polysemous words.

Also, (G.Wisniewski and al., 2013) say the most frequent necessary post-edition in their French corpus

translation into English is to correct articles like «les», «le», «du», etc., and the next one concerns lexical

transfer errors of polysemous words. In addition, when polysemous words are used in their abstract or

figurative meaning where they could be classifier or quantifier, translation results produced by current

1We have done research on ambiguity analysis from the lexical, semantic and contextual points of view since 1996. Ambi-

guities have been defined, categorized, and formalized as objects in an ambiguity database, and we have used this theoretical

background to label ambiguities in Japanese-English interpreted dialogues, collected for the development of a speech translation

system at ATR in Japan (1994 ). (Boitet and Tomokiyo, 1995; Boitet and Tomokiyo, 1996; ?)
2The ambiguity analysis includes assignment of speech acts, although generally speaking speech act ambiguity isn’t taken

account of, so the percentage is important.

MT systems are not at all good. Even measure words like cm, km, kg, etc. may be ambiguous with

acronym (Anil K. et al., 2013).

Example: cm→ centimètre, congrégation de la mission, coût marginal, etc.
The following example shows that «pincée (pinch, つまみ, tsumami) » in a quantifier phrase appears in
form of «une pincée de», and is used in its figurative meaning. When one looks at the translation outputs

produced by commercial MT systems, it’s not hard to deduce there is a lack of phraseology studies and

polysemy disambiguationmethod for the word «pincée»3. For the treatment of the classifier/quantifier ex-

pressions, at first, we must knowwhether a word or an expression in a document is the classifier/quantifier

or not, and which kind of information is necessary to handle it in MT.

Example: Ajoutez une pincée de sel. (Add a pinch of salt.) →
塩のつねりを加えなさい/塩のピンチを加えなさい (Shio no tsuneri wo kuwaenasai/Shio no pinchi wo
kuwaenasai)4

Sections 1 & 2 discuss the problems encountered in the processing of classifiers and quantifiers arising

for meaning determination in the source language and from the structural differences between a language

pair in the framework of MT. Section 3 describes morpho-syntactic problems between two languages

for quantifier/classifier expressions. In Section 4, the difficulty of quantifiers/classifiers extraction is

described. In Section 5, we propose a solution using a dictionary, edited from collected documents,

themselves annotated with semantic UNL (hyper)graphs, presented as a parallel corpus, and give somme

details about a small French-Japanese dictionary for quantifiers/classifiers, built for MT experimentation

with an UNL system5.

2 Lexical ambiguity for classifiers/quantifiers

We call here words or phrases which are used in some languages to indicate the class of nouns or nomi-

nal/adjectival phrases, depending on the type of these referent, classifiers/quantifiers, when they appear

in quantitative expressions. They denote:

(a) temporal/spatial quantity of the referent and

(b) states of the referent in an idiomatic expression.

Type (a) classifiers/quantifiers express concrete measurement, and type (b) classifiers/quantifiers express

quantitative states of the referent based on speaker’s observation.

Examples:

Type (a): 2g de sel (2グラムの塩, 2-guramu-no shio, 2g of salt)
Type (b): une pièce de viande (一切れの肉, hitokire-no niku, a piece of meat) / un brin de causette
(ちょっとしたおしゃべり, chottoshita osyaberi, a little chat)
Classifiers/quantifiers of type (a) are obligatory in quantitative expressions, and they often cause

acronym ambiguities for MT as mentioned above, and also ambiguities due to the “floating quantifier”

(Inoue, 1989) phenomenon in Japanese.

For classifiers/quantifiers of type (b), there are three different sorts of problems. The first one is the fact

that classifiers/quantifiers have many to many meaning corespondences between source-target languages

pairs. In the following example, the French word «pièce» is translated into «切れ, kire», «枚, mai», «点,
ten», «頭, tou», etc. in Japanese, because, in many cases, Japanese classifiers depend upon the visual
forms of referents.

The second problem arises in the case where classifiers/quantifiers don’t appear explicitly in one lan-

guage of a language pair, nevertheless they are mandatorily expressed in the other, like «冊», satsu in
Japanese.

3“pincée” is used as quantifier/classifier for pulverized substances.

5TheUNL (Universal Networking Language) system denotes a language for computer, multilingual encoder-decoder system,

UNL-UWs dictionary, parallel corpus, and linguistic ontology system. It has been developed under the aegis the Organization

of United Nations University in form of international consortium for written languages processing since 1996. We are one of

the pioneer members of the consortium. Bilingual dictionaries with UNL-UWs dictionary are edited by each ”UNL language

center”. http://www.undl.org/unlsys/unl/unl2005/attribute.htm

or metonymic differences between two languages.

3 Morpho-syntactic differences between French-Japanese classifiers/quantifiers

As for the behaviour of floating quantifiers in Japanese (Inoue K.1989), the problem we encounter in
building a Japanese-French MT lies in the fact that the Japanese quantifiers can be freely positioned
between phrasal units in a sentence except after predicative verbs. They are morphosyntactically clas-
sified into two types of quantifier expressions: (1) noun phrases in form of “Number+Quantifier+の(no,
of)+Noun («NQのN» type)”, and (2) noun phrases in form of Noun+Number+Quantifier («NQN» type).
The NQN type can syntactically be divided into «N» part and «QN» part and it’s possible to use «QN» like
an adverb before a predicative verb in a sentence.
Hence, three types of expressions are possible for the same meaning : (1) 二冊の本 (ni-satsu no
hon, two books ), (2) 本二冊 (hon ni-satsu, two books) and also (3) 本を二冊 (hon-wo ni-satsu, two
books)6. The floating quantifier can produce meaningless translation result in some cases. For instance,
“3kgの子豚がいました (3 kiloguramu no kobutaga imashita, There was a 3kg piglet.)” is acceptable as
Japanese sentence, but “子豚が3kgいました(kobuta ga 3kiloguramu imashita)”7 doesn’t literally make
sense, because, «子豚 (kobuta, piglet)» means only an alive pig and co-occurs with いました (there was),
but “3kg” cannot do [12]. So, to avoid the translation output “子豚が3kgいました”, we need to have
supplementary information for “子豚 ” and the verb “いる(iru, there is, or exist)” and implement method
to use it. For that reason, we use the UWs dictionaries of the UNL system, which allows us to describe
semantic constraints between words.

4 Recognition difficulty of quantifiers/classifiers

We extract type (a) quantifiers/classifiers from Tori Bank8(See Annex), while referring to existing weights
and measures dictionaries. For type (b) quantifiers/classifiers, it’s laborious to pin down phrasemes9 in
row data.
Eg. “pointe” from Sketch Engine (Table 3).
However, French and English phrasemes are, in many cases, composed of “Number+Noun+de

(Number+noun+of)+Noun without particle” like “une poignée de sable (a handful of sand)”, “une
pointe d’ironie (a touch of irony)”, “un pouce de terre (a handful of)”, so in order to collect data
of type (b), we take note of the morphologic characteristic (Petit, 2004), and utilize a multilingual
corpus management software, called Sketch Engine10. The software gives a list of tri-grams of
keywords in context. The used documents are journals, magazines, novels, existing expression
dictionaries, French, Japanese and English leaner’s manuals. The assignment of the QC for obtained
keywords is made by linguistic intuition, while watching output from MT experiences on UNL Explorer11.

6In the full sentence, I bought 2 books  (本を二冊 買いました, hon-wo nisatsu kaimashita)
7子豚が3kgいました, For the piglet, there was 3 kg*.
8Tori Bank is a phrase corpus which has been developed at Tottori Unversity in Japan in 2007. http://unicorn.ike.tottori-

u.ac.jp/toribank/about_toribank.html
9The term ”phraseme” means set phrase, idiomatic phrase, polylexical expression, etc.
10The Sketch Engine refers to a text corpus management and analysis software developed by Lexical Computing Limited

since 2003. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketch_Engine)
11UNL Explorer is a web-based application, which combines all the components of the UNL system to be accessible online.

5 Specification of classifiers/quantifiers corpus

The corpus includes sentences which are manually or semi-automatically collected from novels, cooking
articles, news papers, dictionaries, Tori Bank, etc. The description for ”pointe” is given below as a
typical example. The annotated keywords include, at the present time, about 1000 classifier/quantifier
expressions for Japanese, French and English in PhraseBook II12 (see Annex).
1. Identification number: XX
2. Keywords and class: pointe (n.)
3. English sentence: to season the sauce with a hint of garlic
4. French sentence: relever la sauce avec une pointe d’ail
5. Japanese sentence: ソースにニンニクをちょっときかせる
6. Source: Royal
7. UNL annotation (simplified):
{org:fr} Relever la sauce avec une pointe d’ail {/org}
{unl}
agt(season(agt>person, obj>dish, icl>action>thing).@entry.@imperative, you)

met(season(agt>person, obj>dish, icl>action>thing).@entry.@imperative, garlic(icl>cooking))
qua(garlic(icl>cooking), a hint of(icl>quantity))

{/unl}

{jp} ソースにニンニクをちょっときかせる {jp}

6 UNL-UWs dictionary for quantifiers/classifiers

The collected documents in Japanese, French, English are annotated by their UNL expressions13, which
are composed of interlingual lexemes called “universal words (UWs)14, semantic boolean features, ”
and semantic relation tags15. In general, a UW is made of an English word or locution, its ”headword”,
disambiguated by a list of restrictions. The set of UWs can be used as a lexical “pivot” between the

12The corpus is going to become larger by extracting classifiers/quantifiers expressions from Tori Bank
13UNL is a language for computer to represent the meaning of natural language expressions. The ”Universal Words” (UWs)

constitute its vocabulary. A UW is in effect aninterlingual lexeme. Each node of a ”UNL expression” (in effect, a semantic

hypergraph) bears a UW and a possibly empty set of semantic attributes (Uchida et al.,2006).
14The UNL-UWs dictionary contains, at the moment 1269421 word senses (mapped to as many UWs) for Japanese, 520305

word senses for French, and 1458686 word senses for English.
15The semantic relations are represented by a fixed set of 42 relation 3-letter symbols, like agt, aoj, gol, etc., and the attributes

are boolean, like .@def or .@soon-begin. There are about 200 attributes in the UNL specifications, and developers may introduce

new attributes. These predefined attributes include syntactic, semantic or pragmatic information. The annotation labels are in

fact, “icl”, “equ”, “quantity”, etc. in description example.

“lexical spaces” of any set of natural languages, and the UNL graphs can similarly be used as an
“anglo-semantic” abstract pivot language. The added information for classifier/quantifier expressions is
merged into the UNL dictionaries. Here is an extract of our 3-lingual UNL dictionary. The first entry
has 2 languages (jp, fr.). The second entry has 3 languages (jp, fr, en). The forth has again 2 languages
(fr, en).
樽 (taru, pièce): cask(icl>wine,equ>2200 litres)
冊 (satsu, volume): volume(icl>quantity)
relever (to season): season(agt>person, obj>dish, icl>action>thing)
pointe (touch): touch(icl>amount) → une pointe de (a touch of)

“icl“ and “equ” in our UW dictionary are semantic relation tags, and mean headword’s sub-meaning
and equivalent quantity, respectively. The semantic relation “agt” indicates that the volitional agent of
“relever” is “person”.

Perspectives and Conclusion

We are making French-Japanese MT experiments using the UNL system.
We have studied the methodology for phraseology treatment on MT systems while developing a French-
Japanese-English parallel corpus and have concluded that a deeper linguistic analysis (Petit, 2004, Mari,
2011) is necessary for UW dictionary description. Our corpus will be useful for software developers,
as well as for learners of languages, because it covers semantic information which cannot be yet found
in any bilingual dictionary. We also plan to develop a language software by processing the corpus,
where corresponding words between 2 languages are shown on demand by character blinking or where
the meaning of nouns or verbs in a sentence is shown without any ambiguity by interpreting the UNL
annotations. A prototype of the software has been already presented in a PhD thesis (Chenon, 2005).
