Abstract

Cloze-style reading comprehension in Chinese
is still limited due to the lack of various cor-
pora. In this paper we propose a large-scale
Chinese cloze test dataset ChID, which stud-
ies the comprehension of idiom, a unique lan-
guage phenomenon in Chinese. In this corpus,
the idioms in a passage are replaced by blank
symbols and the correct answer needs to be
chosen from well-designed candidate idioms.
We carefully study how the design of candi-
date idioms and the representation of idioms
affect the performance of state-of-the-art mod-
els. Results show that the machine accuracy is
substantially worse than that of human, indi-
cating a large space for further research.

1 Introduction

Machine reading comprehension aims to assess
the ability to comprehend natural language and
answer questions from a given document or pas-
sage. As a classical method of assessing language
proficiency (Fotos, 1991; Jonz, 1991; Tremblay,
2011), cloze test (Taylor, 1953) has been widely
employed due to its simplicity in form. Recently,
a number of datasets for cloze test have been
proposed for different languages. For instance,
CNN/Daily Mail (Hermann et al., 2015) provides
a benchmark for machine comprehension of En-
glish text, while the People Daily and Children’s
Fairy Tale dataset (Cui et al., 2016) and CMRC-
2017 (Cui et al., 2018) pioneer explorations in
Chinese language.

In this paper we explore idiom comprehension
(Wray, 2002; Jackendoff and Jackendoff, 2002;
Cacciari and Tabossi, 2014; Jiang et al., 2018)
in cloze test. Idiom , which is called “成语”
(chengyu) in Chinese, is an interesting linguistic
phenomena in Chinese language, and this work

is in parallel to several datasets (Hill et al., 2016;
Xie et al., 2018) that have considered different lan-
guage phenomena in English. Compared to other
types of words, many idioms are unique for their
non-compositionality and metaphorical meaning
(see an example in Table 1). This feature requires
a good representation of idiom. Meanwhile, the
characteristic of near-synonym, i.e., words that
have similar but not identical meanings (see an
example in Table 2), may challenge a machine to
choose an accurate idiom in a given context. Due
to the fact that idioms are widely used in daily
communication and in various literary genres, it
is a new challenge to assess the ability of under-
standing and representing idioms in Chinese read-
ing comprehension.

To this end, we propose ChID, a large-scale
Chinese IDiom dataset for cloze test. ChID con-

tains 581K passages and 729K blanks, and cov-
ers multiple domains. In ChID, the idioms in a
passage were replaced with blank symbols. For
each blank, a list of candidate idioms including
the golden idiom are provided as choice. As the
difficulty level of cloze test depends on candidate
choices, we investigate several strategies of select-
ing candidate idioms. We evaluate several state-
of-the-art models on the proposed corpus with dif-
ferent representations of idioms. Results show that
machine performs much worse than human, which
indicates a large room for further research.

Our contributions are summarized as follows:

• We propose a new dataset, ChID, for cloze-
style reading comprehension in Chinese lan-
guage. ChID contains 581K passages and
729K blanks from three domains (news, nov-
els, and essays).

• We conduct extensive experiments on the de-
sign of candidate idioms and the idiom rep-
resentation methods, and compare state-of-
the-art models. Results show that the perfor-
mance of these models is substantially worse
than that of human.

• ChID provides a benchmark to evaluate the
ability of understanding idioms, a unique yet
common language phenomenon in Chinese.
To our knowledge, this is the first work where
this linguistic phenomenon is studied in the
form of machine reading comprehension.

2 Related Work

Recently, machine reading comprehension has
been advanced by many corpora with various task
settings. For instance, CNN/Daily Mail (Hermann
et al., 2015) collects news articles and uses the
cloze test (Taylor, 1953) to assess the ability of
reading comprehension in English. RACE (Lai
et al., 2017) and CLOTH (Xie et al., 2018) are con-
structed from questions in examinations designed
for secondary and high school students. A num-
ber of question-answer datasets (Rajpurkar et al.,
2016; Reddy et al., 2018) are also proposed and
there are many other large-scale datasets (Nguyen
et al., 2016; He et al., 2018). These corpora in-
spire various neural models (Chen et al., 2016; Cui
et al., 2016; Seo et al., 2017; Dhingra et al., 2017;
Cui et al., 2017). In Table 3, we present a sur-
vey on existing cloze-style reading comprehension
datasets.

As the earliest cloze-style dataset for machine
reading comprehension, CNN/Daily Mail (Her-
mann et al., 2015) has a very large scale. It collects
news articles paired with a number of bullet points,
which summarise key aspects of an article. Based
on the fact that these summary points are abstrac-
tive and do not simply copy sentences from a news
article, the corpus is constructed by transforming
these bullet points into cloze-style questions, i.e.,
replacing one entity with a placeholder. Children’s
Book Test (CBT) (Hill et al., 2016) also provides
a benchmark for machine reading comprehension,



780

while the key differences from CNN/Daily Mail
include: a list of candidate choices is provided for
each query, and more types of words are removed,
including named entities, (common) nouns, verbs
and prepositions. Who-did-What (Onishi et al.,
2016) collects its corpus from news and provides
options for questions similar to CBT. Each ques-
tion is formed from two independent articles: an
article is treated as context to be read and a sep-
arate article on the same event is used to form
the query. LAMBADA (Paperno et al., 2016) re-
moved the last word from a given passage and
evaluates the ability of word prediction. By con-
trast, the Story Cloze Test dataset (Mostafazadeh
et al., 2017) evaluates the ability of story under-
standing and script learning, where the task re-
quires to select or generate a reasonable sentence
to complete the story context.

To the best of our knowledge, People Daily
(PD) and Children’s Fairy Tale (CFT) (Cui et al.,
2016) and CMRC-2017 (Cui et al., 2018) are the
only two existing cloze-style datasets for Chinese
reading comprehension. Similar to CNN/Daily
Mail and CBT, PD & CFT and CMRC-2017 re-
placed a word (usually a noun or named entity) in
the document with a blank placeholder and treated
the sentence containing this word as a query. PD
collects data from news while CFT and CMRC-
2017 are from children’s reading materials.

In most datasets, the answer can be directly
found from context. CLOTH (Xie et al., 2018)
has a similar setting to ChID, where the answer
should be selected from given choices. However,
CLOTH is collected from English examinations
for secondary/high school students, whose size is
limited because documents, blanks, and options
are all manually created.

3 Chinese Idioms

Idiom is a common language phenomenon and
usually called “成语” (chengyu) in Chinese.
Thanks to its conciseness in form and expressive-
ness in meaning, idiom is widely used in daily
communication and in various text genres. The
main challenges for machine reading comprehen-
sion with idiom lie in: idiom representation which
represents the meaning of an idiom, and thorough
discrimination among the near-synonyms of an id-
iom.

3.1 Idiom Representation
Many idioms are non-compositional and have
metaphorical meanings (see an example in Ta-
ble 1), which has also made idiom translation a
challenging problem and attracted considerable re-
search attentions (Anastasiou, 2010; Salton et al.,
2014; Cap et al., 2015; Shao et al., 2017). The
meaning of such idioms is generally different from
the literal meanings of the constituent characters.
Such idioms are usually originated from ancient
cultural stories, but the meaning is reserved along
the long history of language use. For instance, “塞
翁失马” has a metaphorical meaning, which is de-
rived from this story:

Near China’s northern borders lived an
old man who bred many horses. One
day, one of his horses, for no reason
at all, escaped into the territory of the
northern tribes. Everyone commiserated
with him. “Perhaps this will soon turn
out to be a blessing,” said the old man.
After a few months, his horse came
back, and brought back a fine horse from
the north.

So the idiom “塞翁失马” usually refers to a bless-
ing in disguise. Thus comprehending and repre-
senting an idiom may require the access to the
corresponding cultural history. In addition, due
to the polysemy of a single character, even those
compositional idioms are likely to have ambiguity,
which also makes idiom representation a challeng-
ing problem.

3.2 Near-synonyms
It is common that an idiom has near-synonyms.
These idioms may be confused in language use
due to their similar but not identical meanings1

(see an example in Table 2). To discriminate those
near-synonyms, machine is required to figure out
their subtle differences in usage, which is also
challenging.

To verify the near-synonym phenomena, we
conducted a user study. Based on the idiom vo-
cabulary we collected (see Section 4.1), we man-
ually evaluated the number of near-synonyms per
idiom. We randomly sampled 200 idioms. For
each idiom, we picked up the 20 most similar id-
ioms whose embedding similarity score to the in-
put idiom is less than some threshold. According

1Idioms with identical meanings can be interchangeably
used in any context.

Figure 1: An example in ChID. Each data contains a given passage with several blanks that replace the original
idioms (in this example, there is only one blank). For each blank, several options are provided. Among the list of
candidate choices, there is one golden answer, three similar idioms and another three random ones.

Table 4: Annotation result of near-synonyms. It shows
the number of idioms in the 200 sampled idioms that
have at least K near-synonyms, for K = 1, 2, 3, 4.
Fleiss’ kappa is 0.479, indicating moderate agreement.

to the similarity annotation result of Section 4.3
and Table 6, we set this threshold to 0.85. Then
we hired four annotators to label these 4,000 idiom
pairs in terms of whether a pair is near-synonyms
or not. All the annotators have good command of
Chinese.

The evaluation result is shown in Table 4. Note
that for each idiom, we rounded down the mean
of the numbers of near-synonyms labeled by the
four annotators. We estimate that about 90% id-
ioms have at least 1 near-synonym. About 23% of
the idioms have 4 or more near-synonyms. Fleiss’
kappa (Fleiss, 1971) for measuring inter-annotator
agreement is 0.479, indicating moderate agree-
ment (within [0.4, 0.6]). This evaluation result
strongly supports our claim that near-synonyms
are very common among Chinese idioms.

symbols, and each blank is provided with several
candidate idioms including the golden idiom. The
task is to select the golden answer from the candi-
date choices given the context. Note that the an-
swer is usually not occurring in the context in our
setting, which is different from most existing cloze
test corpora.

In the following subsections, we will explain the
three steps in data collection: (1) Constructing the
idiom vocabulary; (2) Extracting passages within
a proper length; (3) Designing candidate choices.

4.1 Vocabulary Construction
We collected the idiom vocabulary from Chinese
idioms Daquan 2, which contains over 23K id-
iom entries. Since vast majority of idioms con-
sist of 4 characters, we only retained idioms with
4 characters in our vocabulary. In order to facili-
tate the design of candidate choices, we removed

782

those idioms that do not have a pre-trained embed-
ding using the large-scale open-source corpus pro-
vided by Song et al. (2018), where approximately
40% idioms were filtered out. We normalized syn-
onyms with only slight morphological variation.
Idioms that share the same explanation and mean-
ing, but only differ in one character or the order
of characters, are treated as the same idiom. This
can be done with the Chinese idiom dictionary be-
cause some idioms are marked with: “又作” (also
written as), “犹” (like), “同” (the same as), “见”
(also see). Such idioms in the passages are all re-
placed by their re-normalized ones.

We then counted the frequency of each idiom
in the corpus, and removed those idioms that ap-
pear less than 20 times. Finally, the idiom vocabu-
lary has 3,848 entries in total, and their frequency
statistics on the whole corpus is shown in Table 5.
The minimum and the maximum idiom frequen-
cies are 20 and 534 respectively. We simply divide
the idiom frequency into five intervals: very low
(from 20 to 50), low (from 50 to 100), medium
(from 100 to 200), high (from 200 to 400) and
very high (higher than 400). The proportions of
idioms in the frequency intervals are almost uni-
formly distributed.

4.2 Passage Extraction

To make the topic and domain more diversified,
we collected passages from novel and essay on
the Internet, and the news articles provided by Sun
et al. (2016)3. Since some documents may be very
long, we took a paragraph as the basic unit. Each
idiom except those in double quotation marks4 is
replaced with a blank symbol. A paragraph that
is shorter than 100 characters is merged with the
next paragraph to ensure that the context are suffi-
cient for answer selection. Those passages that are
longer than 600 characters are abandoned.

It is worth noting that if some idiom has a much
higher word frequency than others, models may
tend to bias answer selection to those more fre-
quent idioms. In order to make frequent and in-
frequent idioms more balanced, we removed some
passages which only contain high frequency id-
ioms.

3The news articles are extracted from the THUCNews
dataset for Chinese text classification, which can be down-
loaded from http://thuctc.thunlp.org/.

4Because words in a quotation mark are usually entities
or other content that can not be inferred from the context.

Table 6: Annotation result of embedding similarity.
The three labels are: SYN (synonym), NEAR (near-
synonym), OTHER. κ is the Fleiss’ kappa value.

4.3 Candidate Choice Selection

The semantic relevance between two idioms can
be measured by the cosine similarity of their em-
beddings (Mikolov et al., 2013), which helps us
to design candidate choices. However, idioms that
are similar in embedding may or may not be syn-
onyms or near-synonyms. We thus manually eval-
uated the correlation between embedding similar-
ity and idiom synonymity. We split the embedding
similarity from 0.9 to 0.5 into 8 intervals. Within
each interval, 200 pairs of idioms are sampled. We
used three labels to measure the relevance between
two idioms: SYN (synonym, the two idioms are
identical in meaning and can be interchangeably
used), NEAR (near-synonym, have close or simi-
lar meanings but can not be used interchangeably),
OTHER (irrelevant or opposite in meaning). We
hired five annotators to label these samples.

As shown in Table 6, when the similarity score
is larger than 0.75, there is a large proportion of
idioms pairs that have the same meaning; when
the score is between 0.65 and 0.80, there is a
large probability that the two idioms are near-
synonyms. For those pairs with high (larger than
0.85) or low (smaller than 0.60) similarity, an-
notators tend to reach substantial agreement5 ac-
cording to Fleiss’ kappa, while we have moderate
agreement between the similarity interval [0.65,
0.85].

The above annotation results inspire us to de-
sign proper candidate choices for each blank in
a passage. First of all, we excluded those id-
ioms that have a similarity score higher than 0.7
to the golden answer. This avoids to include
synonyms of the golden answer in the candidate

5Substantial agreement corresponds to kappa within [0.6,
0.8].

choice. Then, we picked up top 10 similar idioms
among the remaining idioms, and randomly chose
three idioms as candidate choice. Note that the
three idioms have a large probability of being near-
synonyms of the golden answer, which affects the
difficulty level of the cloze test to some degree.
We further randomly sampled another three id-
ioms from the remaining idioms that do not in-
clude the top 10 similar idioms. In this manner,
the list of candidate choices consists of three parts:
the correct answer, three similar idioms, and three
other randomly sampled ones, as shown in Figure
1.

4.4 Corpus Statistics

The detailed statistics of ChID is shown in Ta-
ble 7. News and novels are treated as in-domain
data, which are divided into the training set Train,
the development set Dev, and the test set Test.
Essays are reserved for out-of-domain test Out
to assess the generalization ability of cloze test
models. The in-domain data cover 3,848 Chinese
idioms, while Dev/Test/Out respectively cover

3,458/3,502/3,626 idioms.
There are some differences between in-domain

and out-of-domain data. Firstly, the average length
of passages in the in-domain data is nearly 100
words, while Out-of-domain data have longer pas-
sages (127 words). The average number of blanks
per passage is also different (1.25 vs. 1.49). Sec-
ondly, the idiom distributions are different. As
shown in Table 8, compared to the in-domain data,
low-frequency idioms occupy a higher proportion
of all the idiom occurrences in the out-of-domain
data (8.2% vs. 3.5% for very low frequency in-
terval and 12.0% vs. 7.2% for low frequency in-
terval) while the high-frequency idioms occur less
frequently (31.4% vs. 44.5%). These differences
make the out-of-domain test set more challenging.

5 Experiment

5.1 Models
In order to evaluate how well the state-of-the-art
models can comprehend Chinese language with
idiom, we tested the following models:
Language Model (LM): We trained a bidirec-
tional LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997)
to obtain the hidden state at the blank (hb), and use
the hidden state to score candidate choices:
−→
h b =

−−−−→
LSTM(w1:b),

←−
h b =

←−−−−
LSTM(wb:|p|) (1)

hb =
−→
h b ⊕

←−
h b (2)

αi = softmaxi
(
hTb ci

)
(3)

where |p| denotes the length of passage p,
w1:b, wb:|p| denote the words in the given context
before or after the blank respectively, ⊕ denotes
concatenation, and ci denotes the embedding of



784

each candidate idiom. Then, the option that has
the highest αi is chosen as the answer.
Attentive Reader (AR) (Hermann et al., 2015):
The bidirectional LSTM model is augmented with
the attention mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2015).
The hidden state at blank hb is used as the query
to attentively read the context as follows:

mt = tanh(Whmht +Wbmhb) (4)

st = softmaxt
(
wTmsmt

)
, r =

|p|∑
t=1

stht (5)

whereWhm,Wbm,wms are all parameters. Then,
the attention vector r and the blank vector hb are
used to score each candidate choice:

g = tanh(Wrgr +Wbghb) (6)

αi = softmaxi
(
gTci

)
(7)

whereWrg,Wbg are also parameters.
Stanford Attentive Reader (SAR) (Chen et al.,
2016): Compared to AR, SAR applies a bilinear
matrixWs to compute attention weights instead of
using a tanh layer. The weighted contextual vector
o is used for scoring candidates:

st = softmaxt
(
hTbWsht

)
, o =

|p|∑
t=1

stht (8)

αi = softmaxi
(
oTci

)
(9)

5.2 Implementation Details
All the models were implemented with Tensorflow
(Abadi et al., 2016). We employed the Jieba Chi-
nese word segmenter6 to tokenize passages. We
set the vocabulary size to 100K and used the 200-
dimensional word embeddings initialized by Song
et al. (2018). Those word embeddings that were
not matched in Song et al. (2018) were initialized
from a uniform distribution between (-0.1, 0.1).
We applied a dropout rate of 0.5 on word embed-
dings. The number of hidden units of RNN cells
were all set to 100. The cross entropy cost func-
tion is used to compute the training loss. ADAM
(Kingma and Ba, 2015) was used to optimize all
the models with the initial learning rate to 0.001
and the gradient was clipped when the norm of the
gradient was larger than 5. We set the batch size
to 32. The training was stopped when the accuracy
on Dev did not improve within an epoch.

cates Fleiss’ kappa. The overall best results are shown
in bold, and AR performs significantly better than LM
and SAR (sign test, p-value < 0.05).

5.3 Option Settings

To evaluate how the method of candidate choice
design will impact the performance, we prepared
two additional test sets: Ran and Sim, both of
which have the same passages with Test, but can-
didate choices are designed differently. In Ran, all
the candidate choices are sampled from the idioms
that are not similar to the golden answer. Instead,
in Sim, all the candidates are sampled from top 10
similar idioms. Therefore, Sim is more challeng-
ing than Ran as the former has more distracting
options. Note that each blank has seven choices
including the golden answer.

5.4 Results

To explore the ceiling of model performance, we
also conducted Human Evaluation. We sam-
pled 200 passages respectively from the aforemen-
tioned test sets: Test, Ran, Sim and Out. We
then hired three annotators to complete the 800
cloze tests. These three annotators are first-year or
second-year university students and all have very
good command of Chinese language. The aver-
age accuracy of the annotators and the correspond-
ing Fleiss’ kappa are reported as the final perfor-
mance.

The experiment results are shown in Table 9.
We analyzed the results from the following per-
spectives:

Option Setting: The setting of similar op-
tions is much harder than that of random options.
Firstly, we noted that both human and models
achieve worse performance on Test than on Ran,
while the accuracy on Sim is even lower than
Test, which indicates that including more simi-
lar candidate idioms makes the task more difficult.
Secondly, the inter-annotator agreement on Ran
(Fleiss’ kappa=0.953) is much higher than those

on other test sets which include similar options.
This implies that similar options also make man-
ual annotation harder.

Human vs. Models: Firstly, human perfor-
mance is substantially better than model perfor-
mance on all the test sets. The smallest gap be-
tween human and machine is 14.6 (on Test) and
the largest gap is 23.3 (on Out). Secondly, hu-
mans perform very closely on Test and Out (87.1
vs. 86.2), however, the models perform much bet-
ter on Test than on Out (72.4 vs. 62.9). This ob-
servation implies that human has a strong ability to
generalize to out-of-domain data while the mod-
els cannot generalize well to Out which contains
more low-frequency idioms.

Model Comparison: AR outperforms all other
models significantly. The reason for this may be
due to the fact: AR firstly uses the blank represen-
tation (hb) to make an attentive read of the context
(see Eq. 4 and 5), and the blank vector is used
again with the attentive vector (r) to score a can-
didate choice. In this manner, the context is atten-
tively used and the blank vector is used twice.

5.5 Comparison on Idiom Representation

In previous experiments, an idiom was treated as a
token, and its representation are obtained through
pretraining on a large corpus (Song et al., 2018).
In this section, we explored another two methods
for idiom representation, and evaluated the perfor-
mance with different idiom representations. One

method simply uses the average embedding of 4
constituent characters as the representation of an
idiom. This method mimics to understand idioms
purely based on its literal meanings. The other is
to apply an MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron, Bishop
et al., 1995; Fine, 1999) which is fed with the con-
catenation of 4 character embeddings, and the out-
put vector is used to represent an idiom. This
method also applies a composition assumption:
the representation of an idiom is a composite func-
tion of its constituent words. Note that the input to
the MLP is an 800-dimension vector, and the MLP
has a hidden layer of 400 units and uses tanh as the
activation function. The final output of MLP is a
200-dimension vector.

Table 10 shows the performance comparison us-
ing three methods for idiom representation. We
can observe remarkable drops from idiom embed-
ding to average character embedding + MLP and
to average character embedding for all the mod-
els, where all the differences are significant (sign
test, p-value < 0.01). The results indicate that the
other two idiom representation methods are worse
than treating an idiom as an independent seman-
tic unit. This study also implies that idiom rep-
resentation is a key factor for the success of Chi-
nese reading comprehension with idiom. In other
words, a good cloze test model should have not
only a proper model structure, but also a good
method to represent idioms.

6 Conclusion

In this paper, we propose a large-scale Chinese
cloze dataset (ChID) which contains 581K pas-
sages and 729K queries from news, novels, and
essays, covering 3,848 Chinese idioms. The cor-
pus provides a benchmark to evaluate the abil-
ity of Chinese cloze test with idiom. Firstly, we
analyze how the embedding similarity correlates
with synonymity and near-synonymity of Chinese
idiom, and find that the difficulty level of Chi-
nese cloze test with idiom correlates positively
with the method of choosing candidate choices.
Secondly, we find that idiom representation is
a key factor to the success of reading compre-
hension models in this task due to the common
non-compositionality and metaphorical meaning
of Chinese idiom. Thirdly, we evaluate three state-
of-the-art cloze test models on this corpus, and
observe that existing model performance is still
much worse than human performance. All these

findings indicate that the corpus may be a proper
benchmark for Chinese cloze test and worth fur-
ther research7.
