Abstract

We introduce JOCO, a novel text cor-
pus for NLP analytics in the field of eco-
nomics, business and management. This
corpus is composed of corporate annual
and social responsibility reports of the top
30 US, UK and German companies in the
major (DJIA, FTSE 100, DAX), middle-
sized (S&P 500, FTSE 250, MDAX) and
technology (NASDAQ, FTSE AIM 100,
TECDAX) stock indices, respectively. Al-
together, this adds up to 5,000 reports from
270 companies headquartered in three of
the world’s most important economies.
The corpus spans a time frame from 2000
up to 2015 and contains, in total, 282M to-
kens. We also feature JOCO in a small-
scale experiment to demonstrate its poten-
tial for NLP-fueled studies in economics,
business and management research.

1 Introduction

A crucial prerequisite in today’s NLP research
is the availability of large amounts of language
data. National reference corpora such as the ANC
for American English (Ide and Suderman, 2004),
the BNC for British English (Burnard, 2000), and
the DEREKO for German (Kupietz and Lüngen,
2014) assemble a collection of language data with
a focus on ordinary language use covering a wide
range of genres (e.g., newspaper articles, techni-
cal writing and popular fiction, letters, transcripts
of court or parliament speeches, etc.). Corpora
exclusively focusing on newspaper articles have
been particularly influential for the development
of syntactic and semantic methodologies in NLP

* These authors contributed equally to this work.

research (e.g., PENN TREEBANK (Marcus et al.,
1993) or PENN PROPBANK (Palmer et al., 2005)
for the English language).

Turning to more specialized, mostly scientific,
domains these general language resources can
only be reused at the cost of substantial perfor-
mance penalties due to characteristic sublanguage
phenomena in those domains. For the biomedical
domain, e.g., these negative effects can be shown
for the whole range of low-level (sentence split-
ting, tokenization (Tomanek et al., 2007; Griffis
et al., 2016)) up to high-level tasks (such as syn-
tactic analysis (Laippala et al., 2014; Jiang et al.,
2015)). As a consequence, these specialized fields
of NLP research have created their own resource
infrastructure in terms of domain-specific lexicons
and corpora for syntactic and semantic processing.

The rapidly increasing number of publications
using text analytics for economics, business, and
management (for surveys, cf. Lu et al. (2010);
Goldenstein et al. (2015); Kumar and Ravi (2016))
indicates the emergence of an entirely new appli-
cation domain for NLP systems (see Section 2). At
first sight, one might argue that domain-specific
corpora such as the PENN TREEBANK are suffi-
cient since they already contain economy-related
language data. Yet, as these resources assem-
ble only excerpts from newspaper articles, at sec-
ond sight, such resources turn out to be biased.
Newspaper articles reflect journalists’ interpreta-
tions and do not necessarily directly transport the
attitudes and views of economic actors, such as
an individual (consumer) or business corporations
(Simon, 1991).

This shortcoming can be alleviated if one tar-
gets the economic actors’ verbal communication
behavior directly on various media channels. Our
choice is to focus on annual reports (AR) and cor-
porate social responsibility reports (CSRR) of ma-
jor business corporations in Western economies.

Altogether these documents comprise 282M to-
kens and reflect the unfiltered views of these com-
mercial enterprises and their embedding in the so-
cial and regulatory system in market-driven soci-
eties. Viewing enterprises as social actors with
their own goals, their legal, social and other re-
sponsibilities becomes increasingly relevant for
both the explanation and prediction of economic
and organizational phenomena, as well as for eco-
nomics, management and organization science, in
general (King et al., 2010; Bromley and Sharkey,
2017). While the raw data set we assembled can
be used for scientific purposes only, we also offer
an embedding model trained on it which is avail-
able without any legal restrictions.1

2 Related Work

The ties between NLP, economics, management,
and organization science have evolved around dif-
ferent types of economic actors and roles they play
in an economic setting. One stream of work deals
with NLP-based customer analytics by profiling
customers, tracking their product/company prefer-
ences, screening customer reviews, etc. (Archak
et al., 2011; Ikeda et al., 2013; Zhang and Pen-
nacchiotti, 2013; Stavrianou and Brun, 2015; Yang
et al., 2015; Sakaki et al., 2016; Pekar and Binner,
2017). Another stream is concerned with NLP-
based product analytics, e.g., based on (social)
media monitoring, summarizing reviews, or iden-
tifying (deceptive/fake) product descriptions or re-
views (Mukherjee et al., 2012; Feng et al., 2012;
Wang and Ester, 2014; Tsunoda et al., 2015; Fang
and Zhan, 2015; Kessler et al., 2015; Imada et al.,
2016; Chen et al., 2016; Pryzant et al., 2017).

Yet, the main thrust of work is devoted to NLP-
based financial (stock) market analytics, e.g., an-
alyzing companies’ market performance indica-
tors (trend prediction, performance forecasting,
volatility prediction, etc.) and verbal statements
related to market performance, competitors or fu-
ture perspectives (Schumaker and Chen, 2009;
Kogan et al., 2009; Nassirtoussi et al., 2014; Li
et al., 2014; Qiu and Srinivasan, 2014; Kazemian
et al., 2014; de Fortuny et al., 2014; Ammann
et al., 2014; Wang and Hua, 2014; Nguyen and
Shirai, 2015; Luss and d’Aspremont, 2015; Ding
et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2015; Feuerriegel and
Prendinger, 2016; Rekabsaz et al., 2017; Xing
et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018).

1www.orga.uni-jena.de/orga/en/Corpus.html

This external market view is complemented by
NLP-based organization/enterprise analytics, e.g.,
social role taking, risk prediction, fraud analysis,
market share analytics, etc. (Goel et al., 2010;
Hájek and Olej, 2015; Buechel et al., 2016; Goel
and Uzuner, 2016; El-Haj et al., 2016; Tsai and
Wang, 2017), including competitive or business in-
telligence services based on NLP tooling (Chaud-
huri et al., 2011; Chung, 2014).

From a methodological perspective, the social
interactions between these actors—customers, en-
terprises, and political/juridical authorities—have
been studied in terms of sentiments they bring to
bear (Van De Kauter et al., 2015). Evidence is
collected from consumers’ and enterprises’ ver-
bal behavior and their communication about prod-
ucts and services, e.g., via social media (Chen
et al., 2014; Si et al., 2014; Liu, 2015; Alshahrani
et al., 2018). This research is complemented by
studies related to reputation, expertise, credibility
and trust models for agents in the economic pro-
cess (as traders, sellers, advertisers) based on min-
ing communication traces and recommendation
legacy data, including fake ad/review recognition
(Bar-Haim et al., 2011; Brown, 2012; Mukherjee
et al., 2012; Rechenthin et al., 2013; Tang and
Chen, 2014; Žnidaršič et al., 2018).

System-wise, specialized types of search en-
gines have been developed, for instance, enter-
prise search engines (e-commerce, e-marketing)
or consumer search engines, market monitors,
product/service recommender systems (Vandic
et al., 2017; Trotman et al., 2017). This also
includes customer-supplier interaction platforms
(e.g., portals, helps desks, newsgroups) and trans-
action support systems based on natural lan-
guage communication (including business chat
bots) (Cui et al., 2017; Altinok, 2018). Special-
ized modes of information extraction and text min-
ing in economic domains, e.g., temporal event or
transaction mining have also been explored (Tao
et al., 2015; Lefever and Hoste, 2016; Ding et al.,
2016), as well as information aggregation from
single sources (e.g., review summaries, automatic
threading) (Gerani et al., 2014).

The language resources behind these activi-
ties include specialized lexicons (Loughran and
McDonald, 2011) and ontologies for economics
(Leibniz Information Centre for Economics,
2014), the adaptation or acquisition of lexicons
for economic NLP (Xie et al., 2013; Moore et al.,

2016; Oliveira et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2018), cor-
pora and annotations policies (guidelines, meta-
data schemata, etc.) for economic NLP concerned
with domain-specific text genres (business reports,
auditing documents, product reviews, economic
newswire, social media posts or blogs, business
letters, legislation documents, etc.) (Flickinger
et al., 2012; Takala et al., 2014; Kessler and Kuhn,
2014; Asooja et al., 2015; Schön et al., 2018) , and
dedicated tools for economic NLP (e.g., NER tag-
gers, sublanguage parsers, pipelines for process-
ing economic discourse) (Schumaker and Chen,
2009; Feldman et al., 2011; Hogenboom et al.,
2013; Kessler and Kuhn, 2013; Lee et al., 2014;
Malo et al., 2014; Weichselbraun et al., 2015;
Lefever and Hoste, 2016; Ding et al., 2016; El-Haj
et al., 2018).

Pioneering efforts in considering texts origi-
nally produced by enterprises as a basis for eco-
nomic NLP were made by Kloptchenko et al.
(2004) who used sentiments in enterprises’ quar-
terly reports as a predictor for stock market prices.
Later Kogan et al. (2009) came up with the influ-
ential 10-K Corpus, a collection of 54,379 ARs
from 10,492 different, publically traded compa-
nies covering a time interval from 1996 up to
2006. This seminal resource is a cornerstone of
economic corpus development and our work is
meant to complement it with current and more di-
verse language data.

3 Corpus Description

The corpus we here introduce consists of ARs and
CSRRs from companies in the United States, the
United Kingdom and Germany. An AR is a com-
prehensive report published yearly by publicly-
listed corporations on their activities and financial
performance of the past year. ARs provide infor-
mation for current and prospective shareholders,
the governmental and regulatory bodies, the stock
exchanges, as well as all other stakeholders (Neu
et al., 1998; Yuthas et al., 2002). A CSRR is a reg-
ular report published by a company or an organiza-
tion about the economic, environmental and social
impacts caused by its activities (Dahlsrud, 2008;
Chen and Bouvain, 2009; Fifka, 2013). CSRRs
also present the organization’s values and gover-
nance model, and reveal the link between its strat-
egy and its commitment to the organization’s en-
vironment and a sustainable global economy (Du
et al., 2010; Aguinis and Glavas, 2012).

With regard to the popular 10-K corpus (Ko-
gan et al., 2009), the data set we present is sig-
nificantly smaller in size (both in terms of tokens
and companies). However, the 10-K corpus only
covers ARs, while we also include CSRRs allow-
ing a wider view on organizational communication
traces. Also, the 10-K corpus only includes reports
up to the year 2006, whereas our work incorpo-
rates documents as recent as 2015. Additionally,
the 10-K corpus is only based on the 10-k forms
mandated by the Securities Exchange Commission
(SEC) in the US. Nonetheless, US corporations’
ARs contain the same information as required by
the 10-k forms and much more. Furthermore, ARs
are a genre of reports diffused globally (Ruther-
ford, 2005; Meyer and Höllerer, 2010). Hence,
the choice of ARs as a backbone for our corpus
allows for a careful international sampling strat-
egy balancing different kinds of corporations from
different countries. This property makes our cor-
pus particularly well suited for deeper economic
investigations with respect to cross-index, cross-
industry and cross-country comparisons.

3.1 Selection of Raw Data

ARs as well as CSRRs are considered relevant for
our corpus based on two main criteria, namely the
company that issued them and the year they report
about. We selected companies in a step-wise pro-
cess, first selecting the countries of origin and then
the stock indices they were listed in.

Regarding the selection of countries, we chose
the US, the UK and Germany, because altogether
their total GDP makes up for 30% of the WGDP
(as of 2014), thus representing a relevant portion
of the global economy. For each of these three
countries, 90 companies where selected for inclu-
sion in our corpus. We first took the 30 most in-
tensively traded and most highly valued corpora-
tions of the American Dow Jones Industrial Aver-
age (DIJA), the British Financial Times Stock Ex-
change (FTSE 100) and the German Stock Index
(DAX; “Deutscher Aktienindex”). Next, we added
reports of middle-sized companies (30 per coun-
try) and technology companies (again 30 per coun-
try) for a total of 270 companies in our sample.
Middle-sized companies were selected from the
S&P500, the FTSE 250 and the MDAX, whereas
tech firms were chosen from the NASDAQ, the
FTSE AIM 100 and the TECDAX indices for the
US, the UK and Germany, respectively. We se-

lected each corporation from the three countries so
that they matched the corresponding two counter-
parts with respect to industry segment, sales and
trading volumes.

Lastly, we let the time span of our corpus range
between the years 2000 and 2015. Each report
(AR and CSRR) from one of the 270 companies in
the previously defined sample that addresses one
of these years was included in the corpus, if pos-
sible (see also the following Subsection 3.2). The
year 2000 was chosen as a starting point because
of, first, the burst of the dotcom-bubble and, sec-
ond, the upcoming of CSRRs. Further details re-
garding our sampling strategy are provided in the
README file of our corpus distribution.

3.2 Data Acquisition and Cleansing
The reports determined in this way were collected
by three student assistants from the Business and
Management Department by downloading the re-
ports in PDF format from the companies’ web-
sites. In some cases, especially for documents
from the early 2000s, reports were not available
for downloading. The students (and, if necessary,
one of the authors) then requested the documents
directly from the respective investor relations de-
partment via email. The following metadata were
recorded: report type (either AR or CSRR), refer-
ence year of the report2 (as given on the title page),
company of origin, and stock index.

2 In some cases, and in particular with regard to CSRR,
sometimes multiple consecutive years were indicated. In
these cases, only the first year is considered as reference year.

We used the pdf2text software by glyphand-
cog.com to extract plain text from the collected
PDF files. In general, this software extracts text
with sufficient quality. However, the final result
depends heavily on the layout and style of the in-
put files. For this reason, the resulting plain text
files were iteratively refined in a rule-based fash-
ion. This post-processing included restoring of the
original text structure of headings and paragraphs,
deleting superfluous line breaks and hyphenation,
page numbers and (rarely occurring) odd charac-
ter sequences, as well as remnants of structured
data, such as tables. This post-processing strategy
yielded a mostly clean corpus of raw textual data
only, i.e., preserving the running text of the origi-
nal PDF files as good as possible while at the same
time stripping off all irrelevant non-linguistic data.

3.3 Corpus Analysis

After corpus construction, we used NLTK.org
tools (Bird, 2006) for counting tokens and sen-
tences for all of the reports. The results, summa-
rized for each stock index, are depicted in Table
1. In total, our corpus comprises almost 5,000
reports, summing up to 282M tokens (9M sen-
tences). This constitutes a substantial collection
of textual data (for comparison, the BNC, ANC,
and DEREKO contain 100M, 15M, and 42B to-
kens, respectively). The vast majority of the data
set consists of ARs (247M tokens vs. 35M tokens
from CSRRs). American, British and German cor-
porations are properly represented in the data set,

i.e., for each of these countries, their three indices
add up to about 90M tokens.

Figure 1 depicts the growth curves for ARs as
well as CSRRs. As can be seen, for both ARs and
CSRRs, the number of reports increases over time.
This graph also reflects the fact that documents
become harder to acquire the older they are, as
we have experienced during data collection. Note
that we could only collect a marginal number of
CSRRs for the year 2000 (11). This is due to the
fact, that their issuance became wide-spread only
in this and the following years, as discussed above.

3.4 Word Embeddings

The distribution of the plain text data of JOCO
is restricted by Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)
regulations. As a substitute, we train word em-
beddings using the FastText.cc toolkit (Bo-
janowski et al., 2017) to capture the distributional
semantics of economic jargon. As a prerequisite,
the corpus was tokenized using NLTK and case-
folded. Only words with frequency ≥ 50 were
modeled. Subword information was not taken into
account. The latter two decision were taken to de-
crease the number of artifacts stemming from the
PDF conversion in our final embedding model.

To illustrate the semantics captured in this way,
Table 2 lists sample entries of our embedding
model together with their five nearest neighbors.
As can be seen, the results reveal high face va-
lidity: “growth”, e.g., exhibits strong reference
to its economic meaning (such as in “double-digit
growth” or “organic growth”) but does not refer
to biological growth which may have been indi-
cated by neighbors like “plant” or “hormones”.

4 Effects of Organizational Emotions

To demonstrate the potential of the JOCO corpus,
we investigate the interaction of linguistic signals
from corporations and their market performance.
We focus on emotions expressed in ARs since the
interplay of organizational cognition, character,
and emotions is becoming a hot topic in organiza-
tion science (Albrow, 1992; King, 2015; Buechel
et al., 2016; Händschke et al., 2017). We con-
ducted this work on a subsample of the corpus
covering British and German firms only and their
ARs from 2008 to 2015 to allow for European
comparability. Financial and accounting metadata
were retrieved from AMADEUS,3 a database that
holds data of European firms (except for banks and
insurance companies).

In the regression analysis, we employ the gener-
alized estimating equations (GEE) method (Liang
and Zeger, 1986), a time series model that handles
repeating observations over time. In our case we
use its multivariate linear regression variant (see
the Appendix for details). The dependent variable
‘performance’ is operationalized as Return on Eq-
uity (ROE), lagged by one year to allow for causal-
ity. Following the established psychological VAD
model of emotions (Bradley and Lang, 1994), the
independent explanatory variables are three di-
mensions of espoused organizational emotions—
Valence, Arousal, and Dominance. These three di-
mensions are measured individually for each AR
using the open-source tool JEmAS4 (Buechel and
Hahn, 2016) that yields a value for each of the di-
mensions per firm per year. Due to the high corre-
lation between dominance and valence, the latter
variable was dropped from the model to prevent
biasing of the estimators (cf. the correlation ma-
trix given in the Appendix, Table 3). Control vari-
ables are the corporation’s size (in terms of em-
ployees and assets, both logarithmized),5 opera-
tional profitability (sales per employee and sales
per assets) and country of origin measured with a
dummy variable where Germany is coded as ‘1’.

For our full model (Model III in Table 4), we
find that Arousal has a significant (p < .001)
negative effect on ROE, meaning that a com-
pany performs better, the calmer it communi-
cates. However, this effect is more pronounced for
British companies since the interaction term be-

tween Arousal and country (GER) shows a signif-
icant (p < .001) positive effect. Thus, our results
suggest that espoused organizational emotional-
ity correlates with performance, yet the nature
of this interaction is country-dependent. Accord-
ingly, our findings point towards the existence of a
distinct organizational character (King, 2015) and
emotionality (Albrow, 1992), and thus render sup-
port viewing organizations as social actors (King
et al., 2010; Bromley and Sharkey, 2017). This
piece of evidence might have far-reaching impli-
cations for the organizations’ role and responsibil-
ity in society (Beyer et al., 2014).

5 Conclusion

We introduced JOCO, a novel text corpus for NLP
analytics in the field of economics, business and
management. This corpus comprises ARs and
CSRRs of 270 publicly traded corporations in the
US, UK and Germany from 2000 to 2015. Alto-
gether, we assembled roughly up to 5,000 reports
and, in total, 282M tokens (9M sentences). By
design, JOCO carefully balances various charac-
teristics allowing cross-index, cross-industry, and
cross-country comparisons and, thus, enables in-
formed prospective applications in business re-
search and economics, for which we provided a
first, yet preliminary example.

A Supplemental Material

In general, the estimating technique must address
the main characteristics of the data at hand. Due
to the repeated observations over the eight years
(from 2008 to 2015), the investigated cases are not
independent from each other which increases the
likelihood of autocorrelation in the data. In or-
der to appropriately deal with this issue, we em-
ploy the generalized estimating equations (GEE)
method (Liang and Zeger, 1986). We report
population-average estimators with fixed effects
that allow us to control for organizational differ-
ences we cannot account for directly. Also, this
model allows for omitting observable but stable
organizational characteristics. We use a normal
distribution for modeling the dependent variable.
