Abstract

This paper presents a method for the syn-
tactic simplification of French texts. Syn-
tactic simplification aims at making texts
easier to understand by simplifying com-
plex syntactic structures that hinder read-
ing. Our approach is based on the study
of two parallel corpora (encyclopaedia ar-
ticles and tales). It aims to identify the lin-
guistic phenomena involved in the manual
simplification of French texts and organ-
ise them within a typology. We then pro-
pose a syntactic simplification system that
relies on this typology to generate simpli-
fied sentences. The module starts by gen-
erating all possible variants before select-
ing the best subset. The evaluation shows
that about 80% of the simplified sentences
produced by our system are accurate.

1 Introduction

In most of our daily activities, the ability to read
quickly and effectively is an undeniable asset,
even often a prerequisite (Willms, 2003). How-
ever, a sizeable part of the population is not able
to deal adequately with the texts they face. For
instance, Richard et al. (1993) reported that, in 92
applications for an unemployment allowance filled
by people with a low level of education, about half
of the required information was missing (some of
which was crucial for the processing of the appli-
cation), mainly because of comprehension issues.

These comprehension issues are often related
to the complexity of texts, particularly at the lex-
ical and syntactic levels. These two factors are
known to be important causes of reading difficul-
ties (Chall and Dale, 1995), especially for young
children, learners of a foreign language or people
with language impairments or intellectual disabil-
ities.

In this context, automatic text simplification
(ATS) appears as a means to help various peo-
ple access more easily the contents of the written
documents. ATS is an application domain of Nat-
ural Language Processing (NLP) aiming at mak-
ing texts more accessible for readers, while en-
suring the integrity of their contents and structure.
Among the investigations in this regard are those
of Caroll et al. (1999), Inui et al. (2003) and, more
recently, of Rello et al. (2013), who developed
tools to produce more accessible texts for people
with language disabilities such as aphasia, deaf-
ness or dyslexia. In the FIRST project, Barbu et
al. (2013) and Evans and Orăsan (2013) imple-
mented a simplification system for patients with
autism, who may also struggle to understand diffi-
cult texts.

However, reading assistance is not only in-
tended for readers with disabilities, but also for
those who learn a new language (as first or sec-
ond language). De Belder and Moens (2010) fo-
cused on ATS for native English schoolchildren,
while Siddharthan (2006), Petersen and Ostendorf
(2007) and Medero and Ostendorf (2011) focused
on learners of a second language. Williams and
Reiter (2008), Aluisio et al. (2008) and Gasperin
et al. (2009) addressed ATS for illiterate adults.
Most of these studies are dealing with the En-
glish language, with the exception of some work
in Japanese (Inui et al., 2003), Spanish (Saggion
et al., 2011; Bott et al., 2012), Portuguese (Aluı́sio
et al., 2008) and French (Seretan, 2012).

ATS was also used as a preprocessing step to
increase the effectiveness of subsequent NLP op-
erations on texts. Chandrasekar et al. (1996)
first considered that long and complex sentences
were an obstacle for automatic parsing or machine
translation and they showed that a prior simplifi-
cation may result in a better automatic analysis
of sentences. More recently, Heilman and Smith
(2010) showed that adding ATS in the context

47



of automatic question generation yields better re-
sults. Similarly, Lin and Wilbur (2007) and Jon-
nalagadda et al. (2009) optimized information ex-
traction from biomedical texts using ATS as a pre-
processing step.

In these studies, the simplifications carried out
are generally based on a set of manually defined
transformation rules. However, ATS may also
be solved with methods from machine transla-
tion and machine learning. This lead some re-
searchers (Zhu et al., 2010; Specia, 2010; Wood-
send and Lapata, 2011) to train statistical models
from comparable corpora of original and simpli-
fied texts. The data used in these studies are of-
ten based on the English Wikipedia (for original
texts) and the Simple English Wikipedia, a simpli-
fied version for children and non-native speakers
that currently comprises more than 100,000 arti-
cles. Similar resources exist for French, such as
Vikidia and Wikimini, but texts are far less nu-
merous in these as in their English counterpart.
Moreover, the original and simplified versions of
an article are not strictly parallel, which further
complicates machine learning. This is why, so far,
there was no attempt to adapt this machine learn-
ing methodology to French. The only previous
work on French, to our knowledge, is that of Sere-
tan (2012), which analysed a corpus of newspa-
pers to semi-automatically detect complex struc-
tures that has to be simplified. However, her sys-
tem of rules has not been implemented and evalu-
ated.

In this paper, we aim to further investigate the
issue of syntactic simplification for French. We
assume a midway point between the two main ten-
dencies in the field. We use parallel corpora sim-
ilar to those used in machine learning approaches
and analyse it to manually define a set of simpli-
fication rules. We have also implemented the syn-
tactic part of our typology through a simplification
system. It is based on the technique of overgen-
eration, which consists in generating all possible
simplified variants of a sentence, and then on the
selection of the best subset of variants for a given
text with the optimization technique known as in-
teger linear programming (ILP). ILP allows us to
specify a set of constraints that regulate the selec-
tion of the output by the syntactic simplification
system. This method has already been applied to
ATS in English by Belder and Moens (2010) and
Woodsend and Lapata (2011).

To conclude, the contributions of this paper are:
(1) a first corpus-based study of simplification pro-
cesses in French that relies on a corpus of parallel
sentences, (2) the organization of this study’s re-
sults in what might be the first typology of sim-
plification for French based on a corpus analysis
of original and simplified texts; (3) two new crite-
ria to select the best subset of simplified sentences
among the set of variants, namely the spelling list
of Catach (1985) and the use of keywords, and
finally (4) a syntactic simplification system for
French, a language with little resources as regards
text simplification.

In the next sections, we first present the cor-
pora building process (Section 2.1) and describe
a general typology of simplification derived from
our corpora (Section 2.2). Then, we present the
system based on the syntactic part of the typol-
ogy, which operates in two steps: overgeneration
of all possible simplified sentences (Section 2.3.1)
and selection of the best subset of candidates us-
ing readability criteria (Section 2.3.2) and ILP.
Finally, we evaluate the quality of the syntacti-
cally simplified sentences as regards grammatical-
ity, before performing some error analysis (Sec-
tion 3).

2 Methodology

2.1 Corpus Description

We based our typology of simplification rules on
the analysis of two corpora. More specifically,
since our aim is to identify and classify the var-
ious strategies used to transform a complex sen-
tence into a more simple one, the corpora had to
include parallel sentences. The reason why we
analysed two corpora is to determine whether dif-
ferent genres of texts lead to different simplifica-
tion strategies. In this study, we focused on the
analysis of informative and narrative texts. The in-
formative corpus comprises encyclopaedia articles
from Wikipedia 1 and Vikidia 2. For the narrative
texts, we used three classic tales by Perrault, Mau-
passant and Daudet and their simplified versions
for learners of French as a foreign language.

To collect the first of our parallel corpora, we
used the MediaWiki API to retrieve Wikipedia
and Vikidia articles with the same title. The

http://fr.wikipedia.org

2
This site is intended for young people from eight to thirteen years and gathers more

accessible articles than Wikipedia, both in terms of language and content. It is available at
the address http://fr.vikidia.org

48



WikiExtractor 3 was then applied to the articles
to discard the wiki syntax and only keep the raw
texts. This corpus comprises 13,638 texts (7,460
from Vikidia and only 6,178 from Wikipedia,
since some Vikidia articles had no counterpart in
Wikipedia).

These articles were subsequently processed to
identify parallel sentences (Wikipedia sentence
with a simplified equivalent in Vikidia). The align-
ment has been made partly manually and partly
automatically with the monolingual alignment al-
gorithm described in Nelken and Shieber (2006),
which relies on a cosine similarity between sen-
tence vectors weighted with the tf-idf. This pro-
gram outputs alignments between sentences, along
with a confidence score. Among these files,
twenty articles or excerpts from Wikipedia were
selected along with their equivalent in Vikidia.
This amounts to 72 sentences for the former and
80 sentences for the latter.

The second corpus is composed of 16 narra-
tive texts, and more specifically tales, by Perrault,
Maupassant, and Daudet. We used tales since
their simplified version was closer to the origi-
nal than those of longer novels, which made the
sentence alignment simpler. The simplified ver-
sions of these tales were found in two collections
intended to learners of French as a foreign lan-
guage (FFL): “Hachette - Lire en français facile”
and “De Boeck - Lire et s’entrainer”. Their level
of difficulty ranges from A1 (Daudet) to B1 (Mau-
passant) on the CEFR scale (Council of Europe,
2001), with Perrault being A2. The texts were dig-
itized by OCR processing and manually aligned,
by two annotators, with an adjudication phase for
the disagreement cases. In this corpus, we anal-
ysed 83 original sentences and their correspond-
ing 98 simplified versions, which gives us a size
roughly similar to the Wikipedia-Vikidia corpus.

The two corpora created are relevant for a man-
ual analysis, as done in the next section, but they
are too small for automatic processing. We plan
to implement a method to align automatically the
narrative texts in the near future and thus be able
to collect a larger corpus.

2.2 Simplification Typology

The observations carried out on these two cor-
pora have made it possible to establish a typol-
ogy organised according to three main linguistic

3
http://medialab.di.unipi.it/wiki/Wikipedia\_Extractor

levels of transformation: lexical, discursive and
syntactic, which can be further divided into sub-
categories. It is worth mentioning that in previ-
ous work, simplification is commonly regarded as
pertaining to two categories of phenomena: lexi-
cal and syntactic (Carroll et al., 1999; Inui et al.,
2003; De Belder and Moens, 2010). Little atten-
tion has been paid to discourse in the area of auto-
matic simplification (Siddharthan, 2006).

The typology is summarized in Table 1. As
regards the lexicon, the phenomena we observed
involve four types of substitution. First, dif-
ficult terms can be replaced by a synonym or
an hypernym perceived as simpler. Second,
some anaphoric expressions, considered simpler
or more explicit, are preferred to their counter-
parts in the original texts. For example, in our
three tales, simplified nominal anaphora are regu-
larly used instead of pronominal anaphora. Third,
rather than using synonymy, the authors of the
simplified texts sometimes replace difficult words
with a definition or an explanatory paraphrase. Fi-
nally, in the particular case where the original texts
contain concepts in a foreign language, these non-
French terms are translated.

At the discourse level, the authors of simple
texts pay particular attention to the organization
of the information which has to be clear and con-
cise. To this end, clauses may be interchanged
to ensure a better presentation of the information.
In addition, information of secondary importance
can be removed while explanations or examples
are added for clarity. These two phenomena can
appear to be contradictory (deletion and addition),
but they actually operate in a common goal: make
the main information more comprehensible. Par-
ticular attention is also placed on the coherence
and cohesion of the text: Authors tend to explain
the pronouns and explicit the relations between
sentences. The last observed strategy is that im-
personal structures are often personalized.

Finally, at the syntactic level, five types of
changes are observed: tense modification, dele-
tion, modification, splitting and grouping. The last
two types can be considered together since they
are two opposite phenomena.

• First, the tenses used in the simplified ver-
sions are more common and less literary than
those used in the original texts. Thus, the
present and present perfect are preferred to
the simple past, imperfect and past perfect.

Table 1: Typology of simplifications

• Secondary or redundant information, that is
generally considered removable at the syn-
tactic level, is not included in the simplified
texts. Adverbial clauses, some adverbs and
adjectives and subordinate clauses, among
others, are omitted.
• When some complex structures are not

deleted, then they are often moved or modi-
fied for better clarity. Such structures include
negative sentences, impersonal structures, in-
direct speech and subordinate clauses.
• The authors sometimes choose to divide long

sentences or conversely merge several sen-
tences into one. The grouping of elements is
much less frequent than the division of sen-
tences. To split a sentence, the authors gen-
erally transform a secondary clause–be it rel-
ative, coordinate, subordinate, participial or
adjectival–into an independent clause.

This classification can be compared with that of
Medero et al. (2011) who propose three categories
– division, deletion and extension – or that of Zhu
et al. (2010), which includes division, deletion, re-
organization, and substitution.

Among those transformations, some are hardly
implementable. This is the case when a change
requires the use of semantics. For example, noun
modifiers may sometimes be removed, but in other
cases, they are necessary. However, there are of-
ten neither typographical nor grammatical marked
differences between the two cases.

Another issue is that other syntactic changes
should be accompanied by lexical transforma-
tions, which are difficult to generalize. For exam-
ple, transforming a negative sentence into its af-
firmative equivalent requires to find a verb whose
affirmative form includes the meaning of the neg-
ative construction to replace.

There are also changes that are very particular
and require a manual rather than an automatic pro-
cessing of the text, in the sense that each case is
different (even if part of a more global rule). In
addition, they usually involve discourse or lexical
information and not just syntactic one.

Finally, the syntactic changes impacting other
parts of the text or concerning elements that de-
pend on another structure require more compre-
hensive changes to the text. Therefore, they are
also difficult to handle automatically. Thus, to
change the tense of a verb in a sentence, we must
ensure that the sequence of tenses agree in the en-
tire text.

2.3 The Sentence Simplification System
We used this typology to implement a system of
syntactic simplification for French sentences. The
simplification is performed as a two-step process.
First, for each sentence of the text, we generate the
set of all possible simplifications (overgeneration
step), and then, we select the best subset of sim-
plified sentences using several criteria.

2.3.1 Generation of the Simplified Sentences
The sentence overgeneration module is based on a
set of rules (19 rules), which rely both on morpho-
syntactic features of words and on syntactic rela-
tionships within sentences. To obtain this infor-
mation, the texts from our corpus are analyzed
by MELT 4 (Denis and Sagot, 2009) and Bon-
sai 5 (Candito et al., 2010) during a preprocessing
phase. As a result, texts are represented as syn-
tax trees that include the information necessary to
apply our simplification rules. After preprocess-
ing, the set of simplification rules is applied recur-
sively, one sentence at a time, until there is no fur-
ther structure to simplify. All simplified sentences
produced by a given rule are saved and gathered in
a set of variants.

The rules for syntactic simplification included
in our program are of three kinds: deletion rules
(12 rules), modification rules (3 rules) and split-
ting rules (4 rules). With regards to our typology, it
can be noted that two types of rules have not been
implemented: aggregation rules and tense simpli-
fication rules. The merging strategies (in which
several sentences are aggregated into one) were

not observed consistently in the corpus. Moreover,
aggregation rules could have come into conflict
with the deletion rules, since they have opposite
goals. Concerning tense aspects, some of them
are indeed more likely to be used than others in
Vikidia. However, this strategy has not been im-
plemented, since it implies global changes to the
text. For instance, when a simple past is replaced
by a present form, we must also adapt the verbs in
the surrounding context in accordance with tense
agreement. This requires to consider the whole
text, or at least the paragraph that contains the
modified verbal form, and be able to automatically
model tense agreement. Otherwise, we may alter
the coherence of the text and decrease its readabil-
ity.

This leaves us with 19 simplification rules.6 To
apply them, the candidate structures for simplifi-
cation first need to be detected using regular ex-
pressions, via Tregex 7(Levy and Andrew, 2006)
that allows the retrieval of elements and relation-
ships in a parse tree. In a second step, syntactic
trees in which a structure requires simplification
are modified according a set of operations imple-
mented through Tsurgeon.

The operations to perform depend on the type
of rules:

1. For the deletion cases, simply deleting all
the elements involved is sufficient (via the
delete operation in Tsurgeon). The ele-
ments affected by the deletion rules are ad-
verbial clauses, clauses between brackets,
some of the subordinate clauses, clauses be-
tween commas or introduced by words such
as “comme” (as), “voire” (even), “soit” (ei-
ther), or similar terms, some adverbs and
agent prepositional phrases.

2. For the modification rules, several opera-
tions need to be combined: some terms are
dropped (via Tsurgeon delete), others
are moved (operation Tsurgeon move)
and specific labels are added to the text to sig-
nal a possible later processing. These labels
are useful for rules implying a modification
of tense or mode aspects for a verb. In such
cases, tags are added around the verb to indi-
cate that it needs to be modified. The mod-
ification is performed later, using the conju-

gation system Verbiste.8 For instance, to
change a passive into an active structure, not
only the voice must be changed, but some-
times also the person, so that the verb agrees
well with the agent that has become the new
subject. As regards modification rules, three
changes were implemented: moving adver-
bial clauses at the beginning of the sentence,
transforming passive structures into active
forms, and transforming a cleft to a non-cleft.

3. For the splitting rules, we followed a two-
step process. The subordinate clause is first
deleted, while the main clause is saved as a
new sentence. Resuming from the original
sentence, the main clause is, in turn, removed
to keep only the subordinate clause, which
must then be transformed into an independent
clause. In general, the verbal form of the sub-
ordinate clause needs to be altered in order to
operate as a main verb. Moreover, the pro-
noun governing the subordinated clause must
be substituted with its antecedent and the sub-
ject must be added when missing. In the case
of a relative clause, the relative pronoun thus
needs to be substituted by its antecedent, but
it is also important to consider the function
of the pronoun to find out where to insert this
antecedent. Our splitting rules apply when a
sentence includes either relative or participle
clauses, or clauses introduced by a colon or a
coordinating conjunction.

All these simplification rules are applied recur-
sively to a sentence until all possible alternatives
have been generated. Therefore, it is common to
have more than one simplified variant for a given
sentence. In this case, the next step consists in se-
lecting the most suitable variant to substitute the
original one. The selection process is described in
the next section.

2.3.2 Selection of the Best Simplifications
Given a set of candidate simplified sentences for a
text, our goal is to select the best subset of simpli-
fied sentences, that is to say the subset that max-
imizes some measure of readability. More pre-
cisely, text readability is measured through differ-
ent criteria, which are optimized with an Integer
Linear Programming (ILP) approach (Gillick and
Favre, 2009). These criteria are rather simple in

razin.

51



this approach. They are used to ensure that not
only the syntactic difficulty, but also the lexical
complexity decrease, since syntactic transforma-
tions may cause lexical or discursive alterations in
the text.

We considered four criteria to select the most
suitable sentences among the simplified set: sen-
tence length (in words) (hw), mean word length
(in characters) in the sentence (hs), familiarity of
the vocabulary (ha), and presence of some key-
words (hc). While the first two criteria are pretty
obvious as regards implementation, we measured
word familiarity based on Catach’s list (1985).9 It
contains about 3,000 of the most frequent words
in French, whose spelling should be taught in pri-
ority to schoolchildren. The keywords were in this
study simply defined as any term occurring more
than once in the text.

These four criteria were combined using integer
linear programming as follows: 10

Maximize : hw + hs + ha + hc
Where : hw = wps×∑i si −∑i lwi si

hs = cpw×∑i lwi si −∑i lcisi
ha = aps×∑i si −∑i lai si
hc =

∑
j wjcj

Subject to:
∑

i∈gk si = 1 ∀gk
sioccij ≤ cj ∀i, j∑

i sioccij ≥ cj ∀j
(1)

The above variables are defined as follows:

• wps: desired (mean) number of words per sentence
• cpw: desired (mean) number of characters per word
• aps: desired (mean) number of words absent from

Catach’s list for a sentence

• si: binary variable indicating whether the sentence i
should be kept or not, with i varying from 1 to the total
number of simplified sentences

• cj : binary variable indicating whether keyword j is in
the simplification or not, with j varying from 1 to the
total number of keywords

• lwi : length of sentence i in words
• lci : number of characters in sentence i
• lai : number of words absent from Catach’s list in sen-

tence i

• wj : number of occurrences of keyword j
• gk: set of simplified sentences obtained from the same

original sentence k

• occij : binary variable indicating the presence of term j
in sentence i

We used an ILP module based on glpk that is available at the address http://
www.gnu.org/software/glpk/

wps, cpw and aps are constant parameters
whose values have been set respectively to 10, 5
and 2 for this study. 5 for cpw corresponds to the
value computed on the Vikidia corpus, while for
wps and aps, lower values than observed were
used to force simplification (respectively 10 in-
stead of 17 and 2 instead of 31).

However, these parameters may vary depending
on the context of use and the target population, as
they determine the level of difficulty of the simpli-
fied sentences obtained.

The constraints specify that (i) for each original
sentence, at most one simplification set should be
chosen, (ii) selecting a sentence means selecting
all the terms it contains and (iii) selecting a key-
word is only possible if it is present in at least one
selected sentence.

We illustrate this process with the Wikipedia ar-
ticle entitled Abel. This article contains 25 sen-
tences, from which 67 simplified sentences have
been generated. For the original sentence (1a) for
example, 5 variants were generated and simplifi-
cation (2) was selected by ILP.

3 Evaluation

Syntactic simplification involves substantial
changes within the sentence both in terms of
contents and form. It is therefore important to
check that the application of a rule does not cause
errors that would make the sentences produced
unintelligible or ungrammatical. A manual
evaluation of our system’s efficiency to generate
correct simplified sentences was carried out on
our two corpora. In each of them, we selected a
set of texts that had not been previously used for

the typological analysis, that is to say 9 articles
from Wikipedia (202 sentences) and two tales
from Perrault (176 sentences). In this evaluation,
all simplified sentences are considered, not only
those selected by ILP. The results are displayed in
Table 3 and discussed in Section 3.1. Two types
of errors can be detected: those resulting from
morpho-syntactic preprocessing, and particularly
the syntactic parser, and the simplification errors
per se, that we discuss in larger details in Section
3.2.

3.1 Quantitative Evaluation
Out of the 202 sentences selected in the informa-
tive corpus for evaluation, 113 (56%) have under-
gone one or more simplifications, which gives us
333 simplified variants. Our manual error analy-
sis revealed that 71 sentences (21%) contain some
errors, among which we can distinguish those due
to the preprocessing from those actually due to the
simplification system itself. It is worth mention-
ing that the first category amounts to 89% of the
errors, while the simplification rule are only re-
sponsible for 11% of those. We further refined the
analysis of the system’s errors distinguishing syn-
tactic from semantic errors.

The scores obtained on the narrative corpus are
slightly less good: out of the 369 simplified vari-
ants produced from the 154 original sentences, 77
(20.9%) contain errors. This value is very simi-
lar to the percentage for the informative corpus.
However, only 50.7% of these errors are due to the
preprocessing, while the remaining 49.3% come
from our rules. It means that our rules yield about
10.3% incorrect simplified variants compared to
2.7% for the informative corpus. Nevertheless,
these errors are caused mostly by 2 or 3 rules:
the deletion of subordinate clauses, of infinitives
or of clauses coordinated with a colon. This loss
in efficiency can be partly explained by the greater
presence of indirect speech in the tales that include
more non-removable subordinate clauses, difficult

to distinguish from removable clauses.
Globally, our results appear to be in line with

those of similar systems developed for English.12

Yet, few studies have a methodology and evalu-
ation close enough to ours to allow comparison
of the results. Siddharthan (2006) assessed his
system output using three judges who found that
about 80% of the simplified sentences were gram-
matical, while 87% preserved the original mean-
ing. These results are very similar to our find-
ings that mixed the syntactic and discourse dimen-
sions. Drndarević et al. (2013) also presented the
output of their system to human judges who esti-
mated that 60% of the sentences were grammatical
and that 70% preserved the initial meaning. These
scores appear lower than ours, but Drndarević et
al. also used lexical rules, which means that their
error rate includes both grammatical and lexical
errors.

3.2 Error Analysis
As regards syntax, the structure of a sentence can
be modified so that it becomes grammatically in-
correct. Three simplification rules are concerned.
Deletion rules may cause this kind of problem, be-
cause they involve removing a part of the sentence,
considered as secondary. However, sometimes the
deleted element is essential, as in the case of the
removal of the referent of a pronoun. This type of
problem arises both with the deletion of a subor-
dinate clause or that of an infinitive clause. Dele-
tion rules are also subject to a different kind of
errors. During the reconstruction of the sentence
resulting from the subordinate clause, some con-
stituents, such as the subject, may not be properly
identified and will be misplaced in the new sen-
tence.

At the semantic level, the information conveyed
by the original sentence may be modified or even
removed. When an agent or an infinitive clause

are suppressed, the meaning of the sentence may
be disrupted or some of the content lost. For in-
stance, in the following sentence – extracted from
the Wikipedia article abbé (abbot) – the infinitive
clause explaining the term is dropped:

(2a) C’est aussi depuis le XVIIIe siècle
le terme en usage pour désigner un clerc
séculier ayant au moins reçu la ton-
sure.13

(2b) C’est aussi depuis le XVIIIe siècle
le terme en usage.

To fix the errors identified above, our rules should
be refined and developed, with the addition of
better tools for sentence regeneration as well as
some exclusion criteria for the incorrect sentences
within the ILP module, as discussed in the next
section.

4 Perspectives and Conclusions

This article describes an automatic syntactic sim-
plification system for French intended for children
and language learners. It is based on a set of rules
defined after a corpus study, which also led to the
development of a typology of simplifications in
French. It would be easy to extend our typology to
other target users based on other appropriate cor-
pora, such as people with language disorders.

Our approach also uses the technique of over-
generation, which makes it possible to retain the
best set of simplifications based on readability cri-
teria. Note that among those employed, some had
not been considered previously and produce inter-
esting results. Finally, we showed that the perfor-
mance of our system is good (about 80 % of the
generated sentences are correct) and in line with
previous studies.

13It is also the term in use since the 18th to refer to a secu-
lar cleric who, at least, received the tonsure.

The evaluation showed that the rules imple-
mented are more suitable for expository texts,
probably because they are more explicit, as style
there is of a minor importance. In addition, the
system set up was first tested on and therefore
adapted to Wikipedia. It was only subsequently
applied to narratives, that revealed new challenges,
especially concerning the deletion rules. The in-
formation provided in secondary clauses or com-
plements indeed seems most essential to under-
standing the story, especially when it comes to di-
rect or indirect speech. In order to comprehend
the differences in terms of efficiency and rules to
be applied between genres, it would be necessary
to extend our study to other texts collected in the
corpora.

We envision multiple perspectives to improve
our system. First, syntactic simplification could be
supplemented by lexical simplification, as is done
in some studies for English (Woodsend and Lap-
ata, 2011). Moreover, our error analysis has high-
lighted the need to add or repeat words when a
sentence is split. It would therefore be useful to
use a tool that manages references in order to im-
prove the quality of simplified text. In addition,
the sentence selection module could include addi-
tional selection criteria, based on the work done in
readability of French (François and Fairon, 2012).
A final perspective of improvement would be to
make the rule system adapt to the target audience
and the genre of the texts. This would require as-
sessing the relevance of various transformations
and selection criteria of the best simplifications.
This perspective would also require assessing the
effectiveness of the rules by means of comprehen-
sion tests both on the original and simplified sen-
tences, which we plan to do.
