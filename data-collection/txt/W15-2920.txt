Abstract

In this paper we introduce a novel compu-
tational technique of extraction of person-
ality traits (HEXACO) of employees from
Enterprise Social Media posts. We deal
with challenges such as not being able to
use existing survey instruments for scor-
ing and not being able to directly use ex-
isting psychological studies on written text
due to lack of overlapping words between
the existing dictionary and words used in
Enterprise Social Media. Using our ap-
proach we are able to infer personality
traits (HEXACO) from posts and find bet-
ter coverage and usage of the extended
dictionary.

1 Introduction

It is well known that modern organizations rely
heavily on unstructured information to capture
expertise and knowledge that otherwise exist in
the minds of its employees. Understanding the
behavior and personality of the employees help
in group formation and understanding group dy-
namics which could help predict project success.
Among the many ways in which modern organiza-
tional psychology (Ashton et al., 2004) describes
human personality, some important attributes that
generally emerge can be summarized as follows:

Agreeableness being helpful, cooperative and
sympathetic towards others

Conscientiousness being disciplined, organized
and achievement-oriented

Extraversion having a higher degree of sociabil-
ity, assertiveness and talkativeness

Emotionality the degree of emotional stability,
impulse control and anxiety

Openness to Experience having a strong intel-
lectual curiosity and a preference for novelty
and variety

Honesty-Humility being a good person who is
ethical and altruistic

These are collectively known as personality
traits in the HEXACO (Honesty-Humility, Emo-
tionality, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscien-
tiousness, Openness) personality trait model as de-
scribed in (Ashton et al., 2004). Intensity and po-
larity of each trait varies from person to person
thereby capturing a person’s personality. These
traits are measured by trained psychologists using
self rating or by being rated by the psychologist.
These rating scales such as the HEXACO-PI-R as
described in (Lee and Ashton, 2004) contain ques-
tions about the person that help in judging their
traits. (Ashton et al., 2004) also identifies sets of
personality describing words with loading factors
that are related to each trait which forms a dictio-
nary of such words.

Written text is a medium of communication
within a group, when members communicate
through emails and/or social media. Emails orig-
inate from individuals and are targeted towards a
specified set of people. In social media, there are
usually no targeted groups. Rather communication
is meant for as many people to see, read and react.
While emails are used for confidential information
exchange within an enterprise, enterprise social
networks are targeted towards rapid disbursement
of information across large communities. They
also encourage sharing of knowledge and infor-
mation, flatten hierarchy, and enable speedy res-
olution through crowd-sourcing.

These text sources are observed to contain very
few of the existing personality describing words.
In our corpus of an Enterprise Social Media
dataset, 0.22% percent of total word usage as well
as 152 words out of total 185,251 distinct words

140



contain personality describing words from the set
described in (Ashton et al., 2004). Our dataset has
a total of 14,849 distinct users of which only 1,939
users use atleast one of these words atleast once.
Whether they are at all used in the context of de-
scribing someone’s personality or behavior is not
studied.

These are a very low number and they do not
capture all the implicit expressions in the text de-
scribing someone’s personality or behavior. We
could however infer the presence of personality
describing words and other personality expres-
sions from such formal and semi-formal text. As
summarized in (Goldbeck et al., 2011a), personal-
ity traits are useful in predicting performance and
success in enterprise context. Hence, the motiva-
tion to explore other techniques to infer personal-
ity and behavior expressions about each individual
as well as group(s) from enterprise text sources.

2 Literature Survey

There are two different challenges in trying to as-
sess HEXACO traits from enterprise social media
as follows:

1. Psychologists have studied the problem of
identifying personality traits from language
usage. They have used various methods
amongst which rating scales, both self re-
ported and administered by trained psychol-
ogists are established techniques. The Big
Five Factors, HEXACO and other such mod-
els of personality traits have been related
to language usage by psychologists (Ash-
ton et al., 2004; Tausczik and Pennebaker,
2010). Pennbaker has conducted very many
studies relating how people of different de-
mographics in different situations use lan-
guage and how it relates to human behav-
ioral traits. In particular there are a set of
features which are identified as relevant to
human behavior. Linking of words to per-
sonality traits/behavioral traits has been done
by different groups of psychologists. A chal-
lenge here is that there are different lists used
by different groups.

2. In recent times, phenomenal rise in social
media content has given birth to the sub-area
of text mining where researchers analyze lan-
guage usage to infer behavioral traits from
social media content. Inferences are usually

validated by self appraisal or voluntary rev-
elation of identity or psychologists identify.
Since language usage is substantially differ-
ent in social media and the erstwhile con-
trolled psychoanalytic methods used by psy-
chologists, there has been efforts to generate
mappings between social media text and per-
sonality traits.

Existing literature in each of the these above ar-
eas are reviewed in detail below.

2.1 Review of related work in text analysis
for psychoanalysis

These have been used as features in most of the
recent work in identifying personality traits from
social media text. Most of these works have been
validated by trained psychologists. There is not
much work that has focussed on text which is from
business enterprises where language used is more
formal than on websites like Twitter and Face-
book.

We discuss below some of the related literature
with respect to the challenges mentioned in Sec-
tion 2.

(Ashton et al., 2004) reports in tabular form
a list of adjectives that relate to the each of the
HEXACO personality traits. This paper explores
the HEXACO personality trait model. It also ex-
plores Religiosity as an extra seventh factor and
accepts that there may be more factors than six. It
notes that the 1982 Goldberg 1,710 adjective set is
nearly the entire population of English personal-
ity descriptive adjectives. We use the result of this
study which results in a reduced set of the 1,710
personality descriptive adjectives in English with
loading factor for each of the six factors of the per-
sonality trait model. The reduction and identifica-
tion of the word set seem like an important work
for psychologists as it would enable them to work
with fewer words which may mean faster and con-
cise analysis. Use of computational power relaxes
this restriction. Now even with a much larger dic-
tionary it would be possible to scalably analyze
people’s personalities using computational models
of analysis.

(Tausczik and Pennebaker, 2010) and (Chung
and Pennebaker, 2007) describe the LIWC soft-
ware, its usage and relevance to psychological
processes. It summarizes how different parts of
speech used by people tell us about them and their
behavior. For example, it has been studied that lots

of use of first person personal pronouns is an indi-
cator of depression. Content words indicate where
the person is focussing such as people thinking
about death, sex, money, or friends will refer to
them in writing or conversation. People experi-
encing physical or emotional pain use first person
personal pronouns to draw attention to themselves.
Greater use of first person personal pronouns cor-
relates with higher rank and higher status. Higher
ranked individuals ask fewer questions. First per-
son singular pronoun usage can be used to predict
lower status. Greater use of first person plural pro-
nouns show group cohesion. Word count can be
a proxy for amount of communication and more
communication may promote better group perfor-
mance. Analysis of tense of verbs indicate tem-
poral focus of attention. ”We” signals a sense of
group identity. Sometimes ”We” also refers to oth-
ers. When lying, people tend to use more words,
more negative words, more motion words, less
first person singular pronouns. The use of ”You”
is important in predicting lower quality relation-
ships.

2.2 Review of related work on text mining of
social media content for behavior analysis

(Goldbeck et al., 2011b) gave questionnaires to
twitter users to fill out. They used structural prop-
erties such as number of followers, number of
following, density of social network, number of
mentions, hashtags, replies, links. For linguis-
tic features they used LIWC, MRC Psycholin-
guistic Database and sentiment analysis. Using
Weka, regression analysis was done for each fea-
ture for personality prediction within 11-18 per-
cent of their actual value. They did not make use
of a psychological validation of their results.

(Yarkoni, 2010) reports correlations between
LIWC categories and Big Five personality traits.
It also reports correlations with lower order facets.
694 participants collected using email or word of
mouth were given 100-question and 315-question
questionnaires for Big Five, NEO-FFI, NEO-PI-R.
Their dataset consists of participants blogs from
Google blogger service which may contain more
informal text and not enterprise social media. For
language usage study, top 5000 unstemmed words
(where each blog had more than 50,000 words) in
the corpus were ranked with respect to their fre-
quency. These words were correlated with each
of the Big Five and other lower order facets. For

example, Neuroticism correlated positively with
words expressing negative emotion such as aw-
ful, lazy, depressing, terrible and stressful; while
Extraversion correlated positively with words re-
flecting social settings or experiences such as bar,
restaurant, drinking, dancing, crowd and sang; ad-
ditionally Openness showed strong positive corre-
lations with words associated with intellectual or
cultural experience such as poet, culture, narra-
tive, art, universe and literature. Therefore, we are
motivated to explore language use, LIWC to study
personality traits.

(Schwartz et al., 2013; Kern et al., 2014; Park
et al., 2014) work with the myPersonality dataset
which consists of about 19 million Facebook sta-
tus updates from about 136,000 participants. Their
motivation for studying social media as against
a psychology lab is that social media language
is written in natural social settings, and captures
communication among friends and acquaintances.
They take two approaches to study language us-
age in reference to personality traits. One experi-
ment is closed vocabulary study where in for each
category for each participant the ratio of sum of
frequency of words used by participant in manu-
ally created category of language and sum of fre-
quency of words used by participants is noted.
Least squares regression is used to link word cate-
gories with author attributes, fitting a linear func-
tion between explanatory variables (LIWC cate-
gories) and dependent variables (such as a trait of
personality, e.g. Extraversion). This approach is
in some ways similar to earlier approaches. The
new approach they take is the open vocabulary ap-
proach, where they extract words, phrases(1 to 3
n-grams) and topics (using LDA) via tokenization.
The phrases with high pointwise mutual informa-
tion are retained. Correlation analysis using least
squares regression is carried out. They then find
categories extending the LIWC category list cor-
responding to Big Five traits. They also do a pre-
dictive evaluation using SVM and ridge regression
to predict personality traits using closed/open vo-
cabulary approach. They identify words related to
Big Five which are not present in LIWC and any
previous analysis. Based on this study, they de-
vise a prediction algorithm to identify personal-
ity traits. They do not report whether the myPer-
sonality dataset suffers the challenges of a non-
overlapping dictionary with LIWC or personality
describing words.

142



(Banerjee, 2002) describes the lesk similarity
algorithm that the software tool (Pedersen et al.,
2008) implementation being used as a similarity
algorithm is based on. The lesk algorithm uses
the information contained in a dictionary to per-
form word sense disambiguation. Here the dic-
tionary is WordNet. The intuition is that words
co occuring in a sentence are being used to re-
fer to the same topic, and topically related senses
of words are defined in the dictionary using the
same words. It suffers from the fact that lexicogra-
phers try to create concise definitions with as few
words as possible so even related words may not
have common words in their definitions. Using the
WordNet relations this is addressed. Every synset
in Wordnet has a gloss which is a definition ex-
plaining the meaning of the concept of the synset.
It also has example sentences. Semantic relation-
ships define a relationship between two synsets.
Thus, the glosses of various synset relationships
between the word being disambiguated are used
as dictionary definitions to the original lesk algo-
rithm. The similarity score between two words is
a sum of overlap between the various glosses in
Wordnet for each of the two words. The gloss in
Wordnet is an approximation of the dictionary def-
inition of the word. Examples of different kinds of
glosses used would be example-gloss, gloss-gloss,
hypo-gloss.

3 Methodology

Initially we have obtained data from our inter-
nal enterprise social network where approximately
300,000 people interact on various topics ranging
from technical to work life. This contains dif-
ferent types of posts such as microblogs, blogs,
questions, wikis and challenges over a period of 2
years. The other category of content include com-
ments, answers and responses to challenges. Con-
ventional statistical analysis was performed on the
data and the following are observed.

One of the ways we identify personality traits is
to use a similarity algorithm such as lesk (in Sec-
tion 2.1) to include adjectives from the dataset that
are similar to the adjectives in the HEXACO set
for each of the personality traits. In order to in-
crease our yield of personality descriptive words,
we include other personality descriptive words
similar to the HEXACO set before expanding our
set with words similar to those in the dataset.
There are 25,553 unique adjectives in the dataset,

which account for 13.79% of the vocabulary. We
create a similarity score matrix between the seed
set and adjectives in the dataset. In the lesk algo-
rithm using Wordnet, given a set of strings from
the gloss’ of each word, in order to calculate the
overlap score we need the longest common sub-
strings or phrases between them. For each such
overlapping substring, the individual score is num-
ber of words in the substring squared multiplied by
the number of times this substring repeats in the
definitions. This score is then weighted with the
weight of the type of gloss entry. For example, un-
demanding is a personality describing adjective of
the trait agreeableness and lenient is an adjective
in the dataset that has similarity with it and is part
of the extended HEXACO set. The words unde-
manding and lenient have glosses ”posing no dif-
ficulty requiring little effort” and ”demanding lit-
tle effort not burdensome”. The overlapping sub-
string here is ”little effort” so the overlap score be-
tween these two strings is 2*2*1 = 4. Sum over all
the glosses results in a score of 94 for undemand-
ing as an adjective in sense 1. For easy comparison
amongst various pairs of words, we normalize the
scores by dividing the similarity score of a pair of
words with the highest score between the different
senses of the pair of words. We threshold the min-
imum similarity we consider to include the word
as similar.

After applying the above algorithm, the earlier
list of 245 words was extended to include 2108
words out of which 1,999, i.e., 95% of the words
now appeared in the social media content. It was
found that 50% of the users have used one of
these 1,999 words atleast once. In the next section
we propose an algorithm for deriving personality
traits of people from their written content based on
the usage of this extended set.

We propose a computational means of assigning
HEXACO personality trait scores to people based
on their posts on enterprise social media. For each
person in our dataset, we consider all the posts au-
thored by the person. For each post, for words
from the extended HEXACO set, we sum their
contribution to the corresponding personality trait
and normalize using total words used by the au-
thor. Contribution of a word already in the HEX-
ACO set is the loading factor as given in (Ashton
et al., 2004). Contribution of a word is the sum of
the product of its similarity to a word in a trait and
the loading factor of that word in the trait normal-

ized by the total number of words in that trait it is
similar to.

4 Observations

From the tables depicting the intensity of each trait
in different communities, we can see that openness
and agreeableness are well represented and their
cummulative intensity in each community is high.

In taking a deeper look into the higher order
elements in enterprise social media content we
use LIWC2007 (Pennebaker et al., 2007a) on the
dataset. 2.1% of our enteprise social media dataset
vocabulary are indicative of LIWC processes that
account for 43.7% of total enterprise social media
content used by 90.51% of the users. This indi-
cates the importance of LIWC processes that are
indicative of behavioral traits.

LIWC usage is not directly linked to HEXACO
properties, although as reviewed in section 2.1
there have been attempts at using LIWC processes
as features that contribute to prediction of Big Five
personality traits from web social media. Dataset
variability makes it infeasible in many cases to do
this mapping as datasets vary in the linguistic fea-
tures that are indicative of behavior. It is partic-
ularly applicable in our case where there are re-
strained expressions unlike other social media.

We study a subset of users from two communi-
ties who have posted atleast a few blogs over the
period of 2 years and also have received atleast a
few comments so that we may be able to make
meaningful observations. We see that openness
correlates positively with positive emotion ex-
pressed in posts and honesty correlates strongly
negatively with negative emotions expressed in
posts. We do see that people scoring of their posts
on each of the hexaco traits using our method re-
ceive near about the same score on the comments
they receive indicating that they are possibly per-
ceived as they appear in the posts. From Table 5
and 6, we observe that people’s extended HEX-
ACO trait scores on their posts using our meth-
ods are strongly correlated with those on the com-
ments they receive, indicating that they are possi-
bly perceived as they appear in their posts. It is
slightly lower for Honesty and Emotionality traits
but high for Extraversion, Agreeableness, Consci-
entiousness and Openness. It indicates that peo-
ple who are more open, agreeable, extraverted,
conscientious evoke similar traits from people re-
sponding to them in an organization. Another in-

end procedure

teresting observation is that there is a low correla-
tion between openness scores of a person posting
and the use of emotive words, which indicates that
use of positive emotive words or negative emo-
tive words is largely independent of how open and
straightforward a person is and evokes that senti-
ment. We also see that use of a lot of emotion
words positive or negative evokes the same kind
of emotion in received comments as well.

5 Conclusion and Future Work

Though the set has increased, however, these
words still account for only 1.1% of the vocab-
ulary contributing to 3.95% of total word usage.
So it can be concluded that though both usage and
coverage have gone up still there is a large vol-
ume of enterprise social content which remains
untapped. Hence, we propose to look at higher
order linguistic elements like phrases, interaction
patterns and also LIWC processes, as detailed in
(Pennebaker et al., 2007b), in text for better cov-
erage.

Figure 1: Average usage of first person personal
pronouns

Figure 1 is a profile of the average usage of
first person personal pronouns by top 50 bloggers.
We see that 4 people score significantly higher
than others and it is suspected (Tausczik and Pen-
nebaker, 2010; Chung and Pennebaker, 2007) that
they are neurotic and depressed. On reading their
posts, we find that the highest scorer posts origi-
nal depressing short stories which have a fan fol-
lowing that encourage the author through positive
comments. Therefore, we see that just word us-
age without communication and other structural
aspects do not capture the context in which the
words have been used and hence may wrongly
identify the author as depressed or neurotic.

As of now we do not have scoring annotations
of HEXACO scores using employee completed

146



(Lee and Ashton, 2004) but we intend to gather
text and annotations from employees using sur-
veys to compare our results.
