 Abstract 

This paper presents the key results of a 

study on the global competitiveness of the 

European Machine Translation market in 

comparison to North America and Asia. 

The study focuses on seven dimensions 

that have been selected to characterize the 

machine translation market. The study 

concludes that while Europe still has 

strong positions in Research and Innova-

tion, it lags behind North America and 

Asia in Industry and Investments, and is 

also weaker than North America in Infra-

structure, Data availability, and Market 

visibility. 

1 Introduction 

The aim of this study was to analyze a 

competitiveness of the European machine 

translation (MT) market in comparison to North 

America (Unites States and Canada) and Asia 

(China, Japan, India, South Korea and Singapore). 

This research is a part of a wider undertaking to 

identify possible shortcomings and opportunities 

for the European Language Technology (LT) mar-

ket and identify potential actions that need to be 

addressed at the European Union level.  

The analysis is based on an extensive desk re-

search of various studies, policy papers, and 

online information sources. The quantitative foun-

dation of the analysis is based on the surveys and 

interviews done by and analysed under the leader-

ship of IDC in the framework of the SMART pro-

ject1.  It is also an aggregation and analysis of data 

collected from previous studies on MT and the 

broader localization and translation sector, and

overall economic indicators (e.g., World Eco-

nomic Forum, 2017; Common Sense Advisory 

(Lommel et al., 2016); TAUS (Massardo, 2016; 

Seligman, 2017; TAUS, 2017); CRACKER 

(2015; SRIA, 2017) and META-NET (2015)). 

The study focuses on seven dimensions that can 

characterize the machine translation market as 

part of the broader language technology market: 

Research, Innovation, Investment, Market domi-

nance, Industry, Infrastructure, and Open Data. 

These dimensions were analysed for global com-

petitiveness, highlighting the most important 

achievements and gaps in the LT ecosystem be-

tween Europe and its largest global competitors – 

North America and Asia. To characterise each di-

mension, a number of criteria were analysed. Us-

ing these results, we have ranked the markets 

within each dimension on a scale from 1 (weakest) 

to 3 (strongest). 

The full report of the findings from the study 

has been submitted to the European Commission. 

In this paper we have summarized the key find-

ings of this report.  

2 Competitiveness of European MT Re-
search 

The following criteria were used as quantitative 

indicators: number of research centres, number of 

research publications, organizational infrastruc-

ture (e.g. associations, networks and research 

infrastructures). 

We analysed publicly available information 

about research centres in different countries. Since 

information about the size of research institutions 

(e.g. number and qualification of researchers, re-

search budget, number of projects) is not available 

in public sources, research institutions are not 

weighted for their size.

2.1 Research Centres 

The recent Wikipedia article “List of research la-

boratories for machine translation” lists 113 insti-

tutions, from which 91 are in scope of our study. 

This list includes academic, governmental, and 

corporate sites. This list confirms a strong re-

search capacity in Europe, as it has 47 academic 

research centers compared to only 18 in America 

and 9 in Asia (see Table 1).

Table 1. Number of research laboratories for machine trans-

lation in different regions 

The higher number of European research cen-

tres compared to the number of North American 

research centres is also reflected in the member-

ship of the European Association of Machine 

Translation (EAMT)2 that lists 43 R&D groups 

and 16 corporate members. The American Associ-

ation of Machine Translation (AMTA) lists 15 ac-

ademic research organizations and 6 industrial re-

search labs3. The Asia-Pacific Association for MT 

has 32 corporate members and over 66 individual 

members4. 

2.2 Publications 

In this study, we researched   publications in the 

Scopus database5. The research publications 

include both academic and industry researchers. 

However, it could be that industry research is 

underrepresented, since not all industry research 

results are made public. Although research papers 

in the fields of our study are collected by several 

online repositories - SCOPUS, Web of Science 

(WoS), DBPL, Google Scholar, arXiv, CiteSeer – 

only Scopus and WoS provide the information and 

analytical tools that were needed for this study. 

Both Scopus and WoS are well established 

academic citation indexes that are widely used to 

assess the outcome and impact of scientific work. 

However, Scopus has better coverage for our 

study.   

To calculate the regional distribution of publi-

cations, the methodology used by Scopus to count 

the distribution of publications between countries

was applied, i.e., if authors of the same publica-

tion represent different regions, then this publica-

tion is counted for each region that the authors 

represent 

We analysed the publications in the Scopus da-

tabase retrieved by querying for “machine trans-

lation” in title, abstract, and keywords. Figure 1 

shows the number of publications for the time pe-

riod from 2000-2017 (7008 in total) clearly 

demonstrating the increase of interest in this topic 

in the first decade of this century and the relatively 

stable number of publications in this decade. 

 

Figure 1 Number of publications for “machine translation” 

(2000-2017) 

When querying for “machine translation” for 

the years 2010-2018, we found 4931 publications, 

4723 of these publications are from the coun-

tries/regions addressed in this study (on July 10, 

2018). Publications on CAT tools were not in-

cluded and analysed in this study, because the 

number of publications on CAT tools alone6  in the 

Scopus DB for 2010-2018 is very small (only 149 

additional publications or about 3% were found).

tabase: top 15 countries (2010-June 2018) 

Figure 2 shows the 15 countries that have the 

highest number of publications for the years 2010-

2018. We can see that the leader is China (854 

publications), followed by the United States (814 

publications), and Japan (403 publications). The 

list of the top 15 countries includes such European 

countries as Spain (293 publications), Germany 

(266 publications), UK (266 publications), Ireland

aly (124 publications), Czech Republic (85 publi-

cations), and the Netherlands (75 publications). 

When the number of publications is compared 

between North America, Asia and Europe, the 

leader is Asia with 1932 publications, followed by 

Europe with 1752 publications and North America 

with 975 publications (Figure 3).

We also analysed conference proceedings from 

ACL, COLING, EACL, NAACL and NIPS7 - five 

important computational linguistics conferences 

by querying for “machine translation”. We found 

more recent (2015-2017) papers from United 

States (68) and China (42), but fewer from Ger-

many (34), United Kingdom (27), Ireland (21) and 

other European countries. While US authors have 

more publications as authors from each single EU 

or Asian country, European countries are still 

leaders, when the regional distribution of publica-

tions are compared.

emergence of start-ups in the respective industry 

across regions, and known implementation of the 

latest technique in each respective area.  

3.1 Market of origin of the translation auto-
mation tools 

Parallel to MT technologies, we have witnessed 

dynamic innovation in computer assisted 

translation (CAT) tools that play a major role in 

automating professional translation. Despite a 

huge improvement in the quality of machine 

translation thanks to the advances in neural MT 

(e.g. Bojar et al., 2018), recent research has shown 

that MT systems are still not able to produce 

translations of sufficient quality at the sentence 

level and even more so on document level.  Often 

machine translation output still requires post-

editing by a human to correct errors and improve 

the quality of the translation (Läubli et al., 2018; 

Hassan et al., 2018; Toral et. al., 2018).  

CAT incorporates this manual editing stage into 

translation software, making translation an inter-

active process between human and computer. 11 

out of the 24 recognized CAT tools that are used 

by the majority of translation companies have 

been developed in Europe.  

3.2 Translation technology start-ups 

Another indicator of innovation is the emergence 

of start-up companies that introduce new 

technologies, innovative ways of addressing 

business needs, and novel business models. For 

this analysis we collected a list of translation 

technology start-ups from AngelList8 – a U.S. 

website for startups and angel investors – and 

assigned their regional attribution based on the 

location of their headquarters. Europe is the leader 

in the number of emerging start-ups (54) closely 

followed by North America (51), leaving Asia in 

a distant third position (28). 

3.3 Adoption of Neural MT 

In recent years, Neural MT (NMT) has become a 

global trend in MT development that has created 

opportunities for new services. Global adoption of 

NMT is led by Google (Wu et al., 2016) and Fa-

cebook but European companies and public sector 

have been quick to follow. In a few months from 

the first release of the Chinese-English NMT by 

Google there were numerous NMT systems 

launched by European companies Tilde (Pinnis et

9https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIG-

ITAL/eTranslation  

al, 2017), KantanMT, SDL, and DeepL. The Eu-

ropean Commission also is on the fast track to 

adopt NMT by replacing the MT@EU statistical 

MT systems with the NMT systems on the eTrans-

lation platform9. 

4 Investments 

Based on data from translation industry research 

by Common Sense Advisory (2017) and the Slator 

2018 Language Service Provider Index (2018),  

Table 3 lists the top 20 global translation 

companies by turnover.  Nearly all the top 20 are 

investing in MT by either developing their own or 

buying existing MT service providers.  Many have 

the latest NMT technologies illustrating how very 

important cutting-edge technologies are in the 

language services sector.

5 Market Dominance 

Market dominance is defined as a measure of the 

strength of a brand, product, service, or firm, 

relative to competitive offerings, including the 

extent a product, brand, or firm controls a product 

category in a given geographic area.  We analysed 

the market dominance in all three regions by 

comparing total web traffic (e.g. number of times 

a unique IP address has opened the webpage of the 

said company) received by the dedicated web 

domains of the largest providers of MT services. 

Based on this analysis, North America clearly 

dominates the market in terms of attracting 

customers to their services. With their relatively 

few companies, but clearly dominating presence 

and market penetration, the Asian MT companies 

are snapping at the heels of the North American 

companies. There is a greater number of European 

companies, but their market presence is more 

fragmented resulting in a weaker market position. 

As the largest MT companies (with their re-

spective brands and services) are headquartered in 

the US, the MT landscape is dominated by North 

American providers. The North American MT in-

dustry clearly outperforms European and also 

Asian businesses in terms of their market power 

and dominance. North American MT providers 

also have strong market position in Asia and Eu-

rope. In Asian markets they face strong local com-

petition from Baidu, Tencent, Sogou and others. 

The global MT market has a very high degree 

of concentration – 20% of the market players11 ac-

count for more than 80% of the revenue.  A ma-

jority of companies earn on MT less than a million 

euros annually, indicating that MT market is un-

derdeveloped overall and even more so in the mar-

kets outside North America.  

According to TAUS estimations (TAUS, 2017), 

more than 40% of the global MT market is domi-

nated by “a small set of very big “Internet” com-

panies including Google, Amazon, Microsoft, 

Yandex, Facebook and Baidu, who offer free MT 

service either to all-comers or to their global cus-

tomers (Amazon), and/or in certain cases a paying 

service to enterprises and other large-scale users”. 

                                                 
11 “mix of big Internet, pure-play MT and Large LSP/MLV 

companies such as Google, Systran, Microsoft, SDL” 

(TAUS, 2017) 

As a result of the dominance by large players 

both in B2B and B2C markets, smaller MT devel-

opers and service providers including a majority 

of European based companies face challenges in 

gaining market visibility and increasing their 

brand awareness. 

Free online MT as a service, e.g. Google Trans-

late, freetranslation.com (powered by Microsoft), 

Reverso, has a major impact on the MT market.  

In terms of the perceived value – MT services 

have been commoditized, even devalued, with a 

concurrent strong impact on the perceived quality 

expectations by both individual consumers as well 

as businesses. “Large players such as Google, Mi-

crosoft and Apple have some positive effects, as 

they strongly contribute to create or increase mar-

ket awareness. On the other hand, they are tough 

competitors as they offer mass market free soft-

ware which is difficult to compete with, especially 

for SMEs.”12 

6 Industry 

Industry in the context of this study is defined as 

the commercial machine translation product 

developers and service providers. 

The criteria for measuring the Industry dimen-

sion is the market capitalization and estimates of 

market revenues of the companies that can be 

identified as being engaged in language services 

and specifically in MT development and imple-

mentation (Table 4).

Table 4 shows the impact of MT on the global 

economy, by highlighting that 7 of the largest 8 

companies by market cap have a notable presence 

in this technology sector. In addition, comparing 

independent estimations, we can assume that the 

global MT market in 2017 was worth $300m – 

$350m with an annual growth rate close to 20%.  

According to the IDC study13, the estimated Eu-

ropean market for translation technologies is EUR 

67m ($78.3m). This would lead to an estimation 

of the share for European MT market in a range of 

22%-26% or about a quarter of the global market. 

7 Infrastructure 

Europe is lagging behind other global economic 

powers in providing computing power for 

computing intensive applications such as MT. 

Although Europe consumes 29% of global HPC 

resources it supplies less than 5% of them. 

According to estimations by the European 

Commission, Europe needs to invest close to 

$800bn in its digital infrastructure to catch up with 

the United States and China.14 Although this esti-

mate includes investments in fibber-optics net-

works, 5G networks and other ICT infrastructure, 

a substantial part of these investments is needed to 

meet European demand for high performance 

computing power.  

8 Data for Machine Translation 

Availability of data is crucial as almost all 

contemporary machine translation systems are 

based on data-driven techniques.   

As indicators for data availability, we analysed 

the availability of open data, access to proprietary 

data resources, and legal regulations of data us-

age. Europe outperforms North America and Asia 

in terms of developed and freely accessible lan-

guage resources that play an essential role in the 

development of machine translation systems.  

EU institutions have released massive volumes 

of freely available language resources that contain 

data for more than 24 EU languages and exceed 5 

billion words. The European Open Data Portal15 

provides access to diverse language resources. It 

also contains a dedicated repository of public sec-

tor language resources for MT created and popu-

lated by the European Language Resource Coor-

dination Action16, funded by the EU Connecting 

Europe Facility programme (Lösch et al., 2018).

14 https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-digitalization-

oettinger-idUSKCN1174M9?il=0  

In North America and Asia open data initiatives 

have been primarily concerned with structured 

data from registers and databases as well as ma-

chine generated data mostly in numerical format. 

Open data repositories in North America and Asia 

(e.g. US Government open data, Japan govern-

ment open data portal) provide only few if any 

language resource. 

In regard to proprietary data and user generated 

content, global online US and Asia companies 

have a strong advantage versus European players. 

Global dominance of companies like Facebook, 

Google, and Amazon in their primary business ac-

tivities in the fields of social media, internet 

search and e-commerce allow them to harvest un-

matchable amounts of data that they can use in 

other areas of their activities like MT. 

This is also true for Chinese firms like Alibaba 

and Tencent, which have become similarly domi-

nant in their home market (Giles, 2018). 

European copyright regulation is much more 

restrictive for data usage comparing to the United 

States.  Lack of the fair use principle makes huge 

volumes of copyright protected data unavailable 

for use by European researchers and machine 

translation developers (Hugenholtz, 2013; Von 

Lohmann, 2017). At the same time US businesses 

and research institutions reap an advantage by ap-

plying the fair use exception and using this data.
