Background

§ With broad reach comes great expectations. 
§ The publishing requirements for most organizations ballooned as online channels 

dominated their outreach. 
§ Everyone expects an all-you-can-eat buffet of information in a form they can readily 

consume on demand − on computers, mobile devices of any sort, smart TVs, Alexa, and car 
dashboards – wherever and however they need it. And most expect to receive in in their 
language(s). 

§ Organizations struggle with the practicalities tied to this newfound role as a publisher of 
multilingual content as they deal with a dozen strategic languages, consider a hundred long-
tail markets, and ponder what to do with the massive volumes of content their organizations 
generate every day. We talk with and advise many of these “accidental publishers” who are 
in the process of defining, renovating, or expanding their global content strategies.

Business challenge

§ This presentation addresses the business challenge of how commercial 
enterprises and government agencies meet that expectation for locally 
digestible content using their available but frequently limited resources. 

§ As they develop their global content strategies, they encounter conflicting 
agendas and mandates: 
– An internal requirement for absolute linguistic quality in all publications
– Arguably usable and ever improving automated translation
– The reality of declining information consumer expectations for language perfection

Agenda

In the presentation, based on more than a decade of independent research 

and analysis on machine translation, CSA Research discusses and analyzes: 

1. How non-publishing organizations became accidental publishers

2. Global content tiering strategies that involve human, machine, and 

comingled translation modalities

3. How those strategies will be affected by advances in machine translation 

and supporting technologies

4. Lowered expectations for language quality among information consumers

5. How these phenomena intersect with traditional and evolving quality 

metrics.
