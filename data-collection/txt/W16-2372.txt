Abstract

Comparable corpora have been shown to
be useful in several multilingual natural
language processing (NLP) tasks. Many
previous papers have focused on how to
improve the extraction of parallel data
from this kind of corpus on different lev-
els. In this paper, we are interested in im-
proving the quality of bilingual compara-
ble corpora according to increased docu-
ment alignment score. We describe our
participation in the bilingual document
alignment shared task of the First Confer-
ence on Machine Translation (WMT16).
We propose a technique based on source-
to-target sentence- and word-based scores
and the fraction of matched source named
entities. We performed our experiments on
English-to-French document alignments
for this bilingual task.

1 Introduction

Parallel corpora (or “bitexts”), comprising bilin-
gual/multilingual texts extracted from parallel
documents, are crucial resources for building SMT
systems. Unfortunately, parallel documents are
a scarce resource for many language pairs with
the exception of English, French, Spanish, Arabic,
Chinese and some European languages included in
Europarl1 (Koehn, 2005) and OPUS (Tiedemann,
2012).2 Furthermore, these existing available cor-
pora do not cover some special domains or sub-
domains.

For the field of SMT, this can be problematic,
because MT systems trained on data from a spe-
cific domain (e.g. parliamentary proceedings) per-
form poorly when applied to other domains, e.g.

1http://www.statmt.org/europarl/
2http://opus.lingfil.uu.se/

sports news articles. As a result, the area of do-
main adaptation has been a hot topic in MT over
the past few years.

One way to overcome this lack of data is to ex-
ploit comparable corpora which are much more
easily available (Munteanu and Marcu, 2005). A
comparable corpus is a collection of texts com-
posed independently in their respective languages
and combined on the basis of similarity of con-
tent. These are bilingual/multilingual documents
that are comparable in content and form to various
degrees and dimensions. Potential sources of tex-
tual comparable corpora are the output from multi-
lingual news organizations such as Agence France
Presse (AFP), Xinhua, Reuters, CNN, BBC, etc.
These texts are widely available on the Web for
many language pairs (Resnik and Smith, 2003).
Another example is Euronews, which proposes
news text in several languages clustered by do-
main (e.g. sports, finance, etc.). The degree of
parallelism can vary considerably, from noisy par-
allel texts, to ‘quasi parallel’ texts (Fung and Che-
ung, 2004).

No matter what data we are dealing with, if
we want to automatically create large amounts of
parallel documents for SMT training, the ability
to detect parallel sentences or sub-sentences con-
tained in these kinds of comparable corpus is cru-
cial. However, for some specific domains, such
as news, the problem of document alignment can
drastically reduce the quantity of the final paral-
lel data extracted. For example, Afli et al. (2012)
showed that they were able to extract only 20% of
an expected 1.9M-token parallel sentence collec-
tion using their automatic parallel data extraction
method. For this reason, they tried to improve this
method by exploiting parallel phrases (i.e. not just
parallel sentences) which increased the quantity of
extracted data (Afli et al., 2013, 2016).

However, the precision of such automatic meth-

717



ods is still much less than expected. We con-
tend that the main problem comes from the doc-
ument alignment of such comparable corpora.
One of the challenges of our research is to build
data and techniques for some under-resourced do-
mains. We propose to investigate the improvement
of alignment of bilingual comparable documents
in order to solve this problem.

Accordingly, in this paper we describe an ex-
perimental framework designed to address a situa-
tion when we have large quantities of non-aligned
parallel or comparable documents in different lan-
guages that we need to exploit. Our document
alignment methods are based on a new scoring
technique for parallel document detection based
on the word-length and sentence-length ratio and
named entity recognition (NER).

Apart from this, we also compared the total
number of source and target named entities (NEs)
so that they should not differ significantly which
can play a major role in determining the compara-
bility of two texts.

The remainder of the paper is structured as fol-
lows. The related work on parallel data extraction
and comparability measures is briefly discussed in
Section 2. In Section 3, we detail our proposed
method and provide the results of our experiments
on WMT-2016 data in Section 4. In Section 5,
we present the conclusion and directions for future
work.

2 Related work

In the “Big Data” world that we now live in, it
is widely believed that there is no better data
than more data (e.g. Mayer-Schönberger and
Cukier (2013)). In line with this idea, a con-
siderable amount of work has taken place in
the NLP community on discovering parallel sen-
tences/fragments in a comparable corpus in or-
der to augment existing parallel data collections.
However, the extensive literature related to the
problem of exploiting comparable corpora takes a
somewhat different perspective than we do in this
paper.

Typically, comparable corpora do not have any
information regarding document-pair similarity.
They are made of many documents in one lan-
guage which do not have any corresponding trans-
lated document in the other language. Further-
more, when the documents are paired, they are
not literal translations of each other. Thus, ex-

tracting parallel data from such corpora requires
special algorithms. Many papers use the Web as a
comparable corpus. An adaptive approach, pro-
posed by Zhao and Vogel (2002), aims at min-
ing parallel sentences from a bilingual compara-
ble news collection collected from the Web. A
maximum likelihood criterion was used by com-
bining sentence-length models with lexicon-based
models. The translation lexicon is iteratively up-
dated using the mined parallel data to obtain bet-
ter vocabulary coverage and translation probabil-
ity estimation. Resnik and Smith (2003) pro-
pose a web-mining-based system called STRAND
and show that their approach is able to find large
numbers of similar document pairs. Yang and
Li (2003) present an alignment method at differ-
ent levels (title, word and character) based on dy-
namic programming (DP). The goal is to iden-
tify one-to-one title pairs in an English–Chinese
corpus collected from the Web. They apply the
longest common sub-sequence to find the most
reliable Chinese translation of an English word.
One of the main methods relies on cross-lingual
information retrieval (CLIR), with different tech-
niques for transferring the request into the target
language (using a bilingual dictionary or a full
SMT system). Utiyama and Isahara (2003) use
CLIR techniques and DP to extract sentences from
an English–Japanese comparable corpus. They
identify similar article pairs, and having consid-
ered them as parallel texts, then align sentences
using a sentence-pair similarity score and use DP
to find the least-cost alignment over the document
pair. Munteanu and Marcu (2005) use a bilin-
gual lexicon to translate some of the words of the
source sentence. These translations are then used
to query the database to find matching translations
using IR techniques. There have been only a few
studies trying to investigate the formal quantifi-
cation of how similar two comparable documents
are. Li and Gaussier (2010) presented one of the
first works on developing a comparability mea-
sure based on the expectation of finding translation
word pairs in the corpus. Our approach follows
this line of work based on a method developed by
Sennrich and Volk (2010).

3 Aligning comparable documents

3.1 Processing the comparable documents
In this work, experiments are conducted on the
test data3 provided by the WMT-2016 organiz-
ers, which comprised 203 web domains with more
than 1 million documents in total. The data is pro-
vided in .lett format with following fields, 1) Lan-
guage ID, 2) MIME type, 3) Encoding, 4) URL,
5) Complete content in Base64 encoding and 6)
Main textual content in Base64 encoding. We ex-
tracted URLs and texts from this collection of data
and converted them into UTF-8 format.

3.2 Basic Idea

Figure 1: Architecture of comparable alignment
system

In this work we propose an extension of the
method described in Sennrich and Volk (2010).
The basic system architecture is described in Fig-
ure 1. We begin by removing those documents
that have very little contents in order to avoid all
possible comparisons. Subsequently, we introduce
three steps: sentence-based scoring, word-based
scoring and NE-based scoring. Finally we used
a combined weighted score of the three scores to
select the target document with highest value.

3.3 Sentence-based scoring
Since there are a large number of source and tar-
get documents, there are billions of possible com-

3http://www.statmt.org/wmt16/
bilingual-task.html

parisons required to complete the calculations of
finding possible document alignments. Therefore,
we have to restrict the comparison calculations
only to those source-target text pairs that have
a close sentence-length ratio, otherwise they are
less likely to be comparable texts. This is neces-
sary since comparing each source with each target
text would result in an undesirably large number
of comparisons and thus a very long time to pro-
cess all steps even for a single domain. Let us as-
sume that Ss and St are the number of sentences in
the source and target texts, respectively. We then
follow a very simple formula to calculate source-
target sentence-length ratio(RSL), as in (1) :

RSL =
min(Ss, St)

max(Ss, St)
(1)

We construct this equation in order to confine
the value between 0 and 1 which implies that if
either of the source or target text contains no sen-
tences, RSL will be 0, and 1 if they have the same
number of sentences. Therefore, a value of 1 or
even very close to it has a positive indication to-
wards being comparable but this is not the only re-
quirement, as there are many documents with the
same (or very similar) number of sentences. For
this reason, we consider word and NE-based scor-
ing in Sections 3.4 and 3.5, respectively.

3.4 Word-based scoring

The reason behind this step is very similar to the
step discussed in Section 3.3, but here it is based
on word-length comparison. Let us assume that
Ws and Wt are the number of words in the source
and target texts, respectively. Hence our equa-
tion for calculating source-target word-length ratio
(RWL) is (2):

RWL =
min(Ws,Wt)

max(Ws,Wt)
(2)

3.5 NE-based scoring

Having studies the comparable documents from a
linguistic point of view, it appeared that looking
for NEs present in both source and target texts
might be a good way to select the 1-best target
document. We extracted NEs from all the doc-
uments to be compared. Let us assume that the
number of NEs in a source text and in a target text
are NES and NET , respectively. Initially we cal-
culate source-target NE-length ratio (RNL) as in
(3):

719



RNL =
min(NES , NET )

max(NES , NET )
(3)

Then we calculated the ratio of the total number
of source-target NE matches to the total number
of source NEs, which we call RSNM . Let us
assume that the total number of NEs matched is
MNE . Considering this, RSNM can be calculated
as shown in (4):

RSNM =
MNE
NES

(4)

In many cases a text-pair in a comparison can
have a huge difference between the number of NEs
present in both documents. For example, if NES
and NET are 5 and 50, respectively, and all of
the source NEs match the target NEs, we might
not necessarily want to link them. Accordingly,
therefore, (3) is also taken into account, and we
multiply RSNM by RNLto give our overall NE-
based score(SCNE) in (5) :

SCNE = RSNM ∗RNL (5)

3.6 Combining all scores
We propose to re-rank our possible alignments
based on adding sentence-, word- and NE-based
scores and call this our alignment-score (SCA), as
in (6) :

SCA = RSL +RWL + SCNE (6)

Using equation (6), we calculate scores for each
possible document pair and retain the 1-best pair
with the maximum value.

4 Experimental results

4.1 Data and systems
In order to test our proposed techniques we
conducted experiments on the provided develop-
ment data and corresponding references. As dis-
cussed in Sections 3.4 and 3.5, we selected only
those document pairs for comparison that have
a sentence-length and word-length ratio of 1 (or
very close to it).

It is usually seen that on average a French trans-
lation of an English document has 1.2 words for
every English word in the original. In this work,
since we are dealing with the comparable texts that
are usually not proper translations of each other
but contain similar information, we choose to set
this ratio closer to 1.

In addition to this, we applied different
weighted scores for the three features (i.e.
sentence-based, word-based and NE-based scor-
ing). The weights applied on the test data were
extracted from our experiments on the develop-
ment data. We held out the documents randomly
selected from 10 web-domains in the training data.
We assigned different sets of weights to the three
features and conducted experiments on the devel-
opment set using these weighted scores.

The Stanford Named Entity Recognizer4 was
used to detect NEs in our system.

4.2 Results

We assigned weights to the three features in five
different combinations (termed as Cn, where n=1,
2 . . . 5) as shown in Table 1. The summation of
these weights is always 1.

Feature Weight assigned
C1 C2 C3 C4 C5

RSL 0.33 0.25 0.15 0.1 0

RWL 0.33 0.25 0.15 0.1 0

SCNE 0.33 0.5 0.7 0.8 1

Table 1: Weights assigned to different features
with different combinations.

As can be seen in Table 1, C1 represents the
combination where all features are assigned an
equal score. Subsequently, the weights ofRSL and
RWL are decreased but for SCNE it is increased.
C5 indicates that the whole weight is assigned to
SCNE whereas RSL and RWL are not taken into
account. Let us assume that the weights assigned
to the sentence-based, word-based and NE-based
features are λ1, λ2 and λ3, respectively. Taking
these weights into account, the overall alignment
score of a document-pair is calculated as shown in
equation (7):

SCA = λ1RSL + λ2RWL + λ3SCNE (7)

where, λ1 + λ2 + λ3 = 1
The experimental results on the development

data with different scoring combinations are given
in Table 2.

combinations. Prior to tuning the feature weights

the test data was based on simple addition of the
three features we used. The result is published on
the basis of recall and contains 2,402 alignment
pairs. We extended the published results with the
precision values which is shown in Table 4.

Subsequently, we tuned the feature weights in
the development phase and selected the weight
combination C3 to apply on the test data. Table
5 shows the results.

It can be observed from Table 5 that applying
the tuned feature weights helps in increasing the
recall value by up to 2% compared to our initial
results (‘ADAPT’ in Table 4). The precision value
is also slightly increased from 1.05% (in ADAPT-
2) to 1.1%. However, in both Table 4 and Table
5, it is obvious that both of our systems produced
much lower recall value than the top-ranked sys-
tems (e.g. NovaLincs, UEdin1_cosine etc.). In
contrast, our precision is quite competitive to these
systems and higher than most of the submitted sys-
tems.

Another very important observation is that our
results on the development data are much better
than on the test data. The main reason for this is

that we strictly pruned out many of the possible
comparisons for the web-domains in the test set
having a large number of texts in order to reduce
the runtime of the whole process. It would have
consumed a lot of time if we had considered all the
documents (i.e. more than one million document
pairs). Therefore, we removed those documents
that contain only a few lines of text which resulted
in discarding many possible alignments. In con-
trast, we applied a much softer pruning technique
on the development data and produced much bet-
ter recall values than that on the test data.

Finally, analysing the source of the problem of
misalignments, we found that in our data we have
many articles that deal with similar topics in dif-

721



ferent documents. Hence it may not always be
helpful to rely mostly on NE-matching.

5 Conclusion

Despite the fact that phrase-based models of trans-
lation obtain state-of-the-art performance, suffi-
cient amounts of good quality training data do not
exist for many language pairs. Even for those
language pairs where large amounts of data are
available, these do not always occur in the re-
quired domain of application. Accordingly, many
researchers have investigated the use of compara-
ble corpora either to generate initial training data
for SMT engines, or to supplement what data is
already available.

In this paper, we seek to improve the qual-
ity of the multilingual comparable documents re-
trieved. In our approach, we actually quantify the
amount of correct target-language documents re-
trieved. Here we propose a technique combining
three features. The first one is based on matched
source-to-target sentence scoring, the second on
matched source-to-target sentence scoring and the
third on NE-based scoring.

Analysing this result, in future work we would
like to add more semantic features to our sys-
tem and apply these techniques to other lan-
guage pairs and data types. In addition to this,
we would also like to automatically determine
the weighted scores, for instance by using n-fold
cross-validation. Our proposed method does not
consider the difference between translation ratio of
languages as we are dealing with different quali-
ties of comparable corpora in this task, but we plan
to investigate this problem with a specific corpus
in different languages for our future work.
