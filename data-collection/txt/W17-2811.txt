Abstract

Recognition of social signals, from human
facial expressions or prosody of speech, is
a popular research topic in human-robot
interaction studies. There is also a long
line of research in the spoken dialogue
community that investigates user satisfac-
tion in relation to dialogue characteris-
tics. However, very little research relates
a combination of multimodal social sig-
nals and language features detected during
spoken face-to-face human-robot interac-
tion to the resulting user perception of a
robot. In this paper we show how dif-
ferent emotional facial expressions of hu-
man users, in combination with prosodic
characteristics of human speech and fea-
tures of human-robot dialogue, correlate
with users’ impressions of the robot af-
ter a conversation. We find that happi-
ness in the user’s recognised facial ex-
pression strongly correlates with likeabil-
ity of a robot, while dialogue-related fea-
tures (such as number of human turns or
number of sentences per robot utterance)
correlate with perceiving a robot as in-
telligent. In addition, we show that fa-
cial expression, emotional features, and
prosody are better predictors of human rat-
ings related to perceived robot likeability
and anthropomorphism, while linguistic
and non-linguistic features more often pre-
dict perceived robot intelligence and inter-
pretability. As such, these characteristics
may in future be used as an online reward
signal for in-situ Reinforcement Learning-
based adaptive human-robot dialogue sys-
tems.

1 Introduction

Social signals, such as emotional expressions, play
an important role in human-human interaction,
thus they are increasingly recognised as an impor-
tant factor to be considered both in human-robot
interaction research (Cid et al., 2013; Novikova
et al., 2015; Devillers et al., 2015) and in the area
of spoken dialogue systems (Herm et al., 2008;
Meena et al., 2015).

Recognition of human social signals has be-
come a popular topic in Human-Robot Interac-
tion (HRI) in recent years. Social signals are rec-
ognized well from human facial expressions or
prosodic features of speech (Ekman, 2004; Zeng
et al., 2009), and have become the most popular
methods for recognising human affective signals
in human-robot interaction (Rázuri et al., 2015;
Devillers et al., 2015; Cid et al., 2013).

In human-robot interaction, recognized human
emotions are mostly used for mimicking human
behaviour and enhancing the empathy towards a
robot both in children (Tielman et al., 2014) and

86



in adult users (Tapus and Mataric, 2007).
In the area of spoken dialogue systems, sig-

nals recognised from linguistic cues and prosody
have been used to detect problematic dialogues
(Herm et al., 2008) and to assess dialogue qual-
ity as a whole (Schmitt and Ultes, 2015). This
type of dialogue-related signals has also been
used to automatically detect miscommunication
(Meena et al., 2015), or to predict the user satis-
faction (Schmitt et al., 2011).

However, there is very little research combining
the areas of detecting multi-modal signals during
spoken HRI and evaluation of human-robot con-
versation, and using them to create an adaptive so-
cial dialogue.

In this paper, we make a first step towards
building a multi-modally-rich, conversational, and
human-like robotic agent, potentially able to react
to the changes in human behaviour during face-to-
face dialogue and able to adjust the dialogue strat-
egy in order to improve an interlocutor’s impres-
sion. We present a setup that targets the develop-
ment of a dialogue system to explore verbal and
non-verbal conversational cues in a face-to-face
situated dialogue with a social robot. We show that
different emotional facial expressions of a human
interlocutor, in combination with prosodic charac-
teristics of human speech and features of human-
robot dialogue, correlate strongly with users’ per-
ceptions of a robot after a conversation. Based on
these features, we developed a model capable of
predicting potential human ratings of a robot and
discuss its implications for future work in devel-
oping adaptive human-robot dialogue systems.

2 Experiment Setup and Evaluation

The human-robot dialogue system was evaluated
via a user study in which human subjects inter-
acted with a Pepper robot1 acting autonomously
using the system described in (Papaioannou and
Lemon, 2017; Papaioannou et al., 2017). The
dialogue system used, combines task-based with
chat-based dialogue features, deciding the most
appropriate action on each consequent turns, using
a pre-trained Reinforcement Learning (RL) pol-
icy. The robot decides among a pool of possi-
ble actions at ∈ A where A = [PerformTask,
Greet, Goodbye, Chat, GiveDirections, Wait, Re-
questTask, RequestShop]. If a task is recognised

1http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-5/home_
pepper.html

in the user utterance (e.g. ”where can I find dis-
counts”), a response is synthesized using database
lookup and predefined utterances (like the exam-
ple shown in Table 3). If no task was recognised,
then the user request is being forwarded to a Chat-
bot, written in AIML and based on the chatbot
Rosie2, where a chat-style response is formulated
based on AIML template/ pattern matching.

All interactions were in English. The physical
setup of the experiment can be seen in Figure 1.

2.1 Experimental Scenario

The task and the setup chosen in the study were
considered as first steps towards understanding
how a humanoid social robot should behave in the
context of a shopping mall while also providing
useful information to the mall’s visitors. To this
end, participants were asked to imagine that they
were entering a shopping mall they had never been
to before where the robot was installed in the entry
area interacting with visitors one at a time. Partic-
ipants were asked to complete as many as possible
of the following five tasks:

• Get information from the robot on where to
get a coffee.

• Get information from the robot on where to
buy clothes.

• Get the directions to the clothing shop of their
choice.

• Find out if there are any current sales or dis-
counts in the shopping mall and try to get a
voucher from the robot.

• Make a selfie with the robot.

Instructions were given to use natural language
spontaneously while interacting with the robot.

2.2 Participants and Experimental Design

41 people (13 females, 28 males) participated in
our study, ranging in age from 18 to 38 (M=24.46,
SD=4.72). The majority of them were students
(93% students and 7% staff) that had no or little
previous experience with robots (56% with little
or no experience, 39% with some experience, and
5% with a lot of experience).

Participants were initially given a briefing script
describing the goal of the task and providing hints

on how to better communicate with the robot, e.g.
“wait for your turn to speak” and “please keep in
mind that the robot only listens to you while its
eyes are blinking blue”3. We reassured our par-
ticipants that we were testing the robot, not them,
and controlled environment-introduced biases by
avoiding non-task-related distractions during the
experiment. During experimental sessions, partic-
ipants stood in front of the robot and the experi-
menter was hidden in another corner of the room
but available in case the participant would need
any help (see Figure 1).

At the end of the experiment participants were
debriefed and received a £10 gift voucher. The
duration of each session did not exceed thirty min-
utes.

2.3 Measured Variables

We collected a range of objective measures from
the log files, video and audio recordings of the in-
teractions, and transcripts of dialogues. From the
audio recordings, we collected a set of different
prosodic and dialogue-related features. From the
video recordings, we collected the data on emo-
tional intensities detected based on human facial
expressions. From the dialogue transcripts, we
collected a set of linguistic features, such as lex-
ical diversity, length of utterance etc.

In addition, we considered a range of subjec-
tive measures for a qualitative evaluation. For that,
after each interaction session participants were
asked to fill in a questionnaire to assess their per-
ception of the robot.

Emotions were detected and recognised using
the Microsoft Emotion API for Video4. This API
takes video frames as an input (see Figure 2), and
returns the confidence across a set of emotions for
the group of faces in the image over a period of
time. The emotions detected are happiness, sad-
ness, surprise, anger, fear, contempt, disgust, or
neutral. Happiness, surprise, and sadness were se-
lected for analysis in this work, because they had
the highest average or maximum values across all
recorded videos.

Prosodic Features used in this work are the fol-
lowing: average fundamental frequency of speech
F0, maximum F0, and difference between maxi-
mum and minimum F0 values.

ing.

ing a dialogue with the robot.

Non-linguistic Dialogue Features used in this
work contain speech duration (in sec), number of
turns, number of completed tasks, number of self-
repetitions and a ratio of tasks per turn.

Linguistic Dialogue Features used in this work
consist of utterance length (in characters), a ratio
of words per utterance and unique words per ut-
terance, number of sentences within an utterance,
lexical diversity, a ratio of words per sentence and
a ratio of unique words per sentence.

Perception of Robot was assessed using re-
sponses on the questionnaire filled by participants
at the end of each interaction session. The ques-
tionnaire was based on a combination of the User
Experience Questionnaire UEQ (Laugwitz et al.,
2008) and the Godspeed Questionnaire (Bartneck
et al., 2009). It consisted of 21 pairs of contrasting
characteristics that may apply to the robot, and are
grouped into four groups of Anthropomorphism,
Likeability, Perceived Intelligence, and User Ex-
pectations. The Anthropomorphism group con-
sists of the following pairs of characteristics: fake
– natural, machinelike – humanlike, unconscious –
conscious, artificial – lifelike. Likeability consists
of: unfriendly – friendly, unkind – kind, unpleas-
ant – pleasant, awful – nice, annoying – enjoyable,
disliked – liked. The group of Perceived Intelli-
gence consists of: incompetent – competent, igno-
rant – knowledgeable, irresponsive – responsive,
unintelligent – intelligent, foolish – sensible. The
Interpretability group consists of: does not meet
expectations – meets expectations, obstructive –
supportive, unpredictable – predictable, confusing
– clear, complicated – easy, not understandable –
understandable. Users were asked to evaluate per-
ception of a robot on a 5-point Likert scale, where
the minimum value was 1 and the maximum was
5.

The validity of the used questionnaire was
tested by measuring its internal consistency with
Cronbach’s α, which was equal to 0.93 (high con-

synchronising different streams of data, and col-
lecting corresponding parts of data for analysis.

sistency). Based on the high value of the Cron-
bach’s α, we assume that that our participants in
the given context interpreted the robot characteris-
tics, provided in the questionnaire, in an expected
way.

3 Multimodal Data Collection and
Analysis

Data collected during the experiment required ad-
ditional processing, alignment and annotation, as
shown in Figure 3. Prosodic features of F0, and
dialogue-related features showing presence and
absence of pauses and presence/absence of speech
were collected from audio recordings with a rate
of 44100 samples per second. Values of emotional
intensities were collected from video recordings
with a rate of 25 frames per seconds. All the data
was aligned after recording, using average val-
ues of prosodic features per frame. Afterwards,
data was annotated in ELAN5 detecting associa-
tions between an utterance and its owners. Finally,
the dialogue texts were transcribed and linguistic
features were calculated using R packages stringr,
stringi, tidytext, and qdap.

A summary of collected data is provided in Ta-
ble 1. Specifically, the summary results show
that the F0 value of human speech changes a lot
during the conversation, with a maximum value
being more than twice as large as an average
value. Average emotional intensities of surprise
and sadness, on the other hand, do not differ much

(±0.001), and the maximum values of all the emo-
tional intensities are usually close to 1.

Results of non-linguistic dialogue-related fea-
tures show that the robot on average speaks sig-
nificantly longer than humans during a dialogue.
Humans tend to have a higher number of turns,
although they less frequently repeat themselves.
These differences, however, are not significant.

Results of linguistic features reveal more sig-
nificant differences between robot and human lan-
guage. For example, the results show that hu-
mans on average speak in significantly shorter ut-
terances compared to a robot, both in terms of a
number of characters and a number of words per
utterance. The robot uses more sentences per ut-
terance on average, although this difference is not
significant. The lexical diversity, which was calcu-
lated as a ratio of unique words and a total number
of words in an utterance, shows a slightly higher
value in human language rather than robot’s.

Values of linguistic features differ significantly
between human and robot language, which leads
us to investigate in more details the textual dia-
logue data in terms of lexical variety and syntactic
complexity.

dialogue textual data in terms of length of ut-

terances, lexical richness, and syntactic variation.
The results are summarised in Tables 1 and 2 and
grouped by a speaker, i.e. robot and human.

4.1 Length of utterances

Results presented in Table 1 show that robot utter-
ances are significantly longer than those of their
human interlocutors, both in terms of words per
utterance and sentences per utterance. This may
be partly explained by the fact that a turn-taking
process was not very natural and thus was not al-
ways successful during the dialogue. It usually
took some time for people to learn how to com-
municate with Pepper properly and to start speak-
ing to the robot only when it was listening. As a
result, from time to time people were interrupted
by the robot, while they never tried to interrupt
the robot themselves. Shorter average length of
human utterances is also caused by the way peo-
ple tend to deal with disfluencies of a dialogue,
e.g. rephrasing and shortening their previous ut-
terance in order to emphasise the most important
keywords (see an example in Table 3). The robot
utterances, on the other hand, were not shortened
or changed in any other way in the case of dialogue
disfluencies.

HUMAN (H): By the way, I’m a student so
I don’t have a lot of money. So, is it
possible to have some shop with sales or
discounts? [30 words]

ROBOT (R): Who, specifically, does? [dia-
logue disfluency]

H: To have some discounts somewhere. [5
words]

R: There are 2 shops that have sales nearby.
These are Tesco, and Phone Heaven.

H: Thank you very much.

dialogue disfluency.

trigrams in human and robot language.

4.2 Lexical Richness

We used the Lexical Complexity Analyser (Lu,
2009) to measure various dimensions of lexical
richness, such as lexical sophistication, lexical di-
versity and mean segmental type-token ratio. We
complement the traditional measure of lexical di-
versity type-token ratio (TTR) with the more ro-
bust measure of mean segmental type-token ratio
(MSTTR) (Lu, 2012), which divides all the dia-
logues into successive segments of a given length
and then calculates the average TTR of all seg-
ments. The higher the value of MSTTR, the more
diverse is the measured text. We also measure
lexical sophistication (LS), also known as lexical
rareness, which is calculated as the proportion of
lexical word types not on the list of 2,000 most fre-
quent words generated from the British National
Corpus. In addition, we measure lexical diversity
(LD) as a ratio of unique and total words per utter-
ance.

The results presented in Table 2 show that
human utterances, although being significantly
shorter, are significantly richer than those of the
robot, both in terms of lexical diversity and lexical
sophistication. MSTTR values do not differ signif-
icantly between human and robot utterances. This
leads us to investigate the distribution of frequen-
cies of bigrams and trigrams in human and robot
utterances during dialogues.

The majority of both robot (61%) and human
(62%) bigrams are only used once in all the dia-
logues. However, the mean frequency of bigrams

90

and robot language.

that were used more than once during dialogues is
significantly (p< 0.001) higher in robot utterances
(Mean = 15.8, SD = 31.4) compared to human ut-
terances (Mean = 6.1, SD = 8.4). This means that
the robot tends to use the same combinations of
words repeatedly, while people do vary their lan-
guage more. The majority of trigrams is also used
just once by both people and the robot, although
the proportion is quite different: 75% of human
trigrams and only 65% of robot trigrams are used
once in the dialogues. Those trigrams that are used
more than once, have an average frequency of 15.8
(SD = 30.9) for robot, and only 4.4 (SD = 4.6) for
human utterances.

The results of bigrams and trigrams analysis
support the conclusion that human language in
human-robot conversations is more rich, varied,
and diverse than that of the robot. Figure 4 shows
that poor lexical variation of a robot language is
influenced a lot by the fact that the robot often
uses the phrase “I am afraid I cannot help you with
that”, which may be said when the speech recogni-
tion confidence does not reach an adequate thresh-
old, or when no known keywords are detected in
human utterances. As Figure 4 shows, 7 out of
10 most frequent trigrams in a robot language are
variations of that specific phrase.

4.3 Syntactic Variation and Discourse
Phenomena

We used the D-Level Analyser (Lu, 2009) to eval-
uate syntactic variation and complexity of human
references using the revised D-Level Scale (Lu,
2014). The scale has eight levels of syntactic com-
plexity, where levels 0 and 1 include simple or in-
complete sentences and higher levels include sen-
tences with more complex structures.

Figure 5 shows a similar syntactic variation in

human and robot language, although there are
slight differences, e.g. people tend to use a higher
percentage of both the simplest and the most com-
plicated sentences. In general, the majority of all
the sentences, used both by humans and by a robot,
are simple sentences. This is because the topic of a
human-robot conversation is quite simple and does
not require a lot of complicated syntactic struc-
tures.

The results of initial linguistic analysis, together
with results of analysis of multimodal signals, sug-
gest that linguistic, as well as other multimodal
features, may be important in predicting human
perception of a robot. However, average scores
can be misleading, as they only provide a system-
level overview but do not measure the strength
of association with human ratings. This led us
to inspect the correlation between the ratings of
the robot and all the multimodal features of a dia-
logue.

5 Correlation between Robot Ratings
and Multimodal Features of
Human-Robot Dialogue

A summary of correlation results is presented in
Table 4. The results reveal that different groups of
features correlate with different groups of human
ratings. For example, emotional features, such as
intensity of happiness, correlate strongly with per-
ceived anthropomorphism of a robot, so that a per-
son who more strongly expresses happiness during
a dialogue with the robot probably perceives it as
friendlier and nicer. Human ratings of perceived
robot anthropomorphism also correlate with a lex-
ical diversity of human language: people tend to
use more diverse language when speaking to a
robot that they perceive as conscious, natural, and
humanlike (see an example in Table 5).

Average F0 value of human speech correlates
strongly with perceived intelligence of the robot,
specifically with a robot being more knowledge-
able. The ratio of tasks per turn is, unsurpris-
ingly, strongly correlated with perceived robot in-
telligence. The more dialogue turns people need to
complete the same number of tasks, the more they
perceive the robot as ignorant and unintelligent.
Features of robot language also correlate with how
it is perceived: the more words (including unique
ones) per sentence it generates, the more compe-
tent it appears to humans.

It is interesting to notice that some linguistic

and non-linguistic dialogue features correlate with
different human ratings depending on whether the
features are calculated for human or robot lan-
guage. For example, a higher number of human
turns during a dialogue correlates strongly with
a robot being perceived as intelligent and knowl-
edgeable, while a higher number of robot turns
correlates with it being disliked. Longer human
sentences show that a robot is perceived as more
responsive, while longer robot sentences correlate
with a robot being annoying and obstructive.

The results show that some features, observable
during a human-robot dialogue, correlate strongly
and significantly with different groups of human
ratings. However, it is not obvious if a strong cor-
relation also means that there is a causal relation-

ship between human language or multimodal be-
havioural features and ratings of the robot. This
leads us to inspect whether the previously dis-
cussed features may be used for predicting poten-
tial ratings.

6 Predicting Perception of Robots in
Human-Robot Dialogue

In order to develop a model that predicts poten-
tial human ratings on robot likeability and per-
ceived intelligence, we use the previously dis-
cussed prosodic features, dialogue-related char-
acteristics, and detected emotional intensities, as
predictive features of the model. For the predic-
tion itself, we use ensemble learning (Random
Forest, RF) (Breiman, 2001) which is a state-of-

the-art algorithm that can be applied in a dynamic
dialogue situation and is able to combine the re-
spective strengths of different informative features
into a single model.

Setup: We use a 70/30% split for training and
testing and 10-fold cross-validation on the train-
ing data to tune the optimal number of predictors
selected for growing trees. 100 trees were grown
with 2 variables randomly sampled as candidates
at each split. We investigate five different mod-
els used as predictors: 1) emotional intensities, 2)
prosodic features, 3) non-linguistic dialogue fea-
tures, 4) linguistic dialogue features, and 5) all the
features combined.

Results: The results in Table 6 show that dif-
ferent groups of features are better predictors of
different groups of ratings. For example, combin-
ing dialogue-related features only (either linguis-
tic or non-linguistic) as predictors, produces the
lowest root-mean-square error (RMSE) for many
ratings out of the perceived intelligence and intel-
ligibility groups. This means that a combination
of dialogue-related features is producing the best
prediction of such aspects of perceived robot in-
telligence as e.g. responsiveness, intelligence, or
predictability.

Emotional features are shown to be the best
predictors of some aspects of robot likeability
and perceived anthropomorphism. For example,
the ratings for unconscious-conscious, unfriendly-
friendly or awful-nice are best predicted us-
ing emotional features only. Other aspects of
robot anthropomorphism and likeability, such as
machinelike-humanlike or disliked-liked, are best
predicted by using only prosodic features of hu-
man speech as predictors. Combining emotional,
prosodic and dialogue-related features rarely im-
proves the results of rating predictions. In some
cases, e.g. predicting the ratings for unresponsive-
responsive, a combination of all the features pro-

duces the same results as dialogue-related features
alone. In one case a combination of all features
does improve prediction results, this is the rating
showing if the robot meets human expectations or
not. This is probably because human expectations
consist of different aspects themselves: some ex-
pect the robot to be anthropomorphic and likeable,
other prefer it to be intelligent and easily inter-
pretable.

7 Discussion and Conclusions

In this paper, we show how dialogue features cor-
relate with the user’s perception of a robot (e.g.
strong correlation between higher number of hu-
man turns and higher robot’s perceived intellect,
or between higher number of sentences per robot
utterance and robot’s perceived ignorance), as well
as correlations between emotional features and
robot likeability.

Using the findings described in this paper, a pre-
dictive model could be implemented using emo-
tional intensities (happiness, sadness, and sur-
prise) in order to better predict the user’s percep-
tion of the robot. This model can provide valuable
information on how to design more engaging di-
alogues between robots and humans. The combi-
nation of these emotional features, along with the
dialogue-related features (both linguistic and non-
linguistic) and the F0 value can also provide better
feedback in cases where, for instance, a smile can
create ambiguity of the perceived user’s emotional
display (Halpern and Kets, 2012).

In future work, these emotional features com-
ing from real-time facial expression recognition
could be used as an online estimator of how well
or badly a dialogue is progressing, which would
be an important component of a reward signal for
Reinforcement Learning approaches to HRI.
