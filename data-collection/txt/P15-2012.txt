Abstract

This paper describes an experiment to
elicit referring expressions from human
subjects for research in natural language
generation and related fields, and prelim-
inary results of a computational model for
the generation of these expressions. Un-
like existing resources of this kind, the re-
sulting data set - the Zoom corpus of natu-
ral language descriptions of map locations
- takes into account a domain that is sig-
nificantly closer to real-world applications
than what has been considered in previous
work, and addresses more complex situa-
tions of reference, including contexts with
different levels of detail, and instances of
singular and plural reference produced by
speakers of Spanish and Portuguese.

1 Introduction

Referring Expression Generation (REG) is the
computational task of producing adequate natural
language descriptions (e.g., pronouns, definite de-
scriptions, proper names, etc.) of domain entities.
In particular, the issue of how to determine the se-
mantic contents of definite descriptions (e.g., ‘the
Indian restaurant on 5th street’, ‘the restaurant we
went to last night’, etc.) has received significant
attention in the field, and it is also the focus of the
present work.

The input to a REG algorithm is a context set
C containing an intended referent r and a number
of distractor objects. All objects are represented
as attribute-value pairs representing either atomic
(type-restaurant) or relational (on-5thstreet) prop-
erties (Krahmer and Theune, 2002; Krahmer et al.,
2003; Kelleher and Kruijff, 2006; Viethen et al.,
2013). The expected output is a uniquely identi-
fying list L of properties known to be true of r
so that L distinguishes r from all distractors in C
(Dale and Reiter, 1995).

Properties are selected for inclusion in L ac-
cording to multiple - and often conflicting - cri-
teria, including discriminatory power (i.e., the
ability to rule out distractors) as in (Dale, 2002;
Gardent, 2002), domain preferences (Pechmann,
1989; Gatt et al., 2013) and many others. A de-
scription that conveys more information than what
is strictly required for disambiguation is said to
be overspecified (Arts et al., 2011; Koolen et al.,
2011; van Gompel et al., 2012; Engelhardt and
Ferreira, 2006; Engelhardt et al., 2011). For a
review of the research challenges in REG, see
(Krahmer and van Deemter, 2012).

Existing approaches to REG largely consist of
algorithmic solutions, many of which have been
influenced by, or adapted from, the Dale & Reiter
Incremental algorithm in (Dale and Reiter, 1995).
The use of machine learning (ML) techniques, by
contrast, seems to be less frequent than in other
NLG tasks, although a number of exceptions do
exist (e.g., (Jordan and Walker, 2005; Viethen and
Dale, 2010; Viethen, 2011; Garoufi and Koller,
2013; Ferreira and Paraboni, 2014)).

A possible explanation for the small interest in
ML for REG may be the relatively low availabil-
ity of data. While research in many fields may
benefit from the wide availability of text corpora
(e.g., obtainable from the web), research in REG
usually requires highly specialised data - hereby
called REG corpora - conveying not only refer-
ring expressions produced by human speakers, but
also a fully-annotated representation of the con-
text (i.e., all objects and their semantic properties)
within which the expressions have been produced.

REG corpora such as TUNA (Gatt et al., 2007)
and GRE3D3 (Dale and Viethen, 2009) are useful
both to gain general insights on human language
production, and to benefit from data-intensive
computational techniques such as ML. However,
being usually the final product of controlled ex-
periments involving human subjects, REG cor-

69



pora tend to address highly specific research ques-
tions. For instance, GRE3D3 is largely devoted
to the investigation of relational referring expres-
sions (Kelleher and Kruijff, 2006) in simple visual
scenes involving geometric shapes, as in ‘the large
ball next to the red cube’. As a result, and despite
the usefulness of these resources to a large body of
work in REG, further research questions will usu-
ally require the collection of new data.

In this paper we introduce the Zoom corpus of
referring expressions. Zoom addresses a domain
that is considerably closer to real-world applica-
tions (namely, city maps in different degrees of
detail represented by zoom levels) than what has
been considered in previous work, involving both
singular and plural reference, and making exten-
sive use of relational properties. Moreover, Zoom
descriptions were produced by both Spanish and
Portuguese speakers, which will allow (to the best
of our knowledge, for the first time) a comprehen-
sive study of the REG surface realisation subtask
in these languages, and enable research on the is-
sues of human variation in REG (Fabbrizio et al.,
2008; Altamirano et al., 2012; Gatt et al., 2011).

2 Related work

TUNA (Gatt et al., 2007) was the first promi-
nent REG corpus to be made publicly available
for research purposes. The corpus was developed
in a series of controlled experiments, containing
2280 atomic descriptions produced by 60 speakers
of English in two domains (1200 descriptions of
furniture items and 1080 descriptions of people’s
photographs). TUNA has been used in a series of
REG shared tasks (Gatt et al., 2009).

GRE3D3 and its extension GRE3D7 (Dale and
Viethen, 2009; Viethen and Dale, 2011) were de-
veloped in a series of web-based experiments pri-
marily focussed on the study of relational descrip-
tions. GRE3D3 contains 630 descriptions pro-
duced by 63 speakers, and GRE3D7 contains 4480
descriptions produced by 287 speakers. In both
cases, the language of the experiment was English.
The domain consists of simple visual scenes con-
veying boxes and spheres.

Stars (Teixeira et al., 2014) and its extension
Stars2 were collected for the study of referential
overspecification. Stars contains 704 descriptions
produced by 64 speakers in a web-based exper-
iment. Stars2 was produced in dialogue situa-
tions involving subject pairs, and it contains 884

descriptions produced by 56 speakers. Both do-
mains make use of simple visual scenes containing
up to four object types (e.g., stars, boxes, cones
and spheres) and include atomic and relational de-
scriptions alike. The language of both experiments
was Brazilian Portuguese.

3 Experiment

We designed a web-based experiment to collect
natural language descriptions of map locations in
both Spanish and Portuguese. The collected data
set comprises a corpus of referring expressions for
research in REG and related fields. The situations
of reference under consideration make use of map
scenes in two degrees of detail (represented by low
and high zoom levels), and address instances of
singular and plural reference. A fragment of the
experiment interface is shown in Fig. 1.

Figure 1: Experiment interface

3.1 Subjects
Volunteers were recruited upon invitation sent by
email. The Portuguese data had 93 participants,
being 66 (71.0%) male and 27 (29.0%) female.
The Spanish data had 80 participants, being 59
male (69.4%) and 26 female (30.6%).

3.2 Procedure
Subjects received a web link to the on-line experi-
ment interface (cf. Fig. 1) with self-contained in-
structions. Age and gender details were collected
for statistical purposes. The experiment consisted
of a series of map images presented in random or-
der, one by one. Each map scene showed a partic-
ular location (e.g., a restaurant, pub, theatre etc.)
pointed by an arrow. For each scene, subjects were
required to imagine that they were giving travel
advice to a friend, and to complete the sentence ‘It

70



would be interesting to visit...’ with a description
of the location pointed by the arrow. After press-
ing a ‘Next’ button, another stimulus was selected,
until the end of the experiment. The first two im-
ages were fillers solely intended to make subjects
familiar with the experiment setting, and the cor-
responding responses were not recorded. Incom-
plete trials, and ill-formed descriptions, were also
discarded.

3.3 Materials
The experiment made use of the purpose-built in-
terface illustrated in Fig. 1, and a set of map im-
ages obtained from OpenStreetMap1, which con-
sisted of selected portions of maps of Madrid and
Lisbon to be presented to Spanish and Portuguese
speakers, respectively. For each city, 10 map lo-
cations were used. Each location was shown in
low and high zoom levels, making 20 images in
total. In both cases, the intended target was kept
the same, but the more detailed version would dis-
play a larger number of distractors and additional
details in general. In addition to that, certain street
and landmark names might not be depicted at dif-
ferent zoom levels. Half images showed a single
arrow pointing to one map location (i.e., requir-
ing a single description as ‘the restaurant on Baker
street’), whereas the other half showed two arrows
pointed to two different locations (and hence re-
quiring a reference to a set, as in ‘the two restau-
rants near the museum’).

3.4 Data collection
Upon manual verification, 602 ill-formed Por-
tuguese descriptions and 366 Spanish descriptions
were discarded. Thus, the Portuguese subcor-
pus consists of 1358 descriptions, and the Span-
ish subcorpus consists of 1234 descriptions. In
the Portuguese subcorpus, 78.6% of the descrip-
tions include relational properties. In addition to
that, 36.4% were minimally distinguishing, 44.3%
were overspecified, and 19.3% were underspeci-
fied. In the Spanish subcorpus, 70% of the de-
scriptions include relational properties, 35% were
minimally distinguishing, 40% were overspeci-
fied, and 25% were underspecified. Underspeci-
fied descriptions are not common in existing REG
corpora (i.e., certainly not in this proportion),
which may reflect the complexity of the domain
and/or limitations of the web-based setting.

3.5 Annotation
Each referring expression was modelled as con-
veying a description of the main target object and,
optionally, up to four descriptions of related land-
marks. The annotation scheme consisted of three
target attributes, four landmark attributes for each
of the four possible landmark objects, and seven
relational properties. This makes 26 possible at-
tributes for each referring expression. In the case
of plural descriptions (i.e., those involving two tar-
get objects), this attribute set is doubled.

Every object was annotated with the atomic at-
tributes type, name and others and, in the case of
landmark objects, also with their id. In addition
to that, seven relational properties were consid-
ered: in/on/at2, next-to, right-of, left-of, in-front-
of, behind-of, and the multivalue relation between
intended to represent ‘corner’ relations.

Possible values for the type and name attributes
are predefined by each referential context. The
others attribute may be assigned any string value,
and it is intended to represent any non-standard
piece of information conveyed by the expression.
For the spatial relations, possible values are the
object identifiers available from each scene.

The collected descriptions were fully annotated
by two independent annotators. After completion,
a third annotator assumed the role of judge and
provided the final annotation. Since the annotation
scheme was fairly straightforward (i.e., largely be-
cause all non-standard responses were simply as-
signed to the others attribute), agreement between
judges as measured by Kappa (Cohen, 1960) was
84% at the attribute level. Both referential con-
texts and referring expressions were represented
in XML format using a relational version of the
format adopted in TUNA (Gatt et al., 2007).

3.6 Comparison with previous work
Table 1 presents a comparison between the col-
lected data and existing REG corpora3: the num-
ber of referring expressions (REs), the number of
subjects in each experiment, the number of possi-
ble atomic attributes (Attrib.) and possible land-
marks (LMs) in a description, the average descrip-
tion size (in number of annotated properties), and
the proportion of property usage, which is taken to

tribute because they have approximately the same meaning
in the languages under consideration

be the proportion of properties that appear in the
description over the total number of possible at-
tributes and landmarks. From a REG perspective,
larger description sizes and lower usage rates may
suggest more complex situations of reference.

4 REG evaluation

In what follows we illustrate the use of the Zoom
corpus as training and test data for a simple ma-
chine learning approach to REG adapted from
(Ferreira and Paraboni, 2014). The goal of this
evaluation is to provide reference results for future
comparison with purpose-built REG algorithms,
and not to present a complete REG solution for
the Zoom domain or others.

The present model consists of 12 binary clas-
sifiers representing whether individual referential
attributes should be selected for inclusion in an
output description. The classifiers correspond to
atomic attributes of the target and first landmark
object (type, name and others), and relations. Ref-
erential attributes of other landmark objects were
not modelled due to data sparsity and also to re-
duce computational costs. For similar reasons, the
multivalue between relation is also presently disre-
garded, and ‘corner’ relations involving two land-
marks (e.g., two streets) will be modelled as two
independent classification tasks.

Only two learning features are considered by
each classifier: landmarkCount, which represents
the number of landmark objects near the main
target, and distractorCount, which represents the
number of objects of the same type as the target
within the relevant context in the map. For other
possible features applicable to this task, see, for
instance, (dos Santos Silva and Paraboni, 2015).

From the outcome of the 12 binary classifiers,
a description is built by considering atomic target
attributes in the first place. All attributes that cor-
respond to a positive prediction are selected for in-
clusion in the output description. Next, relations

are considered. If no relation is predicted, the
algorithm terminates by returning an atomic de-
scription of the main target object. If the descrip-
tion includes a relation, the corresponding land-
mark object is selected, and the algorithm is called
recursively to describe it as well. Since every at-
tribute that corresponds to a positive prediction
is always selected, the algorithm does not regard
uniqueness as a stop condition. As a result, the
output description may convey a certain amount
of overspecification.

For evaluation purposes, we used the subset of
singular descriptions from the Portuguese portion
of the corpus, comprising 821 descriptions. Evalu-
ation was carried out by comparing the corpus de-
scription with the system output to measure over-
all accuracy (i.e., the number of exact matches be-
tween the two descriptions), Dice (Dice, 1945) and
MASI (Passonneau, 2006) coefficients.

Following (Ferreira and Paraboni, 2014), we
built a REG model using support vector machines
with radial basis function kernel. The classifiers
were trained and tested using 6-fold cross valida-
tion. Optimal parameters were selected using grid
search as follows: for each step in the main k-fold
validation, one fold was reserved for testing, and
the remaining k − 1 folds were subject to a sec-
ondary cross-validation procedure in which differ-
ent parameter combinations were attempted. The
C parameter was assigned the values 1, 10, 100
and 1000, and γ was assigned 1, 0.1, 0.001 and
0.0001. The best-performing parameter set was
selected to build a classifier trained from the k− 1
fold, and tested on the test data. This was repeated
for every iteration of the main cross-validation
procedure.

Table 2 summarises the results obtained by the
REG algorithm built from SVM classifiers, those
obtained by a baseline system representing a rela-
tional extension of the Dale & Reiter Incremental
Algorithm, and by a Random selection strategy.

Table 2: REG results
Algorithm Acc. Dice MASI
SVM 0.15 0.51 0.28
Incremental 0.04 0.53 0.21
Random selection 0.03 0.45 0.15

We compare accuracy scores obtained by ev-
ery algorithm pair using the chi-square test, and
we compare Dice scores using Wilcoxon’s signed-
rank test. In terms of overall accuracy, the SVM

72



approach outperforms both alternatives. The dif-
ference from the second best-performing algo-
rithm (i.e., the Incremental approach) is significant
(χ2 = 79.87, df=1, p<0.0001). Only in terms of
Dice scores a small effect in the opposite direction
is observed (T=137570.5, p= 0.01413).

We also assessed the performance of the indi-
vidual classifiers. Table 3 shows these results as
measured by precision (P), recall (R), F1-measure
(F1) and area under the ROC curve (AUC).

Table 3: Classifier results
Classifier P R F1 AUC
tg type 0.95 1.00 0.98 0.25
tg name 0.09 0.05 0.07 0.41
tg other 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.05
lm type 0.93 1.00 0.96 0.44
lm name 0.97 1.00 0.98 0.35
lm other 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.43
next-to 0.50 0.24 0.32 0.63
right-of 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.28
left-of 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.27
in-front-of 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.42
behind-of 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.17
in/on/at 0.60 0.60 0.60 0.61

From these results we notice that highly fre-
quent attributes (e.g., target type and landmark
name) were classified with high accuracy, whereas
others (e.g., multivalue attributes and relations)
were not.

5 Discussion

This paper has introduced the Zoom corpus of nat-
ural language descriptions of map locations, a re-
source intended to support future research in REG
and related fields. Preliminary results of a SVM-
based approach to REG - which were solely pre-
sented for the future assessment of REG algo-
rithms based on Zoom data - hint at the actual
complexity of the REG task in this domain in a
number of ways. First, we notice that a simi-
lar approach in (Ferreira and Paraboni, 2014) on
GRE3D3 and GRE3D7 data has obtained consid-
erably higher mean accuracy. This is partially ex-
plained by the increased complexity of the Zoom
domain, but also by the currently simple annota-
tion scheme.

Second, we notice that Zoom descriptions are
prone to convey relations between a single target
and multiple landmark objects, as in ‘the restau-
rant between the 5th and 6th streets’. Although
common in language use, the use of multiple rela-
tional properties in this way has been little investi-

gated in the REG field.
Finally, we notice that the Zoom domain con-

tains two descriptions for every target object,
which are based on different - but related - mod-
els corresponding to the same map location seen
at different zoom levels. Interestingly, the refer-
ring expression in a 1X situation may or may not
be the same as in a 2X situation. Consider a map
with higher zoom level (2X) as illustrated in the
previous Fig. 2, and the same map location as seen
with lower zoom level in the previous Fig. 1.

Figure 2: Map with a more detailed zoom level

The underlying models for these two maps are
certainly different, but not unrelated. The map
with 2X zoom contains fewer objects but may in-
clude more properties due to the added level of de-
tail. The referring expression for the target in the
1X map may or may not be the same as in the 2X
map. For instance, the referring expression “the
pub at Cowgate” is underspecified on the 1X map,
but it is minimally distinguishing on the 2X map.

Differences of this kind are common in inter-
active applications (e.g., in which the context of
reference may change in structure or in the num-
ber of objects and referable properties), and the
challenge for REG algorithms would be to pro-
duced an appropriate description for the modified
context without starting from scratch. REG algo-
rithms based on local context partitioning (Areces
et al., 2008) may have an advantage in this respect,
but further investigation is still required.
