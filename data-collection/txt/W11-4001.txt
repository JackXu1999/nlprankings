Abstract

The Knowledge Base Population (KBP) task, being run for the past 3 years by the U.S. National Institute
of Standards and Technology, is the latest in a series of multi-site evaluations of information extraction,
following in the tradition of MUC and ACE. We examine the structure of KBP, emphasizing the basic
shift from sentence-by-sentence and document-by-document evaluation to corpus-based extraction and
the challenges it raises for cross-sentence and cross-document processing. We consider the problems
raised by the limited amount and incompleteness of the training data, and how this has been (partly)
addressed through such methods as semi-supervised learning and distant supervision. We describe some
of the optional tasks which have been included – rapid task adaptation (last year), temporal analysis (this
year), cross-lingual extraction (planned for next year) – and others which have been suggested.
