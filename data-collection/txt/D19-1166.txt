Abstract

This work introduces a machine translation
task where the output is aimed at audiences of
different levels of target language proficiency.
We collect a high quality dataset of news arti-
cles available in English and Spanish, written
for diverse grade levels and propose a method
to align segments across comparable bilingual
articles. The resulting dataset makes it pos-
sible to train multi-task sequence-to-sequence
models that translate Spanish into English tar-
geted at an easier reading grade level than the
original Spanish. We show that these multi-
task models outperform pipeline approaches
that translate and simplify text independently.

1 Introduction

Generating text at the right level of complexity can
make machine translation (MT) more useful for a
wide range of users. As Xu et al. (2015) note, sim-
plifying text makes it possible to develop reading
aids for people with low-literacy (Watanabe et al.,
2009; De Belder and Moens, 2010), for non-native
speakers and language learners (Petersen and Os-
tendorf, 2007; Allen, 2009), for people who suffer
from language impairments (Carroll et al., 1999;
Canning et al., 2000; Inui et al., 2003), and for
readers lacking expert knowledge of the topic dis-
cussed (Elhadad and Sutaria, 2007; Siddharthan
and Katsos, 2010). Such readers would also ben-
efit from MT output that is better targeted to their
needs by being easier to read than the original.

Prior work on text complexity has focused on
simplifying input text in one language, primar-
ily English (Chandrasekar et al., 1996; Coster
and Kauchak, 2011; Siddharthan, 2014; Xu et al.,
2015; Zhang and Lapata, 2017; Scarton and Spe-
cia, 2018; Kriz et al., 2019; Nishihara et al., 2019).
Simplification has been used to improve MT by
restructuring complex sentences into shorter and

simpler segments that are easier to translate (Ger-
ber and Hovy, 1998; Štajner and Popovic, 2016;
Hasler et al., 2017). Contemporaneously to our
work, Marchisio et al. (2019) show that tagging
the English side of parallel corpora with automatic
readability scores can help translate the same in-
put in a simpler or more complex form. Our work
shares the goal of controlling translation complex-
ity, but considers a broader range of reading grade
levels and simplification operations grounded in
professionally edited text simplification corpora.

Building a model for this task ideally re-
quires rich annotation for evaluation and super-
vised training that is not available in bilingual
parallel corpora typically used in MT. Control-
ling the complexity of Spanish-English translation
ideally requires examples of Spanish sentences
paired with several English translations that span
a range of complexity levels. We collect such a
dataset of English-Spanish segment pairs from the
Newsela website, which provides professionally
edited simplifications and translations. By con-
trast with MT parallel corpora, the English and
Spanish translations at different grade levels are
only comparable. They differ in length and sen-
tence structure, reflecting complex syntactic and
lexical simplification operations.

We adopt a multi-task approach to con-
trol complexity in neural MT and evaluate it
on complexity-controlled Spanish-English trans-
lation. Our extensive empirical study shows that
multitask models produce better and simpler trans-
lations than pipelines of independent translation
and simplification models. We then analyze the
strengths and weaknesses of multitask models, fo-
cusing on the degree to which they match the tar-
get complexity, and the impact of training data
types and reading grade level annotation.1

2 Background

Given corpora of parallel complex-simple seg-
ments, text simplification can naturally be framed
as a translation task, borrowing and adapting
model architectures originally designed for MT.
Xu et al. (2016) provide a thorough study of sta-
tistical MT techniques for English text simpli-
fication, and introduce novel objectives to mea-
sure simplification quality. Interestingly, they in-
directly make use of parallel translation corpora to
derive simplification paraphrasing rules by bilin-
gual pivoting (Callison-Burch, 2007). Zhang and
Lapata (2017) train sequence-to-sequence mod-
els to translate from complex to simple English
using reinforcement learning to directly optimize
the metrics that evaluate complexity (SARI) and
fluency and adequacy (BLEU). Scarton and Spe-
cia (2018) address the task of producing text of
varying levels of complexity for different target
audiences. They show that neural sequence-to-
sequence models informed by target-complexity
tokens inserted in the input sequence perform well
on this task. While the vast majority of text sim-
plification work has focused on English, Spanish
(Štajner et al., 2015), Italian (Brunato et al., 2016;
Aprosio et al., 2019) and German (Klaper et al.,
2013) have also received some attention.

While most MT approaches only indirectly cap-
ture style properties (e.g., via domain adaptation),
a growing number of studies share the goal of con-
sidering source texts and their translation in their
pragmatic context. Mirkin and Meunier (2015) in-
troduce personalized MT. Rabinovich et al. (2016)
and Vanmassenhove et al. (2018) suggest that the
gender of the author is implicitly marked in the
source text and that dedicated statistical and neu-
ral systems better preserve gender traits in MT out-
put. Neural MT has enabled more flexible ways to
control stylistic properties of MT output. Sennrich
et al. (2016) first propose to append a special token
to the source that neural MT models can attend
to and to select the formal (Sie) or informal (du)
version of second person pronouns when trans-
lating into German. Niu et al. (2018) show that
multi-task models can jointly translate between
languages and styles, producing formal and infor-
mal translations with broader lexical and phrasal

cate our model configurations and our cross-lingual seg-
ment aligner are available at https://github.com/

changes than the local pronoun changes in Sen-
nrich et al. (2016). Closest to our goal, Marchisio
et al. (2019) address the task of producing either
simple or complex translations of the same input,
using automatic readability scoring of parallel cor-
pora. They show that training distinct decoders for
simple and complex language allows better com-
plexity control than using the target complexity as
a side-constraint. By contrast, our approach ex-
ploits text simplification corpora for richer super-
vision for both training and evaluation.

3 A Multi-Task Approach to Complexity
Controlled MT

Task We define complexity controlled MT as a
task that takes two inputs: an input language seg-
ment si and a target complexity c. The goal is to
produce a translation so in the output language that
has complexity c. For instance, given input Span-
ish sentences in Table 1, complexity controlled
MT aims to produce English translations at a spe-
cific level of complexity, which might differ from
the complexity of the original Spanish.

Model We model P (so|si, c; θ) as a neural
encoder-decoder with attention (Bahdanau et al.,
2015). This architecture has been used success-
fully for the two related tasks of text simplifica-
tion (Wang et al., 2016; Zhang and Lapata, 2017;
Nisioi et al., 2017; Scarton and Specia, 2018) and
machine translation (Bahdanau et al., 2015). The
encoder constructs hidden representation for each
word in the input sequence, while the decoder gen-
erates the target sequence, conditioned on hidden
source representations. We hypothesize that train-
ing a single encoder-decoder model to perform the
two distinct tasks of machine translation and text
simplification will yield a model that can perform
complexity controlled MT. We adopt the multi-
task framework proposed by Johnson et al. (2016)
to train multilingual neural MT systems.

Representing target complexity Target com-
plexity c can be incorporated in sequence-to-
sequence models as a special token appended to
the beginning of the input sequence, which acts as
a side constraint. The encoder encodes this token
in its hidden states as any other vocabulary token,
and the decoder can attend to this representation
to guide the generation of the output sequence.
This simple strategy has been used in MT to con-
trol second person pronoun forms when translat-

ing into German (Sennrich et al., 2016), to indi-
cate the target language in multilingual MT (John-
son et al., 2016), and to obtain formal or informal
translations of the same input (Niu et al., 2018). In
monolingual text simplification tasks (Scarton and
Specia, 2018), the reading grade level has been en-
coded as such a special token.

Training Data and Objectives Fully supervised
training would ideally require translation samples
with outputs representing different levels of com-
plexity for the same input segment. However, con-
structing such data at the scale required to train
deep neural networks is expensive and unrealistic.
Our multi-task training configuration lets us ex-
ploit different types of training examples to train
shared encoder-decoder parameters θ. We use the
following samples/tasks:

• Complexity controlled MT samples
(si, co, so): These are the closest samples to
the task at hand, but are hard to obtain. They
are used to defined the complexity-controlled
MT loss

LCMT =
∑

(si,co,so)

logP (so|si, co; θ) (1)

• MT samples (si, so): These are sentence

pairs drawn from parallel corpora. They are
available in large quantities for many lan-
guage pairs (Tiedemann, 2012) and are used
to define the MT loss

LMT =
∑

(si,so)

logP (so|si; θ) (2)

• Text simplification samples in the MT target
language (so, cs′o , s

′
o) where s

′
o is a simplified

version of complexity cs′o for input so, which
are likely to be available in much smaller
quantities than MT samples.

LSimplify =
∑

(so,cs′o
,s′o)

logP (so|s′ocs′o ; θ)

(3)

The multi-task loss is simply obtained by sum-
ming the losses from individual tasks: LCMT +
LMT + LSimplify.

4 The Newsela Cross-Lingual
Simplification Dataset

We build on prior work that used the Newsela
dataset for English or Spanish text simplifica-
tion by automatically aligning English and Span-
ish segments of different complexity to enable
complexity-controlled machine translation.



1552

The Newsela website provides high quality data
to study text simplification. Xu et al. (2015)
argue that text simplification research should be
grounded in texts that are simplified by profes-
sional editors for specific target audiences, rather
than more general-purpose crowd-sourced simpli-
fications such as those available on Wikipedia.
They show that Wikipedia is prone to sen-
tence alignment errors, contains a non-negligible
amount of inadequate simplifications, and does
not generalize well to other text genres. By con-
trast, Newsela is an instructional content platform
meant to help teachers prepare curriculum that
match the language skills required at each grade
level. The Newsela corpus consists of English arti-
cles in their original form, 4 or 5 different versions
rewritten by professionals to suit different grade
levels as well as optional translations of original
and/or simplified English articles into Spanish re-
sulting in 23,130 English and 5,320 Spanish arti-
cles with grade annotations respectively.

This section introduces our method to align En-
glish and Spanish segments across complexity lev-
els, and the resulting bilingual dataset.

4.1 Cross-Lingual Segment Alignment

Extracting training examples from this corpus re-
quires aligning segments within documents. This
is challenging because text is neither simplified
nor translated sentence by sentence, and as a re-
sult, equivalent content might move from one sen-
tence to the next. Past work has introduced tech-
niques to align segments of different complexity
within documents of the same language (Xu et al.,
2015; Paetzold et al., 2017; Štajner et al., 2018).

Complexity controlled MT requires aligning
segments of different complexity in English and
Spanish. Existing methods for aligning sentences
in English and Spanish parallel corpora are not
well suited to this task. For instance, the Gale-
Church algorithm (Gale and Church, 1993) as-
sumes that aligned sentences should have similar
length. This assumption does not hold if the En-
glish article is a simplification of the Spanish ar-
ticle. Consider the following Spanish text and its
English translation in Newsela:

Spanish: LA HAYA, Holanda - Te has tomado
alguna vez una selfie?, Hoy en día es muy fácil.
Solo necesitas un teléfono inteligente.

Google Translated English: THE HAGUE,
Netherlands - Have you ever taken a selfie? Today

is very easy. You only need a smart phone.
Original English Version: THE HAGUE, Net-

herlands - All you need is a smartphone to take a
selfie. It is that easy.

As a result, we adapt a monolingual text simpli-
fication aligner for cross-lingual alignment. MAS-
SAlign (Paetzold et al., 2017) is a Python li-
brary designed to align segments of different
length within comparable corpora of the same lan-
guage. It employs a vicinity-driven search ap-
proach, based on the assumption that the order
in which information appears is roughly constant
in simple and complex texts. A similarity ma-
trix is created between the paragraphs/sentences
of aligned documents/paragraphs using a standard
bag-of-words TF-IDF model. It finds a starting
point to begin the search for an alignment path,
allowing long-distance alignment skips, capturing
1-N and N-1 alignments. To leverage this align-
ment flexibility, we apply MASSAlign to English
articles and Spanish articles machine translated
into English by Google translate.2 An important
property of Google translated articles is that they
are aligned 1-1 at the sentence level. This lets us
deterministically find the Spanish replacement for
the aligned Google translated English version re-
turned by MASSAlign. Translation quality is high
for this language pair, and even noisy translated ar-
ticles contain enough signal to construct the simi-
larity matrix required by MASSAlign.

4.2 Resulting Dataset

We thus create: both samples for complexity con-
trolled MT (si, co, so) and traditional monolingual
text simplification samples

(
so, cs′o , s

′
o

)
that can

be used by the multi-task model (Section 3). Since
the properties of Newsela monolingual simplifi-
cation samples have been studied thoroughly by
Xu et al. (2015), we present key statistics for the
cross-lingual simplification examples only. Ta-
ble 2 contrasts Newsela parallel segments with
bilingual parallel sentences drawn from the OPUS
corpus (Tiedemann, 2009). We use Global Voices
and News Commentary from OPUS corpus as it
has the most similar domain to the Newsela data.
Aligned segments in Newsela are about twice as
long as segments in parallel corpora, and contain
more than two sentences on each side on average.
By contrast, parallel corpora samples align sen-
tences one-to-one on average.

Articles are distributed across reading levels
spanning grades 2 to 12 for both English and
English-Spanish pairs. Table 3 highlights the vo-
cabulary differences among the different grade
levels for the Newsela Spanish-English corpus.
The vocabulary size of the corpus correspond-
ing to lower grade level is smaller as compared
to higher complexity levels. Also, complex sen-
tences have more words per sentence on average
but fewer sentences per segment compared to their
simplified counterparts. Simple sentences differ
from complex sentences in various ways, rang-
ing from sentence splitting and content deletion
to paraphrasing and lexical substitutions, as illus-
trated in Table 1.

5 Experiment Settings

We evaluate complexity controlled MT using
a subset of the 150k Spanish-English segment
pairs extracted from Newsela as described in Sec-
tion 4. We select Spanish and English segments
that have different reading grade levels, so that
given a Spanish input, the task consists in produc-
ing an English translation which is simpler (lower
reading grade level) than the Spanish input.The
train/development/test split ensures that there is no
overlap between articles held out for testing and
articles used for training. We refer to the corre-
sponding training examples as MT+simplify since
it represents the joint task of translation and sim-
plification.

5.1 Evaluation Metrics

We evaluate the truecased detokenized output of
our models using three automatic evaluation met-
rics, drawing from both machine translation and
text simplification evaluation.

BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) estimates transla-
tion quality based on n-gram overlap between sys-
tem output and references. However it does not
separate mismatches due to meaning errors and
mismatches due to simplification errors.

SARI (Xu et al., 2016)3 is designed to evalu-
ate text simplification systems by comparing sys-
tem output against references and against the input
sentence. It explicitly measures the goodness of
words that are added, deleted and kept by the sys-
tems. Xu et al. (2016) showed that BLEU shows
high correlation with human scores for grammati-
cality and meaning preservation and SARI shows
high correlation with human scores for simplic-
ity. In the cross-lingual setting, we cannot directly
compare the Spanish input with English hypothe-
ses and references, therefore we use the baseline
machine translation of Spanish into English as
a pseudo-source text. The resulting SARI score
directly measures the improvement over baseline
machine translation.

In addition to BLEU and SARI, we report Pear-
son’s correlation coefficient (PCC) to measure the
strength of the linear relationship between the
complexity of our system outputs and the com-
plexity of reference translations. Heilman et al.
(2008) use it to evaluate the performance of read-
ing difficulty prediction. Here we estimate the
reading grade level complexity of MT outputs and
reference translations using the Automatic Read-
ability Index (ARI)4 score, which combines evi-
dence from the number of characters per word and
number of words per sentence using hand-tuned

5.2 Training Data

In addition to the Newsela MT+Simplify training
examples described above, which are of the form
(si, co, so), we use monolingual English simpli-
fication data, bilingual parallel training data and
Spanish simplification data.

Newsela Simplification provides training ex-
amples of the form (so, cs′o , s

′
o), where so and s

′
o

are in the same language. We refer to this data
as Simplify data. It is used for training multi-
task models and for auxiliary evaluation on En-
glish only. Our version of this corpus has 513k
English segment pairs extracted using the method
by Paetzold and Specia (2016). Similar to Scar-
ton and Specia (2018), an original article 0 can
be aligned to up to four simplified versions: 1,2,3
and 4. Here 4 denotes the least simplified level
and 0 represents the most simplified level. The
train split consists of 460k instance pairs whereas
the development and test sets consist of roughly
20K instances, drawn from the same articles as
the MT+preserve and MT+simplify test set. For
Spanish, we have 110k segment pairs, which will
be used to train the Spanish simplification base-
line.

Bilingual Parallel Data (Newsela) We also
extract parallel Spanish-English segments from
Newsela based on aligned segments between
Spanish and English articles that have the same

reading grade level. We use this dataset to provide
in-domain MT training examples which includes
roughly 70k instances.

All datasets are pre-processed using Moses
tools for normalization, tokenization and true-
casing (Koehn et al., 2007). We further segment
tokens into subwords using a joint source-target
byte pair encoding model with 32,000 operations
(Sennrich et al., 2015).

5.3 Sequence-to-Sequence Model
Configuration

We use the standard encoder-decoder architecture
implemented in the Sockeye toolkit (Hieber et al.,
2017). Both encoder and decoder have two Long
Short Term Memory (LSTM) layers (Bahdanau
et al., 2015), hidden states of size 500 and dropout
of 0.3 applied to the RNNs of the encoder and de-
coder which is same as what was used by Scarton
and Specia (2018). We observe that dot product
based attention works best in our scenario, perhaps
indicating that the task of complexity controlled
translation requires mostly local changes that do
not lead to long distance reorderings across sen-
tences. We train using the Adam (Kingma and
Ba, 2014) optimizer with a batch size of 256 seg-
ments and checkpoint the model every 1000 up-
dates. Training stops after 8 checkpoints without
improvement of validation perplexity. The vocab-
ulary size is limited to 50000. We decode with a
beam size of 5. Grade side-constraints are defined
using a distinct special token for each grade level
(from 2 to 12). The constraint token corresponds
to the grade level of the target instance.

5.4 Baseline

We contrast the multi-task system with pipeline
based approaches, where translation and simpli-
fication are treated as independent consecutive
steps. We train a neural MT model to perform
translation from Spanish to English and other neu-
ral MT models to perform monolingual text sim-
plification for Spanish and English respectively. In
the first pipeline setup, the output from the trans-
lation model is fed as input to an English simpli-
fication model while in the other, the output from
the Spanish simplification model is fed as input
to an translation model. As Scarton and Specia
(2018), we simply use grade level tokens as side
constraints on English simplification examples to
control output complexity.5

6 Evaluation of Complexity Controlled
MT

We compare pipeline and multitask models on
the Newsela complexity controlled MT task (Ta-
ble 4). Overall, results show that compared to
pipeline models, multitask models produce com-
plexity controlled translations that better match
human references according to BLEU. SARI sug-
gests that multitask translations are simpler than
baseline translations, and their resulting complex-
ity correlates better with reference grade levels ac-
cording to PCC.

The two pipeline models use the same MT sys-
tem, therefore the difference between them comes
from text simplification: using English simplifica-
tion (first pipeline) outperforms Spanish simplifi-
cation (second pipeline) according to BLEU and
PCC, but not SARI. This can be explained by the
smaller amount of Spanish simplification training
data, which yields a model that generalizes poorly.

The “All tasks” model highlights the strengths
of the multi-task approach: combining train-
ing samples from many tasks yields improve-
ments over the “Translate and Simplify” multi-
task model which is trained on the exact same data
as the pipelines. However, even without additional
training data, the multitask “Translate and Simpi-
fly” model improves over baselines mainly by sim-
plifying the output more, which suggests that the
simplification component of the multitask model
benefits from the additional MT training data.

5Additional constraints based on simplification operations
were also used in that work but did not provide substantial
benefits when operations are predicted based on the input.

Qualitative analysis suggests that the multi-task
model is capable of distinguishing among differ-
ent grade levels and the simplification operations
performed for different grade levels are gradual.
Table 5 illustrates simplification operations ob-
served for a fixed grade 12 Spanish input into En-
glish with target grade levels ranging from 9 to 3.
When translating to a nearby grade level, for ex-
ample 9, the model roughly translates the entire in-
put. For lower grade levels such as 7 and 5, lexical
simplification and sentence splitting is observed.
For the simplest grade level, the model deletes ad-
ditional content. More examples are provided in
the Appendix ( Table 13).

els are trained on Newsela Simplification data and MT
parallel data from Newsela and OPUS. “Translate and
Simplify” uses the exact same data in a multi-task
model. The “All tasks” model uses all data available,
including Newsla MT+Simplify examples.

7 Analysis

7.1 Output Grade Analysis
We aim to better understand to what degree mod-
els simplify the input text: how often does the out-
put complexity exactly matches that of the refer-
ence? Does this change depend on the distance
between input and output complexity levels? Ta-

man et al., 2008), which represent the percentage
of sentences where the system output complexity
is within 1 or 2 grades of the reference text. We de-
rive the reading grade levels from ARI (Senter and
Smith, 1967) and conduct this analysis for the best
pipeline (“Translate then Simplify”) and multitask
models (“All Tasks”). These adjacency scores are
broken down according to the distance between in-
put and target grade levels.

Table 6: Adjacency ARI accuracy within grade level given by Adjacency level for the system output with respect
to the target grade: Multitask model is able to better capture the target grade than the pipeline model when the
difference between the source and the target grade is greater than 3.

When the source and target grades are close,
roughly 60% of system outputs that are within
a ±1 window of the correct grade level. The
pipeline model matches the target grade slightly
better than the multitask model. However, in the
more difficult case where the difference between
source and target grades is larger than three, the
multitask model outperforms the pipeline. In-
creasing the adjacency window to ±2 pushes the
percentage of matches in the 70s.

Overall these results show that multitask and
pipeline models are able to translate and simplify,
but that they do not yet fully succeed at precisely
controlling the complexity of their output to match
a specific target reading grade.

7.2 Ablation Experiments

Table 7 shows the impact of different training
data types on the multitask model using ablation
experiments. OPUS improves BLEU and SARI
performance across the board. However, using
OPUS without any Newsela MT data (Row 4)
hurts the correlation score, indicating the impor-
tance of in-domain MT data to control complex-

ity. The difference between the performance when
using joint translation and simplification (MT+S)
examples (Row 2) vs. simplification only (S in
Row 3) is small in terms of BLEU (+0.11) and
PCC (0.012), indicating that the monolingual sim-
plification dataset can provide simplification su-
pervision when MT+Simplify data is unavailable.
The overall best performance for the task is ob-
tained by using all types of training examples.6

7.3 Evaluation on Auxiliary Tasks

In addition to complexity controlled MT, the
multi-task model can be used to simplify English
text, and to translate from Spanish-to-English
without changing the complexity. For complete-
ness, we evaluate on these two auxiliary tasks.

Table 8 summarizes the results: the multitask
model slightly outperforms a dedicated simplifica-
tion model on English simplification, showing the
benefits of the additional training data from other
tasks. By contrast, on the resource-rich MT task,
the standalone translation system performs better.

6A random sample of outputs from the best model config-
uration are provided in the Appendix (Table 14).

Table 7: Data ablation experiments showing the impact
of different types of training examples on multi-task
model. The OPUS parallel corpus is essential to good
performance. Simplification data (S) can be used for
simplification supervision when joint translation and
simplification examples (MT+S) are unavailable.

This can be explained by the fact that the stan-
dalone system is only responsible for text trans-
lation, while the multi-task model is exposed to
samples of more diverse complexity levels during
training which damage its ability to preserve com-
plexity.

7.4 Provenance of Reading Grade Level

Our models control complexity using the gold
reading grade level assigned by professional
Newsela editors. We investigate the impact of re-
placing these gold labels by automatic predictions
from the ARI metric. ARI can be computed for
any English segment, including for MT parallel
corpora that are not annotated for complexity.

Table 9 shows that ARI provides an adequate
substitute for manually annotated reading grade
levels, as BLEU and SARI score remain close
when Newsela reading grade levels are replaced
by ARI-based tags. However, annotating all data

Complexity cont. MT BLEU SARI PCC

Newsela reading grade 22.51 44.80 0.572
ARI on Newsela data 22.26 45.12 0.581
ARI on all data 20.91 44.75 0.577

Table 9: Complexity controlled MT with automatic vs.
manual reading grade level tags: ARI provides an ade-
quate substitute for manually assigned grade levels.

with ARI grades, including the OPUS parallel cor-
pus, hurts BLEU. We attribute this result to the
differences in length and number of sentences per
segment in OPUS vs. Newsela (Table 2): seg-
ments of vastly different lengths can have the same
ARI score (Equation 4), thus confusing the multi-
task model.

8 Conclusion

We introduce a new task that aims to control com-
plexity in machine translation output, as a proxy
for producing translations targeted at audiences
with different reading proficiency levels. We con-
struct a Spanish-English dataset drawn from the
Newsela corpus for training and evaluation, and
adopt a sequence-to-sequence model trained in a
multitask fashion.

We show that the multitask model improves
performance over translation and simplification
pipelines, according to both machine translation
and simplification metrics. The reading grade
level of the multi-task outputs correlate better
with target grade levels than with pipeline outputs.
Analysis shows that these benefits come from their
ability to combine larger training data from differ-
ent tasks. Manual inspection also shows that the
multi-task model successfully produces different
translations for increasingly lower grades given
the same Spanish input.

However, even when simplifying translations,
multitask models are not yet able to exactly match
the desired complexity level, and the gap between
the complexity achieved and the target complex-
ity increases with the amount of simplification re-
quired. Our datasets and models thus provide a
foundation to investigate strategies for a tighter
control on output complexity in future work.
