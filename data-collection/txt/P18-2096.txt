Abstract

We propose a tri-modal architecture to pre-
dict Big Five personality trait scores from
video clips with different channels for au-
dio, text, and video data. For each channel,
stacked Convolutional Neural Networks
are employed. The channels are fused both
on decision-level and by concatenating
their respective fully connected layers. It is
shown that a multimodal fusion approach
outperforms each single modality channel,
with an improvement of 9.4% over the best
individual modality (video). Full backprop-
agation is also shown to be better than a
linear combination of modalities, meaning
complex interactions between modalities
can be leveraged to build better models.
Furthermore, we can see the prediction rel-
evance of each modality for each trait. The
described model can be used to increase the
emotional intelligence of virtual agents.

1 Introduction

Automatic prediction of personality is important
for the development of emotional and empathetic
virtual agents. Humans are very quick to assign
personality traits to each other, as well as to virtual
characters (Nass et al., 1995). People infer per-
sonality from different cues, both behavioral and
verbal, hence a model to predict personality should
take into account multiple modalities including lan-
guage, speech and visual cues.

Personality is typically modeled with the Big
Five personality descriptors (Goldberg, 1990). In
this model an individual’s personality is defined as
a collection of five scores in range [0, 1] for per-
sonality traits Extraversion, Agreeableness, Con-
scientiousness, Neuroticism and Openness to Ex-
perience. These score are usually calculated by

each subject filling in a specific questionnaire. The
biggest effort to predict personality, as well as
to release a benchmark open-domain personality
corpus, was given by the ChaLearn 2016 shared
task challenge (Ponce-López et al., 2016). All
the best performing teams used neural network
techniques. They extracted traditional audio fea-
tures (zero crossing rate, energy, spectral features,
MFCCs) and then fed them into the neural net-
work (Subramaniam et al., 2016; Gürpınar et al.,
2016; Zhang et al., 2016). A deep neural network
should however be able to extract such features
itself. Güçlütürk et al. (2016) took a different ap-
proach by feeding the raw audio and video samples
to the network. However they mostly designed the
network for computer vision, and used the same
architecture to audio input without any adaptation
or considerations to merge modalities. The chal-
lenge was in general aimed at the computer vision
community (many only used facial features), thus
not many looked into what their deep network was
learning regarding other modalities.

In this paper, we are interested in predicting per-
sonality from speech, language and video frames
(facial features). We first consider the different
modalities separately, in order to have more un-
derstanding of how personality is expressed and
which modalities contribute more to the personal-
ity definition. Then we design and analyze fusion
methods to effectively combine the three modali-
ties in order to obtain a performance improvement
over each individual modality. The readers can re-
fer to the survey by Baltrušaitis et al. (2018) for
more information on multi-modal approaches.

2 Methodology

Our multimodal deep neural network architecture
consists of three separate channels for audio, text,
and video. The channels are fused both in decision-



607

level fusion and inside the neural network. The
three channels are trained in a multiclass way, in-
stead of separate models for each trait (Farnadi
et al., 2016). The full architecture is trained end-
to-end, which refers to models that are completely
trained from the most raw input representation to
the desired output, with all the parameters learned
from data (Muller et al., 2006). Automatic fea-
ture learning has the capacity to outperform feature
engineering, as these learned features are automati-
cally tuned to the task at hand. The full neural net-
work architecture with the three channels is shown
in Fig. 1.

2.1 Audio channel
The audio channel looks at acoustic and prosodic
(i.e. non-verbal) information of speech. It takes
raw waveforms as input instead of commonly used
spectrograms or traditional feature sets, as CNNs
are able to autonomously extract relevant features
directly from audio (Bertero et al., 2016).

Input audio samples are first downscaled to a
uniform sampling rate of 8 kHz before fed to the
model. During each training iteration (but not dur-
ing evaluation), for each input audio sample we
randomize the amplitude (volume) through an ex-
ponential random coefficient α = 10U(−1.5,1.5),
where U(−1.5, 1.5) is a uniform random variable,
to avoid any bias related to recording volumes.

We split the input signal into two feature chan-
nels as input for the CNN: the raw waveform as-is,
and the signal with squared amplitude (aimed at
capturing the energy component of the signal). A
stack of four convolutional layers is applied to the
input to perform feature extraction from short over-
lapping windows, analyze variations over neigh-
boring regions of different sizes, and combine all
contributions throughout the sample.

We used global average pooling operation over
the output of each layer to capture globally ex-
pressed personality characteristics over the entire
audio frame and to combine the contributions of
the convolutional layer outputs. After obtaining the
overall vector by weighted-average of each convo-
lutional layer output, it is fed to a fully connected
layer with final sigmoid layer to perform the final
regression operation to map this representation to a
score in range [0, 1] for each of the five traits.

2.2 Text channel
The transcriptions for the ChaLearn dataset, pro-
vided by the challenge organizers, were obtained

by using a professional human transcription ser-
vice 1 to ensure maximum quality for the ground
truth annotations. For this channel we extract
word2vec word embeddings from transcriptions
and feed those into a CNN. The embeddings have
a dimensionality of k = 300 and were pre-trained
on Google News data (around 300 billion words).
This enables us to take into account much more
contextual information than available in just the
corpus at hand.

Transcriptions per sample were split up into dif-
ferent sentences. We normalized the text in order
to align our corpus with the embedding dictionary.
We fed the computed matrix into a CNN, whose
architecture is inspired by Kim (2014). Three con-
volutional windows of size three, four, and five
words are slid over the sentence, taking steps of
one word each time. These windows are expected
to extract compact n-grams from sentences. After
this layer, a max-pooling is taken for the outcome
of each of the kernels separately to get a final sen-
tence encoding. The representation is then mapped
through a fully connected layer with sigmoid acti-
vation, to the final Big Five personality traits.

2.3 Video channel

In the video channel, we first take a random frame
from each of the videos, which leads to personal-
ity recognition from only appearance. We did not
use Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks
because we only need appearance information, not
temporal and movement information. Although
many works in the ChaLearn competition align
faces manually using the famous Viola-Jones algo-
rithm (Viola and Jones, 2004) and crop them from
frames (Gürpınar et al., 2016), here we choose not
to in order to prevent excessive preprocessing. It
has also been found and shown that deep archi-
tectures can automatically learn to focus on the
face (Gucluturk et al., 2017).

We extract representations from the images us-
ing the VGG-face CNN model (Parkhi et al., 2015),
with pre-trained VGG-16 weights (Simonyan and
Zisserman, 2014). Input images are fed into the
model with their three channels (blue, red, and
green). Several convolutional layers combined
with max-pooling and padding layers follow. We
use two final fully connected layers, followed by
sigmoid activation to map to the five traits. We
only train these two final layers. Fine-tuning pre-

trained models as such is a common way to lever-
age on training on large outside datasets and thus
the model doesn’t need to learn extracting visual
features itself (Esteva et al., 2017).

2.4 Multimodal fusion

Humans infer personality from different cues and
this motivates us to predict personality by using
multiple modalities simultaneously. We look at
three different fusing methods to find how to com-
bine modalities best.

The first method is a decision-level fusion ap-

proach, done through an ensemble (voting) method.
The three channels are copies of the fully trained
models described above. We want to know the
linear combination weights for each modality, for
each trait (15 weights in total). The final pre-
dictions from our tri-modal model then become
p̂i =

∑N
j=1wi,j p̂i,j , where pi represents the en-

semble estimator for the score of trait i, j repre-
sents the modality (with N = 3 the number of
modalities), and wi,j and p̂i,j the weights and esti-
mates respectively for trait i for modality j. The
weights were found by minimizing the Mean Ab-



609

solute Error (MAE) on the development set. We
choose to have weights per trait because the uni-
modal results show that some modalities are better
at predicting some traits than others. An important
advantage of using this fusion method is that we
can read the relevance of the modalities for each of
the traits , from the weights.

In the other fusion methods we propose, we first
merge the modalities by truncating the final fully
connected layers from each of the channels. We
then concatenate the previous fully connected lay-
ers, to obtain shared representations of the input
data. Finally we add two extra fully connected lay-
ers on top. For the second method, all layers in the
separate channels are frozen, so we basically want
the model to learn what combination (could still be
a linear one) of channel outputs is optimal. For the
third method, we again train this exact architecture,
but now we also update the parameters of both the
audio and text channels, thus enabling fully end-
to-end backpropagation. This enables the model
to learn more complex interaction between the dif-
ferent channels. The architecture is illustrated in
Fig. 1. The layers in the dashed boxes are frozen
(non-trainable) for limited backpropation model,
and trainable for full backpropagation model.

3 Experiments

3.1 Corpus

We used the ChaLearn First Impressions Dataset,
which consists of YouTube vlogs clips of around 15
seconds (Ponce-López et al., 2016). The speaker in
each video is annotated with Big Five personality
scores. The ChaLearn dataset was divided into a
training set of 6,000 clips and 20% of the training
set was taken as validation set during training to
tune the hyperparameter, the early stopping condi-
tions and the ensemble method training. We used
pre-defined ChaLearn Validation Set of 2,000 clips
as the test set.

3.2 Setup

For the audio CNN, we used a window size of 200
(i.e. 25ms) for the first layer, and a stride of 100
(i.e. 12.5ms). In the following convolutional layers
we set the window size and stride is set to 8 and 2
respectively. The number of filters was kept at 512
for each layer. In the text CNN instead we used a
filter size of 128, and apply dropout (p = 0.5) to
the last layer. In the video CNN we used again 512
filters for each layer.

We trained our model using Adam optimizer
(Kingma and Ba, 2014). All models were imple-
mented with Keras (Chollet et al., 2015). We train
all models parameters with a regression cost func-
tion by iteratively minimizing the average over five
traits of the Mean Square Error (MSE) between
model predictions and ground truth labels. We also
use the MSE with the ground truth to evaluate the
performance over the test set.

3.3 Results
Our aim is to investigate the contribution of differ-
ent modalities for personality detection task. Ta-
ble 1 includes the optimal weights learned for the
decision-level fusion approach. From this table we
can read contribution of each of the modalities to
the prediction of each trait.

Table 2 displays the tri-modal regression (MAE)
performance, individual modalities, multimodal
decision-level fusion and the two neural network
fusion methods. We also report the average trait
scores from the training set labels as a baseline
(Mairesse et al., 2007). The neural network fusion
with full backpropagation works best with an aver-
age MSE score of 0.0938, around 2.9% improve-
ment over the last-layer backpropagation only, and
9.4% over the best separate modality (video). Both
in separate and ensemble methods, the results we
obtain are lower than just estimating the average
from the training set.

The main target in this work is to investigate
the effect of audio, visual, and text modalities, and
different fusion methods in personality recognition,
rather than proposing the method with the best ac-
curacy. However, we still repeat the accuracy of the
reported methods in Table 2 and two winners of the
ChaLearn 2016 competition DCC (Güçlütürk et al.,
2016) and evolgen (Subramaniam et al., 2016) in
Table 3. It can be seen that the result for out tri-
modal method with fully back-propagation is com-
parable to the winners.

3.4 Discussion

Looking at the results obtained from various fusion
methods in Table 2, we can see that for decision-
level and last-layer backpropagation, Neuroticism
and Extraversion are the easiest traits to predict, fol-
lowed by Conscientiousness and Openness. Agree-
ableness is significantly harder. We also see that the
last-layer fusion yields very similar performance
as the decision-level approach. It is likely that the
limited backpropagation method learns something
similar to a linear combination of channels, just like
the decision-level method. On the other hand, the
full backpropagation method yields significantly
higher results for all traits except Agreeableness.

From Table 1 we can also see which modalities
carry more information. The text modality is not
adding much value to traits other than Agreeable-
ness and Conscientiousness. Extraversion can, on
the other hand, be quite easily recognized from tone
of voice and appearance. Having said this, we must
be careful in deciding which modalities are most
suitable for individual traits, since certain traits (e.g.
Extraversion) are more evident from a short slice
and some (e.g. Openness) need longer temporal in-

formation (Aran and Gatica-Perez, 2013). Polzehl
et al. (2010) have proposed a method for person-
ality recognition in speech modality on a different
corpus. The method is not based on neural network
architecture, but they provide a similar analysis that
supports our conclusions.

Since the full backpropagation experiments
yields much better results than the linear combina-
tion model, we can conclude that different modal-
ities interact with each other in a non-trivial man-
ner. Moreover, we can observe that simply adding
features from different modalities (represented as
concatenating a final representation without full
backpropagation) does not yield optimal perfor-
mance.

Our tri-modal approach is quite extensive and
there are more modalities such as nationality, cul-
tural background, age, gender, and personal inter-
ests that can be added. All Big Five traits have
been found to have a correlation with age (Donnel-
lan and Lucas, 2008). Extraversion and Openness
have a negative correlation with age, Agreeableness
have a positive correlation, and Conscientiousness
scores peak for middle age subjects.

4 Conclusion

We proposed a fusion method, based on deep neural
networks, to predict personality traits from audio,
language and appearance. We have seen that each
of the three modalities contains a signal relevant for
personality prediction, that using all three modali-
ties combined greatly outperforms using individual
modalities, and that the channels interact with each
other in a non-trivial fashion. By combining the
last network layers and fine-tuning the parameters
we have obtained the best result, average among all
traits, of 0.0938 Mean Square Error, which is 9.4%
better than the performance of the best individual
modality (visual). Out of all modalities, language
or speech pattern seems to be the least relevant.
Video frames (appearance) are slightly more rele-
vant than audio information (i.e. non-verbal parts
of speech).
