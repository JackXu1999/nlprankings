Abstract 

Alzheimer’s Disease, as other mental and neu-
rological disorders, is difficult to diagnose 
since it affects several cognitive abilities 
shared with other impairments. Current diag-
nostic mainly consists of neuropsychological 
tests and history obtained from the patient and 
relatives. In this paper we propose a method-
ology for the characterization of probable AD 
based on the computational cognitive model-
ing of a language function in order to capture 
the internal mechanisms of the impaired brain. 
Parameters extracted from the model allow a 
better characterization of this illness than us-
ing only behavioral data. 

1 Introduction 

Document “Dementia. A public health priority” by 
the World Health Organization1 defines dementia 
as a syndrome, usually of a chronic or progressive 
nature, caused by a variety of brain illnesses that 
affect memory, thinking, orientation, comprehen-
sion, calculation, learning capacity, language, and 
judgment leading to an inability to perform every-
day activities. Current data estimate over 35.6 mil-
lion people worldwide affected by dementia and 
this number will double by 2030 and more than 
triple by 20502. Dementia is among the seven pri-

ority mental and neurological impairments1. Alt-
hough dementia is a collective concept including 
different possible causes or diseases (vascular, 
Lewy bodies, frontotemporal degeneration, Alz-
heimer), there are broad similarities between the 
symptoms of all them. Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) 
is the most common cause of dementia. Its early 
diagnosis may help people to have information in 
the present for making decisions about their future 
and to receive treatment as soon as possible.  

Clinical diagnosis of dementia happens after 
subjects realize memory loss or language difficul-
ties affecting their everyday activities. Usually, the 
therapist takes note of these subjective impair-
ments coupled with objective information given by 
some relative and then performs a battery of neu-
ropsychological tests. Besides, neuroimaging tech-
niques (MRI, PET) and biomarkers tests can 
strengthen the diagnosis process by discarding any 
other pathology. The drawback of these last tech-
niques is their high cost. So, a key point in detect-
ing this syndrome is to research about noninvasive 
and low cost diagnosis techniques whose applica-
tion could be extended to everybody at a very early 
stage even before appearing any subjective or ob-
servable symptom. 

One of the most common functions affected in 
dementia is language production (Hart and Semple, 
1990). Many of the structures and processes in-
volved in language processing are shared by dif-
ferent cognitive capacities. So, it would be possible 
to identify any cognitive impairment not directly 

61



related to language at an early stage by analyzing 
language processing. 

The loss of communicative capability is detected 
in 80% of people at the first development stage of 
AD. Most research works relating AD and lan-
guage have mainly focused their efforts on the lex-
ical-semantics area (Cherktow and Bub, 1990) 
although there are also several studies showing 
linguistic problems in areas like phonology, syn-
tax, pragmatics and inflectional morphology and 
how these problems evolve along the disease´s 
stages (Taller and Philips, 2008).  

The majority of these works have been carried 
out in English but their results can be extended to 
other languages such as Spanish. An exhaustive 
analysis of linguistic processing in Spanish was 
performed by Cuetos el al. (2003) covering phono-
logical, syntactical and semantic areas. However, 
there is no study dealing with verbal morphology 
in Spanish. The closest reference work examining 
the effects of AD in past-participle and present-
tense production of real regular and irregular verbs 
as well as novel verbs of the two first morphologi-
cal classes is in Italian (Walenski et al. 2009). The 
pattern found is the same as in English inflection: 
dementia patients are impaired at inflecting real 
irregular verbs but not real regular verbs for both 
tenses or novel verbs (Ullman, 2004).  

Although there exist many neuropsychological 
tests used to diagnose dementia (Pasquier, 1999), 
like MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) 
(Folstein et al., 1975), they have a low sensibility 
at early stages and do not provide an individual 
and distinguishing measure of the disease. Lan-
guage tests have proven to be very useful tools in 
identifying different types of mental disorders 
(Stevens et al., 1996).  

In (Cuetos et al., 2003) the authors build a sup-
port model for the diagnosis of probable AD from 
the results of tasks belonging to phonological, syn-
tactic and semantics areas by using a linear regres-
sion analysis. Other research work (Bucks et al., 
2000) finds the predictive markers of probable AD 
by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) from 
measures of spontaneous narrative speech. The 
same kind of measures were processed by different 
machine learning methods resulting in classifica-
tion models with a high predictive power (Thomas 
et al., 2005), which were able to detect the type of 
disorder even in pre-symptomatic subjects (Jarrold 
et al., 2010). These works demonstrate, on the one 

hand, the role of language use as a behavioral 
measure; on the other, the potential value of the 
computational analysis of language as a characteri-
zation and diagnostic means and, specifically, the 
capability of machine learning techniques to de-
velop descriptive and predictive models of mental 
disorders from language use.  

In other cognitive impairments related to lan-
guage production (Oliva et al., 2014), the perfor-
mance of classification models obtained with 
machine learning techniques have shown to be bet-
ter than statistical methods like regression or lineal 
discriminant analyses. Nevertheless, to the best of 
our knowledge, there is no study about modeling 
by machine learning methods the behavior of na-
tive Spanish-speakers with dementia by using 
measures extracted from verbal morphology tests. 

As stated before, there exist different types of 
dementia as a consequence of diverse diseases that 
share similar symptoms and behavioral patterns. A 
deeper knowledge about the specific structural or 
functional causes of this syndrome and so about 
the underlying disease can be gained by neuroim-
aging techniques. But these techniques are expen-
sive and their use is not generally extended. The 
efficacy of a therapy or treatment depends on how 
the disease affects the patient individually. How-
ever, most studies present a profile of average be-
havior behind disorders. A novel way to overcome 
this lack of personalized information about the pa-
tient can be supplied by computational modeling of 
individual patients’ behavior when patients per-
form a certain cognitive task. 

A cognitive architecture is a general framework 
to develop behavior computational models about 
human cognition (Anderson and Lebiere, 1998). 
This type of architecture must take into account the 
abilities (i.e. memory, learning, perception, motor 
action) and the boundaries (i.e. forgetting) of the 
human being. As a general theory about the struc-
ture and function of a complete cognitive system, a 
cognitive architecture determines the way percep-
tual, cognitive and motor processes interact in pro-
ducing behavior. The framework provided by a 
cognitive architecture allows the computational 
models supported by it to be neurologically and 
psychologically plausible. Computational model-
ing is an integral procedure for obtaining indirect 
measurements about structures and processes in-
volved when people accomplish a cognitive task 
(Iglesias et al., 2012; Serrano et al., 2009). A good 

62



subject’s model must fit the behavior of such a 
subject, that is, it must generate statistically equiv-
alent data to the subject’s data. A well-known cog-
nitive architecture is ACT-R (Anderson, 2007). Its 
application to a language function as the task of 
acquiring verbal morphology in English (Taagten 
and Anderson, 2002) is based on the dual-
mechanism theory (Pinker and Prince, 1988), 
which posits that irregular forms of verbs are 
stored in memory as entries in the mental lexicon 
while regular forms are computed by rules. This 
same paradigm has been used to model the acquisi-
tion of a highly inflected verbal system like Span-
ish (Oliva et al., 2010) and the behavior of children 
with Specific Language Impairment (SLI) (Oliva et 
al., 2013). 

This paper presents a methodology for the char-
acterization and diagnosis of probable AD (pAD) 
for native-Spanish speakers based on the computa-
tional cognitive modeling of the subjects’ behavior 
when they perform verb inflection tasks. The set of 
variable values of each model are presented to su-
pervised machine learning algorithms to learn a 
classification and predictive model of data. The 
results of the preliminary study that we have car-
ried out show that the variables obtained from the 
computational cognitive models are very informa-
tive for the diagnosis process. Also it is important 
to note that this methodology can be easily extend-
ed to other languages and even to other cognitive 
impairments not necessarily related to language. 

2 Method 

As commented in the previous section, AD can 
present overlapping symptoms with other types of 
dementia and exhibit more deficits other than lan-
guage use. So, any methodology for the diagnosis 
of cognitive or mental impairments should have 
two main goals: generality and individualization. 
The methodology should be adequate to diagnose 
different cognitive impairments and, at the same 
time, it should take into account the individual dif-
ferences that are usually present on these impair-
ments. Here we present a methodology that 
achieves these two objectives applied to the partic-
ular case of pAD consisting mainly in: i) finding 
the task that exhibits behavioral differences be-
tween healthy and impaired subjects, ii) preparing 
the computational cognitive architecture with the 
knowledge to deal with the selected task, iii) mod-

eling the individual subject’s behavior to obtain the 
parameters of the architecture specific to each par-
ticipant, and iv) applying machine learning tech-
niques on the information given by the cognitive 
models to learn the classification model that sup-
ports impairment diagnosis. Next, the different 
steps of the methodology are explained and applied 
to characterize and diagnose pAD. 

2.1 Participants 

Twenty-two native-Spanish speakers were initially 
selected to take part in this preliminary study by 
the Centro de Referencia Estatal de Discapacidad y 
Dependencia (CRE) de León, Spain, distributed 
into twelve patients of pAD (six men, six women) 
and ten healthy control subjects (five men, four 
women) age-matched. pAD participants were iden-
tified by the MEC (Lobo et al., 1979) and Barcelo-
na tests (Peña-Casanova et al. 2005) for Spanish 
speakers. 
Three participants with pAD were discarded due to 
two of them have a low educational level and the 
third one was not originally from Spanish. The fi-
nal participants’ demographic features can be seen 
in Table 1.

2.2 Define target task 

The task to be carried out intends to reflect be-
havioral differences between pAD patients and 
control healthy individuals. Since patients with 
pAD have shown deficits with verbal morphology 
in English and Italian, we have selected a task of 
verb inflection consisting of two sets with 40 pairs 
of sentences. In selecting the sentences’ verbs, we 
have avoided reflexive, recent and onomatopoeic 
verbs. In the first set, devoted to present tense, all 
the sentences were presented at first person, singu-
lar and together a frequency adverb to denote that 
the action is usually performed. An example of this 
set is: a) A mí me gusta llevar pantalones vaqueros 
(I like to wear jeans) and b) Así que todos los días 

63



… pantalones vaqueros (So I … jeans every day). 
In the second set, devoted to simple past, all sen-
tences were presented at third person, singular and 
together the adverb “ayer” (“yesterday”) to denote 
that the action was done in the past. An example of 
this set is: a) A Lola le gusta comer temprano (Lola 
likes to eat early) and b) Así que ayer Lola … tem-
prano (So Lola … early yesterday). 

In the two sets, 20 regular and 20 irregular verbs 
were used, respectively. These verbs were re-
trieved from the Reference Corpus of Current 
Spanish3 and matched in frequency (regular = 
44.79, irregular = 44.33, p = 0.98). All regular 
verbs, except one (“comer”-“to eat”), belonged to 
the first morphological class, or first conjugation, 
finishing the infinitival form of the verb with “–
ar”. Irregular verbs belonged to the second and 
third conjugation, finishing with “–er” and “–ir”, 
respectively. Both regular and irregular matched in 
orthographical (Number of letters: Infinitive form: 
regular = 6.4, irregular = 5.85, p = 0.29; Inflected 
form: regular = 5.48, irregular = 5.58, p = 0.74) 
and phonological length (Number of syllables: In-
finitive form: regular = 2.4, irregular = 2.25, p = 
0.41; Inflected form: regular = 2.4, irregular = 
2.35, p = 0.69), and consonant density (Infinitive 
form: regular = 1.62, irregular = 1.57, p = 0.62; 
Inflected form: regular = 1.18, irregular = 1.24, p = 
0.43) in order to avoid phonological factors biasing 
results. 

2.3 Behavioral profile 

Next, the procedure performed to collect this kind 
of data and the results obtained are briefly de-
scribed. 

Procedure: 80 pairs of sentences were random-
ly sorted and presented to all the participants. Eve-
ry participant had to read each sentence pair slowly 
and to fill the gap in the second sentence with the 
suited inflected form of the verb in the first sen-
tence. The answers of each participant are catego-
rized as follows: 1) Correct answers, 2) 
Overregularization or Irregularization errors, oc-
curring when the expected form was irregular or 
regular, respectively, 3) Number or Person (NP) 
errors, when fails the number or person affix, 4)

Mood, Tense or Aspect (MTA) errors, when fails 
the mood or tense or aspect affix, and 6) Other er-
rors, not included in the previous categories. 

Results: People with pAD made more mistakes 
when inflecting both past and present tenses. The 
results obtained show a clear deficit in producing 
irregular forms both in past and present tense in 
participants with pAD compared with controls, as 
seen in languages such as English (Ullman, 2004) 
and Italian (Walenski et al., 2009). Table 2 pre-
sents these results. Other types of errors made by 
participants with pAD holding statistical differ-
ences with the control group are overregularization 
ones in present tense and substitution errors of 
mood, tense or aspect. According to the dual-
mechanism theory (Pinker and Prince, 1988), er-
rors in irregular forms and MTA errors are focused 
on declarative memory fails since this memory 
stores irregular verb forms

same way, overregularization errors are predicted 
by this mechanism due to the application by proce-

dural memory of a regular rule to produce an ir-
regular form when this form is not found in the 
declarative memory. 

2.4 Computational Cognitive Modeling  

The next step is to build a personalized computa-
tional cognitive model for the target task. The psy-
chological plausibility of the model is a key point. 
The cognitive architecture should be able to model 
the normal and the impaired behavior. It is also 
highly relevant how the architecture produces these 
behaviors because its parameters are to be used on 
the diagnosis process. The better the model mimics 
human behavior, the more useful would be the in-
formation obtained from it. 

Each individual computational cognitive 
model is obtained from a dual-mechanism cogni-
tive architecture for the acquisition of verbal mor-
phology in highly inflected languages like Spanish 
along children’ development. A more detailed de-
scription of this architecture can be found in (Oliva 
et al., 2010). We describe below the instantiation 
of this architecture to fit adults’ features and be-
havior in the verb inflection task: 

 
• Mechanisms: The architecture is based on 

two general strategies: memory retrieval 
and analogy. Using these two initial mech-
anisms, the architecture is able to use the 
regular rules and the irregular exceptions 
just using the examples from the input vo-
cabulary.  

• Parameters: The mechanisms of the archi-
tecture are controlled by a series of param-
eters that give shape to its behavior. These 
parameters form three main groups: de-
clarative memory parameters that control 
the retrieval of learned facts from memory 
(RT-retrieval threshold, ANS-noise intro-
duced into the memory retrieval process, 
BLL-forgetting factor, A0-initial activa-
tion); procedural memory parameters that 
control the learning and execution of rules 
(α) and the noise in the process of select-
ing a rule to execute (EGS); and grammat-
ical processing parameters that control 
how the architecture deals with the differ-
ent grammatical features (γm, controls the 
noise introduced into the perception of 
morphological features, C-PM, NP-PM 

and MTA-PM, which control the sensitivi-
ty of the model to each grammatical fea-
ture as conjugation, number-person and 
mood-time-aspect, respectively) when re-
trieving a verb form from memory. 

• Representation: The architecture uses se-
mantic and morphological information. 
Each verb form is represented by its mean-
ing and some grammatical features such as 
conjugation, number, person, mood, tense 
or aspect in the declarative memory.  

• Input vocabulary: The architecture uses the 
same 20 regular verbs and 20 irregular 
verbs in present and past tense, retrieved 
from the Reference Corpus of Current 
Spanish (RAE, 2012) and engaged in the 
target task. 
  

The procedure used to make the architecture 
mimic participants’ behavior lies in presenting to it 
randomly each of the 40 verbs in infinitive form 
and to ask for the present tense of the first person 
of singular or the past tense of the third person of 
singular, depending on the sentence pair.  

2.5 Subject modeling profile  

Our proposal is to obtain for each participant the 
set of parameter values of the computational cogni-
tive architecture that best fit the behavior of that 
participant.

Procedure: This stage of the methodology re-
quires the use of an optimization algorithm for ob-
taining the architecture´s parameter values that 
adjust to the user´s behavior. We used an evolu-
tionary strategy (Beyer and Schwefel, 2002), 
where the genotype consists of the 9 parameters of 
the cognitive architecture mentioned above. To 
constrain the search space to psychologically plau-
sible values we used the database proposed by 
(Wong et al., 2010) shown in Table 3.

Table 4. Attributes used by machine learning methods. 

In order to model individuals with impairment, 
the range allowed for each of the parameters is de-

fined as the average value ± five standard devia-
tions (Thomas et al., 2003). Since dementia is an 
impairment happening in adulthood, when most 
verbs have been yet acquired, verbs in declarative 
memory have associated a default activation value 
equal to the forgetting factor (RT). The fitness 
function used was the minimum mean square error 
between the participant’s error rate vector and the 
model’s error rate vector and the operators were 
Gaussian mutation, an intermediate crossover op-
erator and 1:5 ratio for the parent population and 
the offspring sizes. 

Results: The behavioral profile of every partici-
pant at inflecting verb forms was modeled by the 
architecture. The parameter values for each partic-
ipant’s model were computed as the average value 
for 10 runs of the evolutionary strategy, with a stop 
criterion of 200 generations. The global correlation 
between the participants’ and models’ error vectors 
was of 0.92, showing a very high fitting degree. 
The values of these personalized cognitive model 
data could aid to determine the status of specific 
cognitive structures and processes. The efficiency 
of the modeling process is not taken account since 
time is not an important constraint in this applica-
tion. 

2.6 Application of machine learning tech-
niques  

The final stage of the methodology has a two-fold 
goal: a) applying different machine learning tech-
niques to both the behavioral and cognitive model 
data and analyzing their respective informative and 
discriminant power, and b) comparing both kind of 
data and the combination of them in the diagnosis 
process. Variables used by machine learning tech-
niques are shown in Table 4. 

Variable weighting: Cognitive model data pro-
vided further information than behavioral data for 
discriminating between pAD and control partici-
pants. First, variables of both behavioral profile 
and cognitive model sources were ordered by five 
attribute weighting methods, given by RapidMiner 
(Mierswa et al, 2006), which weight variables ac-
cording to different criteria. Table 5 presents the 
ranking, computed by each method (Information 
Gain (I.G), Correlation (C.), Chi-square (Chi-sq.), 
Rule weighting (R-W), SVM weighting (SVM-
W)), and the average ranking for every variable. 
From this, we also calculated the average ranking 

66



for each information source and the global average 
ranking, seeking for statistical differences between 
sources.  

Figure 1 shows these average rankings with their 
standard deviations. In this figure, the variables 
related to cognitive model data have been indexed 
from 1 to 10 referring indexes from 20 to 30 in 
Table 4.

Table 5. Attributes sorted by 5 different attributes 
weighting methods and average rank (Avg.). The Index 

field refers to attributes’ index in Table 4. 

Behavioral data show that the most relevant var-
iables are mood, tense and aspect substitutions 
both in present and past tense forms of irregular 
verbs, overregularization in present tense and the 
percentage of correct past tense forms of irregular 
verbs. The group of behavioral data achieves an 
average ranking significantly lower (p<0.05) than 
cognitive model data using a two-tailed t-test. 

As can be seen in Figure 1, among the group of 
cognitive model data, the four variables with the 

lowest ranks present an average ranking of 4.6 that 
stand out on the six remaining variables, which 
have an average ranking of 15.83.  

Two of these four variables are related to the de-
clarative memory (RT and ANS, with indexes 1 
and 2 in abscises of Fig. 1, respectively) and the 
other two to the grammatical processing (γm and 
MTA-PM, with indexes 7 and 10 in abscises of 
Fig. 1, respectively). These results indicate that the 
major differences between pAD and controls rely 
on internal structures and mechanisms involving 
declarative memory affecting the retrieval of irreg-
ular forms and of their grammatical features as 
predicted in (Ullman, 2001).  

Predictive power: The full set of combined data 
had better performance metrics than individual 
data sets to correctly classify pAD. We evaluated 
the predictive power of data by four machine learn-
ing algorithms.  

The algorithms are applied on the behavioral da-
ta, cognitive model data and the combined set of 
behavioral and cognitive model data to assess the 
informative and discriminant role of every infor-
mation source in the classification performance. 
The cognitive model feature set is made only by 
the internal variables of the model (9 parameters). 
The behavioral feature set consists of the variables 
collected from participants (20 parameters corre-
sponding to six error categories for four combina-
tions tense-form). The third feature set is a 
combination of the two previous sets.

Figure 1. Average ranking and standard deviation for each attribute of the two attribute sets. 

The classifiers used are a Support Vector Ma-
chine (SVM), a Naïve Bayes classifier (NB), a 
Neural Network (NN) and a Decision Tree (DT) 
(Mitchell, 1997). All the experiments were run un-
der RapidMiner with its default parameter configu-
ration (Mierswa et al, 2006). To evaluate each 
algorithm’s performance, a leave-one-subject-out 
cross validation (LOOCV) was carried out and the 
sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative prob-
ability rates, and the Area Under Curve (AUC) 
metrics were computed. 

Table 6 shows the results obtained for each one 
of the four classifiers and each feature set. A de-
tailed analysis of all metrics confirms the im-
portance of cognitive model data either alone or 
combined with behavioral features. 

A one-way ANOVA test was carried out to 
check the differences among the performance of 
every classifier applied on each one of the three 
features set. Note that, given the preliminary nature 
of this study, the statistical power of them could be 
low. The SVM and DT classifiers improved statis-
tically their sensitivity results (p<0.05) with the 
use of cognitive model variables regarding behav-

ioral variables. Besides, DT and NN improved sta-
tistically their specificity results (p<0.05) with this 
feature set. The results are also better in sensitivity, 
specificity and AUC metrics for all classifiers with 
the use of complete feature set as compared to only 
behavioral feature set (p<0.05). The SVM and NN 
classifiers achieve sensitivity and specificity values 
higher than 80%, exceeding the threshold whereby 
a classification method can be considered a diag-
nosis support method (Plante and Vance, 1994). 
All these results confirm the relevant role of cogni-
tive model variables supporting the diagnosis of 
pAD.  

3 Discussion 

In this paper we present a general methodology for 
the diagnosis of cognitive impairments when an 
inflectional verb task is carried out and we apply it 
to the particular case of pAD. The performed study 
corroborates the underlying hypothesis that com-
putational cognitive modeling of a subject per-
forming that inflection task provides a more char-
characteristic and discriminant information than 

68



only behavioral information extracted from neuro-
psychological tests. In spite of the low number of 
patients and types of verbs used, the results ob-
tained in this preliminary study allow to identify 
significant differences useful for analyzing the re-
lation between pAD and the verb morphology in 
Spanish. Beside, computational cognitive modeling 
could be a useful tool to have some kind of access 
to the processes that underlie normal and impaired 
behavior and this information could support the 
diagnosis process.  

The average results of the five attribute 
weighting techniques rank informative ability of 
cognitive modeling variables above behavioral var-
iables for discriminating pAD from control sub-
jects when all of them perform an inflectional verb 
task. Besides, the full set of both cognitive model-
ing and behavioral variables lead to classifiers that 
improve sensitivity, specificity and AUC in com-
parison to only behavioral variables. All the results 
confirm the cross-linguistic generality of the pat-
tern found in English an Italian: pAD patients are 
spared at processing regular inflected forms but 
impaired at irregular forms. 

The methodology allows an individualized cog-
nitive modeling for each subject and the parameter 
values obtained from the model can provide some 
clues about the underlying areas or mechanisms 
affected by the disease and their level of effects. 
The methodology has shown its successful applica-
tion to cognitive impairments directly related to 
language like SLI (Oliva et al., 2013) as well as 
non-specific language impairment like pAD. 

We conclude that the combination of machine-
learning techniques with the information obtained 
through computational cognitive modeling could 
be a helpful methodology to support the diagnosis 
of pAD. Finally, it is important to note that this 
methodology is easily extensible to other lan-
guages, based on the language-independent nature 
of the mechanisms, parameters, representation and 
input vocabulary of the computational cognitive 
architecture used.
