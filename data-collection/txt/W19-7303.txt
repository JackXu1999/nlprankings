Abstract 

 
In this paper I describe how I used 

Intergaelic, an ad-hoc hybrid 

machine translation (MT) system, 

to pre-translate a novel and 

subsequently post-edit the 

resulting MT output.1 One of the 

central themes in the novel is the 

increasingly central role of 

technology in society. Thus this 

experiment can be viewed as a 

metatextual translation, whereby 

translation is aided by one of the 

themes present in the material 

being translated. I examine 

whether the translation provided 

by the MT system reached a basic 

standard that would reduce 

overall time for translation, and 

by how much. I examine the 

process of post-editing (PE) and 

how it differs from translation 

from scratch. I compare text 

generated by Intergaelic with that 

generated by widely available MT 

systems. I examine areas of 

weakness in this use of 

Intergaelic. I explore what 

elements remain the reserve of the 

human translator. I describe 

translating the entire novel using 

this method and how the author 

and publishers responded to the 

process of translation. I examine 

possible criticisms of this

1 Intergaelic (IG) 

 

Intergaelic was initially created by Kevin 

Scannell as an Irish-language standardising tool 

(for texts predating the standard language of An 

Caighdeán Oifigiúil, 1958) (Scannell, 2015). It 

was subsequently redesigned as an MT system 

for gisting of material in Scottish Gaelic (GD) 

for Irish-language speakers (2 closely related 

languages). IG is based on a corpus of 2.1 

million words. This is relatively small 

compared to corpora available for major 

language pairs, but likely represents a 

significant percentage of all bilingual texts for 

this language pair. I used IG as an ad-hoc 

translation machine as I predicted that it would 

aid faster translation. IG is both rule-based and 

statistical-based. In relation to rules certain 

clusters of letters are changed, ‘sg’ to ‘sc’, (as 

in ‘sgian’ to ‘scian’) and ‘chd’ to ‘cht’ as in 

‘seacht’ and ‘seachd’. While neural MT has 

improved greatly in recent years approaches 

that use probability remain superior in the case 

of languages that lack a large amount of parallel 

texts. 

 

Concern about the quality of MT for all 

languages, particularly around Google translate 

(GT) remains, despite significant 

improvements in recent iterations. Readers of 

Irish (GA) have even been acutely disappointed 

to find that certain books available online are 

the result of unedited MT. A poorly translated 

accepted academic practice. No use, distribution or 

reproduction is permitted which does not comply with 

these terms.

While neural MT has improved greatly the 

improvement has been less marked for under-

resourced languages. IG has the benefit of 

working with closely related languages. 

 

 I used IG in the present study as a tool 

to aid the speed of translation. An expertise in 

the source and target language are necessary. 

The accusation most commonly levelled 

against translation from English to Irish that is 

perceived to be of a poor quality is influence 

from the source language. IG cannot be accused 

of such influence as it contains only GA and 

GD. While the inner workings of GT are not 

entirely clear it seems that English is still often 

used as an intermediary step even when 

translating between major languages. 

 

2 Air Cuan Dubh Drilseach (ACDD) 

 

The novel in question is Tim Armstrong’s Air 

Cuan Dubh Drilseach (Armstrong, 2013) the 

first hard sci-fi novel in GD.3 The novel was 

awarded the Saltire Society First Book of the 

Year Award in 2013 and Scot Lit Fest named it 

one of the 5 most important novels in GD in 

2016. The book outsold all GD books sold in 

the 2 years previous to its publication.4 A sequel 

to the novel is currently being serialised in the 

GD literary magazine STEALL. Though Irish 

has a long history of sci-fi with Cuairt ar an 

nGealaigh appearing in 1923 and highlights 

such as Cathal Ó Sándair’s Captaen Spéirling 

of the 1960’s we have seen relatively little of 

the genre in Irish literature more recently (Mac 

Craith, 1923) (Ó Sándair, 1960).  

  

3 Metatextual translation    

 

ACDD describes a struggle against a 

supercapitalist society in which technology, 

particularly a fusion of AI and human 

intelligence, plays a central role. As IG is a 

basic AI my translation of the novel can be 

viewed as a metatextual translation of the novel 

whereby one of the central themes of the work 

is used to translate the work itself.5 This causes 

us to ask an interesting question, what else 

could be viewed as metatextual translation? 

What other themes might be used as methods to 

translate literary works? 

 

4 Comparison of Approaches 

 

I conducted some tests to compare the quality, 

speed and difficulties with the various 

approaches. I initially translated sections of the 

novel from scratch. I then pre-translated the 

novel with IG and subsequently edited the IG 

output. In both cases I aimed for a solid first 

draft, one that I was happy with on rereading in 

which the translation flowed and which showed 

no errors.6 The quality of the IG translation 

varied from sentences that needed no correction 

to others that needed to be rewritten entirely. I 

include below a comparison of sentences from 

the text.

5 The term ‘metatextual translation’ has been used 

previously in other contexts but I feel it is fitting to 

describe my approach in the present study. My search for 

a term was further complicated by the fact that the terms 

‘metathematic translation’ and ‘metatranslation’, which 

might also suit this role, have also previously been used 

in other contexts. 
6 This step of the study is limited in as far as translation 

and analysis performed was done by myself and was not 

blinded. In future, translations could be analysed by an 

independent professional translator.

Translation from scratch resulted in a freer 

translation in which the word order and 

sentence structure is more varied compared to 

the source text. The post-edited IG output 

follows the structure of the source text more 

closely. Translation is more long-winded at 

times and there appears to be a tendency to 

explicitation, information that was implicit in 

the source text has been added in the translated 

text. Translation from scratch is shorter for this 

sentence, likely due to the fact that I as 

translator wasn’t primed with certain structures 

by IG. The IG process more closely followed 

the structure of the IG text and therefore the 

source text.

Bhí an pláinéad dearg, 

Na Hasta, in airde ag 

breathnú anuas ar an 

triúr mar a bheadh súil 

mhór sna spéartha. 

 

The raw IG output is intelligible and largely 

grammatically correct. A relatively high level 

of GA and GD ability would be required to 

translate at this level. Some elements remain 

untranslated such as ‘an taca’. Older dative 

forms remain and gender is not corrected in 

translation. IG output post-editing, while 

differing from translation from scratch, does 

share many similarities. One of the issues I 

recognised, as MT had a role in the loop, was 

that I felt as a translator that I had to be 

hypervigilant to ensure any clangers caused by 

MT would not end up in the final translation. 

This concern remains despite subsequent drafts 

and was not felt in translation from scratch. 

 

5 BLEU score 

 

I decided to analyse the BLEU scores of the 

various translations generated.7 A BLEU score 

assesses how similar the raw MT output is to a 

from scratch translation. The score is correlated 

with human assessment. It is not based on 

language but matches words, and strings of 

words. It is in common use and has been 

described as objective. A BLEU score of 0 

                                                
7 I used Asiya developed by the Universitat Politècnica 

de Catalunya and available at http://asiya.lsi.upc.edu/ 

means that 0% of the text is similar to one 

translated by a human. 100 means that 100% 

similar to human translation. A BLEU score of 

over 30% is generally recognised as intelligible 

and 40-45% and above is recognised as the 

threshold for PE. 

 

The test passages translated in ACDD 

had a BLEU score of 35%. Despite not reaching 

the generally recognised level required my 

analysis found that the process of using IG and 

PE was faster compared to translation from 

scratch. This might relate to the fact that GA 

and GD are closely related languages. We must 

also remember that BLEU has its limitations. A 

highly accomplished translation might get a 

low score if it is very dissimilar to a given 

human translation. IG can prime the human 

translator with certain structures that are 

acceptable yet different to structures that the 

human translator would have generated from 

scratch. While GT has improved significantly 

in recent years a translation of these test 

passages done by GT in May 2019 was 

significantly worse than translations done by 

IG.

6 Productivity Comparison 

 

I next aimed to find out whether IG and post-

editing changed the speed of translation. I 

translated sections of 300 words from three 

chapters.8

IG and PE were 31% faster compared to 

translation from scratch. I must mention that 

processing in IG took a certain amount of time 

but as the entire text was processed in one go, 

the time spent per passage was negligible 

overall.9 It must be noted that the time spent in 

both translation approaches was spent very 

differently. With MT and PE less time was 

spent typing as most of the words required were 

had already been provided by IG. It was often 

easiest to move words around, to delete words 

or add a word. More time was also spent 

rereading the translation to ensure it flowed. 

 

7 Criticism of IG 

 

Translating from scratch results in more natural 

Irish, in these initial drafts at least. As I was 

starting with a blank page in translation from 

scratch, I moved from the word order and 

sentence structure and length of the source text 

more frequently. I felt that it might have been 

easy to leave sentences created by IG in the 

translation if they appeared to reach an 

acceptable standard, where I might have 

translated them differently if I had not been 

primed by IG. As basic as IG may sometimes 

seem, it recognised the correct sense of a 

                                                
8 This part of the research is limited in that it was not 

blinded. I did however ensure that I translated under the 

same conditions in both approaches, including 

performing the same amount of warm-up translation 

before translating passages and alternating which 

approach was used first. 

polysemous word that initially was missed by 

this translator. The word ‘dealanach’ I initially 

understood as relating to ‘lighting’, IG provided 

the correct sense of ‘electronic’. 

 

8 Elements where IG fails 

 

Many elements remain the reserve of the human 

translator. These included; proper nouns, 

chapter titles, regional accents, neologisms and 

interjections. The corpus behind IG lacks the 

data to deal with some of these issues and 

named-entity recognition is a recognised 

weakness of MT.  

 

Some elements relating to the structural 

differences of both languages presented a 

challenge. Tense in GA and GD does not map 

exactly to each other. The structure most 

commonly used to represent the passive voice 

of GD is the Irish autonomous verb whereby 

structures such as ‘Chaidh an talla a thogail…’ 

are translated by ‘Tógadh an balla’. 

 

Sometimes multiple translations of a single 

source word were given, the words ‘pasáiste’ 

and ‘halla’ were given for ‘trannsa’ in the same 

paragraph. Alternatively sometimes a single 

translation was given for multiple source terms. 

‘Bhí an duine cibirniteach gnóthach gnóthach’ 

was given as a translation for ‘[...]trang, dripeil’ 

in GD. Polysemous words such as ‘clár’ 

represented a challenge. 

 

Faux amis were a particular challenge, perhaps 

due to fact that GA and GD are closely related 

languages. Such words, despite being faux 

amis, often had semantic overlap and 

inappropriate use might be easily missed in 

post-editing.10 

 

9 Acceptability of literary MT 

 

MT software is currently the industry standard 

used for pragmatic translation of, for instance, 

info booklets, reports and textbooks. MT along 

with PE has been shown to be up to 42.9% 

faster and has been shown to increase quality in 

9 Many thanks to Kevin Scannell for assistance with this. 
10 The following examples were noted; ‘geal’ and ‘bán’, 

‘luath’ and ‘tapa, ‘an té’ and ‘an bhean’, ‘mullach’ and 

‘díon’, ‘lorg’ and ‘aimsiú’.

some cases. The subtleties of literature are of 

course more challenging. A project to translate 

Camus’ L’Étranger to English and Italian, 

found that the result with Italian was better. 

(Toral et al 2015). A significant amount of 

editing was required. But if the translation is 

finished more speedily and of the same quality 

is it not worth it? We know that globally 

translation demand is increasing. A script for a 

Harry Potter play reached the top of the 

bestseller charts in France in 2016 despite the 

fact that it was in English (Agence France-

Presse, 2016). In an increasingly globalised 

world, turnaround time for translation will get 

even shorter. MT might also represent a way for 

traditionally poorly-paid literary translators to 

increase output. 

 

What will happen to translators in this digital 

age of ever-improving MT? 11 The role is likely 

to change to that of literary post-editor. While 

such approaches are more likely to happen in 

popular fiction acceptance might take longer 

for perceived high-literature. I suspect that MT 

and PE are likely in use in some genres of 

literature already. My use of IG in this project 

likely resulted in thousands or tens of thousands 

of differences compared to the text that I would 

have translated from scratch. If two 

professional translators were to translate a 

given text of this length, you would likely see 

even more differences. I hold that my use of 

MT and PE as above is acceptable. I am 

concerned, however, that this approach would 

ultimately result in the demotion of human 

intellectual labour. I see no reason why MT 

alone should not ultimately be superior to 

human literary translation. 

 

10 Response of the author and publishers to 

translation approach 

 

                                                
11 I might mention that as a tutor in translation in an Irish 

third level institution in 2019 I noticed that GT 

outperformed all but one of approximately 60 third year 

students in translation of a short pragmatic passage from 

English to Irish. 
12 Translated from a personal email. ‘Tá sé sin thar a 

bheith spéisiúil agus, dar ndóigh, bheadh an-spéis againn 

ina leithéide de leabhar a fhoilsiú’ 
13 A previous translation from Scottish Gaelic published 

by the publishers had sold poorly. 
14 Translated from a personal email. ‘[M]á thagann 

cáipéis faoi mo bhráidse a raibh meaisín in úsáid leis an 

réamhobair a dhéanamh uirthi, ní gá go ndéanfadh sé aon 

The novel is currently being edited and a 

publisher intends to publish it. The publisher 

has a positive view of the project. ‘This is an 

extremely interesting [project] and we would of 

course be very interested in publishing such a 

book.’12 The text as post-edited by myself will 

be edited as a translated Irish text. This process 

would have also happened in the case of a 

scratch translation submitted to the publisher. 

Another publisher accepted the translation 

approach but decided against publishing the 

book on other grounds.13 

 

Although the present publisher had doubts 

about the process they were assuaged by the 

fact that the MT text would be post-edited by 

myself. The editor would be looking at the end 

product rather than the process. ‘[I]f a machine 

carries out preliminary work on a document that 

comes before me, it does not necessarily make 

any difference to me - I am only looking at the 

final product and not at the process.'14 

 

The author was extremely positive, perhaps 

unsurprisingly for someone interested in the 

genre of sci-fi. ‘As an author, and especially as 

someone who writes science fiction, your 

translation project was very appealing to me. 

Machine translation suits the theme of the novel 

very well, as well as the practical benefits. For 

me it will be interesting to see how the reader 

will accept it, knowing that a basic (AI) 

machine was involved in creating the text they 

are reading. But I am not concerned; I am 

looking forward to it. It is thought-

provoking.’15 

 

11 Conclusion 

 

I hold that IG and PE is an acceptable 

translation approach for a sci-fi novel. IG aided 

me in translating the novel 31% faster than a 

difríocht domsa — is ar an obair chríochnúil amháin a 

bheas mise ag breathnú agus ní ar an bpróiséas.’

translation from scratch. In sections of the text 

over 50% of the tokens remaining in the third 

draft had been provided by IG. I found that the 

standard was similar to translation from scratch. 

I recognised some issues with IG which are 

tractable and resolved in the PE step. 

 

I recognise that a principled philosophical 

stance against MT and PE might be warranted 

as MT is likely to change the role of translators 

to editors and ultimately take up their role 

entirely. The translation approach was 

acceptable to the author and to two publishers. 

 

In relation to further research a closer and more 

objective analysis of the varying approaches 

would provide a better understanding of the 

process. A blinded comparison with translation 

by an independent professional translator along 

with a review of my post-edited translations and 

translations from scratch would add to the 

strength of findings above. IG also exists for 

Manx Gaelic, the possibility to translate from 

that language could be examined in future. The 

approach outlined above might initially be 

more acceptable in translation of news articles 

and pragmatic text.
