Abstract

This study explores the organizing princi-
ples of sound inventories by examining at-
tested one-segment gaps in obstruent inven-
tories. Models based on different theories of
inventory organization are built and compared
in a computational task where models make a
binary decision to identify gaps and attested
sounds. Results show that segment marked-
ness, defined either in terms of grounded pho-
netic properties or typological frequencies, is a
good predictor of whether a segment is likely
to be gapped in an inventory. On the other
hand, whether an attested segment, compared
to a gapped segment, makes the feature rep-
resentation more symmetric or economical, is
not a good predictor of whether a segment
is gapped. Finally, artificial neural networks
that take inventories and segments as bags of
feature values outperform all aforementioned
models, demonstrating the extent to which the
task of gap identification is learnable from dis-
tributional properties in the data.

1 Introduction

Sound inventories of human languages are not
made up of random bags of possible speech
sounds. Proposals on inventory shapes such as
feature economy and symmetry (Clements, 2003a)
predict that a stop inventory like /p, t, b, d/ is more
likely than /p, t, b/ or /p, t, b, g/. Proposals on
markedness and implicational universals (Green-
berg, 1970; Gamkrelidze, 1975) also make predic-
tions on inventory shapes. For example, when a
language lacks a voiced stop, it is more likely to
be /g/ than /d/. When it comes to inventory shapes,
such proposals predict that /p, t, b, d/ is more likely
than /p, t, b, g/.

This study compares different models on the or-
ganizing principles of inventory structure by ex-
amining the distribution of gaps in the inventories
of obstruents across languages. A gap is referred

to as the absence of an [↵ voice] stop/fricative in
a certain place of articulation when a [�↵ voice]
counterpart exists in the inventory. The com-
putational task is a binary choice task, adapoted
from the cloze task in Cotterell and Eisner (2017):
between two sounds, the models have to decide
which is the ‘gap’, and which is the ‘foil’, an at-
tested stop/fricative that shares the [↵ voice] fea-
ture with the gap, with a different place of artic-
ulation. A model is more successful if it more
frequently identifies the gap correctly. Examples
of gaps and corresponding foils in Wogeo (Exter,
2003) is shown in (1)

This task can be seen as an approximation of
the task of identifying phoneme categories by a
human learner: The process of acquiring a phone-
mic inventory can be modeled as decisions to con-
struct abstract categories based on input that has
certain distributional property in an available ar-
ticulatory, acoustic, and/or perceptual space (e.g.,
Dillon et al., 2013; McMurray et al., 2009; Val-
labha et al., 2007). Take word-initial stops for ex-
ample, it has been found that sounds that differ
only in place of articulation differ on a continuum
of time-varying spectral properties 20-40 ms after
the stop release (Kewley-Port et al., 1983; Kewley-
Port, 1983). A human learner has to form cate-
gories along the such dimensions, based on a mix-
ture of bottom-up and top-down information. In
forming categories, the learner makes latent deci-
sions on whether some given types of sounds be-

long to a certain emergent or emerging category,
and whether sounds of certain types make up a dis-
tinctive category on their own.

Two major types of models are tested: The
MARKEDNESS and the FEATURE-SYSTEMIC
models. The MARKEDNESS models predict that
the gap is always more marked than the foils.
There are two variants of the MARKEDNESS
model in this study: The grounded markedness
model ranks the markedness of obstruents based
on their constriction site (Gamkrelidze, 1975): A
voiced obstruent is more marked when the con-
striction site is further back in the vocal tract. Con-
versely, a voiceless obstruent is more marked if it
is fronter. The typological markedness model uses
the frequency of segments and places of articu-
lation across inventories for ranking markedness:
the less frequent sounds are more marked.

For FEATURE-SYSTEMIC models, the gap is
the sound whose presence in an inventory would
decrease the overall goodness of the inventory
based on some feature-based metrics. Three
metrics are used in this study: feature entropy
(Mukherjee et al., 2007), local feature symme-
try, and global feature symmetry (Dunbar and
Dupoux, 2016). Feature entropy is taken as a mea-
sure of feature economy: the feature representa-
tion of a system is more economical if it can be
expressed by fewer bits. Local feature symmetry
measures the number of pairs of sounds in an in-
ventory that differ only in one feature, and an in-
ventory is more locally symmetric if it has more
such pairs. Global feature symmetry measures the
difference in the size of the plus and the minus
feature values in a feature system: an inventory
is more globally symmetric if the difference is
smaller.

To further investigate to what extent the place
of articulation of gaps can be learned from the
distribution of segments across inventories, arti-
ficial neural networks are trained to do the gap-
prediction task. The input contains inventories
represented as bags of segments, which in turn
are represented as bags of feature values. The
training objective to either choose a gap from two
sounds given the knowledge of the inventory at is-
sue (Inventory model), the gap and the foil (Seg-
ment model), or both (Inventory+Segment model).

Results show that MARKEDNESS models can
accounts for 65%-59% of the gapping patterns. In
other words, the gap is often more marked than

the foils (the attested sounds) either in terms of
their places on markedness scales defined with ref-
erence to speech production, or in terms of typo-
logical segment frequencies. On the other hand,
the FEATURE-SYSTEMIC models have worse per-
formance on average, showing that the decision
between a foil and a gap is not actively governed
by principles on the optimality of feature repre-
sentation. To locate a potential domain where
these FEATURE-SYSTEMATIC models may be ac-
tive, a supplement experiment is done and the re-
sults show that some of these Feature-Systematic
models are able to differentiate inventories with
and without gaps. Finally, artificial neural net-
works are able to be trained to perform better than
other types of models in this task, and the architec-
ture that utilizes information both on the inventory
as a whole and on gaps and foils performs the best.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows:
Section 2 reviews theories on inventory structure
in a greater detail. Section 3 describes the data,
task, and models in this study. Section 4 reports
results and analyses. Section 5 discusses the find-
ings and concludes the paper.

2 Theories on Inventory Structure

2.1 Segment Markedness
Gamkrelidze (1975) explicitly discusses how the
markedness of sounds affects the organization of
sound inventories. He proposes scales of marked-
ness at the segmental level, shown in (2), and
discusses how the scales account for attested and
unattested types of stop and fricative inventories.
The presentation of gaps in the inventory serves as
an important way to demonstrate his main points.
He proposes that voiced stops and voiceless stops
have the opposite markedness scales: whereas
labial stops are marked when they are voiceless,
they are unmarked when they are voiced, as shown
in (2). He also states that the markedness scales
with respect to voicing are the same for fricatives
and stops. Within voiceless stops, aspirated and
unaspirated ones share the same scale.

1975)

These markedness scales are used to predict at-
tested and unattested inventory types. The as-
sumption is that the presence of a marked element
predicts the presence of all less marked elements.
On the other hand, inventories where the certain
sounds exist while the less marked sounds are ab-
sent are predicted to be unattested. Examples are
shown shown in (3).

The markedness scales are described to be de-
rived from frequency counts of segments both
within and across inventories. However, these
scales can also be interpreted as being motivated
from the aerodynamics of voicing and voiceless-
ness in different places of articulation, especially
concerning stops (Greenberg, 1970; Smith, 1975;
Ohala, 1983). For voiced stops, a constriction
site that is further back in the vocal tract makes
the stop less optimal, since it is difficult to main-
tain voicing due to smaller space for air-pressure
buildup behind the constriction site. This moti-
vates why velar stops are more marked than bil-
abial stops. For voiceless stops, When the con-
striction site is further back in the oral tract, the
smaller volume of cavity behind the constriction
site makes it easier to build up air pressure, re-
sulting in a stronger amplitude for the burst of the
release, making the voiceless stop more perceptu-
ally salient. This motivates why bilabial voiceless
stops are more optimal than velar voiceless stops.

It should be noted that even though the ten-
dency to miss /p/ and /g/ both have aerodynamic
motivations, the extent to which these motivations
play a role in shaping inventory patterns has been
questioned. Maddieson (2013) shows that invento-
ries that miss /p/ have geographically concentrated
distribution around the Sahara desert, where the
major language families are Niger-Congo, Nilo-
Saharan, and Afro-Asiatic. He argues that such
clustering of these languages suggests that the
aero-dynamic motivation for inventories to miss
/p/ may not be valid, and areal factors may play
a better role in explaining the occurrence of such

inventories. Even though the present study does
not seek to address the issue of areal factors in in-
ventory shapes, the question that Maddieson raises
is still relevant, as it suggests that the explanatory
power of grounded markedness, thus defined, may
be weaker for voiceless stops.

2.2 Feature system and inventory structure

The notion of feature economy, according to
Clements (2003b), can be dated back to de Groot
(1941) and Martinet (1955). It is proposed as a
basic principle of sound system organization. It
refers to a tendency to maximize the number of
segments that can be represented per feature di-
mension, as shown in (4), where E refers to the
economy index, S refers to the number of seg-
ments in an inventory, and F refers to the number
of feature dimension necessary for representing all
segments in an inventory.

(4) E = S/F

There have been studies that examine feature
economy in attested inventories. Mackie and
Mielke (2011) finds that attested inventories in
P-base (Mielke, 2008) are more economical than
randomly generated ones, based on four different
kinds of economy metrics. Dunbar and Dupoux
(2016) also have similar findings with similar
simulation-based methodology.

Feature symmetry is another feature-based prin-
ciple of inventory structure. It states a preference
for sounds in an inventory to have symmetric dis-
tribution along feature dimensions. Thus it prefers
an inventory /p, t, b, d/ over an inventory such as
/p, t, b/. In other words, it can also be restated
as a dispreferrence for having gaps. Clements
(2003b) states that feature symmetry may be con-
ceptualized as a tendency for languages to avoid
having gaps in their inventory. This notion of
symmetry is further developed and tested by Dun-
bar and Dupoux (2016), where they propose two
non-equivalent but related symmetry metrics: lo-
cal symmetry and global symmetry.

Local symmetry in an inventory refers to the
notion that the number of ‘oppositions’ in the in-
ventory is relatively low or high. An opposition
refers to a pair of sounds that differ only in one
feature. An inventory is more locally symmetric if
the number of oppositions is high. Global symme-
try, on the other hand, refers to whether an inven-
tory is well-balanced among feature dimensions.

197



It measures whether the inventory has an imbal-
anced number of [+] and [�] values along all fea-
ture dimensions. It can be calculated by taking
each non-redundant feature, calculating the dif-
ference between number of sounds with [+] and
with [�], and summing the values across different
features, divided by number of features. A lower
value indicates greater global feature symmetry.

2.3 Segment Co-occurrence

Mukherjee et al. (2007) and a series of stud-
ies (Choudhury et al., 2006; Mukherjee et al.,
2009) approach the issue of principles in inventory
shapes by modeling the co-occurrences of seg-
ments in network models. In these models, each
node represents a segment, and the weight of a
node is the number of languages with that seg-
ment. The weight of the edge between two nodes
is the number of languages with both segments.
With actual consonant inventories from UPSID
(Maddieson and Disner, 1984), the model is able
to group consonants into communities that con-
tain homogeneous sounds such as dental, retroflex,
and laryngealized sounds. In addition, they also
measure ‘feature entropy’ within each commu-
nity, which calculates how many bits are needed
to transfer the feature representations segments in
group of sounds. They compare the feature en-
tropy of communities formed from attested and
randomly generated inventories, and find that net-
work drawn and weighted from attested invento-
ries have communities with lower feature entropy.
The finding shows that there are some regularities
in the co-occurrence pattern of sounds across in-
ventories.

3 Method

3.1 Data

This study uses the PHOIBLE database of
phoneme inventories (Moran et al., 2014), which
contains 2155 inventories, where the segments are
described by a phonetically detailed feature set.
Only [�soronant] sounds are used in this study,
which limits the scope of the study to a natural
class of sounds that are more homogeneous.

After filtering out repetitive inventories, 1874
obstruent inventories remain. From these obstru-
ent inventories, ‘gaps’ are identified by examin-
ing if an inventory lacks [↵ voice] stops and frica-
tives in certain places of articulation when the
[�↵ voice] counterpart exists. The corresponding

‘foils’ are identified, which refer to attested sounds
in an inventory that share the same [↵ voice] fea-
ture with the gap but with different places of artic-
ulation.

Example data points from Wogeo are shown in
(5), along with the obstruent inventory. Three data
points are generated from this inventory.

data point II: gap-/p/, foil-/k/
data point III: gap-/z/, foil-/v/

The computational task is an adaptation of the
cloze task in Cotterell and Eisner (2017): a model
sees each pair of sounds and labels one of the
sounds as a gap and the other as a foil based on
different strategies that each model employs. The
success of the models is measured by how often
the labels given by the model fit the actual data.

Models that require training, including the typo-
logical markedness model and the neural network
models, are trained on data points from 70% of the
inventories (training set) and tested on data points
from 20% of the inventories (test set). The neural
network models’ hyperparameters are tunes with
data points from 10% of the inventories (develop-
ment set).

3.2 Models
3.2.1 Markedness Models
Two Markedness models are included in this
study. The first one is grounded markedness,
which compares segments based bases on their
positions on predefined markedness scales. In
the current study, the scales are expanded from
the ones described in Gamkrelidze (1975), where
stops and fricatives share the same scales, and
voiced and voiceless sounds have inverse scales.
The scale for voiced stops and fricatives are shown
in (6).

*pharyngeal � *uvular � *velar �
*labial-velar � *palatal � *retroflex
� *post-alveolar � *alveolo-palatal �
*alveolar � *dental � *labiodental �
*bilabial

In the computational task, the model decides
that the more marked segment on the correspond-
ing scale is the gap for a data point. For example,
for data point III, /z/-/v/, from Wogeo, shown in
(5), the grounded markedness labels /z/, a voiced
alveolar sound, as a gap, since the avoidance of
an alveolar voiced sound (*alveolar) ranks higher
than the avoidance of a labiodental sound (*labio-
dental).

The other markedness model, the typological
markedness model, only takes into account the
frequencies of segments or places of articulation
across inventories in the task. In the computa-
tional task, the model labels the typologically less
frequent sound as the gap. This model has two
further variants: the frequency can either be cal-
culated based on the typological frequency of seg-
ments or of places of articulation.

3.2.2 Feature-Systemic Models
Three models fall into this category: global fea-
ture symmetry, local feature symmetry, and fea-
ture entropy. All these models rely on finding a
minimal feature set that is required to represent an
inventory, thus the algorithm to arrive at the min-
imal feature set is crucial. In this study, this is
done by first ranking the entropy of each feature
in the training/development set. In the process of
shrinking the feature set, features with lower en-
tropy are removed first, until the point where the
removal of any feature would prevent all segments
in an inventory to be unique represented. As a re-
sult, the resulting minimal feature sets are more
likely to contain features with high entropy, which
are features with a more balanced use of [+] and
[�] values in the data set.

For each of the FEATURE-SYSTEMIC models,
at each data point, the algorithm to find a minimal
feature set is applied twice: once to the attested
inventory, and once to the ‘alternative’ inventory,
where the foil is replaced by the gap in the attested
inventory. For example, for the data point /t-p/
from the inventory of Wogeo, the algorithm will
find the minimal feature set for /b, d, g, t, k, v, f,
x/ (the attested inventory) and for /b, d, g, p, k, v,
f, x/.

The three FEATURE-SYSTEMIC models can
then be seen as three different metrics to score the
attested and alternative inventories at a data point.
When the score for a metric favors the attested in-
ventory, the model ‘scores’ at this data point.

The metric for local feature symmetry is the
number of pairs of sounds that differ only in one
feature in a system. As mentioned earlier, such a
pair is referred to as an ‘opposition’ The metric for
global feature symmetry, on the other hand, is the
averaged absolute difference between the number
of sounds with the plus and the minus values in all
feature dimensions.

Feature entropy uses the metric proposed in
Mukherjee et al. (2007), which measures the ho-
mogeneity of segment ‘communities’ in a network
model. It can be seen as an information-theoretic
measure of the minimal bits required to convey
the feature representation of a set of sounds. The
metric is calculated as follows: for an inventory
with N segment types that are represented with the
feature set F , which contains multiple features f ,
where the number of segments with feature value
p is referred to as pf and the number of segments
with feature value q is referred to as qf , feature
entropy is

P
f2F (�

pf
N log2

pf
N �

qf

N ). The

interpretation of this metric is that an inventory is
more economical if it has a more skewed distri-
bution of [+] and [�] values or/and it has fewer
required features in the feature system.

3.3 Artificial Neural Network

Artificial neural network models are built and
tested to see whether the shape of obstruent in-
ventories is governed by some underlying co-
occurrence principle between features and seg-
ments.

The training objective approximates the task for
non-neural models: each item in the input to the
model is a pair of inventories. One of them is an
attested inventory, and the other is the attested in-
ventory with a foil being replaced by a gap. The
task is for the model to decide which of these in-
ventories is the attested one. It is implemented as
a binary decision task. Each data point appears
twice in two different orders.

Segments are represented as bags of feature val-
ues. Each feature value (e.g., [+voice], [�voice],
[+labial], etc) is represented by a 10-dimensional
vector that is randomly initialized before train-
ing and updated through back propagation during

199



training. The representation for a segment, also a
10-dimensional vector, is derived in the following
way: The vector representations for its feature val-
ues are first averaged. Then, the averaged vector
passes through a perceptron layer with a rectified
linear unit (ReLU) to obtain the vector representa-
tion for the segment. This gives the model to cap-
ture more complicated association between fea-
ture representations and segment representation.
The output representation for each segment is then
summed element-wise to obtain the representation
for the inventory, which is also a 10-dimensional
vector.

To investigate the role of inventory-level and
segment-level information in performing this task,
the are three variant architectures. In the Inven-
tory architecture, the representations for all seg-
ments in the attested and the alternative invento-
ries are summed before being concatenated and
passed through two layers before a softmax layer
for the classification task, as shown in Figure 1. In
the Segment architecture, the 10D representations
for the gap and the foil are concatenated, while in
the Inventory+Segment architecture, the inventory
representation is still the sum of segment repre-
sentations, but the 10D representation of the gap
and the foil, in stead of being part of the sum of
the representation for the alternative and the at-
tested inventory, are concatenated to the inventory
representation (thus yielding a 40D representation
before being passed into the hidden layers). This
ensures that the model has explicit access to the
property of the segments that are crucial for the
task.

Figure 1: The Inventory architecture of the neural net-
work model

For all three model architectures, hyper-
parameter tuning was done by a random search
through 100 combinations of size of embedding
dimension (between 10 and 50), learning rate (be-
tween 0.001 and 0.005) and L2 regularization

weight decay (between 1 ⇥ 10�5 and 9 ⇥ 10�4).
During training, training and development set ac-
curacies are evaluated every 100 steps. Training
stops when the development accuracy does not im-
prove after 500 steps. The best model in terms of
development set performance for each architecture
is used to report the result on the test set.

All the aforementioned training and testing pro-
cedures are repeated ten times over ten different
random divisions of the data into training, devel-
opment, and test sets. For comparison across dif-
ferent models, the performance of the MARKED-
NESS and the FEATURE-SYSTEMIC models are
also broken down into three different sets, with the
test set being used for comparison.

4 Results

The overall results are shown in Table 1. Among
the non-neural network models, MARKEDNESS
models generally outperform the FEATURE-
SYSTEMIC models. Among the former, the ty-
pological markedness model is the best perform-
ing one. In other words, the results shows that
two third of the time the gap is less frequent than
the foil. Grounded markedness ranks the sec-
ond, showing that 62.13% of the time, the gap is
more marked on the markedness scales than the
foil. Another variant of the typological marked-
ness model, based on the frequencies of places of
articulation, ranks the third just behind grounded
markedness.

The best performing FEATURE-SYSTEMIC
model is the global symmetry model, achieving a
mean accuracy of 55.91% in the test set. The local
symmetry model is almost at chance level, while
the feature entropy model is below chance, having
a mean accuracy of 46.36%.

The neural network models are the best per-
forming ones. The Inventory+Segment model,
which concatenates the inventory-level summed
embeddings with the embeddings of the gaps/foils
for the classification task, performs the best,
achieving a mean accuracy of 82.75% in the test
set. The Segment model that only uses the em-
beddings of gaps and foils perform worse, with
a mean accuracy of 74.89%, but is better than
the performance of the Inventory model, which
only takes the inventory-level summed embed-
dings. The fact that the inventory model can per-
form relatively well shows that this task can be
solvable to a certain extent by information pro-

vided by the inventory as a whole. The low per-
formance of the FEATURE-SYSTEMIC models do
not really show that inventory-level information is
not important for the task. It only shows that the
right kind of information is not extracted via the
feature-systemic measures.

Figure 2 shows the test-set results for all mod-
els, broken down in terms of segment types. Three
major trends are worth noting. First, the grounded
markedness model performs better in stops, es-
pecially for voiced stops. This is not surprising
given that the grounded markedness scales are bet-
ter motivated in terms of aerodynamic for stops
than fricatives, and the pressure to maintain voic-
ing in stops is considered to have stronger correla-
tion with constriction site in the vocal tract.

Second, the typological markedness models
have comparable performances as the grounded
markedness models in stops, but the typolog-
ical markedness model vastly outperforms the
grounded markedness model in the subset with
voiceless fricatives. There is a noticeable differ-
ence between the segment-based and the place-
based typological markedness models in voiceless
stops. The major reason is that since labioden-

quency (Place)’ refers to the typological markedness
model’s variants based on segments and places of ar-
ticulation.

tal sounds are overall less frequent when com-
pared with bilabial, alveolar, and velar sounds, the
place-based typological markedness model does
not account for the fact that /f/ is a frequent
fricative. Being a frequent sound among frica-
tives, /f/ frequently serves as a foil, and these
data points can scored by simply taking into ac-
count segment-level typological frequencies. On
the other hand, these typological markedness mod-
els struggle with voiced stops, presumably be-
cause of cases that involve /z/: /z/ is a frequent
segment, and alveolar is a frequent place of artic-
ulation. However, since /s/ is a lot more frequent
than /z/, it is very frequent for an inventory to have
/s/ but not /z/; when that happens and when the in-
ventory has a voicing distinction elsewhere in its
fricatives, /z/ would be a gap, and the typological
markedness models would struggle in such cases
because the high-frequency /z/ should actually be
a gap.

Finally, the result of neural network models are
similar to frequency-based models, especially in
the discrepancy of performance between voiceless
and voiceless fricatives. The Inventory+Segment
model is able to narrow down the discrepancy,

by taking sophisticated statistical patterning at the
level of both the inventory and thekey segments

For example, the dark purple bar in the ‘bilab’ col-
umn in the ‘Voiced Stops’ panel shows the fol-
lowing information: within inventories that have
at least a gap in voiced stops, how often they have
an attested bilabial voiced stop. The light purple
bar shows how often do these inventories lack a
bilabial voiced stop, which is defined as a gap in
this study. Finally, the palest white bar, which is
almost nonexistent for the ‘bilab’ column, shows
the percentage of inventories that do not have a bi-
labial stop but the absence does not constitute a
gap (i.e., the inventory also does not have a bil-
abial voiceless stop).

For voiced stops, foils are well-attested in the
fronter regions of the vocal tract. Constriction in
these regions supposedly makes maintenance of
voicing easier. On the other hand, a more frequent
distribution of gaps in the back region of the vo-
cal tract would be advantageous for the grounded
markedness model, which is true to a certain ex-
tent.

As for voiceless stops, the grounded marked-
ness model prefers a distribution where gaps are
in the front region of the vocal tract. This is
again true to a certain extent, as seen in the sec-
ond panel in Figure 3. For fricatives, the dis-

tributional patterns are not advantageous for the
grounded markedness model: The gaps in voiced
fricatives occur in the fronter region in the vocal
tract, contradictory to how the markedness scales
expect gaps to occur in the backer region. As for
voiceless fricatives, the high frequency of velar
gaps also goes against a preference for having gaps
in the fronter region. On the other hand, as men-
tioned earlier, the concentration of attestedness in
certain places of articulation for voiceless frica-
tives show why the typological markedness model
has an advantage in this subset of data.

Due to the sub-par performance of feature-
systematic models, a supplement experiment is
conducted to test the following hypothesis: The
feature-systematic measures do not account for
where an inventory may have a gap. They simply
measure a preference for inventories to not have
a gap. To examine this, I compare the feature-
systematic measures of obstruent inventories with
and without the gaps that are investigated in this
study: gaps in stops and fricatives.

The results are shown in Figure 4. To put all
three measures in the same graph, the feature-
systemic scores are z-transformed. Statistical tests
show that the global symmetry metric is signifi-
cantly lower in gapless inventories in the data set
[t(1871.9) = 5.91, p < .0001], suggesting a better
global symmetry for gapless inventories. Feature
entropy is also shown to be significantly lower in
gapless inventories [t(1860.6) = 7.46, p < .0001],
suggesting a better feature economy for gapless in-
ventories. These results may seem contradictory,

as feature entropy prefers the distribution of fea-
ture values to be skewed, while global symme-
try prefers otherwise. Further inspection shows
that gapless inventories requires a larger feature
set [t(1857) = 3.15, p < .01], and this potentially
explains why feature entropy and global symmetry
show the same direction: it is possible that feature
entropy for gapless inventories is brought down by
requiring fewer features in the system. Local sym-
metry, on the other hand, shows an effect that is
opposited as expected: gapped inventories have a
significantly better local symmetry value than gap-
less ones [t(1871) = 5.42, p < .0001].

5 Discussion & Conclusion

This study shows whether a segment is more
marked, either in terms of aerodynamics or ty-
pological frequencies, plays a role in deciding
whether a segment is attested or gapped in an in-
ventory. Crucially, the effectiveness of marked-
ness in this task correlates with whether a partic-
ular markedness scale has a strong motivation in
phonetic grounding.

Even though the problem of identifying gaps
is more directly related to the larger question of
inventory shapes, models that implement theories
that directly address the nature or tendency of hu-
man sound inventories, such as feature economy
or feature symmetry, do not perform well in this
task. This may suggest that the drive towards a
more efficient use of feature system, regardless of
how it is construed, is not active in identifying
what sounds should be phonemes in an inventory.
However, it is possible that these theories account
for inventory preference at a larger level, such as a

preference for attested inventories over randomly
generated sound inventories (Dunbar and Dupoux,
2016; Mukherjee et al., 2007). It remains to be
seen whether the effectiveness of these metrics can
be found at a level that is more accessible and re-
lated to phonological learning. As a starting point,
the supplement experiment in this study has shown
that these measures can differentiate inventories
with and without gaps.

The performance of neural networks with dif-
ferent architectures complement the findings for
MARKEDNESS and FEATURE-SYSTEMIC mod-
els. The good performance of the model that only
looks at the key segments (i.e., the gap and the foil)
shows that this task can be performed well to a cer-
tain extent by doing exactly what the MARKED-
NESS models are doing, and with a more powerful
statistical learner the result can be better. The per-
formance of the Inventory model, which looks at
inventories as a whole, also has good performance,
showing that considering the inventory as a whole,
without paying specific attention to the key seg-
ments, is also a viable way to perform this task.
Finally, the inventory+segment model shows that
the performance can be further improved when
key segments are highlighted while also taking the
whole inventories into account. It points to the fact
that there are indeed usable information in the in-
ventories at issue for deciding whether a segment
is likely to be gapped in those particular invento-
ries. The information is just not utilized by the
FEATURE-SYSTEMIC models.

To conclude, this study shows that segmen-
tal properties and statistical patterns both play
a role in shaping inventories in specific ways.
In terms of methodology, this study makes two
contributions: First, it demonstrates how a large
database of phonemic inventories can be infor-
mative in answering phonological questions that
may have ramifications for phonological learning.
Seconds, it shows that models that are theoreti-
cally informed and models that only use statisti-
cal information can join force to show corroborat-
ing results. Finally, if the computational task in
this study can be considered analogous to the task
of phoneme identification for a human learner,
this study suggests the potentially active role of
segment markedness for stops, especially voiced
ones, as well as the distributional patterns of fea-
ture values and segments, in learning phonemic in-
ventories.
