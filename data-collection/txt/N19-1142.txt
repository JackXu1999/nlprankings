Abstract
In online discussion fora, speakers often make
arguments for or against something, say birth
control, by highlighting certain aspects of the
topic. In social science, this is referred to as
issue framing. In this paper, we introduce a
new issue frame annotated corpus of online
discussions. We explore to what extent mod-
els trained to detect issue frames in newswire
and social media can be transferred to the do-
main of discussion fora, using a combination
of multi-task and adversarial training, assum-
ing only unlabeled training data in the target
domain.

1 Introduction

The framing of an issue refers to a choice of per-
spective, often motivated by an attempt to influ-
ence its perception and interpretation (Entman,
1993; Chong and Druckman, 2007). The way is-
sues are framed can change the evolution of pol-
icy as well as public opinion (Dardis et al., 2008;
Iyengar, 1991). As an illustration, contrast the
statement Illegal workers depress wages with This
country is abusing and terrorizing undocumented
immigrant workers. The first statement puts fo-
cus on the economic consequences of immigra-
tion, whereas the second one evokes a morality
frame by pointing out the inhumane conditions
under which immigrants may have to work. Be-
ing exposed to primarily one of those perspectives
might affect the publics attitude towards immigra-
tion.

Computational methods for frame classifica-
tion have previously been studied in news articles
(Card et al., 2015) and social media posts (John-
son et al., 2017). In this work, we introduce a
new benchmark dataset, based on a subset of the
15 generic frames in the Policy Frames Codebook
by Boydstun et al. (2014). We focus on frame clas-
sification in online discussion fora, which have be-

come crucial platforms for public dialogue on so-
cial and political issues. Table 1 shows example
annotations, compared to previous annotations for
news articles and social media. Dialogue data is
substantially different from news articles and so-
cial media, and we therefore explore ways to trans-
fer information from these domains, using multi-
task and adversarial learning, providing non-trivial
baselines for future work in this area.

Contributions We present a new issue-frame
annotated dataset that is used to evaluate issue
frame classification in online discussion fora. Is-
sue frame classification was previously limited to
news and social media. As manual annotation is
expensive, we explore ways to overcome the lack
of labeled training data in the target domain with

multi-task and adversarial learning, leading to im-
proved results in the target domain.1

Related Work Previous work on automatic
frame classification focused on news articles and
social media. Card et al. (2016) predict frames
in news articles at the document level, using clus-
ters of latent dimensions and word-based features
in a logistic regression model. Ji and Smith
(2017) improve on previous work integrating dis-
course structure into a recursive neural network.
Naderi and Hirst (2017) use the same resource,
but make predictions at the sentence level, using
topic models and recurrent neural networks. John-
son et al. (2017) predict frames in social media
data at the micro-post level, using probabilistic
soft logic based on lists of keywords, as well as
temporal similarity and network structure. All the
work mentioned above uses the generic frames of
Boydstun et al. (2014)’s Policy Frames Codebook.
Baumer et al. (2015) predict words perceived
as frame-evoking in political news articles with
hand-crafted features. Field et al. (2018) analyse
how Russian news articles frame the U.S. using
a keyword-based cross-lingual projection setup.
Tsur et al. (2015) use topic models to analyze is-
sue ownership and framing in public statements
released by the US congress. Besides work on
frame classification, there has recently been a lot
of work on aspects closely related to framing, such
as subjectivity detection (Lin et al., 2011), detec-
tion of biased language (Recasens et al., 2013) and
stance detection (Mohammad et al., 2016; Augen-
stein et al., 2016; Ferreira and Vlachos, 2016).

2 Online Discussion Annotations

We create a new resource of issue-frame anno-
tated online fora discussions, by annotating a sub-
set of the Argument Extraction Corpus (Swanson
et al., 2015) with a subset of the frames in the Pol-
icy Frames Codebook. The Argument Extraction

1Code and annotations are available at https://
github.com/coastalcph/issue_framing.

Corpus is a collection of argumentative dialogues
across topics and platforms.2 The corpus contains
posts on the following topics: gay marriage, gun
control, death penalty and evolution. A subset of
the corpus was annotated with argument quality
scores by Swanson et al. (2015), which we exploit
in our multi-task setup (see §3).

We collect new issue frame annotations for each
argument in the argument-quality annotated data.3

We refer to this new issue-frame annotated cor-
pus as online discussion corpus henceforth. Each
argument can have one or multiple frames. Fol-
lowing Naderi and Hirst (2017), we focus on the
five most frequent issue frames: Economic, con-
stitutionality and jurisprudence, policy prescrip-
tion and evaluation, law and order/crime and jus-
tice, and political. See Table 1 for examples and
Table 2 for the class distribution in the resulting
online discussions test set. Phrases which do not
match the five categories are labeled as Other, but
we do not consider this class in our experiments.
The annotations were done by a single annota-
tor. A second annotator labeled a subset of 200
instances that we use to compute agreement as
macro-averaged F-score, assuming one of the an-
notations as gold standard. Results are 0.73 and
0.7, respectively. The averaged Cohen’s Kappa is
0.71.

3 Additional Data

The dataset described in the previous section
serves as evaluation set for the online discussions
domain. As we do not have labeled training data
for this domain, we exploit additional corpora and
additional annotations, which are described in the
next subsection. Statistics of the filtered datasets
as well as preprocessing details are given in Ap-
pendix A.

Media Frames Corpus The Media Frames Cor-
pus (Card et al., 2015) contains US newspaper ar-
ticles on three topics: Immigration, smoking and
same-sex marriage. The articles are annotated
with the 15 framing dimensions defined in the Pol-
icy Frames Codebook.4 The annotations are on

2The corpus is a combination of dialogues from http:
//www.createdebate.com/, and Walker et al. (2012)’s
Internet Argument Corpus, which contains dialogues from
4forums.com.

3Topic cluster Evolution was dropped, because it con-
tained too few examples matching our frame categories.

4We discard all instances that do not correspond to the
frame categories in the online discussions data.

convert span annotations to sentence-level annota-
tions as follows: if a span annotated with label l
lies within sentence boundaries and covers at least
50% of the tokens in the sentence, we label the
sentence with l. We only keep sentence annota-
tions if they are indicated by at least two annota-
tors.

Congressional Tweets Dataset The congres-
sional tweets dataset (Johnson et al., 2017) con-
tains tweets authored by 40 members of the US
Congress, annotated with the frames of the Policy
Frames Codebook. The tweets are related to one
or two of the following six issues: abortion, the
Affordable Care Act, gun rights vs. gun control,
immigration, terrorism, and the LGBTQ commu-
nity, where each tweet is annotated with one or
multiple frames.

Argument Quality Annotations The corpus of
online discussions contains additional annotations
that we exploit in the multi-task setup. Swan-
son et al. (2015) sampled a subset of 5,374 sen-
tences, using various filtering methods to increase
likelihood of high quality argument occurrence,
and collected annotations for argument quality via
crowdsourcing. Annotators were asked to rate ar-
gument quality using a continuous slider [0-1].
Seven annotations per sentence were collected.
We convert these annotations into binary labels (1
if ≥ 0.5, 0, otherwise) and generate an approxi-
mately balanced dataset for a binary classification
task that is then used as an auxiliary task in the
multi-task setup. Balancing is motivated by the
observation that balanced datasets tend to be bet-
ter auxiliary tasks (Bingel and Søgaard, 2017).

4 Models

The task we are faced with is (multi-label) se-
quence classification for online discussions. How-
ever, we have no labeled training data (and only
a small labeled validation set) for the target task
in the target domain. Hence, we train our model
on a dataset which is labeled with the target la-
bels, but from a different domain. The largest such
dataset is the news articles corpus, which we con-
sequently use as main task. Our baseline model is
a two-layer LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber)
trained on only the news articles data. We then ap-
ply two strategies to facilitate the transfer of infor-
mation from source to target domain, multi-task
learning and adversarial learning. We briefly de-
scribe both setups in the following. An overview
over tasks and data used in the different models is
shown in Table 3.

Multi-Task Learning To exploit synergies be-
tween additional datasets/annotations, we explore
a simple multi-task learning with hard parameter
sharing strategy, pioneered by Caruana (1993), in-
troduced in the context of NLP by Collobert et al.
(2011), and to RNNs by Søgaard and Goldberg
(2016), which has been shown to be useful for a
variety of NLP tasks, e.g. sequence labelling (Rei,
2017; Ruder et al., 2019; Augenstein and Søgaard,
2017), pairwise sequence classification (Augen-
stein et al., 2018) or machine translation (Dong
et al., 2015). Here, parameters are shared between
hidden layers. Intuitively, it works by training sev-
eral networks in parallel, tying a subset of the hid-
den parameters so that updates in one network af-
fect the parameters of the others. By sharing pa-
rameters, the networks regularize each other, and
the network for one task can benefit from repre-

sentations induced for the others.
Our multi-task architecture is shown in Fig-

ure 1. We have N different datasets T1, · · · , TN .
Each dataset Ti consists of tuples of sequences
xTi ∈ XTi and labels yTi ∈ YTi . A model for
task Ti consists of an input layer, an LSTM layer
(that is shared with all other tasks) and a feed
forward layer with a softmax activation as output
layer. The input layer embeds a sequence xTi us-
ing pretrained word embeddings. The LSTM layer
recurrently processes the embedded sequence and
outputs the final hidden state h. The output layer
outputs a vector of probabilities pTi ∈ RYTi , based
on which the loss Li is computed as the categori-
cal cross-entropy between prediction pTi and true
label yTi . In each iteration, we sample a data batch
for one of the tasks and update the model parame-
ters using stochastic gradient descent. If we sam-
ple a batch from the main task or an auxiliary task
is decided by a weighted coin flip.

Adversarial Learning Ganin and Lempitsky
(2015) proposed adversarial learning for domain
adaptation that can exploit unlabeled data from the
target domain. The idea is to learn a classifier that
is as good as possible at assigning the target la-
bels (learned on the source domain), but as poor
as possible in discriminating between instances of
the source domain and the target domain. With
this strategy, the classifier learns representations
that contain information about the target class but
abstract away from domain-specific features. Dur-
ing training, the model alternates between 1) pre-

dicting the target labels and 2) predicting a binary
label discriminating between source and target in-
stances. In this second step, the gradient that is
backpropagated is flipped by a Gradient-Reversal
layer.5 Consequently, the model parameters are
updated such that the classifier becomes worse at
solving the task. The architecture is shown in the
right part of Figure 1. In our implementation, the
model samples batches from the adversarial task
or the main task based on a weighted coinflip.

5 Experiments

We compare the multi-task learning and the adver-
sarial setup with two baseline models: (a) a Ran-
dom Forest classifier using tf-idf weighted bag-
of-words-representations, and (b) the LSTM base-
line model. For the multi-task model, we use
both the Twitter dataset and the argument quality
dataset as auxiliary tasks. For all models, we re-
port results on the test set using the optimal hyper-
parameters that we found averaged over 3 runs on
the validation set. For the neural models, we use
100-dimensional GloVe embeddings (Pennington
et al., 2014), pre-trained on Wikipedia and Giga-
word.6 Details about hyper-parameter tuning and
optimal settings can be found in Appendix B.

Results The results in Table 5 show that both the
multi-task and the adversarial model improve over

nor improvements over the LSTM baseline, with a
bigger improvement in the micro-averaged score,
indicating bigger improvements with frequent la-
bels. The adversarial model performs best, with
an error reduction in micro-averaged F over the
LSTM baseline of 5.6%.

Figure 2 shows the system performances for
each class. Each bar indicates the difference be-
tween the F-score of the respective system and the
random baseline. The adversarial model achieves
the biggest improvements over the baseline for
classes 5 and 7, which are the two most frequent
classes in the test set (cf. Table 6). For classes
1 and 13, the adversarial model is outperformed
by the LSTM. Furthermore, we see that the hard-
est frame to predict is the Policy prescription and
evaluation frame (6), where the models achieve
the lowest improvement over the baseline and the
lowest absolute F-score. This might be because
utterances with this frame tend to address specific
policies that vary according to topic and domain
of the data, and are thus hard to generalize from
source to target domain.

Analysis Table 4 contains examples of model
predictions on the dialogue dev set. In Exam-

ple (1), the adversarial and the multi-task model
correctly predict a Constitutionality frame, while
the LSTM model incorrectly predicts a Crime and
punishment frame. In Examples (2) and (3), only
the adversarial model predicts the correct frames.
In both cases, the LSTM model incorrectly pre-
dicts an Economic frame, possibly because it is
misled by picking up on a different sense of the
terms means and risks. In Example (4), all mod-
els make an incorrect prediction. We speculate this
might be because the models pick up on the phrase
restrictions on handguns and interpret it as refer-
ring to a policy, whereas to correctly label the sen-
tence they would have to pick up on the violation
of the Second Amendment, indicating a Constitu-
tionality frame.

6 Conclusion

This work introduced a new benchmark of polit-
ical discussions from online fora, annotated with
issue frames following the Policy Frames Cook-
book. Online fora are influential platforms that
can have impact on public opinion, but the lan-
guage used in such fora is very different from
newswire and other social media. We showed,
however, how multi-task and adversarial learning
can facilitate transfer learning from such domains,
leveraging previously annotated resources to im-
prove predictions on informal, multi-party discus-
sions. Our best model obtained a micro-averaged
F1-score of 0.548 on our new benchmark.

Appendix A Data Preprocessing

For the Twitter and news articles datasets, we re-
move all instances that do not correspond to the
five target frames. Table 6 shows the class distri-
butions in the filtered datasets. We tokenize all se-
quences using spaCy 7, which we also use for sen-
tence splitting in the news articles dataset. For the
Twitter dataset, we follow Johnson et al. (2017) in
removing URLs and @-mentions.

Appendix B Hyperparameters in
Experiments

The hyperparameters for all neural models were
tuned on the online disc. dev set. We report test
results for the optimal settings found by averag-
ing over 3 training runs, which we determine by
the best macro-averaged F-score and smallest vari-
ance between the runs. We set the DyNet weight

Table 6: Dataset statistics and class distributions. The
frame labels correspond to the classes Economic (1),
Political (13), Legality, Jurisprudence and Constitu-
tionality (5), Policy prescription and evaluation (6)
and Crime and Punishment (7). # multi refers to the
number of multi-label instances. For Argument qual-
ity, label 1 indicates a score greater or equal 0.5.

decay parameter to 1e-7 for all neural models,
batch size is 128, and the word embeddings are
not updated during training.

For the multi-task and adversarial model,
we do a grid-search over the weight of the
coin flip used to decide on sampling from
main/aux or main/adversarial task in the range of
[0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8,0.9]. The optimal
weight for sampling the main task is 0.5 for the
multi-task model and 0.3 for the adversarial task.

All models are trained using early stopping (af-
ter at least 80 epochs of training) with a patience
of 5 epochs. The number of iterations (updates)
per epoch is a hyperparameter, that we set by de-
fault as twice the number of data batches for the
main task. For a fair coin flip, the models hence
see as much data for the main task as for the aux-
iliary/adversarial task per epoch.
