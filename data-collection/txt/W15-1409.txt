Abstract 

Metaphor processing has been a heated topic 
in NLP. Cognitive properties of a word are 
important in metaphor understanding and gen-
eration. But data collected automatically tend 
to be reduced in both quantity and quality. 
This paper introduces CogBank a database of 
Chinese concepts and their associated cogni-
tive properties. The database was constructed 
using simile templates to extract millions of 
“word-property” pairs via search engine over 
the World Wide Web. A method of manual 
check and correction was then implemented, 
resulting in the current CogBank database 
which contains 232,590 “word-property” pairs. 
CogBank also provides various search and 
visualization services for observing and com-
paring associations between concepts and 
properties.  

1 Introduction 

Metaphor studies in cognitive linguistics focus on 
the mechanisms of how metaphor works. Concep-
tual Metaphor Theory summarizes the types of 
mappings from source domain to target domain 
like “Time is Money” (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980). 
Blending Theory examines how the input spaces of 
two concepts blend new spaces (Fauconnier & 
Turner, 2003). Both theories emphasize the proper-
ties of a concept, which could be profiled in meta-
phor use. For example, money has properties of 
important, valuable and soulless that will help peo-

ple to comprehend time in the metaphor. Many of 
these properties reflect common cognitive 
knowledge rather than scientific knowledge. If 
such cognitive properties can be collected and or-
ganized, it will benefit metaphor generation and 
understanding in NLP. However, manual construc-
tion of such databases could be time-consuming. In 
addition, the properties of concepts may vary from 
person to person. Money may have more than three 
properties and each property could be interpreted 
in different ways. This translates into three key 
issues to be solved: (1) How to collect as many 
concepts and properties as possible; (2) How to 
assure the properties are acceptable to native 
speakers; and, (3) How to evaluate the importance 
of the properties for a given concept. 

Chinese CogBank is a database of cognitive 
properties of Chinese words. It has 232,590 “word-
property” pairs, which consist of 82,937 words and 
100,271 properties. The data were collected via 
Baidu.com, and adjudicated manually. Conse-
quently, each “word-property” type has an associ-
ated frequency which can stand as a functional 
measure of the importance of a property. 

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. 
Section 2 briefly reviews related work on collect-
ing cognitive features. Section 3 introduces the 
construction of the Chinese CogBank. Descriptive 
statistics, search visualization tools of the database 
are presented in Sections 4 and 5. Section 6 dis-
cusses the potential applications of CogBank and 
the difficulties with respect to metaphor processing. 
Conclusions and future work are outlined in Sec-
tion 7.

2 Related Work 

Collecting the cognitive properties by hand can be 
tedious, time-consuming and problematic in terms 
of guaranteeing agreement between different anno-
tators. Therefore corpus and web data have been 
taken as important resources. Kintsch (2000) col-
lects noun-adjective pairs like “money-valuable” 
using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) from large 
corpora. Roncero et al. (2006) extracts noun-
adjective pairs using the simile template “as adjec-
tive as noun”. Using the same template, Veale & 
Hao (2007) collects English similes by querying 
Google using the nouns and adjectives in WordNet. 
Then the data contribute to a lexical metaphor 
knowledge base “sardonicus”, which contains 
about 10,000 items of “noun-adjective” pairs. 
Veale et al. (2008) collects 25,000 items consisting 
of Chinese “noun-adjective” pairs from Google 
using words in HowNet. In a similar way, Jia & Yu 
(2009) collects Chinese similes from Baidu, yield-
ing about 20,000 “noun-property” pairs.  

At this stage, collection of “concept-property” 
pairs seems to reach a bottleneck in that it becomes 
difficult to substantially increase the number of 
valid items. The store of raw data collected is mas-
sive, ordinarily amounting to millions of items. 
Obviously, stores of data this massive contain 
much noise. Consulting each word in a normal dic-
tionary would be a simple and efficient way to fil-
ter out noisy data. However the cost of such an 
approach would be that many good candidates are 
eliminated as they are not in the dictionary. Using 
a larger dictionary offers only limited improvement 
because many good candidates consist of multi-
word expressions like “as sly as jungle cat”, or 
even appear as embedded clauses such as “(Some-
one who is) as sly as a fox is cunning and experi-
enced”. Due to such difficulties, a large cognitive 
database is currently not available. 

In addition, previous implementations have giv-
en little importance to word-property frequencies. 
It is important for a metaphor processing system to 
know how strong the relationship between the con-
cept and the property. If the system must generate 
a metaphor expressing something that is white, it 
could find the most relevant concepts like snow 
and paper using collocation frequencies.  
 
 

3 Construction of the Chinese CogBank 

Like Roncero et al. (2006), Veale et al. (2008) and 
Jia & Yu (2009), we use simile templates to collect 
Chinese “word-property” items by querying the 
search engine Baidu. The lexicon items in HowNet 
are used to fill the simile templates.  

3.1 Lexical Resources 

HowNet is a structured Chinese-English bilingual 
lexical resource (Dong & Dong, 2006). Different 
from the synsets in WordNet (Miller, 1990), it de-
scribes a word by a set of structured semantic fea-
tures named “sememe”. About 2200 sememes are 
used to define 95,000 Chinese words and 85,000 
English words in HowNet (ver. 2007). For exam-
ple, the Chinese noun 猪(zhu) is translated to hog, 

pig and swine in English. The definition of 猪(zhu) 

is the sememe livestock|牲畜 . A sememe is an 
English-Chinese combined label and is organized 
in a hierarchy. livestock|牲畜  has its hypernym 
sememe animal|兽 and higher hypernym sememes 
AnimalHuman|动物, animate|生物, etc. 

3.2 Data Collection 

In Chinese, there are three simile templates which 
can be used to obtain the “word-property” pairs: 
“像 (as) + NOUN + 一样 (same)”, “像 (as) + 

VERB + 一样 (same)” and “像 (as) + 一样 (same) 
+ ADJ”. We populated these with 51,020 nouns, 
27,901 verbs and 12,252 adjectives from HowNet 
to query Baidu (www.baidu.com). Different from 
Veale et al. (2008), we included verbs because 
verbs as well as nouns have concept properties. For 
example, “抽筋(cramp)” is a verb in Chinese. It 

has the property “疼 (painful)”, which refers to 
people’s experience in a cramp.  

We submit 91,173 queries to Baidu, allowing up 
to 100 returned results for each query. Then 
1,258,430 types (5,637,500 tokens) of “word-
adjective” pairs are collected. Within such a large 
data set there will be many incoherent pairs. We 
filter out such pairs automatically via the nouns, 
verbs and adjectives in HowNet, resulting in a re-
maining 24,240 pairs. The words cover 6,022 
words in HowNet, and the properties cover 3,539 
words in HowNet. The high quality of these re-
maining pairs provides the potential for interesting 

78



results. With the frequency information, we can 
see the top 10 most frequent pairs that fit the intui-
tion of Chinese native speakers (see Table 1).

Table 1. Top10 Most Frequent Word-Property Pairs 
 
It might be surprising to see that “苹果 apple-时

尚 fashionable” ranks top of all pairs. However, it 
makes sense because Apple (the brand) products 
are popular in China. “妖精 spirit” often refers to a 
young female demon/spirit who seduces people in 
Chinese fairy tales. The remaining 8 words repre-
sent ordinary things people experience in everyday 
life.  

3.3 Manual Data Check 

It is painful that in 5 million raw data only 24,240 
pairs are left when filtered by HowNet. As stated 
in Section 2, we find a more productive way to 
increase the quantity of the database is to manually 
check the original data item by item. 
To that end, we develop a set of guidelines for ad-

judication. We obtain four types of pairs from the 
sentences in the raw data. First, phrases like “as 
lazy as pig” contain good pairs, which we tagged 
as NORMAL. Second, pairs from phrases like “as 
valuable as ash” are tagged as IRONY. Third, pairs 
from sentences like “as soon as possible”, “as fast 
as I can” are tagged as ELSE. The last type is 
ERROR in sentences like “as lazy as…”. 

After the manual correction, 843,086 pairs are 
left. As shown in Table 2, 232,590 are NORMAL 
items, 1,351 are IRONY. The rate of IRONY is 
much lower than the English data collected by 
Veale & Hao (2007). The reason is not clear yet. It 
may due to the different simile templates used in 
two languages. The other two categories ELSE and 
ERROR are uninformative for present purposes. 

But we find some important phenomena in the re-
sults that will be introduced in section 4.2. 

 
Type Num Example 

NORMAL 232,590 as lazy as pig 
IRONY 1351 as valuable as ash 
ELSE 389639 as soon as possible 

ERROR 219506 as lazy as… 
SUM 843,086  

Table 2. Four Kinds of Word-Property Pairs 

4 Statistics 

We find the results after adjudication to be better 
in both quality and quantity, generating 232,590 
NORMAL pairs as the basis of the Chinese Cog-
Bank. In this section, we discuss the differences 
between the method of adjudication and automatic 
filtering of the data. We also present the descrip-
tive statistics of CogBank. 

4.1 Statistics of CogBank 

Chinese CogBank has 232,590 “word-property” 
pairs, which consists of 82,937 words and 100,271 
properties. The words cover 7,910 HowNet words, 
and the properties cover 4,376 HowNet words. 
This indicates that many more words and proper-
ties are gathered. Here we examine how much the 
results change compared to the filtered data in Sec-
tion 3.2. Table 3 shows the top10 most frequent 
word-property pairs in CogBank. The result is not 
substantially different. The first item has changed 
to “freedom-beautiful”, but “apple-fashionable” 
still ranks high in the database. Notably, the most 
frequent pairs are quite similar across automatic 
filtering and manual data check. In other words, if 
one only cares about the most frequent items from 
the web, automatic filtering is a fast and accurate 
method.

Next we explore what the most frequent words 
and properties are in Chinese CogBank. This is 
important as we could learn what the most com-
mon entities are that people tend to use as vehicles 
in similes, and the most common properties people 
prefer to express in everyday life. As shown in Ta-
ble 4, nouns like flower, man, water, child, human, 
cat, angel, wolf and sunshine rank the highest in 
the database. These words are quite common in 
everyday life and they have hundreds of properties. 
But the top 10 properties of each word dominate 
more than half the occurrences of these words 
when employed in a simile. This indicates that 
people always rely more heavily on a word’s sali-
ent properties to form a simile expression.

4.2 Valuable Information from Uninforma-
tive Data 

The manual data check drops many uninformative 
data which on the surface seem to possess no value, 
for example, “as stupid as you”, “as cheap as be-
fore”. The pronouns and time expressions have to 
be removed from CogBank. But through observing 
all the pronouns and time expressions through 
manual data check, we find something useful in 
Chinese sentences “X 像 (as) Y 一样 (same) A” (X 
is as A as Y) where Y is the reference object. As 
Indicated in Table 6, people prefer to use 我(I) as 
the reference object rather than other pronouns.

People also prefer to reference recurring and concur-

quencies.

The usage patterns showing much higher fre-

quencies for the pronoun我(I) and time expression 
往常, 平时(usual) suggest that people prefer to use 
their experienced everyday life knowledge to make 
simile or contrast sentences. This finding supports 
the Embodied Cognition Philosophy (Lakoff & 
Johnson 1980; Lakoff 2008), which hypothesizes 
that much of our conceptual structure is based on 
knowledge formed through physical and emotional 
experience.  

Work on this kind of knowledge is still in its 
preliminary stage, and presents the potential to ad-
vance smarter automatic metaphor generation and 
QA systems. 

5 Online Search and Visualization 

The web version1 of Chinese CogBank provides 
basic and visualized searches. Users can search for 
the properties of a particular concept or the con-
cepts associated with a specific property. We also 
developed a search service for English users. An 
English word like snow will be translated into Chi-
nese first with HowNet, and then the system will 
show its properties with English translations.  

The above search services are provided in ordi-
nary table form. We also use the Visualization

Toolkit D3 2  (Bostock, 2011) to draw dynamic 
graphs for the search results. The functions are 
listed as follows. 
(1) Generate the graph of properties for a given 

word. Or generate the graph of words for a 
given property. 

(2) Generate a graph comparing properties for 
given words. Or generate a graph comparing 
words for given properties. 

(3) Generate the extended graph of properties for 
a given word. The graph is extended by the 
words for the properties. Or generate the ex-
tended graph of words for a given property. 
The graph is extended by the properties for 
the words. 

(4) Generate the graph of properties for a given 
word with sememes in HowNet. 

(5) Generate the graph of properties for a given 
English word with translation by HowNet and 
extended by the sememes in HowNet. 

Appendixes A-E illustrate the visualization 
graphs. Due to the copyright of HowNet, functions 
(4) and (5) have not been made available online. 
Many more visualization functions are currently 
under development. We hope these online services 
will help linguistic researchers and second lan-
guage learners with their studies. 

6 Discussion 

Veale (2014) argues that such knowledge is useful 
for metaphor, irony, humor processing and senti-
ment extraction. The cognitive database with a 
large store of properties will be useful for both lin-
guistics and NLP. Nevertheless, we still face many 
challenges in developing a metaphor processing 
system. We now discuss some of the problems in 
using such a resource in NLP. 

(1) Cognitive properties cannot be used directly 
in simile and irony generation. It seems straight 
forwards but there are many complicated aspects 
of simile sentence generation. For example, if we 
want to generate a simile sentence to express that 
someone is very tall, we could simply query Cog-
Bank for the words having tall properties. Then we 
find words like mountain, hill, tree, giraffe, etc. 
We may say “Tom is as tall as a giraffe”. But it’s 
odd to say “Tom is as tall as a mountain” or “Tom 
is taller than a mountain” unless in fairy tales. 

                                                           
2 http://d3js.org/ 

However, when we want to express some building 
is very tall, we would choose mountain and hill but 
not giraffe. If we say “the building is as high as a 
giraffe”, it is more likely to be an ironic statement. 
So it’s obvious that the tenor in the sentence will 
influence or restrict the choice of vehicle. In simile 
generation, scientific world knowledge seems in-
dispensable. 

(2) Cognitive properties alone are not sufficient 
in metaphor understanding. If one says “Tom is a 
pig”, we have to indicate whether it is a metaphor 
or not. If it is, the cognitive properties will supply 
the candidate ground of the metaphor. The problem 
is that there are so many properties that the ground 
may vary in different contexts. Sometimes it is 
“greedy”, and sometimes it is “fat”. Reconciling 
such ambiguity and contextual dependency re-
quires a dynamic model for the context. 

To sum up, there is still much work to be done 
before we are able to completely integrate cogni-
tive word knowledge in language processing sys-
tems. 

7 Conclusion and Future Work  

In this paper, we introduced the construction of 
Chinese CogBank which contains 232,590 items of 
“word-property” pairs. Querying search engines 
with simile templates is a fast and efficient way to 
obtain a large number of candidate pairs. But to 
increase the quantity and quality of the database, 
manual check and adjudication are necessary. Us-
ing CogBank we identified interesting preferences 
people exhibit during production of similes in nat-
ural language. We also established multiple online 
search and visualization services for public use.  

In the future, we will make further investigate of 
the CogBank’s raw and labelled data. Second, we 
will compare the cognitive features across lan-
guages. Third, we will try to adapt CogBank for 
deployment in Chinese metaphor processing sys-
tems.

A. The graph of properties of 猪(pig). 
 

 
The word 猪(pig) is in the center surrounded by its properties.  

The width of the line indicates the frenqucies of the “word-property” pairs.

B. The comparison graph of 猪(pig), 猫(cat) and 狗(dog). 
 

 
 

The 猪(pig), 猫(cat) and 狗(dog) share some properties. 

84



C. The visualized graph of 猪(pig) with extensions by the propeties of 猪(pig). 
 

 
 

The 猪(pig) has many properties(yellow nodes), and these yellow nodes have their words(orange 

nodes). So the extendted orange nodes share more properites with 猪(pig) appear closer to the center.

D. The visualized graph of 猪(pig) with bilingual sememe labels from HowNet. 

 
The word 猪(pig) is in the center surrounded by its properties. Each property is linked to a bilingual 

sememe in HowNet (blue nodes).
