Abstract 

This work explores the relationship be-
tween the sentiment of lyrics in Bill-
board Top 100 songs, stocks, and a con-
sumer confidence index. We hypothe-
sized that sentiment of Top 100 songs 
could be representative of public mood 
and correlate to stock market changes as 
well. We analyzed the sentiment for po-
larity and mood in terms of seven dimen-
sions. We gathered data from 2008 to 
2013 and found statistically significant 
correlations between lyrical sentiment 
polarity and DJIA closing values and be-
tween anxiety in lyrics and consumer 
confidence. We also found strong 
Granger-causal relationships involving 
anxiety, hope, anger, and both societal 
indicators. Finally, we introduced a vec-
tor autoregression model with time lag 
which is able to capture stock and con-
sumer confidence indices (R2=.97, 
p<.001 and R2=0.72, p<.01 respectively). 

1   Introduction 
Many would agree that the success of top songs 
is due to a complicated mix of marketing, popu-
larity, and blockbuster theory in which compa-
nies invest big money into few products. Yet, we 
also hypothesized that the lyrical sentiment of 
top songs can be viewed as transient, but genuine 
snapshot of public mood. There is a plethora of 
research which unequivocally confirms both the 
influence of mood on music choice and the influ-
ence of music on mood and even buying behav-
ior (Areni and Kim, 1993; Bruner, 1990; Chen et 
al., 2007; R McCraty, 1998) 

While researchers have attempted to model 
public opinion indices and the stock market via 
sentiment analysis of news articles, microblog-
ging and social media sites, no research has tak-
en this correlation-seeking approach using popu-
lar song lyrics. We hypothesized that song lyrics 

from the Billboard Hot 100, a weekly listing of 
the top 100 songs, is representative of public 
mood. Moreover, we aimed to explore correlat-
ing, causal, and even predictive relationships be-
tween song lyrics, public opinion, and the stock 
market. 

Thus, we aimed to explore the sentiment of 
top song lyrics in a manner similar to researchers 
who used Twitter to ascertain public mood and 
correlated this sentiment to public opinion polls 
(Bollen et al., 2011; O’Connor et al., 2010). 
While Twitter offers a fine-grained time-based 
approach to harnessing public expressions, other 
mediums, such as popular song lyrics, may offer 
the same insight while being less costly to obtain 
and less susceptible to the “burstiness” of Twit-
ter. In other words, use of popular song lyrics 
would automatically filter out the noise of 
ephemeral, popular happenings which pervade 
Twitter. 

The Hot 100 listing is calculated based on a 
single’s selling performance, radio airplay audi-
ence impression, and online streaming activity 
(Trust, Gary, 2013). We explored if correlation 
would reflect in the Thomson Reuters/University 
of Michigan Consumer Confidence Index (ICC) 
and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), a 
major U.S. stock market index.  

For our work, we gathered the entire set of 
weekly Hot 100 songs between 2008 and 2013. 
We used OpinionFinder to analyze the positive 
and negative polarity of lyrics (Wilson et al., 
2005). We then used a second tool, WordNet 
Affect, to perform sentiment analysis along nine-
dimensions (Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004). 
We assessed the strength of sentiment correlation 
to the DJIA and ICC. We then explored poignant 
Granger-causal relations and created a predictive 
model for both societal indicators. In this work, 
we discover, there are indeed correlating and 
causal relationships between the song sentiments 
and these societal indicators.

2   Related Work 
Bollen et al. (2011) explored the notion that pub-
lic mood can be correlated to and even predictive 
of economic indicators. They used sentiment 
analysis of large scale twitter feeds and compare 
it with the Dow Jones Industrial Average over 
time.  High correlation results led them to create 
a neural network to predict the DJIA given their 
Twitter sentiment insights. They reached 87% 
accuracy in predicting the daily up and down 
changes of the DJIA. Similarly, O’ Connor et al. 
(2010) connected measures of public opinion 
measured from polls with the results of sentiment 
analysis over text on twitter feeds. They analyzed 
several surveys on consumer confidence and po-
litical opinion between 2008 and 2009 and found 
correlation between sentiment word frequencies 
in twitter messages.  

Acerbi et al. (2013) examined the usage of 
“mood” in the context of 20th century books 
written in English.(Acerbi et al., 2013).They used WordNet Affect 
to perform sentiment analysis on the literature 
and found evidence for distinct historical periods 
of positive and negative moods in American Lit-
erature. Further, these periods often correlated to 
historical happenings.   

Daas and Puts (2014) explored changes in 
the sentiment in Dutch public blogs and social 
media messages i.e. Twitter, Facebook and 
LinkedIn over a 3.5-year period.(Daas and Puts, 2014)They per-
formed sentiment analysis on the text and com-
pared results with changes in Netherlands month-
ly consumer confidence. They discovered a high 
correlation (up to r=0.9) and that changes in so-
cial media sentiment precede the consumer con-
fidence changes. 

While there has been much interest in auto-
matically determining the sentiment of songs 
from both acoustic and natural language pro-
cessing communities, there has been far less suc-
cess in performing the task. Xia et al (2008) pro-
posed using a sentiment vector space model in 
conjunction with a support vector machine to 
overcome the hurdle of lyrical data sparseness.(Xia et al., 2008) 
Other research has focused on combining audio 
and lyrical data for ascertaining the mood of a 
given song (Hu and Downie, 2010; Zhong et al., 
2012). 

While past work has looked at correlations 
between Twitter, literature, and other social me-
dia in regards to stocks and public opinion, our 
work looks at the correlation between the senti-
ment of popular song lyrics and these societal 
measures. There is an abundance of research 

linking the effect of music on mood and social 
behaviors including buying decisions and even 
it’s inverse; the role of mood in music 
choice(Areni and Kim, 1993; Bruner, 1990; 
North and Hargreaves, 1997; R McCraty, 1998; 
Sloboda, 2011). Due to the strong relationship 
between music and mood, we considered it to be 
a reasonable hypothesis that top music choice of 
the nation, via the Hot 100, could in some ways 
be representative of public mood.  

3   Dataset 
3.1   Lyrics 
The first step in preparing our analysis was to 
collect the song listings themselves. Our dataset 
spans six years, 2008 through 2013.  In order to 
perform this, we consulted the Ultimate Music 
Database (http://www.umdmusic.com/) which 
has the full listing of Billboard Music Charts 
songs available. We collected a total of 36,000 
song listings (with some songs being repeated). 
For each listing, we queried and scraped Lyr-
icsWikia (http://lyrics.wikia.com/) for actual lyr-
ics. The lyrical data along with full chart listings 
are available for public use by contacting the au-
thors.  

3.2   Societal Indicators 
For the purpose of this research, we examined 
two societal indicators; Dow Jones Industrial 
Average (DJIA) and Thomson Reu-
ters/University of Michigan Index of Consumer 
Confidence (ICC). The two were chosen due to 
their role in previously researched correlations as 
described in the Related Work section.  

The DJIA shows how 30 large publicly 
owned companies based in the United States 
have traded during a standard trading session in 
the stock market. It is the second oldest U.S. 
market index and is influenced by many factors. 
The ICC aims to measure consumers’ level of 
optimism towards their own financial situation, 
short term general economy and long term gen-
eral economy, according to their share of spend-
ing and savings (Curtin, 2004). 

4   Methods 
In this section, we describe our approach to find 
correlations between the lyrical sentiment of top 
songs and societal indicators.

4.1   Sentiment Analysis 
We chose to utilize two simplistic approaches to 
sentiment mining given the insight of past work 
showing the uniqueness of song sentiment classi-
fication. Positive results using the simplest of 
sentiment analysis techniques would be indica-
tive of opportunities for fine-tuning the sentiment 
analysis method for enhanced results. We per-
formed our first analysis of the lyrics using Opin-
ionFinder. OpinionFinder performs sentiment 
analysis by labeling words as either positive, 
negative, or neutral. It generates a text file that 
tags the words in the document with respect to 
their contextual polarity. Using OpinionFinder 
results, we calculated the polarity for a song us-
ing the following ratio: 

 

𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑦 =
𝑛𝑢𝑚_𝑝𝑜𝑠 + 𝑛𝑢𝑚_𝑛𝑒𝑢𝑡 + 	   .1
𝑛𝑢𝑚_𝑛𝑒𝑔 + 𝑛𝑢𝑚_𝑛𝑒𝑢𝑡 + .1

 (1) 

 
where num_pos, num_neut, and num_neg 

represent the number of words with positive, 
neutral, and negative sentiment valance. We used 
0.1 to accommodate smoothing in the case of 
missing values. For example, we could not au-
tomatically retrieve lyrics for a song in year 2008 
due to a mislabeling of artist in the lyrics data.   

We performed a second sentiment analysis 
using multi-dimensional sentiment classification. 
We found this step to be necessary in order to 
capture holistic public mood, which is rich, mul-
tifaceted, and not limited to bipolarity. For this 
we use the text analysis tool WordNet Affect. 
WordNet Affect labels a given word with one of 
over 300 possible sentiment labels. Labels fall 
under distinct hierarchies. These hierarchies in-
clude: emotion, mood, trait, cognitive state, 
physical state, hedonic signal, emotion eliciting, 
situation, emotional response, behavior, attitude, 
and sensation. Our analysis exclusively considers 
labels branching under the emotion hierarchy.  

We automatically labelled and aggregated 
the lyrical data on a weekly basis. Moreover, af-
ter retrieving labels, we narrowed our focus to 
the seven most frequently occurring given the 
sentiment analysis results. The seven labels are 
as follows: anxiety, anger, expectation, dislike, 
joy, negative fear, and sorrow. The ambiguous 
expectation sentiment can be seen as a measure 
of hope or fever in the lyrics. Further, negative 

fear is distinguished in contrast to fear, which 
may also signify reverence. Finally, we included 
positive emotion and negative emotion to com-
pare to OpinionFinder’s polarity results. 

In order to effectively compare the range of 
sentiment counts and the societal indicators, each 
time series was normalized to their z-score using 
the overall mean and standard deviation. The 
normalization allows all time series to fluctuate 
around a zero mean and be expressed on the 
scale of a single standard deviation. The Z score 
of time series X is denotes ZX is defined as: 
 

𝑍6 =
𝑋8 − 𝑋
𝜎

 (2) 

where 𝑋 and 𝜎 represent the mean and standard 
deviation of the X time series. 

4.2   Correlation Analysis 
We began by examining the Pearson Correlation 
Coefficient for the sentiment time series in com-
parison to the societal indicator data. Pearson's 
correlation coefficient (r) measures the strength 
of the association between two quantitative, con-
tinuous variables. The Pearson correlation analy-
sis allowed us to quantitatively determine the 
relationship between the societal indicators and 
sentiments. Graphical plots of the time series for 
each lyrical sentiment method and each societal 
indicator afforded opportunity for visual correla-
tion analysis and cross validation of our senti-
ment analysis findings to known socio-cultural 
events. Additionally, 

We then measured the correlation between 
the trend obtained from our sentiment analysis 
and each societal indicator using multiple regres-
sion. The regression model is shown below: 

𝑌< = 𝛼 + 𝛽?𝑋? + 𝜀8

A

?BC

 (3) 

 
where i=1,2 and Yi is the societal indicator trend 
and N=9, X1, X2,…XN represent the mood time 
series obtained from the multi-dimensional sen-
timent analysis.  The regression model allows us 
to further quantify any relation between the lyri-
cal sentiment and societal indicators.

5   Results 
5.1   Polarity-Based Sentiment Correlations 
We quantified the correlation between the song 
polarity and the societal indicators using the 
Pearson Correlation Coefficient and t-tests (used 
in order to establish the significance of the corre-
lation). As a baseline, we calculated the correla-
tion of ICC, the standard of public mood, to the 
DJIA (r= .6563, p<.001). We wanted to measure 
how top songs’ lyrical sentiments compared to 
this baseline as another measure of public mood. 
The results indicated that the lyrical polarity and 
DJIA have a significant negative correlation 
(shown in Table 1). However, the absolute value 
of the correlation coefficient is half that of the 
baseline, which indicates the association is not as 
strong. 

The plot of lyrical polarity for each week 
from the year 2008 to 2013 is shown in Figure 1. 
We compared it to the time series of societal in-
dicators z-scores also shown in Figure 1. There 
were little visual similarities between the plots. 
However, interestingly, we noted that the polari-
ty plot is able to capture some of the trends of 
typical U.S. holidays. For example, the polarity 
exhibits local peaks of high positivity during the 
Christmas holiday time from 2010 through 2013.  
Similarly, the polarity reaches its lowest on Val-
entine’s Day of 2011, suggesting a time of nega-
tive feelings. In order to gain an intuition that the 
sentiment analysis system was performing rea-
sonably well and the dip was not due to inaccu-
racy of the system, we manually examined song 
changes between the two weeks. As expected, 
the Valentine’s week Hot 100 added several 

songs to the list which contained hints of nega-
tive sentiments in juxtaposition to themes of 
love. These included, Loveeeeeee Song by Ri-
hanna and Same Love by Macklemore, and As 
Long as You Love Me by Justin Bieber.

5.2   Multi-dimensional Sentiment Correla-
tions 

In addition to polarity, we also plotted the 
trend series for the nine sentiments of interest as 
shown in Figure 2. Visual inspection of the plots 
suggested a high correlation between anxiety and 
ICC. The anxiety seems to be almost a shift of 
the ICC with a three-month lag. Moreover, visual 
analysis offered another interesting insight. The 
anger plot exhibits a large rise during the time of 
the November 2012 Presidential Election. Fur-
ther, the peak of the anger occurs on the day fol-
lowing Election Day 2012 as shown in Figure 3. 
We examined the reason for this through manu-
ally comparing difference in top songs from the 
prior week. During election week, songs by Tay-
lor Swift and Kendrick Lamar entered into the 
Hot 100 listing. They introduced a variety of sen-
timents including anger, for example, in Swift’s 
song Stay Stay Stay she repeatedly uses the word 
mad to describe her emotional state in a dating 
relationship.

As in the polarity analysis, we also exam-
ined the quantitative correlation between the nine 
sentiments and the societal indicators using the 
Pearson Correlation Coefficient and with t-tests 
in order to establish the significance of the corre-
lation. The results of the analysis between the 
sentiments and ICC are shown in Table 2.  The 
result of the comparison between sentiments and 
DJIA is shown in Table 3. 

The analysis results indicated that anxiety is 
significantly correlated to the Michigan ICC 
(r=0.4761, p < 0.001) and the correlation is al-
most as strong as that between the ICC and the 
DJIA. Additionally, anger exhibits a correlation 
which is significant (p<.05) though not as strong 
and more difficult to ascertain upon visual in-
spection.  Surprisingly, joy, which may be seen 
as the opposite of anger, did not significantly 
correlate with the Michigan ICS.

The correlation results for the DJIA and 
nine sentiments shows there is an especially 
strong correlation between the societal indicators 
and both ambiguous expectation and negative 
emotion (p<.001). As the DJIA values increases, 
the ambiguous expectation decreases. We sus-
pected this trend may have been indicative of 
positive correlations with time lag. Further, both 
anxiety and joy exhibit strong correlation with 
the DJIA (p<.05).  Though several correlations 
where significant and strong, they were not intui-
tive as the visual plots did not align with either 
of the societal indicators. Thus, we deemed it 
necessary to explore causal relationships and 
time lag as described in Section 5.3.

5.3   Modelling, Causality and Time-lag 
In order to gain a greater understanding of 

the relationship between the multidimensional 
lyrical sentiments and the societal indicators, we 
performed multiple regression using the model 
described in Equation 3. The multiple regression 
models moderately captured stock and consumer 
confidence indices (R2=.61, p<.001 and R2=.52, 
p<.001). As expected, the sentiments with signif-
icant and strong Pearson correlations, anger, anx-
iety, ambiguous expectation, were all significant 
features for modelling each societal indicator. 
Additionally, sorrow was significant in model-
ling the ICC and DJIA while negative emotion 
was significant in modelling the DJIA. The re-
sults for ICC are shown in Table 4 while the re-
sults for DJIA are in Table 5.   

We discovered several non-intuitive correla-
tions, including the negative correlation between 
ambiguous expectation and the DJIA. However, 
this strange correlation could be indicative of 
positive correlation with a lag. Given this, we 
recognized that more fine-tuning of the model 
would better fit the societal indices. Further, due 
to the non-intuitive correlation between several 
sentiments and the societal indicators, we 
deemed it worthwhile to explore the role of time 
lag. With the addition of time based modelling, 
we also aimed to discover whether causal rela-
tionships existed among the sentiments and the 
societal indicators.  

 In order to accomplish this, we utilized 
the statistical concept of Granger causality in a 
similar manner as in Bollen’s (2011) Twitter-
based stock market predictions. The key intuition 
in Granger causality is as follows; if a variable X 
causes Y then changes in Y will be 1) be preced-

ed by changes in X and 2) be better predicted by 
using information from time-lagged X and Y 
rather than information than solely Y. In effect, 
Granger causality then tests whether one time 
series has predictive information about the other 
by checking for statistically significant correla-
tions between the time lagged X and the result-
ing Y.

Table 5: Multiple regression results for WordNet Af-

fect Sentiments vs DJIA 
 

We tested for Granger Causality given 
an X-month lag and found that there is signifi-
cant Granger Causality between several of the 
sentiments and the DJIA along with the ICC. The 
Granger causality test rejects the null hypothesis 
that the ICC does not predict both anxiety and 
ambiguous expectation. In agreement with earlier 
findings, we confirmed that consumer confidence 
Granger-causes anxiety with a 5-month lag. By 
visualizing the time lag in more detail, the corre-
lation between anxiety, ambiguous expectation 
and the ICC become quite clear. Moreover, we 

22



discovered that anger Granger-causes consumer 
confidence shifts. 

The use of time lag and Granger causality 
brought clarity to the prior findings in which 
ambiguous expectation was negatively correlated 
to the DJIA and ICC. Both the DJIA and con-
sumer confidence changes Granger-cause am-
biguous expectation, or hope, in popular song 
lyrics. They require minimal time lag, especially 
for consumer confidence. In effect, consumers 
listen to more hopeful music when stocks and 
consumer confidence are high. The opposite can 
also be said. The full results for Granger causali-
ty are shown in Table 6 and Table 7.  

We plotted several causal relationships with 
appropriate time lag in Figure 4. We note the 
visible alignment given the introduced time lag. 
For example, the time series of negative emotion 
and the DJIA frequently overlap or point in the 
same direction given that negative emotion 
Granger-causes the DJIA with a six month delay.

As a final measure, we added further pre-

dictability to our analysis through the use of vec-
tor autoregression.  Vector autoregression is an 
econometric technique that allows for multiple 
time series to be captured for linear interdepend-

encies. Vector autoregression is a natural exten-
sion of univariate autoregression in which more 
than one variable is able to lag. We obtained 
tighter fit models for both the DJIA and ICC 
(R2=.97, p = 0.0 and R2=0.72, p<.01). We then 
computed the mean square error of the predictor 
time-series on data from 2014 using VAR.  The 
model predicted the Z-score of either societal 
indicator and achieved greater success on the 
DJIA. The results are shown in Table 8. 

 MSE 
DJIA 0.109 
ICC 0.748

2014 data of societal indicators. 

   
Sorrow, with a five-month lag, was the most 

significant of the time-lagged features for model-
ling the DJIA (p<.01).  Unsurprisingly, sorrow 
also was shown to Granger cause the DJIA with 
a five-month lag. Additionally, ambiguous ex-
pectation with a three-month lag was significant 
(p<.05) in the DJIA model. The dual role of am-
biguous expectation in both influencing and be-
ing influenced by the DJIA is unsurprising given 
the prior research in music and mood and it’s 
inverse relationship. Similarly, ambiguous ex-
pectation (one-month lag), anxiety (one-month 
lag), and negative fear (two-months lag) were all 
significant features (p<.05) in modelling the 
ICC.  

6   Conclusion 
In this paper, we explored whether Billboard Hot 
100 lyric sentiment is indicative of public mood. 
We measured this by comparison to correlations 
with the Michigan Consumer Confidence Index 
(ICC).  Moreover, we investigated whether this 
type of public mood measure is causally related 
to both the ICC and the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average (DJIA). We analyzed lyrics based on 
positive and negative sentiment polarity. We also 
performed a multi-dimensional sentiment analy-
sis that examines nine emotions. Visual analyses 
of trend plots showed notable correlation be-
tween song lyrics sentiment and societal indica-
tors. Moreover, the Pearson Correlation analysis 
quantified the relationship between song polarity 
and DJIA to be statistically significant, though 
some correlations were non-intuitive.  

We confirmed correlating relationships 
through use of Granger causality and the intro-
duction of time lag. This revealed a Granger-
causal relationship between ICC and between 
anger and ICC and anxiety. We also discovered

Figure 4: Plot of the X-month time lagged sentiments and DJIA or ICC 

 
Granger-causal relationships between DJIA and 
hope. We presented both a multiple regression 
model and an improved VAR model that incor-
porate the multi-dimensional sentiment analysis 
components to DJIA and ICC. The model solidi-
fied our finding in regards to the role of anger in 
influencing the ICC and the role of sorrow in 
influencing the DJIA.  

In future work, we plan to improve our pre-
diction model by focusing on the features with 
known causal relationships. We also plan to ex-
plore other prediction models beyond VAR. We 
acknowledge that past work has shown that song 
lyrics use creative language, slang, and meta-
phors which typically are not accounted for by 
valance based sentiment analysis. We will inte-
grate these factors in our modeling of the senti-

ment of the song. All lyrics data can be retrieved
