Abstract 

This paper presents a method to discover possible terminological relationships from tweets. We match 

the histories of terms (frequency patterns). Similar history indicates a possible relationship between 

terms. For example, if two terms (t1, t2) appeared frequently in Twitter at particular days, and there is a 

‘similarity’ in the frequencies over a period of time, then t1 and t2 can be related. Maintaining standard 

terminological repository with updated relationships can be difficult; especially in a dynamic domain 

such as social media where thousands of new terms (neology) are coined every day.  So we propose to 

construct a raw repository of lexical units with unconfirmed relationships. We have experimented our 

method on time-sensitive Arabic terms used by the online Arabic community of Twitter. We draw rela-

tionships between these terms by matching their similar frequency patterns (timelines). We use dynamic 

time warping as a similarity measure. For evaluation, we have selected 630 possible terms (we call them 

preterms) and we matched the similarity of these terms over a period of 30 days. Around 270 correct re-

lationships were discovered with a precision of 0.61. These relationships were extracted without consid-

ering the textual context of the term.  

1 Introduction 

Internet users are producing 10,000 Microposts on average every second (internetlivestats 2015). Mi-

croposts are short messages containing few sentences written in several languages. These messages 

tend to talk about time sensitive topics (Grinev, Grineva et al. 2011) (Kwak, Lee et al. 2010). Microp-

osts are rich with terminology (Uherčík, Šimko et al. 2013), not only old and well defined terminology 

but also newly coined terms (Becker, Naaman et al. 2011).   

Building and maintaining an up-to-date terminological repository is very important for several ap-

plications (Daoud, Boitet et al. 2010), like machine translation (Vasconcellos, Avey et al. 2001), in-

formation retrieval (Peñas, Verdejo et al. 2001)… However, finding terminology (terms and relation-

ships) is a very difficult task (Cabre and Sager 1999), especially for poorly equipped languages, and 

when the domain is active and changing everyday (new concepts appear every day). Classical ap-

proaches in building terminology depend heavily on terminologists and subject-matter experts 

(Hartley and Paris 1997, Kim, Yang et al. 2005). This approach is very expensive (Gaussier and Langé 

1997, Davidson 1998), and it achieves poor coverage (Daoud 2010) because terminologists have lim-

ited capability and subject matter experts are rare for contemporary domains. Statistical approaches on 

the other hand are less expensive, but they need large and processed corpus/corpora. Besides, statisti-

cal methods might find a list of candidate terms without relationships, so mapping these terms into a 

lexical network can be difficult. Microblogs are massive and can solve the problem of the availability 

of a large textual corpus, however, these microblogs have little textual context (A micropost in Twitter 

is 140 characters only) and they are usually poorly written (Cornolti, Ferragina et al. 2013).  

134



We are working on analyzing terms that appear on microblogs over a period of time to monitor their 

evolutions. Our idea is that terms with similar histories (frequency patterns over a period of time) are 

probably similar. For example, if two terms are peaking at the same dates then there is a chance that 

these terms are used by the internet users synonymously. That way rather than using textual context 

(which is almost nonexistent in microblogs), we are using historical context to relate between terms. 

And that will make social media a legitimate source of terminology (terms and relationships). Building 

a terminological database is still challenging (Roche, Calberg-Challot et al. 2009), because terminolo-

gy must be standardized and must have a formal body to approve it. We are proposing to extract un-

confirmed terminological relationships (preterminology relationships) (Daoud, Boitet et al. 2009, 

Daoud, Boitet et al. 2009, Daoud, Kageura et al. 2010) rather than standard terminology. Preterminol-

ogy is considered as raw material for terminology that can be refined to produce standard terminology. 

Matching timelines for terms is a classical time series problem, where time series are searched for 

similarities. There are several approaches to search time series. The performance of these approaches 

depends on the application (Agrawal, Faloutsos et al. 1993). We use an algorithm originally used for 

speech recognition called Dynamic Time Warping algorithm (Sakoe and Chiba 1978) with a normal-

ized Euclidean distance function. This approach will not only measure the distance between timelines, 

but it will consider the slight shifts in the timelines. And this is very suitable for our application be-

cause related terms might not peak on the exact same days. 

This article is organized as follows; the following section introduces terminology evolution in big 

data. The third section presents our approach in finding historical similarity between terms. The fourth 

section shows our data collection method. The fifth section shows the experimental results and evalua-

tion, and finally we will draw some conclusions. 

2 Terminology and Preterminology in Big Data 

A term is a sign to describe a thought in a particular domain (Sager 1990); this sign is a lexical unit 

that corresponds to one or more words (Kageura 2002). According to the extended semantic triangle 

(Suonuuti 1997), a term corresponds to a concept and must have a definition. A terminology is the vo-

cabulary (set of signs) of a domain. Building a term base involves finding precise definitions for each 

term and connecting terms with relationships. Such process is difficult to achieve in dynamic domains 

and mediums (Gaussier and Langé 1997, Davidson 1998, Roche, Calberg-Challot et al. 2009). There-

fore, we propose to collect preterminology rather that terminology (Daoud 2010).  Preterminology is 

considered as raw material for terminology that can be refined to produce standard terminology. Pre-

terminology incorporates neology (Cabré and Nazar 2011) of new concepts with no standard terms.  

Social media posters associate a new concept with a sign (preterm) (Giannakidou, Vakali et al. 

2014). This association was not approved by a standardization body and this preterm may not have a 

specific definition. That is why we call it a preterm rather than a term. A preterm can be processed to 

produce a term. Social media content may associate two terms (preterms), which can lead to an actual 

terminological relationship. That is why in this paper we are investigating possible terms (preterms) 

and their relationships (preterminological relationships). Preterminology can be convenient for useful 

application such as IR and opinion mining, moreover, it can be used to produce actual terminology.  

Extracting knowledge from big data, such as social media generated content, is attracting more and 

more researchers (Chen, Chiang et al. 2012). Data provided by internet users can be used to find new 

trends, prevent diseases (Yang, Horneffer et al. 2013), detect crimes (Kandias, Stavrou et al. 2013), 

and predict future events(Bothos, Apostolou et al. 2010).  Extracting terminology or other lexical se-

mantic information from Twitter (Twitter 2015) or social media in general is an ambitious task 

(Federmann, Gromann et al. 2012). Many succeeded in extracting trending lexical units, finding collo-

cations, classifying tweets, and analyzing positivity/negativity of terms and tweets (Speriosu, Sudan et 

al. 2011, Zhao, Jiang et al. 2011, Daoud, Alkouz et al. 2015). These attempts consider the textual con-

text of lexical units. However, there is a limitation in using Twitter’s textual context as natural lan-

guage processing of tweets is difficult, especially for Arabic. Therefore, while there is a need and a 

possibility to extract real-time terminology from tweets, attempts are faced with challenges.. We are 

proposing a method that considers the textual and the historical context to extract terminological in-

formation and relationships. 

135



Traditional terminology has a specific definition that disallows the integration of unconventional re-

sources. That is why a classical standard terminological repository suffers from a lack of linguistic and 

informational coverage (Gallego Hernández and Herrero Díaz 2014), and it cannot deal flexibly with 

hidden or absent terminology (Daoud 2010). We suggest extracting unconfirmed terminological rela-

tionship between terms (preterms). These possible relationships will have a similarity weight indicat-

ing a possible relationship (translation, synonymy, acronym, hyponymy, antonymy, or other). 

3 Timeline Similarity 

We monitor the frequencies of possible terms each day. We create a timeline for each one. The 

timeline shows the daily frequencies of the preterm.  These timelines illustrate the peaks, bottoms, and 

possibly the coining date of a preterm. Figure (1) shows the timeline for “اقتحام القصى” (Al-Aqsa raid). 

We can see that the term has peaked on 13 September 2015 with 11,800 frequencies.  

The tool used to produce the figure is an online Arabic social media monitoring platform built by 

the second author. We studied a small set of Arabic preterms and we observed similarities between the 

timelines of related ones. Figure (2) shows the timelines of “ ط , اوبكاسعار النف ” (OPEC, oil prices). We 

can see similarity in the frequencies during the period from 25 August 2015 to 29 September 2015. 

The similarity between terms can occur due to one of the following reasons: 

1. Term collocation: terms that co-occur to convey certain meaning, figure 3 shows an example. 
2. Event co-occurrence:  separate events happened at the same time. Each event has related terms 

that might produce similar timelines.  

3. Same event with different concepts (related terms); Figure (4) shows an example. 
4. Same or similar concept with different lexical units (translation, synonymy, acronym, hypon-

ymy, antinomy, hypernymy). Figure (5) shows an example. 

 
Figure 1. Timeline example for the term “اقتحام القصى” (Al-Aqsa raid) 

Our objective based on these observations is to search for similar timelines to build a candidate set 

of relationships between new terms (preterms) extracted from the community of Arabic social media.

3.1 Time-series similarity search 

Similarity search in timelines (time-series) is an interesting research direction to analyze stock prices 

data, weather forecast, biomedical measurements, etc. While there are several methods to find simi-

larity between time series, the choice of a particular method is an application-dependent. Therefore, 

we are testing our hypothesis with a standard Dynamic Time Warping (Berndt and Clifford 1994) al-

gorithm to measure the similarity between terms. There are several approaches that depend on the ap-

plication. In our case the approach we need to use must consider the following assumptions: 

1. Suppose that t1 and t2 are two timelines for two terms. t1 and t2 are similar if they have simi-
lar shapes. For example, figure (4, from 12/9 to 17/9) shows different frequencies between the 

two timelines. However, the shapes are similar. 

2. Similar terms might not peak in the exact same day. t1 could peak in a particular day and the 
other t2 might peek in the next day. t1 and t2 are considered similar if they have similar peaks. 

3. The presence of the peaks is more important that their magnitudes. 
Dynamic time warping (DTW) is a technique that aligns two time series in which one time serie 

may be “warped” by stretching or shrinking its time axis. This alignment can be used to find corre-

sponding regions or to determine the similarity between the two time series.  

DTW focuses on aligning the peaks of the time lines without focusing on their magnitudes and it 

matches peaks even if they did not appear at the exact same time. This satisfies the assumptions men-

tioned above. DTW would consider t1 and t2 in figure (6) to be similar. 

 

Figure 6. Two similar time series 

3.2 DTW algorithm  

DTW is a time series alignment algorithm that was originally used in voice recognition (Sakoe and 

Chiba 1978) It relates two time series of feature vectors by warping the time axis of one series onto 

another. Given two time series X and Y, Where:  

X = x1 + x2 + x3 + . . . + xi + . . . + xn 

Y = y1 + y2 + y3 + . . . + yi + . . . + yn 

t1

t2

138



Algorithm 1 will produce the cost of aligning X and Y (warping them) the cost will be low if the 

two time series are similar. 

  
Algorithm 1. Standard DWT 

We start by filling a distance matrix DTW which has n × m elements; each element represents the 

warping distance between every two points in the time series. The warping distance between xi and yj 
is measured according to the following equation: 

DTW(xi, yi) = d(xi, yi)+ minimum(DTW(xi-1, yj) , DTW(xi  , yj-1),  DTW(xi-1, yj-1)) 

Where d(xi, yi) is a distance function to calculate the distance between xi and yi. This version of 

DTW satisfies the monotonicity, continuity, boundary constrains demonstrated by (Sakoe and Chiba 

1978, Keogh and Ratanamahatana 2004, Salvador and Chan 2007). We use the Euclidian distance as a 

distance function between xi, yi. So the distance will be calculated as follows: 

d(xi, yi) = | xi - yi | 

Frequency reading must be normalized to achieve meaningful results and to give more im-

portance to peaks in relation to the average readings of a particular timeline. A frequency 

reading f is measured according to this equation:  

Norm(f) = f – m 

Where m is the average of frequencies for that term and the returned value from the algorithm indi-

cates the cost of aligning the two normalized timelines. The similarity score described below indicates 

the possible similarity between the two timeline: 
Similarity(X, Y) = 1 – cost/max(n, m) 

Where cost is the returned value from the algorithm, n and m are the lengths of X and Y respective-

ly. High similarity score means the probability that the two terms are related is high. 

4 Data Collection 

We are testing our approach with timelines collected by an online platform that addresses Arabic so-

cial media content and provides a platform to collect, search, monitor and analyze social media con-

tent. The platform has many functions. However, we are interested in the production of timelines 

which are archived through the following steps: 

1. Data collection: Arabic tweets are collected using Twitter API. The online platform receives 
live feed from Twitter. Any non-Arabic tweets will be filtered. 

2. Indexing: tweets are analyzed and indexed according to the terms they carry. Arabic analysis 
component is used for stemming and tokenization.  

int standardDWT(X, Y) {  
// Where X = x1 + x2 + x3 + . . . + xi + . . . + xn and Y = y1 + y2 + y3 + . . . + yi + . . . + yn 
    Create DTW[0..n, 0..m] 
    Set the first row and column of DTW to infinity 
    DTW[0, 0] = 0 
    for i = 1 to n 
        for j = 1 to m  
            DTW[i, j] = d(X[i], Y[j])+ minimum(DTW[i-1, j] ,  

DTW[i  , j-1],   
DTW[i-1, j-1])     

    return DTW[n, m] 
} 

139



3. Reporting: the platform reports the frequencies for each term per time interval. Thus, we can 
build a timeline for each term.  

The online system is available currently at “http://45.33.23.107”. We are using its produced time-

lines and terms for our experiment.  

5 Experimentation and Evaluation 

Arabic tweets collected by the online platform during the month of May 2016 were analyzed. We se-

lected 630 timelines for the most popular preterms in that month. Then we searched for similarities 

between them. The produced relationships were evaluated based on precision and recall. 

The top 1108 relationships were rated by 2 evaluators (E1 and E2). Relationship between t1 and t2 

is considered correct if the two evaluators found that t1 and t2 are event related or if they found that 

there is a terminological relationship (synonymy, acronym, hyponymy, antinomy, and hypernymy) 

between them. Using Cohen’s Kappa coefficient (Cohen 1960) the inter-agreement score was 0.93 

which indicates  a substantial agreement between the evaluators. 

5.1 Precision 

We are trying to evaluate the precision of the similarity score according to this equation: 

Precision=Cth/Tth 

Where Cth is number of correct relationships with a score greater than the threshold th. Tth is total 

number of produced relationships with a score that is greater that th. When th is small the produced set 

of relationships increases but precision might decrease. When th = 0.85 the precision is 0.92. Figure 

(7) shows the precision in relation to the threshold. 

 
Figure 7. Precision 

As you can see the precision starts to decline when th is below 0.5. The similarity score proved to 

be a good indicator of a relationship between preterms. 

5.2 Recall 

Recall is measured in terms of number of correct relationships extracted by our approach. When the 

threshold is 0.65 number of correct relationships is 200. Figure (8) shows the recall in relation to the 

threshold. When the threshold is 0.6 the precision is 0.61 and 270 correct relation were extracted from 

630 preterm.

5.3 Assessment and sample results

without analyzing the textual context; Table (2) shows sample results.

Extracting relationships between terms is a challenging task that needs large corpora, and special-

ists. The challenge increases when the terms are time sensitive Arabic terms. Our approach extracted 

480 of relationships from 630 preterms with high precision; these relationships can be used in many 

applications, such as: 

1. Extracted relationships can be post edited by specialists to enrich Arabic term bases.  
2. Lexicon for social media analysis: auto microblogs classifications, auto tagging, sentiment 

analysis. In fact, we intend to use these relationships to dynamically extend a polarized lexi-

con for Arabic sentiment analysis. 

3. These relationships can locate newly coined terms on an ontological resource. 
The approach will be used on a larger scale to automatically discover related terms on-the-fly by 

analyzing online microblog feeds. The importance of this approach is that it does not rely on textual 

context; in fact many extracted relations were between terms that did not appear in the same tweet. 

Most of the wrongly extracted relationships were between key terms describing two separate events 

that took place at the same time. These errors can be reduced when the timeline is longer than 30 days.  

 

6 Conclusions 

We have presented an approach to extract terminological relationships between time-sensitive Arabic 

preterms. Our hypothesis is that terms that have similar history (timeline) are similar or related. We 

used Dynamic Time Warping algorithm to measure the similarity between terms. Our experiment pro-

duced 270 correct relationships out of 630 preterms with a precision of 0.61. The extracted infor-

mation is crucial because it maps time-sensitive terms into a wider terminological map.  The approach 

can be used to identify and connect terminology on-the-fly by analyzing microblogs feeds online, 

without relying on textual context (which is very limited in the case of online microblogs).
