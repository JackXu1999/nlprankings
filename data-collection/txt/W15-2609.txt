Abstract

National cancer registries collect cancer
related information from multiple sources
and make it available for research. Part of
this information originates from pathology
reports, and in this pre-study the possibil-
ity of a system for automatic extraction
of information from Norwegian pathology
reports is investigated. A set of 40 pathol-
ogy reports describing breast cancer tissue
samples has been used to develop a rule
based system for information extraction.
To validate the performance of this system
its output has been compared to the data
produced by experts doing manual encod-
ing of the same pathology reports. On av-
erage, a precision of 80%, a recall of 98%
and an F-score of 86% has been achieved,
showing that such a system is indeed fea-
sible.

1 Introduction

Cancer is a common cause for death worldwide,
with about 14 million new cases each year (World
Health Organization, 2014). In the Nordic coun-
tries it is mandatory to report each incidence of
cancer to national registries and in Norway, the re-
ported data is handled by the Cancer Registry of
Norway, (Kreftregisteret i Oslo). The registry has
as its main functions to monitor the cancer preva-
lence in Norway by collecting data on all inci-
dences of cancer, and also to make this data avail-
able for research (Ministry of Health and Care Ser-
vices, 2001). In 2013, there were about 30,000
new cases of cancer in Norway, the most common
cancer type for women being breast cancer with
3,220 new cases, and the most common type for
men being prostate cancer with 4,836 new cases
(Cancer Registry of Norway, 2015).

Part of the data that the Cancer Registry of Nor-
way handles originates from pathology reports. A

pathology report is written by a pathologist exam-
ining a tissue sample from a patient with known or
suspected cancer and the report contains a number
of test results, measurements and descriptions of
the sample.

The National Cancer Registry of Norway re-
ceives about 180,000 pathology reports each year
and 25 full time expert coders transfer data from
the free text reports to a database via an XML tem-
plate. The manual encoding of the pathology re-
ports requires special knowledge for each cancer
type and the transferal is a complicated and time
consuming task where the coders have to read and
interpret the content of each report.

There is therefore a need of a system capable
of automatic information extraction. The system
should be able to accurately extract the relevant
fields for each type of cancer.

2 Related research

Several studies have been performed on informa-
tion extraction in the domain of pathology reports
with the aim to structure their contents (Spasic et
al., 2014). Rule based systems and machine learn-
ing systems are both used, and in some cases in
combination. Coden et al. (2009) built a model
called Cancer Disease Knowledge Representation
Model, which has nine classes including anatom-
ical site, histology, and metastatic tumor. Evalua-
tion found that recall was between 76% and 100%
and precision was between 72% and 100% for all
classes except metastatic tumor where both preci-
sion and recall were lower.

Kavuluru et al. (2013) extracted the anatomical
location of neoplasms from pathology reports de-
scribing several types of cancers. They achieved
an average micro F-score of 90% and an average
macro F-score of 72%.

Xu et al. (2004), used the MedLee system to
analyze breast cancer pathology reports and had a
performance for tabular findings of 95.8% sensi-

73



tivity (recall) and 95.4% precision. For narrative
text these numbers became lower with 90.6% sen-
sitivity (recall) and 91.6% precision.

Currie et al. (2006), constructed a rule based
system to extract concepts from 5,826 breast can-
cer and 2,838 prostate cancer pathology reports.
The authors obtained around 90-95% accuracy for
most of the 80 extracted fields, using domain ex-
perts for the evaluation.

Ou and Patrick (2014) studied pathology reports
concerning primary cutaneous melanomas. They
used both rule and machine learning based ap-
proaches. Their system was evaluated on 97 re-
ports and they obtained an average F-score of 85%
on identifying 28 different concepts including di-
agnosis, size and laterality and tumor thickness.

Schadow and McDonald (2003), used 275 sur-
gical pathology reports in their experiments. Their
regular expression based parser identified around
90% of the codings correctly.

McCowan et al. (2007), Nguyen et al. (2010)
and Martı́nez et al. (2014) use text mining to per-
form cancer classification according to the TNM-
scale (Tumor Node Metastases) (Wittekind et al.,
2014).

McCowan et al. (2007), trained on 710 pathol-
ogy reports for lung cancer using the SVM algo-
rithm and evaluated on 179 reports. They obtained
an accuracy of 74% for tumor staging and 87% for
node Staging. Nguyen et al. (2010), developed a
rule based staging system for lung cancer using
100 lung cancer pathology reports and evaluated
it on 718 reports. The authors obtained an ac-
curacy of 72%, 78%, and 94% for tumor, node,
and metastases staging, respectively. Martı́nez et
al. (2014), obtained F-scores of 81%, 85%, and
94% for staging tumor, node, and metastases re-
spectively for colorectal cancer pathology reports.
The authors used 200 pathology reports for train-
ing and evaluation.

Although closely related and relevant to this
study, these studies are all performed on pathol-
ogy reports in English; therefore the systems are
not directly applicable to the Norwegian reports.
To the best of our knowledge, only one study of
information extraction from Norwegian pathology
reports exists. Singh et al. (2015) used 25 pathol-
ogy reports related to prostate cancer as input data.
They used SAS Institute software to extract fields
and they report a percentage of correctly extracted
fields of 76% for number of biopsies, 24% for

number of biopsies containing tumor tissue, and
100% for Gleason score. The study focuses on
system development and it is not clear if they di-
vided the data into a development set and a test
set.

3 Material and methods

The Cancer Registry of Norway has selected a set
of 40 pathology reports in XML-format for this
pre-study. The reports have been manually de-
identified by the registry and fields identifying in-
dividual patients have been removed.

The content of a pathology report depends on
the procedure that produced the tissue sample. For
this study the selected report types are mastec-
tomy, where the whole breast is removed, and
breast-conserving surgery, where a smaller piece
is removed. Figure 1 shows an example of a por-
tion of free text from a pathology report. It de-
scribes a tissue sample with invasive ductal carci-
noma and ductal carcinoma in situ, and the mea-
sured margins around both the invasive carcinoma
and the carcinoma in situ. It also mentions the per-
centage of estrogen receptor positive cells, proges-
terone positive cells and the presence of the Ki67
marker.

A program for extracting free text fields and
encoded data fields from the XML-files has been
written, and the input text has been divided into
tokens using a custom program. A token corre-
sponds to a unit of text, which can be a word, a
number or punctuation sign, percentage sign etc.
The number of tokens in the reports is ranging
from 107 to 1,203 tokens with a median of 531 to-
kens. There are 22,670 tokens in total in the input
data.

Input text and corresponding encoding

The pathology reports used in this study consist of
two parts, the free text part written by a pathol-
ogist and the encoding of the same report per-
formed by an expert coder. Each encoded field
and its possible values are described in the inter-
nal requirements defined by the registry (Kreftreg-
isteret, 2014). The requirements do, however, not
say anything about how the pathologists should
write their reports; the input text is therefore not
as well defined as the encoded parts of the reports.

The free text contains both macroscopic and mi-
croscopic descriptions of the tissue sample. The
descriptions can include test results, size measure-

ments, the type of cancer and the possible degree
of hormone receptors. Other reported findings are
pre-cancers and metastases in lymph nodes.

Some of the values are explicitly stated in the
text as for example tumor size in Figure 1 Tumor-
diameter 15 mm (Tumor diameter 15 mm). Other
values are implicit and need to be inferred from
the text.

An example of this is the pT-values. They are
a kind of staging information for tumors, and in
the case of breast cancer the pT-value is based on
the size of the tumor and what tissues the tumor is
growing in (Naume, 2015). The pT value is not ex-
plicitly stated in the text, so the human or machine
encoder needs to evaluate several parts of the text
to determine the value of such a field.

A small portion of values appears in the same
form in the input text as in the encoding, but many
of the values are translated into one of a set of pre-
defined values. For example, estrogen receptors
are reported in numerical values in the text, as in
Figure 1 ER: ca 65 % av cellene positive. This per-
centage value is discretized to one of six possible
values when coded.

In total there can be 83 encoded fields for a sin-
gle report. There are 47 different field types and
18 of the field types can be repeated up to three
times depending on the number of tumors present
in the tissue sample. A majority of the fields are

mandatory to encode, but an option such as not
performed is often available.

The distribution of textual and encoded fields is
presented in Table 1. The implicit type is most
common in the input texts and the discretized type
is most common in the encodings. There is an
average of 5 different values for the discretized
fields.

4 A rule based approach for information
extraction

The available pathology reports have been divided
into a development set of 30 reports and a test set
of ten reports. The encoding of the reports has
been used for evaluation and there has not been
any additional manual annotation of the free text.

The developed system is based on the idea that
specific fields are identified by their form and con-
text. There are, for example, a number of fields
in the reports that are reported in the form of per-
centages and it is possible to distinguish them by
looking at characteristic tokens appearing before
and after them.

Each field therefore gets assigned one or more
Regex-style rules and two optional lists containing
sequences of tokens. The first list holds sequences
associated with the field and appearing before it,
and the second contains sequences appearing after
the field. The content of the context lists was cre-
ated by manual inspection of the pathology reports
in the development set.

One example of a field in the reports is the Ki67
hot spot value. It is often explicitly stated in the
text in the form of a percentage. Therefore, the
token % has been put in the after-list, and the to-
ken sequences selected for the before-list were hot
spot, hotspot, hot spotområde, ki - and ki67. A
program was then used to search each sentence in
the data for these tokens and a regular expression
was used to extract any numerical values found be-
tween them.

75



An automatic approach for creating the context
lists has also been tested. Each unigram, bigram,
trigram and 4-gram appearing in the development
set was evaluated in three steps; scoring, sorting
and selecting. In the first step the individual n-
gram was scored using F-scores according to its
ability to extract the correct values for an investi-
gated field. In the second step, the n-grams were
sorted in descending order according to this score
and in the final step a set of n-grams were selected.
The selection was performed by taking each n-
gram in order and putting it into the context list.
If the adding of the n-gram increased the total F-
score for the field, the n-gram was kept in the list.

5 Results

The system has been evaluated against the manual
encoding using precision, recall and F-score. The
results are presented in Table 2. The fields Sen-
tinel Nodes and the Axillary Nodes can have two
possible values, performed and not performed.
The field Tumor size is encoded in millimeters and
therefore has many possible values. Ki67 is a pro-
tein indicating the growing rate of tumors and the
two different Ki67 fields are encoded in percent.
The hormone receptors for estrogen and proges-
terone are also reported in percent, but encoded
into five and six different values, respectively. It is
also possible for these values to be encoded as not
stated if they are not present in the reports. The
pT-value can be encoded as 18 different values de-
pending on the size of the tumor, the type of cancer
and where the cancer grows.

The automatic creation of context lists was
tested on four of the fields, histological grade,

Ki67 hot spot value, Ki67 average value and tu-

hot spot value contained hot, ki67, - and hotspot.

6 Conclusions and Future work

In this pre-study, the possibility a system for ex-
tracting information from pathology reports writ-
ten in Norwegian has been investigated.

A number of different encoding types have been
identified in the data. This suggests the need for
a number of approaches for successful informa-
tion extraction. One main difficulty is to deter-
mine whether a value is actually present in the re-
port, since not all tests are preformed on all tissue
samples. Here, text classification could be imag-
ined as a useful technique. Several of the fields in
the reports are explicitly stated in a limited num-
ber of possible ways. In these cases, a rule based
approach as the one presented here could perform
well. There is also a category of values where the
encoding is more complicated. This is the case
when several parts of the input text needs to be in-
terpreted to find the correct encoding, here differ-
ent machine learning techniques should be investi-
gated. An overview of the future system is shown
in Figure 2.

The manually created context lists gave a better
performance than the automatically created con-
text lists. This can be explained by the fact that
a human can imagine similar contexts to the ones
found in the development data and add those to the
context lists. The automatic creation could, how-
ever, be useful when using more data and when ex-
panding to other types of cancers since it requires
no or little manual inspection of the input texts.

The validity of the presented precision, recall

and F-scores for the information extraction can not
be considered as very high, as too little data has
been used. To make any robust claims about the
performance of a future system, more test data is
needed, and to properly develop the system more
development data is also crucial. Ideally the per-
formance of this system should be compared to an
inter-annotator-agreement measure for the expert
coders. However, the achieved results are promis-
ing and show that this system should be further
developed and that a well functioning system is
feasible.
