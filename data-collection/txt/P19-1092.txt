Abstract

We present HEAD-QA, a multi-choice ques-
tion answering testbed to encourage research
on complex reasoning. The questions come
from exams to access a specialized position in
the Spanish healthcare system, and are chal-
lenging even for highly specialized humans.
We then consider monolingual (Spanish) and
cross-lingual (to English) experiments with in-
formation retrieval and neural techniques. We
show that: (i) HEAD-QA challenges current
methods, and (ii) the results lag well behind
human performance, demonstrating its useful-
ness as a benchmark for future work.

1 Introduction

Recent progress in question answering (QA) has
been led by neural models (Seo et al., 2016; Kundu
and Ng, 2018), due to their ability to process raw
texts. However, some authors (Kaushik and Lip-
ton, 2018; Clark et al., 2018) have discussed the
tendency of research to develop datasets and meth-
ods that accomodate the data-intensiveness and
strengths of current neural methods.

This is the case of popular English datasets such
as bAbI (Weston et al., 2015) or SQuAD (Ra-
jpurkar et al., 2016, 2018), where some systems
achieve near human-level performance (Hu et al.,
2018; Xiong et al., 2017) and often surface-level
knowledge suffices to answer. To counteract this,
Clark et al. (2016) and Clark et al. (2018) have
encouraged progress by developing multi-choice
datasets that require reasoning. The questions
match grade-school science, due to the difficul-
ties to collect specialized questions. With a similar
aim, Lai et al. (2017) released 100k questions and
28k passages intended for middle or high school
Chinese students, and Zellers et al. (2018) intro-
duced a dataset for common sense reasoning from
a spectrum of daily situations.

Question (medicine): A 13-year-old girl is operated on
due to Hirschsprung illness at 3 months of age. Which of
the following tumors is more likely to be present?
1. Abdominal neuroblastoma
2. Wilms tumor
3. Mesoblastic nephroma
4. Familial thyroid medullary carcinoma.

Question (pharmacology) The antibiotic treatment of
choice for Meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae
serogroup b is:
1. Gentamicin
2. Erythromycin
3. Ciprofloxacin
4. Cefotaxime

Question (psychology) According to research derived
from the Eysenck model, there is evidence that extraverts,
in comparison with introverts:
1. Perform better in surveillance tasks.
2. Have greater salivary secretion before the lemon juice
test.
3. Have a greater need for stimulation.
4. Have less tolerance to pain.

Table 1: Samples from HEAD-QA

However, this kind of dataset is scarce for com-
plex domains like medicine: while challenges
have been proposed in such domains, like textual
entailment (Abacha et al., 2015; Abacha and Dina,
2016) or answering questions about specific doc-
uments and snippets (Nentidis et al., 2018), we
know of no resources that require general reason-
ing on complex domains. The novelty of this work
falls in this direction, presenting a multi-choice
QA task that combines the need of knowledge and
reasoning with complex domains, and which takes
humans years of training to answer correctly.

Contribution We present HEAD-QA, a multi-
choice testbed of graduate-level questions about
medicine, nursing, biology, chemistry, psychol-
ogy, and pharmacology (see Table 11). The data

2 The HEAD-QA corpus

The Ministerio de Sanidad, Consumo y Bienestar
Social2 (as a part of the Spanish government) an-
nounces every year examinations to apply for spe-
cialization positions in its public healthcare areas.
The applicants must have a bachelor’s degree in
the corresponding area (from 4 to 6 years) and they
prepare the exam for a period of one year or more,
as the vacancies are limited. The exams are used to
discriminate among thousands of applicants, who
will choose a specialization and location accord-
ing to their mark (e.g., in medicine, to access a
cardiology or gynecology position at a given hos-
pital).

We use these examinations (from 2013 to
present) to create HEAD-QA. We consider ques-
tions involving the following healthcare areas:
medicine (aka MIR), pharmacology (FIR), psy-
chology (PIR), nursing (EIR), biology (BIR), and
chemistry (QIR).34 Exams from 2013 and 2014 are
multi-choice tests with five options, while the rest
of them have just four. The questions mainly refer

2https://www.mscbs.gob.es/
3Radiophysics exams are excluded, due to the difficulty

to parse their content (e.g. equations) from the PDF files.
4Some of the questions might be considered invalid after

the exams. We remove those questions from the final dataset.

Figure 1: Image no 21 from MIR 2017

to technical matters, although some of them also
consider social issues (e.g. how to deal with pa-
tients in stressful situations). A small percentage
(∼14%) of the medicine questions refer to images
that provide additional information to answer cor-
rectly. These are included as a part of the corpus,
although we will not exploit them in this work. For
clarity, Table 4 shows an example:5

Question Question linked to image no 21. A 38-
year-old bank employee who has been periodically
checked by her company is referred to us to assess
the chest X-ray. The patient smokes 20 cigarettes
/ day from the age of 21. She says that during the
last months, she is somewhat more tired than usual.
The basic laboratory tests are normal except for an
Hb of 11.4 g / dL. An electrocardiogram and forced
spirometry are normal. What do you think is the
most plausible diagnostic orientation?

1. Hodgkin’s disease.

2. Histoplasmosis type fungal infection.

3. Sarcoidosis.

4. Bronchogenic carcinoma.

Table 4: A question referring to Figure 1

We describe in detail the JSON structure of
HEAD-QA in Appendix A. We enumerate below
the fields for a given sample:

• The question ID and the question’s content.

• Path to the image referred to in the question
(if any).

• A list with the possible answers. Each answer
is composed of the answer ID and its text.

• The ID of the right answer for that question.

5Note that images often correspond to serious injuries and
diseases. Viewer discretion is advised. The quality of the
images varies widely, but it is good enough that the pictures
can be analyzed by humans in a printed version. Figure 1 has
1037x1033 pixels.

Although all the approaches that we will be
testing are unsupervised or distant-supervised, we
additionally define official training, development
and test splits, so future research with supervised
approaches can be compared with the work pre-
sented here. For this supervised setting, we choose
the 2013 and 2014 exams for the training set, 2015
for the development set, and the rest for testing.
The statistics are shown in Tables 2 and 3. It is
worth noting that a common practice to divide a
dataset is to rely on randomized splits to avoid po-
tential biases in the collected data. We decided not
to follow this strategy for two reasons. First, the
questions and the number of questions per area are
designed by a team of healthcare experts who al-
ready try to avoid these biases. Second (and more
relevant), random splits would impede comparison
against official (and aggregated) human results.

Finally, we hope to increase the size of HEAD-
QA by including questions from future exams.

English version HEAD-QA is in Spanish, but we
include a translation to English (HEAD-QA-EN)
using the Google API, which we use to perform
cross-lingual experiments. We evaluated the qual-
ity of the translation using a sample of 60 random
questions and their answers. We relied on two
fluent Spanish-English speakers to score the ad-
equacy6 and on one native English speaker for the
fluency,7 following the scale by Koehn and Monz
(2006). The average scores for adequacy were
4.35 and 4.71 out of 5, i.e. most of the meaning
is captured; and for fluency 4 out of 5, i.e. good.
As a side note, it was observed by the annota-
tors that most names of diseases were successfully
translated to English. On the negative side, the
translator tended to struggle with elements such as
molecular formulae, relatively common in chem-
istry questions.8

3 Methods

Notation We represent HEAD-QA as a list of
tuples: [(q0, A0), ..., (qN , AN )], where: qi is a
question and Ai = [ai0, ..., aim] are the possible

6Adequacy: How much meaning is preserved? We use a
scale from 5 to 1: 5 (all meaning), 4 (most meaning), 3 (some
meaning), 2 (little meaning), 1 (none).

7Fluency: Is the language in the output fluent? We use
a scale from 5 to 1: 5 (flawless), 4 (good), 3 (non-native), 2
(disfluent), 1 (incomprehensible).

8This particular issue is not only due to the automatic
translation process, but also to the difficulty of correctly map-
ping these elements from PDF exams to plain text.

answers. We use ãik to denote the predicted
answer, ignoring indexes when not needed.

Kaushik and Lipton (2018) discuss on the need
of providing rigorous baselines that help better
understand the improvement coming from future
models, and also the need of avoiding architectural
novelty when introducing new datasets. For this
reason, our baselines are based on state-of-the-art
systems used in open-domain and multi-choice QA
(Chen et al., 2017; Kembhavi et al., 2017; Khot
et al., 2018; Clark et al., 2018).

3.1 Control methods

Given the complex nature of the task, we include
three control methods:

Random Sampling ã ∼ Multinomial(φ),
where φ is a random distribution.

Blindx ãik = aix ∀i. Always chosing the xth
option. Tests made by the examiners are not to-
tally random (Poundstone, 2014) and right an-
swers tend occur more in middle options.

Length Choosing the longest answer.9 Pound-
stone (2014) points out that examiners have to
make sure that the right answer is totally correct,
which might take more space.

3.2 Strong multi-choice methods

We evaluate an information retrieval (IR) model
for HEAD-QA and cross-lingual models for HEAD-
QA-EN. Following Chen et al. (2017), we use
Wikipedia as our source of information (D)10 for
all the baselines. We then extract the raw text and
remove the elements that add some type of struc-
ture (headers, tables, . . . ).11

3.2.1 Spanish information retrieval
Let (qi, [ai0, ..., aim]) be a question with its pos-
sible answers, we first create a set of m queries
of the form [qi + ai0, ..., qi + aim], which will
be sent separately to a search engine. In particu-
lar, we use the DrQA’s Document Retriever (Chen
et al., 2017), which scores the relation between the
queries and the articles as TF-IDF weighted bag-
of-word vectors, and also takes into account word
order and bi-gram counting. The predicted answer
is defined as ãik = argmaxk(score(mk,D)), i.e.

9Computed as the number of characters in the answers.

the answer in the query mk for which we obtained
the highest document relevance. This is equivalent
to the IR baselines by Clark et al. (2016, 2018).

3.2.2 Cross-lingual methods
Although some research on Spanish QA has been
done in the last decade (Magnini et al., 2003;
Vicedo et al., 2003; Buscaldi and Rosso, 2006; Ka-
materi et al., 2019), most recent work has been
done for English, in part due to the larger avail-
ability of resources. On the one hand this is in-
teresting because we hope HEAD-QA will encour-
age research on multilingual question answering.
On the other hand, we want to check how chal-
lenging the dataset is for state-of-the-art systems,
usually available only for English. To do so, we
use HEAD-QA-EN, as the adequacy and the fluency
scores of the translation were high.

Cross-lingual Information Retrieval The IR
baseline, but applied to HEAD-QA-EN. We also
use this baseline as an extrinsic way to evaluate
the quality of the translation, expecting to obtain a
performance similar to the Spanish IR model.

Multi-choice DrQA (Chen et al., 2017) DrQA
first returns the 5 most relevant documents for
each question, relying on the information retrieval
system described above. It will then try to find
the exact span in them containing the right answer
on such documents, using a document reader. For
this, the authors rely on a neural network system
inspired in the Attentive Reader (Hermann et al.,
2015) that was trained over SQuAD (Rajpurkar
et al., 2016). The original DrQA is intended for
open-domain QA, focusing on factoid questions.
To adapt it to a multi-choice setup, to select ã we
compare the selected span against all the answers
and select the one that shares the largest percent-
age of tokens.12 Non-factoid questions (common
in HEAD-QA) are not given any special treatment.

Multi-choice BiDAF (Clark et al., 2018) Simi-
lar to the multi-choice DrQA, but using a BiDAF
architecture as the document reader (Seo et al.,
2016). The way BiDAF is trained is also differ-
ent: they first trained the reader on SQuAD, but
then further tuned to science questions presented
in (Clark et al., 2018), using continued training.
This system might select as correct more than one

12We lemmatize and remove the stopwords as in (Clark
et al., 2018). We however observed that many of selected
spans did not have any word in common with any of the an-
swers. If this happens, we select the longest answer.

answer. If this happens, we follow a simple ap-
proach and select the longest one.

Multi-choice DGEM and Decompatt (Clark
et al., 2018) The models adapt the DGEM (Parikh
et al., 2016) and Decompatt (Khot et al., 2018) en-
tailment systems. They consider a set of hypothe-
sis hik=qi + aik and each hi is used as a query to
retrieve a set of relevant sentences, Sik. Then, an
entailment score entailment(hik, s) is computed
for every hik and s ∈ Sik, where ã is the answer
inside hik that maximizes the score. If multiple
answers are selected, we choose the longest one.

4 Experiments

Metrics We use accuracy and a POINTS metric
(used in the official exams): a right answer counts
3 points and a wrong one subtracts 1 point.13

Results (unsupervised setting) Tables 5 and 6
show the accuracy and POINTS scores for both
HEAD-QA and HEAD-QA-EN. The cross-lingual
IR model obtains even a greater performance than
the Spanish one. This is another indicator that
the translation is good enough to apply cross-
lingual approaches. On the negative side, the ap-
proaches based on current neural architectures ob-
tain a lower performance.

questions and the answers (this was shown in Ta-
ble 3). This hypothesis is supported by the lower
results on the nursing domain (EIR), the category
with the second longest questions/answers. On the
contrary, the categories for which we obtained the
better results, such as pharmacology (FIR) or bi-
ology (BIR), have shorter questions and answers.
While the evaluated models surpass all control
methods, their performance is still well behind the
human performance. We illustrate this in Table 9,
comparing the performance (POINTS score) of our
best model against a summary of the results, on the
2016 exams.14 Also, the best performing model
was a non-machine learning model based on stan-
dard information retrieval techniques. This rein-
forces the need for effective information extrac-
tion techniques that can be later used to perform
complex reasoning with machine learning models.

5 Conclusion

We presented a complex multi-choice dataset con-
taining questions about medicine, nursing, biol-
ogy, pharmacology, psychology and chemistry.
Such questions correspond to examinations to ac-
cess specialized positions in the Spanish health-
care system, and require specialized knowledge
and reasoning to be answered. To check its com-
plexity, we then tested different state-of-the-art
models for open-domain and multi-choice ques-
tions. We show how they struggle with the chal-
lenge, being clearly surpassed by a non-machine
learning model based on information retrieval. We
hope this work will encourage research on design-
ing more powerful QA systems that can carry out
effective information extraction and reasoning.

We also believe there is room for alternative
challenges in HEAD-QA. In this work we have
used it as a closed QA dataset (the potential an-
swers are used as input to determine the right one).
Nothing prevents to use the dataset in an open set-
ting, where the system is given no clue about the
possible answers. This would require to think as
well whether widely used metrics such as BLEU
(Papineni et al., 2002) or exact match could be ap-
propriate for this particular problem.
