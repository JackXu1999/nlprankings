Abstract

Based on the last year’s DCU-CASIST
participation on WMT metrics task, we
further improve our model in the follow-
ing ways: 1) parameter tuning 2) support
languages other than English. We tuned
our system on all the data of WMT 2010,
2012 and 2013. The tuning results as well
as the WMT 2014 test results are reported.

1 Introduction

Automatic evaluation plays a more and more im-
portant role in the evolution of machine transla-
tion. There are roughly two categories can be seen:
namely lexical information based and structural
information based.

1) Lexical information based approaches,
among which, BLEU (?), Translation Error Rate
(TER) (?) and METEOR (?) are the most popular
ones and, with simplicity as their merits, cannot
adequately reflect the structural level similarity.

2) A lot of structural level based methods
have been exploited to overcome the weakness
of the lexical based methods, including Syntactic
Tree Model(STM)(?), a constituent tree based ap-
proach, and Head Word Chain Model(HWCM)(?),
a dependency tree based approach. Both of
the methods compute the similarity between the
sub-trees of the hypothesis and the reference.
Owczarzak et al (?; ?; ?) presented a method
using the Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) de-
pendency tree. MAXSIM (?) and the method pro-
posed by Zhu et al (?) also employed the syntac-
tic information in association with lexical infor-
mation. As we know that the hypothesis is poten-
tially noisy, and these errors are enlarged through
the parsing process. Thus the power of syntactic
information could be considerably weakened.

In this paper, based on our attempt on WMT
metrics task 2013 (?), we propose a metrics named

RED ( REference Dependency based automatic
evaluation method). Our metrics employs only the
reference dependency tree which contains both the
lexical and syntactic information, leaving the hy-
pothesis side unparsed to avoid error propagation.

2 Parameter Tuning

In RED, we use F -score as our final score.
F -score is calculated by Formula (1), where α is
a value between 0 and 1.

F -score =
precision · recall

α · precision+ (1− α) · recall
(1)

The dependency tree of the reference and the
string of the translation are used to calculate the
precision and recall. In order to calculate preci-
sion, the number of the dep-ngrams (the ngrams
obtained from dependency tree1) should be given,
but there is no dependency tree for the transla-
tion in our method. We know that the number
of dep-ngrams has an approximate linear relation-
ship with the length of the sentence, so we use the
length of the translation to replace the number of
the dep-ngrams in the translation dependency tree.
Recall can be calculated directly since we know
the number of the dep-ngrams in the reference.
The precision and recall are computed as follows.

precisionn =

∑
d∈Dn p(d,hyp)
lenh

recalln =

∑
d∈Dn p(d,hyp)
countn(ref)

Dn is the set of dep-ngrams with the length of n.
lenh is the length of the translation. countn(ref)
is the number of the dep-ngrams with the length
of n in the reference. p(d,hpy) is 0 if there is no
match and a positive number between 0 and 1 oth-
erwise(?).

1We define two types of dep-ngrams: 1) the head word
chain(?); 2) fix-floating(?))

420



The final score of RED is achieved using For-
mula (2), in which a weighted sum of the dep-
ngrams’ F -score is calculated. wngram (0 ≤
wngram ≤ 1) is the weight of dep-ngram with the
length of n. F -scoren is the F -score for the dep-
ngrams with the length of n.

RED =
N∑

n=1

(wngram × F -scoren) (2)

Other parameters to be tuned includes:

• Stem and Synonym
Stem(?) and synonym (WordNet2) are intro-
duced with the following three steps. First,
we obtain the alignment with METEOR
Aligner (?) in which not only exact match
but also stem and synonym are considered.
We use stem, synonym and exact match as the
three match modules. Second, the alignment
is used to match for a dep-ngram. We think
the dep-ngram can match with the transla-
tion if the following conditions are satisfied.
1) Each of the words in the dep-ngram has
a matched word in the translation according
to the alignment; 2) The words in dep-ngram
and the matched words in translation appear
in the same order; 3) The matched words
in translation must be continuous if the dep-
ngram is a fixed-floating ngram. At last, the
match module score of a dep-ngram is cal-
culated according to Formula (3). Different
match modules have different effects, so we
give them different weights.

smod =
∑n

i=1wmi
n

, 0 ≤ wmi ≤ 1 (3)

mi is the match module (exact, stem or syn-
onym) of the ith word in a dep-ngram. wmi
is the match module weight of the ith word in
a dep-ngram. n is the number of words in a
dep-ngram.

• Paraphrase
When introducing paraphrase, we don’t con-
sider the dependency tree of the reference,
because paraphrases may not be contained in
the head word chain and fixed-floating struc-
tures. Therefore we first obtain the align-

2http://wordnet.princeton.edu/

ment with METEOR Aligner, only consid-
ering paraphrase; Then, the matched para-
phrases are extracted from the alignment and
defined as paraphrase-ngram. The score of
a paraphrase is 1 × wpar, where wpar is the
weight of paraphrase-ngram.

• Function word
We introduce a parameterwfun (0 ≤ wfun ≤
1) to distinguish function words and content
words. wfun is the weight of function words.
The function word score of a dep-ngram or
paraphrase-ngram is computed according to
Formula (4).

sfun =
Cfun × wfun + Ccon × (1− wfun)

Cfun + Ccon
(4)

Cfun is the number of function words in the
dep-ngram or paraphrase-ngram. Ccon is the
number of content words in the dep-ngram or
paraphrase-ngram.

REDp =
N∑

n=1

(wngram × F -scorepn) (5)

F -scorep =
precisionp · recallp

α · precisionp + (1− α) · recallp
(6)

precisionp and recallP in Formula (6) are cal-
culated as follows.

precisionp =
scoreparn + scoredepn

lenh

recallp =
scoreparn + scoredepn

countn(ref) + countn(par)

lenh is the length of the translation. countn(ref)
is the number of the dep-ngrams with the length
of n in the reference. countn(par) is the num-
ber of paraphrases with length of n in refer-
ence. scoreparn is the match score of paraphrase-
ngrams with the length of n. scoredepn is the
match score of dep-ngrams with the length of n.
scoreparn and scoredepn are calculated as follows.

scoreparn =
∑

par∈Pn
(1× wpar × sfum)

scoredepn =
∑

d∈Dn
(p(d,hyp) × smod × sfun)

Pn is the set of paraphrase-ngrams with the

There are totally nine parameters in RED. We
tried two parameter tuning strategies: Genetic
search algorithm (?) and a Grid search over two
subsets of parameters. The results of Grid search
is more stable, therefore our final submission is
based upon Grid search. We separate the 9 pa-
rameters into two subsets. When searching Sub-
set 1, the parameters in Subset 2 are fixed, and
vice versa. Several iterations are executed to fin-
ish the parameter tuning process. For system
level coefficient score, we set two optimization
goals: G.sys.1) to maximize the sum of Spear-
man’s ρ rank correlation coefficient on system
level and Kendall’s τ correlation coefficient on
sentence level or G.sys.2) only the former; For
sentence level coefficient score, we also set two
optimization goals: G.sent.1) the same as G.sys.1,
G.sent.2) only the latter part of G.sys.1.

3 Experiments

In this section we report the experimental results
of RED on the tuning set, which is the combi-
nation of WMT2010, WMT2012 and WMT2013
data set, as well as the test results on the
WMT2014. Both the sentence level evaluation and
the system level evaluation are conducted to assess
the performance of our automatic metrics. At the
sentence level evaluation, Kendall’s rank correla-
tion coefficient τ is used. At the system level eval-
uation, the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient
ρ is used.

3.1 Data
There are four language pairs in WMT2010 and
WMT2012 including German-English, Czech-
English, French-English and Spanish-English. For
WMT2013, except these 4 language pairs, there is
also Russian-English. As the test set, WMT 2014
has also five language pairs, but the organizer re-
moved Spanish-English and replace it with Hindi-
English. For into-English tasks, we parsed the En-

In the experiments, we compare the perfor-
mance of our metric with the widely used lexi-
cal based metrics BLEU, TER, METEOR and a
dependency based metrics HWCM. The results of
RED are provided with exactly the same external
resources like METEOR. The results of BLEU,

are available). The experiments of HWCM is per-
formed by us.

3.2 Sentence-level Evaluation
Kendall’s rank correlation coefficient τ is em-
ployed to evaluate the correlation of all the MT
evaluation metrics and human judgements at the
sentence level. A higher value of τ means a bet-
ter ranking similarity with the human judges. The
correlation scores of are shown in Table 1. Our
method performs best when maximum length of
dep-n-gram is set to 3, so we present only the
results when the maximum length of dep-n-gram
equals 3. From Table 1, we can see that: firstly, pa-
rameter tuning improve performance significantly
on all the three tuning sets; secondly, although
the best scores in the column RED-sent are much
more than RED-syssent, but the outperform is
very small, so by setting these two optimization
goals, RED can achieve comparable performance;
thirdly, without parameter tuning, RED does not
perform well on WMT 2012 and 2013, and even
with parameter tuning, RED does not outperform
METEOR as much as WMT 2010; lastly, on the
test set, RED does not outperform METEOR.

3.3 System-level Evaluation
We also evaluated the RED scores with the human
rankings at the system level to further investigate
the effectiveness of our metrics. The matching of
the words in RED is correlated with the position
of the words, so the traditional way of computing
system level score, like what BLEU does, is not
feasible for RED. Therefore, we resort to the way
of adding the sentence level scores together to ob-
tain the system level score. At system level evalu-
ation, we employ Spearman’s rank correlation co-

efficient ρ. The correlations and the average scores
are shown in Table 2.

From Table 2, we can see similar trends as in
Table 1 with the following difference: firstly, with-
out parameter tuning, RED perform comparably
with METEOR on all the three tuning sets; sec-
ondly, on test set, RED also perform comparably
with METEOR. thirdly, RED perform very bad on
Hindi-English, which is a newly introduced task
this year.

3.4 Evaluation of English to Other
Languages

We evaluate both sentence level and system level
score of RED on English to French and German.
The reason we only conduct these two languages
are that the dependency parsers are more reliable
in these two languages. The results are shown in
Table 3 and 4.

From Table 3 and 4 we can see that the tuned
version of RED still perform slightly better than
METEOR with the only exception of system level
en-de.

4 Conclusion

In this paper, based on the last year’s DCU-
CASICT submission, we further improved our
method, namely RED. The experiments are car-
ried out at both sentence-level and system-level
using to-English and from-English corpus. The
experiment results indicate that although RED
achieves better correlation than BLEU, HWCM,
TER and comparably performance with METEOR
at both sentence level and system level, the per-
formance is not stable on all language pairs, such
as the sentence level correlation score of Hindi to

424



English and the system level score of English to
German. To further study the sudden diving of the
performance is our future work.
