PEMT for the Public Sector – Evolution of a Solution

Presentation Objective
• Data protection concerns and knowledge of how to implement a 

practical HLT solution that delivers meaningful value have historically 
prevented public sector clients from using MT, CAT, and TMS

• We will show how our team successfully addressed data protection 
and client objectives to develop a practical, domain-specific PEMT 
solution to a public sector client who is now transforming how they use 
HLT

Key Takeaways:
• How to develop a customized PEMT solution 

for public sector
• How to build and optimize TM corpora for 

statistical MT training
• How to gauge technological and procedural 

efficiencies for overall program success and 
scalability

PEMT for the Public Sector – Evolution of a Solution

Historical HLT Challenges with 
MGPS PS Client Base

• Limited HLT use due to various 
contract constraints 
– No co-mingling data, no data in cloud
– TM/TB corpora destruction
– CONUS resources with citizenship, various 

clearance levels
• HLT use still not widespread among PS 

linguist base (freelance)

• No process automation
– Longer production timelines
– Project-based translation

PEMT for the Public Sector – Evolution of a Solution

Define Stakeholders and Budget
• Dedicate a representative team of 

production experts – include the client! 
➢ Get early buy-in from the future production team
➢ Start building the TMS operations culture 
➢ Let the production-side stakeholders define a 

business case and the best solution

• Align Budget and HLT options 
➢ Define Scope and Level of Effort - manage 

budget and expectations
➢ HLT costs (CAT/TMS/MT)
➢ IT setup (local install vs. SaaS)

Challenge

There are a growing number of strong HLT solutions. How 
do you select the right one, and how do you implement 

effectively?

11

PEMT for the Public Sector – Evolution of a Solution

Choosing/Validating the Right Solution

• Perform preliminary research 
➢ What do I need?

➢ What are my options 

(commercial/custom/open source)?

➢ What are my community peers saying?

• Choose solution candidates
• Set up orientation calls with solution 

developers 
➢ Identify dedicated contacts for technical and 

contractual questions

➢ Explore data security options for data and 

support

➢ Standard criteria include:

– Key features
– Benefits
– Shortcomings
– Technical and contract support 
– Deployment options
– Costs

Whiteboard Your Workflows

• Define and document/update existing production processes
• Do *not* adjust workflows based on the solutions’ limitations

➢ If it doesn’t fit, it’s not right for you

• Generate a master workflow that addresses the variations 
➢ Define production steps as “required” or “optional”

• Whiteboard other business requirements/expectations 
➢ Manage expectations
