ABSTRACT
This work is about connotative aspects of words, often not carried over in translation, which
depend on specific cultures. A cross-language computational study is presented, based on
exploitation of similarity techniques on large corpora of news documents in English, Arabic,
and Hebrew. In particular, focus of the exploration is on specific terms expressing emotion,
negotiation and conflict.

KEYWORDS: Multilinguality, Affective Language, Emotions in Language.

1 Introduction

Even an excellent human translator has problems in carrying over the target language all the
culture-related aspects that go with words. If focus is put into emotion-related aspects the
matter is even subtler. The relation of a word to emotion concepts may depend on ideology and
in general on cultural aspects that can be inferred from extensive word usage rather than from
what can be found in dictionaries. Of course it also depends on genres, different periods of text
production, sociolinguistic characteristics of the text originators and so on.

In this paper, we describe a cross-language computational study based on exploitation of
similarity techniques on large corpora of news documents in English, Arabic, and Hebrew. In
particular, we focus our exploration on specific terms expressing emotion, negotiation and
conflict.

Aside of the general scientific motivation, we had a specific motivation for starting this work:
help overcoming unnecessary language problems in international negotiations involving dif-
ferent languages. In fact, perhaps the most damaging mistake in any negotiation is misunder-
standing, especially that which is the result of ignorance and disregard. The need is to reduce
one aspect of such misunderstanding.

During negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians for example, more than once the latter
used the expression “the final solution" with reference to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. For
Israelis, as for many Westerners, this expression most importantly refers to the Holocaust. Thus,
almost automatically it creates aversion, and is sometimes even interpreted as a threat. Or just
consider the different valence of the word “honor" in an Arabic, English or Hebrew expression,
particularly in an emotionally tense situation.

The aim of this work is to assess the emotional connotations of words which have more or
less the same denotation in Arabic, Hebrew and English. Although Arabic and Hebrew have
been studied for centuries by both Arab and foreign scholars, their emotive aspects have been
rather neglected, at least from the semantic point of view. An exception among Arab scholars
is Abdullah-T Shunnaq (Shunnaq, 1993). The view that emotions take part in the meaning
of words was already made by McDougall during the Twenties’ of the last century (Gregg,
2005). (Ogden and Richards, 1923) and more recently (Kövecses, 2000) call attention on
how emotions are treated in language. Davitz’s early work in the area of lexicography (Davitz,
1969) has recently gained greater interest with the advent of electronic media (Heise, 2001).
(Kövecses, 2000) divides “emotion language" into expressive terms, terms literally denoting
particular kinds of emotions, and figurative expressions, of which the latter “is the largest by
far". On a similar line goes the cognitive approach of (Ortony et al., 1987).

On the other hand, cultures, and thus, languages, differ in the degree of emotionality, Arabic
being considered high in this criterion (Shunnaq, 1993). This is even more evident for political
terms, and in particular for those associated with conflict. In negotiation, recognition of the
emotions of the other party is the first step on the road to conciliation. As (Irani, 1999) say “A
first step in the process of healing, then, is the mutual acknowledgment by all parties of their
emotions, viewpoints and needs.". On the negative side it has been said that “representing
outcomes in affective terms leads to longer negotiation times and higher impasse rates" (Conlon
and Hunt, 2002).

The important role of emotions in Middle East politics is also eloquently pointed to in an article
by (Moïsi, 2007). In it he coined the phrase “clash of emotions", and argued that the Arab

1202



world manifests a culture of humiliation. Others in the Middle East argue too, that the role
of emotions is greater than that of civilizations in explaining violence in the region (Fattaha
and Fierke, 2009). On the Social-personal level, emotion is closely tied to moral system of a
culture, and thus plays a decisive role in communicating with that culture. As (Fattaha and
Fierke, 2009) put it: “In this view, emotion finds expression only in a language and a culture,
which is linked to a moral order and moral appraisal. In the Middle East, feelings are always
“situated in configurations of interpersonal relationships." These are connected in turn with the
honor-modesty system (honor, shame, and modesty) (Gregg, 2005).

Coming to us, as said, we had the goal of establishing a methodology and eventually reaching
concrete results concerning the different connotations of corresponding terms in Arabic, Hebrew
and English. For one of us the initial strategy was to proceed via questionnaires in Arabic,
and Hebrew, with different populations.The initial attempt at getting results via questionnaires
could not get very far, mainly because of small numbers. The subtlety of the questions and
situations suggested crowdsourcing techniques were not appropriate as well. The idea then
came of following a computational approach very much in line with the experience of the other
two authors. In particular, we used corpus-based similarity techniques for exploring affective
significance of words in different languages, with relevant practical implications.

2 Corpora and terms in focus

In the experiment of exploring similarity, we exploited three corpora in the respective languages.

Arabic: Arabic Gigaword Third Edition is a comprehensive archive of newswire text data
acquired from Arabic news sources. The six distinct sources of Arabic newswire are:
Agence France Presse, Assabah, Al Hayat, An Nahar, Ummah Press, and Xinhua News
Agency. The total number of documents is about 1.500.000 in a span time from 1995
until 2007. The preprocessing on this corpus consisted of a conversion from Arabic to
Buckwalter ascii encoding and of a postagging process with the AMIRA tool (Diab et al.,
2004).

English: We collected about 400.000 Google-News in the years 2008/2009. The documents
have been pos-tagged with the TextPro tool (Pianta et al., 2008).

Hebrew: We used a collection of news documents from three newspapers in the span time
1990 - 2002: Arutz7, The Marker, and HaAretz.The corpus includes 11.474 documents
and it has been preprocessed with a pos-tagger (Itai and Wintner, 2008).

In building the datasets from the documents of the three corpora, we considered as parts of
speech nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs.

In order to select a suitable set of terms of conflict and emotion terms, questionnaires were
distributed among native speakers of Arabic and Hebrew respectively, i.e. students of universities
(Tel Aviv, Haifa), colleges (al-Qasemi) and high-schools (Palestinian East Jerusalem). For English
we felt it was not strictly necessary. Respondents were asked to provide words in the categories
of emotion, conflict, conciliation and trust terms. Among the emotion terms, some would not
be considered “emotions" by English speakers, but were still included by us. This method was
employed in order to avoid contamination of the list by Western culture researchers (Wierzbicka,
1997), e.g. by only referring to the “universal" emotions, i.e., anger, fear, disgust, sadness,

Table 2: Some similarity values in the three corpora

3 Technique

As a corpus-based measure of semantic similarity we exploited latent semantic analysis (LSA)
proposed by Landauer (Landauer et al., 1998). In LSA, term co-occurrences in a corpus are
captured by means of a dimensionality reduction operated by a singular value decomposition
(SVD) on the term-by-document matrix T representing the corpus.

SVD is a well-known operation in linear algebra, which can be applied to any rectangular matrix
in order to find correlations among its rows and columns. In our case, SVD decomposes the term-
by-document matrix T into three matrices T = UΣkVT where Σk is the diagonal k× k matrix
containing the k singular values of T, σ1 ≥ σ2 ≥ . . .≥ σk, and U and V are column-orthogonal
matrices. When the three matrices are multiplied together the original term-by-document matrix
is re-composed. Typically we can choose k′≪ k obtaining the approximation T≃ UΣk′VT .

LSA can be viewed as a way to overcome some of the drawbacks of the standard vector space
model (sparseness and high dimensionality). In fact, the LSA similarity is computed in a lower
dimensional space, in which second-order relations among terms and texts are exploited. The
similarity in the resulting vector space is then measured with the standard cosine similarity.
Note also that LSA yields a vector space model that allows for a homogeneous representation
(and hence comparison) of words, word sets, and texts. It is possible to represent set of words
in the semantic space using the pseudo-document text representation for LSA computation, as
described by Berry (Berry, 1992). In practice, each text segment is represented in the LSA
space by summing up the normalized LSA vectors of all the constituent words, using also a
tf.idf weighting scheme. For the experiments reported in this paper, we run the SVD operation
respectively on the three preprocessed corpora described in the previous section, using k′ = 400
dimensions.

4 Results and discussion

To give an idea about different behaviors of corresponding terms in the three languages, in Table
2 we report some similarity values. In the initial part of the list we show similarity measures
between emotion terms and some generic terms. The entries that follow in the list include more
opinionated terms. The differences among values in the three languages are quite noticeable
and can be considered as evidence of different sociocultural perceptions of the involved terms.

These results suggest that the proposed techniques are a viable tool for approaching cultural
differences that emerge in different languages.

Of course, in the future, more specialized and, when possible, strictly aligned corpora can be
used for the involved languages, as the applied context may require.

The computational approach we have presented has proven to be very promising: looking at
specifically critical words for a sensitive situation like a multilingual negotiation in a bitter
conflict, different emotional connotations of words, which are considered as the right translation,
tend to appear clearly. From the applied point of view we are taking into consideration the
development of an interface that would offer a quick perception of these different connotations
across the involved languages, yielding an immediate feeling of the emotional aspect often lost
in translation.
