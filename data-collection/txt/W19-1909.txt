Abstract

Contextual word embedding models such as
ELMo (Peters et al., 2018) and BERT (De-
vlin et al., 2018) have dramatically improved
performance for many natural language pro-
cessing (NLP) tasks in recent months. How-
ever, these models have been minimally ex-
plored on specialty corpora, such as clini-
cal text; moreover, in the clinical domain, no
publicly-available pre-trained BERT models
yet exist. In this work, we address this need
by exploring and releasing BERT models for
clinical text: one for generic clinical text and
another for discharge summaries specifically.
We demonstrate that using a domain-specific
model yields performance improvements on
three common clinical NLP tasks as compared
to nonspecific embeddings. These domain-
specific models are not as performant on two
clinical de-identification tasks, and argue that
this is a natural consequence of the differences
between de-identified source text and synthet-
ically non de-identified task text.

1 Introduction

Natural language processing (NLP) has been
shaken in recent months with the dramatic suc-
cesses enabled by transfer learning and contextual
word embedding models, such as ELMo (Peters
et al., 2018), ULMFiT (Howard and Ruder, 2018),
and BERT (Devlin et al., 2018).

These models have been primarily explored for
general domain text, and, recently, biomedical text
with BioBERT (Lee et al., 2019). However, clin-
ical narratives (e.g., physician notes) have known
differences in linguistic characteristics from both
general text and non-clinical biomedical text, mo-
tivating the need for specialized clinical BERT
models.

In this work, we build and publicly release ex-
actly such an embedding model.1 Furthermore,
we demonstrate on several clinical NLP tasks the
improvements this system offers over traditional
BERT and BioBERT alike.

In particular, we make the following contribu-
tions:

1. We train and publicly release BERT-Base and
BioBERT-finetuned models trained on both
all clinical notes and only discharge sum-
maries.2

2. We demonstrate that using clinical specific
contextual embeddings improves both upon
general domain results and BioBERT results
across 2 well established clinical NER tasks
and one medical natural language inference
task (i2b2 2010 (Uzuner et al., 2011), i2b2
2012 (Sun et al., 2013a,b), and MedNLI
(Romanov and Shivade, 2018)). On 2
de-identification (de-ID) tasks, i2b2 2006
(Uzuner et al., 2007) and i2b2 2014 (Stubbs
et al., 2015; Stubbs and Uzuner, 2015), gen-
eral BERT and BioBERT outperform clinical
BERT and we argue that fundamental facets
of the de-ID context motivate this lack of per-
formance.

Contextual Embeddings in General Tradi-
tional word-level vector representations, such as
word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013), GloVe (Penning-
ton et al., 2014), and fastText (Bojanowski et al.,

2017), express all possible meanings of a word as
a single vector representation and cannot disam-
biguate the word senses based on the surround-
ing context. Over the last two years, ELMo (Pe-
ters et al., 2018) and BERT (Devlin et al., 2018)
present strong solutions that can provide contex-
tualized word representations. By pre-training on
a large text corpus as a language model, ELMo
can create a context-sensitive embedding for each
word in a given sentence, which will be fed into
downstream tasks. Compared to ELMo, BERT is
deeper and contains much more parameters, thus
possessing greater representation power. More im-
portantly, rather than simply providing word em-
beddings as features, BERT can be incorporated
into a downstream task and gets fine-tuned as an
integrated task-specific architecture.

BERT has, in general, been found to be supe-
rior to ELMo and far superior to non-contextual
embeddings on a variety of tasks, including those
in the clinical domain (Si et al., 2019). For
this reason, we only examine BERT here, rather
than including ELMo or non-contextual embed-
ding methods.

Contextual Clinical & Biomedical Embeddings
Several works have explored the utility of con-
textual models in the clinical and biomedical do-
mains. BioBERT (Lee et al., 2019) trains a BERT
model over a corpus of biomedical research arti-
cles sourced from PubMed3 article abstracts and
PubMed Central4 article full texts. They find
the specificity offered by biomedical texts trans-
lated to improved performance on several biomed-
ical NLP tasks, and fully release their pre-trained
BERT model.

On clinical text, (Khin et al., 2018) uses a
general-domain pretrained ELMo model towards
the task of clinical text de-identification, report-
ing near state-of-the-art performance on the i2b2
2014 task (Stubbs and Uzuner, 2015; Stubbs et al.,
2015) and state of the art performance on several
axes of the HIPAA PHI dataset.

Two works that we know of train contextual em-
bedding models on clinical corpora.

(Zhu et al., 2018) trains an ELMo model over
a corpus of mixed clinical discharge summaries,
clinical radiology notes and medically oriented
wikipedia articles, then demonstrates improved
performance on the i2b2 2010 task (Uzuner et al.,

3https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/
4https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/

2011). They release a pre-trained ELMo model
along with their work, enabling further clinical
NLP research to work with these powerful con-
textual embeddings.

(Si et al., 2019), released in late February 2019,
train a clinical note corpus BERT language model
and uses complex task-specific models to yield im-
provements over both traditional embeddings and
ELMo embeddings on the i2b2 2010 and 2012
tasks (Sun et al., 2013b,a) and the SemEval 2014
task 7 (Pradhan et al., 2014) and 2015 task 14 (El-
hadad et al.) tasks, establishing new state-of-the-
art results on all four corpora. However, this work
neither releases their embeddings for the larger
community nor examines the performance oppor-
tunities offered by fine-tuning BioBERT with clin-
ical text or by training note-type specific embed-
ding models, as we do.

3 Methods

In this section, we first describe our clinical text
dataset, the details of the BERT training proce-
dure, and finally the specific tasks we examine.

3.1 Data

We use clinical text from the approximately 2 mil-
lion notes in the MIMIC-III v1.4 database (John-
son et al., 2016). Details of our text pre-processing
procedure can be found in Appendix A. Note that
while some of our tasks use a small subset of
MIMIC notes in their corpora, we do not try to fil-
ter these notes out of our BERT pre-training proce-
dure. We expect the bias this induces is negligible
given the relative sizes of the two corpora.

We train two varieties of BERT on MIMIC
notes: Clinical BERT, which uses text from all
note types, and Discharge Summary BERT, which
uses only discharge summaries in an effort to tai-
lor the corpus to downstream tasks (which often
largely use discharge summaries).

Note that we train our clinical BERT instantia-
tions on all notes of the appropriate type(s), with-
out regard for whether or not any individual note
appeared in any of the train/test sets for the vari-
ous tasks we use (two of which use a small subset
of MIMIC notes either partially or completely as
their backing corpora). We feel this has a negligi-
ble impact given the dramatically larger size of the
entire MIMIC corpus relative to the various task
corpora.



74

3.2 BERT Training
In this work, we aim to provide the pre-trained
embeddings as a community resource, rather than
demonstrate technical novelty in the training pro-
cedure, and accordingly our BERT training pro-
cedure is completely standard. As such, we have
relegated specifics of the training procedure to Ap-
pendix B.

We trained two BERT models on clinical
text: 1) Clinical BERT, initialized from BERT-
Base, and 2) Clinical BioBERT, initialized from
BioBERT. For all downstream tasks, BERT mod-
els were allowed to be fine-tuned, then the out-
put BERT embedding was passed through a single
linear layer for classification, either at a per-token
level for NER or de-ID tasks or applied to the sen-
tinel “begin sentence” token for MedNLI. Note
that this is a substantially lower capacity model
than, for example, the Bi-LSTM layer used in (Si
et al., 2019). This reduced capacity potentially
limits performance on downstream tasks, but is in
line with our goal of demonstrating the efficacy of
clinical-specific embeddings and releasing a pre-
trained BERT model for these embeddings. We
did not experiment with more complex representa-
tions as our goal is not to necessarily surpass state-
of-the-art performances on these tasks.

Computational Cost Pre-processing and train-
ing BERT on MIMIC notes took significant com-
putational resources. We estimate that our en-
tire embedding model procedure took roughly 17
- 18 days of computational runtime using a single
GeForce GTX TITAN X 12 GB GPU (and signifi-
cant CPU power and memory for pre-processing
tasks). This is not including any time required
to download or setup MIMIC or to train any fi-
nal downstream tasks. 18 days of continuous run-
time is a significant investment and may be be-
yond the reach of some labs or institutions. This
is precisely why we believe that releasing our pre-
trained model will be useful to the community.

3.3 Tasks
The Clinical BERT and Clinical BioBERT mod-
els were applied to the MedNLI natural lan-
guage inference task (Romanov and Shivade,
2018) and four i2b2 named entity recognition
(NER) tasks, all in IOB format (Ramshaw and
Marcus, 1995): i2b2 2006 1B de-identification
(Uzuner et al., 2007), i2b2 2010 concept extrac-
tion (Uzuner et al., 2011), i2b2 2012 entity extrac-

2015; Stubbs et al., 2015). Details of the IOB for-
mat can be seen in the appendix, section C. All
task dataset sizes, evaluation metrics, and number
of classes are shown in Table 1.

Note that our two de-identification (de-ID)
datasets present synthetically-masked PHI in their
texts—e.g., they replace instances of real names,
hospitals, etc., with synthetic, but consistent and
realistic, names, hospitals, etc. As a result,
they present significantly different text distribu-
tions than traditionally de-identified text (such as
MIMIC notes) which will instead present sentinel
“PHI” symbols at locations where PHI was re-
moved.

4 Results & Discussions

In this section, we will first describe quantitative
comparisons of the various BERT models on the
clinical NLP tasks we considered, and second de-
scribe qualitative evaluations of the differences be-
tween Clinical- and Bio- BERT.

Clinical NLP Tasks Full results are shown in
Table 2. On three of the five tasks (MedNLI,
i2b2 2010, and i2b2 2012), clinically fine-tuned
BioBERT shows improvements over BioBERT
or general BERT. Notably, on MedNLI, clinical
BERT actually yields a new state of the art, yield-
ing a performance of 85.4% accuracy as compared
to the prior state of the art of 73.5% (Romanov and
Shivade, 2018) obtained via the InferSent model
(Conneau et al., 2017). However, on our two
de-ID tasks, i2b2 2006 and i2b2 2014, clinical
BERT offers no improvements over Bio- or gen-
eral BERT. This is actually not surprising, and is
instead, we argue, a direct consequence of the na-

ture of de-ID challenges.
De-ID challenge data presents a different data

distribution than MIMIC text. In MIMIC, PHI is
identified and replaced with sentinel PHI mark-
ers, whereas in the de-ID task, PHI is masked with
synthetic, but realistic PHI. This data drift would
be problematic for any embedding model, but will
be especially damaging to contextual embedding
models like BERT because the underlying sen-
tence structure will have changed: in raw MIMIC,
sentences with PHI will universally have a sentinel
PHI token. In contrast, in the de-ID corpus, all
such sentences will have different synthetic masks,
meaning that a canonical, nearly constant sentence
structure present during BERT’s training will be
non-existent at task-time. For these reasons, we
think it is sensible that clinical BERT is not suc-
cessful on the de-ID corpora. Furthermore, this
is a good example for the community given how
prevalent the assumption is that contextual embed-
ding models trained on task-like corpora will offer
dramatic improvements.

Overall, we feel our results demonstrates the
utility of using domain-specific contextual embed-
dings for non de-ID clinical NLP tasks. Addition-
ally, on one task Discharge Summary BERT offers
performance improvements over Clinical BERT,
so it may be that adding greater specificity to the
underlying corpus is helpful in some cases. We
release both models with this work for public use.

Qualitative Embedding Comparisons Table 3
shows the nearest neighbors for 3 words each
from 3 categories under BioBERT and Clinical
BERT. These lists suggest that Clinical BERT re-
tains greater cohesion around medical or clinic-
operations relevant terms than does BioBERT. For
example, the word “Discharge” is most closely
associated with “admission,” “wave,” and “sight”
under BioBERT, yet only the former seems rele-
vant to clinical operations. In contrast, under Clin-
ical BERT, the associated words all are meaningful
in a clinical operations context.

Limitations & Future Work This work has
several notable limitations. First, we do not ex-
periment with any more advanced model architec-
tures atop our embeddings. This likely hurts our
performance. Second, MIMIC only contains notes
from the intensive care unit of a single healthcare
institution (BIDMC). Differences in care practices
across institutions are significant, and using notes
from multiple institutions could offer significant
gains. Lastly, our model shows no improvements
for either de-ID task we explored. If our hypoth-
esis is correct as to its cause, a possible solution
could entail introducing synthetic de-ID into the
source clinical text and using that as the source for
de-ID tasks going forward.

5 Conclusion

In this work, we pretrain and release clinically ori-
ented BERT models, some trained solely on clini-
cal text, and others fine-tuned atop BioBERT. We
find robust evidence that our clinical embeddings
are superior to general domain or BioBERT spe-
cific embeddings for non de-ID tasks, and that us-
ing note-type specific corpora can induce further
selective performance benefits. To the best of our
knowledge, our work is the first to release clini-
cally trained BERT models. Our hope is that all
clinical NLP researchers will be able to benefit
from these embeddings without the necessity of
the significant computational resources required to
train these models over the MIMIC corpus.

A MIMIC Notes

MIMIC notes are distributed among 15 note types
(Figure 1). Many note types are semi-structured,
with section headers separating free text para-
graphs. To process these notes, we split all notes
into sections, then used Scispacy (Neumann et al.,
2019) (specifically, the en core sci md tok-
enizer) to perform sentence extraction. The sen-
tences are input into the BERT-Base and BioBERT
models for additional pre-training on clinical text.

B BERT Training Details

For all pre-training experiments, we leverage the
tensorflow implementation of BERT (Devlin et al.,
2018).5

B.1 Pre-training
We used a batch size of 32, a maximum sequence
length of 128, and a learning rate of 5 · 10−5 for
pre-training our models. Models were trained for
150,000 steps. We experimented with models pre-
trained for 300,000 steps, but we found no signif-
icant differences in downstream task performance
with these models. The dup factor for duplicat-
ing input data with different masks was set to 5.
All other default parameters were used (specifi-
cally, masked language model probability = 0.15
and max predictions per sequence = 20).

B.2 Fine-tuning
For all downstream tasks, we explored the follow-
ing hyperparameters: learning rate ∈ {2 · 10−5, 3 ·

5https://github.com/google-research/bert

10−5, 5 ·10−5}, batch size ∈ {16, 32}, and epochs
∈ {3, 4}. For the NER tasks, we also tried epoch
∈ {2}. The maximum sequence length was 150
across all tasks. Due to time constraints, only 2
epochs were run for the i2b2 2014 task.

C IOB Format

The IOB (Inside-Outside-Beginning) for-
mat (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) is a method
of encoding span-based NER tasks to add more
granularity to the label space over span positions,
specifically re-classifying each class as having
three subclasses:

Inside (I-) This label is used to specify words
within a span for this class.

Outside (O) This label is used to specify words
outside any span for this class. This label
will be shared across all classes and will re-
place the “no class” label applied to extrane-
ous words.

Beginning (B-) This label is used to specify
words at the beginning of a span for this
class.

For example, if the input text, with span labels
is given as
“The patient is very sick.”
with NER labels
“Null Null Null Problem Problem”
we could convert this into IOB format via
“O O O B-Problem I-Problem”
