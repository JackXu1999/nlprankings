Abstract

Human-targeted metrics provide a compromise between human evaluation of machine transla-
tion, where high inter-annotator agreement is difficult to achieve, and fully automatic metrics,
such as BLEU or TER, that lack the validity of human assessment. Human-targeted translation
edit rate (HTER) is by far the most widely employed human-targeted metric in machine transla-
tion, commonly employed, for example, as a gold standard in evaluation of quality estimation.
Original experiments justifying the design of HTER, as opposed to other possible formulations,
were limited to a small sample of translations and a single language pair, however, and this mo-
tivates our re-evaluation of a range of human-targeted metrics on a substantially larger scale.
Results show significantly stronger correlation with human judgment for HBLEU over HTER
for two of the nine language pairs we include and no significant difference between correlations
achieved by HTER and HBLEU for the remaining language pairs. Finally, we evaluate a range of
quality estimation systems employing HTER and direct assessment (DA) of translation adequacy
as gold labels, resulting in a divergence in system rankings, and propose employment of DA for
future quality estimation evaluations.

1 Introduction

Although human evaluation of translation quality in theory provides the most meaningful assessment of
machine translation (MT), achieving high levels of agreement between human assessors has proven chal-
lenging. For example, the annual Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation (WMT) provides large-
scale human evaluation of systems, and reports inter-annotator agreement ranging from 0.260 (WMT-
13) to 0.405 (WMT-15), with intra-annotator agreement not faring much better, from 0.407 (WMT-12)
to 0.595 (WMT-15) (Callison-Burch et al., 2012; Bojar et al., 2013; Bojar et al., 2015).1 Low agree-
ment levels in human annotation cause challenges for tasks that require evaluation of MT output on the
segment-level. For example, evaluation of MT quality estimation (QE) requires the comparison of sys-
tem predictions of translation quality with segment-level human assessment. Automatic metrics, such
as BLEU or TER, although fully repeatable, unfortunately lack the validity of human assessment and
are well-known to suffer from bias in favour of translations that happen to be superficially similar to
reference translations.

Part-automatic human-targeted metrics, however, are commonly employed as a substitute for hu-
man assessment on the segment-level, as they appear to provide a happy medium between fully auto-
matic metrics, that lack the validity of human assessment, and human assessment that lacks reliabil-
ity/reproducibility of automatic metrics. Human-targeted reference translations, each manually created
by minimally post-editing the individual MT output translation to be assessed, remove the bias usually
introduced by comparison with a generic reference. Subsequently an automatic component is applied to
quantify the error now present between the MT output and its human-targeted reference.

Although human-targeted metrics are indisputably more valid than their generic-reference counter-
parts, the scores they produce are nonetheless still partly automatic. Given the vast number of possible
methods of comparing a given MT output with its (human-targeted) reference translation, it is necessary
to provide evidence that any given choice of human-targeted metric provides the best formulaic substitute
for human assessment.

As with fully automatic metrics, human-targeted metrics are themselves evaluated by strength of cor-
relation with human assessment. For example, when the most widely applied human-targeted metric,
human-targeted translation edit rate (HTER) was first proposed, Snover et al. (2006) reported that “HTER
is more highly correlated to human judgments than BLEU or HBLEU” (p. 230), and hence, since 2006,
it is HTER, as opposed to HBLEU, that is employed in MT as a human assessment substitute.

2 Relevant Work

HTER is generally regarded as a valid substitute for human assessment. In MT QE, for example, HTER
scores are used to evaluate systems in large-scale shared tasks (Bojar et al., 2015; Graham, 2015). If a
metric such as HTER is to be relied upon as a substitute for human assessment, it is important that trust in
the metric is well-placed to avoid inaccuracies in empirical evaluations. For instance, Bojar et al. (2013)
and Graham (2015) make the assumption that HTER provides a valid representation of translation quality
and subsequently employ HTER scores as a gold standard representation when evaluating QE systems,
ultimately leading to rankings for competing systems. If HTER scores do not in fact provide a valid
representation of translation quality, however, system rankings are likely to be incorrect. On review of
experiments that originally led to trust in HTER as a substitute for human assessment, a possible disparity
emerges between the degree of trust placed in HTER and the limitations of original experiments. These
limitations include:

• A sample of translations produced by two distinct MT systems, one of known low-performance and
one known high-performance system;

• A single language pair (Arabic to English);
• A maximum of two human annotators per translation;
• Employment of human-targeted reference translations created by human post-editors coached to

specifically minimize HTER scores as opposed to other possible formulations.

The degree to which general conclusions can be drawn from experiments should reflect the extent to
which experiments were carried out, and the broad conclusions drawn that HTER has a strong correlation
with human assessment is not ideal considering experiments were limited to a small number of transla-
tions produced by two MT systems and for a single language pair. Furthermore, translations sampled
from systems that operate at the two extremes of performance, a known high quality system and a poorly
performing one, risks exaggeration of correlation with human assessment.

In addition, it is possible that issues in relation to levels of inter-annotator agreement, common in other
human evaluations, were also present in the human evaluation used in HTER experiments, as Snover et
al. (2006) report that “... the four-reference variants of TER and HTER correlate with human judgments
as well as – or better than – a second human judgment does” (p. 223). The fact that HTER scores
correlated with the quality assessments of one human assessor more than those of another, highlights
the likelihood that agreement between human annotators was low, although no precise agreement levels
are reported. If, for example, the correlation of scores produced by a (part-automatic) metric, such as
HTER, and human assessment scores provided by a given human assessor, Annotatora, is stronger than
the correlation between Annotatora and a second human annotator, Annotatorb, it follows that this latter
correlation, between human assessments of the two distinct annotators cannot be all that high. Choosing
to trust the annotations of Annotatora simply on the basis that those annotations yield a more favorable
correlation with HTER is not justified. The fact that part-automatic metric scores correlate better with
one human annotator than another is not evidence of how well the metric is performing, merely that the
human evaluation employed is somewhat unstable.

Finally, the comparison made between the correlation of HTER (with human assessment) and those of
other possible formulations, such as HBLEU, was unfortunately biased in favour of HTER, as Snover et
al. (2006) report “Annotators were coached on how to minimize the edit rate. The coaching given to the
annotators in order to minimize HTER, consisted mostly of teaching them which edits were considered
by TER. The annotators also consulted with each other during training to compare various techniques
they found to minimize HTER scores” (p. 227). A clear bias was therefore introduced into the compari-
son of correlations achieved by HTER and other human-targeted metrics, such as HBLEU for example,
by coaching post-editors specifically to reduce HTER scores. Although bias in favour of HTER was
identified in Snover et al. (2006), reporting “It is possible that performance of HTER is biased, as the tar-
geted references were designed to minimize TER scores rather than BLEU scores” (p. 228), this was not
highlighted or reconsidered when reporting correlations and drawing conclusions about the superiority
of HTER over other metrics.

In this paper, we repeat the original experiments to re-assess HTER as a human assessment substitute.
In doing so, we vastly expand experimental settings relative to the limitations of the original, as follows:

• Data sets include translations sampled from the output of 131 MT systems, operating at all levels of
performance;

• Correlations of HTER with human assessment are reported for nine language pairs;
• Evaluation is based on between 15 and 80 human assessments per translation – to overcome human

annotator agreement issues;

• Human-targeted reference translations are created without any coaching.

3 Re-evaluating Human-Targeted Metrics

As in evaluation of fully automatic metrics, evaluation of human-targeted metrics is by correlation with
human assessment. Like the original evaluation of HTER, our re-evaluation also operates on the segment-
level, with the performance of different possible human-targeted metric formulations measured by cor-
relation of metric scores with segment-level human assessment. To compute correlations for human-
targeted metrics, two distinct human annotations of each translation are required.

Firstly, we require a human assessment rating of the quality of each translation in order to compute
correlations of each human-targeted metric. Our evaluation additionally requires manually created post-
editions of each original MT output translation. This human post-edit is employed as the human-targeted
reference translation for computing human-targeted metric scores for translations. We firstly describe
the methodology employed for human assessment, before providing post-editing details.

3.1 Human Assessment of Translation Adequacy
Overall in this work, human assessment was carried out for two distinct data sets, firstly a nine language
pair data set to re-evaluate HTER and subsequently an English to Spanish data set (see Section 4.2).
Below we describe human assessment of the nine language pair data set.

Human direct assessment (DA) of the adequacy of translations was collected by means of a 100-point
continuous rating scale via crowd-sourcing. Large numbers of repeat human judgments for translations
were collected on Amazon Mechanical Turk, by way of re-implementation and minor adaptation of

Graham et al. (2015).2 Translations were sampled at random from all systems competing in WMT-13
translation task for Czech-to-English (CS-EN), German-to-English (DE-EN), Spanish-to-English (ES-
EN), French-to-English (FR-EN), Russian-to-English (RU-EN), English-to-German (EN-DE), English-
to-Spanish (EN-ES), English-to-French (EN-FR) and English-to-Russian (EN-RU). Human assessors
rated the adequacy of translations in a monolingual human evaluation by comparing the meaning of
the original generic human reference translation (rendered in gray) with a given MT output translation
(rendered in black) by stating the degree to which they agree that:3

The text in black adequately expresses the meaning of the text in gray in English.

Quality control was applied by comparison of ratings provided by each Mechanical Turk worker for
pairs of original and degraded translations hidden within HITs, where each pair contained an original
MT output translation along with a degraded version of that translation. Ratings of workers who were
not reliable (or at any point during the course of data collection became unreliable) in their ability to
accurately distinguish between the adequacy of degraded and original system output translations were
omitted from the final data set.

Between 15 and 80 (22.4 on average) human assessments of adequacy were collected per translation
and combined into a mean score for a given translation, after standardization of scores based on the
individual annotators mean and standard deviation rating. Table 1 shows numbers of human assessments
collected contributing to mean adequacy scores for translations.

3.2 Human-Targeted Reference Translations
A human-targeted reference translation was created for every translation in the data set by a known-
reliable volunteer post-editor native in the target language of the MT output in question. All human
post-editors were unaware of the purpose of the post-editing work and experiments. Annotators were
shown the reference and MT output with post-editing instructions as follows:4

(b) grammatically correct.

3.3 HTER Re-evaluation Results
Table 2 shows correlations achieved by a range of human-targeted metric formulations with human as-
sessment, including human-targeted versions of segment-level BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002; Koehn et
al., 2007), TER (Snover et al., 2006), WER, PER and CDER (Leusch and Ney, 2008). Correlations
with human assessment achieved by HTER are, for three of the nine language pairs we evaluate, below
a Pearson correlation of 0.6. In addition, comparison of correlations achieved by HTER and HBLEU
reveal a higher correlation achieved by HBLEU for five of the nine language pairs we evaluate.

As recommended by Graham et al. (2015), we test for significance of difference in dependent corre-
lations using Williams test, as shown in Figures 1 and 2. For two language pairs, DE-EN and FR-EN,
correlations achieved by HBLEU with human assessment are significantly stronger than those achieved
by HTER, and for all other language pairs, the difference in correlation achieved by HBLEU and HTER
is not statistically significant.

Table 2 also includes correlations achieved by all metrics with human assessment when the original
generic reference is employed. As expected correlations of generic-reference metrics are in all cases
substantially lower than that of their human-targeted counterparts.

3.4 Possibility of Reference Bias in Monolingual MT Assessment
As mentioned in Section 1, in automatic evaluation of MT reference bias is a known problem, as high
quality MT output can be unfairly penalized simply due to a lack of superficial similarity with the generic

reference translation. Although certainly not to the same extreme, human assessment of MT that employs
a reference translation could incur similar reference bias. Graham et al. (2013) provide discussion on
how reference bias could exist for direct assessment of translation adequacy, and, as a solution, propose
inclusion of a separate reference-free fluency assessment, to provide a component of the evaluation that
cannot be biased in any way by a reference translation.

However, it is inevitably the case that resources available to conduct human evaluation are limited, and
therefore a trade-off exists between adding fluency assessments of translations and numbers of transla-
tions we can feasibly include. For example, in our earlier human evaluation of HTER, it would have been
possible to allocate resources to assessment of the fluency of translations, in addition to adequacy, but
this would have come at the cost of reducing the size of the test set by approximately one half. Therefore,

the decision to include fluency should be weighed against the degree to which reference bias is actually
present in the adequacy evaluation. If there is strong reference bias, for example, it would be highly
advisable to include both fluency and adequacy but for a smaller number of translations.

Fomicheva and Specia (2016) investigate bias in monolingual evaluation of MT and conclude ref-
erence bias to be a serious issue, with human annotators strongly biased by the reference translation
provided. Their conclusion was based on estimation of confidence intervals for Kappa coefficients by
means of an unconventional resampling technique, where samples used to estimate confidence intervals
were smaller than the original sample size, drawn without replacement, and averaged; this diverges from
standard methods of confidence interval estimation, such as bootstrap resampling. As a result, the re-
ported confidence limits are unreliable, bringing their conclusions into question. We therefore consider
it necessary to investigate the effect of reference bias with respect to the human evaluation we employ,
to assess the likelihood of our own results with respect to the evaluation of HTER being contaminated
by strong reference bias.5

Reference bias is the attribution of unfairly low scores to translations simply because they are not su-
perficially similar to generic reference translations. In our evaluation of HTER, we employ DA adequacy
scores by human assessment, where the MT output is compared to a generic reference translation. We
will refer to DA scores collected in this way as DAgen-ref. It is these gold standard DAgen-ref scores that
potentially run the risk of introducing a strong reference bias into our evaluation of HTER.

At first, it might seem reasonable to attempt to measure this reference bias by comparison of DAgen-ref
scores for translations with scores from an equivalent bilingual human evaluation, where the MT output
is no longer compared to a reference translation, but is instead compared to the source language input and
evaluated by a bilingual speaker. We refer to DA scores collected in this way as DAsrc. However, in this
case, DAsrc scores could in fact include a different bias, one introduced by the fact that human assessors
are now non-native in at least one of the required languages. To complicate things further, since non-
native language skill levels will vary considerably from one human assessor to another, the degree of bias
is likely to change considerably depending on particular language ability levels. Therefore, in addition to
the potential of monolingual reference bias, we point out the real possibility in the case of DAsrc of bias
caused by reliance on bilingual human assessors not native in either the source or the target language.
A comparison between DAsrc and DAgen-ref scores for translations, therefore, would unfortunately not
provide a reliable measurement of the monolingual reference bias, since such a comparison could be
confounded by this additional bias.

Subsequently, we carry out a distinct comparison and motivate it as follows. Reference bias in
DAgen-ref scores should cause unfairly low scores for only some translations, those that do not closely
match generic reference translations but are in fact high quality translations. The difficulty in measur-

investigation including a single language pair in this current publication. We hope to provide a more detailed study in the near
future.

ing reference bias lies in separating the fair attribution of low scores to translations that do not closely
match the reference and are genuinely low quality from those that also do not correspond closely to a
given reference but nonetheless are in fact high quality. A comparison that would provide insight into
the degree to which reference bias exists for DAgen-ref is one that compares DAgen-ref scores with those
collected in a corresponding monolingual DA evaluation in which the surface similarity between MT
output and reference translations is maximized for all translations in the test set. In this way, translations
that have been unfairly penalized by DAgen-ref can be identified as having low DAgen-ref scores, when
unfairly evaluated by comparison with a dissimilar generic reference, while at the same time achieving
a high score when evaluated against a maximally similar reference translation. We therefore run DA
with reference translations that have maximal surface similarity to MT output translations, by creating a
human-targeted reference translation for each MT output.

3.4.1 DA with Source-Generated Human-Targeted References
In our earlier evaluation of HTER, human-targeted references were created by comparison with the
generic reference. To guard against reference-bias being introduced in this current experiment, human-
targeted references are now created without the use of the generic reference, instead by a bilingual exam-
ination of the original source language input and MT output only. We therefore employ a known-reliable
bilingual native speaker of the source language with high fluency in the target language, as well as a
known-reliable native speaker of the target language. In a first step, the bilingual post-edits the MT out-
put, and in a second step, the post-edited MT output is checked for fluency in the target language by the
monolingual in consultation with the bilingual to ensure human-targeted references remained faithful to
the meaning of the source input.6 We will refer to this additional set of DA scores as DAsrc-ht-ref. In this
way, translations that have been unfairly penalized by DAgen-ref can be identified as having low DAgen-ref
scores, when unfairly evaluated by comparison with a dissimilar generic reference, while at the same
time achieving a high DAsrc-ht-ref score when evaluated against a maximally similar reference translation.

3.4.2 Reference Bias in Monolingual MT Evaluation Experiment Results
Figure 3 (b) shows a scatter plot of DAsrc-ht-ref and DAgen-ref scores for our previous sample of RU-
EN translations originally sampled from WMT-13. If a set of translations scored by DAgen-ref include
reference bias, we would expect them to appear in the lower right quadrant of Figure 3 (b), as they will
receive a low DAgen-ref score in combination with a high DAsrc-ht-ref score. As can be seen from the lower
right portion of Figure 3 (b), only a small number of translations fall into the lower right quadrant, and the
small number that do, all lie in very close proximity to neighboring upper-right and lower-left quadrants.
Conversely, Figure 3 (a) shows the correspondence between DAsrc-ht-ref scores and the top-performing
metric for that language pair, CDER,7 where, in contrast, many translations, located in the lower right
quadrant, receive an unfairly low CDER score while being scored highly by DAsrc-ht-ref.

The lack of translations simultaneously receiving a low DAgen-ref score and high DAsrc-ht-ref score
indicates that even though DAgen-ref employs a generic reference translation, scores are not strongly
biased by the presence of this reference translation. This reinforces the validity of our human evaluation
methodology, and should provide reassurance that in our direct assessment set-up, human assessors do in
fact apply their human intelligence to the task, by reading a given translation and comparing its meaning
to that of the generic reference, as instructed, as opposed to attributing scores to translations based on
mere surface similarities between the MT output and generic reference translation.

4 Machine Translation Quality Estimation and Human-targeted Metrics

The now apparent lack of reliability of HTER as a valid substitute for human assessment raises doubts as
to whether or not HTER scores should be relied upon as a gold standard representation for tasks such as
QE, where the ultimate goal of systems is to predict translation quality. For example, previous evaluations
of quality estimation systems have made the assumption that HTER provides a reliable human evaluation

Figure 3: (a) Correspondence between DA scores collected by comparison with a source-generated
human-targeted reference translation, DA src-ht-ref, where all translations benefit equally from close
similarity to human-targeted references and automatic metric scores, CDER gen-ref, known to be biased
by the generic reference and (b) the same instead compared to DA scores collected with comparison to
generic reference translations, DA gen-ref. Lack of translations appearing in the lower right quadrant

substitute, but since we now know that HTER scores can be unrepresentative of translation quality, we
rerun the previous evaluation provided by Bojar et al. (2013) and subsequently Graham (2015), instead
employing DA human assessment as gold standard labels.

4.1 Human Annotation

Human-targeted reference translations were readily available in the WMT-13 shared task data set, while
the human assessment method described in Section 3.1, was again applied to translations via crowd-
sourcing on Mechanical Turk, again applying strict quality control and computing mean scores for indi-
vidual translations from a minimum of 15 human assessments. All human assessors who passed qual-
ity control by having significantly different scores for degraded versus genuine MT system output also
showed no significant difference between mean rating scores for exact repeat translations.

Figure 4 (a) plots correspondence between HTER scores and human assessment, where the correlation
of HTER with human assessment achieved is 0.678, almost at the same level as the strongest correlation
in our nine-language pair evaluation. This data set therefore provides a best-case scenario for comparing
differences in QE system rankings when HTER, as opposed to when human assessment, is employed as
gold labels.

Before we compare QE system rankings, however, we carry out an analysis of a somewhat surprising
relationship between HTER scores and human assessment for some translations shown in the scatter-plot
in Figure 4 (a), where a number of translations appear to achieve a perfect HTER score of zero while at
the same time cover a wide range of different human adequacy levels. Achieving a perfect HTER score
means that the MT output was considered completely correct and required no post-editing whatsoever,
so observing perfect HTER scores for translations that also receive low human assessment scores is a
likely indication that something is amiss with either the post-editing carried out to create human-targeted
references used to compute HTER scores or the human assessment.

Details of two example translations are provided in Figure 5. In Example 1, the source of error is
the human post-editor (WMT-13 data set), since the MT output was in fact ungrammatical and despite
this went uncorrected by the human post-editor, and this subsequently yielded an incorrect HTER score.
Conversely, the error in Example 2 is caused by there being no direct translation of straightforward
in Spanish and something unexpected subsequently taking place. Both the generic reference and the

range of human assessment scores, where ∗denotes text ungrammatical in Spanish; generic ref. = the
generic reference displayed to human assessors; MT = the MT output or human-targeted reference (HT
ref.) employed by HTER (the latter being one and the same for translations receiving a perfect HTER
score).

MT output could both be considered correct translations of the source while at the same time each of
their meanings diverges somewhat from the other. Since the generic reference is employed for human
assessment, the translation receives a low human adequacy score, despite it being a good translation of
the original. Although human assessment is more valid than part-automatic metric scores, neither method
is entirely impervious to other sources of error, therefore.

4.2 Quality Estimation Results

Table 3 shows correlations of QE system predictions with gold labels, where the rank order of systems
diverges considerably when gold labels take the form of HTER scores as opposed to human assessment.

Significance test results for differences in correlation with human assessment for each pair of compet-
ing systems are provided in Figure 4 (b), where a new distinct outright winner of the task is identified
that significantly outperforms all others, when evaluated with human assessment, as CMU-ISL-noB.

Table 3: Pearson correlation of QE system predictions with HTER scores and correlation of system
predictions with DA human adequacy scores for WMT-13 QE Task 1.1

The divergence in system rankings between evaluation of systems with HTER compared to DA in-
dicates that even in the case that HTER correlates with human assessment to a relatively strong degree,
0.678, HTER is not a sufficient stand-in for human assessment. We subsequently recommend, where pos-
sible, employment of DA human assessment for evaluation of quality estimation systems, as it provides
a valid human assessment without an automatic component, and has been shown to produce replicable
sentence-level human assessment scores for translations (Graham et al., 2015).

5 Conclusion

Concerns were raised about the reliability of conclusions drawn in past experiments about HTER’s supe-
riority to other human-targeted metric formulations, and issues with respect to human post-editor coach-
ing were highlighted as a source of bias, in addition to limited experiment settings. Subsequently, this
motivated our re-evaluation of HTER extending to include a large number of systems across nine differ-
ent language pairs. Results of our re-evaluation of HTER and several other possible metrics, including
HBLEU, reveal significantly stronger correlations with human assessment for HBLEU compared to those
achieved by HTER for two language pairs and no significant difference present in all other cases.

Further results showed correlations achieved by HTER may vary considerably across language pairs
and in some cases are too low to provide a valid substitute for human assessment. As a test-case we
replicated a previous quality estimation shared task and even when HTER scores correlate with human
assessment at 0.678, they do not provide a valid human assessment substitute, with system rankings
diverging considerably when DA human assessment is employed. We recommend DA human assessment
for future evaluation of quality estimation.
