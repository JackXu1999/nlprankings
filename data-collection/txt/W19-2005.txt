with Paraphrase Recognition and Generation Tasks

Abstract

In this paper, we investigate whether multilin-
gual neural translation models learn stronger
semantic abstractions of sentences than bilin-
gual ones. We test this hypotheses by mea-
suring the perplexity of such models when ap-
plied to paraphrases of the source language.
The intuition is that an encoder produces bet-
ter representations if a decoder is capable
of recognizing synonymous sentences in the
same language even though the model is never
trained for that task. In our setup, we add 16
different auxiliary languages to a bidirectional
bilingual baseline model (English-French) and
test it with in-domain and out-of-domain para-
phrases in English. The results show that
the perplexity is significantly reduced in each
of the cases, indicating that meaning can be
grounded in translation. This is further sup-
ported by a study on paraphrase generation
that we also include at the end of the paper.

1 Introduction

An appealing property of encoder-decoder mod-
els for machine translation is the effect of com-
pressing information into dense vector-based rep-
resentations to map source language input onto ad-
equate translations in the target language. How-
ever, it is not clear to what extent the model actu-
ally needs to model meaning to perform that task;
especially for related languages, it is often not nec-
essary to acquire a deep understanding of the in-
put to translate in an adequate way. The intu-
ition that we would like to explore in this paper
is based on the assumption that an increasingly
difficult training objective will enforce stronger
abstractions. In particular, we would like to see
whether multilingual machine translation models
learn representations that are closer to language-
independent meaning representations than bilin-
gual models do. Hence, our hypothesis is that

representations learned from multilingual data sets
covering a larger linguistic diversity better reflect
semantics than representations learned from less
diverse material. This hypothesis is supported by
the findings of related work focusing on univer-
sal sentence representation learning from multi-
lingual data (Artetxe and Schwenk, 2018; Artetxe
and Schwenk, 2018; Schwenk and Douze, 2017)
to be used in natural language inference or other
downstream tasks. In contrast to related work, we
are not interested in fixed-size sentence represen-
tations that can be fed into external classifiers or
regression models. Instead, we would like to fully
explore the use of the encoded information in the
attentive recurrent layers as they are produced by
the seq2seq model.

Our basic framework consists of a standard
attentional sequence-to-sequence model as com-
monly used for neural machine translation (Sen-
nrich et al., 2017), with the multilingual extension
proposed by Johnson et al. (2016). This extension
allows a single system to learn machine transla-
tion for several language pairs, and crucially also
for language pairs that have not been seen during
training. We use Bible translations for training, in
order to keep the genre and content of training data
constant across languages, and to enable further
studies on increasing levels of linguistic diversity.
We propose different setups, all of which share the
characteristics of having some source data in En-
glish and some target data in English. We can
then evaluate these models on their capacity of
recognizing and generating English paraphrases,
i.e. translating English to English without explic-
itly learning that task. Starting with a base model
using French–English and English–French train-
ing data, we select 16 additional languages as aux-
iliary information that are added to the base model,
each of them separately.

There is a large body of related work on



36

paraphrase generation using machine translation
(Quirk et al., 2004; Finch et al., 2004; Prakash
et al., 2016) based on parallel monolingual cor-
pora (Lin et al., 2014; Fader et al., 2013),
pivot-based translation (Bannard and Callison-
Burch, 2005; Mallinson et al., 2017) and para-
phrase databased extracted from parallel corpora
(Ganitkevitch et al., 2013). Related work on
multilingual sentence representation (Artetxe and
Schwenk, 2018; Schwenk and Douze, 2017; Lam-
ple and Conneau, 2019) has focused on fixed-
size vector representations that can be used in
natural language inference (Conneau et al., 2018;
Eriguchi et al., 2018) or other downstream tasks
such as bitext mining (Artetxe and Schwenk,
2018) or (cross-lingual) document classification
(Schwenk and Li, 2018).

2 Experimental Setup

For our experiments, we apply a standard at-
tentional sequence-to-sequence model with BPE-
based segmentation. We use the Nematus-style
models (Sennrich et al., 2017) as implemented
in MarianNMT (Junczys-Dowmunt et al., 2018).
These models apply gated recurrent units (GRUs)
in the encoder and decoder with a bi-directional
RNN on the encoder side. The word embeddings
have a dimensionality of 512 and the RNN dimen-
sionality is set to 1,024. We enable layer normal-
ization and we use one RNN layer in both, encoder
and decoder.

In training we use dynamic mini-batches to au-
tomatically fit the allocated memory (3GB in our
case) based on sentence length in the selected sam-
ple of data. The optimization procedure applies
Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2015) with mean cross-
entropy as the optimization criterion. We also
enable length normalization, exponential smooth-
ing, scaling dropout for the RNN layers with ra-
tio 0.2 and also apply source and target word
dropout with ratio 0.1. All of these values are
recommended settings that have empirically been
found in the related literature. For testing con-
vergence, we use independent development data
of roughly 1,000 test examples and BLEU scores
to determine the stopping criterion, which is set
to five subsequent failures of improving the val-
idation score. The translations are done with a
beam search decoder of size 12. The validation
frequency is set to run each 2,500 mini-batches.

For the multilingual setup, we follow Johnson

et al. (2016) by adding target language flags to
the source text placing them as pseudo tokens in
the beginning of each input sentence. We always
train models in both directions enabling the model
to read and generate the same language without
explicitly training that task (i.e. paraphrasing is
modeled as zero-shot translation). BPE (Sennrich
et al., 2016) is used to avoid unknown words and
to improve generalisations. Note that in our setup
we need to ensure that subword-level segmenta-
tions are consistent for each language involved in
several translation tasks. We opted for language-
dependent BPE models with 10,000 merge opera-
tions for each code table. The total vocabulary size
then depends on the combination of languages that
we use in training but the vocabulary stays exactly
the same for each language involved in all experi-
ments.

2.1 Training data and configurations

The main data we use for our experiments comes
from a collection of Bible translations (Mayer and
Cysouw, 2014) that includes over a thousand lan-
guages. For high-density languages like English
and French, various alternatives are available (see
Table 1). Using the Bible makes it possible to
easily extend our work with additional languages
representing a wide range of linguistic variation,
while at the same time keeping genre and content
constant across languages.

For the sake of discussion, we selected English

as our pivot language that we will use for evaluat-
ing the ability of the model to act as a paraphrase
model. Furthermore, we took French as a second
language to create a bilingual baseline model that
can translate in both directions. As additional aux-
iliary languages, we then apply the ones listed in
Table 1 together with some basic statistics of the
training data. The idea behind the language se-
lection is to create a somewhat diverse set of lan-
guages representing different amounts of coverage
and typological relationships. The set is easy to
extend but training requires extensive resources,
which necessarily limits our selection at this point.

In the general setup, we do not include any pairs
of English Bible translations as we do not want to
evaluate a model that is specifically trained for a
paraphrasing task. However, for comparison we
also create a model comprising all pairs of En-
glish translation variants, which will serve as an
upper bound (or rather, a lower bound in terms of
perplexity) for models that are trained without ex-
plicit paraphrase data.

Exhaustively looking at all possible subsets of
languages is not possible even with our small se-
lection of 18 languages. Therefore, we restricted
our study to the following test cases:

Bilingual model: A model trained on all com-
binations of English and French Bible transla-
tions. Each pair of aligned Bible verses represents
two training instances, one for English-to-French
and one for French-to-English. We also include
French-to-French training instances using identi-
cal sentences in the input and output, in order to

guide the model to correctly learn the semantics
of the language flags.1

Trilingual models: Translation models trained on
all bilingual combinations of Bibles in three lan-
guages – English, French and another auxiliary
language (in both directions) + identical French
verse pairs.
Multilingual model: One model that includes
all languages in our test set with training data in
both directions (translating from and to English or
French) + identical French verse pairs.
Paraphrase model: A model trained on combina-
tions of English Bible translations (the supervised
upper bound).

Note that all models (including the bilingual
one) cover the same English data including all
Bible variants. We use exactly the same vocab-
ulary for the English portion of each setup and no
new English data is added at any point and any
change that we observe when testing with English
paraphrase tasks is due to the auxiliary languages
that we add to the model as a translational training
objective.

2.2 Test data

For our experiments, we apply test sets from two
domains. One of them represents in-domain data
from the Bible collection that covers 998 verses

1 During our initial experiments, we realized that the lan-
guage labels did not always pick up the information about the
target language they are supposed to indicate. Especially in
the bilingual case this makes sense as the model always sees
the same language pair and identifying the source language is
enough to determine what kind of output language it needs to
generate. The label is not necessary and, therefore, ignored.

from the New Testament that we held out of train-
ing and development sets. Our second test set
comes from a very different source, namely data
collected from user-contributed translations that
are on-line in the Tatoeba database.2 They include
everyday expressions with translations in a large
number of languages. As the collection includes
translation alternatives, we can treat them as para-
phrases of each other. We extracted altogether
3,873 pairs of synonymous sentences in English.

From both test data sources, we create a single-
reference test set for paraphrase recognition and a
multi-reference test set for paraphrase generation.
The single-reference Bible test set uses the Stan-
dard English Bible as the source, and the Com-
mon English Bible3 as the reference. The multi-
reference Bible test set uses the Amplified Bible
as the source (the first one on our list), and all 18
other English Bibles as the references.

The Tatoeba single-reference test set contains
all 3,873 synonymous sentence pairs. For the
multi-reference test set, we filtered the data to ex-
clude near-identical sentence pairs by expanding
contractions (like ”I’m” to ”I am”) that are quite
common in the data and removed all pairs that dif-
fer only in punctuation after that procedure. Fur-
thermore, we merged alternatives of the same sen-
tence into synonym sets and created, thus, a multi-
reference corpus for testing containing a total of
2,444 sentences with their references.

3 Results

We evaluate the models on two tasks: (1) para-
phrase recognition and (2) paraphrase generation.

3CEB is an ambitious new translation rather than a revi-

sion of other translations (https://www.biblegateway.com).

The following sections summarize our main find-
ings in relation to these two tasks. We also eval-
uated the actual translation performance to ensure
that the models are properly trained. The results of
that test are listed in the supplementary material.

3.1 Paraphrase Recognition

First of all, we would like to know how well our
translation models are capable of handling para-
phrased sentences. For this, we compute perplex-
ity scores of the various models when observing
English output sentences for given English input
coming from the two paraphrase test sets. The
intuition is that models with a higher level of se-
mantic abstraction in the encoder should be less
surprised by seeing paraphrased sentences on the
decoder side, which will result in a lower perplex-
ity.

Let us first look at the in-domain data from our
Bible test set. Figure 1 (left half) illustrates the
reduction in perplexity when adding languages to
our bilingual model. The figure is sorted by de-
creasing perplexities. While the picture does not
reveal any clear pattern about the languages that
help the most, we can see that they all contribute to
an improved perplexity in comparison to the bidi-
rectional English-French model. Breton is clearly
the least useful language, without doubt due to
the size of that language in our collection. Note
that a further 5% perplexity reduction over the
best trilingual model is achieved by the model that
combines all languages (perplexity of 7.23, which
is very close to the lower bound of 6.05).

The picture is similar but with a slightly differ-
ent pattern on out-of-domain data. Figure 1 (right
half) shows the same plot for the Tatoeba test set
with languages sorted in the same order as in the
previous figure. Adding languages helps again,

which is re-assuring, but the amount is less pro-
nounced and further away from the lower bound
(which is, however, to be expected in this setup).
Again, Breton is not helping as much. Further-
more, in the out-of-domain case, the model com-
bining all languages actually does not improve the
perplexity any further (the value of 42.63 is similar
to other trilingual models), which is most probably
due to the strong domain mismatch that influences
the scores significantly.

To further demonstrate the problems of the
bilingual model to learn proper semantic represen-
tations that can be used for paraphrase detection,
we can also have a look at the learning curves
in Figure 2. The first plot nicely shows that the
perplexity scores on paraphrase data do not fol-
low the smooth line of the validation data in En-
glish and French whereas the models that include
auxiliary languages have the capability to improve
the model with respect to paraphrase recognition
throughout the training procedure in a similar way
as the main objective (translation) is optimized.
The model that combines all languages achieves
by far the lowest paraphrase perplexity. Learning
curves of other trilingual models look very similar
to the one included here.

3.2 Paraphrase Generation

This second experiment aims at testing the capac-
ity of the NMT models to generate paraphrases
of the input instead of translations. The hypoth-
esis is that the generated sentences will preserve
the meaning of the input, but not necessarily the
same form, such that the generated sentences can
be viewed as genuine paraphrases of the input sen-
tences.

Good paraphrase models should produce sen-

tences that are as close as possible to one of the
references, yet as different as possible from the
source. The first part can be measured by com-
mon machine translation metrics such as BLEU
(Papineni et al., 2002), which supports multiple
references. The second part can be measured by
specific paraphrase quality metrics such as PINC
(Chen and Dolan, 2011), which computes the pro-
portion of non-overlapping n-grams between the
source and the generated paraphrase. Good para-
phrases should thus obtain high BLEU as well as
high PINC scores on some paraphrase test set.

Figure 3 plots BLEU scores against PINC
scores for the two test sets (lowercased and ignor-
ing punctuations), the alternative English transla-
tions in the heldout data from the Bible and the
Tatoeba paraphrase set. We exclude the bilingual
model and the Breton model from the graphs, as
they have BLEU scores close to 0 and PINC scores
close to 100% due to the output being generated in
the wrong language.

The figures show a more or less linear correla-
tion between BLEU and PINC. This is expected
to a certain extent, as there is a clear trade-off be-
tween producing varied sentences (higher PINC)
and preserving the meaning of the source sen-
tence (higher BLEU). However, we find that the
model containing all languages shows the over-
all best performance (e.g., according to the arith-
metic mean of PINC and BLEU). This suggests
that a highly multilingual model provides indeed
more abstract internal representations that eventu-
ally lead to higher-quality paraphrases. We also
conclude that additional languages with large and
diverse (i.e., many different Bibles) datasets are
better at preserving the meaning of the source sen-
tence. However, there is no obvious language fam-

ily or similarity effect.
The Tatoeba test set yields much lower BLEU

scores than the Bible test set, due to the large num-
ber of unseen words and constructions, and also
because the Tatoeba test set has only an average
of 1.1 reference paraphrases per sentence, whereas
the Bible test set has 18 references for each verse.
This is most probably also the reason why the mul-
tilingual model including all languages (ALL) per-
forms worse than most other models in terms of
BLEU scores for the Tatoeba paraphrase test. It
is highly likely that plausible paraphrases are not
part of the test set if it only includes one or very
few references like it is the case with Tatoeba,
which is obviously a short-coming of BLEU as a
metric for paraphrase evaluation.

Table 2 shows some examples of paraphrases
generated from the Bible and Tatoeba test set. One
can see that different models tend to produce dif-
ferent paraphrases while preserving the general
meaning of the source sentence at least in the case
of the Bible data. Tatoeba is more problematic due
to the domain mismatch and we will come back to
that issue in the discussions further down.

One caveat is that paraphrase generation could
trivially be achieved by copying the input to the
output especially when evaluating the results us-
ing BLEU. Therefore, we also measured the per-
centage of identical copies that each model pro-
duces leaving out punctuations and lowercasing
the data. The results show that copying is a rare
case for the multilingual models and the input is
only matched in at most 1.4% of the cases (for
Bible data) and at most 5.1% of the cases in the
Tatoeba test set. However, adding English-English
training data changes this behaviour dramatically,
increasing the copying effect to over 70% of the
cases in both test sets, which breaks the use of

such models as a paraphrase generator. This hap-
pens even though we train on pairs of different
Bible translations into English, effectively train-
ing a paraphrase model with supervised learning.
Details of this evaluation are given in the supple-
mentary material.

Finally, we can also observe the effect of do-
main mismatch between the training data and the
Tatoeba test set. A considerable proportion of
the test vocabulary refers to contemporary ob-
jects which obviously do not appear in the Bible
training corpus, and it will, thus, be difficult
for the model to generate adequate paraphrases.
A few examples of sentences containing out-of-
vocabulary words are shown in Figure 4. They in-
dicate that the models are able to partially grasp
the semantics of concepts and sentences often try-
ing to replace unknown expressions with creative
but reasonable alternatives coming from the con-
text of the Bible. However, this observation calls
for a more systematic evaluation of the semantic
similarity of paraphrases than it is done by n-gram
overlap with reference paraphrases, which is, un-
fortunately, out of the scope of this paper.

4 Conclusions

We have presented a study on the meaning rep-
resentations that can be learned from multilingual
data sets. We show that additional linguistic di-
versity lead to stronger abstractions and we verify
our intuitions with a paraphrase scoring task that
measures perplexity of multilingual sequence-to-
sequence models. We also investigate the ability
of translation models to generate paraphrases and
conclude that this is indeed possible with promis-
ing results even without diversified decoders. In
the future, we will try to push the model further
to approach truly language-independent meaning
representation based on massively parallel data
sets as additional translational grounding. We will
also study the model with bigger and less homoge-
nous data sets and compare it to other approaches
to paraphrase generation including pivot-based
back-translation models. Furthermore, we will test
sentence representations obtained by multilingual
NMT models with additional downstream tasks to
further support the main claims of the paper.
