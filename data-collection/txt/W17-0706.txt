Abstract

Japanese speakers have a choice between
canonical SOV and scrambled OSV word
order to express the same meaning. Al-
though previous experiments examine the
influence of one or two factors for scram-
bling in a controlled setting, it is not yet
known what kinds of multiple effects con-
tribute to scrambling. This study uses nat-
urally distributed data to test the multiple
effects on scrambling simultaneously. A re-
gression analysis replicates the NP length
effect and suggests the influence of noun
types, but it provides no evidence for syn-
tactic priming, given-new ordering, and the
animacy effect. These findings only show
evidence for sentence-internal factors, but
we find no evidence that discourse level
factors play a role.

1 Introduction

Speakers constantly make choices about the form
of their utterances such as referring expressions
(Givón, 1983; Ariel, 1990; Gundel et al., 1993)
and word order (Bock and Irwin, 1980; Arnold et
al., 2000; Birner and Ward, 2009). For example,
Japanese speakers have a choice between canoni-
cal SOV and scrambled OSV to convey the same
meaning of the sentence as in (1).

‘Taro chased the dog.’

b. Inu-o

‘Taro chased the dog.’

The positioning of the direct object in (1b), scram-
bling (Saito, 1985; Saito and Hoji, 1983; Miya-

gawa, 1997), is known to be sensitive to such fac-
tors as length of the noun phrase (Yamashita and
Chang, 2001), structural priming (Yamashita et al.,
2002), given-new ordering of discourse participants
(Ferreira and Yoshita, 2003), and animacy (Tanaka
et al., 2011).

These experiments in language production ex-
amine the influence of one or two factors in a con-
trolled experimental setting with a set of homoge-
neous stimuli that typically occur infrequently in
the real world. However, as intensively discussed
in Jaeger (2010), speakers’ choices of sentence
structure rather depend on the presence and inter-
action of multiple factors that are influenced by the
probability distribution of preceding inputs.

This study complements previous psycholinguis-
tic experiments in Japanese scrambling. We use a
more representative set of Japanese sentences than
those used in previous language production experi-
ments and simultaneously test multiple effects on
scrambling using a single regression analysis. This
effort constitutes an initial step toward understand-
ing Japanese scrambling in the wild that goes be-
yond laboratory data. The analysis replicates the
effect of noun phrase length and suggests the in-
fluence of noun types, but it provides no evidence
for syntactic priming, given-new ordering, and the
animacy effect.

2.1 Language production experiments

Although a body of research concerns the com-
prehension of scrambled sentences in Japanese
(Koizumi and Tamaoka, 2010; Koizumi and Ima-
mura, 2016, among many), the production counter-
part has not been investigated to the same extent.
Previous findings suggest that (i) Japanese speakers
tend to put a longer object before a short subject
via scrambling (Yamashita and Chang, 2001), (ii)

41



tend to produce the same structure as the prime
sentence (Yamashita et al., 2002), (iii) are more
likely to position animate entities earlier in the sen-
tence than inanimate entities independent of their
grammatical role and assign the subject role to an-
imate entities (Tanaka et al., 2011), and (iv) tend
to produce given arguments before new, where this
effect is stronger when the previous mention of the
given argument is lexically identical (Ferreira and
Yoshita, 2003).

These experiments examine one or two hypothe-
ses in a controlled setting to capture a precise mech-
anism of language production. However, it remains
unknown whether and to what extent multiple ef-
fects contribute to observable behavior. This study
complements these works by simultaneously test-
ing multiple effects with naturally distributed data.

2.2 Corpus studies

Corpus studies examine the effect of some of the
factors suggested above with more natural linguis-
tic data. In Yamashita (2002), 19 scrambled sen-
tences are found out of 2,635 sentences in Japanese
magazines. Of these 19 scrambled sentences, 14
involve scrambling of “heavy” constituents that
contain relative or subordinate clauses and 5 sen-
tences contain anaphoric expressions that refer to
preceding entities.

Imamura (2016) measures salience and informa-
tion decay to investigate the distribution of subjects
and objects in both SOV and OSV. He counts how
many sentences stand between the argument and
its referent to measure salience of the referent and
how many times the argument is referred to after
the target sentence to measure information decay.
Analysis of 100 sentences for each word order that
are randomly extracted from contemporary writ-
ten Japanese texts (Maekawa et al., 2014) shows
that the referent of the scrambled object tends to
occur close to the scrambled sentence (i.e., old in-
formation), but is mentioned less frequently than
the subject in successive sentences (i.e., not topi-
cal).

Although they explore more natural data than
previous production experiments, they do not an-
alyze the influence of multiple factors. Crucially,
the sample size also is either limited (19 scram-
bled sentences in Yamashita (2002)) or intention-
ally balanced (100 sentences for each word order
in Imamura (2016)). Moreover, they hand-code
relevant information. These shortcomings make

This study scales up these corpus studies by ex-

ploiting existing corpus annotations and by using a
regression model that simultaneously tests multiple
factors while handing unbalanced data. The follow-
ing section describes the corpus and predictors in
the analysis.

3 Predicting scrambling in Japanese

3.1 Corpus

We use NAIST Text Corpus (Iida et al., 2007) con-
taining 2,929 documents (38,384 sentences) from
Japanese newspapers. The corpus includes annota-
tions of predicate-argument structure, event nouns,
and coreferences along with morphological and
syntactic information.

We use annotated dependency relations between
arguments and the predicate to extract scrambled
and canonical word order sentences. We extract
pairs of nominative (NP with case marker -ga) and
accusative (NP with case marker -o) arguments
that depend on the same predicate (active voice
only) as illustrated in Figure 1. We then check
the linear order of these arguments. The result
is 185 scrambled sentences and 2,918 canonical
word order sentences. We exclude null arguments,
which occur frequently in Japanese. The relatively
small number of extracted sentences is primarily
attributable to this exclusion.

3.2 Predictors

Based on previous findings as in Section 2, we
extract the following information from the corpus
and include it in the analysis.

Syntactic priming: We approximate the syn-
tactic priming effect (Yamashita et al., 2002) us-
ing equation (1). It decays exponentially with the
distance between the target sentence si and the

Table 1: Logistic model predicting scrambling for each sentence

there is no scrambled sentence in the preceding

likely speakers produce a scrambled sentence. We
set this value at 0.01 in the analysis.

f(di,j) =
{
e−di,j/a if sj exists
α if no sj

(1)

Given-new ordering: We measure the effect
of given-new ordering, in particular, the effect of
lexically identical mentions (Ferreira and Yoshita,
2003) by using the same function in (1). If there
is a lexically identical word in the preceding dis-
course, we compute the distance between the target
sentence si and the sentence containing the lexi-
cally identical word. We check all content words in
the maxNP (a maximally spanning noun phrase as
in Figure 1) and use the closest previous mention
for computation. This is not a precise representa-
tion of given-new ordering in that we do not use
coreference relations in contrast to Imamura (2016)
that hand-annotated coreferences including bridg-
ing references.1

Length: The length of subject and object
maxNPs in letters are included because the length
has been shown to affect scrambling in Japanese
(Yamashita and Chang, 2001; Yamashita, 2002).

Noun type: Scrambling is also correlated with
animacy (Tanaka et al., 2011). There is no avail-
able animacy annotation in Japanese, but nouns
in the NAIST Text Corpus are annotated with the
type of information, such as proper names, verbal
nouns, and formal nouns. Verbal nouns such as
kettei ‘decision’ and suisen ‘recommendation’ can
be verbs with the addition of a light verb -suru ‘do’.

1The NAIST Text corpus includes coreference annotation,
but there are only 8 scrambled objects that are coreference-
annotated. On the other hand, there are 92 scrambled objects
that include lexically identical mentions (old information).

Formal nouns such as -koto and -mono are a kind of
nominalizer that lacks semantic content. Some for-
mal nouns such as -koto and -no often function as
a complementizer that takes a clausal complement
(Inoue, 1976). We include these noun types in the
analysis to capture automatically a coarse distinc-
tion between animate nouns and event/clausal ex-
pressions. Only the types of head nouns (illustrated
in Figure 1) are included in the analysis. Other
noun types such as common nouns (e.g., ‘cat’ and
‘society’) and temporal nouns (e.g., ‘tomorrow’)
are excluded, but they account for the majority of
the nouns in the corpus (about 65%).

4 Results

We use a logistic regression model wherein the out-
come variable is the word order —i.e., scrambled
or canonical. We include all predictors described
above. The model was fitted using glm in R. Ta-
ble 1 summarizes coefficient estimates β̂, standard
errors SE(β̂), associated Wald’s z-score, and the
significance level p for the predictors described
above. Positive (negative) coefficients indicate a
higher (lower) probability of scrambling. We also
report the chi-square value that indicates how much
the model is improved by including the predictor.
We use the variance inflation factor to assess multi-
collinearity. Scores range between 1.01 and 1.19,
suggesting non-significant influence on the reliabil-
ity of the parameter estimates (Neter et al., 1996).

Syntactic priming (mean = 0.03, sd = 0.12) fails
to achieve significance, primarily because of the
distribution of scrambled sentences: only two occur
in the same document.2

Given-new ordering does not attain significance
(subject: mean = 0.42, sd = 0.40, object: mean

2Including scrambled sentences with topicalized objects
(case marker -wa) in the analysis did not boost syntactic prim-
ing, as only 112 such sentences occur in the corpus.

= 0.3, sd = 0.38), probably because there is no
contrast between scrambled objects and scrambled
subjects/canonical objects. 3

The significant negative correlation with the
length of subject NP and the positive correlation
with the length of object NP replicate previous stud-
ies. The empirical distribution of the proportion of
scrambling by the length of subjects and objects in
Figure 2 confirms this tendency.

Noun type highly influences the choice of scram-
bling. A negative correlation of SUBJECT-VERBAL
seemingly conflicts with the animacy effect at first
glance, but post-hoc examination of the distribu-
tion of noun types in Table 2 shows that SUBJECT-
VERBAL tends to occur with OBJECT-VERBAL,
compared to SUBJECT-FORMAL and SUBJECT-
NAME. This suggests there is less inclined to scram-
bling when both are verbal nouns. SUBJECT-NAME
is a significant predictor that correlates negatively
with scrambling, showing a strong relation between
animate entities and subjects in the canonical posi-
tion. However, the absence of a positive correlation
of OBJECT-NAME indicates the animacy effect is
not replicated.

The significant positive correlation of OBJECT-
FORMAL suggests that speakers might prefer to
place the clausal complement earlier in the sen-
tence. Table 2 shows a higher proportion of scram-
bling with OBJECT-FORMAL (28 out of 55). Of
these 28 scrambled cases, 26 include the clausal
objects (71%), whereas 14 of 27 canonical cases
include them (51%).

5 Discussion

We tested multiple factors said to affect scrambling
using the naturally distributed data. Although the
analysis did not support syntactic priming, given-
new ordering, and the animacy effect, we replicated
the length effect and established the influence of
noun types. These findings only show evidence for
sentence-internal factors, but we found no evidence
for discourse level factors.

The absence of discourse level effects may be
due to the small sample size of scrambled sentences
and the low rate of priming in a preceding discourse.
It will be important to replicate our results on more
extensive data to confirm our observed effects. To
scale up the analysis, we will collect a large num-
ber of sentences from the web and extract those
that are reliably parsed using the method suggested
in Sasano and Okumura (2016). The lack of given-
new ordering effect is presumably due to our naive
procedure for estimating coreferences. For bet-
ter estimation, future work will involve heuristics
known to be robust in Japanese anaphora resolution
tasks.

The effect of formal noun implies Japanese
speakers’ preference for putting the clausal com-
plement earlier (Yamashita and Chang, 2001). The
influence of noun type poses a question about what
accounts for this richer content earlier preference.
Future work will explore the potential causes that
determine “richness” of the noun phrase.
