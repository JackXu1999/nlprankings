Abstract

We report experiments with multi-modal
neural machine translation models that in-
corporate global visual features in differ-
ent parts of the encoder and decoder, and
use the VGG19 network to extract fea-
tures for all images. In our experiments,
we explore both different strategies to in-
clude global image features and also how
ensembling different models at inference
time impact translations. Our submissions
ranked 3rd best for translating from En-
glish into French, always improving con-
siderably over an neural machine transla-
tion baseline across all language pair eval-
uated, e.g. an increase of 7.0–9.2 ME-
TEOR points.

1 Introduction

In this paper we report on our application of three
different multi-modal neural machine translation
(NMT) systems to translate image descriptions.
We use encoder–decoder attentive multi-modal
NMT models where each training example con-
sists of one source variable-length sequence, one
image, and one target variable-length sequence,
and a model is trained to translate sequences in
the source language into corresponding sequences
in the target language while taking the image into
consideration. We use the three models introduced
in Calixto et al. (2017b), which integrate global
image features extracted using a pre-trained con-
volutional neural network into NMT (i) as words
in the source sentence, (ii) to initialise the encoder
hidden state, and (iii) as additional data to initialise
the decoder hidden state.

We are inspired by the recent success of multi-
modal NMT models applied to the translation of
image descriptions (Huang et al., 2016; Calixto

et al., 2017a). Huang et al. (2016) incorporate
global visual features into NMT with some suc-
cess, and Calixto et al. (2017a) propose to use lo-
cal visual features instead, achieving better results.
We follow Calixto et al. (2017b) and investigate
whether we can achieve better results while still
using global visual features, which are consider-
ably smaller and simpler to integrate when com-
pared to local features.

We expect that, by integrating visual informa-
tion when translating image descriptions, we are
able to exploit valuable information from both
modalities when generating the target description,
effectively grounding machine translation (Glen-
berg and Robertson, 2000).

2 Model Description

The models used in our experiments can be viewed
as expansions of the attentive NMT framework in-
troduced by Bahdanau et al. (2015) with the addi-
tion of a visual component that incorporates visual
features from images. A bi-directional recurrent
neural network (RNN) with gated recurrent unit
(GRU) (Cho et al., 2014) is used as the encoder.
The final annotation vector for a given source po-
sition i is the concatenation of forward and back-
ward RNN hidden states, hi =

[−→
hi;
←−
hi
]
.

We use the publicly available pre-trained con-
volution neural network VGG191 of Simonyan
and Zisserman (2014) to extract global image fea-
ture vectors for all images. These features are
the 4096D activations of the penultimate fully-
connected layer FC7, henceforth referred to as q.

We now describe the three multi-modal NMT
models used in our experiments. For a detailed
explanation about these models, see Calixto et al.
(2017b).

2.1 IMG2W: Image as source words
In model IMG2W, the image features are used
as the first and last words of the source sen-
tence, and the source-language attention model
learns when to attend to the image representations.
Specifically, given the global image feature vector
q ∈ R4096:

d = W 2I · (W 1I · q + b1I) + b2I , (1)

where W 1I ∈ R4096×4096 and W 2I ∈ R4096×dx are
image transformation matrices, b1I ∈ R4096 and
b2I ∈ Rdx are bias vectors, and dx is the source
words vector space dimensionality, all trained with
the model.

We directly use d as the first and last
words of the source sentence. In other words,
given the word embeddings for a source sen-
tence X = (x1,x2, · · · ,xN ), we concate-
nate the transformed image vector d to it, i.e.
X = (d,x1,x2, · · · ,xN ,d), and apply the for-
ward and backward encoder RNN. By including
images into the encoder in model IMG2W, our in-
tuition is that (i) by including the image as the first
word, we propagate image features into the source
sentence vector representations when applying the
forward RNN to produce vectors

−→
hi, and (ii) by in-

cluding the image as the last word, we propagate
image features into the source sentence vector rep-
resentations when applying the backward RNN to
produce vectors

←−
hi.

2.2 IMGE: Image for encoder initialisation
In the original attention-based NMT model of
Bahdanau et al. (2015), the hidden state of the en-
coder is initialised with the zero vector

#»
0 . In-

stead, we propose to use two new single-layer
feed-forward neural networks to compute the ini-
tial states of the forward and the backward RNN,
respectively.

Similarly to what we do for model IMG2W de-
scribed in Section 2.1, given a global image fea-
ture vector q ∈ R4096, we compute a vector d
using Equation (1), only this time the parameters
W 2I and b

2
I project the image features into the

same dimensionality as the hidden states of the
source language encoder.

The feed-forward networks used to initialise the
encoder hidden state are computed as in (2):

←−
h init = tanh

(
Wfd+ bf

)
,

−→
h init = tanh

(
Wbd+ bb

)
, (2)

where Wf and Wb are multi-modal projection
matrices that project the image features d into the
encoder forward and backward hidden states di-
mensionality, respectively, and bf and bb are bias
vectors.

−→
h init and

←−
h init are directly used as the

forward and backward RNN initial hidden states,
respectively.

2.3 IMGD: Image for decoder initialisation

To incorporate an image into the decoder, we in-
troduce a new single-layer feed-forward neural
network. Originally, the decoder initial hidden
state is computed using a summary of the encoder
hidden states. This is often the concatenation of
the last hidden states of the encoder forward RNN
and backward RNN, respectively

−→
hN and

←−
h 1, or

the mean of the source-language annotation vec-
tors hi.

We propose to include the image features as
additional input to initialise the decoder’s hidden
state, as described in (3):

s0 = tanh
(
Wdi[

←−
h 1;
−→
hN ] +Wmd+ bdi

)
, (3)

where s0 is the decoder initial hidden state, Wm
is a multi-modal projection matrix that projects the
image features d into the decoder hidden state di-
mensionality and Wdi and bdi are learned model
parameters.

Once again we compute d by applying Equation
(1) onto a global image feature vector q ∈ R4096,
only this time the parameters W 2I and b

2
I project

the image features into the same dimensionality as
the decoder hidden states.

3 Experiments

We report results for Task 1, specifically when
translating from English into German (en–de) and
French (en–fr). We conducted experiments on
the constrained version of the shared task, which
means that the only training data we used is the
data released by the shared task organisers, i.e.
the translated Multi30k (M30kT) data set (Elliott
et al., 2016) with the additional French image de-
scriptions, included for the 2017 run of the shared
task.

Our encoder is a bi-directional RNN with GRU,
one 1024D single-layer forward RNN and one
1024D single-layer backward RNN. Throughout,
we parameterise our models using 620D source
and target word embeddings, and both are trained

441



jointly with our model. All non-recurrent matri-
ces are initialised by sampling from a Gaussian
distribution (µ = 0, σ = 0.01), recurrent matri-
ces are random orthogonal and bias vectors are
all initialised to

#»
0 . We apply dropout (Srivastava

et al., 2014) with a probability of 0.3 in source
and target word embeddings, in the image fea-
tures, in the encoder and decoder RNNs inputs and
recurrent connections, and before the readout op-
eration in the decoder RNN. We follow Gal and
Ghahramani (2016) and apply dropout to the en-
coder bidirectional RNN and decoder RNN using
the same mask in all time steps.

The translated Multi30k training and validation
sets contain 29k and 1014 images respectively,
each accompanied by a sentence triple, the orig-
inal English sentence and its gold-standard trans-
lations into German and into French.

We use the scripts in the Moses SMT Toolkit
(Koehn et al., 2007) to normalise, lowercase and
tokenize English, German and French descriptions
and we also convert space-separated tokens into
subwords (Sennrich et al., 2016). The subword
models are trained jointly for English–German de-
scriptions and separately for English–French de-
scriptions using the English-German and English-
French WMT 2015 data (Bojar et al., 2015).
English–German models have a final vocabulary
of 74K English and 81K German subword tokens,
and English–French models 82K English and 82K
French subword tokens. If sentences in English,
German or French are longer than 80 tokens, they
are discarded.

Finally, we use the 29K entries in the M30kT
training set for training our models, and the
1, 014 entries in the M30kT development set for
model selection, early stopping the training pro-
cedure in case the model stops improving BLEU
scores on this development set. We evaluate our
English–German models on three held-out test
sets, the Multi30k 2016/2017 and the MSCOCO
2017 test sets, and our English–French models on
the Multi30k 2017 and the MSCOCO 2017 test
sets.

We evaluate translation quality quantitatively in
terms of BLEU4 (Papineni et al., 2002), METEOR
(Denkowski and Lavie, 2014), and TER (Snover
et al., 2006).

3.1 Results

In Table 1, we show results when translating the
Multi30k 2017 test sets. Models are trained on
the original M30kT training data only. The NMT
baseline is the attention-based NMT model of
Bahdanau et al. (2015) and its results are the ones
reported by the shared task organisers. When com-
pared to other submissions of the multi-modal MT
task under the constrained data regime, our mod-
els ranked sixth best when translating the English–
German Multi30k 2017, and fourth best when
translating the English–German MSCOCO 2017
test sets. When translating both the Multi30k 2017
and the MSCOCO 2017 English–French test sets,
our models are ranked third best, scoring only 1–2
points (BLEU, METEOR) less than the best sys-
tem.

In Table 2, we show results when translating the
MSCOCO 2017 English–German and English–
French test sets. Again, all models are trained
on the original M30kT training data only. When
compared to other submissions of the multi-modal
MT task under the constrained data regime, our
submission ranked fourth best for the English–
German and third best for the English–French lan-

guage pair, scoring only 1 to 1.5 points less than
the best system. These are promising results, spe-
cially taking into consideration that we are us-
ing global image features, which are smaller and
simpler than local features (used in Calixto et al.
(2017a)).

Ensemble decoding We now report on how can
ensemble decoding be used to improve multi-
modal MT. In Table 3, we show results when trans-
lating the Multi30k 2016’s test set. We ensem-
bled different models by starting with one of Cal-
ixto et al. (2017b)’s best performing multi-modal
models on this data set, IMGD, and by adding new
models to the ensemble one by one, until we reach
a maximum of four independent models, all of
which are trained separately and on the original
M30kT training data only. We also report results
for the best model of Calixto et al. (2017a), which
is pre-trained on the English–German WMT 2015
(Bojar et al., 2015) and uses local visual features
extracted with the ResNet-50 network (He et al.,
2015).

We first note that adding more models to the
ensemble seems to always improve translations
by a large margin (∼ 3 BLEU/METEOR points).
Adding model IMG2W to the ensemble already
consisting of models IMGE and IMGD still im-
proves translations, according to all metrics evalu-
ated. This is an interesting result, since compared
to these other two multi-modal models, model
IMG2W performs the worst according to BLEU,
METEOR and chrF3 (see Calixto et al. (2017b)).
Our best results are obtained with an ensemble of
four different multi-modal models.

By using an ensemble of four different multi-
modal NMT models trained on the translated

Multi30k training data, we were able to obtain
translations comparable to or even better than
those obtained with the strong multi-modal NMT
model of Calixto et al. (2017a), which is pre-
trained on large amounts of WMT data and uses
local image features.

4 Conclusions and Future work

In this work, we evaluated multi-modal NMT
models which integrate global image features into
both the encoder and the decoder. We exper-
imented with ensembling different multi-modal
NMT models introduced in Calixto et al. (2017b),
and results show that these models can gener-
ate translations that compare favourably to multi-
modal models that use local image features. We
observe consistent improvements over a text-only
NMT baseline trained on the same data, and these
are typically very large (e.g., 7.0–9.2 METEOR
points across language pairs and test sets). In fu-
ture work we plan to study how to generalise these
models to other multi-modal natural language pro-
cessing tasks, e.g. visual question answering.
