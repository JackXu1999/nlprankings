Abstract

Choosing an appropriate way for a spoken
dialog system to initiate a conversation is
a challenging problem, and, if done incor-
rectly, can negatively affect people’s per-
formance on other important tasks. We
describe the results of a study in which
participants play a game and are inter-
rupted by spoken notifications in differ-
ent styles. We compare people’s percep-
tions of the notification styles, as well as
their effect on task performance. The dif-
ferent notifications include manipulations
of pre-notifications and information about
the urgency of the task. We find that pre-
notifications help people respond signifi-
cantly faster to urgent tasks, and that 43%
of people, more than in any other category,
prefer a notification style in which the no-
tification begins by stating the urgency of
the task.

1 Introduction

As spoken dialog systems have improved, they
have become an increasingly prominent part of our
everyday lives. It is now common to interact with
systems that not only perform a single, task-based
function (e.g. booking an airplane flight (Bohus
and Rudnicky, 2009)), but rather act as personi-
fied assistants across a range of domains, includ-
ing answering questions, managing communica-
tion, and organizing schedules, as Apple Siri and
Microsoft Cortana do. In particular, some dialog
systems have taken up residence in our homes, act-
ing as personal assistants, like Amazon Echo, or
as the embodiment of a network of smart home
devices (Oulasvirta et al., 2007). Most research
has assumed that these systems are entirely user-
initiated—that the system will always be respond-

ing to questions and requests from a person, rather
than making its own. However, as these interac-
tions become more natural and human-like, there
are many situations in which the system will also
have reason to initiate the dialog: for example, to
notify someone about a time-sensitive event like
taking medicine, or to start a conversation about
planning dinner. In this paper we study how dif-
ferent wordings of initiations can change people’s
perceptions of the notifications and make it eas-
ier for them to manage interruptions. We find
that pre-notifications and additional explicit infor-
mation about urgency improve interruption man-
agement and are preferred by users. However,
we also find that there is a large range of user
preferences, and in particular people with greater
working memory capacity have distinctly different
preferences.

Allowing a system to begin a conversation
raises questions about how the dialog can and
should be initiated. Ideally, the system should be
aware of the context of the users: where they are
physically located, and what activities or interac-
tions they are already engaged in. If it is acting
as a single voice for multiple devices within the
home, those devices may have competing goals,
and it must decide which takes priority. Addition-
ally, different people may have different prefer-
ences for how they want to interact with the sys-
tem, including frequency, wording, and modality
of interruptions, which the system should be able
to accommodate. It is important that the system
should not only be technically functional, but also
be enjoyable to use. By taking these competing
factors into consideration, it will provide a better
user experience.

The factors mentioned above create a large
and complex set of choices and possibilities.
For the purposes of this paper we studied two
variables—pre-notifications and urgency—that

148



provide the potential to make very simple changes
to a system which nonetheless have a large im-
pact on people’s preferences for and perception of
notifications. As a language-based technology, a
dialog system is uniquely situated to use linguis-
tic strategies to accommodate different users and
situations, so we focused specifically on changing
the wording of the notifications to give increased
amounts of warning and information at the cost of
simplicity and directness.

The first variable we looked at was pre-
notification. This was inspired by considering
how people initiate conversations with each other.
Schegloff (1968) introduces the idea that any two-
person conversation typically begins with a “sum-
mons,” which serves to propose the start of a con-
versation. The “summons” is followed by an “an-
swer” from the other person, acknowledging par-
ticipation in the conversation. Our first hypothe-
sis is that by having the dialog system begin with
a summons-style pre-notification it will feel more
natural, so participants will find the interruption
less annoying, and it will disrupt their task perfor-
mance less.

Next, we consider how the urgency of a task af-
fects performance and preference. A number of
studies have found that people are more recep-
tive to being interrupted if the notification is ur-
gent (Vastenburg et al., 2008; Paul et al., 2011;
Paul et al., 2015). Our second hypothesis is that
participants will benefit even more from the pre-
notification if it is not a generic phrase, but rather
indicates the urgency of the task itself. This will
allow participants to prepare themselves to com-
plete the task as quickly as possible when neces-
sary, but let them know that they can take their
time when appropriate.

2 Related Work

There have been studies on the effects of word-
ing in dialog systems and on different ways of
providing notifications, but none of these studies
have combined them to examine how linguistic
style choices in a dialog system interact with and
change people’s perceptions of notifications.

Looking at the effects of wording in a spoken
dialog system, Torrey et al. (2013) studied a sys-
tem that helped people make cupcakes and found
that using hedges and discourse markers made the
system seem less commanding and more friendly.
However, they focused on an in-progress dialog,

rather than initiations and interruptions.

Interruptions, taking the form of notifications,
have both benefits and risks. They can be ex-
tremely useful when reminding people of impor-
tant tasks or appointments, and are particularly
beneficial to people dealing with memory prob-
lems (McGee-Lennon et al., 2011). However, the
danger of interruptions is that they decrease per-
formance on the user’s primary task by disrupting
concentration, and, depending on the perceived
worth of the notification, may also annoy or frus-
trate the user. Warnock et al. (2011) and Paul et
al. (2015) find that all notifications cause errors
in the task that is being interrupted. The ability to
focus on a task and remember items despite in-
terruptions is associated with the cognitive load
of the task, which determines how much mem-
ory it requires; the working memory of the person,
which measures how many items they can remem-
ber at once; and executive attention, which reg-
ulates which items they focus on (Engle, 2002).
Because working memory is essential to interrup-
tion management, in this study we compare per-
formance and perceptions across participants with
different working memory capacities.

One way to address the problem of notifica-
tion interruptions is by detecting natural breaking
points, and interrupting during them (Hudson et
al., 2003; Fogarty et al., 2005; Okoshi et al., 2015).
However, this is a challenging task that relies on
full knowledge or detection of the user’s activities,
and that may also raise privacy concerns. Chang-
ing only the delivery of the alert to make it less
disruptive has a much lower barrier to entry and
can be applied to a wide range of systems being
designed to interact with users through dialog.

Certain types of notifications are less disruptive
than others. McGee-Lennon et al. (2007) com-
pare beeps, musical patterns, and speech-based
notifications, finding that people perform slightly
better with speech notifications, and that differ-
ent people prefer different modalities of notifica-
tion. Warnock et al. (2011) go further, also look-
ing at notifications based on text, pictures, colors,
iconic sounds, touch, and smell, where different
variations must be associated with different tasks.
However, although both the studies have speech as
a notification option, they use only a single phrase
type and do not consider the effect that different
styles of speech may have on either performance
or preference.

base The bathtub is overflowing. The bathtub is dirty.
pre Excuse me...the bathtub is overflowing. Excuse me...the bathtub is dirty.
verbose Urgent task...the bathtub is overflowing. Whenever is convenient...the bathtub is dirty.

Table 1: Example notifications in each style and urgency level

A method of mitigating the negative effects of
notifications is to first send a “pre-alert,” as de-
scribed by Andrews et al. (2009). They find that
a pre-alert increases the speed with which the pri-
mary task is resumed after the interruption, and
negates its disruptive effect. However, the types of
alerts they compared were all non-linguistic, being
either visual or consisting of a single tone.

Research has shown the benefits of pre-
notifications, the relevance of urgency, the util-
ity of language-based notifications, and the impor-
tance of wording choice to perceptions of a dia-
log system. These are all closely related concepts;
however, unlike previous work, we incorporate all
of them into a set of notifications which can be
tested for their effect on users.

3 Experiment

As discussed above, there are many factors that
can influence the perception and effect of notifica-
tions. To look at a well-defined space, we chose
to study three factors: the urgency of the task, the
presence of a pre-notification, and the prominence
of urgency level in the notification. Participants
played a browser-based game that involved going
back and forth between primary and secondary
tasks based on spoken notifications. By framing
the activity as a game and giving players points
for both types of tasks, players were encouraged
to balance doing well in the game with responding
to notifications. This models the real-world sit-
uation of balancing multiple tasks, some of which
are prompted by a dialog system. The primary task
took the form of a game of Snake, shown in Figure
1, and described in more detail in Section 3.2.2.
In the secondary task, participants were periodi-
cally notified to go complete “household tasks.”
For example, in one task participants are told that
the “toast is burning,” and they must go click on
the toast in the kitchen shown in Figure 2. Each
participant went through three rounds with a dif-
ferent combination of variables in each round, so
that we were able to both measure performance
differences and get feedback on participants’ per-
ceptions of the different notifications. Examples
of different notification types, described in more
detail below, are displayed in Table 1.

3.1 Participants

The participants in the experiment were recruited
using the Amazon Mechanical Turk crowdsourc-
ing pool. We required participants to be located
in an English-speaking country (US, Australia,
Canada, Great Britain, or New Zealand), and to
have a 95% or higher HIT approval rate. Addi-
tionally, participants had to sign a consent form
stating they were at least 18 years old.

We conducted 206 sessions. Of those, we dis-
carded the data of 31 because of issues includ-
ing bugs in the game, people repeating the study,
and people making no effort to play the game or

150



complete tasks. We sampled the remaining data
to create a data set balanced between the 18 con-
ditions described in Section 3.2.5, leaving a total
of 144 participants in the study. Of these partic-
ipants, 57.64% were male, and 41.67% were fe-
male. Their ages ranged from 20-69, with a mean
of 34.31.

3.2 Procedure

The study procedure consisted of the following
steps:

1. Forward digit span task
2. Primary task tutorial
3. Snake baseline session
4. Secondary task tutorial
5. Experimental manipulation (3 rounds)

3.2.1 Forward Digit Span task
Participants started by completing the Forward
Digit Span task (Hunt et al., 1973), which we used
as a metric for working memory, and is associated
with attention. Working memory is closely related
to people’s ability to deal with interruptions, lead-
ing us to hypothesize that it would help distinguish
different user groups with regard to their ability to
manage interruptions. In the test, digits were pre-
sented visually to the participant at one-second in-
tervals. Each digit was visible for half a second
and was followed by a pause of another half sec-
ond before the next digit was displayed. At the
end of each sequence, the participants entered the
sequence, as they remembered it, into a text box.
Participants were presented with two different se-
quences of equal length, beginning with length 3.
If they got at least one of the two correct, the se-
quence length was increased by one. When they
got both wrong, the task ended and the longest
length at which they got at least one of the two cor-
rect was considered the participant’s “digit span
score.” The participants’ scores had a mean of 7.37
and a standard deviation of 1.83.

3.2.2 Primary task tutorial
Following the digit span task, participants were
given a brief tutorial on the primary task. This
involved playing the computer game Snake, in
which a player maneuvers a “snake” graphic
around a box, trying to make it hit, or “eat,” cir-
cles, without hitting the sides or itself. With each
circle the snake eats, the player gets points equal to
the length of the snake, and the snake gets longer,
thus giving a greater reward to the more difficult

situation of having a longer snake. Participants
got a one-minute tutorial, presented by the same
voice as used in the notifications, to familiarize
them both with the game controls and the notifi-
cation voice.

3.2.3 Snake baseline session
Participants played the game uninterrupted for one
minute to get a baseline measurement of their skill
at the game.

3.2.4 Secondary task tutorial
Next, participants were given a tutorial in the sec-
ondary task. Each task requires that the partici-
pants navigate to a different “room” in the house
by clicking on a labeled door icon. This leads
them to a different screen (e.g. the kitchen shown
in Figure 2), where they must click on an item
in the room, such as the television or the stove.
Some tasks are urgent (they must be accomplished
within 10 seconds), while others can be completed
at any time during the game. Completing each of
these tasks gives the participants 20 game points,
incentivizing them to complete the task despite its
potential disruption to the game.

3.2.5 Experimental manipulation
Each of the three rounds consisted of the partic-
ipant playing Snake for 2 minutes, and being in-
terrupted twice at 30 second intervals with notifi-
cations for secondary tasks. This simulated a per-
son engaged in some activity in their home (rep-
resented by Snake) who is then interrupted by a
spoken dialog notification system. To test our hy-
potheses that pre-notifications and additional ur-
gency information would both be beneficial, in
each round participants were given one of the three
notification styles listed in Table 1.

The experiment comprises three independent
variables. The first is notification style, with 3
different values, as discussed above. Second is
urgency level, with two different values: urgent
and non-urgent. Finally, room/task has three val-
ues: bedroom, bathroom, and kitchen. To control
for the effects of different orders and combina-
tions of variables, we conducted a 3 (notification
style)⇥ 3 (room/tasks)⇥ 2 (urgency level) manip-
ulation, with notification style and room/tasks as
within-subject factors, and urgency as a between-
subject (per-task) factor. In particular, we counter-
balanced notification style and room/tasks using a
3⇥ 3 Latin Square, where each cell contained two

151



tasks in the same room, delivered with the same
notification style, creating 3 separate conditions.
Each participant experienced both urgency lev-
els. However, we maintained a consistent urgency
level within each room for each participant. We
accomplished this by constructing all six possible
sequences of three assignments of urgency level
such that both urgency levels were in the sequence
at least once. We then crossed the three conditions
from the Latin Square with the six possible order-
ings of the between-subject factor. Thus, in total,
there were 18 experimental settings.

The six types of notifications were designed to
operationalize the variables of pre-notification, ur-
gency level, and urgency information. In the first,
base, the participant is given just the content of the
notification (e.g. “The toast is burning”). In the
second, pre, the participant is given a simple pre-
notification (“Excuse me”) followed by a pause,
and then the content of the notification. In both the
first and second conditions, the participant must
determine based on the content of the notification
whether it is urgent or not. In the third condition,
verbose , the participant is given a pre-notification
specifying the urgency of the notification (either
“Urgent task” or “Whenever is convenient”), fol-
lowed by a pause, and then the content of the no-
tification. Each task object has an urgent and non-
urgent version. These variations are represented
in Table 1. To help participants identify separate
notification types, each round was associated with
a different room, including two unique tasks. This
room/task pair was an additional manipulated vari-
able.

3.3 Outcomes

In order to compare the notification types, for each
notification type we measured how well the partic-
ipant did in the primary task interrupted by those
notifications, the number of secondary tasks com-
pleted, and the amount of time it took to complete
tasks. In addition, we measured baseline perfor-
mance on the primary task as a metric of individ-
ual skill.

In addition to quantitative measures, at the end
of the study we also asked participants about their
preferences. After participants completed the task,
they were asked to identify the room associated
with the notifications they liked the most, and the
one associated with the notifications they liked the
least. They were also instructed to give more de-

tailed feedback about their preferences.

4 Results

In this section, we compare the outcomes of the
study to our two hypotheses: first, that participants
would perform better and prefer a system that be-
gins with a pre-notification, and second, that par-
ticipants would benefit even more from the pre-
notification if it indicates the urgency of the task.
To evaluate these interactions, we look first at per-
formance on the primary task, second at perfor-
mance on the secondary task, and finally at stated
preference for different notification styles.

To answer the question of whether different
types of notifications effect primary task perfor-
mance, we analyzed the game score and number
of game deaths, shown in Table 2. The gameplay
was highly variable between individuals, so we
compared game scores (Mean: 166.04, Standard
deviation: 166.35) and number of game deaths
(Mean: 7.16, Standard deviation: 5.31) using a
repeated measures ANOVA across different noti-
fication styles. We also ranked each individual’s
rounds from one to three, and performed a chi-
square test between notification style and rank.
However, the only significant indicator of per-
formance was the order of the rounds, with per-
formance improving as people played more (F(1,
143) = 23.80, p<.001).

To answer the question of whether different
types of notifications effect secondary task man-
agement, we analyzed the amount of time it took
to complete tasks (Mean: 7547ms, Standard de-
viation: 7006ms) in different conditions, shown
in Table 3. We found that whether the task was
urgent or not has a significant effect on the com-
pletion time, validating our urgency manipula-
tion (F(1,422)=96.39, p<.0001). For non-urgent
tasks, the notification style did not appear to
have an effect on completion time, but for urgent
tasks it was highly significant (F(2,208)=16.57,
p<.0001). A Tukey post-hoc test reveals that per-
formance in pre and verbose, both of which have
a pre-notification aspect to them, is virtually iden-
tical, but base is significantly slower. This shows
that the presence of a pre-notification, regardless
of the type, helps users manage interruptions to
complete urgent tasks faster.

To answer the question of what effect differ-
ent notification styles had on participants’ percep-
tion of and preference for notifications, we per-

formed a series of chi-square tests comparing dif-
ferent manipulations with the number of people
who rated each best, worst, or not at all, as shown
in Table 4, Here, the notification style was sig-
nificant (�2(4, N=432)=14.61, p<.01), with the
breakdown shown in Figure 3. A plurality of peo-
ple liked verbose the most, with base and pre rated
about the same. In looking at potential causes of
variation, we also examined interactions between
different components of the manipulation: the ur-
gency of the task, the room containing the objects
people clicked on in the task, and the order it was
presented. Participants rated non-urgent tasks bet-
ter, and also those in the bedroom worse (an un-
intentional effect of varying the tasks for differ-
ent rounds was that the bedroom tasks were more
difficult than others), but overall there were no
significant interactions between these factors and
notification style, displaying a stable main effect.
The pre-notification and added urgency informa-

Figure 4: Preferences by Notification Style and
Digit Span

tion were considered preferable across conditions.
These results show that having a pre-

notification did not help participants on their
main task, but it did help them complete ur-
gent tasks more quickly, which is desirable.
Adding urgency-related information to the pre-
notification, as in the verbose style, did not affect
task performance, but was a clear favorite across
all different conditions.

Nonetheless, not all people liked the verbose
style most, which raises the question of what fac-
tors determine a person’s preferences. For the pur-
pose of this study, we also looked at how three
personal characteristics interact with notification
preferences, shown in Table 5. Age and gender
did not show a significant pattern, but digit span
did. As depicted in Figure 4, across all groups
there was a preference for the verbose style, except
among people with the highest digit span scores.

This group instead disliked verbose the most, and
showed a slight preference for the pre style (�2

(12, N=432)=28.88, p<.005). As such, we can
distinguish them as a distinct user group, with
a different focus and different priorities. Given
the difference in their preferences on notification
style, we attempt to identify other factors that dis-
tinguish them as a group. However, we compared
them to the rest of the participants using age, gen-
der, baseline score, number of game deaths, and
all the different round manipulation preferences,
and they are not significantly different in any way.

To gain insight into user preferences, in addi-
tion to ranking their preferences, participants pro-
vided written comments about their favorite and
least favorite rounds. We examined these to bet-
ter understand what components of the round in-
fluenced their choice, and what they liked and dis-
liked about the notifications themselves. The com-
ments reflect what we see in the preference trends.
Of the 270 comments, 23% focus only on the no-
tification itself, while 35% focus only on the con-
tent and visual appearance of the rooms, 23% fo-
cus only on the urgency of the task, and 19% fo-
cus on other aspects of the system. When we
include comments that mention multiple compo-
nents of the study, 30% talk about the notifica-
tion itself, while 37% talk about the room, and
30% talk about urgency. This includes a large
amount of overlap, especially between notification
and urgency, which are closely associated with
each other.

Even though only 30% of people specifically
mentioned the notification, of that 30%, the break-
down of urgencies and rooms they preferred mir-
rored that of the participants as a whole, suggest-
ing that despite what people mentioned in their

comments, everyone was motivated by similar fac-
tors. People who commented on notification style
were most likely to say they liked base because
it was simple and straightforward, but often com-
plained that it didn’t give them a pre-notification.
For pre, some people said they liked it because
it was polite, but even more people complained
that the “excuse me” was “creepy”, “annoying”,
or “unnecessary”. Finally, for verbose, many peo-
ple commented that it helped them to distinguish
between different urgencies, but the most common
complaint was the tone or wording of the message.

5 Discussion

Our hypothesis that pre-notifications would help
people’s performance was supported, but only in
one condition, that of the urgent secondary task.
This suggests that having a pre-notification does
not help people manage interruptions to a primary
task. However, it might be the case that the pri-
mary task, playing Snake, was ultimately not ideal
for this evaluation because interruptions in general
did not have as much of a negative impact on peo-
ple’s performance as we originally thought. Al-
though participants were given a practice round,
if they had a full round without any notifications
at all, it would been easier for us to directly mea-
sure the performance effect of notifications, rather
than just comparing different styles. Additionally,
the best predictor of an individual’s performance
on any given round was the order of the round; in
other words, people improved significantly at the
game over the course of the study. Had game per-
formance remained approximately the same over
time, we might have seen a stronger effect of noti-
fication style.

Looking at preferences, we find that people who

154



scored higher on a test of working memory, as
measured by digit span score, generally view the
verbose style less favorably. The question re-
mains, however, of what other factors determine
people’s preferences. For the purposes of this
study we only looked at a few personal qualities,
most of which were not good predictors of prefer-
ence. If we gain more insight into people’s traits,
for example through additional demographics and
basic personality questions, we may find other fac-
tors that affect their preferences.

The most interesting part of the extended feed-
back was that people frequently commented on the
tone of the notification, either praising it for being
“calm” and “friendly,” or criticizing it for being
“demanding” and “creepy.” Additionally, we often
assume that politeness is a positive, but in one case
someone complained that the verbose notification
was “too kind.” We focused on the information
contained in the notification, but subtle changes to
wording or inflection can result in big changes in
how language is perceived.

One shortcoming of this study was that it looked
at people interacting with a system over a very
short period of time. People’s impressions of no-
tifications may change over time as they become
accustomed to the system. As they become used
to being interrupted, the notifications may be less
startling, but as people learn to predict what the
system will say, they may value concise phrasing
over added information. Our study lays a ground-
work for what aspects of interruption people care
about, but before making conclusions for use in a
real-world system, it would be important to look
at how people adjust and settle into patterns.

6 Conclusion

In general, the verbose style was both most pre-
ferred and best for people’s performance. This
suggests that people prefer a pre-notification be-
fore hearing the task, which enables them to know
the urgency of the task and thus the type of reac-
tions expected, and to prepare for the task. How-
ever, it’s also important to note that many people
did not like verbose the most, and even thought it
was the worst. In particular, the difference in pref-
erence based on digit span score reveals that dif-
ferent types of people may have significantly dif-
ferent opinions. As we consider the design of spo-
ken dialog systems, we should consider not only
whether pre-notifications and urgency information

can make interruptions more helpful and palat-
able, but also how we can accommodate a range
of users. The conclusion we draw, then, is not that
systems should contain urgency pre-notifications,
but rather that they should have flexibility for dif-
ferent people to experiment with a range of initi-
ation styles to choose the one they personally like
the best.
