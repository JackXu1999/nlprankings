Abstract

Understanding a narrative requires reading
between the lines and reasoning about the
unspoken but obvious implications about
events and people’s mental states — a ca-
pability that is trivial for humans but re-
markably hard for machines. To facilitate
research addressing this challenge, we in-
troduce a new annotation framework to ex-
plain naive psychology of story characters
as fully-specified chains of mental states
with respect to motivations and emotional
reactions. Our work presents a new large-
scale dataset with rich low-level annota-
tions and establishes baseline performance
on several new tasks, suggesting avenues
for future research.

1 Introduction

Understanding a story requires reasoning about
the causal links between the events in the story
and the mental states of the characters, even when
those relationships are not explicitly stated. As
shown by the commonsense story cloze shared
task (Mostafazadeh et al., 2017), this reasoning is
remarkably hard for both statistical and neural ma-
chine readers – despite being trivial for humans.
This stark performance gap between humans and
machines is not surprising as most powerful lan-
guage models have been designed to effectively
learn local fluency patterns. Consequently, they
generally lack the ability to abstract away from
surface patterns in text to model more complex im-
plied dynamics, such as intuiting characters’ men-
tal states or predicting their plausible next actions.

In this paper, we construct a new annotation
formalism to densely label commonsense short
stories (Mostafazadeh et al., 2016) in terms of
the mental states of the characters. The result-

ing dataset offers three unique properties. First,
as highlighted in Figure 1, the dataset provides
a fully-specified chain of motivations and emo-
tional reactions for each story character as pre-
and post-conditions of events. Second, the annota-
tions include state changes for entities even when
they are not mentioned directly in a sentence (e.g.,
in the fourth sentence in Figure 1, players would
feel afraid as a result of the instructor throwing a
chair), thereby capturing implied effects unstated
in the story. Finally, the annotations encompass
both formal labels from multiple theories of psy-
chology (Maslow, 1943; Reiss, 2004; Plutchik,
1980) as well as open text descriptions of moti-
vations and emotions, providing a comprehensive
mapping between open text explanations and la-
bel categories (e.g., “to spend time with her son”

! Maslow’s category love). Our corpus1 spans
across 15k stories, amounting to 300k low-level
annotations for around 150k character-line pairs.

Using our new corpus, we present baseline per-
formance on two new tasks focusing on mental
state tracking of story characters: categorizing
motivations and emotional reactions using theory
labels, as well as describing motivations and emo-
tional reactions using open text. Empirical results
demonstrate that existing neural network models
including those with explicit or latent entity repre-
sentations achieve promising results.

2 Mental State Representations

Understanding people’s actions, motivations, and
emotions has been a recurring research focus
across several disciplines including philosophy
and psychology (Schachter and Singer, 1962;
Burke, 1969; Lazarus, 1991; Goldman, 2015). We
draw from these prior works to derive a set of
categorical labels for annotating the step-by-step
causal dynamics between the mental states of story
characters and the events they experience.

2.1 Motivation Theories
We use two popular theories of motivation: the
“hierarchy of needs” of Maslow (1943) and the
“basic motives” of Reiss (2004) to compile 5
coarse-grained and 19 fine-grained motivation cat-
egories, shown in Figure 2. Maslow’s “hierarchy
of needs” are comprised of five categories, rang-
ing from physiological needs to spiritual growth,
which we use as coarse-level categories. Reiss
(2004) proposes 19 more fine-grained categories
that provide a more informative range of motiva-
tions. For example, even though they both relate

1We make our dataset publicly available at https://
uwnlp.github.io/storycommonsense/

to the physiological needs Maslow category, the
food and rest motives from Reiss (2004) are very
different. While the Reiss theory allows for finer-
grained annotations of motivation, the larger set of
abstract concepts can be overwhelming for anno-
tators. Motivated by Straker (2013), we design a
hybrid approach, where Reiss labels are annotated
as sub-categories of Maslow categories.

2.2 Emotion Theory
Among several theories of emotion, we work with
the “wheel of emotions” of Plutchik (1980), as it
has been a common choice in prior literature on
emotion categorization (Mohammad and Turney,
2013; Zhou et al., 2016). We use the eight basic
emotional dimensions as illustrated in Figure 2.

2.3 Mental State Explanations
In addition to the motivation and emotion cate-
gories derived from psychology theories, we also
obtain open text descriptions of character mental
states. These open text descriptions allow learning
computational models that can explain the mental
states of characters in natural language, which is
likely to be more accessible and informative to end
users than having theory categories alone. Collect-
ing both theory categories and open text also al-
lows us to learn the automatic mappings between
the two, which generalizes the previous work of
Mohammad and Turney (2013) on emotion cate-
gory mappings.

3 Annotation Framework

In this study, we choose to annotate the simple
commonsense stories introduced by Mostafazadeh
et al. (2016). Despite their simplicity, these stories
pose a significant challenge to natural language
understanding models (Mostafazadeh et al., 2017).

In addition, they depict multiple interactions be-
tween story characters, presenting rich opportu-
nities to reason about character motivations and
reactions. Furthermore, there are more than 98k
such stories currently available covering a wide
range of everyday scenarios.

Unique Challenges While there have been a va-
riety of annotated resources developed on the re-
lated topics of sentiment analysis (Mohammad
and Turney, 2013; Deng and Wiebe, 2015), en-
tity tracking (Hoffart et al., 2011; Weston et al.,
2015), and story understanding (Goyal et al.,
2010; Ouyang and McKeown, 2015; Lukin et al.,
2016), our study is the first to annotate the full
chains of mental state effects for story charac-
ters. This poses several unique challenges as an-
notations require (1) interpreting discourse (2) un-
derstanding implicit causal effects, and (3) un-
derstanding formal psychology theory categories.
In prior literature, annotations of this complexity
have typically been performed by experts (Deng
and Wiebe, 2015; Ouyang and McKeown, 2015).
While reliable, these annotations are prohibitively
expensive to scale up. Therefore, we introduce a
new annotation framework that pipelines a set of
smaller isolated tasks as illustrated in Figure 3. All
annotations were collected using crowdsourced
workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk.

3.1 Annotation Pipeline
We describe the components and workflow of the
full annotation pipeline shown in Figure 3 below.
The example story in the figure is used to illustrate
the output of various steps in the pipeline (full an-
notations for this example are in the appendix).

(1) Entity Resolution The first task in the
pipeline aims to discover (1) the set of charac-
ters Ei in each story i and (2) the set of sentences
Sij in which a specific character j 2 Ei is ex-

plicitly mentioned. For example, in the story in
Figure 3, the characters identified by annotators
are “I/me” and “My cousin”, whom appear in sen-
tences {1, 4, 5} and {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, respectively.

We use Sij to control the workflow of later parts
of the pipeline by pruning future tasks for sen-
tences that are not tied to characters. Because Sij
is used to prune follow-up tasks, we take a high
recall strategy to include all sentences that at least
one annotator selected.

(2a) Action Resolution The next task identifies
whether a character j appearing in a sentence k
is taking any action to which a motivation can be
attributed. We perform action resolution only for
sentences k 2 Sij . In the running example, we
would want to know that the cousin in line 2 is
not doing anything intentional, allowing us to omit
this line in the next pipeline stage (3a) where a
character’s motives are annotated. Description of
state (e.g., “Alex is feeling blue”) or passive event
participation (e.g., “Alex trips”) are not considered
volitional acts for which the character may have an
underlying motive. For each line and story char-
acter pair, we obtain 4 annotations. Because pairs
can still be filtered out in the next stage of anno-
tation, we select a generous threshold where only
2 annotators must vote that an intentional action
took place for the sentence to be used as an input
to the motivation annotation task (3a).

(2b) Affect Resolution This task aims to iden-
tify all of the lines where a story character j has
an emotional reaction. Importantly, it is often pos-
sible to infer the emotional reaction of a character
j even when the character does not explicitly ap-
pear in a sentence k. For instance, in Figure 3, we
want to annotate the narrator’s reaction to line 2
even though they are not mentioned because their
emotional response is inferrable. We obtain 4 an-

notations per character per line. The lines with at
least 2 annotators voting are used as input for the
next task: (3b) emotional reaction.

(3a) Motivation We use the output from the ac-
tion resolution stage (2a) to ask workers to anno-
tate character motives in lines where they inten-
tionally initiate an event. We provide 3 annota-
tors a line from a story, the preceding lines, and
a specific character. They are asked to produce
a free response sentence describing what causes
the character’s behavior in that line and to select
the most related Maslow categories and Reiss sub-
categories. In Figure 3, an annotator described
the motivation of the narrator in line 1 as want-
ing “to have company” and then selected the love
(Maslow) and family (Reiss) as categorical labels.
Because many annotators are not familiar with
motivational theories, we require them to com-
plete a tutorial the first time they attempt the task.

(3b) Emotional Reaction Simultaneously, we
use the output from the affect resolution stage (2b)
to ask workers what the emotional response of a
character is immediately following a line in which
they are affected. As with the motives, we give 3
annotators a line from a story, its previous context,
and a specific character. We ask them to describe
in open text how the character will feel following
the event in the sentence (up to three emotions).
As a follow-up, we ask workers to compare their
free responses against Plutchik categories by using
3-point likert ratings. In Figure 3, we include a re-
sponse for the emotional reaction of the narrator
in line 1. Even though the narrator was not men-
tioned directly in that line, an annotator recorded
that they will react to their cousin being a slob by
feeling “annoyed” and selected the Plutchik cate-
gories for sadness, disgust and anger.

3.2 Dataset Statistics and Insights
Cost The tasks corresponding to the theory cate-
gory assignments are the hardest and most expen-
sive in the pipeline (⇠$4 per story). Therefore, we
obtain theory category labels only for a third of our
annotated stories, which we assign to the develop-
ment and test sets. The training data is annotated
with a shortened pipeline with only open text de-
scriptions of motivations and emotional reactions
from two workers (⇠$1 per story).

Scale Our dataset to date includes a total of 300k
low-level annotations for motivation and emotion
across 15,000 stories (randomly selected from the
ROC story training set). It covers over 150,000
character-line pairs, in which 56k character-line
pairs have an annotated motivation and 105k have
an annotated change in emotion (i.e. a label other
than none). Table 1 shows the break down across
training, development, and test splits. Figure 4
shows the frequency of different labels being se-
lected for motivational and emotional categories
in cases with positive change.

Agreements For quality control, we removed
workers who consistently produced low-quality
work, as discussed in the Appendix. In the cate-
gorization sets (Maslow, Reiss and Plutchik), we
compare the performance of annotators by treat-
ing each individual category as a binary label (1

associated’ ratings as agreeing with ‘highly’ asso-
ciated’ ratings. The percent agreement and Krip-
pendorff’s alpha are shown in Table 2. We also
compute the percent agreement between the indi-
vidual annotations and the majority labels.2

These scores are difficult to interpret by them-
selves, however, as annotator agreement in our
categorization system has a number of properties
that are not accounted for by these metrics (dis-

ping Reiss subcategories from Maslow categories,
skewed category distributions that inflate PPA and
deflate KA scores, and annotators that could select
multiple labels for the same examples).

To provide a clearer understanding of agree-
ment within this dataset, we create aggregated
confusion matrices for annotator pairs. First, we
sum the counts of combinations of answers be-
tween all paired annotations (excluding none la-
bels). If an annotator selected multiple categories,
we split the count uniformly among the selected
categories. We compute NPMI over the total con-
fusion matrix. In Figure 5, we show the NPMI
confusion matrix for motivational categories.

In the motivation annotations, we find the high-
est scores on the diagonal (i.e., Reiss agreement),
with most confusions occurring between Reiss
motives in the same Maslow category (outlined
black in Figure 5). Other disagreements generally
involve Reiss subcategories that are thematically
similar, such as serenity (mental relaxation) and
rest (physical relaxation). We provide this analy-
sis for Plutchik categories in the appendix, finding
high scores along the diagonal with disagreements
typically occurring between categories in a “pos-
itive emotion” cluster (joy, trust) or a “negative
emotion” cluster (anger, disgust,sadness).

4 Tasks

The multiple modes covered by the annotations in
this new dataset allow for multiple new tasks to
be explored. We outline three task types below,

Figure 6: General model architectures for three
new task types

Differences between task type inputs and outputs
are summarized in Figure 6.

State Classification The three primary tasks
involve categorizing the psychological states of
story characters for each of the label sets (Maslow,
Reiss, Plutchik) collected for the dev and test splits
of our dataset. In each classification task, a model
is given a line of the story (along with optional pre-
ceding context lines) and a character and predicts
the motivation (or emotional reaction). A binary
label is predicted for each of the Maslow needs,
Reiss motives or Plutchik categories.

Annotation Classification Because the dev and
test sets contain paired classification labels
and free text explanations, we propose three
tasks where a model must predict the correct
Maslow/Reiss/Plutchik label given an emotional
reaction or motivation explanation.

Explanation Generation Finally, we can use
the free text explanations to train models to de-
scribe the psychological state of a character in free
text (examples in Figure 4). These explanations
allow for two conditional generation tasks where
the model must generate the words describing the
emotional reaction or motivation of the character.

5 Baseline Models

The general model architectures for the three tasks
are shown in Figure 6. We describe each model
component below. The state classification and ex-
planation generation models could be trained sep-
arately or in a multi-task set-up.

In the state classification and explanation gen-
eration tasks, a model is given a line from a story

x

s containing N words {ws0, ws1, . . . , wsN} from
vocabulary V , a character in that story ej 2 E
where E is the set of characters in the story, and
(optionally) the preceding sentences in the story
C = {x0 . . . ,xs�1} containing words from vo-
cabulary V . A representation for a character’s psy-
chological state is encoded as:

h

e
= Encoder(x

s,C[ej ]) (1)

where C[ej ] corresponds to the concatenated sub-
set of sentences in C where ej appears.

5.1 Encoders
While the end classifier or decoder is different
for each task, we use the same set of encoders
based on word embeddings, common neural net-
work architectures, or memory networks to formu-
late a representation of the sentence and charac-
ter, he. Unless specified, he is computed by en-
coding separate vector representations for the sen-
tence (xs ! hs) and character-specific context
(C[ej ] ! hc) and concatenating these encodings
(he = [hc;hs]). We describe the encoders below:

TF-IDF We learn a TD-IDF model on the full
training corpus of Mostafazadeh et al. (2016) (ex-
cluding the stories in our dev/test sets). To encode
the sentence, we extract TF-IDF features for its
words, yielding vs 2 RV . A projection and non-
linearity is applied to these features to yield hs:

h

s
= �(Wsv

s
+ bs) (2)

where Ws 2 Rd⇥H . The character vector hc is en-
coded in the same way on sentences in the context
pertaining to the character.

GloVe We extract pretrained Glove vectors
(Pennington et al., 2014) for each word in V . The
word embeddings are max-pooled, yielding em-
bedding vs 2 RH , where H is the dimensionality
of the Glove vectors. Using this max-pooled rep-
resentation, hs and hc are extracted in the same
manner as for TF-IDF features (Equation 2).

CNN We implement a CNN text categorization
model using the same configuration as Kim (2014)
to encode the sentence words. A sentence is rep-
resented as a matrix, vs 2 RM⇥d where each row
is a word embedding xsn for a word wsn 2 xs.

vs = [xs0, x
s
1, . . . , x

s
N ] (3)

h

s
= CNN(vs) (4)



2295

where CNN represents the categorization model
from (Kim, 2014). The character vector hc is en-
coded in the same way with a separate CNN. Im-
plementation details are provided in the appendix.

LSTM A two-layer bi-LSTM encodes the sen-
tence words and concatenates the final time step
hidden states from both directions to yield hs. The
character vector hc is encoded the same way.

REN We use the “tied” recurrent entity network
from Henaff et al. (2017). A memory cell m is
initialized for each of the J characters in the story,
E = {e0, . . . , eJ}. The REN reads documents
one sentence at a time and updates mj for ej 2 E
after reading each sentence. Unlike the previous
encoders, all sentences of the context C are given
to the REN along with the sentence xs. The model
learns to distribute encoded information to the cor-
rect memory cells. The representation passed to
the downstream model is:

h

e
= {mj}s (5)

where {mj}s is the memory vector in the cell cor-
responding to ej after reading xs. Implementation
details are provided in the appendix.

NPN We also include the neural process net-
work from Bosselut et al. (2018) with “tied” en-
tities, but “untied” actions that are not grounded to
particular concepts. The memory is initialized and
accessed similarly as the REN. Exact implementa-
tion details are provided in the appendix.

5.2 State Classifier
Once the sentence-character encoding he is ex-
tracted, the state classifier predicts a binary label
ŷz for every category z 2 Z where Z is the set
of category labels for a particular psychological
theory (e.g., disgust, surprise, etc. in the Plutchik
wheel). We use logistic regression as a classifier:

ŷz = �(Wzh
e
+ bz) (6)

where Wz and bz are a label-specific set of weights
and biases for classifying each label z 2 Z .

5.3 Explanation Generator
The explanation generator is a single-layer LSTM
(Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) that receives
the encoded sentence-character representation he

and predicts each word yt in the explanation using
the same method from Sutskever et al. (2014). Im-
plementation details are provided in the appendix.

5.4 Annotation Classifier
For annotation classification tasks, words from
open-text explanations are encoded with TF-IDF
features. The same classifier architecture from
Section 5.2 is used to predict the labels.

6 Experimental Setup

6.1 Training
State Classification The dev set D is split into
two portions of 80% (D1) and 20% (D2). D1 is
used to train the classifier and encoder. D2 is used
to tune hyperparameters. The model is trained
to minimize the weighted binary cross entropy of
predicting a class label yz for each class z:

L =
ZX

z=1

�zyz log ŷz+(1��z)(1�yz) log(1� ŷz)

(7)
where Z is the number of labels in each of the
three classifications tasks and �z is defined as:

�z = 1� e�
p

P (yz) (8)

where P (yz) is the marginal class probability of a
positive label for z in the training set.

Annotation Classification The dev set is split
in the same manner as for state classification. The
TF-IDF features are trained on the set of training
annotations Dt coupled with those from D1. The
model must minimize the same loss as in Equa-
tion 7. Details are provided in the appendix.

Explanation Generation We use the training
set of open annotations to train a model to predict
explanations. The decoder is trained to minimize
the negative loglikelihood of predicting each word
in the explanation of a character’s state:

Lgen = �
TX

t=1

logP (yt|y0, ..., yt�1,he) (9)

where he is the sentence-character representation
produced by an encoder from Section 5.1.

6.2 Metrics
Classification For the state and annotation clas-
sification task, we report the micro-averaged pre-
cision (P), recall (R), and F1 score of the Plutchik,
Maslow, and Reiss prediction tasks. We report the
results of selecting a label at random in the top
two rows of Table 3. Note that random is low be-
cause the distribution of positive instances for each

Table 3: State Classification Results

category is very uneven: macro-averaged positive
class probabilities of 8.2, 1.7, and 9.9% per cate-
gory for Maslow, Reiss, and Plutchik respectively.

Generation Because explanations tend to be
short sequences (Figure 4) with high levels of syn-
onymy, traditional metrics such as BLEU are in-
adequate for evaluating generation quality. We
use the vector average and vector extrema metrics
from Liu et al. (2016) computed using the Glove
vectors of generated and reference words. We re-
port results in Table 5 on the dev set and compare
to a baseline that randomly samples an example
from the dev set as a generated sequence.

6.3 Ablations

Story Context vs. No Context Our dataset is
motivated by the importance of interpreting story
context to categorize emotional reactions and mo-
tivations of characters. To test this importance, we
ablate hc, the representation of the context sen-
tences pertaining to the character, as an input to the
state classifier for each encoder (except the REN
and NPN). In Table 3, this ablation is the first row
for each encoder presented.

Explanation Pretraining Because the state
classification and explanation generation tasks use
the same models to encode the story, we explore
initializing a classification encoder with parame-
ters trained on the generation task. For the CNN,
LSTM, and REN encoders, we pretrain a gener-
ator to produce emotion or motivation explana-

tions. We use the parameters from the emotion or
motivation explanation generators to initialize the
Plutchik or Maslow/Reiss classifiers respectively.

7 Experimental Results

State Classification We show results on the test
set for categorizing Maslow, Reiss, and Plutchik
states in Table 3. Despite the difficulty of the
task, all models outperform the random baseline.
Interestingly, the performance boost from adding
entity-specific contextual information (i.e., not ab-
lating hc) indicates that the models learn to condi-
tion on a character’s previous experience to clas-
sify its mental state at the current time step. This
effect can be seen in a story about a man whose
flight is cancelled. The model without context pre-
dicts the same emotional reactions for the man, his
wife and the pilot, but with context correctly pre-
dicts that the pilot will not have a reaction while
predicting that the man and his wife will feel sad.

For the CNN, LSTM, REN, and NPN models,
we also report results from pretraining encoder pa-
rameters using the free response annotations from
the training set. This pretraining offers a clear per-
formance boost for all models on all three predic-
tion tasks, showing that the parameters of the en-
coder can be pretrained on auxiliary tasks provid-
ing emotional and motivational state signal.

The best performing models in each task are
most effective at predicting Maslow physiological
needs, Reiss food motives, and Plutchik reactions
of joy. The relative ease of predicting motivations

related to food (and physiological needs generally)
may be because they involve a more limited and
concrete set of actions such as eating or cooking.

Annotation Classification Table 4 shows that a
simple model can learn to map open text responses
to categorical labels. This further supports our hy-
pothesis that pretraining a classification model on
the free-response annotations could be helpful in
boosting performance on the category prediction.

Explanation Generation Finally, we provide
results for the task of generating explanations of
motivations and emotions in Table 5. Because the
explanations are closely tied to emotional and mo-
tivation states, the randomly selected explanation
can often be close in embedding space to the ref-
erence explanations, making the random baseline
fairly competitive. However, all models outper-
form the strong baseline on both metrics, indicat-
ing that the generated short explanations are closer
semantically to the reference annotation.

8 Related work

Mental State Annotations Incorporating emo-
tion theories into NLP tasks has been explored
in previous projects. Ghosh et al. (2017) mod-
ulate language model distributions by increasing
the probability of words that express certain affec-
tive LIWC (Tausczik and Pennebaker, 2016) cat-
egories. More generally, various projects tackle
the problem of generating text from a set of at-
tributes like sentiment or generic-ness (Ficler and
Goldberg, 2017; Dong et al., 2017). Similarly,

there is also a body of research in reasoning about
commonsense stories and discourse (Li and Juraf-
sky, 2017; Mostafazadeh et al., 2016) or detecting
emotional stimuli in stories (Gui et al., 2017). Pre-
vious work in plot units (Lehnert, 1981) developed
formalisms for affect and mental state in story nar-
ratives that included motivations and reactions. In
our work, we collect mental state annotations for
stories to used as a new resource in this space.

Modeling Entity State Recently, novel works in
language modeling (Ji et al., 2017; Yang et al.,
2016), question answering (Henaff et al., 2017),
and text generation (Kiddon et al., 2016; Bosselut
et al., 2018) have shown that modeling entity state
explicitly can boost performance while providing
a preliminary interface for interpreting a model’s
prediction. Entity modeling in these works, how-
ever, was limited to tracking entity reference (Kid-
don et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2016; Ji et al., 2017),
recognizing entity state similarity (Henaff et al.,
2017) or predicting simple attributes from entity
states (Bosselut et al., 2018). Our work provides
a new dataset for tracking emotional reactions and
motivations of characters in stories.

9 Conclusion

We present a large scale dataset as a resource
for training and evaluating mental state track-
ing of characters in short commonsense stories.
This dataset contains over 300k low-level annota-
tions for character motivations and emotional re-
actions. We provide benchmark results on this
new resource. Importantly, we show that modeling
character-specific context and pretraining on free-
response data can boost labeling performance.
While our work only use information present in
our dataset, we view our dataset as a future testbed
for evaluating models trained on any number of
resources for learning common sense about emo-
tional reactions and motivations.
