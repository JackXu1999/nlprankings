Abstract

The context-dependent nature of online ag-
gression makes annotating large collections of
data extremely difficult. Previously studied
datasets in abusive language detection have
been insufficient in size to efficiently train
deep learning models. Recently, Hate and
Abusive Speech on Twitter, a dataset much
greater in size and reliability, has been re-
leased. However, this dataset has not been
comprehensively studied to its potential. In
this paper, we conduct the first comparative
study of various learning models on Hate and
Abusive Speech on Twitter, and discuss the
possibility of using additional features and
context data for improvements. Experimen-
tal results show that bidirectional GRU net-
works trained on word-level features, with La-
tent Topic Clustering modules, is the most ac-
curate model scoring 0.805 F1.

1 Introduction

Abusive language refers to any type of insult, vul-
garity, or profanity that debases the target; it also
can be anything that causes aggravation (Spertus,
1997; Schmidt and Wiegand, 2017). Abusive lan-
guage is often reframed as, but not limited to, of-
fensive language (Razavi et al., 2010), cyberbul-
lying (Xu et al., 2012), othering language (Bur-
nap and Williams, 2014), and hate speech (Djuric
et al., 2015).

Recently, an increasing number of users have
been subjected to harassment, or have witnessed
offensive behaviors online (Duggan, 2017). Major
social media companies (i.e. Facebook, Twitter)
have utilized multiple resources—artificial intelli-
gence, human reviewers, user reporting processes,
etc.—in effort to censor offensive language, yet
it seems nearly impossible to successfully resolve
the issue (Robertson, 2017; Musaddique, 2017).

∗* Equal contribution.

The major reason of the failure in abusive
language detection comes from its subjectivity
and context-dependent characteristics (Chatzakou
et al., 2017). For instance, a message can be re-
garded as harmless on its own, but when taking
previous threads into account it may be seen as
abusive, and vice versa. This aspect makes detect-
ing abusive language extremely laborious even for
human annotators; therefore it is difficult to build
a large and reliable dataset (Founta et al., 2018).

Previously, datasets openly available in abu-
sive language detection research on Twitter ranged
from 10K to 35K in size (Chatzakou et al., 2017;
Golbeck et al., 2017). This quantity is not suffi-
cient to train the significant number of parameters
in deep learning models. Due to this reason, these
datasets have been mainly studied by traditional
machine learning methods. Most recently, Founta
et al. (2018) introduced Hate and Abusive Speech
on Twitter, a dataset containing 100K tweets with
cross-validated labels. Although this corpus has
great potential in training deep models with its sig-
nificant size, there are no baseline reports to date.

This paper investigates the efficacy of differ-
ent learning models in detecting abusive language.
We compare accuracy using the most frequently
studied machine learning classifiers as well as re-
cent neural network models.1 Reliable baseline
results are presented with the first comparative
study on this dataset. Additionally, we demon-
strate the effect of different features and variants,
and describe the possibility for further improve-
ments with the use of ensemble models.

et al. (2010) applied Naı̈ve Bayes, and Warner and
Hirschberg (2012) used Support Vector Machine
(SVM), both with word-level features to classify
offensive language. Xiang et al. (2012) generated
topic distributions with Latent Dirichlet Alloca-
tion (Blei et al., 2003), also using word-level fea-
tures in order to classify offensive tweets.

More recently, distributed word representations
and neural network models have been widely ap-
plied for abusive language detection. Djuric et
al. (2015) used the Continuous Bag Of Words
model with paragraph2vec algorithm (Le and
Mikolov, 2014) to more accurately detect hate
speech than that of the plain Bag Of Words mod-
els. Badjatiya et al. (2017) implemented Gradi-
ent Boosted Decision Trees classifiers using word
representations trained by deep learning mod-
els. Other researchers have investigated character-
level representations and their effectiveness com-
pared to word-level representations (Mehdad and
Tetreault, 2016; Park and Fung, 2017).

As traditional machine learning methods have
relied on feature engineering, (i.e. n-grams, POS
tags, user information) (Schmidt and Wiegand,
2017), researchers have proposed neural-based
models with the advent of larger datasets. Con-
volutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural
Networks have been applied to detect abusive lan-
guage, and they have outperformed traditional ma-
chine learning classifiers such as Logistic Regres-
sion and SVM (Park and Fung, 2017; Badjatiya
et al., 2017). However, there are no studies inves-
tigating the efficiency of neural models with large-
scale datasets over 100K.

3 Methodology

This section illustrates our implementations on
traditional machine learning classifiers and neural
network based models in detail. Furthermore, we
describe additional features and variant models in-
vestigated.

3.1 Traditional Machine Learning Models

We implement five feature engineering based
machine learning classifiers that are most often
used for abusive language detection. In data
preprocessing, text sequences are converted into
Bag Of Words (BOW) representations, and nor-
malized with Term Frequency-Inverse Document
Frequency (TF-IDF) values. We experiment with
word-level features using n-grams ranging from

1 to 3, and character-level features from 3 to
8-grams. Each classifier is implemented with the
following specifications:

Naı̈ve Bayes (NB): Multinomial NB with additive
smoothing constant 1
Logistic Regression (LR): Linear LR with L2
regularization constant 1 and limited-memory
BFGS optimization
Support Vector Machine (SVM): Linear SVM
with L2 regularization constant 1 and logistic loss
function
Random Forests (RF): Averaging probabilistic
predictions of 10 randomized decision trees
Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT): Tree boosting
with learning rate 1 and logistic loss function

3.2 Neural Network based Models

Along with traditional machine learning ap-
proaches, we investigate neural network based
models to evaluate their efficacy within a larger
dataset. In particular, we explore Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNN), and their variant models. A
pre-trained GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014)
representation is used for word-level features.

CNN: We adopt Kim’s (2014) implementation as
the baseline. The word-level CNN models have 3
convolutional filters of different sizes [1,2,3] with
ReLU activation, and a max-pooling layer. For the
character-level CNN, we use 6 convolutional fil-
ters of various sizes [3,4,5,6,7,8], then add max-
pooling layers followed by 1 fully-connected layer
with a dimension of 1024.

Park and Fung (2017) proposed a HybridCNN
model which outperformed both word-level and
character-level CNNs in abusive language detec-
tion. In order to evaluate the HybridCNN for this
dataset, we concatenate the output of max-pooled
layers from word-level and character-level CNN,
and feed this vector to a fully-connected layer in
order to predict the output.

All three CNN models (word-level, character-
level, and hybrid) use cross entropy with softmax
as their loss function and Adam (Kingma and Ba,
2014) as the optimizer.

RNN: We use bidirectional RNN (Schuster and
Paliwal, 1997) as the baseline, implementing a
GRU (Cho et al., 2014) cell for each recurrent unit.



103

From extensive parameter-search experiments, we
chose 1 encoding layer with 50 dimensional hid-
den states and an input dropout probability of 0.3.
The RNN models use cross entropy with sigmoid
as their loss function and Adam as the optimizer.

For a possible improvement, we apply a self-
matching attention mechanism on RNN baseline
models (Wang et al., 2017) so that they may better
understand the data by retrieving text sequences
twice. We also investigate a recently introduced
method, Latent Topic Clustering (LTC) (Yoon
et al., 2018). The LTC method extracts latent topic
information from the hidden states of RNN, and
uses it for additional information in classifying the
text data.

3.3 Feature Extension

While manually analyzing the raw dataset, we no-
ticed that looking at the tweet one has replied to
or has quoted, provides significant contextual in-
formation. We call these, “context tweets”. As
humans can better understand a tweet with the ref-
erence of its context, our assumption is that com-
puters also benefit from taking context tweets into
account in detecting abusive language.

As shown in the examples below, (2) is la-
beled abusive due to the use of vulgar language.
However, the intention of the user can be better
understood with its context tweet (1).

(1) I hate when I’m sitting in front of the bus and somebody

with a wheelchair get on.

�

(2) I hate it when I’m trying to board a bus and there’s

already an as**ole on it.

Similarly, context tweet (3) is important in
understanding the abusive tweet (4), especially in
identifying the target of the malice.

(3) Survivors of #Syria Gas Attack Recount ‘a Cruel Scene’.

�

(4) Who the HELL is “LIKE” ING this post? Sick people....

Huang et al. (2016) used several attributes of
context tweets for sentiment analysis in order
to improve the baseline LSTM model. How-
ever, their approach was limited because the meta-
information they focused on—author information,
conversation type, use of the same hashtags or
emojis—are all highly dependent on data.

In order to avoid data dependency, text se-
quences of context tweets are directly used as

Labels Normal Spam Hateful Abusive
Number 42,932 9,757 3,100 15,115

(%) (60.5) (13.8) (4.4) (21.3)

Table 1: Label distribution of crawled tweets

an additional feature of neural network models.
We use the same baseline model to convert con-
text tweets to vectors, then concatenate these vec-
tors with outputs of their corresponding labeled
tweets. More specifically, we concatenate max-
pooled layers of context and labeled tweets for the
CNN baseline model. As for RNN, the last hidden
states of context and labeled tweets are concate-
nated.

4 Experiments

4.1 Dataset

Hate and Abusive Speech on Twitter (Founta et al.,
2018) classifies tweets into 4 labels, “normal”,
“spam”, “hateful” and “abusive”. We were only
able to crawl 70,904 tweets out of 99,996 tweet
IDs, mainly because the tweet was deleted or the
user account had been suspended. Table 1 shows
the distribution of labels of the crawled data.

4.2 Data Preprocessing

In the data preprocessing steps, user IDs, URLs,
and frequently used emojis are replaced as special
tokens. Since hashtags tend to have a high correla-
tion with the content of the tweet (Lehmann et al.,
2012), we use a segmentation library2 (Segaran
and Hammerbacher, 2009) for hashtags to extract
more information.

For character-level representations, we apply
the method Zhang et al. (2015) proposed. Tweets
are transformed into one-hot encoded vectors us-
ing 70 character dimensions—26 lower-cased al-
phabets, 10 digits, and 34 special characters in-
cluding whitespace.

4.3 Training and Evaluation

In training the feature engineering based machine
learning classifiers, we truncate vector represen-
tations according to the TF-IDF values (the top
14,000 and 53,000 for word-level and character-
level representations, respectively) to avoid over-
fitting. For neural network models, words that ap-
pear only once are replaced as unknown tokens.

Table 2: Experimental results of learning models and their variants, followed by the context tweet models. The
top 2 scores are marked as bold for each metric.

Since the dataset used is not split into train, de-
velopment, and test sets, we perform 10-fold cross
validation, obtaining the average of 5 tries; we di-
vide the dataset randomly by a ratio of 85:5:10,
respectively. In order to evaluate the overall per-
formance, we calculate the weighted average of
precision, recall, and F1 scores of all four labels,
“normal”, “spam”, “hateful”, and “abusive”.

4.4 Empirical Results

As shown in Table 2, neural network models
are more accurate than feature engineering based
models (i.e. NB, SVM, etc.) except for the LR
model—the best LR model has the same F1 score
as the best CNN model.

Among traditional machine learning models,
the most accurate in classifying abusive language
is the LR model followed by ensemble models
such as GBT and RF. Character-level represen-
tations improve F1 scores of SVM and RF clas-
sifiers, but they have no positive effect on other
models.

For neural network models, RNN with LTC
modules have the highest accuracy score, but there
are no significant improvements from its base-
line model and its attention-added model. Simi-
larly, HybridCNN does not improve the baseline
CNN model. For both CNN and RNN models,
character-level features significantly decrease the
accuracy of classification.

The use of context tweets generally have little

effect on baseline models, however they notice-
ably improve the scores of several metrics. For
instance, CNN with context tweets score the high-
est recall and F1 for “hateful” labels, and RNN
models with context tweets have the highest recall
for “abusive” tweets.

5 Discussion and Conclusion

While character-level features are known to im-
prove the accuracy of neural network mod-
els (Badjatiya et al., 2017), they reduce classifi-
cation accuracy for Hate and Abusive Speech on
Twitter. We conclude this is because of the lack of
labeled data as well as the significant imbalance
among the different labels. Unlike neural network
models, character-level features in traditional ma-
chine learning classifiers have positive results be-
cause we have trained the models only with the
most significant character elements using TF-IDF
values.

Variants of neural network models also suffer
from data insufficiency. However, these models
show positive performances on “spam” (14%) and
“hateful” (4%) tweets—the lower distributed la-
bels. The highest F1 score for “spam” is from
the RNN-LTC model (0.551), and the highest for
“hateful” is CNN with context tweets (0.309).
Since each variant model excels in different met-
rics, we expect to see additional improvements
with the use of ensemble models of these variants
in future works.

In this paper, we report the baseline accuracy
of different learning models as well as their vari-
ants on the recently introduced dataset, Hate and
Abusive Speech on Twitter. Experimental results
show that bidirectional GRU networks with LTC
provide the most accurate results in detecting abu-
sive language. Additionally, we present the possi-
bility of using ensemble models of variant models
and features for further improvements.
