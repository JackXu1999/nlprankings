Abstract 

 This paper describes a corpus of nearly 10K French-Chinese aligned segments, produced by post-
editing machine translated computer science courseware. This corpus was built from 2013 to 2016 with-

in the MACAU project, by native Chinese students. The quality, as judged by native speakers, is ade-

quate for understanding (far better than by reading only the original French) and for getting better 

marks. This corpus is annotated at segment-level by a self-assessed quality score. It has been directly 

used as supplemental training data to build a statistical machine translation system dedicated to that sub-

language, and can be used to extract the specific bilingual terminology. To our knowledge, it is the first 

corpus of this kind to be released.  

1 Introduction 

The ongoing MACAU project, started in 2012 at the University of Grenoble, aims at providing multi-

lingual access to course material taught at the university (Kalitvianski et al, 2015). It is motivated by 

the fact that many foreign students struggle with understanding material taught in French, and have to 

spend extra time in dictionary lookup and translation to fully comprehend the meaning.  

The MACAU platform1 is designed to create multilingual versions of initially monolingual course ma-

terial by producing machine translations into the desired language, and by providing an interface that 

allows readers to post-edit these translations, segment by segment, until the desired level of quality is 

achieved.  

A direct by-product of this activity is a bilingual corpus of post-edited sentences, constituting full 

courses, exercises and so on, concerning several fields of theoretical and practical computer science. 

Such a corpus could be employed as supplemental data for training a custom machine translation sys-

tem. It can also serve for extraction of domain-specific lexicon.  

In this paper we describe the data, provide corpus statistics, and delineate potential uses for the cor-

pus.  

2 The MACAU corpus 

In this section we describe the MACAU project within which this corpus was constructed, and give 

the corpus’ characteristics. 

2.1 The MACAU project 

The MACAU project has been ongoing since 2012. Its purpose is to help foreign students access edu-

cational material produced by the university in their native tongues, as those are the ones they under-

stand best.  

This is achieved by post-editing machine-translated documents, segment by segment. The post-

edition is done via the iMAG web interface (Boitet et al, 2008). An iMAG is an interactive multilin-

gual access gateway, which allows its users to visit a web page in the language of their choice while 

preserving its layout.  

Pages are automatically segmented into translation units, typically sentences or titles. Segments are 

substituted by either a machine translation output if the segment is not found in the dedicated transla-

tion memory, or by the best post-edition available if the segment has been post-edited. Users can con-

tribute corrections directly on the page by hovering the mouse pointer over the segment they desire to

correct, which makes a post-editing palette appear. The quality of a post-edition is explicitly “self-

assessed” by the post-editor through a score in [0..20]. That score can later be revised, for example by 

other Chinese students using the Chinese version to study. Note that the interface allows to see the tar-

get (Chinese) and source (French) versions to appear side by side, so that, while learning some topic in 

computer science, Chinese students can also progress in French.  

Post-editing through the iMAG interface is typically 3 times faster than translation from scratch 

(15-20 mins vs. 1 hour per standard page of 250 words). Also, for the post-editor, such an interface has 

the benefit of allowing post-editors to see the segment within its context.

For the MACAU project, the source documents are provided by teachers and also by students, and 

cover subjects concerning bachelor and master-level computer science. Table 1 below describes the 

quantity and the subject matters included in the corpus.

Post-editing was performed by three Chinese-speaking university students, selected for their 

knowledge of the courses. Two were masters’ students, one was a third year bachelors’. All have been 

taught the subject in French.  

Students were selected on the basis of their knowledge of Chinese, their familiarity with the subject 

matters, and their interest in the task. They were explained the purpose of the task, and practiced on 

training documents before post-editing those that are included in the corpus. They received some 

monetary compensation for their work (as interns).

The students were asked to post-edit machine-generated translations segment by segment, through 

the iMAG interface, until an acceptable Chinese formulation of each segment was obtained. They 

were also told that the priority was not literary quality, but rather understandability. A group of two 

other native Chinese speakers subsequently verified the correctness a subset of randomly selected 

translations.  

2.2 Corpus characteristics 

The corpus is a collection of 9662 aligned French-Chinese segments, extracted from courseware in 

HTML. This corpus is cleaned of all HTML markup, however it does contain other non-linguistic el-

ements, such as mathematical and logical formulas.  

 The segmentation was produced automatically and has not been corrected manually, therefore 

some segments correspond to fragments of sentences, and, more rarely, to two sentences fused togeth-

er. Primary translations were obtained automatically via Google Translate.  

The average source segment length is ~72 characters, or about 11 French words, and the median 

length is 53 characters. 25% of the source segments are less than 26 characters long and another 25% 

are over 100 characters long. Moreover, the corpus contains 108860 words, of which 8819 are unique 

French tokens.  

The corpus initially contained many redundancies, but has been substantially cleaned. The remain-

ing few source redundancies differ by their Chinese translations. The quality of the segments, as 

judged by bilingual readers, is considered adequate for understanding.

3 Building a specialized MT system for that sublanguage 

One possible use of this corpus is the training of a specialized MT system for educational documents.  

3.1 Motivations and method 

We are interested in increasing the usage quality of machine translation systems. We measure usage 

quality as a function of post-edition times related to an estimate of the human translation time, which 

by default is assumed to be 60 minutes per standard 250 word page.    

 

                     (1) 
Formula 1: A measure for the usage quality of a MT system. 

 

For example, Q = 40% is Tpetotal = 30 mn/p (8/20), and Q = 90% if Tpetotal = 5 mn/p (18/20). 

 

This corpus has been used by Wang (2015) as supplemental data for training a specialized Moses 

(Koehn et al. 2007) probabilistic machine translation system through incremental training, yielding 

better usage quality than a generalistic PMT system.

3.2 Usage of Moses incremental training  

When new training data is available, a way of adding it to an existing model is incremental training. It 

is an iterative process that avoids the time-consuming retraining of a new model from scratch3.  

The V0 of the system was trained on 100K bilingual segments from the MultiUN corpus (Eisele et al, 

2010). Batches of 5000 segments taken from several in-domain corpora were iteratively added, includ-

ing a raw form of this corpus that contained 16000 unfiltered segments. 

3.3 Evolution of post-editing times 

After 16 iterations, results show that the incremental training method reduces post-edition times, in a 

short amount of time (16 iterations, about 90 hours of computation, without ever recompiling every-

thing). This system yields a usage quality of 70%, with 15 mins/std_page, better than Google Trans-

late.

The BLEU score (Papineni et al. 2002) improved as well, going from 13.8% after the first iteration 

to 48.3% after the last one. 

Conclusion 

We have presented a bilingual parallel corpus of nearly 10K aligned French-Chinese segments, pro-

duced over three years in the course of the MACAU project. This corpus is released under a free li-

cense and will be periodically updated as new post-editions become available. To our knowledge, this 

is the first corpus of this kind to be published 

The multilingual access platform being open to everyone, this corpus can be extended by anyone by 

post-editing either pre-existing or newly uploaded documents, something that we encourage. 

Although a large-scale evaluation of the usefulness of the platform will be carried out in the near fu-

ture, we have already observed that the process of post-editing improves understanding and exam 

grades. An example of this is a student whose exam grade rose from 2.5/20 to 11/20 after a month of 

post-editing material related to the subject. Undoubtedly, several factors were at play, but this appears 

to be an interesting avenue of investigation.
