Abstract

We propose a method for joint unsu-
pervised discovery of multiword expres-
sions (MWEs) and their translations from
parallel corpora. First, we apply inde-
pendent monolingual MWE extraction in
source and target languages simultane-
ously. Then, we calculate translation prob-
ability, association score and distributional
similarity of co-occurring pairs. Finally,
we rank all translations of a given MWE
using a linear combination of these fea-
tures. Preliminary experiments on light
verb constructions show promising results.

1 Introduction

The automatic discovery of multiword expres-
sions (MWEs) has been a topic of interest in the
computational linguistics community for a while
(Choueka, 1988; Church and Hanks, 1990). In the
last 20 years, multilingual discovery of MWEs has
gained some popularity thanks to the widespread
use of statistical machine translation (MT), auto-
matic word alignment tools and freely available
parallel corpora (Zarrieß and Kuhn, 2009; Attia et
al., 2010; Caseli et al., 2010). MWEs tend to be
non compositional or show some kind of lexico-
syntactic inflexibility, which is often reflected in
translation asymmetries (Manning and Schütze,
1999). Therefore, parallel corpora are rich re-
sources to mine for MWEs. Techniques adapted
from machine translation can help to exploit trans-
lation information for the specific needs of MWE
discovery.

Parallel corpora can be useful for MWE discov-
ery in many ways. First, a second (target) lan-
guage can be used to model features, which in turn
help in the discovery of new MWEs in a single
(source) language (Salehi and Cook, 2013; Caseli

et al., 2010; Tsvetkov and Wintner, 2014). Sec-
ond, one can also use parallel data to discover
the translations of known multiword lexical units
(Morin and Daille, 2010). Finally, it is possible to
perform both simultaneously, generating a bilin-
gual lexicon of MWEs and their potential transla-
tions from the parallel corpus, as proposed in this
paper.

The goal of our paper is to propose a new
method for unsupervised joint discovery of MWEs
and their translations. It consists in discovering
potential MWEs on source and target texts inde-
pendently, and then trying to match them with-
out using automatic word alignment. It is impor-
tant to emphasize that we are not against the use
of word alignment for this task, but we are in-
terested in seeing how the automatic discovery of
MWEs can be performed without relying on this
information. Moreover, our experiments focus on
light verb constructions such as to make a presen-
tation and to take a walk, which generally contain
non-adjacent tokens and thus would probably not
be captured by standard word alignment methods.
We study several features to rank automatically
extracted candidates that could be translations of
each other. We show preliminary results that indi-
cate this approach is promising and point towards
future improvements.

2 Related Work

Multilingual resources in general can be used for
MWE discovery. Attia et al. (2010), for instance,
do not rely on parallel texts but on short Wikipedia
page titles, cross-linked across multiple languages.
They consider that, if a page whose title contains a
cross-lingual link to a page whose title is a single
word (in any available language), then the original
page title is probably a MWE. Similarly, transla-
tion links in Wiktionary can be exploited, among

91



other features, for predicting the compositionality
of MWEs (Salehi et al., 2014a).

Another possibility to model non-translatability
without recurring to parallel corpora consists
in building up artificial word-for-word MWE
translations using bilingual single-word dictionar-
ies. Afterwards, the existence of these automat-
ically generated potential translations can be as-
sessed in large monolingual corpora (Morin and
Daille, 2010). This can be used as a feature,
among other sources of information, in super-
vised or semi-supervised monolingual MWE dis-
covery (Tsvetkov and Wintner, 2011; Rondon et
al., 2015). Bilingual dictionaries can also be used
to predict the compositionality of MWEs by es-
timating the string similarity (Salehi and Cook,
2013) or distributional similarity (Salehi et al.,
2014b) between translations of an MWE and of
the single words it contains.

Melamed (1997) describes one of the earliest
attempts to extract MWEs from parallel corpora.
The method is based on lexical alignment and mu-
tual information. Statistical lexical alignment can
provide straightforward MWE candidates, which
can be further filtered using POS patterns and
association scores. If two or more words in a
source language are aligned to the same word
on the target side, the source is likely an MWE
(Caseli et al., 2010). Conversely, one can as-
sume that some types of MWEs such as verb-
noun combinations tend to be translated as MWEs
with the same syntactic structure, using aligned
dependency-parsed corpora for discovery (Zarrieß
and Kuhn, 2009). Instead of focusing on 1-to-
many alignments, Tsvetkov and Wintner (2010)
propose a method which incrementally removes
from parallel sentences word pairs that are surely
not MWEs. Therefore, they use bilingual dictio-
naries and alignment reliability scores. The re-
maining units are considered candidate MWEs.

Bilingual lexicons containing MWEs are impor-
tant resources for MT systems. It has been shown
that the presence of MWEs can harm the quality
of both statistical (Ramisch et al., 2013) and rule-
based (Barreiro et al., 2014) MT systems. Simple
techniques for taking MWEs into account such as
binary features (Carpuat and Diab, 2010) and spe-
cial token markers (Cap et al., 2015) can help im-
proving translation quality. However, this may not
suffice if the expressions are not correctly identi-
fied with the help of bilingual MWE lexicons.

3 Bilingual MWE Lexicon Creation

Most existing methods exploit parallel corpora to
discover MWEs in a single language. They use
translation information, among other sources, to
confirm the idiosyncratic behaviour of the MWE
in the source language, but do not output possi-
ble translations as a result of the discovery algo-
rithm. In this section, we propose a method to cre-
ate probabilistic bilingual MWE dictionaries using
minimal supervision.

First, we extract MWE candidates from pre-
processed (POS-tagged and lemmatized) source
and target texts separately. In our experiments, the
texts were pre-processed by TreeTagger (Schmid,
1994). We explicitly configured it not to segment
sentences, since we need to preserve the alignment
between source and target sentences in our input
parallel corpus.

To allow the extraction of these monolingual
MWE candidates, it is necessary to manually de-
fine POS patterns in both languages. This step re-
quires some knowledge about the languages and
about the syntactic patterns of the MWEs that we
want to extract. These patterns were defined using
the mwetoolkit corpus query language and can-
didate extraction tools (Ramisch, 2015).1 In this
first moment, we focused on MWEs translated into
MWEs, but we believe that the technique could
be adapted to MWEs translated into single words.
For instance, one could extract verbal MWEs from
the source corpus and try to match them with
single-word verbs in the target language. In the-
ory, any monolingual MWE discovery approach
could be used to obtain candidates on each side
of the parallel corpus independently.

The process described above outputs two sets
of candidates. The first set S = {s1, s2, . . . , s|S|}
contains MWE candidates si extracted from
the source corpus. The second set T =
{t1, t2, . . . , t|T |} contains MWE candidates tj ex-
tracted from the target corpus. Then, we try to map
source MWEs si to their target correspondences
tj . To do so, we calculate the conditional proba-
bility of each potential translation (tj) in T given
a source (si):

P (tj |si) = c(si, tj)
c(si)

Here, c(si, tj) is the number of times a source can-
didate si was found in a sentence whose transla-

1http://mwetoolkit.sf.net/

92



tion contained tj and c(si) is simply the number
of occurrences of the candidate in the source cor-
pus. Since candidates si and tj can be discontin-
uous, their numbers of occurrences are not neces-
sarily n-gram counts, but must be obtained during
monolingual candidate discovery as output by the
mwetoolkit.

Another measure that we use to rank transla-
tions is the t-score. This association score es-
timates to what extent the co-occurrence of a
group of words is outstanding compared to ran-
dom chance co-occurrence. For each target can-
didate tj = w

tj
1 w

tj
2 . . . w

tj
n , formed by n words

w
tj
k , we compute the expected number of occur-

rences by multiplying all individual word proba-

bilities c(w
tj
k

)

N and then scaling this joint probabil-
ity by the total number of tokens in the target cor-
pus N :

E(tj) =
c(wtj1 )× c(wtj2 )× . . .× c(wtjn )

Nn−1

The t-score, also obtained using the mwetoolkit,
is the difference between observed and expected
counts normalized by an estimate of the standard
deviation of the distribution:

tscore(tj) =
c(tj)− E(tj)√

c(tj)

Finally, we calculate the multilingual distribu-
tional similarity between pairs si and tj . This
score is based on a pre-trained vector space model
which uses sentence alignment information to en-
sure that words that are translations of each other
end up being close in the resulting semantic space.
Since each unit si and tj is composed of m and
n words, respectively, we use the average cosine
similarity between all possible m×n source-target
pairs present in the semantic space:2

Sim(si, tj) =
1

m× n
∑

k = 1..m
l = 1..n

cos(wsik , w
tj
l )

The bilingual semantic space is obtained using
MultiVec (Bérard et al., 2016).3 Distributional
similarity between source and target candidate
words is obtained using the bag of words mode.

2The normalization factor may be less than m × n when
some pairs wsik , w

tj
l do not occur in the semantic space.

3https://github.com/eske/multivec

The three scores are normalized so that their
values fall between 0 and 1. The final score F
is simply a log-linear combination of these scores:

F (tj |si) =
∑

f∈{P,tscore,Sim}
− log norm(f(tj , si))

The lower its value, the more likely a given pair
of source and target MWEs is.

4 Experimental Setup

For this work, the pre-processed texts (POS-
tagged source and target texts) were obtained from
the FAPESP parallel corpus containing 166,719
aligned sentences of Brazilian Portuguese texts
translated into English (Aziz and Specia, 2011).
The source corpus contains 4,191,942 tokens and
the target corpus contains 4,499,064 tokens.4

Our experiments employ manually defined pat-
terns for the monolingual step. These patterns
target light-verb constructions in Portuguese and
some possible translations into English:

GET+ADJ The first pattern consists of the Por-
tuguese verb ficar (to become) immediately fol-
lowed by an adjective. This frequent construc-
tion often indicates a change of state (inchoative).
On the target language (English), we build a simi-
lar pattern consisting of verbs to be/become/get +
an adjective, which we assume as being frequent
translations for the source construction.

MAKE+N This pattern is formed by the verb re-
alizar (to make) followed by a noun. Between
the verb and the noun there can be any number
of adjectives, adverbs or determinants, which are
ignored in the extracted candidate. For the trans-
lation, we build an equivalent pattern with verbs
to make/carry due to the high occurrence of carry
out in the target corpus.

TAKE+N This pattern is formed by verbs
fazer/tomar/dar (to make/take/give) followed by
a noun. We allow intervening elements as
for MAKE+N. In English, we use verbs to
make/do/take. Notice that verb to give was con-
sidered as an unlikely translation and disregarded.

5 Preliminary Results

As mentioned in Section 3, we used the mwe-
toolkit to apply the patterns and calculate t-scores

and MultiVec for bilingual similarity. Unfortu-
nately, quantitative evaluation was not yet per-
formed. Nonetheless, in this section, we present
some examples of discovered MWEs along with
their translations. We point out positive and neg-
ative results in this small sample that give us an
idea of our approach’s potential.

Table 1 shows ranked examples extracted from
the source and target corpus for the first pattern.
The entries are ranked by final score, more likely
translations appear on the top of the table and the
correct ones are in bold. According to these exam-
ples, the MWE pairs with lowest scores are cor-
rectly aligned to a valid translation. In addition to
the final score (F), target t-score (ts T) and similar-
ity (Sim), the table also shows how many times the
source MWE co-occurred with the target MWE
(# T). This information allows us to calculate the
conditional probability.

It is important to point out that our approach
does not work for all cases, as some spurious pairs
also occur. For example, in the first half of table
1, become sick is indeed a possible translation for
ficar doente but it appears in a worst position com-
pared to be normal, which is not a possible transla-
tion. Beyond the conditional probability, distribu-
tional similarity and t-score seem to help in some
cases. For instance, get ready appears only once
as a translation of ficar pronto, but still it gets a
better score than be capable, a wrong translation
with higher conditional probability. In general, we
have observed that the pattern GET+ADJ is quite
“easy” to translate as these constructions show a
high degree of regularity.

Table 2 shows the results of the extraction for
MAKE+N. The results for realizar teste show that
the best ranked MWEs are the corrected transla-
tions. The last row of this table shows a drawback

of our approach: that it is not possible to obtain re-
liable probability scores when the pattern just ap-
pears once.

The results in table 3 show the extraction for
the last pattern, TAKE+N. Despite the first half of
this table presenting good results for do compari-
son and make comparison, the second half shows
that some patterns do not work for the target side.
The verb dar in Portuguese is a productive light
verb, specially when combined with participles
(dar uma caminhada/corrida/passeada lit. to give
a walk/run/stroll). On the other hand, the transla-
tions usually involve a single verb and not a light-
verb construction. This indicates that further er-
ror analysis is required, studying the three verbs in
this pattern separately.

6 Conclusions and Future Work

This paper constitutes our first proposal towards
automatic discovery of bilingual MWE lexicons.
While preliminary results are promising, the obvi-

94



ous next step is to design an evaluation protocol
and apply it. Having this goal set, the idea is test-
ing the approach first with other patterns and, then,
making a robust evaluation.

We would also like to extrapolate this method
to other language pairs and MWE categories, spe-
cially those MWE translated as single words. In
this case, we are still investigating solutions but
one of them consists in using monolingual word
embeddings and similarity measures in order to
define if the translation should be an MWE or a
single word.

We believe that the method itself can be im-
proved in many ways. For instance, we would
like to design a distributional similarity measure
able to focus on valid alignments. We would
also like to experiment with different weights for
the scores (e.g. similarity seems more important
than t-score). Optimizing, that is, learning these
weights from small amounts of supervised data,
sounds appealing as well.

At the moment, the extraction patterns represent
a bottleneck and bias the obtained results towards
more plausible translations. We would like to find
a way to get rid of them, specially when it comes
to the target side. Another point that must be un-
derlined is the fact that, as we are not discarding
the use of word alignment in the future, we would
like to perform a systematic quantitative compari-
son with related work and methods based on word
alignment.
