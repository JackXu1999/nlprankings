Abstract

Unresolved coreference is a bottleneck for re-
lation extraction, and high-quality coreference
resolvers may produce an output that makes it
a lot easier to extract knowledge triples. We
show how to improve coreference resolvers by
forwarding their input to a relation extraction
system and reward the resolvers for produc-
ing triples that are found in knowledge bases.
Since relation extraction systems can rely on
different forms of supervision and be biased
in different ways, we obtain the best perfor-
mance, improving over the state of the art, us-
ing multi-task reinforcement learning.

1 Introduction

Coreference annotations are costly and difficult
to obtain, since trained annotators with sufficient
world knowledge are necessary for reliable anno-
tations. This paper presents a way to simulate an-
notators using reinforcement learning. To moti-
vate our approach, we rely on the following exam-
ple from Martschat and Strube (2014, colors added
to mark entity mentions):

(1) [ . . . . . . . .Lynyrd. . . . . . . . . .Skynyrd]1 was formed in Florida2.
Other bands from [the Sunshine State]2 in-
clude Fireflight and

Manson.

Martschat and Strube (2014) cite the associa-
tion between Florida and the Sunshine State as an
example of a common source of name-name re-
call error for state-of-the-art coreference resolu-
tion systems. The challenge is that the two names
co-occur relatively infrequently and are unlikely
to do so in a moderate-sized, manually annotated
training corpus. A state-of-the-art system may be
able to infer the relation using distributional infor-
mation about the phrase the Sunshine State, but is
likely to have limited evidence for the decision that
it is coreferential with Florida rather than . . . . . . .Lynyrd

. . . . . . . . .Skynyrd.

While coreference-annotated data is scarce,
knowledge bases including factual information
(such as that Fireflight is from Florida) are in-
creasingly available. For a human annotator un-
aware that Florida is sometimes referred to as the
Sunshine State, the information that Fireflight is
from Florida is sufficient to establish that Florida
and the Sunshine State are (with high probability)
coreferential. This paper explores a novel archi-
tecture for making use of such information from
knowledge bases by tying a coreference resolution
system to a relation extraction system, enabling
us to reward the coreference system for making
predictions that lead us to infer facts that are con-
sistent with such knowledge bases. This poten-
tially provides us with more evidence for resolving
coreference such as (1).

We propose a training strategy (Figure 1) in
which we pass on the predictions of a neural
coreference resolver to an open relation extraction
(OpenRE) system, matching relations extracted
from resolved sentences with a knowledge base.
We show how checking the produced relationships
for consistency against the knowledge base pro-
duces a reward that is, indirectly, a signal about
the quality of the coreference resolution. In order
to generalize this signal beyond the coverage of
the knowledge base, we train a Universal Schema
model (Riedel et al., 2013) and use its confidence
as our reward function. With this reward function,

2 Consistency Reward for Coreference
Resolution

In order to reward a coreference resolver for be-
ing consistent with world knowledge, we propose
a simple training strategy based on relation extrac-
tion: (i) Sample a Wikipedia1 document at ran-
dom, (ii) Replace mentions with their antecedents
using a coreference resolver, (iii) Apply an off-
the-shelf openRE system to each rewritten docu-
ment, (iv) Score relationships that include corefer-
ent mentions using Universal Schema, and (v) Use
the score as a reward for training the coreference
resolvers.

1https://www.wikipedia.org

Reward functions To model consistency with
world knowledge, we train different Universal
Schema models (Riedel et al., 2013; Verga and
McCallum, 2016), resulting in three reward func-
tions (Figure 2): RE-KG (Knowledge Graph Uni-
versal Schema) is trained to predict whether two
entities are linked in Wikidata2; RE-Text (Text-
based Universal Schema) is trained to predict
whether two entities co-occur in Wikipedia; and
RE-Joint (Joint Universal Schema) is trained to
predict whether two entities are linked and co-
occur. The three rewards focus on different aspects
of relationships between entities, giving compli-
mentary views of what entities are related.

Similar to Verga et al. (2016), we parameter-
ize candidate relation phrases with a BiLSTM
(Graves and Schmidhuber, 2005), and use pre-
trained Wikidata BigGraph embeddings (Lerer
et al., 2019) as the entity representations. We ap-
ply a one-layer MLP on the concatenated repre-
sentations to get the reward value.

Updating the coreference resolver Each re-
solved document is converted into n subject-
relation-object (SRO) triples by an open informa-
tion retrieval system (Angeli et al., 2015). Each

triple ti is then scored using a reward function to
obtain a reward ri for i ∈ {1, . . . , n}. The fi-
nal document-level reward is the normalized sum
of the individual rewards as shown in Equation 1,
where Rh is a moving window containing the pre-
vious h = 100 normalized reward values.

R =

∑
i ri −mean(Rh)
stddev(Rh)

(1)

Since R is not differentiable with respect to
the coreference resolver’s parameters, we use pol-
icy gradient training to update the coreference re-
solver. We select the best action according to the
current policy, using random exploration of the al-
ternative solutions with p = 110 .

Multi-task reinforcement learning Our overall
training procedure is presented in Algorithm 1.
After training the three aforementioned reward
models, we create RE-Distill by interpolating
their trained weights. Next, we pre-train a corefer-
ence resolver using supervised learning, and fine-
tune it using each of the three reward functions
to get three different coreference policies: Coref-
KG, Coref-Text and Coref-Joint, respectively.
We then use multi-task reinforcement learning to
combine these three policies to get Coref-Distill.
Our approach is a particular instance of DisTraL
(Teh et al., 2017), using policy gradient and model
interpolation. Finally, Coref-Distill is fine-tuned
with rewards from RE-Distill.

3 Experiments

We use a state-of-the-art neural coreference res-
olution model (Lee et al., 2018) as our baseline
coreference resolver.3 This model extends Lee
et al. (2017) with coarse-to-fine inference and
ELMo pretrained embeddings (Peters et al., 2018).

Data We use the standard training, validation,
and test splits from the English OntoNotes.4 We
also evaluate on the English WikiCoref (Ghaddar
and Langlais, 2016), with a validation and test split
of 10 and 20 documents respectively.

Reward model training We use data from En-
glish Wikipedia and Wikidata to train our three re-
ward models. For training RE-KG, we sample 1
million Wikidata triples, and expand them to 12
million triples by replacing relation phrases with

their aliases. For RE-Text, we pass the summary
paragraphs from 50,000 random Wikipedia pages
to Stanford’s OpenIE extractor (Manning et al.,
2014), creating 2 million triples. For RE-Joint,
we only use Wikipedia triples that are grounded
in Wikidata, resulting in 60,000 triples.5 We fur-
ther sample 200,000 triples from Wikidata and
Wikipedia for validation, and train the reward
models with early stopping based on the F1 score
of their predictions.

Evaluation All models are evaluated using the
standard CoNLL metric, which is the average F1
score over MUC, CEAFe, and B3 (Denis and
Baldridge, 2009).

4 Results

Since the quality of our reward models is essen-
tial to the performance of the coreference resolver
adaptations, we first report the validation accuracy
and F1 scores of the four reward models used, in
Table 1. We clearly see the advantage of distil-
lation, with a 5% absolute difference between the
best single model (RE-Text) and RE-Distill.

Table 2 presents the downstream effects of
applying these reward functions to our baseline
coreference policy.6

object can be linked to an entity in Wikidata.

significant w.r.t. B3 (bootstrap test, p < 0.05).

The coreference resolution results are similar
to the relation extraction results: using a distilled
policy, learned through multi-task reinforcement
learning, leads to better results on both datasets.7

While improvements over the current state of
the art are relatively small, they reflect signifi-
cant progress, as they demonstrate the ability to
successfully augment coreference resolvers with
“free" data from large-scale KB like Wikidata. For
relation extraction, this could have positive down-
stream effects, and also ensure that relations are
consistent with real world knowledge. Moreover,
this approach has the potential to also be benefi-
cial for coreference resolution in low resource lan-
guages, where less annotated data is available, as
Wikidata triples are abundant for many languages.

5 Analysis

Empirically, we find that fine-tuning the corefer-
ence resolver on Wikidata results in two kinds of
improvements:

Better mention detection Since the model is
rewarded if the SRO triples produced from the
resolved document are present in Wikidata, the
model can do well only if it correctly resolves the

dom seeds and observed the same pattern and very robust per-
formance across the board.

subject and object, which are usually named en-
tities (more generally, noun phrases). Indeed, we
see an improvement in mention detection as exem-
plified in the first example of Figure 3. Compared
to the baseline, the fine-tuned model identifies
a larger number of entities, including “southern
hemisphere”, “Cambridge” and “Oxford”, which
are missed by the baseline model.

Better linking As a direct consequence of the
above, the model is inclined to also link noun
phrases that are not entities. In the second example
of Figure 3, we see that “This attempt” is linked to
“releasing” by the fine-tuned model. Interestingly,
we do not see this type of eventive noun phrase
linking either in OntoNotes or in the predictions
of the baseline model.

This phenomenon, however, also has a side-
effect of producing singleton clusters and spurious
linking, which adversely affect the recall. On the
OntoNotes test data, while the average precision
of the best performing fine-tuned model is higher
than the baseline (75.62 vs. 73.80), a drop in recall
(70.75 vs. 71.34) causes the final F1 score to only
marginally improve.

6 Related Work

Coreference resolution Among neural corefer-
ence resolvers (Wu and Ma, 2017; Meng and
Rumshisky, 2018), Lee et al. (2017) were the
first to propose an end-to-end resolver which
did not rely on hand-crafted rules or a syntactic
parser. Extending this work, Lee et al. (2018)
introduced a novel attention mechanism for it-
eratively ranking spans of candidate coreferent
mentions, thereby improving the identification of
long distance coreference chains. Zhang et al.
(2019) improve pronoun coreference resolution by
2.2 F1 using linguistic features (gender, animacy
and plurality) and a frequency based predicate-
argument selection preference as external knowl-
edge. Emami et al. (2018) incorporate knowledge
into coreference resolution by means of informa-
tion retrieval, finding sentences that are syntacti-
cally similar to a given instance, and improving
F1 by 0.16.

Reinforcement learning RL has been used for
many NLP tasks, including coreference resolution
(Clark and Manning, 2016) and relation extraction
(Zeng et al., 2018). Clark and Manning (2016)
use RL to improve coreference resolution by op-

timizing their mention ranking model and directly
use the standard evaluation metrics as the rewards.
We, on the other hand, perform end-to-end op-
timization by rewarding the model’s consistency
with real world knowledge using relation extrac-
tion. To our knowledge, we are the first to use
consistency with world knowledge as a reward for
tasks other than knowledge base construction.8

Knowledge bases Knowledge bases have been
leveraged across multiple tasks across NLP (Bor-
des et al., 2011; Chang et al., 2014; Lin et al.,
2015; Toutanova et al., 2015; Yang and Mitchell,
2017). Specifically for coreference resolution,
Prokofyev et al. (2015) implement a resolver that
ensures semantic relatedness of resulting corefer-
ence clusters by leveraging Semantic Web anno-
tations. Their work incorporates knowledge graph
information only in the final stage of the resolver’s
pipeline, and not during training. In contrast,
our work augments information from the knowl-
edge base directly into the training pipeline. Also,
they use DBpedia (Auer et al., 2007) as the on-
tology. Although both Wikidata and DBpedia are
designed to support working with Wikipedia ar-
ticles, DBpedia can be considered as a subset of
Wikidata as Wikipedia infoboxes are its main data
source. The advantage of Wikidata over DBpedia
is its size, and the fact that it is multilingual, which
will allow applying our method to other languages
in the future.

8Mao et al. (2018), for example, use reinforcement
learning with consistency-like reward to induce lexical tax-
onomies.

7 Conclusion

We presented an architecture for adapting corefer-
ence resolvers by rewarding them for being consis-
tent with world knowledge. Using simple multi-
task reinforcement learning and a knowledge ex-
traction pipeline, we achieved improvements over
the state of the art across two datasets. We believe
this is an important first step in exploring the use-
fulness of knowledge bases in the context of coref-
erence resolution and other discourse-level phe-
nomena. In this area, manually annotated data is
particularly expensive, and we believe leveraging
knowledge bases will eventually reduce the need
for manual annotation.
