Abstract 

In gender classification, labeled data is often limited while unlabeled data is ample. This motivates 

semi-supervised learning for gender classification to improve the performance by exploring the 

knowledge in both labeled and unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised approach to 

gender classification by leveraging textual features and a specific kind of indirect links among the users 

which we call “same-interest” links. Specifically, we propose a factor graph, namely Textual and Social 

Factor Graph (TSFG), to model both the textual and the “same-interest” link information.  Empirical 

studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach to semi-supervised gender classification. 

1 Introduction 

Gender classification is a fundamental task with regard to infer user’s gender from the user-generated 

data. Recently, this task is getting increasingly more attention in some prevailing research fields, such 

as social network analysis and natural language processing. Applications developed from gender 

classification have enormous commercial value in personalization, marketing and judicial 

investigation (Mukherjee and Liu, 2010; Burger et al., 2001; Volkova et al., 2013). 

In social media, conventional methods handle gender classification as a supervised learning 

problem over the past decade (Corney et al., 2002; Ciot et al., 2013). In supervised learning 

approaches, both user-generated textual and user social link features are verified to be effective for 

gender classification. For instance, in Figure 1, it is easy to infer User c to be a female through 

analyzing her saying “I'm gonna be a mom!! ” Meanwhile, it is also possible to infer User c is more 

likely to be a female through analyzing her social link since she follows a cosmetic-selling User 

“Dior”. 

Although supervised methods have achieved remarkable success for gender classification, their 

good performances always depend on a large amount of labeled data, which often need expensive 

labor costs and long production time. How to learn a classification model with low dependence on the 

large-scale labeled data becomes an important and challenging problem in gender classification. 

In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised learning approach to alleviate the above problem in 

supervised gender classification. Instead of using a large scale of labeled data, we exploit a small scale 

of labeled data and large amount of unlabeled data to train the model. Our semi-supervised approach 

employs both user-generated textual knowledge and user social link information. The basic motivation 

of our approach lies in the observation that social link information might be helpful to infer user 

gender. Specifically, we focus on the “following” link and think that two users who follow the same 

particular user could have the same gender. For instance, in Figure 1, User b, User c and User d 

follow the same user named Dior and they are thought to be indirectly linked. Once User b and User c 

are correctly classified to be female with textual features, User d is more likely to be female since she 

is indirectly linked to User b and User c.

Figure 1: An example of Text and concerns in social media 

Specifically, we propose a factor graph, namely Textual and Social Factor Graph (TSFG), to model 

both the textual and user social link information. Here, a social link between two users happens when 

the two users follow the same user. For instance, in Figure 1, User b and User c both follow the user 

named Dior. These two users are thought to be linked with an indirect link, called “same-interest” link. 

In our TSFG approach, both the textual features and social links are modeled as various factor 

functions and the learning task aims to maximize the joint probability of all these factor functions. 

Empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our TSFG approach to capture the inherent 

user social link. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to incorporate both the 

textual and social information in semi-supervised gender classification.  

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 overviews related work on gender 

classification. Section 3 introduces data collection and analysis. Section 4 describes our TSFG 

approach to gender classification. Section 5 presents the experimental results. Finally, Section 6 gives 

the conclusion and future work. 

2 Related Work 

In the last decade, gender classification has been studied in two main aspects: supervised learning and 

semi-supervised learning. 

As for supervised learning, gender classification has been extensively studied in several textual 

styles, such as Blog (Nowson and Oberlander, 2006; Peersman et al., 2011; Gianfortoni et al., 2011), 

E-mail (Mohanmad et al., 2011), YouTube (Filippova, 2012) and Micro-blog (Rao et al., 2010; Liu et 

al., 2013). These studies mainly focus on employing various kinds of textual features such as character, 

word, POS features and their n-gram features to train the classifier. More recently, some studies focus 

on some specific application scenarios on supervised gender classification, such as multi-lingual 

gender classification (Ciot et al., 2013; Alowibdi et al., 2013) and interactive gender classification (Li 

et al., 2015). 

As for semi-supervised learning, gender classification has been studied with much less previous 

studies. Ikeda et al. (2008) propose a semi-supervised approach to gender classification in blog. Their 

User (Dior)

User b User c User d

main idea is to utilize a sub-classifier to measure the relative similarity between two blogs so as to 

capture the classification knowledge in the unlabeled data. More recently, Burger et al. (2011) 

mention the importance of using unlabeled data and directly apply a self-training approach to perform 

semi-supervised learning for gender classification. Wang et al. (2015) employ both non-interactive 

and interactive texts as two different views in their co-training approach for semi-supervised gender 

classification. 

Unlike the studies above, our study focuses on both textual features and social links for semi-

supervised gender classification.  

3 Data Collection and Analysis 

The data is collected from Sina Micro-blog2, the most famous Micro-blogging platform in China. In 

this platform, local users publish short messages and are allowed to follow other users to listen to their 

messages. From the website, we crawl each user’s homepage which contains the user information (e.g. 

Name, gender, and, verified type), messages and following users. The data collection process starts 

from some randomly selected users, and then iteratively gets the data of their followers and followings. 

We remove some unsuitable users that meet one of the following two conditions: (1) verified 

organizational users that are verified as organization; (2) the non-active users that have less than 50 

followers or 50 followings.  

In total, we obtain about 10000 user homepages, from which we randomly select a balanced data set 

containing 1000 male and 1000 female users. Let ( )iFo u  denotes the set of iu ’s all “following” users; 

maleF  denotes the set of all male users’ “following” users; femaleF denotes the set of all female users’ 

“following” users. maleF  and femaleF  can be calculated as following: 

 ( )
i male

male i

u S

F Fo u


                                                                  (1)

Where maleS and femaleS denote the sets of male and female users respectively. 

Table 1 shows the statistics about the numbers of “following” users of all male and female users. 

From this table, we can see that there are many users who are only followed by male users or female 

users. Specifically, in our data set, 143389 users are followed by only male users and 119504 users are 

followed by only female users. Thus, these gender-sensitive followings are good clues to infer each 

user’s gender.

4 Textual and Social Factor Graph Model 

A factor graph consists of two layers of nodes, i.e., variable nodes and factor nodes, with links 

between them. The joint distribution over the whole set of variables can be factorized as a product of 

all factors.

4.1 Model Definition 

 
 

                                    (I) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

                                    (II)

Figure 2: An example for illustrating the user links where 

(I) shows the “following” links among all users;  
(II) shows the “same-interest” links among the four users;  
(III) shows the simplified four “same-interest” links among the four users. 

 

Formally, let  ,G V E represent an instance network, where V denotes a set of the involved users 

in our data set. E V V   is a set of relationships between users. Specifically, if a user iu  and a user 

ju  have the same following (i.e., the same-interest link), there is an edge ,ij ije e E , linking the two 

users iu and ju .  

The “following” link: If a user iu follows another user ju , there is a “following” link between iu and 

ju . For instance, Figure 2(I) shows an example where four users, namely User a, User b, User c, and 

User d, are in our data set and each of them follows User A. Thus there are four “following” links 

among these five users. 

The “same-interest” link: If a user iu  and a user ju follows the same user, there is a “same-interest” 

link between iu  and ju . For instance, Figure 2(II) shows six “same-interest” links among the four 

users, i.e., User a, User b, User c, and User d. The “same-interest” links derived from “following” 

links as showed in Figure 2(I).  

Suppose that there are N users who have the same interest, the number of the same-interest links is 
2

NC  . However, when N is large, the number of the links is too large, which might make our factor 

graph model difficult to learn. Therefore, we simplify the link model by deleting 
2 ( 1)NC N   links, 

only reserving a link line containing N-1 links, as shown in Figure 2(III).  

We model the above network with a factor graph and our objective is to infer the gender categories 

of instances by learning the following joint distribution: 

      , ,i i k i i

Where two kinds of factor functions are used. 

1) Textual feature factor function:  ,i if X y  denotes the traditional textual feature factor functions 

associated with each text representation of the user iu , i.e., iX . The textual feature factor function is

Figure 3 gives an example of our textual and social factor graph (TSFG) where six users, i.e., User 

a, User b, User c, User d, User e, and User f, are involved. 

4.2 Model Learning 

Learning the DFG model is to estimate the best parameter configuration ({ },{ })    to maximize 

the log-likelihood objective function    logL P Y G  , i.e., 
                                                              * argmax L                                                 (6) 

In this study, we employ the gradient decent method to optimize the objective function. For 

example, we can write the gradient of each j with regard to the objective function:

Note that LBP denotes the Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP) algorithm which is applied to

It is worth noting that we need to perform the LBP process twice for each iteration: One is to 

estimate the original distribution of unlabeled instances which are denoted as ?iy   and the other is to 

estimate the marginal distribution over all pairs. In this way, the algorithm essentially leverage both 

the labeled data and unlabeled data to optimize the complete network. 

4.3 Model Prediction 

With the learned parameter configuration  , the prediction task is to find a 
*TY  which optimizes the 

objective function, i.e., 

 * argmax , ,T T L UY P Y Y G                                                          (8) 
Where 

*TY  are the labels of the instances in the testing data and 
L UY  are the labels (or estimated 

labels) of the instances in the labeled and unlabeled data.  

Again, we utilize LBP to calculate the marginal probability of each instance  , ,L UiP y Y G   and 
predict the label with the largest marginal probability. For all instances in the test data, the prediction 

indicated above is performed iteratively until converge. 

5 Experimentation 

We have systematically evaluated our TSFG approach to semi-supervised gender classification. 

5.1 Experimental Settings 

Data Setting: The data set contains 2000 users, as described in Section 3. From this data set, we select 

200 users as initial labeled data, 1400 users as unlabeled data, and the remaining 400 users as the test 

data. 

Features: Three types of textual features, including bag-of-words, f-measure, and POS pattern 

features, are adopted in our experiments. These features yield the state-of-the-art performance in 

gender classification (Mukherjee and Liu, 2010). To get word and POS features, we use the toolkit 

ICTCLAS3 to perform word segmentation and POS tagging on the Chinese text.

Classification Algorithm: For supervised learning, various of classification algorithms are 

available. As suggested by Li et al. (2015), we apply maximum entropy (ME) for supervised gender 

classification. Specifically, the ME algorithm is implemented with the Mallet Toolkit4. For semi-

supervised learning, we implement our TSFG approach, together with some baselines. 

Evaluation Measurement: The performances are evaluated using the standard precision, recall, 

and F-score in each gender category. For overall evaluation, we use macro-average F-score over both 

gender categories, which is denoted as Fmacro. 

Significance test: T-test is used to evaluate the significance of the performance difference between 

two approaches (Yang and Liu, 1999). 

5.2 Experimental Results  

For thorough comparison, several gender classification approaches are implemented including: 

 Baseline(Textual): employing ME classifier and textual features with only initial labeled data 
(without any unlabeled data). 

 Baseline(Textual+Social): employing ME classifier and both textual and social features with 
only initial labeled data (without any unlabeled data). Social features are extracted by 

considering each user ID of the followers of a user as a word. 

 Self-training(Textual): employing ME classifier and textual features with both labeled data 
and unlabeled data using self-training. 

 Self-training(Textual+Social): employing ME classifier and both textual and social features 
with both labeled data and unlabeled data using self-training. 

  Co-training(Textual): employing ME classifier and textual features with both labeled data 
and unlabeled data using co-training. We implement the co-training algorithm by randomly 

splitting the feature space into two disjoint feature subspaces as two views (Nigam and Ghani, 

2000). 

 Co-training(Textual+Social): employing ME classifier and both textual and social features 
with both labeled data and unlabeled data using co-training. We implement the co-training 

algorithm by randomly splitting the feature space into two disjoint feature subspaces as two 

views (Nigam and Ghani, 2000). 

 TSFG: our approach as described in Section 4. 

Table 2:  Performance comparison of different approaches to semi-supervised gender classification 

 

Table 2 shows the performance comparison of different approaches to gender classification. From 

this table, we can see that: 

(1) Social BOW features are helpful in both supervised and semi-supervised learning approaches.  
(2) Self-training fails to exploit unlabeled data to improve the performance and it performs even 

worse than the baseline approaches.

(3) Co-training is effective for semi-supervised gender classification when both textual and social 
features are employed. This result indicates that the use of social features in semi-supervised 

gender classification in co-training is beneficial, although the improvement is rather limited, 

about 1%. 

(4) Our approach TSFG performs best among all semi-supervised learning approaches. Moreover, 
the improvement over the two baselines is remarkable, 13% higher than Baseline(Textual) and 

8.9% higher than Baseline(Textual+Social). Significance test shows that our approach 

significantly outperforms co-training (p-value<0.01) 

Figure 5 shows the performances of our approach and the two baseline approaches when varying the 

sizes of the initial labeled data. From this figure, we can see that social features are always helpful for 

gender classification and Baseline(Textual+Social) consistently outperforms Baseline(Textual). Our 

approach fails to take effect when the size of the initial labeled data is too small (10 labeled instances 

in each category). When the size of the initial data is larger than 20 instances in each category, our 

TSFG approaches consistently performs much better than the two baseline approaches. Significance 

test shows that our TSFG approach significantly outperforms both Baseline(Textual) and 

Baseline(Textual+Social) when the size of the initial labeled instance is larger than 20 in each gender 

category (p-value<0.01). 

Figure 5: The performances of our approach and the two baseline approaches when varying the sizes 

of the initial labeled data. 

 

6 Conclusion 

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to semi-supervised gender classification in social media. In 

our approach, we first define a social link named “same-interest” link which models an indirect link 

between two users who follow the same user. Then, we propose a factor graph-based approach, 

namely Textual and Social Factor Graph (TSFG), where both the textual features and “same-interest” 

social links are modeled as various factor functions. Finally, we employ the graph to leverage both the 

labeled data and unlabeled data to optimize the complete network. Empirical studies show that our 

TSFG approach successfully exploits unlabeled data to improve the performance, remarkably 

outperforming other semi-supervised learning approaches. 

In our future work, we would like to improve our semi-supervised learning approach by leveraging 

some other kinds of link information. Furthermore, we will apply our TSFG approach to some other 

NLP tasks where both textual and social features are available, such as user age prediction (Rosenthal 

and McKeown, 2011) and user occupation classification (Preotiuc-Pietro et al., 2015).
