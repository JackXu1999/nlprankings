Abstract 

Personality, an essential foundation of human 

behavior is difficult to identify and classify 

from texts because of the scarcity of explicit 

textual clues. Several works were attempted 

for personality identification by employing 

well-known lexicons like WordNet, Senti-

WordNet, SenticNet etc. However, a lexicon 

solely devoted for identifying different types 

of personality is rare. Thus, in the present ar-

ticle, we have discussed the methodologies to 

develop a personality lexicon from the Essay 

dataset, a personality corpus based on Big 

Five model. We have used a frequency based 

N-gram approach to extract the unique words 

as well as phrases with respect to each of the 

Big Five personality classes. In addition to the 

words, we have added another feature, corpus 

based probability of occurrence into the lex-

icon. Finally, we have evaluated our lexicon 

on a small Youtube personality dataset and 

found satisfactory coverage. In addition, we 

have developed a LIWC based classification 

framework by employing several machine 

learning algorithms followed by feature selec-

tion using information gain and correlation 

techniques. SVM and Logistic Regression 

achieved the maximum accuracies of 78.52% 

and 62.26% with a reduced set of feature size 

15 and 10 selected by information gain and 

correlation attribute evaluation, respectively.  

1 Introduction 

Personality refers to the  individual differences in 

characteristic patterns of thinking, feeling and be-

having. Personality is considered as the most diffi-

cult human attribute to understand. Personality  

 

traits are traditionally measured through the use of 

questionnaires such as the Big Five Inventory 

(BFI) (Tett  and Rothstein ,1991). However, an 

alternative approach is to analyze an individual„s 

linguistic differences. Personality of a person is 

reflected in his behavior and speech which indi-

rectly affects the job performance, one‟s effective-

ness in work. Not only in jobs, there are so many 

other applications where we can use the advantage 

of personality identification including social net-

work analysis e.g., Twitter (Pratama  and Sarno, 

2015), Facebook (Golbeck and Turner ,2011) 

(Alam  Firoj and Ricardi, 2013) (Iacobelli Culotta, 

2013), recommendation systems (Golbeck and 

Turner, 2013), sentiment analysis/opinion mining, 

Author Profiling (Rangel Pardo and  Daele-

mans,2015 ), construction of emotion lexicon  ( 

B.G. Patra et al,2013)and many others. Personality 

is correlated with many other aspects of our daily 

life such as job success (R.P. Tett et al,1991), ma-

rital happiness (E.L. Kelly  et al, 1987) too. Now, 

the recent trend is automatic identification of per-

sonality from some text or audio or may be video 

also. We can identify personality from various sin-

gle modes (audio, video, texts etc.) as well as in 

multimodal way.  

However, due to scarcity of  proper audio 

dataset based on personality, we have started our 

experiment only on text dataset. We have used two 

standard text dataset, Essay (Pennebaker,et al. 

1999) and Youtube (J.I. Biel et al., 2013).  

Personality research is being nurtured as a 

developing field and only few works have been 

done till date. There are lexicons like SentiWord-

Net 3.0 (S. Baccianella et al, 2010), LIWC 

(Y.R.Tausczik et al, 2010) (F. Mairesse et al, 

362



 

2007), Senticnet 3.0 (Cambria et al, 2012) etc. 

which help in identifying personality. However, to 

the best of our knowledge, there is no open source 

lexicon that contains words/phrases of a particular 

type of personality. Thus, one of our prime motiva-

tions is to develop lexicons for each of the Big 

Five personality type, separately.  

In the present work, we have classified 

personality obtained from the written text based on 

the model of Big Five personality classes. The Big 

Five personality model is considered as a standard 

model for personality traits. This Big Five perso-

nality model has been used in many personality 

detection research works as they help in develop-

ing several applications.  

According to Big Five model, personality 

is assessed in five dimensions of OCEAN – 

a. Openness (inventive, curious) 

b. Conscientiousness (organized, efficient, sincere) 

c. Extroversion (energetic, sociable) 

d. Agreeableness (friendly, trustable and compas-

sionate)  

e. Neuroticism (apprehensive, sensible) 

  

 In the present work, we have developed 

a lexicon of words and phrases corresponding to 

each of the Big Five personality classes. However, 

we have restricted ourselves to find only those 

words that belong to only one particular class of 

personality and not in any other class. The ap-

proach used in this work is fully automated and no 

manual or human interaction has been carried out. 

The hypothesis considered is a two tier filtration 

strategy; first, we identified the distinct words of 

each personality class that do not belong to any 

other class by using the set disjoint operations. Us-

ing this approach, we have obtained four different 

sets of words and phrases corresponding to each of 

the Big Five personality classes. Thereafter, we 

have considered the intersection of four different 

set of words and phrases as previously obtained 

and formed a lexicon for each personality class. 

We have used a n-gram method where in case of 

unigrams, we have obtained unique set of words 

and in case of bigrams and tri-grams, we extracted 

a unique set of phrases. Finally, the probability of 

each word or phrase has been calculated in order to 

add the occurrence  probability information into 

the lexicon. In addition, we have explored the 

LIWC tool and developed a classification module 

for identifying and classifying the instances of both 

Essay dataset and Youtube personality dataset 

with a reduced set of features identified using in-

formation gain and correlation based techniques. 

The rest of paper is organized as follows. In Sec-

tion 2, we have discussed the related work ,in Sec-

tion 3 we have discussed about the dataset and 

preprocessing . Section 4 describes the lexicon de-

velopment whereas Section 5 describes the deve-

lopmental phases of LIWC based classification 

module. Finally, Section 6 mentions the observa 

tions and comparisons followed by conclusions 

and future work. 

2 Related Work 

Correlation between linguistic clues and personali-

ty traits have been identified to discover the way 

for carrying research in the area of automatic per-

sonality classification. We mainly focused on clas-

sifying personality traits based on text due to 

scarcity of multimodal dataset. To the best of our 

knowledge, the field be in its infancy. Though sev-

eral researchers have started their struggles in iden-

tifying personality from text by adopting various 

approaches, n-gram always has a huge impact in 

most of the cases (J.Oberlander et al, 2006). 

     We extracted linguistic features from essay da-

taset using a text analysis tool, Linguistic Inquiry 

and Word Count (LIWC), (F.Mairesse et al. 2007), 

(G.Sidorov2006). Several authors used the LIWC 

tool for identifying the impacts of different linguis-

tic features on different personalities as discussed 

in (Yla R.Tausczik et al, 2009), (F. Mairesse et al, 

2007). LIWC is a text analysis tool that counts and 

sorts words based on their psychological and lin-

guistic category. NRC is another lexicon that con-

tains more than 14000 distinct words annotated 

with 6 emotions like anger, fear, sadness, joy, dis-

gust and surprise along with two types of senti-

ments like positive and negative. The NRC lexicon 

has been used in other related work on personality 

where the authors explored the features of NRC 

and LIWC both ( Mohammad et al., 2013) (G. Far-

nadi et al, 2014). MRC is a psycholinguistic data-

base that contains psychological and distributional 

information of more than 150,00 words annotated 

with 14 features like phonemes (Nphon), syllables 

(Nsyl)( Coltheart, 1981) . 

    On the other hand, rough set based machine 

learning techniques have been used for personality 

identification (Gupta et.al 2013) whereas Naïve 

Bayes, KNN and SVM were also employed for 

363



 

personality identification on Twitter texts (B. Y. 

Pratama et al. , 2015). A few authors have also in-

vestigated the age and gender related information 

from formal texts (Burger, J.D, 2011). 

In contrast to such previous attempts, in the 

present work, we aimed to develop a personality 

lexicon of five different Big Five classes where the 

words even phrases are categorized according to 

the Big Five personality model. It has to be men-

tioned that one of our strict criteria that has been 

followed here is that no word or phrase of a partic-

ular personality class should mingle with words of 

other personality class.  The words are also asso-

ciated with their probability scores which make the 

lexicon useful for classifying personality from 

texts. Moreover, we have used information gain 

and co-relation techniques to conduct the feature 

ablation study for developing a personality clas-

sifier also.  

3 Dataset and Preprocessing 

In order to start with our experiments, we have 

used two text datasets. For developmental purpose, 

we have used the Essay dataset (Pennebaker, J. W., 

2007) and for testing the coverage and perfor-

mance evaluation purpose, we have used the You-

Tube dataset (J.I. Biel, 2013). Huge number of 

researchers used these two datasets to develop and 

test various personality detection models. Thus, we 

have considered these two as our gold standard 

datasets. 

3.1 Eassy Dataset 

Essay dataset (Pennebaker, J. W., 2007) is a large 

dataset that consists of 2468 text documents la-

beled with personality classes. The labeled perso-

nalities are based on the classes of Big Five 

personality traits. The classes are Openness (O), 

Conscientiousness(C), Extraversion (E), Agreea-

bleness (A) and Neuroticism (N). 

3.2 Youtube Dataset  

Youtube personality dataset (J.I. Biel, 2013) con-

sists of a collection of speech transcriptions, and 

personality impression scores of 404 YouTube us-

ers. These files are also tagged with the Big Five 

personality classes. Their speeches were tran-

scribed by professional annotators and the tran-

scriptions contains approximately 10K unique 

words and 250K word tokens. 

3.3. Preprocessing Text 

3.3.1. Labeling 

 

We have started our experiments by considering 

each and every personality class separately because 

we were trying to find out unique words or phrases 

with respect to each of the Big Five personality 

classes. For that very reason, at first, we consi-

dered only those files that belong to only one spe-

cific class. Each character of such a tuple of five 

represents each of the Big Five personality classes 

(e.g.Openness -Y, Conscientiousness -N, Extro-

version-N,Agreeableness-Y,Neuroticism-N) 

represents the instance belongs to Openness and 

Agreeableness). The basic steps of pre-processing 

are mentioned below.                                        

3.3.2. Lower case conversion 

Change the whole text into lower case so as to 

maintain consistency in our further approaches. 

3.3.3. Tokenizing 

Change each of the sentences into a collection of 

single words. 

3.3.4. Filtering 

We have eliminated the stop words and numbers 

because stop words are common words that have 

no meaning but are compulsory to maintain the 

grammatical structure of language (e.g., is, am 

are). At first, we find out the count, i.e. the number 

of texts that belong to only one specific personality 

class and then the total number of texts that belong 

to that specific class irrespective of whether the file 

belongs to other classes or not. Then, we count the 

total number of phrases and words for both these 

two types of classes and calculated the percentage 

of occurrence of phrases and words in one specific 

personality class. 

4 Lexicon Developing Module 

We assumed that the words people use in their dai-

ly life reveals important aspects of their social and 

psychological uniqueness. Our objective is to ex-

plore different methods to find out words that are 

commonly used by the people belonging to a par-

ticular personality class. Therefore, we designed 

the n-gram module to identify the words or phrases 

that distinguishingly classify an instance of that 

particular class. 

364



 

4.1 N-gram Module 

We developed a lexicon for different personality 

classes that contains not only unigrams but bi-

grams and trigrams also. The distinctions between 

linguistic styles and linguistic contents can be seen 

in how two people may make a simple request. 

E.g., “Would it be possible for you to give me a 

glass of water?” and “Give me a glass of water” 

both the sentences express the speaker‟s desire for 

water and direct the listener‟s action. However, the 

two utterances also reveal the speaker‟s personali-

ty. N-gram feature would help us to find the unique 

words of each and individual personality type. 

Thus, in order to find the unique words of each 

personality class, we carried out different levels of 

experiment. We try to find out those texts that be-

long to a specific personality class using Equation 

1. 

 

 

 

 

 

             

               

       Fig 1: Equation for  unique word count 

 

Consequently, the frequencies of those 

unique words have been estimated. It was observed 

that stop words do not help in detecting the perso-

nality. Thus, the stop words were removed for 

counting the unigrams only but, for bigrams and 

trigrams, the stop words were not removed as bi-

grams and trigrams were considered to be our po-

tential repositories of personality phrases. Initially, 

we estimated top 300 n-grams for each class. Then, 

using equation 1, we calculated the n-grams that 

belong to only that class. Next, the same process is 

repeated for obtaining top 500 and 1000 n-grams. 

Similarly, the unique words of other personality 

classes were also calculated. 

 

E.g., a few instances of the lexicon formed 

for each of the Big Five personality classes along 

with their frequencies are “strange” that occurs in 

openness class 18 times, “suppose” that occurs in 

agreeableness class 14 times. The bigram “really 

don’t” occurs in Neuroticism class 32 times. The 

trigram “I don’t know occurs” in Extrovert class 

40 times etc.

     #S3-Top 1000 n-grams      

      

    Fig 2:  N-gram counts 

 

4.2 Probability Calculation Module 

The lexicon for each of the Big Five personality 

classes has been prepared in our previous step. 

Next, we need to find the occurrence in terms of 

probability of each word based on Equation 2. 

 

 

𝑷𝒘 =
𝑻𝒖
𝒄

𝑪𝒘
                  (𝟐) 

𝒘𝒉𝒆𝒓𝒆 ,𝑷𝒘
= 𝑷𝒓𝒐𝒃𝒂𝒃𝒊𝒍𝒊𝒕𝒚 𝒐𝒇 𝒐𝒄𝒄𝒖𝒓𝒆𝒏𝒄𝒆 𝒐𝒇  
𝒂 𝒘𝒐𝒓𝒅 𝒊𝒏 𝒕𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒄𝒍𝒂𝒔𝒔  
𝑻𝒖
𝒄 = 𝑻𝒐𝒕𝒂𝒍 𝒏𝒖𝒎𝒃𝒆𝒓 𝒐𝒇 𝒖𝒏𝒊𝒒𝒖𝒆  

𝒖𝒏𝒊𝒈𝒓𝒂𝒎 𝒐𝒇 𝒕𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒄𝒍𝒂𝒔𝒔  
𝑪𝒘 = 𝑻𝒐𝒕𝒂𝒍 𝒐𝒄𝒄𝒖𝒓𝒆𝒏𝒄𝒆 𝒐𝒇 𝒕𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒘𝒐𝒓𝒅 

     Fig 3: Equation for counting n-gram probability 

 

    The range of probability is identified by the 

lowest and the highest probability scores obtained 

for each personality class. For example, if the word 

W1 occurs X times in a particular Big Five class 

say Z ,and the total number of unique unigram of Z 

class is Y, the occurrence probability of that word 

W1 is X/Y. The occurrence probability is also cal-

culated for both bigrams and trigrams. The proba-

bilities of unigrams are shown in Figure 3. 

 

    From our experiment, we observed that initially, 

we have started our experiment with top 300 n-

grams and as we are interested in finding only 

those words that belong to only that specific class, 

so we apply two tier filtering. However, in order

 Fig 4: The occurrence probability graph of uni-

to follow this technique, we achieved very less 

number of words and phrases. Thus, we contin-
ue our experiments with top 500 and 1000 n-

grams. While increasing the size, we observed that.

Fig 6: The occurrence probability graph of trigram 

 

we have obtained more number of words and 

phrases But, we get some words and phrases 

whose individual frequency is very less and thus 

their occurrence probability is also very less in that 

class. Therefore, we can conclude that the words 

do not have any influence in classification. 

 

4.3 Evaluation 

Now, we want to test it against on another dataset.  

For testing, the dataset used is YouTube Dataset. A 

simple algorithm for testing is defined in Figure 7. 

We have adopted a strict evaluation scheme such 

that each of the test documents should belong to 

only one personality class. We do not get satisfac-

tory result. Overall we get 35% accuracy. 

5  LIWC based Classification Module 

The advancements in the field of personality trait 

classification till could not answer the question that  

which features are most significant for personality 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

    

     Fig 7: Algorithm for testing Youtube dataset 

 

classification. Thus, initially, we have started with 

some basic approach to build a lexicon for Big 

Five personality class. However, we could not 

achieve satisfactory results and thereafter we use 

LIWC, a widely used text analysis tool to improve 

our result. 

5.1  LIWC 

 

Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, is a widely 

used text analysis tool to efficiently classify texts. 

We extracted 69 features of LIWC for each of the 

documents. Then, we tried to reduce the size of the 

feature set. The classifiers are then built on the re-

Step 1.   Split the text into sentences. 

Step 2.  Preprocess the dataset. 

Step 3.  Categorize each word of a sentence 

using Big Five personality lexicon 

Step 4.  A sentence is classified into one of the 

Big Five personality class based on the major-

ity class of the words of that sentence 

Step 5.  A file is classified into one of the Big 

Five personality classes based on the majority 

class of the sentences of that file.

duced set of features and the performances are 

compared with respect to a complete set of fea-

tures. This research aims to show that the useful-

ness of LIWC on personality identification and 

how different feature reduction techniques such as 

Information Gain, PCA can help in getting better 

result for classification. 

5.2 Feature Extraction 

LIWC was developed by Pennebaker et al., 2007. 

It is a text analysis tool that is employed to quanti-

fy features and allowed for text classification and 

prediction. LIWC is a dictionary that contains 80 

categories. For each file, we consider each word 

and search through the dictionary. If the target 

word is found in the dictionary, the category count 

of that word is incremented. Though the dictionary 

contains 80 features, we initially started with our 

experiment on 69 features. We count the number 

of anger, sad, pronoun, posemo (positive emotion 

word), negmo (negative emotion word) etc. Based 

on the method, each file of essay dataset was fed 

into the LIWC. The output file contains 69 features 

and each feature has one of the Big Five personali-

ty traits as the classification label. 

5.3 Classification 

 

In order to validate the feature set, a number of 

experiments have been performed to evaluate how 

accurate they are in predicting Big Five personality 

traits. A 10-fold cross validation was performed on 

our feature set to assess the accuracy. We tested a 

number of popular classification algorithms like 

Support Vector Machine (libSvm), SMO, Multi-

layer Perceptron and Simple Logistic Regression. 

5.4 Feature Selection 

 

The feature set is reduced by selecting a subset of 

original features. The removed features are not 

used in classification anymore. One of the aims of 

feature selection methods is to determine a subset 

of features for which the accuracy is maximized. 

5.4.1 Information Gain 

 

As we want to determine which attribute in a given 

set of training feature vectors is most useful we use 

information gain. Information gain tells us how 

important a given attribute of the feature vector is 

thus helps in reducing the feature set size while 

keeping the accuracy same. One of the most im-

portant contributions of this research is to deter-

mine the most important features among the 69 

LIWC features that can used for classifying the Big 

Five personality, keeping the accuracy same or 

making it better. 

By considering the top 10 LIWC features 

of Information Gain, the obtained result was not 

satisfactory. Then, on increasing the size of the 

LIWC feature set with 15 more features, the result 

was not improved. Finally with a LIWC feature set 

of size 20, the result is nearly the same when com-

pared to the result that is obtained with a LIWC 

feature set of size 69. Thus, in future, our aim will 

be to strengthen the feature set by extracting fea-

tures from other lexicons like MRC, NRC and oth-

er optimization techniques like PCA. 

 

5.4.2 Correlation Attribute Evaluation 

 

After extracting features using LIWC, we wanted 

to reduce the feature set size and that‟s why we 

apply Information Gain. Now, we use another fea-

ture reduction technique, Correlation Attribute that 

evaluates the worth of an attribute by measuring 

the correlation between it and the class. 

 

5.5 Result Analysis 

 

Initially, the experiment has been performed on 69 

features. We achieved better result on Libsvm on 

radial basis function kernel compared to Libsvm 

on polynomial  kernel. Next, we tried to reduce our 

feature set. We test our result using two feature 

reduction techniques, one is Information Gain and 

another is Correlation Attribute evaluation. We test 

our results in two dataset, one is Essay dataset and 

another one is Youtube dataset. In essay dataset, 

we obtained very good result (accuracy of 78%) 

and in Youtube dataset we achieved 56% accuracy. 

In Table 1 and Table 2, we give the details of re-

sult. 

 

5.5.1 Feature Level Analysis 

 

In this experiment, we have observed the influence 

of different LIWC features on classification. We 

have done our experiment with different variations 

of features and tried to analysis the Precession (P), 

367



 

Recall (R) and F-measure (F) to identify the impor-

tance of different features.  

From LIWC, we started our experiment with 69 

categories of words. Using Information Gain, when 

we ranked the attributes, we obtained top 10 fea-

tures  like home, we, job, inhib (inhibition), excl 

(exclusive) etc. which are very important impor-

tance of different features.  

From LIWC, we started our experiment 

with 69 categories of words. Using Information 

Gain, when we ranked the attributes, we obtained 

top 10 features  like home, we, job, inhib (inhibi-

tion), excl (exclusive) etc. which are very impor-

tant categories for classification. Then, when we 

increase the size, the categories like occup (occu-

pation), leisure, anger are added. Finally, when 

we considered top 20 features, we achieved the 

best classification result and some important fea-

tures like sad, negmo (negative emotions) which 

were added further. Thus, we can say that among 

69 features, these features have more importance 

than other features. 

Using correlation  attributes and when we 

rank the attribute under top 10 features, we get fea-

tures like smile, you, home, posfeel (positive feel-

ing)  etc. Then, increasing size, we obtained 

features like friends, time, school, eating etc. Fi-

nally, while considering top 20 features, we 

achieved the best result on some features like we, 

past, family, achieve, see etc. as mentioned in Ta-

ble 3 and Table 4. 

6 Observation and Conclusions 

A Personality Lexicon for Big Five Personality 

classes have been developed. The main objective is 

to find out some unique words that are mostly used 

by a particular type of personality. According to  

the design module, a lexicon with top 300, 500 and 

1000 n-grams has been obtained. Our observation 

says when we continue our experiment with top 

300 n-grams, the size of our lexicon is small and as 

we increase it to 500 n-grams and 1000 n-grams 

our lexicon size increases but it also contains 

words whose frequency in the text are very less.  

On the other hand, in case of calculating 

occurrence probability of individual word belong-

ing to a particular personality class, we observed 

some issues. When we take top 300 word, the oc-

currence probability is very high and as we take 

top 500 and 1000 n-grams, the occurrence proba-

bility decreases. As a result they do not help us 

much in classification.  Thus, we can conclude that 

When we take top 300 n-grams, we get best result. 
 

We developed our lexicon based on Essay 

dataset and tested it on YouTube dataset. As there 

is no topic related restriction on both dataset, the 

datasets contains diverse topics and that makes our 

job more difficult for personality identification and 

thus to develop a proper lexicon of a personality 

class becomes more difficult. 

 For development of lexicon, we already 

have discussed that we used two levels of filtering 

to eliminate all the words except a few which be-

longs to a particular class only. In order to main-

tain this process, we eliminate many words that 

may be important for us in classification. For ex-

ample, the frequency of word “Strange” occurs in 

Openness class is 239 times and in Extrovert 

class is 20 times as because we are interested to 

find only those words that belong to Openness 

class. We eliminate the word “Strange” from the 

lexicon of Openness. As frequency of the words 

“strange” is so high in open class, so it may be an 

important unigram for the Openness class. So, for 

better classification result, we have to apply some 

threshold value which can be a future prospective 

of thiswork. 

By using only n-gram approach we didn‟t 

get satisfactory result .Then we use LIWC for clas-

sification and we get very good result. Then we try 

to reduce the feature set by reducing the size of the 

feature set while keeping the accuracy same. We  

then use information gain optimization technique 

and reduce the size of the feature set from 69 to 20 

while keeping the accuracy same.
