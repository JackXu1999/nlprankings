Abstract 

This paper introduces our methodology for 
annotating variations in enunciative and modal 
commitment in a text. We first present the 
theoretical background of the study which puts 
the emphasis on the close interaction between 
time, aspect, modality and evidentiality 
(TAME) categories (and also markers). We 
then present our semantic resources which 
encompass not only lexical items, but also 
morphological inflections and syntactic 
constructions. We finally describe the first step 
of our global natural language processing 
(NLP) workflow which uses a syntactic 
analysis parser. 

 

1 Introduction 

Our paper concerns the design and development of 
lexical and grammatical resources for French in 
order to annotated textual segments in texts with 
regard to their modal and enunciative 
characteristics. The present study is part of a 
broader project (named ChronoLines1) which deals 
with the generation of innovative interfaces to 
display information according to temporal criteria 
from newswire texts in French provided by the 
Agence France Presse (AFP). The main goal of 
this project is closely related to applications such 
as the construction of timelines from texts (e.g. 
Alonso and al. 2009); its originality, however, 
compared to current timelines, is that we aim to 
take explicitly into account the problem of 
different levels of temporal referencing. These

Research Agency (ANR-10-CORD-010). http://chronolines.fr/ 

levels are associated with the different strategies to 
manage enunciative and modal expression which 
can be identified within the texts. Along similar 
lines to the annotation of “attributions” and 
“private states” (Wilson and Wiebe, 2005) or the 
calculation of “factuality degrees of events” (Sauri 
and Pustejovsky, 2012), we aim to take into 
account the fact that, independently of their 
calendar anchoring, situations can be presented as 
certain, fully accomplished, or only 
possible/probable, by an enunciator who can be the 
author of the text but who can also be another 
enunciator (explicitly named or not) from whom 
the author reports some content that he has heard, 
read, imagined. ... It should be noted that around 
90% of newswire text sentences contain at least 
one clue of an epistemic modal and/or enunciative 
shift.  
In section 2, we present the theoretical background 
of the study. Section 3 details our methodology for 
detecting variations in enunciative and modal 
commitment in a text (via the detection of certain 
lexical and grammatical cues, including certain 
kinds of syntactic constructions) and then 
identifying embedded textual segments which 
correspond to these shifts/variations (thanks to a 
syntactic parser analysis). Section 4 describes the 
first step of our global natural language processing 
(NLP) methodology.  
 

2 Theoretical background: modality 
meaning and TAME categories 

The notion of modality, which is closely linked to 
the notion of evidentiality2, has been studied from 
                                                           
2 This notion is implied when a new source of information is 
introduced in the discourse (reported, hearsay, inferred,…). 



many different perspectives: logic, philosophy and 
linguistics - see for example (Bybee and al., 1994; 
Palmer, 2001; Nuyts, 2006). In the field of 
linguistics, modality can be considered from an 
enunciative perspective - see (Bally, 1935; 
Benveniste, 1966; Culioli, 1973). From this 
perspective, which is the one we adopt here, the 
construction of an utterance (or a text) has to take 
into account certain language operations such as 
predication, discourse operations and operations of 
commitment3, the expression of which leaves a 
certain number of surface linguistic traces (or 
clues). The enunciator’s degree of commitment to 
a predicative content introduces variations in 
aspect, time and modality and also what is called 
enunciative modalities, all marked in the utterance 
by traces that the enunciator leaves in the discourse. 
In the case of direct speech, these traces can 
manifest themselves in the introductory portion of 
the direct reported speech in different forms: they 
may indicate the enunciator’s stance towards what 
is reported, describe the speaker’s attitude towards 
what is being said (in general) or towards what the 
speaker himself is saying; or refer to the 
relationship between the speaker and the 
enunciator, etc. The linguistic act of reported 
speech permits the enunciator to indicate his/her 
commitment to what is said or written by another 
source. Thus, what is emphasized in an enunciative 
perspective is the intrinsic presence of the 
enunciator in every discourse production. This 
presence is mainly manifested via time, aspect, 
modal and/or evidential traces. These four kinds of 
linguistic traces refer to four kinds of intrinsically 
linked semantic categories (see the well-known 
acronym TAME). When only the categories of 
modality and evidentiality are considered, it can be 
said that the enunciator expresses different degrees 
of commitment to the truth of the propositional 
content.  
At an analytical and descriptive level, which is 
essential in annotation tasks, and which is, 
moreover, sensitive to a specific language, several 
questions arise: 

• what kinds of linguistic markers (even if 
they are most of the time ambiguous) can 
be considered as prototypical for each of 

                                                           
3 The term of commitment is a close counterpart to the French 
term “prise en charge” – see (De Brabanter and Dendale, 
2008). 

the TAME categories (let’s see for 
example “modal verbs” (as must, …), 
“hedging adverbs” (as probably), 
“reported speech verbs” (as to say or to 
tell), …)? 

• how can markers that encode semantic 
instructions belonging to several TAME 
categories be handled? For example, 
certain tenses can play a role at all TAME 
levels - see for example (de Haan 1999, 
Hassler, 2010) 

• how can the four (cognitivo-linguistic ) 
operations that TAME categories refer to 
be ordered - see (Dik, 1997)? 

• how can a textual perspective of TAME 
categories be taken into account, that is to 
say how can these categories be explored 
beyond the syntactic level of utterances? 
This problem has been very rarely 
addressed in theoretical linguistics and in 
NLP approaches – see for example 
(Battistelli, 2011) 

• how should one deal with the problem of 
the interaction of different epistemic 
modality markers, at a sentence level – see 
(Sauri et Pustejovsky, 2012) - and at a 
textual level? Note that this question 
directly leads to the question of possibly 
different levels of predication. Let’s take 
the case of sentence level. One sentence 
frequently expresses more than one 
situation (predicative content) and each of 
the situations can be qualified with a 
different degree of certainty; 

• how can one deal with the problem, 
closely linked to the previous one, of the 
scope of modality markers, and therefore 
of the length of “modalised” textual 
segments?  

In order to analyze the highly complex interaction 
between the categories of modality and 
evidentiality, our methodology first focuses on 
detecting these “modalised” textual segments and 
on analyzing their hierarchical organization. This 
is what we choose to present in this paper.  
 
From our enunciative perspective, this leads us to 
take a look at the text in its enunciative and/or 



modal variations. Indeed, throughout a text (even 
within a single sentence), enunciative and modal 
values tend to vary. For example, encountering a 
reporting verb such as dire/to say, répondre/to 
answer, annonce/to announce, introduces a 
variation in the enunciative value but no variation 
in the modal value; an adverb such as sûrement/ 
probably, probablement/likely, introduces a 
variation in the modal value; a verb such as 
prétendre/to claim, croire/to believe, imaginer/to 
imagine, introduces a variation in both the modal 
and the enunciative value.  
In the next section, we detail the methodology 
developed to analyze these variations.  
 

3 Methodology for analyzing discursive 
heterogeneity by detecting E_M 
segments  

Any discourse (and by extension even a discourse 
comprising a single sentence) is necessarily 
presented from the viewpoint of a human cognizer 
(in our case, the journalist who writes the 
newswire). Thus, any discourse always has a 
default source who is its author. Moreover, as 
explained in the previous section, we consider 
modality from an enunciative perspective. Any 
newswire can then be considered as a textual 
segment having “default” enunciative (= ‘author’) 
and modal (= ‘true’, based on the Gricean maxim 
of quality which testifies that sources are 
trustworthy) values. Most of the time, in a text 
(even within a single sentence), textual segments 
which have different enunciative and modal values 
can be identified. This is due to the complex 
mechanisms of interaction between semantic clues 
that we outlined in section 2.  
Our methodology consists in focusing on the 
tracking on semantic clues which have to be taken 
into account in order to identify different 
enunciative and modal textual segments. This kind 
of approach to modal meaning focuses on 
discursive heterogeneity and also makes it possible 
to deal with the interaction between Modality and 
other related linguistic categories (Time, Aspect 
and Evidentiality). Furthermore, we believe that 
developing such an approach could - beyond the 
applicative interest in information retrieval (cf. 
ChronoLines already mentioned) - help to achieve 
a better understanding of this complex TAME 

interaction at a discursive level, i.e. at a level 
where pertinent textual units are not only sentences 
or utterances. In the remainder of the article, we 
will give just examples of sentences, but we wish 
to emphasize that our methodology also enables a 
discourse level analysis.  
We propose to set up a NLP workflow (see Fig. 1) 
that automates the annotation process of the text 
into textual segments that have enunciative and 
modal features. These textual segments will be 
called from now on E_M segments. In this 
workflow, we distinguish two main steps: 
Step 1: concerns the E_M splitter module which 
produces annotation of a text as a succession or 
imbrication of E_M segments. It uses semantic 
clues (organized in E_M semantic resources 
database) that lead to the opening of new E_M 
segments; it also uses a syntactic parser to 
calculate the length of an E_M segment at the 
sentence level; 
Step 1bis: aims at linking different sentences in a 
single E_M segment if they denote a homogeneous 
discourse unit;  
Step 2: the E_M value assigner determines the 
values of E_M segments. Semantic clues are again 
used insofar as some of them have an influence 
only on the enunciative value of an E_M segment, 
or only on its modal value, or on both its 
enunciative and modal value.  

 
Figure 1. NLP workflow for analyzing enunciative and 

modal discursive heterogeneity 

Figure 2 shows as embedded boxes the E_M 
segments (from ‘E_M_1_dft’ to ‘E_M_4’) that we 
want the final system to produce for the sentence 
in example 1. The involved semantic clues (from 
c=1 to 3) are highlighted.  

1. La Syrie a nié jeudi avoir fourni au Hezbollah 
libanais des missiles Scud capables d'atteindre 
l'ensemble du territoire israélien, accusant l'Etat 



hébreu de vouloir, avec de telles accusations, faire 
monter la tension au Proche-Orient. (Syria denied 
on Thursday having supplied the Lebanese 
Hezbollah with Scud missiles capable of reaching 
the whole territory of Israel, accusing the Hebrew 
State of seeking, through such charges, to heighten 
tension in the Middle East.) 

‘E_M_1_dft’ is the “default” segment. Over the 
text, every occurrence of a linguistic clue “opens” 
a new E_M segment. We will see later how we 
identify the length of each E_M segment 
depending on the different types of linguistic clues. 
For now, we can say that clue 1 a nié/denied opens 
segment ‘E_M_2’ and that clue 2 “accuser/to 
accuse” opens segment ’E_M_3’. Finally, clue3 
vouloir/seeking opens segment ‘E_M_4’. As can 
be seen, an E_M segment can follow another E_M 
segment (for example ‘E_M_3’ follows ‘E_M_2’) 
or be embedded in another E_M segment (for 
example ‘E_M_4’ is embedded in ‘E_M _3’).

In the next section, we detail Step1 and then focus 
on the building of semantic resources and the 
relevance of using a syntactic parser to identify 
E_M segments. Step1bis and Step2 will be dealt 
with in other papers. 

 

4 Using semantic resources and a 
syntactic parser analysis to detect E_M 
segments 

The identification of an E_M segment in the text 
is, as we have just seen, founded on the tracking of 
semantic clues that open a new segment. In other 
words, every variation in the enunciative and/or 
modal meaning introduces a new E_M segment. 
                                                           
4 Note that the purpose of this representation as interlocking 
boxes is to illustrate our methodology; the actual annotation is 
in XML. 

Section 4.1 describes the organization of semantic 
resources and illustrates them with some examples. 
Then in section 4.2 we explain how we use the 
syntactic analysis produced by the parser. 

4.1 Semantic resources 

Semantic clues that are able to open a new E_M 
segment can be (see Fig. 3): lexical items (verbs of 
propositional attitude, speech verbs, nouns, 
adverbs, etc.), morphological inflections (for 
example tense inflections like in French 
conditionnel and imparfait tenses5 ), or specific 
syntactic constructions (subordinate clauses of 
condition, prepositional constructions). All kinds 
of them are used during Step1 in order to detect 
and split E_M segments. Note that these resources 
are also organized in the database at a deeper level 
in order to be used during Step2 to calculate the 
precise E_M segments values.  
 

 
Figure 3. Organization of E_M semantic resources: at a 

surface level and at a deeper level 
 

Lexical items 

Lexical clues can be split into two groups: 
predicative clues and modifier clues. 

• Predicative clues: verbs and nouns 

A predicative clue introduces a new E_M segment 
which includes all the syntactic dependents of the 
predicate. These two categories of predicative 
clues involve a semantic variation: at the 
enunciative level (see example (2), where the clue 
dire/says introduces a new enunciative source for 
the E_M segment Jean viendra/Jean will come); or 
at both the enunciative and modal levels (see 
example (3) where the clue pense/thinks introduces 
both a new source and a modal variation). Example 
(4) illustrates the case of a sequence of several 
clues: clue1 a exprimé/expresses opens segment 
“E_M1” and influences only the modal validation 
context. Inside this segment, clue2 le souhait/a 

                                                           
5 See respectively (Kronning, 2002) and (De Mulder and 
Vetters, 2002). 



desire impacts on both the enunciative and the 
modal validation context of segment “E_M2”. 

2. [Paul ditclue que [Jean viendra]E_M]E_M_dft. ([Paul 
saysclue that [Jean will come] E_M]E_M_dft) 

3. [Paul penseclue que [Jean viendra]E_M]E_M_dft. ([Paul 
thinksclue that [Jean will come] E_M]E_M_dft) 

4. [M. Arabi a expriméclue1 [le souhaitclue2 [d’aider la 
Syrie à surmonter cette phase]E_M]E_M]E_M_dft ([Mr. 
Arabi expressedclue1 [a desireclue2 [to help Syria 
overcome this difficult.]E_M2]E_M]E_M_dft 1) 

• Modifier clues: adverbs and adjectives 

Unlike predicative clues, modifier clues do not 
open a new E_M segment, but will modify the 
value of the current E_M segment during Step2. 
Sentence (5) is an example of this phenomenon: 
the clue peut-être/may directly modifies the 
predicate viendra/come. The modal value of the 
whole segment is then impacted. 

5. [Jean viendra peut-êtreclue]E_M_dft. ([Jean may
 clue 

come]E_M_dft.) 

An adverb can also modify a verbal predicate 
which itself introduces an E_M segment. In this 
case, the adverb will not modify the value of the 
current E_M segment but the value of the 
E_M segment opened by the verbal predicate. 
Example (6) illustrates this case: clue2 
apparemment/apparently impacts on clue1 
dit/says. The value of the E_M segment will 
change at the enunciative level because of clue1, 
and at the modal level because of clue2. 

6. [Paul ditclue1 apparemmentclue2 que [Jean 
viendra]E_M]E_M_dft . ([Paul says

clue 1 apparentlyclue2 
that [Jean will come]E_M ]E_M_dft) 

• Building lexical resources 

The development of these lexical resources is 
based on the most frequent lexical items that occur 
in press AFP newswires. To find these most 
frequent items, we used a corpus of 20,000 texts 
(from the years 2010 and 2011). We then 
generated the frequency of the lemmatized corpus 
to find the most frequent lexical items. Our goal is 
to build resources that can cover at least 80% of 
the corpus. This coverage is reached with the 320 
most frequent verbs. From this list of 320 verbs, 
we manually sorted 140 verbs which introduce a 

modal and/or an enunciative variation. We used the 
same technique to build the list of 15 adverbs and 
the list of 10 adjectives. For predicative nouns, we 
had to use another method because the number of 
nouns was too high and we also wanted to keep 
only predicative nouns. To solve this issue, we 
used Verbaction 6  which is a lexicon of nouns 
morphologically related to verbs. For each of our 
140 verbs, we searched whether a related noun 
existed in Verbaction (this task has been 
automated). We obtained a list of nouns which can 
potentially be clues but the results then had to be 
manually filtered as some items were irrelevant for 
our work. For example Verbaction gives two 
predicative nouns coming from the verb 
accepter/to accept: acceptation/acceptance and 
acception/acceptation, and we decided to keep 
only the first noun (acceptation/acceptance). After 
this filtering process, the list of predicative nouns 
comprised 80 items. Let’s mention we are 
currently still exploring additional resources, in 
particular by integrating syntactic and semantic 
information about verbs from (Hadouche and 
Lapalme, 2010).  
 

Morphological inflections  

Several morphological inflections in French form 
another type of clue implied in the opening of a 
new E_M segment; for example, the French 
conditional tense, which has the morphological 
inflection (-rais, -rais,-rait,-rions,-riez,-raient). 
This tense is prototypical of French journalistic 
practice. It introduces uncertainty about the source 
of the information and/or about the epistemic 
modal status of the information.  

In example (7), the verb form aurait 
annoncé/would have announced7  is composed of 
two clues. The clue annoncé/announced introduces 
a new enunciative source ‘Jean’ (distinct from the 
journalist source). The other clue is the 
morphological inflection “-rait”. This morpheme is 
interpreted as a trace of the journalist’s lack of 
commitment: the hearer/reader interprets this trace 
as an ambiguity marker concerning the true source 
of information (is it ’Jean’ or someone else who

7 The verb form ‘would have + verb’ is the literal translation 
of the French pattern. A correct translation would be Jean is 
said to have announced. 



announced…?) and/or the modal status of the E_M 
segment le départ de Paul/Paul’s departure.  

The ambiguity about the origin of the uncertainty 
(which can be enunciative and/or modal) implied 
by the use of the French conditionnel tense comes 
across particularly clearly when we look at the 
possible translations of the sentence in English. 
The translation we have chosen (Jean is said to 
have announced Paul’s departure ) shows that the 
ambiguity concerns the source and not the 
epistemic value of le départ de Paul/Paul’s 
departure. However, this interpretation really 
depends on the context and it is often difficult in 
French to decide which of the two interpretations is 
intended. We will therefore simply consider that 
the French conditionnel tense leads to the opening 
of a new E_M segment, with indetermination 
concerning the origin of the journalist’s lack of 
commitment. 

7. [Jean auraitclue1 annoncéclue2 [le départ de 
Paul.]E_M]E_M_dft ([Jean is said

clue1 to have 
announcedclue2 [Paul's departure.]E_M]E_M_dft ) 

 Syntactic constructions 

The third class of clues contains syntactic 
constructions which are able to open E_M 
segments. 

• Subordinate clauses of condition 

A subordinate clause of condition indicates in 
which conditions the propositional content of the 
main clause is realized. The main clause is 
therefore considered as an E_M segment and the 
subordinate clause as a semantic (modal) clue. In 
example (8), the subordinate clause si Paul 
n’accepte pas/if Paul does not accept acts as a clue 
opening the E_M segment associated to the main 
clause. Example (9) shows a similar case with a 
subordinate clause introduced by the conjunction à 
condition de/on condition that. 

8. [ [Marie a refusé de donner son accord]E_M si Paul 
n'accepte pasclue1]E_M_dft.( [ [Mary refused to give 
her approval]E_M if Paul does not accept

clue1 ]E_M_dft) 

9. [ [Marie acceptera]E_M à condition que Paul 
vienneclue1]E_M_dft ([ [Marie will accept]E_M on 
condition that Paul comes clue1]E_M_dft 

 

• The prepositional constructions  

A prepositional construction such as selon 
X /according to X can also be considered as a 
semantic (enunciative) clue. Placed or not at the 
beginning of a sentence, this kind of expression 
introduces a new source and thus opens a new 
E_M segment, as illustrated in example (10). 
Another propositional construction such as à 
première vue/at the first sight can be considered as 
a semantic (enunciative and/or modal) clue. 

10. [Selon Paulclue1, [Jules vient]E_M ]E_M_dft ([According 
to Paulclue1, [Jules is coming]E_M) ]E_M_dft 

11. [A première vueclue1, [Marie a raison ]E_M]E_M_dft 
([At first sight, [Marie is right ]E_M]E_M_dft) 

 

4.2 Using syntactic parser analysis to detect 
E_M segments boundaries 

A semantic (modal and/or enunciative) clue is 
linked to an E_M segment: either the semantic clue 
opens a new E_M segment or it modifies the 
(modal and/or enunciative) value of the current 
E_M segment. In this section, we address the issue 
of defining the boundaries of E_M segments, using 
a syntactic parser. We use a large-coverage 
syntactic parser for French, FRMG (FRench 
MetaGrammar) (De La Clergerie et al., 2009). The 
main syntactic contexts in which semantic clues 
can occur are as follows:  

• clausal complements (Paul dit que…/Paul 
says that…) 

• adverbial clause modifiers (Paul viendra 
s’il ne pleut pas/Paul will come if it is not 
raining) 

• constructions with subject inversion 
(“Marie va venir”, a dit Paul/“Marie will 
come”, said Paul) 

• direct and indirect objects (Paul a 
demandé l’intervention de la police/Paul 
asked the police to intervene) 

• verb modifiers (Il est venu mardi/He came 
on Tuesday). 

• noun complements (Ceci est le souhait de 
ces pays d'être impliqués/This is the wish 
of these countries to be involved) 



• relative clauses (Il a exprimé l'espoir que 
la guerre finisse/He expressed the hope 
that the war would end) 

From the observation of all these kinds of contexts, 
we have developed the general rule RULE_G1 
which makes it possible to delimit an E_M 
segment: if a new E_M segment has been opened 
due to the presence of one predicative clue, then all 
the complements of this predicative clue except its 
modifiers 8  (e.g. temporal modifiers, purpose 
clause modifiers, etc.) are part of this new E_M 
segment. Furthermore, since any text (taken as a 
whole) is considered as an E_M segment having 
“default” enunciative and modal features, the text 
is always associated to E_M_1_dft and this 
constitutes the second general rule RULE_G2.  
To illustrate the application of these two general 
rules, let’s return to the example of sentence (1) 
given above. Figure 2 illustrates both the syntactic 
relations produced by the parser (shown by arrows) 
and the semantic clues implied in the analysis 
(shown in dotted lines). The dotted boxes delimit 
the E_M segments we want the system to detect.  
 
In the case of figure 2, the text comprises a single 
sentence, and is thus associated to E_M_1_dft 
(RULE_G2). The semantic clue1 a nié/denied 
marks the opening of a new segment named 
E_M_2. The length of this segment depends on 
syntactic information coming from the parser. 
According to RULE_G1, this segment is composed 
of the clausal complement avoir fourni au 
Hezbollah libanais des missiles Scud capables 
d'atteindre l'ensemble du territoire israélien / 
having supplied the Lebanese Hezbollah with Scud 
missiles capable of reaching the whole territory of 
Israel, and does not include the temporal modifier 
jeudi/Thursday nor the modifier clause accusant 
l’Etat hébreu (…)/accusing the Hebrew State of 
(…). Those two components remain in the segment 
E_M_1_dft. 
Clue2 accusant de/accusing of marks the opening 
of a new segment E_M_3 which is composed of its 
complements (RULE_G1): the direct objet of the 
verb l’Etat hébreu/the Hebrew state and the clausal 
complement vouloir avec de telles accusations 
faire monter la tension au proche orient/seeking 

                                                           
8 We decided to consider that, by default, information coming 
from modifiers has to be allocated to the writer and thus 
constitutes a form of textual background. 

through such charges to heighten tension in the 
Middle East. Clue 3 is the verb vouloir/seeking. 
This clue marks the opening of a new segment 
E_M_4 which is, according to RULE_G1, 
composed of the direct object of the verb 
vouloir/seek, i.e. faire monter la tension au 
Proche-Orient/to heighten tension in the Middle 
East, but excludes the modifier avec de telles 
accusations/through such charges. 
The E_M segment splitting system we have started 
to develop (named E_M splitter) takes into account 
the two general rules described above. We are 
currently working on E_M value assigner module 
(see Fig. 1) which is dedicated to assign values to 
the E_M segments. This module uses the deeper 
level of semantic resources organization (see Fig. 
3), that is to say the distinction between intrinsic 
modal and/or enunciative meaning of clues. It uses 
also a heritage mechanism able to apprehend 
segment embedding (and thus the interaction 
between several clues).

5 Conclusion  

In this paper, we have focused on the different 
kinds of French resources that need to be involved 
in the annotation of textual segments according to - 
what is called in our enunciative theoretical 
background terminology - their enunciative and 
modal characteristics (hence the notion, and 
notation, of E_M segment). These two types of 
characteristics are involved both: 

• in an information retrieval purpose (when 
dealing with - or calculating - the factual 
status of situations described in a text, as 
for example in certain textual entailment 
applications, or when dealing with 
attributions and polarity, as for example in 
opinion or sentiment analysis 
applications); 

• and in a theoretical semantic purpose 
(when addressing the difficult matter of the 
shifting boundaries – either lexical or 
grammatical, and variously marked in 
different languages - between the notions 
of evidentiality and epistemic modality).  

Thus, in the methodology that we have proposed to 
explore modal meaning and its annotation, the 
precise E_M characteristics are deliberately not 
addressed in the first step, but only in the second 
step (cf. Step 2 in Fig. 1), when the task of 
delimiting textual segments has already been 
approached (cf. Step 1 in Fig. 1). As we have seen, 
the present paper focuses on the problem of 
splitting a text into textual segments, and it 
presents how we envisage combining E_M 
semantic resources and a dependency syntactic 
analysis parser results to achieve segmentation.  

We would like to point out that the way we build 
these semantic resources is quite original 
especially in an NLP perspective: firstly, because 
these resources encompass not only lexical items, 
but also morphological inflections and syntactic 
constructions (see section 4.1); secondly, because 
they aim to reflect some important theoretical 
investigations about the close interaction between 
TAME categories.
