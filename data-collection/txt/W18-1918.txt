When Will AI Exceed Human Performance? 
Evidence from AI Experts
• Abstract: “Researchers predict AI will outperform humans in many activities in the next 

ten years, such as translating languages (by 2024), writing high-school essays (by 2026), 
driving a truck (by 2027), working in retail (by 2031), writing a bestselling book (by 
2049), and working as a surgeon (by 2053).”1

• 352 of the 1634 researchers publishing at two major AI conferences in 2015 

• Estimate of “when AI will do this task better and cheaper than a team of human 
experts”:

• “Perform translation about as good as a human, who is fluent in both languages, but unskilled at 
translation for most types of text and for most popular languages.” 2

• What does this mean?

• What about about other kinds of translation (e.g., with skilled translators)?

What is Happening to MT?

• More improvements to machine 
translation, computer assisted 
translation, optical character recognition, 
and speech
• Deep learning and neural nets increasing 

accuracy
• Statistical and Rule-Based MT
• More translation memory
• More annotated data
• More current machine translation to use, 

including for pivots
• Many small improvements, including easier 

customization

• Market forces
• Drive for new markets
• Capitalize on Artificial Intelligence (AI) hype

• Better fluency in MT

• More machine translation and computer 
assisted translation options, including for 
dialects

• Somewhat better accuracy in many tools 
supporting MT (e.g., OCR)

• More need for localization
• More need for cultural input
• More interest in single-source authoring (and 

more need for guidance for customers)

• More marketing
• More need for good evaluation
• More need to help customers understand 

options for tools and humans

What does the MT Look Like?

• Often more accurate, including with specialized domains

• More specialization, due to ease of creation in Statistical MT (SMT) 
and Neural MT (NMT)

• Significantly more fluency although not always greater accuracy

• Some high-risk in NMT, including problems with:
• Negatives
• New text inserted
• Source text left out

• Sometimes higher cost for NMT due to hardware and data—thus not 
feasible for some languages and domains

Experiment by Sue Ellen Wright, October 2017

DeepL (Deep Learning/Linguee)

• No post editing

What is Happening to Tools?

• Probably little MT for 
• Tasks where there are needs for very low risk, high visibility, or extensive cultural 

context
• Languages & domains with little demand 

• In other areas, there is a need for translators to monitor the translations
• Less surface editing
• More checking for match with source text in content, completeness, and cultural 

context
• Use of tools to facilitate that checking

• Perhaps using predictive translation
• Using confidence measures (e.g., match with terminologies)
• Using quality assessment
• Perhaps marking which sections have been evaluated
• Perhaps also using automatic identification of different translation engines and translators
• More sophisticated tools to check for negation, completeness, and subject area

What is Happening to the Translator Workforce?

• Discussion at the ATA Conference centered around different kinds of 
translation requirements

• Different source documents and requirements result in different tasks for 
translators

• Some of these tasks may be different 
• Question raised by David Rumsey, ATA President, at the 2017 Translation and Interpreting 

Summit: 
• Are we recruiting and training translators for the kinds of translation they have done in the past or 

for the new kinds of translation they will be doing in the future?

• Increasing focus on
• Annotating data
• Evaluating MT output for completeness, accuracy, context
• Using tools and training others how to use tools
