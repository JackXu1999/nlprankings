Abstract

In this paper, we introduce NT2Lex, a novel
lexical resource for Dutch as a foreign lan-
guage (NT2) which includes frequency dis-
tributions of 17,743 words and expressions
attested in expert-written textbook texts and
readers graded along the scale of the Common
European Framework of Reference (CEFR).
In essence, the lexicon informs us about what
kind of vocabulary should be understood when
reading Dutch as a non-native reader at a par-
ticular proficiency level.

The main novelty of the resource with respect
to the previously developed CEFR-graded lex-
icons concerns the introduction of corpus-
based evidence for L2 word sense complexity
through the linkage to Open Dutch WordNet
(Postma et al., 2016). The resource thus con-
tains, on top of the lemmatised and part-of-
speech tagged lexical entries, a total of 11,999
unique word senses and 8,934 distinct synsets.

1 Introduction

In the recent years, a number of graded lexical re-
sources have been developed to further research
on first (L1) or second (L2) language complexity.
Such a graded lexicon can be defined as a lexical
database describing the graded frequency distribu-
tions of lexemes as they are attested in authentic
pedagogical material along the successive grade
levels of a particular language curriculum. The
graded lexicons that have been built on these learn-
ing scales therefore either specifically pertain to
the educational programme of (elementary) school
children (Lété et al., 2004) or to the curriculum of
foreign language learners (François et al., 2014).

As for the L2 language curriculum in particular,
one of the most widespread learning scales which
has been used to date is the Common European
Framework of Reference for Languages (Council
of Europe, 2001) or CEFR scale. The CEFR scale

is a general framework that aims to provide a com-
prehensive description of the types of (written or
spoken) discourse a learner at a particular profi-
ciency level1 should be able to understand or pro-
duce. Based on the CEFR scale and as part of the
CEFRLex2 project, a number of graded lexical re-
sources have been developed for French (FLELex,
François et al., 2014), Swedish (SVALex, François
et al., 2016; SweLLex, Volodina et al., 2016) and
English (EFLLex, Dürlich and François, 2018) as
a foreign language. These lexicons were compiled
from a corpus of L2 learning materials graded per
level of the CEFR scale. The materials either in-
clude reading activities in textbooks or simplified
readers (receptive graded lexicons; François et al.,
2014, 2016; Dürlich and François, 2018) or texts
written by learners (productive graded lexicons;
Volodina et al., 2016). As a result, they inform
us about what kind of vocabulary should be un-
derstood or produced when reading or writing in a
foreign language at a particular proficiency level.

The lexical resources cited above have also
found their purpose as components of NLP-driven
educational applications. Up to date, we have
seen some of the resources being integrated as fea-
tures of a complex word identification system for
French (Tack et al., 2016a,b), as components in
a readability-driven learning platform for Swedish
(Pilán et al., 2016a) or as part of an automated
essay grading system for Swedish as well (Pilán
et al., 2016b). It is therefore clear to say that the
scope of relevance of the graded lexical resources
goes well beyond their apparent usefulness to gain
didactic insights into the complexity of the L2 cur-
riculum.

1The CEFR scale includes six levels ranging from the ele-
mentary (A1/A2), to the intermediate (B1/B2) and advanced
(C1/C2) levels. See Council of Europe (2001) for more de-
tails on the specific learning objectives per level.

The principal aim of this paper is to augment the
CEFRLex project by introducing a novel graded
receptive lexicon for Dutch as a second or foreign
language (Nederlands tweede taal, NT2), viz. the
NT2Lex resource. Moreover, through the link-
age of NT2Lex to Open Dutch WordNet (ODWN)
(Postma et al., 2016), our additional objective is to
expand upon and to advance the current method-
ology by introducing the first lexicon with graded
frequency distributions for word senses.

The paper is structured as follows. The follow-
ing section (Section 2) presents a bird’s eye review
of the literature on L2 receptive vocabulary and on
the importance of measuring word sense complex-
ity. In the subsequent sections, we will describe
the revised methodology used to generate NT2Lex
(Section 3) and we will compare the resource to
the other CEFR-graded lexicons (Section 4). In
the last section (Section 5), we will analyse the
distribution of lexical entries in NT2Lex in light
of standard indices of lexical complexity.

2 Background

The construct of receptive vocabulary knowledge
has been an important factor when it comes to de-
termining successful reading comprehension in a
foreign language. We know that the input con-
veyed to foreign language learners through read-
ing or listening should be sufficiently comprehen-
sible not only for the message to be understood,
but also for subsequent implicit or incidental ac-
quisition to occur (Krashen, 1989). The notion of
breadth of vocabulary knowledge (or vocabulary
size) in particular plays an important role in pre-
dicting adequate comprehension of the L2 input.
For reading comprehension, we know that 98% of
the running words in the text should be known,
which amounts to a vocabulary size of 8,000 word
families (Laufer and Ravenhorst-Kalovski, 2010).
However, the extent of vocabulary size is also
heavily conditioned on the well-known variability
in the interlanguage. It is therefore vital to ob-
tain correct and relevant estimates of vocabulary
knowledge when defining the lexical adequacy of
a specific reading activity.

Various lexicon-based approaches have been
considered to estimate the vocabulary knowledge
that should be covered when learning or teaching
a foreign language.3 The first approach consists in

3For a more detailed overview on these lexicon-based ap-
proaches, we refer the reader to François et al. (2014).

measuring the vocabulary size based on frequency
bands attested in academic word lists drawn from
a reference corpus of the target language (Nation
and Waring, 1997). A second approach resides
in the use of L2-specific pedagogical vocabulary
lists, which can be either expert-written such as the
CEFR reference level descriptors (Marello, 2012;
Milton, 2010) or corpus-based such as the English
Vocabulary Profile (Capel, 2010, 2012). Finally,
the CEFRLex project proposes a third approach to
lexicon-driven evidence of vocabulary knowledge
through the use of graded and corpus-based recep-
tive lexicons (François et al., 2014).

An important aspect of vocabulary knowledge
that has mostly been overlooked in the lexicon-
based approaches concerns the distinction of word
senses. Yet, the importance of taking into account
form-meaning mappings has been well-evidenced
in L2 reading comprehension. Qian (1999), for in-
stance, hightlighted that in the interplay between
vocabulary size and reading comprehension, the
notion of depth of vocabulary knowledge also
plays a significant role. The essential requirements
for deep vocabulary knowledge include – besides
the surface-level (i.e. spelling and phonetics) and
morphological features – a thorough mastery of
the various semantic, collocational, discursive and
other contextual aspects of the word. Zooming in
on the first two aspects in particular, he observed
a significant addition of depth of vocabulary to ex-
plain the variability in comprehension scores.

The need to account for this semasiological
variation when estimating word difficulty can be
traced as far back as to Tharp (1939). Indeed,
Tharp highlighted the drawbacks of defining word
difficulty estimates by tallying the frequency of
occurrence of similar word forms that are inher-
ently polysemous. Subsequently, various studies
have sought to parameterise the extent of sema-
siological and onomasiological variation in text-
level readability assessment using polysemic, hy-
pernymic and other features based on WordNet
(Fellbaum, 1998), the most notable contribution
of which relates to Coh-Metrix (Graesser et al.,
2004). As for word-level readability assessment,
a number of studies on lexical simplification have
made advances in the ranking of the difficulty of
synonyms based on contextual factors (Jauhar and
Specia, 2012) or based on a lexical database of
synonyms ranked according to elementary grade
levels (Gala et al., 2013).

3 Methodology

In view of the need for estimating word sense com-
plexity in L2 learning addressed hereabove, we
developed a graded lexical resource for learners
of Dutch L2 which includes lexical entries linked
to Open Dutch WordNet (ODWN) (Postma et al.,
2016). The methodology for compiling a graded
lexical resource can be found in Lété et al. (2004);
François et al. (2014). Here, we will briefly sum-
marise the method of estimating graded lexical en-
tries, focusing on the particularities for Dutch.

3.1 Data

We used a 461,088-token corpus of CEFR-graded
readers and textbooks for Dutch as a foreign lan-
guage, ranging from the A1 to the C1 levels and
with a mixture of writings in Netherlandic and
Belgian Dutch (Table 1).

Preprocessing Typographical and language er-
rors as well as other idiosyncracies observed in the
OCR-ised texts were manually corrected. Tonic
diacritics commonly used to indicate stress in writ-
ten Dutch (e.g. veel/véél, ‘many’) were also man-
ually removed, excluding the mandatory diaere-
ses (e.g. efficiënt, ‘efficient’) and accents in loan
words (e.g. café, ‘pub’). All texts were lemma-
tised and part-of-speech tagged and multi-word
units were automatically identified with the Frog
tagger (van den Bosch et al., 2007).

The tagged texts were then fed to a word-sense
disambiguation (WSD) tool4. The tool is based
on a one-vs.-rest SVM classifier trained on the
DutchSemCor (Vossen et al., 2012) and includes a
dictionary of 92,617 lexemes and 117,225 senses,
of which 52,430 (45%) seem to be matched to
ODWN synsets. To increase the tool’s coverage
with ODWN, we also included all monosemous
ODWN entries which were not included in the
tool. In total, 76% of all distinct lexical units (ad-
jectives, adverbs, nouns and verbs) were disam-
biguated for word senses.

4The tool was created by Rubén Izquierdo and is available
on http://github.com/cltl/svm_wsd.

3.2 Definition of Lexical Entries

To define the list of lexical entries which make up
the resource, we proceeded to some extra correc-
tion, simplification and filtering of the previously
tagged and word-sense disambiguated texts.

Lemmata We first ruled out all non-
alphanumeric entries such as punctuation
marks, Arabic numerals, as well as non-standard
word forms and abbreviations commonly found
in Dutch chatspeak. We also simplified similar
alphanumeric numbers (e.g. 4de, 5de, ‘4th, 5th’)
as belonging to the same lexical entry [digit]de.

We then resolved some specificities of the
Dutch compounding system. On the one hand, we
decided to split a number of compounds with an
optional parenthesised stem. For a lemma such
as (studie)keuze (‘(study) choice’) for instance,
we counted the occurrence as two separate lex-
emes: keuze (‘choice’) and studiekeuze (‘study
choice’). On the other hand, we also resolved the
omission of shared stems in a number of coordi-
nated compounds (e.g. binnenland vs. binnen- en
buitenland, ‘home and abroad’).5

Parts of speech The Frog part-of-speech tagger
is based on the CGN (Corpus Gesproken Neder-
lands) tagset (Van Eynde, 2004). The CGN tagset
is quite extensive in that it counts over 320 tags
and thus accounts for a number of detailed lexical
and morphological features. However, we found
it irrelevant to keep all of these precise features in
the resource. We therefore decided to simplify the
tagset to a set of 37 tags (Table 2). Consequently,
all other special symbols not covered by the tagset
were filtered from the resource.

We should note that the multi-word units
detected by Frog tagger were not tagged
with a specific part of speech, but with
a “multi-tag” part of speech (e.g. door en
door, VZ(fin) VG(neven) VZ(fin), ‘through and
through’). For all of these multi-word units, we
also subsequently transposed each one of the indi-
vidual tags according to our simplified tagset.

Word senses Finally, all lexical entries which
were disambiguated for word senses were thus
supplemented with a tuple of ODWN sense and

5To this end, automatic compound splitting was per-
formed using the publicly available rule-based compound
splitter for Dutch (http://ilps.science.uva.nl/
resources/compound-splitter-nl/)

corresponding synset ids (e.g. lezen-v-1, eng-30-
00625119-v, ‘to read’). The synset ids include
either the WordNet 3.0 offset (eng-30) or the
ODWN 1.0 offset (odwn-10) otherwise. How-
ever, we should note that not all WordNet and
ODWN synsets included in Open Dutch WordNet
have a corresponding lexical entry. We therefore
completed those entries with their corresponding
sense number (e.g. overduidelijk, obvious.a.01) in
NLTK’s Open Multilingual WordNet (Bird et al.,
2009). Finally, in the absence of an ODWN equiv-
alent to DutchSemCor, we decided to keep the
original sense id obtained through WSD for the
sake of completeness and for future compatibility
(e.g. overbodig, d a-415574, ‘superfluous’).

3.3 Lexical Frequencies and Weighting

After having defined the set of lexical entries,
we computed their graded frequency distributions
across the five CEFR levels attested in the corpus.
The following statistics were computed for each
lexical entry and per each level.

Raw frequency The frequency Fentry,level is sim-
ply computed as the number of times the entry oc-
curs in the level, which amounts to summing up
the vector f of the entry’s frequencies of occur-
rence f in document i for all d documents in that
level (see Table 1 on the preceding page).

Fentry,level = ∑ f =
d
∑

i=1
fi (3.3.1)

Dispersion and adjusted frequencies The ex-
clusive use of raw frequencies to observe lexical
distributions has been subjected to much debate
in corpus linguistics and especially when applied
to mining corpora to futher L2 research. Indeed,
Gries (2008) previously stated that the extent of

written language proficiency in learner corpora ap-
pears to be closely linked to the scope of lexical
dispersion: the more dispersed the use of a word,
the better it is mastered.

For written language comprehension on the
other hand, we could also state that the extent of
lexical dispersion in readers and textbooks gives
us a better view on what kind of vocabulary is
subject to being well-understood at a particular
proficiency level. As a consequence, the lexi-
cal frequencies we want to use to gain insights
in non-native language comprehension should be
adjusted to take into account lexical dispersion
as well. The following dispersion (Dentry,level)
and adjusted frequency indices (Uentry,level and
SFIentry,level) were computed following Carroll
et al. (1971). In the following formulae, Nlevel de-
notes the number of words in the level and ni de-
notes the number of words in document i of all
documents d in that level.

4 Resource Description

We compiled two separate versions of NT2Lex.
A first version contains only the lemmatised and
part-of-speech tagged entries (NT2Lex-CGN)
and is thus similar to the other graded lexicons
previously developed in the CEFRLex project
(cf. supra). The word-sense disambiguated en-
tries, on the other hand, have been added to
a second version of the resource (NT2Lex-
CGN+ODWN) (see Table 3 for an example). A
comparative overview of the number of entries
in both versions of NT2Lex and in the other re-
sources can be found in Table 5 on page 6. A more
detailed description of the resource is given here-
inbelow and in the following section.

NT2Lex-CGN The first version of NT2lex
counts 15,227 entries. The total number of en-
tries in the resource is therefore similar to the re-
sources developed for English and Swedish, al-
though slightly lower than for French. Not surpris-
ingly, the majority of the entries contain lexical

words and the number of grammatical entries also
remains strongly comparable across all resources.

There is a striking difference however in the
number of multi-word entries that are included in
NT2Lex and in the other resources. Only 459 of
the entries are multi-word units, contrary to 2,038
for French and 1,450 for Swedish. The multi-word
units that are included in the resource mostly per-
tain to well-known named entities (e.g. Olympis-
che Spelen, ‘Olympic Games’) and other phrasal
verbs (e.g. voorzien van, ‘to provide’), adverbs
(e.g. om het even, ‘all the same’), etc.

This difference could be explained by the fact
that the majority of the compound words which
are multi-word units in other languages (such as
in French or English) are one-word units or ag-
glutinative compounds in Dutch (e.g. afvalverwi-
jderingsstructuur, ‘waste disposal structure’). We
observe that 4,431 (31%) of the single-word en-
tries in NT2Lex are in fact compounds. As for the
Swedish language, where the compounding sys-
tem is similar to Dutch, we could attribute this dis-
parity to the fact that different taggers were used to
detect multi-word units. Indeed, the recall and pre-
cision of multi-word identification depend heavily
on the assumptions made by the tagger to resolve
the sequential ambiguity, contrary to the aggluti-
native compounds, which do not need to be dis-
ambiguated in this case.

NT2Lex-CGN+ODWN The word-sense disam-
biguated version of NT2Lex counts 17,743 en-
tries in all, with an extra 2,516 lexical entries and
with 1,454 polysemous entries (with at least two
senses). Table 4 shows the distribution of pol-
ysemous entries across all levels. Although all
of these polysemous entries are lexical ones, we
should note that some multi-word entries have also
been disambiguated for word senses, but none of
them are polysemous. The most polysemous entry
in the resource is the entry pakken (verb, ‘to take
/ grab / defeat / hinder / etc.’) which has a total of
10 different senses attested in the resource.

We observe that the resource includes a high vari-

11,999 word senses.

Online query and annotation tools Both ver-
sions of the resource will be made available for
non-commercial use in the CEFRLex project.6

Similar to the previous resources, a number of
online tools will be made available for teachers
and/or researchers to query the lexical database
and to annotate a text using NT2Lex (Figure 1).

5 Analysis

In the next sections, we will compare the distri-
bution of lexical entries in NT2Lex in light of a
number of standard indices of lexical complex-
ity. We will only report statistics for the most
complete version of our resource, i.e. NT2Lex-
CGN+ODWN.

5.1 Frequency Effects

As a first means of analysis, we aim to examine
the coherence of the frequency distributions in the
resource with respect to the word frequency effect
in second language processing, which states that
words that are more frequent and more familiar are
more easily processed by a learner (Ellis, 2002).

Lexical frequency To compare the frequency
distributions in the resource, we use the stan-
dard frequency index (SFI, Formula 3.3.4), which
might be best suited to measure the desired effects:
a value of 100, 90, 80, ..., 40 on the standard scale
indicates that the entry respectively occurs once
every 100, 101, 102, ..., 106 entries, and so forth.

distributions with Subtlex-NL (Keuleers et al.,

2010), we observe a positive value for the Pearson
correlation coefficient (r = .69, p < .0017; Fig-
ure 2a). This shows us that even though the ad-
justed frequencies were estimated on a relatively
small corpus, they are still very much coherent
with the frequencies estimated for the same entries
on a reference corpus. Moreover, Figure 2b also
illustrates that the average of Subtlex-NL frequen-
cies also decreases per level, with the exception of
the C1 level. A possible reason for this is that the
C1 subcorpus is the most restricted in size due to
the limited availability of C1-level readers.

Dispersion and word familiarity Because of
lacking experimental data on actual word familiar-
ity in Dutch L2, we make a simplifying assump-
tion here and use our dispersion metric as a mea-
sure of theoretical word familiarity: the more the
word is dispersed across the L2 documents, the
more familiar it should be to a learner in general.

We observe from Figure 3 that this theoretical
word familiarity accounts for about 83% in the
distribution of the adjusted frequencies. In this
respect, we also observe an interesting split in

7For reasons of comparability with Subtlex, which does
not include frequencies for word senses, we report the corre-
lation coefficient for the non-WSD version of the resource.

the normalised frequency distribution which orig-
inates from the way the adjusted frequencies were
computed (U ; Formula 3.3.3). When D > 0, the
influence of the raw frequency F increases be-
tween 40 < SFI < 100. Conversely, when D = 0,
the raw frequencies are not taken into account, but
are drawn from a weigthed (Gaussian) frequency
distribution (0 < SFI < 40) instead.

Zipfian effects From these associations between
dispersion and standardised frequencies, we can
also observe a number of Zipfian effects. In-
deed, for all entries which have a non-zero disper-
sion (range 40 < SFI < 100), Zipf’s distribution
(Zipf, 1949) applies in the standard frequency in-
dex. Moreover, these frequencies are in turn nega-
tively correlated with word length: the shorter the
word, the more frequent (r =−.39; p < .001). We
take these results as a proof for the consistency of
the resource.

Lexical sophistication As a final note on the
issue of word frequency, we compare the lexi-
cal sophistication ratio of the entries with a ba-
sic word list8 of the 2,000 most frequent Dutch
words according to the Basiswoordenboek Neder-
lands (Kleijn and Nieuwberg, 1993).9 Figure 4a
shows that the more dispersed (and hence the more
familiar) the entry in the corpus, the least sophisti-
cated the entry is. Moreover, we also observe that
the proportion of sophisticated entries (i.e. that go
beyond the 2,000 most frequent words) increases
per level (Figure 4b), except for the C1 level where

fewer sophisticated words have been attested due
to the limitations highlighted earlier.

5.2 Semasio-onomasiological Indices
In addition to the word frequency effect of L2 vo-
cabulary learning, we also investigated the inter-
play of form-meaning mappings in the resource.

We observe on the one hand that the degree of
polysemy and synonymy attested in the resource
is strongly correlated to the degree of synonymy
and polysemy that is expected in the Open Dutch
WordNet (ODWN) (Figure 5). We can therefore
conclude that in addition to the correlation be-
tween the estimated frequencies and Subtlex-NL
(cf. supra), the word senses included in the re-
source are also consistent with the structure of a
general semantic network.

However, the lower extent of onomasiologi-
cal variation (i.e. meaning-to-form mappings) in
NT2Lex compared to ODWN synonymy (Fig-
ure 5b) might be indicative of the specialised na-
ture of the resource in that for a defined set of con-
cepts it includes a limited range of lexicalizations,
which are likely to be specific to the L2.

As for semasiological variation (i.e. form-to-
meaning mappings) in NT2Lex, we observe an in-
teresting decreasing trend in the degree of poly-
semy per level (Figure 5c). This highlights the fact
that the lexical stock of elementary L2 texts con-

tains more ambiguous entries, which in turn tend
to be more easily processed (Millis and Bution,
1989). However, no other significant effects in
terms of synonymy, polysemy or hypernymy were
observed.

5.3 Psycholinguistic Norms

Finally, to investigate the interplay of different
psycholinguistic norms in the resource, we use
a lexical database of age of acquisition and con-
creteness norms for Dutch (Brysbaert et al., 2014).
Figure 6 shows the distribution of the norms per
each attested level in the resource.

Age of acquisition We observe that the vast ma-
jority of the lexical stock in the elementary levels
(i.e A1/A2) contain words which are acquired the
earliest by native speakers as well, approximately
around the age of five, whereas the entries in the
intermediate levels (i.e. B1/B2) levels are acquired
later, approximately between ages 5 and 10. More-
over, the more concrete the word, the earlier it is
acquired (Figure 7a), which is consistent with pre-
vious observations (Crossley et al., 2009). The
earlier the word is acquired, the more familiar it
is according to its dispersion in the resource (Fig-
ure 7b). As for the C1 level, we observe a simi-
lar trend, except for a smaller proportion of entries
that are acquired earlier as well (with a higher con-
centration around the age of 5), which might also
explain the higher average of Subtlex frequencies
and the lower degree of sophistication attested at
this level (cf. supra).

Concreteness As regards word concreteness,
we observe on the one hand that the highest lev-
els (i.e. B2/C1) contain a considerably higher pro-
portion of abstract (less concrete) words. This
observation highlights the fact that, even though
the C1 level includes some outliers on the level of

lexical frequency and sophistication, the distribu-
tion of the concreteness norms at C1 are similar
to what is expected. The most basic levels, on the
other hand, contain a lower proportion of abstract
words, but the difference between the number of
concrete and abstract words appears to be propor-
tionally less clear-cut.

6 Conclusion

In this paper, we presented a new graded lexical
resource for Dutch as a foreign language (NT2)
based on the proficiency scale of the Common Eu-
ropean Framework of Reference (CEFR). Similar
to the previous CEFR-graded lexicons for French,
Swedish and English, the NT2Lex resource con-
tains graded frequency distributions per lexical en-
try which are estimated on L2 readers and text-
book texts targeting a specific level on the CEFR
scale. The novelty of the NT2Lex resource with
respect to the common methodology of generating
graded lexicons is concerned with the fact that the
lexical entries are disambiguated for word senses
and are also linked to WordNet synsets. We argued
that this linkage gives us a better insight into word
sense complexity in a foreign language.

We found that the estimated frequency and word
sense distributions are in line with what one ex-
pects to observe in the target language. More-
over, the distributions of lexical entries per level
in NT2Lex also appeared to be consistent with
previous findings in terms of lexical complex-
ity. As regards the features of lexical ambiguity,
age of acquisition and concreteness, we observed
that the lexical entries in the most basic levels of
the resource (i.e. A1/A2) are more polysemous
and acquired the earliest by non-native speakers,
whereas the lexical entries in the more advanced
levels (i.e. B2/C1) portray a significantly higher
degree of abstractness and are acquired at a later

144



developmental stage.
We could thus conclude that the resource en-

ables us to get a better grasp on what kind of vo-
cabulary should be understood a priori when read-
ing Dutch as a foreign language at a particular pro-
ficiency level. Of course, we should highlight that
the assumptions that can be drawn are still lim-
ited in the sense that they are mainly based on
expert knowledge drawn from pedagogical texts.
Indeed, we lack extensive experimental data on
what vocabulary is effectively understood when
reading Dutch at a particular proficiency level and
by a specific learner depending on his/her char-
acteristics (e.g. native language, age, experience,
etc.). As a future perspective, we therefore aim
to contrast the knowledge we gained through the
resource with this kind of receptive learner data.
