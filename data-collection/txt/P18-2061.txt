Abstract

Gender prediction has typically focused on
lexical and social network features, yield-
ing good performance, but making systems
highly language-, topic-, and platform-
dependent. Cross-lingual embeddings cir-
cumvent some of these limitations, but cap-
ture gender-specific style less. We propose
an alternative: bleaching text, i.e., trans-
forming lexical strings into more abstract
features. This study provides evidence
that such features allow for better transfer
across languages. Moreover, we present a
first study on the ability of humans to per-
form cross-lingual gender prediction. We
find that human predictive power proves
similar to that of our bleached models, and
both perform better than lexical models.

1 Introduction

Author profiling is the task of discovering latent
user attributes disclosed through text, such as gen-
der, age, personality, income, location and occu-
pation (Rao et al., 2010; Burger et al., 2011; Feng
et al., 2012; Jurgens, 2013; Bamman et al., 2014;
Plank and Hovy, 2015; Flekova et al., 2016). It is
of interest to several applications including person-
alized machine translation, forensics, and market-
ing (Mirkin et al., 2015; Rangel et al., 2015).

Early approaches to gender prediction (Kop-
pel et al., 2002; Schler et al., 2006, e.g.) are in-
spired by pioneering work on authorship attribu-
tion (Mosteller and Wallace, 1964). Such stylo-
metric models typically rely on carefully hand-
selected sets of content-independent features to
capture style beyond topic. Recently, open vocab-
ulary approaches (Schwartz et al., 2013), where
the entire linguistic production of an author is
used, yielded substantial performance gains in on-

line user-attribute prediction (Nguyen et al., 2014;
Preoţiuc-Pietro et al., 2015; Emmery et al., 2017).
Indeed, the best performing gender prediction mod-
els exploit chiefly lexical information (Rangel et al.,
2017; Basile et al., 2017).

Relying heavily on the lexicon though has its
limitations, as it results in models with limited
portability. Moreover, performance might be overly
optimistic due to topic bias (Sarawgi et al., 2011).
Recent work on cross-lingual author profiling has
proposed the use of solely language-independent
features (Ljubešić et al., 2017), e.g., specific tex-
tual elements (percentage of emojis, URLs, etc)
and users’ meta-data/network (number of followers,
etc), but this information is not always available.

We propose a novel approach where the actual
text is still used, but bleached out and transformed
into more abstract, and potentially better transfer-
able features. One could view this as a method in
between the open vocabulary strategy and the sty-
lometric approach. It has the advantage of fading
out content in favor of more shallow patterns still
based on the original text, without introducing ad-
ditional processing such as part-of-speech tagging.
In particular, we investigate to what extent gender
prediction can rely on generic non-lexical features
(RQ1), and how predictive such models are when
transferred to other languages (RQ2). We also
glean insights from human judgments, and inves-
tigate how well people can perform cross-lingual
gender prediction (RQ3). We focus on gender pre-
diction for Twitter, motivated by data availability.

Contributions In this work i) we are the first to
study cross-lingual gender prediction without re-
lying on users’ meta-data; ii) we propose a novel
simple abstract feature representation which is sur-
prisingly effective; and iii) we gauge human ability
to perform cross-lingual gender detection, an angle
of analysis which has not been studied thus far.

2 Profiling with Abstract Features

Can we recover the gender of an author from
bleached text, i.e., transformed text were the raw
lexical strings are converted into abstract features?
We investigate this question by building a series of
predictive models to infer the gender of a Twitter
user, in absence of additional user-specific meta-
data. Our approach can be seen as taking advantage
of elements from a data-driven open-vocabulary
approach, while trying to capture gender-specific
style in text beyond topic.

To represent utterances in a more language ag-
nostic way, we propose to simply transform the text
into alternative textual representations, which devi-
ate from the lexical form to allow for abstraction.
We propose the following transformations, exem-
plified in Table 1. They are mostly motivated by
intuition and inspired by prior work, like the use of
shape features from NER and parsing (Petrov and
Klein, 2007; Schnabel and Schütze, 2014; Plank
et al., 2016; Limsopatham and Collier, 2016):

• Frequency Each word is presented as its
binned frequency in the training data; bins
are sized by orders of magnitude.

• Length Number of characters (prefixed by 0
to avoid collision with the next transforma-
tion).

• PunctC Merges all consecutive alphanumeric
characters to one ‘W’ and leaves all other char-
acters as they are (C for conservative).

• PunctA Generalization of PunctC (A for ag-
gressive), converting different types of punc-
tuation to classes: emoticons1 to ‘E’ and emo-
jis2 to ‘J’, other punctuation to ‘P’.

• Shape Transforms uppercase characters to
‘U’, lowercase characters to ‘L’, digits to ‘D’
and all other characters to ‘X’. Repetitions

of transformed characters are condensed to a
maximum of 2 for greater generalization.

• Vowel-Consonant To approximate vowels,
while being able to generalize over (Indo-
European) languages, we convert any of the
‘aeiou’ characters to ‘V’, other alphabetic char-
acter to ‘C’, and all other characters to ‘O’.

• AllAbs A combination (concatenation) of all
previously described features.

3 Experiments

In order to test whether abstract features are ef-
fective and transfer across languages, we set up
experiments for gender prediction comparing lex-
icalized and bleached models for both in- and
cross-language experiments. We compare them
to a model using multilingual embeddings (Ruder,
2017). Finally, we elicit human judgments both
within language and across language. The latter is
to check whether a person with no prior knowledge
of (the lexicon of) a given language can predict
the gender of a user, and how that compares to an
in-language setup and the machine. If humans can
predict gender cross-lingually, they are likely to
rely on aspects beyond lexical information.

Data We obtain data from the TWISTY cor-
pus (Verhoeven et al., 2016), a multi-lingual col-
lection of Twitter users, for the languages with
500+ users, namely Dutch, French, Portuguese,
and Spanish. We complement them with English,
using data from a predecessor of TWISTY (Plank
and Hovy, 2015). All datasets contain manually
annotated gender information. To simplify interpre-
tation for the cross-language experiments, we bal-
ance gender in all datasets by downsampling to the
minority class. The datasets’ final sizes are given
in Table 2. We use 200 tweets per user, as done
by previous work (Verhoeven et al., 2016). We
leave the data untokenized to exclude any language-
dependent processing, because original tokeniza-
tion could preserve some signal. Apart from map-
ping usernames to ‘USER’ and urls to ‘URL’ we
do not perform any further data pre-processing.

3.1 Lexical vs Bleached Models
We use the scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al.,
2011) implementation of a linear SVM with de-
fault parameters (e.g., L2 regularization). We use
10-fold cross validation for all in-language experi-
ments. For the cross-lingual experiments, we train

on all available source language data and test on all
target language data.

For the lexicalized experiments, we adopt the
features from the best performing system at the lat-
est PAN evaluation campaign3 (Basile et al., 2017)
(word 1-2 grams and character 3-6 grams).

For the multilingual embeddings model we use
the mean embedding representation from the sys-
tem of (Plank, 2017) and add max, std and cover-
age features. We create multilingual embeddings
by projecting monolingual embeddings to a single
multilingual space for all five languages using a
recently proposed SVD-based projection method
with a pseudo-dictionary (Smith et al., 2017).
The monolingual embeddings are trained on large
amounts of in-house Twitter data (as much data as
we had access to, i.e., ranging from 30M tweets
for French to 1,500M tweets in Dutch, with a word
type coverage between 63 and 77%). This results in
an embedding space with a vocabulary size of 16M
word types. All code is available at https://
github.com/bplank/bleaching-text.

For the bleached experiments, we ran models
with each feature set separately. In this paper, we
report results for the model where all features are
combined, as it proved to be the most robust across
languages. We tuned the n-gram size of this model
through in-language cross-validation, finding that
n = 5 performs best.

When testing across languages, we report accu-
racy for two setups: average accuracy over each
single-language model (AVG), and accuracy ob-
tained when training on the concatenation of all
languages but the target one (ALL). The latter set-
ting is also used for the embeddings model. We
report accuracy for all experiments.

Results and Analysis Table 2 shows results for
both the cross-language and in-language experi-
ments in the lexical and abstract-feature setting.

Within language, the lexical features unsurpris-
ingly work the best, achieving an average accuracy
of 80.5% over all languages. The abstract features
lose some information and score on average 11.8%
lower, still beating the majority baseline (50%)
by a large margin (68.7%). If we go across lan-
guage, the lexical approaches break down (overall
to 53.7% for LEX AVG/56.3% for ALL), except for
Portuguese and Spanish, thanks to their similarities
(see Table 3 for pair-wise results). The closely-
related-language effect is also observed when train-
ing on all languages, as scores go up when the
classifier has access to the related language. The
same holds for the multilingual embeddings model.
On average it reaches an accuracy of 59.8%.

The closeness effect for Portuguese and Spanish
can also be observed in language-to-language ex-
periments, where scores for ES7→PT and PT 7→ES
are the highest. Results for the lexical models are
generally lower on English, which might be due to
smaller amounts of data (see first column in Table 2
providing number of users per language).

The abstract features fare surprisingly well and

work a lot better across languages. The perfor-
mance is on average 6% higher across all languages
(57.9% for AVG, 63.9% for ALL) in comparison
to their lexicalized counterparts, where ABS ALL
results in the overall best model. For Spanish, the
multilingual embedding model clearly outperforms
ABS. However, the approach requires large Twitter-
specific embeddings.4

For our ABS model, if we investigate predictive
features over all languages, cf. Table 4, we can see
that the use of an emoji (like ) and shape-based
features are predictive of female users. Quotes,
question marks and length features, for example,
appear to be more predictive of male users.

3.2 Human Evaluation

We experimented with three different conditions,
one within language and two across language. For
the latter, we set up an experiment where native
speakers of Dutch were presented with tweets writ-
ten in Portuguese and were asked to guess the
poster’s gender. In the other experiment, we asked
speakers of French to identify the gender of the
writer when reading Dutch tweets. In both cases,
the participants declared to have no prior knowl-
edge of the target language. For the in-language
experiment, we asked Dutch speakers to identify
the gender of a user writing Dutch tweets. The

Wikipedia) but smaller (in terms of vocabulary size) Poly-
glot embeddings resulting in inferior multilingual embeddings
for our task.

Table 5: Accuracy human versus machine.

Dutch speakers who participated in the two exper-
iments are distinct individuals. Participants were
informed of the experiment’s goal. Their identity
is anonymized in the data.

We selected a random sample of 200 users from
the Dutch and Portuguese data, preserving a 50/50
gender distribution. Each user was represented by
twenty tweets. The answer key (F/M) order was
randomized. For each of the three experiments we
had six judges, balanced for gender, and obtained
three annotations per target user.

Results and Analysis Inter-annotator agreement
for the tasks was measured via Fleiss kappa (n =
3, N = 200), and was higher for the in-language
experiment (K = 0.40) than for the cross-language
tasks (NL 7→PT: K = 0.25; FR 7→NL: K = 0.28).
Table 5 shows accuracy against the gold labels,
comparing humans (average accuracy over three
annotators) to lexical and bleached models on the
exact same subset of 200 users. Systems were
tested under two different conditions regarding the
number of tweets per user for the target language:
machine and human saw the exact same twenty
tweets, or the full set of tweets (200) per user, as
done during training (Section 3.1).

First of all, our results indicate that in-language
performance of humans is 70.5%, which is quite in
line with the findings of Flekova et al. (2016), who
report an accuracy of 75% on English. Within lan-
guage, lexicalized models are superior to humans if
exposed to enough information (200 tweets setup).
One explanation for this might lie in an observation
by Flekova et al. (2016), according to which peo-
ple tend to rely too much on stereotypical lexical
indicators when assigning gender to the poster of
a tweet, while machines model less evident pat-
terns. Lexicalized models are also superior to the
bleached ones, as already seen on the full datasets
(Table 2).

We can also observe that the amount of infor-
mation available to represent a user influences sys-
tem’s performance. Training on 200 tweets per



387

user, but testing on 20 tweets only, decreases per-
formance by 12 percentage points. This is likely
due to the fact that inputs are sparser, especially
since the bleached model is trained on 5-grams.5

The bleached model, when given 200 tweets per
user, yields a performance that is slightly higher
than human accuracy.

In the cross-language setting, the picture is very
different. Here, human performance is superior
to the lexicalized models, independently of the
amount of tweets per user at testing time. This
seems to indicate that if humans cannot rely on the
lexicon, they might be exploiting some other signal
when guessing the gender of a user who tweets in
a language unknown to them. Interestingly, the
bleached models, which rely on non-lexical fea-
tures, not only outperform the lexicalized ones in
the cross-language experiments, but also neatly
match the human scores.

4 Related Work

Most existing work on gender prediction exploits
shallow lexical information based on the linguis-
tic production of the users. Few studies investi-
gate deeper syntactic information (Koppel et al.,
2002; Feng et al., 2012) or non-linguistic input, e.g.,
language-independent clues such as visual (Alow-
ibdi et al., 2013) or network information (Jurgens,
2013; Plank and Hovy, 2015; Ljubešić et al., 2017).
A related angle is cross-genre profiling. In both
settings lexical models have limited portability due
to their bias towards the language/genre they have
been trained on (Rangel et al., 2016; Busger op
Vollenbroek et al., 2016; Medvedeva et al., 2017).

Lexical bias has been shown to affect in-
language human gender prediction, too. Flekova
et al. (2016) found that people tend to rely too much
on stereotypical lexical indicators, while Nguyen
et al. (2014) show that more than 10% of the Twit-
ter users do actually not employ words that the
crowd associates with their biological sex. Our fea-
tures abstract away from such lexical cues while
retaining predictive signal.

5 Conclusions

Bleaching text into abstract features is surprisingly
effective for predicting gender, though lexical infor-

5We experimented with training on 20 tweets rather than
200, and with different n-gram sizes (e.g., 1–4). Despite
slightly better results, we decided to use the trained models as
they were to employ the same settings across all experiments
(200 tweets per users, n = 5), with no further tuning.

mation is still more useful within language (RQ1).
However, models based on lexical clues fail when
transferred to other languages, or require large
amounts of unlabeled data from a similar domain
as our experiments with the multilingual embed-
ding model indicate. Instead, our bleached models
clearly capture some signal beyond the lexicon,
and perform well in a cross-lingual setting (RQ2).
We are well aware that we are testing our cross-
language bleached models in the context of closely
related languages. While some features (such as
PunctA, or Frequency) might carry over to geneti-
cally more distant languages, other features (such
as Vowels and Shape) would probably be meaning-
less. Future work on this will require a sensible
setting from a language typology perspective for
choosing and testing adequate features.

In our novel study on human proficiency for
cross-lingual gender prediction, we discovered that
people are also abstracting away from the lexicon.
Indeed, we observe that they are able to detect gen-
der by looking at tweets in a language they do not
know (RQ3) with an accuracy of 60% on average.
