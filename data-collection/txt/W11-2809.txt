While the game industry has excelled at simulat-
ing combat, dynamically generating social inter-
action and natural language dialogue has proven
intractable. The gaming landscape today, with
millions of people playing games together online,
provides opportunities to radically rethink our ap-
proach to developing conversational, socially intel-
ligent characters. This talk will present a data-
driven, human-machine collaborative approach to
automating characters using data recorded from on-
line human-human interactions, including a crowd-
sourced annotation framework, and a new real-
time planning system driven by thousands of anno-
tated human gameplay traces. The approach will
be demonstrated with examples from three novel
games: The Restaurant Game has recorded over
16,000 people playing as customers and waitress,
Improviso is currently recording players on the set
of a low-budget science fiction movie, and Mars Es-
cape has recorded hundreds of online human-robot
interactions for eventual transfer to a real robot.
