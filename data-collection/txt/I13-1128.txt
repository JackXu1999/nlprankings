Abstract 

This paper proposes an example driven ap-
proach to improve the quality of MT system 
outputs. Specifically, We extend the system 
combination method in SMT to combine the 
examples by two strategies: 1) estimating the 
confidence of examples by the similarity be-
tween source input and the source part of ex-
amples; 2) approximating target word posteri-
or probability by the word alignments of the 
bilingual examples. Experimental results show 
a significant improvement of 0.64 BLEU score 
as compared to one online translation service 
(Google Translate). 

1 Introduction 
Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), state-of-
the-art solution, has remarkable success with the 
support of the large-scale bilingual corpora to 
boost the translation quality at present. However, 
due to the long tail effect of human language, 
statistical anomalies in the training data can 
cause that tons of desired translation knowledge 
could not be statistically learned from the large-
scale bilingual corpora. As a result, bulks of the 
specific translation requirements not well ad-
dressed still perplex machine translation academ-
ia and industry.  

Combining the examples with machine trans-
lations output is a good solution to improve 
translation quality for this issue. Several methods 
have been proposed in recent years. One ap-
proach tries to replace relevant chunks, taking 
advantage of Translation Memory (TM). Its mo-
tivation is to store and to retrieve similar transla-
tion examples for a given input, then to avail of 
examples to replace the similar chunks into the 
input by the threshold of similar score (Smith 
and Clark, 2009; Koehn and Senellart,2010) or 
by the decision of an automatic classifier (He at 
al., 2010; Ma et al., 2011). Another approach 

tries to enhance phrase table of SMT, integrating 
collected bilingual pairs into the phrase table 
(Biҫici and Clark, 2009; Simardand Isabelle, 
2010; DauméIII and Jagarlamudi, 2011). 

Different to the above studies in which the 
EBMT and SMT function in a pipeline style, the 
work in this paper tries to integrate the SMT re-
sults and translation examples in a unified 
framework. In parallel to the system combination 
in SMT, we try to integrate the translation exam-
ples into the confusion network, allowing each 
word in both SMT results and examples to com-
pete for the optimal output. In order to achieve 
the goal, the proposed method introduces some 
new features to bridge the statistical and example 
translation. 

This paper presents an approach to repairing 
the translation errors via retrieving translation 
examples from examples corpus. The effective-
ness of our method is validated on the standard 
test set of Olympics task in IWSLT 2012 Evalua-
tion Campaign. Experimental results show that 
an absolute increase of 0.64 BLEU score is ob-
served after repairing original translations. This 
significant improvement suggests the proposed 
strategy as a promising solution to the subtle task 
of integrating example knowledge into statistical 
model outputs, as well as a practical way to boost 
current MT service. 

2 Repairing Translations with  Im-
proved Confusion Network 

Repairing translation can be viewed as a process 
of translation knowledge fusion. As illustrated in 
Fig.1, the proposed approach consists of follow-
ing steps. We first obtain an online translation 
system output E! for a given input sentence F. 
Then we retrieve the top-n examples {<
ex_F!, ex_E! >)  |(i ∈ {1, 2,… , n}} from bilingual 
examples corpus which are most similar to F. 
Then taking the translation E! as the initial skele-

967



ton, we construct a confusion network by adding 
the top-n examples into the skeleton incremental-
ly by the word alignments relation between the 
current skeleton and the i-th example ex_E!. The 
key step is to estimating the word confidence. In 
this work, we design a feature based on example 
confidence and word posterior probability by 
word alignment of examples. Finally, we decode 
the confusion network by the classic features 
used in MT combination and new features via a 
log-linear model.

Translation by Examples 

2.1 Estimating Example Confidence 
We use a word-based vector space model to re-
trieve examples from bilingual corpus, by com-
paring the deviation of angles between the source 
part of each example vector ex_F! and the source 
input vector F. The Cosine Similarity of the vec-
tors is applied to measure the similarity between 
the source input sentence F  and the each 
pleex_F!, as calculated by: 

𝐶𝑜𝑠𝑆𝑖𝑚(𝑒𝑥_𝐹! ,𝐹) =
𝑒𝑥_𝐹! ⋅ 𝐹
𝑒𝑥_𝐹! ∗ 𝐹

 (1) 

where ex_F! ⋅ F is the intersection between the 
vector ex_F! and the vector F. ex_F! is the norm 
of the vector ex_F! and F  is the norm of the 
vector F.To balance the word recall and precision 
of examples, we filter the examples by simply 
keeping top-n similar examples for fusion. 

Obviously, a reasonable assumption is that the 
target example has a higher confidence to occur 
in the final output if the corresponding source 
part of example has a higher similarity with the 
source input sentence. Therefore, we estimate the 

confidence C!  of each target example ex_E!(i ∈
1, 2,… , n )by the Cosine Similarity score be-

tween the source part of example ex_F! and the 
source input F.  

2.2 Estimating Word Posterior Probability 
by Word Alignment of Examples 

To penalize the irrelevant information from ex-
amples, we estimate word posterior probability 
by word alignment between source words and 
target words in examples. For word alignment 
between bilingual pairs in SMT, the most popu-
larly used is the IBM model (Brown et al., 1993) 
in the toolkit GIZA++ (Och et al., 1999), com-
bined with symmetric heuristics.  

We estimate the word posterior probability ac-
cording to word alignments of examples. We 
create a counter for each word, which might in-
volve in the final translation. The words can 
come from target parts of examples or the skele-
ton translation. 

For each word, its counter works as follows: 1) 
Initialize the counter as 0. 2) Keep the counter 
unchanged if the word either comes from the 
original translation or does not appear in align-
ments. 3) Increase the counter by one if its corre-
sponding source word in alignments also appears 
in the source input sentence. 4) Decrease the 
counter by one if its corresponding source word 
in alignments does not disappear in the source 
input sentence. 

Then we estimate posterior probability of the 
word wfor each fusing translationE!by the coun-
ter value as following formula: 

𝑝 𝑤|𝐸! =
1

1 + 𝑒!!
 (2) 

where c is the counter value. The value of E! is 
defined as follows: 

𝐸! =
𝑒𝑥_𝐸! , 𝑖 = 1,2. . 𝑛
𝐸!    , 𝑖 = 0

   (3) 

2.3 Features for Fusion 
In the practice of translation fusion under SMT 
system combination framework, six common 
features are used to guide the decoding: 

Language model: probability from an N-gram 
language model. 

Word penalty: penalty depending on the size 
(in words) of the hypothesis. 

Null-arc penalty: penalty depending on the 
number of null-arcs crossed in the confusion 
network to obtain the hypothesis.

N-gram agreement: the value which is equal 
to the counts of N-gram matches between fusing 
translations (examples and original translations) 
and the hypothesis divided by the number of the 
fusing translations. 

 N-gram probability: a kind of like language 
model trained on the top-n examples.  

Word confidence: the production of word 
posterior probability and the confidence of the 
fusing translation where the word come from. 

The practical effect is that the word posterior 
probability is computed with a simple method at 
the cost of estimating the word confidence from 
original translation roughly. To solve this prob-
lem, an original word penalty feature is intro-
duced into our method. 

Original word penalty: penalty depending on 
the number of words from the original translation. 
The feature indicates the degree of repairing 
original translation. 

In addition, although the incremental TER 
alignment is used in constructing the confusion 
network to avoid most of alignment errors, over-
coming the noise from the examples is critical. 
So we adopt repetitive word penalty to debilitate 
this effect. 

Repetitive word penalty: penalty depending 
on the number of repetitive words in the hypoth-
esis. 

3 Experiments 
3.1 Experimental Settings 
Our experiments are carried out on the HIT da-
taset in the OLYMPICS task of IWSLT 2012 
Evaluation Campaign (Federico et al., 2012). We 
take the training dataset as examples corpus, 
which contains 52,603 pairs of Chinese-English 
sentences. Development and test dataset provid-
ed by the task contain 2,057 and 998 pairs of 
Chinese-English sentences, respectively. The 
Chinese text is segmented by Stanford Word 
Segmentation (Chang et al., 2008). Detailed sta-
tistics of the corpus are shown in Table 1.

Table 1. The Description of HIT dataset  

The original MT outputs of develop set and 
test set come form Google Translate services. 
The 5-gram English target language model has 
been trained on Example corpus using SRILM 
(Stolcke, 2002). The model parameters are 
trained by MERT (Och, 2003). The 500-best list 
is created at each MERT iteration and is append-
ed to the n-best lists created at previous iterations. 
The results are evaluated by BLEU-4 (Papineni 
et al., 2002) score. 

To grasp the distribution of test set on similar 
score, the composition of test subsets based on 
similar scores is calculated， which is shown in 
Table 2.

[0.8,0.9) 209 1,394 6.67

(0.0,0.4) 570 5,917 10.38

similar scores 

3.2 Evaluating Translation Quality 
In our experiments, firstly we re-rank the retriev-
al examples corpus by the Cosine Similarity 
score and empiricaly retrieve the top-15 similar 
examples for each source sentence in develop-
ment and test dataset. Secondly, using the Goog-
le Translate services to translate the source sen-
tence in test and development set, we obtain the 
results of its translations (Original). Then we 
tune the model parameter on the development 
dataset, and decode on the test dataset to gener-
ate new translations (Repaired). For the compari-
son, we list two results of our baseline method: 
One is the result of original translation (Original); 
the other baseline is the result of replacing origi-
nal translations by the example with max similar 
score (Replaced). When combining the top-15 
similar examples and original translation, the 
BLEU score of word-level oracle system (Oracle) 
is shown in Table 3, and the best system 
(IWSLT12_Best) on the dataset in IWSLT 2012 
Evaluation Campaign is also listed.  

As we can see from Table 3, we still obtain 
significantly inferior results compared to the 
original translation if we replace all the Google 
translations by the most similar examples, which 
is reflected by an absolute 8.55 point drop on the 
test set in BLEU score. On the other hand, our 
repairing method, which can repair original 

969



translation result automatically in word-level, 
leads to an increase of 0.64 absolute BLEU point 
on the test set. 

Model BLEU% 
Original 18.77 
Replaced 10.22 
Repaired 19.41* 

IWSLT12_Best 19.17 

Table 3. Comparison with others on BLEU score  
(* significant at 0.005-level compared with the 

score of Original) 

The experimental results show that our retriev-
al examples driven method appears to be effec-
tive in repairing incorrect translation with signif-
icant improvement in translation quality. Replac-
ing by the most similar example cannot improve 
the translation quality when the similar score is 
low. Combing the examples with original trans-
lation improves the translation quality. In this 
sense, it is promising to correct translation by the 
examples via the proposed method. 

3.3 The Effect of Example Similarity 
We compare our method (Repaired) with two 
baselines (Original and Replaced) in different 
similar score region. We evaluate the translations 
by BLEU score. The results are listed in Table 4. 

 Original Replaced Repaired 
(0.9, 1.0) 17.23 36.99 22.98 
(0.8, 0.9] 20.92 27.20 21.44 
(0.7, 0.8] 19.90 15.03 20.23* 
(0.6, 0.7] 1 8.55 9.12 17.71 
(0.5, 0.6] 18.38 4.22 17.50 
(0.4, 0.5] 18.76 1.78 17.54 
(0.0, 0.4] 18.25 0.80 17.20 

Table 4. BLEU in different similar score region  
(*significant at 0.005-level compared with the 

score of Original) 

From Table 4, we can see when the similar 
score is greater than 0.8, replacing the original 
translation by the most similar example has a 
serious advantage on BLEU score. When the 
similar score declines, the BLEU score also 
drops sharply. When the similar score region is 
(0.7, 0.8], our method has a significant im-
provement of absolute 0.33 BLEU score com-
pared with original. And when the similar score 
declines bellow 0.7, the original translation is 
better. But it is remarkable that the result is gen-
erated by un-tuned parameters model.  

3.4 Feature Analysis 
In the experiment, we investigated the contribu-
tion of our different feature sets. After removing 
one feature, we retune the weights of features on 
the development set and re-decode on the test set. 
We evaluate the outputs of these models by 
BLEU, and list the results in Table 5.  

Model BLEU% 
Repaired 19.41 

Without word penalty 19.39 
Without N-gram agreement 19.33 

Without language model 19.23^ 
Without repetitive word penalty 19.21^ 

Without null-arc penalty 19.10^ 
Without original word penalty 19.01^ 

Without word confidence 18.98^ 
Without N-gram probability 18.71^ 

Table 5. Contribution of Features  
(^significant at 0.05-level compared with the re-

paired score) 

As shown in Table 5, the performance drops 
significantly (p<0.05) when language model, 
repetitive word penalty, null-arc penalty, original 
word penalty, word confidence, N-gram proba-
bility is removed from the feature set respective-
ly. And word penalty and N-gram agreement ha-
ve weak effects on the results. It is remarkable 
that our specific features repetitive word penalty, 
original word penalty, and word confidence can 
bring the improvement of 0.20, 0.40, and 0.43 
BLEU point than that without them respectively.  

4 Conclusion 
In this paper, we introduce statistical confusion 
network for translation example fusion to im-
prove the current online MT quality We estimate 
the posterior of the word translation by the ex-
ample similarity and introduce some new fea-
tures to enhance the log-linear model optimiza-
tion for the best translation. We check our meth-
od on the HIT dataset in the OLYMPICS task of 
IWSLT 2012 Evaluation Campaign. The Exper-
imental results indicate that proposed method 
enhance the Chinese-English translations by 
Google, with a significant 0.64 absolute im-
provement according to BLEU score.
