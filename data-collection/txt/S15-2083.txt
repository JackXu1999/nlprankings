Abstract

This paper describes our system used in the
Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis Task 12 of
SemEval-2015. Our system is based on two
supervised machine learning algorithms: sig-
moidal feedforward network to train binary
classifiers for aspect category classification
(Slot 1), and Conditional Random Fields to
train classifiers for opinion target extraction
(Slot 2). We extract a variety of lexicon and
syntactic features, as well as cluster features
induced from unlabeled data. Our system
achieves state-of-the-art performances, rank-
ing 1st for three of the evaluations (Slot 1 for
both restaurant and laptop domains, and Slot
1 & 2) and 2nd for Slot 2 evaluation.

1 Introduction

The amount of user-generated content on the web
has grown rapidly in recent years, prompting in-
creasing interests in the research area of sentiment
analysis and opinion mining. Most previous work
is concerned with detecting the overall polarity of a
sentence or paragraph, regardless of the target enti-
ties (e.g. restaurants) and their aspects (e.g. food).
By contrast, the Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis
task of SemEval 2014 (SE-ABSA14) is concerned
with identifying the aspects of given target enti-
ties and the sentiment expressed towards each as-
pect (Pontiki et al., 2014).

The SemEval-2015 Aspect Based Sentiment
Analysis (SE-ABSA15) task is a continuation of
SE-ABSA14 (Pontiki et al., 2015). The SE-
ABSA15 task features a number of changes that

address issues raised in SE-ABSA14 and also en-
courage further in-depth research. For example, (1)
instead of isolated (potentially out of context) sen-
tences, the input datasets will contain entire reviews;
(2) information linking aspect terms and aspect cat-
egories are now provided; (3) besides in-domain
ABSA (Subtask 1), SE-ABSA15 will include an
out-of-domain ABSA subtask (Subtask 2).

We participate in Subtask 1 of SE-ABSA15,
namely aspect category classification (Slot 1) and
opinion target extraction (Slot 2). We also partici-
pate in the evaluation which assesses whether a sys-
tem identifies both the aspect categories and opinion
targets correctly (Slot 1 & 2).

For Slot 1, we model the problem as a multi-class
classification problem where binary classifiers are
trained to predict the aspect categories. We follow
the one-vs-all strategy and train a binary classifier
for each category in the training set. Each classifier
is trained using sigmoidal feedforward network with
1 hidden layer. For Slot 2, we follow the approach of
Toh and Wang (2014) by modeling the problem as a
sequential labeling task, using Conditional Random
Fields (CRF) as the training algorithm. For Slot 1 &
2, we perform a simple combination of Slot 1 pre-
dictions and Slot 2 predictions.

The remainder of this paper is structured as fol-
lows. In Section 2, we describe our system in detail,
including the feature description and approaches. In
Section 3, the official results are presented. Feature
ablation results are shown in Section 4. Finally, Sec-
tion 5 summarizes our work.

2 System Description

In this section, we present the details of our sen-
timent analysis system. The training set consists of
254 English review documents containing 1315 sen-
tences for the restaurant domain and 277 English re-
view documents containing 1739 sentences for the
laptop domain.

As a first step of our system, we perform basic
data preprocessing. All sentences are tokenized and
parsed using the Stanford Parser1.

2.1 Features

This section briefly describes the features used in
our system, where some of the features are useful
across different slots. The features used are a subset
of the features described in Toh and Wang (2014),
which also provides a more detailed description of
the features.

2.1.1 Word
The current word is used as a feature. For opinion

target extraction, the previous word and next word
are also used as features.

2.1.2 Bigram
All word bigrams found in a sentence are used as

features.

2.1.3 Name List
For the restaurant domain, we extract two high

precision name lists from the training set and use
them for membership testing. For the first list, we
collect and keep only high frequent opinion targets.
For the second list, we consider the counts of in-
dividual words in the opinion targets and keep those
words that frequently occur as part of an opinion tar-
get in the training set.

2.1.4 Head Word
From the sentence parse tree, we extract the head

word of each word and use it as a feature.

2.1.5 Word Cluster
We induce Brown clusters and K-means clus-

ters from two different sources of unlabeled dataset:
the Multi-Domain Sentiment Dataset that contains

1http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml

Amazon product reviews (Blitzer et al., 2007)2, and
the Yelp Phoenix Academic Dataset that contains
user reviews3. We also experiment using a third
dataset that is created by combining the initial two
datasets into one.

For Brown clusters4, we experiment with differ-
ent datasets, cluster sizes ({100, 200, 500, 1000}),
minimum occurrences ({1, 2, 3}) and binary prefix
lengths. The best settings to use are determined us-
ing 5-fold cross validation.

K-means clusters are induced using the
word2vec tool (Mikolov et al., 2013)5. Sim-
ilarly, among different datasets, word vector
sizes ({50, 100, 200, 500, 1000}), cluster sizes
({50, 100, 200, 500, 1000}), and sub-sampling
thresholds ({0.00001, 0.001}), we use 5-fold cross
validation to select the best settings.

2.1.6 Name List Generated using Double
Propagation

For the restaurant domain, we generate a name
list of possible opinion targets using the Double
Propagation (DP) algorithm (Qiu et al., 2011). The
propagation rules are modified from the logic rules
presented in Liu et al. (2013), where we write our
rules in Prolog and use SWI-Prolog6 as the solver.
As the rules can only identify single-word targets,
to consider multi-word targets, we extend the left
boundary of the identified target to include any con-
sective noun words right before the target.

2.2 Approaches

We developed our system to return results for Slot
1 (restaurant and laptop domains), Slot 2 (restaurant
domain) and Slot 1 & 2 (restaurant domain). This
section describes our machine learning approaches
used to generate the predictions for each slot.

2.2.1 Aspect Category Classification (Slot 1)
Aspect category classification is based on a set of

one-vs-all binary classifiers, one classifier for each

at http://www.cs.jhu.edu/ mdredze/datasets/sentiment/

category found in the training set. For each sentence
in the training set, we extract features from all words
in the sentence to create a training example. The la-
bel of the example depends on which category C we
are training: 1 if the sentence contains C as one of
its categories, −1 otherwise. The number of binary
classifiers is 13 for the restaurant domain and 79 for
the laptop domain, which equals to the number of
categories annotated in the training set for the re-
spective domain.

We use the Vowpal Wabbit tool7 to train the bi-
nary classifiers. Each classifier is trained using sig-
moidal feedforward network with 1 hidden layer
(--nn), with --ngram enabled to generate word
bigrams. The learning rate (-l) and number of hid-
den units are tuned using 5-fold cross validation.

We also tuned the probability threshold where we
regard the classifier output as positive outcome. Any
classifier that returns a probability score greater than
the threshold will be added to the output set of cate-
gories. The tuned parameter values used are shown
in Table 1.

Table 2 shows the features used for the restau-
rant and laptop domain, as well as the 5-fold cross-
validation performances after adding each feature
group.

2.2.2 Opinion Target Extraction (Slot 2)
Opinion target extraction is modeled as a sequen-

tial labeling task, where each word in the sentence is
assigned a label using the IOB2 scheme (Sang and
Veenstra, 1999). The classifier is trained using Con-
ditional Random Fields (CRF), which has shown
to achieve state-of-the-art performances in previous
work (Toh and Wang, 2014; Chernyshevich, 2014).
We use the CRFsuite tool (Okazaki, 2007) for CRF
training and enable negative state and transition
features (-p feature.possible states=1

-p feature.possible transitions=1).
We experiment with two different methods of re-

turning predicted opinion targets, one suitable for
Slot 1 & 2 evaluation (Method-1), the other suitable
for Slot 2 evaluation (Method-2).

For Slot 1 & 2 evaluation, the explicit opinion tar-
gets may have more than one categories. Thus, we
use the following method (Method-1): we train a
separate CRF model for each category found in the
training set. That is, for each category C, we assign
the label “B-C” to indicate the start of an opinion
target, “I-C” to indicate the continuation of an opin-
ion target, and “O” if the opinion target does not
have C as one of its categories.

Using FOOD#PRICES category as an ex-
ample, for the training set that is used to
train the FOOD#PRICES CRF model, we as-
sign the label “B-FOOD#PRICES” to indicate
the start of a FOOD#PRICES opinion target, “I-
FOOD#PRICES” to indicate the continuation of a
FOOD#PRICES opinion target, and “O” if the opin-
ion target does not have FOOD#PRICES as one of
its categories.

However, our initial experiments suggest that
Method-1 does not achieve optimum performance
for Slot 2 evaluation. The reason is that the number
of positive training examples for most of the cate-
gories is small.

Table 3: 5-fold cross-validation performances of Slot 2
on the restaurant domain. Each row uses all features
added in the previous rows. The cross-validation experi-
ments use Method-1 to train the models.

Since Slot 2 evaluation only requires the identi-
fied text span to be returned and does not require
any category information, we can increase the num-
ber of positive training examples by collapsing all
categories into a single category (e.g. “TERM”).
Thus, for Slot 2 evaluation, the following method
(Method-2) is used: we train a single CRF model
where all opinion targets in the training set are as-
signed the labels “B-TERM”, “I-TERM” and “O”
accordingly.

Table 3 shows the features used for the restaurant

domain as well as the 5-fold cross-validation perfor-
mances after adding each feature group.

Due to time constraints, all cross-validation ex-
periments for Slot 2 use Method-1 to train the mod-
els. The same settings will then be used to train the
final models using both Method-1 (for Slot 1 & 2
evaluation) and Method-2 (for Slot 2 evaluation).

2.2.3 Slot 1 & 2
To create the predictions for Slot 1 & 2 evalua-

tion, we perform a simple combination of Slot 1 pre-
dictions and Slot 2 predictions. First, we use all Slot
2 predictions. Next, for each sentence, we add cat-
egories that are found in Slot 1 predictions but not
Slot 2 predictions of the same sentence. Those ad-
ditional categories are assumed to be NULL targets.

3 Results

We have submitted results for unconstrained and
constrained (using only the provided training set
of the corresponding domain) systems. The con-
strained system only uses Word, Bigram (for Slot 1)
and Name List (for the restaurant domain) features.

sions. We also include the results of the top three

participating systems and official baselines for com-
parison (Pontiki et al., 2015).

As shown from the table, our system performed
well for all four evaluations. Our system is ranked
1st for three of the evaluations (Slot 1 for both
restaurant and laptop domains, and Slot 1 & 2) and
2nd for Slot 2 evaluation. In addition, our con-
strained system also achieves competitive results,
ranking 2nd in Slot 1 Restaurant and 4th in Slot 1
Laptop and Slot 1 & 2. Another observation is that
our unconstrained systems achieved better perfor-
mances than the corresponding constrained systems
for all evaluations, indicating the use of external re-
sources are beneficial.

We are interested to know whether the Slot 2 pre-
dictions that help to achieve best results in Slot 1
& 2 evaluation are also useful for Slot 2 evaluation.
Table 5 shows the F1 performances of Slot 2 eval-
uation if we have used Method-1 (Section 2.2.2) to
generate the Slot 2 predictions. As shown from the
table, using the same Slot 2 predictions for both Slot
2 evaluation and Slot 1 & 2 evaluation are detrimen-
tal to Slot 2 performances, with performance differ-
ence greater than 6.0%. Our approach of using a
different method to generate Slot 2 predictions for
Slot 2 evaluation helps to overcome the data sparse-
ness problem and improves the performances of tar-
get extraction.

4 Feature Ablation

Table 6 and Table 7 show the (unconstrained) F1
measure and loss on the test set resulting from train-
ing with each group of feature removed for Slot 1
and Slot 2 respectively. The ablation experiments
indicate that each feature is helpful in improving the
performance, with performance gains in the range
of 1.0% − 6.0%. The only exception is the use of

slots on the restaurant domain.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we report our work on aspect category
classification and opinion target extraction using su-
pervised machine learning approaches. By lever-
aging on external resources, careful feature selec-
tion and performance tuning, our system achieves
top performances in all four evaluations, ranking 1st
for three of the evaluations, and second for the re-

500



maining evaluation. In future, we hope to improve
our opinion target extraction system by taking into
account surrounding sentence context and incorpo-
rating sentiment lexicon features to better classify
aspect categories and detect opinion expressions.
