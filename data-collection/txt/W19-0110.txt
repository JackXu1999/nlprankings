Abstract

A growing body of research in phonology
addresses the representation and learning of
variable processes and exceptional, lexically
conditioned processes. Linzen et al. (2013)
present a MaxEnt model with additive lexical
scales to account for data exhibiting both vari-
ation and exceptionality. In this paper, we im-
plement a learning model for lexically scaled
MaxEnt grammars which we show to be suc-
cessful across a range of data containing pat-
terns of variation and exceptionality. We also
explore how the model’s parameters and the
rate of exceptionality in the data influence its
performance and predictions for novel forms.

1 Introduction

While phonological research often focuses on cate-
gorical generalizations, a growing body of research
addresses the representation and learning of vari-
able processes and exceptional processes, where ap-
plication is lexically conditioned (see Coetzee and
Pater (2011) and Pater (2010) for overviews). A
few recent studies have modeled processes that ex-
hibit both variation and exceptionality (Hayes and
Londe, 2006; Pater et al., 2012; Linzen et al., 2013;
Nazarov, 2018; Shih, 2018; Zymet, 2018).

tropy (MaxEnt) grammar (Goldwater and Johnson,
2003) with additive, lexically specified scales. Rus-
sian contains a vowel alternation process that ex-
hibits both variation and idiosyncratic lexical con-
ditioning (exceptionality). Linzen et al. show that
speakers apply this process variably and that its vari-
ation differs across lexical items. In their lexical
scaling framework, each lexical item is associated
with a vector of scales that are added to the gen-
eral weights of the grammar’s constraints. These
summed weights are used to calculate the probabil-
ity of the input’s surface realization. This allows the
likelihood of a phonological process to differ across
morphemes, since the scales can modulate how con-
straints are weighted for different lexemes. While
Linzen et al. (2013) show that a lexically scaled
MaxEnt grammar can successfully represent Rus-
sian speakers’ knowledge of a pattern that is both
variable and exceptional, they do not show how such
a grammar would be learned.

In this paper, we introduce a model for learn-
ing lexically scaled MaxEnt grammars from data
exhibiting both variation and exceptionality.1 The
primary challenge for formalizing learning in this
framework is generalizing appropriately beyond the
learning data and limiting the learner’s reliance on
lexical scales. Since every morpheme can poten-
tially scale the weight of every constraint, there is
potential for massively over-fitting the learning data

and failing to generalize. We approach this chal-
lenge as a problem of feature selection and seek a
learner that utilizes scales (i.e., assigning them non-
zero weights) only when needed to account for lex-
ical conditioning. We propose an objective function
relying on an L1 (linear) prior (§2), rather than the
more commonly used L2 (quadratic) prior (§4.1), to
formalize these criteria.

Our approach differs in a number of ways from
previous models for learning exceptionality and
variation. We assume the learner must induce a
weighting for general phonological constraints and
make lexical conditioning choices without prior
knowledge of which lexical items behave exception-
ally (Allen and Becker, 2015; Becker and Gouskova,
2016). Rather than splitting the learning of gen-
eral phonological patterns and the learning of excep-
tions/classes into distinct learning phases (Nazarov,
2018; Shih, 2018), or treating the learning of lex-
ical conditioning as emergent from repeated expo-
sure to the lexicon (Zuraw, 2000; Zuraw, 2010), we
seek to formally characterize the criteria that favor
the desired balance of lexical sensitivity and gener-
alization in a model that optimizes general weights
and lexical conditioning in parallel. Our approach is
most similar to Moore-Cantwell and Pater (2016);
however, we argue for an L1 prior rather than an
L2 prior (§4.1). We demonstrate the capacity of our
model to learn variation and exceptionality using a
variety of toy languages based on the Russian pro-
cess mentioned above (§3).

We also explore the model’s predictions for novel
data, examining how the learner decides which pat-
terns to treat as exceptional and which to generalize
(§4). Previous behavioral investigations of speak-
ers’ productive knowledge of lexically conditioned
(morpho-)phonological alternations have found that
speakers extend statistical tendencies in the lexicon
to novel forms (Zuraw, 2000; Ernestus and Baayen,
2003; Hayes and Londe, 2006; Hayes et al., 2009;
Linzen et al., 2013; Becker and Gouskova, 2016).
In some cases, the absolute rates of application of
a process in nonce forms closely follow rates ob-
served in the lexicon, yielding so-called “frequency-
matching” behavior (Hayes and Londe, 2006; Hayes
et al., 2009; Zymet, 2018). In other cases, however,
rates of application of exceptional processes are sys-
tematically skewed lower as compared to the lexi-

cal rates (Zuraw, 2000; Albright and Hayes, 2003;
Ernestus and Baayen, 2003). Under a variety of
learning assumptions, frequency-matching behavior
is not automatic. To better understand some of the
factors that may play a role in these divergent find-
ings, we examine the properties of the data dis-
tribution and parameters of the model that affect
frequency-matching behavior on nonce forms.

2 Lexically scaled MaxEnt

Linzen et al.’s (2013) scaled weights framework
uses weighted constraints to represent probabilis-
tic phonological patterns, and adds scales on those
weights to represent lexicalized behavior for in-
dividual morphemes. In MaxEnt (Goldwater and
Johnson, 2003), the probability of some surface rep-
resentation (SR), given a grammar and an underly-
ing representation (UR), is calculated as in (1):

p(i) =
eHiP

k2Ki e
Hk

(1)

Here Hi is the harmony of a given (UR, SR) pair
i, and Ki is the set of candidates that share the same
UR as i (including i itself). Typically, harmony is
the weighted sum of a candidate’s constraint vio-
lations (Goldwater and Johnson, 2003), however in
Linzen et al.’s (2013) framework, harmony is a func-
tion of a candidate’s violations, the general weights,
and the relevant scales, as shown formally in (2):

Hi =
X

�2�
(w� +

X

m2µi
s�m)(v�i) (2)

Here � is the set of constraints, w� is the general
weight of constraint �, µi is the set of morphemes
in the (UR, SR) pair i, s�m is the scale that mor-
pheme m has for constraint �, and v�i is the number
of violations assigned to candidate i by constraint
�. The parameters of the model are the general con-
straint weights and the additive lexical scales. For
succinctness, we refer to these simply as “weights”
and “scales”, respectively. Every morpheme is asso-
ciated with a scale for every constraint that is added
to that constraint’s weight. This model is closely re-
lated to other approaches relying on additive scales
(Boersma and Hayes, 2001; Coetzee and Kawa-
hara, 2013; Hsu and Jesney, 2016) and multiplica-
tive scales (Kimper, 2011). However, in Linzen

92



et al.’s framework, scaling is not restricted to faith-
fulness constraints or systematic factors (e.g., regis-
ter, frequency): all constraints are available for lexi-
cal scaling by all morphemes. Using both weights
and scales enables the model to represent lexical-
ized exceptions by employing the scales to modulate
the effect of some constraints. We leave exploring
the relationship between this approach and indexed
constraints (Kraska-Szlenk, 1995; Pater, 1996), a
closely related framework, to future work.

We formalized learning as minimizing the objec-
tive function in (3), the sum of the negative log like-
lihood and an L1 prior on weights and scales.

Here, M is the set of morphemes in the lan-
guage, and C is a parameter that controls the over-
all strength of the prior. Our goal was to de-
termine whether learning of phonological general-
izations could occur without formally distinguish-
ing between weights and scales. Accordingly, this
prior penalizes both weights and scales with a single
strength parameter C. In simulations reported here,
both weights and scales are restricted to nonnegative
values, but this is not a inherent restriction of the
model. For optimization, we used a form of gradient
descent adapted for L1 priors – the “L1 (Clipping)”
method described by Tsuruoka et al. (2009).

3 Learning variation and exceptionality

To explore the capacity of this model to learn a range
of variable and exceptional patterns, it was trained
on four toy languages based on the Russian vowel
alternation described by Linzen et al. (2013).

In Russian, underlyingly CV prepositions surface
as C before words beginning with vowels or single
consonants; we follow Linzen et al. (2013, §5.1) in
treating this alternation as deletion. Before words
beginning with consonant clusters, vowel deletion is
variable and lexically conditioned. For example, the
vowel in /sa/ “from, with” variably surfaces with cer-
tain cluster-initial words (4a), categorically deletes
with certain others (4b), and categorically surfaces
with others (4c) (Linzen et al., 2013, 455).

(4) a. [s ⇠ sa] mnóü@stv@m “with a large
amount, (mathematical) set”

b. [s ⇠ *s@] prikáz@m “with the order”
c. [*s ⇠ s@] st@rikóm “with the old man”

The factors influencing vowel deletion in Rus-
sian span multiple phonological dimensions such
as stress and sonority profile. For the purposes of
testing our learning model, we focused on whether
words began with one or two consonants. The four
toy languages consisted of 3 prefixes /ape-/, /ate-/,
and /ake-/ concatenated with 420 stems, giving 1260
forms in total. Stems were all consonant-initial, be-
ginning either with a single consonant (“C-stems”),
or a biconsonantal cluster (“CC-stems”). Six conso-
nants were used {v, r, l, n, s, t}, giving 6 unique C-
stem types, and 36 CC-stem types. Each stem type
was replicated 10 times, yielding 420 stems in total.

In all four languages, prefix vowels categorically
deleted with C-stems, e.g., /ape-naba/ ! [apnaba].
Vowel deletion was conditioned with CC-stems, ei-
ther categorically failing to apply (§3.1) or with its
application subject to free variation (§3.2), lexical
specification (§3.3), or both (§3.4).

We used three categorically evaluated constraints
(see Linzen et al. (2013, 489-490)): ALIGN, MAX,
and *CCC. ALIGN prefers vowel deletion, and is
violated by candidates containing the final prefix
vowel. MAX disprefers vowel deletion, and is vi-
olated by candidates lacking the final prefix vowel.
*CCC is violated by candidates with triconsonantal
clusters, and so disprefers deletion with CC-stems.

After training, the model was tested by evaluating
its performance on the learning data and its predic-
tions on a set of nonce forms comprising 3 novel pre-
fixes concatenated with 42 novel stems. Following
previous work, we assume that predictions for novel
forms are generated using only the general weights.

Learning was evaluated according to quantitative
and qualitative criteria. Quantitatively, learning was
considered successful if the KL-Divergence (Kull-
back and Leibler, 1951) between the likelihood as-
signed by the model and the observed probabil-
ity in the training data was close to zero, indicat-
ing that the model succeeded in accounting for the
learning data.2 Qualitatively, learning was consid-
ered successful only if the model appropriately di-
vided weight between the general constraints and

2MaxEnt grammars cannot exactly represent categorical be-
havior, but probabilities can get arbitrarily close to 0 or 1.

the scales, only using scales when presented with
lexically conditioned data. Finally, we required that
the model generalizes the observed pattern to nonce
forms, deleting (nearly) categorically for novel C-
stems while predicting variation for CC-stems in
languages with variation and/or lexical conditioning.

For all experiments in this section, the model was
run with weights and scales initialized at 0.0, for
20,000 epochs, with a learning rate of .001, and prior
term C set to 1.0, unless otherwise noted.

Overall, the model performed well, successfully
learning the four toy languages and using the scales
appropriately. In all runs, ALIGN received non-zero
weight, reflecting (near) categorical vowel deletion
with C-stems. In languages with variable or ex-
ceptional deletion, *CCC was weighted closer to
ALIGN, predicting variation in nonce forms.

3.1 Categorical language
In the Categorical language, prefix vowels always
delete with C-stems and never with CC-stems. The
solution learned by the model captures this pattern
using the general weights only, putting no weight on
the scales, as summarized in Table (1). The weight
on *CCC is much higher than the weight on ALIGN
so that tri-consonantal clusters block vowel deletion,
and the weight of ALIGN is above that of MAX, so
that prefix vowels always delete with C-stems.

Morpheme Scales 0.0 0.0 0.0

The model’s performance on forms in the train-
ing data is illustrated in Tableau (1) with a C-stem,
/taba/, and a CC-stem, /tnaba/. Candidate probabil-

ities observed in the training data are given in col-
umn O. Column E gives the expected candidate
probabilities generated by the model, rounded to two
decimal places. The model fits the training data ex-
tremely well (KL divergence ⇡ 0.002) and, because
only the general weights are used, the model predicts
that the trained pattern should generalize, yielding
the same predicted probabilities for nonce forms.

3.2 Variable language
In the Variable language, prefix vowels always
delete with C-stems and variably delete 33% of the
time with CC-stems. As desired, the model captures
this pattern using the general weights only, putting
no weight on the scales, as shown in Table (2).

The model’s performance on trained forms is il-
lustrated in Tableau (2) below with a C-stem and
a CC-stem. The weight of *CCC is above that of
ALIGN, but by a smaller margin than in the Cate-
gorical language, yielding variable rather than cate-
gorical deletion with CC-stems. MAX is weighted
below ALIGN, so that deletion occurs (nearly) cat-
egorically for C-stems. The probabilities generated
by the model (E) fit the training data (O) extremely
well (KL divergence ⇡ 0.002) and, because only the
general constraints are used, the model predicts that
the trained pattern should generalize, yielding the
same predicted probabilities for nonce forms.

3.3 Lexical language
The Lexical language is identical to the Categori-
cal language, except that one prefix, /ape-/, is excep-
tional: its vowel always deletes with CC-stems. Av-
eraged across the lexicon, the rate of deletion with
CC-stems is therefore 33%, but this pattern cannot
be captured using the general weights alone. The
scales must be used to distinguish the behavior of
the exceptionally deleting prefix from the other two
prefixes. As Table (3) shows, the model’s solution
weights the general constraints in the same order
as in the Categorical language: *CCC > ALIGN >
MAX. The model additionally scales up the weight
of ALIGN for the deleting prefix /ape-/, yielding
(near) categorical deletion for it, and scales up the
weight of *CCC for each of the non-deleting pre-
fixes, preventing deletion for those prefixes.

*CCC MAX ALIGN
General Weights 4.6 0.0 4.1
Deleting Prefix 0.0 0.0 6.4
Non-Deleting Prefixes 5.3 0.0 0.0
Stems 0.0 0.0 0.0

Table 3: Lexical weights and mean scales

The model’s performance on forms in the train-
ing data is illustrated in Tableau (3) with a CC-
stem /tnaba/ paired with a non-deleting prefix /ake-/,
and the deleting prefix /ape-/. The weights shown
for each input are the sums of the general weights
and scales associated with the input morphemes for
each constraint. The model’s solution fits the train-
ing data well (KL divergence ⇡ 0.004), predicting
deletion for the deleting prefix and no deletion for
each non-deleting prefix. These weights addition-
ally yield deletion of all prefix vowels before C-
stems (not shown) in the learning data, as expected.
Since this is captured by general constraint weights,
the same prediction is made for novel C-stems.

Because the general weight of ALIGN is some-
what lower but still close to the general weight of
*CCC, variable deletion (37%) is predicted for novel
prefixes attached to novel CC-stems. Tableau (4) il-
lustrates with the nonce prefix /aPe-/ and the nonce
stem /pmaba/. Because this form was not present
in the training data, only the expected probabilities
are reported. As discussed above, predicting vari-
able deletion is desirable given experimental find-

Tableau 3: Lexical language – known prefixes and stems; /ape-/
exceptionally undergoes vowel deletion with CC-stems

ings that speakers extend lexical trends to nonce
forms (Hayes et al., 2009). Deletion is the dispre-
ferred outcome in both the training data and the pre-
dictions for novel forms, but the predicted rate of
deletion for novel forms (37%) is a little higher than
that observed in the training data (33%).

Interestingly, by using scales for each prefix, the
model did not single out any prefix as qualitatively
exceptional, despite the fact that such a solution is
available. Removing the weight from the scales of
the non-deleting prefixes and dividing it between the
weight of general *CCC and the deleting prefix’s
scale of ALIGN produces a solution that is identical
in terms of fit to the training data and the total sum
of weights across all constraints and scales. That
solution identifies only the deleting prefix as excep-
tional, and produces different predictions for nonce
forms. The proposed objective function does not al-
ways differentiate among distinct ways of encoding
exceptionality. The solution selected by the model in
this experiment is arbitrarily influenced by starting
the weights at zero. In experiments with weights ini-
tialized to random values between 0 and 10, the solu-
tions selected by the model all have equivalent fit to
the training data and total weight but vary somewhat
in terms of how exceptionality is encoded and the
deletion rate predicted for nonce forms. The avail-
ability of such varied solutions depends on the rate

of exceptionality in the training data and the prior.
These factors are further explored in §4.

3.4 Variable-Lexical language
The Variable-Lexical language is largely identical
to the Variable language, except that 20% of CC-
stems are exceptional triggers of categorical vowel
deletion. The model’s solution is summarized in Ta-
ble (4). Tableau (5) illustrates the learned weights
with a triggering stem /vraba/ and a non-triggering
stem /tnaba/. The model learned a set of gen-
eral weights which closely, but not exactly, repro-
duces the trained general pattern of variable dele-
tion, and weights the scale of ALIGN higher for trig-
gering CC-stems, though not enough to yield (near)
categorical deletion. Again, ALIGN is weighted
sufficiently above MAX to motivate (near) cate-
gorical deletion with C-stems. The model’s fit to
the training data for the Variable-Lexical language,
while worse than the other languages, is still good
(KL divergence ⇡ 0.08). Examining the general
weights, the model generalizes appropriately, pre-
dicting (near) categorical deletion for novel C-stems,
and variable deletion for novel CC-stems.

Tableau 5: Variable-Lexical language – known prefixes and

Fit with the training data is not as close as with
the other languages due to pervasive exceptional-
ity: 20% of the stems (84 morphemes) must utilize

scales to capture their behavior, which conflicts with
the prior’s pressure to keep the total weights and
scales low. The effect of the prior is explored sys-
tematically in the next section, but it is worth not-
ing here that a closer fit with the training data for
this language is straightforwardly achieved with a
weaker prior; for example, setting C = 0.1 yields a
deletion rate of 97% for /ape-vraba/.

4 Generalizing from exceptional data

This section examines the model’s predictions for
nonce data, focusing on how the choice of the prior
and the rate of exceptionality in the training data af-
fect generalization.

4.1 Effect of the prior
Recall that the previous section reported on exper-
iments with the prior term C set to 1.0. Here, we
vary C and examine its effects on the model’s pre-
dictions, using the Lexical language as a test case.

Figure 1: Probability of deletion with CC-stems by C values

Unsurprisingly, the model’s fit to the training data
decreases as the strength of the prior increases, as
there is more pressure to keep all weights and scales
close to zero. The model’s predictions for novel
forms also vary with C, as shown in Figure (1),
which plots the probability of deletion for CC-stems
by values of C. As C increases, there is a poorer fit
to the training data: known forms which should un-
dergo vowel deletion are slightly less likely to, and

96



known forms which should not undergo vowel dele-
tion are slightly more likely to.

The most striking trend is the convergence of
nonce form behavior with the behavior of non-
deleting forms. In the Lexical language, two pre-
fixes, and thus two-thirds of the data, categorically
do not undergo deletion with CC-stems. As dis-
cussed in §3.3, these proportions make multiple
ways of encoding exceptionality available to the
model. When the prior is weak, the model encodes
exceptionality in a distributed way, and its predicted
deletion rate for novel forms is intermediate between
the deleting and non-deleting forms in the training
data. When the prior is strong, however, the learner
is forced to set more weights to zero, and the non-
deleting forms in the learning data are more easily
accommodated by the general constraint weights.
This leads the learner to designate one of the pre-
fixes as exceptional and to generalize to novel forms
on the basis of the non-deleting prefixes. Thus, with
a stronger prior, there is more pressure on the learner
to over-extend the more general pattern in the data.

This pattern is clear when we examine the learned
weights. Table (5) reports the weights learned with
C set to 0.5 and 30. With C set low, the learner as-
signs weight to the exceptionally deleting prefix as
well as the non-deleting prefixes. With C set high,
the learner only assigns weight to the exceptional
prefix, picking it out as exceptional.

4.2 Effect of exceptionality
Following Moore-Cantwell and Pater (2016), this
section reports the effect of varying the proportion
of exceptional forms in the training data on nonce
form predictions. To test this, we started with the
Categorical language, in which prefix vowels always
delete with C-stems but never delete with CC-stems,
and then created data sets which increased the per-

centage of CC-stems that trigger deletion of the pre-
fix vowel by 10% increments, forming a total of 11
data sets (with deletion rates of 0%, 10%, . . . , 90%,
100%). In these simulations, epochs were increased
up to 80000 (we found this to be necessary to guar-
antee convergence for languages with pervasive ex-
ceptionality and weaker priors).

Figure 2: Probability of deletion with CC-stems by percentage
of deletion-triggering CC-stems in the training data

Figure (2) plots the probability of deletion as a
function of the percentage of triggering CC-stems
in the training data. To show how the strength of
the prior interacts with the rate of exceptionality in
the data, we show curves for three settings of the
prior parameter (C = 0.1, 0.5, 1.0). The patterns are
qualitatively similar for all three settings, with closer
fit to the data for weaker priors. As the percentage of
triggering CC-stems in the training data increases,
the probability of deleting the prefix vowel before
any CC-stem increases. For trained stems, the prob-
ability of deleting with a non-triggering stem is al-
ways much lower than the probability of deleting
with a triggering stem, with rates closer to categor-
ical for lower C values. The rate of exceptionality
affects learning of both the majority and minority
patterns: the more extreme the imbalance, the more
poorly the minority pattern is learned and the more
categorically the majority pattern is learned.

The behavior of nonce forms mirrors the behav-
ior of non-triggering stems when they form a ma-

97



jority of the training data (0%-30%), and mirros
the behavior of triggering stems when they form a
majority in the training data (60%-100%), with the
probability of deleting in nonce forms rising sharply
across those data sets where there is not a clear ma-
jority (40%-50%). This indicates that, when there
is a clear majority pattern, the model more strongly
trends towards using the general weights to capture
the majority pattern and the scales to capture the be-
havior of exceptional forms. When there is no clear
majority pattern, the model will trend towards learn-
ing general weights which more closely reflect the
lexical statistics in the training data, using scales to
account for the idiosyncratic behavior of each stem.

Also noteworthy are the non-linear shape and
the displacement of the nonce form curves. As
Moore-Cantwell and Pater (2016) found for indexed
constraints, we show here that the lexically scaled
model also predicts nonce form rates that exagger-
ate the proportions in the training data. For exam-
ple, when 70% of the stems trigger deletion in the
training data, the model with C = 1.0 exagger-
ates this to over 85% in novel forms, and when 30%
of stems trigger deletion in training, the model pre-
dicts fewer than 15% deletion in novel forms. Our
results demonstrate two further influences. First,
the exaggeration effect is greater for weaker priors
since the curves are overall steeper. Second, the
curve is shifted leftward: when 50% of the CC-
stems are triggers, the predicted rate of deletion for
nonce forms is above 50%, regardless of C. The pre-
dicted deletion rate is generally higher than might
be expected on the basis of the trained deletion rate
in CC-stems alone. The presence of categorically
deleting C-stems in the data exerts an independent
pressure to weight ALIGN more heavily than MAX,
favoring deletion overall. When the C = 1.0 model
is trained without C-stems (not shown), no skew is
predicted: 50% deletion is predicted for nonce forms
in the 50% training condition. These results indicate
that predictions for nonce forms in one context can
be influenced by other processes in the language.

5 Discussion

5.1 Why not L2 regularization?
Existing MaxEnt models of phonology over-

whelmingly utilize L2 priors rather than L1 priors

(Goldwater and Johnson, 2003; Wilson, 2006; Pater
et al., 2012). For our purposes, however, we found
that the choice of an L1 prior was crucial. While
both L1 and L2 priors penalize higher weights, L1
priors are more effective for learning sparse vec-
tors of weights, with as many zeroes as possible
(Yan, 2016). The primary challenge for learning
in the lexically scaled MaxEnt framework is to use
scales sparingly. This requires a strong pressure to
set weights exactly to zero, which an L1 prior pro-
vides. L2 priors favor solutions with small weights
distributed across many parameters; setting weights
to zero is not generally the optimal solution.

In experiments with an L2 prior, we found there
was no weighting of the prior that simultaneously
eliminated weights from the scales in languages
without exceptionality while satisfactorily account-
ing for the training data. An example of the weights
learned for the Variable language with a weak L2
prior is shown in Table (6). These weights were
learned using the standard L-BFGS-B optimizer
(Byrd et al., 1995) and the objective function in (5).

*CCC MAX ALIGN
General Weights 3.00 0.00 2.50
Prefix Scales 1.00 0.00 0.80
C-Stem Scales 0.00 0.00 0.08
CC-Stem Scales 0.01 0.01 0.00

Table 6: Variable weights and mean scales, L2 prior, �2 = 1

While predicted probabilities for trained C-stems
and CC-stems fit the training data well (Tableau 6),
the model makes wide-spread use of scales: all mor-
phemes use scales to some degree even though the
Variable language does not require them. Conse-
quently, the weight of ALIGN is not high enough
to predict (near) categorical deletion for C-stems.
The wide-spread use of scales also prevents the
model from generalizing the rate of deletion to novel
forms: deletion is predicted to apply more fre-
quently to novel forms. Using a stronger prior (low-
ering �), all weights and scales decrease, but weight
remains on the scales and the fit with the training
data deteriorates. Thus, the L2 prior fails to pre-
dict frequency-matching behavior for free variation,

98



predicting skews not only for lexically-conditioned
variation (as predicted by the L1 prior) but also for
patterns without lexical conditioning.

As discussed earlier, we characterized successful
learning in terms of feature selection, using scales
only when needed to capture lexical conditioning,
and we have shown that the L2 prior does not suc-
ceed on this criterion, affecting generalization of cat-
egorical, lexicalized, and freely variable processes.
However, the extent to which language users encode
predictable properties of lexical items is not known,
and further behavioral research is needed to under-
stand whether and how generalization of variable
and exceptional processes is skewed.

5.2 No extra penalty for scales
We found that a general L1 prior was sufficient
for keeping the model from overusing scales and
generalizing beyond the data. The objective func-
tion penalizes weights and scales equally, but scales
are more costly when many morphemes require the
same scaling. Thus, the pressure against scales fol-
lows automatically from their limited utility in the
grammar. This contrasts with other approaches to
MaxEnt learning of exceptionality, which require ei-
ther additional priors on some constraints to ensure
that the model generalizes (Pater et al., 2012) or dis-
tinct phases of learning for general and lexical gen-
eralizations (Nazarov, 2018; Shih, 2018).

5.3 Multiple correct solutions
We also found that, when lexical exceptionality is
present, there are multiple correct solutions for a
given problem with different predictions about gen-
eralization. Any model that is tasked with learning
both general and exceptional patterns must decide

which items in the lexicon are the exceptions and
which represent the generalizable pattern. We found
that the objective function for our model favors over-
extending clear majority patterns, but is more am-
bivalent about what to treat as exceptional given bal-
anced data (§3.3). This ambivalence was modulated
by the strength of the prior (§4.1) and the presence
of related processes in the data (§4.2).

5.4 Future work
A number of avenues for future work remain.
As mentioned in §2, the differences between this
approach and lexically indexed constraints (Pater,
2010) remain to be explored, as do differences from
alternative models for learning variability and ex-
ceptionality (Nazarov, 2018; Shih, 2018). Another
natural continuation of this research is to apply the
learning paradigm described here to more realis-
tic datasets. Following Pater (2007), Linzen et
al. (2013, 489) limit scales to only penalizing ex-
ponents of the morphemes they are associated with.
This locality condition will be important to incorpo-
rate before exploring more complex datasets.

Further investigations of the effect of the prior on
generalization are needed. While we investigated
the consequences of varying C, our focus was lim-
ited to the Lexical language. We found that the data
distribution, the strength of the prior, and the exis-
tence of related processes in the language already
introduce strong pressures on the learner’s encoding
of exceptionality. In some cases, however, we found
the proposed prior did not uniquely favor a single
solution. Ultimately, these and other modeling deci-
sions require an understanding of how humans per-
form under similar learning conditions. Connections
with experimental work on how humans generalize
variable and exceptional patterns is crucial to defin-
ing desirable behavior for any learning model.

6 Conclusion

This paper introduces and tests a method for learn-
ing lexically scaled MaxEnt grammars. We show
that an L1 prior places strong constraints on the en-
coding of exceptionality and identify a number of
factors that affect the model’s performance on train-
ing data and generalizations to nonce forms, which
can be tested against human behavior.
