Abstract

In the fourth edition of the WMT Biomedical
Translation task, we considered a total of six
languages, namely Chinese (zh), English (en),
French (fr), German (de), Portuguese (pt), and
Spanish (es). We performed an evaluation of
automatic translations for a total of 10 lan-
guage directions, namely, zh/en, en/zh, fr/en,
en/fr, de/en, en/de, pt/en, en/pt, es/en, and
en/es. We provided training data based on
MEDLINE abstracts for eight of the 10 lan-
guage pairs and test sets for all of them. In ad-
dition to that, we offered a new sub-task for the
translation of terms in biomedical terminolo-
gies for the en/es language direction. Higher
BLEU scores (close to 0.5) were obtained for
the es/en, en/es and en/pt test sets, as well as
for the terminology sub-task. After manual
validation of the primary runs, some submis-

sions were judged to be better than the refer-
ence translations, for instance, for de/en, en/es
and es/en.

1 Introduction

Machine translation (MT) holds the promise to un-
lock access to textual content in a wide range of
languages. In the biomedical domain, the bulk
of the literature is available in English, which
provides two interesting applications for machine
translation: first, providing patients, scientists and
health professionals with access to the literature
in their native language and second, assisting sci-
entist and health professionals in writing reports
in English, when it is not their primary language.
Furthermore, important health information can be
found in the free text of electronic health records
and social media. As these sources are increas-
ingly available to patients and health profession-
als, MT can be leveraged to widen access beyond



30

language barriers. Other situations in the health
care domain, such as emergency response commu-
nications, have expressed the need for translation
technologies to improve patient-provider commu-
nication (Turner et al., 2019). However, the recur-
ring conclusion of practical studies is that progress
is still needed. The goal of this shared task is to
bring machine translation of biomedical text to a
level of performance that can help with these med-
ical challenges.

In recent years, many parallel corpora in the
biomedical domain have been made available,
which are valuable resources for training and eval-
uating MT systems. Examples of such corpora
include Khresmoi (Dušek et al., 2017), Scielo
(Neves et al., 2016), Full-Text Scientific Articles
from Scielo (Soares et al., 2018a), MeSpEn (Vil-
legas et al., 2018), thesis and dissertations (Soares
et al., 2018b), and clinical trials (Neves, 2017).
These corpora cover a variety of language pairs
and document types, such as scientific articles,
clinical trials, and academic dissertations.

Many previous efforts have addressed MT for
the biomedical domain. Interesting previous work
includes a comparison of performance in biomed-
ical MT to Google Translate for English, French,
German, and Spanish (Wu et al., 2011). Pecina
et al. applied MT for the task of multilingual in-
formation retrieval in the medical domain (Pecina
et al., 2014). They compared various MT sys-
tems, including Moses, Google Translate, and
Bing Translate. Later, Pecina et al. utilized domain
adaptation of statistical MT for English, French
and Greek (Pecina et al., 2015). The field of MT
has experienced considerable improvements in the
performance of systems, and this is also the case
for biomedical MT. Our more recent shared tasks
show an increasing number of teams that relied
on neural machine translation (NMT) to tackle the
problem (Jimeno Yepes et al., 2017; Neves et al.,
2018).

We found some commonalities in the work
above. On the one hand, clinical vocabularies are
under development, as well as data sets based on
scientific publications. On the other hand, there
is little or no work on languages that do not have
typical Indo-European morphology, e.g. in the iso-
lating direction (no Chinese), and in the aggluti-
nating direction (no Hungarian, Turkish, Finnish,
Estonian). There is also little previous research in
MT for electronic health records (EHR).

The translation of technical texts requires con-
siderable specific knowledge, not only about lin-
guistic rules, but also about the subject of the text
that is being translated. The advantage of termi-
nology management can be seen in its important
role in the process of acquiring, storing and apply-
ing linguistic and subject-specific knowledge re-
lated to the production of the target text.

Terminologies can also be extremely useful in
data mining pipelines, where one might be inter-
ested in identifying specific terms or diseases, for
example. In addition, terminologies can be used
to improve the quality of machine translation and
help in the normalization of vocabulary use. Ter-
minological resources in the field of biomedicine
and clinic are of crucial importance for the de-
velopment of natural language processing systems
and language technologies in the field of health,
among them the semantic network called Unified
Medical Language System (UMLS). This resource
contains terminological subsets of a wide variety
of subject areas and specialties such as health sci-
ences, life sciences and pharmacology.

For instance, at present only 13% of the con-
cepts included in UMLS have entries for Spanish,
while the vast majority of concepts have an equiv-
alent in English. Therefore, one of the coverage
expansion strategies is based on the translation of
terms related to UMLS entries from English into
Spanish.

Over the past three years, the aim of the biomed-
ical task at WMT has been to focus the attention of
the community on health as a specialized domain
for the application of MT (Bojar et al., 2016; Ji-
meno Yepes et al., 2017; Neves et al., 2018). This
forum has provided a unique opportunity to re-
view existing parallel corpora in the biomedical
domain and to further develop resources in lan-
guage pairs such as English and Chinese, French,
Spanish, Portuguese (Névéol et al., 2018).

In this edition of the shared task, we contin-
ued this effort and we addressed five language
pairs in two translation directions, as follows: Chi-
nese/English (zh/en and en/zh), French/English
(fr/en and en/fr), German/English (de/en and
en/de), Portuguese/English (pt/en and en/pt), and
Spanish/English (es/en and en/es). Herein we de-
scribe the details of the fourth edition of the WMT
Biomedical Task which includes the following:

• construction of training data and the official
test sets, including statistics and an evalua-



31

tion of the quality of the test sets (Section 2);

• a description of the three baselines that we
developed for comparison (Section 3);

• an overview of the participating teams and
their systems (Section 4);

• the results obtained by the submitted runs
based on our automatic evaluation (Sec-
tion 5);

• the results of the manual evaluation of se-
lected translations from each team (Sec-
tion 6);

• and a discussion of various topics, especially
the quality of the test sets and of the au-
tomatic translations submitted by the teams
(Section 7).

2 Training and Test Sets

We made training and test sets available to sup-
port participants in the development and evalu-
ation of their systems. We provided two types
of test set, scientific abstracts from Medline and
terms from biomedical terminologies. Both data
and test sets are available for download.1 Table 1
provides some basic characteristics of the training
and test sets, and we provide details of their con-
struction in this section.

2.1 Medline training and test sets

We provided training data based on Medline data
for eight of the language pairs that we addressed,
namely, fr/en, en/fr, de/en, en/de, pt/en, en/pt,
es/en, and en/es. We released test sets for all 10
language pairs, which are the official test sets used
for the shared task. The creation of the Medline
training and test sets was as follows.

Document retrieval. For the training data, we
downloaded the Medline database2 that included
the citations available until the end of 2018. For
the test sets, we downloaded the Medline update
files available for 2019 until the end of February.

com/drive/u/0/folders/

2https://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/
download/pubmed_medline.html

XML parsing. We parsed the Medline files us-
ing a Python XML library.3 Based on the meta-
data available, we selected the citations that con-
tained abstracts both in English and in at least one
of the foreign languages addressed in the shared
task, namely, Chinese (zh), French (fr), German
(de), Portuguese (pt), and Spanish (es).

Language detection. Even though the citations
in Medline include the language of the abstracts,
we found some mistakes in the data from last
year in which some abstracts were tagged with
the wrong language, e.g. Italian instead of Ger-
man. Therefore, we automatically detected the
language of the article using the Python langde-
tect library.4 For instance, when building the train-
ing data, we detected a total of 156 abstracts that
were identified with the wrong language. For the
training data, this was the data that was released
to the participants after removal of the abstracts in
the wrong language. When building the test sets,
we kept only 100 articles for each language pair,
i.e. 50 articles for each direction es/en and en/es.

Sentence splitting. For the test sets, we consid-
ered only the abstracts in the Medline citations and
segmented them into sentences, which is a neces-
sary step for automatic sentence alignment. For
all language pairs except for zh/en, we used the
syntok Python library5. For zh/en, we used Ling-
Pipe’s Medline-specific API6 to segment the En-
glish abstracts. Splitting the Chinese ones by the
language-specific period punctuation “。” (using
our own script) was sufficient.

Sentence alignment. For the test sets in all lan-
guage pairs except for zh/en, we automatically
aligned the sentences using the GMA tool.7 We re-
lied on the same configuration and stopword lists
used for the test sets in 2018 (Neves et al., 2018).
For zh/en, we used the Champollion tool8, also
relying on the same configurations and stopword
lists used in 2018.

Manual validation. We performed a manual
validation of the totality of the aligned sentences
in the test sets using the Quality Checking task in

the Appraise tool. We present statistics concern-
ing the quality of the test set alignments in Table 2.

For each test sets of each language pair, we re-
leased the abstracts in the source language and
kept the ones in the target language for the both the
automatic and manual evaluations, the so-called
“reference translations”. For instance, for the test
set for de/en, we released the abstracts in German
to the participants during the evaluation period and
kept the ones in English for the evaluation.

2.2 Terminology

For the terminology dataset, a total of 6624 terms
in English were manually translated to Spanish by
domain experts. The terms were extracted from
the scientific literature using the DNorm (Leaman
et al., 2013) Named Entity Recognition and medi-
cal glossaries.

3 Baselines

Baseline 1: Marian NMT
This represents a low-experience, minimal effort
submission based on current methods. We de-
velop “baseline1” using the tutorial written for the
MT Marathon 2018 Labs9 and the Marian NMT
framework (Junczys-Dowmunt et al., 2018).

As training data we used the UFAL medical cor-
pus (UFA), and as validation data we used Khres-
moi (Dušek et al., 2017). The Khresmoi data did
not overlap with the UFAL corpus, despite be-
ing mentioned as one of the sources. The UFAL
corpus was filtered to remove lower quality data.
Specifically, we removed the “Subtitles” subset, as
it is of lower quality than the rest, less medically
oriented (if at all), and contains dialogue rather

9https://marian-nmt.github.io/
examples/mtm2018-labs

than narrative. Two of the targeted languages, Por-
tuguese and Chinese, are not present in UFAL. For
Portuguese we therefore trained our model on the
Scielo corpus (Neves et al., 2016) and tested on
the Brazilian thesis corpus (Soares et al., 2018b).
For Chinese we used the United Nations Parallel
Corpus (Ziemski et al., 2016).

The data was preprocessed using standard tools
from the Moses toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007): to-
kenisation, cleaning of training data and truecas-
ing. Subword segmentation (Sennrich et al., 2015)
was then trained jointly over both source and tar-
get languages and applied using FastBPE.10 The
number of merge operations for BPE was set to
85000.

The models trained were shallow RNN encoder-
decoders.11 They were trained on a GTX 1080 Ti
with 8 GPUs. Validation using cross-entropy and
BLEU was performed every 10,000 updates, and
models were trained until there was no improve-
ment on either metric for 5 consecutive updates.
Training of a single model took approximately 2
days.
Discussion. Compared to the traditional domain
of news translation, biomedical MT poses addi-
tional challenges; biomedical texts contain a large
amount of specialised, in-domain vocabulary, and
in-domain training data is less readily available.

Baselines 2 and 3: OpenNMT
We also provide two additional baselines trained
using OpenNMT-py (Klein et al., 2017)12, one
with a small network size, and a second one with
a higher number of hidden units. The data used

10https://github.com/glample/fastBPE
111 encoder layer, 1 decoder layer, both with with GRU

cells, embedding dimension of 512, hidden state of dimen-
sion 1024, using layer normalization, implemented using
Marian NMT and trained using the Adam optimizer.

for training was the Medline abstracts corpora. We
trained these two baselines using the following pa-
rameters:

• 2-layer LSTM for both the encoder and de-
coder (300 and 500 hidden units)

• Vocabulary size: 32,000
• Training steps: 100,000
• Batch size: 64
• Optimization: SGD
• Dropout: 0.3
• Embedding size: 500

The models were trained on a PC with In-
tel Xeon E-2124 processor and NVIDIA GeForce
GTX 1060 GPU and are available for download.13

4 Teams and Systems

This year, the task attracted the participation of 11
teams from six countries (China, Germany, Japan,
Pakistan, Spain and United Kingdom) from two
continents. As opposed to previous years, no team
from the Americas participated in the task. We list
the teams and their affiliation (where available) in
Table 3. We received a total of 59 run submissions
as presented in Table 4.

System descriptions were solicited by email
from the participating teams in the form of a sys-
tem paper and a summary paragraph. Below we
provide a short description of the systems for
which a corresponding paper is available or for
which we received a description from the partic-
ipants. Two teams (‘peace’ and ‘Radiant’) did not
provide system descriptions.

Table 5 provides an overview of the methods,
implementations and training corpora used by the
participants. While two teams used the statisti-
cal machine translation toolkit Moses (MT-UOC-
UPF and UHH-DS), the most popular translation

1310.6084/m9.figshare.8094119

method relied on neural networks and the trans-
former architecture.

ARC (Wei et al., 2019). The ARC team’s sys-
tems were based on the Transformer-big archi-
tecture (Vaswani et al., 2017). The relied on
both general (news translation task, OPUS, UM,
Wikipedia) and in-domain (EMEA, UFAL, Med-
line) corpora. For en/zh, they also used in-house
training data. In order to improve the overall
training data quality, they filtered noisy and mis-
aligned data, and to improve vocabulary coverage
they trained their subword segmentation model on
the BERT multilingual vocabulary. They experi-
mented with over 20 different models with vari-
ous combinations of training data and settings and
chose the best ones when submitting their runs.

BCS (Soares and Krallinger, 2019). The
team’s systems were also based on the
Transformer-big architecture, which were trained
using the OpenNMT-py toolkit. They relied on
resources from both the general domain (books
corpus), as well as from the biomedical domain,
such as parallel terminologies from UMLS and
various corpora (Scielo, UFAL medical, EMEA,
theses and dissertations abstracts, and the Virtual
Health Library).

KU. The KU team’s systems were based on
the Transformer-big architecture, trained using
the Tensor2Tensor toolkit (Vaswani et al., 2018).
Training data was carefully cleaned to remove en-
coding errors, bad translations, etc. They did not
perform standard ensemble translation, but ob-
tained a small BLEU improvement by taking a
“majority vote” on the final translations for differ-
ent checkpoints.

MT-UOC-UPF. The MT-UOC-UPF team’s sys-
tems were deep RNN-based encoder-decoder
models with attention, trained using Marian (and
with layer normalisation, tied embeddings and

residual connectors). The systems were trained
with several medical corpora and glossaries. For
the terminology translation task, they trained a
Moses system using the same corpus as for the
Marian NMT system. The translation table was
queried for the English terms and when they were
not found, they were translated using the NMT
system if all subwords in the term were known and
with the SMT Moses system if not.

NRPU (Noor-e-Hira et al., 2019). The NRPU
team applied transfer learning and selective data
training to build NMT systems. The goal of
their approach is to mine biomedical data from
general domain corpus and show its efficacy for
the biomedical domain. The books corpus was
used as the main out-of-domain corpus. News-
Commentary (NC) (Tiedemann, 2012) was used
as general domain corpus to perform informa-
tion retrieval for selective data selection. The
data selection procedure was performed as re-
ported in Abdul-Rauf et al. (2016). In-domain
MEDLINE titles were used as queries to retrieve
biomedical related sentences from the general do-
main NC corpus. They had a total of 627,576
queries for data selection. Top n (1<n<10) rel-
evant sentences were ranked against each query.
The data selection process was done on both
French and English.

OOM. Their system was based on the Trans-
former architecture trained on various parallel and
monolingual corpora from in-domain and out-of-
domain corpora. In the fine-tuning phase, the
models were first tuned with the in-domain data
and then fine-tuned with a curriculum learning
mechanism for several rounds. Several model in-
stances were ensembled to generate the transla-
tion candidates followed by a re-ranking model
to select the best one. In addition to the stan-
dard sentences used in the training, terminological
resources such as MedDRA were used as a con-
straint in the decoding phase to keep translation
accuracy and consistency of key words.

Talp upc (Pio Carrino et al., 2019). The
Talp upc team’s submission was based on a Trans-
former and on the BabelNet multilingual se-
mantic dictionary (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012).
From the Medline training data, they extracted
a list of biomedical terms. They proposed bpe-
terms segmentation, which consists of segment-
ing sentences as a mixture of subwords and term

tokens in order to take into account domain-
specific terms. They experimented with three sys-
tems: (i) terminology-aware segmentation (run2
for es/en and run2 for en/es), (ii) terminology-
aware segmentation with a word-level domain
feature (run3 for es/en and run1 for en/es),
and (iii) terminology-aware segmentation, shared
source and target vocabularies and shared encoder-
decoder embedding weights (run1 for es/en and
run3 for en/es).

UCAM (Saunders et al., 2019). The UCAM
team relied on transfer learning and used the
Tensor2Tensor implementation of the Transformer
model. For each language pair, they used the same
training data in both directions. Regarding train-
ing data, for en/de and de/en, they reused gen-
eral domain models trained on the WMT19 news
data and biomedical data (UFAl and Medline). For
es/en and en/es, they trained on Scielo, UFAL,
and Medline. Their three runs use the following:
(i) the best single system trained on biomedical
data, (ii) a uniform ensemble of models on two
en/de and three es/en domains, and (iii) an ensem-
ble with Bayesian Interpolation.

UHH-DS. The team submitted three runs for
the Spanish-English language pair. Their SMT
systems were developed using the Moses toolkit
(Koehn et al., 2007) and trained on the same data
as their submission from last year. Data selection
was used to sub-sample two general domain cor-
pora using a ratio of 50% sentences. Detailed de-
scriptions of the methods are presented in (Duma
and Menzel, 2016a) (run 1), (Duma and Menzel,
2016b) (run2) and (Duma and Menzel) (run 3).
The first two methods rely on Paragraph Vector
(Le and Mikolov, 2014) for sentence representa-
tion and scoring formulas based on the cosine sim-
ilarity, and the third method focuses on the relative
differences between term frequencies. All meth-
ods are unsupervised and produce fast results.

5 Automatic Evaluation

For each language pair, we compared the sub-
mitted translations to the reference translations.
BLEU scores were calculated using the MULTI-
EVAL tool and tokenization as provided in Moses.
For Chinese, character-level tokenization was used
via a minor modification to the tool. Although
an ideal tokenization would take into account that
Chinese words consist of a varying number of



36

characters, achieving such an ideal tokenization
requires a sophisticated dictionary (Chang et al.,
2008) – including biomedical terms – and is be-
yond the scope of this shared task. Further, using
character-level tokenization for BLEU purposes is
in accordance with current practice (Wang et al.,
2018; Xu and Carpuat, 2018).

Table 6 shows BLEU scores for all language
pairs when considering all sentences in our test
sets. Table 7 only considers the sentences that
have been manually classified as being correctly
aligned (cf. Section 2). As expected, certain
results improve considerably (by more than 10
BLEU points) when only considering the sen-
tences that are correctly aligned.

Most teams outperformed the three baselines,
except the NRPU team’s submissions for en/fr
and fr/en. Baseline1, trained using Marian NMT,
obtained results not far behind the best performing
team, while the two other baselines were not very
competitive. We rank the various runs according
to the results that they obtained followed by a
short discussion of the results with regard to the
methods that they used.

• de/en: baseline2,3 < baseline1 < UCAM,
ARC

• en/de: baseline2,3 < baseline1 < UCAM,
ARC

• es/en: baseline2,3 < baseline1 < UHH-DS
< MT-UOC-UPF < BSC, Talp upc runs2,3
< Talp upc run1 < UCAM

• en/es: baseline2,3 < baseline1 < MT-UOC-
UPF < Talp upc, BSC < UCAM

• en/fr: baseline2,3 < NRPU < baseline1, KU
< ARC runs2,3 < ARC run1

• fr/en: baseline2,3 < NRPU < baseline1 <
ARC

• pt/en: baseline2,3 < baseline1 < BSC

• en/pt: baseline2,3 < baseline1 < BSC

• zh/en: baseline1 < peace < KU < ARC <
OOM

• en/zh: Radiant < peace < ARC < OOM

de/en. All submitted runs from both ARC and
UCAM teams outperformed our three baselines.
The runs from ARC were slightly superior to those
from UCAM. Both teams used Transformer mod-
els but the ARC also used BERT multilingual
embeddings. We observed no significant differ-
ence between the submissions from team ARC but
runs based on the ensemble of models from team
UCAM (i.e. runs 2 and 3) obtained a higher score
than their single best systems.

en/de. Results were similar to those for en/de:
the runs from team ARC outperformed the runs
from team UCAM. Similarly, we observed no dif-
ference between the runs from team ARC and
slightly higher scores for the runs based on ensem-
ble systems from team UCAM.

es/en. All submitted runs outperformed our
baselines. The best performing systems from the
Talp upc, UCAM, and BSC teams were Trans-
former models, the one based on Marian NMT
from the MT-UOC-UPF team, an finally the SMT
Moses systems from UHH-DS. We did not ob-
serve significant differences between the various
runs from single teams, except for run1 from
Talp upc team (terminology-aware segmentation,
shared source and target vocabularies and shared
encoder-decoder embedding weights), which out-
performed their other two runs.

en/es. All submitted runs outperformed our
baselines. As opposed to results for en/es, the
Transformer system from the UCAM team slightly
outperformed the one developed by the Talp upc
team, which obtained a similar performance to the
OpenNMT system from the BSC team.

fr/en. Baselines 2 and 3 were outperformed by
all submitted runs, whereas baseline 1, which is
trained using Marian, was only outperformed by
team ARC, whose system uses the Transformer
model. We observed no significant difference be-
tween the three runs from the ARC team.

en/fr. Similar to fr/en, baselines 2 and 3 were
outperformed by all submitted runs, while base-
line 1 was similar to the run from the KU team,
which uses the Transformer model. All runs from
the ARC team outperformed our baseline 1. Run1
from the ARC performed significantly better than
the other two runs, although details about the dif-
ference between the runs do not seem to be avail-
able.



37

pt/en. The run from the BSC team based on
OpenNMT performed slightly better than baseline
1. However, their performance was far superior to
baselines 2 and 3, which were also trained using
OpenNMT but only trained on the Medline train-
ing data.

en/pt. Results for en/pt from the BSC were al-
most 10 points higher than the ones for pt/en. The
run from the BSC team based on OpenNMT out-
perfomed with some difference the baseline based
on Marian NMT, maybe because of the many re-
sources that the team trained its system on. Fur-
ther, they were much superior to the baselines 2
and 3 also based on OpenNMT but only trained
on the Medline training data.

zh/en. All submitted runs outperformed the
only baseline that we prepared. The three
best-performing teams’s submissions were Trans-
former models. The system developed by the
OOM team slightly outperformed ARC’s submis-
sion. Little difference in the results for the runs for
the two teams was observed. A significant differ-
ence, however, was observed between results from
the ARC and OOM teams and the Transformer
system of the KU team.

en/zh. The Transformer-based system from
team OOM significantly outperformed the trans-
former systems of team ARC. The latter had a
similar performance to the runs for the other two
teams (Radiant and peace) for which we do not
know the details.

Table 8 presents the results of the automatic
evaluation of the terminology test set. The eval-
uation considered the accuracy of translation (on
lower-cased terms), rather than BLEU. The choice
of accuracy was due to the fact that the terms are
usually very short and having at least one different
word from the reference translation can lead to a
complete different meaning.

6 Manual Evaluation

For the Medline test sets, we performed manual
evaluation of the primary runs, as identified by the
participants, for all teams and language pairs. We
carried out pairwise comparisons of translations
taken either from a sample of the translations from
the selected primary runs or the reference transla-
tions. Specifically, sets of translation pairs, con-
sisting of either two automatic translations for a

given sentence (derived from submitted results), or
one automatic translation and the reference trans-
lation for a sentence, were prepared for evaluation.
Table 9 presents the primary runs that we consid-
ered from each team. We performed a total of 62
validations of pairwise datasets.

We relied on human validators who were na-
tive speakers of the target languages and who
were either members of the participating teams
or colleagues from the research community. We
also preferred to use validators who were familiar
enough with the source language so that the orig-
inal text could be consulted in case of questions
about the translations, and for most language pairs
this was the case.

We carried out the so-called 3-way ranking task
in our installation of the Appraise tool (Feder-
mann, 2010).14. For each pairwise dataset, we
checked a total of 100 randomly-chosen sentence
pairs. The validation consisted of reading the two
translation sentences (A and B) and choosing one
of the options listed below:

• A<B: the quality of translation B is higher
than translation A;

• A=B: both translations have similar quality;

• A>B: the quality of translation A was higher
than translation B;

• Flag error: the translations do not seem to
come from the same source sentence, prob-
ably due to errors in the corpus alignment.

Table 10 summarizes the manual evaluation for
the Medline test sets. We did not perform man-
ual evaluation for any of our baselines. We ranked
the runs and reference translations among them-
selves based on the number of times that one val-
idation was carried out by the evaluators. When
the superiority of a team (or reference translation)
over another team was not very clear, we decided
to put both of them together in a block without the
“lower than” sign (<) between them. However, in
these situations, the items are listed in ascending
order of possible superiority in relation to the oth-
ers. The various runs were ranked as listed below:

• de/en: reference, ARC, UCAM

• en/de: UCAM < ARC < reference

The ranks for the manual validation were usu-
ally consistent with the ones that we obtained for
the automatic validation. We discuss differences
that we found in the discussion of the results for
each language pair below.

de/en. The reference translations and the runs
from teams ARC and UCAM were of similar qual-
ity and we did not observe huge differences be-
tween them. For this reason, we have grouped
them into a single block, ordering them accord-
ing to increasing performance. The UCAM team’s
submission was seen to be marginally better than
the reference translations (33 vs. 23). We did not
observe any differences in the respective order of
teams compared to that of the automatic evalua-
tion.

en/de. The reference translation was clearly su-
perior to the runs from the ARC and UCAM teams
(41 vs. 19, and 44 vs. 16, respectively). The
translations from the ARC submission were more
frequently judged better than the ones from the
UCAM team (37 vs. 16). While we found no sig-
nificant difference in the BLEU scores for teams
ARC and UCAM, the manual evaluation showed
that translations from team ARC were of superior
quality to those of team UCAM.

en/es. The runs from the MT-UOC-UPF and
BSC teams were judged as of similar quality to
the reference translations, while the ones from
Talp upc and UCAM were deemed superior to the
reference translations. The manual validation did
not indicate much difference between runs from
teams BSC, Talp upc and UCAM. The ranking
of the teams did not change significantly between
that of the automatic evaluation.

en/fr. The reference translations were clearly su-
perior to the runs from the KU and the NRPU
teams, however, they were found only marginally
superior to the ARC run. We therefore decided
to put the ARC runs and reference translations
in a single block. As for the comparison of the
ARC runs to the KU and NRPU runs, superiority
of ARC was higher when compared to the NRPU
team (82 vs. 2) than for team KU (42 vs. 21). In-
deed, the translations from the KU team were vali-
dated as far superior (73 vs. 9) to team NRPU. We
did not observe any differences in the ranking of
teams with respect to the automatic evaluation.

en/zh. We could not rank the runs from the vari-
ous teams because of inconsistencies when com-
paring results from the various pairwise valida-
tions. For instance, the translations from the OOM
team were judged better than the the reference
translations, and the latter better that the ones from
the ARC team. However, the translation from the
ARC team were considered better than the ones
from the OOM team. We also found differences in
the rankings found in the automatic validation. For
instance, the team that obtained the lowest BLEU
scores (peace), had their translation judged to be
as good as the ones from the Radiant and OOM
teams, two of the teams that obtained high BLEU
scores.

en/pt. The translations from the BSC team were
validated as slightly superior (29 vs. 25) to the ref-
erence translations. We therefore grouped both of
them in a single block.

es/en. The reference translations were judged as
of similar quality to the ones from the Talp upc
teams, followed by the translations from the BSC
and UCAM teams. The only difference to the
ranking from the automatic evaluation was that
the runs from the Talp upc were considered better
than those from the UCAM team while the latter
obtained a higher BLEU score.

fr/en. The reference translations were consis-
tently validated as superior to the one from team
NRPU’s submissions, whereas the ones from team
ARC were judged to be better than the reference
translations.

pt/en. The reference translations were validated
as slightly superior (29 vs. 24) to the ones from
team BSC. Therefore, we grouped both of them in
a single block.

zh/en. Only the translation from the OOM team,
the runs that obtained the highest BLEU scores,
were judged as of similar quality to the reference
translations. The only main difference compared
to the ranking from the automatic translation was
with regard to team peace’s submission, which ob-
tained the lowest BLEU score, but for which the
translations were ranked higher than the ones from
the KU team and of similar quality to the ARC
team according to the manual evaluation.

7 Discussion

In this section we discuss important topics related
to the shared task, such as a short analysis of best
performing methods, lack of sufficient resources
for some language pairs and the quality of the test
sets and the submitted translations.

7.1 Analysis of results and methods

Across all language pairs, the best performing runs
were those based on the Transformer architecture
trained on as much data as possible from the gen-
eral and biomedical domain (cf. the submissions
by the ARC, Talp upc, and UCAM teams). En-
sembled runs tended to perform well and gen-

erally outperformed using the single best system
(cf. OOM, Talp upc, and UCAM).

Differences in the amount of training data avail-
able across languages appeared to have a direct
impact on translation quality. The Scielo and
Medline corpora are larger for es/en and en/es
than for the other languages, which is reflected in
the BLEU scores. For example, results for team
UCAM were more than 10 points higher for es/en
and en/es than for de/en and en/de, results which
were mirrored for baseline 1.

Regarding zh/en and en/zh for which we do not
yet provide any training data, results were infe-
rior to the best-performing language pairs (es/en
and en/es), but still surprisingly good. However
the best-performing teams trained on additional
in-house data (cf. ARC’s submission), which was
not available to the community.

We compared results for this year’s shared task
in comparison to the previous year’s (Neves et al.,
2018). The addition of the Medline training data
this year resulted in an improvement for en/de
(from 24.30 to almost 28.00), but not for de/en.
Similarly, we observed no real improvement for
es/en and en/es, the highest BLEU scores for both
remained in the range of 43-45 points. However,
a considerably improvement occurred for en/fr,
whose scores increased from almost 25 to almost
40 points, and for fr/en from almost 27 to around
35 points. Finally, the scores for en/pt showed
an improvement from 43 to 49 points, while the
scores remained constant for pt/en on 46 points.

In the shared task that we organized last year
(Neves et al., 2018), for the first time certain
runs outperformed the reference translations in the

manual validation (e.g. for en/es) or were of simi-
lar quality (e.g. de/en). This year there were more
such cases (cf. Table 11), which confirms the im-
provements of the participating systems.

7.2 Quality of the test sets
To evaluate the quality of the MEDLINE test sets,
we performed an evaluation of the sentence align-
ment using Appraise to classify sentence pairs be-
tween ”OK”, “Target > Source”, “Source > Tar-
get” and ”No Alignment”. During this process,
we also noted any observation on the quality of
the reference translation. Of note for this dataset,
the reference translation is produced by the orig-
inal authors of the papers who are scientists with
likely no training in translation and whose writing
competence in the languages involved is unknown.
We can make the hypothesis that the authors have
acquired English as a second language while they
have native or near-native competence in the non
English language.

The quality of the alignment in the Medline test
sets varied from as low as around 68% (for de/en
and en/de) to as high as 84.4% (for zh/en and
en/zh). Therefore, the rate of misaligned sentences
did not vary much across the language pairs. Part
of this problem was due to incorrectly considering
the titles of the citations, when usually there is no
translation for these available in Medline.

Some of the segments assessed as correctly
aligned (”OK”) sometimes exhibited sentence seg-
mentation error that were similar in the two lan-
guages. For example, there were segments where
pairs of sentences were aligned, instead of being
split into two aligned segments.

Interestingly, except for zn/en and en/zh, we ob-
served an average of twice more sentences classi-
fied as “Target > Source” than as “Source > Tar-
get”. This might suggest that authors of the ar-

ticles might have added more information in the
English version of the article than in the version in
the foreign language.

During our manual validation of the test sets
(cf. Section 2), we identified the non-aligned sen-
tences with the specific label ‘No Alignment’.
However, almost 1/3 of these not aligned sen-
tences correspond to other issues: (a) misalign-
ment between titles to nothing or something else;
(b) misalignment of complete, different sentences
(even though these were rather rare); and (c) mis-
alignment of section+sentences wrongly aligned
to only the section name in the other language.
The latter was also sometimes classified as either
“Target > Source” or “Source > Target”. Regard-
ing these two labels, i.e., “Target > Source” and
“Source > Target”, these were often utilized for
the following situations: (a) section+sentence au-
tomatically aligned only to sentence (the opposite
of the above); (b) reference to an entity (e.g. a dis-
ease), while referred only to the pronoun (e.g. it)
in the other language; (c) mention of a particu-
lar information (e.g. a method or a time range) in
one language, while not in the other language; and
(d) the English version included notes in squared
brackets which were not part of the foreign sen-
tence.

We also identified problems in the reference
translation when performing the manual valida-
tion. Some issues were related to the sentence
splitting, for instance, p-values were often split, so
that “(p=0.5)” would be split on the “.”. In those
cases, the preceding sentence ended in “. . . (p=0.”
and the next sentence started with “5) . . . ”. Others
were related to the content of the reference trans-
lations themselves, including non-literal transla-
tions that alter the meaning of the original sen-
tence when out of context (Example 1), wrong
translations (as in Example 2) and even poor for-
matting and punctuation.

Ref: Epileptic seizures occur with unpre-
dictable frequency in unexpected place.
Correct: Epileptic seizures are unpredictable

A further problem identified was the presence of
very short sentences often formed of a single word
(e.g. titles or listed items such as “Conclusions”,
“Objective”, or “Clinical Case”), which are in gen-
eral correctly translated. Including such items for
evaluation could influence quality assessments, in-
flating the scores, since their translation is more
similar to terminology translation rather than sen-
tential translation.

7.3 Quality of the system translations

English (from Chinese). As the first year
receiving submissions addressing the Chinese
language, the overall quality of the transla-
tions was delightfully high. For an English
sentence to offer the same level of fluency,
the order of phrases is often different from
those in the source Chinese sentence. Many
of the submitted translations successfully cap-
tured this behavior, as in the example below.

估讨论的背景下解读 HRV节律。
(Order of terms: health risk, physiological
and psychological self-regulation, interpreta-
tion, HRV rhythms.)

rhythms in the context of health risk and phys-
iological and psychological self-regulatory
capacity assessment is discussed.
– Reference translation

HRV rhythms are interpreted in the context of
health risks and assessment of physiological
and psychological self-regulation.
– Translation

Errors that disrupt the meaning of the transla-
tions most are incorrectly translated biomedical
terms, presumably due to an inadequate Chinese
biomedical dictionary. For instance, 人智医
学 or anthroposophic healthcare was, based on
the literal meanings of the individual Chinese
characters making up the term, variably translated

as human intellectual healthcare, psychiatric care
and even humane healthcare. Other literal but
incorrect translations include horse’s syndrome
for 马方综合征 (Mafran’s syndrome) due to
the 马 character (a horse), and parasitic therapy
for 槲寄生疗法 (mistletoe therapy) due to 寄
生 (parasitic). In some cases, such terms, which
were presumably absent from the dictionary, were
entirely omitted in the translations.

Improvements to the translations could be made
in two areas. Firstly, singular and plural markings
could be made consistent within one translated
abstract. In Chinese, with very few exceptions,
nouns are not inflected to indicate plurality. Hence
where an earlier sentence in an abstract mentions,
for instance,两名患者 (two patients) and in a later
sentence only 患者, a correct English translation
should remain consistent with the plural patients,
not the singular patient. Secondly, non-biomedical
terms with connotations specific to scientific ab-
stracts could be more precisely translated. For in-
stance, beginning the final sentence in an abstract
with总之 would be better translated as in conclu-
sion than in general.

English (from French). The overall translation
quality was high for this language direction, and
it was often difficult to distinguish between the
MT output and the reference translation in terms
of quality, in some cases indicative of the good
quality of automatic translation, and in others of
the presence of problems in the reference transla-
tions themselves.

An aspect that could have contributed to a trans-
lation being considered better or worse was the
handling of complex noun phrases (e.g. case mon-
itoring versus a prepositional phrase complement
monitoring of cases). Whereas many prescrip-
tivists would prescribe the noun compound vari-
ant, these were actually often perceived to be more
natural and appropriate for academic or scientific
writing.

robust case monitoring robust monitoring of cases
stool culture results results of stool culture
treatment trajectories trajectories of treatments

pounds and prepositional phrase (PP) complements in
the fr/en manually evaluated data.

English (from German). The quality of the
translations from German to English was gen-



45

erally good. German sentences, which have a
typically different structure and word order than
English sentences, were usually re-arranged with
conjunctions and subordinate clauses in proper
written English. In a few cases, the greater con-
text of the German corpus at hand appeared to in-
fluence the translation of the individual checked
sentences, as additional information, which was
not part of the original German sentence, was in-
tegrated into the English translation. For example:

Bei 3,6% war schon einmal eine
psychosomatische Reha durchgeführt
worden und dennoch vom Konsiliararzt
eine Wiederholungsreha als sinnvoll
erachtet. Patienten, die bereits einmal
in Reha waren sind kränker und haben
mehr Fähigkeits- und Teilhabeprob-
leme.
Von 35 Patienten, bei denen der Kon-
siliararzt die Neubeantragung einer
psychosomatischen Rehabilitation
empfahl, wurde bei 13 im Verlauf der
folgenden 6 Monate ein Antrag gestellt.
– Source

Patients who had already been in
inpatient rehabilitation in the past 5
years were more severely ill and had
more severe participation problems.
– Translation

As the appraiser was blinded to the source
of the translations, it was not possible to deter-
mine if such sentences were machine-translated or
human-translated.

Pro-forms were also successfully used in the
German to English translations, such as sie to
OCT, referring to optical coherence tomography,
and In den aufgearbeiteten Fällen to In our cases.
These two examples make sense and appear to
be correctly translated. However, other pro-forms
were not, such as German er to English he in-
stead of the gender-neutral pronoun it. German
pronouns present a challenge for automated trans-
lation, as all nouns in the German language are as-
signed a gender, whereas in English, only persons
are given gendered pronouns.

While most German words were correctly trans-
lated to their English equivalents, there were some
interesting cases, ranging from completely off-
topic to understandable yet odd equivalents. For

example, the German word Möpsen (English:
pugs) was incorrectly translated many times to
seagulls or cups. Konsiliararzt (English: consul-
tant) was translated to different terms but never
correctly: siliconist or silicone doctor. Interest-
ingly, the adverb konsiliarärztlich was correctly
interpreted to describe a recommendation from a
doctor in the English translation, but unfortunately
this doctor was translated to be a silicone doctor:

Bei 64% der Patienten mit chronischen
psychischen Erkrankungen war bislang
keine psychosomatische Reha erfolgt
und auch keine Indikation gegeben.
Bei 27% wurde bislang noch keine
Rehamaßnahme durchgeführt, wurde
jetzt aber konsiliarärztlich erstmals
empfohlen.
Bei 3,6% war schon einmal eine
psychosomatische Reha durchgeführt
worden und dennoch vom Konsiliararzt
eine Wiederholungsreha als sinnvoll
erachtet.
– Source

At 27%, no rehab has been performed
yet, but has now been recommended for
the first time by a silicone doctor.
– Translation

Improvements to automated translation could
be made if translations of medical or technical
words could be constrained to the context. When
describing the torso of the human body, Rumpf
was translated to the aviation term fuselage and
Säugezeit was literally translated to mammalian
period instead of suckling period. In peculiar
yet comprehensible translations, the German be-
fragte Person was translated to repliers instead of
respondents. The English translation of Leben-
squalität was mistaken as the phonetic quality
of live instead of quality of life. On a posi-
tive note, the German false friend evtl. was in-
deed correctly translated to the English word pos-
sible. Some abbreviations were not even trans-
lated at all (AÄ, OÄ, KP), yet the procedure Ze-
mentsakroplastie (ZSP) was correctly constructed
as Cement Sacroplasty (CSP) in English. Vitien
(English: cardiac defect), which is actually Latin,
was wrongly translated to vials or vii. Overall,
German scientific and medical terms and abbrevi-



46

ations were occasionally difficult to translate cor-
rectly.

In a handful of examples, the English transla-
tions appeared to be too colloquial for a written
scientific context. This includes phrases such as
so you always have to ask about it and but there
are no studies on that and using the verb got in-
stead of received. From the appraiser’s point of
view, the origin of these phrases - automatic trans-
lation or manually curated gold standard - is not
clear.

In a few cases, the English translations, de-
spite being grammatically correct, altered the in-
tended meaning of the original German sentence.
The compound word Teilhabebeeinträchtigungen
was wrongly translated to partial impairment in-
stead of participation impairment. In another ex-
ample, a long German sentence ending in Antrag
gestellt was incorrectly interpreted to mean re-
ceived an application. The same original text was
further mistakenly interpreted in another transla-
tion to imply that the actual rehabilitation had been
started, when in fact the German original indicated
that only an application for rehabilitation had been
initiated:

Patienten, die bereits einmal in Reha
waren sind kränker und haben mehr
Fähigkeits- und Teilhabeprobleme.
Von 35 Patienten, bei denen der Kon-
siliararzt die Neubeantragung einer
psychosomatischen Rehabilitation
empfahl, wurde bei 13 im Verlauf
der folgenden 6 Monate ein Antrag
gestellt.
SCHLUSSFOLGERUNG
– Source

Of 35 patients in whom the consul-
tant recommended the reapplication
of psychosomatic rehabilitation, 13
received an application during the
following 6 months.
– Translation A

In 13 out of 35 patients who got a
recommendation for a new psychoso-
matic rehabilitation, this rehabilitation
was initiated within 6 months after the
consult.
– Translation B

Of the 35 patients in whom the sil-
icone doctor recommended a new
application for psychosomatic rehabili-
tation, 13 were applied for during the
following 6 months.
– Translation C

In fact, Translation C was the most correct about
the 13 patients, except the error that Konsiliararzt
was translated as silicone doctor.

In a last example, the words nachhaltigen Effekt
were translated to two different possibilities: sus-
tainable effect (the fact that the effect is able to be
sustained) and sustained effect (an effect that held
continuously at a certain level). There is a subtle
difference in meaning of these two English terms,
whereas the German word (nachhaltigen) could
used to describe both situations. This complicates
a straight-forward translation because the correct
interpretation heavily depends on the whole con-
text of the matter:

English (from Spanish). The translations into
English from Spanish were notably improved this
year , and judgments were much more subtle in



47

many cases. There were still a few occurrences of
untranslated words appearing in the translations,
but far fewer than in previous years.

Lexical choice was often a differentiating fac-
tor between translations, e.g. accomplish several
goals was preferred to achieving various goals.

Grammar differences were also visible, in par-
ticular for complex noun phrases, e.g. creative al-
ternatives management vs. creative management
alternatives.

Some differences in the translations hinged on
treatment of acronyms; without further context
(i.e., the expansion of the acronym) or specific do-
main knowledge it was sometimes difficult to de-
cide which acronym should be preferred.

Reference translations were sometimes clearly
identifiable due to including information from
other parts of the text outside of the focus sen-
tence, leaving out some details in the original, or
completely rephrasing an idea; in general transla-
tions more faithful to the original sentence were
preferred, as long as the translation was basically
fine.

Sometimes neither translation being compared
was ideal, and assessment came down to a judg-
ment call. For instance, comparing the two trans-
lations A: In the double cerclage, surgery time
was shorter (average 38 minutes), and the range of
motion showed improvement since the first month.
and B: In the cerclage double, the time of surgery
was shorter (average 38 minutes), and the range of
motion demonstrated improvement from the first
month., A has the more accurate grammar for dou-
ble cerclage, but from the first month is more cor-
rectly expressed. In this case, B was picked be-
cause the error in the noun phrase is easier to com-
pensate for.

Another such example was the translation of
Existen desigualdades de género en la provisión
de cuidados informales a mayores dependientes
en Gipuzkoa, mostrando las mujeres un mayor
impacto en su salud y CVRS que los hombres.
as A: There are gender inequalities in the provi-
sion of informal care to dependent older adults in
Gipuzkoa, showing that women have a greater im-
pact on their health and HRQOL than men. and B:
Gender inequalities exist in the provision of infor-
mal care to elderly dependent in Gipuzkoa, show-
ing women a greater impact on their health and
HRQL than men.. Both translations are imperfect,
however A provides a better treatment of mayores

dependientes (the dependent elderly) than B – al-
though B is close, it requires a plural dependents.
However, showing that women is not a natural way
to express the relationship between the gender in-
equalities (desigualdades de género) in the first
half of the sentence and the impact of women in
the second half; a better translation would be indi-
cating that women or with women having. On bal-
ance, though, translation A is overall more read-
able than B.

Some differences were only in relation to spac-
ing, i.e. one translation included “patients,14%”
while the other had “patients, 14%”. This sug-
gests the use of character-level modeling in the
algorithms having occasional hiccups. One par-
ticularly problematic translation was Univariate
and multivariateanalyses were performed through
a Multilayer Perceptronnetwork and a logistic re-
gression model EmpiricalBayesian penalized type
LASSO Elastic net. On the flip side, these al-
gorithms were sometimes able to correct spacing
problems in the source text.

Chinese. The quality of translations from all
four participating systems was very high, and
the translations were generally fluent and accu-
rate. When comparing the translations from the
various systems, shorter sentences were typically
highly similar, differing only in certain formula-
tions. However, such differences could suffice to
distinguish one translation as better than another,
because a wording (e.g.新努力 new efforts) more
precisely captures the source (exactly new efforts)
than alternative wordings (新进展 new develop-
ments). For longer sentences, more noticeable dif-
ferences surfaced, particularly in different order-
ings of phrases. These orderings sometimes im-
pacted the fluency of the translation, but in gener-
ally were merely different but valid arrangements
of the same content.

In terms of serious errors, only in rare cases
were phrases completely dropped in the transla-
tions. As for incorrect translation of biomedi-
cal terms, they occurred far less frequently in the
en/zh direction than zh/en. One might hypothe-
size that the dictionary in the en/zh direction was
more complete. However, the fact that translating
into Chinese has the option of retaining the orig-
inal term in English is also a contributing factor,
which leads us to the next point.

Currently there is no consensus in how much
of a technical term in English should be preserved



48

in the Chinese translation. Take Functional elec-
tronic stimulation (FES) in a source as an exam-
ple. Valid translations in Chinese include having
only the Chinese term (功能性电刺激); with the
acronym (功能性电刺激 (FES)); as well as with
full term plus acronym (功能性电刺激 (Func-
tional electronic stimulation, FES)). Gene names,
on the other hand, are uncontentiously retained in
English (e.g. AMP and CK2α in source, refer-
ence, and submitted translations alike).

German. Compared to last year again in general
translations were of very high quality. Only rarely
we found untranslated bits from the source lan-
guage, while automatic systems were mostly able
to differentiate between sequences that should be
translated or not (e.g. citations, links). The use
of capitalization was correct in almost all cases.
Therefore, the decision for a better translation was
mostly based on the correct translation of technical
terms, in general a more appropriate use of Ger-
man words or word order.

Mostly usage of technical terms was decisive:
grayscale ultrasound is Schwarz-Weiß-Ultraschall
instead of Graustufen-Ultraschall, or similarly
mandibular advancement device is a Unterkiefer-
protrusionsschiene instead of the rather word-
by-word but wrong translation mandibulären
Fortschrittsgerät. Other examples rather concern
the appropiate use of German words. For instance,
disease attenuation is rather a Abschwächung than
a Dämpfung of a disease. It seems that automatic
systems could not deal with more complex syntax
such as coordination as in tumor mass and symp-
tom reduction. Instead of Tumormassenreduktion
und Symptomlinderung, the automatic translations
did not identify the coordination structure and pro-
duces an incorrect (word-by-word) translation Tu-
mormasse und Symptomreduktion.

Similar to last year, cases when automatic sys-
tems were judged better than the reference, the ref-
erence contained additional information or missed
information while translation usually contained
the complete content of the source sentence.

We were not able to define clear patterns for
differences between the two automatic systems.
However, ARC seems to be more capable of pro-
viding proper German syntax (e.g. Steifigkeitss-
chwankungen for stiffness variation or Patienten
mit Bauchspeicheldrüsenkrebs for pancreatic can-
cer patients than UCAM. On the other hand, ARC
seems to have difficulty identifying acronyms at

the beginning of a sentence and did not keep them
all capitalized. ARC even provided a false trans-
lation for Sleep is ... unrefreshing as Schlaf ist ...
erfrischend instead of nicht erfrischend. UCAM
did not show the last two issues.

French. Although the quality of the transla-
tions was generally uneven, some systems offered
mostly fluent translations.

A number of errors were easily identified as un-
translated segments, or repeated words. However,
a category of serious errors occurred in otherwise
fluent sentences where missense or erroneous in-
formation was introduced. This is the case for ex-
ample when a significant piece of information is
omitted in the translation: We used inverse propor-
tional weighting translated by Nous avons utilisé
un facteur de pondération proportionnelle (omis-
sion de inverse) or when numbers are substituted:
data from adolescents aged 15-18 years translated
by données des adolescents âgés de 12 à 25 ans.
Arguably, in these cases, no translation would be
preferable to a translation error that could easily
go undetected.

One notable improvement over previous years
was the processing of acronyms, which were of-
ten directly expanded or translated with suitable
equivalents: for example, long-lasting insectici-
dal nets (LLINs) was translated by moustiquaires
imprégnées d’insecticide de longue durée (MILD)
or moustiquaires imprégnées à longue durée
d’action (MILDA). Further assessment should take
context beyond a single sentence into account, so
that the consistency of use of acronyms can be
evaluated over a document. It can also be noted
that in some cases, the context of a sentence is
not enough to make an assessment. For example,
the phrases Elle survient le plus souvent. . . ou Il
se développe le plus souvent. . . could be accept-
able translations for It occurs most frequently. . . ,
depending on the grammatical agreement between
Elle/Il and the translation of the antecedent.

Portuguese. As shown in the results for manual
validation (cf. table 6), the automatic translations
for Portuguese were of very good quality and of-
ten with similar or higher quality as the reference
translations. However, we still found some mis-
takes and issues. Similar to previous years, we still
find some acronyms, words or phrases (e.g. Leo
G. Reeder Award) that were not translated and
remained in the English format. We also found



49

some small mistakes when referring to particular
values or parameters from the study, usually be-
tween parenthesis. For instance, the passage “88%
para T2-0,535 cm)” instead of the complete state-
ment “88% para RM ponderada em T2 (viés =
0,52 cm2; p = 0,735)”.

We identified few terms that were trans-
lated literally into Portuguese. For intance
the term “scrub nurses” was translated into
“enfermeiros esfregadores” instead of “enfer-
meiros/instrumentadores”. In many situations,
both sentences were correct but we identified as
better the sentences that utilized a more scientific
language, more appropriate for a publication, e.g.,
“nivel de escolaridade” instead of just “escolari-
dade”. In another of such cases, we chose the
term “longevos” as more appropriate than “mais
velhos” when referring to elderly people. We also
found errors due to nominal concordance with the
number, such “dividido” when related to plural
nouns, when it should have been “divididos”.

Some mistakes were very subtle, such as the
translation shown below which includes the verb
“apresentaram” twice in the same sentence. Fur-
ther, in the translated sentence, it is not clear
whether the first instance of the verb “apresen-
taram” (present) refers just to the second or both
subjects, while this information is clear in the ref-
erence translation, i.e. that it should refer just to
“casos”. However, this ambiguity is also present
in the original English sentence.

Another subtle mistake that we found relates to
the meaning of the sentence which changed in the
translation. In the first sentence below, the subject
of the sentence is unknown, while in the second

one it is clear that the elderly people are the ones
who provide the information.

Identificar e hierarquizar as dificul-
dades referidas no desempenho das
atividades de vida diária de idosos.
– Sentence 1

culdades relatadas pelos idosos na
realização das atividades de vida
diária.
– Sentence 2

Spanish. The overall quality of the Spanish
translations was uneven across all four systems
submitted to the challenge. BSC and Talp upc
MT systems had a very good performance when
compared to the reference translation, with being
BSC the best of the four. UCAM MT’s system had
a reasonable performance but MT-UOC-UPF was
the most irregular.

Sentence structure and word order have shown
very good results in all systems for short sentences
as shown in the following example.

Isotretinoin is still the best treatment
for severe nodulocystic acne.
– Source

la isotretinoı́na todavı́a es el mejor
tratamiento para el acné noduloquı́stico
severo.
– Reference translation

La isotretinoı́na sigue siendo el mejor
tratamiento para el acné noduloquı́stico
severo.
– Translation C

However this was not the case of all sentences,
some of which followed English word order, re-
sulting in grammatical correct but unnatural sen-
tences in the target language. Other frequent prob-
lems include the handling of acronyms (e.g. EDs)
and additional information included in the refer-
ence translation that was not present in the source,
as shown in the example below. (cf. N = 480)

Ten Eds will be randomly assigned to
the intervention group and 10 to the



50

control group.

mente al grupo de intervención y 10 al

Erroneous word order translation for technical
terms has been observed resulting in mistransla-
tion of the English source (e.g. FE-IV) sentence
as shown bellow.

Additionally, system A has translated fixed-
effects instrumental-variable as efectos fijos vari-
able instrumental, that not only is a mistranslation
of this technical term, but also changes the overall
meaning of the sentence.

Subject-verb agreement mistakes have been ob-
served in some MT translations, such as the one
that follows.

Each group will enroll 480 patients,
and the outcomes will be compared
between groups.

los resultados serán comparados entre

– Translation B

Other issues found, more common in longer
sentences, are missing information in the transla-
tion or wrongly parsed and separated terms, espe-
cially if the source sentence also suffers from the
same problem.

incrementalcost per patient with

8 Conclusions

We presented the 2019 edition of the WMT shared
task for biomedical machine translation. Partici-
pants were challenged to provide automatic trans-
lations for medical texts from the literature in ten
language pairs as well as for terminology content
from English to Spanish. We prepared three base-
line systems based on neural toolkits and received
59 runs from 11 teams. Overall, submissions were
received for all test sets that were offered. Some
of the results obtained by the participants could
outperform the scores from previous editions of
the shared task and some submissions were judged
better than the reference translations created by the
authors of the papers in the test set. We also iden-
tified some limitations of this shared task, such as
issues with the quality of the test sets that we plan
to improve in the next edition of the task. Other
planned improvements include manual evaluation



51

of the submission based on direct assessment as
opposed to the current pairwise comparison of two
sentences.
