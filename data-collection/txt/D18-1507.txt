Abstract
Computational detection and understanding of
empathy is an important factor in advancing
human-computer interaction. Yet to date, text-
based empathy prediction has the following
major limitations: It underestimates the psy-
chological complexity of the phenomenon, ad-
heres to a weak notion of ground truth where
empathic states are ascribed by third parties,
and lacks a shared corpus. In contrast, this
contribution presents the first publicly avail-
able gold standard for empathy prediction. It is
constructed using a novel annotation method-
ology which reliably captures empathy assess-
ments by the writer of a statement using multi-
item scales. This is also the first computa-
tional work distinguishing between multiple
forms of empathy, empathic concern, and per-
sonal distress, as recognized throughout psy-
chology. Finally, we present experimental re-
sults for three different predictive models, of
which a CNN performs the best.

1 Introduction

Over two decades after the seminal work by Picard
(1997) the quest of Affective Computing, to ease
the interaction with computers by giving them a
sense of how emotions shape our perception and
behavior, is still far from being fulfilled. Undoubt-
edly, major progress has been made in NLP, with
sentiment analysis being one of the most vivid and
productive areas in recent years (Liu, 2015).

However, the vast majority of contributions has
focused on polarity prediction, typically only dis-
tinguishing between positive and negative feeling

* These authors contributed equally to this work. An-
neke Buffone designed and supervised the crowdsourcing
task and the survey described in Section 2, and provided psy-
chological background knowledge. Sven Buechel was re-
sponsible for corpus creation, data analysis, and modeling.
The technical set-up of the crowdsourcing task and the sur-
vey was done jointly by both first authors.

or evaluation, usually in social media postings or
product reviews (Rosenthal et al., 2017; Socher
et al., 2013). Only very recently, researchers
started exploring more sophisticated models of hu-
man emotion on a larger scale (Wang et al., 2016;
Abdul-Mageed and Ungar, 2017; Mohammad and
Bravo-Marquez, 2017a; Buechel and Hahn, 2017,
2018a,b). Yet such approaches, often rooted in
psychological theory, also turned out to be more
challenging in respect to annotation and modeling
(Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2007).

Surprisingly, one of the most valuable affec-
tive phenomena for improving human-machine
interaction has received surprisingly little atten-
tion: Empathy. Prior work focused mostly on
spoken dialogue, commonly addressing conversa-
tional agents, psychological interventions, or call
center applications (McQuiggan and Lester, 2007;
Fung et al., 2016; Pérez-Rosas et al., 2017; Alam
et al., 2017).

In contrast, to the best of our knowledge, only
three contributions (Xiao et al., 2012; Gibson
et al., 2015; Khanpour et al., 2017) previously ad-
dressed text-based empathy prediction1 (see Sec-
tion 4 for details). Yet, all of them are limited in
three ways: (a) neither of their corpora are avail-
able leaving the NLP community without shared
data, (b) empathy ratings were provided by others
than the one actually experiencing it which quali-
fies only as a weak form of ground truth, and (c)
their notion of empathy is quite basic, falling short
of current and past theory.

1 Psychological studies commonly distinguish between
state and trait empathy. While the former construct describes
the amount of empathy a person experiences as a direct result
of encountering a given stimulus, the latter refers to how em-
pathetic one is on average and across situations. This studies
exclusively addresses state empathy. For a contribution ad-
dressing trait empathy from an NLP perspective, see Abdul-
Mageed et al. (2017).

In this contribution we present the first pub-
licly available gold standard for text-based empa-
thy prediction. It is constructed using a novel an-
notation methodology which reliably captures em-
pathy assessments via multi-item scales. The cor-
pus as well as our work as a whole is also unique
in being—to the best of our knowledge—the first
computational approach differentiating multiple
types of empathy, empathic concern and personal
distress, a distinction well recognized throughout
psychology and other disciplines.2

2 Corpus Design and Methodology

Background. Most psychological theories of
empathic states are focused on reactions to neg-
ative rather than positive events. Empathy for pos-
itive events remains less well understood and is
thought to be regulated differently (Morelli et al.,
2015). Thus we focus on empathetic reactions
to need or suffering. Despite the fact that every-
one has an immediate, implicit understanding of
empathy, research has been vastly inconsistent in
its definition and operationalization (Cuff et al.,
2016). There is agreement, however, that there are
multiple forms of empathy (see below). The by far
most widely cited state empathy scale is Batson’s
Empathic Concern – Personal Distress Scale (Bat-
son et al., 1987), henceforth empathy and distress.

Distress is a self-focused, negative affective
state that occurs when one feels upset due to
witnessing an entity’s suffering or need, poten-
tially via “catching” the suffering target’s nega-
tive emotions. Empathy is a warm, tender, and
compassionate feeling for a suffering target. It is
other-focused, retains self-other separation, and is
marked by relatively more positive affect (Batson
and Shaw, 1991; Goetz et al., 2010; Mikulincer
and Shaver, 2010; Sober and Wilson, 1997).

Selection of News Stories. Two research in-
terns (psychology undergraduates) collected a to-
tal of 418 articles from popular online news plat-
forms, selected to likely evoke empathic reactions,
after being briefed on the goal and background of
this study. These articles were then used to elicit
empathic responses in participants.

Acquiring Text and Ratings. The corpus
acquisition was set up as a crowdsourcing task
on MTurk.com pointing to a Qualtrics.com
questionnaire. The participants completed back-

2Data and code are available at: https://github.
com/wwbp/empathic_reactions

ground measures on demographics and personal-
ity, and then proceeded to the main part of the sur-
vey where they read a random selection of five of
the news articles. After reading each of the ar-
ticles, participants were asked to rate their level
of empathy and distress before describing their
thoughts and feelings about it in writing.

In contrast to previous work, this set-up allowed
us to acquire empathy scores of the actual writer
of a text, instead of having to rely on an external
evaluation by third parties (often student assistants
with background in computer science). Arguably,
our proposed annotation methodology yields more
appropriate gold data, yet also leads to more vari-
ance in the relationship between linguistic features
and empathic state ratings. That is because each
rating reflects a single individual’s feelings rather
than a more stable average assessment by multi-
ple raters. To account for this, we use multi-item
scales as is common practice in psychology. I.e.,
participants give ratings for multiple items mea-
suring the same construct (e.g., empathy) which
are then averaged to obtain more reliable results.
As far as we know, this is the first time that multi-
item scales are used in sentiment analysis.3

In our case, participants used Batson’s Em-
pathic Concern – Personal Distress Scale (see
above), i.e, rating 6 items for empathy (e.g., warm,
tender, moved) and 8 items for distress (e.g., trou-
bled, disturbed, alarmed) using a 7-point scale for
each of those (see Appendix for details). After rat-
ing their empathy, participants were asked to share
their feelings about the article as they would with
a friend in a private message or with a group of
friends as a social media post in 300 to 800 char-
acters. Our final gold standard consists of these
messages combined with the numeric ratings for
empathy and distress.

In sum, 403 participants completed the survey.
Median completion time was 32 minutes and each
participant received 4 USD as compensation.

Post-Processing. Each message was manually
reviewed by the authors. Responses which devi-
ated from the task description (e.g., mere copying
from the articles at display) were removed (31 re-
sponses, 155 messages), leading to a total 1860
messages in our final corpus. Gold ratings for em-
pathy and distress were derived by averaging the
respective items of the two multi-item scales.

3 Here, we use sentiment as an umbrella term subsuming
semantic orientation, emotion, as well as highly related con-
cepts such as empathy.

E D Message

(1) 4.8 3.1 I’m sorry to hear that about Dakota’s parents. Even when you are adult it must be hard to see your parents
splitting up. No one wants that to happen and it’s unfortunate that her parents couldn’t work it out. I hope
they are able to still remain civil around the kids and family. Just because it didn’t work romantically doesn’t
mean it won’t work at all.

(2) 4.0 5.5 Here’s an article about crazed person who murdered two unfortunate women overseas. Life is crazy. I can’t
imagine what the families are going through. Having to go to or being forced into sex work is bad enough,
but for it to end like this is just sad. It feels like there’s no place safe in this world to be a woman sometimes.

(3) 1.0 1.3 I just read an article about some chowder-head who used a hammer and a pick ax to destroy Donald Trump’s
star on the Hollywood walk of fame. Wow, what a great protest. You sure showed him. Good job. Lol, can
you believe this garbage? Who has such a hollow and pathetic life that they don’t have anything better to
do with their time than commit petty vandalism because they dislike some politician? What a dingus.

empathy and distress ratings.

3 Corpus Analysis

For a first impression of the language of our new
gold standard, we provide illustrative examples in
Table 1. The participant in Example (1) displays
higher empathy than distress, (2) displays higher
distress than empathy, and (3) shows neither em-
pathic state, but employs sarcasm, colloquialisms
and social-media-style acronyms to express lack
of emotional response to the article. As can be
seen, the language of our corpus is diverse and au-
thentic, featuring many phenomena of natural lan-
guage which render its computational understand-
ing difficult, thus constituting a sound but chal-
lenging gold standard for empathy prediction.

Token Counts. We tokenized the 1860 mes-
sages using NLTK tools (Bird, 2006). In total,
our corpus amounts to 173, 686 tokens. Individual
message length varies between 52 and 198 tokens,
the median being 84. See Appendix for details.

Rating Distribution. Figure 1 displays the
bivariate distribution of empathy and distress rat-

ings. As can be seen both target variables have a
clear linear dependence, yet show only a moderate
Pearson correlation of r=.451, similar to what was
found in prior research (Batson et al., 1987, 1997).
This finding supports that the two scales capture
distinct affective phenomena and underscores the
importance of our decision to describe empathic
states in terms of multiple target variables, con-
stituting a clear advancement over previous work.
Both kinds of ratings show good coverage over the
full range of the scales.

Reliability of Ratings. Since each message
is annotated by only one rater, its author, typical
measures of inter-rater agreement are not appli-
cable. Instead, we compute split-half reliability
(SHR), a standard approach in psychology (Cron-
bach, 1947) which also becomes increasingly pop-
ular in sentiment analysis (Mohammad and Bravo-
Marquez, 2017a; Buechel and Hahn, 2018a). SHR
is computed by splitting the ratings for the indi-
vidual scale items (e.g., warm, tender, etc. for
empathy) of all participants randomly into two
groups, averaging the individual item ratings for
each group and participant, and then measuring
the correlation between both groups. This process
is repeated 100 times with random splits, before
again averaging the results. Doing so for empa-
thy and distress, we find very high4 SHR values of
r=.875 and .924, respectively.

4 Modeling Empathy and Distress

In this section, we provide experimental results for
modeling empathy and distress ratings based on
the participants’ messages (see Section 2). We ex-
amine three different types of models, varying in

ues for different emotional categories, see Mohammad and
Bravo-Marquez (2017b).

design complexity. Distinct models were trained
for empathy and distress prediction.

First, ten percent of our newly created gold
standard were randomly sampled to be used in
development experiments. Then, the main ex-
periment was conducted using 10-fold cross-
validation (CV), providing each model with iden-
tical train-test splits to increase reliability. The dev
set was excluded for the CV experiment.

Model performance is measured in terms of
Pearson correlation r between predicted values
and the human gold ratings. Thus, we phrase the
prediction of empathy and distress as regression
problems.

The input to our models is based on word
embeddings, namely the publicly available Fast-
Text embeddings which were trained on Common
Crawl (≈600B tokens) (Bojanowski et al., 2017;
Mikolov et al., 2018).

Ridge. Our first approach is Ridge regression,
an `2-regularized version of linear regression. The
centroid of the word embeddings of the words in a
message is used as features (embedding centroid).
The regularization coefficient α is automatically
chosen from {1, .5, .1, ..., .0001} during training.

FFN. Our second approach is a Feed-Forward
Net with two hidden layers (256 and 128 units, re-
spectively) with ReLU activation. Again, the em-
bedding centroid is used as features.

CNN. The last approach is a Convolutional
Neural Net.5 We use a single convolutional layer
with filter sizes 1 to 3, each with 100 output chan-
nels, followed by an average pooling layer and a
dense layer of 128 units. ReLUs were used for the
convolutional and again for the dense layer.

Both deep learning models were trained using
the Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2015) with
a fixed learning rate of 10−3 and a batch size of
32. We trained for a maximum of 200 epochs yet
applied early stopping if the performance on the
validation set did not improve for 20 consecutive
epochs. We applied dropout with probabilities of
.2, .5 and .5 on input, dense and pooling layers,
respectively. Moreover `2 regularization of .001
was applied to the weights of conv and dense lay-
ers. Word embeddings were not updated.

The results are provided in Table 2. As can be
seen, all of our models achieve satisfying perfor-
mance figures ranging between r=.379 and .444,

ment due to high sequence length.

given the assumed difficulty of the task (see Sec-
tion 3). On average over the two target vari-
ables, the CNN performs best, followed by Ridge
and the FFN. While the CNN significantly outper-
forms the other models in every case, the differ-
ences between Ridge and the FFN are not statis-
tically significant for either empathy or distress.6

The improvements of the CNN over the other two
approaches are much more pronounced for dis-
tress than for empathy. Since only the CNN is
able to capture semantic effects from composi-
tion and word order, our data suggest that these
phenomena are more important for predicting dis-
tress, whereas lexical features alone already per-
form quite well for empathy.

Discussion. In comparison to closely related
tasks such as emotion prediction (Mohammad and
Bravo-Marquez, 2017a) our performance figures
for empathy and distress prediction are generally
lower. However, given the small amount of previ-
ous work for the problem at hand, we argue that
our results are actually quite strong. This becomes
obvious, again, in comparison with emotion anal-
ysis where early work achieved correlation values
around r=.3 at most (Strapparava and Mihalcea,
2007). Yet state-of-the-art performance literally
doubled over the last decade (Beck, 2017), in part
due to much larger training sets.

Comparison to the limited body of previous
work in text-based empathy prediction is diffi-
cult for a number of reasons, e.g., differences in
domain, evaluation metric, as well as methodol-
ogy and linguistic level of annotation. Khanpour
et al. (2017) annotate and model empathy in online
health communities on the sentence-level, whereas
the instances in our corpus are much longer and
comprise multiple sentences. In contrast to our
work, they treat empathy prediction as a classifi-
cation problem. Their best performing model, a
CNN-LSTM, achieves an F-score of .78. Gibson

the results of the individual CV runs; p < .05.

et al. (2015) predict therapists’ empathy in motiva-
tional interviews. Each therapy session transcript
received one numeric score. Thus, each predic-
tion is based on much more language data than our
individual messages comprise. Their best model
achieves a Spearman rank correlation of .61 using
n-gram and psycholinguistic features.

Our contribution goes beyond both of these
studies by, first, enriching empathy prediction with
personal distress and, second, by annotating and
modeling the empathic state actually felt by the
writer, instead of relying on external assessments.

5 Conclusion

This contribution was the first to attempt empa-
thy prediction in terms of multiple target variables,
empathic concern and personal distress. We pro-
posed a novel annotation methodology capturing
empathic states actually felt by the author of a
statement, instead of relying on third-party assess-
ments. To ensure high reliability in this single-
rating setting, we employ multi-item scales in line
with best practices in psychology. Hereby we cre-
ate the first publicly available gold standard for
empathy prediction in written language, our sur-
vey being set-up and supervised by an expert psy-
chologist. Our analysis shows that the data set
excels with high rating reliability and an authen-
tic and diverse language, rich of challenging phe-
nomena such as sarcasm. We provide experimen-
tal results for three different predictive models, our
CNN turning out superior.

A Supplemental Material

Details on Stimulus and Instructions

Before being used in our survey, the selected news
articles were categorized by the research interns
who gathered them in terms of their intensity of
suffering (major or minor), cause of suffering (po-
litical, human, nature or other), patient of suffer-
ing (humans, animals, environment, or other) and
scale of suffering (individual or mass). Research
interns also provided a short list of key words for
each article. This additional information was gath-
ered to examine the influence of these factors on
empathy elicitation and modeling performance in
later studies.

At the beginning of the survey participants com-
pleted background items covering general demo-
graphics (including age, gender, and ethnicity), the
most commonly used trait empathy scale, the In-
terpersonal Reactivity Index (Davis, 1980), a brief
assessment of the Big 5 personality traits (Gosling
et al., 2003), life satisfaction (Diener et al., 1985),
as well as a brief measure of generalized trust.

After reading each of the articles, participants
rated their level of empathic concern and per-
sonal distress using multi-item scales. Figure 2

shows a cropped screenshot of the survey hosted
on Qualtrics.com. The first six items (warm,
tender, sympathetic, softhearted, moved, and com-
passionate) refer to empathy. The last eight items
(worried, upset, troubled, perturbed, grieved, dis-
turbed, alarmed, and distressed) refer to distress.

personal distress.

After completing the rating items, participants
were instructed to describe their reactions in writ-
ing as follows: Now that you have read this article,
please write a message to a friend or friends about
your feelings and thoughts regarding the article
you just read. This could be a private message to a
friend or something you would post on social me-
dia. Please do not identify your intended friend(s)
— just write your thoughts about the article as if
you were communicating with them. Please use
between 300 and 800 characters.

Further Corpus Analyses

The word clouds in Figure 3 and Figure 4 show 1-
grams of our corpus which correlate significantly
(Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p < .05) with
high empathy and high distress ratings, respec-
tively. In the word clouds, larger size indicates
higher correlation and the color scale, gray-blue-
red, indicates word frequency, dark red being most
prevalent. The Differential Language Analysis
Toolkit (Schwartz et al., 2017) was utilized for this
analysis. As can be seen, the word clouds display
high face-validity, giving further evidence for the
soundness of our acquisition methodology.

Figure 5 displays the distribution of the mes-
sage length of our corpus in tokens. As can be seen
the majority of messages contain between 60 and
100 tokens. Yet outliers go up to almost 200. The
introduction of a character cap for the writing task
proved successful in comparison to a pilot study
where this measure has not been in place. In the
latter case, the maximum number of tokens was
nearly twice as high due to even stronger outliers.
