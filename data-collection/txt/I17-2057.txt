Abstract 

It is very costly and time consuming to 

find new biomarkers for specific dis-

eases in clinical laboratories. In this 

study, to find new biomarkers most 

closely related to Chronic Obstructive 

Pulmonary Disease (COPD), which is 

widely known as respiratory disease, 

biomarkers known to be associated 

with respiratory diseases and COPD 

itself were converted into word em-

bedding. And their similarities were 

measured. We used Word2Vec, Canon-

ical Correlation Analysis (CCA), and 

Global Vector (GloVe) for word em-

bedding. In order to replace the clini-

cal evaluation, the titles and abstracts 

of papers retrieved from Google 

Scholars were analyzed and quantified 

to estimate the performance of the 

word embedding models. 

1 Introduction 

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) 

is the fourth leading cause of mortality in the 

world and the seventh in Korea. It is one of the 

most respiratory diseases in the elderly, and is 

known to be a very dangerous disease. Similar to 

asthma, COPD has symptoms of airway disorders 

such as dyspnea, cough, and sputum. COPD 

mainly exacerbates pulmonary function, leading 

to death. (Vestbo et al., 2013) 

Accordingly, research on bio-markers, which 

serve as an index for predicting the disease and 

detecting changes in the body, is underway (Ar-

onson et al., 2005). A biomarker is an index that 

can detect changes in the body using DNA, RNA, 

metabolites, proteins, and protein fragments. 

Therefore, many researchers are working hard to 

find new biomarkers that are deeply related to 

specific diseases. Recently there have been several 

attempts to extract such information from docu-

ments (Poon et al., 2014) (Poon et al., 2015). 

(Youn et al., 2016) tried to find biomarkers related 

to ovarian cancer by using word embeddings. The 

research is the base step of this paper.  

In this study, 26 respiratory-related biomarkers 

recommended by Chuncheon Kangwon National 

University Hospital1  were selected for the first 

time in order to search for bio-markers related to 

COPD. We also extracted 800,000 titles and ab-

stracts from Pubmed2 to construct word embed-

ding. Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) 

(Stratos et al., 2015), Word2vec (Mikolov et al., 

2013), and Global Vector (GloVe) (Pennington et 

al., 2014) were used as word embedding models. 

With these models, word-embeddings of COPD 

and respiratory bio-makers are acquired. The 

word embeddings of COPD and the bio-markers 

are mapped in two dimensions using t-SNE (t-

Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) 

(Maaten et al., 2008) and the result is visualized. 

The relationship between COPD and biomarkers 

are examined by measuring and comparing the 

similarity of COPD with biomarkers using cosine 

similarity. 

Clinical trials should follow to validate the 

methodology presented in this study. However, 

since this is very difficult in practice, we intend to 

test this indirectly by analyzing the results of 

Google Scholars3. In other words we analyzed the 

Google Scholars’ search results and compare the 

pairs with high scores to those with low scores to 

verify the validity of the proposed methodology. 

This paper is composed as follows. Section 2 

explains the biomarkers considered in this study. 

Section 3 explains the models used for word em-

bedding in this study. Section 4 explains the over-

cusses conclusions and future research. 

2 Bio-markers for COPD 

A biomarker is an index that can detect changes in 

the body using DNA, RNA, metabolites, proteins, 

and protein fragments. In addition, biomarkers can 

be used to effectively diagnose various diseases.  

The biomarkers listed in table 1 are known to 

be related to respiratory diseases and are included 

in the 26 markers recommended by Kangwon Na-

tional University Hospital. 

Surfactant, pulmonary-associated protein D, 

also known as SFTPD or SP-D (Lahti et al., 

2008), is a lung-related protein. In addition, SP-D 

plays an important role in lung immunity and is 

known to regulate the function of many immune 

cells. 

Clara Cell Secretory Protein (CC-16) 

(Broeckaert and Bernard, 2000) is known to be a 

protein distributed in the endocardium and the 

respiratory bronchus of the lungs and has im-

munomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. 

Interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10) 

(Dufour et al., 2002) is also known to be CXCL10 

or B10. It is involved in the Th1 immune response 

and is known to be increased in infectious diseas-

es including inflammation of the respiratory tract, 

immune disorders, and tumors. 

Interleukin 2 (IL-2) (Koreth et al., 2011) is an 

immunoreactive substance involved in anti-

inflammatory immune responses, macrophage 

function to damaged cells, and restoration of the 

original state. IL-2 plays a major role in the im-

mune system, and if production is reduced, im-

mune defense can be seriously compromised. 

In this study, 22 respiratory markers were also 

recommended and analyzed for their association 

with COPD. 

3 Word-embeddings 

Word-embedding is a technique that learns the 

vector representation of every word in a given 

Corpus. We can measure the similarity between 

several words, and perform vector computation 

with vectorized semantics to enable additional in-

ference. In this paper, we investigate the relation-

ship between COPD and its bio-markers using the 

following word-embedding models: CCA, 

Word2vec, and GloVe. 

3.1 CCA 

CCA (Hotelling and Harold, 1936) is a tech-

nique known by Hotelling (1936), which is a 

technique for examining the correlation of varia-

bles. CCA is a statistical method used to investi-

gate the relationship between two words, and it is 

a technique that simultaneously examines the cor-

relation between variables in a set and variables in 

another set. In other words, it is a useful tool to 

grasp the correlation of variable group (X, Y) and 

to grasp the relationship between two features 

(Jang et al., 2013). 

3.2 Word2vec 

Word2vec is a Google-released model in 2013. 

Word2vec has the premise that words with the 

same context have close meanings. It is also most 

commonly used to understand sentences in text. 

There are CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words) and 

Skip-grams in the learning method of the 

word2vec model. The CBOW method predicts the 

target word using the context that the surrounding 

word makes. On the other hand, skip-gram 

(Mikolov et al., 2013) predicts words that can 

come around in one word. In addition, Skip-grams 

are known to be more accurate in large datasets. 

Therefore, we use Skip-gram method in this pa-

per. 

3.3 GloVe 

GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014) stands for 

Global Vector, and it is a method of expressing a 

word as a vector using a non-local learning algo-

rithm. In addition, it is a hybrid model that con-

siders not only the global context but also the lo-

cal context of the word.

4 Methodology 

In this paper, about 800,000 papers are download-

ed from the PubMed site, and word embeddings 

are applied to only the title and abstract part of 

each paper. Since there are various expressions for 

each biomarker in the bio documents, in the pre-

processing process, called normalization, the cor-

pus is newly constructed by replacing these vari-

ous forms into a single form. To do this, various 

forms of markers, including COPD, must be con-

structed in dictionary form first. Three word em-

bedding models are used for this corpus to con-

struct two-, five-, ten-, and hundred-dimension 

lexical vectors. Among them, 100-dimensional 

vectors are reduced to two dimensions using t-

SNE and the result is mapped to a two-

dimensional graph. The t-SNE is used to directly 

look up biomarkers closely related to COPD 

through the visualization process. Also, the origi-

nal vectors that are not reduced are also analyzed 

to calculate the similarity with COPD. By calcu-

lating the similarity between the original vectors, 

we try to more precisely find the related markers. 

The process of analyzing the relationship with 

the last stage, Google Scholars, is for analyzing 

the validity of the methodology rather than ana-

lyzing the relationship between COPD and bi-

omarkers. Figure 1 shows this whole process. 

5 Experiment 

In this paper, we construct new corpus with nxml 

documents downloaded from PubMed site. As a 

result of extracting the nxml document, a total of 

807,821 papers were extracted, and the titles and 

abstracts were collected separately and used as a 

corpus for word embedding. More than two mil-

lion words are represented by word embedding. 

Table 2 shows the most similar words to COPD.

A word ‘exacerbation’ may refer to an increase 

in the severity of a disease or its signs and symp-

toms4. ‘Spirometry’ is the most common of the 

pulmonary function tests5. And doctors may clas-

sify lung conditions as ‘obstructive’ lung disease 

or restrictive lung disease6.  

Among two millions word vectors, biomarkers 

related to pulmonary diseases such as metabolic 

syndrome and lung cancer are extracted separately 

to reveal their relationship with COPD. The mark-

ers listed in table 1 are recommended by Ka-

ngwon National University Hospital. 

Twenty six biomarkers are embedded in four 

cases such as 2-dimensional, 5-dimensional, 10-

dimensional, and 100-dimensional. In the case of 

a high-dimensional vector, the value of a certain 

element is excessively large, which may interfere 

with accurate similarity calculation. To solve this 

problem, a 100-dimensional vector value is re-

duced to two dimensions using t-SNE and the re-

sult is mapped to a two-dimensional space. [Fig-

ure 2] shows the results of visualizing two-

dimensional mapping of 100-dimensional vectors

embedded in CCA, word2vec, and GloVe. In fig-

ure 2, all but the COPD are biomarkers. 

As shown in figure 2, in the case of CCA and 

Word2vec, bio-markers are distributed evenly 

around COPD. However, in the case of GloVe, 

COPD is found to be far apart. However, in all 

three models, bio-markers located close to COPD 

are CC-16 and CEA. In addition, we can see that 

rbp, ghrelin, and trail are close to COPD on the t-

SNE.      

Then, the degree of similarity is calculated by 

applying the cosine similarity to the two-, five-, 

ten- or 100-dimensional vectors embedded in 

three ways. Here, it is assumed that the markers 

with high similarity values are more closely relat-

ed to COPD. Clinical trials must be conducted to 

verify the validity of this assumption. However, in 

reality, clinical trials are very difficult, so this 

study tries indirect verification through Google 

Scholars. 

Table 3 shows the results for all experiments 

with 5 markers of the highest similarities and 5 

markers of the lowest similarities through Google 

Scholars. For an indirect evaluation via Google 

Scholars, we first attempt to search for the key-

word “COPD marker_name” pairs. The titles and 

abstracts of the top 20 papers presented in the 

search results were analyzed and quantified. 

Where title_both is the average number of articles 

having both keywords in the titles and abs_both is 

the average number of articles having both key-

words in the abstracts.

criminates between good markers and bad mark-

ers. In other words, the larger the difference be-

tween the values of BEST and WORST, the 

more favorable it is. As a result, the BEST mark-

er values of CCA were lower than those of the 

WORST markers. This shows that the CCA does 

not play a significant role in this problem. On the 

other hand, Word2vec is a very stable methodol-

ogy because all the BEST marker values show 

higher values than the WORST cases, unless the 

dimension is reduced by t-SNE. However, GloVe 

showed a stable appearance as the number of di-

mensions increased, while it didn’t in case of 2- 

and 5-dimension. In the 100 dimension, it 

showed a bigger difference than word2vec. 

Table 4 shows the similarities with the mark-

ers analyzed as having the highest correlation 

values with COPD in Wor2Vec 100 dimension 

and GloVe 100 dimension. It shows that cc-16 

recommended by Word2Vec and adiponectin 

and leptin recommended by GloVe have already 

undergone much research on COPD. On the oth-

er hand, Word2Vec's eotaxin-1 cyfra21-1 and 

GloVe's cea and saa have not. This provides a di-

rection for new clinical studies. In other words, 

among the markers with a high degree of similar-

ity, the markers that are searched with a low fre-

quency in the Google Scholar will be subject to 

various clinical studies in the future. And if you 

expand it further, it will help you to find new 

markers for specific diseases. 

In fact, it has been found that cyfra21-1, which 

has been shown to have a high similarity, not 

having much research interest so far, to COPD, 

was found to have a significant correlation with 

the phenotype of COPD in clinical trial. Current-

ly, Kangwon National University Hospital is 

conducting experiments to obtain more reliable 

clinical results.  

Finally, we compare the most closely related 

markers recommended by word2vec (100 dimen-

sion) to the score made by human researchers. 

Table 5 shows the rankings that markers recom-

mended by Word2Vec have been given by hu-

man researchers. For 26 markers, the rank corre-

lation coefficient value between word2vec and 

human is 0.44. 

Three clinical specialists participated in this 

experiment. These are professors who have been 

engaged in research for a long time in university 

hospitals, but the number of specialists involved 

should be increased. They are all respiratory 

medicine specialists, but they are not familiar 

with all biomarkers used in this research. There-

fore, the comparison with the specialists should 

be seen not only from the performance evalua-

tion of this study but also from the perspective of 

supplementing the specialists. 

6 Conclusion 

In this paper, we use word embedding to find 

markers that are closely related to COPD. For 

word embedding, we used CCA, Word2Vec, and 

GloVe. Experimental results show that 

Word2Vec and GloVe have the best performance 

when they are 100 dimensions. 

In the future, based on this research, we seek 

to find new markers that are closely related to 

specific diseases. To do this, it is necessary to 

construct a corpus that summarizes the various 

forms of expression that a disease or a marker 

has. Also, it is necessary to develop various pro-

cessing algorithms for expressions composed of 

words. In addition, we will conduct further re-

search on the value of similarity itself as well as 

the relative ranking of biomarkers. 

In this paper, the word embedding is per-

formed in a given corpus, and similarity is calcu-

lated by fixed embedding. Later, we will express 

this problem as deep neural network and develop 

a model that can learn and predict based on this.
