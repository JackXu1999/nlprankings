Abstract 

 

This paper presents the results of GRID pro-
ject which aimed at studying the semantics of 
24 emotion terms in 23 languages belonging to 
8 language families (Indo-European, Indo-
Iranian, Afro-Asiatic, Altaic, Uralic, Japonic, 
Sino-Tibetan, Niger-Congo, and Unclassified). 
We limit ourselves in this article only to two 
Slavic languages – Slovak and Czech and to 
two emotion terms – love and hatred – and try 
show how greatly information technologies 
helped the psychologists first of all to obtain, 
and then to process large volume of informa-
tion from a bit less than 5000 people, active 
project  participants, who live in 30 countries.

2 Introduction 
Feelings and emotions are important components 
of human cognitive activity, behaviour, commu-
nication with the world and other people. Human 
emotional sphere has been thoroughly analyzed 
by psychologists, philosophers, and linguists.  

 
Outstanding scholars from different countries 

(Cornelius, 1996; Ellsworth and Nesse, 2009; 
Fontaine, Scherer et al. 2007; Frijda, 1986; Лук, 
1972 and many others) have made a considerable 
contribution to creation theoretical and methodo-
logical basics of feelings and emotions study. 
Scholars have described the essence of emotions 
(Nakonečný, 2000;  Scherer, 2005; Stuchlíková, 
2007), have made their classification (Ahem and 
Schwarz, 1979; Додонов, 1975), have described 
some of them in details (Panasenko, 2012; Сар-
баш, 2008), have studied them from cognitive 
(Byessonova, 2009; Оrtoni, Clore and Collins, 
1988) and cultural aspect (Fontaine, 2008; Kita-
yama, Markus et al., 1995; Ogarkova,  
Panasenko et al., 2013; Panasenko, Démuthová 
et al., 2012; Russel, 1991), specified their attitu-
dinal character (Ewert, 1970), role and function 
of emotions in social life (Slaměník, 2005), 
means of their expression and perception (Рож-
кова, 1974), peculiarities of emotional sphere of 
people belonging to different professions (teach-
ers, musicians, actors, doctors, TV announcers 
(Ильин, 2001). 

 
In this article we want to show, what ways of 

emotion investigation have been recently em-
ployed by psychologists and what features de-
scribing emotions are important most of all for 
Slovaks and Czechs. Psychologists take into ac-
count different features accompanying emotions, 
such as features describing the person's evalua-

15



tion or appraisal of the event, features describing 
the bodily symptoms that tend to occur during the 
emotional state (felt shivers in the neck or chest, 
got pale, felt his/her heartbeat slowing down, felt 
his/her heartbeat getting faster, felt his/her 
breathing getting faster, perspired, or had moist 
hands); features describing facial and vocal ex-
pressions, that accompany the emotion (blushed, 
smiled, felt his/her jaw drop, pressed his/her lips 
together,  felt his/her eyebrows go up, frowned, 
closed his/her eyes, had tears in his/her eyes; 
changes in  the loudness of voice, of speech mel-
ody, speech tempo, speech disturbances, etc.). 
All these symptoms are included into GRID pro-
ject, results of which we present in our paper. 

3 GRID project  
The International GRID Research Consortium 
was founded in 2005 to organize a world-wide 
study of the semantics of emotion terms in dif-
ferent languages (French, Italian, Portuguese, 
Romansh, Spanish; Afrikaans, Dutch, English, 
German; Bulgarian, Czech, Polish, Russian, Slo-
vak, Ukrainian; Greek; Hindi; Arabic, Hebrew; 
Turkish; Estonian, Finnish, Hungarian; Japanese; 
Chinese, Burmese; Sepedi and Basque) using a 
componential approach. Project brings together 
researchers from different countries and disci-
plines who have a major interest in language and 
emotion. GRID project was supported by the 
Swiss National Center of Competence in Re-
search on Affective Sciences (SCAS), University 
of Geneva (Switzerland) and University of Ghent 
(Belgium). Here and further on the description of 
the project was borrowed from the participants' 
guidelines and from the collective monograph, 
which reflects results of GRID project (Compo-
nents of emotional meaning. A sourcebook, 
2013).  
 

In the study native speakers judged the mean-
ing of emotion terms in their languages, evaluat-
ing them on dimensions reflecting different com-
ponents of emotional experience (Fontaine, 
Scherer, et al. 2007). The GRID consortium was 
coordinated by Klaus R. Scherer (Switzerland), 
Johnny R. J. Fontaine (Belgium) and Phoebe C. 
Ellsworth (USA). 
 
3.1 Data mining 
 
Before we present results of the experimental 
research we want to describe stages of GRID 
project, which we will name further on as GRID. 

First of all, 24 emotion terms (such as sadness, 
shame, guilt, compassion, love, contentment, 
happiness, pride, etc.), as well as the tasks to ful-
fill which were originally in English, were trans-
lated by the coordinators into their native lan-
guages, which we have already mentioned.  

Participants of the project were asked to re-
spond to a web questionnaire hosted on the 
SCAS website. In the web-based instrument each 
participant had to evaluate 4 out of 24 emotion 
words on a profile of 144 componential emotion 
features. The process of answering lasted from 
40 minutes to about an hour. Each language had 
several data-gathering members (38 people) who 
followed the instructions provided by the senior 
coordinators.  

 
The minimum necessary number of people 

under test in each language was 120. From the 
data reflected in the book based on the project 
results (Components of emotional meaning. A 
sourcebook, 2013) we see that the number of 
project participants varies from language to lan-
guage. The largest number of people who have 
completed all the 17 categories of the question-
naire is 247 (Chinese, China, Beijing); large 
number – 220 (Spanish, Peru, Lima), 211 (Chi-
nese, Taiwan, Chia-Yi). The smallest number of 
participants – 66 – was in Burmese (Burma, 
Myanmar) and in Hebrew – 81 – (Israel, Haifa).  

 
We have 135 Slovak participants in the project 

and 125 Czech ones. Though there was no age 
limit, the average age of Slovak and Czech stu-
dents is respectively 22.47 and 19.94. All the 
questions were grouped into several categories:  
categ. 1 evaluation (which included such items 
as features describing the person's evaluation or 
appraisal of the event – 31 items); categ. 2 bodily 
symptoms (features describing the bodily symp-
toms that tend to occur during the emotional state 
– 18); categ. 3 expression (features describing 
facial and vocal expressions and gestures, that 
accompany the emotion – 26); categ. 4 action 
tendencies (features describing tendencies to 
behave in certain ways that accompany the emo-
tion – 40); categ. 5 subjective feeling (features 
describing the subjective experience that charac-
terizes the emotion – 22); categ. 6 regulation 
(features describing ways in which the emotion 
can be regulated – 4); categ. 7 general (some 
general features of the emotion experienced – 3). 
These features are presented below in the tables, 
where they are abbreviated in such a way: 
categ2_i7 felt her or his heartbeat getting faster; 

16



categ2_i16 blushed; categ3_i7 opened her or his 
eyes widely; categ5_i6 felt at ease. As we have 
mentioned above, total number of the features is 
144. 
 

Most of the participants (with the exception of 
people from Tunisia (Arabic, Tunis) and Peru 
(Spanish, Lima) and partially Ukraine (Russian, 
Kiev) answered questions on-line; each partici-
pant was given four different emotion terms cho-
sen at random by the computer. For Slovak stu-
dents it was naturally to be involved into the pro-
ject on-line; they were called by Vrabec "genera-
tion on-line" (2010: 82). The questionnaire was 
anonymous, but it was necessary to mention age, 
sex, education, country of residence and spoken 
languages. It was necessary to answer all the 
questions of the programme, otherwise the data 
were not accepted. Later on all the data obtained 
were thoroughly processed by the latest version 
of SPSS Statistics ver. 21. This gave us the op-
portunity to capture the most important dimen-
sions measured by GRID with a limited number 
of well-differentiating and cross-cultural stable 
features. 
 
4    Love and hatred as emotive terms 
 
As we have already mentioned above, there are 
many classifications of emotions and feelings 
and approaches to their study. The question 
arises how to process the information about 
them, because ways of processing of the received 
data are considered to be a prominent aspect of 
psychological research. For many decades scien-
tists offered varied methods of diagnostics of 
emotional states, verbal and nonverbal ways of 
feelings and emotions expression. Procedures 
which with each coil of progress in science be-
come more and more complicated and accom-
plished result from the theoretical sources of-
fered by scholars, as well as technical possibili-
ties in a society on the given stage of progress. 
 

The question is how after all the person ex-
presses one's feelings and if there are differences 
in various cultures on adequate perception and 
interpretation of emotions. As Russell claims 
(1991), people belonging to different cultures, 
are capable to perceive and estimate correctly 
expressions of a human face, to define on it such 
emotional states, as pleasure, anger, grief, fear, 
disgust, and surprise. On the other side there are 
culture specific differences in expressing human 
emotions and feelings. 

The analysis of studies performed by psy-
chologists and linguists, gives us an opportunity 
to assume, that there are universal and specific 
ways of emotions and feelings expression. We 
may speak about linguistic and extralinguistic 
ways (Панасенко, 2009). GRID questionnaire 
mainly includes extralinguistic ways, such as 
gesticulation, facial expression, bodily move-
ments and some others. Linguistic ways of emo-
tions manifestation are presented by intonational 
ones (categ3"Expression – features describing 
facial and vocal expressions and gestures that 
accompany the emotion: spoke louder/ softer/ 
faster/ slower, had a trembling/ assertive voice, 
changed the melody of his/her speech, etc.). 

Speaking about love and hatred as basic hu-
man feelings, we would like to state, that they 
have been investigated either by linguists or psy-
chologists (Ильин, 2001; Fredrickson, 2001; 
Norman, 2005; Panasenko, 2012; Panasenko et 
al., 2012; Степанов, 1997; Tissari, 2003; Вор-
качев, 1995), but the studies were conducted 
mainly on a very small number of languages. We 
would like to mention the Edinburgh Associative 
Thesaurus (EAT), which is a set of word associa-
tion norms showing the counts of word associa-
tion as collected from subjects. According to it, 
love stimulated the following associations. Num-
ber of different answers is 49. Total count of all 
answers is 97. Here is the beginning of the list:  

 HATE 32 0.33 
 SEX 9 0.09 
 GIRL 5 0.05 
 LIFE 3 0.03 
 MARRIAGE 3 0.03 
 WAR 2 0.02 
 AFFECTION 1 0.01 
(Edinburgh Associative Thesaurus). 
 

The list of associations shows, that top one in 
the list is hatred. It is a very interesting research 
based on English. GRID is based on a large 
number of languages. Its results allow us to see 
different ways of emotions manifestation in dif-
ferent cultures. Below we present results of com-
parative analysis of emotional markers of LOVE 
in Slovak and Czech. 
 
4.1 Emotional markers of LOVE (Slovak data) 
 
17 Slovak participants referred to these emotion 
terms which were described by 144 variables 
affording nine-point response scale for evalua-
tion of each variable. Descriptive analysis of 
mean values of all variables showed, that Slo-

17



vaks consider the terms "love, attachment" to be 
perceived by members of their culture mainly 
through positive characteristics, like something 
nice and pleasant (see table 1).

Table 3. List of characteristics that differ in  

Slovak sample according to gender with respect 
to love markers 

 
Contrary to common stereotypes, men scored 

significantly higher in data items connected with 
life change – they stated that love means that 
they are more ready to break contact with others 
(categ4_i27), to withdraw from people or things 
(categ3_i12), to adjust to the consequences 
(categ1_i25), etc. more than women are. Not-
withstanding gender differences in love evalua-
tion, it is very interesting to state 7 common fea-
tures which were in Slovak sample perceived 
identically by males and females. Love is for 
both genders something important in life what 
they head for (categ1_i10 and categ1_i11) and 
what they expect to get by God (or other super-
natural power) (categ1_i15). They also have co-
incidence with some bodily symptoms 
(categ2_i10 – felt her or his breathing slowing 
down, categ3_i22 – changed the melody of her 
or his speech, categ3_i24 – spoke faster) (after 
Panasenko, Démuthová et al., 2012: 265). 

 
4.2 Emotional markers of HATRED (Slovak 
data) 
 
21 Slovak participants referred to this emotion 
term which was described by 144 variables af-
fording nine-point response scale for evaluation 
of each variable. Description of the tables can be 
the same as in love markers (see tables 1 and 2).

SPSS allows us to present obtained informa-

tion in a different way. Figure 1 shows the an-
swer distribution of the first category from Table

and in the right column those of men. We can see 
that the markers for hatred in male and female 
understanding are extremely different: men want 
to tackle the situation, whereas women are sure 
that men's behaviour violates laws or socially 
accepted norms.

In Czech sample only two characteristics 
(state accepted in the society and felt her or his 
heartbeat getting faster) scored in extreme val-
ues (mean 8,12 and 8,06); all others were per-
ceived with central occurrence. Czechs evaluate 
features stated in GRID questionnaire less ex-
tremely which means they expect wide range of 
experiences when it comes to love. List of char-
acteristics that were stated as the most common 
for "love" in Czech cultural group shows mainly 
positive features. They are connected with posi-
tive emotional feelings and caring tendencies 
(wanted to comply to someone else's wishes, 
wanted to take care of another person, wanted to 
be tender, sweet, and kind), and, what is more 
important, such a kind of the emotional behav-
iour is socially accepted in Czech society (after 
Panasenko, Démuthová et al., 2012: 266).

From the data presented in Table 9 we see that 

for men love is perceived as something, that was 
inconsistent with the expectations of the person; 
whereas for women – as something that was in 
itself pleasant for the person (independently of 
its possible consequences) and of which the con-
sequences were likely to be positive, desirable 
for the person him/herself.

Table 12 presents interesting results of gender 

aspect of hatred display. According to the data, 
the way of displaying hatred for men is the inten-
tion to do damage, hit, or say something that 
hurts; whereas in female answers we find the 
variety of choice: to frown, to want to break con-
tact with others and to do damage, hit, or say 
something that hurts (the last one coincides with 
men's opinion).

5    Discussion and conclusion 
 
After the identification typical features of love 

and hatred in Slovak and Czech sample, we tried 
to identify the differences between these two na-
tions. As we see from table 13 Czech and Slovak 
sample in love markers mainly coincide and are 
connected with emotional state (categ5_i1 – was 
in an intense emotional state and categ5_i2 – ex-
perienced the emotional state for a long time) 
and features regarding the bodily symptoms that 
tend to occur during the ensuing emotional state 
(categ2_i16 – blushed). As it comes from the ta-
ble, to love means for Czechs and Slovaks to be 
in an intense emotional state. Czech and Slovaks 
also think that love is connected with experienc-
ing the emotional state for a long time.

Table 14. List of characteristics that differ in 

Czech and Slovak sample of hatred markers 
 

For Slovaks hatred is associated with category 
3 (expressions), which also includes movements 
and category 2 (bodily symptoms – felt weak 
limbs; felt his/her muscles tensing (whole body).   
Czechs connect it with category 3 (expressions) 
– categ3_i5" – features describing facial and 
vocal expressions and gestures that accompany 
the emotion (frowned) and category 5 – subjec-
tive feeling (felt submissive, felt bad).  

Figure 2 shows the answer distribution of the 
category 2_i2 from table 14, which has high 
scores in Slovak data.  In the left column there 
are answers from Czech data and in the right 
column there are answers from Slovak data. We 
can see the differences between Slovak and 
Czech answers (for hatred). 

 
Figure 2. Answer distribution for category 

2_i2" (felt weak limbs)  
 
We have made only the first steps in the direc-

tion of emotion study in a very limited way: two 
emotion terms (love and hatred), two West 
Slavic languages, but results obtained from 
GRID give us opportunity to describe cross-
cultural similarities and differences of the emo-
tion terms. Experimental data show that these are 
two different cultures and the ways of under-
standing, evaluation, perceiving love, relation to 
a partner are different. Thanks to SPSS-based 
approach we can specify extralinguistic means of 
emotions and feeling manifestation, which are 
important in cross-cultural research. In general, 
we can compare answers of people according to 
their gender, age and country – characteristics 

which were perceived identically and in a differ-
ent way; we can find top ten characteristics 
which were stated by Slovak and Czech partici-
pants as extremely common (ranks from 8 to 9); 
we can specify features of significant correlation 
with one of seven categories and features it in-
cludes. In particular, in Slovak GRID data we see 
that mainly emotional state prevails (wanted to 
be tender, sweet, and kind; was in an intense 
emotional state; experienced the emotional state 
for a long time felt good; felt energetic) as well 
as bodily symptoms and movements (felt her or 
his heartbeat getting faster; felt warm (whole 
body); wanted to sing and dance). From Czech 
GRID data we may speak about such prevailing 
features as facial expressions and gestures 
(smile), vocal expression (changes of speech 
melody), bodily symptoms and movements 
(felt her or his heartbeat getting faster; wanted to 
sing and dance).  
 

As far as GRID database includes 23 lan-
guages with their regional varieties our next step 
will be a cross-cultural study of emotive terms in 
languages of different families and study of ways 
of expressing emotions and feelings with the 
help of language means, i.e., semantics, syntax 
and intonation.
