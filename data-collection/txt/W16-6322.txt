Abstract

The paper reports work on investigating societal
sentiment using the Schwartz values and ethics
model, and applying it to social media text of
users from 20 most populous cities of India to rep-
resent geo-specific societal sentiment map of In-
dia. For the automatic detection of societal sen-
timent we propose psycholinguistic analysis, that
reveals how a user’s social media behaviour and
language is related to his/her ethical practices. In-
dia is a multi-cultural country, values and ethics
of each Indian are highly diverse and dependent
on the region or society s/he belongs to. Sev-
eral experiments were carried out incorporating
Linguistic Inquiry Word Count analysis, n-grams,
topic modeling, psycholinguistic lexica, speech-
acts, and non-linguistic features, while experi-
menting with a range of machine learning algo-
rithms including Support Vector Machines, Logis-
tic Regression, and Random Forests to identify the
best linguistic and non-linguistic features for auto-
matic classification of values and ethics.

1 Introduction
Indian sub-continent is known for its diversity and
multiplicity, with 29 states and 7 union territo-
ries each region has a culture of its own. India’s
plethora of rich cultural diversity is reflected in the
fact that each region is unique in terms of the val-
ues and ethics borne by the individuals belonging
to these regions or society. For example, Punjabis
are fun loving and energetic, South Indians are re-
served and introverts as compared to North Indi-
ans, Mumbaikars and Delhiites are outgoing and
socially confident etc. The main objective of this
paper is to demonstrate that these regional ethics
can be inferred from social media languages and

behavior using statistical analysis.
In the last decade there have been significant ef-
forts in opinion and sentiment mining as well
as inferring emotion from text. Classical senti-
ment/emotion analysis systems classify text into
either one of the classes positive, negative or
neutral, or into Ekman’s classes of happy, sad,
anger, fear, surprise, and disgust. Personality
models [John and Srivastava1999] can be seen as
an augmentation to the basic definition of sen-
timent analysis, where the target is to under-
stand sentiment/personality at person level rather
than only at message level. Here in this paper
our motivation is to augment to one more level
i.e., to understand societal sentiment, i.e., values
and ethics. To understand the societal sentiment
we borrow the psychological values and ethics
model introduced by schwartz1990toward, defines
ten basic and distinct ethical values (henceforth
only values). The definitions of these 10 val-
ues are as following. Achievement: sets goals
and achieves them; Benevolence: seeks to help
others and provide general welfare; Conformity:
obeys clear rules, laws and structures; Hedo-
nism: seeks pleasure and enjoyment; Power: con-
trols and dominates others, controls resources; Se-
curity: seeks health and safety; Self-direction:
wants to be free and independent; Stimulation:
seeks excitement and thrill; Tradition: does
things blindly because they are customary; Uni-
versalism: seeks peace, social justice and tol-
erance for all [Schwartz2012]. All these basic
ten values can be further grouped into higher or-
der (super class: SC) groups which respectively
are: Self-Enhancement (SC1) {Achievement,
Power, Hedonism}, Openness to change (SC2)
{Stimulation, Self-directions, Hedonism}, Self-
Transcendence (SC3) {Universalism, Benevo-
lence}, Conservation (SC4) {Security, Tradition,

Conformity}. In addition to identifying the ten ba-
sic values, Schwartz’ theory also explains how the
values are interconnected and influenced with each
other, since the pursuit of any of the values results
in either an accordance with one another (e.g.,
Conformity and Security) or a conflict with at least
one other value (e.g., Benevolence and Power).
These ten basic values are related to various
outcomes and effects of a person’s role in a
society [Argandoña2003, Agle and Caldwell1999,
Hofstede et al.2010, Rokeach1973]. The val-
ues have also proved to provide an important
and powerful explanation of consumer behaviour
and how they influence it [Kahle et al.1986,
Clawson and Vinson1978]. Moreover, there are
results that indicate how values of workforce and
ethical practices in organizations are directly re-
lated to transformational and transactional leader-
ship [Hood2003]. We believe that these kind of
models may become extremely useful in the fu-
ture for various purposes like Internet advertising
(specifically social media advertising), community
detection, computational psychology, recommen-
dation systems, sociological analysis (for example
East vs West cultural analysis) over social media.
Customized products can be crafted for specific re-
gions of the country by analysing the collective
values of that region. In order to experiment, a
twitter corpus was collected and annotated with
Schwartz values. A range of machine learning
techniques were then utilized to classify an indi-
vidual’s ethical practices into Schwartz’ classes by
analyzing the user’s language usage and behaviour
in social media. The borders between the motiva-
tors are artificial and one value flows into another.
Such overlapping and fuzzy borders between val-
ues make the computational classification problem
more challenging.
The paper is organized in sections with Section 2
introducing related work in this area. The details
of the corpora collection and annotation are given
in Section 3. In Section 4 various experiments on
automatic value detection are reported, Section 5
illustrates the results obtained for Indian cities and
inferences that can be drawn while Section 6 dis-
cusses the performance of the psycholinguistic ex-
periments and mentions possible future directions.

2 Related Works
The present day state-of-the-art sentiment analy-
sis systems look at a fragment of text in isolation.

Therefore textual features and models proposed
and discussed for such purposes is quite different
than our current research need. Henceforth, we are
focusing our discussion on the previous research
on automatic personality analysis which is more
closer to our research.

In the recent years, there have been a lot of
research activities on automated identification of
various personality traits of an individual from
their language usage and behaviour in social me-
dia. One milestone in this area is the Work-
shop and Shared Task on Computational Person-
ality Recognition in the year of 2013. Two cor-
pora were released for this task. One was the
Facebook corpus, which consisted of about 10,000
Facebook status updates of 250 users, plus their
Facebook network properties, labelled with per-
sonality traits. markovikj2013mining and verho-
even2013ensemble achieved encouraging results
on personality classification task. The following
two paragraphs consolidate our discussion on var-
ious features and methods used by researchers in
the workshop. Two kinds of features were put into
use: linguistic and non-linguistic.

Linguistic Features: The participating teams
tested several linguistic features. As a general fact,
it is known that n-grams are the most famous and
useful features for any kind of textual classifica-
tion. Therefore, teams tested various features like
unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams. We also noticed
that Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC) fea-
tures were used by all the teams as their baselines.
LIWC [Pennebaker et al.2001] is a well developed
hand-crafted lexicon. It has 69 different cate-
gorical words, specifically designed for psycho-
linguistic experiments. Another psycholinguistic
lexicon called MRC [Wilson1988] was also used
by a few teams. Lexicons like SentiWordNet
[Baccianella et al.2010], WordNet Affect strappa-
rava:369:2004:lrec2004, categorical features like
part-of-speech (POS), a few other word level fea-
tures like capital letters, repeated words were also
used. Two more important textual features were
discussed by the participating teams. Linguistic
nuances introduced by tomlinson2013predicting,
is the depth of the verbs in wordnet troponymy hi-
erarchy. Speech act features have been discussed
by appling2013towards. Authors manually an-
notated the given Facebook corpus with speech
acts and reported their correlation with personal-
ity traits of the respective users.

Non-Linguistic Features: Facebook network
properties including network size, betweenness
centrality, density and transitivity, provided as a
part of the released dataset, were used by all the
teams.
Drawing inspiration from the learning of the
above mentioned research, we have experimented
with all the above mentioned linguistic and non-
linguistic features and proposed a few new fea-
tures. Effectiveness and performance impact of
each feature on the classification result has been
detailed and discussed in the section 4.

3 Corpus Acquisition

At the very beginning of this research, we asked
ourselves very fundamental question - if social
media is a good proxy of the original society?
backetal2010 and GolbeckEA:11 provide empir-
ical answers to this question. Their results respec-
tively indicate that, in general, people do not use
virtual desired/bluffed social media profiles to pro-
mote an idealized-virtual-identity and that a user’s
personality can be predicted from his/her social
media profile. This does not mean that there are
no outliers, but we grounded our corpus collection
on the assumption that is true for a major portion
of the population.

A standard method of psychological data col-
lection is through self-assessment tests which are
popularly known as psychometric tests. Self-
assessments were obtained using a 50-question
version of the Portrait Values Questionnaire
(PVQ) [Schwartz et al.2001]. This questionnaire
consists of questions where the participant’s an-
swer must be a score rating from 1-6 Likert scale.
A rating of 1 means “not like me at all” which
progressively changes to 6 meaning “very much
like me”. An example question is “He likes to take
risks. He is always looking for adventures.” where
the user should answer while putting himself in
the shoes of “He” in the question. Once all the
questions in the PVQ have been answered, a value
score is generated using an averaging formula for
each value consisting of scores of the related ques-
tions.

3.1 Twitter Values Corpus

In the first quarter of 2016, the micro blogging
service Twitter averaged 310 million monthly ac-

tive users,1 with around 6,000 tweets being posted
every second. Unlike other popular social me-
dia like Facebook, Twitter provides open access
to its data. Therefore, Twitter came as the natu-
ral choice for the data collection. The data collec-
tion was crowd-sourced using Amazon Mechani-
cal Turk as a service, while ensuring that the par-
ticipants came from various cultures and ethnic
backgrounds: the participants were equally dis-
tributed, and consisted of Americans (Caucasian,
Latino, African-American), Indians (East, West,
North, South), and a few East-Asians (Singapore-
ans, Malaysian, Japanese, Chinese). The selected
Asians were checked to be mostly English speak-
ing.

The participants were requested to answer the
50-question version of PVQ and to provide their
Twitter IDs, so that their tweets could be crawled.
However, several challenges have to be addressed
when working with Twitter, and a number of it-
erations, human interventions and personal com-
munications were needed to resolve all the issues.
For example, several users had protected Twitter
accounts, so that their tweets were not accessi-
ble when using the Twitter API. In addition, many
users had to be discarded since they had published
less than 100 tweets, making them uninteresting
for statistical analysis. The open source free Twit-
ter API: Twitter4J2 also has a limit of accessing
only the current 3,200 tweets from any user. To
resolve this issue, an open source Java application
[Henrique2015] was used. At the end of the data
collection process, data from 367 unique users had
been gathered. The highest number of tweets for
one user was 15K, while the lowest number of
tweets for a user was a mere 100; the average num-
ber of messages per user in the Twitter corpus was
found to be 1,608.

3.2 Geo-Specific Data for Indian Values
Map

We started our data collection with a list of India’s
top 20 populous cities spanning almost the whole
country i.e. North, South, East and West India.
Names of those cities could be seen in the Table

3.3 Post-Processing and Corpus Statistics

The scores obtained from the questionnaire were
in the range 1–6 and the corpus contain crowd
sourced data, so we had no control over value
type distributions. For example, the Schwartz
value scores for the corpus were in the follow-
ing ranges: Achievement [-4.12, 3.36], Benevo-
lence [-1.56, 3.39], Conformity [-3.35, 3.01], He-
donism [-5.18, 4.35], Power [-6.12, 2.27], Se-
curity [-2.60, 2.40], Self-Direction [-1.61, 3.40],
Stimulation [-5.0, 2.63], Tradition [-4.49, 3.35],
Universalism [-3.33, 3.30]. The distribution of
a particular value type over a corpus was anal-
ysed using the Bienaymé-Chebyshev Inequality
[Bienaymé1853, Tchébichef1867], showing that,
for example, most of the Achievement instances
(89%) were in the range [-2.96, 2.84]. There-
fore normalization was applied to obtain equilib-
rium in the obtained value ranges. For all the cor-
pora, the range of each value type was rescaled to
the range of [-1,1] using the formula: {xscaled =
2∗(x−xmin)
xmax−xmin −1}. A 1 (‘Yes’) or 0 (‘No’) class was

assigned to each Schwartz value. If the score was
less than 0, the class was considered to be nega-
tive, indicating absence of that value trait for the
particular user, while scores ≥ 0 were considered
to belong to the ‘Yes’ class, indicating the pres-
ence of that trait for the user.
Schwartz’ model defines fuzzy membership,
which means that an power-oriented individual
can be achievement oriented as well, i.e., the val-
ues can overlap with each other. To understand
this notion vividly, we have reported the fuzzy
membership in the Figure 2 where it can be ob-
served that the emerging bands signifies the fuzzy
membership of other 9 values into one of the re-
maining values. For example, on careful investiga-
tion of Figure 2, we can observe that ACY oriented
people’s fuzzy membership is represented by out-
going red bands. The width of the bands represent
the degree of membership ACY oriented people
have in other values. Similarly, we can also ob-
serve that there are 10 incoming bands of 10 dif-
ferent colours towards ACY, which shows mem-
bership of each of the classes in ACY class.In each
class, it can be observed that there is an self-arc
which represents membership of each class with
itself (i.e 100%). The self-arc can be used as ref-
erence in order to measure the degree of mem-
bership of each of the classes with other classes.
The intricate structure of Circos (by Krzywin-
ski18062009) figure rightly signifies how values
are strongly connected with each other at societal
level. Some of the interesting trends which can
be observed from the Figure 2 are : power (POY)
oriented people have highest overlap with achieve-
ment (ACY) oriented people, tradition oriented
people have highest overlap with people high in
conformity and hedonic (HEY) people have sig-
nificant overlap with people seeking stimulation
(STY).

4 Experiments on Automatic Val-
ues Identification

We performed several experiments to get a bet-
ter understanding of the most appropriate linguis-
tic and non-linguistic features for the problem
domain. The experiments were designed as a
20 class classification problem, with ‘Yes’ and
‘No’ classes for each of the ten Schwartz val-
ues. Ten different classifiers were trained, each
for a particular value type. Each classifier pre-
dicts whether the person concerned is positively
or negatively inclined towards the given Schwartz
value. The versions implemented in WEKA
[Witten and Frank2005] of three different ma-
chine learning algorithms were used in the experi-
ments: Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO; a
version of Support Vector Machines, SVM), Sim-
ple Logistic Regression (LR), and Random Forests
(RF). In all the mentioned experiments the corpora
were pre-processed, i.e., tokenized by the CMU
tokenizer [Gimpel et al.2011] and stemmed by the
Porter Stemmer [Porter1980]. All the lexica were
also stemmed in the same way before usage.

4.1 Linguistic Features

LIWC Analysis: LIWC [Pennebaker et al.2001]
is a well developed hand-crafted lexicon. It has 69
different categories (emotions, psychology, affec-
tion, social processes, etc.) and almost 6,000 dis-

tinct words. The 69 categorical features were ex-
tracted as user-wise categorical word frequencies.
As the text length (for the Essay corpus) or num-
ber of messages (Twitter and FB corpora) varies
from person to person, Z-score normalization (or
standardization) was applied using the equation:
x̂ = (x − µ)/σ, where x is the ‘raw frequency
count’, µ and σ are respectively the mean and
standard deviation of a particular feature. After
normalizing, each feature vector value is centered
around 0 and σ = 1. This normalization led to
an increase in the accuracy figures in many of the
cases.

To investigate how each LIWC feature con-
tributes, feature ablation was performed and the
Pearson correlations of LIWC features vs value
types were analysed as reported in Figure3. The fi-
nal classifiers were trained using only the features
that were contributing for a particular value type.
This resulted in a performance boost and also gave
reduced time complexity (both model training and
testing times). For example, the same accuracy
(65.84%) for the Achievement class as obtained
by using the full 69 feature set also can be obtained
by using only 52 LIWC features. Moreover, the
lowest obtained accuracy 53.06% for the Security
class increased to 55.80% when considering only
47 features.

4.2 Topic Modeling

In order to find out the bag-of-words features
for each value type, i.e., the vocabulary that
a person uses more frequently, the MALLET
[McCallum2002]3 topic modelling toolkit was
used to extract a number of topics. MALLET uses
Gibbs Sampling and Latent Dirichlet Allocation
(LDA). In a pre-processing stage, stop words were
removed and case was preserved. For the Twitter
corpus, we tested with different number of topic
clusters of sizes 10, 20, 50, 75, and 100, and ob-
served that 50 was the most suitable number. Each
of the 50 topics contained an average of 19 words,
each with a specific weight attached. The top 5
topics were chosen for each value type, accord-
ing to these weights, and the words of these top-
ics were added as a new feature set along with the
LIWC baseline features.

It was also observed that the rankings of the
top 5 topics were almost similar for each Schwartz

value. The accuracies obtained were almost sim-
ilar to the accuracies obtained in the previous ex-
periments. However, this time, since the dimen-
sion of the feature set is much smaller, the time
complexity decreased by almost a factor of 10.
Hence the topic modelling was repeated for the
social media corpora from Facebook and Twitter,
but resulting in a different number of topic clus-
ters, namely 89. Added to the 69 LIWC features
this thus resulted in a total of 158 features.

4.3 Psycholinguistic Lexica

In addition to the base feature set from LIWC,
two other psycholinguistic lexica were added: the
Harvard General Inquirer [Stone et al.1966] and
the MRC psycholinguistic database [Wilson1988].
The Harvard General Inquirer lexicon contains
182 categories, including two large valence cat-
egories positive and negative; other psycho-
linguistic categories such as words of pleasure,
pain, virtue and vice; words indicating over-
statement and understatement, often reflecting
presence or lack of emotional expressiveness,
etc. 14 features from the MRC Psycholinguistic
lexicon were included, namely, number of let-
ters, phonemes and syllables; Kucera-Francis fre-
quency, number of categories, and number of sam-
ples; Thorndike-Lorge frequency; Brown verbal
frequency; ratings of Familiarity, Concreteness,
Imagability and Age of acquisition; and meaning-
fulness measures using Colorado Norms and Pavio
Norms. In order to get these MRC features a ma-
chine readable version of it has been used.4 Fea-

4http://ota.oucs.ox.ac.uk/headers/1054.xml

ture ranking was done by evaluating the contribu-
tion of each feature in an SMO classifier. In ad-
dition, the sensorial lexicon Sensicon was used. It
contains words with sense association scores for
the five basic senses: Sight, Hearing, Taste, Smell,
and Touch. For example, when the word ‘apple’ is
uttered, the average human mind will visualize the
appearance of an apple, stimulating the eye-sight,
feel the smell and taste of the apple, making use of
the nose and tongue as senses, respectively. Sensi-
con provides a numerical mapping which indicates
the extent to which each of the five senses is used
to perceive a word in the lexicon. We perform fea-
ture ablation and also analyze (Pearson) correla-
tions of lexicon features vs values. Finally, classi-
fiers are trained using only the features which are
contributing for a particular value.

4.4 Non-Linguistic Features

Social network structure is very useful to predict
any person’s intrinsic value. For each user in the
Twitter corpus, the total number of tweets or mes-
sages, total number of likes, average time differ-
ence between two tweets/messages, total number
of favourites and re-tweets, and their in-degree and
out-degree centrality scores on network of friends
and followers were used as features adding to a to-
tal of 7 features along with the feature set used in
the Topic Modelling experiment after observation
of the structure of tweets and the previously done
linguistic feature experiments. The degree central-
ity was calculated as of a vertex v, for a given
graph G(V,E) with |V | vertices and |E| edges, is
defined as: {CD = deg(v)}.

4.5 Speech Act Features

The way people communicate, whether it is ver-
bally, visually, or via text, is indicative of Per-

172



sonality/Values traits. In social media, profile sta-
tus updates are used by individuals to broadcast
their mood and news to their peers. In doing so,
individuals utilize various kinds of speech acts
that, while primarily communicating their con-
tent, also leave traces of their values/ethical di-
mensions behind. By following the hypothesis of
appling2013towards, we have applied speech act
features in order to classify personalities/values.
However, for this experiment we have restricted
speech act classes into 11 major (avoiding 43 fine-
grained speech act classes5) categories: Statement
Non-Opinion (SNO), Wh Question (Wh), Yes-
No Question (YN), Statement Opinion (SO), Ac-
tion Directive (AD), Yes Answers (YA), Thank-
ing (T), Appreciation (AP), Response Acknowl-
edgement (RA), Apology (A) and others (O).
A corpus contain-
ing 7K utterances
was collected from
Facebook and Quora
pages, and annotated
manually. Moti-
vated by the work
by [Li et al.2014],
we used this cor-
pus to develop an
SVM-based speech
act classifier using the
following features:
bag-of-words (top
20% bigrams), pres-
ence of “wh” words,
presence of question
marks, occurrence
of “thanks/thanking”
words, POS tags
distributions, and sentiment lexica such as NRC
Linguistic Database (mohammad2013nrc), Senti-
WordNet [Baccianella et al.2010], and WordNet
Affect [Strapparava and Valitutti2004]. The cate-
gorical corpus distribution and the performance of
the final classifier are reported in Table 2, showing
an average F1-score of 0.69 after 10-fold cross
validation.

Automatic speech act classification of social
media conversations is a separate research prob-
lem altogether, and hence out of scope of the cur-
rent study. However, although the speech act clas-

sifier was not highly accurate in itself, the user
specific speech act distributions could be used as
features for the psycholinguistic classifiers (result-
ing in 11 additional features). Experiment on the
Twitter Corpus, a noticable performance improve-
ment of 6.12% (F-measure) was obtained.

5 Indian Values Map

Table 3 shows the percentage of the total popula-
tion of the concerned cities which are inclined to
the listed super classes. The percentages were fur-
ther normalized (with an ε parameter) using the
formula-

xnorm =
x− xmin + ε

xmax − xmin + ε
× 100 (1)

We observe strik-
ing similarities to
intuitive perception,
i.e., the results ob-
tained resemble our
general perception
about the city/town.
For example, con-
sider the class SC1
referring to Self-
Enhancement, the
percentage score of
Mumbai is the highest
which is expected
as Mumbai is “The
city of dreams” for
people all over the
country who move

in to Mumbai to fulfill their ambitions. The
huge population in Mumbai leads to immense
competition, therefore, it is expected that people
of Mumbai are hedonic, power, and achievement
oriented. Other progressive cities like Chandigarh,
Lucknow and Ahemdabad follow the same trend.

The values of SC2 (openness to change) are
equally high for almost all cities, this is a conse-
quence of the fact that a major population in cities
are open to changes, they are self directed since
they earn their own living and they are also stim-
ulated as they have an active professional and per-
sonal life. It is also highly possible, that, since
the data has been collected from social-media, the
value of SC2 is high, as social-media users belong
to the literate section of the society and possess

a good educational background. As there is no
differentiation of SC2 values we are not report-
ing the values of SC2 in Indian Values Map. In
SC3, which refers to Self-Transcendence, Mum-
bai again scores the highest, with inhabitants from
all over the country, Mumbaikars, are prone to be
universal, since they accept people from all back-
grounds. They also tend to be more benevolent
and warm hearted, this trend can be observed in
all other rapidly developing cities like Bangalore,
Kolkata, Vizag, Indore etc. In the case of SC4,
which refers to conservation, the temple town,
Varanasi tops among others. This result can be
easily anticipated since the Varanasi is high on tra-
dition, individuals conform to rules in fear of god
and yearn for a secure living. It can also be ob-
served that rapidly-developing cities like Chandi-
garh, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Pune, Amritsar have
low values, indicating the diminishing tradition
and conformity to ancient rules and regulations in
these cities. The trends have been visually demon-
strated in Figure 4, indicating the location of each
city and the respective percentage of population
possessing the class of values as defined by the 4
super-groups.

For analysis of results at regional level, India
can be broadly classified into four regions namely,
North, South, East and West India. The region-
wise results are aggregated and reported in the Ta-
ble 4.

The results obtained at regional level are also
close to general intuition about these regions

which will be clear from the derived implications
discussed next. One of the major implications is
that West India tops in terms of achievement (AC)
oriented and hedonistic (HE) people. In general,
North Indians are among the most power (PO) ori-
ented people. For example, majority of politicians
and administrative officers are from North India as
compared to other parts of India. In terms of tra-
ditional people, North India comes at top. This re-
sult can be attributed to the fact that the analysis of
North India is based on more traditional cities like
Srinagar, Kanpur, Lucknow and Varanasi. These
trends are clearly reflected in Table 3 & 4.

6 Discussion and Conclusion
In this paper, we propose a computational
Schwartz values model and applying to various In-
dian users and finally created a Indian values map.

As can be seen from the result that a few
Schwartz values such as Self-Direction and Secu-
rity are relatively difficult to identify, while on the
other hand the accuracies for certain value types
such as Power and Tradition are persistent and
seem to be more salient. The results also indi-
cate that social media text is difficult for automatic
classification, which is obvious from its terse na-
ture. A major limitation is that the collected social
network corpus is skewed, therefore the results do
not have much deviations from the majority base-
lines. Since the classes are imbalanced, the sys-
tem is always statistically biased towards the ma-
jor class. The expected solution is having more

174



data, and we are collecting more data, aiming to
reach data from 10,000 users. The collected data
will be publicly released to the research commu-
nity.

For the machine learners, closer analysis re-
vealed that SMOs performance was irregular and
random, which might be an indication of over-
fitting. On the other hand, the performance of
the Random Forests classifier increased when the
number of features was increased, resulting in a
larger forest and hence for most value types Ran-
dom Forests performed better than the other two
classifiers with less over-fitting.

We are also very keen on the applied side of
this kind of models. Presently we are analysing the
community detection problem in social media in
relation to values. Another interesting application
could be comparative societal analysis between
the Eastern and Western regions of the world. Re-
lations among personality and ethics could also be
explored.
