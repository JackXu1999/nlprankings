Evidence-based medicine uses systematic reviews to identify relevant studies to answer specific research
questions. An underlying principle of the approach is the importance of specifying a priori the research
question to drive the review process. Such reviews have a central role in health technology assessments,
development of clinical guidelines and public health guidance, and evidence-informed policy and
practice. However, public health questions are complex and often need to be described using abstract,
fuzzy terminology. Understanding the scope of evidence often emerges during a review and cannot be
defined a priori. Can text mining support a dynamic and multidimensional definition of relevance using
interactive, exploratory searching under uncertainty? Can text mining help reviewers to explore evidence
of interconnections between different factors, diseases and human behaviour?
