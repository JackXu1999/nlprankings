Abstract 

Metaphors are frequently used to convey 

emotions. However, there is little research 

on the construction of metaphor corpora 

annotated with emotion for the analysis of 

emotionality of metaphorical expressions. 

Furthermore, most studies focus on Eng-

lish, and few in other languages, particu-

larly Sino-Tibetan languages such as Chi-

nese, for emotion analysis from metaphor-

ical texts, although there are likely to be 

many differences in emotional expressions 

of metaphorical usages across different 

languages. We therefore construct a signif-

icant new corpus on metaphor, with 5,605 

manually annotated sentences in Chinese. 

We present an annotation scheme that con-

tains annotations of linguistic metaphors, 

emotional categories (joy, anger, sadness, 

fear, love, disgust and surprise), and inten-

sity. The annotation agreement analyses 

for multiple annotators are described. We 

also use the corpus to explore and analyze 

the emotionality of metaphors. To the best 

of our knowledge, this is the first relatively 

large metaphor corpus with an annotation 

of emotions in Chinese. 

1 Introduction 

Metaphorical expressions are frequently used in 
human communication, and they occur on average 

in every third sentence of natural language, ac-

cording to empirical studies (Cameron, 2003; 

Steen et al., 2010; Shutova and Teufel, 2010). 
Metaphor not only involves linguistic expressions, 

but also involves a cognitive process of conceptu-

al knowledge (Lakoff and Johnson, 1980). Ac-
cording to Lakoff and Johnson (1980), humans 

use one concept in metaphors to describe another 
concept for reasoning and communication. For in-

stance, in the metaphorical utterance: “experience 

is treasure,” we use “treasure” to describe “experi-

ence” to emphasize that “experience” can be valu-
able. To take another metaphorical instance as an 

example: “he killed the engine.” “An engine” is 

viewed as a living thing, and thus stopping its op-
eration is related to the act of killing. Metaphor 

has been viewed as a mapping system that con-

ceptualizes one domain (target) in terms of anoth-

er (source). 
Emotion, as an abstract and vague conception, 

is frequently described and conceptualized by 

metaphor (Goatly Musolff and Project LLE, 2007; 
Kövecses, 1995, 2000). There seem to be two 

main types of metaphors that evoke emotion. One 

is the metaphor in which the target domain is 
emotion. For example, in the instance “he was 

blazing at what she did,” the angry, emotional self 

is conceptualized as “fire,” and so is expressed 

metaphorically in terms of “blaze.” The other type 
is metaphors that have emotional connotations. 

For example, in “The financial crisis has eaten up 

all my savings,” the target domain is finances and 
the source domain, implied by the verb “eat up,” 

is some sort of ravenous beast. This metaphorical 

sentence thus may express senses of anger and 

fear about a “financial crisis.” From the above ex-
amples, we can see that metaphorical expressions 

often state or evoke emotions implicitly and indi-

rectly. Neuroimaging studies have provided evi-
dence that metaphorical language elicits more 

emotional activation of the human brain than lit-

eral language in the same context (Citron and 

Goldberg, 2014).

The interaction between emotion and metaphor 

has been studied from different perspectives by 

scholars in many fields such as psychology (Aver-
ill, 1990; Thibodeau and Boroditsky, 2011; Fet-

terman et al., 2016), linguistics (Fainsilber and Or-

tony, 1987; Kövecses, 2010), neuroscience (Az-iz-
Zadeh and Damasio, 2008; Malinowski and Hor-

ton, 2015; Jabbi et al., 2008) and natural lan-

guage processing (NLP) (Mohammad, Shutova 

and Turney, 2016). Many approaches for senti-
ment analysis of metaphorical texts have been 

proposed in the area of NLP (Smith et al., 2007; 

Veale, 2012; Reyes and Rosso, 2012; Kozareva, 
2013; Strzalkowski et al., 2014). In particular, 

along with the rapid explosion of social media ap-

plications such as Twitter and Weibo, emotional 
texts containing metaphorical expressions have 

increased considerably. It seems to be very com-

mon for Internet users to use vivid and colorful 

metaphorical language to express emotions on so-
cial media. 

Corpora are fundamental for sound analysis of 

emotionality in metaphor and for high-quality au-
tomatic emotion detection in metaphor. However, 

many resources cover sentiment analysis (Alm et 

al., 2005; Dong et al., 2014; Kiritchenko et al., 

2014; Mohammad et al., 2013; Strapparava and 
Mihalcea, 2007; Ratnadeep et al., 2013) and met-

aphor detection (Lönneker, 2004; Martin, 2006; 

Pragglejaz Group, 2007; Steen et al., 2010) sepa-
rately. Moreover, although NLP has proposed ap-

proaches for sentiment analysis of metaphor, as 

mentioned above, an overwhelming majority of 

studies focus on the annotation of only positive 
and negative emotions rather than a range of emo-

tions. In addition, there is limited research in NLP 

in languages other than English analyzing emo-
tions in metaphors. Nevertheless there are likely to 

be many differences in emotional expressions of 

metaphorical usages in different cultures, although 
multiple languages share similar conceptual meta-

phors based on the same human cognition and 

physical experience (Kövecses, 1995).  

According to the above account, we propose a 
Chinese corpus with annotations of both linguistic 

metaphors and emotion. Unlike the widely applied 

annotation of only positive and negative, we have 
annotated a range of emotions (joy, anger, sad-

ness, fear, love, disgust and surprise).Based on the 

analysis of the corpus, our results indicate that a 

significant proportion of Chinese metaphorical 
expressions in the corpus contain emotions and 

the most frequent emotion is love. We also sug-

gest potentials of the corpus contributing to auto-

matic emotion and metaphor detection as well as 
further investigating mechanisms underlying emo-

tion in metaphor from the perspectives of different 

cultures for future work. To the best of our 
knowledge, this is the first relatively large meta-

phor corpus with an annotation of emotions in 

Chinese. 

2 Data Collection  

With the aim of constructing a corpus in the study 

of emotionality of metaphorical texts in real-world 
Chinese, data collection took place in accordance 

with two principles: (1) balance, and (2) relatively 

abundant emotional information. Specifically, to 
ensure the corpus is balanced in genre, theme, and 

style, we selected data from a wide range of 

sources including books, journals, movie scripts, 

and networks. In addition, we focused on sources 
with rich emotional information such as mi-

croblogs. Table 1 presents information on corpus 

sources.

3 Annotation Scheme 

3.1 Annotation Model 

We annotated metaphorical sentences with 
target and source domain vocabulary, emotion 
categories and intensity, metaphor categories 
(verb or noun metaphor : verb or noun used met-
aphorically),data sources, and metaphor devices 

such as 像 “like ,” 好似 “as,” etc. as “indicators”. 
“Indicators” can be null, while the other varia-
bles cannot. For example, if there are some terms 
without values, we need annotators to complete 
them.  

The text files are organized into XML docu-
ments. The annotation model is: MetaEmo-
tionModel=(Target, Source, EmotionCategory, 
Intensity, MetaphorCategory, [indicator], Data-
Source).The following is an example of a sen-
tence annotation: 
  



146

 
 

    

<metaphor> 

<ID>W2833</ID> 

<Sentences>他攻击了我在这个问题上的观点 

“He attacked my perspective on this problem” 
</Sentences> 

<Target>观点“perspective”</Target> 

<Source>攻击“attack”</Source> 
<EmotionCategory>ND</EmotionCategory> 

<EmotionIntensity>5</EmotionIntensity> 

<MetaphorCategory>V</MetaphorCategory> 
<Indicator> </Indicator> 

<DataSource>W</DataSource> 

</metaphor>  

3.2 Metaphor Annotation 

Metaphor category. Based on our investiga-

tion of a wide range of texts, we focused on two 

main types of the most frequently appearing met-
aphorical sentences: verb metaphor, which con-

tains a verb used metaphorically (e.g., 她怀揣着

美好的梦想 “She wove a good dream in her 
mind”); noun metaphor, which contains a noun 

used metaphorically. Noun metaphor includes a 

metaphor of “A is B” (e.g., 语言就是力量 “lan-
guage is power”) and metaphor with linguistic 

makers such as “as” and “like” (e.g., 他像箭似的

跑开了“he ran away like an arrow”), which is 
normally identified as “simile” from a linguistic 

perspective, but as “metaphor” in this paper, be-

cause it accords with metaphor as we define it: 
whenever one concept is used to describe another 

concept (Lakoff and Johnson, 1980). The decision 

to define both metaphors and similes as metaphors 
is based on the wish to give a fuller picture of 

metaphor in our study than one that does not in-

clude similes.  
Literal or metaphorical. The metaphor anno-

tation is at the relational level, which involves 

identification of metaphorical relations between 

source and target domain vocabulary. However, 
scholars have different opinions on the distinction 

between literal and metaphorical senses. Some on-

ly consider novel expressions (e.g.,她为办公室注

入新的活力“She breathed new energy into the 

office”) as metaphorical, whereas others consid-

er conventional expressions as metaphors (e.g.,他

们赢得了这场争论 “they won the argument”), 
where they are conventionalized and fixed in 
form, and they are used literally by native speak-

ers, although they have the nature of metaphor 

(Nunberg, 1987). In this study, following Shutova 

(2017), we define metaphors as both novel and 

conventional, but we exclude “dead metaphors” 
(from which the literal sense has disappeared) 

from conventional metaphors. That is, conven-

tional metaphors only include those for which the 
literal and metaphorical senses are clearly distinc-

tive, and both are used contemporarily. This con-

sideration is based on the potential application of 

our annotation for identification of metaphor, 
which focuses on word sense disambiguation ra-

ther than novel or conventional identification. 

3.3 Emotion Annotation 

Emotion categories. Scholars define basic 
emotions in numerous different ways despite re-

search that has challenged the theories of basic 

emotions (Lindquist et al., 2012; De Leersnyder et 
al., 2015). Confucianism claims that there are sev-

en basic human emotions (joy, anger, sadness, 

fear, love, disgust, and desire) (Ma et al., 2011). 

“七情” (Seven Emotions) is an idiomatic expres-
sion commonly used by Chinese people to de-

scribe human emotions. However, according to 

our study of the collected instances in the corpus, 

we found that “desire” does not appear widely and 
that “surprise” does. We therefore adopted “sur-

prise” to replace “desire” in the Severn Emotions. 

The resulting classification is very close to Ekman 
(1992), with the only difference being the inclu-

sion of “love” as a basic emotion. However, based 

on our study of the research and its wide appear-

ance in the corpus, “love” is listed as a basic emo-
tion in this paper. 

The annotation of emotions takes place on the 

sentence level. The emotion contained in each 
metaphorical sentence was identified from one of 

the seven categories of emotion. We also catego-

rized the intensity of emotion into one of five lev-
els: 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9. 

3.4 Annotation Process 

Annotation setup. The annotator team com-

prised seven native Chinese annotators. Annota-
tors were given standards and principles of anno-

tation and detailed instruction for potential diffi-

cult and common problems with many annotated 

samples. Aside from giving them annotators de-
tailed guidelines, we gave them a formal training 

lesson and a lab meeting to exchange ideas and to 

discuss problems about annotation once a month 
during the nine months of the annotation process. 



147

 
 

    

The guidelines changed four times, as we added 

information on newly found annotation difficulties 

during the project period. The annotator team 
comprised seven students, who were not paid for 

their work.  

These seven annotators were divided to three 
groups with two members for each group plus one 

group with one person. Using cross-validation 

methods for annotation, the two-member groups 

annotated, and the one-person group participated 
in the final decision when there was divergence. If 

there was no divergence between the members of 

the same group, the annotating work was com-
plete. Otherwise another group annotated again, 

and the final group annotated if there was still di-

vergence. Finally, if the three groups could not 
reach agreement on the annotation, everyone dis-

cussed and determined the annotation to ensure its 

accuracy and consistency. 

Quality monitoring and control (QMC).We 
used a standardized operating method to achieve 

high-quality annotation as follows: 

(1) Entry interface. On the basis of multiple 
manual checks and controlled information updat-

ing, we provided an interface that allowed us to 

enter information precisely and quickly.  

(2) Error correction. We used emotional lexi-
con ontology 

1
 as a support tool to correct human 

errors. When there was divergence of emotion in 

the annotation and the sentence/word, we did not 
enter the annotation. 

 

flag=WordConsistency(Memo,Wemo)SentConsiste
ncy(Memo, Semo).                                          (1) 

 

If the annotation result was the same as the 
word’s emotion, we set WordConsistency(M emo, 

Wemo) to 1; otherwise, we set it to 0; SentCon-

sistency(M emo, Semo) followed the same logic. We 

entered the result when the flag was 1, while it 
needed checking when it was 0. 

4 Annotation Agreement 

Annotations of both metaphor and emotion were 

based on the annotators’ intuition, which may be 

very subjective. The reliability of annotations 

needed to be verified, so three independent anno-
tators annotated the same 811 sentences in the 

corpus to assess inter-annotator agreement.

The kappa score, κ, is widely adopted by com-

putational linguistics to correct for agreement on 

the reliability of the annotation scheme by chance. 
We use the κ statistic to measure inter-annotator 

agreements (Siegel and Castellan, 1988) for emo-

tion annotation. κ is calculated as below: 
 

κ = 
P(A) – P(E) 

,  (2) 
1 – P(E) 

 
The agreement on the identification of source 

and target domain words was κ=0.82, which 
means it is substantially reliable. Compared with 
noun metaphors, for verb metaphors it is relative-
ly difficult to identify source and target words, 
because they are related to the assignment of lev-
els of conventionality of metaphorical senses as 
discussed in 4.1. 

The agreement on the choice of emotion cate-
gory scored κ=0.68. For the agreement measure 
on emotion intensity, we classified emotion in-
tensity into three: {1, 3}, {5, 7}, or {9}. The re-
sulting agreement on classification of emotion 
intensity was κ=0.58. 

5 Corpus Analysis 

We annotated 4,600 sentences out of a total of 

5,605 metaphorical sentences as containing emo-

tions. That is, a significant proportion of Chinese 
metaphorical expressions in the corpus contain 

emotions. The most frequent emotion in the cor-

pus is love. Figure 1 shows the number of sen-

tences in the corpus of each emotion category.

source or target word; we also analyzed which 

source or target vocabulary conveyed which emo-

tions most frequently. Our results indicate emo-
tions are related to some particular source or target 

vocabulary. These associations frequently occur 

together. For example, the emotion love is related 

to the source words 海洋“sea”, 花“flower”and

阳光“sunshine” etc. 
Unlike the widely applied annotation of valence 

(positive-neutral-negative) in sentiment analysis, 
we annotated a wider range of emotions in meta-
phorical texts. The corpus proposed by Moham-
mad et al. (2016) focused on containing or not 
containing emotion in metaphor. We have extend-
ed their study by providing evidence that meta-
phorical texts can convey specific emotions such 
as love and joy. A simple positive/negative emo-
tion distinction does not seem very useful for any-
thing beyond evaluating product reviews. In addi-
tion, Mohammad et al. (2016) focus on verb met-
aphors, whereas we collect both verb and noun 
metaphors from a variety of sources. Furthermore, 
since both metaphor and emotion annotations are 
very subjective, we propose a QMC method (see 
above 4.4) to achieve high-quality annotation. 

6 Conclusions and Future Work 

With 5,605 diverse instances and 101,616 Chinese 

characters of metaphor, our corpus provides an 

important resource with relatively fine-grained 

sorting and annotation with both metaphors and 
emotion. Our study involves the Chinese lan-

guage, which is very different from English, the 

focus of the vast majority of current research. This 
may encourage research into emotion analysis in 

other languages, particularly Sino-Tibetan lan-

guages, since there are differences in emotion be-

tween cultures (De Leersnyder, 2015). 
Seven annotators spent nine months on the an-

notation. The manually annotated data is an im-

portant step towards automatic emotion analysis 
and detection of metaphorical texts, as well as 

metaphor detection. In addition, the application of 

the corpus to machine translation will be explored 
to improve the poor translation of metaphorical 

expressions (Shutova et al., 2013). Furthermore, 

we hope research using bilingual resources will be 

conducted on the datasets we have released. This 
may make contributions to some novel and inter-

esting studies of the emotionality of metaphor 

from cross cultural perspectives as well as explor-
ing the related, underlying mechanism.
