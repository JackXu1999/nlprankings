Abstract

Peer review is a core element of the scientific
process, particularly in conference-centered
fields such as ML and NLP. However, only
few studies have evaluated its properties em-
pirically. Aiming to fill this gap, we present
a corpus that contains over 4k reviews and
1.2k author responses from ACL-2018. We
quantitatively and qualitatively assess the cor-
pus. This includes a pilot study on paper
weaknesses given by reviewers and on qual-
ity of author responses. We then focus on
the role of the rebuttal phase, and propose
a novel task to predict after-rebuttal (i.e., fi-
nal) scores from initial reviews and author re-
sponses. Although author responses do have
a marginal (and statistically significant) influ-
ence on the final scores, especially for bor-
derline papers, our results suggest that a re-
viewer’s final score is largely determined by
her initial score and the distance to the other
reviewers’ initial scores. In this context, we
discuss the conformity bias inherent to peer
reviewing, a bias that has largely been over-
looked in previous research. We hope our
analyses will help better assess the usefulness
of the rebuttal phase in NLP conferences.

1 Introduction

Peer review is a widely adopted quality control
mechanism in which the value of scientific work is
assessed by several reviewers with a similar level
of competence. Although peer review has been
at the core of the scientific process for at least
200 years (Birukou et al., 2011), it is also a sub-
ject of debate: for instance, it has been found that
peer reviewing can hardly recognize prospectively
well-cited papers or major flaws (Ragone et al.,
2013). Further, Langford and Guzdial (2015) ob-
served substantial disagreement between two sets
of reviews on the same set of submissions for

the prestigious Conference on Neural Information
Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 2014.

The rebuttal phase plays an important role in
peer reviewing especially in top-tier conferences
in Natural Language Processing (NLP). It allows
authors to provide responses to address the criti-
cisms and questions raised in the reviews and to
defend their work. Although there is evidence that
reviewers do update their evaluations after the re-
buttal phase1, it remains unclear what causes them
to do so, and especially, whether they react to the
author responses per se, or rather adjust to the
opinions of their co-reviewers (“peer pressure”).

In order to obtain further insights into the
reviewing process, especially regarding the role
of the rebuttal phase in peer reviewing, in this
work we present and analyze a review corpus of
the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for
Computational Linguistics (ACL-2018). Every
reviewer/author was asked whether she consented
to freely using her review/author-response for
research purposes and publishing the data under
an appropriate open-source license within at
earliest 2 years from the acceptance deadline (see
supplementary material for the original consent
agreement). 85% reviewers and 31% authors
have consented to sharing their data. The corpus
comprises over 4k reviews (including review
texts and scores) and 1.2k author responses.
Uniquely, the corpus includes both before- and
after-rebuttal reviews for both accepted and
rejected papers, making it a highly valuable
resource for the community to study the role of
the rebuttal phase. The corpus as well as our
source code and annotations are publicly avail-

Our contributions are threefold. First, in §3,
we assess the corpus both quantitatively (e.g., cor-
relating Overall Score with aspect scores such
as Originality and Readability) and qualitatively
(e.g., identifying key terms that differentiate
“good” from “bad” author responses, annotating
paper weaknesses given by reviewers, and rating
the quality of individual author responses). Sec-
ond, in §4, we develop a model to predict whether
a reviewer will increase/decrease/keep her initial
scores after the rebuttal. We do so in order to ana-
lyze and disentangle the sources of review updates
during the rebuttal stage. We find that factoring in
the author responses only marginally (but statisti-
cally significantly) improves the classification per-
formance, and the score update decision is largely
determined by the scores of peer reviewers. Third,
in §5, we discuss multiple types of biases in the
score update process, some of which potentially
undermine the ‘crowd-wisdom’ of peer reviewing.

2 Related Work

Several sources provide review and author re-
sponse data. Since 2013, the NeurIPS main con-
ference publishes the reviews of accepted papers
and their author responses. However, these re-
views only include the review texts for after-
rebuttal reviews. Also, reviews of rejected papers
and author responses are not published. Some Ma-
chine Learning and NLP conferences, for instance
ICLR (International Conference on Learning Rep-
resentations) and ESWC (Extended Semantic Web
Conference), adopt the open review model, which
allows anyone to access the reviews and author re-
sponses. However, most major NLP conferences
have not yet adopted the open-review model, and
the reviews and author responses in open- and
non-open-review venues are likely to be different
because people behave differently when their ac-
tions are observable (Andreoni and Petrie, 2004).

Kang et al. (2018) provide a corpus of com-
puter science papers from ACL, NeurIPS, CoNLL
(The SIGNLL Conference on Computational Nat-
ural Language Learning) and ICLR, together with
the accept/reject decisions and reviews for a sub-
set of the papers. They suggest several tasks
with respective baselines, such as predicting re-
view aspect scores from paper- and review-based
features. However, their corpus contains neither

before-rebuttal reviews nor author responses, and
the size of their review set from NLP conferences
(only 275 reviews from ACL-2017 and 39 reviews
from CoNLL-2016) is much smaller than ours.

Hua et al. (2019) compile a corpus consisting of
14.2k reviews from major NLP and machine learn-
ing conferences. In addition, they annotate 10k ar-
gumentative propositions in 400 reviews, and train
state-of-the-art proposition segmentation and clas-
sification models on the data. But similar to Kang
et al. (2018), their corpus does not include before-
rebuttal reviews or author responses.

Several publications specifically address the
peer reviewing process. Falkenberg and Soranno
(2018) investigate what makes a paper review
helpful to a journal editor within a specific sci-
entific field. Birukou et al. (2011) and Kovanis
et al. (2017) discuss the shortcomings of the re-
view process in general, such as its inability to
detect major flaws in papers (Godlee et al., 1998)
and its ineffectiveness in selecting papers that will
have high citation counts in the future (Ragone
et al., 2013). They discuss alternatives to the stan-
dard review process such as crowd-based review-
ing and review-sharing, i.e., resubmitting a re-
jected work to another venue along with its past
reviews. Ragone et al. (2013) analyze peer re-
views across nine anonymized computer science
conferences and, among others, identify reviewer
biases of multiple types (affiliation, gender, geo-
graphical, as well as rating bias: consistently giv-
ing higher or lower scores than other reviewers)
and propose means for debiasing reviews. How-
ever, none of these works quantitatively measures
the influence of the rebuttal phase on the final re-
view scores, nor do they provide any corpora fa-
cilitating such studies.

Our work is also related to meta science, which
studies the scientific process in general, i.e., how
scientific information is created, verified and dis-
tributed (cf. Fortunato et al. (2018)). In this con-
text, our work can be seen as a study on how sci-
entific information is verified.

3 Review Corpus

ACL-2018 adopts a reviewing workflow similar to
that of other major NLP conferences: after paper
assignment, typically three reviewers evaluate a
paper independently. After the rebuttal, review-
ers can access the author responses and other peer
reviews, and discuss their viewpoints. Reviews

include both scores (Overall Score OVAL, Re-
viewer Confidence CONF, Soundness SND, Sub-
stance SBS, Originality ORG, Meaningful Com-
parison CMP and Readability RDB) and free-text
comments. OVAL are integers in [1, 6], while all
other scores are integers in [1, 5].

We first provide an overview of our corpus in
§3.1, and then present analyses for the reviews and
author responses in §3.2 and §3.3, respectively.

3.1 Overview of the Corpus

The corpus has three parts: the before-rebuttal
reviews (including review texts and scores), the
after-rebuttal reviews, and the author responses.
The corpus does not contain the submissions, nor
the information of the reviewers, e.g., their gender,
country, affiliation or seniority level; nevertheless,
we perform some analyses on the submissions and
the reviewers’ information and present the statis-
tics in the supplementary material.

Basic statistics of our corpus are summarized
in Table 1. 1542 submissions (1016 long, 526
short) have at least one review opted in. 1538 sub-
missions have at least one before- and one after-
rebuttal review opted in. Among the 1542 submis-
sions, 380 submissions (24.6%) were accepted:
255 long, 125 short, and the remaining 1162 were
rejected: 761 long, 401 short. The distribution of
their accept/reject decisions is illustrated in Fig. 1.

3.2 Reviews

Score Correlation. In line with Kang et al.
(2018), we first assess the impact of individual as-
pect scores on the overall score by measuring their
Pearson correlation, illustrated in Fig. 2. We find
that OVAL is most strongly correlated with SND
and SBS, followed by ORG and CMP. CONF shows
weak positive correlation to RDB: the less readable

a paper is, the less confident the reviewers will be.
Note that our correlation results are different from
those reported by Kang et al. (2018), who report
that the OVAL has low Pearson correlation with
SND (0.01) and ORG (0.08). While the differences
might be caused by a variation in aspect defini-
tions, we believe that our estimate is more reliable
as the dataset analyzed in Kang et al. (2018) is sub-
stantially smaller than ours.

Review Texts. ACL-2018 adopts the novel
argument-based review template, which asks re-
viewers to provide positive and negative argu-
ments for and against the submission, respectively.
In addition, reviewers can also list their questions
to the authors in the questions section of the re-
view template. Most reviewers made good use
of the argument-based template: among the 4054
after-rebuttal reviews, 3258 (80.4%) provide pos-
itive arguments, 3344 (82.5%) provide negative
arguments, and 1627 (40.1%) provide questions.
The number and length of arguments/questions are
summarized in Table 2.

Score Changes. Table 3 shows how many re-
views increase (INC), decrease (DEC) or keep
(KEEP) their overall scores after rebuttal. For

the 227 papers that receive at least one INC re-
view (first row in Table 3), their acceptance rate is
49.8%, much higher than those 221 papers with at
least one DEC (7.2%) and those 1119 papers with
no score update (22.8%). Hence, the score update
has a large impact on the final accept/reject deci-
sion. Note that 29 papers receive both INC and
DEC reviews, of which five were accepted finally.

Fig. 3 summarizes the OVAL updates. Most
reviewers stick to their initial scores after rebut-
tal. For those who update, the score change usu-
ally amounts to just one point in absolute value.
However, most updates happen in the borderline
area (overall score 3-4) where the score update
might influence the overall acceptance decision.
We find that the changes in aspect scores occur
much less often than the changes in overall scores:
only 5% of the reviews have any of the aspect
scores updated after rebuttal, and only 1% of the
reviews change the confidence value. In these rare
cases, aspect score changes are consistent with
their OVAL changes, e.g., if the OVAL increases,
no aspect score decreases.

Submission Time. Fig. 4 illustrates the distribu-
tion of the first submission time of reviews. 51.6%
reviews were submitted within the last 3 days be-
fore the deadline. We also find that the mean
submission time of the INC reviews is around 20
hours earlier than that of the DEC reviews, and
the difference is statistically significant (p-value
0.009, double-tailed t-test). Moreover, we find
that submission time is weakly positively corre-
lated with initial score, which means that review-
ers who submit early have slightly lower scores on
average, which may explain their tendency to in-
crease their scores later on, given our results in §4.

The review submission deadline (26th March 2018) is
marked as the red vertical line towards the right end.

A reason why early submitters have lower scores
may be that it takes less time to reject a paper, as
the majority of papers is rejected anyway.

Criticism in Reviews. To study the most com-
mon paper weaknesses identified in reviews, we
manually assess about 300 weakness statements
from the reviews. Table 4 summarizes the main
results, excluding concerns about Technical weak-
nesses. In our sample, most weaknesses refer
to Evaluation & Analysis, i.e., criticize the lack
of: error analysis, ablation tests, significance tests,
human evaluations (opposed to indirect measures
such as BLEU) and strong baselines as well as
insufficient comparisons (either external or inter-
nal). Other frequent targets of criticism are Writ-

being used (only English data or only synthetic
data), missing agreement scores for newly labeled
datasets, and resources not being publicly avail-
able. Reviewers also criticize the lack of Novelty
and proper Motivation of approaches.

3.3 Author Responses

We align author responses with their correspond-
ing reviews (if opted in), and term the author re-
sponses corresponding to INC, DEC and KEEP
reviews as iResp, dResp and kResp, respectively.
Table 5 presents an overview on these groups.

To qualitatively compare iResps and dResps,
we extract and rank n-grams in both iResps
and dResps according to the log-likelihood ratio
(LLR) statistic (Dunning, 1993), treating iResps
and dResps as two corpora2. The results are re-
ported in Table 6. We find both iResps and dResps
express gratitude and promise revisions in the final
versions, but iResps address review questions and
criticisms by referring back to certain lines and ta-
bles in the original paper while dResps fail to do
so. We revisit these differences in §4.2.

statements from Table 4. We advertised no for-
mal definition of quality, and assessed a subjec-
tive, perceived quality score in a range from 1
(low) to 10 (high). We find that the weak author
responses (scores 1-3) are substantially shorter
than the strong ones (scores 8-10): the average
token number in weak and strong responses are
53 and 90, respectively. Responses evaluated as
weak are less specific and make vague promises
(“Thanks for the suggestion, we will try this in
the camera-ready”), off-topic (addressing differ-
ent points than those raised by the reviewer), or
apologetic (“the deadline was very close”, “our
native language is not English”). Interestingly,
with some exceptions (“We take your review as an
example of bad writing”), the weak responses are
usually polite and admit the weaknesses suggested
by the reviewers, but they tend not to detail how
they would address the weaknesses. Strong re-
sponses, in contrast, are specific (referring to spe-
cific line numbers in the submission, as well as
providing numerical values), detailed, longer, and
often do not agree with the criticism, but explain
why the reviewer’s requirement is hard to meet or
beyond the scope of the work.

4 After-Rebuttal Score Prediction

To measure the influence of different factors on
the score update decisions, we propose and study
the after-rebuttal score prediction task. Because
most score updates after rebuttal do not exceed 1
point (see Fig. 3), we formulate this problem as
a classification task. Specifically, given a before-
rebuttal review, its corresponding author response
and other peer reviews, we try to predict whether
the reviewer will increase (INC), decrease (DEC)
or keep (KEEP) her overall score after the rebut-
tal. We avoid predicting the final accept/reject de-
cisions because they are not only based on the final
scores (see Fig. 1, where a few low-score papers
are accepted while some high-score papers are re-
jected), but also based on additional factors such
as the balance of areas and diversity of papers,
which are difficult to measure. The score updat-
ing of reviews, in contrast, only depends on the
peer reviews and the authors responses.

We choose a classic feature-rich classification
model for this task, for two reasons: a) model ca-
pacity is lower compared to, e.g., a deep neural
network, which is beneficial in our small data sce-
nario, and b) the results are easier to interpret.



1279

4.1 Features
Score features (Score). We use all peer re-
view scores for a given submission to build
an array of score-based features. These
include review i’s before-rebuttal OVAL
(self score), statistics of the other peer
reviews’ OVAL (denoted by oth X, where X can
be max/min/mean/median/std), statistics of
all peer reviews’ OVAL (all X), and elementary
arithmetic operations on the above features (e.g.,
oth mean-self denotes the mean OVAL of
the peer reviews minus review i’s before-rebuttal
OVAL). CONF are considered in a similar manner.
We do not consider aspect scores such as ORG
because they yielded no improvements in our
preliminary experiments. The full list of features
can be found in the supplementary material. We
also include features based on the author response
texts, as detailed below.
Length of response (log leng). We have
found that high-quality author responses are usu-
ally longer than the low-quality ones (see §3.3).
We use the logarithm of the number of tokens in
author responses as a feature.
Review-Response Similarity (sim). Lack of
similarity between a review and its response may
indicate that the response is “off-topic”. To mea-
sure similarity, we have trained 300-dimensional
skip-gram word embeddings on 5611 papers ex-
tracted from the cs.CL (computational and lan-
guage) and cs.LG (learning) categories of ArXiv
which were published between January 1, 2015
and December 31, 2017. We represent reviews and
responses by averaging the embeddings of their
words, and measure semantic similarity by cosine
similarity.3 We find it important to use word em-
beddings trained on CL/LG domain data: for ex-
ample, nearest neighbors of “neural” in a model
trained on Wikipedia are “axonal”, “salience”,
while on Arxiv its nearest neighbors are “feedfor-
ward” and “deep”. We find that iResps are more
similar to their reviews than dResps and kResps:
the average cosine similarity between the reviews
and iResps, dResps and kResps are .38, .30 and
.29, respectively.
Specificity (spec). In our human annotation
experiments, unspecific responses were typically
judged as weak because they did not address spe-

3We also used ROUGE (Lin, 2004) to measure the simi-
larity but find the ROUGE scores to be highly correlated with
the cosine similarities (Pearson correlation > 0.9), so we in-
clude only the cosine similarities in our models.

cific questions or weaknesses given by reviews.
To measure the specificity of author responses, we
use a feature-rich sentence-level specificity model
by Li and Nenkova (2015) trained on multiple
news corpora. The produced scores are in the [0, 1]
range, with higher values meaning higher speci-
ficity. iResps are slightly more specific than the
other responses: the mean specificity scores for
iResps, dResps and kResps are .29, .24 and .28,
respectively. For each author response, we com-
pute the spec scores for all their sentences and
use statistics (max/min/mean/median/std) of
the spec scores as features. The same strategy
is used to build the politeness and convincingness
features introduced below.

Politeness (plt). We employ the sentence-
level politeness framework suggested by Danescu-
Niculescu-Mizil et al. (2013) to quantify the po-
liteness of the author responses. We have trained a
simple bag-of-words based multi-layer perceptron
(MLP) model using their Wikipedia and StackEx-
change data and applied it to the author responses,
generating a politeness score in [−1, 1] for each
sentence in author responses, where higher scores
mean higher politeness. While the mean polite-
ness scores in iResps, dResps and kResps have no
marked differences (all around 0.19), the score for
the most polite sentence in iResps (.91) is higher
than that of dResps (.68) and kResps (.90).

Convincingness (cvc). To approximate rebut-
tal convincingness we use the sentence-level con-
vincingness model developed by Simpson and
Gurevych (2018), trained on∼1.2k argument pairs
from web debate forums. We normalize all con-
vincingness scores to [0, 1], where larger scores
mean higher convincingness. Mean convincing-
ness scores for iResps, dResps and kResps are .60,
.49 and .58, respectively.

Score validation. Since the spec, plt and cvc
models are not trained on review-rebuttal data,
we need to perform human evaluations to vali-
date the produced scores. We rank the sentences
in author responses in terms of their spec, plt
and cvc scores and analyze the top and bot-
tom 10 sentences in each ranking (see the sup-
plementary material). We find that the scores
successfully distinguish the most and least spe-
cific/polite/convincing sentences. To further val-
idate the scores, for each type of score, we have
randomly sampled 15 pairs of sentences from au-
thor responses and presented the pairs to 3 ex-

perienced annotators, asking them to indicate the
more specific/polite/convincing sentence in each
pair. The agreement is presented in Table 7. The
agreement between the users’ aggregated prefer-
ences and score-induced preferences is quite high
for all three types, confirming the validity of the
scores. Note that the agreement for cvc is lower
than the other two; the reason might be that it
is difficult even for humans to judge convincing-
ness of arguments, particularly when evaluated on
the sentence level without surrounding context nor
the corresponding review. The distribution of the
spec, plt and cvc scores for iResps, dResps
and kResps is in the supplementary material.

4.2 Results and Analyses

We perform experiments on a subset of the cor-
pus which only includes the submissions that have
author responses and three or more reviews opted
in. We term this subset of the corpus Submissions
with Complete Reviews (Full). Training models on
submissions with fewer reviews would bias cer-
tain features (e.g. all mean) and thus bias the
trained models. Also, we separate out the submis-
sions from the Full set whose before-rebuttal aver-
age OVAL are between 3 and 4.5 (note that OVAL
are in [1, 6]), so as to train and test a model specif-
ically on borderline submissions for which score
changes may be decisive for an accept or reject
decision. We term this subset Borderline Submis-
sions (BRD). Full includes 791 submissions (80
INC, 60 DEC, 652 KEEP) and BRD includes 590
(69 INC, 48 DEC and 474 KEEP). All results and
weights presented in this section are averaged over
5000 repeats of 10-fold cross validation; data en-
tries are randomly shuffled for each repeat.

Feature Selection. We filter out features whose
information gain is ranked in the bottom 50% of
all features on the training set. For highly corre-
lated features in the upper 50% (i.e. Pearson cor-
relation ≥ 0.5), we filter out all but the one with
the highest information gain. Remaining features

are used to train a multinomial logistic regres-
sion model (i.e., MLP with no hidden layer and
softmax activation function in the output layer).
To balance the number of instances for the three
classes, on the training set, in each fold of cross-
validation we randomly down-sample cases with
class KEEP to ensure that the number of KEEP
is the same as the sum of INC and DEC. We also
tried random forest, decision tree, support vector
machines and Gaussian processes as classifiers,
but their performances were similar or worse than
that of logistic regression.

Results. Classification results are presented in
Table 8. In addition, we compare to two base-
lines: the majority baseline always picks the ma-
jority decision (in our case, KEEP); the random
baseline selects an action at random. Full results,
including precision, recall and F1-scores for each
label, can be found in the supplementary material.

We find that score-based features are most ef-
fective among all features. However, text-based
features are also useful, supported by the observa-
tions that: (i) models using only text features all
significantly (p-value < 0.01, double-tailed t-test)
outperform the majority and random baseline; and
(ii) using all features gives the best performance,
significantly (p-value < 0.01) better than using
any feature set alone.

Among the non-Score features, log leng
performs best. But we find it has high correlation
with multiple Score features, and hence when all
features are used, it is filtered out. The features
spec and sim perform much better in BRD than
in Full, which suggests that, for borderline papers,
more weight is placed on whether the response ex-
plicitly addresses the points raised in reviews (sim-
ilarity) and the specificity of the response.

Analysis. To interpret our results, we study the
weights of the features in our logistic regression
model shown in Tables 9 and 10. We observe the
following trends:

• “Peer pressure” is the most important fac-
tor of score change: in both Full and BRD,
features reflecting the gap between own and
others’ review scores (oth mean-self
and self-oth min) have by far the largest
weights compared to other feature groups.
For example, in Full, the Score features
have (absolute) weights of 0.4 or higher for
the class INC, while all other features are
substantially below 0.2. The weights make
intuitive sense: e.g., when the mean of the
other reviewers’ scores is above a reviewer’s
initial score, she has a strong tendency to in-
crease her own score and not to decrease her
own score. Similarly, when a review contains
a very convincing sentence, this substantially
decreases the probability of a score decrease.

• To improve the score for a borderline pa-
per, a more convincing, specific and ex-
plicit response may be helpful: in Full,
no weight of a text-based feature is above
0.2 for INC; however, in BRD, the weights
for cvc min, spec median and sim are
all above 0.2. This asymmetry of the text-
based features across Full and BRD also sug-
gests that reviewers do appear to pay more
attention to the author responses in situations
where they may matter (e.g., make the differ-
ence between accept or reject decisions).

• An impolite author response may harm
the final score: in both Full and BRD, the
weight of plt max is negative for DEC. In
addition, in Full a more polite response helps
increase the final score (positive weight for
INC, close to 0 weight for KEEP). In BRD,
in contrast, a more polite response may not
increase the score but only keep it unchanged
(positive weight for KEEP, close to 0 weight
for INC). If we take BRD papers as those
for which the author responses really matter,
this means that politeness has an asymmetri-
cal effect: it may push a paper below the ac-
ceptance threshold, but not above it. Indeed,
plt max is the second best text-feature for
predicting decrease for BRD papers.

5 Discussion

The opinion update process we have described in
§4.2 is closely related to the work on opinion dy-
namics (DeGroot, 1974; Acemoglu and Ozdaglar,
2011), which studies how human subjects change
their opinions as a reaction to those of peers.

The “peer pressure” effect (opinions being up-
dated to mean opinions) is widely observed in
opinion formation of human subjects in controlled
experiments. Lorenz et al. (2011) find that in
simple estimation tasks (“What’s the population
density of Switzerland?”), human subjects tend to
lean towards a consensus once they are exposed to
the opinions of others. Similarly, Moussaid et al.
(2013) find two dominant effects for simple fac-
tual questions: human subjects tend towards the
mean opinion and towards the opinions of highly
confident individuals. Our experiments also show
that the mean opinion plays a very prominent role
in peer reviews, but they show no evidence sup-
porting the confidence effect: features based on
the confidence scores do not play a significant role
in deciding the final scores (see §4.2). We believe
this is due to two main differences between peer
reviewing and the controlled experiments in the
above works: (i) there does not exist a ground-
truth score for a submission, while such true an-
swers about factual questions do exist in the con-
trolled experiments; and (ii) participants of the
controlled experiments lose money if they give in-



1282

correct answers, but a reviewer loses nothing when
she does not adjust to a (self-assessed) expert.

Three types of biases have been studied in ex-
planatory models of opinion dynamics in recent
years. The first is opposition between members of
different groups (e.g., due to group-identity) lead-
ing to distancing from certain subjects’ opinions
(Altafini, 2013; Eger, 2016). The second is ho-
mophily: individuals ignore opinions too differ-
ent from their own (Deffuant et al., 2000; Hegsel-
mann and Krause, 2002). The third is conformity
(Buechel et al., 2015), i.e., the desire to conform
to a group norm/opinion. Conformity bias can be
strong and persist even in the presence of over-
whelming evidence that a group opinion is wrong
(Asch, 1951). Our observation that reviewers tend
to converge to the mean of all reviews (§4.2) sug-
gests that conformity bias also plays a prominent
role in peer reviewing. We found no evidence (on
an aggregate level) for the other two biases.

To summarize, conformity bias is the main bias
we identified in the peer reviewing process. How-
ever, conformity bias has a negative effect on
crowd-wisdom in estimation tasks (Lorenz et al.,
2011), which strengthens confidence of human
subjects in the correctness of their converged an-
swer, while the actual correctness of their consen-
sus is often even worse than the mean of multiple
independent answers. A simple method to reduce
conformity bias is to blind reviewers from each
other, only allowing reviewers to update their re-
views based on the author responses; the area chair
(who can see all reviews for a paper) is then re-
sponsible for considering all (possibly conflicting)
reviews and making the accept/reject recommen-
dation. We believe that peer reviewing is to a large
degree an opinion dynamics process, a neglected
insight hitherto, and that lessons from this field
should therefore be beneficial for peer reviewing
for NLP conferences and beyond.

Finally, concerning the helpfulness of individ-
ual review based feature groups, we believe it re-
flects a weakness of the current rebuttal stage that-
politeness does matter, because this is merely a
social aspect unrelated to the quality of the as-
sessed papers. However, we also showed that fill-
ing up author responses with “thank you”s is un-
likely to increase a reviewer’s score for a border-
line paper—so at least, authors do not seem to be
able to sneak their papers in via social effects.

6 Conclusion

We presented a review corpus consisting of over
4k reviews and 1.2k author responses from ACL-
2018. To the best of our knowledge, it is the
first corpus that includes both before- and after-
rebuttal reviews for both accepted and rejected pa-
pers in a major NLP conference. We qualitatively
and quantitatively analyzed the corpus, including
a manual classification of paper weaknesses out-
lined by reviewers and a quality rating study of
the corresponding author responses.

In addition, we proposed a classification
model to predict whether a reviewer will in-
crease/decrease/keep her overall score after rebut-
tal. By analyzing the feature weights in our model,
we quantitatively measured the importance of dif-
ferent decision variables for score updates. We
found that the gap between a reviewer’s initial
score and her peers’ scores is the main explanatory
variable. Rebuttal-related factors like convincing-
ness, specificity and politeness of responses are
considerably less important but still have a statis-
tically significant effect, especially for borderline
papers.4 Our findings shed light on the predomi-
nant role of the conformity bias in peer reviewing
(see §5), and we discuss alternative peer review
models addressing this bias. We hope our analy-
ses will help the community better understand the
strengths and weaknesses of the current peer re-
view workflow, spurring further discussions.

Finally, provided that the rebuttal phase remains
a key feature in many peer reviewed conferences,
we think that our novel after-rebuttal score change
prediction task can be practically beneficial for
authors to restructure their author responses and
thereby make them more effective.

A Consent Message

Before a reviewer or an author enters her reviews
or author responses, the following message ap-
pears to ask for her consent for data sharing:

ATTENTION: this time, we plan to do
some analytics on anonymized reviews
and rebuttal statements, upon the agree-
ment of the reviewers and authors, with
the purpose of improving the quality of
reviews. The data will be compiled into
a unique corpus, which we potentially
envisage as a great resource for NLP,
e.g. for sentiment analysis and argu-
mentation mining, and made available to
the community properly anonymized at
earliest in 2 years. We hope to provide
data on ”how to review” to younger re-
searchers, and improve transparency of
the reviewing process in ACL in gen-
eral.

By default, you agree that your
anonymised rebuttal statement can
be freely used for research purposes
and published under an appropriate
open-source license within at earliest 2
years from the acceptance deadline.

Place an ’x’ mark in the NO box if you
would like to opt out of the data collec-
tion.
[x]: YES
[ ]: NO

Analyses on Submissions

We rank n-grams in both accepted and rejected pa-
pers according to the log-likelihood ratio (LLR)
statistic, taking both accepted and rejected papers
as one big corpus, respectively. The goal is to find
n-grams that occur unusually frequently in one of
the two groups, relative to the respective other.

Table 11 shows a few hand-selected n-grams
with highest LLR for accepted papers; high-LLR
n-grams for rejected papers are not presented due
to licensing. To filter out noise, we only include n-
grams that occur in at least 7 different papers. We
can observe some interesting patterns: accepted
papers appear to cite recent work, which reflects
potential novelty and appropriate comparison to
state of the art; tend to use more mathematics (of
a particular kind); have an appendix; do signifi-
cance testing; release code upon publication; and
have multiple figures including subfigures.

B Statistics on Reviewer Information

In this section, we present some statistics of all
1440 reviewers of ACL-18.

Country. The reviewers work in 53 different
countries. The top 10 countries where the re-
viewers work are presented in Fig. 5. The dis-
tribution of the reviewer working places is heav-
ily long-tailed: the United States alone contributes
36.9% of all reviewers, followed by China (8.7%),
the United Kingdom (7.8%) and Germany (7.6%).
Seven countries have more than 50 reviewers, and
19 countries have more than 10 reviewers.

Affiliation. The reviewers are from around 700
organisations. But as reviewers use different
names to refer to the same organisation (e.g., both
MIT and Massachusetts Institute of Technology
are used), the real number of organisations can be
much lower. The top 10 organisations and their
reviewers numbers are presented in Fig. 6. Nine
organisations contribute more than 20 reviewers,
and 19 organisations contribute more than 10 re-
viewers.

Seniority. Most reviewers (69.9%) do not re-
port their seniority levels. Among those that

Gender. We estimate the gender of the review-
ers from their first names, using the tool avail-
able at https://github.com/kensk8er/
chicksexer. 73.4% reviewers are estimated to
be male and the rest 26.6% are estimated to be fe-
male.

C Full Results

The precision, recall and F1-scores for each label
in both Full and BRD are presented in Table 12
and 13, respectively.

D Features

The full list of our hand-crafted features is pre-
sented in Table 14.

E Specificity Scores

We tokenize author responses with nltk, remove
sentences with fewer than 10 tokens and rank the
remaining sentences by their specificity scores.
All scores are normalized to [0, 10], with higher
scores meaning higher specificity. The distribution
of the specificity scores for author responses lead-
ing to increased, decreased and unchanged scores
is illustrated in Fig. 7.

Top 10 sentences are presented below5, and
they all receive a specificity score 10.

• We have already checked it. We can change
the sentence in the last paragraph of Sec-

5The examples are anonymized by replacing citations,
venues, method names, exact scores, etc. with placeholders;
we also include cases where our system has erroneously rated
non-text data (i.e. tables).

tion ### to ‘’Since the proposed method only
substituted ### based on ###, then the natu-
ralness of ### using the proposed method is
better than ###. This method was used be-
cause we have to maintain the context; The
result can be more than 100% because we as-
sume that the ### of original was 100% while
based on human judgement, there are possi-
bility that the ### of resulting sentences using
the proposed method is better than the origi-
nal one.

• ###| ##.# | ##.# | ##.# | ##.# | ##.# | ##.# |
##.# | ##.# |

• ###| ##.# | ##.# | ##.# | ##.# | ##.# | ##.# |
##.# | ##.# |

• There are two reasons why we mention that:
(i) many papers exist, however, many previ-
ous papers made the same (or similar) con-
clusions, so some are picked up as represen-
tatives and (ii) because ### is a high-level
conference, it’s thought that there was no
need to explain too much, and also because
there are limited pages, space was wanted to
be left to explain the analysis as detailed as
possible and put focus on the analysis.

• Other external knowledge sources apart from
### do not add much: In principle, all re-
sources we used originate in ###, the differ-
ence is the degree of knowledge we use. The
novelty in this work does not lie in the use of
### as a knowledge resource but more gener-
ally in the principled ### of the classes.

• We will include this discussion in the paper.
Other ### models (e.g., ###; ###) can in the-
ory predict ###, however, they are not directly
applicable to ### since they cannot handle
### representations, i.e., variables can refer
to a ### representation (e.g., variable ###
refers to an entire proposition and variable
### refers to a segment of meaning).

• As noted in our response to reviewer 3 - our
results on the ### dataset of ### are on par
with the ### model stated in the ### paper
provided by reviewer 3 (which is a SOTA non-
neural ### model) - although we used a very
basic set of features and apply very limited
task-specific tuning to our models.

• Although the models used are general to all
seq2seq generation problems, the heuristics
we used to select ### are specific to gener-
ating the ### (take for example, the heuristic
based on ### - it was motivated by the fact
that ### have a higher readability, hence the
network has to focus towards better readable
information in the ### in order to generate
###).

• Because the size of the training data for ###
task is very small, ### instances for ### task
and ### instances for ### task, whereas the
number of the parameters of the whole net-
work is very big, we pre-training the ### net-
work based on ###, released for ### task,
and pre-training the ### network based on
the training data for ### task.

• Related workshop and share tasks, including
### (collocated with ###), ### (collocated
with ###), ### (collocated with ###), and ###
(collocated with ###), show a great potential
on applying NLP technologies to the ### do-
main.

Bottom 10 sentences are presented below.
Their specificity scores are all smaller than 0.001.

• It would be a little difficult to build this con-
nection.

• It is not accurate and we will use ’obvious’
instead.

• We are not quite sure which part is not iden-
tical.

• I will check that again and will write it as you
said

• Therefore we can see that they have no rela-
tion with each other.

• We will try to do this in our future work.

• But we do not see this as a weakness of our
approach.

• That is why we do not do that in the first sub-
mission.

• So this is really true for all the ”models”.

• Thank you very much for the reviews and for
the very useful

F Politeness Scores

We use the politeness scorer to rate the same set of
sentences as in the specificity evaluation. We nor-
malize all politeness scores to [0,10], with higher
values meaning higher politeness. The distribu-
tion of the politeness scores is illustrated in Fig. 8.
Top 10 sentences and their politeness scores are
presented below.

• (9.6) We thank this reviewer for his helpful
comments that help improving the paper.

• (9.5) Thanks for the suggestion, we found that
in many cases the two sentences that are sep-
arated by ### also have similar patterns to
###, and the size of the dataset would be too
small to train a representative ### model if
we only picked out the separate sentences ex-
amples.

• (9.5) Thank you for the helpful sugges-
tion of including more qualitative results to
more thoroughly understand the proposed
approach.

• (9.4) We again thank the reviewer for the de-
tailed and carefully constructed review and
assure that the main concerns raised by the
reviewer are fixable and we will fix them in
the final version of the paper.

• (9.4) Meanwhile, thanks for your suggestion
for more in-depth discussion on ###

• (9.3) We apologize for this error, and will cor-
rect this in the final version of the paper upon
acceptance.

• (9.3) An interesting alternative approach
would be the one proposed by the reviewer,
but we chose this model because we wanted
to encourage the model to aggregate infor-
mation from a variety of positions, and in our
experience ### has trouble learning to ###
in this way because by design ### focuses on
one position only.

• ###| ##.# | ##.# | ##.# | ##.# | ##.# | ##.# |
##.# | ##.# |

• ###| ##.# | ##.# | ##.# | ##.# | ##.# | ##.# |
##.# | ##.# |

• (9.2) Depends on the task and the character-
istic of two datasets, each proposed method
shows its effectiveness, e.g., the ### using the
### between two entities is appropriate for
the ### task since ### is systematically orga-
nized.

Bottom 10 sentences and their politeness scores
are presented below.

• (1.7) By comparing ### with ###-, we know
whether employing a ### helps; By compar-
ing ### with ###, we know whether employ
a ### helps; By comparing ### with ###, we
know whether the ### helps.

• (2.2) ### = ### ∗ ###, where ###
is a matrix of n samples with ### features
followed by ### features, hence the size of
### is ###.

• (2.3) In other words, our coverage is ###
times larger than theirs, so our proposed sys-
tem can deal much better with the noise when
learning ###.

• (2.4) And another difference lies in the ###
layer, which contains ###, so when we pro-
cess ### in ### independently which encour-
ages our model to learn diverse features.

• (2.4) We will implement their method on our
corpora and make some comparison with our
method in the next version of our manuscript.

• (2.4) We are not giving up ### nor are we
claimining that ### is more powerful.

• (2.5) If our paper is accepted we will make
sure additional relevant technical details are
added.

scores.

• (2.6) In response to your general remark: we
can see how our discussion and conclusions
would lead a reader to conclude that; rather,
this paper is an exploration in an area that is,
as you say, worth exploring.

• (2.7) Our main contribution is introduction
of ### without requiring neither supervision
nor feature engineering.

• (2.7) The most salient problem encountered
in our system is that a user might change ###,
also brought up by R3 (Please refer to our
response to weakness4 of R3).

G Convincingness Scores

We use the convincingness scorer to rate the same
set of sentences as in the previous two studies. The
convincingness scores are normalized to [0, 10],
with higher values meaning higher convincing-
ness. The distribution of the convincingness
scores is illustrated in Fig. 9. Top 10 sentences in
terms of convincingness are presented below. All
top 10 sentences’ convincingness scores are above
9.8.

• In the revision, we perform the evaluation of
the model with ### and ###, respectively.

• Deepening the ### system would inevitably
increase model parameters, and slow the
training and decoding, which is not what we
expect.

• A technical document is defined as the doc-
ument that assumes sufficient background



1290

knowledge and familiarity with the key tech-
nical or central/important terms in the docu-
ment.

• As reported in our paper, the success rate of
our optimization algorithm is ### while, on
average, only ###% of words are altered.

• The focus of this work is not a comparison
of ### methods with ### methods, but how to
mitigate the lack of labeled data problem in
learning of a ### model.

• Our model works well on datasets that are
deemed small for deep architectures to work
and belong to special domains for which ###
is not possible.

• We conduct t-test and get the p value as ###,
which shows good agreement.

• Particularly, we will strive to improve the
presentation quality and to make the draft
more readable and better organized for more
potential readers.

• Furthermore, ### can help ### to alleviate
the performance degradation by ###.

• The ### experiments in Section ### show
that our ### framework can achieve higher
accuracy than the methods that rely on the
same set of resources, while the state-of-the-
art ### methods also require some other re-
sources.

Bottom 10 sentences in terms of convincing-
ness scores are presented below6. Their convinc-
ingness scores are all below 0.01.
