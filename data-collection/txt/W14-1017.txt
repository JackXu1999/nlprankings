Abstract 

Motivation of the language technology company Tilde is to improve quality of machine translation 
for lesser resourced languages such as the languages of Baltic countries. Generic MT solutions like 
Google Translate perform poorly for these complex languages. To compensate the shortage of 
training data and to deal with rich morphology we are applying different approaches in combining 
statistical methods with linguistic rules. We will present the strategies applied and the results of 
various experiments. We will discuss application of the production systems that show significantly 
better translation quality comparing to the Google Translate. We will also outline how this work 
contributes to creation of the European infrastructure for automated translation.
