Abstract

One key consequence of the information revo-
lution is a significant increase and a contami-
nation of our information supply. The practice
of fact-checking won’t suffice to eliminate the
biases in text data we observe, as the degree
of factuality alone does not determine whether
biases exist in the spectrum of opinions visi-
ble to us. To better understand controversial
issues, one needs to view them from a diverse
yet comprehensive set of perspectives.

For example, there are many ways to respond
to a claim such as “animals should have law-
ful rights”, and these responses form a spec-
trum of perspectives, each with a stance rel-
ative to this claim and, ideally, with evidence
supporting it. Inherently, this is a natural lan-
guage understanding task, and we propose to
address it as such. Specifically, we propose
the task of substantiated perspective discov-
ery where, given a claim, a system is expected
to discover a diverse set of well-corroborated
perspectives that take a stance with respect to
the claim. Each perspective should be substan-
tiated by evidence paragraphs which summa-
rize pertinent results and facts.

We construct PERSPECTRUM, a dataset of
claims, perspectives and evidence, making use
of online debate websites to create the ini-
tial data collection, and augmenting it using
search engines in order to expand and diver-
sify our dataset. We use crowdsourcing to
filter out noise and ensure high-quality data.
Our dataset contains 1k claims, accompanied
by pools of 10k and 8k perspective sentences
and evidence paragraphs, respectively. We
provide a thorough analysis of the dataset to
highlight key underlying language understand-
ing challenges, and show that human baselines
across multiple subtasks far outperform ma-
chine baselines built upon state-of-the-art NLP
techniques. This poses a challenge and an op-
portunity for the NLP community to address.

Figure 1: Given a claim, a hypothetical system is ex-
pected to discover various perspectives that are sub-
stantiated with evidence and their stance with respect
to the claim.

1 Introduction

Understanding most nontrivial claims requires in-
sights from various perspectives. Today, we make
use of search engines or recommendation systems
to retrieve information relevant to a claim, but this
process carries multiple forms of bias. In particu-
lar, they are optimized relative to the claim (query)
presented, and the popularity of the relevant doc-
uments returned, rather than with respect to the
diversity of the perspectives presented in them or
whether they are supported by evidence.

In this paper, we explore an approach to miti-
gating this selection bias (Heckman, 1979) when
studying (disputed) claims. Consider the claim
shown in Figure 1: “animals should have lawful
rights.” One might compare the biological simi-
larities/differences between humans and other an-



543

imals to support/oppose the claim. Alternatively,
one can base an argument on morality and ra-
tionality of animals, or lack thereof. Each of
these arguments, which we refer to as perspectives
throughout the paper, is an opinion, possibly con-
ditional, in support of a given claim or against it.
A perspective thus constitutes a particular attitude
towards a given claim.

Natural language understanding is at the heart
of developing an ability to identify diverse per-
spectives for claims. In this work, we propose and
study a setting that would facilitate discovering di-
verse perspectives and their supporting evidence
with respect to a given claim. Our goal is to iden-
tify and formulate the key NLP challenges under-
lying this task, and develop a dataset that would
allow a systematic study of these challenges. For
example, for the claim in Figure 1, multiple (non-
redundant) perspectives should be retrieved from
a pool of perspectives; one of them is “animals
have no interest or rationality”, a perspective that
should be identified as taking an opposing stance
with respect to the claim. Each perspective should
also be well-supported by evidence found in a pool
of potential pieces of evidence. While it might be
impractical to provide an exhaustive spectrum of
ideas with respect to a claim, presenting a small
but diverse set of perspectives could be an im-
portant step towards addressing the selection bias
problem. Moreover, it would be impractical to de-
velop an exhaustive pool of evidence for all per-
spectives, from a diverse set of credible sources.
We are not attempting to do that. We aim at for-
mulating the core NLP problems, and developing a
dataset that will facilitate studying these problems
from the NLP angle, realizing that using the out-
comes of this research in practice requires address-
ing issues such as trustworthiness (Pasternack and
Roth, 2010, 2013) and possibly others. Inherently,
our objective requires understanding the relations
between perspectives and claims, the nuances in
the meaning of various perspectives in the context
of claims, and relations between perspectives and
evidence. This, we argue, can be done with a di-
verse enough, but not exhaustive, dataset. And it
can be done without attending to the legitimacy
and credibility of sources contributing evidence,
an important problem but orthogonal to the one
studied here.

To facilitate the research towards developing
solutions to such challenging issues, we propose

Figure 2: Depiction of a few claims, their perspectives
and evidences from PERSPECTRUM. The supporting
and opposing perspectives are indicated with green

and red colors, respectively.

PERSPECTRUM, a dataset of claims, perspectives
and evidence paragraphs. For a given claim and
pools of perspectives and evidence paragraphs, a
hypothetical system is expected to select the rele-
vant perspectives and their supporting paragraphs.

Our dataset contains 907 claims, 11,164 per-
spectives and 8,092 evidence paragraphs. In con-
structing it, we use online debate websites as our
initial seed data, and augment it with search data
and paraphrases to make it richer and more chal-
lenging. We make extensive use of crowdsourcing
to increase the quality of the data and clean it from
annotation noise.

The contributions of this paper are as follows:

• To facilitate making progress towards the prob-
lem of substantiated perspective discovery, we
create a high-quality dataset for this task.1

• We identify and formulate multiple NLP tasks
that are at the core of addressing the substanti-
ated perspective discovery problem. We show
that humans can achieve high scores on these
tasks.
• We develop competitive baseline systems for

each sub-task, using state-of-the-art techniques.

2 Design Principles and Challenges

In this section we provide a closer look into the
challenge and propose a collection of tasks that
move us closer to substantiated perspective dis-
covery. To clarify our description we use to fol-
lowing notation. Let c indicate a target claim of
interest (for example, the claims c1 and c2 in Fig-
ure 2). Each claim c is addressed by a collection
of perspectives {p} that are grouped into clusters
of equivalent perspectives. Additionally, each per-
spective p is supported, relative to c, by at least one
evidence paragraph e, denoted e � p|c.

Creating systems that would address our chal-
lenge in its full glory requires solving the follow-
ing interdependent tasks:
Determination of argue-worthy claims: not every
claim requires an in-depth discussion of perspec-
tives. For a system to be practical, it needs to be
equipped with understanding argumentative struc-
tures (Palau and Moens, 2009) in order to discern
disputed claims from those with straightforward
responses. We set aside this problem in this work
and assume that all the inputs to the systems are
discussion-worthy claims.
Discovery of pertinent perspectives: a sys-
tem is expected to recognize argumentative sen-
tences (Cabrio and Villata, 2012) that directly ad-
dress the points raised in the disputed claim. For
example, while the perspectives in Figure 2 are
topically related to the claims, p1, p2 do not di-
rectly address the focus of claim c2 (i.e., “use of
animals” in “entertainment”).
Perspective equivalence: a system is expected
to extract a minimal and diverse set of perspec-
tives. This requires the ability to discover equiv-
alent perspectives p, p′, with respect to a claim c:
p|c ≈ p′ |c. For instance, p3 and p4 are equiva-
lent in the context of c2; however, they might not
be equivalent with respect to any other claim. The
conditional nature of perspective equivalence dif-
ferentiates it from the paraphrasing task (Bannard
and Callison-Burch, 2005).
Stance classification of perspectives: a system is
supposed to assess the stances of the perspectives
with respect to the given claim (supporting, oppos-
ing, etc.) (Hasan and Ng, 2014).
Substantiating the perspectives: a system is ex-
pected to find valid evidence paragraph(s) in sup-
port of each perspective. Conceptually, this is sim-
ilar to the well-studied problem of textual entail-
ment (Dagan et al., 2013) except that here the en-

tailment decisions depend on the choice of claims.

3 Related Work

Claim verification. The task of fact verification
or fact-checking focuses on the assessment of the
truthfulness of a claim, given evidence (Vlachos
and Riedel, 2014; Mitra and Gilbert, 2015; Samadi
et al., 2016; Wang, 2017; Nakov et al., 2018;
Hanselowski et al., 2018; Karimi et al., 2018; Al-
hindi et al., 2018). These tasks are highly re-
lated to the task of textual-entailment that has been
extensively studied in the field (Bentivogli et al.,
2008; Dagan et al., 2013; Khot et al., 2018). Some
recent work study jointly the problem of identi-
fying evidence and verifying that it supports the
claim (Yin and Roth, 2018).

Our problem structure encompasses the fact
verification problem (as verification of perspec-
tives from evidence; Figure 1).

Stance classification. Stance classification aims
at detecting phrases that support or oppose a given
claim. The problem has gained significant at-
tention in the recent years; to note a few impor-
tant ones, Hasan and Ng (2014) create a dataset
of dataset text snippets, annotated with “reasons”
(similar to perspectives in this work) and stances
(whether they support or oppose the claim). Un-
like this work, our pool of the relevant “reasons”
is not restricted. Ferreira and Vlachos (2016)
create a dataset of rumors (claims) coupled with
news headlines and their stances. There are a few
other works that fall in this category (Boltužić and
Šnajder, 2014; Park and Cardie, 2014; Rinott et al.,
2015; Swanson et al., 2015; Mohammad et al.,
2016; Sobhani et al., 2017; Bar-Haim et al., 2017).
Our approach here is closely related to existing
work in this direction, as stance classification is
part of the problem studied here.

Argumentation. There is a rich literature on
formalizing argumentative structures from free
text. There are a few theoretical works that lay the
ground work to characterizing units of arguments
and argument-inducing inference (Teufel et al.,
1999; Toulmin, 2003; Freeman, 2011).

Others have studied the problem of extracting
argumentative structures from free-form text; for
example, Palau and Moens (2009); Khatib et al.
(2016); Ajjour et al. (2017) studied elements of ar-
guments and the internal relations between them.

a thorough survey the recent work in this direc-

of argumentative structures (Cabrio and Villata,
2012; Khatib et al., 2016; Lippi and Torroni, 2016;
Zhang et al., 2017; Stab and Gurevych, 2017).

A few recent works use a similar conceptual de-
sign that involves a claim, perspectives and evi-
dence.These works are either too small due to the
high cost of construction (Aharoni et al., 2014)
or too noisy because of the way they are crawled
from online resources (Wachsmuth et al., 2017;
Hua and Wang, 2017). Our work makes use of
both online content and of crowdsourcing, in or-
der to construct a sizable and high-quality dataset.

4 The PERSPECTRUM Dataset

4.1 Dataset construction

In this section we describe a multi-step process,
constructed with detailed analysis, substantial re-
finements and multiple pilots studies.

We use crowdsourcing to annotate different as-
pects of the dataset. We used Amazon Mechan-
ical Turk (AMT) for our annotations, restricting
the task to workers in five English-speaking coun-
tries (USA, UK, Canada, New Zealand, and Aus-
tralia), more than 1000 finished HITs and at least
a 95% acceptance rate. To ensure the diversity of
responses, we do not require additional qualifica-
tions or demographic information from our anno-
tators.

For any of the annotations steps described be-
low, the users are guided to an external platform
where they first read the instructions and try a ver-
ification step to make sure they have understood
the instructions. Only after successful completion
are they allowed to start the annotation tasks.

Throughout our annotations, it is our aim to

make sure that the workers are responding objec-
tively to the tasks (as opposed to using their per-
sonal opinions or preferences). The screen-shots
of the annotation interfaces for each step are in-
cluded in the Appendix (Section A.3).

In the steps outlined below, we filter out a subset
of the data with low rater–rater agreement ρ (see
Appendix A.2). In certain steps, we use an infor-
mation retrieval (IR) system2 to generate the best
candidates for the task at hand.

Step 1: The initial data collection. We start
by crawling the content of a few notable debat-
ing websites: idebate.com, debatewise.org,
procon.org. This yields ∼ 1k claims, ∼ 8k per-
spectives and∼ 8k evidence paragraphs (for com-
plete statistics, see Table 4 in the Appendix). This
data is significantly noisy and lacks the structure
we would like. In the following steps we explain
how we denoise it and augment it with additional
data.

Step 2a: Perspective verification. For each per-
spective we verify that it is a complete English
sentence, with a clear stance with respect to the
given claim. For a fixed pair of claim and perspec-
tive, we ask the crowd-workers to label the per-
spective with one of the five categories of support,
oppose, mildly-support, mildly-oppose, or not a
valid perspective. The reason that we ask for two
levels of intensity is to distinguish mild or condi-
tional arguments from those that express stronger
positions.

Every 10 claims (and their relevant perspec-
tives) are bundled to form a HIT. Three indepen-
dent annotators solve a HIT, and each gets paid
$1.5-2 per HIT. To get rid of the ambiguous/noisy
perspectives we measure rater-rater agreement on
the resulting data and retain only the subset which
has a significant agreement of ρ ≥ 0.5. To ac-
count for minor disagreements in the intensity of

perspective stances, before measuring any notion
of agreement, we collapse the five labels into three
labels, by collapsing mildly-support and mildly-
oppose into support and oppose, respectively.

To assess the quality of these annotations, two
of the authors independently annotate a random
subset of instances in the previous step (328 per-
spectives for 10 claims). Afterwards, the differ-
ences were adjudicated. We measure the accuracy
adjudicated results with AMT annotations to esti-
mate the quality of our annotation. This results in
an accuracy of 94%, which shows high-agreement
with the crowdsourced annotations.

Step 2b: Perspective paraphrases. To enrich
the ways the perspectives are phrased, we crowd-
source paraphrases of our perspectives. We ask
annotators to generate two paraphrases for each of
the 15 perspectives in each HIT, for a reward of
$1.50.

Subsequently, we perform another round of
crowdsourcing to verify the generated para-
phrases. We create HITs of 24 candidate para-
phrases to be verified, with a reward of $1. Over-
all, this process gives us ∼ 4.5 paraphrased per-
spectives. The collected paraphrases form clusters
of equivalent perspectives, which we refine further
in the later steps.

Step 2c: Web perspectives. In order to ensure
that our dataset contains more realistic sentences,
we use web search to augment our pool of perspec-
tives with additional sentences that are topically
related to what we already have. Specifically, we
use Bing search to extract sentences that are simi-
lar to our current pool of perspectives, by querying
“claim+perspective”. We create a pool of relevant
web sentences and use an IR system (introduced
earlier) to retrieve the 10 most similar sentences.
These candidate perspectives are annotated using
(similar to step 2a) and only those that were agreed
upon are retained.

Step 2d: Final perspective trimming. In a fi-
nal round of annotation for perspectives, an ex-
pert annotator went over all the claims in order to
verify that all the equivalent perspectives are clus-
tered together. Subsequently, the expert annotator
went over the most similar claim-pairs (and their
perspectives), in order to annotate the missing per-
spectives shared between the two claims. To cut
the space of claim pairs, the annotation was done
on the top 350 most similar claim pairs retrieved

by the IR system.

Step 3: Evidence verification. The goal of this
step is to decide whether a given evidence para-
graph provides enough substantiations for a per-
spective or not. Performing these annotations ex-
haustively for any perspective-evidence pair is not
possible. Instead, we make use of a retrieval sys-
tem to annotate only the relevant pairs. In par-
ticular, we create an index of all the perspectives
retained from step 2a. For a given evidence para-
graph, we retrieve the top relevant perspectives.
We ask the annotators to note whether a given
evidence paragraph supports a given perspective
or not. Each HIT contains a 20 evidence para-
graphs and their top 8 relevant candidate perspec-
tives. Each HIT is paid $1 and annotated by at
least 4 independent annotators.

In order to assess the quality of our annota-
tions, a random subset of instances (4 evidence-
perspective pairs) are annotated by two indepen-
dent authors and the differences are adjudicated.
We measure the accuracy of our adjudicated labels
versus AMT labels, resulting in 87.7%. This indi-
cates the high quality of the crowdsourced data.

4.2 Statistics on the dataset

We now provide a brief summary of
PERSPECTRUM. The dataset contains about
1k claims with a significant length diversity
(Table 2). Additionally, the dataset comes
with ∼ 12k perspectives, most of which were
generated through paraphrasing (step 2b). The
perspectives which convey the same point with
respect to a claim are grouped into clusters. On
average, each cluster has a size of 2.3 which
shows that, on average, many perspectives have

equivalents. More granular details are available in
Table 2.

To better understand the topical breakdown of
claims in the dataset, we crowdsource the set of
“topics” associated with each claim (e.g., Law,
Ethics, etc.) We observe that, as expected, the
three topics of Politics, World, and Society have
the biggest portions (Figure 3). Additionally, the
included claims touch upon 10+ different topics.
Figure 4 depicts a few popular categories and sam-
pled questions from each.

4.3 Required skills
We perform a closer investigation of the abili-
ties required to solve the stance classification task.
One of the authors went through a random sub-
set of claim-perspectives pairs and annotated each
with the abilities required in determining their
stances labels. We follow the common defini-
tions used in prior work (Sugawara et al., 2017;
Khashabi et al., 2018). The result of this anno-
tation is depicted in Figure 5. As can be seen,
the problem requires understanding of common-
sense, i.e., an understanding that is commonly
shared among humans and rarely gets explicitly
mentioned in the text. Additionally, the task re-
quires various types of coreference understanding,
such as event coreference and entity coreference.

5 Empirical Analysis

In this section we provide empirical analysis to ad-
dress the tasks. We create a split of 60%/15%/25%
of the data train/dev/test. In order to make sure
our baselines are not overfitting to the keywords
of each topic (the “topic” annotation from Sec-
tion 4.2), we make sure to have claims with the
same topic fall into the same split.

For simplicity, we define a notation which we
will extensively use for the rest of this paper. The

clusters of equivalent perspectives are denoted as
[[p]], given a representative member p. Let P (c)
denote the collection of relevant perspectives to a
claim c, which is the union of all the equivalent
perspectives participating in the claim: {[[pi]]}i.
Let E([[p]]) = E(p) =

⋃
i ei denote the set of evi-

dence documents lending support to a perspective
p. Additionally, denote the two pools of perspec-
tives and evidence with Up and Ue, respectively.

5.1 Systems
We make use of the following systems in our eval-
uation:

IR (Information Retrieval). This baseline has
been successfully used for related tasks like Ques-
tion Answering (Clark et al., 2016). We create two
versions of this baseline: one with the pool of per-
spectives Up and one with the pool of evidences
Ue. We use this system to retrieve a ranked list of
best matching perspective/evidence from the cor-
responding index.

BERT (Contextual representations). A recent
state-of-the-art contextualized representation (De-
vlin et al., 2018). This system has been shown to
be effective on a broad range of natural language
understanding tasks.

Human Performance. Human performance
provides us with an estimate of the best achievable
results on datasets. We use human annotators to
measure human performance for each task. We
randomly sample 10 claims from the test set, and
instruct two expert annotators to solve each of T1
to T4.

5.2 Evaluation metrics.
We perform evaluations on four different subtasks
in our dataset. In all of the following evaluations,
the systems are given the two pools of perspectives
Up and evidences Ue.

T1: Perspective extraction. A system is ex-
pected to return the collection of mutually
disjoint perspectives with respect to a given
claim. Let P̂ (c) be the set of output per-
spectives. Define the precision and recall as

Pre(c) =
∑

p̂∈P̂ (c) 1{∃p,s.t.p̂∈[[p]]}

|P̂ (c)| and Rec(c) =∑
p̂∈P̂ (c) 1{∃p,s.t.p̂∈[[p]]}

|P (c)| respectively. To calculate
dataset metrics, the aforementioned per-claim
metrics are averaged across all the claims in the
test set.

solve the stance classification task.

T2: Perspective stance classification. Given a
claim, a system is expected to label every perspec-
tive in P (c) with one of two labels support or op-
pose. We use the well-established definitions of
precision-recall for this binary classification task.

T3: Perspective equivalence. A system is ex-
pected to decide whether two given perspectives
are equivalent or not, with respect to a given claim.
We evaluate this task in a way similar to a cluster-
ing problem. For a pair of perspectives p1, p2 ∈
P (c), a system predicts whether the two are in the
same cluster or not. The ground-truth is whether
there is a cluster which contains both of the per-
spectives or not: ∃p̃ s.t. p̃ ∈ P (c) ∧ p1, p2 ∈ [[p̃]].
We use this pairwise definition for all the pairs in
P (c)× P (c), for any claim c in the test set.

T4: Extraction of supporting evidences.
Given a perspective p, we expect a system to return
all the evidence {ei} from the pool of evidence Ue.
Let Ê(p) and E(p) be the predicted and gold evi-
dence for a perspective p. Define macro-precision

and macro-recall as Pre(p) = |Ê(p)∩E(p)||Ê(p)| and

Rec(p) = |Ê(p)∩E(p)||E(p)| , respectively. The metrics
are averaged across all the perspectives p partici-
pating in the test set.

T5: Overall performance. The goal is to get
estimates of the overall performance of the sys-
tems. Instead of creating a complex measure that
would take all the aspects into account, we approx-
imate the overall performance by multiplying the
disjoint measures in T1, T2 and T4. While this
gives an estimate on the overall quality, it ignores
the pipeline structure of the task (e.g., the propa-
gation of the errors throughout the pipeline). We
note that the task of T3 (perspective equivalence)
is indirectly being measured within T1. Further-
more, since we do not report an IR performance
on T2, we use the “always supp” baseline instead
to estimate an overall performance for IR.

5.3 Results

5.3.1 Minimal perspective extraction (T1)
Table 3 shows a summary of the experimental re-
sults. To measure the performance of the IR sys-
tem, we use the index containing Up. Given each
claim, we query the top k perspectives, ranked ac-



549

cording to their retrieval scores. We tune k on our
development set and report the results on the test
section according to the tuned parameter. We use
IR results as candidates for other solvers (includ-
ing humans). For this task, IR with top-15 can-
didates yields >90% recall (for the PR-curve, see
Figure 6 in the Appendix). In order to train BERT
on this task, we use the IR candidates as the train-
ing instances. We then tune a threshold on the dev
data to select the top relevant perspectives. In or-
der to measure human performance, we create an
interface where two human annotators see IR top-
k and select a minimal set of perspectives (i.e., no
two equivalent perspectives).

5.3.2 Perspective stance classification (T2)
We measure the quality of perspective stance clas-
sification, where the input is a claim-perspective
pair, mapped to {support, oppose}. The can-
didate inputs are generated on the collection of
perspectives P (c) relevant to a claim c. To have
an understanding of a lower bound for the met-
ric, we measure the quality of an always-support
baseline. We measure the performance of BERT
on this task as well, which is about 20% below
human performance. This might be because this
task requires a deep understanding of common-
sense knowledge/reasoning (as indicated earlier in
Section 5). Since a retrieval system is unlikely to
distinguish perspectives with different stances, we
do not report the IR performance for this task.

5.3.3 Perspective equivalence (T3)
We create instances in the form of (p1, p2, c)
where p1, p2 ∈ P (c). The expected label is
whether the two perspectives belong to the same
equivalence class or not. In the experiments, we
observe that BERT has a significant performance
gain of ∼ 36% over the IR baseline. Meanwhile,
this system is behind human performance by a
margin of ∼ 20%.

5.3.4 Extraction of supporting evidence (T4)
We evaluate the systems on the extraction of items
from the pool of evidences Ue, given a claim-
perspective pair. To measure the performance
of the IR system working with the index con-
taining Ue we issue a query containing the con-
catenation of a perspective-claim pair. Given the
sorted results (according to their retrieval confi-
dence score), we select the top candidates using
a threshold parameter tuned on the dev set. We

also use the IR system’s candidates (top-60) for
other baselines. This set of candidates yields a
>85% recall (for the PR-curve, see Figure 6 in
the Appendix). We train BERT system to map
each (gold) claim-perspective pair to its corre-
sponding evidence paragraph(s). Since each evi-
dence paragraph could be long (hence hard to feed
into BERT), we split each evidence paragraph into
sliding windows of 3 sentences. For each claim-
perspective pair, we use all 3-sentences windows
of gold evidence paragraphs as positive examples,
and rest of the IR candidates as negative examples.
In the run-time, if a certain percentage (tuned on
the dev set) of the sentences from a given evidence
paragraph are predicted as positive by BERT, we
consider the whole evidence as positive (i.e. it sup-
ports a given perspective).

Overall, the performances on this task are lower,
which could probably be expected, considering the
length of the evidence paragraphs. Similar to the
previous scenarios, the BERT solver has a signif-
icant gain over a trivial baseline, while standing
behind human with a significant margin.

6 Discussion

As one of the key consequences of the informa-
tion revolution, information pollution and over-
personalization have already had detrimental ef-
fects on our life. In this work, we attempt to facil-



550

itate the development of systems that aid in better
organization and access to information, with the
hope that the access to more diverse information
can address over-personalization too (Vydiswaran
et al., 2014).

The dataset presented here is not intended to be
exhaustive, nor does it attempt to reflect a true dis-
tribution of the important claims and perspectives
in the world, or to associate any of the perspec-
tive and identified evidence with levels of exper-
tise and trustworthiness. Moreover, it is impor-
tant to note that when we ask crowd-workers to
evaluate the validity of perspectives and evidence,
their judgement process can potentially be influ-
enced by their prior beliefs (Markovits and Nantel,
1989). To avoid additional biases introduced in the
process of dataset construction, we try to take the
least restrictive approach in filtering dataset con-
tent beyond the necessary quality assurances. For
this reason, we choose not to explicitly ask anno-
tators to filter contents based on the intention of
their creators (e.g. offensive content).

A few algorithmic components were not ad-
dressed in this work, although they are important
to the complete perspective discovery and presen-
tation pipeline. For instance, one has to first verify
that the input to the system is a reasonably well-
phrased and an argue-worthy claim. And, to con-
struct the pool of perspectives, one has to extract
relevant arguments (Levy et al., 2014). In a similar
vein, since our main focus is the study of the rela-
tions between claims, perspectives, and evidence,
we leave out important issues such as their degree
of factuality (Vlachos and Riedel, 2014) or trust-
worthiness (Pasternack and Roth, 2014, 2010) as
separate aspects of problem.

We hope that some of these challenges and lim-
itations will be addressed in future work.

7 Conclusion

The importance of this work is three-fold; we de-
fine the problem of substantiated perspective dis-
covery and characterize language understanding
tasks necessary to address this problem. We com-
bine online resources, web data and crowdsourc-
ing and create a high-quality dataset, in order to
drive research on this problem. Finally, we build
and evaluate strong baseline supervised systems
for this problem. Our hope is that this dataset
would bring more attention to this important prob-
lem and would speed up the progress in this direc-

tion.
There are two aspects that we defer to future

work. First, the systems designed here assumed
that the input are valid claim sentences. To make
use of such systems, one needs to develop mecha-
nisms to recognize valid argumentative structures.
In addition, we ignore trustworthiness and credi-
bility issues, important research issues that are ad-
dressed in other works.

A.1 Statistics
We provide brief statistics on the sources of differ-
ent content in our dataset in Table 4. In particular,
this table shows:

1. the size of the data collected from online de-
bate websites (step 1).

2. the size of the data filtered out (step 2a).

3. the size of the perspectives added by para-
phrases (step 2b).

4. the size of the perspective candidates added
by web (step 2c).

A.2 Measure of agreement
We use the following definition formula in calcula-
tion of our measure of agreement. For a fixed sub-
ject (problem instance), let nj represent the num-
ber of raters who assigned the given subject to the
j-th category. The measure of agreement is de-
fined as

ρ ,
1

n(n− 1)

k∑
j=1

nj(nj − 1)

where for n =
∑k

j=1 nj . Intuitively, this func-
tion measure concentration of values the vector
(n1, ..., nk). Take the edge cases:

• Values concentrated: ∃j, nj = n (in other
words ∀i 6= j, ni = 0)⇒ P = 1.0.

• Least concentration (uniformly distribution):
n1 = n2 = ... = nk ⇒ ρ = 0.0.

This definition is used in calculation of more
extensive agreement measures (e.g, Fleiss’ kappa
(Fleiss and Cohen, 1973)). There multiple ways of
interpreting this formula:

Figure 6: Candidates retrieved from IR baselines vs
Precision, Recall, F1, for T1 and T4 respectively.

• It indicates how many rater–rater pairs are in
agreement, relative to the number of all pos-
sible rater–rater pairs.

• One can interpret this measure by a simple
combinatorial notions. Suppose we have sets
A1, ...Ak which are pairwise disjunct and for
each j let nj = |Aj |. We choose randomly
two elements from A = A1 ∪ A2 ∪ ... ∪ Ak.
Then the probability that they are from the
same set is the expressed by ρ.

• We can write ρ in terms of
∑k

i=1(ni −
n/k)2/(n/k) which is the conventional Chi-
Square statistic for testing if the vector of ni
values comes from the all-categories-equally-
likely flat multinomial model.
