ABSTRACT
Microblogging services continue to grow in popularity, users publish massive instant messages
every day through them. Many tweets are marked with hashtags, which usually represent
groups or topics of tweets. Hashtags may provide valuable information for lots of applications,
such as retrieval, opinion mining, classification, and so on. However, since hashtags should be
manually annotated, only 14.6% tweets contain them (Wang et al., 2011). In this paper, we
adopt topic-specific translation model(TSTM) to suggest hashtags for microblogs. It combines
the advantages of both topic model and translation model. Experimental result on dataset
crawled from real world microblogging service demonstrates that the proposed method can
outperform some state-of-the-art methods.

1 Introduction

Hashtags, which are usually prefixed with the symbol # in microblogging services, represent
the relevance of a tweet to a particular group, or a particular topic (Kwak et al., 2010). Pop-
ularity of hashtags grows concurrently with the rise and popularity of microblogging services.
Many microblog posts contain a wide variety of user-defined hashtags. It has been proven
to be useful for many applications, including microblog retrieval (Efron, 2010), query expan-
sion (A.Bandyopadhyay et al., 2011), sentiment analysis (Davidov et al., 2010; Wang et al.,
2011), and many other applications. However, not all posts are marked with hashtags. How
to automatically generate or recommend hashtags has become an important research topic.

The task of hashtag recommendation is to automatically generate hashtags for a given tweet.
It is similar to the task of keyphrase extraction, but it has several different aspects. Keyphrases
are defined as a short list of phrases to capture the main topics of a given document (Turney,
2000). Keyphrases are usually extracted from the given document. However, hashtags indicate
where a tweet is about a particular topic or belong to a particular group. So words and hashtags
of a tweet are usually diverse vocabularies, or even hashtags may not occur in the tweet. Take
the tweet in Table 1 for instance, the word “Lion” is used in the tweet, while users annotate
with the hashtag “Mac OS Lion”. That is usually refered to as a vocabulary gap problem.

Word    alignment

Figure 1: The basic idea of word align-
ment method for suggesting hashtags.

To solve the vocabulary gap problem, most researchers applied a statistic machine translation
model to learn the word alignment probabilities(Zhou et al., 2011; Bernhard and Gurevych,
2009). Liu et al. (2011) proposed a simple word alignment method to suggest tags for book
reviews and online bibliographies. In this work, tags are trigged by the important words of the
resource. Figure 1 shows the basic idea of using word alignment method for tag suggestion.

Due to the open access in microblogs, topics tend to be more diverse in microblogs than in
formal documents. However, all the existing models did not take into account any contextual
information in modeling word translation probabilities. Beyond word-level, contextual-level
topical information can help word-alignment choice because sometimes translation model is
vague due to their reliance solely on word-pair co-occurrence statistics. For example, the word
“apple” should be translated into “Apple Inc” in the topic of technology, or “juice” in the topic
of drink. Thus the idea is using topic information to facilitate word alignment choice.

Based on this perspective, in this paper, we propose a topic-specific translation model(TSTM)
to recommend hashtags for microblogs. This method regards hashtags and tweets as parallel
description of a resource. We first investigate to combine topic model and word alignment
model to estimate the topic-specific word alignment probabilities between the words and hash-
tags. After that, when given an unlabeled dataset, we first identify topics for each tweet and
then compute importance scores for candidate tags based on the learned topic-specific word-

tag alignment probabilities and topic distribution. Figure 2 illustrates the basic idea of our
model. In Figure 2, for simplicity, we suppose there are totally two topics, topic 1(information
technology) and topic 2(food). We use the font size of tags to indicate the word-tag align-
ment probability for each specific topic. With the topic distribution and word-tag alignment
probabilities for each topic, we can compute the importance score for each candidate tag.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: related work and state-of-the-art ap-
proaches are reviewed in Section 2. The proposed approach is detailed in Section 3. Experi-
mental results and analysis are described and discussed in Section 4. The last section concludes
the paper.

2 Related work

Our approach relates to two research areas: tag suggestion and keyphrase extraction. In this
section, we discuss them in detail.

2.1 Tag suggestion

Previous work on tag suggestion can be roughly divided into three directions, including
collaborative filtering(CF) (Rendle et al., 2009; Herlocker et al., 2004), discriminative mod-
els (Ohkura et al., 2006; Heymann et al., 2008), and generative models(Krestel et al., 2009;
Iwata et al., 2009). Our proposal is complementary to these efforts, because microblogs differ
from other media in some ways: (1) microblog posts are much shorter than traditional docu-
ments. (2) topics tend to be more diverse than in formal documents. So these methods cannot
be directly applied to hashtag recommendation in microblogs.

2.2 Keyphrase extraction

Keyphrase extraction from documents is the most similar task to this research. Existing
methods can be categorized into supervised and unsupervised approaches. Unsupervised ap-
proaches usually selected general sets of candidates and used a ranking step to select the

most important candidates (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004; Wan and Xiao, 2008). Supervised ap-
proaches used a corpus of training data to learn a keyphrase extraction model that is able to
classify candidates as keyphrases (Turney, 2003; Hulth., 2003).

3 Proposed method

3.1 Preliminaries

We assume an annotated corpus consisting of D tweets with a word vocabulary of size W and
a hashtag vocabulary of size T . Suppose there are K topics embedded in the corpus. The
dth tweet consists of a pair of words and assigned hashtags (wd , td), where wd = {wdn}Ndn=1
are Nd words in the tweet that represent the content, and td = {tdm}Mdm=1 are Md assigned
hashtags. Our notation is summarized in Table 2. Given an unlabeled data set, the task of
hashtag recommendation is to discover a list of hashtags for each tweet.

The proposed topic-specific translation model is based on the following assumptions. When a
user wants to write a tweet, he first generates the content, and then generates the hashtags.
When starting the content, he first chooses some topics based on the topic distribution. Then
he chooses a bag of words one by one based on the word distribution for each chosen topic.
During the generative process for hashtags, a topic is first chosen from topics that have pre-
viously generated the content. And hashtags are chosen according to the chosen topic and
important words in the content.

Formally, let θ denotes the topic distribution and ϕk denotes the word distribution for topic
k. Let ηd denote the distribution of topic choice when assigning hashtags for the dth tweet
and the choice probability of topic k is sampled randomly from topics of content, as follows,

ηdk =
N dk +γ

N d(.)+Kγ
, where N dk is the number of words that are assigned to topic k in the dth

tweet. And then each hashtag tdm is annotated according to topic-specific translation pos-
sibility P(tdm|wd , cdm,B), where P(tdm|wd , cdm,B) =

∑Nd
n=1 P(tdm|cdm, wdn,B)P(wdn|wd) and

B presents the topic-specific word alignment table between a word and a hashtag, where
Bi, j,k = P(t = t j |w = wi , z = k) is the word alignment probability between the word wi and
the hashtag t j for topic k, P(wdn|wd) indicates the importance of the word in the dth tweet,
which will be described in detail in section 3.4.2 .

In summary, the generation process of annotated tweets is described as follows:

268



1. Draw topic probability θ ∼ Dirichlet (α);
2. Draw topic probability η∼ Dirichlet (γ);
3. For each topic k = 1, ..., K

Draw word probability ϕk ∼ Dirichlet (β)
4. For each tweet d = 1, ..., D

(a) For each word n = 1, ..., Nd
Draw topic zdn ∼ Multinomial (θd)
Draw word wdn ∼ Multinomial (Φzdn)

(b) For each hashtag m = 1, ..., Md
Draw topic cdm ∼ Multinomial (ηd)
Draw hashtag tdm ∼ P(tdm|wd , cdm,B)

where α, β and γ are Dirichlet distribution parameters.

Figure 3 shows a graphical model representation of the proposed model.

3.2 Learning and inference

We use collapsed Gibbs sampling(Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004) to find latent variables. The
sampling probability of a latent topic for each word and hashtag in the tweet is sampled
respectively. Due to the space limit, we leave out the derivation details and the sampling
formulas.

After the topics of each word and hashtag become stable, we can estimate topic-specific word

alignment table B by: Bt,w,c =
N tc,w
N (.)c,w

. where N tc,w is a count of the hashtag t that co-occurs with

the word w for topic c in tweet-hashtag pairs.

The possibility table Bt,w,c have a potential size of W T K , assuming the vocabulary sizes for
words, hashtags and topics are W , T and K . The data sparsity poses a more serious problem in
estimating Bt,w,c than the topic-free word alignment case. To reduce the data sparsity problem,
we introduce the remedy in our model. We can employ a linear interpolation with topic-free
word alignment probability to avoid data sparseness: B∗t,w,c = λBt,w,c + (1− λ)P(t|w), where
P(t|w) is topic-free word alignment probability from the word w and the hashtag t, λ is trade-
off of two probabilities. Here we explore IBM model-1 (Brown et al., 1993), which is a widely
used word alignment model, to obtain P(t|w).

3.3 Tag recommendation using Topic-specific translation probabilities

3.3.1 Topic identification

Suppose given an unlabeled dataset W∗ = {w∗d}Ud=1 with U tweets, where the dth tweet w∗d =
{w∗dn}Ldn=1 consists of Ld words. z∗d = {z∗dn}Ldn=1 denotes topics of words in dth tweet and Z∗ ={z∗d}Ud=1. we first identify topics for each tweet using the standard LDA model. The collapsed
Gibbs sampling is also applied for inference. After the topics of each word become stable, we
can estimate the distribution of topic choice for hashtags of the dth tweet in unlabeled data

by: η∗dk =
N dk +γ

N d(.)+γK
, where N dk is a count of words that are assigned topic k in the dth tweet of

unlabeled dataset.

269



3.3.2 Tag recommendation

With topic distribution η∗ and topic-specific word alignment table B∗, we can rank hashtags
for the dth tweet in unlabeled data by computing the scores:

P(t∗dm|w∗d ,η∗d ,B∗) =
K∑

c∗dm=1

Ld∑
n=1

P(t∗dm|c∗dm, w∗dn,B∗)P(c∗dm|η∗d)P(w∗dn|w∗d)

Where P(w∗dn|w∗d) indicates the importance of the words in the tweet. Here, we used I DF to
compute this importance score. According to the ranking scores, we can suggest the top-ranked
hashtags for each tweet to users.

4 Experiments

4.1 Data collection and analysis

In our experiments, we use a Microblog dataset collected from Sina-Weibo1 for evaluation.
Sina-Weibo is a Twitter-like microblogging system in China provided by Sina, one of the largest
Chinese Internet content providers. It was launched in August, 2009 and quickly become the
most popular microblogging service in China. We collected a dataset with totally 10,320,768
tweets. Among them, there are 551,479 tweets including hashtags annotated by users. We
extracted these annotated tweets for training and evaluation. Some detailed statistical infor-
mation is shown in Table 3. We divided them into a training set of 446,909 tweets and a test
set of 104,570 tweets. The training set is applied for building topic-specific translation model,
while the test set is for evaluation. We use hashtags annotated by users as the golden set.

#tweet W T N̄w N̄t
551,479 244,027 116,958 19.97 1.24

Table 3: Statistical information of dataset. W , T , N̄w and N̄t are the vocabulary of words, the
vocabulary of hashtags, the average number of words in each tweet and the average number
of hashtags in each tweet respectively.

4.2 Evaluation metrics and settings
We use Precision(P), Recall(R), and F-value(F) to evaluate the performance of hashtag rec-
ommendation methods. We ran topic-specific translation model with 1000 iterations of Gibbs
sampling. After trying a few different numbers of topics, we empirically set the number of
topics to 100. We use α = 50.0/K and β = 0.1 as (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004) suggested.
Parameter γ is also set to 0.1. We use IDF to indicate the importance of a word and set smooth-
ing parameter λ to 0.8 which gives the best performance. The influence of smoothing to our
model can be found in Section 4.5.

4.3 Comparison with other methods
In this subsection, we implement several methods for comparison, where Naive Bayes(NB) is
a representative classification method, while LDA (Krestel et al., 2009) is selected to represent
generative model for tag suggestion, IBM model-1 (Liu et al., 2011) is a novel translation-
based model.

Table 4: Comparison results of NB, LDA-

In Figure 4, we show the Precision-Recall curves of NB, LDA, IBM1 and TSTM on the data set.
Each point of a Precision-Recall curve represents different numbers of suggested hashtags from
M = 1(bottom right, with higher Precision and lower Recall) to M = 5(upper left, with higher
Recall but lower Precision) respectively. The closer the curve to the upper right, the better
the overall performance of the method. From the Figure, we have the following observations:
(1)TSTM outperforms all the baselines. This indicates the robustness and effectiveness of our
approach for hashtag recommendation. (2)IBM1 underperforms TSTM, because IBM1 relies
solely on word-tag co-occurrence statistics. And contextual topical information can help to
disambiguate word-alignment choices in TSTM. (3)LDA performs so poor, because it ranks the
candidate hashtags by the hashtag distribution for each topic. So it can only suggest general
hashtags.

To further demonstrate the performance of TSTM and other baseline methods, in Table 4,
we show the Precision, Recall and F-measure of NB, LDA, IBM1 and TSTM suggesting top-1
hashtag, because the number is near the average number of hashtags in dataset. We find that
the F-measure of TSTM comes to 0.334, outperforming all the baselines more than 8%.

4.4 Example

In Table 5, we show top-8 hashtags suggested by NB, LDA, IBM1 and TSTM for the tweet in
Table 12. The number in brackets after the name of each method is the count of correctly
suggested hashtags. The correctly suggested hashtags are marked in bold face.

From Table 5, we observe that classification model NB suggests some unrelated hashtags.
While LDA, as generative models, tends to suggest general hashtags, such as “Information
News”, “mobile phone” and “Technology leaders”, and fail to generate the specific hashtags
“WWDC”, “MAC OS Lion”. IBM1 method will suggest some topic-unrelated hashtags. For in-
stance, “2012 Jinshan Inc cloud computing” and “2012 spring and summer men’s week” are
triggered by the word “2012”. On the contrary, TSTM succeeds to suggest specific hashtags,
and most of them are topic-related to the tweet.

4.5 Influences of smoothing

To validate the power of smoothing in TSTM on different sizes of datasets, the experiments
were conducted on two datasets, including a small dataset(a training set of 100,000 tweets

and a test set of 10,000 tweets) and a large dataset(100% training set and 100% test set).
Figure 5 and Figure 6 show the performance on both of the datasets when λ ranges from 0.0
to 1.0. We find that TSTM achieves the best performance when λ = 0.8 in both of the two
Figures. Furthermore, the model cannot perform well without smoothing (when λ = 1) on
the small data set. That indicates smoothing is more powerful on the small data set. While
the model can still perform well without smoothing on the large data set. This is reasonable
because large data set can help to solve the problem of data sparsity to some extent.

Conclusions

In this paper, we address the issue of suggesting hashtags for microblogs. The existing meth-
ods cannot be directly applied to this task due to the following challenges. (1) tweets are
much shorter than traditional documents. (2) topics are more diverse in microblogs than
other media. To solve these problems, we proposed a topic-specific translation model, which
combines the advantages of both topic model and translation model. Experimental result on
tweets crawled from real world service demonstrates that the proposed method can outper-
forms some state-of-the-art methods.
