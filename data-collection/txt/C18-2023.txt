Abstract
In this paper, we demonstrate a system for the automatic extraction and curation of crime-related
information from multi-source digitally published News articles collected over a period of five
years. We have leveraged the use of deep convolution recurrent neural network model to analyze
crime articles to extract different crime related entities and events. The proposed methods are not
restricted to detecting known crimes only but contribute actively towards maintaining an updated
crime ontology. We have done experiments with a collection of 5000 crime-reporting News
articles span over time, and multiple sources. The end-product of our experiments is a crime-
register that contains details of crime committed across geographies and time. This register can
be further utilized for analytical and reporting purposes.

1 Introduction

News articles from different sources regularly report crime incidents that contain details of crime,
information about accused entities, details of the investigation process and finally details of judg-
ment(Westphal, 2008). These details are not all published together, but pour in over time. A curated
crime knowledge base with organized information about criminal activities and possible associated crim-
inals is beneficial to a wide variety of end-users(Westphal, 2008; Furtado et al., 2010; Hassani et al.,
2016; Arulanandam et al., 2014). While law-enforcers of a region have access to details of crime com-
mitted within their own jurisdiction, a shared knowledge-base containing information curated from open
sources can be used by them to track criminal activities in other regions(Chau et al., 2002). These knowl-
edge bases are also in demand by financial organizations who want to make use of these profiles to check
on the credit-worthiness of a customer. Regulatory agencies also want to use these knowledge bases to
verify legal compliance. Crime and corruption, common scourges of modern societies, top the list of
problems cited by public entities in emerging and developing nations.

There are many challenges of such automatic information curation. Ensuring verifiability and reliabil-
ity of information sources is a prime concern for curators. Handling factual variations or contradictions
needs intelligent methods for disambiguation. Incremental compiling of facts from sources generated
over a period of time also needs efficient entity resolution and linking mechanisms to ensure information
continuity. While the present work addresses the later challenges, we do not delve deeper into the issue
of information reliability but rather assume that News articles collected from reliable agencies supply
authentic information.

The salient features of the demonstration are: a) We have leveraged deep convolution recurrent neural
network to extract different crime related entities and events from News documents. This includes,
name of the accused, name of the victim, nature of crime, geographic location, date and time, law
enforcement, charges bought, and action taken (if any) against the accused. b) The model is trained
over a dataset of 5000 documents that spans across time, different sources- containing a multiplicity of
reporting on particular topics. c) We have done experiments with a collection of 1000 new News articles.
The end-product of our experiments is a crime-register that contains details of crime committed across
geographies and time. This register can be further utilized for analytical and reporting purposes.

Figure 1: Overview of the crime event and entity extraction architecture.

The overall architecture depicted in Figure 1, consists of seven primary units: a) Multi-source news
accumulation, b) Crime entity extraction using Convolution Recurrent Neural Network(CRNN) c) Cre-
ating temporary crime registers, d) grouping similar crime reporting, e) Updated crime register, and g)
Reinforcement mechanism.

Multi-source news accumulation: The proposed system consists of multiple web crawlers that con-
tinuously crawls crime news events from 10 different sources in a near runtime manner.

Crime entity extraction using Convolution Recurrent Neural Network(CRNN): Output of the
crawlers are passed to the crime entity extraction unit to extract the following crime components: name
of the accused, name of the victim, nature of crime, geographic location, date and time, law enforcement,
charges bought, and action taken (if any) against the accused. The input to the CRNN are a sequence
of word and characters embeddings. We use the GloVe word vector representations of dimension 300
(Pennington et al., 2014). Both the word and character embeddings are passed to the convolution layer
(CNN). CNNs works best in determining local features from texts. The CNN applies a linear transfor-
mation to all K windows in the given sequence of vectors. Given a word representations X1, X2, ...Xl,
the convolution layer first concatenates these vectors to form a vector x̄ of length l.dLT and then uses
Conv(x̄) = W.̄(x) + b to calculate the output vector of length dc. Where, W and b are the weights that
the network learns. The output of the CNN layer is passed to the RNN layer. We have used bidirec-
tional LSTMs (Bi-LSTM) networks that are connected so that both future and past sequence context can
be examined. After obtaining the intermediate layers from the Bi-LSTM, we use an attention pooling
layer over the sentence representations. The attention pooling helps to acquire the weights of sentence
contribution to final quality of the text. This is represented as: ai = tanh(Wa.hi + ba), αi = e

wα.ai∑
ewα.ai ,

O =
∑

(αi.hi). Where Wa, wα are weight matrix and vector respectively, ba is the bias vector, ai is
attention vector for i-th sentence, and αi is the attention weight of i-th sentence. We apply a sigmoid
function to limit the possible scores to the range [0, 1]. The mapping of the linear layer after applying
the sigmoid activation function is given by s(x) = sigmoid(w.x+ b). Where, x is the input vector, w is
the weight vector, and b is bias value.

Creating crime register for individual news sources: Once the target components are extracted, we
create a temporary crime register of crime entities extracted from each of the individual source news
items. Figure 2 and Figure 3 illustrates the basic working of the crime extraction tool. In the left panel of
Figure 2, there are series of news headline corresponding to a particular date. Once a headline is selected,
the corresponding news details are displayed in the middle panel. Corresponding to the detailed news all
the respective crime entities and events were extracted and labeled in different colors. There are number
of instances where the same crime event is reported in multiple news sources in different ways. There
are also issues related to information richness of one source as compared to other. In particular we have
observed that regional news sources cover deeper information rather than nationalized news sources. In
addition to this there are severe issues related to entity resolution both within the document as well as
outside the document. For example, “Sailesh Patel” may be referred as “Sailesh” or “Patel” in other
articles. In order to resolve such entities, we have used the BMI measure as discussed in (Lau et al.,
2008; Lau et al., 2009). Also, resolution of such named entities help grouping similar crime reporting
together. Thus, it is also important to ensemble information across different news sources together and
construct a unified knowledge representation.

and was killed in a moving car on July 25 on SG Road. The LCB officials said that Patel was 

caught when he went to the spot where he had parked his another car used in the crime on 

Prantij−Himmatnagar Road. According to the LCB officials, four teams, led by inspector J D 

Purohit and sub−inspectors H K Solanki, K A Patel and S B Padheriya, are working on the 

case. After the arrest of two accused − Jignesh Bhavsar and Ramesh Patel − by Ahmedabad

Tracking new progress and outcomes: As discussed earlier, all the details of a crime incident are
not published together, but gradually reported over time. This may span between days to months to
year. Over the time information regarding the crime incident changes and new outcomes emerges. For
example, in Figure 2 our system demonstrates how a particular crime incident about “Sheena Bora mur-
der case” changes over time with new accused names, crime type and victims. Therefore, it becomes
extremely difficult for a curator to manually keep track of all the records form the past repositories. With
respect to this, the present system plays an important role in automatically identifying, tracking, and
maintaining crime incidents that last over years. Once the crime entities of similar crime reports are
grouped together, the entities along with their relations are then stored in an crime ontological structure.
If a new entity arrives, then the corresponding ontology along with its relations will be updated in the
repository.

As discussed earlier, the proposed system in mainly developed to assist analysts and knowledge work-
ers for exploring, reviewing and visualize textual data. With respect to this an important feature of the
proposed system is its ability to adapt based on the users feedback. For example, in Figure 2 the system
provides option to the user to change the system predicted outputs. Based on the users output, the system
has the capability to retrain its classification and extraction model. This in turn help create new and
enriched models.

2.1 Experimentation and Evaluation
In order to evaluate, we took another set of 1000 news articles from 3 different sources over the period
of five years. Each of the articles were manually annotated by a group of experts. The annotation
process involves identifying the major crime components as discussed earlier. The system is evaluated
by comparing its output with that of the expert annotations. We quantify the performance score in terms
of the precision(P), recall(Re), and F-measure(F). Table 1 reports the comparison of performance of
