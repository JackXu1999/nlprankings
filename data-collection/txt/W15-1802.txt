Abstract

In this talk, I will present our current work toward endowing virtual agents with
socio-emotional capabilities. I will start describing an interactive system of an
agent dialoging with human users in an emotionally colored manner. Through its
behaviors, the agent can sustain a conversation as well as show various attitudes
and levels of engagement. I will present our latest work on laughter. I will address
several issues such as: how to animate laughter in a virtual agent looking par-
ticularly at rhythmic movements; how to laugh with human participant and how
laughing agent is perceived.
