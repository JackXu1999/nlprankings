Abstract 

Depression is characterized by a self-
focused negative attentional bias, which is 
often reflected in everyday language use. 
In a prospective writing study, we 
explored whether the association between 
depressive symptoms and negative, self-
focused language varies across social 
contexts. College students (N = 243) wrote 
about a recent interaction with a person 
they care deeply about. Depression 
symptoms positively correlated with 
negative emotion words and first-person 
singular pronouns (or negative self-focus) 
when writing about a recent interaction 
with romantic partners or, to a lesser 
extent, friends, but not family members. 
The pattern of results was more 
pronounced when participants perceived 
greater self-other overlap (i.e., 
interpersonal closeness) with their 
romantic partner. Findings regarding how 
the linguistic profile of depression differs 
by type of relationship may inform more 
effective methods of clinical diagnosis 
and treatment. 

1 Introduction 

Depression is often characterized by a negative 
attentional bias, wherein depressed individuals 
view themselves and their surrounding 
environment negatively (Beck, 1967). For 
example, when listening to a string of words, 
depressed individuals are more likely to identify 
negative (rather than neutral) homophones (e.g., 
weak rather than week; Wenzlaff & Eisenberg, 
2001).  Depressed individuals also selectively 
recall negative more than positive experiences 
(Dalgleish & Werner-Seidler, 2014). Further, 
people who are currently depressed associate 
more negative and fewer positive traits with not 

only themselves, but also their parents and 
romantic partners (Gara et al., 1993).  

With depression affecting millions worldwide 
(WHO, 2018) and depression rates increasing for 
adolescents and young adults in particular 
(Twenge, Joiner, Rogers, & Martin, 2017), 
researchers across multiple fields are focused on 
finding more effective methods of early diagnosis 
and treatment. Research at the intersection of 
clinical psychology and computational 
linguistics has extensively examined depressed 
individuals’ language use as an alternative to 
more traditional self-report methods of 
measuring depressive symptomology. Self-
reports can be particularly limited when assessing 
mental health conditions, such as depression, 
which tend to be stigmatized (Crocker & Major, 
1989) and may involve biased self-perceptions 
(Beck, 1967; Beevers, 2005; c.f. Moore & 
Fresco, 2012). Given the limitations of self-
reports, it is necessary to supplement depression 
scales (e.g., Beck Depression Inventory-II, 
Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression 
Scale Revised) with less explicit measures.  

Language use may serve as an implicit, 
behavioral measure of depression. Many studies 
have found that high rates of first-person singular 
pronouns and negative emotion words correlate 
with higher levels of depression in a variety of 
contexts, such as public social media posts (De 
Choudhury, Counts, Horvitz, & Hoff, 2014; 
Eichstaedt et al., 2018; Schwartz et al., 2014), 
private expressive writing tasks (Rude, Gortner, 
& Pennebaker, 2004), and diagnostic clinical 
interviews (Zimmerman et al., 2016; see 
Holtzman, 2017 for a meta-analysis). Depressed 
individuals’ use of negative emotion words 
coincides with their negative attentional bias 
(Beevers, 2005) and emotion regulation deficits 
(Joorman & Stanton, 2016), while their use of 
first-person singular pronouns corresponds with

their tendency to ruminate (i.e., engage in 
repetitive negative thinking about the self; 
Watkins & Teasdale, 2001).  

Despite the clinical importance of behavioral 
indicators of mental health, effect sizes for the 
associations between language and depressive 
symptoms tend to be modest, which limits the use 
of language as a primary clinical outcome or 
ground truth (Baddeley, Pennebaker, & Beevers, 
2012; Holtzman, 2017). For example, recent 
research suggests that self-focused language in 
particular may be better understood as an 
indicator of vulnerability to stress (or 
neuroticism) rather than depression per se 
(Tackman et al., 2018). We propose that some 
questions about the stability of the links between 
language and mental health symptoms stem from 
differences in how individuals experience and 
express depressive symptoms across contexts. In 
the current study, we consider how linguistic 
indicators of depression—presumably reflecting 
depressive symptoms and self-regulatory 
processes—vary across written descriptions of 
recent interactions with family, friends, and 
romantic partners.  

Not all language categories are created equal. 
People tend to be less conscious of their use of 
function words (i.e., words that define syntax and 
express how people communicate, such as articles 
and pronouns) than content words (i.e., words that 
reflect conversation topic or what people are 
saying, such as nouns and verbs; Tausczik & 
Pennebaker, 2010). Function words make up a 
miniscule portion (<.1%) of the total words in an 
individual’s repertoire, yet they comprise over 
half of the words used in everyday conversation 
and writing (Chung & Pennebaker, 2007). In 
some instances, first-person singular pronouns (I, 
me, my) predict levels of depression to a greater 
degree than do negative emotion words (De 
Choudhury et al., 2014), perhaps because function 
words may be less easily regulated than content 
words (Bell, Brenier, Gregory, Girand, & 
Jurafsky, 2009; Garrod & Pickering, 2016).  

For example, mothers with postpartum 
depression (a major depressive episode following 
childbirth) were more likely to use first-person 
singular pronouns in their Facebook posts than 
were non-postpartum depression mothers, but 
their use of negative emotion words did not differ 
(De Choudhury et al., 2014). Follow-up 
interviews with those mothers revealed that many 

of their concerns with respect to posting about 
their depression stemmed from possible judgment 
from friends. Thus, content words (e.g., negative 
emotion words), which people are more conscious 
of, may be more easily censored in everyday 
language use, whereas function words (e.g., first-
person singular pronouns) and syntax are less 
easily censored as they are processed more 
rapidly (Segalowitz, & Lane, 2000), with less 
conscious attention and control (Pulvermüller, 
Shtyrov, Hasting, & Carlyon, 2008). 

Other social factors may play a role in the rate 
at which depressed people use certain content and 
function word categories. For instance, depressed 
individuals may disclose more or less while 
talking with certain people in their daily lives 
(Altman & Taylor, 1973). Specifically, students 
with higher levels of depression were more likely 
to use negative language while having a 
conversation with a friend rather than a stranger 
(Segrin & Flora, 1998). Naturalistic recordings of 
everyday life also show that depressed individuals 
are more likely to use negative emotion words in 
conjunction with self-focused speech (e.g., “I feel 
guilty”) as well as when speaking with romantic 
partners than others (e.g., coworkers; Baddeley et 
al., 2012). Perhaps depressed individuals feel less 
obligated to maintain a socially desirable front 
with and thus are more comfortable 
communicating negative affect to romantic 
partners. Alternately, close relationships may be a 
source of distress or depressive symptoms rather 
than a buffer against stress for some individuals 
in distressed relationships (Kiecolt-Glaser & 
Newton, 2001; Joyner, & Udry, 2000). Romantic 
breakups, which often follow a pattern of negative 
interactions with romantic partners (Gottman & 
Levenson, 2000), are a common trigger for 
adolescents’ first depressive episodes (Monroe, 
Rhode, Seeley, & Lewinsohn, 1999). 

Intimate relationships powerfully impact 
mental health, having the potential to both protect 
against and cause significant psychological 
distress. Close interpersonal relationships are 
typically viewed a hallmark of mental health, as 
they foster feelings of belongingness or satisfy the 
fundamental need to belong (i.e., people have a 
basic desire to develop long-term close 
relationships with others; Baumeister & Leary, 
1995). Decreased feelings of belongingness are 
strongly associated with depressive symptoms 
(Choenarom, Williams, & Hagerty, 2005; 



64

 

 
	

Hagerty & Williams, 1999). Furthermore, chronic 
self-focus is bidirectionally associated with 
loneliness (Cacioppo, Chen, & Cacioppo, 2017), 
and loneliness is a major risk factor for 
depression, independent of related constructs 
such as perceived social support and stress 
(Cacioppo, Hughes, Waite, Hawkley & Thisted, 
2006). Thus, decreased belongingness may serve 
as a possible mechanism that links negative 
emotion word and first-person singular pronoun 
use with depression. The social construct of 
belongingness may help explain why depressed 
individuals tend to use negative self-focused 
language in the presence of those close to them. 

1.1 Hypotheses 
Earlier research has focused on examining 
depressed individuals’ language use in the context 
of in-person conversations with intimate versus 
non-intimate others (Baddeley et al., 2012; Segrin 
& Flora, 1998). We determined to test whether 
these results would replicate when depressed 
individuals reflect on and write about—rather 
than speak with—their significant others. In 
particular, we predict that when asked to think 
about and describe the most recent interaction 
with a romantic partner, close friend, or family 
member, those with higher levels of depression 
will be more likely to use negative self-focused 
language in their written responses.  

Furthermore, we hypothesize that depressed 
individuals’ language use in their written 
recollections of their significant other should be 
dependent on their level of belongingness or 
interpersonal closeness. In other words, those 
with higher levels of depression will use more 
negative self-focused language to a greater degree 
if they indicate higher levels of belongingness or 
interpersonal closeness with their indicated 
significant other. 

Finally, because anxiety is often co-morbid 
with depression and the two mental health 
conditions have significant symptomological 
overlap (i.e., both are characterized by negative 
affect and self-focus), it is important to determine 
whether any statistical effects are solely 
attributable to depression or may stem from 
anxiety as well (Tennen, Hall, & Affleck, 1995).  

2 Method 

Texas Tech University undergraduates enrolled in 
a general psychology course (N = 243; Mage = 
19.7, SDage = 2.94; 62.6% female) participated in 
an online survey for course credit. Three 
participants did not complete the depression scale 
and thus could not be included in the depression 
analyses. Upon providing their electronic consent, 
students were asked to take the time to reflect on 
one person in their life they deeply care about, 
such as a family member, a close friend, or a 
romantic partner. Once they successfully 
visualized this person in their mind, they were 
instructed to describe the last interaction they 
experienced with them in a detailed written 
response. Interactions were broadly defined, 
encompassing in-person as well as distant (e.g., 
over the phone or internet) encounters. 
Participants were asked to indicate the exact date 
of their interaction to ensure compliance with the 
request to write about the most recent interaction 
with a significant other. Less than 8% (n = 19) of 
the 243 participants identified dates that were 
significantly discrepant from the time of their 
participation in the study (>4 months, or roughly 
one semester). For each model reported below, 
our conclusions were identical when excluding 
those 19 participants from the sample. Following 
the writing task, participants completed various 
questionnaires in order to assess their mental state 
and demographic information. All 
questionnaires—including those on depression, 
anxiety, belongingness, and demographics—were 
administered after the writing task to avoid any 
potential carryover effects on individuals’ 
recollections or language use. 

2.1 Measures 
Depression. The Center for Epidemiologic 
Studies Depression Scale Revised (CESD-R; 
Eaton, Smith, Ybarra, Muntaner, & Tien, 2004) 
was used to measure participants’ depressive 
symptoms and categorize participants as having 
subclinical depression or not. The CESD-R 
includes 20 items, each of which belong to 
various symptom categories of depression: 
Dysphoria, anhedonia, appetite, sleep, 
thinking/concentration, worthlessness, fatigue, 
agitation, and suicidal ideation (Eaton et al., 
2004). Participants were asked to indicate how 
often they felt depressive symptoms (e.g., 



65

 

 
	

“Nothing made me happy”) over the past two 
weeks on a scale of 0 (not at all or less than one 
day last week) to 4 (nearly every day for two 
weeks; Eaton et al., 2004). Utilizing the CESD-
style scoring system, where the two highest 
responses are given the same score of 3 (Eaton et 
al., 2004), 53.8% of the present sample had a 
score of less than 16 and 46.3% had a score of 
equal to or greater than 16, meeting the criteria for 
subclinical depression (M = 16.6, SD = 13.3). 

Anxiety. In addition to the CESD-R, 
participants were given the Generalized Anxiety 
Disorder 7-Item (GAD-7; Spitzer, Kroenke, 
Williams, & Löwe, 2006) scale to assess their 
level of anxiety. Items comprised of GAD-7 are 
based on diagnostic criteria for generalized 
anxiety disorder, such as excessive anxiety (e.g., 
“Worrying too much about different things”), 
difficulty controlling anxiety (e.g., “Not being 
able to stop or control worrying”), and key 
symptoms associated with experiencing anxiety 
(e.g., “Becoming easily annoyed or irritable”; 
Spitzer et al., 2006). Participants were asked to 
rate how often they were experiencing each 
symptom on a scale of 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly 
every day) within the last two weeks (Spitzer et 
al., 2006). The current sample had relatively low 
anxiety (M = 6.8, SD = 5.8). Nearly half (46.5%) 
of the sample reported little to no anxiety (scoring 
0-4 on the GAD-7), 22.2% had mild anxiety 
(scoring 5-9), 19.8% had moderate anxiety 
(scoring 10-14), and 11.5% were severe (≥15). 

Belongingness. Three separate scales were 
used to measure the exploratory mechanism of 
belongingness: The Need to Belong (NTB; Leary, 
Kelly, Cottrell, & Schreindorfer, 2013) scale, the 
Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire (INQ; Van 
Orden, Cukrowicz, Witte, & Joiner, 2012), and 
the Inclusion of Other in the Self (IOS; Aron, 
Aron, & Smollan, 1992) scale.  

The NTB scale is a trait measure of 
belongingness consisting of ten items, wherein 
participants identify how strongly they agree or 
disagree (on a scale of 1 = strongly disagree to 5 
= strongly agree) with statements concerning 
their desire for interpersonal interaction and 
acceptance from others (e.g., “I do not like being 
alone” and “I want other people to accept me”; 
Leary et al., 2013).  

The INQ is a state measure of perceived 
burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness for 
which participants indicate how they feel each of 

15 statements (e.g., “These days, the people in my 
life would be better off if I were gone” and “These 
days, I feel disconnected from other people”) 
accurately represent their beliefs about 
themselves and others on a scale of 1 (not at all 
true) to 7 (very true; Van Orden et al., 2012).  

The IOS scale is a single-item measure of 
interpersonal closeness (Aron et al., 1992). 
Participants are presented with seven pairs of 
circles with varying degrees of overlap (Aron et 
al., 1992). For each pair, one circle represents the 
self and one circle represents the other (Aron et 
al., 1992). Participants identify which circle pair 
correctly embodies their relationship with a 
specified other (Aron et al., 1992; Figure 1). 
 

 
 
Figure 1: Levels of self and other overlap in the IOS 
scale (Aron et al., 1992).	 
 
In the present study, we asked participants to 
select the circles that best represented their 
relationship with the person they had previously 
described in the writing task. 

2.2 Computerized Text Analysis 
LIWC. Participant responses were analyzed with 
the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC; 
Pennebaker, Booth, Boyd, & Francis, 2015) 
software. LIWC is an objective measure that 
facilitates quantitative research in language. 
Users may import any given text(s) into the 
software, wherein LIWC outputs the frequency—
specifically, the percentage—of word categories 
in each text. LIWC compares each text to its 125 
psychological (affect, cognitive processes), 
topical (death, family), and grammatical 
(auxiliary verbs, personal pronouns) language 
categories. In the current study, we focused on 
rates of first-person singular pronouns (I, me, my) 
and negative emotion words (stress, resent, 
lonely). The negative emotion language category 
is made up of anxiety (upset, worry), anger (hate, 
annoy), and sadness (cry, hurt) words as well as 
some generic affective terms (bad, :(, apath*) that 



66

 

 
	

do not easily fit into specific subcategories. With 
negative emotion words and first-person singular 
pronouns positively correlated (r = .20, t(241) = 
3.15, p = .002, (95% CI [.07, .32]), we created a 
composite negative self-focus variable by 
averaging the standardized (i.e., z-scored) rates of 
negative emotion words and first-person singular 
pronouns.  

2.3 Statistical Analyses 
Regression analyses computed on R (version 3.5.2; 
R Core Team, 2018) assessed whether CESD-R 
levels of depression predicted negatively self-
focused language use moderated by significant 
other (i.e., romantic partner, close friend, or family 
member). We also regressed language use on the 
interaction among depression, significant other, 
and belongingness (or interpersonal closeness) 
with separate models for each measure of 
belongingness (i.e., NTB scale, INQ, and IOS 
scale). Lastly, all models described were re-
analyzed with GAD-7 levels of anxiety in place of 
CESD-R levels of depression. 

Depression, anxiety, as well as perceived 
burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness 
(measured by the INQ) were all positively skewed 
and subsequently log transformed. The remaining 
variables were either categorical (e.g., 
interpersonal closeness measured by the IOS scale) 
or normally distributed (e.g., negative self-focused 
language, belongingness measured by the NTB 
scale) and did not require transformation. All 
variables analyzed were standardized. 

3 Results 

3.1 Depression 
Consistent with our predictions, when writing 
about a loved one, significant other significantly 
moderated the association between depression 
and negative self-focused language, b = .37, SE = 
.14, t(234) = 2.63, p = .009, 95% CI [.09, .65]. 
Follow-up simple slope analyses revealed that 
those with higher levels of depression were 
significantly more likely to use negative self-
focused language when writing about the last 
interaction they had with romantic partners (b = 
.33, SE = .10, t(79) = 3.13, p = .002, 95% CI [.12, 
.53]) or, to a lesser extent, friends (b = .20, SE = 
.10, t(55) = 2.04, p = .046, 95% CI [.004, .40]), 
but not family members, b = -.05, SE = .10, t(100) 
= -0.45, p = .655, 95% CI [-.25, .16] (Figure 2).

Table 2: Simple slope results for the three-way 
interaction effect of depression, significant other, and 
IOS. p < .01**, p < .05*, p < .1† 
 

Partly consistent with our predictions, analyses 
revealed a marginal three-way interaction effect 
of depression, significant other, and inclusion of 
other in the self predicting negative self-focused 
language (b = .17, SE = .09, t(228) = 1.87, p = 
.063, 95% CI [-.01, .35]; Table 1). To assess the 
simple slopes of the interaction, we used a median 
split to convert IOS (median = 5) from a 7-level 
categorical variable to a 2-level categorical 
variable (i.e., Low IOS = scores of 5 and lower, 
High IOS = scores higher than 5). Simple slope 
analyses demonstrated that those with higher 
levels of depression were significantly more 
likely to use negative self-focused language when 
writing about an interaction with their romantic 
partner if they indicated high self-other overlap (b 
= .50, SE = .18, t(34) = 2.86, p = .007, 95% CI 
[.15, .86]; Figure 3).  

Simple slope analyses also indicated that those 
with higher levels of depression were 
significantly more likely to use negative self-
focused language when writing about a friend if 
they identified low self-other overlap (b = .26, SE 
= .12, t(40) = 2.15, p = .038, 95% CI  [.02, .50]; 
Figure 3). All other simple slopes regarding the 
interaction effect for depression, significant other, 
and inclusion of other in the self were 
nonsignificant (all ps > .05; see Table 2). 
Similarly, the two remaining three-way 
interaction effects with belongingness (as 
measured by the NTB scale) as well as with 
perceived burdensomeness and thwarted 
belongingness (as measured by the INQ) as 
separate moderators were nonsignificant (ps > .1; 
Table 1). 

3.2 Anxiety 
To determine whether the findings might also 
extend to anxiety, we ran all the aforementioned 
models replacing CESD-R depression with GAD-
7 anxiety. When writing about a loved one, 
significant other did not significantly moderate 

the association between anxiety and negative self-
focused language, b = -.02, SE = .14, t(237) = -
.13, p = .898, 95% CI [-.29, .26]. Three-way 
interaction effects with interpersonal closeness 
(as measured by the IOS scale; b = .11, SE = .09, 
t(231) = 1.23, p = .218, 95% CI [-.07, .29]) as well 
as with perceived burdensomeness and thwarted 
belongingness (as measured by the INQ; b = -.12, 
SE = .14, t(230) = -.86, p = .389, 95% CI [-.39, 
.15]) as separate moderators were not significant. 
Results showed a significant three-way 
interaction effect of anxiety, significant other, and 
belongingness (as measured by the NTB scale) 
predicting negative self-focused language (b = -
.32, SE = .16, t(231) = -2.02, p = .045, 95% CI [-
.62, -.01]). However, follow-up simple slope tests 
did not reach significance (all ps > .05), 
suggesting that the social mechanisms of negative 
self-focused language implicated in depression 
may not extend to anxiety. Alternatively, our 
sample may simply have had insufficient levels of 
anxiety. With roughly 32% of the sample 
identifying as moderately to severely anxious 
(compared with about half of the sample scoring 
as subclinically depressed), a lack of power could 
explain the null effects regarding anxiety. 

4 Discussion  

Due to stigma against mental illness and 
individuals’ desire to be viewed positively, people 
may be reluctant to openly disclose depressive 
symptoms on self-report surveys or in daily 
interactions. Individuals with depression perceive 
themselves and the world around them in a 
negative light (Beck, 1967). Although this 
negative attentional bias is reflected in everyday 
language use in conversations with romantic 
partners (Baddeley et al., 2012) and friends 
(Segrin & Flora, 1998), depressed individuals 
tend to not use more negative language than 
others on average (e.g., in naturalistic recordings 
of students’ conversations over the course of 2 
week days; Mehl, 2006).  

Extending findings from naturalistic 
recordings of spoken conversations, we found that 
depressed individuals are more likely to use 
negative self-focused language when writing 
about romantic partners and friends but not 
family. Such results are consistent with past 
research on depression and recall, which suggest 
that depressed individuals have a tendency to 
attend to (Beevers, 2005) and remember 



68

 

 
	

(Dalgleish & Werner-Seidler, 2014) negative 
stimuli more than positive or neutral stimuli.  

In addition, our analyses revealed that 
interpersonal closeness might serve as a potential 
mechanism to help understand depressed 
individuals’ recall of and disclosure to romantic 
partners and friends. Specifically, depressed 
individuals perceiving a high overlap between 
themselves and their romantic partner as well as 
depressed individuals perceiving a low overlap 
between themselves and their friend were more 
likely to use negative self-focused language in 
their written recollections.  

Perhaps depressed individuals view their 
romantic partners as an extension of themselves 
and, thus, feel more comfortable ruminating while 
thinking about them. For example, one participant 
scoring high on CESD-R depression (score = 54), 
interpersonal closeness (IOS = 7), and negative 
(4.01%) self-focused (7.66%) language describes 
their relationship with their partner as such: 
 

“We are two stubborn asses that have 
everything at our damn finger tips and 
too stupid, stubborn, and prideful to 
move forward … I’m so frustrated I think 
I’ll have to buy a new keyboard when I’m 
done here.” 

 
In the first sentence, this participant confirms 
their interpersonal closeness, relaying how they 
perceive their partner as quite similar to 
themselves. In the second sentence, the 
participant demonstrates their negative self-focus, 
expressing their own frustration of the encounter. 
In cases like this, perhaps interpersonal closeness 
with a romantic partner exacerbates depressive 
symptomology, particularly if the partner shares 
their negative affective tendencies. Being 
exposed to negative self-relevant stimuli—such 
as seeing negative aspects of the self reflected in 
a romantic partner—triggers episodes of 
rumination, which in turn aggravates symptoms 
of depression (Beevers, 2005). 

On the other hand, another participant scoring 
a bit lower on CESD-R depression (score = 29)—
but still meeting criteria for subclinical 
depression—interpersonal closeness (IOS = 6), 
and negative (1.33%) self-focused (11.95%) 
language discusses how they feel comfortable 
disclosing to their close friend: 
 

“In the past, when I have felt like I could 
not talk to anyone else about my 
problems and the things that are causing 
me stress, I have always been able to vent 
my issues to him.” 

 
The participant’s recollection of their close friend 
appears to embody a more adaptive style of coping 
than the previous participant’s almost violent 
frustration with their romantic partner. Examining 
the discrepancy between these two participant 
responses reveals how interpersonal closeness with 
a significant other may be helpful for depressed 
individuals to a certain extent. Specifically, if the 
depressed individual perceives themselves as 
indistinguishable from their significant other 
because of shared negative experiences or traits, 
such interpersonal overlap may heighten 
depression by triggering rumination. In contrast, if 
the depressed individual perceives a strong self-
other overlap because they feel that they may rely 
on that person for support, such interpersonal 
closeness may alleviate depressive symptomology.  

Closeness, rather than the relationship type per 
se, may be responsible for differences in negativity 
across recalled interactions. Perceived 
interpersonal closeness tends to be stronger with 
romantic partners than with friends (Quintard, 
Jouffre, Croizet, & Bouquet, 2018), which may 
account for the significant interaction effect 
involving depressed individuals’ high rates of 
negative self-focused language when recalling an 
experience with a friend they were less 
interpersonally close with. In other words, if 
perceived self-other overlap is inherently less 
between friends than romantic partners, then it 
stands to reason that the positive correlation 
between depression and negative self-focused 
language is robust for low rather than high IOS. 

In any case, social support is heavily implicated 
as a proponent of relieving stress and promoting 
positive (mental and physical) health outcomes 
(Cohen & Wills, 1985). However, depressed 
individuals tend to withdraw from their social 
networks (Segrin, 2000; Segrin & Abramson, 
1994). During depressive episodes—when social 
support is arguably needed most—individuals with 
depression may feel as though they do not belong 
and struggle to seek or obtain help (Schaefer, 
Kornienko, & Fox, 2011). Being able to rely on a 
significant other may lessen the degree of social 
repercussions of depression. Thus, differences in 



69

 

 
	

how depressed individuals use language with the 
people in their lives could potentially inform more 
effective methods of diagnosis and treatment of the 
disorder. Future research will explore social-
cognitive mechanisms that may explain 
discrepancies in how depressive symptoms 
manifest in language use across social contexts. 

4.1 Future Directions and Limitations 
The present results converge with previous 
findings regarding everyday interactions with 
romantic partners (Baddeley et al., 2012). That is, 
people’s recollections of recent interactions align 
with naturalistic data on how those conversations 
actually unfold. In particular, the rate at which 
negative self-focused language is used similarly 
across recollections and recordings of 
conversations with romantic partners provides 
further evidence of depressed individuals’ negative 
attentional bias. However, our results are limited 
by the fact that—unlike Baddeley et al. (2012)—
we cannot compare across interactions within 
person. It may be useful, in future studies, to use 
within-person designs to examine how the same 
person discusses family, friends, romantic partners, 
and acquaintances or colleagues.  

The present study took a simplified approach to 
analyzing individuals’ language use, focusing 
exclusively on two robust dictionary-based 
markers of depression: negative emotion words 
and first-person singular pronouns. We adopted 
that approach partly because the texts we analyzed 
were from a modest sample of individuals writing 
relatively short texts. In larger samples, it would be 
possible to apply more complex models of 
depressed and depression-prone language built, in 
part, on the results of larger social media studies or 
corpus analyses (Coppersmith, Dredze, Harman, & 
Hollingshead, 2015; Eichstaedt et al., 2018; 
Mowery et al., 2017; Resnik, Armstrong, 
Claudino, Nguyen, Nguyen, & Boyd-Graber, 
2015; for a review, see Guntuku, Yaden, Kern, 
Ungar, & Eichstaedt, 2017). Such models could 
provide a more complete picture of the degree to 
which a depressed or at-risk individual “sounds” 
depressed—or uses linguistic features correlated 
with depression—across social contexts. Word or 
phrase-level analyses can be psychologically 
revealing in large samples (N > ~5,000) but do not 
generalize well to smaller samples, where 
particular word-level indicators of depression 

symptoms may only appear in a small percentage 
of total texts (Schwartz et al., 2013).  

The aim of studying a nonclinical population 
was partly to advance research on preventing 
depression in individuals with subclinical 
depression or risk factors for depression. However, 
because our results are cross-sectional and 
correlational, it remains unclear whether 
participants’ increased negative self-focus in 
recollections of interactions with romantic partners 
represents a risk factor for future depression, a 
cause of depressive symptoms, or an adaptive way 
of dealing with early depressive symptoms.  

Selectively recalling or disclosing negative 
affect (or “venting”) with romantic partners and 
masking depression symptoms from close friends 
and family may be an effective coping strategy, 
given that depression tends to cause friends to 
withdraw (Schaefer et al., 2011). To the degree that 
people are aware of the stigma against mental 
health conditions or depression, they may 
strategically disclose negative emotions to the 
people with whom they are most securely attached, 
which for a majority of adults is likely to be 
romantic partners more often than friends or family 
(Feeney, 2004). Indeed, although self-disclosure is 
overall healthy for individuals and relationships 
(Hendrick, 1981), the most personal disclosures—
such as discussing depressive symptoms—are 
commonly reserved for one or two close friends or 
partners (Altman & Taylor, 1973; Saramäki et al., 
2014). 

To further understand how people interact with 
and think about various others in their lives, future 
research may focus on separately analyzing 
recollections of recent versus salient interactions 
(i.e., asking participants in the same study to 
recount the most recent and the most impactful or 
memorable interactions with family, friends, and 
romantic partners). For romantic partners in 
particular, it may be the case that currently-
depressed individuals’ most recent interactions are 
largely negative (reflecting their present mental 
state), but their most salient memories of that 
person will be positive to the degree that they feel 
close or securely attached with them. 

Also of interest for future research is uncovering 
why recent recollections of family members do not 
seem to impact depressed individuals’ language 
use. Depressed individuals may mask their 
negative self-focused symptoms during 
interactions with family so as to prevent them from 



70

 

 
	

worrying about them. Although depression is 
stigmatized across multiple social contexts (Halter, 
2004), concealing depressive symptoms in order to 
protect family members may ironically be more 
prevalent in cultures that are more collectivist or 
place more importance on family, such as Latinx 
communities (Uebelacker et al., 2012).  

An alternate explanation of our results is that 
family members may elicit less negative affect than 
do romantic partners. However, our preliminary 
(not yet published) results from a comparison of 
how depression forum users talk about their 
relationships across diverse forums on Reddit 
(based on posts containing variations of the phrase 
“my [social role],” e.g., “my dad”) suggest that 
family members are described more negatively on 
social media than are friends or romantic partners. 
Based on those findings and the present results, we 
speculate that although depressed or depression-
vulnerable individuals’ everyday interactions with 
family members are low in negative affect, family 
members elicit at least as much negative affect as 
romantic partners or friends in general. 

Our research may have relevance for therapeutic 
treatment of depression, especially in the context 
of family systems therapy or couple therapy. 
Observing how partners or family members 
interact, asking about recent interactions, and 
identifying potentially dysfunctional behaviors in 
these interactions are typically key parts of family 
systems and couple therapies, across therapeutic 
approaches (Barbato & D’Avanzo, 2008; 
Minuchin, 2013). Quantitative and qualitative text 
analyses have the potential to further inform how 
clients’ symptoms vary across interactions with 
family and romantic partners, which in turn may 
help clinicians provide tailored advice on how to 
navigate important relationships in their lives.  

Finally, the impact of our conclusions must be 
tempered by the fact that our results are from one 
relatively small, correlational study of writing by 
college students. Our trust in the present findings is 
buttressed by the fact that they align with previous 
work (e.g., Baddeley et al., 2012); however, future 
replications based on larger and more diverse 
samples are necessary before substantially building 
on these results.  Other limitations include latent 
(unmeasured) variables, such as relationship length 
and the flexibility with which participants’ most 
recent interactions were defined (remote vs. in-
person). For instance, perceived belongingness or 
interpersonal closeness may be a function of how 

long the individuals have been romantic partners or 
friends—that is, longer relationships may predict 
stronger feelings of belongingness. Also, whether 
participants’ interactions were over the phone, in 
person, or computer-mediated may play a role in 
what they are able to recall (e.g., in-person 
conversations may be more salient and thus allow 
for more vivid or accurate recollections). Future 
research should incorporate such variables into the 
current models. 

4.2 Conclusion 
A prospective, exploratory writing study assessed 
the association between interpersonal closeness, 
depression, and the language used to describe 
intimate relationships. We found that self-focused 
negativity positively correlates with self-reported 
depressive symptoms in recollections of recent 
interactions with close romantic partners, but not 
close family or friends.  

Our results underline the importance of 
considering how symptoms of mental health 
conditions manifest differently across social 
contexts. Past mixed results regarding the 
linguistic signature of depression (Holtzman, 
2017; Tackman et al., 2018) or, more broadly, 
positive and negative affect (Sun, Schwartz, Son, 
Kern, & Vazire, 2019), may be partly due to the 
self-regulatory exigencies of different relationships 
and social interactions. People do not experience 
mental health symptoms in a vacuum, but rather 
interact dynamically with their physical and social 
environments. Individuals take on different roles—
and to some degree become different people, who 
may have different constellations of mental health 
symptoms and reveal those symptoms in different 
ways—across various social contexts.  

The end goal of most computational linguistics 
research on mental health is arguably to not only 
identify linguistic features that correlate with some 
clinical outcome, but also to improve clinical 
diagnosis and treatment. We argue, and our results 
suggest, that we can only advance from the lab to 
reality, or predictive models to practice, by 
increasingly taking the nuances of person-situation 
interactions into consideration. We propose that 
research in this area should consider not only 
practical aspects of the environment, such as topics 
or social media platforms, but also social 
psychological variables, including individuals’ 
relationships with and closeness to the people they 
are discussing.
