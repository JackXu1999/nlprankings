Abstract
We present the SemEval-2018 Task 1: Affect
in Tweets, which includes an array of subtasks
on inferring the affectual state of a person from
their tweet. For each task, we created labeled
data from English, Arabic, and Spanish tweets.
The individual tasks are: 1. emotion intensity
regression, 2. emotion intensity ordinal classi-
fication, 3. valence (sentiment) regression, 4.
valence ordinal classification, and 5. emotion
classification. Seventy-five teams (about 200
team members) participated in the shared task.
We summarize the methods, resources, and
tools used by the participating teams, with a
focus on the techniques and resources that are
particularly useful. We also analyze systems
for consistent bias towards a particular race or
gender. The data is made freely available to
further improve our understanding of how peo-
ple convey emotions through language.

1 Introduction

Emotions are central to language and thought.
They are familiar and commonplace, yet they are
complex and nuanced. Humans are known to per-
ceive hundreds of different emotions. Accord-
ing to the basic emotion model (aka the categor-
ical model) (Ekman, 1992; Plutchik, 1980; Par-
rot, 2001; Frijda, 1988), some emotions, such
as joy, sadness, and fear, are more basic than
others—physiologically, cognitively, and in terms
of the mechanisms to express these emotions.
Each of these emotions can be felt or expressed
in varying intensities. For example, our ut-
terances can convey that we are very angry,
slightly sad, absolutely elated, etc. Here, inten-
sity refers to the degree or amount of an emo-
tion such as anger or sadness.1 As per the
valence–arousal–dominance (VAD) model (Rus-
sell, 1980, 2003), emotions are points in a

extent to which an emotion is calming or exciting.

three-dimensional space of valence (positiveness–
negativeness), arousal (active–passive), and domi-
nance (dominant–submissive). We use the term af-
fect to refer to various emotion-related categories
such as joy, fear, valence, and arousal.

Natural language applications in commerce,
public health, disaster management, and public
policy can benefit from knowing the affectual
states of people—both the categories and the
intensities of the emotions they feel. We thus
present the SemEval-2018 Task 1: Affect in
Tweets, which includes an array of subtasks where
automatic systems have to infer the affectual state
of a person from their tweet.2 We will refer to
the author of a tweet as the tweeter. Some of the
tasks are on the intensities of four basic emotions
common to many proposals of basic emotions:
anger, fear, joy, and sadness. Some of the tasks
are on valence or sentiment intensity. Finally, we
include an emotion classification task over eleven
emotions commonly expressed in tweets.3 For
each task, we provide separate training, develop-
ment, and test datasets for English, Arabic, and
Spanish tweets. The tasks are as follows:

1. Emotion Intensity Regression (EI-reg): Given
a tweet and an emotion E, determine the inten-
sity of E that best represents the mental state
of the tweeter—a real-valued score between 0
(least E) and 1 (most E);

2. Emotion Intensity Ordinal Classification (EI-
oc): Given a tweet and an emotion E, classify
the tweet into one of four ordinal classes of
intensity of E that best represents the mental
state of the tweeter;

3. Valence (Sentiment) Regression (V-reg): Given
a tweet, determine the intensity of sentiment or
valence (V) that best represents the mental state

of the tweeter—a real-valued score between 0
(most negative) and 1 (most positive);

4. Valence Ordinal Classification (V-oc): Given
a tweet, classify it into one of seven ordinal
classes, corresponding to various levels of
positive and negative sentiment intensity, that
best represents the mental state of the tweeter;

5. Emotion Classification (E-c): Given a tweet,
classify it as ‘neutral or no emotion’ or as one,
or more, of eleven given emotions that best
represent the mental state of the tweeter.

Here, E refers to emotion, EI refers to emotion
intensity, V refers to valence, reg refers to regres-
sion, oc refers to ordinal classification, c refers to
classification.

For each language, we create a large single tex-
tual dataset, subsets of which are annotated for
many emotion (or affect) dimensions (from both
the basic emotion model and the VAD model). For
each emotion dimension, we annotate the data not
just for coarse classes (such as anger or no anger)
but also for fine-grained real-valued scores indi-
cating the intensity of emotion. We use Best–
Worst Scaling (BWS), a comparative annotation
method, to address the limitations of traditional
rating scale methods such as inter- and intra-
annotator inconsistency. We show that the fine-
grained intensity scores thus obtained are reliable
(repeat annotations lead to similar scores). In to-
tal, about 700,000 annotations were obtained from
about 22,000 English, Arabic, and Spanish tweets.

Seventy-five teams (about 200 team members)
participated in the shared task, making this the
largest SemEval shared task to date. In total, 319
submissions were made to the 15 task–language
pairs. Each team was allowed only one official
submission for each task–language pair. We sum-
marize the methods, resources, and tools used by
the participating teams, with a focus on the tech-
niques and resources that are particularly useful.
We also analyze system predictions for consistent
bias towards a particular race or gender using a
corpus specifically compiled for that purpose. We
find that a majority of systems consistently assign
higher scores to sentences involving one race or
gender. We also find that the bias may change
depending on the specific affective dimension be-
ing predicted. All of the tweet data (labeled and
unlabeled), annotation questionnaires, evaluation
scripts, and the bias evaluation corpus are made
freely available on the task website.

2 Building on Past Work

There is a large body of prior work on sen-
timent and emotion classification (Mohammad,
2016). There is also growing work on related
tasks such as stance detection (Mohammad et al.,
2017) and argumentation mining (Wojatzki et al.,
2018; Palau and Moens, 2009). However, there is
little work on detecting the intensity of affect in
text. Mohammad and Bravo-Marquez (2017) cre-
ated the first datasets of tweets annotated for anger,
fear, joy, and sadness intensities. Given a focus
emotion, each tweet was annotated for intensity of
the emotion felt by the speaker using a technique
called Best–Worst Scaling (BWS) (Louviere, 1991;
Kiritchenko and Mohammad, 2016, 2017).

BWS is an annotation scheme that addresses
the limitations of traditional rating scale methods,
such as inter- and intra-annotator inconsistency, by
employing comparative annotations. Note that at
its simplest, comparative annotations involve giv-
ing people pairs of items and asking which item is
greater in terms of the property of interest. How-
ever, such a method requires annotations for N2

items, which can be prohibitively large.
In BWS, annotators are given n items (an n-

tuple, where n > 1 and commonly n = 4). They
are asked which item is the best (highest in terms
of the property of interest) and which is the worst
(lowest in terms of the property of interest). When
working on 4-tuples, best–worst annotations are
particularly efficient because each best and worst
annotation will reveal the order of five of the six
item pairs. For example, for a 4-tuple with items
A, B, C, and D, if A is the best, and D is the
worst, then A > B, A > C, A > D, B > D, and
C > D. Real-valued scores of association between
the items and the property of interest can be de-
termined using simple arithmetic on the number
of times an item was chosen best and number of
times it was chosen worst (as described in Section
3.4.2) (Orme, 2009; Flynn and Marley, 2014).

It has been empirically shown that annotations
for 2N 4-tuples is sufficient for obtaining reliable
scores (where N is the number of items) (Louviere,
1991; Kiritchenko and Mohammad, 2016). Kir-
itchenko and Mohammad (2017) showed through
empirical experiments that BWS produces more
reliable and more discriminating scores than those
obtained using rating scales. (See (Kiritchenko
and Mohammad, 2016, 2017) for further details on
BWS.)

Mohammad and Bravo-Marquez (2017) col-
lected and annotated 7,100 English tweets posted
in 2016. We will refer to the tweets alone
as Tweets-2016, and the tweets and annotations
together as the Emotion Intensity Dataset (or,
EmoInt Dataset). This dataset was used in the
2017 WASSA Shared Task on Emotion Intensity.4

We build on that earlier work by first compiling
a new set of English, Arabic, and Spanish tweets
posted in 2017 and annotating the new tweets for
emotion intensity in a similar manner. We will re-
fer to this new set of tweets as Tweets-2017. Simi-
lar to the work by Mohammad and Bravo-Marquez
(2017), we create four subsets annotated for inten-
sity of fear, joy, sadness, and anger, respectively.
However, unlike the earlier work, here a common
dataset of tweets is annotated for all three negative
emotions: fear, anger, and sadness. This allows
one to study the relationship between the three ba-
sic negative emotions.

We also annotate tweets sampled from each of
the four basic emotion subsets (of both Tweets-
2016 and Tweets-2017) for degree of valence. An-
notations for arousal, dominance, and other basic
emotions such as surprise and anticipation are left
for future work.

In addition to knowing a fine-grained score
indicating degree of intensity, it is also useful to
qualitatively ground the information on whether
the intensity is high, medium, low, etc. Thus, we
manually identify ranges in intensity scores that
correspond to these coarse classes. For each of the
four emotions E, the 0 to 1 range is partitioned
into the classes: no E can be inferred, low E
can be inferred, moderate E can be inferred,
and high E can be inferred. This data can be
used for developing systems that predict the
ordinal class of emotion intensity (EI ordinal
classification, or EI-oc, systems). We partition
the 0 to 1 interval of valence into: very negative,
moderately negative, slightly negative, neutral
or mixed, slightly positive, moderately positive,
and very positive mental state of the tweeter can
be inferred. This data can be used to develop
systems that predict the ordinal class of valence
(valence ordinal classification, or V-oc, systems).5

5Note that valence ordinal classification is the traditional

sentiment analysis task most commonly explored in NLP lit-
erature. The classes may vary from just three (positive, nega-
tive, and neutral) to five, seven, or nine finer classes.

Finally, the full Tweets-2016 and Tweets-2017
datasets are annotated for the presence of eleven
emotions: anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy,
love, optimism, pessimism, sadness, surprise, and
trust. This data can be used for developing multi-
label emotion classification, or E-c, systems. Ta-
ble 1 shows the two stages in which the anno-
tations for English tweets were done. The Ara-
bic and Spanish tweets were all only from 2017.
Together, we will refer to the joint set of tweets
from Tweets-2016 and Tweets-2017 along with all
the emotion-related annotations described above
as the SemEval-2018 Affect in Tweets Dataset (or
AIT Dataset for short).

3 The Affect in Tweets Dataset

We now present how we created the Affect in
Tweets Dataset. We present only the key details
here; a detailed description of the English datasets
and the analysis of various affect dimensions is
available in Mohammad and Kiritchenko (2018).

3.1 Compiling English Tweets

We first compiled tweets to be included in the four
EI-reg datasets corresponding to anger, fear, joy,
and sadness. The EI-oc datasets include the same
tweets as in EI-reg, that is, the Anger EI-oc dataset
has the same tweets as in the Anger EI-reg dataset,
the Fear EI-oc dataset has the same tweets as in the
Fear EI-reg dataset, and so on. However, the labels
for EI-oc tweets are ordinal classes instead of real-
valued intensity scores. The V-reg dataset includes
a subset of tweets from each of the four EI-reg
emotion datasets. The V-oc dataset has the same
tweets as in the V-reg dataset. The E-c dataset in-
cludes all the tweets from the four EI-reg datasets.
The total number of instances in the E-c, EI-reg,
EI-oc, V-reg, and V-oc datasets is shown in the last
column of Table 3.

3.1.1 Basic Emotion Tweets
To create a dataset of tweets rich in a particu-
lar emotion, we used the following methodology.

3



For each emotion X, we selected 50 to 100 terms
that were associated with that emotion at differ-
ent intensity levels. For example, for the anger
dataset, we used the terms: angry, mad, frustrated,
annoyed, peeved, irritated, miffed, fury, antago-
nism, and so on. We will refer to these terms as
the query terms. The query terms we selected in-
cluded emotion words listed in the Roget’s The-
saurus, nearest neighbors of these emotion words
in a word-embeddings space, as well as commonly
used emoji and emoticons. The full list of the
query terms is available on the task website.

We polled the Twitter API, over the span of two
months (June and July, 2017), for tweets that in-
cluded the query terms. We randomly selected
1,400 tweets from the joy set for annotation of in-
tensity of joy. For the three negative emotions,
we first randomly selected 200 tweets each from
their corresponding tweet collections. These 600
tweets were annotated for all three negative emo-
tions so that we could study the relationships be-
tween fear and anger, between anger and sadness,
and between sadness and fear. For each of the
negative emotions, we also chose 800 additional
tweets, from their corresponding tweet sets, that
were annotated only for the corresponding emo-
tion. Thus, the number of tweets annotated for
each of the negative emotions was also 1,400 (the
600 included in all three negative emotions + 800
unique to the focus emotion). For each emotion,
100 tweets that had an emotion-word hashtag,
emoticon, or emoji query term at the end (trailing
query term) were randomly chosen. We removed
the trailing query terms from these tweets. As a
result, the dataset also included some tweets with
no clear emotion-indicative terms.

Thus, the EI-reg dataset included 1,400 new
tweets for each of the four emotions. These were
annotated for intensity of emotion. Note that the
EmoInt dataset already included 1,500 to 2,300
tweets per emotion annotated for intensity. Those
tweets were not re-annotated. The EmoInt EI-reg
tweets as well as the new EI-reg tweets were both
annotated for ordinal classes of emotion (EI-oc) as
described in Section 3.4.3

The new EI-reg tweets formed the EI-reg de-
velopment (dev) and test sets in the AIT task; the
number of instances in each is shown in the third
and fourth columns of Table 3. The EmoInt tweets
formed the training set.6

3.1.2 Valence Tweets
The valence dataset included tweets from the new
EI-reg set and the EmoInt set. The new EI-reg
tweets included were all 600 tweets common to
the three negative emotion tweet sets and 600 ran-
domly chosen joy tweets. The EmoInt tweets in-
cluded were 600 randomly chosen joy tweets and
200 each, randomly chosen tweets, for anger, fear,
and sadness. To study valence in sarcastic tweets,
we also included 200 tweets that had hashtags
#sarcastic, #sarcasm, #irony, or #ironic (tweets
that are likely to be sarcastic). Thus the V-reg
set included 2,600 tweets in total. The V-oc set is
comprised of the same tweets as in the V-reg set.

3.1.3 Multi-Label Emotion Tweets
We selected all of the 2016 and 2017 tweets in the
four EI-reg datasets to form the E-c dataset, which
is annotated for presence/absence of 11 emotions.

3.2 Compiling Arabic Tweets
We compiled the Arabic tweets in a similar
manner to the English dataset. We obtained the
the Arabic query terms as follows:

• We translated the English query terms for the
four emotions to Arabic using Google Translate.
• All words associated with the four emotions in

the NRC Emotion Lexicon were translated into
Arabic. (We discarded incorrect translations.)
• We trained word embeddings on a tweet corpus

collected using dialectal function words as
queries. We used nearest neighbors of the
emotion query terms in the word-embedding
space as additional query terms.
• We included the same emoji used in English for

anger, fear, joy and sadness. However, most of
the fear emoji were not included, as they were
rarely associated with fear in Arabic tweets.

In total, we used 550 Arabic query terms and
emoji to poll the Twitter API to collect around
17 million tweets between March and July 2017.
For each of the four emotions, we randomly se-
lected 1,400 tweets to form the EI-reg datasets.
The same tweets were used for building the EI-
oc datasets. The sets of tweets for the negative
emotions included 800 tweets unique to the focus
emotion and 600 tweets common to the three neg-
ative emotions.
vealed that it included some near-duplicate tweets. We kept
only one copy of such pairs. Thus the dev. and test set num-
bers add up to a little lower than 1,400.

4



The V-reg dataset was formed by including
about 900 tweets from the three negative emotions
(including the 600 tweets common to the three
negative emotion datasets), and about 900 tweets
for joy. The same tweets were used to form the V-
oc dataset. The multi-label emotion classification
dataset was created by taking all the tweets in the
EI-reg datasets.

3.3 Compiling Spanish Tweets
The Spanish query terms were obtained as fol-
lows:

• The English query terms were translated into
Spanish using Google Translate. The transla-
tions were manually examined by a Spanish
native speaker, and incorrect translations were
discarded.

• The resulting set was expanded using synonyms
taken from a Spanish lexicographic resource,
Wordreference7.

• We made sure that both masculine and fem-
inine forms of the nouns and adjectives were
included.

• We included the same emoji used in English
for anger, sadness, and joy. The emoji for
fear where not included, as tweets contain-
ing those emoji were rarely associated with fear.

We collected about 1.2 million tweets between
July and September 2017. We annotated close to
2,000 tweets for each emotion. The sets of tweets
for the negative emotions included ∼1,500 tweets
unique to the focus emotion and ∼500 tweets
common to the two remaining negative emotions.
The same tweets were used for building the Span-
ish EI-oc dataset.

The V-reg dataset was formed by including
about 1,100 tweets from the three negative emo-
tions (including the 750 tweets common to the
three negative emotion datasets), about 1,100
tweets for joy, and 268 tweets with sarcastic hash-
tags (#sarcasmo, #ironia). The same tweets were
used to build the V-oc dataset. The multi-label
emotion classification dataset was created by tak-
ing all the tweets in the EI-reg and V-reg datasets.

3.4 Annotating Tweets
We describe below how we annotated the English
tweets. The same procedure was used for Arabic
and Spanish annotations.

7http://www.wordreference.com/sinonimos/

We annotated all of our data by crowdsourcing.
The tweets and annotation questionnaires were
uploaded on the crowdsourcing platform, Figure
Eight (earlier called CrowdFlower).8 All the anno-
tation tasks described in this paper were approved
by the National Research Council Canada’s Insti-
tutional Review Board.

About 5% of the tweets in each task were an-
notated internally beforehand (by the authors of
this paper). These tweets are referred to as gold
tweets. The gold tweets were interspersed with
other tweets. If a crowd-worker got a gold tweet
question wrong, they were immediately notified of
the error. If the worker’s accuracy on the gold
tweet questions fell below 70%, they were re-
fused further annotation, and all of their annota-
tions were discarded. This served as a mechanism
to avoid malicious annotations.

3.4.1 Multi-Label Emotion Annotation
We presented one tweet at a time to the annotators
and asked which of the following options best de-
scribed the emotional state of the tweeter:
– anger (also includes annoyance, rage)

– anticipation (also includes interest, vigilance)

– disgust (also includes disinterest, dislike, loathing)

– fear (also includes apprehension, anxiety, terror)

– joy (also includes serenity, ecstasy)

– love (also includes affection)

– optimism (also includes hopefulness, confidence)

– pessimism (also includes cynicism, no confidence)

– sadness (also includes pensiveness, grief)

– surprise (also includes distraction, amazement)

– trust (also includes acceptance, liking, admiration)

– neutral or no emotion

Example tweets were provided in advance with ex-
amples of suitable responses.

On the Figure Eight task settings, we specified
that we needed annotations from seven people for
each tweet. However, because of the way the gold
tweets were set up, they were annotated by more
than seven people. The median number of anno-
tations was still seven. In total, 303 people anno-
tated between 10 and 4,670 tweets each. A total of
174,356 responses were obtained.
Annotation Aggregation: One of the criticisms
for several natural language annotation projects
has been that they keep only the instances with
high agreement, and discard instances that obtain
low agreements. The high agreement instances

tend to be simple instantiations of the classes of
interest, and are easier to model by automatic sys-
tems. However, when deployed in the real world,
natural language systems have to recognize and
process more complex and subtle instantiations of
a natural language phenomenon. Thus, discarding
all but the high agreement instances does not fa-
cilitate the development of systems that are able to
handle the difficult instances appropriately.

Therefore, we chose a somewhat generous ag-
gregation criterion: if more than 25% of the re-
sponses (two out of seven people) indicated that a
certain emotion applies, then that label was cho-
sen. We will refer to this aggregation as Ag2. If no
emotion got at least 40% of the responses (three
out of seven people) and more than 50% of the re-
sponses indicated that the tweet was neutral, then
the tweet was marked as neutral. In the vast ma-
jority of the cases, a tweet was labeled either as
neutral or with one or more of the eleven emotion
labels. 107 English tweets, 14 Arabic tweets, and
88 Spanish tweets did not receive sufficient votes
to be labeled a particular emotion or to be labeled
neutral. These very-low-agreement tweets were
set aside. We will refer to the remaining dataset
as E-c (Ag2), or simply E-c, data.
Class Distribution: Table 2 shows the percent-
age of tweets that were labeled with a given emo-
tion using Ag2 aggregation. The numbers in these
rows sum up to more than 100% because a tweet
may be labeled with more than one emotion. Ob-
serve that joy, anger, disgust, sadness, and opti-
mism get a high number of the votes. Trust and
surprise are two of the lowest voted emotions.

3.4.2 Annotating Intensity with BWS

We followed the procedure described by Kir-
itchenko and Mohammad (2016) to obtain best–
worst scaling (BWS) annotations.

Every 4-tuple was annotated by four indepen-
dent annotators. The questionnaires were devel-
oped through internal discussions and pilot anno-
tations. They are available on the SemEval-2018
AIT Task webpage.

Between 118 and 220 people residing in the
United States annotated the 4-tuples for each of

the four emotions and valence. In total, around
27K responses for each of the four emotions and
around 50K responses for valence were obtained.9

Annotation Aggregation: The intensity scores
were calculated from the BWS responses using
a simple counting procedure (Orme, 2009; Flynn
and Marley, 2014): For each item, the score is the
proportion of times the item was chosen as having
the most intensity minus the percentage of times
the item was chosen as having the least intensity.10

We linearly transformed the scores to lie in the 0
(lowest intensity) to 1 (highest intensity) range.
Distribution of Scores: Figure 1 shows the his-
togram of the V-reg tweets. The tweets are
grouped into bins of scores 0–0.05, 0.05–0.1, and
so on until 0.95–1. The colors for the bins corre-
spond to their ordinal classes as determined from
the manual annotation described in the next sub-
section. The histograms for the four emotions are
shown in Figure 5 in the Appendix.

3.4.3 Identifying Ordinal Classes
For each of the EI-reg emotions, the authors of
this paper independently examined the ordered list
of tweets to identify suitable boundaries that par-
titioned the 0–1 range into four ordinal classes:
no emotion, low emotion, moderate emotion, and
high emotion. Similarly the V-reg tweets were
examined and the 0–1 range was partitioned into
seven classes: very negative, moderately negative,
slightly negative, neutral or mixed, slightly posi-
tive, moderately positive, and very positive mental
state can be inferred.11

Annotation Aggregation: The authors discussed
their individual annotations to obtain consensus on
the class intervals. The V-oc and EI-oc datasets
were thus labeled.
Class Distribution: The legend of Figure 1 shows
the intervals of V-reg scores that make up the
seven V-oc classes. The intervals of EI-reg scores
that make up each of the four EI-oc classes are
shown in Figure 5 in the Appendix.

9Gold tweets were annotated more than four times.

11Valence is a bi-polar scale; hence, more classes.

3.4.4 Annotating Arabic and Spanish Tweets
The annotations for Arabic and Spanish tweets fol-
lowed the same process as the one described for
English above. We manually translated the En-
glish questionnaire into Arabic and Spanish.

On Figure Eight, we used similar settings as for
English. For Arabic, we set the country of annota-
tors to fourteen Arab countries available in Crowd-
flower as well as the United States of America.12

For Spanish, we set the country of annotators to
USA, Mexico, and Spain.

Annotation aggregation was done the same way
for Arabic and Spanish, as for English. Table 2
shows the distributions for different emotions in
the E-c annotations for Arabic and Spanish (in ad-
dition to English).

3.5 Training, Development, and Test Sets

Table 14 in Appendix summarizes key details
of the current set of annotations done for the
SemEval-2018 Affect in Tweets (AIT) Dataset.
AIT was partitioned into training, development,
and test sets for machine learning experiments as
described in Table 3. All of the English tweets
that came from Tweets-2016 were part of the train-
ing sets. All of the English tweets that came from
Tweets-2017 were split into development and test
sets.13 The Arabic and Spanish tweets are all from
2017 and were split into train, dev, and test sets.

12 Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco,
Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, UAE, Yemen.

13This split of Tweets-2017 was first done such that 20% of
the tweets formed the dev. set and 80% formed the test set—
independently for EI-reg, EI-oc, V-reg, V-oc, and E-c. Then
we moved some tweets from the test sets to the dev. sets such
that a tweet in any dev. set does not occur in any test set.

4 Agreement and Reliability of
Annotations

It is challenging to obtain consistent annotations
for affect due to a number of reasons, including:
the subtle ways in which people can express affect,
fuzzy boundaries of affect categories, and differ-
ences in human experience that impact how they
perceive emotion in text. In the subsections below
we analyze the AIT dataset to determine the extent
of agreement and the reliability of the annotations.

4.1 E-c Annotations

Table 4 shows the inter-rater agreement and Fleiss’
κ for the multi-label emotion annotations. The
inter-rater agreement (IRA) is calculated as the
percentage of times each pair of annotators agree.
For the sake of comparison, we also show the
scores obtained by randomly choosing whether a
particular emotion applies or not. Observe that the
scores obtained through the actual annotations are
markedly higher than the scores obtained by ran-
dom guessing.

4.2 EI-reg and V-reg Annotations

For real-valued score annotations, a commonly
used measure of quality is reproducibility of the
end result—if repeated independent manual anno-
tations from multiple respondents result in similar

intensity rankings (and scores), then one can be
confident that the scores capture the true emotion
intensities. To assess this reproducibility, we cal-
culate average split-half reliability (SHR), a com-
monly used approach to determine consistency
(Kuder and Richardson, 1937; Cronbach, 1946;
Mohammad and Bravo-Marquez, 2017). The in-
tuition behind SHR is as follows. All annotations
for an item (in our case, tuples) are randomly split
into two halves. Two sets of scores are produced
independently from the two halves. Then the cor-
relation between the two sets of scores is calcu-
lated. The process is repeated 100 times, and the
correlations are averaged. If the annotations are of
good quality, then the average correlation between
the two halves will be high.

Table 5 shows the split-half reliabilities for the
AIT data. Observe that correlations lie between
0.82 and 0.92, indicating a high degree of repro-
ducibility.14

14Past work has found the SHR for sentiment intensity an-
notations for words, with 6 to 8 annotations per tuple to be
0.95 to 0.98 (Mohammad, 2018b; Kiritchenko and Moham-
mad, 2016). In contrast, here SHR is calculated from whole
sentences, which is a more complex annotation task and thus
the SHR is expected to be lower than 0.95.

5 Evaluation for Automatic Predictions

5.1 For EI-reg, EI-oc, V-reg, and V-oc

The official competition metric for EI-reg, EI-oc,
V-reg, and V-oc was the Pearson Correlation
Coefficient with the Gold ratings/labels. For
EI-reg and EI-oc, the correlation scores across
all four emotions were averaged (macro-average)
to determine the bottom-line competition met-
ric. Apart from the official competition metric
described above, some additional metrics were
also calculated for each submission. These were
intended to provide a different perspective on
the results. The secondary metric used for the
regression tasks was:

• Pearson correlation for a subset of the test set
that includes only those tweets with intensity
score greater or equal to 0.5.

The secondary metrics used for the ordinal classi-
fication tasks were:

• Pearson correlation for a subset of the test set
that includes only those tweets with intensity
classes low X, moderate X, or high X (where
X is an emotion). We will refer to this set of
tweets as the some-emotion subset.

• Weighted quadratic kappa on the full test set.
• Weighted quadratic kappa on the some-emotion

subset of the test set.

5.2 For E-c

The official competition metric used for E-c was
multi-label accuracy (or Jaccard index). Since
this is a multi-label classification task, each tweet
can have one or more gold emotion labels, and
one or more predicted emotion labels. Multi-label
accuracy is defined as the size of the intersection
of the predicted and gold label sets divided by the
size of their union. This measure is calculated for
each tweet t, and then is averaged over all tweets
T in the dataset:

Accuracy =
1

|T |
∑

t∈T

Gt ∩ Pt
Gt ∪ Pt

where Gt is the set of the gold labels for tweet t, Pt
is the set of the predicted labels for tweet t, and T
is the set of tweets. Apart from the official compe-
tition metric (multi-label accuracy), we also calcu-
lated micro-averaged F-score and macro-averaged
F-score.15

Table 6: Number of teams in each task–language pair.

6 Systems

Seventy-five teams (about 200 team members)
participated in the shared task, submitting to one
or more of the five subtasks. The numbers
of teams submitting predictions for each task–
language pair are shown in Table 6. The English
tasks were the most popular (33 to 48 teams for
each task); however, the Arabic and Spanish tasks
also got a fair amount of participation (about 13
teams for each task). Emotion intensity regression
attracted the most teams.

Figure 2 shows how frequently various ma-
chine learning algorithms were used in the five
tasks. Observe that SVM/SVR, LSTMs and Bi-
LSTMs were some of the most widely used al-
gorithms. Understandably, regression algorithms
such as Linear Regression were more common in
the regression tasks than in the classification tasks.

Figure 3 shows how frequently various features
were used. Observe that word embeddings, af-
fect lexicon features, and word n-grams were some
of the most widely used features. Many teams
also used sentence embeddings and affect-specific
word embeddings. A number of teams also made
use of distant supervision corpora (usually tweets
with emoticons or hashtagged emotion words).
Several teams made use of the AIT2018 Dis-
tant Supervision Corpus—a corpus of about 100M
tweets containing emotion query words—that we
provided. A small number of teams used training
data from one task to supplement the training data
for another task. (See row ‘AIT-2018 train-dev (other
task)’.)

Figure 4 shows how frequently features from
various affect lexicons were used. Observe that
several of the NRC emotion and sentiment lexi-
cons as well as AFINN and Bing Liu Lexicon were
widely used (Mohammad and Turney, 2013; Mo-
hammad, 2018b; Kiritchenko et al., 2014; Nielsen,
2011; Hu and Liu, 2004). Several teams used
the AffectiveTweets package to obtain lexicon fea-
tures (Mohammad and Bravo-Marquez, 2017).16

6.1 Results and Discussion
Tables 7 through 11 show the results obtained by
the top three teams on EI-reg, EI-oc, V-reg, V-oc,
and E-c, respectively. The tables also show: (a) the
results obtained by the median rank team for each
task–language pair, (b) the results obtained by a
baseline SVM system using just word unigrams as
features, and (c) the results obtained by a system
that randomly guesses the prediction—the random
baseline.17 Observe that the top teams obtained
markedly higher results than the SVM unigrams
baselines.

Most of the top-performing teams relied on
both deep neural network representations of
tweets (sentence embeddings) as well as features
derived from existing sentiment and emotion
lexicons. Since many of the teams used similar
models when participating in different tasks, we
present further details of the systems grouped by
the language for which they submitted predictions.

17The results for each of the 75 participating teams are
shown on the task website and also in the supplementary ma-
terial file. (Not shown here due to space constraints.)

High-Ranking English Systems: The best per-
forming system for regression (EI-reg, V-reg) and
ordinal classification (EI-oc,V-oc) sub-tasks in
English was SeerNet. The team proposed a unified
architecture for regression and ordinal classifica-
tion based on the fusion of heterogeneous features
and the ensemble of multiple predictive models.
The following models or resources were used for
feature extraction:

• DeepMoji (Felbo et al., 2017): a neural network
for predicting emoji for tweets trained from a
very large distant supervision corpus. The last
two layers of the network were used as features.

• Skip thoughts: an unsupervised neural network
for encoding sentences (Kiros et al., 2015).

• Sentiment neurons (Radford et al., 2017): a
byte-level recurrent language model for learn-
ing sentence representations.

• Features derived from affective lexicons.

These feature vectors were used for training XG
Boost and Random Forest models (using both re-
gression and classification variants), which were
later stacked using ordinal logistic regression and
ridge regression models for the corresponding or-
dinal classification and regression tasks.

Other teams also relied on both deep neural net-
work representations of tweets and lexicon fea-
tures to learn a model with either a traditional
machine learning algorithm, such as SVM/SVR
(PlusEmo2Vec, TCS Research) and Logistic Re-
gression (PlusEmo2Vec), or a deep neural network
(NTUA-SLP, psyML). The sentence embeddings
were obtained by training a neural network on the
provided training data, a distant supervision cor-
pus (e.g., AIT2018 Distant Supervision Corpus
that has tweets with emotion-related query terms),
sentiment-labeled tweet corpora (e.g., Semeval-
2017 Task4A dataset on sentiment analysis in
Twitter), or by using pre-trained models.

and PARTNA used stemmer designed for handling
tweets. In addition, top systems applied addi-
tional pre-processing, such as dropping punctua-
tions, mentions, stop words, and hashtag symbols.

Many teams (e.g., AffecThor, EiTAKA and
EMA) utilized Arabic sentiment lexicons (Mo-
hammad et al., 2016; Badaro et al., 2014). Some
teams (e.g., EMA) used Arabic translations of the
NRC Emotion Lexicon (Mohammad and Turney,
2013). Pre-trained Arabic word embeddings
(AraVec) generated from a large set of tweets
were also used as additional input features by

11



EMA and UNCC. AffecThor collected 4.4 million
Arabic tweets to train their own word embeddings.
Traditional machine learning algorithms (Random
Forest, SVR and Ridge regression) used by EMA
obtained results rivaling those obtained by deep
learning approaches.

High-Ranking Spanish Systems: Convolutional
neural networks and recurrent neural networks
with gated units such as LSTM and GRU were em-
ployed by the winning Spanish teams (AffecThor,
Amobee, ELIRF-UPV, UG18). Word embeddings
trained from Spanish tweets, such as the ones pro-
vided by Rothe et al. (2016), were used as the basis
for training deep learning models. They were also
employed as features for more traditional learning
schemes such as SVMs (UG18). Spanish Affec-
tive Lexicons such as the Spanish Emotion Lexi-
con (SEL) (Sidorov et al., 2012) and ML-SentiCon
(Cruz et al., 2014) were also used to build the fea-
ture space (UWB, SINAI). Translation was used in
two different ways: 1) automatic translation of En-
glish affective lexicons into Spanish (SINAI), and
2): training set augmentation via automatic trans-
lation of English tweets (Amobee, UG18).

6.2 Summary

In the standard deep learning or representation
learning approach, data representations (tweets in
our case) are jointly trained for the task at hand via
neural networks with convolution or recurrent lay-
ers (LeCun et al., 2015). The claim is that this can
lead to more robust representations than relying on
manually-engineered features. In contrast, here,
most of the top-performing systems employed
manually-engineered representations for tweets.
These representations combine trained representa-
tions, models trained on distant supervision cor-
pora, and unsupervised word and sentence embed-
dings, with manually-engineered features, such as
features derived from affect lexicons. This shows
that despite being rather powerful, representation
learning can benefit from working in tandem with
task-specific features. For emotion intensity tasks,
lexicons such as the Affect Intensity Lexicon (Mo-
hammad, 2018b) that provide intensity scores are
particularly helpful. Similarly, tasks on valence,
arousal, and dominance can benefit from lexicons
such as ANEW (Bradley and Lang, 1999) and the
newly created NRC Valence-Arousal-Dominance
Lexicon (Mohammad, 2018a), which has entries
for about 20,000 English terms.

7 Examining Gender and Race Bias in
Sentiment Analysis Systems

Automatic systems can benefit society by pro-
moting equity, diversity, and fairness. Nonethe-
less, as machine learning systems become more
human-like in their predictions, they are inadver-
tently accentuating and perpetuating inappropriate
human biases. Examples include, loan eligibility
and crime recidivism prediction systems that nega-
tively assess people belonging to a certain pin/zip
code (which may disproportionately impact peo-
ple of a certain race) (Chouldechova, 2017), and
resumé sorting systems that believe that men are
more qualified to be programmers than women
(Bolukbasi et al., 2016). Similarly, sentiment and
emotion analysis systems can also perpetuate and
accentuate inappropriate human biases, e.g., sys-
tems that consider utterances from one race or
gender to be less positive simply because of their
race or gender, or customer support systems that
prioritize a call from an angry male user over a
call from the equally angry female user.

Discrimination-aware data mining focuses on
measuring discrimination in data (Zliobaite, 2015;
Pedreshi et al., 2008; Hajian and Domingo-Ferrer,
2013). In that spirit, we carried out an analysis
of the systems’ outputs for biases towards cer-
tain races and genders. In particular, we wanted
to test a hypothesis that a system should equally
rate the intensity of the emotion expressed by two
sentences that differ only in the gender/race of a
person mentioned. Note that here the term system

12



refers to the combination of a machine learning ar-
chitecture trained on a labeled dataset, and possi-
bly using additional language resources. The bias
can originate from any or several of these parts.

We used Equity Evaluation Corpus (EEC), a re-
cently created dataset of 8,640 English sentences
carefully chosen to tease out gender and race bi-
ases (Kiritchenko and Mohammad, 2018). We
used the EEC as a supplementary test set in the
EI-reg and V-reg English tasks. Specifically, we
compare emotion and sentiment intensity scores
that the systems predict on pairs of sentences in the
EEC that differ only in one word corresponding to
race or gender (e.g., ‘This man made me feel an-
gry’ vs. ‘This woman made me feel angry’). Com-
plete details on how the EEC was created, its con-
stituent sentences, and the analysis of automatic
systems for race and gender bias is available in
Kiritchenko and Mohammad (2018); we summa-
rize the key results below.

Despite the work we describe here and that pro-
posed by others, it should be noted that mecha-
nisms to detect bias can often be circumvented.
Nonetheless, as developers of sentiment analysis
systems, and NLP systems more broadly, we can-
not absolve ourselves of the ethical implications
of the systems we build. Thus, the Equity Evalu-
ation Corpus is not meant to be a catch-all for all
inappropriate biases, but rather just one of the sev-
eral ways by which we can examine the fairness
of sentiment analysis systems. The EEC corpus is
freely available so that both developers and users
can use it, and build on it.18

7.1 Methodology
The race and gender bias evaluation was carried
out on the EI-reg and V-reg predictions of 219
automatic systems (by 50 teams) on the EEC
sentences. The EEC sentences were created from
simple templates such as ‘<noun phrase> feels
devastated’, where <noun phrase> is replaced
with one of the following:

• common African American (AA) female and
male first names,
• common European American (EA) female and

male first names,
• noun phrases referring to females and males,

such as ‘my daughter’ and ‘my son’.

Notably, one can derive pairs of sentences from the
EEC such that they differ only in one phrase cor-

18http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/Biases-SA.html

responding to gender or race (e.g., ‘My daughter
feels devastated’ and ‘My son feels devastated’).
For the full lists of names, noun phrases, and sen-
tence templates see (Kiritchenko and Mohammad,
2018). In total, 1,584 pairs of scores were com-
pared for gender and 144 pairs of scores were
compared for race.

For each submission, we performed the paired
two sample t-test to determine whether the mean
difference between the two sets of scores (across
the two races and across the two genders) is signif-
icant. We set the significance level to 0.05. How-
ever, since we performed 438 assessments (219
submissions evaluated for biases in both gender
and race), we applied Bonferroni correction. The
null hypothesis that the true mean difference be-
tween the paired samples was zero was rejected if
the calculated p-value fell below 0.05/438.

7.2 Results
7.2.1 Gender Bias Results
Individual submission results were communicated
to the participants. Here, we present the summary
results across all the teams. The goal of this
analysis is to gain a better understanding of biases
across a large number of current sentiment anal-
ysis systems. Thus, we partition the submissions
into three groups according to the bias they show:
• F = M: submissions that showed no statistically

significant difference in intensity scores pre-
dicted for corresponding female and male noun
phrase sentences,
• F↑–M↓: submissions that consistently gave

higher scores for sentences with female noun
phrases than for corresponding sentences with
male noun phrases,
• F↓–M↑: submissions that consistently gave

lower scores for sentences with female noun
phrases than for corresponding sentences with
male noun phrases,

Table 12 shows the number of submissions in each
group. If all the systems are unbiased, then the
number of submissions for the group F = M would
be the maximum, and the number of submissions
in all other groups would be zero.

Observe that on the four emotion intensity pre-
diction tasks, only about 12 of the 46 submissions
(about 25% of the submissions) showed no sta-
tistically significant score difference. On the va-
lence prediction task, only 5 of the 36 submissions
(14% of the submissions) showed no statistically

significant score difference. Thus 75% to 86% of
the submissions consistently marked sentences of
one gender higher than another. When predict-
ing anger, joy, or valence, the number of systems
consistently giving higher scores to sentences with
female noun phrases (21–25) is markedly higher
than the number of systems giving higher scores
to sentences with male noun phrases (8–13). (Re-
call that higher valence means more positive sen-
timent.)

In contrast, on the fear task, most submissions
tended to assign higher scores to sentences with
male noun phrases (23) as compared to the num-
ber of systems giving higher scores to sentences
with female noun phrases (12). When predicting
sadness, the number of submissions that mostly
assigned higher scores to sentences with female
noun phrases (18) is close to the number of
submissions that mostly assigned higher scores to
sentences with male noun phrases (16).

7.2.2 Race Bias Results
We did a similar analysis as for gender, for race.
For each submission on each task, we calculated
the difference between the average predicted score
on the set of sentences with African American
(AA) names and the average predicted score on
the set of sentences with European American (EA)
names. Then, we aggregated the results over all
such sentence pairs in the EEC.

Table 13 shows the results. The table has the
same form and structure as the gender result ta-
ble. Observe that the number of submissions with
no statistically significant score difference for sen-
tences pertaining to the two races is about 5–11
(about 11% to 24%) for the four emotions and 3
(about 8%) for valence. These numbers are even
lower than what was found for gender.

The majority of the systems assigned higher
scores to sentences with African American names
on the tasks of anger, fear, and sadness intensity
prediction. On the joy and valence tasks, most
submissions tended to assign higher scores to sen-

tences with European American names.
We found the score differences across genders

and across races to be somewhat small (< 0.03 in
magnitude, which is 3% of the 0 to 1 score range).
However, what impact a consistent bias, even with
a magnitude < 3%, might have in downstream ap-
plications merits further investigation.

8 Summary

We organized the SemEval-2018 Task 1: Affect
in Tweets, which included five subtasks on infer-
ring the affectual state of a person from their tweet.
For each task, we provided training, development,
and test datasets for English, Arabic, and Span-
ish tweets. This involved creating a new Affect
in Tweets dataset of more than 22,000 tweets such
that subsets are annotated for a number of emotion
dimensions. For each emotion dimension, we an-
notated the data not just for coarse classes (such
as anger or no anger) but also for fine-grained
real-valued scores indicating the intensity of emo-
tion. We used Best–Worst Scaling to obtain fine-
grained real-valued intensity scores and showed
that the annotations are reliable (split-half reliabil-
ity scores > 0.8).

Seventy-five teams made 319 submissions to
the fifteen task–language pairs. Most of the top-
performing teams relied on both deep neural net-
work representations of tweets (sentence embed-
dings) as well as features derived from existing
sentiment and emotion lexicons. Apart from the
usual evaluations for the quality of predictions,
we also examined 219 EI-reg and V-reg English
submissions for bias towards particular races and
genders using the Equity Evaluation Corpus. We
found that a majority of the systems consistently
provided slightly higher scores for one race or gen-
der. All of the data is made freely available.19

Appendix

Table 14 shows the summary details of the
annotations done for the SemEval-2018 Affect in
Tweets dataset. Figure 5 shows the histograms
of the EI-reg tweets in the anger, joy, sadness,
and fear datasets. The tweets are grouped into
bins of scores 0–0.05, 0.05–0.1, and so on until
0.95–1. The colors for the bins correspond to
their ordinal classes: no emotion, low emotion,
moderate emotion, and high emotion. The ordinal
classes were determined from the EI-oc manual
annotations.

Supplementary Material: The supplementary
pdf associated with this paper includes longer ver-
sions of tables included in this paper. Tables 1
to 15 in the supplementary pdf show result tables
that include the scores of each of the 319 systems
participating in the tasks. Table 16 in the supple-
mentary pdf shows the annotator agreement for
each of the twelve classes, for each of the three
languages, in the Multi-label Emotion Classifica-
tion (E-c) Dataset. We observe that the Fleiss’ κ
scores are markedly higher for the frequently oc-
curring four basic emotions (joy, sadness, fear, and
anger), and lower for the less frequent emotions.
(Frequencies for the emotions are shown in Table
2.) Also, agreement is low for the neutral class.
This is not surprising because the boundary be-
tween neutral (or no emotion) and slight emotion
is fuzzy. This means that often at least one or two
annotators indicate that the person is feeling some
joy or some sadness, even if most others indicate
that the person is not feeling any emotion.
