Abstract

A data elicitation study on the type of demon-
stratives and determiners selected to denote
objects in English, Dutch and Portuguese di-
alogues is presented. Participants were given
a scenario and a scripted dialogue in which
a furniture seller identifies target objects to
a buyer. They were then asked to choose a
combination of a determiner or demonstrative
and a referring expression to be uttered by the
seller and told that the agent would point at
the targets while uttering the chosen linguistic
descriptions. The study was conducted with
native speakers and rendered a total of 920
demonstratives and determiners. It focused
on accessibility of the target referents and
distance between agents and target referents.
Results show that the three language groups
largely agree in their preferences and, in con-
trast to previous work, align with a nearby/far
away distinction.

1 Introduction

This paper investigates the use of indexical deter-
miners (i.e. determiners employed for direct refer-
ences to objects and that include a pointing gesture)
by Dutch, Portuguese and English speakers. A com-
parison of the use of Dutch and English demonstra-
tives in terms of the accessibility of the target by Pi-
wek and Cremers (1996) suggested that English and
Dutch speakers follow opposite strategies in their
use of indexical demonstratives. Dutch speakers use
proximal demonstratives for referents that are rela-
tively difficult to access (deze), while English speak-
ers use proximals (this, these) for referents that are

relatively easy to access. Piwek et al.(2008) present
an explanation for these differences in terms of the
use of pointing gestures (Clark and Bangerter, 2004;
Bangerter, 2004), suggesting that a pointing ges-
ture functions as a “labelling” of the target object
as being relatively accessible. Hence, where prox-
imals require a pointing gesture, distal demonstra-
tives (dat/that and die/those, which are more sim-
ilar to definite determiners) can also be used non-
indexically. This model corresponds to the ‘folk-
view’ of demonstratives that considers distals to in-
dicate objects far away from the speaker and prox-
imals to indicate objects near the speaker (Bühler,
1934; Clark, 1996).

Byron and Stoia (2005) present a motivation for
choosing either a proximal or a distal demonstra-
tive based on three dimensions (i.e. spatial, temporal
and task performance). Their analysis of a corpus of
collaborative dialogues between participants solving
a treasure hunt problem in a virtual space, shows
that, in English: (1) distals are used both for ob-
jects located close to and far away from the speaker,
whereas proximals are only used for objects located
near the speaker; (2) proximals are used for objects
that relate to the current time and to the future, while
distals are used for past events; and (3) distals are
less sensitive to the space and time dimension and
more sensitive to the task than proximals.

While we acknowledge that these are important
dimensions in the analysis of demonstratives, in the
present paper we restrict ourselves to an elicitation
study and analyse the use of indexical determiners in
terms of accessibility and distance, in line with the
model developed by Piwek et al. (1996; 2008).

In addition to the languages compared by Piwek
et al. (Dutch and English), we also analyse the use
of demonstratives in Portuguese. The dialogue con-
text designed for this study fits a discursive context
in which the distal/proximal distinction is appropri-
ate for Portuguese (Cavalcante, 2002), and thus en-
ables us to compare the use of demonstratives across
these three languages. Another difference between
this study and those conducted by Piwek et al. is
the data gathering method. While those authors re-
lied on corpora collected from free task-based dia-
logues between participants, we employed scripted
dialogues (André et al., 2000; Williams et al., 2007)
presented to individual participants who were ex-
plicitly asked to choose among demonstratives.

2 Production Study

The study presented below originated from an inves-
tigation into the perception of multimodal referring
expressions (REs) in a virtual world by Japanese an
English speakers (Van der Sluis and Luz, 2011b; Van
der Sluis et al., to appear). In this paper, the mate-
rials from a production study initially conducted for
Japanese to validate our Japanese translation of a di-
alogue written in English, have been translated and
further adapted to Dutch and Brazilian Portuguese.
We draw on the results of this study to analyse the
use of demonstratives in English, Dutch and Por-
tuguese. The REs considered in this study are em-
bedded in a scripted dialogue between two agents in
a furniture sales setting. The study focuses on ‘first-
mention’ REs which identify objects that have not
been talked about earlier in the discourse.

A dialogue script was written for two agents in a
furniture shop. The layout of the shop and the po-
sitions of the agents and furniture items is shown in
Figure 1. The shop contains 26 objects, comprising
distractors as well as target referents. The dialogue
consists of 19 utterances and features a conversa-
tion between a female agent purchasing furniture for
her office, and a male shop-owner describing some
furniture items. The furniture seller agent refers to
objects in the domain by uttering each scripted RE
combined with a pointing gesture directed to the tar-
get object. Validation showed that the dialogue was
acceptable to English speakers. Van der Sluis and
Luz (2011a) describe the setting in greater detail.

Figure 1: Screenshot of the application in which partic-
ipants were asked to choose their preferred REs. Utter-
ances by the Seller and Buyer are marked with “S:” and
“B:”, respectively. Options were presented as shown in
the DE-boxes marked (d) and (e), and RE-boxes marked
(4) and (5).

The dialogue was used as a template in which five
first-mention referring expressions (REs) could be
varied. The REs used to fill out these slots were
chosen to cover various aspects of REs as are cur-
rently being studied in NLG: (1) cardinality, the REs
targeted three singular objects and two larger sets
of items; (2) locative expressions, the REs included
three absolute locative expressions and two relative
locative expressions; and (3) the position of the ref-
erent, the targets were distributed in the domain of
conversation such that one referent was located near
to the stationary agents, two referents were located
far away from the agents, and two sets of referents
were located somewhere in between those two ex-
tremes. Figure 1 shows 14 furniture items that are
used for assessing multimodal GRE output: labelled
(1) to (5), as well as a number of distractors. It was
assumed that the agents would stay stationary and
point in the direction of the targets.

The text was translated into Dutch and Brazil-
ian Portuguese so as to adapt the dialogue to the
normative, communicative and inferential rules of
the respective cultures, but we attempted to keep
the REs as close to the English originals as possi-
ble. The translations and localisations for Dutch and

182



Portuguese followed a similar pattern as the process
for Japanese described in (Van der Sluis and Luz,
2011b). Validation of the translated dialogues was
conducted by three native speakers in the respective
languages and revisions were made accordingly.

Although the study was also conducted for
Japanese, we will restrict our discussion in this
paper to Dutch, English and Portuguese because
the Japanese system for demonstratives differs from
the ones discussed in this paper. It is a ternary,
person-oriented system (Anderson and Keenan,
1985, p.282-286), in contrast to distance-oriented
system such as the ones that seem to govern the
use of demonstratives in Portuguese, English and
Dutch. Although the Portuguese system also in-
corporates three classes of demonstratives, namely:
este(a)/s, isto, (proximal), esse(a), isso (medial) and
aquele(a)/s (distal), these often operate as a binary
system where the este and esse classes are used in-
terchangeably as proximals whereas aquele is used
as a distal (Cavalcante, 2002; Jungbluth, 2005).

Linguistic preferences were elicited through a
web-based application. After being introduced to
the scenario and task, participants were shown a
screen similar to Figure 1. A picture of the domain
was displayed at the top and kept visible through-
out the dialogue. The bottom part of the screen
contained the dialogue, through which the partici-
pants could scroll and select the REs and determin-
ers or demonstratives from a set of options, all of
which were simultaneously available to the partici-
pant while reading the sentence. The five REs were
each presented with two boxes as illustrated in Fig-
ure 1: the DE-box, for determiner or demonstrative
selection and the RE-box, for referring expressions.
After each RE-box, it was stated that the agent’s
utterance would be combined with a pointing ges-
ture in the direction of the target. The REs collected
with the study are analysed elsewhere (Van der Sluis
and Luz, 2011a) and will not be further considered
in this paper. The DE-box included three options
for Dutch, English and Portuguese: a definite deter-
miner and a proximal and distal demonstrative.

3 Hypotheses

Two hypotheses, denoted H1 and H2 and sum-
marised in Table 1, were tested for the five REs pro-

Table 1: Expected proximal and distal demonstratives for
English and Dutch for REs 1 to 5 with respect to ease of
access, (H1) and distance, (H2).

RE a H1-E/P H1-D d H2-EDP
RE1 easy prox dist near prox
RE2 difficult dist prox far dist
RE3 easy prox dist far dist
RE4 difficult dist prox near prox
RE5 easy prox dist far dist

duced in the dialogue with respect to the use index-
ical demonstratives. H1 is related to the accessibil-
ity of the target (Gundel et al., 1993) and H2 con-
cerns the physical distance between the speaker and
the target object. Compared to the targets of RE2
and RE4, objects identified by RE1, RE3 and RE5
are relatively easier to access because they are lo-
cated in the ‘focus area’ of the discourse (RE3 and
RE5) or set visibly apart from the other objects in
the domain (RE1). Hence, RE1, RE3 and RE5 call
for demonstratives that indicate easy access. Ac-
cording to Piwek and Cremers (1996), Dutch speak-
ers prefer proximal demonstratives for objects which
are relatively hard to access, while English speakers
apparently follow the opposite strategy. Portuguese
speakers appear to follow a strategy which is similar
to the latter (Cavalcante, 2002). In order to test these
claims we set the accessibility hypothesis, H1, so
that it predicts opposite strategies for Dutch, on the
one hand, and Portuguese and English on the other.

Hypothesis H2 relates to the distance between tar-
get object and speaker. It predicts that participants
will prefer distals over proximals to indicate objects
further away (i.e. a proximal for RE1 and RE4 and
distal demonstratives for the other REs). Since the
dialogue script includes an explicit pointing gesture
for all REs, we expected participants to choose ei-
ther a proximal or an (indexical) distal demonstra-
tive. We had no hypotheses about the use of definite
determiners and exclude them from further analysis.

51 native Dutch speakers (female: 55% female, 45%
male; age groups: 21% between 20 and 30, 33% be-
tween 31 and 40, and 26% between 41 and 50 and
20% over 50 years old; occupations: 4% students,
14% academics and 82% other).

4.1 Demonstratives

Figure 2 presents the percentages of definite de-
terminers, proximal and distal demonstratives se-
lected per RE per language. Results show that native
speakers of Portuguese, Dutch and English roughly
agree in their choices. However, for RE3 we found
some disagreement. The majorities of the English
and Dutch participants, did not select a demonstra-
tive, but selected a definite determiner for RE3 (i.e.
‘the small desk next to it’). In contrast, the Por-
tuguese speakers preferred a distal demonstrative.

Table 2 shows the frequencies of the demonstra-
tives selected, determiners excluded. Again, Por-
tuguese, Dutch and English speakers mostly agree
in their choices. The majorities chose a proximal
demonstrative for RE1 (i.e. ‘this red chair’), a distal
demonstrative for RE2 (i.e. ‘that large desk’), a dis-
tal for RE3 (i.e. ‘that small desk next to it’), a prox-
imal demonstrative for RE4 (i.e. ‘these red chairs’)
and a distal demonstrative for RE5 (i.e. ‘those green
chairs next to the red ones’).

We computed χ2 statistics to assess whether the
data borne out the differences hypothesised (Table 1)
and if those differences were statistically significant
(i.e. whether the null hypotheses that no difference

exists could be confidently rejected). The results of
these tests are also summarised in Table 2.

tal and Proximal demonstratives per REferring expres-
sions for the Languages English, Dutch and Brazilian
Portuguese, where differences are indicated with * =
p < .05 and ** = p < 0.01. Where the null hypothe-
sis is rejected, a + sign indicates a difference that agrees
with the alternative hypothesis (H1, H2), and a − sign
indicates a difference that disagrees with the alternative
hypothesis.

English participants agreed with our Access hy-
pothesis and Distance hypothesis for RE2 (χ2[1] =
22.35, p < .01), which predict a distal demonstra-
tive. English participants agreed with the Distance
hypotheses for RE4 (χ2[1] = 11.25, p < .01) and
RE5 (χ2[1] = 7.56, p < .01) and rejected the Ac-
cess hypotheses for these REs (i.e. respectively a

184



proximal and a distal demonstrative were preferred
for RE4 and RE5). Dutch participants chose distal
demonstratives for RE2, RE3 and RE5, respectively
(χ2[1] = 17.29, p < .01), (χ2[1] = 7.12, p < .00)
and (χ2[1] = 16.94, p < .01), thereby agreeing with
the Distance and also with the Access hypothesis for
RE3 and RE5. However, for RE2 the Dutch partic-
ipants disagreed with the Access hypothesis. Por-
tuguese speakers agreed with the Access hypothe-
sis and the Distance hypothesis for RE1 (χ2[1] =
4.333, p < .05) and RE2 (χ2[1] = 25.97, p <
.01) preferring respectively a proximal and a distal
demonstrative. They also agreed with the Distance
hypothesis for RE3 (χ2[1] = 11.57, p < .01) and
RE4 (χ2[1] = 10.94, p < .01), preferring respec-
tively a distal and proximal demonstrative, and thus
rejected the Access hypothesis.

4.2 Access versus Distance
Table 3 summarises the participants’ choices in
terms of Access (H1) and Distance (H2) for the three
language groups in the cases where the hypotheses
differed. For English participants such differences
were found for RE4 (χ2[1] = 11.25, p < .01) and
RE5 (χ2[1] = 7.56, p < .01) indicating that their
selections matched the Distance hypothesis better
than the Access hypothesis. The Dutch partici-
pants also matched the Distance hypothesis better
but only for RE2 (χ2[1] = 17.29, p < .01). Fi-
nally the demonstratives selected by the Portuguese
participants matched the Distance hypothesis for
RE3 (χ2[1] = 11.57, p < .01) and RE4 (χ2[1] =
10.94, p < .01) better than the Access hypothesis.

potheses H1 (accessibility) and H2 (distance) for English,

between H1 and H2 are denoted with ‘**’ (p < .01).

5 Discussion and Conclusion

The Distance Hypothesis (H2) appears to be a better
fit to the preferences of native speakers of the three
languages than the Accessibility Hypothesis (H1).
It agrees with the majority of choices for RE1, RE2,
RE4 and RE5 in all language groups. Expression
RE3, however, proved to be something of an excep-
tion, specially for Dutch and English, in that partic-
ipants of those languages preferred to use a definite
determiner in this RE rather than a distal or prox-
imal demonstrative. It seems that in this case the
increased accessibility of object (3), caused by the
previous reference to ‘the desk next to it’, was trans-
ferred to the definite determiner rather than the distal
demonstrative for Dutch and the proximal demon-
strative for English, as predicted by H1.

In contrast to previous work, the data collected
in our study show that the majorities of the three
languages agree in their choices of demonstratives.
This may be explained by the fact that pointing ges-
tures were an explicit part of the REs that we tested,
and therefore could be evidence for the post-hoc
analysis presented by (Piwek et al., 2008), aligning
with the folk view of a nearby/far away distinction.

Finally, this study introduced some methodologi-
cal innovations. Unlike studies where data are col-
lected from naturalistic conversations, we explicitly
asked participants to make a judgement as to which
demonstrative to use. This was done in a context
which, although arguably still open to subjective
interpretation, is much more tightly controlled and
therefore better suited to cross-linguistic compari-
son. However, it could be argued that better control
comes at the cost of naturalness. By asking the par-
ticipants to respond from a third person’s perspective
and imagine the effects of communicative acts (in-
cluding gestures) the study might have favoured re-
flective answers over spontaneous production. Such
trade-offs seem to be characteristic of this sort of
study, and getting them right is one of the many chal-
lenges in language generation research.
