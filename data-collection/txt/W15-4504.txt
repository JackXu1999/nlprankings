Abstract 
One critical function that news 

narratives perform is orienting action: 

Providing a selective, coherent account 

of events, they suggest what needs to be 

done, coordinating and motivating public 

agendas. The importance of news 

narratives’ agendas for action has been 

particularly salient in the coverage of 

conflict1 (Wolfsfeld 1997, Robinson et 

al. 2010): Conflict spurns heated debates 

wherein advocated courses of action 

collide, while audiences rely heavily on 

various media to comprehend ongoing 

events. Keeping track of the cacophony 

of agendas advanced in print and online 

newspapers and magazines, social media, 

and other public discourse confronts 

news readers, journalists, decision 

makers, and scholars alike with a major 

challenge. Computer assisted analyses 

have the potential to help comprehending 

conflict news, distilling agendas for 

action and possibly predicting the 

mobilization of consensus and collective 

action (Snow and Benford 1988). This 

paper presents the INFOCORE 

consortium’s ongoing efforts at 

automatically capturing agendas in 

conflict discourse, employing NLP 

technology and statistical analysis. We 

demonstrate the utility and potential of 

our approach using coverage of the 

Syrian chemical weapons crisis in 2013.

Schwinghammer (2000): a violent mass conflict is 

settled by two or more armed forces that perform 

violence in not a sporadic or spontaneous way. 

 

1 Introduction  

Frame analysis is long established as one 

mainstream approach to the analysis of news 

narratives in communications and links to 

numerous traditions also in the humanities 

(Tewksbury and Scheufele 2009, Lakoff 2004, 

Souders and Dillard 2014). Focusing on the 

variety of narratives constructed to interpret the 

same news reality, its power lies in highlighting 

how different narratives influence audiences’ 

beliefs, attitudes and actions. Specifically, 

Entman’s (1993) seminal definition of frames 

posits the recommendation of specific treatments 

as one of four frames’ primary functions. 

However, while numerous scientists (Snow and 

Benford 1988, Gamson 1995, Giugni 2006, 

Sanfilippo et al. 2008) have underscored frames’ 

motivational and mobilizing functions, there has 

been remarkably little research on how frames 

advance specific agendas. Despite ample 

evidence documenting the public agenda setting 

power of the news (McCombs 2005), its direct 

antecedent – the agendas for action embedded in 

the news narrative – have been operationalized 

crudely as broad topics, or captured laboriously 

in highly case-bound studies. Computational 

linguistics have approached the frame analysis 

of the news texts by identifying the sentiment of 

articles (cf. Godbole, Srinivasaiah, and Skiena 

2007, Scholz and Conrad 2013), and capturing 

places, people and events as frame elements 

using named entity recognition technique 

(Lloyd, Kechagias, and Skiena 2005, Best et al. 

2006). Frames’ mobilizing component, however, 

has thus far eluded systematic study in 

humanities, social sciences and computational 

linguistics. In this paper, we present the 

21



INFOCORE1 consortium’s computer-assisted 

strategy for detecting and classifying agendas 

for action, which overcomes this limitation. 

 

2 INFOCORE’s approach to computing 

news storylines 

In the news, conflict is described on several 

levels of abstraction. On the lowest level, the 

actors, objectives, aims and other relevant ideas 

in the given conflict are positioned, and specific 

evidential claims about these are presented, 

informing readers what is reportedly the case. At 

the next level, interpretative frames 

contextualize these claims, suggesting how the 

reported facts are to be interpreted. Combined 

into complex narratives to meaningfully link 

sequences of events, these frames finally 

advance specific agendas for action required to 

bring the conflict narrative to closure (Baden 

2014): Integrating the available information to 

make sense of the situation, frames’ 

motivational function translates the specific 

understanding of the news narrative into 

concrete, applicable agendas. Extracting these 

agendas, in this paper, we thus focus on news 

storylines’ ability to direct action, constituting 

one primary societal effect of the news.  

 
2.2 Agendas for action 

From a semantic point of view, agendas for 

action consist of three components: First, as 

amply documented by agenda setting research, 

the issue to be acted upon has to be identified. 

Second, there needs to be a specific expression 

of a need to act. Third, the mandated course of 

action needs to be specified. While the range of 

relevant issues is principally unbounded and 

must be determined for each studied context, 

research in both linguistics and communication 

has emphasized a finite list of common ways for 

expressing the need to act: 

 Commissive, directive and partially 
expressive speech acts as defined by Searle 

(1976), with an enhanced list of speech act verbs 

(Wierzbicka 1987); 

 Imperative sentences: “Fight them!”; 

                                                           
1 (In)forming conflict prevention, response, and 

resolution: The role of media in violent conflict, 

www.infocore.eu 

 Sentences containing modal verbs 
obliging someone to do something: “They must 

obey”; 

 Sentences expressing the speaker’s 
dissatisfaction: “[Sb.] condemned such a 

motion” or “We will not stand this aggression”; 

 General expressions that something 
cannot stand: “Something should be done” 

 Rhetorical questions: “Can we accept 
such a treatment?”; 

 Propositions about desirable, but absent 
states: “Peace is the only answer”. 

The course of action, again, can include 

virtually any kind of activities and inactivities. It 

is therefore useful to classify different kinds of 

actions more broadly. Owing to the focus on 

conflict-related news, INFOCORE’s analysis 

aims to distinguish the following agenda types: 

 peaceful solution/de-escalation – agendas 
for peace, a ceasefire, to stop fighting, etc.: 

“People need to understand that violence is not 

an acceptable way to solve disputes.” 

 violent solution/escalation – the opposite of 
the above category includes calls for military 

action, violence, escalation, etc.: “…Fatah and 

Hamas, which Israel deems a terrorist 

organizations calling for its destruction” 

 involvement/dialogue/support – including 
calls for cooperation, negotiations as well as all 

sorts of help and support: “Eradication of 

poverty should be the main priority of 

humanitarian action.” 

 punishment/sanctions/toughness – the 
opposite of the previous category, calling for a 

tough stance and (non-violent) coercion: “UN 

official applauds sentencing of militia leader for 

war crimes.” 

 general/rhetorical questions – agendas that 
do not call for something specific, but express 

dissatisfaction with the status quo that should be 

changed: “Now is the time to take action.” 

 multiclass – complex treatments wherein 
multiple clauses express different agenda: “The 

international community must break that habit, 

accept the Palestinian membership application, 

guarantee Palestinians a war crimes case, 

prioritize peace and end Israel's impunity - or 

see international law perverted further in ways 

that is certain to harm the entire world.” 

 negative – calls for not doing something: 
“We must not lower our guard, at any time, 

22



Prime Minister Manuel Valls told Parliament, 

adding that "serious and very high risks 

remain”. Such agendas may be also expressed 

without using negators: “The Department of 

State warns U.S. citizens of the risks of travel to 

eastern Ukraine”. Sentences criticizing others 

for doing something also belong here: “We 

condemn these barbaric crimes.” 

 other – sentences that contain an agenda for 
action but are semantically ambiguous are 

classified here: “The militants who massacred 

schoolchildren, beheaded soldiers and attacked 

defense installations have surely committed war 

crimes and must be dealt with as such.” 

As expressing agendas for action 

necessarily takes propositional form, the task 

may be formulated as sentence classification. 

We apply a two-step classification procedure: 

We identify those sentences expressing an 

agenda for action in the first step, and classify 

the expressed agenda by type in a second step. 

For the present paper, we apply a simplified 

classification of agenda types: peaceful and 

dialogic agendas are merged into “cooperative” 

treatments, while violent and punitive agendas 

constitute “restrictive” treatments, and the rest 

fall under “other”. 

 

3 Related work 

Our approach builds upon recent advances 

in automated content analysis and extraction of 

frames, as well as in sentence classification. In 

communication research, automated approaches 

to frame analysis mostly rely on a detection of 

co-occurrence patterns: Following Entman’s 

(1993) frame definition, Matthes and Kohring 

(2008) identify frame elements manually and 

collate frames based on the systematic joint 

appearance of these elements (see also Wettstein 

2014, Hughes, Lancaster, and Spicer 2011). 

Kutter and Kantner (2011) rely on an 

operationalization of semantic fields (Gliozzo 

and Strapparava 2009) to perform a semi-

automated, corpus-based analysis of semantic 

co-occurrences. Baden (2010) measures frames 

as “areas of heightened density in a semantic 

network” (page 90) of systematic, dyadic 

concept co-occurrences. Sanfilippo et al. (2008) 

depart from an extended frame definition and 

extract frame components (Promoter, Intention, 

Target, Issue, etc.) using different NLP 

techniques (grammar parsing, NER, co-

reference and temporal resolution). In order to 

measure Intention, they also capture intent 

verbs, which are directly related to our approach 

in the current paper.  

Relevant work on sentence classification 

has focused on assessing different classification 

algorithms and fine-tuning their parameters and 

features (Kim 2014, Khoo, Marom, and Albrecht 

2006, Revathi et al. 2012), for application to 

specific tasks and domains (Cohen, Carvalho, 

and Mitchell 2004, Qadir and Riloff 2011, Kim, 

Martinez, and Cavedon 2011, McKnight and 

Srinivasan 2003). Most applicable here are those 

studies classifying text segments as speech acts: 

Cohen, Carvalho, and Mitchell (2004) categorize 

whole email messages as requests, proposals, 

amends, commitments, deliveries, and other 

speech acts. Using TFIDF-weighted bag of 

words, bigrams, and POS-tags, they compare 

four classifiers – Voted Perceptron, AdaBoost, 

SVM, Decision Tree – the latter two 

outperforming the rest.  

Qadir and Riloff (2011) finally move the 

categorization task to sentence level, assigning 

speech act labels as defined by Searle (1976) to 

message board posts. Their approach also 

reflects grammatical structure of sentences in 

features (e.g., capturing imperative sentences 

and disambiguating them from interrogative 

ones), which were used to train a SVM 

classifier. While we are not interested here in 

representatives or expressives that do not 

advance specific agendas, their classification 

strategy is closely related to ours; however, we 

also included instances that merely imply an 

agenda for action, but fall short of forming 

classic directives. To our knowledge, ours 

presents the first study to comprehensively distil 

agendas, including also speech-act-like 

structures, in conflict news coverage to date. 

 

4 Methodology 

4.1 Corpus 

To train the classifier, we manually 

annotated a 1723-sentence corpus, labeling each 

sentence as “cooperative treatment” (287 items), 

“restrictive treatment” (204 items), “other” (249 

items) or “none” (983 items). For the first round 

23



of classification the former three categories are 

combined. For the second round, the “none” 

category was excluded from the pool of 

sentences. The LexisNexis1 database was used 

for crafting the corpus, retrieving all English 

language sources including the keywords 

“conflict”, “war” or “violence” from 1 January 

to 1 March 2015. Articles were split into 

sentences and labeled accordingly. 

 
4.2 Features 

For both rounds of classification, n-gram 

features with n between 1 and 3 were used.  For 

the second round the words were stemmed, as it 

improved the performance in the second round 

but not in the first: To classify a sentence as 

containing an agenda, not only lexical, but also 

grammatical information is important, which is 

contained in endings and suffixes. Also stop-

words removal – a classical pre-processing step 

in NLP – was not performed as it reduces 

performance: stop-word lists usually include 

prepositions, particles, articles and auxiliary 

words which contain important grammatical 

information needed for such classification 

(Khoo, Marom, and Albrecht 2006). By contrast, 

recognizing the agenda type is a purely semantic 

classification task, for which stems are 

sufficient. Features extraction and model 

training was carried out using the Weka toolkit 

for data mining (Hall et al. 2009). 

 
4.3 Classifiers 

We compared the results of three 

classification algorithms – decision tree (J48), 

Naïve Bayes Multinomial (NBM) and support 

vector machine (SVM) - to find out which one 

performs best. Cross validation with 5 and 3 

folds was used for the first and the second 

rounds respectively. For the first round, SVM 

outperformed the rest, classifying 74% of 

instances correctly (see Table 1). 

  

 Precision Recall F1 

J48 0.70 0.70 0.70 

NBM 0.73 0.72 0.73 

SVM 0.74 0.74 0.72

Table 1: Weighted average Precision, 

Recall and F-measure scores for decision tree, 

Naïve Bayes Multinomial and support vector 

machine for the classification of agendas vs. 

non-agendas. 

 

For the second round, SVM and NBM 

performed equally well: 52% of instances were 

classified correctly (see Table 2). Poor 

classification results may be explained by little 

amount of training data and high semantic 

ambiguity of the concept. 

 

 Precision Recall F1 

J48 0.48 0.48 0.48 

NBM 0.52 0.52 0.52 

SVM 0.52 0.52 0.52 

Table 2: Weighted average Precision, 

Recall and F-measure scores for decision tree, 

Naïve Bayes Multinomial and support vector 

machine for the classification of agendas as 

cooperative, restrictive and other. 

 

Generally, our results support the findings 

of Khoo, Marom and Albrecht (2006) that SVM 

is the most powerful algorithm for sentence level 

classification.  

 

5 Computing the storyline of news 

coverage of Syrian chemical weapons 

crises 

5.1 The Story 

Extracting agendas for action from the 

news coverage on violent conflict helps tracking 

the dynamics of a conflict, identifying and 

possibly predicting phases of escalation and de-

escalation: Dominantly expressed agendas not 

only prepare news audiences for impending 

policy moves and collective action in conflict, 

they also reflect preeminent interpretations of 

current conflict as accessible to or beyond 

peaceful resolution. Conflict events extend 

ongoing news narratives, update conflict 

perceptions, and shift conflict policy agendas. 

The Syrian chemical weapons (CW) crisis 2013 

progressed from initial rumors, uncertainty and 

global hesitation in March, through rapid 

escalation following the large scale CW attacks 

in Ghouta in August, culminating in projected 

24



imminent US air strikes, to international 

disengagement following Syria’s surrender of its 

CW arsenals to UN control in October, and their 

destruction by the OPCW. Widely diverse 

agendas were discussed at all times, but only 

few became dominant temporarily (for more in 

depth analysis of news coverage of the crises see 

Baden and Stalpouskaya 2015). 

 
5.2 Material 

For our analysis, we used news coverage of 

the Syrian CW crisis in the British Guardian and 

the American New York Times (NYT). Both 

media act as papers of record for the respective 

countries, key global players in the crisis, 

closely observing their foreign policy debates. 

The coverage was retrieved from the respective 

news archives based on a search for references 

to Syria (e.g. “Syria”, “Damascus”) and 

chemical weapons (e.g. “chemical weapon”, 

“sarin”, “WMD”). The dataset comprised 584 

articles from the Guardian and 609 from NYT. 

Articles were grouped by month, split into 

sentences, and each sentence classified based on 

the two-step procedure and pre-trained SVM 

classifier described above. 

 

5.3 Results  

The analysis reveals a steady presence of 

agendas, which are detected in one third of all 

sentences throughout the entire time range 

(Table 3). Figure 1 shows that there are initially 

fewer agendas expressed in the UK, whose role 

in the conflict crystallizes only once premier 

Cameron calls for active intervention, building 

steadily as the debate picks up speed; however, 

when the UK’s parliament votes against 

intervention, the need to discuss an active 

British role ceases, the administrative attention 

wanders on, and the share of agendas expressed 

in the Guardian wanes. By contrast, the NYT 

considers Syria a case for possible US 

intervention from the outset (reflecting Obama’s 

“red line”1), and discusses policy options long

before the administration openly considers 

military action. The role of agendas in the 

coverage is high at all times. Interestingly, the 

share remains stable despite major changes in 

the amount of attention to the crisis, culminating 

in September as the Ghouta attacks initiate a 

hectic search for viable action (less so in the 

UK, where military action is now off the table). 

Looking at the kinds of agendas 

distinguished in Figure 2, political, cooperative 

efforts dominate at all times over military 

options (the spike of restrictive agendas in the 

Guardian’s coverage in July overrepresents few 

calls for arming rebels and cited militants during 

a month of very low coverage). In the US, 

support for military action builds slowly but 

steadily, while the White House’s justification of 

its hesitant stance results in many calls for 

forging international agreement and alliances on 

Syria. Culminating in July, the US adopt a more 

unilateral stance after Ghouta, when cooperative 

agendas drop and calls for independent 

investigation (other) dominate. Following the 

US’ adoption of Russia’s plan to put Syria’s CW 

under UN control, also restrictive agendas drop, 

while monitoring compliance becomes the 

primary concern. In the Guardian, many calls for 

military action exist at the outset, but are quickly 

diffused into a more general punitive agenda 

(“stopping Assad”, “not standing by idly”, 

classified as “other”) as rumors solidify. While 

the UK waits for the US to take the lead, 

agreement that someone urgently needs to find 

some solution builds, but Cameron’s military 

agenda remains at a share of one fifth as only 

one of many such proposals. In both papers, the 

resolve to escalate the crisis is perceptibly 

limited: Even after the Ghouta attacks, when 

patience with global diplomacy finally fails and 

the US are at the verge of ordering missile 

strikes, cooperative agendas remain more salient 

than restrictive ones. And while the tone is 

notably more hostile toward Assad in the 

Guardian, the vagueness of agendas correctly 

indicates that no specific action is imminent.

6 Limitations and future work 

The present study remains work in progress 

in important ways. First, the data presented uses 

a simplified classification of agendas and does 

not yet integrate with the analysis of frames and 

evidential claims underway within the 

INFOCORE project. Second, we do not yet 

capture certain implicit agendas for action, 

whose illocutionary force indirectly constitutes a 

perlocutionary act (Austin 1962) e.g., “we see 

these violations with grave concern”. Such 

agendas rely on conventional values to unfold 

their directive qualities, and therefore require 

different operational strategies. Third, we only 

detect agendas for action contained within one 

sentence, yet, one sentence may contain several 

agendas, and agendas span multiple sentences. 

The former case is classified as “multiclass” in 

our fine classification, but allows further 

differentiation. To detect agendas spanning 

sentences, tools are needed that tie together 

sentences based on anaphora resolution, 

conjunctions such as “also”, “as well”, or 

identity chains of synonymous predicates. 

Furthermore, with the current set-up, fine 

classification performs poorly: the best accuracy 

achieved was 36% using NBM. More training 

data is needed, but also utilizing lexical 

resources (e.g., WordNet) should boost precision 

and recall. Similarly, grammatical ambiguity is 

responsible for some misclassification of 

agendas vs. non-agendas (e.g., “they request” vs. 

“request is being processed”) and requires 

resolution using additional NLP resources. 

Finally, to get the full picture of the news 

storyline, agendas for action need to be linked to 

the speaker advancing and others commenting 

upon that agenda. While strategies exist for most 

of the named limitations, bringing them to bear 

on our analysis remains a task for future work. 

 

7 Conclusion 

Our goal was to highlight the role of 

“agendas for action” as one key, socially 

relevant conclusion arising from competing 

news storylines, and propose a strategy for 

detecting these algorithmically in a text corpus. 

Related, but not identical to directive speech 

acts, the approach pursued by the INFOCORE 

consortium combines grammatical and semantic 

resources to classify relevant statements in the 

news. Our focus on agendas bridges a gap in the 

study of news content and discourse, which 

often postulates the action coordinating and 

directing role of new narratives, but has focused 

much more on the descriptive semantic qualities 

of news frames than on their mobilizing 

capacities. Agendas for action present the 

critical link between discursive representations 

and social action, but have to date mostly evaded 

scholarly attention. Identifying common ways of 

suggesting specific courses of action, we applied 

machine learning technique to extract sentences 

expressing agendas for action. Currently 

standard n-rams with n between 1 and 3 were 

used as features. In a number of trials, we found 

large margin classifiers to perform best, and 

applied the trained model to analyze news 

coverage of Syrian CW crisis in 2013. Sentences 

were classified in two steps, first discriminating 

agendas for action from statements without 

directive force, and qualifying the nature of the 

advocated treatment in the second step. The 

procedure demonstrates the potential of 

combining grammatical and semantic 

information for sentence classification, and 

opens up avenues for further research. We found 

consistently high percentages of agendas 

expressed in the news, advocating different 

kinds of action at different moments during the 

crisis. The extracted agendas are informative 

about the quality of news debates about the 

conflict, and can be tied to actual policies and 

developments within the crisis. However, further 

work is needed to increase differentiation, 

accuracy, and critically, to integrate the detected 

agendas into the context of the news storyline.
