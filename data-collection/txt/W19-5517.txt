Abstract 

We demo a chatbot in a personal finance domain 
that delivers content in the form of virtual 
dialogues automatically produced from plain texts 
extracted and selected from documents. Given an 
initial query, this chatbot finds documents, extracts 
topics from them, organizes these topics in clusters 
according to conflicting viewpoints, receives from 
the user clarification on which cluster is most 
relevant to her opinion, and provides the content 
for this cluster. This content is provided in the form 
of a virtual dialogue where the answers are derived 
from the found and selected documents and its split 
results, and questions are automatically generated 
for these answers.  

1 A Virtual Dialogue 

Presentation of knowledge in dialogue format is a popular 
way to communicate information effectively. Usability 
studies have shown that for information acquirers, dialogues 
often communicate information more effectively and 
persuade stronger than monologue most of the times [Cox et 
al., 1999].  

A virtual dialogue is defined as a multi-turn dialogue, 
possibly with adversarial argumentation, between imaginary 
agents obtained as a result of content transformation [Piwek 
et al., 2007]. 

Dialogue construction from the text is based on the 
Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST, [Mann and Thompson., 
1988]). To obtain a sequence of answers from a text, we 
automatically split it into elementary discourse units 
(EDUs) and then form a discourse tree where these units are 
labels for the leaves of this tree. Satellite EDUs are then 
selected as answers to the questions that are derived from 
these EDUs by means of generalization. Nucleus EDUs will 
follow the satellite EDUs in dialogue answers to maintain 
its cohesiveness [Barzilay and Lapata, 2008; Galitsky et al., 
2015]. Discourse tree is constructed with the RST-parser 
[Surdeanu et al., 2015]. 

An example of converting a text into a virtual dialogue is 
shown in the form of a discourse tree below. Answers are 
obtained by splitting text into EDUs, and questions are 
inserted in text before satellite EDUs. Generated questions 
are shown in angle brackets and bolded.  

For the text “Lower risk investments, such as government 
bonds, offer lower but more stable returns and less chance 
of losing the money you invest. But, lower returns may mean 
that inflation reduces the value of your investments” we 
have the following discourse tree with inserted questions: 

elaboration (LeftToRight) 

contrast (RightToLeft) 

same-unit 

TEXT: Lower risk investments such as 

government bonds 

elaboration (LeftToRight) 

<what kind of return it can give?> 

TEXT: offer lower but more stable returns, less 

chance 

elaboration (LeftToRight) 

TEXT: of losing the money 

TEXT: you invest . 

attribution (RightToLeft) 

TEXT: But, lower returns may mean 

<What can inflation do with my investment?> 

TEXT: that inflation reduces the value of 

investments. 

2 A Session with a Virtual Dialogue Chatbot 

We present an exploratory session that combines 

information delivery in the form of traditional textual 

answers (conventional dialogue) and in a form of a virtual 

dialogue. The dialogue starts from the user question, ‘pros 

and cons of investment in annuity’ (Fig. 1). 

Bot>ask a new question 

User> pros and cons of investment in annuity 

Bot> exploring https://www.bankrate.com/retirement/5-

pros-andcons-of-investing-in-annuities/ 

I believe these are the main topics of your query: is that 

what you meant? Please select 

[1] 'establish your own salary from an annuity'

[2] 'an insurance or investment company in exchange'

[3] 'predictable retirement income'

User> predictable retirement income 

Bot> If you are thinking of investing for retirement years,

there are many options for you to choose from… 

Are you OK with this answer? yes/more/no/specify 

[different topic] // virtual dialogue 

User > virtual dialogue 

Bot> This is what other people chat about your topic: 

Bot>An advantage of an annuity is the reliable income 

that it produces, according to annuity-pros-cons.com . 

User>What will my own salary be? 

Bot>The annuity establishes a known schedule for when 

you will receive your money. This allows you to establish 

your own salary from an annuity 

User>What if I find a better investment? 

Bot> While an annuity pays you a known amount for a 

specific amount of time, it cannot be changed. You cannot 

pull your money out of the annuity.  

User> What category of people has the highest financial 

anxiety? 

Bot>This has been answered to users with similar questions: 

Bot> Having a predictable retirement income can help 

you feel happier 

User>Where is the strongest financial anxiety? 

Bot> Conversely, the researchers discovered that retirees 

who must withdraw money from investments to pay for 

retirement expenses had the highest financial anxiety. 

Figure 1: Chatbot session with conventional and virtual 

dialogue. 
The chatbot consults the sources and extracts the content 

from each page (or document) expected to be relevant for 
the query. The chatbot forms the list of topics extracted 
from these search results so that the user might select the 
one of her interest. The user selects his topic of interest and 
requests a specific answer. Once the answer is read, there 
are multiple options: 

 accept the answer and conclude the session;

 navigate to the next/specific answer from the chatbot

list;

 attempt to reformulate the query;

 reduce search to a specified web domain;

 proceed to more search results in the form of a virtual

dialogue.

The user selects the last option and the chatbot builds a 
virtual dialogue. It is a conversation between imaginary 
people where the conversation topic is retained, matching 
the original query. Virtual dialogues are shown in frames. 

Chatbot demo videos (please, check 10 min video) and 
instructions on how to use it are available at our GitHub in 
the “What is new?” section. 

3 Evaluation of Effectiveness 

Evaluating the effectiveness of information delivery via 
virtual dialogues, we compare the conventional chatbot 
sessions where users were given plain-text answers, and the 
ones where users were given a content via virtual dialogues.

conventional and virtual dialogues

We assess dialogues with respect to following usability 

properties.  

The speed of arriving to a decision to commit a 

transaction such as purchase or product selection. A user is 

expected to accumulate sufficient information, and this 

information should be convincing enough for making such 

decision; 

We also measure how many entities (in linguistic sense) 

were explored during a session with the chatbot. We are 

interested in how thorough and comprehensive the chatbot 

session is. This assessment is sometimes opposite to the 

above two measures but nevertheless is important for 

understanding the overall usability of various conversational 

modes. 

We do not compare precision and recall of search sessions 

with either dialogue mode since the same information is 

delivered, but in distinct modes. 

In the first and second rows, we assess the stand-alone 

systems. Virtual dialogues take less iteration on average for 

information access and about the same number of iterations 

for decisions as conventional dialogues do. 

In the bottom two rows, we observe the usability of the 

hybrid system. When a conventional dialogue is followed by 

a virtual one, a lower portion of users is satisfied by the first 

step in comparison to the inverse architecture, where virtual is 

followed by conventional.
