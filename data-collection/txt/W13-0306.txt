Abstract 

 We present a linguistically-informed 

schema for annotating modal expressions 

and describe its application to a subset of 

the MPQA corpus of English texts (Wiebe 

et al. 2005). The annotation is fine-grained 

in two respects: (i) in the range of 

expressions that are defined as modal 

targets and (ii) in the amount of 

information that is annotated for each 

target expression. We use inter-annotator 

reliability results to support a two-way 

distinction between priority and non-

priority modality types.  

1 Introduction 

An important part of understanding natural 

language depends on the ability to tease apart 

information about the actual from that about the 

modal. From the perspective of textual entailment, 

for example, a non-modal statement like The butler 

is the culprit supports inferences about the actual 

state of affairs which are quite different from those 

supported by modal counterparts of the same 

sentence. Statements of possibility like It’s 

{possible, somewhat likely} that the butler is the 

culprit do not support inferences that are entailed 

by the non-modal sentence, e.g., that the butler lied 

to the police when he said he was innocent. 

Automatically distinguishing between the actual 

and the modal is necessary for high-quality textual 

entailment (Burchardt and Frank 2006, Saurí and 

Pustejovsky 2007, Hickl and Bensley 2007), 

information extraction (Karttunen and Zaenen 

2005), question answering (Saurí et al. 2006), 

sentiment analysis (Wiebe et al. 2005), and 

machine translation (Baker et al. 2012). The 

special attention that modality and non-factuality 

have received in the context of the textual 

entailment task is evidence that these aspects of 

meaning cannot be ignored by practical 

applications that seek to approximate a complete 

understanding of text.   

 

From a computational perspective, modally-

annotated corpora are an indispensible resource for 

training systems to automatically interpret 

modality. This includes automatically detecting 

modal expressions in text, classifying them into 

types (as will be described shortly below), 

identifying their semantic scope, and so on. 

Theoretical linguists have turned to modal 

annotation as well, both as a resource for obtaining 

detailed descriptions of how modality is 

expressed—within and across languages, and 

through the historical development of languages—

and in order to test the predictions of formal 

semantic theories of modality (de Haan 2012a, 

Hacquard and Wellwood 2012, Yanovich 2012). 

 

The annotation of modal meaning is not an 

easy task. It presents a variety of challenges, 

relating on the one hand to the practicalities of 

annotation and on the other to the subtlety of 

distinctions to be drawn in the modal domain. The 



very definition of the set of modal words raises 

questions about the differences between 

prototypical exemplars of the class (e.g., should, 

can) and verbs of propositional attitude (e.g., 

believe, want). Modals also tend to be highly 

ambiguous, with senses that are subtly distinct and 

overlapping (Kratzer 1981). Their interpretation 

essentially presents a challenge of Word Sense 

Disambiguation: A ten-year-old can drive that 

truck can be interpreted both as describing what is 

sanctioned by law (a deontic use of can), and as 

describing an ability of certain individuals (an 

ability use of the modal). In a given context, one 

interpretation (or modality type) but not the other 

may be intended. Mitigating contextual pressures, 

it has been argued that the syntactic configuration 

in which a modal appears constrains the range of 

interpretations it can receive (Cinque 1999, 

Hacquard 2006). The complex interaction of 

context, grammar, and lexical content in the 

expression of modal meaning makes the task of 

creating high-quality annotated modal corpora 

particularly important and challenging. 
 

Our aim in the current project is to propose 

and evaluate a comprehensive and language-

independent schema for annotating modality. We 

experiment with annotating modality types at 

different levels of granularity, marking up textual 

spans that describe the backgrounds of modal 

statements (in the sense of Kratzer 1981), as well 

as comparative and gradable modal expressions. 

These features are described in detail in Section 3. 

In the next section, we situate our project in the 

context of related work.  
 

2 Previous Annotation Efforts 

Recent years have seen a number of major efforts 

of annotating modal expressions in corpora. The 

majority of these works have targeted English texts 

(see Table 1 for a snapshot), but there are also 

notable projects on other languages (de Haan 

2012b, Hendrickx et al. 2012). We briefly 

summarize these representative studies below.  

 

In English, annotation of modality has 

focused to a large extent just on modal auxiliaries 

and verbs. Aspects of modal interpretation that 

have received the most attention concern the 

proposition in the scope of a modal (Ruppenhofer 

and Rehbein 2012, Hendrickx et al. for 

Portuguese), whether or not it occurs in the scope 

of a negative operator (de Haan 2011, Baker et al. 

2012; also much related work on event factuality 

and sentiment analysis), the source providing the 

modal background (Ruppenhofer and Rehbein 

2012, Hendrickx et al. 2012) and the interpretation 

of the modal as either epistemic or non-epistemic 

(i.e., ―root‖). Hacquard and Wellwood (2012) 

focus specifically on modals that occur in 

embedded environments (antecedents of 

conditionals, questions, and complements of 

attitude verbs); de Haan (2011, 2012a) correlates 

the interpretation of modals with register (written 

versus spoken), grammatical features of their 

subject (e.g., its person specification), and 

properties of their verbal complement (e.g., its 

temporal inflection).

3 Annotation Task and Proposed Schema 

3.1 Overview 

With the long-term goal of comparing our 

annotations to previous work, ultimately producing 

a resource that is both reliable and built on a 

platform that is widely used in the field, we 

followed Ruppenhofer and Rehbein (2012) and 

chose the MPQA corpus (Wiebe et al. 2005; 

Wilson 2008) as the corpus to be annotated. 

 

In defining the targets for annotation, we 

developed a working definition of what counts as 

modal. This definition was intended to apply not 

just to modal auxiliaries and verbs (e.g., the 

typically-targeted must, have to), and, moreover, to 

distinguish modals from closely related attitude 

verbs.  A modal expression according to this 

definition is (i) an expression used to describe 

alternative ways the world could be, (ii) that has 

some sort of propositional argument (referred to as 

the prejacent),
1
 and (iii) is not associated with an 

overt attitude holder. Only expressions that met all 

three criteria were considered modal targets for our 

annotation. For example, while the noun hope is 

considered a modal in There is hope that she will 

win, it is not considered a modal in There was still 

hope (condition (ii) is not met). Similarly, believed 

counts as a modal in a sentence like It is believed 

that…, but not when it has an attitude holder as its 

subject (e.g., in She believes that…). 

 

To make the annotators‘ task of identifying 

every modal expression in a text more manageable, 

a seed list of expressions was generated. The list 

was used to pre-highlight candidate modal targets 

in the documents to be annotated. It was compiled 

according to the procedure in (1) and contained a 

total of 321 lemmas.  
 

(1) Seed list – lemmas of expressions in (i)-(iv): 
 

i. Adjectives retrieved via the corpus query 

[it is [ADJ] that] in a large 

corpus (ukWaC, Ferraresi 2007) 

ii. Modal expressions annotated in previous 
work (Table 1) 

                                                           
1 An exception are adnominal modal adjectives. See 

discussion of Modified Elements below. 

iii. Synonyms of the expressions in (i), 
gathered manually using a thesaurus 

iv. Modal adverbs, nouns, comparative and 
superlative adjectives related 

derivationally to the expressions in (i)-(iii) 

 

Importantly, annotators were instructed to 

mark every expression that conveyed modality, 

thereby adding to the pre-highlighted items, and to 

delete items that were marked in error. Excluded 

expressions included future will, modals in 

idiomatic phrases (for example, better in the 

sooner the better), conditional should (as in Should 

it be possible, do it! or If the negotiations should 

continue), and certain teleological verbs (in 

particular, aim at/to in which an attitude holder or 

goal expression are explicit). 

  

The task was carried out by two annotators. 

We began with a training round of 40 files, during 

which the annotators raised issues and discussed 

problematic cases among themselves and with a 

larger group of experts. At the end of the training 

phase the annotation guidelines had been finalized. 

In total, the annotators completed 200 files (183 of 

which contained at least one modal target 

according to at least one annotator). These 

included 1232 fully annotated targets that both 

annotators agreed were modal and that had 

identical spans. There was considerable 

disagreement concerning what counts as modal, as 

can be seen in Table 2.

3.2 Tool 

We used the MMAX2 tool (Müller and Strube 

2006) for our annotation, following Hendrickx et 

al.‘s positive experience. In addition to its 

relatively user-friendly graphical interface, 

MMAX2 can accommodate annotation of 

overlapping and discontinuous elements. As noted 

by these authors, these abilities are crucial for 

annotation of modal features (see (7) below for an 

example involving a discontinuous prejacent).  



Figure 1 shows a target modal as it appears 

to the annotator in MMAX2. Connecting lines are 

drawn between the modal and spans of text that 

correspond to its prejacent, and other features 

potentially represented in the text.

One line connects the modal to its Prejacent, and a 

second one connects it to its Background. 

 

3.3 Annotated Features  

 

This section presents our annotation schema. We 

discuss the central features of the schema, focusing 

on those that are new to this project: Modality 

Type (coarse-grained and fine-grained), 

Propositional Arguments (including prejacents and 

comparatives), Background, Modified Element, 

Degree Indicator, and Outscoping Quantifier. More 

detailed descriptions of all features appear in the 

annotation guidelines, which will be made 

available separately.
2
  

 

Modality Type. Every modal was 

categorized on two levels with respect to the type 

of modality it conveyed in context. Seven fine-

grained types were distinguished: Epistemic, 

Circumstantial, Ability, Deontic, Bouletic, 

Teleological, and Bouletic/Teleological. However, 

before this classification was made, annotators first 

categorized each modal as belonging to one of 

three coarse-grained categories: Epistemic or 

Circumstantial, Ability or Circumstantial, and 

Priority. The label priority picks out a 

conceptually motivated subclass of non-epistemic 

modalities: those that use some "priority" (a desire, 

a goal) to designate certain possibilities as better 

than others (Portner 2009:135ff.)
3
 In Section 4 we 

show that annotators reliably agreed on only the 

highest level split between priority and non-

priority interpretations. 

 
 

                                                           
2 Examples from the ukWaC corpus are noted below as [Web], 

and ones from the annotated corpus are noted as [MPQA]. 
3 A special category of ―TBD‖ (to-be-discussed) was available 

for annotators to mark unclear examples that should be 

revisited. This category was only used a handful of times. 

Non-priority   

 Epistemic: the claim is based on evidence, 
belief or knowledge. 

 Circumstantial: the claim is based on 
circumstances. 

 Ability: the claim is based on what 
someone/something can do.  

 

(2) 

a. Mary must have a good reason for being 
late. (Epistemic) 

b. … for we were in the little salon where 
Madame never sat in the evening, and 

where it was by mere chance that heat was 

still lingering in the stove. [Web] 

(Circumstantial) 

c. The potential losses that could be incurred 
by the tourist industry following a major 

disaster can be illustrated by examining 

the consequences of hurricanes Luis and 

Marilyn to the Caribbean island of 

Anguilla in 1995. [Web] (Ability) 

 

In cases of ambiguity, annotators were 

instructed to mark the modality type on the fine-

grained level as Ability/Circumstantial (interpreted 

as both ability and circumstantial) or 

Epistemic/Circumstantial, as appropriate. Another 

special use of the Ability/Circumstantial label was 

reserved for opportunity modals (for example, the 

interpretation of can in You can see the ocean 

through this window). 

 

(3) 

a. ―…but I say:  Please, that is the most 
dangerous thing you can ever do,‖ he said. 

[MPQA] (Ability/Circumstantial)  

b. Temperatures are very likely to be 
significantly higher when in full screen 

mode because your graphics card will be 

running in 3D mode. [Web] 

(Epistemic/Circumstantial) 
 

Priority 

 Deontic: the claim is based on rules, 
standards, (social) norms. 

 Bouletic: the claim is based on someone‘s 
wishes or desires.  

 Teleological: the claim is goal-oriented.  

 Bouletic/Teleological: for tokens that are 
arguably both bouletic and teleological. 



(4)  

a. The rich must give money to the poor. 
(Deontic) 

b. Today, he is being completely isolated and 
the desire to drive him away is scarcely 

disguised. [MPQA] (Bouletic) 

c. The owner and a neighbor who had helped 
him put down the animal were sent 

urgently to the Hospital for Infectious 

Diseases in Miercurea Ciuc, where they 

received preventive anti-rabies treatment. 

[MPQA] (Teleological) 

d. The donors' conference, […], was hoping 
to raise 1.25 billion dollars (1.47 billion 

euros) for Yugoslavia this year for urgent 

repairs to infrastructure and salaries to 

teachers and other civil servants. [MPQA] 

(Bouletic/Teleological) 

 

 In cases of an ambiguity between deontic 

and any other priority-type modality, a modal was 

given the Priority subtype (the same label as its 

coarse-grained classification). 

 

(5)  

When it gets to the point that Northern Alliance 

troops start firing in the air just next to a car with 

reporters, you have to do something about it, '' 

said Cordell. [MPQA] (ambiguous Priority) 

       

 In addition to modality type, every target 

modal was also specified for its environment‘s 

polarity and associated with a prejacent in the text.  

 

Environmental Polarity. The environment 

of the modal was set to ‗positive‘ by default. In 

cases where the modal was in a semantically 

downward entailing environment, the value of the 

feature was changed to ‗negative‘ and the item 

creating the negative environment (e.g., not or 

reject) marked in the text. In cases where modals 

were in the scope of multiple negative words, these 

were all marked.  

 

(6)  

―There could be no expediency, no compromise, 

no lapse in vigilance,‖ he said.‖ [MPQA] 

 

Note that the environment of the modal was 

not affected by the modal‘s internal polarity: an 

inherently negative modal such as unlikely does 

not create a negative environment. Also, not every 

combination of a modal with negation results in a 

negative environmental polarity for the modal (e.g. 

should in should not outscopes the negation). 

 

Propositional Arguments. The textual 

span corresponding to the proposition a modal 

applies to was annotated as the modal‘s prejacent. 

Prejacents excluded non-restrictive relative clauses 

and parentheticals, tense markers (is in (7)), 

expletive it (see (7)), markers of environmental 

polarity, and degree indicators (see below). 

 

(7)  

It is likely that John, who was my upstairs 

neighbor, will run the race. 

 

Determining whether temporal adverbials 

fell within the prejacent of the modal was left to 

annotator discretion. 

 

(8)  

According to military experts, it is possible that 

clashes will resume between the Taleban and 

UIFSA forces in various regions of Afghanistan 

in the next few days and weeks. [MPQA] 

 

 As modals may also be used 

comparatively, annotators could mark when a 

modal appeared in equative, comparative, or 

superlative forms. In these instances, prejacents as 

well as than-clauses in the text were associated 

with the modal. 

 

(9)  

a. It is likelier that John will run a race. 
(Comparative; the prejacent is underlined 

and there is no than-clause)  

b. John is as likely to run a race as HE is TO 
CLIMB A MOUNTAIN.  

(Equitive; Prejacent and than-clause 

underlined, the latter in small caps) 

 

The remaining features are independent of 

the modal, thus they were only marked if they 

appeared in the text.  

 

Source. This feature was designed to 

indicate the entity that had the ability or knowledge 

that are the basis for a modal claim, or in the case 

of priority modals, the entity placing the obligation 



or setting the goal that the modal takes into 

account. (This definition of Source is similar to the 

one proposed by Hendrickx et al. 2012 and 

Ruppenhofer and Rehbein 2012). Annotators 

marked the closest instance of reference to the 

source, pronominal or otherwise. Sources could be 

inanimate. 

 

 (10)  

In his latest speech, Chen said the long-standing 

dispute with China must be resolved through 

dialogue with respect to the principles of 

democracy and freedom. [MPQA] (Deontic 

Source) 

      

 Where two or more possible sources were 

detected, as in (11), no Source was marked.
4
 

 

(11)  

Chang said after visiting Chinese communities in 

the United States, New Zealand and Southeast 

Asia that education and cultural work needs to be 

further strengthened in the Chinese communities 

in Southeast Asia. [MPQA] 

 

Background. The background of a modal 

is a sequence of (one or more) constituents that 

provide a textual description of the circumstances 

and/or priorities that the modal claim is based on.
5
 

The background may be expressed in an adjunct 

that contains a description of a relevant situation; 

in the case of a priority modal, (12), a rationale 

clause may describe the relevant goals and 

preferences. 

 

(12)  

With the new method, all you need do to get an 

answer is put all the ingredients into a test tube, 

mix them together, and check to see what the 

output is. [MPQA]  

 

Modified Element. We also included in 

our annotation modals that were not used 

predicatively, but as modifiers of nouns or 

adjectives (as in, the probable answer, It was 

sufficiently concrete). The head (underlined in the 

                                                           
4 An alternative strategy would be to mark multiple Sources in 

such cases, or to mark the more plausible source (in this 

example, Chang). 
5 A related feature tracking whether there is ―overt evidence‖ 

for a must claim in the text is raised by de Haan (2011). 

examples above) of the modified phrase was 

marked as a Modified Element and associated with 

the modal in these cases.
6
 

 

Degree Indicator. Any item that indicated 

degrees of modal necessity or possibility was 

annotated. In cases where two or more degree 

indicators were used, they were treated as one 

degree indicator for purposes of the annotation.  

 

(13)  

There is a very high likelihood that it will rain. 

 

Adverbs like perhaps were not treated as 

degree indicators, but as independent modals (in 

cases such as It could perhaps be...). 

 

Outscoping Quantifier. Quantificational 

elements that are part of a modal‘s prejacent but 

are nevertheless interpreted as taking semantic 

scope over the modal were marked as outscoping 

quantifiers.  

 

(14)  

Everyone can win the prize. 

 

Finally, additional features for each modal 

were its Lemma (included automatically for pre-

highlighted modals), and a text box for optional 

comments (used, e.g., for indicating that the modal 

was in the title of the document). Table 3 

summarizes the features annotated and their

4 Reliability of the Annotations  

As an indication of the reliability of our 

annotation, we measured inter-annotator agreement 

on the following features: Modality Type, 

Prejacent, and Background. The results obtained 

allow for initial comparison with previous 

annotation projects.  

 

4.1 Inter-annotator Reliability Measure: 
Krippendorff's α  

Inter-annotator reliability is standardly measured 

with a number of different α and κ scores (Carletta 

1996, Artstein and Poesio 2008). These scores 

measure the degree of agreement for a pair or set 

of annotators given some common set of 

annotation guidelines. Though the details of 

calculation and presupposed conditions vary 

among different scores, the statistics themselves 

are comparable, with 0.0 reflecting agreement no 

better than would occur at chance and 1.0 

reflecting perfect agreement. 

 

Many reliability measures presuppose 

identical annotation items. In our case, this is 

insufficient, as the annotators are marking features 

with values that are spans of text of potentially 

variable position and length (e.g., Prejacent, 

Background). For this reason, Krippendorff's 

(2004) α score was selected as a measure of inter-

annotator reliability. The agreement score is 

computed along a continuum, comparing the 

overlap between spans that were marked by the 

annotators, and allowing for partial agreement 

when spans are not perfectly aligned.  

 

In our analysis, we included only the 1232 

agreed-upon modals (targets that were marked as 

modal by both annotators and that had identical 

spans). We ignored cases of partial overlap (where 

one annotator marked would like and the other its 

substring would, for example). We calculated inter-

annotator agreement on Modality Type, Prejacent 

(to the exclusion of other propositional arguments), 

and Background. 

4.2 Results 

Table 4 shows the reliability of annotations for the 

three features mentioned above. We begin with 

discussion of Modality Type, the feature that has 

received most attention in previous work. The 

basic score, measuring agreement on the ten 

possible values for this feature, was low (α = 0.49). 

The effect of a number of category collapses was 

therefore investigated. First, all priority-type 

categories were collapsed (i.e., Bouletic, 

Teleological, Bouletic/Teleological, Deontic, and 

Priority were treated as one category for purposes 

of the agreement calculation; ―Priority types 

collapsed‖ in Table 4). Second, all non-priority 

types (i.e., Epistemic, Circumstantial, Ability, 

Epistemic/Circumstantial, Ability/Circumstantial) 

were collapsed into one, and finally, both of these 

collapses were applied together. This final merging 

of categories (the final row in the Table) resulted 

in a high α score of 0.89. 

 

Conventionally, κ and α scores are 

considered acceptable at a threshold of 0.80 

(Carletta 1996). A word sense disambiguation task 

(Ng et al. 1999) has been reported with raw κ 

scores at 0.317, and 0.862 after using a collapsing 

algorithm to attain better agreement. Hacquard and 

Wellwood (2012) achieved a κ score of 0.84 on a 

two-way classification of epistemic versus root 

modalities. Table 5 compares our α agreement 

scores for individual modals with the κ scores 

reported on a superset of the data by Ruppenhofer 

and Rehbein ([RR 2012] below).

Agreement scores for the Prejacent and 

Background features, α = 0.65 and α = 0.61 

respectively, represent how well the spans that 

annotators marked align overall (although note that 

they do not take into account the association of 

particular spans to modals in the text). Prejacents 

have been annotated in previous studies, but inter-

annotator agreement scores for this feature have 

not previously been reported, as far as we know.  

4.3 Discussion 

Collapsing the priority types as well as the non-

priority types results in essentially a two-way 

distinction that is similar to the Root versus 

Epistemic distinction assumed in previous 

annotation projects (see Table 1). Our results 

support making the distinction at this coarse-

grained level. Since the α score is designed to 

cancel out any random (dis)agreement, the 

increasing values with each collapse show that the 

annotators cannot reliably discern the more fine-

grained distinctions of modal ―flavor‖. (Rubinstein 

et al. 2012 report similar results in a 

crowdsourcing experiment with non-expert native 

speakers.) Nevertheless, while the coarse-grained 

distinctions may prove more reliable for Machine 

Learning and other NLP applications, having 

access to the annotators‘ finer-grained judgments 

could be helpful for theoretical purposes. They 

allow the researcher to distinguish between more 

and less ambiguous exemplars of each modality 

type and to investigate the grammatical and 

contextual properties of examples that are judged 

as more ambiguous. We thus propose to annotate 

for each modal a unique coarse-grained type as 

well as a list of one or more fine-grained types

corresponding to the annotators‘ individual 

judgments. 

 

Since collapsing non-priority subtypes 

results in a greater increase to the 0.49 α baseline 

(0.73 vs. 0.66 for priority collapsed), we conclude 

that the difficulty to distinguish epistemic, 

circumstantial, and ability modalities is greater 

than the difficulty to distinguish between different 

subtypes of priority modality. In the confusion 

matrix below, the affinity between the ability and 

circumstantial types is evident in the decisions of 

row annotator within the a-column, and in the 

decisions of column annotator across the c-row.

Table 6: Modality Type confusion matrix (a-

ability, c-circumstantial, b-bouletic, d-deontic, e- 

epistemic, p-priority, t-teleological, a+c-ability 

and circumstantial, similarly e+c and b+t) 

 

Cells marked in red in the confusion matrix 

evidence confusion between teleological and 

deontic interpretations on the one hand, and 

epistemic/circumstantial and even ability 

interpretations on the other. We leave investigation 

of the relevant examples to future work. 

5 Conclusion 

We have proposed a schema for annotating modal 

meaning that builds on previous work and extends 

it with a number of novel features. Completing the 

annotation of the MPQA corpus according to this 

schema, we hope to contribute to the development 

of reliable computational resources for detecting 

and interpreting modals in naturally occurring text.
