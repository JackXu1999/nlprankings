Abstract

Entity linking and semantic parsing have been shown to be crucial to important applications
such as question answering and document understanding. These tasks often require structured
learning models, which make predictions on multiple interdependent variables. In this talk, I
argue that carefully designed structured learning algorithms play a central role in entity linking
and semantic parsing tasks. In particular, I will present several new structured learning models
for entity linking, which jointly detect mentions and disambiguate entities as well as capture
non-textual information. I will then show how to use a staged search procedure to building
a state-of-the-art knowledge base question answering system. Finally, if time permits, I will
discuss different supervision protocols for training semantic parsers and the value of labeling
semantic parses.
