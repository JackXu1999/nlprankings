Abstract 

WordNet is an electronic lexical database 

available on-line as a powerful resource to 

the researchers in the area of computational 

linguistics, text processing and other related 

areas. WordNet for Hindi language has al-

ready been developed by IIT, Bombay. The 

Indian languages WordNets are being created 

using expansion approach from Hindi Word-

Net under IndoWordNet project. In expan-

sion approach, semantic relations are bor-

rowed from the reference language, while the 

lexical relations need to be created for each 

language, as these relations are language de-

pendent.  This paper describes the process of 

creation of lexical relations like antonym, 

compounding, conjunction and gradation for 

IndoWordNet. A lexical creation tool has 

been presented in this paper with provision to 

create lexical relations in target language on 

the basis of relations created in Hindi Word-

Net and with another provision to create lexi-

cal relations in target language without refer-

ring to Hindi WordNet. It has been observed 

that lexical relations for target language can 

be created easily on the basis of relations cre-

ated in Hindi WordNet for Hindi in-family 

languages, while for the languages that do not 

fall in the same family provision of creation 

of lexical relation without referring to Hindi 

WordNet can be used. 

1 Introduction 

WordNet is a large lexical database of a lan-

guage. In WordNet, words are grouped together 

according to their similarity of meanings. Word-

Net maintains concepts in a language, relations 

between concepts and their ontological details. 

Each concept in a language represents a synset. 

Synsets are basic building blocks of WordNet. 

Synset is composed of gloss, example sentences 

and set of synonym words that are used for the 

concept. Besides synset data, a WordNet main-

tains lexical and semantic relations. Lexical rela-

tions like antonomy and gradation are between 

the words in a language whereas semantic rela-

tions like hypernymy, hyponymy, meronymy, 

holonymy, entailment, troponymy and casuation 

are between concepts in a language. WordNet 

structure makes it a useful tool for computational 

linguistics and natural language processing. The 

major applications of WordNet are text categori-

zation (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2004), text 

summarization (Bellare et al., 2004), word sense 

disambiguation (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2002) 

and machine translation etc.  

Recognizing the immense importance of lexi-

cal resources arises the necessity for creation of 

IndoWordNet project. IndoWordNet is a linked 

structure of WordNets of major Indian languages 

from Indo-Aryan, Dravidian and Sino-Tibetan 

families. The WordNets for these languages are 

being created using the expansion approach from 

the Hindi WordNet which was made available 

free for research in 2006. Using expansion ap-

proach, there is advantage of being able to bor-

row the semantic relations of a given source 

WordNet (Bhattacharyya, 2010). Lexical rela-

tions cannot be borrowed from source WordNet 

using expansion approach as they are language 

dependent. In order to create lexical relations for 

IndoWordNet languages, a lexical creation tool 

has been proposed in this paper with a provision 

to create lexical relations from source WordNet 

and as well as to create lexical relations for those 

words which are not covered in source WordNet.  

2 Related Work 

English WordNet is the first WordNet created in 

this field. The development of English WordNet 

started in 1985 (Miller, 1985) at the Cognitive 

Science Laboratory of Princeton University. The 

success of English WordNet has inspired several 

projects that aim at constructing the WordNet for 

other languages or to develop multilingual 

WordNet. EuroWordNet is a system of semantic

network for European languages. The Eu-

roWordNet project dealt with Dutch, Italian, 

Spanish, German, French, Czech, and Estonian 

languages (Vossen, 1998).  BalkaNet WordNet 

project has developed WordNets for Bulgarian, 

Greek, Romanian, Serbian and Turkish lan-

guages (Tufis et al., 2004).  

In India, Hindi WordNet was developed in 

2006 by IIT, Bombay. Later on Hindi WordNet 

was extended to Marathi WordNet. Currently 

IndoWordNet project, a linked structure of major 

Indian languages is in progress in India. Moreo-

ver, Indradhunsh Project a part of IndoWordNet 

project, aim at developing WordNets for seven 

major Indian languages, Bengali, Gujarati, 

Kashmiri, Konkani, Oriya, Punjabi and Urdu has 

been initiated in 2010. These Indian languages 

WordNets are being created using expansion ap-

proach from Hindi WordNet under the guidance 

of IIT, Bombay. 

3 WordNet relations  

WordNet contains the standard information 

found in dictionaries and thesauri. An additional 

feature of WordNet is its information about the 

relationships between words and synsets. The 

words and synsets in the WordNet are linked 

through two types of relations, i.e., lexical and 

semantic relations. Lexical relation exists be-

tween the word forms while semantic relation 

exists between the concepts.  

3.1 Semantic relations  

Semantic relation is a relation between mean-

ings, and since meanings can be represented by 

synsets, semantic relations can be considered as 

pointers between synsets (Tufis et al., 2004). For 

example, hypernym/hyponym is a semantic rela-

tion. Consider two synsets given in (1) and (2). 

{ਪੌਦਾ paudā ’plant’, ਬੂਟਾ būṭā ‘plant’}       ...(1) 

{ਚਾਹ cāh ‘tea’}           ...(2) 

Here, {ਪੌਦਾ paudā ’plant’, ਬੂਟਾ būṭā ’plant’} is 

hypernym of {ਚਾਹ cāh ‘tea’} and {ਚਾਹ cāh ‘tea’} 

is hyponym of {ਪੌਦਾ paudā ’plant’, ਬੂਟਾ būṭā 

’plant’}. There are total thirteen semantic rela-

tions, namely, hypernymy, hyponymy, mer-

onymy, holonymy, entailment, causation, tro-

ponymy, ability link, capability link, functional 

link, attributes, modifies noun and modifies verb 

exist in a WordNet. 

   Using expansion approach there is advantage 

of being able to borrow the semantic relations of 

a given WordNet. For example, consider two 

synsets in the source WordNet given in (3) and 

(4). 

{चाय chaie ‘tea’}          ...(3) 

{पौधा paudha ‘plant’, पौदा pauda ‘plant’}   ...(4) 

In Hindi WordNet (source), synset given by 

(4) is hypernymy of synset given by (3) and syn-

set given by (3) is hyponym of synset given by 

(4). These two synsets also share hyperony-

my/hyponymy relation in Punjabi (target) lan-

guage. Since, the synset-id are kept same for all 

the languages, therefore, semantic relations from 

the source WordNet (Hindi) can be extended to 

all target languages with expansion approach.  

3.2 Lexical Relations 

Lexical relations are the relations between mem-

bers of two different synsets. For example, con-

sider two synsets given in (5) and (6). 

{ਮੋਟਾ mōṭā ‘fat’, ਭਾਰੀ bhārī ‘fat’, ਸਥੂਲ sathūl ’fat’, 

ਥੂਲ thūl ‘fat’,ਵਜਨੀ vajnī ‘fat’}        ...(5) 

{ਪਤਲਾ patlā ‘thin’, ਦੁਬਲਾ dublā ‘thin’, ਕਮਜ਼ੋਰ 

kamzōr ‘thin’, ਮਾੜਾ māṛā ‘thin’}                   …(6) 

Here, synsets (5) and (6) are opposites but 

they do not share antonym relation. Antonym 

relation exists between two words not between 

two synsets. Here, words ਮੋਟਾ mōṭā ’fat’ and 

ਪਤਲਾ  patlā ‘thin’ are in antonym relation. 

4 Lexical creation tool 

In order to create the lexical relations for all the 

participating languages of IndoWordNet project, 

a lexical creation tool has been designed with 

provision to create lexical relations in target lan-

guage on the basis of relations created in Hindi 

WordNet and with another provision to create 

lexical relations in target language without refer-

ring to Hindi WordNet.  Lexical creation tool can 

create the following lexical relations. 

 Antonym 

 Compounding 

 Conjunction 

 Gradation  
In the subsequent subsection the lexical crea-

tion tool has been presented by considering Pun-

jabi as target language. However, the system is 

able to handle all languages participating in In-

doWordNet project. 

 



4.1 Antonymy creation tool With reference 
to Hindi WordNet   

Antonymy is a lexical relation that exists be-

tween a pair of words that represent opposite 

meaning. The antonyms for Hindi WordNet have 

already been created. Antonyms for the Punjabi 

WordNet can be created from the antonyms of 

Hindi WordNet, but database design of Punjabi 

WordNet is different from Hindi WordNet. 

There is a need to design an interface which can 

bridge the gap between two different database 

designs and create the antonyms for the Punjabi 

WordNet from Hindi WordNet. Algortihm 4.1 

has been used for creation of antonyms from 

Hindi WordNet. The algorithm is developed us-

ing IndoWordNet database design (IndoWordNet 

Database design, 2011) and Hindi WordNet da-

tabase design followed by IIT, Bombay. 

Algorithm 4.1: Creation of Antonyms with 

reference to Hindi WordNet   

1. Extract synset_id of source Hindi syn-

set_word from HWN_DB table. 

2. Extract word_ids from wn_synset_word 

table, for the synset_id found in step 1. 

3. For each word_id found in step 2, extract 

the corresponding words in target lan-

guage from wn_word table. 

4. Extract synset_id of antonym Hindi syn-

set_word from tbl_noun_anto_direction 

table. 

5. Extract word_ids from wn_synset_word 

table, for the synset_id found in step 4. 

6. For each word_id found in step 5, extract 

corresponding words in target language 

from wn_word table. 

Description of Algorithm 4.1 

For example, for the word पूर्व purav ‘east’ in 

Hindi, system searches for source word in 

tbl_noun_anto_direction table and extract corre-

sponding synset_id, i.e., 6898 as shown in Figure 

1. For the given synset_id 6898, system refers to 

wn_synset_word table to extract the word_ids as 

shown in step 1 of Figure 1. For each of the 

word_id found, system retrieves the correspond-

ing words in target language, i.e., Punjabi from 

wn_word table as shown step 2 of Figure 1. The 

similar approach has been followed to find the 

antonym words for antonym synset_id. A user 

interface has been designed in Java to provide 

the relevant information to the end user as shown 

in Figure 2.

4.2 Antonymy creation tool without refer-

ence to Hindi WordNet 

The antonym relation may also exist between the 

words which are not covered in Hindi WordNet, 

but may exist in the target language. This is a 

very common case for those Indian languages 

that do not belong to same language family as 

Hindi. There is need to design a tool which can 

create the antonyms for such words. The algo-

rithm 4.2 has been designed for the creation of 

antonym for these words. The algorithm is de-

veloped using IndoWordNet database design 

(IndoWordNet Database design, 2011).  

Algorithm 4.2: Creation of Antonyms without 

reference to Hindi WordNet   

1. Extract word_id of the input word in tar-
get language from wn_word table. 

2. Extract synset_ids from wn_synset_word 
table, for word_id found in step 1. 

3. For each synset_id found in step 2, ex-
tract the corresponding concepts from 

wn_synset table. 

4. Extract word_id of the input antonym 
word in target language from the 

wn_word table. 

5. Extract synset_ids from wn_synset_word 
table, for word_id found in step 4. 

6. For each synset_id found in step 5, ex-
tract the corresponding concepts from 

wn_synset table. 

Description of algorithm 4.2  

Let us consider an example for creation of anto-

nym for input Punjabi word,  ਚੰਗਾ caṅgā ‘good 

character’, the system refers to wn_word table to 

extracts corresponding word_id as shown in Step 

1 of Figure 3.

Figure 5: Interface for creation of antonyms without Hindi WordNet 

 

For a given word_id, system extracts synset_ids 

from wn_synset_word table. Concepts for ex-

tracted synset_id have been retrieved from 

wn_sysnset table as shown in step 3 given in 

Figure 3. The similar approach has been fol-

lowed for corresponding input antonym word. 

The process of extraction of antonym word in-

formation is depicted in Figure 4.  

   A user interface has been designed in Java to 

provide relevant information to end user as 

shown in Figure 5. 

 

 

4.3  Compounding creation tool  

Compounding relation relates a compound word 

with its part word. A compound word is formed 

when two words are joined to form a new word. 

An interface has been designed to create such 

relations from compounding relations that al-

ready exist in Hindi WordNet. The tool reduces 

manual typing effort for the creation of com-

pounding relation.  

   The snapshot of Compounding creation tool 

taking Hindi WordNet as basis is given in Figure 

6.

Figure 7: Compounding creation tool without taking Hindi WordNet as basis 

A compounding relation may exist in target lan-

guage between those words that are not covered 

by Hindi WordNet. For this a tool has been de-

veloped. The snapshot of compounding creation 

tool, without taking Hindi WordNet as basis is 

given in Figure 7.  

 

 

4.4  Conjunction creation tool  

Conjunction relation relates a conjunction word 

with its part word. The snapshot of conjunction 

creation tool taking Hindi WordNet as basis is 

given in Figure 8.  

   The snapshot of conjunction creation tool 

without taking Hindi WordNet as basis is given 

in Figure 9.

Figure 9: Conjunction creation tool without taking Hindi WordNet as basis 



4.5  Gradation creation tool  

Gradation is a lexical relation that exists between 

three word forms. It represents the intermediate 

concept between two opposite concepts. The 

snapshot of gradation creation tool taking Hindi 

WordNet as basis is given in Figure 10. 

   The snapshot of conjunction creation tool with 

out taking Hindi WordNet as basis is given in   

Figure 11.

Figure 11: Gradation creation tool without taking Hindi WordNet as basis 

5.  Conclusion 

Using expansion approach semantic relations are 

borrowed from the source language as they are 

same for all the languages. Lexical relations are 

language specific, so they cannot be borrowed 

from the source language. It has been observed 

that manual typing work can be reduced for Hin-

di in-family languages to a larger extent by creat-

ing lexical relations for target language on the 

basis of relations created in Hindi WordNet, 

while for languages that do not fall in the same 

family provision of creation of lexical relation 

without referring to Hindi WordNet will be help-

ful extensively.
