Abstract 

Internet communication plays a considerable 

part in economic, financial and even politic 

domains. It is greatly influencing the politic 

revolution of many Arabic countries. That 

allows Internet communication to take more 

and more scale especially in an Arabic 

context. In this case, we notice that Internet 

communication is based on textual 

interchange using Arabic dialects more than 

Arabic language. However, few efforts were 

made for Arabic dialect processing 

particularly for aeb
1
 language. In this case, 

we suggest building a standardized aeb 

Wordnet, which is a basic tool for Natural 

Language Processing (NLP) of aeb language. 

In this article, we present an extended 

Wordnet-LMF model acquired to aeb 

language specificities used to represent aeb 

Wordnet and we describe building steps. 

1 Introduction 

Wordnet, firstly developed for English language, 

cover newer days many others languages and 

even dialects. In an Arabic case, many efforts 

were make to build a Wordnet for Modern 

standard Arabic but no real attempt has been 

made for Arabic dialects. 

Arabic dialects represent Arabic language 

variations often spoken. However, they are 

written in some press articles, theater pieces, 

poetic books and Internet based communication 

such as email, instant messaging, forums, blogs, 

social networks, etc. 

With the politic revolution of several Arabic 

countries like Tunisia (i.e. also Egypt, Syria, 

etc.), Arabic dialect processing takes more and 

                                                           
1 aeb is the ISO 639-3 language code for Tunisian Arabic. 

more scale in Arabic countries and particularly in 

Tunisia. 

In this case, we suggest building a powerful 

semantic lexicon for Tunisian dialect (aeb 

language): aeb Wordnet using the expand 

approach which is formulated according to an 

adapted format of Wordnet-LMF. The use of 

standardized Lexical Markup Framework (LMF) 

ISO 24613 format allows interchange between 

aeb Wordnet and other standardized lexicons. 

2 Challenges 

Developing an aeb wordnet faces many 

constraints associated to resources, language 

characteristics and use. 

Generally, building a Wordnet needs a lot of 

resources. But, for aeb language few written 

resources are found: an electronic bilingual 

dictionary eng
2
-aeb, some press articles, some 

theater pieces, some poesy books, etc. Indeed, 

aeb like other Arabic dialects is sometimes 

written and it’s not educated.  

In addition to the lack of resources, we notice 

many language specificities:  absence of standard 

transcription, use of six variations (i.e. Tunis, 

Sahel, Sfax, occidental north, occidental south 

and oriental south) and estrangement from 

English language and even from Arabic 

language. Indeed, aeb language is characterized 

by the absence of standard transcription: the 

same word can be represented by different 

transcriptions e.g. the word [ْْإِْتَوقَّع /ʔitwaqqaʔˤ/
3
] 

"anticipate" can be transcribed as [ْْإِْتَوقَّع 

/ʔitwaqqaʔˤ/] or [ْْْتَوقَّع /twaqqaʔˤ/]. Also, it uses six 

variations e.g. the variations of the personal 

pronoun "I" are illustrated by the Table 1.

Alphabet (IPA).

In addition, aeb is a Semitic language like 

Arabic very different from English at 

morphological, lexical and syntactical levels and 

also different from Arabic seeing that its 

alphabet counts three consonants which aren’t 

used in Arabic (i.e. [ڢ  /v/ ],[ڤ /q’/] and [ݒ /P/]), 

its lexicon is full of foreign words (e.g. the word 

 da:ku:rdu:/] "all right"  is borrowed/ َداُكوْرُدو]

from Italian language) and it uses Arabic roots to 

express other meanings (e.g. the Arabic root 

 xdm/] meaning "to serve" is used in aeb/خدم]

language as [ْْْخِدم/xdim/] to express "to work"). 

Also, the use of aeb language raises other 

constraints. Indeed, aeb use covers spoken and 

written forms. The last form can be diacritized, 

not diacritized or partially diacritized e.g. the 

word [ْْإِْتَوقَّع] "anticipate" can be transcribed as 

 It can be also scripted with  .[إْتوقَّْعْ]ْ[إتوقع] ,[إِْتَوقَّعْْ]

Arabic, Latin or a mixed script e.g. the word 

 ,[إِْتَوقَّعْْ] anticipate" can be transcribed as" [إِْتَوقَّعْْ]

[etwa99a3]ْor [et993و].     

3 Wordnet-LMF 

Towards generation of a standard model 

representing lexicons, many works are made 

around LMF. Wordnets, seen that they are 

considered as semantic lexicons, can use LMF. 

They precisely can use Wordnet-LMF formed by 

the components described below. These 

components are not sufficient to express 

correctly aeb particularities such as the use of 

many transcriptions for the same lexical entry, 

the variation, the phonetic sight or the inflected 

and derived forms. So, we add others LMF 

components as extension. 

3.1 Components 

Wordnets, all over the world, share the same 

basic concepts (i.e. word, verb, noun, adjective, 

adverb, synset, etc.) and organization (i.e. sets of 

synonyms, each representing a lexicalized 

concept (Miller, 1995)) but they have different 

representations. Some efforts were made, 

thought the project Knowledge-Yielding 

Ontologies for Transition-Based Organization 

(KYOTO
4
), to propose a standardized model for 

                                                           
4 KYOTO (project nr. 211423) FP7-ICT-2007-1 

Wordnets: KYOTO-LMF or Wordnet-LMF. This 

model is an LMF dialect. It is a Wordnet adapted 

version of the common standardized framework 

for representing natural language processing 

(NLP) lexicons: ISO 24613 LMF (Soria and 

Monachini, 2008).  

This model is composed of twenty one 

elements (Soria et al., 2009). LexicalResource is 

the root element with three children representing 

general information (i.e GlobalInformation), the 

lexicon associate to a defined language (i.e. 

Lexicon) and a bracketing element grouping 

together SenseAxis (i.e. SenseAxe). The root 

element describes the resource that can be a 

monolingual or a multilingual Wordnet. The 

other elements can be distributed over three 

different packages, i.e. the morphological, the 

NLP semantic and the NLP multilingual 

notations package. 

The morphological package contains five 

elements describing a lexeme in a given 

language (i.e. LexicalEntry), a word that can be a 

root, a stem, an inflected form or a multiword 

expression (i.e. Lemma), one meaning of a 

LexicalEntry (i.e. Sense), a link between a Sense 

and another resource (i.e. Monolingual-

ExternalRef) and a bracketing element grouping 

together MonolingualExternalRef (i.e. Mono-

lingualExternalRefs). 

The NLP semantic package is formed by 

seven elements representing a set of shared 

meanings within the same language (i.e. Synset), 

the gloss associate with one synset (i.e. 

Definition), an example of use associate to one 

synset (i.e. Statement), a relation between 

synsets (i.e. SynsetRelation), a bracketing 

element grouping together RelationSynset (i.e. 

RelationSynsets), a link between a Synset and 

another resource (i.e MonolingualExternalRef) 

and a bracketing element grouping together 

MonolingualExternalRef (i.e. Monolingual-

ExternalRefs). 

And finally, the NLP Multilingual notations 

package containing four elements used only to 

describe multilingual Wordnets. 

This model contains also an element 

describing administrative information (i.e. Meta) 

used with LexicalEntry, MonolingualExternal-

Ref, Synset and SynsetRelation. 

3.2 Wordnet-LMF vs aeb language 

Wordnet-LMF is a model adopted, in the project  



 
Figure 1. Wordnet-LMF object diagram of the  word [ْْإِْتَوقَّع /ʔitwaqqaʔˤ/] "anticipate" 

 

KYOTO, to represent Wordnets of English, 

Dutch, Italian, Basque, Spanish, Chinese and 

Japanese (Soria et al., 2009). These languages 

are different from aeb language. So, the use of 

Wordnet-LMF to represent aeb language can’t 

preserve the language specificities.  

    The Figure 1 represents the Unified Modeling 

Language (UML
5
) object diagram of Wordnet-

LMF associated to the word [ْْإِْتَوقَّع /ʔitwaqqaʔˤ/] 

"anticipate". It illustrates the limits of Wordnet-

LMF for aeb language description. Indeed, 

Wordnet-LMF model doesn’t express the use of 

many transcriptions for the same lexical entry, 

the variation, the phonetic and the inflected 

forms of a lexical entry and the structure of 

Semitic languages (i.e. derivation phenomena).  

3.3 Extension  

To express properly the aeb language 

specificities, we suggest extending Wordnet-

LMF using ISO LMF. 

In this case, we firstly propose to replace the 

cardinality "1..1" of the association between  

LexicalEntry and Lemma by the cardinality 

"1..*".That allows the affection of more than one 

Lemma to the same LexicalEntry as it is shown 

in Figure 3, e.g. the lexicalEntry [ْْإِْتَوقَّع 

/ʔitwaqqaʔˤ/] "anticipate" has two lemmas 

illustrated by the figure below.

purpose modeling language in the field of software 

engineering (Wikipedia). 

 

Figure 2. Lemmas of the word [ْْإِْتَوقَّع 

/ʔitwaqqaʔˤ/] "anticipate" 

 

Secondly, we propose to add two attributes for 

the entity Lemma: script and orthographyName, 

seen that aeb transcription uses Arabic or Latin 

script. 

    Finally, we suggest adding three ISO LMF 

elements: FormRepresentation, WordForm and 

RelatedForm to represent respectively the 

phonetic and the variation, the inflected and the 

derived forms of a lexical entry (ISO 24613, 

2008). E.g. these elements are integrated for the 

word [ْْإِْتَوقَّع /ʔitwaqqaʔˤ/] "anticipate" like it is 

shown in the Figure 3.

Consequently, we get the Wordnet-LMF 

extended model accurate to aeb language shown 

by UML class diagram in the Figure 4. 

4 aeb Wordnet construction 

In general, building Wordnet can be done by 

merged or expanded approach (Vossen, 1998). 

The merged approach consists on the creation of 

synsets and synset relations using language 

resources. But, the expand approach generates 

synsets and synset relations from the widely used 

WordNet: Princeton WordNet (PWN) by 

translation. 

    The first approach save the language 

specificities but it is complex and need a lot of 

language resources. The second one is easy and 

needs only PWN and bilingual dictionaries but it 

generates a biased Wordnet to PWN. 

    In the case of aeb Wordnet development, the 

first approach can’t be used because of the lack 

of aeb resources. So, we adopt the expanded 

approach. We use PWN 3.1 released in 2011 and 

the only bilingual dictionary found for English 

and Arabic Tunisian: Peace Corps dictionary of 

Rached Ben Abdelkader, Abdeljelil Ayed and 

Aziza Naouar edited in July 1977 listing about 

6000 aeb words. 

    Aeb Wordnet is developed manually, with the 

format XML
6
, throw three steps: creation, 

validation and extension. 

4.1 Creation 

Wordnet is a set of lexical entries L= {l} and a 

set of synsets S={s}. A lexical entry l is 

composed of one word wW at least, which can 

be a Lemma or a WordForm. A synset s is 

composed of a subset of lexical entries L’ and a 

set of synset relations R={r}. 

To generate aeb Wordnet (Laeb, Saeb) we use 

both PWN and Peace Corps dictionary D. 

Indeed, for every translation tD, we generate a 

subset of lexical entries L’aeb and a subset of 

synsets S’aeb.  

A translation t can be monosemous (t = (weng, 

waeb)), divergent polysemous (t= {(weng, 

w1aeb), (weng, w2aeb), {(weng, w3aeb)          

…}) or represent a lexical lacuna (t= (weng, ø)).  

In the first case, the translation t = (weng, 

waeb) generates one lexical entry laeb for waeb 

                                                           
6 XML is a markup language that defines a set of rules for 

encoding documents in a format that is both human-

readable and machine-readable (Wikipedia).

considered as a lemma and a subset of synset 

S’aeb like it is presented in the Figure 5. 

S’aeb={s (L’aeb, R)} is equivalent to S’pwn={s 

(L’pwn, R)} i.e. synsets of weng in PWN and 

L’aeb is obtained from the translation of words 

in L’pwn using D. 

 

 
Figure 5. Monosemous translation 

 

 E.g. the translation t1= {("anticipate", 

 generates the lexical entry laeb {("إِْتَوقَّعْْ"

described by the Figure 3 with six senses (i.e. 

equivalent to the english word "anticipate" 

senses) as it is shown below.

In the second case, the translation t= {(weng, 

w1aeb), …, {(weng, wnaeb)} shown in Figure 6 

generates a subset of lexical entries L’aeb (i.e. 

L’aeb = {l1aeb, …, lnaeb } /l1aeb and lnaeb 

have respectively w1aeb and wnaeb as Lemmas) 

and a subset of synset S’aeb= {s (L’aeb, R)} 

equivalent to S’pwn={s (L’pwn, R)}. 

 

 
Figure 6. Polysemous translation 



The subset of synsets S’aeb includes synsets 

of the lexical entries in L’ ={ l1aeb , … , lnaeb}/ 

S’aeb= S’l1 aeb  (S’l2 aeb – S’l1 aeb  S’l2 

aeb)  …   (S’lnaeb -S’ln-1aebS’lnaeb) e.g. 

the translation t2={("work", "ْْْخِدم"), ("work","ْْم َخدِّ

")} generates L’aeb={"ْْمْْ","ْخِدم  composed of {"َخدِّ

two lexical entries and S’={aeb-10-02418610-v, 

aeb-10-02415985-v, aeb-10-02531113-v, aeb-10-

by the Figure 7.

entries generated from the translation t2 

 

    Finally, the third case presented in Figure 8 

doesn’t affect aeb Wordnet e.g. the translation 

t3= {("fir", ø)}. 

 

 
Figure 8. Lexical lacuna 

4.2 Validation 

Some aeb Wordnet elements need validation 

through or after creation. LexicalEntry is 

validated through creation but Sense, Synset and 

SynsetRelation are validated after creation. The 

validation consists on the affection of "True" 

value to the attribute status of Meta element. We 

validate an element when we find it in a 

confident resource such as dictionary, press 

article, theater piece, poetic book, etc. 

 
     

    E.g. from the press article ْتحويسهْمعاْعبدْالباقيْبن

 October 2001 at the top, we الّصريح from مسعود

validate the Synset s aeb-10-00590283-v and the 

Sense 2 _ْخِدمْْ  of the lexicalEntry ْْْخِدم as it is shown 

below. 
<Synset id=" aeb-10-02415985-v" baseConcept="1"> 

<Meta author="Karmani Nadia" date="2013-09-03" source="ْ

status="TRUE"/> 

…

<LexicalEntry  id= "ْخِدمْْ  "> 

… 
<Sense id="2 _ْخِدمْْ " synset="aeb-10-02415985-v"> 

<Meta author="Karmani Nadia" date="2013-09-03" 

source="PWN3.1" status="TRUE"/> 
<MonolingualExternalRefs> 

<monolingualExternalRef externalSystem="WordNet3.1" 

externalReference="eng-31-02415985-v" /> 
</MonolingualExternalRefs> 

</Sense> 

… 
<LexicalEntry> 

4.3 Extension 

To create aeb Wordnet, we use Peace Corps 

dictionary containing about 6000 aeb words used 

in Tunis. This potential cannot be compared to 

PWN 3.1 potential counting about 147278 eng 

words
7
. It represents 24.54% of PWN 3.1 

potential.  

In this case, we suggest enriching aeb 

Wordnet lexicon by derivation, by variation and 

by corpus.  

The first method consists on the generation of 

derived forms when it is possible (i.e. when the 

word is derivative, not fixed or borrowed). 

Indeed, aeb language is a Semitic language like 

Arabic. So, from a root we can build many words 

according to defined patterns e.g. from the root 

 ʃrab/] "to drink" we can generate five/ شرب]
direct derived nouns like it is shown in the 

Table2 (Mejri et al, 2009). 
 

Table 2. Direct derivation of the root [شرب 

/ʃrab/]"to drink"

/ʃirri:b/ 

 َمْشَربْْ
/maʃrab/ 

 َشاِربْْ
/ʃa:rib/ 

http://wordnet.princeton.edu/


The second method is based on searching 

existing varied forms for the elements Lemma or 

wordForm created in aeb Wordnet e.g. the 

Lemma [ْْقَال /qa:l/] "says"  has a varied form [ الْْڤَْ  
/q’a:l/] used in the occidental north, the 
occidental south and the oriental south; the 

wordForm [ُْْشوف /ʃu:f /] "see" of the LexicalEntry 

 أََرى] ʃa:f /] "to see"  has a varied form/َشافْْ]

/ʔara:/] used only in Sfax. 

The third method consists on the use of an aeb 

corpus composed by aeb texts collected from 

press articles, theater pieces, poetic books, etc to 

search words absent in aeb Wordnet and to add 

them. 

With the methods presented at the top, we 

widely support aeb Wordnet potential.  

5 Conclusion 

In this article, we presented aeb Wordnet 

building using the standard ISO LMF. We 

adapted Wordnet-LMF to aeb specificities based 

on ISO-LMF and we presented aeb building 

steps with the expand approach.  

    Building aeb Wordnet consists on processing 

PWN by translation to instantiate wordnet-LMF 

extended model for aeb language. The translation 

is based on a bilingual dictionary seen the lack of 

resources. It is supported by validation and 

extension steps. In this way, we create easily aeb 

wordnet from PWN and we save aeb language 

specificities. 

    This Wordnet is basic, standard and efficient 

NLP tool. It is an elementary tool with the lack 

of aeb NLP tools. Its standard structure allows 

easy interchange with other Wordnets and 

lexicons. And its current potential i.e. 6000 aeb 

words is acceptable with the absence of aeb 

lexicons. Moreover, the extension of aeb wordnet 

allows its potential to attempt potential of other 

Wordnets even PWN potential. 

    Aeb Wordnet is a necessary tool. It will 

greatly enhance NLP of aeb and so Internet 

communication monitoring witch become a real 

challenge with the unsteadiness of economic, 

finance, politic, etc in Tunisia. Also, it will be 

very useful to wrestle against terrorism witch 

disrupt the democratic transition.
