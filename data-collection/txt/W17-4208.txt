Abstract

We address the issue of the quality of
journalism and analyze daily article revi-
sion logs from a Japanese newspaper com-
pany. The revision logs contain data that
can help reveal the requirements of quality
journalism such as the types and number
of edit operations and aspects commonly
focused in revision. This study also dis-
cusses potential applications such as qual-
ity assessment and automatic article revi-
sion as our future research directions.

1 Introduction

Quality journalism deserves serious considera-
tion, particularly given the disruptions of exist-
ing publishing companies and the emergence of
new publishing companies, citizen journalism, and
automated journalism. Although no consensus
exists for the definition of quality journalism,
Meyer (2009) describes several aspects that con-
stitute quality journalism; for example, credibility,
influence, accuracy, and readability. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to ana-
lyze the large-scale revision logs of professionals
in the field of journalism. In this study, we explore
aspects of quality journalism through analyses of
the newspaper article revision logs. More specifi-
cally, we analyze the revision processes as editors
refine the drafts written by reporters so that they
are of publication quality.

While our attempt is still in the early stages, this
paper reports the statistics of the actual revisions
made by professionals and shows the usefulness
of the revision logs. We also discuss the future di-
rections of this research, for example, the potential
to present feedback to reporters, extract guidelines
for ‘good’ articles, and develop systems for auto-
matic revision and sentence merging and spitting.

2 Analysis of revision logs

This section describes the daily activities of a
newspaper company needed to publish articles and
the analysis of the revision logs.

2.1 Flow of editing and publishing articles

A reporter drafts an article and sends it to an editor,
who has over ten years’ experience as a journalist.
The editor proofreads the article and forwards it to
a reviewers section. The reviewers in this section
fact-check the article. Finally, designers adjust the
article so that they fit in the newspaper and web-
site. In this way, a newspaper article is revised
many times from the original submission.

Figure 1 compares the text from an article writ-
ten by a reporter and the same text after it has been
revised by an editor. The editor revises the text
using insertion, deletion, and replacement. This
example also shows the operations of sentence re-
ordering and splitting.

2.2 Aligning original sentences with revised
sentences

Revision logs present two versions of an article:
the one written by a reporter (the original ver-
sion) and the final version revised by an editor
(the revised version). However, these logs do not
provide details about the editing process used to
transform the original version into the final ver-
sion (e.g., individual operations of word inser-
tion/deletion, sentence reordering). Hence, we es-
timate sentence alignments between the original
and revised versions using the maximum align-
ment method (Kajiwara and Komachi, 2016).

The accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
were 0.995, 0.996, 0.951, and 0.957, respectively,
on a dataset consisting of 50 articles in which the
correct alignments were assigned by a human.1

There may be some room for improving the per-
formance of the alignments but it is sufficient for
this analysis.

2.3 Data analysis of the revision logs

To analyze the details of the revision processes,
we inspected articles published from October
1, 2015 to September 30, 2016. We applied
MeCab (Kudo et al., 2004), a Japanese morpho-
logical analyzer, with the enhanced dictionary NE-
ologd2, to split the sentences into words (mor-
phemes) and recognize their parts-of-speech.

sentence similarity threshold, optimizing the F1 score on a
development set consisting of 150 articles. We used word
embeddings that are pre-trained by the original articles and
revised articles to compute sentence similarity.

The dataset analyzed in this study contains
120,331 articles with 1,903,645 original sentences
and 1,884,987 revised sentences. The dataset con-
sists of a Japanese newspaper’s articles3, which
have a mixed domain (genre) of the news, and
most of the articles have the same writing style.
We obtained 2,197,739 sentence pairs using the
alignment method described in Section 2.2. The
number of aligned pairs is larger than that of
the sentences because an original sentence can be
aligned to multiple sentences in the revised ver-
sion. About half of the sentence pairs (1,108,750)
were unchanged during the revision process, and
the remaining pairs (1,088,989) were changed. In
this section, we report the statistics of the edit op-
erations in the changed pairs. We found that news-
paper companies produce a huge number of sen-
tences, about half of which are revised, for analy-

If the same kind of fish is distributed in large quantities

in the market, the unit price of the fish manages to decrease.    

Revised sentence:

sis just within a year.

Figure 2 presents the distribution of the Lev-
enshtein distance between the original and re-
vised sentences. The mean of the Levenshtein
distances of the revised pairs (15.04) indicates
that the dataset includes many examples in which
drafts are deeply edited by the editors. Figure 3
is an example of the sentence pair which has the
mean of the Levenshtein distance of the dataset
(15).

Table 1 lists the number of insertions, dele-
tions, and replacements, according to the number
of words involved in the edit operations. We found
that 56.20% of the total edit operations were re-
placements for one or two words, and this fact in-
dicates that editors revised these articles with im-
pressive attention to detail.

Table 2 shows the number of edit operations
separated by different part-of-speech. The most
frequent target for revisions is nouns, followed by
particles (postpositions). This result indicates that
revisions in terms of both content and readability
are important for improving the quality of articles.

3 Future directions for quality
assessment and automatic article
revision

There are several possible future directions for the
utilization of the revision logs.

3.1 Feedbacks to reporters

We can use the revision logs for improving the
writing skills of reporters. An interesting finding
in the revision logs is that the articles of young
reporters (1–3 years’ experience) tend to be re-
vised more than those of experienced reporters
(31–33 years’ experience): the mean Levenshtein
distances of these young and experienced reporters
are 15.82 and 12.95, respectively. As exemplified
by this finding, the revision logs can indicate the
main types of revisions that a particular group of
reporters or an individual reporter receives. We
will explore the potential of the revision logs for
assessing the writing quality of a reporter and pre-
senting them with feedback.

3.2 Establishing guidelines for writing
articles

Most textbooks on Japanese writing (including
the internal handbook for reporters produced
by the newspaper company) recommend that a
Japanese sentence should be 40 to 50 characters
long (Ishioka and Kameda, 2006). We could con-
firm that the newspaper articles satisfy this crite-
rion: the revised sentences are 41.10 characters
long on average. In this way, we can analyze the
revision logs to extract various criteria for estab-
lishing the guidelines for ‘good’ articles.

3.3 Automatic article revision within
sentences

Another future direction is to build a corpus for
improving the quality of articles. The revision logs
collected for a year (excluding duplicates) provide
517,545 instances of replace operations, 79,639
instances of insertions, and 54,111 instances of
deletions that involve one or two words. Table 3
shows some instances of the replace operations.
It may not be straightforward to use the revision
logs for error correction because some edit opera-
tions add new information and remove useless in-
formation. Nevertheless, the logs record the daily
activities of how drafts are improved by the edi-
tors. In future, we plan to build an editing sys-
tem that detects errors and suggests wording while
the reporters write drafts. We can use natural lan-
guage processing techniques for these tasks be-
cause local error correction has been previously
researched (Cucerzan and Brill, 2004).

3.4 Automatic sentence merging and splitting

The alignment method found 69,891 instances of
sentence splitting (wherein an original sentence is
split into multiple sentences) and 68,550 instances
of sentence merging (wherein multiple original
sentences are merged into one sentence). Table 4
shows examples of sentence splitting and merging.
We observe some sentences are also compressed
during sentence merging and splitting. We can
use these instances as a training data for building
a model for sentence splitting and merging (with
compression), and this may be an interesting task
in the field of natural language processing.

vision logs of a newspaper company for assessing
