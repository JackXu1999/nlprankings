Abstract 

 

The synsets in Assamese Wordnet play a sig-

nificant role in the enrichment of Assamese 

language. These synsets are built depending 

on the intuition the native speakers of the lan-

guage. There is no fixed rule in the arranging 

the positions of each synset. The present paper 

mainly aims to make a quantitative compari-

son of every synset position of Wordnet seeing 

the occurrences of these synsets in corpus of 

Assamese (approximately 1.5 million words). 

The experimental result of this comparison is 

represented with the help of diagrams. Again, 

it is an attempt to highlight the timeline of 

each synsets of Wordnet based on the corpus. 

It is dealt with the change of the synonymous 

word forms in course of times. 

1 Introduction 

Language is a central feature of human identity. 

Language is the identity of that particular com-

munity. No community can survive without a 

language. The language of the communities live 

in India is very ancient and rich. Similarly, As-

samese language is also one of the ancient and 

rich languages of the north-eastern languages. 

Assamese has been regarded as a rich language 

with its own script and written literary texts since 

the ancient times. Assamese language belongs to 

the Satam group of the Indo-European language 

family. The main root of this language lies to the 

Indo-Aryan languages. 

Dr. Banikanta Kakati has classified the devel-

opment of Assamese language into three stages 

(Kakati, 2008): 

A. Early Assamese (14
th

 to 16
th

 century 

A.D.)  

This period again may be divided into a) Pre-

Vaishnavite and b) Vaishnavite sub-periods. The 

earliest known Assamese writer is Hema 

Saraswati, who wrote a small poem ‘Prahlad 

Charit’. Sankardeva, the great Vaishnavite re-

former in Assam, born in 1449 A.D. composed 

religious songs and drama. In his popularly 

known as Braja-Bali idioms (Goswami, 1983). 

B. Middle Assamese (17
th

 to 19
th

 centu-

ry A.D.)  

The main characteristic of this period is the his-

torical writings initiated under the inspiration of 

the Ahom court. These historical writings in 

prose are known as Buranjis. In the Ahom court, 

historical Chronicles were at first composed in 

their original Tibeto-Chinese languages, but 

when the Ahom rulers adopted Assamese as the 

court language, historical chronicles began to be 

written in Assamese. The language is essentially 

modern except for slight alterations in grammar 

and spelling. 



C. Modern Assamese  

The modern Assamese period begins with the 

publication of the Bible in Assamese by Ameri-

can Baptist Missionaries in the first quarter of the 

19
th
 century. The currently prevalent standard 

Asamiya has its roots in the Sibasagar dialect of 

Eastern Assam. The American Baptist Mission-

aries were the first to use this dialect in translat-

ing the Bible in 1813 A.D. In 1836 A.D., they 

started a monthly periodical called Arunodoy and 

in 1848 A.D., Nathan Brown published the first 

book on Assamese grammar. The Missionaries 

published the first Assamese-English Dictionary 

compiled by Miles Bronson in 1867 A.D. The 

Sibasagar Asamiya dialect came to be formally 

recognized as the Standard Asamiya dialect 

when it was made the official language of the 

state by the schools, courts, and Govt. officers in 

1872. This Standard language is accepted by all 

other Asamiya dialect as the standard norm and 

was used for all formal occasions – in writing, in 

the classroom, in meetings, in the courts and of-

fices and for inter-dialect communication also.     

2 Assamese Corpus 

The term ‘corpus’ is used to refer to a collection 

of linguistic data (covering spoken and written) 

in a language for some specific purposes and the-

se data are to stored, managed and analyzed in 

digital format. There is a huge amount of corpus 

in Assamese language consisting of approxi-

mately 15 or 20 lakh words based on the various 

Assamese literary or non-literary texts (such as 

magazines, newspaper, dramas, novels, stories, 

articles etc.). Words are collected from various 

texts ranging from 19
th
 to 21

st
 centuries (Sarma et 

al., 2012).  

3 Assamese Wordnet 

Wordnet is a repository of words of a language. 

Wordnet is basically a synonymous lexical data-

base. Vocabulary plays a main role in building 

Wordnet. Assamese language possesses a huge 

amount of vocabulary; it becomes easy to build 

Wordnet in the language. The task of Assamese 

Wordnet building is almost ready to provide us 

with all the lexical words. Yet there are still 

many words in the language those need to be 

entered (Sarma et al., 2010). 

Assamese Wordnet is built on the basis of 

Hindi Wordnet (Sarma et al., 2012). Here, words 

are shown according to the sense of the given 

context or sentence and accordingly, we can de-

rive different meanings from them. For example, 

the Assamese word ‘paani, and ‘farkaal’’ has 

different meaning according to its sense in the 

context. 

Paani (noun) –  

                     Paanir para bemar hoi 

                     Kaamtu paani hoi gol 

 

Farkaal (Adjective) – Bataratu bar farkaal (not 

rainy) 

 Raam farkaal monar 
maanuh 

 Khuala manar  manuh 
(Free minded) 

 Path  farkaal hoise (not 
muddy, dry) 

4 Quantitative Analysis  

The main aim of quantitative analysis is a com-

plete description. Quantitative analysis allows for 

fine distinctions to be drawn because it is not 

necessary to the data into a finite number of clas-

sifications. 

The resulting corpus contains over 1.5 billion 

words and 14958 Assamese Wordnet synset data. 

Initially, we have tried to find out the position of 

corpus and synset data. The synset category is 

classified as noun, verb, adjective and adverb for 

Assamese Wordnet. Here, we compare the fre-

quency of Wordnet synset to the frequencies of 

Corpus data.  

Some results of words position analysis in As-

samese Wordnet with Corpus are mentioned be-

low: 

 

 
 

Figure 1: Position analysis of Noun Synset 

 

In Figure 1, we have shown Synset Positions 

of Noun in Assamese Corpus. For the First posi-

tion we have found 40.89%, for the second and 

third 33.61% and 24.55% respectively and so on. 

Similarly in Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 we have 

shown Synset Positions and analysis of verb, 

adverb and adjective in Assamese Corpus. 



 Finally in Figure 5, it is clear that the finding 

of first position is always higher than the remain-

ing synset position.

5 Timeline of Words 

Wordnet has been built taking various words of 

hundred years.  There are 38 synset positions in 

Wordnet. Especially, words are found to be most 

frequently used in the synset positions like 1
st
, 

2
nd

 and 3
rd

 which cover a period from 1900 to 

1995. It is worth mentioning here that we have 

not found any synonymous words after the 

synset position 17. Most of the words starting 

from synset position no. 1 to 5 we have seen 

words have became change from the old As-

samese to modern forms. Thus, it has enriched 

the words in Assamese language. 

While studying the synset in Assamese lan-

guage, it is seen that most of the words used by 

the Christian missionaries have not been used at 

present times. It does not mean that these words 

have disappeared completely, but these are used 

less frequently with change in the forms of those 

words.  

Examples of words change in Assamese lan-

guage are mentioned below:

Conclusion 

The present paper makes an examination on the 

timeline of synset positions of Assamese 

Wordnet. In order to perform this task, mainly 

we refer to Assamese corpus covering time peri-

od from 1900 to 2008. In this corpus, there are 

more than 1.5 million texts. We consider all the 



synsets of Assamese Wordnet entered till date as 

it is in a developing stage. First we determine the 

timeline of all the corpus entries and secondly we 

map up these entries with their corresponding 

synset entries. While mapping we also consider 

the respective positions of each synset entries. 

After analysis the data, we basically found that 

from first to fifth position of synset entries are 

occurred frequently in the time period of our giv-

en corpus. But the results varied from different 

word categories those are clearly depicted in the 

above sections.
