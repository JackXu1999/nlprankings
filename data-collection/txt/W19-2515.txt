Abstract
Linguistic code-switching (C-S) is common in
oral bilingual vernacular speech. When used
in literature, C-S becomes an artistic choice
that can mirror the patterns of bilingual in-
teractions. But it can also potentially exceed
them. What are the limits of C-S? We model
features of C-S in corpora of contemporary
U.S. Spanish-English literary and conversa-
tional data to analyze why some critics view
the ‘Spanglish’ texts of Ilan Stavans as deviat-
ing from a C-S norm.

1 Introduction

Code-switching (C-S), the alternating use of lan-
guages in a single conversation, is a vernacular
practice of U.S. Spanish-English bilinguals. Lat-
inx authors use C-S in their writing for various
functions and at varying rates in addressing dif-
ferent readers. The occasional insertion of a Span-
ish word or expression into English language texts
can appeal to monolingual and bilingual readers
alike. Alternatively, the languages can co-occur in
more complex patterns that engage only the most
bilingual reader (Torres, 2007). The question then
arises: What are the limits to the stylistic choices
available to bilingual writers? To attempt to an-
swer this question, we submit extracts of ‘Span-
glish’ literature to experiments that allow us to
model the features that identify the contour of an
author’s mixing. These results are, in turn, com-
pared with naturally produced Spanish-English C-
S conversation corpora.

C-S language data complicates NLP tasks like
language identification, POS tagging, or language
modeling (Solorio and Liu, 2008b,a; Solorio et al.,
2014; Çetinoğlu et al., 2016; Barman et al., 2014;
Vilares et al., 2016; Jamatia et al., 2015; Lynn
et al., 2015; Elfardy et al., 2014; Molina et al.,
2016; Rijhwani et al., 2017). Therefore, our exper-
iments rest on language identification at the word

level, coupled with analyses of syntactic and lexi-
cal features that do not require POS tagging. Our
contributions are the following: (1) We compare
the complexity of C-S in the prose of Ilan Stavans
to that in other ‘Spanglish’ texts; (2) We introduce
a new method of normalizing the probability of C-
S in a corpus scaled according to the distribution
of languages in a corpus; (3) We extract linguistic
features of Stavans’s writing – out-of-vocabulary
items and syntactic transitions – and manually re-
view them for grammatical analysis; (4) We assess
the degree to which C-S in literature conforms to
features that are attested in speech and that are pre-
dicted by linguistic principles and constraints.

2 Related Work

Research into C-S in spontaneously-produced and
elicited spoken speech has offered insights into
the social, cognitive, and structural dimensions
of this multilingual phenomenon (Bullock and
Toribio, 2009). The analysis of C-S in written
discourse has garnered substantially less atten-
tion and, with some exceptions reviewed below
(Montes-Alcalá, 2001; Callahan, 2004, 2002), it
has centered largely on C-S in historical texts as a
genre (Latin macaronic poetry, medieval Castilian
Spanish-Hebrew taqqanots ’ordinances’, personal
letters) (Demo, 2018; Schulz and Keller, 2016;
Miller, 2001; Gardner-Chloros and Weston, 2015;
Swain et al., 2002; Nurmi and Pahta, 2004).

Spanish-English C-S is integral to the U.S.
Latino experience, and Latino authors such as
Gloria Anzaldúa and Junot Dı́az, to name but two,
have given authentic expression to this bilingual,
bicultural reality and, in so doing, have brought
legitimacy to literary C-S. The C-S crafted by Ilan
Stavans stands as a point of contrast, a Spanish-
English composite employed in rendering Span-
glish renditions of Don Quixote, Hamlet, Le Petit



116

Prince, and The United States Constitution (ex-
cerpted in Example 1 below). The creative texts
incorporate word-internal switches such as jold-
eamos, unalienables, suddenmente, which violate
the Free Morpheme Constraint (Poplack, 1980),
and tinkleada, whose phonotactic sequence of En-
glish syllabic [ë] followed by a Spanish bound
morpheme is ruled out by the PF Disjunction The-
orem (MacSwan, 2000). Stavans also employs
the switching of lone function words, flaunting
the Matrix Language Hypothesis (Myers-Scotton,
1997), which proscribes switching to a functional
element and then immediately returning to the
base language (Joshi, 1982). These properties
led Lipski to characterize Stavans’s Spanglish as
“grotesque” (Lipski, 2004) and Torres to describe
it as “unlikely” and “implausible” (Torres, 2005).

evidentes, que todos los hombres son crea-
dos equally, que están endawdeados por su

que entre these están la vida, la libertad, y

The parallel between literary and conversational
C-S with respect to syntactic structure has been in-
vestigated. Callahan (2002; 2004) analyzed a cor-
pus of 30 bilingual texts — novels and short sto-
ries published in the U.S. between 1970-2000 —
totaling 2954 pages (word count unknown), with
the goal of testing whether the Matrix Language
Frame model (MLF), developed for oral speech,
could be predictive of literary C-S. In broad terms,
the asymmetric MLF model holds that one lan-
guage provides the grammatical frame into which
other-language material is inserted. Callahan man-
ually annotated for Matrix language (ML) and

Embedded language (EL) concluding that, in gen-
eral, the C-S in the literary corpus can be ac-
counted by the principles of the MLF model.

Human judges of automatically generated C-S
have been shown to converge in their agreements
that certain syntactic switches, such as the switch-
ing between subject pronoun and verb or between
auxiliary and main verb, are dispreferred (Bhat
et al., 2016; Solorio and Liu, 2008a). These find-
ings are confirmed in linguistic research eliciting
intuitions on constructed stimuli (Toribio, 2001).
There are also observed directional effects in nat-
ural C-S, most notably with respect to the DET-N
boundary; a switch generally follows a determiner
in only one of the component languages (Joshi,
1982; Mahootian and Santorini, 1996; Blokzijl
et al., 2017; Parafita Couto and Gullberg, 2017).
In Spanish-English switches at this syntactic junc-
ture, Spanish DET is consistently followed by an
English bare noun regardless of which language is
the ML (Bullock et al., 2018).

While we know much about the grammatical
co-occurrence restrictions on intrasentential C-S,
patterns of mixing in a broader sense remain to be
explored. It is frequent to encounter claims that a
vernacular is ‘highly mixed’ or to classify mixing
according to a typology of complexity, e.g., from
insertion to alternation or congruent lexicaliza-
tion, where there is a single grammar into which
words from more than one lexicon are inserted
(Muysken, 2000). Metrics that aim to quantify C-
S complexity in order to compare between corpora
have been proposed to characterize the nature of
language mixing (Das and Gambäck, 2014; Bar-
nett et al., 2000; Gambäck and Das, 2016, 2014).
In this paper we use and expand upon the metrics
proposed by Guzmán et al. (2017), which are de-
signed to quantify patterns of switching within and
between corpora, to compare the C-S in the writ-
ings of Stavans against other literary works as well
as against conversational C-S.

3 Methods

Four short extracts of stories rendered in Span-
glish by Stavans, totaling 10,051 words, were
downloaded from the web and converted from
pdf format to text files. Additional data include
the text of two other novels recognized for their
sustained C-S: Yo-Yo Boing! by Nuyorican author
Giannina Braschi (1998) and Killer Crónicas:
Bilingual Memories by Chicana writer Susana



117

Chávez-Silverman (2004), both used by per-
mission from the authors. Data representing
natural, oral C-S include a Spanish-English
transcription of a bilingual conversation in
Texas (S7), collected and shared by Thamar
Solorio (Solorio and Liu, 2008a) and a con-
versation, maria40 (M40), extracted from the
Miami Corpus, deposited in the Bilingual Bank
(Donnelly and Deuchar, 2011). Each data set
was processed using the word-level language
identification system for Spanish-English avail-
able on github https://github.com/
Bilingual-Annotation-Task-Force/
python-tagger and described in Guzmán
et al. (2016). In post-processing, punctuation
and numbers were given the language tag of the
previous token so that they were not counted as
switches. Named Entities are tagged for Spanish
or English within the language identification
system used.

The sequence of language tags out-
put from the system is used as input
to the python script that calculates met-
rics for C-S (https://github.com/
Bilingual-Annotation-Task-Force/
Scripts/blob/master/lang_metrics.
py): the M-Index (Barnett et al., 2000), or
the ratio of languages represented in a corpus,
bound between 0 (monolingual) and 1 (perfectly
bilingual); the I-Index (Guzman et al., 2016),
the probability of switching between any two
n-grams, also bound by 0 (no switching) and 1
(switching at every token); and Burstiness (Goh
and Barabási, 2008), which provides a probability
distribution of how many tokens will appear in
a sequence in a given language before a switch
to another, bound between -1 (periodic) and 1
(aperiodic). These results of application of these
metrics to our corpora are shown in Table 1.

3.1 Normalized I-Index

One of the drawbacks of the I-Index developed by
Guzmán et al. (2016) is that it does not account for
the underlying language distribution of a text. For
example, a text with an M-Index of 0.01, i.e. a text
dominated by one language, could never achieve
an I-Index of 1 because there are insufficient to-
kens to incorporate more switching. In fact, the
only way to reach an I-Index of 1, linguistic con-
straints on switching aside, is if the M-Index were
near 1, or if the languages were almost equally dis-

tributed. As a result, values of the I-index are not
directly comparable across corpora from different
language distributions. To correct for this, we have
developed an improved version of the I-Index nor-
malized to account for these bounds. In a text of
N tokens, with k languages, each with ni tokens,
then the following equation can be used to com-
pute a normalized I-Index, which we will refer to
as I2:

I2 =
I − L
H − L

(1)

where I represents the I-index described in
(Guzman et al., 2016), and the lower and upper
bounds, L and H , respectively, are defined by the
following formulas:

L = (k − 1)/(N − 1) (2)

H = min

(
2 · (N −maxi ni)

N − 1
, 1

)
(3)

The lowest amount of switching possible, L,
outlined in Eq. 2 occurs when all ni tokens of
each language are concatenated together, leading
to k−1 switches between all monolingual chunks.
However, the highest amount of switching possi-
ble, H , which we compute in Eq. 3, occurs if we
alternate tokens from each of the languages and
intersperse them between the tokens of the most
common language. An issue that our I2 presents
is that, for a highly-skewed corpus, the difference
between the H and L values is minuscule, which
can cause numerical problems. In other words,
this metric performs poorly for corpora where the
vast majority (>95%) is in one language.

Note that our I2 scales I according to the lan-
guage distribution and allows for direct compari-
son across different corpora. An I2 of 0 or 1 now
corresponds to a text with the absolute minimum
and maximum, respectively, of switching possi-
ble given a fixed underlying language distribution.
This new metric, in a manner of speaking, controls
for a varying M-Index. In fact, as a rough estimate,
one can think of I2 as being approximately equal
to I/M , where M is the M-Index.

3.2 Results of Metrics

The three literary works (Stavans, Killer Crónicas
and Yo-Yo Boing!) are distinguished from the con-
versations (M40, S7) by the M-Index, as seen in
Table 1, indicating that the balance of languages

in these texts is more even than in the conversa-
tions, where one language predominates (English
in S7 and Spanish in M40). Within the literary cor-
pora, the Stavans subcorpora stand out as having a
higher probability of switching (I-Index) than the
others, even more than Killer Crónicas, which is
the most bilingual of all the datasets, with an M-
Index of .99. This is reflected best by the Nor-
malized I-Index, which is a valid measure of com-
parison here since none of the corpora are highly-
skewed.

The quantitative models of these corpora in-
dicate that the Stavans excerpts exhibit extreme
switching relative to the other datasets. Contrary
to prior work by Guzmán et al. (2016), the values
of I2 demonstrate that KC is not that much dif-
ferent from M40 and S7. The largest differences
observed in I and I2 are with the M40 and S7 cor-
pora due to the skewed language distributions of
the texts, which exaggerate the measurement of
the amounts of switching.

A plot representing the densities of monolingual
spans in the corpora, a visualization of Burstiness,
is shown in Figure 1, where it can be seen that lan-
guage mixing in Stavans and Killer Crónicas oc-
curs more regularly throughout the text, whereas
Yo-Yo Boing!, M40, and S7 show a long-tailed sig-
nal, indicating that C-S is a sporadic occurrence.

3.3 Lexical and Grammatical Analyses

As a second step toward modeling C-S, we com-
pared the structural profiles of the Stavans ex-
tracts to Killer Crónicas, the texts in which C-S
is the least bursty, to calculate the rate of word-
internal switching. We filtered out words using

the aspell command on Linux for English and
Spanish. The mixed words were manually se-
lected based on intra-word switching and NOT ty-
pographical errors, variable spellings (e.g., cashe
to represent the Argentine pronunciation of calle),
or non-words. We retained in our mixed-word
list cross-linguistic phoneticizations such as livin
in which English words are given a Spanish-like
phonological representation. The results are given
in Table 2 relative to the number of unique words
in the corpora. The frequency of mixed words in
Killer Crónicas is negligible relative to the propor-
tion of the unique words in Stavans that are mixed.
This difference is highly significant (χ2 = 109.26,
df = 1, p-value < 2.2e-16) with a Cramer’s-V test
of .129 indicating a small effect size.

We investigated patterns of grammatical con-
straints by searching and tagging all subject pro-
nouns and determiners in Spanish and in English
according to their lexical entries (la, the, yo, I,
etc.) and listing them alongside the word that
followed in the text. We manually reviewed the
lists of PRON + word and DET + word to elimi-
nate any errors or any cross-linguistic homographs
(e.g., Spanish he is an auxiliary verb). These were
tabulated according to the language of the token
and the language of the next word for each corpus.
The proportion tables for DET-NOUN transitions
is found in Table 3.

The asymmetry in directionality discussed
above is evident in both literary corpora; Spanish
determiners are more frequently found with En-
glish nouns than vice versa. However, Stavans
shows a much higher mixing rate at this juncture,
in general: .36 relative to .17 for Killer Crónicas:
(χ2 = 32.249, df = 1, p-value < 1.356e-08) with
a Cramer’s-V test of .199 indicating a small ef-
fect size. The results for switching at the PRON-
V juncture are shown in Table 4. While switch-
ing after a PRON is rare in Killer Crónicas, Sta-
vans switches after a subject pronoun at a rate of
about 13%, particularly if the pronoun is Spanish
(χ2 = 17.547, df = 1, p-value < 2.803e-05) with
a Cramer’s-V test of .174). These analyses in-
form us that the Stavans corpora is qualitatively
different from Killer Crónicas and distinguished
by unusual C-S within words and across tightly
knit syntactic boundaries.

4 Discussion

We have observed that literary texts present more
C-S than what is manifested in natural speech.
However, different authors manifest different pat-
terns of C-S, even when they employ more or
less the same ratio of languages in their writ-
ings. While the M-index for the Stavans and Killer
Crónicas corpora are nearly identical, demonstrat-
ing a near perfect balance of Spanish and En-
glish, with Yo-Yo Boing! close behind in terms of
balance, the texts present distinct switching pro-
files. Specifically, Stavans, whose switching is
criticized as unnatural, shows a higher probabil-
ity of alternating between the languages, quanti-
fied by the I2 and visualized as short spans of one
language followed for short spans of the other. The
C-S in Stavans also differs qualitatively from that
in Killer Crónicas, the other literary text in our
sample to show a similar anti-bursty distribution of
C-S, in the preponderance of switching within the
word (e.g., adrifteando, astonisheado, askeó, wist-
fulmente), switching at the DET-N boundary (e.g.,
the casa), and switching after PRON (él slept), all

sites that are very rarely attested junctures of mix-
ing in oral speech, and that are ruled out by pre-
dictive linguistic models.

Note that the effect of switching on functional
words, such as pronouns and determiners, while
in itself odd, will also lead to increased rates of C-
S and to short language spans. Thus, we cannot
know if it is the frequency of switching, the deci-
sion to switch after functional elements and within
words, or a combination of these features that lead
critics to characterize Stavans’s ’Spanglish’ texts
in negative terms. In future work, we seek to de-
termine whether there are expected constants of C-
S for Spangish literature versus for natural speech.
This will help determine the degree to which an
observed C-S contour is an outlier.

We have presented methods for comparing be-
tween corpora that rest on multiple features eas-
ily gleaned from small corpora, but our conclu-
sions can only be tentative. Language models that
would permit direct comparisons of the statistical
distribution of C-S between corpora would be de-
sirable for establishing the limits of mixed vernac-
ulars like so-called ‘Spanglish’.
