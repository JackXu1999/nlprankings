Abstract

We present CATENA, a sieve-based system to perform temporal and causal relation extraction and
classification from English texts, exploiting the interaction between the temporal and the causal
model. We evaluate the performance of each sieve, showing that the rule-based, the machine-
learned and the reasoning components all contribute to achieving state-of-the-art performance
on TempEval-3 and TimeBank-Dense data. Although causal relations are much sparser than
temporal ones, the architecture and the selected features are mostly suitable to serve both tasks.
The effects of the interaction between the temporal and the causal components, although limited,
yield promising results and confirm the tight connection between the temporal and the causal
dimension of texts.

1 Introduction

When the Greek government missed its 1.6 billion euro payment to the IMF as its bailout expired on 30
June 2015, people started to look for information, such as What is going on? Why did it happen and what
will happen next? A compact summary that represents the development of a story over time, highlighting
not only the temporal connections between events but also cause-effect chains, would be very beneficial
for providing information that the readers need. Besides, this kind of knowledge, derived from structured
information about events and their temporal-causal relations, could be used in a number of applications,
from tools for automated generation of timelines to question answering and decision support systems.

While temporal relation classification is a well-studied task with a number of systems participating in
the TempEval campaigns (Verhagen et al., 2010; UzZaman et al., 2013; Llorens et al., 2015), less attention
has been devoted by the NLP community to the detection of causal links between events. Although recent
attempts have tried to settle an annotation standard for causality inspired by TimeML (Mirza et al., 2014),
the interactions between the temporal and the causal dimension of texts have been scarcely explored,
especially from an empirical point of view. In this work, we face this challenge by presenting CATENA
(CAusal and TEmporal relation extraction from NAtural language texts),1 a multi-sieve architecture for
the extraction and classification of both relation types from English documents, which are pre-annotated
with temporal entities, namely events and time expressions.

2 Related Work

Our proposed approach for relation extraction is inspired by recent works on hybrid approaches for
temporal relation extraction (D’Souza and Ng, 2013; Chambers et al., 2014). D’Souza and Ng (2013)
introduce 437 hand-coded rules along with supervised classification models using lexical relation, semantic
and discourse features. CAEVO, a CAscading EVent Ordering architecture by Chambers et al. (2014),
combines rule-based and data-driven classifiers in a sieve-based architecture for temporal ordering. The
classifiers (sieves) are ordered by their individual precision, and transitive closure is applied after each
sieve to ensure consistent temporal graph.

Figure 1: System architecture of CATENA

The problem of detecting causality between events is as challenging as recognizing their temporal
order, but less analyzed from an NLP perspective. Besides, previous works have mostly focused on
specific types of event pairs and causal expressions in text (Bethard et al., 2008; Do et al., 2011; Riaz and
Girju, 2013). Several works, relying on corpus of parallel temporal and causal relations developed with
specific connectives in mind (Bethard et al., 2008), have presented analyses on the interaction between
temporal and causal relations (Bethard and Martin, 2008; Rink et al., 2010). Exploiting gold temporal
labels as features for the causal relation classifier is shown to be beneficial. Mirza et al. (2014) presented
some annotation guidelines to capture explicit causality between event pairs, inspired by TimeML. The
resulting corpus, Causal-TimeBank, is then used to build supervised classification models for extracting
causal relations (Mirza and Tonelli, 2014a). None of the above systems presents a hybrid approach in a
sieve-based architecture to deal with this task. CATENA is at present the first integrated system available
performing temporal and causal relation extraction.

3 System architecture

The CATENA system includes two main classification modules, one for temporal and the other for causal
relations between events. As shown in Figure 1, they both take as input a document annotated with the
so-called temporal entities according to TimeML guidelines (Pustejovsky et al., 2003), including the
document creation time (DCT), events and time expressions (timexes). The output is the same document
with temporal links (TLINKs) set between pairs of temporal entities, each assigned to one of the TimeML
temporal relation types, such as BEFORE, INCLUDES or SIMULTANEOUS, which denotes the temporal
ordering. The document is also annotated with causal relations (CLINKs) between event pairs.

The modules for temporal and causal relation classification rely both on a sieve-based architecture, in
which the remaining unlabelled pairs – after running a rule-based component and/or a transitive reasoner –
are fed into a supervised classifier. Although some steps can be run in parallel, the two modules interact,
based on the assumption that the notion of causality is tightly connected with the temporal dimension
and that information from one module can be used to improve or check the consistency of the other. In
particular, (i) TLINK labels for event-event (E-E) pairs, resulting from the rule-based sieve + temporal
reasoner modules, are used as features for the CLINK classifier; and (ii) CLINK labels (i.e. CLINK and
CLINK-R) are used as a post-editing method for correcting the wrong labelled event pairs by the TLINK

65



classifier. This step relies on a set of rules based on the temporal constraint of causality, i.e. (i) CLINK(e1,
e2)→ BEFORE(e1, e2) and (ii) CLINK-R(e1, e2)→ AFTER(e1, e2). The modules for temporal and causal
relation extraction are detailed in Section 4 and 5 respectively.

4 Temporal Relation Extraction System

The module for the extraction of temporal relations contains two main components, one for (i) temporal
relation identification, which is based on a set of rules, and the other for (ii) temporal relation type
classification, which is a combination of rule-based and supervised classification modules, with a temporal
reasoning component in between. The three steps for temporal relation type classification are ordered
based on their individual precisions. This mechanism allows the system to first label few links with high
precision using rules, then to infer new links through the reasoner, and finally to increase recall through
supervised classification, based on the output of the previous steps.

4.1 Temporal Relation Identification
All pairs of temporal entities satisfying one of the following rules, inspired by the TempEval-3 task
description, are considered as having temporal links (TLINKs): (i) two main events of consecutive
sentences, (ii) two events in the same sentence, (iii) an event and a timex in the same sentence, (iv) an
event and a document creation time and (v) pairs of all possible timexes (including document creation
time) linked with each other.2 These pairs are then grouped together into four different groups: timex-timex
(T-T), event-DCT (E-D), event-timex (E-T) and event-event (E-E).

4.2 Temporal Relation Type Classification
Our sieve-based architecture is inspired by CAEVO (Chambers et al., 2014), although we significantly
reduce the system complexity as follows:

• We merge all rule-based classifiers into one sieve component (rule-based sieve), and all Support
Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers in the machine-learned sieve.

• Instead of running transitive inference after each classifier, we run our temporal reasoner module on
the output of the rule-based sieve, only once.

Furthermore, we use the output of the rule-based sieve (Section 4.2.1) as features for the machine-
learned sieve (Section 4.2.3), specifically: (i) the timex-DCT link label proposed by the timex-timex rules
are used as a feature in the event-timex SVM, and (ii) the event-DCT link label proposed by the event-DCT
rules are used as a feature in the event-event SVM.

4.2.1 Temporal Rule-Based Sieve
The temporal rule-based sieve relies on specific hand-crafted rules designed for each type of temporal
entity pairs, and takes as input the entity pairs identified in the previous step.

Timex-timex Rules For timex-timex relations, we take into account temporal expressions of types DATE
and TIME, and determine the relation types based on their normalized values. For example, “7 PM tonight”
(2015-12-12T19:00) IS INCLUDED in “today” (2015-12-12).

Event-DCT Rules The rules for labelling E-D pairs are based on the tense and/or aspect of the event
word. For example, for the event mention “(had) fallen”, which is in the past tense with perfective aspect,
its relation with the DCT is labelled as BEFORE.

Event-timex Rules As for E-T pairs, we build a set of rules based on the temporal senses of some
prepositions (Litkowski and Hargraves, 2006; Litkowski, 2014).3 In particular we assign a label whenever
a temporal preposition establishes a dependency path between an event (E) and a timex (T), in which T
acts as the temporal modifier of E. For example, if T is introduced by a temporal prepositions expressing a
STARTTIME sense such as from or since, the relation is labelled as BEGUN BY.

2Note that this is not included in the enumerated possible TLINKs in the TempEval-3 task description.
3We took the list of temporal prepositions from http://www.clres.com/db/classes/ClassTemporal.php.

66



In the absence of a temporal preposition, T might simply be a temporal modifier of E, as exemplified in
“Police [confirmed] E [Friday] T that the body was found...”. In this case, we assume that the E-T label is

IS INCLUDED. Moreover, sometimes events are modified by temporal expressions marking the starting
time and ending time in a duration pattern such as ‘between TBEGIN and TEND’ or ‘from TBEGIN to/until
TEND’. We define additional rules as follows: (i) If T matches TBEGIN then E-T label is BEGUN BY, and
(ii) if T matches TEND then E-T label is ENDED BY.

Event-event Rules E-E pairs are finally labelled following two sets of rules. The first set is based on
the dependency path possibly existing between the first (e1) and the second event (e2), and the verb
information encoded in e1. For example, if e2 is the logical subject of e1 as in “...the chain reaction
[touched] e1 off by the [collapse] e2 of Lehman Brothers”, e1 and e2 are connected by an AFTER relation.

The other set of rules is taken from CAEVO, including: (i) rules for linking a reporting event and
another event syntactically dominated by the first, based on tense and aspect; and (ii) rules based on the
role played by various tenses of English verbs in conveying temporal discourse (Reichenbach, 1947).

Further details on the implemented rules for the temporal rule-based sieve can be found in Appendix A.

4.2.2 Temporal Reasoner
Based on the output of the previous sieve, we run a transitive reasoner layer, similar to CAEVO, in order
to infer new temporal links among candidate pairs. This alleviates the issue of high precision and low
recall, typical of the rule-based sieve.

An annotated TimeML document can be mapped into a constraint problem according to how TLINKs
are mapped into Allen relations (Allen, 1983). We apply the following mapping:

• < and > for BEFORE and AFTER
• o and o−1 for DURING and DURING INV
• d and d−1 for IS INCLUDED and INCLUDES
• s and s−1 for BEGINS and BEGUN BY
• f and f−1 for ENDS and ENDED BY
Once the documents are mapped into constraint problems, they are then processed by an automated

temporal reasoner for computing their deductive closure, globally reasoning on them. We rely on the
Generic Qualitative Reasoner (GQR) (Westphal et al., 2010), a fast solver for generic qualitative constraint
problems, such as Allen constraint problems. The rationale of preferring GQR to other solutions, such as
fast Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT) solvers, is due to its scalability, simplicity of use and efficient
performances (Westphal and Wölfl, 2009).

4.2.3 Temporal Supervised Classifiers
We build three supervised classification models, one for event-DCT (E-D), one for event-timex (E-T)
and one for event-event (E-E) pairs. We use LIBLINEAR (Fan et al., 2008) L2-loss linear SVM (default
parameters), and one-vs-rest strategy for multi-class classification.

Tools and Resources Several external tools and resources are used to extract features from each
temporal entity pair, including:

• MorphoPro (Pianta et al., 2008), to get PoS tags and phrase chunk for each token.
• Mate tools (Bjorkelund et al., 2010) to extract the dependency path between words.
• WordNet similarity module4 to compute semantic similarity (Lin, 1998) between words.
• Temporal signal lists from Mirza and Tonelli (2014b), further expanded using the Paraphrase Database

(Ganitkevitch et al., 2013), and manually clustered e.g. {before, prior to, in advance of}.
Feature Set We implemented a set of features, listed in Table 1, largely inspired by the best performing
systems in TempEval-2 (Verhagen et al., 2010) and TempEval-3 (UzZaman et al., 2013) campaigns. We
simplified the possible values of some features as follows:

• dependencyPath We only consider a dependency path between an event pair if it describes coordina-
tion, subordination, subject or object relation.
• signalTokens Given a temporal signal, we do not include in the feature set the token but the clusterID

of the cluster containing synonymous signals, e.g. {before, prior to, in advance of}.
• wnSim The value of WordNet similarity measure is discretized as follows: sim ≤ 0.0, 0.0 < sim ≤

0.5, 0.5 < sim ≤ 1.0 and sim > 1.0.
We exclude lexical features such as token/lemma of temporal entities from the feature set in order to
increase the classifiers’ robustness in dealing with completely new texts with different vocabularies.
Instead, we include WordNet similarity in the feature set to capture the semantic relations between event
words.

Label Simplification For training the classification models, we only consider 10 out of the 14 relation
types defined in TimeML by collapsing some types, i.e., IBEFORE into BEFORE, IAFTER into AFTER,
DURING and DURING INV into SIMULTANEOUS, due to the sparse annotation of such labels in the datasets.

5 Causal Relation Extraction System

We propose the same hybrid approach combining rule-based and supervised classifiers for the identification
of causal relations. However, while temporal order has a clear formalization in the NLP community,
capturing causal relationships in natural language text is more challenging, for they can be expressed
by different syntactic and semantic features and involve both situation-specific information and world
knowledge. We adopt the notion of causality proposed in the annotation guidelines of the Causal-
TimeBank (Mirza et al., 2014; Mirza and Tonelli, 2014a), which accounts for CAUSE, ENABLE and

5The order of e1 and e2 in E-E pairs is always according to the appearance order in the text, while in E-T pairs, e2 is always
a timex regardless of the appearance order.

68



PREVENT phenomena (Wolff, 2007; Wolff and Song, 2003) that are overtly expressed in text. In particular,
we aim at assigning a causal link to pairs of events when: (i) the causal relation is expressed by affect,
link and causative verbs (CAUSE-, ENABLE- and PREVENT-type verbs), hereinafter simply addressed as
causal verbs; or (ii) the causal relation is marked by a causal signal (see e.g. footnote 6).

The two cases require different algorithms: while causal constructions containing causal verbs are
quite straightforward to identify, causal signals are very ambiguous and can appear in different syntactic
constructions.6 Therefore, we tackle the first through a rule-based approach, while the second is best
covered via supervision, taking advantage of the freely available Causal-TimeBank.

5.1 Causal Relation Identification

Similar to the temporal processing module, the first step towards causal relation classification is the
identification of candidate event pairs. Given a document already annotated with events, we take into
account every possible combination of events in a sentence in a forward manner as candidate event pairs.
For example, if we have a sentence “e1, triggered by e2, cause them to e3,” the candidate event pairs are
(e1,e2), (e1,e3) and (e2,e3). We also include as candidate event pairs the combination of each event in a
sentence with events in the following one, to account for inter-sentential causality, under the simplifying
assumption that causality may be expressed also between events in two consecutive sentences.

5.2 Causal Rule-Based Sieve

In the rule-based sieve, we classify causal constructions containing causal verbs. These show strong
regularities: given a causal verb v, the first event e1 is usually the subject of v and the second event e2 is
either the object or the predicative complement of v. Such relations between events and causal verbs are
usually syntactically expressed, therefore our rules aim at identifying pairs of events being related to a
causal verb in a causal construction by looking at their dependency paths.

We take the list of 56 affect, link and causative verbs presented in Mirza et al. (2014) as the causal verb
list. We further expand the list using the Paraphrase Database (Ganitkevitch et al., 2013) and original
verbs as seeds, resulting in a total of 97 verbs. We then manually cluster the causal verbs sharing the
same syntactic behaviour in groups and define a set of rules for each verb group, taking into account the
possible existing dependency paths between v and e1/e2, as well as the causal direction sense7 conveyed
in v. Further details on the implemented rules for the causal rule-based sieve can be found in Appendix B.

5.3 Causal Supervised Classifier

In order to recognize and determine the causal direction of CLINKs that are signalled by a causal signal,
we adopt a supervised approach. We build a classification model using LIBLINEAR (Fan et al., 2008)
L2-loss linear SVM (default parameters), and one-vs-rest strategy for multi-class classification. The
classifier has to label an event pair (e1, e2) with CLINK, CLINK-R or O for others.

We take as candidate event pairs only those in which the causal signal is connected via dependency path
to either e1 or e2, or both. Besides, we exclude event pairs where the two events are directly connected
through relations such as subject, object, coordinating or locative adverbial, because a causal relation
usually does not hold in these cases.

Tools and Resources The same external tools and resources mentioned in Section 4.2.3 for building
the temporal classifiers are used to extract features from each event pair. Additionally, we take the list
of causal signals from the annotation guidelines presented in Mirza et al. (2014) as the causal signal
list. Again we expand the list using the Paraphrase Database (Ganitkevitch et al., 2013), resulting in a
total of 200 signals. We also manually cluster some signals together, e.g. {therefore, thereby, hence,
consequently}, as we did for temporal signals.

6“The building [collapsed] T because of the [earthquake] S” vs “Because of the [earthquake] S the building [collapsed] T”.
S and T denote the source (cause) and target (effect) of the causal relation.

7For example, result in and result from have different senses affecting the causal direction, i.e. the causing event is the subject
of result in and the object of result from.

69



Feature Set The implemented features are listed in Table 1. As shown in Figure 1, the event-event
labels added by the rule-based sieve and the reasoner in the temporal relation extraction module are also
used as features for the CLINK classifier.

6 Evaluation

The purpose of the evaluation is two-fold: (i) to evaluate the quality of extracted temporal and causal links
separately; and (ii) to investigate the interaction between temporal and causal relation extraction systems
in the integrated architecture.

6.1 Temporal and Causal Relation evaluation
We perform two evaluations, one following TempEval-3 and the other TimeBank-Dense evaluation
methodology.

Dataset For the evaluation of the temporal relation extraction module following TempEval-3, we use
the same training and test data released for the shared task,8 i.e. TBAQ-cleaned (cleaned and improved
version of the TimeBank 1.2 and the AQUAINT corpora) and TempEval-3-platinum, respectively. The
TimeBank 1.2 corpus contains 183 documents coming from a variety of news report, specifically from the
ACE program and PropBank, while the AQUAINT corpus contains 73 news report documents and often
referred to as the Opinion corpus. The TempEval-3-platinum corpus, containing 20 news articles, was
annotated/reviewed by the TempEval-3 organizers.

The TimeBank-Dense corpus (Chambers et al., 2014) is created to address the sparsity issue in the
existing TimeML corpora. The resulting corpus contains 12,715 temporal relations over 36 documents
taken from TimeBank 1.2. For the TimeBank-Dense evaluation, we follow the experimental setup in
Chambers et al. (2014), in which the TimeBank-Dense corpus is split into a 22 document training set, a 5
document development set and a 9 document test set.9

To evaluate the causal relation extraction module, we use the Causal-TimeBank corpus10 (Mirza and
Tonelli, 2014a) for training. For TimeBank-Dense evaluation, the test set is a subset of TimeBank, so
we exclude the 9 test documents from Causal-TimeBank during training. For TempEval-3 evaluation,
we manually annotated 20 TempEval-3-platinum documents with causal links following the annotation
guidelines of the Causal-TimeBank.11 Causal relations are much sparser than temporal ones, and we
found only 26 CLINKs.

Label Adjustment Since the set of TLINK types used in the TimeBank-Dense corpus is slightly different
from the one used in TempEval-3,12 we map the relation types of TLINKs labelled by the rule-based sieve
of CATENA (Section 4.2.1) as follows: (i) BEGINS, ENDED BY→ BEFORE, (ii) BEGUN BY, ENDS→
AFTER, and (iii) DURING, IDENTITY → SIMULTANEOUS. The set of labels for the TLINK classifiers
(Section 4.2.3) is also adjusted accordingly following the labels in the TimeBank-Dense training data.

Evaluation Results In Table 2, we compare the performance of CATENA with the two best-performing
systems participating in the Task C of TempEval-3 (relation annotation given gold entities) and Task C

‘relation type only’ (relation annotation given gold entities and related pairs). We also compare the results
on the second task with the results of Laokulrat et al. (2015), who recently presented a state-of-the-art
system for relation classification based on timegraphs and stacked learning. In CATENA, Task C ‘relation
type only’ is performed by disabling the module for identifying temporal links described in Section 4.1.

The evaluation shows that CATENA is the best performing system in both tasks, even if in Task C
best precision and best recall are yielded by Bethard (2013) and Laokulrat et al. (2013), respectively.
The recall drop (from .613 to .595) in Task C is because we remove the timex-timex pairs from the final

12Some relation types are not used, and the VAGUE relation introduced in the first TempEval task (Verhagen et al., 2007) is

adopted to cope with ambiguous temporal relations, or to indicate pairs for which no clear temporal relation exists. The final set
of TLINK types in TimeBank-Dense includes: BEFORE, AFTER, INCLUDES, IS INCLUDED, SIMULTANEOUS and VAGUE.

annotated documents in order to avoid a relevant decrease in precision, since only very few of such pairs
are annotated in the gold standard. The significant drop in precision shows the difficulty in matching
annotators’ decision to set TLINKs between entity pairs, although CATENA implements the instructions
they had to follow in the annotation guidelines.

We also report in Table 2 the performance of CATENA in the TimeBank-Dense evaluation and compare
it with CAEVO. We report only F1-score, since all possible links are labelled, yielding the same P and R
values. We achieve a small improvement in the overall F1-score, i.e., .511 vs .507. If we consider the
different entity pairs, CATENA performs best on timex-timex and event-timex relations, while CAEVO
still achieves the best results on event-DCT and event-event pairs. One of the possible reasons for that is
the lack of rules in CATENA to classify VAGUE TLINKs between E-E pairs, a relation type present only in
TimeBank-Dense.

In order to measure the contribution of each component to the overall performance of CATENA, we
also evaluate the performance of each sieve both in the temporal and in the causal module. Results are
reported in Table 3, evaluated on both TempEval-3 and TimeBank-Dense test data. As expected, running
a transitive closure module after the temporal rule-based sieve (RB + TR) results in improving recall, but
the overall performance is still lacking (less than .30 F1-score).

Combining rule-based and machine-learned sieves (RB + ML) yields a slight improvement compared
with enabling only the machine-learned sieve in the system (ML). Introducing the temporal reasoner
module between the two sieves (RB + TR + ML) proves to be even more beneficial. This is especially
evident in the TimeBank-Dense evaluation. The same phenomena are also observed by CAEVO; Table 3
(right) shows the related numbers reported in Chambers et al. (2014). Note that in CAEVO, the machine-
learned sieves are not the last sieves, instead, the AllVague sieve is finally activated to label all remaining
unlabelled pairs as VAGUE.

For causal relation extraction, the combination of rule-based and machine-learned sieves (RB + ML)
achieves .622 F1-score in TempEval-3 evaluation, with the ML component contributing to increase

the recall of the highly precise RB component. The low precision of the ML module is mostly due to
dependency parsing mistakes and issues in disambiguating signals such as from, as in “...passenger cars
in China was on track to hit [400 million] T by 2030, up from [90 million] S now.” Unfortunately, from
the total of 5 gold CLINKs in the 20 documents of the TimeBank-Dense test set, none is identified by
CATENA.

6.2 Interaction between Temporal and Causal Relations
As shown in Figure 1, E-E labels returned by the temporal reasoner are used by the CLINK classifier
as features, whose causal relations are then used to post-edit TLINK labels. We evaluate the impact of
the first step through an ablation test, by removing TLINK types from the features used by the CLINK
classifier. We only analyse the results of TempEval-3 evaluation, since there are no causal links recognized
in the TimeBank-Dense test corpus. Without TLINK types, the F1-score drops from .622 to .571, with
a significant recall drop from .538 to .462. This shows that temporal information is beneficial to the
classification of causal relations between events, especially in terms of recall.

As for the evaluation of TLINK post-editing using CLINKs, the system identifies 19 causal links in
the test set, which are passed to the temporal module. While 15 of them are already consistent with
BEFORE/AFTER labels, 3 would add new correct TLINKs that are currently not annotated in the evaluation
corpus, and were wrongly labelled by the temporal module of CATENA, as shown in Table 4. The
fourth would add a BEFORE relation between cloaked and coughing in “A haze akin to volcanic fumes
[cloaked] S the capital, causing convulsive [coughing] T ...”. This relation is labelled as INCLUDES in the
gold standard, but we believe that BEFORE would be correct as well.

7 Conclusions

We presented CATENA, a hybrid system for the extraction and classification of temporal and causal
relations in text, which we make freely available to the research community. We adopt a sieve-based
architecture both for the temporal and the causal module, integrating rule-based and machine learning
components. The two modules were evaluated separately, showing that they achieve state-of-the-art
performance on different tasks. Furthermore, the interaction between temporal and causal components,
especially the benefits of passing information from one module to the other, was also analysed.

The system relies on the notion of events as defined in the TimeML standard, making it possible to
easily put temporal and causal information in relation. Although the interplay between causality and
temporality may seem obvious from a theoretical point of view, CATENA allows a systematic study
and a quantification of this phenomenon. The presented approach would probably have more impact if
implicit causality was also considered, which we did not take into account because it is not annotated in
the Causal-TimeBank corpus. However, we plan to investigate this issue in the near future.
