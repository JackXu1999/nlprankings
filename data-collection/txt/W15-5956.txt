Abstract 

Pause plays important roles for the intelligibil-
ity, naturalness and fluency of speech. This 
paper reported the effect of native (L1) Ben-
gali speakers’ fluency of English on occur-
rence probability and duration of sentence-
medial pauses with respect to three factors: 
phrase type, phrase length (l), distance (d). In 
this analysis, 40 nonnative (L2) English (L1 
Bengali) speakers’ data was divided into five 
different groups (poor, average, good, very 
good and excellent) based on their English 
fluency level. From result of this comparative 
study, it is seen that occurrence probability 
and duration of sentence-medial pauses for 
each phrase type, each l value and each d val-
ue increase as L2 English speakers’ fluency 
decreases. Moreover like L1 English speakers, 
occurrence probability and duration of sen-
tence-medial pauses are almost linearly de-
pendent on l and d respectively for L2 English 
speakers regardless of their fluency. Further-
more effect of three factors on sentence-
medial pauses of fluent L2 English speakers is 
more close to that of L1 English speakers 
compared to less fluent L2 English speakers. 

1 Introduction 

English is used as a language for international 
communication throughout the world today. Eng-
lish is also being studied and spoken as a second 
language in more countries than ever before. Thus, 
a comprehensive understanding of variations 

present in the dialects of English spoken in the 
world today is a fundamental issue for the devel-
opment of English language education as well as 
spoken language science and technology. Asia is 
home to the largest number of English learners and 
speakers in the world (Nunan, 2003), and it is im-
portant to learn about Asian language speakers’ 
English and identify their features. In India, com-
bining native (L1) and nonnative (L2) speakers, 
more people speak or understand English than any 
other country in the world (Visceglia et al., 2009). 
Thus research on spoken English of Indian speak-
ers from a multidisciplinary perspective is urgently 
needed. Therefore it is necessary to collect L2 
English speech from as many regions of India as 
possible and compare with L1 English speech 
based on segmental and supra segmental aspects in 
order to derive a set of core properties common to 
all varieties of English spoken by Indian speakers 
(Miller,1978). From the theory of second language 
acquisition, it is suggested that proper acquisition 
involves in correct production and perception of 
phonetic and prosodic features of English. One of 
the most important suprasegmental features in 
English is pause (Meng et al., 2009), where proper 
positioning of pauses in speech of second language 
is necessary for the L2 speaker to understand in 
order to acquire the proficiency on that language. 

During the act of generating spontaneous 
speech, pause is a highly variable phenomenon and 
is an outcome of processing activity (Fant et al., 
2003). The pauses occur in speech generally at 
syntactic boundaries. Pauses in text reading (rea-
dout speech) can be divided into three categories: 

403



 

(1) pauses between paragraphs, (2) pauses between 
sentences in a paragraph, (3) pauses within a sen-
tence (sentence-medial pauses). The occurrence of 
pauses is unconditional at sentence boundaries and 
paragraph boundaries, but is conditional at minor 
syntactic boundaries within sentences such as 
phrase boundaries, word boundaries (Fujisaki and 
Omura, 1971). Since sentence medial pause is 
conditional and based on syntactic structure of the 
text, so the aim of the current study is limited to 
the prediction of sentence medial pauses in English 
readout speech without specific foci and emotions. 
Their duration tends to be longer at the end of larg-
er syntactic units, but have statistical variations. A 
speaker may choose to insert a pause at a location 
necessary to disambiguate a syntactic ambiguity, 
or if the preceding uninterrupted sentence segment 
is too long, or if he/she is simply out of breath. For 
instance, if there is no pause or if the pauses in a 
sentence are wrongly placed, then the meaning of 
the sentence will change. Control of pause occur-
rence and duration is an important issue for natu-
ralness and correct meaning of the sentence.  

There are few studies on analysis of occurrence 
probability and duration of sentence-medial pauses 
in readout speech. Fujisaki et al. (1999) investi-
gated the occurrence probability and duration of 
sentence-medial pauses in Japanese readout 
speech. The results of this investigation showed 
that the occurrence probability and duration of sen-
tence-medial pauses in Japanese readout speech 
increase almost linearly with phrase length and 
distance. Das Mandal et al. (2010) analyzed sen-
tence-medial pauses for Bangla readout speech. 
This analysis also showed that occurrence proba-
bility and duration of sentence-medial pauses in 
Bengali readout speech are linearly dependent on 
phrase length and distance. In a study, Acharya and 
Das Mandal (2012) conducted a detailed investiga-
tion for sentence-medial pauses for readout speech 
of Bangla for different speech rates. The results of 
this study revealed that occurrence probability and 
duration of sentence-medial pauses in Bengali rea-
dout speech are linearly dependent on phrase 
length and distance in case of all speech rates; that 
means occurrence probability and duration of 
pause in case of fast speech is much lesser than the 
normal and slow. Moreover Saha and Das Mandal 
(2013) performed a comparative study of occur-
rence probability and duration of sentence-medial 
pauses in English readout speech between L1 

American English and L1 Bengali speakers and 
reported that, although the occurrence probability 
and duration of sentence-medial pause are linearly 
dependent on phrase length and distance for both 
speaker groups, but the occurrence probability and 
duration of sentence-medial pause of L1 Bengali 
speakers are much higher than L1 English speak-
ers. The results from these previous studies support 
the view that one of the key issues for speech pros-
ody is control of pause occurrence and duration; 
that means occurrence probability and duration 
play important roles in prediction of intra-
sentential pause insertion in readout speech. It is 
necessary for a speaker to put pauses at appropriate 
place in order to get the fluency on target language. 
Pause controls the fluency of speakers on a lan-
guage, where fluency is defined as a level of lan-
guage proficiency and depends on naturalness, 
intelligibility, accent placement, lexical stress, 
segmental correctness (Kondo and Tsubaki, 2012). 
But there is no such significant study on effect of 
L2 speakers' fluency over pause occurrence and 
duration. This paper deals with that issue. The ob-
jective of present study is to analyze the effect of 
L1 Bengali speakers’ fluency of English on occur-
rence probability and duration of sentence-medial 
pauses in English readout speech compared to L1 
English speakers. 

2 Speech Material  

The material used for the present study was the 
Aesop’s fable “The North Wind and the Sun”, 
which produces a large range of segmental and 
suprasegmental characteristics in English (Mondo-
nedo, 1999). The material was read by 10 (5 male, 
5 female) L1 American English speakers and 40 
(20 male, 20 female) L1 Bengali speakers whose 
native language was Standard Colloquial Bengali 
(SCB) (Bhattacharya, 1988). All speakers were in 
the age group between 20 to 40 years and L1 Ben-
gali speakers had studied English as a second lan-
guage for a minimum of ten years. In order to let 
the speakers decided where and how long they in-
serted pause, sentence-medial punctuation marks 
were removed from the text. The speech was rec-
orded in quiet room with 16 bit16 kHz digitization 
format. Pauses were detected and their duration 
was measured manually. To examine the effect of 
fluency of English on occurrence probability and 
duration of sentence-medial pauses in English rea-

404



 

dout speech, 40 L1 Bengali speakers’ data was di-
vided into five fluency groups. 10 English teachers 
evaluated 40 L1 Bengali speakers’ English fluency 
level on a 5-point MOS scale based on naturalness, 
accent placement, lexical stress and segmental cor-
rectness. Figure 1 shows the distribution of average 
MOS score of the 40 L1 Bengali speakers’ English 
fluency level. Average scores were grouped as 
follows: 1.5-2.49 (Poor), 2.5-3.2 (Average), 3.21-
3.59 (Good), 3.6-4.19 (Very Good), 4.2-5 
(Excellent). It is observed that the English fluency 
level of the majority of speakers was evenly distri-
buted between 3 and 4.5.

Bengali speakers’ English fluency. 

3 Factors Affecting the Occurrence and 
Duration of Sentence-Medial Pauses  

Based on previous studies (Fujisaki et al., 1999; 
Das Mandal et al., 2010; Acharya and Das Mandal, 
2012; Saha and Das Mandal, 2013), it is noted that 
the occurrence and duration of sentence-medial 
pauses in English mainly depends on the following 
three factors:  

3.1    Phrase Type  

In English, phrases are categorized into noun 
phrase (NP), verb phrase (VP), adjective phrase 
(AJP), adverb phrase (ADVP), prepositional 
phrase (PP) and conjunction phrase (CP). These 
types of phrases were considered in current study 
except prepositional phrase (PP), because there 
was only one prepositional phrase in the training 
corpus and it was at sentence final position. 

3.2    Phrase Length 

Phrase length is the length l of the phrase in terms 
of number of syllables. The phrase length is cumu-

lative if a pause does not occur at the end of the 
phrase. Figure 2 defines the cumulative phrase 
length. 
S: ph1 (no pause) ph2 (no pause)  ph3 (pause)  ph4 (end)  
              l1                             l2                      l3                      l4 

   
                                     lc3    

Figure 2. Illustration of the cumulative phrase length. 

In Figure 2, Phi represents the ith phrase of the 
sentence S and li represents the length of the cor-
responding phrase. So the cumulative length will be 
sum of the length of ph1, ph2 and ph3, i.e. lc3=l1 + l2 
+ l3 if a pause occurs after ph3.  

3.3     Distance between the Current Phrase and 
its Dependent Counter Part  

A dependency is an asymmetrical syntactic relation 
between a pair of constituents in a sentence known 
as the head and the dependent; the head of each 
dependency is then the dependent of another con-
stituent, forming a recursive structure which con-
nects the entire sentence. A constituent is right 
branching if it is to the right of the external head to 
which it connects; left branching if it is to the left. 
English is mainly right branching, but has left 
branching structure in certain situation. In English, 
major constituent types (NP, ADVP, PP, CP) are 
dependent on verb phrase (VP), that means English 
is mainly verb dependent language (Temperley, 
2007). Adjective phrase (AJP) and prepositional 
phrase (PP) are dependent on noun phrase (NP) 
also. The distance d between the current phrase 
and its dependent phrase is the number of words 
between head of the current phrase and head of its 
dependent phrase (Temperley, 2005). For the ex-
traction of the parameter d, the text is manually 
tagged with Parts of Speech (POS) and phrase in-
formation. Figure 3 illustrates the calculation of d 
for a given English sentence.

4     Results and Discussions 
 
4.1     Effect of Fluency upon Pause Occurrence    

Probability 
 
For each of the five phrase types (NP, VP, AJP, 
ADVP, CP), the pause occurrence probability is 
defined as the number of phrase boundaries which 
are followed by a pause divided by the total num-
ber of phrase boundaries having a given set of val-
ues of l and d. In this section, the effect of L2 
English (L1 Bengali) speakers’ fluency on occur-
rence probability of sentence-medial pause was 
examined with respect to each individual factor: 
phrase type, phrase length (l), distance (d). In order 
to examine the effect of fluency on occurrence 
probability of sentence-medial pause, one way 
ANOVA was performed with fluency as between 
group variable for each individual factor (phrase 
type, l, and d). After that, a series of bonferroni 
corrected post-hoc t-test was performed to deter-
mine which L2 English speaker groups differ sig-
nificantly from each other for each individual 
factor, where bonferroni corrected p value was 
0.04.  

Phrase Type:  Figure 4 shows the average oc-
currence probability of sentence-medial pauses of 
L1 and five L2 English speaker groups for differ-
ent phrase types. The result of one way ANOVA 
(fluency as a between group variable) over five 
groups of L2 English speakers for each phrase type 
was shown in Table 1. The result of one way 
ANOVA shows that, there was a statistically sig-
nificant effect (p < 0.05) of L2 English speakers’ 
fluency for each phrase type. 

 
Figure 4. Effect of phrase type upon occurrence prob-

ability of sentence medial pauses at different 
fluency level.   

Table 1:  The result of one way ANOVA for each 
phrase type. 

In case of NP, Bonferroni corrected post-hoc t-
test revealed that there were statistically significant 
differences (p < 0.04) in occurrence probability 
between every pair of L2 English speaker groups; 
only exception was pair of average and good L2 
English speaker groups, where no statistical signif-
icant difference exist (p > 0.04); that means occur-
rence probability after NP for average and good L2 
English speaker groups was almost equal. In case 
of VP, AJP and CP, Bonferroni corrected post-hoc 
t-test revealed that there were statistically signifi-
cant differences (p < 0.04) in occurrence probabili-
ty between every pair of L2 English speaker 
groups after VP, AJP and CP. For ADVP, Bonfer-
roni corrected post-hoc t-test revealed that there 
were statistically significant differences (p < 0.04) 
in occurrence probability after ADVP between 
every pair of L2 English speaker groups except 
pair of very good and excellent L2 English speaker 
group (p > 0.04); that means occurrence probabili-
ty after ADVP for very good and excellent L2 
English speaker groups was almost equal. These 
findings and Figure 4 imply that occurrence proba-
bility of sentence-medial pause after each phrase 
was decreased as fluency of L2 English speakers 
was increased. In addition, a series of t-test was 
carried out to determine which group of L2 English 
speakers differed significantly from the L1 English 
speaker group for each phrase type. Result of t-test 
revealed that every group except excellent L2 Eng-
lish speaker group was differed significantly (p < 
0.05) from L1 English speakers for each phrase 
type. From this result and Figure 4, it is observed 
that each L2 English speaker group, except excel-
lent L2 English speaker group, produced more sen-
tence-medial pause after each phrase compared to 
that of L1 English speakers; but probability of ex-
cellent L2 English speaker group to insert pause 
after each phrase was almost equal with L1 English 
speakers. From this result of analysis, it is revealed 
that occurrence probability of sentence-medial

pause after each phrase type for fluent L2 English 
speakers was lower than that of less fluent L2 Eng-
lish speakers, and occurrence probability of sen-
tence-medial pause for each phrase type was 
almost equal for both L1 English speakers and ex-
cellent L2 English speaker groups. 

Phrase Length (l): Figure 5 shows the average 
occurrence probability of sentence-medial pauses 
of L1 and five L2 English speaker groups for dif-
ferent phrase length (l).

4 F(4,35) = 4.8442,    p = 0.0032, p < 0.05

Table 2:  The result of one way ANOVA for each 
phrase length (l). 

The result indicates that there was a significant 
effect (p < 0.05) of fluency on occurrence proba-
bility of sentence-medial pause for each l. Bonfer-
roni corrected post-hoc t-tests revealed that there 
were statistically significant differences (p < 0.04) 
in occurrence probability of sentence-medial pause 
between every pair of L2 English speaker groups 
for each level of l. From these results and Figure 5, 
it is observed that occurrence probability of sen-
tence-medial pause was decreased as fluency level 
of L2 English speakers was increased for each l 
value. 

Furthermore, one way ANOVA was performed on 
each L2 English speaker group with l as between 
group variable. Table 3 shows result of ANOVA 
for each L2 English speaker group.

Excellent F(4,30) = 9.8869,p=0.00092,p<0.05 

Table 3:  The result of one way ANOVA for each L2 
English speaker group. 

The result from Table 3 indicates that there was 
significant effect (p < 0.05) of l on occurrence 
probability of sentence-medial pause for each L2 
English speaker group. Post-hoc tests using Tu-
key’s HSD procedure were performed to determine 
which phrase length (l) type differs significantly 
from each other for each L2 English speaker 
group. Tukey’s HSD procedure revealed that mean 
difference between every pair of l was statistically 
significant (mean difference > HSD value, p < 
0.05) for each L2 English speaker group. From this 
result and Figure 5, it is observed that mean occur-
rence probability of sentence-medial pause for 
each L2 English speaker group was almost linearly 
dependent on l like L1 English speakers and prob-
ability to insert pause was maximum (1.0) after 
phrases with length five or more for each L2 Eng-
lish speaker group. 

Distance (d) between Current Phrase and its 
Dependent Counter Part: Figure 6 shows the av-
erage occurrence probability of sentence-medial 
pauses of L1 and five L2 English speaker groups 
for different d. Table 4 shows the result of one way 
ANOVA (fluency as a between group variable) 
over five groups of L2 English speakers for each d 
(except distance 7).  

The result indicates that there was significant ef-
fect (p < 0.05) of fluency on occurrence probability 
of sentence-medial pause for each d. Series of 
Bonferroni corrected post-hoc t-test revealed that 
there were statistically significant differences (p < 
0.04) between every pair of L2 English speaker 
groups for each d. From these results and Figure 6, 
it is observed that occurrence probability of sen-
tence-medial pause for fluent L2 English speakers 

407



 

was lower than that of less fluent L2 English 
speakers for each d.

Table 5:  The result of one way ANOVA for each L2

The result indicates that there was significant ef-
fect (p < 0.05) of d on duration of sentence-medial 
pause for each L2 English speaker group. Post-hoc 
tests using Tukey’s HSD procedure were per-
formed to determine which distance (d) type dif-
fers significantly from each other for each L2 
English speaker group. The result of series of Tu-
key’s HSD procedure revealed that group mean 

difference between every pair of d was statistically 
significant (mean difference > HSD value, p < 
0.05) for each L2 English speaker group. From this 
result and Figure 6, it is observed that mean occur-
rence probability of sentence-medial pause for 
each L2 English speaker group was almost linearly 
dependent on d like L1 English speakers. It is seen 
from Figure 6 that probability to insert pause was 
maximum (1.0) after phrases with d seven or more 
for each L2 English speaker group.  

4.2    Effect of Fluency upon Pause Duration 

For each of the five phrase types (NP, VP, AJP, 
ADVP, CP), the pause duration is defined as the 
amount of pause measured in millisecond (ms) at 
the phrase boundary. In this section, effect of L2 
English (L1 Bengali) speakers’ fluency on duration 
of sentence-medial pause was examined with re-
spect to each individual factor (phrase type, l, d). 
For each factor, one way ANOVA was performed 
with fluency as between group variable to find out 
effect of fluency on pause duration. After that, a 
series of bonferroni corrected post-hoc t-test was 
performed to determine which L2 English speaker 
groups differ significantly from each other for each 
individual factor, where bonferroni corrected p 
value was 0.04. 

Phrase Type: Figure 7 shows the average dura-
tion of sentence-medial pauses of L1 and five L2 
English speaker groups for different phrase types.  

 

Figure  7.    Effect of phrase type upon duration of sen-
tence medial pauses at different fluency 
level. 

The result of one way ANOVA (fluency as a be-
tween group variable) over five groups of L2 Eng-
lish speakers for each phrase type was shown in 
Table 6. The result shows that, there was a statisti-
cally significant effect (p < 0.05) of fluency for 
each phrase type.

Table 6:  The result of one way ANOVA for each 
phrase type. 

In case of NP and VP, there were statistically 
significant differences (p < 0.04) in pause duration 
between every pair of L2 English speaker groups, 
except good-very good, good-excellent, very good-
excellent pairs where no statistical significant dif-
ference exist (p > 0.04). This finding and Figure 7 
imply that duration of sentence-medial pause after 
phrase NP and VP was almost equal for good, very 
good, excellent L2 English speaker groups; other-
wise duration of sentence-medial pause after 
phrase NP and VP was decreased as fluency of L2 
English speakers was increased. In case of AJP, 
there were statistically significant differences (p < 
0.04) in occurrence probability between every pair 
of L2 English speaker groups except poor-average 
pair. This finding and Figure 7 reveal that duration 
of sentence-medial pause after phrase AJP was 
almost equal for poor and average L2 English 
speaker groups; on an average duration of sen-
tence-medial pause after phrase AJP was decreased 
as fluency of L2 English speakers was increased. 
For ADVP, bonferroni corrected post-hoc t-test 
revealed that there were statistically significant 
differences (p < 0.04) in pause duration between 
every pair of L2 English speaker groups except 
pair of very good and excellent L2 group (p > 
0.04); that means pause duration after ADVP for 
very good and excellent L2 English speaker groups 
was almost equal. This finding and Figure 7 imply 
that duration of sentence-medial pause after phrase 
ADVP was decreases as fluency of L2 English 
speaker was increased. For CP, bonferroni cor-
rected post-hoc t-test revealed that there were sta-
tistically significant differences (p < 0.04) in 
occurrence probability between every pair of L2 
English speaker groups, which implies that dura-
tion of sentence-medial pause after phrase CP was 
decreased as fluency of L2 English speakers was 
increased (as shown in Figure 7). In addition, a 
series of t-test was carried out to determine which 

group of L2 English speakers differed significantly 
from the L1 English speakers for each phrase type. 
Result of t-test revealed that every group except 
excellent L2 English speaker group was differed 
significantly (p < 0.05) from L1 English speakers 
for each phrase type. From this result and Figure 7, 
it is observed that duration of sentence-medial 
pause after each phrase for each L2 English speak-
er group except excellent L2 English speaker 
group was comparatively higher than that of L1 
English speakers; but duration of pause after each 
phrase (except NP) for excellent L2 English speak-
er group was almost equal with L1 English speak-
ers. From this result of analysis, it is revealed that 
duration of sentence-medial pause after each 
phrase type for fluent L2 English speakers was 
lower than that of less fluent L2 English speakers, 
and duration of sentence-medial pause for each 
phrase type was almost equal for both L1 English 
speaker and excellent L2 English speaker groups. 

Phrase Length (l): Figure 8 shows the average 
duration of sentence-medial pauses of L1 and five 
L2 English speaker groups for different phrase 
length.

Table 7 shows result of one way ANOVA (flu-
ency as a between group variable) over five groups 
of L2 English speakers for each l. The result indi-
cates that there was significant effect (p < 0.05) of 
fluency on duration of sentence-medial pause for 
each l. Bonferroni corrected post-hoc t-tests re-
vealed that there were statistically significant dif-
ferences (p < 0.04) in duration of sentence-medial 
pause between every pair of L2 English speaker 
groups for each level of l. From these results and 
Figure 8, it is observed that duration of sentence-

Table 8:  The result of one way ANOVA for each L2 
English speaker group. 

The result from Table 8 indicates that there was 
significant effect (p< 0.05) of l on occurrence 
probability of sentence-medial pause for each L2 
English speaker group. Post-hoc tests using Tu-
key’s HSD procedure were performed to determine 
which phrase length (l) type differs significantly 
from each other for each L2 English speaker 
group. From the results of post-hoc Tukey’s HSD 
procedure, it is observed that mean difference in 
pause duration between every pair of l was statisti-
cally significant (mean difference > HSD value, p 
< 0.05) except 3-6, 6-9 pairs of each L2 English 
speaker group. From result of this investigation 
and Figure 7, it is seen that mean duration of sen-
tence-medial pause was almost linearly dependent 
on l for each L2 English speaker group like L1 
English speakers. 

Distance (d) between Current Phrase and its 
Dependent Counter Part: Figure 9 shows the av-
erage occurrence probability of sentence-medial 
pauses of L1 and five L2 English speaker groups 

for different distance. Table 9 shows result of one 
way ANOVA (fluency as a between group varia-
ble) over five groups of L2 English speakers for 
each d. The result indicates that there was signifi-
cant effect (p < 0.05) of fluency on duration of sen-
tence-medial pause for each d.

Table 9:   The result of one way ANOVA for each dis-
tance (d). 

Bonferroni corrected post-hoc t-test revealed that 
there were statistically significant differences (p < 
0.04) in pause duration between every pair of L2 
English speaker groups except very good-excellent 
pair for each d. From these results and Figure 9, it 
is observed that duration of sentence-medial pause 
was almost equal between very good and excellent 
L2 English speaker groups for each d and duration 
of sentence-medial pause of fluent L2 English 
speakers was comparatively lower than that of less 
fluent L2 English speakers for each d.  

In addition, one way ANOVA was performed on 
each L2 English speaker group with d as between 
group variable. Table 10 shows result of ANOVA 
for each L2 English speaker group.

Table 10: The result of one way ANOVA for   each L2 
English speaker group. 

The result indicates that there was significant ef-
fect (p < 0.05) of distance on duration of sentence-
medial pause for each L2 English speaker group. 
Post-hoc tests using Tukey’s HSD procedure were 
performed to determine which distance (d) types 
differ significantly from each other for each L2 
English speaker group. Tukey’s HSD procedure 
reveals that mean difference between every pair of 
phrases (except some pairs of phrases) of each L2 
English speaker group was statistically significant 
(mean difference > HSD value, p < 0.05).From 
Figure 9 and result of Tukey’s HSD procedure, it is 
seen that average duration of sentence-medial 
pauses for each L2 English speaker group was al-
most linearly dependent on distance (d) like L1 
English speaker group.  

5 Conclusions 

From this study, it is seen that there was significant 
effect of L2 English (L1 Bengali) speakers’ fluen-
cy on occurrence probability as well as duration of 
sentence-medial pause. Result of this comparative 
study reveals that, for each phrase type, each 
phrase length level, and each distance level, occur-
rence probability and duration of sentence-medial 
pause were increased as fluency level of L2 Eng-
lish speakers was decreased. In particular, occur-
rence probability and duration of sentence-medial 
pause of every L2 English speaker group except 
excellent L2 English speaker group for each phrase 
type, each phrase length level, each distance level, 
were higher than L1 English speaker group, but 
occurrence probability and duration of pause after 
each respective phrase type, each phrase length 
level, and each distance level for excellent L2 Eng-
lish speaker group were almost equal to that of L1 
English speakers. Moreover, occurrence probabili-
ty and duration of sentence-medial pause were in-
creased almost linearly with phrase length as well 

as distance for every L2 English speaker group 
respectively. From this detailed comparative study, 
it may seem to suggest that occurrence probability 
as well as duration of sentence-medial pauses in 
English readout speech of fluent L2 English speak-
ers are lower than that of less fluent L2 English 
speakers at every phrase length and distance values 
respectively. In addition, occurrence probability 
and duration of sentence-medial pauses in English 
readout speech are linearly dependent on phrase 
length and distance respectively for fluent as well 
as less fluent L2 English speakers.
