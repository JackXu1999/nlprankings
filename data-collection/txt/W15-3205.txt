Abstract

This paper presents a wide literature re-
view of natural language processing for di-
alectical Arabic. Four main research areas
were identified and the dialect coverage in
research work was outlined. The paper can
be used as a quick reference to identify rel-
evant contributions that address a specific
NLP aspect for a specific dialect.

1 Introduction

The last ten years have experienced a growing in-
terest in natural language processing for dialecti-
cal Arabic. This growth can be attributed to sev-
eral factors including the wide usage of Arabic di-
alects in social media. The topics treated by com-
putational linguists for Arabic dialects range from
fundamental language aspects including morphol-
ogy up to sophisticated solutions such as machine
translation.

To have an overview of the research that has
been done in this area we went through as many
papers as possible and tried to specify the main
contributions of each paper. We could identify
four main categories, whereas each category has
some subcategories. The main categories are basic
language analyses, building language resources,
semantic-level analysis and synthesis, and identi-
fying Arabic dialects. Then, we mapped each pa-
per to categories and subcategories as well as to
the addressed dialect or dialects in a matrix form
as given in Table 1. By this means, it can be easily
identified what has been done in the Arabic NLP,
by whom, and for what dialects.

The following four sections describe the related
work in the four main categories. For space rea-
sons, however, we limited the description to main
aspects. The final section provides a brief discus-
sion of the findings of this survey.

2 Basic Language Analyses

Several solutions have been proposed for the mor-
phological analysis, syntactical analysis, and or-
thographic analysis and generation. The follow-
ing three sections describe these solutions, respec-
tively.

2.1 Morphological Analysis and POS
Tagging

The morphology of dialectal Arabic had gained
early attention by computational linguists. In
(Habash & Rambow, 2006), a morphological an-
alyzer and generator, denoted MAGED, was pre-
sented. This tool is able to analyze the Levantine
dialect and to convert MSA to Levantine. In a
later publication the authors detailed the morpho-
phonemic and the orthographic rules encoded in
MAGEAD (Habash & Rambow, 2007).

In (Habash, Eskander, & Hawwari, 2012), a
morphological analyzer for Egyptian Arabic is
proposed with further development in (Salloum &
Habash, 2014).

In (Almeman & Lee, 2012), two morphologi-
cal analyzers for Gulf, Levantine, Egyptian, North
African, Sudani, and Iraqi dialects were presented.
The first one relies on a MSA morphological ana-
lyzer. The second one applies word segmentation
and uses web data as a corpus to produce statis-
tical information about the frequency of different
segment combinations. In (Zribi, Khemakhem,
& Belguith, 2013), a morphological analyzer for
the Tunisian dialect based on a MSA analyzer was
proposed. Furthermore, a lexicon for the Tunisian
dialect is built as an expansion of a MSA lexi-
con. An unsupervised approach for morphologi-
cal segmentation was applied to improve machine
translation from the Qatari dialect to English (Al-
Mannai et al., 2014).

In (Duh & Kirchhoff, 2005), a part-of-speech
tagger for Egyptian Arabic was proposed based
on a morphological analyzer for MSA and a min-

36



imally supervised approach that requires raw text
data from several Arabic varieties.

In (Al-Sabbagh & Girju, 2012a), a function-
based POS tagger is proposed that was trained on
a manually-annotated Egyptian Arabic corpus.

In (Habash et al., 2013) a MSA morphological
tagger is retargeted to Egyptian Arabic. The so-
lution performs part-of-speech tagging, diacritiza-
tion, lemmatization, and tokenization.

A rule-based stemmer for Arabic Gulf dialect
was proposed in (Abuata & Al-Omari, 2015), and
a fine-grained POS tagger for Tunisian dialect was
presented in (Boujelbane et al., 2014).

2.2 Syntax and Parsing

The syntax of Arabic dialects was purely ad-
dressed in the context of computational linguistics.
In (Brustad, 2000), the author presented a com-
parative study of Moroccan, Egyptian, Syrian, and
Kuwaiti dialects with respect to syntax however
without computational aspects.

In (Chiang et al., 2006) a parser for the Lev-
antine Arabic is proposed. The parser doesn’t
rely on annotated Levantine corpus or a paral-
lel Levantine-MSA corpus. Rather, the Levantine
word is translated into a bag of MSA words that
are scored and decoded relying on MSA corpus.
The resulting text is then parsed using an MSA
parser. Finally, the terminal nodes in the result-
ing parse structure are replaced with the original
Levantine words.

Levantine was also the dialect treated in
(Maamouri et al., 2006). In this work a pi-
lot Levantine Arabic Treebank is developed by a
morphological and syntactic annotation of 26,000
words of Levantine Arabic conversational tele-
phone speech. The Treebank was used to de-
velop and evaluate parsers for Levantine texts.
Grammatical mapping rules were defined to pro-
vide language resources for machine translation
from Tunisian dialect to MSA and other target lan-
guages in (Sadat, Mallek, et al., 2014).

2.3 Orthographic Analysis

In contrast to MSA, dialectical Arabic has no or-
thographic standard. The same word can be writ-
ten in different forms. This poses difficulties to
NLP tools. In (Dasigi & Diab, 2011), first steps
towards normalizing Arabic dialects orthography
for Levantine and Egyptian were made. For that,
different similarity measures were employed that

exploit string similarity and contextual semantic
similarity.

In (Habash, Diab, & Rambow, 2012), a con-
ventional orthography is proposed to help build-
ing computational models for Arabic dialects in
general and Egyptian in particular. The rules and
guidelines produced were named CODA.

Recently, a conventional orthography for
Tunisian Arabic was proposed in (Zribi et al.,
2014). Also, Several papers on the transliteration
from Arabizi into Arabic orthography appeared
(Bies et al., 2014), (Darwish, 2013), (Masmoudi et
al., 2015). Arabizi is Arabic text written in Latin
characters.

In (Zribi, Graja, et al., 2013), orthography
guidelines for Tunisian dialect were presented for
the purpose of transcribing a Tunisian speech cor-
pora. The rules presented are based on the stan-
dard Arabic transcription conventions. This work
was later used in (Zribi, Khemakhem, & Belguith,
2013) for morphological analysis presented in the
Morphological Analysis and POS Tagging section.

3 Building Resources for Dialectal
Arabic

The problem of the lack of language resources
in dialectical Arabic is well known. Many re-
searchers addressed this problem by creating lexi-
cons, wordnets, corpora, and treebanks.

In (Zaghouani, 2014), a useful survey of freely
available Arabic corpora including lexicons was
presented. The author highlighted the huge lack of
freely available dialectal corpora because only two
resources could be identified (Graja et al., 2010),
(Almeman & Lee, 2013)

In (Sansò, 2004), the MED-TYP project was
presented which aimed at building a typological
database for Mediterranean languages including
MSA and Arabic dialects. While the researchers
found out that the Mediterranean could not be
identified as a linguistic area in the traditional
sense, a number of significant contact phenomena
were discovered.

3.1 Building Lexicons and Lexical Analysis

In (Graff et al., 2006), a lexicon for the Iraqi
dialect was presented. The lexicon comprises
words from recorded speech tagged with pronun-
ciation data, morphology information, and part-
of-speech. The annotation was performed manu-
ally with the aid of a user interface and supporting

37



tools.
In (Al-Sabbagh & Girju, 2010) a lexicon for

Egyptian Cairene Arabic is described. Each
Cairene entry was mapped to its MSA synonym
and tagged with its part-of-speech. Additionally,
the entry is tagged with its top-ranked meaning ac-
cording to web queries.

A spelling corrector for the Iraqi dialect was
presented in (Rytting et al., 2011). An ortho-
graphic density metric is used to motivate the need
for a fine-grained ranking method for candidate
words.

In (Graff & Maamouri, 2012), the update of
three bilingual dictionaries for English-speaking
learners of Moroccan, Syrian and Iraqi Arabic was
presented. The original editions of the dictionar-
ies were developed by the Linguistic Data Con-
sortium and Georgetown University Press in the
1960’s. In the updated dictionaries, both Ara-
bic script and International Phonetic Alphabet or-
thographies are used. A web interface enables
searching, editing, reviewing and managing the
lexicon efficiently.

In (Boujelbane et al., 2013), a Tunisian dialect
text corpus as well as a method for building a bilin-
gual dictionary are described. The target is to cre-
ate a language model for a speech recognition sys-
tem for the Tunisian Broadcast News.

In (Duh & Kirchhoff, 2006), a Levantine lexi-
con was built using transductive learning through
partially annotated text. For the purpose of senti-
ment analysis of social networks data, a dedicated
lexicon for slang sentimental words and idioms
was developed in (Hedar & Doss, 2013).

In (Cavalli-Sforza et al., 2013) an Iraqi Word-
Net is presented based on the MSA WordNet,
the English WordNet, and an English-Iraqi dic-
tionary. A Tunisian dialect WordNet was built in
(Bouchlaghem & Elkhlifi, 2014) starting from a
Tunisian corpus.

3.2 Building Corpora and Treebanks

In (Al-Sabbagh & Girju, 2012b), a primary work
on building a multi-genre corpus for Egyptian
Arabic was described. The corpus data is com-
piled from Twitter, blogs, forums, and online
knowledge market services. The paper addresses
different aspects related to building dialectal Ara-
bic corpora such as function-based web harvest-
ing, dialect identification, vowel-based spelling
variation, linguistic hypercorrection, unsupervised

part-of-speech tagging and base phrase chunking
for dialectal Arabic.

Using the web as a source was also described in
(Almeman & Lee, 2013), where multi-dialect Ara-
bic corpora were built for Gulf, Levantine, Egyp-
tian and North African dialects. The work by Bou-
jelbaneon et al. on building a lexicon for Tunisian
dialect can be recited here due to building a corpus
from Tunisian broadcast news (Boujelbane et al.,
2013).

In (Cotterell & Callison-Burch, 2014), a multi-
dialect, multi-genre corpus for Egyptian, Gulf,
Levantine, Maghrebi, and Iraqi dialects was pre-
sented. Another multi-dialecti corpus based on
twitter data was built in (Mubarak & Darwish,
2014) for seven different dialects. A preliminary
work on a corpus for Palestinian dialect with 43K
words was presented in (Jarrar et al., 2014). A
parallel corpus for Algerian dialect and MSA was
proposed in (Harrat et al., 2014) for the purpose of
machine translation.

In (Maamouri et al., 2006), which was cited
in Section 2.2, a pilot Levantine Arabic Tree-
bank was presented. A conversational telephone
speech with about 26,000 words was annotated
with morphological and syntactic data. Recently,
Maamouri et al. presented a treebank for the
Egyptian Dialect (Maamouri et al., 2014).

As the quality of the annotation process is es-
sential for building accurate language resources,
some researchers payed special attention to this
process. In (Diab et al., 2010), multiple systems
to develop NLP resources for Arabic dialects in-
cluding Levantine, Egyptian, Moroccan, and Iraqi
were presented. The systems utilized MAGEAD
(Habash & Rambow, 2006) as well as Buckwalter
morphological analyzer and generator (BAMA)
(Buckwalter, 2004). The COLABA ability to pro-
cess Arabic dialects was evaluated through the
COLABA information retrieval system.

A web application for annotating Egyptian,
Iraqi, Levantine, and Moroccan dialects was pro-
posed in (Benajiba & Diab, 2010). The au-
thors follow non-functional objectives including
optimizing speed, accuracy, and efficiency while
maintaining the security and integrity of the data.
In (Zaidan & Callison-Burch, 2011), the building
of a 52M-word Arabic online commentary dataset
rich in dialectal content was presented. The long-
term annotation effort to identify the dialect level
in each sentence was also discussed. The au-

38



thors of (Elfardy & Diab, 2012b) presented a set
of guidelines for detecting code switching in Ara-
bic on the word and token levels. These guide-
lines were used to annotate a corpus that is rich
in Egyptian, Levantine, and Iraqi dialects with fre-
quent code switching to MSA. In (Habash et al.,
2008a), guidelines for identifying the level of di-
alectalness of a certain text were presented. Three
levels for dialectalness were proposed: MSA with
non-standard orthography, MSA words with di-
alect morphology, and a Dialectal lexeme.

In (Hawwari et al., 2014), a framework for clas-
sifying and annotating Egyptian multi-word ex-
pressions in a specialized computational lexicon
was proposed. A graphical tool for annotating Mo-
roccan tweets was presented in (Tratz et al., 2013).

In (Zaghouani et al., 2014), comprehensive
guidelines for annotating an Arabic corpus includ-
ing Qatar dialect was proposed. The corpus is de-
noted Qatar Arabic Language Bank (QALB). A
special attention in this work is paid to the man-
ual correction which should provide training data
for learning-based Arabic error correction tools.

4 Semantic-Level Analysis and Synthesis

Most work in this area relates to machine transla-
tion from or to Arabic dialects. Some papers treat
other tasks such as information retrieval and senti-
ment analysis.

4.1 Machine Translation

In (Bakr et al., 2008), the authors proposed a hy-
brid approach to convert an Egyptian sentence into
its corresponding diacritized MSA. The approach
is generic, i.e., it can be extended to other Arabic
dialects. Some techniques for lexical acquisition
of colloquial words are developed.

In (Sawaf, 2010), a hybrid machine transla-
tion system was extended to handle Arabic di-
alects from 15 regions including Northern Iraq,
Baghdad, Southern Iraq, Saudi-Arabia, Southern
Arabic Peninsula, Egypt, Sudan, Libya, Morocco,
Tunisia, Lebanon, North Syria, Damascus, Pales-
tine and Jordan. A decoding algorithm was devel-
oped to normalize non-standard, spontaneous and
dialectal Arabic into Modern Standard Arabic.

In (Salloum & Habash, 2011), the quality of
Arabic-English statistical machine translation was
improved to deal with Levantine and Egyptian di-
alects using morphological knowledge. A simple
rule-based approach was used to generate MSA

paraphrases for dialectal Arabic out-of-vocabulary
words and low frequency words.

In (Zbib et al., 2012), crowdsourcing was ap-
plied to build Levantine-English and Egyptian-
English parallel corpora, consisting of 1.1M words
and 380k words, respectively. The dialectal sen-
tences were selected from a large corpus of Ara-
bic web text, and translated using Amazon’s Me-
chanical Turk. The data was used to build dialectal
machine translation systems.

In (Jehl et al., 2012), the authors collected bilin-
gual sentence pairs for training statistical machine
translation systems to translate microblog mes-
sages. The paper addressed the Gulf, Levantine,
and Egyptian dialects as well as MSA. The tech-
nique presented was found to perform better than
other methods such as techniques based on ex-
tracting phrases from similar text.

In (Al-Gaphari & Al-Yadoumi, 2012) an algo-
rithm was proposed that normalizes Sanaáni di-
alect to MSA based on morphological rules. Input
text was tokenized and each token was analyzed
into stem and affixes. The stem and the affixes can
be either dialect-specific, MSA-specific, or both.
For each morphological rule the algorithm checks
the possibility of applying such a rule.

In (Salloum & Habash, 2012), a rule-based ap-
proach for machine translation from Arabic di-
alects to MSA was presented. The approach relies
on morphological analysis, morphological transfer
rules and dictionaries in addition to language mod-
els to produce MSA paraphrases of dialectal sen-
tences. The treated dialects are Levantine, Egyp-
tian, Iraqi, and Gulf Arabic.

In (Mohamed et al., 2012), a translator from
MSA to the Egyptian dialect was presented.
Among others, this process helps in the annota-
tion of the Egyptian dialect and in the translation
from this dialect to English.

In (Soltau et al., 2011), a corpus-based transla-
tor from MSA to Levantine was described. The
translator is trained on corpora with a mixture of
Levantine dialect and MSA.

The Iraqi dialect was studied with respect to MT
in two papers by Condon et al. In (Condon et
al., 2010), a two-way evaluation of English-Iraqi
dialog translation was performed. Four MT sys-
tems were evaluated and error types were spec-
ified. The English-Iraqi speech translation sys-
tems were evaluated using automated metrics. The
study described Iraqi speech data features and the

39



difficulties it presents on machine translation qual-
ity evaluation.

In (Jeblee et al., 2014), domain and dialect
adaptation was suggested to produce a statisti-
cal machine translation system from English to
the Egyptian dialect with MSA as a pivot. A
machine translation system of the Moroccan di-
alect into MSA based on statistical models and a
rule-based approach was proposed in (Tachicart &
Bouzoubaa, 2014).

4.2 Other Semantic Tasks

Sentiment and subjectivity analysis (SSA) was
treated in several papers. In (Abdul-Mageed et al.,
2014), the authors investigated how to treat Arabic
dialects and whether genre-specific features have a
measurable impact on performance of a sentiment
analyzer.

In (Hedar & Doss, 2013), a classifier for Ara-
bic slang that applies sentiment analysis to classify
news and comments on Facebook was presented.

In (Mourad & Darwish, 2013), the issue of lim-
ited Arabic SSA lexicons was addressed by pro-
viding baselines that employ Arabic specific pro-
cessing including stemming, POS tagging, and
tweets normalization. Also, a random graph walk-
ing algorithm was employed to expand SSA lexi-
cons. Open issues in sentiment analysis were dis-
cussed in (El-Beltagy & Ali, 2013) and a senti-
ment lexicon for Egyptian dialect was presented.

Recently, other sentiment analysis systems for
social media data were proposed in (Duwairi et al.,
2014) and (Ibrahim et al., 2015) for the Jordanian
and Egyptian dialects, respectively.

In (El-Fishawy et al., 2014), a microblog sum-
marization technique based on machine learning
for Egyptian dialect was presented. The results
achieved were compared to several well-known al-
gorithms such as SumBasic, TF-IDF, PageRank,
MEAD, and human summaries.

(Pasha et al., 2013) addressed the challenges of
retrieving information in Arabic dialects, which
have significant linguistic differences from Stan-
dard Arabic. The presented tool automatically
generates dialect search terms with relevant mor-
phological variations from English or Standard
Arabic query terms.

In (Zirikly & Diab, 2014) and (Zirikly &
Diab, 2015) different approaches for Named En-
tity Recognition in the Egyptian dialect were pro-
posed. Named entity recognition in microblogs

was also treated by Darwish and Gao, however,
for MSA mainly (Darwish & Gao, 2014).

In (Darwish & Magdy, 2014), a general study
of Arabic information retrieval was presented. The
survey includes different domains and applications
of Arabic IR systems as well as the specific chal-
lenges in this NLP area.

5 Dialect Identification and Recognition

The recognition of dialectal content in an Arabic
text or speech gained a special interest in the liter-
ature.

5.1 Dialect Identification in Text

Some of the previously cited work on text an-
notation, e.g. (Diab et al., 2010) and (Zaidan
& Callison-Burch, 2011), or machine translation,
e.g., (Soltau et al., 2011), implicitly include com-
ponents for dialect identification.

In (Habash et al., 2008b), standard annotation
guidelines to identify a switching between MSA
and an Egyptian or a Levantine dialect in written
text were presented. The guidelines can be used to
annotate large collections of data used for training
and testing NLP tools.

In (Elfardy & Diab, 2013), a supervised ap-
proach on the sentence level is proposed to dif-
ferentiate between MSA and the Egyptian dialect.
Token level labels are used to derive sentence-
level features that are employed with other core
and meta features to train a generative classifier
that predicts the correct label for each sentence in
the given input text. This work was extended to
the Iraqi, Levantine and Moroccan dialects by the
same authors in (Elfardy & Diab, 2012a).

In (Zaidan & Callison-Burch, 2012), the authors
used a large annotated dataset to train and evalu-
ate automatic classifiers for the sake of Arabic di-
alect identification. Given an Arabic sentence, the
task consists in determining the variety of Arabic
in which it is written. The variety can be MSA,
Maghrebi, Egyptian, Levantine, Iraqi, or Gulf.

Recently, a native Bayes classifier based on
character bi-gram model was proposed to iden-
tify 18 different Arabic dialects (Sadat, Kazemi,
& Farzindar, 2014). In (Darwish et al., 2014), the
authors based their identification approach of the
Egyptian dialect on lexical, morphological, as well
as phonological information.

In (Zaidan & Callison-Burch, 2014), the authors
created a large monolingual dataset with dialect

annotations to identify Levantine, Gulf, Egyptian,
Iraqi, and Maghrebi dialects. The identification
of several Maghrebi dialects in addition to Syrian
and Palestinian Arabic was an aspect in the cross-
dialectical study proposed in (Harrat et al., 2015).

5.2 Dialect Recognition in Speech

In (Lei & Hansen, 2009), a factor analysis-based
modeling technique was proposed to describe the
composition of the supervector defined by the
Gauss Mixture Model for dialect identification.
The method utilizes knowledge types of informa-
tion contained in the transcript file of the data. The
addressed dialects in this work are the Emirati, the
Egyptian, the Iraqi, the Palestinian, and the Syrian
dialects.

In (Biadsy et al., 2009), the authors described a
system that automatically identifies the Arabic di-
alect (Gulf, Iraqi, Levantine, Egyptian and MSA)
of a speaker given a sample of his/her speech.

In (Akbacak et al., 2011), the authors studied
the effectiveness of recently developed language
recognition techniques based on speech recogni-
tion models for the discrimination of Arabic di-
alects.

In (Belgacem et al., 2010), an automatic recog-
nition system for Arabic dialects was proposed.
The analyzed dialects are Tunisian, Moroccan, Al-
gerian, Egyptian, Syrian, Lebanese, Yemeni, Iraqi,
and Gulf. The proportion of vocalic intervals and
the standard deviation of consonantal intervals are
analyzed using the platform Alize and Gaussian
Mixture Models.

In (Zhang et al., 2013), the authors investi-
gated variations to supervector pre-processing for
dialect identification based on phone recognition-
support vector machines. They studied the nor-
malization of supervector dimensions in the pre-
squashing stage, the impact of alternative squash-
ing functions, and the N-gram selection for super-
vector dimensionality reduction. Addressed di-
alects include Iraqi, Gulf, Egyptian, and Levan-
tine.

Speech recognition for Arabic dialects was
addressed in (Kirchhoff & Vergyri, 2005),
(Boujelbane et al., 2013), and (Alghamdi et al.,
2008) for the Egyptian, Tunisian and Saudi di-
alects, respectively. In (Kirchhoff & Vergyri,
2005), the authors described the use of MSA
acoustic data to improve the recognition of Egyp-
tian conversational dialect. To simplify this task,

the MSA data is vowelized automatically before
combining it with the Egyptian conversational di-
alect data. The corpus building in (Boujelbane et
al., 2013) was motivated by the need to create lan-
guage models towards a speech recognition sys-
tem for the Tunisian Broadcast News.

Recently, Ali et al. presented a system for Egyp-
tian speech recognition that reduces word error
rate using micro blog data(Ali, 2014).

In (Alghamdi et al., 2008), the authors aimed
to present a speech database by native speakers
across Saudi Arabia. The paper shows an ap-
proach that enables researchers to select samples
from a population to produce a speech database
where a dialect map is unobtainable. The resulted
corpus was used to train a speech recognition sys-
tem.

In (Iskra et al., 2004), the results of the Orien-
Tel project were presented. This European project
dealt with building telephony databases across
Northern Africa and the Middle East.

6 Discussion

Table 1 summarizes the discussed research work
on Arabic NLP. The columns represent the differ-
ent research areas and the rows show the different
covered dialects. Based on this table and on the
discussions in the previous sections the following
comments can be made.

1. By counting all published works, it can be
seen that the research on computational lin-
guistics for dialectal Arabic, as an alterna-
tive to Modern Standard Arabic, is emerging.
Given that the different Arabic dialects are
spoken by more than 390 million people in
total, the total amount of research conducted
in this area is still very limited.

2. The most treated dialect in Arabic NLP is the
Egyptian Arabic. This may be attributed to
the fact that Egypt is the country with the
largest population in the Arabic world. How-
ever, such a population argument fails to ex-
plain why the Levantine Arabic has been paid
relatively high attention, while the dialects of
some population-rich countries such as Su-
dan, Morocco, and Algeria have been treated
very poorly. The relatively high concentra-
tion on Levantine Arabic may be associated
with geopolitical issues and the Middle-East
conflict.

43



3. Most research work has been spent on build-
ing and annotating dialectical corpora due
to the fact that dialectical Arabic is still a
resource-poor language. Dialect identifica-
tion and speech recognition were also re-
searched intensively. Recall that these two
tasks are frequently performed towards build-
ing language resources. While the morphol-
ogy of dialectical Arabic was addressed in
some papers, the syntactical analysis is al-
most ignored in research.

4. The selection of the geographic granularity
level on which Arabic dialects are treated is
not clear. The majority of related work that
addresses Levantine, for instance, treats this
variety as one dialect. Levantine, however, is
spoken in Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, and Pales-
tine. In each of these countries, furthermore,
a lot of varieties can be identified.

From this discussion it is obvious that the re-
search on Arabic dialects should be enhanced both
on the dialect as well as on the topic level. A hier-
archical scheme should be introduced to define the
granularity of Arabic dialects so that researchers
can be more specific in assigning their work to
some dialect or dialects. The built language re-
sources especially annotated corpora should be
made available to accelerate the research in this
area. More research on the syntactical analysis of
Arabic dialects is required to improve the quality
of related tools.
