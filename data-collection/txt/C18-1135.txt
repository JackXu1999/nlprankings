Abstract

We investigate the birth and diffusion of lexical innovations in a large dataset of online social
communities. We build on sociolinguistic theories and focus on the relation between the spread
of a novel term and the social role of the individuals who use it, uncovering characteristics of
innovators and adopters. Finally, we perform a prediction task that allows us to anticipate whether
an innovation will successfully spread within a community.

1 Introduction

Language is an incessantly evolving system, and linguistic innovations of different kind are continuously
created. New variants originate in concrete communicative situations with particular speakers. After
being introduced, some of them are adopted by other speakers belonging to the same community and
possibly spread until they become community norms. In contrast, other innovations do not manage to
make their way into the community conventions and just disappear after a certain period of time. This
process raises many intriguing questions, which have been the focus of attention in Sociolinguistics
since the late 1960’s (Weinreich et al., 1968; Chambers and Schilling, 2013). For example, at what
linguistic levels (phonology, lexicon, syntax) do innovations arise and succeed? Who are the leaders of
change and what are their social characteristics? In this paper, we investigate lexical innovation in online
communities, focusing on the latter type of question, by means of a large-scale data-driven approach.

We study the interplay between the birth and spread of new terms and users’ social standing in large
online social communities, taking as starting point hypotheses put forward in the Sociolinguistics lit-
erature (see Section 2). We present a longitudinal study on a large social media dataset, including 20
online forums and around 10 million users overall. We consider each forum as an independent social
network, and investigate how lexical innovations arise and spread within a forum. We analyse the fate
of approximately 8 thousand innovations (focusing on acronyms such as lol, phonetic spellings such as
plis, and other linguistic phenomena usually collected under the term of Internet slang), and relate their
spread within a social network to the role of the individuals who use them. We characterise users’ roles
within a community by means of a novel, theoretically-motivated tie-strength measure, combined with
well-known centrality measures.

We show that (1) innovators (users who introduce a new term) are central members of a community,
connected to many other users but with relatively low tie-strength, and (2) strong-tie users (who belong
to cliques or sub-groups within the community) effectively contribute to the dissemination of a new
term. This pattern is surprisingly consistent across the 20 online communities under investigation. In
addition, we show that, by solely using information on speakers’ tie strength as predictor variable, we
can anticipate whether an innovation will successfully spread within a community.

Our work yields new theoretical insights into the applicability of sociolinguistic theories to online
settings. It also has practical significance for NLP systems encountering novel terms in social media:
While new terms that do not succeed in becoming community norms may safely be treated as out-
of-vocabulary words, a better understanding of the dissemination process of novel terms beyond their

frequency can help identify those innovations that a system should be able to deal with. Together with
the in-depth analysis presented in the paper, we make available our dataset, which includes interactions
scraped from 20 topic-based forums over a period of 4 to 8 years, as well as the code for preprocessing
the data, extracting the dissemination trajectories of∼8k internet slang terms, and computing the strength
of the ties among users.1

2 Background

2.1 Sociolinguistic Theories
Our investigation of innovations in online social communities builds on Milroy’s (1987) theory, ac-
cording to which linguistic innovations propagate and become community norms when individuals with
strong ties adopt them early on; however, it is usually individuals with only weak ties who are the actual
innovators, i.e., those who introduce novel linguistic variants. Milroy’s proposal is thus an application
to Sociolinguistics of The Strength of Weak Ties theory put forward by Granovetter (1973) to explain the
diffusion of innovations more broadly.

In Milroy’s (1987) original study, the strength of a tie between two individuals is given by a combina-
tion of factors, such as the amount of time spent together, the level of intimacy, etc. As a result, strong
ties are usually those connecting family members or close friends, while weak ties connect acquain-
tances. Individuals linked by strong ties form close-knit sub-communities or clusters, whereas weak ties
act as bridges between these clusters. According to Milroy’s theory, individuals without strong ties are
more likely to innovate. Thanks to their bridging role, they can introduce an innovation into one or more
close-knit clusters. Once introduced, the innovation can be adopted by closely connected individuals
within a cluster, who quickly propagate it to others.

Milroy’s theory has found confirmation both in small-scale sociolinguistic studies carried out in the
protestant enclaves of Belfast (Milroy and Milroy, 1985; Milroy and Milroy, 1987) and in agent-based
models with simulated data (Fagyal et al., 2010). However, it has not been tested at a large scale on
actual linguistic data. Moreover, the theory contrasts with other well-established models regarding the
source of novel variants, which casts some doubt on the generality of its application: Labov’s studies
on New York adolescent gangs and the neighbourhoods of Philadelphia (Labov, 1972; Labov, 2001)
identified leaders, i.e., those who have strong networks and are the most popular in their communities,
as the drivers of change. Similarly, Eckert’s (2000) studies of adolescent groups in Detroit showed that
language novelty and change is led by charismatic leaders with strong ties to the local community.

We assess the applicability of Milroy’s theory to the emergence of lexical innovations in online social
communities, where relationships between individuals and their exposure to new terms can only be
modelled in terms of their directly observable linguistic interaction in online discussion threads.

2.2 Related Computational Work
Research on language change has recently experienced a boost within the NLP community (Hamilton et
al., 2016; Frermann and Lapata, 2016). Here we focus on reviewing approaches that are directly related to
the work we present in this paper, i.e., approaches that investigate linguistic innovation within relatively
short time spans of a few years (rather than looking at historical time) and that do so by leveraging data
from social media to create a graph of connected users. More general literature on graph modelling and
innovation diffusion is out of the scope of our review.

Graphs representing social networks have been used to analyse the extralinguistic factors that drive
diffusion, such as geographical (Eisenstein, 2015) and demographic variables (Eisenstein et al., 2014),
as well as the position of individuals in the social network (Paolillo, 1999) and the kind of user interac-
tions that foster the diffusion of the innovations. For example, Goel et al. (2016) and Paradowski and
Jonak (2012) investigate the amount of interaction required to adopt an innovation, showing that while
some innovations are adopted by a new user after multiple interactions, for others a single contact is
sufficient. Rotabi et al. (2017a) relate the success of competing lexical variants to the seniority of the
users who use them. This work is extended by Rotabi et al. (2017b), who introduce an inheritance graph

to represent how speakers pass innovations (in this case called practices) on to others in time through
real-life collaborations.

Perhaps the work that is most directly connected to ours is that of Rotabi and Kleinberg (2016), who
investigate the diffusion patterns of words that experience a frequency burst at a given time, which the
authors call trends, and analyse the level of activity of the users involved in the different phases of the
diffusion process. While related, our work differs on key points: we focus on linguistic innovations
rather than trends and characterise users in terms of tie strength rather than level of activity.

A parallel line of work has investigated linguistic diffusion in relation to social ties using agent-based
computer simulations (Ke et al., 2008; Fagyal et al., 2010; Swarup et al., 2011). In particular, Fagyal et
al. (2010) address questions similar to ours via simulated data and find that peripheral users are crucial in
introducing new linguistic variants, which are then adopted and spread by central agents in the commu-
nity. The current availability of large social media datasets containing real linguistic interactions allows
us to study these questions with more ecological validity.

3 Methodology

We describe our dataset, the methodology we use to define the social network of a community and the
social role of its members, and the procedure to identify linguistic innovations and characterise their
diffusion.

3.1 Data
We use data from Reddit,2 a popular website which includes around 1 million communities called sub-
reddits. A subreddit is a topic-based forum where users can submit posts, comment on existing posts or
score them. While in this paper we treat each forum independently (leaving the analysis of innovation
diffusion across forums for future work), in order to conduct a large-scale analysis and draw conclusions
that generalise across communities, we analyse 20 different forums that show substantial variability in
terms of subject matter and size (see Table 1 for an overview). Despite their rich heterogeneity, all sub-
reddits we consider share the following features, which are indicative of highly active and interconnected
communities, where the spreading cascade process at the base of innovation diffusion finds a favourable
environment (Hamilton et al., 2017; Guille et al., 2013):

• a topic that reflects a strong external interest, such as sport teams, videogames or TV series;
• small-to-medium size, which in contrast to very large subreddits such as r/news (15M users) or

r/funny (18M), are less dispersive and favour tighter connections;

• high density, i.e., high ratio of existing connections over the number of potential connections;3

We downloaded the entire content of each subreddit from its first post to the end of 2016. We segment the
data from each subreddit into consecutive time bins corresponding to one month.4 We discard time bins
with less than 200 active users, which are common during the first few months of a subreddit lifespan,
and ignore any posts whose author is unknown.5

Next, we explain how we leverage this longitudinal data to extract information about the social role of
forum members, as well as to detect linguistic innovations and characterise their diffusion.

3.2 Social Network
We create a graph representing a community’s social network for each month t during the community
lifespan. In these graphs, nodes are users and edges encode whether users have interacted. We consider
two users to be connected by an edge if they comment within the same thread in close proximity.6 Given

3Hamilton et al. (2017) report density values in the range [0.001− 0.016] in their set of subreddits.
4We also experimented with smaller bins of one week, obtaining similar results.
5When users delete their account, the posts, comments, and messages submitted prior to the deletion are still visible to

others, but information about the user is not available (see Reddit Privacy Policy at https://www.redditinc.com/
policies/privacy-policy).

6In particular, if they are separated by at most two posts, as done e.g., by Hamilton et al. (2017).

that arguably lexical diffusion follows a simple “contagion” model whereby a single contact is sufficient
for the spreading process (Goel et al., 2016), our graphs are undirected and unweighted.7

Milroy’s (1987) theory relates the diffusion of a linguistic innovation to the local topology of indi-
viduals within a network, distinguishing between close-knit sub-groups and individuals outside of these
groups. In line with other studies such as Weng et al. (2015) and Zhao et al. (2010), we build on a
measure introduced by Onnela et al. (2007), which determines the strength of the edge between two
individuals i and j in terms of the overlap Oij of their adjacent neighbourhoods, as follows:

Oij =
nij

(ki − 1) + (kj − 1)− nij
[1]

where nij is the number of adjacent nodes between i and j, and ki, kj their respective degree, i.e., the
number of edges incident to each of them. Possible values for Oij are in the range [0, 1], where 0 indicates
no common neighbours (weakest possible connection between i and j) and 1 exactly the same adjacent
neighbours (strongest possible connection between i and j).

We now leverage Equation [1] to characterize users given the strength of their connections. According
to Milroy (1987), weak-tie individuals have only weak connections (are not part of close-knit clusters),
while strong-tie individuals have strong connections with other users, but may also have weak connec-
tions if they are linked to weak-tie users. To capture this, we define the tie strength of each individual i
as the highest value of her incident edges. That is, for all individuals j directly connected to i:

tie-strength(i) := max (Oij) [2]

Taking the maximum captures what we are after: A community member who only has weak connections
will have low tie-strength and be considered a weak-tie user, while a member with either strong con-
nections only or with both strong and weak connections will have high tie-strength and be considered
a strong-tie user, who will be part of a local clique (Luce and Perry, 1949). Unlike mean or median
values, which tend to be rather balanced and thus do not help to distinguish between innovators and non-
innovators, taking the maximum is in line with Milroy’s theory and captures the key difference between
these two groups of users, as will be shown in the next section.

7The graphs are implemented with Python’s package networkx.



1595

Besides computing tie-strength as defined in Equation [2] for all users in our social graphs, we also
compute their centrality values for three common measures of network centrality — degree, betweenness,
and eigenvector — which are global indices of the importance of a node with respect to all other nodes
in a graph (Newman, 2010).

3.3 Linguistic Innovations
We focus on Internet slang, a general term commonly used to refer to a range of linguistic phenomena
such as abbreviations (cu for see you), acronyms (IIRC for if I remember/recall correctly) and phonetic
spellings (dat for that). The motivation behind this choice is twofold: firstly, forms of this kind are very
abundant and continuously introduced in online communication; and secondly, they are easier to identify
and track than innovations at other levels, such as those related to meaning shift. In the present study,
we do not focus on tracking the co-evolution of two variants (e.g., dat vs. that) that may be competing,
but rather on analysing the emergence of new forms and their trajectories independently, in light of the
tie-strength of the members who use them.

Our starting point are the terms in the dictionary available at NoSlang.com,8 a comprehensive record
of Internet slang that is constantly updated. After removing terms including non-alphabetic characters,
we obtain a list of approximately 6k terms. For each subreddit, we only consider terms that:

• are used at least 10 times in the subreddit;
• are not present during the first 3 months of the community’s existence; and
• are introduced within the initial quarter of the community lifespan.

That is, we restrict our analysis to newly introduced Internet slang terms that are not present from the
very beginning of the community’s activity, but are not introduced too late so as to be able to observe
their trajectory for a substantial period of time.9

The number of innovations considered across all subreddits is 7962, while the number of unique inno-
vations amounts to 1456. Most of the terms (around 76%) occur in more than one community, although
no innovation is present in all the subreddits in our dataset. Thus, around 24% of innovations tracked oc-
cur in just one community — some of these are clearly topic-related, e.g., pkemon in /r/pokemon, while
others are more general purpose abbreviations that, in principle, could appear in any community, such as
txs (thanks, in /r/Android) or omgz (oh my god/gosh, in /r/subaru). Regarding frequency, while we set a
minimum threshold of 10 occurrences, in practice 72% of terms occur at least 50 times on average.

Dissemination trajectory. Once introduced, innovations may have different fates: they can spread
widely within the community, be used by just a small sub-group, or fail to make an impact and disappear
altogether. We define the fate of a term as its dissemination, which we compute as the proportion of
community members who use it at a given moment in time (Del Tredici and Fernández, 2017; Altmann et
al., 2011). It should be stressed that dissemination differs from frequency. Although often they are highly
correlated, in principle a term can have high relative frequency but low dissemination and vice versa. We
quantify the diffusion of innovations in terms of their dissemination since this gives us a measure of their
spread within a community. To this end, for each innovation we calculate its dissemination trajectory as
the vector of its monthly dissemination values since the innovation was introduced.

Tie-strength trajectory. Similarly, we compute the tie-strength trajectory of each innovation as a vec-
tor whose features correspond to the maximum tie-strength value among the users that used it in the
corresponding month. We choose the maximum value in order to test Milroy’s (1987) hypothesis, ac-
cording to which the crucial factor in the diffusion of an innovation is its adoption by strong-tie members
(see Section 2). Considering only the maximum value provides a simple way to test whether any indi-
vidual with high tie-strength has used the term in a given month.10

8https://www.noslang.com/dictionary/
9To assess whether ambiguity may be an issue, we checked whether the terms also appear in a standard English dictionary,

PyDictionary. For example, the slang term bra for brother also has the standard meaning of brasserie. Given that under 2% of
terms in our dataset could potentially be ambiguous, we decided to not treat them in any special way.

10The dissemination and the tie-strength vectors always have the same magnitude.

semination trajectories of successful (blue solid line) and unsuccessful (orange dashed line) innovations.

4 Empirical Observations

Our analysis reveals some patterns common to all communities, which we present in this section.

4.1 Linguistic Innovations

In order to explore the relative success of innovations, we consider the level of dissemination reached
by an innovation to be the average dissemination value in the last six months.11 Results show that
the distribution of these final dissemination values is highly skewed for all the subreddits — see, for
example, Figure 1 (left) for /r/beer. While a few innovations disseminate successfully (i.e., are adopted
by a relatively high number of community members), most of them do not spread, and either disappear
or barely appear in the last period.

In Figure 1 (center/right) we show examples of successful and unsuccessful innovations. Successful
innovations such as iap (In App Purchases) and idk (I don’t know) show a stable increase in dissemination
after their introduction, which can reach a plateau at some point (iap) — thus showing the S-shaped curve
typical of general processes of innovation adoption (Rogers, 2010) — or can still be ongoing at the end
of the period covered by our analysis (idk). Unsuccessful innovations, in contrast, can either have a flat
dissemination trajectory, as in the case of irl (In Real Life), indicating that the term has never experienced
a spread in the community, or present a peak at some point, followed by a sudden decrease with no stable
recovery, as for atl (Atlanta).

Given these observations, we formally define the classes of successful and unsuccessful innovations
based on the dissemination slope of a term, computed as the difference between its average dissemination
value in the first six months and in the last six months in the dissemination trajectory vector. We include
in the unsuccessful class innovations with slope index ≤ 0, i.e., those with trajectories similar to the irl
and atl examples in Figure 1 (center/right). In order to discard innovations with very low positive slope
(i.e., those that do not disappear, but are only sporadically used) we only include in the successful class
terms whose slope index is above the average value of the community.12 We will make use of these two
classes in the prediction experiment we present in Section 6.

4.2 Social Networks

Next, we analyse the distribution of users’ tie-strength values in the social graphs derived for the com-
munities in our dataset.13 We find a clear pattern for all subreddits: the large majority of users have low
tie-strength, with around 39% having values ≤ 0.05 and almost 50% having values ≤ 0.1; while, around
15 to 20% of users have strong tie-strength, with values ≥ 0.5. Figure 2 shows the average tie-strength
value distribution computed over all the monthly graphs of all subreddits in the dataset, with probabilities
calculated for bins of size 0.1 for illustration purposes.

11This makes our measurements more robust than taking only the very last bin.
12Average slope index is positive for all subreddits.
13A sample graph is available at https://github.com/marcodel13/The-Road-to-Success.



1597

Figure 2: Average tie-strength distribution for
all subreddits, with standard deviation.

This distribution mirrors the typical power-law dis-
tribution observed for centrality measures in online
communities (Mihalcea and Radev, 2011). The topo-
logical properties captured by our tie-strength measure
(Equation [2]), however, are different from those cap-
tured by centrality, as already hinted at in Section 3.2.
The three centrality measures considered (degree, be-
tweenness, and eigenvector) correlate strongly with
each other (Spearman’s r in range 0.85–0.89).14 But
there is only a moderate correlation with tie-strength:
r=0.63 degree, r=0.61 betweenness, and r=0.47 eigen-
vector. In addition, we observe that the three central-
ity measures correlate strongly with number of posts
(r=[0.78–0.91]) in all subreddits, while we find low
correlation between number of posts and tie-strength (r=0.31, std=0.08, p<.05).

These results confirm the difference between our tie-strength measure and centrality. While centrality
values are global indices of the role of a node with respect to the entire graph (Newman, 2010), tie-
strength captures the local topological information around a node. In the online social communities we
investigate, individuals at the core of the social network, who interact with many other individuals and
have high posting activity, receive high centrality values. In contrast, high tie-strength values are the
signature of users who belong to small cliques, but who do not act as hubs for the entire network. We
take this as confirmation that our tie-strength measure does capture key features of the social structures
underpinning Milroy’s (1987) theory. It remains to be seen, however, whether these social structures, as
realised in large online social communities, lend support to the theory’s main claims.

5 Assessing Sociolinguistic Claims

In this section, we uncover the features that characterise innovators and analyse the role of strong-tie
users in the dissemination process.

5.1 Innovators

Figure 3: Comparison of the probability mass
distribution of innovators’ tie-strength values
and avg. values of all users in all subreddits.

We consider innovators those members who introduce
a new term, i.e., those who use it for the very first time
in a community. In order to verify whether innovators
are weak-tie users (as hypothesised by Milroy (1987)),
we compare the distribution of the tie-strength values
of innovators to the general tie-strength distribution in
the community. Since innovations are introduced at
different points in time, the general tie-strength dis-
tribution in the community is defined as the average
of the months at which innovations were introduced.
We compute Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL), which
measures how similar the behaviour of two distribu-
tions is. We find KL values in the range 0.15–0.4,
which indicates a moderate difference between the dis-
tributions. The source of this difference can be appre-
ciated in Figure 3: the tie-strength values of innovators
cluster around 0.1–0.3.15 This contrasts with the overall tie-strength distribution: innovators tend to not
be strong-tie users (lower blue than red bars for tie-strength ≥ 0.4 in Figure 3) and are far less likely to

14All correlation coefficients reported are averages across time bins and subreddits and are all significant with p<0.05.

have very weak tie-strength than most users (lower blue than red bar for tie-strength < 0.1).
In addition to analysing tie-strength, we compare the centrality values and the posting activity of

innovators and non-innovators. We observe that innovators are significantly more central than other
users (for all measures considered: degree, betweenness and eigenvector) and are significantly more
active in terms of number of posts than other individuals in the community (unpaired Welch’s t-tests, all
with p<0.05).

Thus, a very robust pattern emerges across all subreddits, showing that innovators do have a particular
profile in terms of their social standing: they do not belong to tightly connected cliques and occupy a
central position in the network, as hubs with many connections of relatively low strength. On the one
hand, this seems in line with Milroy’s hypothesis, since it confirms that innovations do not arise within
sub-communities that are close-knit. On the other hand, our results may also be interpreted as lending
support to Labov’s (1972; 2001) characterisation of innovators as leaders, since they occupy a core
position in the network.

5.2 Strong-Tie Users and Innovation Spread

We consider strong-tie users those with a tie-strength value ≥ 0.5. By definition, these are users who
are part of cliques or sub-communities within a subreddit. As mentioned in Section 4.2, strong-tie users
constitute between 15 and 20% of the total number of community members. Thus, in contrast to the
small scale social communities examined by Milroy and other sociolinguists, where most community
members are part of some tight-knit sub-group (such as a family or a church congregation), in large
online social networks strong-tie users are a minority. Despite this, strong-tie users are not isolated in
remote cliques: Our analysis shows that, in all subreddits, strong-tie users are significantly more central
(with respect to all, degree, betweenness, and eigenvector centrality) and have significantly more posting
activity than users with weak tie-strength values ≤ 0.05, who make up the vast majority of community
members — around 39% on average (unpaired Welch’s t-test, p < 0.05). Thus, in terms of centrality,
strong-tie members occupy an intermediate position in the social network, forming a loose ring around
the core innovators and the majority of members, who are on the periphery and are characterised by very
weak tie-strength.

Figure 4: Probability of dissemination in-
crease after a term is adopted by a strong-tie
user (solid line) or by a weak-tie user (dotted
line) for k consecutive months, computed for
k in range [1− 6].

To analyse the role of strong-tie users in the inno-
vation diffusion process, we proceed as follows: We
identify any time ti in the tie-strength trajectory vector
when the innovation is used by some strong-tie mem-
ber for k consecutive months. We then check its aver-
age dissemination in the period up to time ti and com-
pare it to the average dissemination in the six months
following ti+k−1. We find that when k = 1 (i.e., when
an innovation has been used by a strong-tie member
only in one month) the probability that the dissemina-
tion increases in the next six months is around 50%
for all subreddits — a value similar to the likelihood
of dissemination increase after the usage by a weak-
tie user. However, as k increases, and thus the adop-
tion by strong-tie users becomes more stable, a future
increase in dissemination becomes progressively more
likely, for all the subreddits. Importantly, the same ef-
fect is not observed for weak-tie users, for whom, independently from the number of months, the proba-
bility of a future increase in dissemination is always approximately the same. Figure 4 shows examples
of how the probability of dissemination changes after the adoption by either strong- or weak-tie users
(see Appendix A for full results).

These results, thus, are consistent with Milroy’s (1987) claims, and furthermore show that innovation
diffusion is connected to sustained adoption by strong-tie community members.

6 Predicting Innovation Success

Most innovations do not succeed in becoming community norms, but some do. Here we assess whether
information about the tie-strength of members who use an innovation in the first months after its intro-
duction can predict whether it will be successful in the future. This provides further theoretical insight
into the importance of tie-strength for innovation diffusion, and has practical significance by contributing
to identifying new terms that NLP systems should be able to process. Our aim here is not to maximise
prediction accuracy—which is likely to require taking into account several factors beyond users’ tie-
strength—but rather to explore whether the statistical effects we have uncovered are strong enough to
have some predictive power.

We approach this as a binary classification task, making use of the distinction between successful and
unsuccessful innovations defined in Section 4. We extract a subvector of length k from the tie-strength
trajectory vector of innovations and use it as features for the prediction. For instance, with k = 3, we
use the tie-strength information from the first three months of usage of a term to predict if it will be
successful or not, leveraging subvectors of increasing magnitudes. We use Python’s scikit-learn
Random Forest classifier with default parameters16 and perform 100-run cross-validation, using 90% of
the data for training and 10% for testing. We compare our results against a weighted baseline, whereby
the two labels (successful/unsuccessful) are randomly assigned taking into account their frequency in
the training set. The classes are fairly balanced across subreddits, with an average proportion of 55%
successful and 45% unsuccessful.

When leveraging tie-strength information from only the first 3 months of usage, we obtain F1 results
that are significantly higher than the baseline for 12 out the 20 subreddits. But overall, performance
remains rather low, with an average F1-score for the successful class of 0.62 vs. 0.58 for the baseline.
Given that new terms are introduced by users with relatively low tie-strength (as shown in Section 5.1),
arguably in the initial few months before a novel term is picked up by a strong-tie user, there is little
difference between successful and unsuccessful innovations. With tie-strength information from the first
6 months of usage, we are able to make predictions with results significantly above baseline for 18 out 20
subreddits, with an average F1-score of 0.68. Not surprisingly, performance increases substantially when
information for a longer period (first/second year of usage) is exploited, reaching an average F1-score of
0.76, significantly above the baseline for all communities. Detailed results, including precision, recall,
and F1-score for each subreddit, can be found in Appendix B. In Figure 5 we graphically illustrate the
results for a few subreddits, which are representative of the general trend observed.

7 Conclusions
This work has provided a large-scale analysis of the interplay between the birth and spread of new
terms and users’ social standing in large online social communities. Building on sociolinguistic theories
— in particular, Milroy’s (1987) version of The Strength of Weak Ties theory — we have proposed a
simple measure to quantify tie-strength in Milroy’s sense and have used it in combination with common
centrality measures to uncover the characteristics of innovators and to assess the role of strong-tie users
in the dissemination process.

Regarding innovators, our results show that they are central community members, connected to many
other users but with relatively low tie-strength. As for strong-tie users, we find that in online social
networks they are a small proportion of community members, organised in small cliques, and that they
do play an important role in the spread of an innovation, presumably by spreading new terms introduced
by innovators into their sub-groups. The patterns we have revealed are surprisingly consistent across the
20 online communities we have investigated.

Our work opens a range of interesting questions. In particular, we are looking forward to investigating
how the patterns we have observed are affected by users’ membership in multiple forums and how these
multi-community users transfer new terms between communities.
