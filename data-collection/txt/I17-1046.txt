Abstract

Although features of linguistic typology
are a promising alternative to lexical ev-
idence for tracing evolutionary history of
languages, a large number of missing val-
ues in the dataset pose serious difficul-
ties for statistical modeling. In this pa-
per, we combine two existing approaches
to the problem: (1) the synchronic ap-
proach that focuses on interdependencies
between features and (2) the diachronic
approach that exploits phylogenetically-
and/or spatially-related languages. Specif-
ically, we propose a Bayesian model that
(1) represents each language as a se-
quence of binary latent parameters encod-
ing inter-feature dependencies and (2) re-
lates a language‚Äôs parameters to those of
its phylogenetic and spatial neighbors. Ex-
periments show that the proposed model
recovers missing values more accurately
than others and that induced representa-
tions retain phylogenetic and spatial sig-
nals observed for surface features.

1 Introduction

Features of linguistic typology such as basic word
order (examples are SVO and SOV) and the pres-
ence or absence of tone constitute a promising
resource that can potentially be used to uncover
the evolutionary history of languages. It has been
argued that in exceptional cases, typological fea-
tures can reflect a time span of 10,000 years or
more (Nichols, 1994). Since typological features,
by definition, allow us to compare an arbitrary
pair of languages, they can be seen as the last
hope for language isolates and tiny language fam-
ilies such as Ainu, Basque, and Japanese, for
which lexicon-based historical-comparative lin-

guistics1 has failed to identify genetic relatives.
Fortunately, the publication of a large typology
database (Haspelmath et al., 2005) made it pos-
sible to take computational approaches to this area
of study (DaumeÃÅ III and Campbell, 2007).

Murawaki (2015) pursued a pipeline approach
to utilizing typological features for phylogenetic
inference. Exploiting interdependencies found
among features, Murawaki (2015) first mapped
each language, represented as a sequence of sur-
face features, into a sequence of continuous latent
components. It was in this continuous space that
phylogenetic relations among languages were sub-
sequently inferred. Murawaki (2015) argued that
since the conversion and the resulting latent repre-
sentations were designed to reflect typological nat-
uralness, reconstructed ancestral languages were
also likely to be typologically natural.

In this paper, however, we show that Murawaki
(2015) rests on fragile underpinnings so that they
need to be rebuilt. One of the most important
problems underestimated by Murawaki (2015) is
an alarmingly large number of missing values.
The dataset is a matrix where languages are rep-
resented as rows and features as columns, but only
less than 30% of the items are present after a mod-
est preprocessing. What is worse, the situation is
unlikely to change in the foreseeable future be-
cause of the thousands of languages in the world,
there is ample documentation for only a handful.
These missing values pose serious difficulties for
statistical modeling. Ignoring uncertainty in data,
however, Murawaki (2015) relied on point esti-
mates of missing values provided by an existing
method of imputation when inducing latent repre-
sentations. In this paper, we take a Bayesian ap-
proach because it is known for its robustness in

mean broad topics including sound laws, cognates, and his-
torical changes in inflectional paradigms.

modeling uncertainties. We demonstrate that we
can jointly infer missing values and latent repre-
sentations.

Another question left unanswered is how good
the induced representations are. In this paper, we
present two quantitative analyses of the induced
representations. The first one is rather indirect: we
measure how well a model recovers missing val-
ues, with the assumption that good representations
must capture regularity in surface features. We
show that the proposed method outperformed the
pipelined imputation method of Murawaki (2015)
among others.

The second analysis involves geography. It is
well known that the values of a surface feature
do not distribute randomly in the world but reflect
vertical (phylogenetic) transmissions from parents
to children and horizontal (spatial or areal) trans-
missions between populations (Nichols, 1992).
For example, languages of Mainland Southeast
Asia are known for having similar tone systems
even though they belong to different language
families. To measure the degrees of the two
modes of transmissions, we use an autologistic
model that investigates dependencies among lan-
guages (Towner et al., 2012; Yamauchi and Mu-
rawaki, 2016). Since it requires the input to
be discrete, we evaluate a new model that fo-
cuses on inter-feature dependencies in the same
way as Murawaki (2015) but induces binary la-
tent representations. We show that vertical and
horizontal signals observed for surface features
largely vanish from latent representations when
only inter-feature dependencies are exploited. Al-
though not directly applicable to the model of Mu-
rawaki (2015), our results suggest that the pipeline
approach suffers from noise during phylogenetic
inference. To address this problem, we extend
the induction model to incorporate the autologistic
model at the level of latent representations, rather

than surface features. With this integrated model,
we manage to let induced representations retain
surface signals.

In the end, the Bayesian generative model we
propose induces binary latent representations by
combining inter-feature dependencies and inter-
language dependencies, with primacy given to the
former (Figure 1). Whereas inter-feature depen-
dencies are synchronic in nature, inter-language
dependencies reflect diachrony. Thus we call the
integrated model diachrony-aware induction.

Due to space limitation, we had to put technical
details into the supplementary material. However,
we would like to stress that the proposed model
works only if it is armed with statistical techniques
rarely found in the NLP literature. Together with
missing values and binary representations, a large
number of continuous variables that connect bi-
nary representations to surface features need to
be inferred. Unfortunately, a naƒ±Ãàve Metropolis-
Hastings algorithm does not converge within real-
istic time scales. We solve this problem by adopt-
ing Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (Neal, 2011) since
it enables us to efficiently sample a large num-
ber of continuous variables at once. Likewise, the
autologistic model contains an intractable normal-
ization term, which prevents the application of the
standard Metropolis-Hastings sampler. We use an
approximate sampler instead (Liang, 2010).

2 Related Work
2.1 Inter-feature Dependencies
Interdependencies among features have long been
observed across the world‚Äôs languages. For exam-
ple, OV (object-verb) languages tend to be AN for
the order of adjective and noun. Greenberg (1963)
proposed dozens of such patterns known as lin-
guistic universals. A statistical model for discov-
ering Greenbergian universals was presented by
DaumeÃÅ III and Campbell (2007). Itoh and Ueda
(2004) used the Ising model to model the interac-

452



tion between features. Although these studies en-
tirely focused on surface patterns, they imply the
presence of some latent structure behind these sur-
face features.

Some generative linguists argue for the ex-
istence of binary latent parameters behind sur-
face features although they are controversial even
among generative linguists (Boeckx, 2014). We
borrow the term parameter from generative lin-
guistics because the name of feature is reserved
for surface variables.

Parameters are part of the principles and pa-
rameters (P&P) framework (Chomsky and Las-
nik, 1993), where, the structure of a language
is explained by (1) a set of universal principles
that are common to all languages and (2) a set of
parameters whose values vary among languages.
Here we skip the former since our focus is on
structural variability. According to P&P, if we
set specific values to all the parameters, then we
obtain a specific language. Each parameter is
binary and, in general, sets the values of mul-
tiple surface features in a deterministic manner.
For example, the head directionality parameter
is either head-initial or head-final. If
head-initial is chosen, then surface features
are set to VO, NA and Prepositions; other-
wise the language in question becomes OV, AN and
Postpositions (Baker, 2002). Baker (2002)
discussed a number of parameters such as head
directionality, polysynthesis, and topic prominent
parameters.

Partly inspired by the P&P framework, we use
a sequence of binary variables as the latent rep-
resentation of a language. However, there are
non-negligible differences between P&P and ours,
which are discussed in Section S.2 of the supple-
mentary material.

What the structure behind surface features looks
like is almost exclusively discussed by generative
linguists, but it should be noted that they are not
the only group who attempts to explain surface
patterns. Roughly speaking, generative linguists
are part of the synchronist camp, as contrasted
with diachronists, who consider that at least some
patterns observed in surface features arise from
common paths of diachronic development (Ander-
son, 2016). An important factor of diachronic de-
velopment is grammaticalization, by which con-
tent words change into function words (Heine and
Kuteva, 2007). For example, the correlation be-

tween the order of adposition and noun and the
order of genitive and noun might be explained by
the fact that adpositions often derive from nouns.

2.2 Inter-language Dependencies
The standard model for phylogenetic inference is
the tree model, where a trait is passed on from a
parent to a child with occasional modifications.
In fact, the recent success in the applications of
statistical models to historical linguistic problems
is largely attributed to the tree model (Gray and
Atkinson, 2003; Bouckaert et al., 2012). In lin-
guistic typology, however, a non-tree-like mode of
evolution has emerged as one of the central top-
ics (Trubetzkoy, 1928; Campbell, 2006). Typo-
logical features, like loanwords, can be borrowed
from one language to another, and as a result, ver-
tical (phylogenetic) signals are obscured by hori-
zontal (spatial) transmission.

The task of incorporating both vertical and hor-
izontal transmissions within a statistical model of
evolution is notoriously challenging because of the
excessive flexibility of horizontal transmissions.
This is the reason why previously proposed mod-
els are coupled with some very strong assump-
tions, for example, that a reference tree is given a
priori (Nelson-Sathi et al., 2010), and that horizon-
tal transmissions can be modeled through time-
invariant areal clusters (DaumeÃÅ III, 2009).

Consequently, we pursue a line of research
in linguistic typology that draws on information
on the current distribution of typological features
without explicitly requiring the reconstruction of
previous states (Nichols, 1992, 1995; Parkvall,
2008; Wichmann and Holman, 2009). The ba-
sic assumption is that if the feature in question is
vertically stable, then a phylogenetically defined
group of languages will tend to share the same
value. Similarly, if the feature in question is hor-
izontally diffusible, then spatially close languages
would be expected to frequently share the same
feature value. Since the current distribution of ty-
pological features is more or less affected by these
factors, we need to disentangle the effects of each
of these factors. To do this, Yamauchi and Mu-
rawaki (2016) adopted a variant of the autologis-
tic model, which had been widely used to model
the spatial distribution of a feature (Besag, 1974;
Towner et al., 2012). The model was also used
to impute missing values because the phylogenetic
and spatial neighbors of a language had some pre-
dictive power over its feature values.

3 Data and Preprocessing

The dataset we used in the present study is the
online edition2 of the World Atlas of Language
Structures (WALS) (Haspelmath et al., 2005).
While Greenberg (1963) and generative linguists
have manually induced patterns and parameters,
WALS makes it possible to take computational
approaches to modeling features (DaumeÃÅ III and
Campbell, 2007; DaumeÃÅ III, 2009; Murawaki,
2015; Takamura et al., 2016; Murawaki, 2016).

WALS is essentially a matrix where languages
are represented as rows and features as columns.
As of 2017, it contained 2,679 languages and 192
surface features. It covered less than 15% of items
in the matrix, however.

We removed sign languages, pidgins and cre-
oles from the matrix. We imputed some missing
values that could trivially be inferred from other
features. We then removed features that covered
less than 10% of the languages. After the pre-
processing, the number of languages L was 2,607
while the number of features N was reduced to
104. The coverage went up to 26.9%, but the rate
was still alarmingly low.

In WALS, languages are accompanied by addi-
tional information. We used the following fields
to model inter-language dependencies. (1) gen-
era, the lower of the two-level phylogenetic group-
ings, and (2) single-point geographical coordi-
nates (longitude and latitude). By connecting ev-
ery pair of languages within a genus, we con-
structed a phylogenetic neighbor graph. A spatial
neighbor graph was constructed by linking all lan-
guage pairs that were located within a distance of
R = 1000 km. On average, each language had
30.8 and 89.1 neighbors, respectively.

The features in WALS are categorical. For
example, Feature 81A, ‚ÄúOrder of Subject, Ob-
ject and Verb‚Äù has seven possible values: SOV,
SVO, VSO, VOS, OVS, OSV and No dominant
order, and each language incorporates one of
these seven values. For each language, we ar-
ranged its features into a sequence. A sequence
of categorical features can alternatively be repre-
sented as a binary sequence using the 1-of-Fi cod-
ing scheme: Feature i with Fi possible values was
converted into Fi binary items among which only
one item takes 1. The number of binarized features
M was 723.

4 Proposed Method

Since the proposed model is rather complicated,
we present two key components before going into
the integrated model. Table 1 shows notations
used in this paper. Surface features have two ways
of indexing. First, feature values are serialized as
(1, 1), ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑, (1, F1), (2, 1), ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑, (i, j), ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑, (N,FN ),
where (i, j) points to feature i‚Äôs j-th value. Then
they are given the flat index 1, ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ,m, ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ,M
(M =

‚àëN
i=1 Fi). Two indices are mapped by the

function f(i, j) = m. We need the flat repre-
sentation because that is what latent parameters
work on. A parameter is expected to capture the
relation between one feature‚Äôs particular value
(e.g., VO for the order of object and verb) and
another feature‚Äôs particular value (NA for the order
of adjective and noun).

4.1 Inter-feature Dependencies
Figure 2 illustrates how surface features are gen-
erated from binary latent parameters. We use ma-
trix factorization (Srebro et al., 2005; Griffiths and
Ghahramani, 2011) to capture inter-feature depen-
dencies. Since categorical feature matrix X can-
not directly be decomposed into two, we first con-
struct (unnormalized) feature score matrix ŒòÃÉ and
then stochastically generate X using ŒòÃÉ.

ŒòÃÉ is a product of binary parameter matrix Z and
weight matrix W . The generation of Z will be de-
scribed in Section 4.2.3 Each item of ŒòÃÉ, Œ∏ÃÉl,m, is a
score for language l‚Äôs m-th binarized feature. It is
affected only by parameters with zl,k = 1 because

Œ∏ÃÉl,m =
K‚àë

k=1

zl,kwk,m. (1)

3 Although the natural choice for modeling binary la-
tent matrices is an Indian buffet process (IBP) (Griffiths and
Ghahramani, 2011), we do not take this approach for reasons
we explain in Section S.1 of the supplementary material.

Figure 2: Stochastic parameter-to-feature generation. ŒòÃÉ = ZW encodes inter-feature dependencies.

We locally apply normalization to ŒòÃÉ to obtain
Œò, in which Œ∏l,i,j is the probability of language l
taking value j for categorical feature i

Œ∏l,i,j =
exp(Œ∏ÃÉl,f(i,j))‚àë
j‚Ä≤ exp(Œ∏ÃÉl,f(i,j‚Ä≤))

. (2)

Finally, language l‚Äôs i-th categorical feature, xl,i,
is generated from this distribution.

P (xl,i | zl,‚àó,W ) = Œ∏l,i,xl,i , (3)

where zl,‚àó = (zl,1, ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ , zl,K).
Combining Eqs. (1) and (2), we obtain

Œ∏l,i,j ‚àù exp(
K‚àë

k=1

zl,kwk,f(i,j))

=
K‚àè

k=1

exp(zl,kwk,f(i,j)). (4)

We can see from Eq. (4) that this is a product-
of-experts model (Hinton, 2002). If zl,k =
0, parameter k has no effect on Œ∏l,i,j because
exp(zl,kwk,f(i,j)) = 1. Otherwise, if wk,f(i,j) >
0, it makes Œ∏l,i,j larger, and if wk,f(i,j) < 0, it low-
ers Œ∏l,i,j .

Suppose that for parameter k, a certain group
of languages takes zl,k = 1. If two categorical
feature values (i1, j1) and (i2, j2) have positive
weights (i.e., wk,f(i1,j1) > 0 and wk,f(i2,j2) > 0),
the pair must often co-occur in these languages.
Likewise, the fact that two feature values do not
co-occur can be encoded as a positive weight for
one value and a negative weight for the other.

4.2 Inter-language Dependencies
The autologistic model is used to generate each
column of Z, z‚àó,k = (z1,k, ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ , zL,k). To con-
struct the model, we use two neighbor graphs and
the corresponding three counting functions, as il-
lustrated in Figure 3. V (z‚àó,k) returns the number

of pairs sharing the same value in the phylogenetic
neighbor graph, and H(z‚àó,k) is the spatial equiva-
lent of V (z‚àó,k). U(z‚àó,k) gives the number of lan-
guages that take the value 1.

We now introduce the following variables: ver-
tical stability vk > 0, horizontal diffusibility hk >
0, and universality ‚àí‚àû < uk < ‚àû for each fea-
ture k. Then the probability of z‚àó.k conditioned on
vk, hk and uk is given as

P (z‚àó,k | vk, hk, uk) =

exp
(
vkV (z‚àó,k) + hkH(z‚àó,k) + ukU(z‚àó,k)

)
‚àë

z‚Ä≤‚àó,k
exp
(
vkV (z‚Ä≤‚àó,k) + hkH(z

‚Ä≤
‚àó,k) + ukU(z

‚Ä≤
‚àó,k)
) .

The denominator is a normalization term, ensuring
that the sum of the distribution equals one.

The autologistic model can be interpreted in
terms of the competition associated with possible
assignments of z‚àó,k for the probability mass 1. If
a given value, z‚àó,k, has a relatively large V (z‚àó,k),
then setting a large value for vk enables it to appro-
priate fractions of the mass from its weaker rivals.
However, if too large a value is set for vk, then it
will be overwhelmed by its stronger rivals.

To acquire further insights into the model, let
us consider the probability of language l taking
value b ‚àà {0, 1}, conditioned on the rest of the
languages, z‚àíl,k:

P (zl,k = b | z‚àíl,k, vk, hk, uk) ‚àù
exp (vkVl,k,b + hkHl,k,b + ukb) , (5)

where Vl,k,b is the number of language l‚Äôs phy-
logenetic neighbors that assume value b, and
Hl,k,b is its spatial counterpart. P (zl,k = b |
z‚àíl,k, vk, hk, uk) is expressed by the weighted lin-
ear combination of the three factors in the log-
space. It will increase with a rise in the number of
phylogenetic neighbors that assume value b. How-
ever, this probability depends not only on the phy-

How strongly these factors affect the stochastic se-
lection is controlled by vk, hk, and uk.

4.3 Integrated Model

Now we complete the generative model by inte-
grating the two types of dependencies. The joint
distribution is defined as

P (A,Z,W,X)=P (A)P (Z|A)P (W )P (X|Z,W ),

where hyperparameters are omitted for brevity and
A is a set of latent variables that control the gener-
ation of Z:

P (A) =
K‚àè

k=1

P (vk)P (hk)P (uk).

Their prior distributions are: vk ‚àº Gamma(Œ∫, Œ∏),
hk ‚àº Gamma(Œ∫, Œ∏), and uk ‚àº N (0, œÉ2).4

Next, z‚àó,k‚Äôs are generated as described in Sec-
tion 4.2:

P (Z | A) =
K‚àè

k=1

P (z‚àó,k | vk, hk, uk).

The generation of Z is followed by that of the
corresponding weight matrix W ‚àà RK√óM , and
then we obtain the feature score matrix ŒòÃÉ = ZW .
Each item of W , wk,m, is generated from Stu-
dent‚Äôs t-distribution with 1 degree of freedom. We
choose this distribution for two reasons. First,
it has heavier tails than the Gaussian distribution
and allows some weights to fall far from 0. Sec-
ond, our inference algorithm demands that the
negative logarithm of the probability density func-
tion be differentiable (see Section S.4 for details).

4 In the experiments, we set shape Œ∫ = 1, scale Œ∏ = 1,
and standard deviation œÉ = 10. These priors were not non-
informative, but they were sufficiently gentle in the regions
where these parameters typically resided.

The t-distribution satisfies the condition while the
Laplace distribution does not.

Finally, X is generated using ŒòÃÉ = ZW , as de-
scribed in Section 4.1:

P (X | Z,W ) =
L‚àè

l=1

N‚àè
i=1

P (xl,i | zl,‚àó,W ).

4.4 Inference

As usual, we use Gibbs sampling to perform pos-
terior inference. Given observed values xl,i, we
iteratively update zl,k, vk, hk, uk, and wk,‚àó as well
as missing values xl,i.

Update xl,i. xl,i is sampled from Eq. (3).

Update zl,k. The posterior probability
P (zl,k | ‚àí) is proportional to Eq. (5) times
the product of Eq. (3) for all feature i‚Äôs of
language l.

Update vk, hk and uk. We want to sample vk
(and hk and uk) from P (vk | ‚àí) ‚àù P (vk)P (z‚àó,k |
vk, hk, uk). This belongs to a class of problems
known as sampling from doubly-intractable distri-
butions (M√∏ller et al., 2006; Murray et al., 2006).
While it remains a challenging problem in statis-
tics, it is not difficult to approximately sample
the variables if we give up theoretical rigorous-
ness (Liang, 2010). The details of the algorithm
we use can be found in Section S.3 of the supple-
mentary material.

Update wk,‚àó. The remaining problem is how to
update wk,m. Since the number of weights is very
large (K √ó M ), the simple Metropolis-Hastings
algorithm (GoÃàruÃàr et al., 2006; Doyle et al., 2014)
is not a workable option. To address this problem,
we block-sample wk,‚àó = (wk,1, ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ , wk,M ) using
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) (Neal, 2011). A
sketch of the algorithm can be found in Section S.4
of the supplementary material.

5 Experiments

5.1 Missing Value Imputation
We indirectly evaluated the proposed model,
called SYNDIA, by means of missing value im-
putation. If it predicts missing feature values bet-
ter than reasonable baselines, we can say that the
induced parameters are justified. Although no
ground truth exists for the missing portion of the
dataset, missing value imputation can be evaluated
by hiding some observed values and verifying the
effectiveness of their recovery. We conducted a
10-fold cross-validation.

We ran SYNDIA with two different settings:
K = 50 and 100. We performed posterior infer-
ence for 500 iterations. After that, we collected
100 samples of xl,i for each language, one per it-
eration. For each missing value xl,i, we output the
most frequent value among the 100 samples. The
HMC parameters ÔøΩ and S were set to 0.05 and 10,
respectively.

We applied simulated annealing to the sampling
of zl,k. For the first 100 iterations, the inverse tem-
perature was increased from 0.1 to 1.0.

We compared SYNDIA with several baselines.

MFV For each categorical feature i, always out-
put the most frequent value among observed xl,i.

Surface-DIA An autologistic model applied to
surface features (Yamauchi and Murawaki,
2016). The details of the model are presented in
Section S.5 of the supplementary material.

DPMPM A Dirichlet process mixture of multino-
mial distributions with a truncated stick-breaking
construction (Si and Reiter, 2013) used by Blasi
et al. (2017). It assigns a single categorical latent
variable to each language. As an implementa-
tion, we used the R package NPBayesImpute.

MCA A variant of multiple correspondence anal-
ysis (Josse et al., 2012) used by Murawaki
(2015). We used the imputeMCA function of
the R package missMDA.

SYN A simplified version of SYNDIA, with vk
and hk removed from the model. See Section S.6
of the supplementary material for details.

MFV and Surface-DIA can be seen as the models
of inter-language dependencies while DPMPM,
MCA and SYN are these of inter-feature depen-
dencies.

Table 2 shows the result. We can see that
SYNDIA with K = 50 performed the best.

Table 3: Ablation experiments for missing value
imputation. K = 50.

Smaller K yielded higher accuracy although the
likelihood P (X | Z,W ) went up as K increased.
Due to the high ratio of missing values, the model
might have overfitted the data with larger K.

The fact that SYN outperformed Surface-DIA
suggests that inter-feature dependencies have
more predictive power than inter-language depen-
dencies in the dataset. However, they are compli-
mentary in nature as SYNDIA outperformed SYN.

We can confirm the limited expressive power
of single categorical latent variables because
DPMPM performed poorly even if a small value
was set to the truncation level K‚àó to avoid over-
fitting. MCA employs more expressive represen-
tations of a sequence of continuous variables for
each language. It slightly outperformed DPMPM
but was beaten by SYN by a large margin. We con-
jecture that MCA was more sensitive to initializa-
tion than the Bayesian model armed with MCMC
sampling. In any case, this result indicates that the
latent representations Murawaki (2015) obtained
were of poorer quality than those of SYN, not to
mention those of SYNDIA.

We also conducted ablation experiments by re-
moving either vk or hk from the model. The result
is shown in Table 3. It turned out that the horizon-
tal factor had stronger predictive power than the
vertical factor, which has a negative implication
on typology-based phylogenetic inference.

Figure 4: Scatter plots of surface features and induced parameters, with vertical stability vi (vk) as the
y-axis and horizontal diffusibility hi (hk) as the x-axis. Larger vi (hi) indicates that feature i is more
stable (diffusible). Comparing the absolute values of a vi and an hi makes no sense because they are tied
with different neighbor graphs. Features are classified into 9 broad categories (called Area in WALS). vk
(and hk) is the geometric mean of the 100 samples. The induction models are SYNDIA (Top) and SYN
(Bottom). For both models, K = 50.

5.2 Vertical and Horizontal Signals

Hereafter we use all observed features to perform
posterior inference. We examined how vertically
stable and horizontally diffusible the induced pa-
rameters were. For SYNDIA, we simply extracted
vk and hk from posterior samples. For compari-
son, we used Surface-DIA to estimate vertical sta-
bility and horizontal diffusibility of surface fea-
tures. The same autologistic model was used to
estimate vk and hk of SYN after the posterior in-
ference. For details, see Sections S.5 and S.6.2 of
the supplementary material.

Figure 4 summarizes the results. We can see
that the most vertically stable latent parameters of
SYNDIA are comparable to the most vertically sta-
ble surface features. The same holds for the most
horizontally diffusible ones. Thus we can con-
clude that the induced representations retain ver-

tical and horizontal signals observed for surface
features.

On the other hand, SYN halved vertical stabil-
ity and horizontal diffusibility when transform-
ing surface features into latent parameters. A
plausible explanation of this failure is that for
many scarcely documented languages, we sim-
ply did not have enough observed surface fea-
tures to determine their latent representations only
from inter-feature dependencies. Due to the in-
herent uncertainty, zl,k swung between 0 and 1
during posterior inference, regardless of the states
of their neighbors. As a result, these languages
seem to have blocked vertical and horizontal sig-
nals. By contrast, SYNDIA appears to have flipped
zl,k without disrupting inter-language dependen-
cies when there were.

ative implications for the pipeline approach pur-
sued by Murawaki (2015), where the inter-feature
dependency-based induction of latent representa-
tions is followed by phylogenetic inference. For-
tunately, evidence presented up to this point sug-
gests that it can be readily replaced with the pro-
posed model.

5.3 Discussion

Figure 5 compares a latent parameter of SYNDIA
with a surface feature on the world map. Some
surface features show several geographic clusters
of large size, telling something about the evolu-
tionary history of languages. Even with a large
number of missing values, SYNDIA yielded com-
parable geographic clusters for some parameters.
Some geographic clusters were also produced by
SYN, especially when the estimation of zl,k was
stable. In our subjective evaluation, SYNDIA ap-
peared to show clearer patterns than SYN. Need-
less to say, not all surface features were associated
with clear geographic patterns, and not all latent
parameters were. Overall, the results shed a posi-
tive light on the applicability of the induced repre-
sentations to phylogenetic inference.

We also checked the weight matrix W (Fig-

ure S.2). It is not easy to analyze qualitatively but
it deserves future investigation.

6 Conclusion

In this paper, we presented a Bayesian model
that induces binary latent parameters from sur-
face features of linguistic typology. We combined
inter-language dependencies with inter-feature de-
pendencies to obtain the latent representations
of better quality. Gathering various statisti-
cal techniques, we managed to create the com-
plex but workable model. The source code is
publicly available at https://github.com/
murawaki/latent-typology.

We pointed out that typology-based phyloge-
netic inference proposed by Murawaki (2015)
had weak foundations, and we rebuilt them from
scratch. The whole long paper was needed to do
so, but our ultimate goal is the same as the one
stated by Murawaki (2015). In the future, we
would like to utilize the new latent representations
to uncover the evolutionary history of languages.
