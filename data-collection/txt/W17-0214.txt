Abstract

This paper presents a machine translation
system between Finnish and North Sámi,
two Uralic languages. In this paper we
concentrate on the translation direction to
Finnish. As a background, the differ-
ences between the two languages is pre-
sented, followed by how the system was
designed to handle some of these differ-
ences. We then provide an evaluation of
the system’s performance and directions
for future work.

1 Introduction0

This paper presents a prototype shallow-transfer
rule-based machine translation system between
Finnish and North Sámi. The paper will be laid out
as follows: Section 2 gives a short review of some
previous work in the area of Uralic-Uralic lan-
guage machine translation; Section 3 introduces
Finnish and North Sámi and compares their gram-
mar; Section 4 describes the system and the tools
used to construct it; Section 5 gives a preliminary
evaluation of the system; and finally Section 6 de-
scribes our aims for futurework and some conclud-
ing remarks.

2 Previous work

Within the Apertium platform, work on several
MT systems from North Sámi to Norwegian and
to other Sámi languages have been developed (Ty-
ers et al., 2009; Wiechetek et al., 2010; Trosterud
and Unhammer, 2013; Antonsen et al., 2016)).
Besides these systems, several previous works
on making machine translation systems between
Uralic languages exist, although to our knowledge
none are publicly available, except for North Sámi

to Norwegian1, and the translation between Esto-
nian, Finnish and Hungarian being available via
English as a pivot language in Google Translate.2
For non-Uralic pairs there are also numerous sim-
ilarly laid out systems e.g. in Apertium’s Turkic
pairs, e.g. (Salimzyanov et al., 2013), that can of-
fer insights on how the pair is implemented, which
are detailed later in the article but the main parts
are the same.

3 The languages

North Sámi and Finnish belong to the Sámi and
Finnic branches of the Uralic languages, respec-
tively. The languages are mutually unintelligi-
ble, but grammatically quite similar. The ortho-
graphical conventions between Finnish and North
Sámi written in Finland were quite similar until
1979, when an unified North Sámi orthography
widened the distance to Finnish. Finnish is pri-
marily spoken in Finland, where it is the national
language, sharing status with Swedish as an offi-
cial language. The total number of speakers is at
least 6 million people. North Sámi is spoken in
the Northern parts of Norway, Sweden and Fin-
land by approximately 24.700 people, and it has,
alongside the national language, some official sta-
tus in the municipalities and counties where it is
spoken. North Sámi speakers are bilingual in their
mother tongue and in their respective national lan-
guage, many also speak the neighbouring official
language. An MT system between North Sámi
and Finnish is potentially of great use to the lan-
guage communities, although fulfilling different
functions. In Finland, it may be used to understand
Sámi text, and in Norway and Sweden, it may be
used byNorth Sámi speakers to understand Finnish
text. In principle, the system may also be used for
North Sámi text production, although further de-

velopment will be needed to fulfil such a function.

3.1 Phonological differences
As related languages, Finnish and North Sámi
share several phonological processes, the most
important one being consonant gradation. How-
ever, North Sámi consonant gradation involves the
vast majority of stem-internal consonant clusters,
whereas the Finnish counterpart involves only the
stops p, t, k. Vowel length has a more central role
in Finnish than in North Sámi, Several instances
of final vowel apocopy in North Sámi, as well as
a neutralisation of p, t, k in word-final position,
has also resulted in quite extensive morphological
homonymy. A richer inventory of affricates and
fricatives in North Sámi, as well as preaspiration,
also add to the difference.

3.2 Orthographic differences
In the native vocabulary, neither Finnish nor North
Sámi distinguish between voiced and unvoiced
plosives, but whereas Finnish writes them as p,
t, k, North Sámi writes b, d, g, as in kirja : girji
“book”. Finnish marks vowel length with double
letter symbols. In North Sámi this distinction is
marked for one vowel only, a, and with acute ac-
cent. Apart from this the orthographic principles of
the two languages is quite similar, the almost total
lack of free rides is a result of different phonology.

3.3 Morphological differences
There are a number of examples where the mor-
phologies of Finnish and North Sámi are rather dif-
ferent.
North Sámi has a separate dual number, whereas

Finnish has not. Otherwise the North Sámi and
Finnish finite verb morphology is almost identi-
cal. The infinite verb conjugation is more differ-
ent, though: Finnish has a rich array of infinitives
that are inflected in different subsets of the case
system.
Finnish has more than twice the number of cases

as North Sámi has. Where North Sámi only has
one case for the direct object (accusative), Finnish
has two (accusative and partitive). The Finnish
system of adverbial cases consist of a 2x3matrix of
inner/outer to/in/from cases, North Sámi has only
one of these distinctions (to/in˜from), thus the 6
Finnish cases corresponds to 2 North Sámi ones.
In principle, Finnish andNorth Sámi have the same
system of possessive suffixes, but in North Sámi its
use is far more restricted than in Finnish.

3.4 Syntactic differences

Syntactically speaking, there are two varieties of
North Sámi, one used within and one outside of
Finland. The Finnish variety is much closer to
Finnish than the Scandinavian one. Comparing
Finnish with the Scandinavian variety of North
Sámi, themost striking difference is participle con-
structions vs. relative clauses. Where North Sámi
uses subordinate clauses, written Finnish often use
head-final participle constructions instead. Since
both varieties are found in Finnish, at least to some
degree, we at the moment let most “Scandinavian”
varieties of North Sámi through, thereby giving
North Sámi from Norway and Finland a different
stylistic flavour in the Finnish output.
The North Sámi passive is a derivational pro-

cess, whereas it for Finnish is an inflectional one,
resulting in quite different syntactic patterns for
passive. Finnish has a richer array of indefinite
verb forms.
Finnish adjectives agree with their head noun in

case and number, whereas North Sámi has an in-
variant attribute form for all but one adjective, the
adjective buorre ‘good’, and partial agreement for
determiners.
Existential and habitive clauses have the same

structure in the two languages, possessor.local-
case copula possessed and adverbial copula e-
subject (on me / in street is car ‘I have a car/There
is a car in the street’). except that in Finnish, the
possessed/e-subject behaves like objects, whereas
it in North Sámi they behave like subjects. Thus, in
North Sámi, the copula agrees with the possessed
/ e-subject, whereas in Finnish, it does not.

4 System

The system is based on the Apertium3 machine
translation platform (Forcada et al., 2011). The
platform was originally aimed at the Romance lan-
guages of the Iberian peninsula, but has also been
adapted for other, more distantly related, language
pairs. The whole platform, both programs and
data, are licensed under the Free Software Foun-
dation’s General Public Licence4 (GPL) and all
the software and data for the 30 released language
pairs (and the other pairs beingworked on) is avail-
able for download from the project website.

4.1 Architecture of the system

The Apertium translation engine consists of a
Unix-style pipeline or assembly line with the fol-
lowing modules (see Figure 1):

• A deformatter which encapsulates the format
information in the input as superblanks that
will then be seen as blanks between words by
the other modules.

• A morphological analyser which segments
the text in surface forms (SF) (words, or,
where detected, multiword lexical units or
MWLUs) and for each, delivers one or more
lexical forms (LF) consisting of lemma, lexi-
cal category and morphological information.

• A morphological disambiguator (CG) which
chooses, using linguistic rules the most ade-
quate sequence of morphological analyses for
an ambiguous sentence.

• A lexical transfer module which reads each
SL LF and delivers the corresponding target-
language (TL) LF by looking it up in a bilin-
gual dictionary encoded as an FST compiled
from the corresponding XML file. The lexi-
cal transfer module may return more than one
TL LF for a single SL LF.

• A lexical selection module (Tyers et al.,
2012b) which chooses, based on context
rules, the most adequate translation of am-
biguous source language LFs.

• A structural transfer module, which performs
local syntactic operations, is compiled from
XML files containing rules that associate an
action to each defined LF pattern. Patterns are
applied left-to-right, and the longest matching
pattern is always selected.

• A morphological generator which delivers a
TL SF for each TL LF, by suitably inflecting
it.

• A reformatter which de-encapsulates any for-
mat information.

Table 1 provides an example of a single phrase
as it moves through the pipeline.

4.2 Morphological transducers
The morphological transducers are compiled with
the Helsinki Finite State Technology (Lindén et
al., 2009),5 a free/open-source reimplementation
of the Xerox finite-state tool-chain, popular in the
field of morphological analysis. It implements
both the lexc morphology description language for
defining lexicons, and the twol and xfst script-
ing languages for modeling morphophonological
rules. This toolkit has been chosen as it—or the
equivalent XFST—has been widely used for other
Uralic languages (Koskenniemi, 1983; Pirinen,
2015; Moshagen et al., 2013), and is available un-
der a free/open-source licence. The morphologies
of both languages are implemented in lexc, and the
morphophonologies of both languages are imple-
mented in twolc.
The same morphological description is used for

both analysis and generation. To avoid overgener-
ation, any alternative forms are marked with one of
twomarks, LR (only analyser) or RL (only genera-
tor). Instead of the usual compile/invert to compile
the transducers, we compile twice, once the gen-
erator, without the LR paths, and then again the
analyser without the RL paths.

4.3 Bilingual lexicon
The bilingual lexicon currently contains 19,415
stem-to-stem correspondences (of which 8044
proper nouns) and was built partly upon an avail-
able North Sámi—Finnish dictionary6, and partly
by hand (i.e., by translating North Sámi stems
unrecognised by the morphological analyser into
Finnish). The proper nouns were taken from ex-
isting lexical resources. Entries consist largely
of one-to-one stem-to-stem correspondences with
part of speech, but also include some entries with
ambiguous translations (see e.g., Figure 2).

4.4 Disambiguation rules
The system has a morphological disambiguation
module in the form of a Constraint Grammar
(Karlsson et al., 1995). The version of the formal-
ism used is vislcg3.7 The output of each morpho-
logical analyser is highly ambiguous, measured at
around 2.4 morphological analyses per form for
Finnish and 2.6 for North Sámi8. The goal of

the CG rules is to select the correct analysis when
there are multiple analyses. Given the similarity
of Finnish and North Sámi, ambiguity across parts
of speech may often be passed from one language
to the other and not lead to many translation er-
rors. Disambiguating between forms within the
inflectional paradigms in case of homonymy, on
the other hand, are crucial for choosing the cor-
rect form of the target language, and there has
been put much effort into developing CG rules
to resolve such ambiguity for North Sámi. Cur-
rently, ambiguity is down to 1.08 for North Sámi
(analysed with the disambigator used for MT on a
675534word newspaper corpus9. The correspond-
ing number for Finnish is 1.36, for a subcorpus of
770999 words of Wikipedia text. The Finnish CG
rules are a conversion of Fred Karlsson’s original
CG1 rules for Finnish (Karlsson, 1990), and the
poorer results for Finnish are due to conversion
problems between the different CG version, and
between CG1 and our Finnish FST.

5 Evaluation

All evaluation was tested against a specific version
of Apertium SVN10 and Giellatekno SVN11. The
lexical coverage of the system was calculated over
freely available corpora of North Sámi. We used
a recent dump of Wikipedia 12 as well as a trans-
lation of the New Testament. The corpora were
divided into 10 parts each; the coverage numbers
given are the averages of the calculated percent-
ages of number of words analysed for each of these
parts, and the standard deviation presented is the

standard deviation of the coverage on each corpus.
As shown in Table 2, the naïve coverage13 of the
North Sámi to FinnishMT system over the corpora
approaches that of a broad-coverage MT system,
with one word in ten unknown.
The coverage over the Wikipedia corpus is sub-

stantially worse, due to the fact that this corpus
is “dirtier”: it contains orthographical errors, wiki
code 14, repetitions, lot of English texts, as well as
quite a few proper nouns, this is easily seen in the
large deviation between divided parts. The New
Testament on the other hand is rather well covered
and has practically uniformly distributed coverage
throughout.
To measure the performance of the translator we

used theWord Error Rate metric—an edit-distance
metric based on Levenshtein distance (Leven-
shtein, 1966). We had three small North Sámi cor-
pora along with their manually post-edited trans-
lations into Finnish to measure the WER. We
have chosen not to measure the translation qual-
ity with automatic measures such as BLEU, as
they are not the best suited to measure quality of
translations for the use case, for further details
see also Callison-Burch et al. (2006; Smith et al.
(2016; Smith et al. (2014).
For translation post-edition we used three freely

13A non-naïve coverage would require manual evaluation
of correctness for the cases where word-forms are covered
accidentally by e.g., morphological processes.

14While we have tried to clean the data from most of the
Mediawiki codes and notations, there is always some left af-
ter the cleanup, due to new wiki codes after creation of the
cleanup script or actual broken data

available parallel texts from the internet: one from
the Finnish Sámi parliament site15, one from a
Swedish regulation of minority people and lan-
guages and the story that is used with all Apertium
language pairs as initial development set (“Where
is James?”). Table 3 presents the WER for the cor-
pora.
Analysing the changes in post-edition, a few

classes of actual errors can be identified. One
common example arises from the grammatical dif-
ferences in the case system systems, in particular
the remaining adpositions are often turned into a
case suffix for the dependent noun phrase, e.g.,
the North Sámi “birra” has been turned into the
Finnish adposition “ympäri” (around), where el-
ative case is required, similarly for the transla-
tion “seassa” (among) instead of inessive case.
Also visible, especially in the story text is the
lack of possessive suffix agreement e.g. “heidän
äiti” (their mother n sg nom) instead of “heidän
äitinsä” (their mother n sp nom/gen pxsp3), while
the former is perfectly acceptable in standard spo-
ken Finnish it is not accepted as formal written lan-
guage form. Another issue that appeared a num-
ber of times, maybe partially due to the genre of
the texts selected, i.e. law texts, was the selection
of adverb (form), e.g. the word-form “mukana”
(with) was corrected to “mukaan” (according to).
A large amount of simple lexical problems is due
to the vocabulary of the selected texts as well:
“hallintoalue” (governmental area), “seurantavas-
tuu” (responsibility of surveillance), “itsehallinto”
(autonomy), and their compounds, are all either
missing or partially wrong due to lexical selec-
tions.

6 Concluding remarks

We have presented the first MT system from
Finnish to North Sámi. With a WER of above
30%, it still is far from production-level perfor-
mance, and it is also at the prototype-level in

15http://samediggi.fi

terms of the number of rules. Although the im-
pact of this relatively low number of rules on the
quality of translation is extensive (cf., the differ-
ence in WER between the development and test-
ing corpora), the outlook is promising and the cur-
rent results suggest that a high quality translation
between morphologically-rich agglutinative lan-
guages is possible. We plan to continue develop-
ment on the pair; the coverage of the system is al-
ready quite high, although we intend to increase
it to 95 % on the corpora we have we estimate
that this will mean adding around 5,000 new stems
and take 1–2 months. The remaining work will
be improving the quality of translation by adding
more rules, starting with the transfer component.
The long-term plan is to integrate the data created
with other open-source data for Uralic languages
in order to make transfer systems between all the
Uralic language pairs. Related work is currently
ongoing from North Sámi to South, Lule and Inari
Sámi, from North Sámi to Norwegian, and be-
tween Finnish and Estonian. The system presented
here is available as free/open-source software un-
der the GNU GPL and the whole system may be
downloaded from Sourceforge and the open repos-
itory of Giellatekno.
