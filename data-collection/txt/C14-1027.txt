Abstract

We present a novel approach for rapidly developing a corpus with discourse annotations using
crowdsourcing. Although discourse annotations typically require much time and cost owing to
their complex nature, we realize discourse annotations in an extremely short time while retaining
good quality of the annotations by crowdsourcing two annotation subtasks. In fact, our experi-
ment to create a corpus comprising 30,000 Japanese sentences took less than eight hours to run.
Based on this corpus, we also develop a supervised discourse parser and evaluate its performance
to verify the usefulness of the acquired corpus.

1 Introduction

Humans understand text not by individually interpreting clauses or sentences, but by linking such a text
fragment with another in a particular context. To allow computers to understand text, it is essential to
capture the precise relations between these text fragments. This kind of analysis is called discourse
parsing or discourse structure analysis, and is an important and fundamental task in natural language
processing (NLP). Systems for discourse parsing are, however, available only for major languages, such
as English, owing to the lack of corpora with discourse annotations.

For English, several corpora with discourse annotations have been developed manually, consuming a
great deal of time and cost in the process. These include the Penn Discourse Treebank (Prasad et al.,
2008), RST Discourse Treebank (Carlson et al., 2001), and Discourse Graphbank (Wolf and Gibson,
2005). Discourse parsers trained on these corpora have also been developed and practically used. To
create the same resource-rich environment for another language, a quicker method than the conventional
time-consuming framework should be sought. One possible approach is to use crowdsourcing, which
has actively been used to produce various language resources in recent years (e.g., (Snow et al., 2008;
Negri et al., 2011; Hong and Baker, 2011; Fossati et al., 2013)). It is, however, difficult to crowdsource
the difficult judgments for discourse annotations, which typically consists of two steps: finding a pair of
spans with a certain relation and identifying the relation between the pair.

In this paper, we propose a method for crowdsourcing discourse annotations that simplifies the proce-
dure by dividing it into two steps. The point is that by simplifying the annotation task it is suitable for
crowdsourcing, but does not skew the annotations for use in practical discourse parsing. First, finding a
discourse unit for the span is a costly process, and thus we adopt a clause as the discourse unit, since this
is reliable enough to be automatically detected. We also limit the length of each target document to three
sentences and at most five clauses to facilitate the annotation task. Secondly, we detect and annotate
clause pairs in a document that hold logical discourse relations. However, since this is too complicated
to assign as one task using crowdsourcing, we divide the task into two steps: determining the existence
of logical discourse relations and annotating the type of relation. Our two-stage approach is a robust
method in that it confirms the existence of the discourse relations twice. We also designed the tagset
of discourse relations for crowdsourcing, which consists of two layers, where the upper layer contains
the following three classes: “CONTINGENCY,” “COMPARISON” and “OTHER.” Although the task

settings are simplified for crowdsourcing, the obtained corpus and knowledge of discourse parsing could
be still useful in general discourse parsing.

In our experiments, we crowdsourced discourse annotations for Japanese, for which there are no pub-
licly available corpora with discourse annotations. The resulting corpus consists of 10,000 documents,
each of which comprises three sentences extracted from the web. Carrying out this two-stage crowd-
sourcing task took less than eight hours. The time elapsed was significantly shorter than the conventional
corpus building method.

We also developed a discourse parser by exploiting the acquired corpus with discourse annotations.
We learned a machine learning-based model for discourse parsing based on this corpus and evaluated its
performance. An F1 value of 37.9% was achieved for contingency relations, which would be roughly
comparable with state-of-the-art discourse parsers on English. This result indicates the usefulness of the
acquired corpus. The resulting discourse parser would be effectively exploited in NLP applications, such
as sentiment analysis (Zirn et al., 2011) and contradiction detection (Murakami et al., 2009; Ennals et
al., 2010).

The novel contributions of this study are summarized below:

• We propose a framework for developing a corpus with discourse annotations using two-stage crowd-
sourcing, which is both cheap and quick to execute, but still retains good quality of the annotations.

• We construct a Japanese discourse corpus in an extremely short time.
• We develop a discourse parser based on the acquired corpus.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces related work, while Section
3 describes our proposed framework and reports the experimental results for the creation of a corpus with
discourse annotations. Section 4 presents a method for discourse parsing based on the corpus as well as
some experimental results. Section 5 concludes the paper.

2 Related Work

Snow et al. (2008) applied crowdsourcing to five NLP annotation tasks, but the settings of these tasks
are very simple. There have also been several attempts to construct language resources with complex
annotations using crowdsourcing. Negri et al. (2011) proposed a method for developing a cross-lingual
textual entailment (CLTE) corpus using crowdsourcing. They tackled this complex data creation task by
dividing it into several simple subtasks: sentence modification, type annotation and sentence translation.
The creative CLTE task and subtasks are quite different from our non-creative task and subtasks of
discourse annotations. Fossati et al. (2013) proposed FrameNet annotations using crowdsourcing. Their
method is a single-step approach to only detect frame elements. They verified the usefulness of their
approach through an experiment on a small set of verbs with only two frame ambiguities per verb.
Although they seem to be running a larger-scale experiment, its result has not been revealed yet. Hong
and Baker (2011) presented a crowdsourcing method for selecting FrameNet frames, which is a part of
the FrameNet annotation process. Since their task is equivalent to word sense disambiguation, it is not
very complex compared to the whole FrameNet annotation process. These FrameNet annotations are
still different from discourse annotations, which are our target. To the best of our knowledge, there have
been no attempts to crowdsource discourse annotations.

There are several manually-crafted corpora with discourse annotation for English, such as the Penn
Discourse Treebank (Prasad et al., 2008), RST Discourse Treebank (Carlson et al., 2001), and Discourse
Graphbank (Wolf and Gibson, 2005). These corpora were developed from English newspaper articles.
Several attempts have been made to manually create corpora with discourse annotations for languages
other than English. These include the Potsdam Commentary Corpus (Stede, 2004) for German (news-
paper; 2,900 sentences), Rhetalho (Pardo et al., 2004) for Portuguese (scientific papers; 100 documents;
1,350 sentences), and the RST Spanish Treebank for Spanish (da Cunha et al., 2011) (several genres;
267 documents; 2,256 sentences). All of these consist of relatively small numbers of sentences com-
pared with the English corpora containing several tens of thousands sentences.

270



In recent years, there have been many studies on discourse parsing on the basis of the above hand-
annotated corpora (e.g., (Pitler et al., 2009; Pitler and Nenkova, 2009; Subba and Di Eugenio, 2009;
Hernault et al., 2010; Ghosh et al., 2011; Lin et al., 2012; Feng and Hirst, 2012; Joty et al., 2012; Joty
et al., 2013; Biran and McKeown, 2013; Lan et al., 2013)). This surge of research on discourse parsing
can be attributed to the existence of corpora with discourse annotations. However, the target language is
mostly English since English is the only language that has large-scale discourse corpora. To develop and
improve discourse parsers for languages other than English, it is necessary to build large-scale annotated
corpora, especially in a short period if possible.

3 Development of Corpus with Discourse Annotations using Crowdsourcing

3.1 Corpus Specifications

We develop a tagged corpus in which pairs of discourse units are annotated with discourse relations.
To achieve this, it is necessary to determine target documents, discourse units, and a discourse relation
tagset. The following subsections explain the details of these three aspects.

3.1.1 Target Text and Discourse Unit
In previous studies on constructing discourse corpora, the target documents were mainly newspaper
texts, such as the Wall Street Journal for English. However, discourse parsers trained on such newspaper
corpora usually have a problem of domain adaptation. That is to say, while discourse parsers trained on
newspaper corpora are good at analyzing newspaper texts, they generally cannot perform well on texts
of other domains.

To address this problem, we set out to create an annotated corpus covering a variety of domains.
Since the web contains many documents across a variety of domains, we use the Diverse Document
Leads Corpus (Hangyo et al., 2012), which was extracted from the web. Each document in this corpus
consists of the first three sentences of a Japanese web page, making these short documents suitable for
our discourse annotation method based on crowdsourcing.

We adopt the clause as a discourse unit, since spans are too fine-grained to annotate using crowdsourc-
ing and sentences are too coarse-grained to capture discourse relations. Clauses, which are automatically
identified, do not need to be manually modified since they are thought to be reliable enough. Clause
identification is performed using the rules of Shibata and Kurohashi (2005). For example, the following
rules are used to identify clauses as our discourse units:

• clauses that function as a relatively strong boundary in a sentence are adopted,

• relative clauses are excluded.

Since workers involved in our crowdsourcing task need to judge whether clause pairs have discourse
relations, the load of these workers increases combinatorially as the number of clauses in a sentence
increases. To alleviate this problem, we limit the number of clauses in a document to five. This limitation
excludes only about 5% of the documents in the original corpus.

Our corpus consists of 10,000 documents corresponding to 30,000 sentences. The total number of
clauses in this corpus is 39,032, and thus the average number of clauses in a document is 3.9. The total
number of clause pairs is 59,426.

3.1.2 Discourse Relation Tagset
One of our supposed applications of discourse parsing is to automatically generate a bird’s eye view of a
controversial topic as in Statement Map (Murakami et al., 2009) and Dispute Finder (Ennals et al., 2010),
which identify various relations between statements, including contradictory relations. We assume that
expansion relations, such as elaboration and restatement, and temporal relations are not important for this
purpose. This setting is similar to the work of Bethard et al. (2008), which annotated temporal relations
independently of causal relations. We also suppose that temporal relations can be annotated separately
for NLP applications that require temporal information. We determined the tagset of discourse relations

by referring to the Penn Discourse Treebank. This tagset consists of two layers, where the upper layer
contains three classes and the lower layer seven classes as follows:

• CONTINGENCY
– Cause/Reason (causal relations and not conditional relations)
– Purpose (purpose-action relations where the purpose is not necessarily accomplished)
– Condition (conditional relations)
– Ground (other contingency relations including pragmatic cause/condition)

• COMPARISON (same as the Penn Discourse Treebank)
– Contrast
– Concession

• OTHER (other weak relation or no relation)

Note that we do not consider the direction of relations to simplify the annotation task for crowdsourcing.
Table 1 shows examples of our tagset.

Therefore, our task is to annotate clause pairs in a document with one of the discourse relations given
above. Sample annotations of a document are shown below. Here, clause boundaries are shown by “::”
and clause pairs that are not explicitly marked are allocated the “OTHER” relation.

3.2 Two-stage Crowdsourcing for Discourse Annotations

We create a corpus with discourse annotations using two-stage crowdsourcing. We divide the annotation
task into the following two subtasks: determining whether a clause pair has a discourse relation excluding
“OTHER,” and then, ascertaining the type of discourse relation for a clause pair that passes the first stage.

> 0.001 12,277
> 0.0001 15,554

Table 2: Number of clause pairs resulting from the judgments of discourse relation existence.

3.2.1 Stage 1: Judgment of Discourse Relation Existence
This subtask determines whether each clause pair in a document has one of the following discourse
relations: Cause/Reason, Purpose, Condition, Ground, Contrast, and Concession (that is, all the relations
except “OTHER”). Workers are shown examples of these relations and asked to determine only the
existence thereof.

In this subtask, an item presented to a worker at a particular time consists of all the judgments of
clause pairs in a document. By adopting this approach, each worker considers the entire document when
making his/her judgments.

3.2.2 Stage 2: Judgment of Discourse Relation Type
This subtask involves ascertaining the discourse relation type for a clause pair that passes the first stage.
The result of this subtask is one of the seven lower types in our discourse relation tagset. Workers
are shown examples of these types and then asked to select one of the relations. If a worker chooses
“OTHER,” this corresponds to canceling the positive determination of the existence of the discourse
relation in stage one.

In this subtask, an item is the judgment of a clause pair. That is, if a document contains more than
one clause pair that must be judged, the judgments for this document are divided into multiple items,
although this is rare.

3.3 Experiment and Discussion

We conducted an experiment of the two-stage crowdsourcing approach using Yahoo! Crowdsourcing.1

To increase the reliability of the produced corpus, we set the number of workers for each item for each
task to 10. The reason why we chose this value is as follows. While Snow et al. (2008) claimed that an
average of 4 non-expert labels per item in order to emulate expert-level label quality, the quality of some
tasks increased by increasing the number of workers to 10. We also tested hidden gold-standard items
once every 10 items to examine worker’s quality. If a worker failed these items in serial, he/she would
have to take a test to continue the task.

We obtained judgments for the 59,426 clause pairs in the 10,000 documents of our corpus in the
first stage of crowdsourcing, i.e., the subtask of determining the existence of discourse relations. We
calculated the probability of each label using GLAD2 (Whitehill et al., 2009), which was proved to
be more reliable than the majority voting. This probability corresponds to the probability of discourse
relation existence of each clause pair. Table 2 lists the results. We set a probability threshold to select
those clause pairs whose types were to be judged in the second stage of crowdsourcing. With this
threshold set to 0.01, 9,068 clause pairs (15.3% of all the clause pairs) were selected. The threshold was
set fairly low to allow low-probability judgments to be re-examined in the second stage.

Table 4: Results of the judgments of upper discourse relation types.

The discourse relation types of the 9,068 clause pairs were determined in the second stage of crowd-
sourcing. We extended GLAD (Whitehill et al., 2009) for application to multi-class tasks, and calculated
the probability of the labels of each clause pair. We assigned the label (discourse relation type) with the
highest probability to each clause pair. Table 3 gives some statistics of the results. The second column in
this table denotes the numbers of each discourse relation type, while the third column gives the numbers
of each type of clause pair with a probability higher than 0.80. Table 4 gives statistics of the results when
the lower discourse relation types are merged into the upper types. Table 5 shows some examples of the
resulting annotations.

Carrying out the two separate subtasks using crowdsourcing took approximately three hours and five
hours with 1,458 and 1,100 workers, respectively. If we conduct this task at a single stage, it would take
approximately 33 (5 hours / 0.153) hours. It would be four times longer than our two-stage approach.
Such single-stage approach is also not robust since it does not have a double check mechanism, with
which the two-stage approach is equipped. We spent 111 thousand yen and 113 thousand yen (approx-
imately 1,100 USD, respectively) for these subtasks, which would be extremely less expensive than the
projects of conventional discourse annotations.

For the examples in Table 5, we confirmed that the discourse relation types of the top four examples
were surely correct. However, we judged the type (Contrast) of the bottom example as incorrect. Since
the second clause is an instantiation of the first clause, the correct type should be “Other.” We found such
errors especially in the clause pairs with a probability lower than 0.80.

4 Development of Discourse Parser based on Acquired Discourse Corpus

To verify the usefulness of the acquired corpus with discourse annotations, we developed a supervised
discourse parser based on the corpus, and evaluated its performance. We built two discourse parsers using
the annotations of the lower and upper discourse relation types, respectively. From the annotations in the
first stage of crowdsourcing (i.e., judging the existence of discourse relations), we assigned annotations
with a probability less than 0.01 as “OTHER.” Of the annotations acquired in the second stage (i.e.,
judging discourse relation types), we adopted those with a probability greater than 0.80 and discarded
the rest. After this preprocessing, we obtained 58,135 (50,358 + 7,777) instances of clause pairs for
the lower-type discourse parser and 58,521 (50,358 + 8,163) instances of clause pairs for the upper-type

discourse parser. Of these, 4,024 (6.9%) and 4,410 (7.5%) instances, respectively, had one of the types
besides “OTHER.” We conducted experiments using five-fold cross validation on these instances.

To extract features of machine learning, we applied the Japanese morphological analyzer, JUMAN,3

and the Japanese dependency parser, KNP,4 to the corpus. We used the features listed in Table 6, which
are usually used for discourse parsing.

We adopted Opal (Yoshinaga and Kitsuregawa, 2010)5 for the machine learning implementation. This
tool enables online learning using a polynomial kernel. As parameters for Opal, we used the passive-
aggressive algorithm (PA-I) with a polynomial kernel of degree two as a learner and the extension to
multi-class classification (Matsushima et al., 2010). The numbers of classes were seven and three for the
lower- and upper-type discourse parsers, respectively. We set the aggressiveness parameter C to 0.001,
which generally achieves good performance for many classification tasks. Other parameters were set to
the default values of Opal.

To measure the performance of the discourse parsers, we adopted precision, recall and their harmonic
mean (F1). These metrics were calculated as the proportion of the number of correct clause pairs to the

number of all recognized or gold-standard ones for each discourse relation type. Tables 7 and 8 give the
accuracies for the lower- and upper-type discourse parsers, respectively.

From Table 8, we can see that our upper-type discourse parser achieved an F1 of 37.9% for contingency
relations. It is difficult to compare our results with those in previous work due to the use of different data
set and different languages. We, however, anticipate that our results would be comparable with those
of state-of-the-art English discourse parsers. For example, the end-to-end discourse parser of Lin et al.
(2012) achieved an F1 of 20.6% – 46.8% on the Penn Discourse Treebank.

We also obtained a low F1 for comparison relations. This tendency is similar to the previous results
on the Penn Discourse Treebank. The biggest cause of this low F1 is the lack of unambiguous explicit
discourse connectives for these relations. Although there are explicit discourse connectives in Japanese,
many of them have multiple meanings and cannot be used as a direct clue for discourse relation detection
(e.g., as described in Kaneko and Bekki (2014)). As reported in Pitler et al. (2009) and other studies,
the identification of implicit discourse relations are notoriously difficult. To improve its performance, we
need to incorporate external knowledge sources other than the training data into the discourse parsers.
A promising way is to use large-scale knowledge resources that are automatically acquired from raw
corpora.

5 Conclusion

We presented a rapid approach for building a corpus with discourse annotations and a discourse parser
using two-stage crowdsourcing. The acquired corpus is made publicly available and can be used for
research purposes.6 This corpus can be used not only to build a discourse parser but also to evaluate
its performance. The availability of the corpus with discourse annotations will accelerate the develop-
ment and improvement of discourse parsing. In the future, we intend integrating automatically acquired
knowledge from corpora into the discourse parsers to further enhance their performance. We also aim to
apply our framework to other languages without available corpora with discourse annotations.
