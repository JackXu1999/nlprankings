Abstract
The notions of concreteness and image-
ability, traditionally important in psy-
cholinguistics, are gaining significance in
semantic-oriented natural language pro-
cessing tasks. In this paper we investigate
the predictability of these two concepts via
supervised learning, using word embed-
dings as explanatory variables. We per-
form predictions both within and across
languages by exploiting collections of
cross-lingual embeddings aligned to a sin-
gle vector space. We show that the no-
tions of concreteness and imageability are
highly predictable both within and across
languages, with a moderate loss of up to
20% in correlation when predicting across
languages. We further show that the cross-
lingual transfer via word embeddings is
more efficient than the simple transfer via
bilingual dictionaries.

1 Introduction

Concreteness and imageability are very important
notions in psycholinguistic research, building on
the theory of the double, verbal and non-verbal,
modality of representation of concrete words in
the mental lexicon, contrasted to single verbal rep-
resentation of abstract words (Paivio, 1975, 2010).
Although often correlated with concreteness, im-
ageability is not a redundant property. While most
abstract things are hard to visualize, some call up
images, e.g., torture calls up an emotional and
even visual image. There are concrete things that
are hard to visualize too, for example, abbey is
harder to visualize than banana (Tsvetkov et al.,
2014).

Both notions have proven to be useful in com-
putational linguistics as well. Turney et al. (2011)
present a supervised model that exploits con-
creteness to correctly classify 79% of adjective-
noun pairs as having literal or non-literal mean-
ing. Tsvetkov et al. (2014) exploit both the no-
tions of concreteness and imageability to per-
form metaphor detection on subject-verb-object
and adjective-noun relations, correctly classifying
82% and 86% instances, respectively.

The aim of this paper is to investigate the pre-
dictability of concreteness and imageability within
a language, as well as across languages, by ex-
ploiting cross-lingual word embeddings as our
available signal.

2 Related Work

While much work has been done on exploiting
word embeddings in expanding sentiment lexicons
(Tang et al., 2014; Amir et al., 2015; Hamilton
et al., 2016), there is little work on predicting other
lexical variables, concreteness and imageability
included.

Tsvetkov et al. (2014) performed metaphor de-
tection, using, among others, concreteness and im-
ageability as their features. To propagate these
features, obtained from the MRC psycholinguis-
tic database (Wilson, 1988) to the entire lexicon,
they used a supervised learning algorithm on vec-
tor space representations, where each vector ele-
ment represented a feature. Performance of these
classifiers was 0.94 for concreteness and 0.85 for
imageability. They also applied the concreteness
and imageability features to other languages by
projecting features with bilingual dictionaries.

Broadwell et al. (2013) extended imageability
scores to the whole lexicon by using the MRC



218

imageability scores and hyponym and hyperonym
links from WordNet.

Rothe et al. (2016) trained an orthogonal trans-
formation to reorder word embedding dimensions
into one-dimensional ultradense subspaces, the
output thereby being a lexicon. They trained the
transformations for sentiment, concreteness and
frequency. For obtaining training data for con-
creteness, they used the BWK database (Brysbaert
et al., 2014). They showed that concreteness and
sentiment can be better extracted from embedding
spaces than frequency, with a Kendall τ correla-
tion coefficient of 0.623 for concreteness. Rothe
and Schütze (2016) further exploited this method
to perform operations over the extracted dimen-
sions, such as given a concrete word like friend,
find the related, but abstract word friendship.

Contributions In this paper we perform a sys-
tematic investigation of transfer of two lexical no-
tions, concreteness and imageability, (1) to the re-
mainder of the lexicon not covered in an annota-
tion campaign, and (2) to other languages.

While there were already successful transfers
within a language based on word embeddings
(Tsvetkov et al., 2014; Rothe and Schütze, 2016),
the only cross-lingual transfer was based on trans-
fer via bilingual dictionaries (Tsvetkov et al.,
2014). In this paper we compare the effectiveness
of cross-lingual transfer via word embeddings and
via bilingual dictionaries.

A byproduct of this research is a lexical re-
source in 77 languages containing per-word esti-
mates for concreteness and imageability.

3 Data

3.1 Lexicons

In our experiments we use two existing English
and one Croatian lexicon with concreteness and
imageability ratings.

For English we use the MRC database (Wilson,
1988) (MRC onwards), consisting of 4,293 words
with ratings for concreteness and imageability.
The ratings range from 100 to 700 and were ob-
tained by merging three different resources (Wil-
son, 1988).

We also use the BWK database consisting of
39,954 English words (Brysbaert et al., 2014)
(BWK onwards) with concreteness ratings summa-
rized through arithmetic mean and standard devi-
ation. The ratings were collected in a crowdsourc-

ing campaign in which each word was labeled by
20 annotators on a 1–5 scale.

For Croatian we use the MEGAHR database
(MEGA onwards), consisting of 3,000 words, with
concreteness and imageability ratings summarized
through arithmetic mean and standard deviation.
The ratings were collected in an annotation cam-
paign among university students, with each word
obtaining 30 annotations per variable on a 1–5
scale.

For performing cross-lingual transfer via a dic-
tionary, we use data from a large popular online
Croatian-English dictionary1 containing around
100 thousand entries.

3.2 Embeddings

For both in-language and cross-lingual experi-
ments we use the aligned Facebook collection of
embeddings2, trained with fastText (Bojanowski
et al., 2016) on Wikipedia dumps, with embed-
ding spaces aligned between languages with a lin-
ear transformation learned via SVD (Smith et al.,
2017) on a bilingual dictionary of 500 out of the
1000 most frequent English words, obtained via
the Google Translate API3.

We also experimented with another cross-
lingual embedding collection (Conneau et al.,
2017), obtaining similar results and backing all
our conclusions. This is in line with recent work
on comparing cross-lingual embedding models
which suggests that the actual choice of monolin-
gual and bilingual signal is more important for the
final model performance than the actual underly-
ing architecture (Levy et al., 2017; Ruder et al.,
2017). Given that one of our goals is to trans-
fer concreteness and imageability annotations to
as many languages as possible, using cross-lingual
word embeddings based on Wikipedia dumps and
dictionaries obtained through a translation API is
the most plausible option.

4 Experiments

4.1 Setup

We perform two sets of experiments: one within
each language, and another across languages.

While in-language experiments are always
based on supervised learning, in cross-lingual ex-
periments we compare two transfer approaches:
one based on a simple dictionary transfer, and
another on supervised learning on the word em-
beddings in the source language, and perform-
ing predictions on word embeddings in the target
language, with the two embedding spaces being
aligned.

We perform our prediction experiments by
training SVM regression models (SVR) and deep
feedforward neural networks (FFN) over standard-
ized (zero mean, unit variance) embeddings and
each specific response variable. We experiment
with all available gold annotations as our response
variables, namely both the arithmetic mean and
standard deviation of concreteness and imageabil-
ity.

We tuned the hyperparameters of each of the re-
gressors on a subset of the Croatian, MEGA dataset
in the case of the in-language experiments, and
another subset of the BWK dataset for the cross-
lingual experiments. Given that we perform the
final experiments on the whole datasets, and that
we have two additional English datasets at our dis-
posal for the in-language experiments and three
additional dataset pairs for the cross-lingual exper-
iments, we consider our approach to be resistant to
the overfitting of the hyperparameters going unno-
ticed.

While the SVR proved to work well with the
RBF kernel, theC hyperparameter of 1.0 and the γ
hyperparameter of 0.003, the feedforward network
obtained strong results with two fully-connected
hidden layers, consisting of 128 and 32 units each
and ReLU activation functions, with a dropout
layer after each of the hidden layers, and an out-
put layer with a linear activation function. We op-
timized for the mean squared error loss function
and ran 50 epochs on each of the datasets, with a
batch size of 32.

While we used the same regressor setup for
the SVR system for both the in-language and
cross-lingual experiments, for the FFN system
the dropout probability in the in-language exper-
iments was 0.5, while in the cross-lingual setting
the dropout probability was set to 0.8, obtaining
thereby a more general model which transfers bet-
ter to the other language.

We perform in-language experiments via 3-fold
cross-validation, while we train models on our

source language dataset and evaluate the models
on our target language dataset for cross-lingual
experiments. We evaluate each approach via the
Spearman rank and Pearson linear correlation co-
efficients. In the paper we report the Spear-
man correlation coefficient only as the relation-
ships across both metrics in all the experiments
are identical. We perform our experiments with
the scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011) and
keras (Chollet et al., 2015) toolkits.

4.2 In-language Experiments

We start our experiments in the in-language set-
ting, running cross-validation experiments over
each of our three datasets on all available vari-
ables. The results of these experiments, with
some basic information on the size of the datasets,
are given in Table 1. Aside from the three lex-
icons introduced in Section 3.1, we experiment
with another lexicon, BWK.3K, which is a ran-
domly downsampled version of the BWK lexicon
to the size of the two remaining lexicons. We in-
troduce this additional resource (1) to control for
dataset size when comparing results on our differ-
ent datasets and (2) to measure the impact of train-
ing data size by comparing the results on the two
flavours of the BWK dataset.

The results in Table 1 show that the support vec-
tor regressor consistently performs better than the
feedforward neural network at predicting almost
all values, with relative error reduction lying be-
tween 7% and 12%. The bold results are statis-
tically significantly better than the corresponding
non-bold ones given the approximate randomiza-
tion test (Edgington, 1969) with p < 0.05. Our as-
sumption is that the stronger FFN model does not
show a positive impact primarily due to the small
size of the datasets and the simplicity of the mod-
eling problem.

We can further observe that the arithmetic mean
is much easier to predict than standard deviation
on both variables in all the datasets. This can be
explained by the fact that standard deviation on the
two phenomena can partially be explained with the
level of ambiguity of a specific word, and this type
of information is at least not directly available in
context-based word embeddings.

Furthermore, imageability seems to be consis-
tently slightly harder to predict than concreteness.
Our initial assumption regarding this difference
was that imageability is a more vague notion for

human subjects, and therefore their responses are
more dispersed, adding to the complexity of the
prediction. However, analyzing standard devia-
tions over concreteness and imageability showed
that these are rather the same. We leave this open
question for future research.

When comparing the results on predicting mean
concreteness on the full BWK and the trimmed
BWK.3K datasets, we see a significant improve-
ment of the predictions of the on the larger dataset,
showing that having 10 times more data for learn-
ing can produce significant improvements in the
prediction quality.

4.3 Cross-lingual Experiments

In cross-lingual experiments we compare our two
approaches to cross-lingual transfer: dictionary
lookup (DIC onwards) and supervised learning on
aligned word embedding spaces via the two meth-
ods introduced in Section 4.2, SVR and FFN.

The DIC method simply looks up for each word
in the source language resource all possible trans-
lations to the target language and directly trans-
fers the concreteness and imageability ratings to
the target language words. In case of collisions
in the target language (two source language words
being translated to the same word in the target lan-
guage), we perform averaging over the transfered
ratings. In our experiments, the arithmetic mean
showed to be a better averaging method than the
median, we therefore report the results on that av-
eraging method.

The SVR and FFN methods use supervised learn-
ing in a very similar fashion to the in-language
experiments described in Section 4.2. We train a
supervised regression model on the whole source
language dataset, using word embedding dimen-

sions as features and the variable of choice as
our target. We obtain estimates of our vari-
able of choice in the target language by applying
the source-language model on the target-language
word embeddings since the two embedding spaces
are aligned.

For both approaches we compare the target-
language estimates with the gold data available
from our lexicons.

We present the results of the cross-lingual ex-
periments in Table 2. Our first observation is that,
while in the in-language setting the SVR method
has regularly outperformed the FFN method, in the
cross-lingual setting this is not the case any more,
with SVR and FFN obtaining very similar results,
in five out of six cases in the range of no statis-
tically significant difference. Our explanation for
the loss of the positive impact in using the weaker,
support vector regression model, is that with the
noisy alignment of the two embedding spaces the
prediction problem became harder, now both mod-
els performing similarly. While the strong point of
SVR is that it performs very well on small datasets,
the strong point of the FFN method is that it gener-
alizes better.

That higher generalization is beneficial in case
of the cross-lingual problem is observable in the
difference in the hyperparameter tuning results on
the FFN method, where in the in-language setting
the optimal dropout was 0.5, while in the cross-
lingual setting it is 0.8.

Our second observation is that all the predicted
ratings suffer in the cross-lingual setting, when
compared to the in-language results presented in
Table 1, observing for the SVR method a drop of
around 5 to 15%. While standard deviation was
already poorly predicted in the in-language set-

ting, in the cross-lingual setting it drops even fur-
ther to a non-useful level, below 0.2. This is the
reason why we do not calculate statistical signifi-
cance of the differences in these results and do not
include their estimates in our final 77-languages-
strong resource. In the final cross-lingual resource
we include only the mean of concreteness and
imageability, the notions for which we have ob-
tained strong correlation in our cross-lingual ex-
periments.

Finally, when comparing the cross-lingual
transfer via embeddings (SVR and FFN) and via a
dictionary (DIC), the learning-on-embeddings ap-
proach outperforms the dictionary method in each
instance, with the relative loss in correlation when
moving from the EMB to the DIC approach of 5%
to 25%.

4.4 Regressor Coefficient Analysis

Our final analysis concerns the question of how
many of the embedding dimensions are crucial for
our regressors to predict the notions of concrete-
ness and imageability. We consider two potential
scenarios: (1) each of the notions are encoded in
one or a few of the embedding dimensions and (2)
the notions are encoded in many embedding di-
mensions.

The analysis is performed by calculating the
cumulative distribution of absolute and normal-
ized (sum to 1), reversely sorted coefficients of the
SVM regressor with a linear kernel. For both phe-
nomena, concreteness and imageability, the dis-
tributions show that the predictions are based on
a significant number of embedding dimensions.
Namely, while 80 most informative dimensions
cover 50% of the coefficients’ mass, half of the
dimensions (150) cover 80% of that mass. This
shows for the second scenario – concreteness and
imageability are encoded in a significant number
of embedding dimensions – to be true.

5 Conclusion

In this paper we have shown that concreteness and
imageability ratings can be successfully transfered
both to non-covered portions of the lexicon and to
other languages via (cross-lingual) word embed-
dings.

With the in-language experiments we have
shown that the arithmetic mean of both notions is
much easier to predict than their standard devia-
tion, the latter probably encoding word ambiguity,
type of information not directly present in word
embeddings.

Our experiments across languages have shown
that the loss in comparison to in-language ex-
periments on predicting the means of both con-
creteness and imageability are around 15%, a rea-
sonable price to pay given the applicability of
the method to all of the 77 languages present
in the word embedding collection. The predic-
tions of concreteness and imageabililty obtained in
the 77 languages are available at http://hdl.
handle.net/11356/1187.4

Comparing the two methods of transfer – dic-
tionary vs. cross-lingual embeddings, shows regu-
larly better (5%–15%) results of the latter, proving
once more the usefulness of word embeddings, es-
pecially in the currently expanding cross-lingual
setup.
