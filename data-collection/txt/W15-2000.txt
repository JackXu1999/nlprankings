Preface

Even if language resources covering English tend to receive most attention in the LT com-

munity, recent years have shown an increased interest in developing lexical semantic re-

sources and semantically annotated corpora of also lesser-resourced languages, including

the languages in the Nordic and Baltic region. Nevertheless, high-quality semantic re-

sources with sufficient coverage still prove to be a serious bottleneck not only in purely

rule-based NLP applications but also in supervised corpus-based approaches. Also in the

Digital Humanities there is an increased interest in and need for semantic annotation which

would enable more refined search in, and better visualization and analyses of large-scale

corpus data.

This workshop focuses in particular on the interplay between lexical-semantic resources

as resembled by wordnets, framenets, propbanks, and others and their relation to practical

corpus annotation. The workshop – a follow-up on the successful Nodalida 2009 and 2013

workshops on semantic resources – intends to bring together researchers involved in build-

ing and integrating semantic resources (lexicons and corpora) as well as researchers who

apply these resources for semantic processing. Also researchers who are more theoretically

interested in investigating the interplay between lexical semantics, lexicography, corpus

linguistics and Digital Humanities are welcome.

For the workshop we invited papers presenting original research relating to semantic

resources for NLP and DH on topics such as:

• representation of lexical-semantic knowledge for computational use
• the interplay between lexical-semantic resources and semantically annotated corpora
• corpus-based approaches to lexical-semantic resources
• tools for semantic annotation
• terminology and lexical semantics: concept-based vs lexical semantic approaches
• monolingual vs. multilingual approaches to semantic lexicons and corpora
• quality assessment of lexical-semantic resources: criteria, methods
• applications using lexical-semantic resources (information retrieval, semantic tag-

ging of corpora, MT, Digital Humanities etc.)

• machine-learning techniques to discover semantic structures such as unsupervised
learning, distance supervision, or cross-language learning.

• traditional lexicography and NLP lexicons: re-use and differences
• applying semantic resources (lexica, corpora) for semantic processing
• word sense disambiguation based on lexically informed techniques

We received a total of 7 submissions, each of which was reviewed by at least two

(anonymous) members of the program committee (see below). On the basis of the reviews,

5 submissions were accepted for presentation at the workshop and inclusion in the work-

shop proceedings (subject to revisions required by the reviewers).

The workshop was designed to be a highly interactive event. After an invited oral pre-

sentation by Johan Bos (University of Groningen): – Issues in parallel meaning banking –

the other contributions to the workshop were presented during two oral sessions. A general

discussion concluded the workshop.
