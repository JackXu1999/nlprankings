Abstract

Interesting stories often are built around inter-
esting characters. Finding and detailing what
makes an interesting character is a real chal-
lenge, but certainly a significant cue is the
character personality traits. Our exploratory
work tests the adaptability of the current per-
sonality traits theories to literal characters, fo-
cusing on the analysis of utterances in theatre
scripts. And, at the opposite, we try to find sig-
nificant traits for interesting characters. Our
preliminary results demonstrate that our ap-
proach is reasonable. Using machine learning
for gaining insight into the personality traits of
fictional characters can make sense.

1 Introduction

The availability of texts produced by people using
the modern communication means can give an im-
portant insight in personality profiling. And com-
putational linguistic community has been quite ac-
tive in this topic. In this paper we want to explore
the use of the techniques and tools nowadays used
for user generated content, for the analysis of lit-
erary characters in books and plays. In particu-
lar we will focus on the analysis of speech utter-
ances in theatre scripts. Dialogues in theatre plays
are quite easy to collect (i.e. the characters are ex-
plicitly stated in the scripts) without the need of
lengthy and costly manual annotation.

Of course the style of the language in social me-
dia is very different. For example, usually the user
generated content is quite short in length, not al-
ways with the correct spelling and correct in syn-
tax, and nowadays full of emoticons. On the other
hand we can expect that authors of great theatre
masterpieces (e.g. Shakespeare) had exceptional
skill in rendering the personality traits of the char-
acters, just only through dialogues among them.

Computational linguistics exploits different
frameworks for the classification of psychological

traits. In particular the Five Factor Model (Big5)
is often used. Advantages and drawbacks of those
frameworks are well-known. A good reference on
this is the work by Lee and Ashton (2004). We
are interested in a broad, exploitative classifica-
tion and do not endorse a model over the others.
We choose to use the Big Five model because the
gold labeled dataset we exploited was built using
this framework.

1.1 Literature review

To our knowledge, there is little ongoing research
on personality traits recognition in literary texts.
Most of the works in literary text is focused on
other aspects such as author attribution, stylom-
etry, plagiarism detection. Regarding personality
traits recognition, the used datasets are often col-
lected from modern communication means, e.g.
messages posted in social media.

Indeed there is interest in using modern NLP
tools in literary texts, for example Grayson et al.
(2016) use word embeddings for analyzing litera-
ture, Boyd (2017) describes the current status and
tool for psychological text analysis, Flekova and
Gurevych (2015) profile fictional characters, Liu
et al. (2018) conduct a traits analysis of two fic-
tional characters in a Chinese novel.

The use of the Five Factor Model for literature
is explained in McCrae et al. (2012).

Bamman et al. (2014) consider the problem of
automatically inferring latent character types in
a collection of English novels. Bamman et al.
(2013) present a new dataset for the text-driven
analysis of film. Then they present some latent
variable models for learning character types in
movies.

Vala et al. (2015) propose a novel technique
for character detection, achieving significant im-
provements over state of the art on multiple
datasets.

2 Model Building and Evaluation

We approached the problem as a supervised learn-
ing problem, using a labeled dataset and then
transferring the result to our dataset.

In literary studies it is difficult to find a clas-
sification of characters according to some model
of personality. Literary critics often prefer to
go deeper into analyzing a character rather than
putting her/him in an simple categories.

At the basis of our model, and in general in the
framework we mentioned there is a lexical hypoth-
esis: we are, at least to some extent, allowed to in-
fer personality traits from the language and from
words. From a psychological point of view, a sup-
port to the lexical hypothesis is in Ashton and Lee
(2005). Our concern is also if those models can
be applied to theatrical scripts, where everything
is faked (and thus false) to be real (true). A cru-
cial role is played by author’s expertise in knowing
how to render in the scripts the psychological traits
of the characters.

2.1 Big5 Dataset with Gold Labels

As a labelled dataset, we used “essays”, originally
from Pennebaker and King (1999). “Essays” is
a large dataset of stream-of-consciousness texts
(about 2400, one for each author/user), collected
between 1997 and 2004 and labelled with person-
ality classes. Texts have been produced by stu-
dents who took the Big5 questionnaires. The la-
bels, that are self-assessments, are derived by z-
scores computed by Mairesse et al. (2007) and
converted from scores to nominal classes by Celli
et al. (2013) with a median split1.

The main reason behind the usage of this dataset
is that is the only one containing gold labels suit-
able for our task. For sure the fact that the material
does not match perfectly with literary text can pose
some issues, discussed later in Section 3.

2.2 Literary Dataset Building and Validation

The proposed task is to recognize the personality
of a character of a literary text, by the word s/he
says. Theatre play scripts is probably the easiest
type of literary text from which to extract charac-
ters’ dialogues.

The name of the character speaking, following
an old established convention, is at the start of the

(EXT), Agreeableness (AGR), Conscientiousness (CON),
Neuroticism (NEU), and Openness to experience (OPN).

line, usually in a bold typeface, and after a colon
“:” or a dot “.” the text of the utterance follows
until another character takes the turn or the play,
act or scene ends.

An excerpt from William Shakespeare, Hamlet,
Act III, Scene 4 shows the patterns:

[. . . ]

Hamlet. Do you see nothing there?

Gertrude. Nothing at all; yet all that is
I see.

Hamlet. Nor did you nothing hear?

Gertrude. No, nothing but ourselves.

[. . . ]

Our first candidate dataset was the Shakespeare
Corpus in NLTK by Bird et al. (2009) that consist
of several tragedies and comedies of Shakespeare
well formatted in the XML format. However the
the Shakespeare Corpus in NLTK is only a fraction
of Shakespeare’s plays. To collect more data we
looked for a larger corpus. Open Source Shake-
speare (OSS) contains all the 38 works2 (some
split in parts) commonly attributed to William
Shakespeare3, in a format good enough to easily
parse dialogue structure

In our model a character is associated to all
her/his turns as a single document. This is a sim-
plified view but good enough as a starting point.
One of the main consequences of this is a sort of
flattening of the characters and the missing of the
utterances said together at the same time by two
characters. A quick check did not spot this type
of event for two or more named characters. Very
seldom, there are some references to the charac-
ter “All” that mean all the characters on the stage
together.

We know in advance that our models to be based
on common words between the corpora, so we
quickly checked the total lemma in commons that
is 6755 over the two different corpora with roughly
60000 words each.

views/plays/plays_alpha.php.

3We acknowledge the fact that the works of William
Shakespeare are routinely used for the classical NLP task of
authorship recognition and that some attribution are still con-
troversial. But this is not in our scope. The OSS includes the
1864 Globe Edition of Shakespeare works.

2.3 Modeling
We started working on our model using the Scikit-
learn toolkit to do Machine Learning in Python
(Pedregosa et al., 2011).

The initial task was to get reasonable perfor-
mance on the “essay” dataset.

The problem falls in the class of multi-output
labels. For simplicity each label (corresponding to
a personal trait) can be treated as independent, par-
titioning the problem in 5 classification problems.

Starting from a simple bag of words model, we
added to the features the output of TextPro (Pianta
et al., 2008) for the columns: pos, chunk, entity,
and tokentype4.

The possible values of those columns are cate-
gorical variables that can be counted for each char-
acter in order to build a feature for the model.

Following the suggestion from (Celli et al.,
2013, 2014), our model was built as a pipeline in-
corporating both the bag of word model and the
output of TextPro.

We acknowledge that a lot of tweaking is pos-
sible for improving the performance of a model
(such as building a different model for each trait,
or use different features or classifier). However
that was not our primary scope.

2.4 Testing the model
The OSS dataset missed some features used in the
training and testing of the original model. We
solved the issue by adding the required features
with the initial value of 0. Since the feature are re-
lated to countable occurrences or related to ratios,
this operation is safe.

We briefly discuss a couple of models. In Ta-
ble 1 are reported the results for a simple model
that uses the bag-of-word concept and with some
POS tagging extracts the lemmas.

CON NLTK Lemma Linear SVC 0.46
EXT NLTK Lemma Linear SVC 0.45
NEU NLTK Lemma Random Forest 0.53
OPN NLTK Lemma Multinomial NB 0.61

By adding the features obtained with TextPro as
described in subsection 2.3 we gained some score
for most of the traits, for the weighted average of

each trait our results are comparable to the ones
reported by Celli et al. (2013).

The results shown in Table 2 report the best re-
sults.

cated and weighted) for Random Forest Classifier

CON NLTK Lemma + TextPro 0.45
EXT NLTK Lemma + TextPro 0.54
NEU NLTK Lemma + TextPro 0.54
OPN NLTK Lemma + TextPro 0.66

Going deeper into commenting the feature en-
gineering and comparing the models should give
us insight for understanding the linguistic features
related to personality. This requires further knowl-
edge beyond the scope of the current work and it
leaves the path open to future explorations.

3 Results and Discussion

As with our models on a known dataset we got
state of the art performance, we tried to apply
the classifier on the Shakespeare’s plays dataset.

speakers of a selected list of plays.

Shakespeare’s plays reveals some traits in com-
mon for characters that are at the opposite, like
the protagonist and the antagonist. This is the case
for “Hamlet”, the most verbose characters seem
to have similar traits. We are glad that Portia and
Antonio in “Merchant of Venice” display consci-
entiousness and Shylock neuroticism, as our shal-
low knowledge of the play remind us. A vertical
look reveals low variability for the Agreeableness,
Extraversion and Openness traits. Intuitively we
acknowledge that something strange is happening
here. Those traits are for sure related to the self-
expression, something that a character is forced to
do in a play. A model with numerical scores in-
stead of boolean values would have offered some
guidance here. In general we think that there are
some reasons for the drawbacks of the model. We
detail them in the following paragraphs.

A possible explanation is that the Big Five
model, and/or our implementation does not cap-
ture the personality traits of the characters that are
at the level that is needed. In other words, the
model is too broad. Indeed, the Big Five Model
has also the sub-classification for “Facets”, but we
do not know any public available gold standard
dataset labeled at facet level.

The idea that the Big 5 is quite limited is not
new. For example Paunonen and Jackson (2000)
sustain that the following categories are to be con-
sidered outliers of the Big 5: a) Religious, de-
vout, reverent; b) Sly, deceptive, manipulative;
c) Honest, ethical, moral; d) Sexy, sensual, erotic;
e) Thrifty, frugal, miserly; f) Conservative, tra-
ditional, down-to-earth; g) Masculine-feminine;
h) Egotistical, conceited, snobbish; i) Humorous,
witty, amusing; j) Risk-taking or Thrill-seeking.

Indeed those categories seem more appropri-
ate to describe some of the characters in Shake-
speare’s scripts.

The essays dataset does not matches the OSS
dataset along a number of dimensions. The most
relevant ones that come to our mind are: purpose,
grammar and mistakes and language diacronicity.
Purpose: the essay is stream of consciousness,
written once, probably never checked, by the au-
thor, the OSS is high quality writing, mostly where
people speak with others. Grammar and mistakes:
we think that the OSS corpus contains low rate
of spelling errors, and the formulation of the sen-
tences should be almost always correct, due to the
nature of the corpus, but of course is another thing

to check. For sure also English grammar changed,
so additional caveats may apply. Language di-
acronicity: Shakespeare’s English is not today’s
English. To what extended this has an impact need
to be verified.

Usually the personality traits are considered sta-
ble. But the need of creating tension and drama in
a play may also imply some evolution in the per-
sonality of the character. A possible insight on this
could come from a dispersion plot of the charac-
ter traits all along the play, maybe with different
granularity (one for each utterance, one for each
scene). The dispersion plot should highlight such
changes.

By following the Aristotle’s Rules (Aristote-
les, 1998) the playwright may set the dramatic
tone for an entire scene, and the personality traits
coherence may be sacrificed for this. The pre-
viously mentioned dispersion plot could show if
such changes are aligned with the scenes or the
acts. Since the acts usually are situated in dis-
tant time settings is reasonable to expect a change
in personality traits due to the development of the
character.

Our assumption that the characters’ words cap-
ture the personality traits could be not always cor-
rect. Especially for plays where there are a lot
of lies, alliances and breakages. Additional anal-
ysis taking care of the persons whom the speech
is directed may discover that the personality traits
change in relation of the recipient.

For sure there are different ways to write and
perform a play. We choose Shakespeare’s scripts
because they are a classical resource and they rely
a lot on the dialogues. But discarding the actions
may have caused the loss of information, hinder-
ing the discover of the personality trait. Indeed, an
advice for newcomers in drama writing is to build
characters by showing their actions.

Two different characters (e.g., a king and a
jester) can say the same thing, with a total different
meaning. What differentiates them is the reaction
of the others on the stage. A thorough modelling
should take into account also this type of event.
Intuitively this is used in comedies. Two different
characters say the same thing to a third person in a
short span of time. The second time the audience
will anticipate the utterance in mind and will be
delighted of the effect. In general a more detailed
investigation has to be done to highlight different

traits characterization in comedies and tragedies.
In conclusion the present work describes a first

step towards capturing the personality traits of the
characters in literary texts, in particular in the
Shakespeare’s theatre scripts. We discussed the
results and the limitation of our approach and en-
visioned possible mitigations or solutions that re-
quire more research and dedication.
