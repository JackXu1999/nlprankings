Abstract 

A publically available wordnet browser will, if 
it does not remain in obscurity, have to cater to 
two different audiences: the professional lexi-
cographers and the general public. This 
demonstration paper describes the wordnet 
browser “Andre ord” which has been devel-
oped for the Danish wordnet, DanNet. The 
first version was released in autumn 2009, fol-
lowed by the release of a refined version in 
late 2010. The browser applies the open source 
framework Ruby on Rails and the graphing 
toolkit Protovis, and is itself open source. In 
the paper we discuss what design compromis-
es might be needed when accommodating pro-
fessionals and non-specialists alike, although 
our main concern is giving the general public 
an intuitive impression of the resource. To this 
aim we adopt the familiar, dictionary-like 
word-in-synset as the basic unit of the browser 
idea, but at the same time try to convey the 
idea that every piece of information in the 
wordnet is located somewhere in a larger se-
mantic network structure.  

1 Introduction and related work 
In a certain sense, wordnet browsers abound. No 
doubt owing to its generous open source licence, 
content from the Princeton WordNet crop up in 
all sorts of dictionary-like applications. We have 
encountered it such diverse places as iPhone ap-
plications, writing assistants, web-based diction-
aries, and as stand-alone software. In most of 
these settings the wordnet structure is disregard-
ed, and the content is couched into an ordinary 
dictionary format that is familiar to most people. 
For our present purposes we will not consider 
these as wordnet browsers, but direct our atten-
tion to three of the comparably fewer that offer a 
full experience. 

The official Princeton Wordnet browser1 
(Princeton University) exposes a text-like inter-

face to the wordnet. A query for a word brings 
up a page that lists the various synsets it is a part 
of. Each synset can then be expanded by a click, 
which reveal its relations to other synsets along 
with additional facts about the synset, such as its 
allowed sentence frames. Hierarchical relations, 
which occur in for example “inherit-
ed_hypernym”, are marked by indentation. All of 
the data in Wordnet is accessible by this interface 
and no attempt is made to restrict the output, 
even when this leads to pages of unwieldy 
length. 

Visuwords2 conceptualizes Wordnet as a net-
work structure and employs a force-directed 
graph layout to visualize the connections be-
tween synsets. This type of layout algorithm, 
which progresses by simulating the graph as a 
physical system, with edges behaving like, for 
instance, springs, and nodes as charged particles, 
takes a short while to settle down, making the 
graph appear very lively at first. When entering a 
word it constructs a graph centered on a node 
with that label, linking to all synsets that include 
the query word. Ambiguity is thus not resolved 
but purposely kept in the graph illustration. 
Wordnet relations that originate in the synsets 
are also drawn, although if there are more than a 
few of each type they seem to get capped arbi-
trarily. Visuwords use color coding extensively, 
both on its own, to distinguish between synsets 
in various parts-of-speech, and in combination 
with shapes for telling different relation types 
apart. 

While not a full-fledged wordnet browser, 
Nodebox3 does contain an inspirational visualiza-
tion of a wordnet synset. It uses a radial node-
link diagram, which packs nodes along the radius 
of a circle.  Edges are drawn by the use of line 
segments. Contrasting with Visuwords, the lay-
out is static, and less dense with just one disam-
biguated synset and a single relation type being

displayed at a time, improving the over-all read-
ability as well as calming the appearance of the 
graph. Because only one kind of information is 
visualized the graph does not use any color or 
shape encoding.  

The rest of the paper is organised as follows. 
We introduce the DanNet resource in Section 2, 
and Section 3 describes the design considerations 
made. Technical details of “Andre ord” are given 
in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 briefly presents 
some ideas for future implementation. 

2 Presentation of the resource: DanNet 
DanNet (cf. wordnet.dk) is an open-source, lexi-
cal-semantic resource for Danish built in collabo-
ration between The University of Copenhagen 
and Det Danske Sprog- og Litteraturselskab. The 
resource is meant for integration in computation-
al systems that include a semantic aspect, such as 
writing aids and intelligent information naviga-
tion systems. Currently, it has been integrated in 
the Danish version of OpenOffice where it is 
used as a facility to suggest broader and more 
narrow terms, and it is integrated in a search 
module developed for The Municipality of 
Odense by the Danish company LAT-computing. 
Furthermore, the resource has been used in sev-
eral research projects concerned with word sense 
disambiguation and search. 

DanNet is a classical wordnet in the sense that 
it conforms to the framework of Princeton 
WordNet (Fellbaum 1998) and EuroWordNet 
(Vossen (ed.) 1999) with a few exceptions. 
However, in contrast with most other wordnets, 
DanNet has been constructed using a merge ap-
proach where the wordnet is constructed mono-
lingually (based on Den Danske Ordbog) and 
thereafter linked to Princeton WordNet. This 
strategy can be seen in contrast to the more wide-
ly adopted expand approach where synsets are 
translated from Princeton WordNet into the tar-
get language.  

At the time of writing, DanNet contains 
62,000 synsets and is still under development 
within the DK-CLARIN project, until mid of 
2011. DK-CLARIN is the Danish branch of the 
EU project CLARIN, an acronym which expands 
to a common language resources and technology 
infrastructure.  

3 Design considerations 
A publically available wordnet browser will, if it 
does not remain in obscurity, have to cater to two 
different audiences: the professional lexicogra-

phers and the general public. Sadly, their expec-
tations and skill sets do not always align. To 
most people a wordnet will not be something 
readily familiar, and so the concept of, for in-
stance, a synset will have to be set down before 
an uninitiated user can make sense of relations 
between such entities. This is a major challenge 
since the famously impatient web surfers of to-
day do not like prolonged explanations. 

However, as nearly everyone knows their way 
around a standard dictionary where a headword 
leads to a definition, emphasizing the similarity 
between a wordnet and a dictionary, rather than 
pointing out the differences, might reduce the 
burden of explanation. This has lead us to adopt 
the word-in-synset as the basic unit of the brows-
er, that is: a synset pinned down by a particular 
choice of one of its synonyms. Each word-in-
synset is presented on a separate page. Even 
though such a page in effect shows a synset, the 
notion itself is never brought to attention of the 
user. For browsing purposes this eliminates the 
need to explain the more abstract concept of a 
synset, but still preserving the relational nature of 
the wordnet. 

Furthermore, we have sought to enhance the 
ease of use of the browser by shifting the display 
of important relation information from what 
would, in some cases, require some very long 
tables to a single, prominently placed graph. Our 
particular choice of graph, which is accounted 
for in the next section, very compactly encodes 
hundreds of relations. Even so there sometimes is 
a conflict between completeness and comprehen-
siveness. If the number of relations exceeds a 
certain limit they can no longer be displayed in 
the graph without sacrificing readability. In that 
case we favor comprehensiveness and drop rela-
tions according to a developed scheme. Luckily, 
we only have to resort to this option in 0,2 % of 
the cases. 

In the wordnet browsers surveyed in the “Re-
lated works” section of the paper, pages are gen-
erated on the basis of a word, a possibly ambigu-
ous string entered by the user and corresponding 
to one or more synsets. Thus each page view is 
often required to serve information about multi-
ple synsets that are unrelated (in the wordnet 
sense), and perhaps distributed across different 
parts-of-speech. As such this agglomeration of 
synsets does not provide insight into the structure 
of the wordnet. We avoid bewildering the user 
by having him go through a disambiguation pro-
cess in case of ambiguity at the end of which a 
single word-in-synset is chosen for display.

Another important consideration is how to 
highlight the situatedness of the data. We wanted 
to convey to the user the idea that every piece of 
information in the wordnet is located somewhere 
in a larger semantic network structure. We found 
no single way of effectively communicating this, 
but rely instead on the combination of several 
cues; the shortest path to the top node, which is 
printed like a breadcrumb, the relations to adja-
cent synsets being displayed in a manner sugges-
tive of a network structure, and a chart that 
summarizes the complete hierarchy of hyper-
onomy relations that terminate in the current 
synset. 

Returning, finally, to the problem of the dual 
audiences: the professionals who arrive with cer-
tain theoretically founded expectations, and the 
casual visitors with a more fleeting interesting in 
linguistics. We had the good fortune of not being 
in charge of developing the only browser for the 
DanNet project, albeit the only public one, and 
that allowed us to maintain a focus on the lay-
men perspective since a custom in-house tool 
already existed. Our concern with the profes-
sional audience was consequently less to indulge 
their desires for specialist functionality and more 
to make sure that our depiction of the resource 
was still valid and sound according to their point 
of view. For while the resource should be as easi-
ly accessible as possible, it should be no more so, 
to quote a phrase; under no circumstances did we 
want to distort the content of the wordnet to 
make it easier to understand. 

So even if “Andre ord” was not designed with 
lexicographers in mind, they have nonetheless 
derived much utility from it. Perhaps owing to 
the more visual nature of this browser, it has 
proven very effective at spotting, for instance, 
relation type and inheritance errors. 

4 Technical description 
“Andre ord” is a web application, deployed at 

http://andreord.dk. It is built using the open 
source framework Ruby on Rails4, and is itself 
open source. Protovis5 from the Stanford Visual-
ization Group is the foundation on which the 
graphs are constructed. Here we provide an 
overview of the elements of the central word-in-
synset page as well as what steps are needed to 
arrive at that page.

Before any data from the wordnet can be dis-
played the user must type in a query. The query 
should be a single, uninflected word that exists in 
the wordnet. Helpful suggestions from the data-
base continuously guide the match.  

If the query corresponds to a single word-in-
synset, it is displayed. Otherwise the user is redi-
rected to a disambiguation page. Here, a list of 
matches is displayed along with their glosses. 
Furthermore, each word-in-synset is assigned a 
unique heading to make them easier to distin-
guish from each other. The heading is typically 
the word itself joined by either a hyperonym, a 
hyponym, or, in case they are not unique, a coun-
ter. A partial listing for the word “dronning” 
(queen) is “dronning (insekt)”, “dronning 
(dame)”, “dronning (kort)”, and “dronning (re-
gent)” (the translations for the parenthesized 
words are: “insect”, “lady”, “playing cards”, and 
“ruler”). These (particular) headings are obvious-
ly very helpful for disambiguation. 

On the main page two types of visualizations 
can be toggled. The first one, depicted below, is 
preselected (“blæseinstrument” is wind instru-
ment).

Figure 1: Word-in-synset relations 

 
Here all relations that have the currently dis-

played synset as a source is shown. The graph is 
modelled as a two level node-link diagram. Rela-
tions connect via an intermediate relation type 
node, visually clustering nodes that share relation 
type. Color is used to mark the relation type and 
can be resolved in the accompanying legend. 
Graph layout is remarkably simple. Since the 
number of edge nodes is known in advance, and 
the level count is fixed, it suffices to group the 
relations by relation type, plot them as equally 
spaced points on a circle with a chosen radius, 
then connect them by line segments to a point on 
a smaller, inner circle which sits exactly midway 
between the extremes of the relation type group.

As a final step the points on the inner circle are 
connected to the centre. 

The graph can be navigated by clicking. 
Mouse-over reveals further information about the 
word-in-synset below the pointer, such as gloss 
and associated words. 

If the number of relations on a given synset 
exceeds the capacity of this visualization, a cap-
ping policy kicks in. It works by grouping the 
relations by type, then iteratively picking one 
relation for display from each group, stopping 
when the limit has been reached. The idea is that 
smaller relation groups are shown in their entire-
ty while larger ones get allotted the same share, 
regardless of their size. Fortunately, capping is 
rarely necessary as the radial layout, coupled 
with slanted labels, can fit a rather large number 
of relations.

Figure 2: Aggregated hyponyms for "dyr" 

 
The other visualization explores in depth the 

hyponym relation. In non-technical terms, it an-
swers the question: what is this concept com-
posed of? The answer comes in the form of a 
sunburst diagram, which is especially well suited 
for expressing these sorts of nested composed-of 
relationships. An important thing to notice is that 
proportionality is preserved so it is possible to 
visually compare the size (recursively enumerat-
ed hyponym count) of each hyponym. 

There are synsets, typically situated near the 
top of the concept hierarchy, for which the num-
ber of recursive hyponyms far exceed what can 
be shown in the diagram. We decide on the most 
important hyponyms in the following manner. 
First, the recursive traversal is limited to a depth 
of four levels, and edge synsets are disregarded. 
Second, an algorithm is run that collapses synsets 

too small to be shown (measured by the angular 
space available for the label) into a special “rest” 
category, marked by the use of a translucent col-
or and no label. The reason for keeping synsets 
in the rest category is to maintain proportionality. 

Apart from the visualizations the page con-
tains pragmatic language use examples, a trace of 
the shortest path to the top synset, a complete list 
of hyponyms with glosses, and lastly, the onto-
logical type of the synset.  

5 Conclusion and future work 
The development and release of “Andre ord” has 
highly increased the interest and knowledge of 
DanNet in the Danish community, both among 
linguistic and computational researchers and 
among commercial developers. We are delight-
ed, and also a bit surprised, of the volume of the 
feedback. It shows that there is value in design-
ing something not meant for ourselves.  

Regarding future extensions, the following is-
sues are under consideration. Currently there is 
no way to distinguish between an inherited rela-
tion (typically shared between sister terms) and a 
relation defined directly on the synset, even 
though the latter is considered more important. 
This extra dimension could be encoded using, for 
example, shape, such as a dotted line, or by at-
taching a slight glow to the line representing the 
relation. Another concern is how to heighten the 
layman user’s appreciation of the subtler details 
of the wordnet. Though it is our firmly held be-
lief that a public wordnet browser should be intu-
itive and largely self-explanatory, a little linguis-
tic background information here and there may 
not be that harmful to the enterprise.
