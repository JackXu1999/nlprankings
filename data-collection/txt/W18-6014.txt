Abstract

In this paper, we describe a corpus UD
Japanese-BCCWJ that was created by con-
verting the Balanced Corpus of Contemporary
Written Japanese (BCCWJ), a Japanese lan-
guage corpus, to adhere to the UD annota-
tion schema. The BCCWJ already assigns de-
pendency information at the level of the bun-
setsu (a Japanese syntactic unit comparable to
the phrase). We developed a program to con-
vert the BCCWJto UD based on this depen-
dency structure, and this corpus is the result
of completely automatic conversion using the
program. UD Japanese-BCCWJ is the largest-
scale UD Japanese corpus and the second-
largest of all UD corpora, including 1,980 doc-
uments, 57,109 sentences, and 1,273k words
across six distinct domains.

1 Introduction

The field of Natural Language Processing has
seen growing interest in multilingual and cross-
linguistic research. One such cross-linguistic re-
search initiative is the Universal Dependencies
(UD) (McDonald et al., 2013) Project, which de-
fines standards and schemas for parts of speech
and dependency structures and distributes multi-
lingual corpora. As part of our efforts to im-
port the UD annotation schema into the Japanese
language, we defined a part-of-speech (PoS) sys-
tem and set of dependency structure labels for
Japanese, which are documented on GitHub 1,
and we are currently preparing reference corpora.
This paper describes our Japanese UD corpus UD
Japanese-BCCWJ, which is based on the Bal-
anced Corpus of Contemporary Written Japanese
(BCCWJ) (Maekawa et al., 2014), and which we
have prepared as part of our efforts to design a
Japanese version of UD.

Previous applications of UD to Japanese cor-
pora can be found in Table 1, which is based on
(Asahara et al., 2018). Tanaka et al. (2016) have
published a Japanese UD treebank, UD Japanese-
KTC, which was converted from the Japanese
Phrase Structure Treebank (Tanaka and Nagata,
2013). Other corpora include an unlabelled UD
Japanese treebank derived from Wikipedia, UD
Japanese-GSD, and a Japanese-PUD corpus, UD
Japanese-PUD (Zeman et al., 2017), derived from
parallel corpora, but all of these have had to be par-
tially manually corrected. According to Table 1,
UD Japanese-BCCWJ is the largest UD Japanese
corpus. Furthermore, it is the second largest of all
UD corpora and includes many documents across
various domains as shown in Table 3.

Existing Japanese-language corpora tagged
with dependency structures include the Kyoto
University Text Corpus (Kurohashi and Nagao,
2003) and the Japanese Dependency Cor-
pus (Mori et al., 2014). These corpora frequently
use bunsetsu as the syntactic dependency
annotation units for Japanese. Also, the BC-
CWJ, based on UD Japanese-BCCWJ, is
annotated using a bunsetsu-level dependency
structure (Asahara and Matsumoto, 2016), which
we must thus convert from a bunsetsu-level de-
pendency structure to a Universal Dependencies
schema. Figure 1 shows an example of BCCWJ
with the UD annotation schema.

In this paper, we describe the conversion of the
BCCWJ to the UD annotation schema. To accom-
plish the conversion, the following information
must be combined: word-morphological informa-
tion, bunsetsu-level dependency structure, coordi-
nation structure annotation, and predicate argu-
ment structure information. We also attempt to
convert the BCCWJ to a UD schema, which al-
lows us to respond to changes in the tree structures
based on ongoing discussions in the UD commu-

2 Balanced Corpus of Contemporary
Written Japanese (BCCWJ)

The Balanced Corpus of Contemporary Written
Japanese (BCCWJ) (Maekawa et al., 2014) is a
104.3-million-word corpus that covers a range of
genres including general books and magazines,
newspapers, white papers, blogs, Internet bulletin
board postings, textbooks, and legal statutes. It is

dencies on 2018 March; however, we noticed and addressed
some problems after release, and so the development version
is as described in this paper.

currently the largest balanced corpus of Japanese.
The copyright negotiation process has also been
completed for BCCWJ DVD purchasers. 3

All BCCWJ data are automatically tokenized
and PoS-tagged by NLP analysers in a three-
layered tokenization of Short Unit Word (SUW),
Long Unit Word (LUW), and bunsetsu as in Fig-
ure 2.4 There are subcorpora to be checked man-
ually to improve their quality after analysis, as
well as a subcorpus of the 1% of the BCCWJ data
called ‘core data’ consisting of 1,980 samples and
57,256 sentences with morphological information
(word boundaries and PoS information). Table 2
describes each genre in the BCCWJ core data. The
distribution, including the BCCWJ core data, is
shown in Figure 3. The UD Japanese-BCCWJ is
based on the BCCWJ core data.

The BCCWJ provides bunsetsu-level
dependency information as BCCWJ-
DepPara (Asahara and Matsumoto, 2016)
including bunsetsu dependency structures,
coordination structures, and information on

predicate-argument structures through BCCWJ-
DepPara-PAS (Ueda et al., 2015). This informa-
tion is exploited in the conversion of BCCWJ to
the UD schemas.

3 Conversion of BCCWJ to UD

As shown in Figure 1, there are some differ-
ences between the BCCWJ and UD schemas.
One concerns PoS: BCCWJ’s and UD’s PoS
Unidic (Den et al., 2007) and Universal
PoS (Petrov et al., 2012), respectively (e.g.
noun(common.general) and NOUN in Fig-
ure 1). Second, the structure is different between
bunsetsu-level and word-level dependency, for
example in the directions and units of dependency
(compare BCCWJ with the UD schema in Fig-
ure 1). Finally, the bunsetsu-level dependency
structures in Japanese have less detailed syntactic
dependency roles than the relations in Universal
Dependencies like nmod and case. We need to
convert UD Japanese-BCCWJ while taking into
consideration the differences between the UD and
BCCWJ schemata. In addition, we need to choose
or detect apposite word units for the basic word
unit based on UD guidelines from SUWs, LUWs,
and others because these layers are not always
appropriate as given by BCCWJ. Therefore, we
convert BCCWJ to UD Japanese-BCCWJ using
the following steps:

1. Detect the word unit.
2. Convert Unidic PoS to UD PoS.
3. Convert bunsetsu-level dependency to UD

word-level dependency.
4. Attach a UD relation label to each depen-

dency.

We will describe each step in the following sec-
tions.

3.1 Word Unit

Japanese, unlike English as well as many other
languages, text is not explicitly divided into words
using spaces. UD guidelines specify that the basic
units of annotation are syntactic words 5. The first
task is therefore to decide what counts as a token
and what counts as a syntactic word.

All the samples in the BCCWJ are morpho-
logically analysed based on linguistic units called
‘Short Unit Words ’ (SUWs) and ‘Long Unit
Words ’(LUWs), as in Figure 2. SUWs are de-
fined on the basis of their morphological prop-
erties in the Japanese language. They are mini-
mal atomic units that can be combined in ways
specific to particular classes of Japanese words.
LUWs are defined on the basis of their syntactic
properties. The bunsetsu are word grouping units
defined in terms of the dependency structure (the
so-called bunsetsu-kakariuke). The bunsetsu-level
dependency structure annotations in BCCWJ-
DepPara (Asahara and Matsumoto, 2016) rely on
LUWs. As shown in Figure 2, the SUWs, LUWs,
and bunsetsu exist in a hierarchical relationship:
SUW <= LUW <= bunsetsu; SUWs render 魚/
フライ/を as three words, LUWs as魚フライ/を
or two words, and bunsetsu as魚フライを or one
word. SUWs and LUWs also entail different PoS
systems, as will be described in Section 3.2.

UD Japanese-BCCWJ adopts the SUW word
unit, which corresponds to the BCCWJ’s basic
PoS system, as its fundamental linguistic unit.
However, as described in the following sections,
usage information associated with LUWs is also
required to conform to UD standards and to
achieve consistency with annotations for other lan-
guages. We will discuss the differences between

SUWs and LUWs in Section 5.1.

3.2 Conversion to Universal PoS tags

UD has adopted Universal PoS tags, version
2.0 (Petrov et al., 2012), as a system for aggregat-
ing the parts of speech of all languages; in this sys-
tem 17 distinct parts of speech are defined. For
the Japanese-language version of UD, we defined
the UD parts of speech by constructing a table of
correspondences using UniDic (Den et al., 2007)
and the Universal PoS tags. For SUWs, BCCWJ
adopts a PoS system based on a word’s possi-
ble lexical categories. For example, the PoS tag
noun(common.adverbial) (名詞-普通名詞-
副詞可能) means that the word can be a common
noun (普通名詞) or an adverb (副詞). In contrast,
LUWs are used to specify PoS tags based on usage
principles, which resolve usage ambiguities based
on context. The noun(common.adverbial)
tag in the SUW PoS system resolves to a common
noun or an adverb depending on context. We se-
lected the SUW PoS system because SUWs are
the base annotation of word units of the BCCWJ;
broadly speaking, there is no significant difference
between the SUW and LUW PoS systems for our
purposes.

However, for certain words we need to use
a LUW PoS system based on usage princi-
ples in order to conform to the UD stan-
dards and to achieve consistency with other lan-
guages. For example, in the case of a nom-
inal verb (noun(common.verbal_suru),
which can add -する) or nominal adjective
(noun(common.adjectival), which can
add -な), the SUW PoS system, based on lexical
principles, is not appropriate because if a word is
a verb or adjective depending on the context, the
SUW PoS system cannot detect this. Instead, here
we use LUW PoS tags based on usage principles
that resolve ambiguities based on context. The
LUW PoS tags based on usage principles have the
advantage of being easier to map onto other lan-

Figure 3: Illustration of the conversion of bunsetsu-
level dependency to UD word-level dependency.

guages, and the reduced ambiguity associated with
word endings makes it easier to specify the condi-
tions for a VERB or ADJ tag.

Table 4 shows the mapping between Universal
PoS tags and UniDic based on these principles.
Note that the mapping is for Unidic SUW PoS;
using Unidic LUW PoS would be simpler, as de-
scribed in the following Section 5.1. The fact is,
however, that there are several problems involved
in using LUW PoS, as will be described presently.

3.3 Conversion of dependency structure

For syntactic information for Japanese, we
use BCCWJ-DepPara (Asahara and Matsumoto,
2016), which includes bunsetsu dependency and
coordination information for the BCCWJ. In or-
der to convert bunsetsu-level into word-level de-
pendencies, we identify the head word in the bun-
setsu and then attach all other elements in the bun-
setsu to the head word, as in Figure 3. Note that
the UD dependency arrow is from the head to the
dependent word, whereas the BCCWJ dependency
arrow is from the dependent to the head word; this
is merely a notational issue and the substantive de-
scription is the same. Moreover, the head-word

6Japanese uses various suffixes to make an adjective
phrase using a noun, -的; to express an honorific meaning,
such as -さん; and so on. However, we use the NOUN for
the time being for various reasons.

in the bunsetsuis selected as the rightmost content
word after separating content and function words;
for example, the head-word is体験‘experiments’
in衝撃体験‘ impact experiments’in Figure 3. 7

While BCCWJ-DepPara includes dependency
information, it does not include syntactic de-
pendency roles corresponding to the Univer-
sal Dependencies relations (de Marneffe et al.,
2014) (such as the labels nsubj, obj, and
iobj). We therefore determined and assigned
the UD relation labels based on the case-marking
(particle(case｜binding｜adverbial))
or predicate-argument structure information in
BCCWJ-PAS (Ueda et al., 2015). This predicate-
argument structure information is semantic-level
information, so basically we use the case-marking,
and the predicate-argument information is just
for reference. Since Japanese, unlike languages
such as English, can omit core arguments and
case-marking and the case-marking always corre-
sponds with grammatical arguments in UD rela-
tions, predicate-argument structure is necessarily
expressed by the case marker. For example, the
case markerは ha usually indicates a nominal sub-
ject nsubj, but also frequently appears as a topic
marker. 8

Table 5 shows the rules for assigning UD re-
lations. These conversions combine various rules
like bunsetsu information, case information, and
coordination relations between the head word and
the dependent word.

Our current rules, which are unable to iden-
tify clauses, thus cannot effectively handle clause-
related labels such as csubj, advcl, and acl;
this is because clauses in Japanese are vaguer than
in English, as described in Section 5.2. In the fu-
ture, we will solve this problem by establishing

7As described in (Kanayama et al., 2018), this property
affects coordinate structures.

8Please refer to Section 3.4 in (Asahara et al., 2018) for a
discussion of case markers in Japanese.

BCCWJ-DepPara also contains coordinate

structure information, but our current conversion
rules do not yet have defined rules related to
coordinate structures such as cc and conj.
The issue will be presented in (Kanayama et al.,
2018).

3.4 Format

Through this process we can convert the BCCWJ
to a UD schema. UD Japanese-BCCWJ is format-
ted by CoNLL-U. UD Japanese-BCCWJ provides
the word form, lemma of the word form, univer-
sal part-of-speech tag, language-specific part-of-
speech tag (Unidic POS), and Universal Depen-



122

dencies relation. Note that the provided POS is the
SUW POS serves as the language-specific PoS tag
in UD Japanese-BCCWJ.

UD allows us to insert any annotation using the
MISC field, so we can give syntactic information
using this field for LUW word units and bunsetsu.
This information may be useful for Japanese pars-
ing. Table 6 summarizes the MISC fields in UD
Japanese-BCCWJ.

4 Parsing by genre

UD Japanese-BCCWJ is attractive in that it in-
cludes documents in various genres. We present
the parsing results that indicate differences by
genre. In this paper we do not show part-of-speech
tagging results, because there are some Japanese
POS tagging tools (for example, Kudo et al.
(2004)’s implementation, MeCab), which make it
easier to convert Unidic to UD POS, as mentioned.

We use UDPipe (Straka and Straková, 2017)
as a tool to train the parsing model and eval-
uate the parsing accuracy. UDPipe is a train-
able pipeline for tokenization, tagging, lemmatiza-
tion, and dependency parsing from CoNLL-U for-
mat files. The parsing uses Parsito (Straka et al.,
2015), which is a transition-based parser using a
neural-network classifier. We use default param-
eters in UDPipe. 9 We use the labelled attach-
ment score (LAS) and unlabelled attachment score
(UAS) as evaluation metrics.

The results are shown in Table 7 and Table 8.
The columns in the Tables represent the parsing
model by genre, the rows the genre tests, and ‘all’
is the full core data, so a given cell represents the
result of evaluating the genre parsing model by the
genre test set.

Whereas the genres of OW, PB, PM, and PN
contain more than 200K tokens, the genres of
OC and OY contain only around 100K, tokens as
shown in Table 3.

It is in principle one of the advantages of UD
Japanese-BCCWJ that it can utilize a relatively
large scale sub-corpus. In fact, however, the UAS
results show that if a genre has more than 200K to-
kens, the result from using only the in-domain data
is better than that with the data for all 1.2 million
tokens, including the out-domain data.

9The version using UDPipe is 1.2.1-devel, and executes
with no options.

5 Discussion

In this section, we will take up a problem re-
lated to UD Japanese that centres on UD Japanese-
BCCWJ. The overall discussion of UD Japanese is
summarized by (Asahara et al., 2018).

We must also still discuss the issue of coordi-
nate structures in Japanese. The issue will be pre-
sented in (Kanayama et al., 2018).

5.1 Word units

The choice of word unit is one of the important is-
sues in UD Japanese. BCCWJ includes three sorts
of word unit standards, as noted: SUWs, LUWs,
and bunsetsu. We used SUWs for UD Japanese-
BCCWJ.

However, the UD project stipulates that word
delimitation in the UD standard should be for ’syn-
tactic words’. LUWs in BCCWJ are thus a more
preferable word delimitation standard than SUWs.

Figure 4 shows the difference between SUW
PoS and LUW PoS. The top of Figure 4 shows the

SUW-based PoS. The verbする‘do’and the ver-
bal noun make a compound verb, as in the bottom
of Figure 4 in the LUW-based segmentation.

Figure 5 presents a functional multi-word ex-
pressionについて, which includes three words in
SUW units and one word in LUW units. We can
mask the morphological construction of the syn-
tactic word within a LUW.

However, currently we nevertheless continue to
use SUWs as the UD Japanese word delimitation
standard. This is because (1) LUWs are difficult
to produce with word segmenters, and (2) some
functional multi-word expressions in Japanese do
not conform to the LUW standards.

5.2 Clause

The UD dependency labels are designed to be
split between the word/phrase and the clause. The
difference between clauses and words/phrases is
vague in Japanese, because cases, including the
subject, do not necessarily overtly appear in sen-
tences.

Figure 6 shows an adjective clause and an adjec-
tive phrase in Japanese. At the top of Figure 6 is
an overt adjective clause with a nominal subject.
In contrast, however, in the example at the bot-
tom of Figure 6 it cannot be determined whether
the adjective is attributive or predicative, since the
nominal subject of adjective predicate can be omit-
ted in Japanese (in this case,しっぽ ’tail’ may be
omitted). Thus, we define acl for all adjectives
which attach to noun phrases as the current state.

しっぽ が 赤い 猫

There is the cat with a red tail.

6 Other UD Japanese resources

In this section, we describe other UD Japanese re-
sources at the time of writing. Table 2 shows a
summary of these. As noted, there are five UD
Japanese corpora as of March 2018, which in scale
constitute the second largest of all UD corpora
with the addition of the UD Japanese-BCCWJ.

UD Japanese-KTC (Tanaka et al., 2016) is
based on the NTT Japanese Phrase Structure Tree-
bank (Tanaka and Nagata, 2013), which contains
the same original text as the Kyoto Text Corpus
(KTC) (Kurohashi and Nagao, 2003). KTC is a
bunsetsu-level dependency structure like BCCWJ,
but with its own word delimitation schema and
POS tag set. We are now modifying the UD
Japanese KTC from the version 1.0 schema to ver-
sion 2.0.

UD Japanese-GSD consists of sentences from
Japanese Wikipedia that have been automati-
cally split into words by IBM’s word seg-



124

menter. The dependencies are automatically
resolved using the bunsetsu-level dependency
parser (Kanayama et al., 2000) with the attach-
ment rules for functional words defined in UD
Japanese.

UD Japanese-PUD (Zeman et al., 2017) was
created in the same manner as UD Japanese-GSD,
with the goal of maintaining consistency with UD
Japanese-GSD. It is a parallel corpus with multiple
other languages.

UD Japanese-Modern (Omura et al., 2017) is
a small UD annotation corpus based on the Cor-
pus of Historical Japanese: Meiji-Taisho Series I
Magazines (CHJ) (Ogiso et al., 2017). The CHJ
is large-scale corpus with morphological informa-
tion of Old Japanese and has morphological in-
formation compatible with the BCCWJ. We an-
notated bunsetsu-level syntactic dependency and
coordinated structures using the BCCWJ-DepPara
annotation schema and predicate-argument rela-
tions, and utilized the conversion script used for
UD Japanese-BCCWJ because the two corpora
share the same annotation schema. There are two
characteristic syntactic structures in Old Japanese.
One is inversion, found in Sino-Japanese literary
styles. The other is predicative adnominals.

As mentioned, each UD Japanese corpus has
been developed in a different manner since the
resources are derived from annotation with other
standards. For example, UD Japanese-KTC is
converted from a phrase structure treebank, while
UD Japanese-Modern is based on compatible an-
notation with UD Japanese-BCCWJ. However, the
syntactic structures of Old Japanese are very dif-
ferent from contemporary Japanese, as described
above.

Presently we are trying to standardize UD
Japanese resources under the UD Japanese-
BCCWJ schema by annotating BCCWJ-DepPara
with standard syntactic dependency notation for
other resources. Then, we will use the conversion
rules of this article for the other UD Japanese re-
sources.

7 Summary and Outlook

In this paper, we described a corpus created by
converting the Balanced Corpus of Contemporary
Written Japanese (BCCWJ), a Japanese language
corpus, into the UD annotation schema. There
are differences between BCCWJ and UD schemas,
and so we have tried to develop and implement

rules to convert BCCWJ to UD.
The UD Japanese-BCCWJ was released in

March 2018. Note that though the corpus does not
include the surface form due to the original text
copyright, the BCCWJ DVD Edition purchaser
can add the surface form using the scripts in the
UD package. However, this is a matter of debate,
as described in this paper, so we are going to con-
tinue to update it based on ongoing discussion,
for instance regarding the apposite word unit for
Japanese.

At the time of writing, we have completed the
process of UD conversion based on SUWs. We
also need to implement a corpus based on LUWs,
and will publicly release our Japanese UD data
based on both SUW and LUW analyses.
