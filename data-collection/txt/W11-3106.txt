Abstract 

This paper reports our ongoing research work 
to create a semantic based question answering 
system for Thailand tourism information. Our 
proposed system focuses on mapping expres-
sions in Thai natural language into ontology 
query language (SPARQL). 

Topic: Language processing, reasoning aspects 

1 Introduction 
The Semantic Web can provide significant im-
pact on an information intensive industry such as 
tourism where information plays an important 
role for decision and action making. Tourism is 
one of the economic factors in Thailand. From 
the statistics provided by the Office of Tourism 
Development1, the number of tourists visiting 
Thailand in 2010 is approximately 16 millions. 
Providing an automatic question-answering sys-
tem on tourism information would be very useful 
for tourists to plan their trips.  

In this paper, we propose a semantic based 
question answering system for Thailand tourism 
information. Our proposed system focuses on 
converting expressions in Thai natural language 
into SPARQL2, an ontology query language.  

Currently there already exist publicly available 
formal tourism ontologies. Notable ones include 
Harmonise Ontology (Fodor and Werthner, 
2005), Mondeca Tourism Ontology 3 , OnTour 
Ontology4 and TAGA Travel Ontology5. These

ontologies are designed to integrate and manage 
heterogeneous tourism data (Prantner et al., 
2007). In our proposed system, we apply pub-
licly available OnTour Ontology to represent the 
tourism concepts and relations such as place, ac-
commodation, restaurant and attraction.  

There are also number of studies that provide 
natural language interfaces to ontologies. Nota-
ble works include ORAKEL (Cimiano et al., 
2007), NLP-Reduce (Kaufmann et al., 2007), 
PANTO (Wang et al., 2007), AquaLog (Lopez et 
al., 2007), QuestIO (Damljanovic et al., 2008) 
and FREyA (Damljanovic et al., 2010). How-
ever, these approaches only focus on English 
language query. Since Thai language characteris-
tics are different than English, we propose an 
approach to map expressions in Thai natural lan-
guage to ontology based on pattern analysis. 

2 The Proposed System  

The proposed system is illustrated in Figure 1. 
The information is collected, by using a crawler, 
from various websites related to tourism in Thai-
land. We collect two different types of informa-
tion. The first type is general information such as 
places to visit, accommodations, attractions, and 
restaurants which are used to design our tourism 
(named Tour) ontology. The second type is re-
quests or questions for tourism information 
posted on public discussion forums. These natu-
ral language requests are used to construct a tour-
ism related lexicon and an annotated corpus for 
request pattern analysis.

Figure 1. The proposed system 
 
The performance of our proposed system de-

pends on the design and completeness of the 
lexicon. We distinguish lexicon into two types: 
domain-dependent and domain-independent. For 
the domain of tourism, the domain-dependent 
lexicons could be, for instance, “place,” “ac-
commodation,” “restaurant,” “attraction,” and 
“price”. The domain-independent lexicon con-
sists of regular words, which provide different 
functions in the sentence. For our proposed sys-
tem, we design two different domain-
independent lexicons as follows: 

 
- Particles (Par): In Thai language refer to 

the sentence endings which are normally 
used to add politeness of the speakers 
(Cooke, 1992). Examples are ครับ (Krub) 
and ค่ะ (Ka). 
 

- Request (Req): Phrases that are used for 
request information. Example is 
ช่วยแนะนำ (could you suggest).  
 

The collected natural language requests or 
questions are first manually annotated according 
to the domain-dependent and domain-
independent tag sets. From this tagged corpus, 
we can construct request patterns by collecting 
text segments, which contain both domain-
dependent and domain-independent words. 

Given a user query of natural language re-
quest, the query analysis module starts by per-
forming the word segmentation. Some of the to-
kenized words with their variations or similar 
meanings will be normalized into a standard 
term. The next step is to construct patterns from 
these processed natural language requests. These 
patterns will be converted into SPARQL, which 
is then used to query our Tour ontology located 
in the semantic search module. Figure 2 shows 
an example of our Tour ontology and a partial 
instantiation of an accommodation. The ontology 
consists of seven different classes: Accommoda-

tion, Restaurant, Attraction, Type, Cost, Address, 
and GPSCoordinates. Each class contains differ-
ent properties. For instance, the Accommodation 
class contains “hasName,” “hasType,” “hasMax-
People,” “hasCost,” and “hasGPSCoordinates” 
properties. Inference engine is also used to derive 
new knowledge. For instance, when a user re-
quests for an accommodation, some nearby res-
taurants can also be recommended to him/her.  

3 An Illustrative Case: Accommodation 
Information Request 

To evaluate the proposed system, we perform an 
experiment with an illustrative case on accom-
modation information request.  

3.1 Corpus Preparation 
We collected 300 natural language requests on 
accommodation from Pantip.com, one of the fa-
mous Thai language discussion forums. Table 1 
shows the lexicon related to accommodation re-
quest.

3.2 Experiments 
To verify if our lexicon is sufficient in identify-
ing accommodation request, we first perform 
request identification task. This task aims to dis-
tinguish between requests for accommodation

Figure 2. An example of Tour ontology 

and any other types of requests or questions. We 
initially performed evaluation on 600 questions 
where 300 are accommodation requests and other 
300 are not. The identification result yields 89% 
recall and 95% precision.  

We then use the tagged corpus and the ex-
tracted lexicon to construct the most frequently 
occurred patterns. For our 300 accommodation 
requests, the total number of extracted patterns is 
168. Table 2 shows some examples of the top-5 
accommodation request patterns. These patterns 
are then converted into SPARQL queries. The 
following example (Example 1) illustrates the 
conversion from natural language requests to 
SPARQL queries. The given request asks for 
recommended accommodations with a constraint 
on the number of people staying.   

 
Example 1:  
 
Natural language request input:  
รบกวนแนะนำที่พักที่เกาะกูดหน่อยครับ ไปกัน 10 
คน 
Could you suggest accommodation at Koh 
Kood “noi krub?”, going with 10 people  

 
 
 

Word segmentation process: 
รบกวนแนะนำ|ที่พัก|ที่|เกาะกูด|หน่อย|ครบั| 
|ไปกัน| |10| |คน| 

 
Pattern construction process: 
รบกวนแนะนำ<Req>|ที่พัก<Acc_Clue>| 
|ที่<Loc_Clue>|เกาะกูด<Place>| |หน่อย<Par> 
|ครับ<Par>| |ไปกัน<Ppl_Clue>| |10<Number>| 
|คน<Unit>| 

 
Extracted pattern:  
<Req> <Acc_Clue> <Loc_Clue> <Place> 
<Ppl_Clue> <Number><Unit> 
 
SPARQL conversion: 
 

SELECT ?a WHERE 
    { 
    tour:Tourist    tour:hasAccomodation ?a. 
    {{?a        tour:hasPlace "เกาะกูด".} 
    UNION { ?a     tour:hasAddress ?a. 
        ?b    tour:hasName "เกาะกูด". }} 
    ?a        tour:hasMaxPeople "10" 

        }

Table 2. Top-5 accommodation request pat-

terns with examples 
 

The derived SPARQL will be used to query 
our Tour ontology. For instance, our system will 
select “Koh Kood Resort” (as shown in the in-
stantiation in Figure 2) as one of the recom-
mended accommodations for the request in Ex-
ample 1.  

3.3 Discussion 
Our experiment shows that most words from the 
lexicon related to accommodations can be de-
rived and mapped into relevant structure in our 
Tour ontology. However, some content, espe-
cially those belong to accommodation condition 
(i.e., <Acc_Cond>), are difficult to extract since 
the ways to explain conditions can be much var-
ied and very descriptive. Table 3 shows some 
examples of challenging cases for accommoda-
tion condition.  

 

No. Some difficult cases for           
“accommodation condition” 

1 นั่งรถประจำทางไปเที่ยวสะดวก 
(convenient to take the bus) 

2 ใกล้กับงานแห่เทียน 
(closer to the Candle Festival) 

3 เหมาะสำหรับจัดกิจกรรมรับน้อง 
(suitable for holding a college orientation 
activity) 

4 เน้นกินเหล้า สังสรรค์ 
(focus on drinking and partying) 

5 มีรถมอเตอร์ไซด์เช่าแถวสนามบิน 
(have motorcycle rental service near the 
airport) 

 
Table 3. Examples of difficult cases for “ac-

commodation condition” 
 
Some of these conditions would require an in-

ference engine to help identify the answer. For 
example, in Case No.2, the distance between 
each retrieved accommodation and attraction 
(i.e., the Candle Festival in this case) will be cal-
culated based on their GPS coordinates. Only the 
accommodations located near the Candle Festi-
val will be recommended to the user. In addition, 
some rule base can be applied in order to trans-
form descriptive language into more structured 
format.  

4 Conclusion and future work  

In this paper, we proposed a framework for a 
semantic question-answering system for Thai-
land tourism information. Our proposed system 
focuses on mapping expressions in Thai natural 
language into ontology query language 
(SPARQL). The proposed method first con-
structs a set of patterns from a tagged corpus 
containing both domain-dependent and domain-
independent lexicons. The derived patterns are 
then converted into relevant SPARQL queries. 
We performed an experiment on a case study 
regarding accommodation information requests. 
Our experiment results showed that some fea-
tures such as place, accommodation type, price, 
and number of people staying can be extracted 
from the natural language query and easily con-
verted into corresponding SPARQL queries. 
However, in some cases such as the description 
of accommodation condition are more difficult to 
extract. For future work, we plan to apply some 
rule base and inference engine to help derive an-
swers to the user.
