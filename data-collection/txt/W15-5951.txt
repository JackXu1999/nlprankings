Abstract

This paper presents a rule-based reorder-
ing approach for English-Hindi machine
translation. We have used the concept of
pada, from Pān. inian Grammar to frame
the reordering rules. A pada is a word
form which is ready to participate in a
sentence. The rules are generic enough
to apply on any English-Indian language
pair. We tested the rules on English-Hindi
language pair and obtained better compre-
hensibility score as compared to Google
Translate on the same test set. In assess-
ing the effectiveness of the rules on padas
which are analogous to minimal phrases in
English, we achieved upto 93% accuracy
on the test data.

1 Introduction

Like many other languages, Hindi word order dif-
fers from English. That is why in machine transla-
tion (MT), in addition to finding appropriate word
senses, reordering of words plays a crucial role.
Reordering in rule-based MT is a stage where the
positions of the words of the source language (SL)
sentence are reordered according to the target lan-
guage (TL) syntax.

Hindi is a relatively free word-order language.
The relations between constituents are marked ex-
plicitly with the help of postpositions. The mor-
phological richness of the language allows the
constituents to change their positions freely within
a clause (Kachru, 2006; Chatterjee et al., 2007). In
spite of that, not all the words can occur freely at
any position (Kachru, 2006). For example,

• Postpositions follow their objects

• Verbs always precede their auxiliaries

• Modifiers such as prepositional modifiers,

adjectival modifiers or determiners precede
their head

For such reasons and many more described in
Section 4, one needs to reorder the sentences to
arrive at a natural translation.

Statistically trained systems give good results
in less amount of time and manual effort. But
any statistically trained system requires huge par-
allel corpus. Indian languages (ILs) lack a reason-
able parallel corpus size for English and IL pairs.
Hence, we explore a rule based approach for re-
ordering taking insights from Pān. inian Grammar
(PG).

The available reordering approaches are dis-
cussed in Section 2. Our reordering approach is
described in Section 3. Section 4 talks about major
divergences between English and Hindi. Reorder-
ing rule formation is described in Section 5 and
Section 6 presents experiments and results. Sec-
tion 7 does error analysis and Section 8 concludes
the paper.

2 Related Work

There are many approaches to handle TL word or-
dering. Some of them are described below:

1. Koehn et al (2003) perform reordering by us-
ing relative distortion probability distribution
model trained from joint probability distribu-
tion model φ(ē,f̄). Their model relies on the
language model to produce words in right or-
der (Koehn, 2009).

2. Kunchukuttan et al (2014) developed a
phrase based system for English-Indian Lan-
guage (henceforth En-IL) pairs that uses two
extensions- (i) source reordering for En-IL
translation using source side reordering rules
developed by (Patel et al., 2013) and (ii)
describing untranslated words for Indian-IL
translation by using transliteration procedure.357



3. A statistical translation model introduced by
Yamada and Knight (2001) incorporates fea-
tures based on syntax and converts SL parse
tree according to TL with the help of prob-
abilistic operations at required nodes using
expectation-maximization algorithm. This
model accepts parse trees as an input on
which it performs child node reordering ac-
cording to the TL.

4. Costa-Jussà and Fonollosa (2009) used an
Ngram-based Reordering (NbR) method that
uses SMT techniques to generate reordering
graph, which utilizes word classes and NbR
model for reordering. It produces an interme-
diate representation of source corpora where
word-order of SL is represented more closely
to the order of TL.

5. Universal Networking Language (UNL) is
an interlingual representation of MT systems
through semantic graphs, which comprise
of semantic relations, attributes and univer-
sal words. The UNL approach transforms
the lexicon into semantic hyper-graph which
decides the word-order of the TL through
parent-child positioning and relationship pri-
ority (Singh et al., 2007).

3 Our Approach

We present a rule based approach which is based
on PG, particularly on the concept of pada.
Though this paper presents an English-Hindi (En-
Hi) reordering approach, we claim that the same
system is generic enough to be used for any
English-IL pair with some modifications.

PG analyses a word as a combination of
a root/stem (prakr. ti) and an affix (pratyaya)
(Bharati et al., 2015). It is both the root
and the affix that jointly denote the meaning –
prakṙtipratyayau sahārtham brūtah. (Lit. root
and affix together convey the meaning) (Rathore,
1998). PG deals with morphology which is not
separated but is interlinked with syntax and se-
mantics (Subrahmanyam, 1999). This in a way
helps capture “how languages encode informa-
tion” and “how the information flows in lan-
guage”. Let us explore it through example 1, taken
from Bharati et al. (2015).

(1) a. mārjārāh.
cat.PL,NOM

mūs.akān
rat.PL,ACC

mārayanti
kill.3,PL,PR
‘Cats kill rats.’

b. mūs.akān mārjārāh. mārayanti
c. mārjārāh. mārayanti mūs.akān
d. mārayanti mārjārāh. mūs.akān
e. mūs.akān mārayanti mārjārāh.
f. mārayanti mūs.akān mārjārāh.

The words in Sanskrit, in example 1a, can be
ordered in any possible combination as shown
through 1b to 1f. Still, they convey more or less
the same meaning, but in English, changing the or-
der of the subject and object as in “Rats kill cats”
changes the meaning of the sentence all together.

The words in 1a have explicit morphemes called
vibhaktis attached to them which mark the de-
sired information explicitly. In other words, all
the words have formed padas (described in Sec-
tion 3.1), hence, they can occur freely at any po-
sition in the sentence. This gives us the clue to
identity the relational morphemes and attach them
with their relata.

3.1 Pada Formation
In PG, a śabda denotes a linguistic expression
ranging from individual speech sound to an utter-
ance (Singh, 1991) whereas a pada is a primary
structural unit that occurs in actual sentences. San-
skrit has a grammatical rule apadaṁ na prayuñjı̄ta
(Dvivedi, 1953) which says: “a word which is not
a pada should not be used in a sentence”. Pān. ini
defines a pada as follows: “A finished word form
which is ready to participate in a sentence” (Ma-
havir, 1984; Bharati et al., 2015).

The sūtra suptiṅantaṁ padam (A 1.4.14i) states:
“a word ending in sup (nominal suffix) or tiṅ (ver-
bal suffix) is called a pada”. The sup and tiṅ are
the nominal and verbal grammatical inflections.
The sup is the nominal case and the tiṅ is finite
verb inflection. Vibhakti is a general term in San-
skrit used for both the nominal as well as verbal
suffixes.

According to the sūtra (A. 1.4.14),

1. Prātipadika + sup = subanta pada
(nominal stem + nominal suffix = nominal
pada)

2. Dhātu + tiṅ = tiṅanta pada
(verbal stem + finite verbal suffix = verbal
pada)358



Hence pada is a grammatically inflected word
form which is ready to participate in a sentence
expressing its role and relations with other words
in the sentence.

3.2 The subanta and tiṅanta padas in English

Let us take some English sentences and use
Pān. inian primitives such as sup, tiṅ and pada etc.
to analyse them.

(2) Rama laughed.

The constituency tree diagram for sentence 2 is
shown in Figure 1. The word Rama is the sub-
ject and thus does not carry any case marker. We
are now looking for the criteria equivalent to the
notion of sup Bharati et al (1996) show that En-
glish has the notion of generalized vibhakti. which
corresponds to the sup suffixes in Sanskrit. The
generalized vibhakti is realized either through sub-
ject1 or object positions or through prepositions.
Thus in sentence 2, Rama occurring at subject
position seems to carry no sup, but according to
Bharati et al., (1996), since it occurs at the subject
position it carries a generalized vibhakti in terms
of subject position, hence, it is a subanta pada.

The verb laughed has -ed suffix as a tiṅ, hence
it can be called as a tiṅanta pada. See Figure 1
where each box represents an independent pada.

Figure 1: Pada information in tree diagram for 2

Example 2 contains only minimal phrases
where each phrase consists of a single word, hence
just by applying the sūtra suptiṅantaṁ padam (A
1.4.14) we can conclude that minimal phrase is a
pada from Pān. inian viewpoint. But what about the
phrases which consist of more than one word? For
example,

(3) The new students have been working on
this problem.

1In linguistics, the notion of subject in ILs is much debat-
able (Bharati and Kulkarni, 2011).

In sentence 3, the word group the new students
is an NP and have been working on this problem is
a VP which consists of a verb group and a preposi-
tional phrase. The verb group have been working
contains work as a verb and have been -ing as a
tiṅ/auxiliaries, hence, it can be taken as a tiṅanta
pada. But, how many padas should we consider in
the constituents the new students and on this prob-
lem?

The constituent the new students in sentence
3 occurs at subject position, hence, as stated by
Bharati et al., (1996) it carries a generalized vib-
hakti in terms of subject position. Also, if the con-
stituent the new students occurs in a prepositional
phrase all three words take only a single prepo-
sition as in I gave a book to the new students.
The head noun students along with its modifiers
new and the takes only one-vibhakti/ekasup ‘to’,
Therefore, in example 3, the whole group, the new
students can be taken as a single subanta pada.
Similarly, on this problem can also be taken as a
subanta pada which carries the preposition on as a
sup.

As said before, a tiṅanta pada is formed by
adding tiṅ suffixes to the verbal stems.

The finite verb phrases (VPs) are exceptional
cases in English where an adverbial phrase can oc-
cur between a finite verb group. For example, take
sentence 4:

(4) The child
baccā

is
AUX

impatiently
besabrı̄ se

waiting
pratı̄ks.ā kara.3.SG.PR.CONT

for
kı̄

her
vaha.GEN.SG

mother.
mām.

‘baccā besabrı̄ se apanı̄ mām. kı̄ pratı̄ks.ā
kara rahā hai’

In 4, the adverb ‘impatiently’ is embedded in
the tiṅanta pada, is waiting. This is a frequent
phenomenon in English. Hence, identification
of tiṅanta padas helps in forming a verb group
whereby translation of verb and its suffixes can
be handled properly by grouping the verb root and
verbal affixes the tiṅ.

In literature, a quite similar concept is men-
tioned by the name of Local Word Grouping
(LWG), whereby word groups are formed based
on the local (adjacent) word information (Bharati
et al., 1995). In our attempts, we form word
groups on the basis of nearby verbal and nomi-
nal suffixes called sup and tiṅ inspired by Pān. inian359



grammar which is linguistically more precise and
satisfactory. This also facilitates the study of re-
lational information that binds the words into a
meaningful sentence.

In Hindi and Hindi like languages where the
grammatical information is lexicalized, we group
the postpositions with the nouns for subanta and
auxiliaries with the verb for tiṅanta. Since auxil-
iaries and postpositions are grouped with the verbs
and nouns, we get the padas and we can directly
substitute them. In English also the auxiliaries
carry the tiṅ information for the verbs. We are
treating prepositions as the sup for nouns. In this
way, the prepositions and postpositions for nouns
and auxiliaries for verbs with respect to word or-
der are taken care of by this step.

This approach handles grouping of noun with
sup inflection and verb with tiṅ inflection. Hence,
we do not need to have separate reordering rules
for this. However, reordering between En-Hi pair
is a more complex task, because, in English, a lot
of relational information is encoded in position,
which makes syntax of English very diverse from
Hindi.

4 Major Divergences between English
and Hindi

Language divergence includes lexical, structural
and conflational divergences (Dorr, 1993). Dave et
al (2001) discuss the major structural divergences
with respect to English and Hindi. Table 1 sum-
marizes the major structural divergences between
English and Hindi.

glish and Hindi

5 Formation of Reordering Rules

Hindi and English follow ‘mirror structure’ in
terms of structural word order. Hence the daugh-
ters of English verb phrase (VP) and prepositional
phrase (PP) come in mirror image when translated
into Hindi. In other words, the SL VP looks like a
mirror image of the TL VP and vice versa.

The concept of ‘mirror structure’ is illustrated
with example 5. The constituency tree for sen-
tence 5 is shown in Figure 2. The mirror image
of its VP as shown in Figure 3 gives a perfectly
ordered Hindi sentence.

stituency parse for 5

When mere ‘mirror structure’ does not suffice
to arrive at a fluent Hindi sentence, we take advan-
tage of dependency parse to handle such peculiar-
ities in order to put the phrase at the desired place
in TL. For example, indirect object tends to pre-
cede the direct object in Hindi. In 6a, the indirect
and direct object reversal is restricted using depen-
dency relations, since 6a sounds more natural than
6b to the native speakers of Hindi.

5.1 Special Cases in Hindi
Apart from the cases described in Section 1, there
are constructions which are not so flexible in terms
of word order. This section describes some of
them.

• Starting point and end point: While talking
about a range or a span, the phrase describ-
ing an initial point precedes the phrase that
describes the end point. This phenomenon
seems to be common in all languages. Some
such examples are shown from English in 7.

(7) a. In Kashmir, fishing is a good
business and the ideal season is
from April to October.

b. I shall continue to work from 6
a.m. till midnight, even if it kills
me.

c. October to March is the best
time to visit the Jaipur city.

d. In the south, Jammu is a transi-
tion zone from the Indian plains
to the Himalayas.

In 7, all the phrases shown in bold letters do
not change their positions. Only forming the
padas by identification of sup and tiṅ gives
perfect word order in Hindi, hence, no move-
ment is required.

• Relative order of arguments of a verb: The
internal order of theme and recipient roles
in English can be expressed in two ways:
(i) through position as shown in 8 and (ii)
through preposition as shown in 9.

(8) John gave Harry a book.

(9) John gave a book to Harry.

In Hindi, 8 and 9 both the sentences can be
translated as in 10 and 11 respectively. Since

Hindi is morphologically rich, it marks re-
lations through morphemes. Therefore, as
mentioned above, the order can be relatively
free.

(10) John ne Harry ko eka kitāba dı̄.
(11) John ne eka kitāba Harry ko dı̄.

However, more natural one is 10. This is the
default order in Hindi. This is consistent with
the SOV order of Hindi.

• Source and destination phrases: Source and
destination phrases tend to occur immedi-
ately before their verbal head as shown in 12
and 13. For instance, vaha use skūla le gayā.
sounds more natural than vaha skūla use le
gayā. in Hindi.

(12) He
vaha

took
le gayā

her

to the school.
skūla

‘vaha use skūla le gayā.’
(13) He

vaha
picked
le āyā

her
use

from
se

the party
pārtı̄

‘vaha use pārtı̄ se le āyā.’

Whereas if source and destination both occur
as arguments of a same verb then destination
phrase tends to occur immediately before the
verb as shown in 14.

(14) He
vaha

took
le gayā

her
use

home
ghara

from
se

the

party.
pārtı̄
‘vaha use pārtı̄ se ghara le gayā.’

• Marking negation: In English negation mark-
ers ‘no’ and ‘not’ occur with nouns and verbs
respectively. Whereas in Hindi, if the head
of the negation marker ‘no’ is a verb mod-
ifier then the negation marker comes before
the verb. There also, if the verb is a conjunct
verb (Begum et al., 2011) then it come before
the helping verb as shown in 17.

(15) No

‘usane mere liye pratı̄kṡā nahı̄m. kı̄’

• Yes/no interrogative question: The yes/no
interrogative morpheme is missing in En-
glish (Anantpur, 2009). Therefore, it inverts
the positions of subject and verb/auxiliary
to mark a yes/no interrogative. Whereas in
Hindi, yes/no interrogative question marker
kyā is lexicalized and normally occurs at sen-
tence initial position. As a consequence, in
addition to word order, one needs to insert the
morpheme kyā in Hindi, as shown in 18.

Section 5.2 and 5.3 describe some important
reordering rules which are sufficient to give an
overview of our approach.

5.2 Rules Based on ‘Mirror Structure’

The rules based on ‘mirror structure’ are very pro-
ductive. These rules give around 70% constituent
reordering accuracy.

We followed Penn tagset to represent con-
stituents. The rules are written using the follow-
ing convention: [.mother child1 child2 child3]→
[.mother child3 child2 child1], where the part be-
fore ‘→’ denotes SL parse tree and the later part
denotes TL parse tree. The item marked with dot
(.) represents the mother node followed by its
child nodes. The rules are written in following for-
mat: first, we give the rule and then the rules are
described with an example/s.

RBMS12: VP is reversed to allow ‘mirror struc-
ture’ as discussed in Section 3. See example 5.

RBMS2: [.ADVP RB NP]→ [.ADVP NP RB]
RB should be the last child of an ADVP.
2The rules based on ‘mirror structure are named as RBMS

+ a number and the rules for restricting ‘mirror structure’ are
named as RRMS + a number.

tion as in 21.

5.3 Rules for Handling Exceptional Cases
Even after applying ‘mirror structure’ on VP, some
cases remain non-fluent and/or incomprehensible
because of the inflexibility of some of the con-
stituents to precede/follow the other constituents
as pointed out in Section 1. This section describes
some rules which are exceptions of ‘mirror struc-
ture’.

RRMS1: [.VP * V]→ [.VP * V]
Since Hindi is a verb final language, we restrict

VP inversion iff verb is its last child, as in 23.

to emphasize PP or sentential clause. See 24.362

5.4 Illustration of Reordering Rules
The rules are written using CLIPS (Giarratano
and Riley, 1998) where higher precedence rules
are given higher salience. In general, specific
rules have higher salience than a general rule. An
overview of the reordering rules is given in Table
2 where first column shows the reordering rules or
procedure and second column shows the effect of
that particular step.

6 Experiments and Results

We picked 500 Full-text sentences from COCA
(Davies, 2010) as SL input. These sentences were
divided into 20 sets of 25 sentences each. All these
input sets were translated in TL Hindi, using our
system and Google Translate. One human evalu-
ator evaluated two different sets and each set was
evaluated by three evaluators. In total 30 evalua-
tors rated the translation quality of both the sys-
tems on a scale of 0-4 (Bharati et al., 2004). As
per Bharati et al (2004) , this scale assesses trans-
lation quality in terms of comprehensibility. Note
that the identity of any system was not disclosed
to the human evaluators for unbiased ratings. We
found that on this scale Google Translate obtained
44.2% comprehensibility score while our system
obtained 51.8% comprehensibility score.

Out of these 20 sets, we selected 4 sets for En-
Hi word ordering quality assessment. The evalua-
tors were asked to rank these sets on the basis of
word order quality without giving much empha-
sis on translation quality. The evaluators rated the
sentences ‘0’ if the word order was unacceptable
(but still the sentence might be comprehensible in
some cases) and ‘1’ if the order was acceptable.

The reordering rules for our system were tested
for both gold and automatic constituency parse

based reordering accuracy. Table 3 shows the re-
ordering results.

The reordering rules were also tested on gold363



Anusāraka with gold parse 67%
Anusāraka with automatic parse 65.5%
Google Translate 42%

Table 3: Reordering accuracy results evaluated by
common people

and automatic constituency parse based input by
the developers but the reordering scale for devel-
opers was between 0-2 as shown in Table 4. See
the results in Figure 4.

0 unacceptable
1 non-fluent but acceptable
2 fluent/acceptable

Table 4: Reordering evaluation criteria for devel-
opers

Figure 4: Percentage of reordering accuracy for
En-Hi with and without gold parse

As expected, the results of the gold parse based
word order are slightly better than the automatic
parse based word ordering in case of developers’
as well as common peoples’ evaluation. The re-
sults confirm that a rule based reordering system
performs better than a SMT based system.

#Sentences #Words #Phrases

Table 5: Test Corpus

We also report phrase reordering accuracy
rather than sentence reordering accuracy, since our
rules basically reorder phrases/padas and just be-
cause of incorrect reordering of one phrase, penal-
izing sentences of around 50 word length does not
sound justified.

#Phrases
ordered
correctly

#Phrases

incorrectly

Gold parse 97.5% 2.5%
Automatic parse 93% 7%

Using our tool, Karan et al., (2014) have re-
ported 21.84 BLEU score improvement over the
baseline 20.04. After that the system has been im-
proved. It should also be noted that their paper
was not on reordering.

7 Error analysis

This section analyses various types of errors in TL
reordering output.

Some cases rated as ‘0’ were actually ordered
correctly but the evaluators rated them low due to
incorrect TL word substitutions. For instance, in
26, reported is translated as sūcanā dı̄, but in sys-
tem generated output it was translated as pāyā.

(26) Hubbard
Hubbard.NOM

reported
sūcanā de.PT

from
se

Cairo.
Cairo
‘Hubbard ne Cairo se sūcanā dı̄.’

In most of the cases, the adverbs like now,
mainly, likely, etc. were misplaced as shown in 27.
Or incorrect insertions of the words like ki (that),
isaliye (hence), etc. were made in TL as shown in
28. For example,

(27) Saleh is now in the U.S. for further medi-
cal treatment.

‘Saleh aba āge kı̄ cikitsā ke liye U.S. mem.
hai’

‘Saleh āge kı̄ cikitsā ke liye aba U.S. mem.
hai’

‘*Saleh āge kı̄ cikitsā ke liye U.S. mem.
aba hai’

(28) Since chalk first touched slate, schoolchil-
dren have wanted to know: What is on the
test?

In 28, insertion of taba se (thenceforth) is re-
quired for a fluent and comprehensible sentence in
Hindi.364



We noticed an interesting case where the shared
verb should be repeated while translation in Hindi.
For instance, in 29, the shared verb swim makes
two tiṅanta padas with each auxiliary/tiṅ, can and
help. There also, if the shared verb is a conjunct
verb, then the verbalizer/helping verb (Begum et
al., 2011) behaves as a dhātu and makes an inde-
pendent pada with the auxiliary as shown in bold
in 30.

8 Conclusion and Future Work

This paper presented reordering rules for English-
Hindi language pair using the concept of pada
from Pān. inian Grammar. We developed rules
for generating fluent English-Hindi word order.
We obtained better results than the SMT system
Google Translate which show that the rules are
accurate enough to enhance the translation qual-
ity. We elaborated on the concept of pada and
presented a method for identification of pada and
generation of reordering rules. We have also
claimed that the approach presented in this paper
is generic enough to be applied on English-Indian
language MT systems.
