Abstract 

In this paper, we present how we generated two rich online bilingual dictionaries — Lao-
French and French-Lao — from unstructured dictionaries in Microsoft Word files. Then we 
shortly discuss the possible reuse of the lexical data for Machine Translation projects. 

1 Introduction 

The creation of a dictionary with a large coverage is a very difficult and time-consuming task, when 
starting more or less from scratch. At INaLCO (Oriental Studies Institute, Paris, France), where the 
Lao language is taught, two dictionaries were recently published almost at the same time, making an 
outstanding milestone because of their coverage and their quality compared to the previous ones. We 
detail hereafter how we transformed them into digital resources. 

2 Available bilingual dictionaries containing the Lao language 

Bilingual resources with Lao as one of the languages are relatively rare and often poor. The main ones 
to our knowledge are (list limited to general bilingual dictionaries with more than 300 pages ; this list 
simply shows how scarce are the Lao-NL bilingual dictionaries):

Figure 1: Bilingual dictionaries including Lao (from Bernard Gay, 2003 [1], with additions) 

The number of pages provides (to a certain extent) a possibility to compare the quantity of lexical 
information between the dictionaries, but it does not allow evaluating their quality. The content is ac-
tually often limited to an entry, a part of speech, a pronunciation and only one word (thus one sense) 
as the translation. Moreover, some dictionaries are obviously partial or integral plagiarisms. 

 
As for the available online bilingual dictionaries, the main ones are with English: 

• http://sealang.net/lao/dictionary.htm 
o Lao ↔ English (both directions) 
o Derives from Kerr and from Patterson/Severino dictionaries 

• http://www.seasite.niu.edu/Lao/LDictionary/default.aspx 
o Lao → English 

• https://translate.google.fr 
o Lao ↔ English (both directions, through English for the other languages) 

and for French: 
• http://laosoftware.com/ 

o Lao ↔ French (both directions) 
o Relies on Paul Jadin’s dictionary

3 From unstructured dictionaries to clean databases with fine structures 

3.1 The original dictionaries in Microsoft Word files 

Recently, two relatively rich dictionaries (~40,000 entries, ~60,000 word-senses, ~15,000 expressions, 
many details including POS, examples, glosses, special plural forms, synonyms...) between Lao and 
French ([2], [3]) brought the opportunity to provide them as digital resources, as we were allowed to 
use their original Microsoft Word files. In both cases, the dictionary was made of one file per initial 
letter. Altogether, the authors spent about 40-50 years to produce these two dictionaries. 

3.2 Step 1: Parsing the Word files 

The first step towards constructing the database was to parse as finely as possible the Word files, in 
order to discover their fine-grained structure (“microstructure”). We used Claude Del Vigna’s “saint-
jean” compiler that generates parsers in C++. This task was quite complex as this structure could 
sometimes lack regularity or rigor. Actually, this step also included manual modifications in the files 
when parsing failed, in order to make the structure rigorously regular. A simple example among hun-
dreds or thousands: the POS could vary from entry to entry, giving (for “verbe transitif”) sometimes 
“vt”, “vt.”, “v.t.”, or even “v .t.” (with a white space inside). This step has certainly been the 
longest one, due to this iterative process, and also because the structure discovery itself was also itera-
tive. The rarest types of lexical information drove us to modify the parser every time they occurred, 
and also to reparse the parts already successfully parsed with the previous version of the parser. 

In order to exploit the style information available in the Word files, we chose to embed the parser in 
a Word addin1. A Word addin is a DLL library that is automatically loaded when Microsoft Word starts. 
This library must be placed in a specific directory (configurable in Word) and have “.wll” as file ex-
tension (instead of the usual “.dll”). Doing so, we could use the font name, size, and style to charac-
terize the different elements. For example, the legacy (non-Unicode) fonts used to write the parts in 
Lao language are never used for French, so these parts could be assigned the categories of either en-
try (Lao→French) or translation (French→Lao) or example in Lao... This was indeed very useful 
and even simply made the parsing possible. 

3.3 Step 2: Generating the lexical database 

The WLL was written in C++ and was compiled and linked with the SQLITE2 code to generate the 
lexical database. The generated tables are directly derived from the dictionary structure. Here is an 
example for the French→Lao dictionary (without the tables used to describe the examples).  

• Vedette (the main table with the lemma and an index for linking the other tables) 
o NumeroEntree (entry id) 
o Vedette (lemma) 

• Entree (table containing miscellaneous information for the entry) 
o NumeroEntree (entry id)  
o NumeroDeSens (sense id French) 
o CMS (POS) 
o Correlat (reference to other entries in the dictionary) 
o Exemple (example) 
o Pluriel (special plural forms) 
o Locution (in case the entry is part of a frozen expression) 
o CommentaireParentheses (gloss) 
o LocutionEtoile (gloss in case the entry is part of a frozen expression) 
o CMSLocutionEtoile (POS in case the entry is part of a frozen expression) 
o Synonyme (synonym) 

• Renvoi (table linking an entry to another, for example in case of multiple spellings) 
o NumeroEntree (entry id) 
o NumeroDeSensLao (sense id of the Lao translation referred to) 
o Renvoi (lemma of the reference entry)

• Traductions (table containing the translations) 
o NumeroEntree (entry id) 
o NumeroDeSensLao (sense id Lao) 
o Traduction (translation) 
o Commentaire (comment in Lao associated to the translation) 
o Abreviation (abbreviation in Lao associated to the translation) 

3.4 Step 3: Cleaning the lexical database 

A meticulous verification step followed the generation of the database. Some errors still remained and 
had to be fixed. Then, we still had to transform into Unicode the parts that were initially written with 
non-Unicode fonts. This was the case for the parts written in Lao as well as the IPA transcriptions (for 
the Lao→French dictionary only). 

Nota: An ongoing work is currently being done by Lamvieng Inthamone to refine the structure of 
the Lao-French dictionary, so that the two dictionaries will be at the same level. This is done in an Ex-
cel file extracted from the cleaned database. 

3.5 Step 4: Creating the software for the online dictionary look-up 

The last step was to make the dictionaries available online. As we wanted to provide the users with the 
possibility, for the Lao→French direction, to submit strings containing more than one word (it is not 
always easy to know where a word starts and ends, as there are no spaces between words in Lao), the 
first thing to do was to embed a word segmenter in the translation process. We chose the general-
purpose segmenter MOTOR (see [4], [5]) and embedded it as the initial phase of the translation pipeline 
from Lao to French. In order to make the translations consistent with the segmentation, the segmenter 
was configured with the list of entries of the Lao→French dictionary. Then, when a string contains 
several Lao words, several requests are done in AJAX towards the server. 

The dictionaries are available at http://laosoftware.com/HeloiseTest/Dicolofr/indexnew.htm. 

4 Conclusion 

The Lao-French and French-Lao dictionaries are available online since early 2016 and the first feed-
backs are very positive. Now, the next step will be to use the associated lexical databases to bootstrap 
the creation of dictionaries for Lao→French and French→Lao machine translation systems. This can 
be done semi-automatically by associating the lemmas in French with the lexical units of the existing 
analysis and generation modules of French. The examples in the dictionaries, which are most generally 
multi-word expressions, can be associated to the existing MWEs of the analysers or added when ab-
sent. 

Another interesting use of the lexical databases would be to link the Lao words to words in other 
languages, thanks to existing dictionaries between French and other languages, or using interlingual 
lexical units such as WordNet synsets3 or UNL Universal Words4. A further possibility would be to 
build MT systems between Lao and many other languages using UNL graphs as pivot representations.
