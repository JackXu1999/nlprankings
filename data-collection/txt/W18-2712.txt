Abstract

Neural machine translation (NMT) has
significantly improved the quality of au-
tomatic translation models. One of the
main challenges in current systems is the
translation of rare words. We present a
generic approach to address this weak-
ness by having external models annotate
the training data as Experts, and con-
trol the model-expert interaction with a
pointer network and reinforcement learn-
ing. Our experiments using phrase-based
models to simulate Experts to comple-
ment neural machine translation mod-
els show that the model can be trained
to copy the annotations into the output
consistently. We demonstrate the ben-
efit of our proposed framework in out-
of-domain translation scenarios with only
lexical resources, improving more than 1.0
BLEU point in both translation directions
English→Spanish and German→English.

1 Introduction
Sequence to sequence models have recently be-
come the state-of-the-art approach for machine
translation (Luong et al., 2015; Vaswani et al.,
2017). This model architecture can directly ap-
proximate the conditional probability of the tar-
get sequence given a source sequence using neural
networks (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013). As
a result, not only do they model a smoother prob-
ability distribution (Bengio et al., 2003) than the
sparse phrase tables in statistical machine trans-
lation (Koehn et al., 2003), but they can also
jointly learn translation models, language models
and even alignments in a single model (Bahdanau
et al., 2014).

One of the main weaknesses of neural machine

translation models is poor handling of low fre-
quency events. Neural models tend to priori-
tize output fluency over translation adequacy, and
faced with rare words either silently ignore in-
put (Koehn and Knowles, 2017) or fall into under-
or over-translation (Tu et al., 2016). Examples
of these situations include named entities, dates,
and rare morphological forms. Improper handling
of rare events can be harmful to industrial sys-
tems (Wu et al., 2016), where translation mistakes
can have serious ramifications. Similarly, translat-
ing in specific domains such as information tech-
nology or biology, a slight change in vocabulary
can drastically alter meaning. It is important, then,
to address translation of rare words.

While domain-specific parallel corpora can be
used to adapt translation models efficiently (Luong
and Manning, 2015), parallel corpora for many
domains can be difficult to collect, and this re-
quires continued training. Translation lexicons,
however, are much more commonly available. In
this work, we introduce a strategy to incorporate
external lexical knowledge, dubbed “Expert an-
notation,” into neural machine translation models.
First, we annotate the lexical translations directly
into the source side of the parallel data, so that the
information is exposed during both training and
inference. Second, inspired by CopyNet (Gu et al.,
2016), we utilize a pointer network (Vinyals et al.,
2015) to introduce a copy distribution over the
source sentence, to increase the generation prob-
ability of rare words. Given that the expert anno-
tation can differ from the reference, in order to en-
courage the model to copy the annotation we use
reinforcement learning to guide the search, giving
rewards when the annotation is used. Our work
is motivated to be able to achieve One-Shot learn-
ing, which can help the model to accurately trans-
late the events that are annotated during inference.
Such ability can be transferred from an Expert



101

which is capable of learning to translate lexically
with one or few examples, such as dictionaries, or
phrase-tables, or even human annotators.

We realize our proposed framework
with experiments on English→Spanish and
German→English translation tasks. We focus
on translation of rare events using translation
suggestions from an Expert, here simulated by
an additional phrase table. Specifically, we
annotate rare words in our parallel data with best
candidates from a phrase table before training,
so that rare events are provided with suggested
translations. Our model can be explicitly trained
to copy the annotation approximately 90% of
the time, and it outperformed the baselines on
translation accuracy of rare words, reaching up to
97% accuracy. Also importantly, this performance
is maintained when translating data in a different
domain. Further analysis was done to verify the
potential of our proposed framework.

2 Background - Neural Machine
Translation

Neural machine translation (NMT) consists of an
encoder and a decoder (Sutskever et al., 2014;
Vaswani et al., 2017) that directly approximate
the conditional probability of a target sequence
Y = y1, y2, · · · , yT given a source sequence X =
x1, x2, · · · , xM . The model is normally trained to
maximize the log-likelihood of each target token
given the previous words as well as the source se-
quence with respect to model parameters θ as in
Equation 1:

logP (Y |X; θ) =
ΣTt=1(logP (yt|X, y1, y2, · · · , yt − 1))

(1)

The advantages of NMT compared to phrased-
based machine translation come from the neural
architecture components:

• The embedding layers, which are shared be-
tween samples, allow the model to con-
tinuously represent discrete words and ef-
fectively capture word relationship (Bengio
et al., 2003; Mikolov et al., 2013). Notably
we refer to two different embedding layers
being used in most models, one for the first
input layer of the encoder/decoder, and an-
other one at the decoder output layer that is
used to compute the probability distribution
(Equation 1).

The source sentence is annotated with experts be-
fore learning. The model learns to utilize the an-
notation by using them directly in the translation)

• Complex neural architectures like
LSTMs (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber,
1997) or Transformers (Vaswani et al.,
2017) can represent structural sequences
(sentences, phrases) effectively.

• Attention models (Bahdanau et al., 2014; Lu-
ong et al., 2015) are capable of hierarchi-
cally modeling the translation mapping be-
tween sentence pairs.

The challenges of NMT These models are often
attacked over their inability to learn to translate
rare events, which are often named entities and
rare morphological variants (Arthur et al., 2016;
Koehn and Knowles, 2017; Nguyen and Chiang,
2017). Learning from rare events is difficult due
to the fact that the model parameters are not ade-
quately updated. For example, the embeddings of
the rare words are only updated a few times during
training, and similarly for the patterns learned by
the recurrent structures in the encoders / decoders
and attention models.

3 Expert framework description
Human translators can benefit from external
knowledge such as dictionaries, particularly in
specific domains. Similarly, the idea behind our
framework is to rely on external models to anno-
tate extra input into the source side of the train-
ing data, which we refer as Experts. Such expert
models would not necessarily outperform NMT
models themselves, but rather complement them
and compensate for their weaknesses.

The illustration of the proposed framework is
given in Figure 1. Before the learning process, the
source sentence is annotated by one or several ex-
pert models, which we abstract as any model that



102

can show additional data perspectives. For ex-
ample, these experts could be a terminology list
or a statistical phrase-based system to generate
translations for specific phrases, but it can also be
used in various other situations. For example, we
might use it to integrate a model that can do metric
conversion or handling of links to web addresses,
which can be useful for certain applications. Then
NMT model then learns to translate to the target
sentence using the annotated source.

3.1 Annotation

The aforementioned idea of Experts in our work is
inspired by the fact that human translators can ben-
efit from domain experts when translating domain-
specific content. Accordingly, we design the anno-
tation and training process as follows:

• Words are identified as candidates for anno-
tation using a frequency threshold.

• Look up possible translations of the candi-
dates from the Expert and annotate them di-
rectly next to the candidates. We use special
bounding symbols to help guide the model to
copy the annotation during translation.

• Train a neural machine translation model us-
ing these annotated sentences.

• During inference, we annotate the source sen-
tence in the same fashion as in training.

Byte-Pair encoding We consider BPE (Sen-
nrich et al., 2016) one of the crucial factors for an-
notation in order to efficiently represent words that
do not appear in the training data. The rare words
(and their translation suggestions, which can be
rare as well) are split into smaller segments, al-
leviating the problem of dealing with UNK to-
kens (Luong et al., 2014).

Embedding sharing Our annotation method in-
cludes target language tokens directly in the
source sentence. In order to make the model per-
ceive these words the same way in the source
and the target, we create a joint vocabulary of the
source and target language and simply tie the em-
bedding projection matrices of the source encoder,
target encoder and target decoder. This practice
has been explored in various language modeling
works (Press and Wolf, 2016; Inan et al., 2016) to
improve regularisation.

3.2 Copy-Generator

Hypothetically, the model could learn to simply
ignore the annotation during optimization because
it contains strange symbols (the target language) in
source language sentences. If this were the case,
adding annotations would not help translate rare
events.

Therefore, inspired by the CopyNet (Gu et al.,
2016; Gulcehre et al., 2016), which originates
from pointer networks (Vinyals et al., 2015) that
learn to pick the tokens that appeared in the
memory of the models, we incorporate the copy-
mechanism into the neural translation model so
that the annotations can be simply pasted into the
translation. Explicitly, the conditional probability
is now presented as a mixture of two distributions:
copy and generated.

P (Y |X; θ) =
ΣTt=1[γPG(yt|X, y1, y2, · · · , yt − 1)

+(1− γ)PC(yt|X, y1, y2, · · · , yt − 1)]
(2)

The distribution over the whole vocabulary PG
is estimated from the softmax layer using equa-
tion 1, and the copy distribution PC is used
from the attention layer from the decoder state
over the context (dubbed ‘alignment’ in previ-
ous works (Bahdanau et al., 2014)). The mixture
coefficient γ controls the bias between the mix-
tures and is estimated using a feed-forward neu-
ral network layer with a sigmoid function, which
is placed on top of the decoder hidden state (be-
fore the final output softmax layer 1). Ideally, the
model learns to adjust between copying the input
annotation or generating a translation.

It is important to note that, in previous works the
authors had to build dynamic vocabulary for each
sample due to the vocabulary mismatch between
the source and target (Gu et al., 2016). Since
we tied the embeddings of source and target lan-
guages, it becomes trivial to combine the two dis-
tributions. The use of byte-pair encodings also
helps to eliminate unknown words on both sides,
alleviating the task of excluding copying unknown
tokens.

3.3 Reinforcement Learning

Why reinforcement learning While our anno-
tation provides target language tokens that can be

1Using an additional attention layer yields similar result.



103

directly copied to the generated output, and the
copy generator allows a direct gradient path from
the output to the annotation, the annotation is not
guaranteed to be in the reference. When this is the
case, the model does not receive the learning sig-
nal to copy the annotation.

In order to remedy this, we propose to cast the
problem as a reinforcement learning task (Ranzato
et al., 2015) in which we have the model sam-
ple and provide a learning signal by rewarding the
model if it copies the annotation into the target, as
seen in the loss function in Equation 3:

L(θ) = −EW∼pθ(r(W,REF )) (3)

.

Reward function For this purpose, we designed
a reward function that can encourage the model
to prioritize copying the annotation into the target,
but still maintain a reasonable translation quality.
For suggestion utilization, we denote HIT as the
score function that gives rewards for every overlap
of the output and the suggestion. If all annotated
words are used then HIT (W,REF ) = 1.0, oth-
erwise the percentage of the copied words. For the
translation score, we use the GLEU function (Wu
et al., 2016) - the minimum of recall and precision
of the n-grams up to 4-gram between the sample
and the reference, which has been reported to cor-
respond well with corpus-level translation metrics
such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002). The reward
function is defined as in Equation 4:

r(W,REF ) = αHIT (W,REF )+

(1− α)GLEU(W,REF )
(4)

Variance reduction The use of reinforcement
learning with translation models has been ex-
plored in various works (Ranzato et al., 2015; Bah-
danau et al., 2016; Rennie et al., 2016; Nguyen
et al., 2017), in which the models are difficult
to train due to the high variance of the gradi-
ents (Schulman et al., 2017). To tackle this prob-
lem, we follow the Self-Critical model proposed
by (Rennie et al., 2016) for variance reduction:

• Pre-training the model using cross-entropy
loss (Eq. 1) to obtain a solid initialization pre-
search, which allows the model to achieve
reasonable rewards to learn faster.

• During the reinforcement phase, for each
sample/mini-batch, the decoder explores the

search space with Markov chain Monte Carlo
sampling, and at the same time performs a
greedy search for a ‘baseline’ performance.
We encourage the model to perform better
than baseline, which is used to decide the sign
of the gradients (Williams, 1992).

Notably, there is no gradient flowing in the
baseline subgraph since the argmax operators used
in the greedy search are not differentiable.

4 Experiment setup
In the experiments, we realise the generic
framework described in Section 3 with the
tasks of translating from English→Spanish and
German→English.

For both language pairs, we used data
from Europarl (version 7) (Koehn, 2005) and
IWSLT17 (Cettolo et al., 2012) to train our neu-
ral networks. For validation, we use the IWSLT
validation set (dev2010) to select the best mod-
els based on perplexity (for cross-entropy loss)
and BLEU score (for reinforcement learning). For
evaluation, we use IWSLT tst2010 as the in-
domain test set. We also evaluate our models on
out-of-domain corpora. For English→Spanish an
additional Business dataset is used. The corpus
statistics can be seen on Table 1. The out-of-
domain experiments for the German→English are
carried out on the medical domain, in which we
use the UFAL Medical Corpus v1.0 corpus (2.2
million sentences) to train the Expert and the Or-
acle system. The test data for this task is the
HIML2017 dataset with 1517 sentences. We pre-
process all the data using standard tokenization,
true-casing and BPE splitting with 40K joined op-
erations.

4.1 Implementation details

Our base neural machine translation follows the
neural machine translation with global attention
model described in (Luong et al., 2015) 2. The
encoder is a bidirectional LSTM network, while
the decoder is an LSTM with attention, which
is a 2-layer feed-forward neural network (Bah-
danau et al., 2014). We also use the input-feeding
method (Luong et al., 2015) and context-gate (Tu
et al., 2016) to improve model coverage. All net-
works in our experiments have layer size (em-
bedding and hidden) of 512 (English→Spanish)

2The framework is implemented in PyTorch, which will
be made public with the final version of the paper



104

and 1024 (German→English) with 2 LSTM lay-
ers. Dropout is put vertically between LSTM lay-
ers to improve regularization (Pham et al., 2014).
We create mini-batches with maximum 128 sen-
tence pairs of the same source size. For cross-
entropy training, the parameters are optimized us-
ing Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with a learning
rate annealing schedule suggested in (Denkowski
and Neubig, 2017), starting from 0.001 until
0.00025. After reaching convergence on the train-
ing data, we fine-tune the models on the IWSLT
training set with learning rate of 0.0002. Finally,
we use our best models on the validation data as
the initialization for reinforcement learning using
a learning rate of 0.0001, which is done on the
IWSLT set for 50 epochs. Beam search is used
for decoding.

4.2 Phrase-based Experts

We selected phrase tables for the Experts in our
experiments. While other resources like terminol-
ogy lists can also be used for the translation an-
notations, our motivation here is that the phrase-
tables can additionally capture multi-word phrase
pairs, and additionally can better capture the dis-
tribution tail of rare phrases as compared to neural
models (Koehn and Knowles, 2017). We selected
the translation with the highest average probabili-
ties in the 4 phrase table scores for annotation.

On the English→Spanish task, the phrase tables
are trained on the same data as the NMT model,
while on the German→English direction, we sim-
ulate the situation when the expert is not in the
same domain as the test data to observe the po-
tentials. Therefore, we train an additional table on
the UFAL Medical Corpus v.1.0 corpus (which is
not observed by the NMT model) to for the out-
of-domain annotation.

5 Evaluation

5.1 Research questions

We aim to find the answers to the following re-
search questions:

• Given the annotation quality being imperfect,
how much does it affect the overall transla-
tion quality?

• How much does annotation participate in
translating rare words, and how consistently
can the model learn to copy the annotation?

• How will the model perform in a new do-
main? The copy mechanism does not depend
on the domain of the training or adaptation
data, which is optimal.

5.2 Evaluation Metrics

To serve the research questions above, we use the
following evaluation metrics:

• BLEU: score for general translation quality.

• SUGGESTION (SUG): The overlap between
the hypothesis and the phrase-table (on word
level), showing how much the expert content
is used by the model.

• SUGGESTION ACCURACY (SAC): The
intersection between the hypothesis, the
phrase-table suggestions and the reference.
This metrics shows us the accuracy of the
system on the rare-words which are sug-
gested by the phrase-table.

Discussion The SUG metric shows the consis-
tency of the model on the copy mechanism. Mod-
els with lower SUG are not necessarily worse, and
models with high SUG can potentially have very
low recall on rare-word translation by systemati-
cally copying bad suggestions and failing to trans-
late rare-words where the annotator is incorrect.
However, we argue that a high SUG system can be
used reliably with a high quality expert. For ex-
ample, in censorship management or name trans-
lation which is strictly sensitive, this quality can
help reducing output inconsistency. On the other
hand, the SAC metrics show improvement on rare-
word translation, but only on the intersection of
the phrase table and the reference. This subset
is our main focus. General rare-word translation
quality requires additional effort to find the refer-
ence aligned to the rare words in the source sen-
tences, which we consider for future work.

5.3 Experimental results

English→Spanish Results for this task are pre-
sented on table 2. First, the main difference be-
tween the settings is the SUG and SAC figures
for all test sets. Both of them increase dramat-
ically from baseline to annotation, and also in-
crease according to the level of supervision in our
model proposals. While the copy mechanism can
help us to copy more from the annotation, the
REINFORCE models are successfully trained to

make the model copy more consistently. Their
combination helps us achieve the desired behav-
ior, in which almost all of the annotations given
are copied, and we achieve 100% accuracy on the
rare-words section that the phrase table covers. As
mentioned in the discussion above, the SAC and
SUG figures, while being not enough to quanti-
tatively prove that the total number of rare words
translated, show that the phrase table is comple-
mentary to the neural machine translation, and the
more coverage the expert has, the more benefit this
method can bring.

We notice an improvement of 1 BLEU point
on dev2010 but only slight changes compared to
the baseline on tst2010. On the out-of-domain
set, however, the improved rare-word performance

leads to an increase of 1.7 BLEU points over the
baseline without annotation. Our models, despite
training on a noisier dataset, are able to improve
translation quality.

German→English Results are shown in Ta-
ble 3. On the dev2010 and tst2010 in-domain
datasets, we observe similar phenomena to the En-
Es direction. Rare-word performance increases
with the number of words copied, and the combi-
nation of the copy mechanism and REINFORCE
help us copy consistently. Surprisingly, however,
the BLEU score drops with annotations. This
may be because of the relative morphologically
complexity of the German words compared to the
English, making it harder to generate the correct



106

word form.
In the experiments with an out-of-domain test

set (HIML), we use annotations from that do-
main to simulate a domain-expert. For compari-
son, we also trained an NMT model adapted to the
UFAL corpus, which we call the Oracle model.
In this domain, our models show the same be-
havior, in which almost every word annotated is
copied to the output. The annotation efficiently
improves translation quality by 1.7 BLEU points
over the baseline without annotation. The adapted
model has a higher BLEU score, but here per-
forms worse than our annotated model in terms
of phrase-table overlap and rare-word translation
accuracy for words in this set. Our model shows
significantly better rare word handling than the
baseline. Though the best obtainable system is
adapted to the in-domain data, this requires par-
allel text: this experiment shows the high poten-
tial to improve NMT on out-of-domain scenarios
using only lexical-level materials. We notice a
surprising drop of 1.0 BLEU points for the RE-
INFORCE model. Possible reasons include inef-
ficient beam search on REINFORCE models, or
the GLEU signal was out-weighted by the HIT
one during training, which is known for the dif-
ficulty (Zaremba and Sutskever, 2015).

5.4 Further Analysis

Name translation Names can often be trans-
lated by BPE, but it is noticeable about examples
of the inconsistency, which can be alleviated using
annotations, as illustrated in Figure 2-Top.

Copying long phrases We find that with very
high supervision, the model can learn to copy even
phrases completely into the output, as in Figure 2-
Bottom. Though this is potentially dangerous,
as the output may the lose the additional fluency
which comes from NMT, it is controllable by com-
bining RL and cross entropy loss (Paulus et al.,
2017).

Attention Plotting the attention map for the de-
coded sequences we notice that, while we marked
the beginning and end of annotated sections and
the separation between the source and the sugges-
tion with # and ## tokens, those positions received
very little weight from the decoder. One possible
explanation is that these tokens do not contribute
to the translation when decoding, and the annota-
tions may useful without bounding tags. For the
annotations used in the translation, we identified

two prominent cases; for the rare words whose
annotation need only be identically copied to the
target, the attention map focuses evenly on both
source and annotation, while the heat map typi-
cally heavily emphasizes only the annotation oth-
erwise. An example is illustrated in figure 3.

Effect of α The full results with respect to dif-
ferent α values which are used in Equation 3 for
reward weighting can be seen in Table 4. Higher α
values emphasize the signal to copy the source an-
notation, as can be seen from the increase in terms
of Accuracy and Suggestion utilization across the
values. As expected, as α goes toward 1.0, the
model gradually loses the signal needed to main-
tain translation quality and finally diverges.

6 Related Work
Translating rare words in neural machine
translation is a rich and active topic, particularly
when translating morphologically rich languages
or translating named entities. Sub-word unit de-
composition or BPE (Sennrich et al., 2016) has
become the de-facto standard in most neural trans-
lation systems (Wu et al., 2016). Using phrase ta-
bles to handle rare words was previously explored
in (Luong et al., 2014), but was not compatible
with BPE. (Gulcehre et al., 2016) explored us-
ing pointer networks to copy source words to the
translation output, which could benefit from our
design but would require significant changes to the
architecture and likely be limited to copying only.
Additionally, models that can learn to remember
rare events were explored in (Kaiser et al., 2017).

Our work builds on the idea of using a phrase-
based neural machine translation to augment
source data, (Niehues et al., 2016; Denkowski and
Neubig, 2017), but can be extended to any an-
notation type without complicated hybrid phrase-
based neural machine translation systems. We
were additionally inspired by the use of feature

originally split by BPE into ‘K’ and ‘ean’. This is incorrectly translated without annotation (in blue) and
corrected with the annotation (in red). Bottom: An example of phrase copying, in which the German

naries and phrase-tables in (Zhang et al., 2017).
They also rely on sample-based techniques, (Shen
et al., 2015), to train their networks, but their com-
putation is more expensive than the self-critical
network in our work. We focus here on rare events,
with the possibility to construct interactive models
for fast updating without retraining. We also use
the ideas of using REINFORCE to train sequence
generators for arbitrary rewards (Ranzato et al.,
2015; Nguyen et al., 2017; Bahdanau et al., 2016).
While this method remains difficult to train, it is
promising to use to achieve non-probabilistic fea-
tures for neural models: for example enforcing
formality in outputs in German, or censoring un-
desired outputs.

7 Conclusion
In this work, we presented a framework to alle-
viate the weaknesses of neural machine transla-

tion models by incorporating external knowledge
as Experts and training the models to use their
annotations using reinforcement learning and a
pointer network. We show improvements over
the unannotated model on both in- and out-of-
domain datasets. When only lexical resources
are available and in-domain fine-tuning cannot be
performed, our framework can improve perfor-
mance. The annotator might potentially be trained
together with the main model to balance transla-
tion quality with copying annotations, which our
current framework seems to be biased to.
