Abstract

When writing a summary, humans tend to
choose content from one or two sentences and
merge them into a single summary sentence.
However, the mechanisms behind the selec-
tion of one or multiple source sentences remain
poorly understood. Sentence fusion assumes
multi-sentence input; yet sentence selection
methods only work with single sentences and
not combinations of them. There is thus a cru-
cial gap between sentence selection and fusion
to support summarizing by both compressing
single sentences and fusing pairs. This pa-
per attempts to bridge the gap by ranking sen-
tence singletons and pairs together in a uni-
fied space. Our proposed framework attempts
to model human methodology by selecting ei-
ther a single sentence or a pair of sentences,
then compressing or fusing the sentence(s) to
produce a summary sentence. We conduct ex-
tensive experiments on both single- and multi-
document summarization datasets and report
findings on sentence selection and abstraction.

1 Introduction

Abstractive summarization aims at presenting the
main points of an article in a succinct and coherent
manner. To achieve this goal, a proficient editor
can rewrite a source sentence into a more succinct
form by dropping inessential sentence elements
such as prepositional phrases and adjectives. She
can also choose to fuse multiple source sentences
into one by reorganizing the points in a coherent
manner. In fact, it appears to be common practice
to summarize by either compressing single sen-
tences or fusing multiple sentences. We investi-
gate this hypothesis by analyzing human-written
abstracts contained in three large datasets: DUC-
04 (Over and Yen, 2004), CNN/Daily Mail (Her-
mann et al., 2015), and XSum (Narayan et al.,
2018). For every summary sentence, we find its
ground-truth set containing one or more source

ment sentences when writing a summary sentence.

sentences that exhibit a high degree of similarity
with the summary sentence (details in §4). As
shown in Figure 1, across the three datasets, 60-
85% of summary sentences are generated by fus-
ing one or two source sentences.

Selecting summary-worthy sentences has been
studied in the literature, but there lacks a mecha-
nism to weigh sentence singletons and pairs in a
unified space. Extractive methods focus on select-
ing sentence singletons using greedy (Carbonell
and Goldstein, 1998), optimization-based (Gillick
and Favre, 2009; Kulesza and Taskar, 2011;
Cho et al., 2019), and (non-)autoregressive meth-
ods (Cheng and Lapata, 2016; Kedzie et al., 2018).
In contrast, existing sentence fusion studies tend
to assume ground sets of source sentences are al-
ready provided, and the system fuses each set of
sentences into a single one (Daumé III and Marcu,
2004; Filippova, 2010; Thadani and McKeown,
2013). There is thus a crucial gap between sen-
tence selection and fusion to support summarizing
by both compressing single sentences and fusing
pairs. This paper attempts to bridge the gap by
ranking singletons and pairs together by their like-
lihoods of producing summary sentences.

The selection of sentence singletons and pairs
can bring benefit to neural abstractive summa-
rization, as a number of studies seek to separate
content selection from summary generation (Chen



2176

and Bansal, 2018; Hsu et al., 2018; Gehrmann
et al., 2018; Lebanoff et al., 2018). Content selec-
tion draws on domain knowledge to identify rel-
evant content, while summary generation weaves
together selected source and vocabulary words to
form a coherent summary. Despite having local
coherence, system summaries can sometimes con-
tain erroneous details (See et al., 2017) and forged
content (Cao et al., 2018b; Song et al., 2018).
Separating the two tasks of content selection and
summary generation allows us to closely examine
the compressing and fusing mechanisms of an ab-
stractive summarizer.

In this paper we propose a method to learn to
select sentence singletons and pairs, which then
serve as the basis for an abstractive summarizer to
compose a summary sentence-by-sentence, where
singletons are shortened (i.e., compressed) and
pairs are merged (i.e., fused). We exploit state-
of-the-art neural representations and traditional
vector space models to characterize singletons
and pairs; we then provide suggestions on the
types of representations useful for summarization.
Experiments are performed on both single- and
multi-document summarization datasets, where
we demonstrate the efficacy of selecting sentence
singletons and pairs as well as its utility to ab-
stractive summarization. Our research contribu-
tions can be summarized as follows:

• the present study fills an important gap by se-
lecting sentence singletons and pairs jointly, as-
suming a summary sentence can be created by
either shortening a singleton or merging a pair.
Compared to abstractive summarizers that per-
form content selection implicitly, our method is
flexible and can be extended to multi-document
summarization where training data is limited;

• we investigate the factors involved in represent-
ing sentence singletons and pairs. We perform
extensive experiments and report findings on
sentence selection and abstraction.1

2 Related Work

Content selection is integral to any summarization
system. Neural approaches to abstractive sum-
marization often perform content selection jointly
with surface realization using an encoder-decoder
architecture (Rush et al., 2015; Nallapati et al.,

1We make our code and models publicly available at https:
//github.com/ucfnlp/summarization-sing-pair-mix

2016; Chen et al., 2016b; Tan et al., 2017; See
et al., 2017; Paulus et al., 2017; Celikyilmaz et al.,
2018; Narayan et al., 2018). Training these models
end-to-end means learning to perform both tasks
simultaneously and can require a massive amount
of data that is unavailable and unaffordable for
many summarization tasks.

Recent approaches emphasize the importance of
separating content selection from summary gener-
ation for abstractive summarization. Studies ex-
ploit extractive methods to identify content words
and sentences that should be part of the sum-
mary and use them to guide the generation of ab-
stracts (Chen and Bansal, 2018; Gehrmann et al.,
2018; Lebanoff et al., 2018). On the other hand,
surface lexical features have been shown to be ef-
fective in identifying pertinent content (Carenini
et al., 2006; Wong et al., 2008; Galanis et al.,
2012). Examples include sentence length, posi-
tion, centrality, word frequency, whether a sen-
tence contains topic words, and others. The sur-
face cues can also be customized for new domains
relatively easily. This paper represents a step for-
ward in this direction, where we focus on develop-
ing lightweight models to select summary-worthy
sentence singletons and pairs and use them as the
basis for summary generation.

A succinct sentence can be generated by short-
ening or rewriting a lengthy source text. Recent
studies have leveraged neural encoder-decoder
models to rewrite the first sentence of an article to
a title-like summary (Nallapati et al., 2016; Zhou
et al., 2017; Li et al., 2017; Song et al., 2018; Guo
et al., 2018; Cao et al., 2018a). Compressive sum-
maries can be generated in a similar vein by se-
lecting important source sentences and then drop-
ping inessential sentence elements such as prepo-
sitional phrases. Before the era of deep neural net-
works it has been an active area of research, where
sentence selection and compression can be accom-
plished using a pipeline or a joint model (Daumé
III and Marcu, 2002; Zajic et al., 2007; Gillick and
Favre, 2009; Wang et al., 2013; Li et al., 2013,
2014; Filippova et al., 2015). A majority of these
studies focus on selecting and compressing sen-
tence singletons only.

A sentence can also be generated through fus-
ing multiple source sentences. However, many
aspects of this approach are largely underinvesti-
gated, such as determining the set of source sen-
tences to be fused, handling its large cardinality,

and identifying the sentence relationships for per-
forming fusion. Previous studies assume a set
of similar source sentences can be gathered by
clustering sentences or by comparing to a refer-
ence summary sentence (Barzilay and McKeown,
2005; Filippova, 2010; Shen and Li, 2010; Chenal
and Cheung, 2016; Liao et al., 2018); but these
methods can be suboptimal. Joint models for sen-
tence selection and fusion implicitly perform con-
tent planning (Martins and Smith, 2009; Berg-
Kirkpatrick et al., 2011; Bing et al., 2015; Durrett
et al., 2016) and there is limited control over which
sentences are merged and how.

In contrast, this work attempts to teach the sys-
tem to determine if a sentence singleton or a pair
should be selected to produce a summary sen-
tence. A sentence pair (A, B) is preferred over its
consisting sentences if they carry complementary
content. Table 1 shows an example. Sentence B
contains a reference (“the attack”) and A contains
a more complete description for it (“bombing that
killed 58”). Sentences A and B each contain cer-
tain valuable information, and an appropriate way
to merge them exists. As a result, a sentence pair
can be scored higher than a singleton given the
content it carries and compatibility of its consist-
ing sentences. In the following we describe meth-
ods to represent singletons and pairs in a unified
framework and scoring them for summarization.

3 Our Model

We present the first attempt to transform sentence
singletons and pairs to real-valued vector repre-
sentations capturing semantic salience so that they
can be measured against each other (§3.1). This is
a nontrivial task, as it requires a direct comparison
of texts of varying length—a pair of sentences is
almost certainly longer than a single sentence. For
sentence pairs, the representations are expected to
further encode sentential semantic compatibility.
In §3.2, we describe our method to utilize highest
scoring singletons and pairs to a neural abstractive
summarizer to generate summaries.

3.1 Scoring Sentence Singletons and Pairs
Given a document or set of documents, we create
a setD of singletons and pairs by gathering all sin-
gle sentences and arbitrary pairs of them. We refer
to a singleton or pair in the set as an instance. The
sentences in a pair are arranged in order of their
appearance in the document or by date of docu-
ments. Let N be the number of single sentences
in the input document(s), a complete set of sin-
gletons and pairs will contain |D|=N(N−1)2 +N in-
stances. Our goal is to score each instance based
on the amount of summary-worthy content it con-
veys. Despite their length difference, a singleton
can be scored higher than a pair if it contains a sig-
nificant amount of salient content. Conversely, a
pair can outweigh a singleton if its component sen-
tences are salient and compatible with each other.

Building effective representations for singletons
and pairs is therefore of utmost importance. We
attempt to build a vector representation for each
instance. The representation should be invariant
to the instance type, i.e., a singleton or pair. In this
paper we exploit the BERT architecture (Devlin
et al., 2018) to learn instance representations. The
representations are fine-tuned for a classification
task predicting whether a given instance contains
content used in human-written summary sentences
(details for ground-truth creation in §4).

BERT BERT supports our goal of encoding
singletons and pairs indiscriminately. It introduces
two pretraining tasks to build deep contextual rep-
resentations for words and sequences. A sequence
can be a single sentence (A) or pair of sentences
(A+B).2 The first task predicts missing words in
the input sequence. The second task predicts if
B is the next sentence following A. It requires the
vector representation for (A+B) to capture the co-
herence of two sentences. As coherent sentences
can often be fused together, we conjecture that the
second task is particularly suited for our goal.

2In the original BERT paper (Devlin et al., 2018), a “sen-
tence” is used in a general sense to denote an arbitrary span
of contiguous text; we refer to an actual linguistic sentence.

Concretely, BERT constructs an input sequence
by prepending a singleton or pair with a “[CLS]”
symbol and delimiting the two sentences of a pair
with “[SEP].” The representation learned for the
[CLS] symbol is used as an aggregate sequence rep-
resentation for the later classification task. We
show an example input sequence in Eq. (1). In
the case of a singleton, wBi are padding tokens.

{wi}= [CLS],wA1 ,wA2 ,..., [SEP],wB1 ,wB2 ,..., [SEP] (1)
ei=ew(wi)+esgmt(wi)+ewpos(wi)+espos(wi) (2)

In Eq. (2), each token wi is characterized by
an input embedding ei, calculated as the element-
wise sum of the following embeddings:

• ew(wi) is a token embedding;
• esgmt(wi) is a segment embedding, signifying

whether wi comes from sentence A or B.

• ewpos(wi) is a word position embedding indicat-
ing the index of wi in the input sequence;

• we introduce espos(wi) to be a sentence posi-
tion embedding; if wi is from sentence A (or B),
espos(wi) is the embedding indicating the index
of sentence A (or B) in the original document.

Intuitively, these embeddings mean that, the ex-
tent to which a word contributes to the sequence
(A+B) representation depends on these factors: (i)
word salience, (ii) importance of sentences A and
B, (iii) word position in the sequence, and, (iv)
sentence position in the document. These factors
coincide with heuristics used in summarization lit-
erature (Nenkova and McKeown, 2011), where
leading sentences of a document and the first few
words of a sentence are more likely to be included
in the summary.

The input embeddings are then fed to a multi-
layer and multi-head attention architecture to build
deep contextual representations for tokens. Each
layer employs a Transformer block (Vaswani et al.,
2017), which introduces a self-attention mech-
anism that allows each hidden state hli to be
compared with every other hidden state of the
same layer [hl1,h

multi-head attention mechanism (Eq. (3-4)).

The representation at final layer L for the [CLS]
symbol is used as the sequence representation

hL[CLS]. The representations can be fine-tuned with
an additional output layer to generate state-of-
the-art results on a wide range of tasks including
reading comprehension and natural language in-
ference. We use the pretrained BERT base model
and fine-tune it on our specific task of predict-
ing if an instance (a singleton or pair) pinst =
σ(w>hL[CLS]) is an appropriate one, i.e., belonging
to the ground-truth set of summary instances for a
given document. At test time, the architecture in-
discriminately encodes a mixed collection of sen-
tence singletons/pairs. We then obtain a likelihood
score for each instance. This framework is thus
a first effort to build semantic representations for
singletons and pairs capturing informativeness and
semantic compatibility of two sentences.

VSM We are interested in contrasting BERT
with the traditional vector space model (Manning
et al., 2008) for representing singletons and pairs.
BERT learns instance representations by attending
to important content words, where the importance
is signaled by word and position embeddings as
well as pairwise word relationships. Nonetheless,
it remains an open question whether BERT can
successfully weave the meaning of topically im-
portant words into representations. A word “bor-
der” is topically important if the input document
discusses border security. A topic word is likely to
be repeatedly mentioned in the input document but
less frequently elsewhere. Because sentences con-
taining topical words are often deemed summary-
worthy (Hong and Nenkova, 2014), it is desirable
to represent sentence singletons and pairs based on
the amount of topical content they convey.

VSM represents each sentence as a sparse vec-
tor. Each dimension of the vector corresponds to
an n-gram weighted by its TF-IDF score. A high
TF-IDF score suggests the n-gram is important to
the topic of discussion. We further strengthen the
sentence vector with position and centrality infor-
mation, i.e., the sentence position in the document
and the cosine similarity between the sentence and
document vector. We obtain a document vector by
averaging over its sentence vectors, and we simi-
larly obtain a vector for a pair of sentences. We use
VSM representations as a baseline to contrast its
performance with distributed representations from
BERT. To score singletons and pairs, we use the
LambdaMART model3 which has demonstrated
success on related NLP tasks (Chen et al., 2016a);

it also fits our requirements of ranking singletons
and pairs indiscriminately.

3.2 Generating Summaries
We proceed by performing a preliminary investi-
gation of summary generation from singletons and
pairs; they are collectively referred to as instances.
In the previous section, a set of summary instances
is selected from a document. These instances are
treated as “raw materials” for a summary; they
are fed to a neural abstractive summarizer which
processes them into summary sentences via fusion
and compression. This strategy allows us to sepa-
rately evaluate the contributions from instance se-
lection and summary composition.

We employ the MMR principle (Carbonell and
Goldstein, 1998) to select a set of highest scoring
and non-redundant instances. The method adds an
instance P̂ to the summary S iteratively per Eq. (5)
until a length threshold has been reached. Each
instance is weighted by a linear combination of
its importance score I(Pk), obtained by BERT or
VSM, and its redundancy scoreR(Pk), computed
as the cosine similarity between the instance and
partial summary. λ is a balancing factor between
importance and redundancy.4 Essentially, MMR
prevents the system from selecting instances that
are too similar to ones already selected.

P̂ = argmax
Pk∈D\S

(5)

Composing a summary from selected instances
is a non-trivial task. As a preliminary investigation
of summary composition, we make use of pointer-
generator (PG) networks (See et al., 2017) to com-
press/fuse sentences into summary sentences. PG
is a sequence-to-sequence model that has achieved
state-of-the-art performance in abstractive sum-
marization by having the ability to both copy to-
kens from the document or generate new tokens
from the vocabulary. When trained on document-
summary pairs, the model has been shown to re-
move unnecessary content from sentences and can
merge multiple sentences together.

In this work, rather than training on document-
summary pairs, we train PG exclusively on
ground-truth instances. This removes most of the
responsibility of content selection, and allows it to
focus its efforts on merging the sentences. We use
instances derived from human summaries (§4) to

gleton or pair along with the ground-truth com-
pressed/merged sentence. At test time, the net-
work receives an instance from BERT or VSM and
outputs a summary sentence, then repeats this pro-
cess to generate several sentences. In Figure 2 we
present an illustration of the system architecture.

4 Data

Our method does not require a massive amount of
annotated data. We thus report results on single-
and multi-document summarization datasets.

We experiment with (i) XSum (Narayan et al.,
2018), a new dataset created for extreme, abstrac-
tive summarization. The task is to reduce a news
article to a short, one-sentence summary. Both
source articles and reference summaries are gath-
ered from the BBC website. The training set con-
tains about 204k article-summary pairs and the test
contains 11k pairs. (ii) CNN/DM (Hermann et al.,
2015), an abstractive summarization dataset fre-
quently exploited by recent studies. The task is to
reduce a news article to a multi-sentence summary
(4 sentences on average). The training set contains
about 287k article-summary pairs and the test set
contains 11k pairs. We use the non-anonymzied
version of the dataset. (iii) DUC-04 (Over and
Yen, 2004), a benchmark multi-document summa-
rization dataset. The task is to create an abstractive
summary (5 sentences on average) from a set of 10
documents discussing a given topic. The dataset
contains 50 sets of documents used for testing pur-
pose only. Each document set is associated with
four human reference summaries.

We build a training set for both tasks of content
selection and summary generation. This is done



2180

by creating ground-truth sets of instances based
on document-summary pairs. Each document and
summary pair (D,S) is a collection of sentences
D = {d1, d2, ..., dM} and S = {s1, s2, ..., sN}.
We wish to associate each summary sentence sn
with a subset of the document sentences D̃ ⊆ D,
which are the sentences that are merged to form
sn. Our method chooses multiple sentences that
work together to capture the most overlap with
summary sentence sn, in the following way.

We use averaged ROUGE-1, -2, -L scores (Lin,
2004) to represent sentence similarity. The source
sentence most similar to sn is chosen, which we
call d̃1. All shared words are then removed from
sn to create s′n, effectively removing all informa-
tion already captured by d̃1. A second source sen-
tence d̃2 is selected that is most similar to the re-
maining summary sentence s′n, and shared words
are again removed from s′n to create s

′′
n. This

process of sentence selection and overlap removal
is repeated until no remaining sentences have at
least two overlapping content words (words that
are non-stopwords or punctuation) with sn. The
result is referred to as a ground-truth set (sn, D̃)
where D̃ = {d̃1, d̃2, ..., d̃|D̃|}. To train the mod-
els, D̃ is limited to one or two sentences because
it captures the large majority of cases. All empty
ground-truth sets are removed, and only the first
two sentences are chosen for all ground-truth sets
with more than two sentences. A small number of
summary sentences have empty ground-truth sets,
corresponding to 2.85%, 9.87%, 5.61% of sum-
mary sentences in CNN/DM, XSum, and DUC-04
datasets. A detailed plot of the ground-truth set
size is illustrated in Figure 1, and samples of the
ground-truth are found in the supplementary.

We use the standard train/validation/test splits
for both CNN/Daily Mail and XSum. We train our
models on ground-truth sets of instances created
from the training sets and tune hyperparameters
using instances from the validation sets. DUC-04
is a test-only dataset, so we use the models trained
on CNN/Daily Mail to evaluate DUC-04. Because
the input is in the form of multiple documents, we
select the first 20 sentences from each document
and concatenate them together into a single mega-
document (Lebanoff et al., 2018). For the sen-
tence position feature, we keep the sentence posi-
tions from the original documents. This handling
of sentence position, along with other features that
are invariant to the input type, allows us to effec-

tively train on single-document inputs and transfer
to the multi-document setting.

5 Results

Evaluation Setup In this section we evaluate
our proposed methods on identifying summary-
worthy instances including singletons and pairs.
We compare this scheme with traditional methods
extracting only singletons, then introduce novel
evaluation strategies to compare results. We ex-
ploit several strong extractive baselines: (i) Sum-
Basic (Vanderwende et al., 2007) extracts sen-
tences by assuming words occurring frequently
in a document have higher chances of being in-
cluded in the summary; (ii) KL-Sum (Haghighi
and Vanderwende, 2009) greedily adds sentences
to the summary to minimize KL divergence; (iii)
LexRank (Erkan and Radev, 2004) estimates sen-
tence importance based on eigenvector centrality
in a document graph representation. Further, we
include the LEAD method that selects the first N
sentences from each document. We then require
all systems to extract N instances, i.e., either sin-
gletons or pairs, from the input document(s).5

We compare system-identified instances with
ground-truth instances, and in particular, we com-
pare against the primary, secondary, and full set of
ground-truth sentences. A primary sentence is de-
fined as a ground-truth singleton or a sentence in
a ground-truth pair that has the highest similarity
to the reference summary sentence; the other sen-
tence in the pair is considered secondary, which
provides complementary information to the pri-
mary sentence. E.g., let S∗={(1, 2), 5, (8, 4), 10}
be a ground-truth set of instances, where numbers
are sentence indices and the first sentence of each
pair is primary. Our ground-truth primary set thus
contains {1, 5, 8, 10}; secondary set contains {2,
4}; and the full set of ground-truth sentences con-
tains {1, 2, 5, 8, 4, 10}. Assume S={(1, 2), 3, (4,
10), 15} are system-selected instances. We uncol-
lapse all pairs to obtain a set of single sentences
S={1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 15}, then compare them against
the primary, secondary, and full set of ground-truth
sentences to calculate precision, recall, and F1-
measure scores. This evaluation scheme allows
a fair comparison of a variety of systems for in-
stance selection, and assess their performance on

and DUC-04 datasets. N is selected as the average number of
sentences in reference summaries.

identifying primary and secondary sentences re-
spectively for summary generation.

Extraction Results In Table 2 we present in-
stance selection results for the CNN/DM, XSum,
and DUC-04 datasets. Our method builds rep-
resentations for instances using either BERT or
VSM (§3.1). To ensure a thorough comparison,
we experiment with selecting a mixed set of sin-
gletons and pairs (“SingPairMix”) as well as se-
lecting singletons only (“SingOnly”). On the
CNN/DM and XSum datasets, we observe that se-
lecting a mixed set of singletons and pairs based
on BERT representations (BERT+SingPairMix)
demonstrates the most competitive results. It out-
performs a number of strong baselines when eval-
uated on a full set of ground-truth sentences. The
method also performs superiorly on identifying
secondary sentences. For example, it increases
recall scores for identifying secondary sentences
from 33.8% to 69.8% (CNN/DM) and from 16.7%
to 65.3% (XSum). Our method is able to achieve
strong performance on instance selection owing to
BERT’s capability of building effective represen-
tations for both singletons and pairs. It learns to
identify salient source content based on token and

position embeddings and it encodes sentential se-
mantic compatibility using the pretraining task of
predicting the next sentence; both are valuable ad-
ditions to summary instance selection.

Further, we observe that identifying summary-
worthy singletons and pairs from multi-document
inputs (DUC-04) appears to be more challeng-
ing than that of single-document inputs (XSum
and CNN/DM). This distinction is not surprising
given that for multi-document inputs, the system
has a large and diverse search space where candi-
date singletons and pairs are gathered from a set
of documents written by different authors.6 We
find that the BERT model performs consistently on
identifying secondary sentences, and VSM yields
considerable performance gain on selecting pri-
mary sentences. Both BERT and VSM models
are trained on the CNN/DM dataset and applied to
DUC-04 as the latter data are only used for testing.
Our findings suggest that the TF-IDF features of
the VSM model are effective for multi-document

6For the DUC-04 dataset, we select top K sentences from
each document (K=5) and pool them as candidate singletons.
Candidate pairs consist of arbitrary combinations of single-
tons. For all datasets we perform downsampling to balance
the number of positive and negative singletons (or pairs).

peated across documents and TF-IDF scores can
reflect topical importance of words. This analysis
further reveals that extending BERT to incorporate
topical salience of words can be a valuable line of
research for future work.

Summarization Results We present summa-
rization results in Table 3, where we assess both
extractive and abstractive summaries generated by
BERT-SingPairMix. We omit VSM results as they
are not as competitive as BERT on instance selec-
tion for the mixed set of singletons and pairs. The
extractive summaries “BERT-Extr” are formed by
concatenating selected singletons and pairs for
each document, whereas “GT-SingPairMix” con-
catenates ground-truth singletons and pairs; it pro-
vides an upper bound for any system generating a
set of singletons and pairs as the summary. To as-
sure fair comparison, we limit all extractive sum-
maries to contain up to 100 words (40 words for

R-L, and R-SU4 are variants used to measure the
overlap of unigrams, bigrams, longest common
subsequences, and skip bigrams (with a maximum
distance of 4) between system and reference sum-
maries (Lin, 2004). The abstractive summaries are
generated from the same singletons and pairs used
to form system extracts. “BERT-Abs-PG” gener-
ates an abstract by iteratively encoding singletons
or pairs and decoding summary sentences using
pointer-generator networks (§3.2).8

Our BERT summarization systems achieve re-
sults largely on par with those of prior work. It
is interesting to observe that the extractive vari-
ant (BERT-Extr) can outperform its abstractive
counterparts on DUC-04 and CNN/DM datasets,
and vice versa on XSum. A close examina-
tion of the results reveals that whether abstrac-
tive summaries outperform appears to be related to
the amount of sentence pairs selected by “BERT-
SingPairMix.” Selecting more pairs than single-
tons seems to hurt the abstractor. For example,
BERT selects 100% and 76.90% sentence pairs for
DUC-04 and CNN/DM respectively, and 28.02%
for XSum. These results suggest that existing ab-
stractors using encoder-decoder models may need
to improve on sentence fusion. These models are
trained to generate fluent sentences more than pre-
serving salient source content, leading to impor-
tant content words being skipped in generating
summary sentences. Our work intends to separate
the tasks of sentence selection and summary gen-
eration, thus holding promise for improving com-
pression and merging in the future. We present

example system summaries in the supplementary.

Further analysis In this section we perform a
series of analyses to understand where summary-
worthy content is located in a document and how
humans order them into a summary. Figure 3
shows the position of ground-truth singletons and
pairs in a document. We observe that singletons of
CNN/DM and DUC-04 tend to occur at the begin-
ning of a document, whereas singletons of XSum
can occur anywhere. We also find that the first and
second sentence of a pair can appear far apart for
XSum, but are closer for CNN/DM. These find-
ings suggest that selecting singletons and pairs for
XSum can be more challenging than others, as in-
dicated by the name “extreme” summarization.

Figure 4 illustrates how humans choose to or-
ganize content into a summary. Interestingly, we
observe that a sentence’s position in a human sum-
mary affects whether or not it is created by com-
pression or fusion. The first sentence of a human-
written summary is more likely than the following
sentences to be a fusion of multiple source sen-
tences. This is the case across all three datasets.
We conjecture that the first sentence of a summary
is expected to give an overview of the document
and needs to consolidate information from differ-
ent parts. Other sentences of a human summary
can be generated by simply shortening singletons.
Our statistics reveal that DUC-04 and XSum sum-
maries involve more fusion operations, exhibiting
a higher level of abstraction than CNN/DM.

6 Conclusion

We present an investigation into the feasibility
of scoring singletons and pairs according to their
likelihoods of producing summary sentences. Our
framework is founded on the human process of se-
lecting one or two sentences to merge together and

it has the potential to bridge the gap between com-
pression and fusion studies. Our method provides
a promising avenue for domain-specific summa-
rization where content selection and summary
generation are only loosely connected to reduce
the costs of obtaining massive annotated data.

A Ground-truth Sets of Instances

We performed a manual inspection over a subset
of our ground-truth sets of singletons and pairs.
Each sentence from a human-written summary is
matched with one or two source sentences based
on average ROUGE similarity (details in Section
4 of the paper). Tables 4, 5, and 6 present ran-
domly selected examples from CNN/Daily Mail,
XSum, and DUC-04, respectively. Colored text
represents overlapping tokens between sentences.
Darker colors represent content from primary sen-
tences, while lighter colors represent content from
secondary sentences. Best viewed in color.

B Example Summaries

Table 7 presents example system summaries and
human-written abstracts from CNN/Daily Mail.
Each Human Abstract sentence is matched with
a sentence singleton or pair from the source doc-
ument; these singletons/pairs make up the GT-
SingPairMix summary. Similarly, each sentence
from BERT-Abs is created by compressing a sin-
gleton or merging a pair selected by BERT-Extr.

the average surface temperature has warmed one degree fahrenheit -lrb- 0.6 degrees
celsius -rrb- during the last century , according to the national research council .

earth has warmed one degree in past 100 years .

the reason most cited – by scientists and scientific organizations – for the current
warming trend is an increase in the concentrations of greenhouse gases , which are
in the atmosphere naturally and help keep the planet ’s temperature at a comfortable
level .
in the worst-case scenario , experts say oceans could rise to overwhelming and
catastrophic levels , flooding cities and altering seashores .

majority of scientists say greenhouse gases are
causing temperatures to rise .

a change in the earth ’s orbit or the intensity of the sun ’s radiation could change ,
triggering warming or cooling .
other scientists and observers , a minority compared to those who believe the warming
trend is something ominous , say it is simply the latest shift in the cyclical patterns of
a planet ’s life .

some critics say planets often in periods of warm-
ing or cooling .
