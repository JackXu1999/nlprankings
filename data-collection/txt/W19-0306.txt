Abstract 

This paper introduces a work in progress for implementing a free full text semantic tagger for 

Finnish, FiST. The tagger is based on a 46 226 lexeme semantic lexicon of Finnish that was 

published in 2016. The basis of the semantic lexicon was developed in the early 2000s in an EU 

funded project Benedict (Löfberg et al., 2005). Löfberg (2017) describes compilation of the 

lexicon and evaluates a proprietary version of the Finnish Semantic Tagger, the FST2. The FST 

and its lexicon were developed using the English Semantic Tagger (The EST) of University of 

Lancaster as a model. This semantic tagger was developed at the University Centre for Corpus 

Research on Language (UCREL) at Lancaster University as part of the UCREL Semantic 

Analysis System (USAS3) framework. The semantic lexicon of the USAS framework is based on 

the modified and enriched categories of the Longman Lexicon of Contemporary English 

(McArthur, 1981). 

We have implemented a basic working version of a new full text semantic tagger for Finnish 

based on freely available components. The implementation uses Omorfi and FinnPos for 

morphological analysis of Finnish words. After the morphological recognition phase words from 

the 46K semantic lexicon are matched against the morphologically unambiguous base forms. In 

our comprehensive tests the lexical tagging coverage of the current implementation is around 82–

90% with different text types. The present version needs still some enhancements, at least 

processing of semantic ambiguity of words and analysis of compounds, and perhaps also 

treatment of multiword expressions. Also a semantically marked ground truth evaluation 

collection should be established for evaluation of the tagger. 

 

Tiivistelmä 

 

Suomessa on harjoitettu kieliteknologiaa laaja-alaisesti 1980-luvun alusta, ja melkein 40 

vuotta jatkunut tutkimus ja kehitystyö on tuottanut useita merkittäviä ohjelmistoja suomen kielen 

analyysiin. Alkuvuosikymmenien käytöltään rajoitetuista ohjelmistoista on siirrytty 2000-luvulla 

paljolti joko avoimen lähdekoodin ohjelmiin tai ohjelmien vapaaseen saatavuuteen. Vapaasti 

saatavia suomen kielen keskeisiä kieliteknologisia ohjelmia on olemassa tällä hetkellä hyvin 

morfologiseen ja syntaktiseen analyysiin, esimerkiksi Omorfi, Voikko ja FinnPos morfologiaan 

ja Finnish depedency parser lauseenjäsennykseen. FiNER-ohjelmistolla voidaan tunnistaa ja 

merkitä erisnimiä. Toistaiseksi ei kuitenkaan ole olemassa ainoatakaan vapaasti saatavaa 

suomenkielisten kokotekstien kattavaa semanttista merkintää tekevää ohjelmaa, semanttista 

taggeria. Voikin todeta, että suomen kielen automaattiseen semanttiseen käsittelyyn on jäänyt jos 

ei aivan tyhjiö, niin kuitenkin suuri aukko. 

Tässä julkaisussa esitellään FiST, työn alla oleva suomen nykykielen kokotekstien 

semanttinen merkitsin. FiSTin ensimmäinen versio perustuu vapaasti saatavilla oleviin osiin: 

46 226 sanan semanttiseen leksikkoon sekä vapaisiin morfologisen analyysin ohjelmiin Omorfiin 

ja FinnPosin. Ohjelma merkitsee teksteihin sanojen semanttisia luokkia noin 82–90 %:n 

sanastollisella kattavuudella.

morphological and morpho-syntactic analysis of Finnish. The software has not been publicly available and 

can be considered partly outdated now. Its operational design is described in Löfberg et al. (2005).

1 Introduction 
 

Language technological resources for analysis of written modern standard Finnish can be 

considered reasonably good overall. However, a major aspect of automatic analysis of written 

Finnish is still poorly covered as there is no freely available full text semantic analyzer or tagger 

of Finnish. Lack of semantic resources for Finnish was already noted in the META NET white 

paper (Koskenniemi et al., 2012). The situation has not improved noticeably since the publication 

of the META NET report, although some semantic lexical resources have been published in 

recent years. 

Computational linguistics has been practiced in Finland since the early 1980s. During the last 

almost four decades several important analysis software for Finnish morphology and syntax have 

been produced. Without going too deeply in to historical details, early implementations include 

e.g. the first full computational morphological model for Finnish, TWOL (Koskenniemi, 1983), 

and a general syntactic parsing formalism Constraint Grammar (CG, Karlsson, 1990). In the 21st 

century most of the major new linguistic analysis tools have become either open source or at least 

freely available or usable. Such programs are, e.g., free morphological analyzers Omorfi4 

(Pirinen, 2015), Voikko5 and FinnPos6 (Silfverberg et al., 2016). A free dependency parser for 

Finnish is provided by the BioNLP group at the University of Turku (Turku Neural Parser 

Pipeline7). The Language Bank of Finland8 provides also access to these and other tools, such as 

a Finnish named entity tagger FiNER.  

As good as these tools may be in their tasks, they serve only a quite limited function. 

Morphological and syntactic analyses are rarely goals in themselves in real life text analysis 

outside linguistics; morphological and syntactic analyses serve only as mid-level results for 

further processing of textual content. In information oriented parlance, these tools do not reveal 

anything about the content of the texts or their aboutness. Most of the time contents of the texts 

are interesting for research outside linguistics, not the linguistic form. Proper content analysis 

tools for Finnish are scarce. Out of the existing tools only FiNER has limited semantic 

capabilities, as it marks names and name like entities.  

A few semantically oriented lexicons have also been compiled and published for Finnish, 

namely FinnWordnet (Lindén and Carlson, 2010; Lindén and Niemi, 2016) and FrameNet 

(Lindén et al., 2017). Some type of semantic analyzers for Finnish could be produced using 

FinnWordnet, but so far usage of FinnWordnet for semantic level analyses seems to have been 

non-existent. WordNets are also not comprehensive semantic lexicons for full text analysis: they 

contain only words belonging to four main word classes, nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. 

Their contents seem also a bit problematic. FrameNet, on the other hand, is an even more 

restricted description of a set of situations, entities and relationships of the participants (lexemes) 

in a lexical frame. A third available lexical tool, YSO9, General Finnish Ontology, serves mainly 

indexing of Finnish cultural content (Hyvönen et al., 2008). Ontologies are useful for many 

purposes, but they are mainly non-linguistic descriptions (Hirst, 2004) and do not even aim to 

cover all word classes of natural language. Thus they do not suit for full text analysis. A proper 

semantically oriented full text analyzer of Finnish would improve possibilities of textual content 

analysis vastly.10

10 A few other approaches can also be mentioned here. Besides YSO several smaller subject matter 

ontologies exist, e.g. AFO (agriculture and forestry), JUHO (Government) etc. 

(https://seco.cs.aalto.fi/ontologies/). Haverinen (2014) introduces semantic role labeling for Finnish. This is 

related to argument structure of verbs in syntactic parsing of sentences and is of limited semantic value. 
BabelNet (https://babelnet.org/, Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012) is a large multilingual encyclopedic database, 
which includes also Finnish. Its descriptions for words have been collected from multilingual Wikipedia 

articles using WordNet.

This paper introduces a work in progress for implementing a free full text semantic tagger for 

Finnish, FiST. The tagger is based on freely available morphological processors and a 46 226 

lexeme semantic lexicon of Finnish that was published in 2016. We shall first discuss semantic 

tagging in general and design of FiST. After that we evaluate lexical coverage of the tagger with 

different types of available digital Finnish corpora. Finally, we discuss improvements needed for 

the tagger and conclude the paper. 

 

2 Semantic Tagging 
 

Semantic tagging is defined here as a process of identifying and labelling the meaning of words 

in a given text according to some semantic scheme. This process is also called semantic 

annotation, and in our case it uses a semantic lexicon to add labels or tags to the words. (Leech, 

2003; Löfberg, 2017; Wilson and Thomas, 1997).  

Semantic tagging discussed here is based on the idea of semantic (lexical) fields. Wilson and 

Thomas (1997, p. 54) define a semantic field as "a theoretical construct which groups together 

words that are related by virtue of their being connected – at some level of generality – with the 

same mental concept". In other words “a semantic field is a group of words which are united 

according to a common basic semantic component” (Dullieva, 2017, formulating Trier’s insight 

of semantic fields; cf. also Lutzeier, 2006; Geeraerts, 2010). Semantic lexicon of USAS is divided 

in to 232 meaning classes or categories which belong to 21 upper level fields. Figure 1 shows one 

upper level semantic field, Money & Commerce, and its meaning classes (USAS Semantic Tag 

Set for Finnish). Alphanumeric abbreviations in front of the meaning classes are the actual 

hierarchical semantic tags used in the lexicon. According to Piao et al. (2005), the depth of the 

semantic hierarchical structure is limited to a maximum of three layers, since this has been found 

to be the most feasible approach.

Figure 2. Top level domains of the USAS tag set  

 

This top level domain and its subdivisions were developed from the categories used in the 

Longman Lexicon of Contemporary English (LLOCE, McArthur, 1981). LLOCE uses 14 top 

level domains. Some of those were divided into more fine-grained classes in the USAS. Also one 

more class, Names and Grammatical words, was added (Archer et al., 2004). 

 

3 The Finnish Semantic Lexicon 
 

The core of this kind of approach to semantic tagging is naturally the semantically marked 

lexicon. Semantic lexicons using the USAS schema have so far been published in 12 languages 

(Multilingual USAS; Piao, 201612). Out of these lexicons the Finnish lexicon is the most 

comprehensive and mature. It has been compiled manually, as many of the lexicons for other 

languages are compiled partly or wholly automatically based on the USAS English lexicon and 

bilingual dictionaries. In different evaluations the Finnish lexicon has been shown to be capable 

of dealing with most general domains which appear in modern standard Finnish texts (Löfberg, 

2017; Piao et al., 2016). Furthermore, although the semantic lexical resources were originally 

developed for the analysis of general modern standard Finnish, evaluation results have shown 

that the lexical resources are also applicable to analysis of both older Finnish texts and the more 

informal type of writing found on the Web. The semantic lexical resources can also be tailored 

for various domain-specific tasks thanks to the flexible USAS category system. Lexemes can be 

added to the lexicon easily, as it is open and its description is fairly straightforward.  

The Finnish semantic lexicon consists of 46 226 lexemes. Out of these about 58% are nouns, 

7% verbs, 17% proper names, 7% adjectives and 7% adverbs (Löfberg, 2017).13 Rest of the words 

belong to small fixed classes. Löfberg (2017: Table 7, 139) lists the distribution of lexical entries 

                                                           
12 The list of the 11 other languages is: Arabic, Chinese, Czech, Dutch, Italian, Malay, Portuguese, Russian, 
Spanish, Urdu and Welsh. Sizes of the lexicons vary between 1 800 and 64 800 single word entries. Finnish 

lexicon is thus the third largest of all available after lexicons of Malay and Chinese (Piao et al., 2016). Eight 

of the languages have an existing semantic tagger. Those that do not have are Arabic, Malay, Urdu and 

Welsh. 
13 Distributions for POS categories are given in Löfberg (2017, Table 4, 135). The size of the lexicon in the 

thesis is slightly smaller than the size of the published lexicon. 



70

in the top level semantic categories in the single word lexicon of the FST. The table is too large 

to be shown here, so we list only the five categories that have most lexemes. The largest category 

is Z (Names and Grammatical Words), with 9 755 lexical entries (21.31%). Second largest 

category is A (General & Abstract Terms) with 4 544 entries (9.93%). The third largest category 

is B (The Body & The Individual) with 3 734 entries (8.16%). A (Social Actions, States & 

Processes) and L (Life & Living Things) are the next ones with 3 401 (7.43) and 2 798 (6.11%) 

entries, respectively. These five categories constitute about 52 per cent of the entries in the 

lexicon. 

 

4 Design of FiST 
 

Our current implementation of FiST is simple and straightforward. It uses existing free 

morphological tools, Omorfi and FinnPos, for morphological analysis and disambiguation of 

input texts. After the morphological phase words of the input text are unambiguous and in base 

form, and the tagger tries to match the words to lexical entries in its semantic lexicon. If a word 

is found in the lexicon, it is tagged and returned with word class and the semantic label(s) found. 

If the word is not in the semantic lexicon, it is marked as Z99, unknown, and returned with this 

tag and the morphological analysis for the word, if such is available. Figure 3. shows the working 

process of FiST.

5 Evaluation 
 

As there is no semantically marked evaluation collection available, we have not been able to 

evaluate FiST’s semantic accuracy so far. However, we have performed quite thorough testing 

of the current implementation’s lexical coverage. Our evaluation data consists of 17 texts that 

range from about 42 000 words to ca. 28.6 million words, the largest corpus being the Finnish 

part of the Europarl corpus v614. We show also morphological recognition rates for all except one 

of the texts with Omorfi. This gives an idea of the coverage of the semantic lexicon in comparison 

to the lexicon of a morphological analyzer, which is usually much larger. Omorfi’s lexicon is 

almost ten times larger than the semantic lexicon – it consists of 424 259 words (Pirinen, 2015). 
Our formula for coverage of FiST is the following: (100* (1-(missed tag/(NR-comma-number)))). 

Here missed tags are those words that are tagged as Z99, unknown. Punctuation marks and 

numbers are subtracted from the number of records/words (NR). Input for the evaluation is one 

tagged word/line, with no empty lines. 

Figures 4 and 5 show tagging results of our current tagger version with 17 texts. Figure 4 

shows results of modern texts, and Figure 5 results of older texts.

and text #7 is sample sentences of FinnTreebank17 (examples from a Finnish grammar, 138 949 

tokens).

In Figure 5 text number 1 is Bible translation of 193818 (544 474 tokens), #2 is 

newspaper/journal Turun Wiikkosanomat 1831 (60 390 tokens), #3 newspaper/journal 

Mehiläinen 1859 (154 370 tokens), #4 newspaper/journal Oulun Viikko-Sanomia 1841 (68 491 

tokens), and #5 is newspaper/journal Sanansaattaja Wiipurista 1841 (49 802 tokens). All the 

journalistic texts are from digital collection of the Institute for the Languages of Finland 19. Texts 

#6–#1020 are literary works of Finnish authors Juhani Aho, Minna Canth, Arvid Järnefelt, Teuvo 

Pakkala, and Kyösti Wilkuna from late 19th and early 20th century with 42 000–334 000 tokens. 

They are also from the collection of the Institute for the Languages of Finland. These collections 

are manually edited. 

Results of the analyses show that FiST is capable of annotating texts of modern standard 

Finnish quite well already now. With many of the texts about 90% of the words get a semantic 

label in FiST’s analysis. This applies also to literary texts of Pentti Saarikoski, both prose and 

poetry. Proceedings of the European Parliament v6 (Koehn, 2005), our largest data collection, 

gets also a high coverage: 90.9%. Suomi24 data and data from the Leipzig corpus obtain clearly 

lower coverage. This is mainly due to the nature of the texts. Suomi24 contains informal 

discussions that may include lots of misspelled words, slang and foreign words. Texts of the 

Leipzig corpus have been crawled from the Web automatically and may thus contain more noise, 

i.e. misspellings, control characters, HTML code etc. (Quasthoff et al., 2006).  

Older literary texts and the Bible translation of 1938, however, obtain a quite good coverage, 

round 90%, as can be seen in Figure 5. Our oldest texts are from 1831–1859, four newspapers: 

Turun Wiikko-Sanomia (1831), Oulun Viikko-Sanomia (1841), Sanansaattaja Wiipurista (1841) 

and Mehiläinen (1859). These versions are manually edited clean versions from the Institute for 

the Languages of Finland. Considering the age of the data, these get also quite good coverage 

with FiST, 68.6, 73, 79.22 and 84 per cent.

73

We performed also a few small scale test runs with our text data using one available lexicon 

to get more insight into lexical coverage. The so called Kotus wordlist21 which contains ca. 94 000 

lexemes from a dictionary of modern Finnish, has a good coverage: it was only a few per cent 

units below coverage of the semantic lexicon. When we tested coverage by combining the 

semantic lexicon and words of the Kotus wordlist not included in the semantic lexicon, we noticed 

an increase of few per cent units in matching of our evaluation data. Our tests were performed 

with three small texts, and the tests are thus not as comprehensive as our tests with FiST’s main 

version, but clearly indicative.  

Lindén and Niemi (2016) have evaluated FinnWordnet’s lexical coverage with samples. In a 

large newspaper corpus (of unspecified size) coverage was 57.3%. If only nouns, verbs, 

adjectives and adverbs were counted and proper names excluded, the coverage was 82.4%. Thus 

FinnWordnet’s lexicon is probably not sufficient for good lexical coverage of Finnish texts as an 

only lexical resource. On the other hand, lexical coverage of the semantic lexicon of FiST could 

be increased with a few per cent units by adding lexemes to it from other available lexicons. This, 

of course, would also mean laborious semantic marking of the additions.  

6 Discussion 

The current implementation of FiST is a simplified basic version of a semantic tagger. It lacks at 

least two main components: word sense disambiguation (WSD) and proper handling of 

compounds. The semantic lexicon of Finnish marks ambiguous meanings of words by giving 

several meaning tags. Word huone (‘room’), for example, is given an entry huone Noun H2 S9. 

Parts of buildings belong to class H2, and S9 is for words that have a religious or supernatural 

meaning. The primary meaning of huone is H2, but in some contexts, especially in astrology, it 

could be S9. Thus semantic disambiguation would be needed to be able to distinguish meanings 

of ambiguous words. Word sense disambiguation has gained lots of interest in computational 

linguistics during the past 20 years, and thus ways to disambiguate ambiguous words should be 

found with a reasonable effort (Edmonds, 2006). Rayson et al. (2004), e.g., describe several 

methods they use for WSD in the English Semantic Tagger. A few most simple ones of these 

should be easy to implement.  

If the word is ambiguous, i.e. it has more than one sense, the different senses are listed in the 

lexicon arranged in perceived frequency order (Löfberg, 2017: 74). The earlier example from 

analysis of the poem of Pentti Saarikoski shows this: paperi Noun O1.1 Q1.2 B4 P1/Q1.2. In the 

analysis we can also see an example of so called "slash tag" (or "portmanteau tag") of the USAS 

framework. The slash shows that the word belongs to more than one category. Paperi belongs to 

solid matter, but also to category of education (P1) and literary documents and writing, Q1.2. A 

counting in the lexicon shows that 7 791 lexemes have been described as ambiguous and 10 556 

have the slash tag. Out of the ambiguous lexemes 5 476 have two meanings, and 1 449 three 

meanings. There are almost 500 words with four meanings and almost 200 with five, but after six 

meanings number of lexemes having more meanings drops to tens. The more meanings the 

lexeme has been given, the more abstract it tends to be. Abstract nouns like meneminen (‘going’) 

and tuleminen (‘coming’) have 10 meanings in the lexicon. 85% of the slash category words have 

only one slash tag. 

Another deficiency in the FiST’s implementation is handling of compounds. Finnish is 

notoriously rich in compounds, and no lexicon can contain all of them. The Finnish semantic 

lexicon includes the most common compounds as such, but for those that are not included, the 

meaning should be composed out of the meanings of component parts. Kivitalo (‘house made of 

stone/concrete’), for example, is not in the lexicon, but its parts are. Kivi is Noun O1.1 B5, and 

talo Noun H1 S5+ I3.1/M. In practice the semantic marking should be kivitalo H1/O1.1, as the 
most meaningful part of the compound is usually the last part. For this to succeed, much depends 

on the morphological analyzer, as it analyzes and splits the compounds for the semantic tagger.

http://kaino.kotus.fi/sanat/nykysuomi/


74

It would be desirable, that the morphological analyzer returned compounds both as wholes and 

split, as it would make search of available compounds in the semantic lexicon easier.22 

A third possible improvement for the FiST would be handling of multiword expressions 

(MWEs) that consist of two or more separate orthographic words. Englannin kanaali, Euroopan 

Unioni and musta pörssi are some examples of MWEs. The original FST (and the EST) has a 

separate lexicon of over 6000 entries for multi word expressions (Löfberg, 2017).This lexicon 

has not been published. A list of MWEs could be compiled with a reasonable effort, but semantic 

description of thousands of words would take time, especially as a substantial part of the MWEs 

are non-compositional idiomatic expressions (Piao et al., 2016). The Finnish Wordnet, for 

example, contains about 13 000 multiword nouns, but considering that the lexicon was produced 

as a direct translation of the English Wordnet, many of the MWES do not seem very frequent or 

crucial to Finnish.  

7 Conclusion 

We have described in this paper FiST, a first version of a full text semantic tagger for Finnish. 

We have provided background for the tagger’s lexical semantic approach and evaluated its 

capabilities mainly as a semantic tagger of modern standard Finnish. The first results can be 

considered promising: the tagger works robustly even with large data of millions of words and 

achieves a good lexical coverage with many types of texts. Our evaluation of FiST confirms also 

that the Finnish semantic lexicon of USAS is of high quality and it covers also data from time 

periods that are supposedly out of its main scope. 

Semantic tagging can be used in many natural language processing applications, such as 

terminology extraction, machine translation, bilingual and multilingual extraction of multi-word 

expressions, monolingual and cross-lingual information extraction, as well as in automatic 

generation, interpretation, and classification of language. Semantic tagging with the English 

Semantic Tagger of UCREL has been successfully utilized for content analysis, analysis of online 

language, training chatbots, ontology learning, corpus stylistics, discourse analysis, phraseology, 

analysis of interview transcripts, and key domain analysis (Löfberg, 2017; 

http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/usas/; http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/wmatrix/#apps). These kinds of 

applications could also be targets for FiST. 

In the future we wish to improve the tagger’s performance with the still missing features. If 

possible, we evaluate the tagger’s semantic accuracy with semantically marked data. We also 

believe that even the current plain implementation is suitable for many textual analysis purposes, 

e.g. content wise topic analysis (vs. statistical, where words are only strings without meaning), 

lexical content surveying, semantically oriented lexical statistics etc. We have also performed 

some trials to use data tagged with FiST as training data for a machine learning algorithm to learn 

a semantic tagger for Finnish. So far our trials have not been very successful due to the rich 

feature set of semantic marking. Most of the standard machine learning environments we have 

tried run out of memory with the number of features of semantically tagged data. Probably at 

least some smaller scale niche semantic field analyzer could be developed with marked data 

provided by FiST.

22 We have been using FinnPos from the Mylly resources (https://www.kielipankki.fi/support/mylly/) of the 
Language Bank of Finland. Currently FinnPos does not split compounds to their parts, although it analyzes 

the base forms of the wholes. Omorfi splits compounds, as does Voikko, too. Voikko’s splitting, however, 

does not seem very useful, as it separates also sub-word parts, e.g. derivational endings, in the output. Omorfi 

and Voikko do not disambiguate the different morphological interpretations, which makes usage of either 

of them as sole morphological component complicated.
