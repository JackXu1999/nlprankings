Abstract

Large-scale datasets for natural language in-
ference are created by presenting crowd work-
ers with a sentence (premise), and asking them
to generate three new sentences (hypotheses)
that it entails, contradicts, or is logically neu-
tral with respect to. We show that, in a signif-
icant portion of such data, this protocol leaves
clues that make it possible to identify the label
by looking only at the hypothesis, without ob-
serving the premise. Specifically, we show that
a simple text categorization model can cor-
rectly classify the hypothesis alone in about
67% of SNLI (Bowman et al., 2015) and 53%
of MultiNLI (Williams et al., 2018). Our anal-
ysis reveals that specific linguistic phenom-
ena such as negation and vagueness are highly
correlated with certain inference classes. Our
findings suggest that the success of natural lan-
guage inference models to date has been over-
estimated, and that the task remains a hard
open problem.

1 Introduction

Natural language inference (NLI; also known
as recognizing textual entailment, or RTE) is a
widely-studied task in natural language process-
ing, to which many complex semantic tasks, such
as question answering and text summarization, can
be reduced (Dagan et al., 2006). Given a pair of
sentences, a premise p and a hypothesis h, the goal
is to determine whether or not p semantically en-
tails h.

The problem of acquiring large amounts of la-
beled inference data was addressed by Bowman
et al. (2015), who devised a method for crowd-
sourcing high-agreement entailment annotations
en masse, creating the SNLI and later the genre-
diverse MultiNLI (Williams et al., 2018) datasets.
In this process, crowd workers are presented with

a premise p drawn from some corpus (e.g., image
captions), and are required to generate three new
sentences (hypotheses) based on p, according to
one of the following criteria:

Entailment h is definitely true given p
Neutral h might be true given p
Contradiction h is definitely not true given p

In this paper, we observe that hypotheses gener-
ated by this crowdsourcing process contain arti-
facts that can help a classifier detect the correct
class without ever observing the premise (Sec-
tion 2).

A closer look suggests that the observed arti-
facts are a product of specific annotation strategies
and heuristics that crowd workers adopt. We find,
for example, that entailed hypotheses tend to con-
tain gender-neutral references to people, purpose
clauses are a sign of neutral hypotheses, and nega-
tion is correlated with contradiction (Section 3).
Table 1 shows a single set of instances from SNLI
that demonstrates all three phenomena.

We re-evaluate high-performing NLI models on
the subset of examples on which our hypothesis-
only classifier failed, which we consider to be
“hard” (Section 4). Our results show that the per-
formance of these models on the “hard” subset is
dramatically lower than their performance on the
rest of the instances. This suggests that, despite
recently reported progress, natural language infer-
ence remains an open problem.

2 Annotation Artifacts are Common

We conjecture that the framing of the annotation
task has a significant effect on the language gener-
ation choices that crowd workers make when au-
thoring hypotheses, producing certain patterns in
the data. We call these patterns annotation arti-
facts.

Premise A woman selling bamboo sticks talking to two men on a loading dock.

Entailment There are at least three people on a loading dock.
Neutral A woman is selling bamboo sticks to help provide for her family.
Contradiction A woman is not taking money for any of her sticks.

Table 1: An instance from SNLI that illustrates the artifacts that arise from the annotation protocol. A
common strategy for generating entailed hypotheses is to remove gender or number information. Neutral
hypotheses are often constructed by adding a purpose clause. Negations are often introduced to generate
contradictions.

classifier on NLI. The MultiNLI benchmark con-
tains two test sets: matched (in-domain exam-
ples) and mismatched (out-of-domain examples).
A majority baseline is presented for reference.

To determine the degree to which such arti-
facts exist, we train a model to predict the label
of a given hypothesis without seeing the premise.
Specifically, we use fastText (Joulin et al.,
2017), an off-the-shelf text classifier that models
text as a bag of words and bigrams, to predict the
entailment label of the hypothesis.1 This classifier
is completely oblivious to the premise.

Table 2 shows that a significant portion of each
test set can be correctly classified without look-
ing at the premise, well beyond the most-frequent-
class baseline.2

Our finding demonstrates that it is possible to
perform well on these datasets without modeling
natural language inference.

3 Characteristics of Annotation Artifacts

In the previous section we showed that more than
half (MultiNLI) or even two thirds (SNLI) of the
data can be classified correctly using annotation
artifacts. A possible explanation for the formation
and relative consistency of these artifacts is that

1For MultiNLI, we additionally enabled two hyperparam-
eters: character 4-grams, and filtering words that appeared
less than 10 times in the training data.

2Experiments with two other text classifiers, a logistic re-
gression classifier with word and character n-gram features
and a premise-oblivious version of the decomposable atten-
tion model (Parikh et al., 2016), yielded similar results.

crowd workers adopt heuristics in order to gener-
ate hypotheses quickly and efficiently. We identify
some of these heuristics by conducting a shallow
statistical analysis of the data, focusing on lexi-
cal choice (Section 3.1) and sentence length (Sec-
tion 3.2).

3.1 Lexical Choice
To see whether the use of certain words is indica-
tive of the inference class, we compute the point-
wise mutual information (PMI) between each
word and class in the training set:

PMI(word, class) = log
p(word, class)

p(word, ·)p(·, class)

We apply add-100 smoothing to the raw statistics;
the aggressive smoothing emphasizes word-class
correlations that are highly discriminative. Table 4
shows the top words affiliated with each class by
PMI, along with the proportion of training sen-
tences in each class containing each word.

Below, we elaborate on the most discriminat-
ing words for each NLI class, and suggest possible
annotation heuristics that gave rise to these par-
ticular artifacts. However, it is important to note
that even the most discriminative words are not
very frequent, indicating that the annotation arti-
facts are diverse, and that crowd workers tend to
adopt multiple heuristics for generating new text.

Entailment. Entailed hypotheses have generic
words such as animal, instrument, and outdoors,
which were probably chosen to generalize over
more specific premise words such as dog, guitar,
and beach. Other heuristics seem to replace ex-
act numbers with approximates (some, at least,
various), and to remove explicit gender (human
and person appear lower down the list). Some
artifacts are specific to the domain, such as out-
doors and outside, which are typical of the per-
sonal photo descriptions on which SNLI was built.

Premise Two dogs are running through a field.

Entailment There are animals outdoors.
Neutral Some puppies are running to catch a stick.
Contradiction The pets are sitting on a couch.

Table 3: The example provided in the annotation guidelines for SNLI. Some of the observed artifacts
(bold) can be potentially traced back to phenomena in this specific example.

least 0.2% first 0.6% sleeping 3.2%
instrument 0.5% competition 0.7% no 1.2%

various 0.1% most 1.8% none 0.1%

Table 4: Top 5 words by PMI(word, class), along
with the proportion of class training samples con-
taining word. MultiNLI is abbreviated to MNLI.

Interestingly, the example from the SNLI anno-
tation guidelines (Table 3) contains both animals
and outdoors, and also removes the number. This
example likely primed the annotators, inducing the
specific heuristics of replacing dog with animal
and mentions of scenery with outdoors.

Neutral. Modifiers (tall, sad, popular) and su-
perlatives (first, favorite, most) are affiliated with
the neutral class. These modifiers are perhaps a
product of a simple strategy for introducing in-
formation that is not obviously entailed by the
premise, yet plausible. Another formulation of
neutral hypotheses seems to be through cause and
purpose clauses, which increase the prevalence of
discourse markers such as because. Once again,
we observe that the example from the SNLI an-
notation guidelines does just that, by adding the
purpose clause to catch a stick (Table 3).

Contradiction. Negation words such as nobody,
no, never and nothing are strong indicators of con-
tradiction.3 Other (non-negative) words appear to
be part of heuristics for contradicting whatever in-
formation is displayed in the premise; sleeping
contradicts any activity, and naked (further down
the list) contradicts any description of clothing.

3Similar findings were observed in the ROC story cloze
annotation (Schwartz et al., 2017).

pothesis length in SNLI, by class.

The high frequency of cat probably stems from the
many dog images in the original dataset.

3.2 Sentence Length

We observe that the number of tokens in generated
hypotheses is not distributed equally among the
different inference classes. Figure 1 shows that,
in SNLI, neutral hypotheses tend to be long, while
entailed ones are generally shorter. The median
length of a neutral hypothesis is 9, whereas 60% of
entailments have 7 tokens or less. We also observe
that half of hypotheses with at least 12 tokens are
neutral, while a similar portion of hypotheses of
length 5 and under are entailments, making hy-
pothesis length an effective feature. Length is also
a discriminatory feature in MultiNLI, but is less
significant, possibly due to the introduction of di-
verse genres.

The bias in sentence length may suggest that
crowd workers created many entailed hypotheses
by simply removing words from the premise. In-
deed, when representing each sentence as a bag of
words, 8.8% of entailed hypotheses in SNLI are
fully contained within their premise, while only
0.2% of neutrals and contradictions exhibit the
same property. MultiNLI showed similar trends.

Table 5: Performance of high-performing NLI models on the full, Hard, and Easy NLI test sets.

4 Re-evaluating NLI Models

In Section 2, we showed that a model with no ac-
cess to the premise can correctly classify many ex-
amples in both SNLI and MultiNLI, performing
well above the most-frequent-class baseline. This
raises an important question about state-of-the-art
NLI models: to what extent are they “gaming” the
task by learning to detect annotation artifacts?

To answer this question, we partition each
NLI test set into two subsets: examples that the
premise-oblivious model classified accurately are
labeled Easy, and those it could not are Hard.

We then train an NLI model on the original
training sets (from either SNLI or MultiNLI),4 and
evaluate on the full test set, the Hard test set,
and the Easy test set. We ran this experiment
on three high-performing NLI models: the De-
composable Attention Model (DAM; Parikh et al.,
2016),5 the Enhanced Sequential Inference Model
(ESIM; Chen et al., 2017),6 and the Densely In-
teractive Inference Network (DIIN; Gong et al.,
2018).7 All models were retrained out of the box.

Table 5 shows the performance of each model
on the different splits. While the models correctly
classify some Hard examples, the bulk of their
success is attributed to the Easy examples. This
result implies that the ability of NLI models to rec-
ognize textual entailment is lower than previously
perceived, and that such models rely heavily on
annotation artifacts in the hypothesis to make their
predictions.

A natural question to ask is whether it is pos-
sible to select a set of NLI training and test sam-
ples which do not contain easy-to-exploit artifacts.
One solution might be to filter Easy examples from
the training set, retaining only Hard examples.
However, initial experiments suggest that it might

alone (as opposed to a blend of MultiNLI and SNLI data).

not be as straightforward to eliminate annotation
artifacts once the dataset has been collected.

First, after removing the Easy examples, Hard
examples might not necessarily be artifact-free.
For instance, removing all contradicting samples
containing the word “no” (a strong indicator for
contradiction, see Section 3), leaves the Hard
dataset with this word mostly appearing in the neu-
tral and entailing classes, thus creating a new ar-
tifact. Secondly, Easy examples contain impor-
tant inference phenomena (e.g. the word “animal”
is indeed a hypernym of “dog”), and removing
these examples may hinder the model from learn-
ing such phenomena. Importantly, artifacts do not
render any particular example incorrect; they are
a problem with the sample distribution, which is
skewed toward certain kinds of entailment, con-
tradiction, and neutral hypotheses. Therefore, a
better solution might not eliminate the artifacts
altogether, but rather balance them across labels.
Future strategies for reducing annotation artifacts
might involve experimenting with the prompts or
training given to crowd workers, e.g., to encourage
a wide range of strategies, or incorporating base-
line or adversarial systems that flag examples that
appear to use over-represented heuristics. We de-
fer research on hard-to-exploit NLI datasets to fu-
ture work.

5 Discussion

We reflect on our results and relate them to other
work that also analyzes annotation artifacts in
NLP datasets, drawing three main conclusions.

Many datasets contain annotation artifacts.
Lai and Hockenmaier (2014) demonstrated that
lexical features such as the presence of nega-
tion, word overlap, and hypernym relations are
highly predictive of entailment classes in the SICK
dataset (Marelli et al., 2014). Chen et al. (2016) re-
vealed problems with the CNN/DailyMail dataset
(Hermann et al., 2015) which resulted from apply-

110



ing automatic tools for annotation. Levy and Da-
gan (2016) showed that a relation inference bench-
mark (Zeichner et al., 2012) is severely biased
towards distributional methods, since it was cre-
ated using DIRT (Lin and Pantel, 2001). Schwartz
et al. (2017) and Cai et al. (2017) showed that
certain biases are prevalent in the ROC stories
cloze task (Mostafazadeh et al., 2016), which al-
low models trained on the endings alone, and not
the story prefix, to yield state-of-the-art results.
Rudinger et al. (2017) revealed that elicited hy-
potheses in SNLI contain evidence of various gen-
der, racial, religious, and aged-based stereotypes.
In parallel to this work, Poliak et al. (2018) un-
covered similar annotation biases across multiple
NLI datasets. Indeed, annotation artifacts are not
unique to the NLI datasets, and the danger of such
biases should be carefully considered when anno-
tating new datasets.

Supervised models leverage annotation arti-
facts. Levy et al. (2015) demonstrated that su-
pervised lexical inference models rely heavily on
artifacts in the datasets, particularly the tendency
of some words to serve as prototypical hypernyms.
Agrawal et al. (2016); Jabri et al. (2016); Goyal
et al. (2017) all showed that state-of-the-art visual
question answering (Antol et al., 2015) systems
leverage annotation biases in the dataset. Cirik
et al. (2018) find that complex models for referring
expression recognition achieve high performance
without any text input. In parallel to this work,
Dasgupta et al. (2018) found that the InferSent
model (Conneau et al., 2017) relies on word-level
heuristics to achieve state-of-the-art performance
on SNLI. These findings coincide with ours, and
strongly suggest that supervised models will ex-
ploit shortcuts in the data for gaming the bench-
mark, if such exist.

Annotation artifacts inflate model perfor-
mance. This is a corollary of the above, since
large portions of the test set can be solved by rely-
ing on annotation artifacts alone. A similar finding
by Jia and Liang (2017) showed that the perfor-
mance of top question-answering models trained
on SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) drops drasti-
cally by introducing simple adversarial sentences
in the evidence. We release the Hard SNLI and
MultiNLI test sets,8 and encourage the community

8SNLI: goo.gl/5rQKb5, MultiNLI matched: goo.
gl/abdSbi, MultiNLI mismatched: goo.gl/Cu9Gp6

to use them for evaluating NLI models (in addition
to the original benchmarks). We also encourage
the development of additional challenging bench-
marks that expose the true performance levels of
state-of-the-art NLI models.
