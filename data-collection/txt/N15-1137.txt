Abstract 

This paper reports on our research to generate 

multilingual semantic lexical resources and 

develop multilingual semantic annotation 

software, which assigns each word in running 

text to a semantic category based on a lexical 

semantic classification scheme. Such tools 

have an important role in developing intelli-

gent multilingual NLP, text mining and ICT 

systems. In this work, we aim to extend an ex-

isting English semantic annotation tool to 

cover a range of languages, namely Italian, 

Chinese and Brazilian Portuguese, by boot-

strapping new semantic lexical resources via 

automatically translating existing English se-

mantic lexicons into these languages. We used 

a set of bilingual dictionaries and word lists 

for this purpose. In our experiment, with mi-

nor manual improvement of the automatically 

generated semantic lexicons, the prototype 

tools based on the new lexicons achieved an 

average lexical coverage of 79.86% and an 

average annotation precision of 71.42% (if 

only precise annotations are considered) or 

84.64% (if partially correct annotations are in-

cluded) on the three languages. Our experi-

ment demonstrates that it is feasible to rapidly 

develop prototype semantic annotation tools 

for new languages by automatically boot-

strapping new semantic lexicons based on ex-

isting ones. 

 

 

 

1 Introduction 

In this paper, we report on an experiment to devel-

op prototype semantic annotation tools for Italian, 

Chinese and Brazilian Portuguese based on an ex-

isting English annotation tool. Over the last twenty 

years, semantic lexical resources and semantic an-

notation tools, such as EuroWordNet (Vossen, 

1998) and USAS (Rayson et al., 2004), have 

played an important role in developing intelligent 

NLP and HLT systems. Various applications of 

semantic annotation systems and annotated corpus 

resources have been reported, including empirical 

language studies at the semantic level (Rayson et 

al. 2004; Ooi et al., 2007; Beigman Klebanov et 

al., 2008; Potts and Baker, 2013) and studies in 

information technology (Volk, et al., 2002; Nakano 

et al, 2005; Doherty et al., 2006; Chitchyan et al., 

2006; Taiani et al., 2008; Gacitua et al., 2008) 

among others. 

While various semantic annotation tools are 

available for monolingual analysis, particularly for 

English, there are few such systems that can carry 

out semantic analysis of multiple languages with a 

unified semantic annotation scheme. We aim to 

address this issue by extending an existing English 

semantic annotation tool (Rayson et al., 2004) to 

cover a range of languages.  

The USAS semantic annotation tool mentioned 

above adopts a lexical semantic classification 

scheme derived from Tom McArthur's Longman 

Lexicon of Contemporary English (McArthur, 

1981), which consists of 21 main discourse fields 

and 232 sub-fields, such as “social actions, states 

and processes” and “emotion” etc. It also uses a set 

1268



of auxiliary codes, such as m/f (male/female), +/- 

(positive/negative) etc. For example, it tags 

“happy” and “sad” with “E4.1+” and “E4.1-” re-

spectively, indicating positive and negative senti-

ment. It also identifies many types of multi-word 

expressions, such as phrasal verbs, noun phrases, 

named entities and true non-compositional idioms, 

and annotates them with single semantic tags since 

this is highly significant for identifying contextual 

meaning. Recent applications of the USAS tagger 

include analysis of literary language (Balossi, 

2014), the language of psychopaths (Hancock et al, 

2013) and scientific deception (Markowitz and 

Hancock, 2014). There would be obvious benefits 

if such a semantic tool could cover a wide range of 

languages.   Efforts have been made to port the 

existing semantic annotation system to other lan-

guages (Finnish and Russian) (Löfberg et al., 2005; 

Mudraya et al., 2006), so a prototype software 

framework could be used. However, manually de-

veloping semantic lexical resources for new lan-

guages from scratch is a time consuming task. In 

this experiment, we examine the feasibility of rap-

idly bootstrapping semantic lexical resources for 

new languages by automatically translating exist-

ing English semantic lexicons using bilingual dic-

tionaries. We developed prototype semantic 

annotation tools for Italian, Chinese and Brazilian 

Portuguese based on automatically generated se-

mantic lexicons. Our evaluation of the tools shows 

that it is feasible to rapidly develop prototype se-

mantic tools via the aforementioned automatic 

method, which can be improved and refined manu-

ally to achieve a high performance. 

2 Related Work  

There exist various tools that can semantically an-

notate multilingual texts, including GATE (Cun-

ningham et al., 2011) and KIM (Popov et al., 2003) 

which, combined together, provide multilingual 

semantic annotation functionalities based on ontol-

ogies. Freeling (Padró et al., 2012) provides multi-

lingual annotations such as named entity 

recognition and WordNet sense tagging. Recent 

developments in this area include Zhang and Ret-

tinger’s work (2014) in which they tested a toolkit 

for Wikipedia-based annotation (wikification) of 

multilingual texts. However, in the work described 

here we employ a lexicographically-informed se-

mantic classification scheme and we perform all-

words annotation. In terms of porting tools from 

one language to another by translating lexicons, 

Brooke et al. (2009) obtained poor results from a 

small dictionary in cross-linguistic sentiment anal-

ysis. 

3 Generating Multilingual Semantic Lexi-
cons by Automatic Mapping  

The USAS tagger relies heavily on the semantic 

dictionary as its knowledge source, so the main 

task in the development of our prototype semantic 

annotation tools for new languages was to generate 

semantic lexicons, both for single word and multi-

word expressions (MWE), in which words and 

MWEs can be associated with appropriate seman-

tic tags. For this purpose, our approach involves 

mapping existing English semantic lexicons into 

target languages in order to transfer the semantic 

tags across translation equivalents. The entries of 

the English semantic lexicons are classified under 

the USAS semantic annotation scheme (Archer et 

al., 2004), which consists of 21 major semantic 

categories that are further divided into 232 sub-

categories.  

In order to translate the English semantic lexi-

cons into other languages, we needed a bilingual 

lexicon for each of the target languages, Italian, 

Chinese and Portuguese in our particular case. For 

this purpose, we first used two corpus-based fre-

quency dictionaries compiled for Chinese (Xiao et 

al., 2009) and Portuguese (Davies and Preto-Bay, 

2007), which cover the 5,000 most frequent Chi-

nese and Portuguese words respectively. These 

dictionaries provided high-quality manually edited 

word translations. In addition, we used large Eng-

lish-Italian and English-Portuguese bilingual lexi-

cons available from FreeLang site 

(http://www.freelang.net/dictionary) as well as an 

English-Chinese bilingual word list available from 

LDC (Linguistic Data Consortium). Compiled 

without professional editing, these bilingual word 

lists contain errors and inaccurate translations, and 

hence they introduced noise into the mapping pro-

cess. However, they provided wider lexical cover-

age of the languages involved and complemented 

the limited sizes of the high-quality dictionaries 

used in our experiment. Table 1 lists the bilingual 

lexical resources employed for translating the Eng-

lish lexicons into each of the three languages in-

volved in our experiment.

wordlist (20,980 entries) 

Table 1: Bilingual lexical resources used. 

 
The semantic lexicon translation process mainly 

involves transferring semantic tags from an Eng-

lish lexeme to its translation equivalent/s. For in-

stance, given a pair of word/MWE translations, 

one of which is English, if the English headword is 

found in the English semantic lexicon, its semantic 

categories are passed to its translation equivalents. 

For the high-quality formal dictionaries, this ap-

proach worked very well in our experiment, thanks 

to the accurate translations and explicit part-of-

speech (POS) information provided by such re-

sources. 

With the bilingual word lists from FreeLang 

and LDC, however, this translation process was 

not straightforward. Firstly, most of the entries of 

the word lists do not contain any POS information. 

To avoid losing any potentially relevant semantic 

tags, we have to consider all possible POS catego-

ries of each English headword, and the same ap-

plies to their translation equivalents. For example, 

the English headword “advance” has four possible 

C7 POS tags (JJ-adjective, NN1-singular noun, 

VV0-base form of verb, VVI-infinitive verb) in the 

English semantic lexicon with different semantic 

categories including N4 (linear order), A9- (giv-

ing), M1 (moving, coming and going), A5.1 

(evaluation: good/bad), A2.1 (affect: modify, 

change), Q2.2 (speech acts), S8+ (helping), Q2.1 

(speech etc: communicative), although with some 

overlap, as shown below (in each line, the first 

code is a POS tag and the following ones denote 

USAS semantic categories
1
): 

advance     JJ N4  
advance     NN1 A9- M1 A5.1+/A2.1  

advance     VV0 M1 A9- Q2.2 A5.1+/A2.1  

advance     VVI M1 S8+ A9- A5.1+/A2.1 Q2.1   

In such a case, for each of the possible transla-

tion equivalents of the word “advance”, these four 

types of POS tags and their corresponding seman-

tic tags need to be assigned to their corresponding 

                                                           
1 For definitions of the POS and semantic tags, see websites 

http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/claws7tags.html and 

http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/usas/USASSemanticTagset.pdf 

translations in the target languages. Obviously this 

would lead to passing wrong and redundant seman-

tic tags to the translation equivalents. Nevertheless, 

we have to accept such noise in order to increase 

the chances of obtaining correct semantic tags, as it 

would be easier to remove redundant/incorrect se-

mantic tags than searching for missing ones in the 

manual improvement stage. 

Another major challenge in the translation pro-

cess was the mapping between the POS tagsets 

employed by different lexical resources and tools. 

Even for the same language, different lexicons and 

tools can employ different POS tagsets. For exam-

ple, different Portuguese POS tagsets are used by 

the Portuguese frequency dictionary and the POS 

TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994). To bridge between the 

different POS tagsets, we designed a simplified 

common POS tagset for each language, into which 

other tags can be mapped. For example, the Portu-

guese POS tagset was simplified into 12 categories 

“adj, adv, det, noun, pnoun, verb, pron, conj, intj, 

prep, num, punc”. Because a single semantic cate-

gory tends to span similar POS categories, e.g. pre-

sent/past/progressive tense of verbs, simplification 

of POS tagsets generally does not affect semantic 

annotation accuracy.  

After applying all the resources and automatic 

mapping described above, we obtained approxi-

mately 38,720, 83,600 and 15,700 semantic lexi-

con entries for Italian, Chinese and Portuguese 

respectively. Our initial evaluation involved direct 

manual checking of these bootstrapped lexicons. 

For example, 5,622 Italian MWE entries and 1,763 

Italian single word entries have been manually cor-

rected. For the Chinese lexicon, the most frequent 

words were identified using the Chinese word fre-

quency list of Internet Corpus (Sharoff, 2006), and 

the semantic tags of about 560 entries related to the 

most frequent words were manually corrected. For 

Portuguese, about 900 lexicon entries were manu-

ally checked. 

The manual improvement mainly involves three 

processes: a) filtering lexicon entries having wrong 

POS tags, b) selecting correct semantic tags from 

candidates, c) adding missing semantic tags. The 

amount of effort needed depends on the quality of 

the bilingual dictionaries. For example, from the 

automatically generated 900 Chinese entries con-

taining the most frequent (also highly ambiguous) 

words, 505 entries were selected after the POS fil-

tering. In addition, 145 of them were improved by 

1270



adding missing semantic tags. Table 2 shows the 

sizes of the current lexicons.

4 Architecture of Annotation System  

Based on the multilingual semantic lexicons de-

scribed in the previous section, prototype semantic 

taggers were built for the three languages by de-

ploying the lexicons into the existing software ar-

chitecture, which employs disambiguation methods 

reported by Rayson et al. (2004). A set of POS 

tagging tools were incorporated to pre-process 

texts from the target languages. The TreeTagger 

(Schmid, 1994) was used for Italian and Portu-

guese, and the Stanford POS tagger (Toutanova et 

al., 2003) was used for Chinese. These tools and 

semantic lexicon look-up components form pipe-

lines to annotate words in running texts. Figure 1 

shows the architecture of the software framework.

5 Evaluation of Prototype System  

Following the initial manual evaluation of the pro-

totype semantic taggers described in section 3, we 

then carried out larger scale automatic evaluations 

using a set of sample corpora. We conducted two 

complementary types of evaluations: lexical cover-

age and annotation precision. The lexical coverage 

is a particularly interesting metric for our evalua-

tion, as we expect this is where an automatic ap-

proach can make significant contribution to the 

development of annotation systems. On the other 

hand, high annotation precision normally entails 

manual improvement of the lexical resources or a 

period of training on manually tagged corpora.  

For the lexical coverage evaluation, three refer-

ence corpora were chosen: PAISÀ Italian corpus 

(Borghetti et al., 2011), LCMC Corpus (Lancaster 

Corpus of Mandarin Chinese) (McEnery and Xiao, 

2004) and Lacio-Ref Portuguese corpus (Aluisio et 

al., 2003). Because PAISÀ and Lacio-Ref corpora 

are too large for our purpose, we extracted sub-

sections of about 1.5 million Italian words and 1.7 

million Portuguese words from them. 

For the evaluation, we annotated the corpus 

data using the annotation tools of the correspond-

ing target languages, and examined what percent-

age of the words were assigned with semantic tags. 

Punctuation marks were excluded in this evalua-

tion process. Table 3 shows the statistics of the 

evaluation for each language.

Average  79.86 

Table 3: Lexical coverage of the semantic taggers. 

 

As shown in the table, the annotation tools 

achieved an average lexical coverage of 79.86% 

over the three languages, with Italian having the 

highest coverage of 85.53% and Portuguese the 

lowest coverage of 73.40%. Due to the different 

types of data in the three sample corpora, this re-

sult is not conclusive. Homogeneous corpus data 

from all of the three languages will be needed to 

make more reliable comparison of the lexical cov-

erage. Considering that the tools were built based 

on only three bilingual lexical resources over a 

short period of time, such lexical coverage is en-

couraging. This result also demonstrates that, if 

sufficiently large bilingual lexicons become avail-

able; our approach can potentially achieve high 

lexical coverage. 

Next we conducted an evaluation of the preci-

sion of the prototype tools. We randomly selected 

sample texts for each language as follows. Italian 

sample texts were selected from domains of press, 

contemporary literature and blogs; Chinese sample 

texts from press, reviews and fiction; Portuguese 

sample texts from press and fiction. In the evalua-

tion, we annotated the sample texts using the pro-

totype annotation tools and manually checked the 

precision among the annotated words. We used 

two metrics: correctly tagged and partially cor-

pos tagger

rectly tagged. With the current tools, a word can be 

assigned with multiple candidate semantic tags. 

The first evaluation metric refers to the cases 

where the first candidate tag is correct, whereas the 

other metric refers to the cases where the other tags 

in the list are correct or closely related to the true 

word sense. Table 4 shows the statistics of the 

evaluation.

Avg  71.42% 13.22% 

Table 4: Evaluation of precision. 

 

As shown in the table, the Portuguese tagger 

obtained the highest first-tag precision (82.58%), 

while the Italian tagger produced a precision 

(55.91%) significantly lower than others. However, 

if we include the partially correct annotations, the 

precision scores become more consistent: 76.49%, 

87.69% and 89.72% for the three languages re-

spectively, with an average precision of 84.64%. 

We also estimated recall based on the numbers of 

tokens of the sample texts and those tagged cor-

rectly/partially correctly, obtaining 55.39%, 

67.71% and 69.46% for Italian, Chinese and Por-

tuguese respectively. Such a fairly close range of 

the precision and recall values indicates that our 

approach to developing prototype semantic annota-

tion tools can be expected to achieve stable results 

across various languages, although we need larger-

scale evaluations to draw a conclusion. It is worth 

noting that, although the recall is still low, these 

taggers are starting to approach the precision of the 

English system at 91% (Rayson et al., 2004). 

Our further error analysis revealed that the main 

causes of the errors include the homonym transla-

tions (e.g. bank as river bank vs. money bank), 

translation errors and missing of the translation 

words in the English semantic lexicons. For exam-

ple, the Chinese word “爸爸” (father) has a num-
ber of synonymous English translation equivalents 

in the bilingual lexicon: dad (with semantic tag 

S4m), baba, da, dada, daddy (S4m), father (S4m 

S9/S2m), papa (S4m). It is also translated into 

presence (M6, A3+, S1.1.3+, S1.2, S9) by mis-

take. Among the correct English translations, baba, 

da, dada (transliteration) are not included in the 

English semantic lexicons. Making things worse, 

da is a homonym which is classified as a discourse 

marker of exclamation (Z4) in English lexicons. 

Our current automatic process collects all the se-

mantic tags derived from the English translation 

counterparts found in the bilingual lexicon and as-

signs them to the Chinese word “爸爸”, resulting in 

an erroneous entry as shown below: 
     爸爸    noun    M6 A3+ S1.1.3+ S1.2 S9 S4/B1 S4m S9/S2.2m Z4 

In order to resolve such cases, we will need to con-

sider contexts of each translation word pairs’ usage 

via parallel or comparable corpora. 

6 Conclusion and Future Work  

In this paper, we have investigated the feasibility 

of rapidly bootstrapping semantic annotation tools 

for new target languages
2
 by mapping an existing 

semantic lexicon and software architecture. In par-

ticular, we tested the possibility of automatically 

translating existing English semantic lexicons into 

other languages, Italian, Chinese and Brazilian 

Portuguese in this particular case. Our experiment 

demonstrates that, if appropriate high-quality bi-

lingual lexicons are available, it is feasible to rap-

idly generating prototype systems with a good 

lexical coverage with our automatic approach. On 

the other hand, our experiment also shows that, in 

order to achieve a high precision, paral-

lel/comparable corpus based disambiguation is 

needed for identifying precise translation equiva-

lents, and a certain amount of manual cleaning and 

improvement of the automatically generated se-

mantic lexicons is indispensible. We are continu-

ing to improve the multilingual semantic taggers 

and extend them to cover more languages, such as 

Spanish and Dutch, aiming to develop a large-scale 

multilingual semantic annotation and analysis sys-

tem. We also intend to perform task-based evalua-

tion of the manually checked versus automatically 

generated lexicons.
