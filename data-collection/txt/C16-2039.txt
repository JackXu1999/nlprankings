Abstract

In this paper, we introduce papago - a translator for mobile device which is equipped with new
features that can provide convenience for users. The first feature is word sense disambiguation
based on user feedback. By using the feature, users can select one among multiple meanings
of a homograph and obtain the corrected translation with the user-selected sense. The second
feature is the instant currency conversion of money expressions contained in a translation result
with current exchange rate. Users can be quickly and precisely provided the amount of money
converted as local currency when they travel abroad.

1 Introduction

papago1 is a multi-language machine translator for mobile device that supports English, Japanese, Chi-
nese and Korean. The mobile application is similar to Google Translate, Microsoft Translator and Baidu
Translate.

With the spread of smartphones and increasing of overseas trips, the need of the translation service for
mobile devices is increasing. As artificial intelligence technology develops, there are growing expecta-
tions of a translator among users.

Most translators take voice, text or images as an input, display the translated text and output the sound
converted the text into speech. Therefore, the translation service requires use of high-level technologies
including speech recognition, optical character recognition, machine translation and speech synthesis.
papago can take voice, text or image as an input and provide both translation text and text-to-speech as
outputs in common with other translators.

In addition, we introduce new features that can provide convenience for users as follows:

• Word sense disambiguation (WSD) based on user feedback: The translator suggests multiple
meanings of a homograph in an input sentence. Users can select one meaning and obtain the re-
translated sentence with the user-specified sense. Each sense is given as a simple picture within the
translation result screen.

• Instant currecy conversion: If there is a money expression in an input sentence, our translator
provides the instant currency conversion of money expressions with current exchange rate. Users
can quickly and precisely be provided the amount of money converted as local currency during their
traveling abroad.

In this paper, we focus on two features briefly described above. Section 2 explains the word sense
disambiguation based on user feedback. Section 3 presents the instant currency conversion and the money
information extraction. In section 4, we conclude the paper.

2 Word sense disambiguation based on user feedback

The first proposed feature, WSD2 is needed by the following reasons:

• In mobile devices, translator users tend to input short and ambiguous sentences. If the input includes
a homograph, it causes a lack of the word context and so its translation result can be different from
user intention. For example, In Korean-to-English, the input ‘기사가필요해요’, whose meaning
is ‘I need기사’, has a homograph ‘기사’ which has four senses, a knight, an article, a driver and
an engineer. A translator cannot understand user intention, i.e. the precise meaning of ‘기사’.

• Users may want to correct only several words of an incorrect translation result.
• Users may want to verify if the translation of a homograph is correct or not.
To satisfy such demands, we propose the feature that helps users inspect which sense a homograph

translation has, and change it to another translation. We also propose to use pictures when suggesting
multiple meanings of a homograph to users. Picture is a great means to suggest word meanings to users,
because users can easily understand word senses through pictures and they are applicable regardless of
language. If user selects a picture, the application shows a new translation result. Figure 1b shows user
interface for suggestions of WSD.

To implement this feature, we have to solve two technical problems:

1. Detecting a homograph and its translation from the input and output sentence pair.

2. Re-translating the input with user-selected sense, i.e. corresponding translation with the selected
picture.

2.1 Detecting homograph and its translation
We detect both a homograph in an input (source sentence) and the translation of the homograph in the
output (target sentence), based on dictionary-based matching after the translation decoding process. We
determine whether each word contained in both source and target sentences is highlighted or not. We
use the phrase alignment links acquired in the decoding process to recognize the connection between the
homograph and its translation word to be highlighted. We can obtain the phrase alignment after decoding
of each sentence, because our translator employs the (hierarchical) phrase-based(Koehn et al., 2003;
Chiang, 2005) model as a core translation model.

2In natural language processing field, WSD generally refers to the task in which researchers determine a sense for each
ambiguous word in a given sentence, fully automatically. We call the feature WSD, even if we manually disambiguate a word
sense by users.

Table 1: Example of dictionary for WSD

We look a word up in the dictionary for WSD. It is a manually constructed list of pairs of a homo-
graph and its translation for three language pairs: Korean-English, Korean-Chinese and Korean-Japanese.
Therefore, we only support three directions for WSD. Table 1 shows a part of the dictionary for WSD.

Korean nouns were selected from the Standard Korean Language Dictionary of the National Institute
of the Korean Language (NIKL)3. The dictionary was constructed through the following process:

1. Korean nouns with two or more senses are selected as entry candidates.

2. For each sense of each candidate, we find English, Chinese, and Japanese translations from a trans-
lation dictionary.

3. Save the word and its translations, if all translations of each sense are found, exclude it, otherwise.

4. Make a picture suitable for each sense and save it in the database.

We have finally acquired 931 Korean homographs and 2,050 translations of them for each target lan-
guage: English, Chinese and Japanese4. We have constructed the entry with top-N frequent nouns of our
corpus, so that it can cover as many homographs as possible.

2.2 Re-translating with user-selected sense
Our desired re-translation method is not a primitive word replacement but re-decoding a whole sentence.
For example, if a user selects ‘car’ rather than ‘tea’ (picture) in the translation ‘A cup of tea, please’ of
‘차 좀 주세요’, the translation should be corrected to ‘Give me a car.’ Thus, we propose a modified
(hierarchical) phrase-based decoding method for re-translation.

If user selects a picture, i.e. a word sense, its corresponding translation, which can be a single or multi-
word, is delivered to the translation decoder. For the reliable re-translation, we implemented online phrase
filtering method for SMT decoder. SMT decoder recognizes the user request as (a list of) a source word
index and its corresponding target word. When the decoder translates the source phrase containing the
user-specified source index, it ignores every phrase pair whose target phrase does not contain the user-
specified target word. Sometimes it is possible that there is no suitable phrase pair at all. In this case, we
treat the specified source word as unknown word and replace it by the target word at post-processing.
This guarantees the occurrence of the target word in translation result.

3 Instant currency conversion

International travelers commonly have needs of currency conversion. It may be useful for travelers to
provide the currency-converted price in addition to translation result.

We propose the second feature that instantly converts the currency of the price contained in a money
expression. If a translation result contains an expression of money, our translator highlights it and shows
the price converted with the current exchange rate. The screenshot of this feature is shown in figure 1c.
It is processed through the following process:

1. Translate the input sentence into target language.

4Since the submission we have expanded the entry of our homograph list. We had acquired 455 homographs and 1,024

translations when we submitted this paper.

2. Detect and normalize money expressions from the translation result. (Described in section 3.1)

3. If one or more money expressions are detected, make an inquiry about current exchange rate5.

4. Convert the amount of money obtained in 2. into the target currency.

Our policies for dectection and conversion of money expressions are as follows: We detect only cur-
rencies corresponding with source and target laguages of a translation result; e.g. US dollar and Korean
won for English-to-Korean translation. And also, we convert the normailized value into the currency
of opposite nation; e.g. Korean won to US dollar or US dollar to Korean won for English-to-Korean
translation.

3.1 Detecting and normalizing money expression
We develop a module of money information extraction for the four languages: Korean, English, Chinese,
and Japanese. It takes a raw sentence as an input, and generates a set of MONEY tags as an output.
The MONEY tags convey some meta information about the money expressions. For the sentence “We
borrowed 10 dollars from him”, there will be one MONEY tag whose extent is ‘10 dollars’. The tag will
also have a normalized amount of money (e.g., 10) and the corresponding currency (e.g., USD), where
the format of currency follows ISO 42176. The task of normalization of money expression is difficult
due to the various ways of representing the same amount of money. For instance, the money expressions
‘three dollars’ and ‘3 bucks’ mean the same amount of money. Moreover, some variations of money
expressions are language-specific. The amount of money can be a real number in English, while it is not
the case in some other languages (e.g., Korean). By taking these linguistic variations into account, the
rules are carefully designed. To evaluate the rules, we construct the MONEY tagged corpus that consists
of 300 - 500 sentences for each language. The evaluation results with the dataset show F1-scores higher
than 94 in every language.

4 Conclusion

We introduced a machine translation service which is equipped with new features that can provide con-
venience for users. By using WSD based on user feedback, users can select one among word senses and
obtain the corrected translation with the user-specified meaning. By using instant currency conversion,
users can be quickly and precisely provided the amount of money converted as local currency when they
travel abroad.

For the future work, we plan to also support English-to-X not only Korean-to-X for WSD. Moreover
we try to design the database and the system architecture that can recognize multiple translations, i.e.
synonyms for each sense in the dictionary for WSD.

5We use the three exchange rates, Korean won per US dollar, Korean won per Chinese yuan and Korean won per Japanese
yen. They are provided by KEB Hana Bank every hour. We can obtain the rates for all of 12 conversion directions between 4
languages from combinations of the three rates.
