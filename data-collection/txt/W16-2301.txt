Abstract

This paper presents the results of the
WMT16 shared tasks, which included five
machine translation (MT) tasks (standard
news, IT-domain, biomedical, multimodal,
pronoun), three evaluation tasks (metrics,
tuning, run-time estimation of MT qual-
ity), and an automatic post-editing task
and bilingual document alignment task.
This year, 102 MT systems from 24 in-
stitutions (plus 36 anonymized online sys-
tems) were submitted to the 12 translation
directions in the news translation task. The
IT-domain task received 31 submissions
from 12 institutions in 7 directions and the
Biomedical task received 15 submissions
systems from 5 institutions. Evaluation
was both automatic and manual (relative
ranking and 100-point scale assessments).

The quality estimation task had three sub-
tasks, with a total of 14 teams, submitting
39 entries. The automatic post-editing task
had a total of 6 teams, submitting 11 en-
tries.

1 Introduction

We present the results of the shared tasks of the
First Conference on Statistical Machine Transla-
tion (WMT) held at ACL 2016. This confer-
ence builds on nine previous WMT workshops
(Koehn and Monz, 2006; Callison-Burch et al.,
2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012; Bojar et al.,
2013, 2014, 2015).

This year we conducted several official tasks.
We report in this paper on five tasks:
• news translation (§2, §3)
• IT-domain translation (§4)
• biomedical translation (§5)
• quality estimation (§6)
• automatic post-editing (§7)
The conference featured additional shared tasks

that are described in separate papers in these pro-
ceedings:
• tuning (Jawaid et al., 2016)
• metrics (Bojar et al., 2016b)
• cross-lingual pronoun prediction (Guillou

et al., 2016)
• multimodal machine translation and crosslin-

gual image description (Specia et al., 2016)
• bilingual document alignment (Buck and

Koehn, 2016)

In the news translation task (§2), participants
were asked to translate a shared test set, option-
ally restricting themselves to the provided train-
ing data. We held 12 translation tasks this year,
between English and each of Czech, German,
Finnish, Russian, Romanian, and Turkish. The
Romanian and Turkish translation tasks were new
this year, providing a lesser resourced data con-
dition on challenging language pairs. The system
outputs for each task were evaluated both automat-
ically and manually.

The human evaluation (§3) involves asking
human judges to rank sentences output by
anonymized systems. We obtained large num-
bers of rankings from researchers who contributed

131



evaluations proportional to the number of tasks
they entered. We made data collection more effi-
cient and used TrueSkill as ranking method. We
also explored a novel way of ranking machine
translation systems by judgments of adequacy and
fluency on a 100-point scale.

The IT translation task (§4) was introduced this
year and focused on domain adaptation of MT to
the IT (information technology) domain and trans-
lation of answers in a cross-lingual help-desk ser-
vice, where hardware&software troubleshooting
answers are translated from English to the users’
languages: Bulgarian, Czech, German, Spanish,
Basque, Dutch and Portuguese. Similarly as in the
News translation task, training and test data were
provided and the system outputs were evaluated
both automatically and manually.

Another task newly introduced this year was
the biomedical translation task (§5). Participants
were asked to translate the titles and abstracts of
scientific articles indexed in the Scielo database.
Training and test data were provided for two sub-
domains, biological sciences and health sciences,
and three language pairs, Portuguese/English,
Spanish/English and French/English. This task
therefore provided data for a language not previ-
ously covered in WMT, Portuguese. The system
outputs for each language pair were evaluated both
automatically and manually.

The quality estimation task (§6) this year in-
cluded three subtasks: sentence-level prediction of
post-editing effort scores, word and phrase-level
prediction of good/bad labels, and document-level
prediction of human post-editing scores. Datasets
were released with English→German IT trans-
lations for sentence and word/phrase level, and
English↔Spanish news translations for document
level.

The automatic post-editing task (§7) examined
automatic methods for correcting errors produced
by an unknown machine translation system. Par-
ticipants were provided with training triples con-
taining source, target and human post-edits, and
were asked to return automatic post-edits for un-
seen (source, target) pairs. In this second round,
the task focused on correcting English→German
translations in the IT domain.

The primary objectives of WMT are to evalu-
ate the state of the art in machine translation, to
disseminate common test sets and public train-
ing data with published performance numbers, and

to refine evaluation and estimation methodologies
for machine translation. As before, all of the
data, translations, and collected human judgments
are publicly available.1 We hope these datasets
serve as a valuable resource for research into sta-
tistical machine translation and automatic evalu-
ation or prediction of translation quality. News
and IT translations are also available for interac-
tive visualization and comparison of differences
between systems at http://wmt.ufal.cz using
MT-ComparEval (Sudarikov et al., 2016).

2 News Translation Task

The recurring WMT task examines translation be-
tween English and other languages in the news do-
main. As in the previous years, we include Ger-
man, Czech, Russian, and Finnish. New languages
this years are Romanian and Turkish.

We created a test set for each language pair by
translating newspaper articles and provided train-
ing data.

2.1 Test data

The test data for this year’s task was selected from
online sources, as before. We took about 1500 En-
glish sentences and translated them into the other
5 languages, and then additional 1500 sentences
from each of the other languages and translated
them into English. This gave us test sets of about
3000 sentences for our English-X language pairs,
which have been either originally written in En-
glish and translated into X, or vice versa. The
composition of the test documents is shown in Ta-
ble 1.

The stories were translated by professional
translators, funded by the EU Horizon 2020
projects CRACKER and QT21 (German, Czech,
Romanian), by Yandex2, a Russian search engine
company (Turkish, Russian), and by BAULT, a re-
search community on building and using language
technology funded by the University of Helsinki
(Finnish). For Finnish, a second translation was
provided as well, but not used in the evaluation.
All of the translations were done directly, and not
via an intermediate language.

For Turkish we also released an additional 500
sentence development set, and for Romanian a
third of the test set were released as a development

132



set instead. For the other languages, test sets from
previous years are available as development sets.

2.2 Training data

As in past years we provided parallel corpora to
train translation models, monolingual corpora to
train language models, and development sets to
tune system parameters. Some training corpora
were identical from last year (Europarl3, United
Nations, French-English 109 corpus, Common
Crawl, Russian-English parallel data provided by
Yandex, Wikipedia Headlines provided by CMU)
and some were updated (CzEng v1.6pre (Bojar
et al., 2016a), News Commentary v11, monolin-
gual news data).

We added a few new corpora:

• Romanian Europarl (Koehn, 2002)
• SETIMES2 from OPUS for Romanian–

English and Turkish–English (Tiedemann,
2009)
• Monolingual data sets from CommonCrawl

(Buck et al., 2014)

Some statistics about the training materials are
given in Figure 1.

2.3 Submitted systems

We received 102 submissions from 24 institu-
tions. The participating institutions and their entry
names are listed in Table 2; each system did not
necessarily appear in all translation tasks. We also
included 36 online statistical MT systems (origi-
nating from 4 services), which we anonymized as
ONLINE-A,B,F,G.

For presentation of the results, systems are
treated as either constrained or unconstrained, de-
pending on whether their models were trained only
on the provided data. Since we do not know how
they were built, these online and commercial sys-
tems are treated as unconstrained during the auto-
matic and human evaluations.

3 Human Evaluation

Each year, we conduct a human evaluation
campaign to assess translation quality and deter-
mine the final ranking of candidate systems. This
section describes how we prepared the evaluation
data, collected human assessments, and computed
the official results.

3As of Fall 2011, the proceedings of the European Parlia-
ment are no longer translated into all official languages.

Over the past few years, our method of col-
lecting and evaluating the manual translations has
settled into the following pattern. We ask hu-
man annotators to rank the outputs of five systems.
From these rankings, we produce pairwise trans-
lation comparisons, and then evaluate them with a
version of the TrueSkill algorithm adapted to our
task. We refer to this approach (described in Sec-
tion 3.4) as the relative ranking approach (RR),
so named because the pairwise comparisons de-
note only relative ability between a pair of sys-
tems, and cannot be used to infer their absolute
quality. These results are used to produce the of-
ficial ranking for the WMT 2016 tasks. However,
work in evaluation over the past few years has pro-
vided fresh insight into ways to collect direct as-
sessments (DA) of machine translation quality. In
this setting, annotators are asked to provide an as-
sessment of the direct quality of the output of a
system relative to a reference translation. In or-
der to evaluate the potential of this approach for
future WMT evaluations, we conducted a direct
assessment evaluation in parallel. This evaluation,
together with a comparison of the official results,
is described in Section 3.5.

3.1 Evaluation campaign overview

Following the trend from previous years, WMT16
ended up being the largest evaluation campaign to
date. Similar to last year, we collected researcher-
based judgments only (as opposed to crowd-
sourcing annotations from a tool like Mechanical
Turk). For the News translation task, a total of
150 individual annotator accounts were involved.
Users came from 33 different research groups and
contributed judgments on 10,833 HITs.

Each HIT comprises three 5-way ranking tasks
for a total of 32,499 such tasks. Under ordinary
circumstances, each of the tasks would correspond
to ten individual pairwise system comparisons de-
noting whether a system A was judged better than,
worse than, or equivalent to another system B.
However, since many systems have produced the
same outputs for a particular sentence, we are of-
ten able to produce more than ten comparisons
(Section 3.2), ending up with a total of 569,287
pairwise annotations—a 75.2% increase over the
expected baseline of 324,990 pairs. This is smaller
than last year’s gain of 87.1% as we have decided
to preserve punctuation differences. Section 3.2
provides more details on our pre-processing.

each document in the test set, and the origlang tag indicates the original source language.

In total, our human annotators spent nearly 39
days and 3 hours working in Appraise. This gives
an average annotation time of 6.4 hours per user.
The average annotation time per HIT amounts to
5 minutes and 12 seconds. This is a little slower
than last year’s average time of 4 minutes and 53
seconds. Similar to the previous campaign, sev-
eral of the annotators passed the mark of more
than 100 HITs annotated (the maximum number
being 684) and, again, some worked for more than
24 hours (the most patient annotator contributing
a little over 99 hours of annotation work).

The effort that goes into the manual evalua-
tion campaign each year is impressive, and we
are grateful to all participating individuals and
teams. We believe that human annotation provides
the best decision basis for evaluation of machine
translation output and it is great to see continued
contributions on this large scale.

3.2 Data collection

The system ranking is produced from a large set
of pairwise judgments, each of which indicates
the relative quality of the outputs of two systems’
translations of the same input sentence. Annota-
tions are collected in an evaluation campaign that
enlists participants in the shared task to help. Each

team is asked to contribute one hundred so-called
“Human Intelligence Tasks” (HITs) per primary
system submitted.

We continue to use the open-source Appraise4

(Federmann, 2012) tool for our data collection.
Last year, we had provided the following instruc-
tions at the top of each HIT page:

You are shown a source sentence fol-
lowed by several candidate translations.
Your task is to rank the translations from
best to worst (ties are allowed).

This year, in order to optimize screen space we
have streamlined the user interface, removing the
instruction text (which instead was communicated
to annotators outside of the HIT annotation inter-
face) and trimming vertical spacing. A screenshot
of the Appraise relative ranking interface is shown
in Figure 2.

Annotators are asked to rank the outputs from 1
(best) to 5 (worst), with ties permitted. Note that a
lower rank is better, and that this is clear from the
interface design. Annotators can decide to skip a
ranking task but are instructed to do this only as a
last resort, e.g., if the translation candidates shown
on screen are clearly misformatted or contain data

Figure 2: Screenshot of the Appraise interface used in the human evaluation campaign. The annotator is presented with a

issues (wrong language, encoding errors or other,
obvious problems). Similar to last year, only a few
ranking tasks have been skipped in WMT16.

Each HIT consists of three so-called ranking
tasks. In a ranking task, an annotator is presented
with a source segment, a human reference trans-
lation, and the outputs of up to five anonymized
candidate systems, randomly selected from the set
of participating systems, and displayed in random
order. This year, as with last year, we perform a re-
dundancy cleanup as an initial preprocessing step
and create multi-system outputs to avoid confus-
ing annotators with identical content: instead of
selecting five systems and displaying their (identi-
cal) outputs, we select five distinct outputs, and
then propagate the collected rankings to all the
individual systems within each of the respective
multi-system outputs. Last year, however, nearly-
identical outputs were collapsed if they differed
only on punctuation. Because punctuation is an

important component of producing quality MT
output, this year, we only collapse outputs that
are exactly the same, apart from differences in
nonzero whitespace.

To demonstrate how this works, we provide the
following example. First, consider the case where
we select system outputs directly, instead of the
multi-system outputs described above. Here, we
consider an annotation provided by a judge among
the outputs of systems A,B, F,H , and J :

F •
A •
B •
J •
H •

The joint rankings provided by a ranking task are
then expanded to a set of pairwise rankings pro-
duced by considering all

Table 3: Amount of data (pairwise comparisons after “de-collapsing” multi-system outputs) collected in the WMT16 manual
evaluation campaign. The final five rows report summary information from previous years of the workshop. Note how many
rankings we get for Czech language pairs; these include systems from the tuning shared task.

As the number of outputs n depends on the
number of identical (and, hence, redundant) multi-
system outputs in the original data, we end up
getting varying numbers of corresponding binary
judgments. Now, consider the case of multi-system
outputs. If the outputs of system A and F from
above are actually identical, the annotator this year
would see an easier ranking task:5

1 2 3 4 5
AF •
B •
J •
H •

Both examples would be reduced to the following
set of pairwise judgments:

A > B,A = F,A > H,A < J

B < F,B < H,B < J

F > H,F < J

H < J

Here, A > B should be read is “A is ranked
higher than (worse than) B”. Note that by this pro-
cedure, the absolute value of ranks and the mag-
nitude of their differences are discarded. In the

5Technically, another distinct output would have been in-
serted, if possible, so as to present the annotator with five, but
we ignore that for illustration purposes.

case of multi-system outputs, this set of pairwise
rankings would have been produced with less an-
notator effort. This productivity gain grows in the
number of systems that produce identical output,
and this situation is quite common, due in part to
the fact that many systems are built on the same
underlying technology. Table 3 has more details.

3.3 Annotator agreement

Each year we calculate annotator agreement
scores for the human evaluation as a measure of
the reliability of the rankings. We measured pair-
wise agreement among annotators using Cohen’s
kappa coefficient (κ) (Cohen, 1960). If P (A) be
the proportion of times that the annotators agree,
and P (E) is the proportion of time that they would
agree by chance, then Cohen’s kappa is:

κ =
P (A)− P (E)
1− P (E)

Note that κ is basically a normalized version of
P (A), one which takes into account how mean-
ingful it is for annotators to agree with each other
by incorporating P (E). The values for κ range
from 0 to 1, with zero indicating no agreement and
1 perfect agreement.

We calculate P (A) by examining all pairs of

Table 4: κ scores measuring inter-annotator agreement for WMT16. See Table 5 for corresponding intra-annotator agreement
scores. WMT14–WMT16 results are based on researchers’ judgments only, whereas prior years mixed judgments of researchers
and crowdsourcers.

outputs6 which had been judged by two or more
judges, and calculating the proportion of time that
they agreed that A < B, A = B, or A > B. In
other words, P (A) is the empirical, observed rate
at which annotators agree, in the context of pair-
wise comparisons.

As for P (E), it captures the probability that two
annotators would agree randomly. Therefore:

P (E) = P (A<B)2 + P (A=B)2 + P (A>B)2

Note that each of the three probabilities in P (E)’s
definition are squared to reflect the fact that we are
considering the chance that two annotators would
agree by chance. Each of these probabilities is
computed empirically, by observing how often an-
notators actually rank two systems as being tied.

Table 4 shows final κ values for inter-annotator
agreement for WMT11–WMT16 while Table 5
details intra-annotator agreement scores. The ex-
act interpretation of the kappa coefficient is dif-
ficult, but according to Landis and Koch (1977),
0–0.2 is slight, 0.2–0.4 is fair, 0.4–0.6 is moder-
ate, 0.6–0.8 is substantial, and 0.8–1.0 is almost
perfect.

Compared to last year’s results, inter-annotator
agreement rates have decreased. Notably, for

6Regardless if they correspond to an individual system
or to a set of systems (“multi-system”) producing identical
translations. Thus, when computing annotator agreement
scores, we effectively treat both individual and multi-systems
in the same way, as “individual comparison units”. By doing
so, we avoid artificially inflating our agreement scores based
on the automatically inferredA = B ties from multi-systems.

Czech→English, we see a drop from 0.458 to
0.244. English→Czech decreases from 0.438 to
0.381. Considering that the total number of data
points collected as well as the number of annota-
tors for these language pairs have increased sub-
stantially, the lower agreement score seems plau-
sible.7 We observe a small increase in agree-
ment for German→English (from 0.423 to 0.475)
and a drop for English→German (from 0.434 to
0.369). Scores for both Russian language pairs
are similar to what had been measured in WMT15.
For Finnish, we again see a decrease (from 0.388
to 0.293 for Finnish→English and from 0.549
to 0.484 for English→Finnish) and our new lan-
guages, Romanian and Turkish, end up with fair
annotator agreement. The average inter-annotator
agreement across all languages is 0.357, which is
also fair and comparable to researchers’ agree-
ment over the last years. Intra-annotator agree-
ment scores have mostly decreased compared to
WMT15, except for both Russian language pairs.
The new languages show moderate agreement ex-
cept for English→Turkish which achieves a fair
score. On average we observe an intra-annotator
agreement which is comparable to researcher-
based scores from WMT13–WMT15.

7Both Czech→English and English→Czech contain
tuning-task systems with very similar quality (according to
both human evaluation and BLEU), which makes the annota-
tion task more difficult.

human evaluation campaign. Scores are in line with results from WMT14 and WMT15.

3.4 Producing the human ranking

The collected pairwise rankings are used to pro-
duce the official human ranking of the sys-
tems. Since WMT14, we have used the TrueSkill
method for producing the official ranking, in the
following fashion. We produce 1,000 bootstrap-
resampled datasets over all of the available data
(i.e., datasets sampled uniformly with replacement
from the complete dataset). We run TrueSkill over
each dataset. We then compute a rank range for
each system by collecting the absolute rank of
each system in each fold, throwing out the top
and bottom 2.5%, and then clustering systems into
equivalence classes containing systems with over-
lapping ranges, yielding a partial ordering over
systems at the 95% confidence level.

The full list of the official human rankings for
each task can be found in Table 6, which also re-
ports all system scores, rank ranges, and clusters
for all language pairs and all systems. The official
interpretation of these results is that systems in the
same cluster are considered tied. Given the large
number of judgments that we collected, it was pos-
sible to group on average about two systems in a
cluster, even though the systems in the middle are
typically in larger clusters.

In Figure 3–5, we plotted the human evalu-
ation result against everybody’s favorite metric
BLEU. Although these two metrics correlate gen-
erally well, the plots clearly suggest that a fair
comparison of systems of different kinds cannot

rely on automatic scores. Rule-based systems re-
ceive a much lower BLEU score than statistical
systems (see for instance English–German, e.g.,
PROMT-RULE). The same is true to a lesser degree
for statistical syntax-based systems (see English–
German, UEDIN-SYNTAX vs. UEDIN-PBMT).

3.5 Direct Assessment Manual Evaluation

In addition to the standard relative ranking (RR)
manual evaluation, this year a new method of hu-
man evaluation was also trialed in the main trans-
lation task: monolingual direct assessment (DA)
of translation fluency (Graham et al., 2013) and
adequacy (Graham et al., 2014, 2016).

Agreement between human assessors of trans-
lation quality is a known problem in evaluation of
MT and DA therefore aims to simplify translation
assessment, which conventionally takes the form
of a bilingual evaluation, by restructuring the task
into a monolingual assessment. Figure 6 provides
a screen shot of DA adequacy assessment, where
the task is structured as a monolingual similarity
of meaning task.

Human assessors are asked to rate a given trans-
lation by how adequately it expresses the meaning
of the corresponding reference translation on an
analogue scale, which corresponds to an underly-
ing absolute 0–100 rating. DA fluency assessment
is similar with two exceptions, firstly no reference
translation is displayed and secondly, assessors are
asked to rate how much they agree that a given
translation is fluent target language text. DA flu-

the simpler monolingual assessment DA employs
also allows the sentence length restriction to be re-
moved.8

DA also aims to avoid the possible source of
bias identified in Bojar et al. (2011), introduced by
simultaneous assessment of several translations at
once, where systems for which translations were
more frequently compared to other low or high
quality outputs resulted in either an unfair advan-
tage or disadvantage for that system. We there-
fore elicit assessments of individual translations in
isolation from the output of other systems, an im-
portant criteria when aiming for absolute quality
judgments.

Large numbers of human assessments of trans-
lations for seven language pairs (cs-en, de-en, fi-
en, ro-en, ru-en, tr-en and en-ru) were collected on
Amazon’s Mechanical Turk.9 Table 7 shows over-
all numbers of translation assessments carried out.

Translations are arranged in sets of 100-
translations per HIT to ensure sufficient repeat
items per worker, before application of strict qual-
ity control measures to filter out assessments from
poorly performing workers. When an analogue (or
100-points, in practice) scale is employed, agree-

ment cannot be measured using the conventional
Kappa coefficient, ordinarily applied to evaluation
of human assessment where judgments are dis-
crete categories or preferences. Instead, we fil-
ter human assessors by how consistently they rate
translations of known distinct quality.

A degraded version of a given original system
output translation is automatically generated by
substituting a sequence of words with a random
phrase, itself selected from elsewhere in the refer-
ence document. Together with the original out-
put, the degraded translation is known as a bad
reference translation pair. Bad reference pairs
are subsequently hidden within HITs, and provide
a mechanism for filtering out workers who are
simply not up to the task or those attempting to
game the system. Assessments of workers who do
not reliably score bad reference translations sig-
nificantly lower than corresponding genuine sys-
tem output translations are filtered out by com-
parison of scores they attribute to bad reference
pairs within HITs. More specifically, we apply a
paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test to score distri-
butions of bad reference pairs, yielding a p-value
for each worker we subsequently employ as a re-
liability estimate. Assessments of workers whose
p-value lies above the conventional 0.05 threshold
are omitted from the evaluation of systems.

Table 8 shows the number of unique workers
who evaluated MT output on Mechanical Turk via
DA for WMT16 for both fluency and adequacy,

ing a significantly lower score for bad reference
items, and the proportion of those workers who si-
multaneously showed no significant difference be-
tween scores they attributed in repeat assessment
of an identical previous translation.

In order to iron out differences in scoring strate-
gies of distinct workers, human assessment scores
for translations are standardized according to each
individual worker’s overall mean and standard de-
viation score. Subsequently, the overall score of a
given MT system participating in the shared task
simply comprises the mean (standardized) score of
its translations.

Table 9 includes mean DA fluency and ade-
quacy scores for all to-English systems participat-
ing in WMT16 translation task, while Table 10
includes results for the single out-of-English lan-
guage pair for which DA was run this year, English
to Russian. Mean standardized scores for systems
not significantly lower than that of any other par-
ticipating system, according to Wilcoxon signed-
rank test, for a given language pair, are highlighted
in bold. Although we also evaluated the fluency of

translations, mean standardized adequacy scores
should provide the primary mechanism for rank-
ing competing systems, since it is entirely possible
to achieve a high fluency score without conveying
the meaning of the source input. Fluency can be
employed as a secondary mechanism to break sys-
tems tied for adequacy or for diagnostic purposes.
Figures 7, 8 and 9 show results of combining sig-
nificance test conclusions for DA adequacy and
fluency, where any ties between systems tied for
adequacy are broken if that system outperformed
the other with respect to fluency. It should be
noted that RR provide official task results, while
DA results are investigatory and do not indicate
official translation task winners.

Finally, we compare scores of the official rank-
ing to mean standardized adequacy scores for sys-
tems evaluated with DA. Table 11 shows the Pear-
son correlation between Trueskill scores for sys-
tems evaluated by researchers with relative pref-
erence judgments (official results) and DA mean
scores collected via crowd-sourcing, showing high
levels of agreement reached overall for all lan-
guage pairs as correlations range from 0.92 to
0.997.

4 IT Translation Task

The IT-domain translation task introduced this
year brought several novelties to WMT:

• 4 out of the 7 languages of the IT task are
new in WMT (Bulgarian, Basque, Dutch and
Portuguese),

• adaptation to the IT domain with its specifics
such as frequent named entities (mostly menu
items, names of products and companies) and
technical jargon,

• adaptation to translation of answers in help-
desk service setting (many of the sentences
are instructions with imperative verbs, which
is very rare in the News translation task and
may require adaptation of the whole transla-
tion pipeline, including e.g. part-of-speech
taggers).

4.1 Data
The test set consisted of 1000 answers from
the Batch 3 of the QTLeap Corpus.10 The
in-domain training data contained 2000 answers
from the Batches 1 and 2 and also localization
files from several open-source projects (LibreOf-
fice, KDE, VLC) and bilingual dictionaries of IT-
related terms extracted from Wikipedia. The out-
of-domain training data contained all the corpora
from the News Task (see Figure 1), plus PaCo2-
EuEn Basque-English corpus and SETimes with
Bulgarian-English parallel sentences.

“Constrained” systems were restricted to use
only these training data provided by the organiz-
ers. Linguistic tools such as morphological ana-
lyzers, taggers, parsers, word-sense disambigua-
tion or named entity recognizer were allowed in
the constrained condition. The split of Batches 1
and 2 into the training set and development test set
was left to the participants.

4.2 Submitted systems
31 systems were submitted in total for the 7 lan-
guage pairs.

PROMT LLC company and they are not described
in any paper.

QTL-MOSES is the standard Moses setup
(MERT-tuned on the in-domain training data, but
otherwise without any domain-adaptation) and
serves as a baseline.

4.3 Human evaluation

The main results are presented in Table 12. The
PROMT-* systems won all three language pairs,
for which they were submitted, but they were
trained using additional training data not avail-
able to other participants, so they are considered
unconstrained and not comparable to the con-
strained systems. In all language pairs except for
English→Bulgarian, the baseline (QTL-MOSES)
was outperformed by all other systems.

Table 13 reports the amount of pairwise com-
parisons collected and inter- and intra-annotator
agreement of the human evaluation, which is in a
similar range as in the News task (cf. Tables 4 and
5).

5 Biomedical Translation Task

This is the first time that we have run the Biomed-
ical Translation task at WMT. This task aims to
evaluate systems for the translation of biomedical
titles and abstracts from scientific publications. In
this first edition of the challenge, we have focused
on three language pairs (considering both trans-
lation directions), namely, English/Portuguese
(EN/PT), English/Spanish (EN/ES) and En-
glish/French (EN/FR), and documents in the two
sub-domains of biological sciences and health sci-
ences.

for each document in the test set. Details on the
data, baseline system, automatic evaluation and
manual validation are described below.

Data

We provided the participants with training data of
parallel documents for the three language pairs as
well as monolingual documents for each of the
four languages, as summarized in Table 14. We
did not provide any development data and the par-
ticipants were free to split the training data into a
training and a development datasets.

The training data consisted mainly of the Sci-
elo corpus (Neves et al., 2016), a parallel collec-
tion of scientific publications composed of either
titles, abstracts or title and abstracts which were
retrieved from the Scielo database. For the Sci-
elo corpus, we compiled parallel documents for
all language pairs in the two sub-domains, except
for the EN/FR, where only health was considered,
as there were inadequate parallel documents avail-
able for biology in that pair. In previous work
(Neves et al., 2016), the training data was aligned
using the GMA alignment tool. The quality of
the alignment was found to be satisfactory so that
aligned training data could be made available to
the participants.

The test set consisted of 500 documents (title
and abstract) for each of the two directions of each
language pair, i.e., English to Portuguese (en-pt),
Portuguese to English (pt-en), English to Span-
ish (en-es), Spanish to English (es-en), English to
French (en-fr) and French to English (fr-en). None
of the test documents was included in the training
data and there is no overlap of documents between
the test sets for any language pair, translation di-
rection and sub-domain.

Additionally, we prepared a corpus of paral-
lel titles from MEDLINE R© for all three language
pairs. Finally, we also provided monolingual
documents for the four languages, i.e., English,
French, Spanish and Portuguese, retrieved from
the Scielo database. These consist of documents
in the Scielo database which have no correspond-
ing document in another language.

Evaluation metric

We computed the BLEU score for each of the runs
in comparison to the reference translation, i.e., the
original text made available in the Scielo database,
as provided by the authors of the publications.

Baseline
Our baseline system was described in previous
work (Neves et al., 2016). It consists of the statisti-
cal MT system Moses 11 trained on both the Scielo
corpus and on the parallel collection of Medline
titles. We did not make use of the monolingual
collection as we did not train a language model.

Manual validation
We carried out a manual evaluation for 100 ran-
dom sentences for some selected pairs in the test
data. We used the 3-way ranking task in the Ap-
praise tool 12 which typically shows the source and
the reference translation, and allows the pairwise
comparison of two translations (A and B).

However, to distance the manual evaluation
from the automatic BLEU evaluation which com-
pares automatic runs to the reference translation,
we treated the reference translation as one of the
systems and therefore suppressed the reference
translation in the interface. Evaluators were only
presented with the source sentence, and two trans-
lations to rank. Evaluators were blind to the nature
of the sentences they were evaluating: automatic
system A vs. system B, reference translation vs.
system, or system vs. reference translation.

When comparing two translations in the 3-way
ranking task in Appraise, evaluators were pre-
sented with four options: (1) A>B, translation A
is better than translation B; (2) A=B, the quality of
the two candidate translations is similar; (3) A<B,
translation B is better than translation A; and (4)
Flag Error, to indicate that one of the translations
did not seem to refer to the same source sentence
or there is some other misalignment. The lat-
ter situation could happen when the original sen-
tence pairs were not perfectly aligned. This may
be due to the fact that the reference translations
are created by the article authors independently of
the WMT challenge goals. These authors are not
professional writers or professional translators, so
that some of the content may only be present in
one of the languages, i.e., not every sentence in
one language has a directly corresponding sen-
tence in the other language. Thus, when selecting
the corresponding sentences in the reference trans-
lation, we do it based on the automatic alignment
provided by the GMA tool, which performs with
at least 80% accuracy for our training data (Neves

Regarding assigning the second option, i.e.,

A=B, we considered situations in which both
translations were equally bad or good. In some
cases, both candidate translations exhibited either
lexical or grammatical issues, but the evaluator
could not rank one candidate as definitely better or
worse than the other. Sometimes, both candidates
were correct and were acceptable translations of
the source sentence, even if not identical. Cur-
rently, this distinction is not captured in the statis-
tics computed by Appraise.

5.2 Participants

Five teams participated in the Biomedical Trans-
lation task, submitting a total of 40 runs. Partici-
pants are listed in Table 15; a short description of
their systems is provided below.

Istrionbox The Istrionbox team utilized a non-
log-linear model based on a weighted average of
the translation and language models. They aligned
the training documents on the phrase level using

an aligner based on a lexicon which contains more
than 930,000 terms derived from many parallel
corpora for English/Portuguese. The language
model was based on phrases, instead of words, as
well as the translation model. For the various runs
that the team submitted, they experimented with
assigning equal or different weights for the distinct
models trained on the biological or the health cor-
pora, and they also considered a bilingual lexicon
and named entities.

IXA The IXA team adapted a general-domain
statistical machine translation system to the
biomedical domain. Three approaches were de-
veloped for English-Spanish and Spanish-English
language pairs, using Moses and three corpora
(News corpora, Scielo Health and Scielo Biolog-
ical, both the bilingual and monolingual docu-
ments). In the system used for the first submission,
the medical vocabulary SNOMED-CT is used to
extend the vocabulary to address the problem of
out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. In the system
used for the second submission, OOV words are

addressed by expanding generated phase tables
with morphological variants and transliterations of
the remaining words. In the system used for the
third submission, the IXA team used the test set
provided by the organizers to optimize the method
used in the second submission.

TALP The TALP team’s system is a standard
phrase-based system based on Moses and MERT
and enhanced with vocabulary expansion using
bilingual word embeddings and a character-based
neural language model with rescoring. The former
focuses on resolving out-of-vocabulary words,
while the latter enhances the fluency of the sys-
tem.

LIMSI-TLP The LIMSI-TLP system is a
MOSES-based statistical machine translation sys-
tem, rescored with Structured Output Layer neu-
ral network models. It relied on additional in-
domain data, including data from the WMT’14
medical translation task (English-French) and a set
of English-French Cochrane systematic review ab-
stracts. They also experiment with a confusion
network system combination which combines the
outputs of Phrase Based SMT systems trained ei-
ther to translate entire source sentences or spe-
cific syntactic constructs extracted from those sen-
tences. The approach is implemented using Con-
fusion Network decoding.

uedin The University of Edinburgh team used
the phrase-based statistical model from Moses in-
cluding hierarchical lexicalized reordering model
with four orientations in both directions. The
translation model was trained on data from the
WMT13, the Scielo training data as well as the
EMEA corpus. The language model was based
on the interpolation of various language models
trained separately on monoligual English corpora,
such as the WMT14 medical, Scielo, EMEA and
English LDC GigaWord corpus.

5.3 Results

The five participating teams submitted a total of
40 runs. However, only the Spanish–English and
English–Spanish language pairs attracted submis-
sions from more than one team. In addition, one
language pair (fr-en) did not receive any submis-
sion. Table 16 presents the BLEU score for each
run as well as for our baseline system.

All runs obtained a much higher BLEU score
than the baseline system, except for the en-pt and
pt-en submissions, with BLEU scores just slightly
superior to the baseline. The LIMSI run showed
the best improvement over the baseline (246% ab-
solute improvement, from 9.24 to 22.75). Overall,
however, the BLEU scores for all language pairs
remain quite moderate. Regarding comparison of
the various runs and teams for each language pair,
we did not observe considerable differences be-
tween them, except for the the runs of the ”uedin”
system, which obtained around two BLEU points
more than other runs.

We rank the systems as follows according to
their BLEU scores, with B=biology and H=health,
and bl=baseline:

• en-pt(B): Istrionbox>bl;

• en-pt(H): Istrionbox>bl;

• pt-en(B): Istrionbox>bl;

Table 16: Official BLEU scores for the WMT16 Biomedical Translation task.

For the pairwise manual validation of sentences,
and given the high number of runs for some lan-
guage pairs, e.g., Spanish–English and English–
Spanish, we did not perform a pairwise evaluation
for every pair of two systems. Instead, we consid-
ered only one run from each participant for each
language pair and dataset: the one that achieved
the best BLEU score in the automatic evaluation.
An exception was made for the English–French
and English-Portuguese tasks for which we had
only one participating team: we considered all
combinations of runs and reference translations
for English–French and combinations of the refer-
ence translation and both the run with best BLEU
score and the one that the participant (Istrionbox)
reported as their best run. The results of the man-
ual validation are presented in Table 17.

Only one run (IXA run 3, English–Spanish,
health dataset) was comparable to the reference
translation: 30 vs. 26 for A>B and A<B, respec-

tively. For all other cases, the reference translation
was assigned to be better than the other translation
at least twice as many times.

Regarding comparison between teams and
runs, i.e., ES2PT (biological and health) and
English–French, we did not observe much differ-
ence when comparing distinct runs of the same
team. When comparing runs from distinct teams,
IXA clearly outperformed TALP in two compar-
isons: Spanish–English biological (57 vs. 24) and
Spanish–English health (48 vs. 22). On the other
hand, TALP slightly outperformed IXA in one
dataset: English–Spanish biological (16 vs. 7). Fi-
nally, the uedin system was clearly superior to
TALP in the Spanish–English biological dataset
(60 vs. 20) and to both TALP and IXA in the
Spanish–English health dataset (54 vs. 19 and 41
vs. 15, respectively).

We rank the systems as follows according to our
manual validation (ref=reference):

5.4 Discussion
In this section we analyze the errors we observed
in the translations submitted by teams, the lessons
we learned in this first edition of the task and our
plans for future work.

Error analysis. During our manual analysis of a
sample of the translations that were submitted for
the test data, we noticed that their quality is still
poor in comparison to the reference translations.
We identified numerous problems, as summarized
below:

• many missing words or words in the source
language mixed in with the target language,
probably due to words or concepts in the
source language that could not be translated
to the target language;

• incorrect ordering of adjectives and nouns,
given that, in contrast to English, nouns typi-
cally precede adjectives in Portuguese, Span-
ish and French;

• incorrect agreement of nouns, verbs and ad-
jectives with respect to gender and number;

• incorrect punctuation, e.g., periods placed in
the middle of a sentence;

• incorrect casing for words, e.g., common
words which were capitalized or in upper
case;

• missing translations for acronyms, i.e., the
acronym in the source language was used in-
stead.

We note that some of these issues were ignored
during the manual evaluation, for instance, incor-
rect capitalization was not penalized if the trans-
lation was otherwise better or comparable to the
other translation.

157



Lessons learned. We performed a comparison
of the systems based only on the overall results
on the complete test set and on the samples of sets
that we randomly selected for manual validation.
For this first edition of the Biomedical Translation
task, we aimed at providing an evaluation platform
for the automatic translation of scientific publica-
tions, in particular for titles and abstracts in the
biomedical domain.

In this first edition of the task, the training and
test data was obtained from the parallel publica-
tions available in Scielo. We did not perform
manual translation of the documents for either the
training or the test data, but rather used the origi-
nal text available in Scielo for all languages under
consideration here. In practice, this means that the
reference translations were produced by the arti-
cle authors independently of the WMT challenge
goals. These authors are not professional writers
or professional translators, and some of them may
have limited proficiency in the languages they are
required to use for publication. This situation has
an impact on the quality of the reference trans-
lations, compared to other WMT tasks. It is re-
flected in the manual evaluation which indicates
that for some language pairs (notably English–
Spanish health), participant runs were rated over-
all as better or equal to the reference translation.
Our experience with this first edition of the task
indicates that the Scielo corpus is a valuable re-
source for biomedical WMT, however more work
is needed in terms of quality assurance to ensure
that meaningful evaluation results can be obtained.

Plan for future editions. In next editions, we
plan to build on the established pipeline to collect
and pre-process Scielo data to prepare a new test
dataset. More importantly, we plan to work to-
wards improved data and evaluation quality.

While we initially focused on characterizing
the quality of the alignment in the parallel Scielo
corpus, we are planning to craft a higher quality
dataset by removing any sentence pairs with align-
ment issues. Furthermore, the data set will also be
pruned for sentences exhibiting lexical, grammati-
cal or fluency issues. These steps will contribute to
improve the significance of the evaluation results,
especially in terms of BLEU scores.

Furthermore, we believe that the nature of sci-
entific texts and biomedical texts in particular calls
for specific evaluation metrics. One of the in-
tended uses of translation systems in the biomedi-

cal domain is to provide health professionals with
access to the latest research results that are pub-
lished in a language other than their native lan-
guage. Consequently, health professionals may
use the translated information to make clinical
decisions impacting patients care. It is vital
that translation systems do not contribute to the
dissemination of incorrect clinical information.
Therefore, the evaluation of biomedical translation
systems should include an assessment at the doc-
ument level indicating whether a translation con-
veyed erroneous clinical information.

6 Quality Estimation

The fifth edition of the WMT shared task on
quality estimation (QE) of machine translation
(MT) builds on the previous editions of the task
(Callison-Burch et al., 2012; Bojar et al., 2013,
2014, 2015), with “traditional” tasks at sentence
and word levels, a new task for entire documents
quality prediction, and a variant of the word-level
task: phrase-level estimation.

The goals of this year’s shared task were:

• To advance work on sentence and word-
level quality estimation by providing domain-
specific, larger and professionally annotated
datasets.

• To analyse the effectiveness of different types
of quality labels provided by humans for
longer texts in document-level prediction.

• To investigate quality estimation at a new
level of granularity: phrases.

These goals are addressed through three groups
of tasks: Task 1 at sentence level (Section 6.3),
Task 2 at word and phrase levels (Section 6.4),
and Task 3 at document level (Section 6.6). Tasks
1 and 2 provide the same dataset with English-
German translations generated by a statistical ma-
chine translation (SMT) system, while Task 3 pro-
vides an English-Spanish dataset of translations
taken from all participating systems in WMT08-
WMT13. These datasets were annotated with
different labels for quality: for Tasks 1 and 2,
the labels were automatically derived from the
post-editing of the machine translation output,
while for Task 3, scores were computed based
on a two-stage post-editing process. Any exter-
nal resource, including additional quality estima-
tion training data, could be used by participants

158



(no distinction between constrained and uncon-
strained tracks was made). As presented in Sec-
tion 6.1, participants were also provided with a
baseline set of features for each task, and a soft-
ware package to extract these and other quality
estimation features and perform model learning,
with suggested methods for all levels of predic-
tion. Participants, described in Section 6.2, could
submit up to two systems for each task.

Data used to build MT systems or internal sys-
tem information (such as model scores or n-best
lists) were made available on request for Tasks 1
and 2.

6.1 Baseline systems
Sentence-level baseline system: For Task 1,
QuEst++13 (Specia et al., 2015) was used to ex-
tract 17 features from the SMT source/target lan-
guage training corpus:

• Number of tokens in source & target sen-
tences.

• Average source token length.

• Average number of occurrences of the target
word within the target sentence.

• Number of punctuation marks in source and
target sentences.

• Language model probability of source and
target sentences based on models built from
the SMT training corpus.

• Average number of translations per source
word in the sentence as given by IBM Model
1 extracted from the SMT training corpus.

• Percentage of unigrams, bigrams and tri-
grams in frequency quartiles 1 (lower fre-
quency words) and 4 (higher frequency
words) in the source language extracted from
the source SMT training corpus.

• Percentage of unigrams in the source sen-
tence seen in the source SMT training corpus.

These features were used to train a Support
Vector Regression (SVR) algorithm using a Ra-
dial Basis Function (RBF) kernel within the
scikit-learn toolkit (Pedregosa et al., 2011).14

13https://github.com/ghpaetzold/
questplusplus

14http://scikit-learn.org/

The γ, � and C parameters were optimised via grid
search with 5-fold cross validation on the training
set.

Word-level baseline system: For Tasks 2 and
2p, the baseline features were extracted with the
Marmot tool (Logacheva et al., 2016b).

For the baseline system we used a number of
features that have been found the most informa-
tive in previous research on word-level QE. Our
baseline set of features is loosely based on the one
described in (Luong et al., 2014). It contains the
following 22 features:

• Word count in the source and target sen-
tences, source and target token count ratio.
Although these features are sentence-level
(i.e. their values will be the same for all
words in a sentence), the length of a sentence
might influence the probability of a word be-
ing wrong.

• Target token, its left and right contexts of one
word.

• Source word aligned to the target token, its
left and right contexts of one word. The
alignments were taken from the SMT system
that produced the automatic translations.

• Binary dictionary features: whether target to-
ken is a stopword, a punctuation mark, a
proper noun, a number.

• Target language model features:
– The order of the highest order ngram

which starts and end with the target to-
ken.

– Backoff behaviour of the ngrams
(ti−2, ti−1, ti), (ti−1, ti, ti+1),
(ti, ti+1, ti+2), where ti is the tar-
get token (the backoff behaviour was
computed as described in (Raybaud
et al., 2011)).

• The order of the highest order ngram which
starts and ends with the source token.

• The Part-of-speech tags of the target and
source tokens.

This set of baseline features is similar to the
one used at WMT15 QE shared task (Bojar et al.,
2015). We excluded three features used the last

159



year: pseudo-reference features and number of
WordNet senses for the source and target tokens.

We model the task as a sequence prediction
problem, and train our baseline system using the
Linear-Chain Conditional Random Fields (CRF)
algorithm with the CRFSuite tool (Okazaki,
2007). The model was trained using the passive-
aggressive optimisation algorithm.

Phrase-level baseline system: The phrase-level
features were also extracted with Marmot, but they
are different from the word-level features. The
baseline set of phrase-level features is based on a
list of features which were used for sentence-level
QE in QuEst++ toolkit. These so-called “black-
box” features do not use the internal information
from the MT system. We use the following fea-
ture set consisting of 72 features, using the SMT
source/target language training corpus:

• Source phrase frequency features:
– average frequency of ngrams (unigrams,

bigrams, trigrams) from different quar-
tiles of frequency (from the low fre-
quency to high frequency ngrams);

– percentage of distinct source ngrams
(unigrams, bigrams, trigrams) seen in a
corpus of the source language.

• Translation probability features:
– average number of translations per

source word in the sentence (with dif-
ferent translation probability thresholds:
0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5);

– average number of translations per
source word in the sentence (with dif-
ferent translation probability thresholds:
0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5) weighted by
the frequency of each word in the source
corpus.

• Punctuation features:
– difference between numbers of various

punctuation marks (periods, commas,
colons, semicolons, question and excla-
mation marks) in the source and the tar-
get phrases;

– difference between numbers of various
punctuation marks normalised by the
length of the target phrase;

– percentage of punctuation marks in the
target and the source.

• Language model features:
– log probability of the source and the tar-

get phrases;
– perplexity of the source and the target

phrases.

• Phrase statistics:
– lengths of the source and target phrases;
– ratio of the source and the target phrase

lengths;
– average length of tokens in source and

target phrases;
– average occurrence of target word

within the phrase.

• Alignment features:
– Number of unaligned target words;
– Number of target words aligned to more

than one word;
– Average number of alignments per word

in the target phrase.

• Part-of-speech features:
– percentage of content words in the

source and target phrases;
– percentage of words of a particular part-

of-speech (verb, noun, pronoun) in the
source and the target phrases;

– ratio of numbers of words of a particular
part-of-speech (verb, noun, pronoun) in
the source and the target phrases;

– percentage of numbers and alphanu-
meric tokens in the source and the target
phrases;

– ratio of the percentage of numbers and
alphanumeric tokens in the source and
the target phrases;

This feature set was originally designed for sen-
tences. We expect that since phrases are sequences
of words of varied length, they can be treated
analogously for QE. However, unlike sentences,
which are translated independently, phrases are re-
lated to their neighbouring phrases in a sentence,
and in this respect they are similar to words in
the context of QE. Therefore, as in the baseline
word-level system, we treat phrase-level QE as a
sequence labelling task and model it using Con-
ditional Random Fields. The phrase-level base-
line system is trained with CRFSuite using the
passive-aggressive optimisation algorithm.

160



Document-level baseline system: For Task 3,
17 baseline features equivalent to those for sen-
tence level were extracted at document level us-
ing QuEst++. These features are aggregations of
sentence-level baseline features. Some sentence-
level features were summed (number of tokens
in the source and target sentences and number of
punctuation marks in source and target sentences),
while all remaining were averaged.

The model was trained with a SVR algorithm
with RBF kernel using the scikit-learn toolkit.
The γ, � and C parameters were optimised via grid
search with 5-fold cross validation on the training
set.

6.2 Participants
Table 18 lists all participating teams submitting
systems to any of the tasks. Each team was al-
lowed up to two submissions for each task. In the
descriptions below, participation in specific tasks
is denoted by a task identifier.

CDACM (Task 2): The CDACM team partici-
pated in Task 2 for the word and phrase-level QE.
They use a Recurrent Neural Network Language
Model (RNN-LM) architecture for word-level QE.
To estimate the phrase-level quality, they use the
output of the word-level QE system. For this task,
they use a modified RNN-LM with other RNN
variants like Long Short Term Memory (LSTM),
deep LSTM and Gated Recurring Units (GRU).
The modified system predicts a label (OK/BAD)
rather than predicting the word as in the case of
standard RNN-LM. The input to the system is a
word sequence, similar to the standard RNN-LM.
They also tried bilingual models with RNN-LM
and found that they perform better than monolin-
gual models. In the training data, the distribu-
tion of labels (OK/BAD) is skewed, with signifi-
cantly more OK labels. To handle this issue, they
use strategies to replace the OK label with sub-
labels to balance the distribution. The sub-labels
are OK B, OK I, OK E, depending on the loca-
tion of the token in the sentence.

POSTECH (Task 1, Task 2): POSTECH’s sub-
missions (SENT/RNN for Task 1, WORD/RNN
for Task 2 and PHR/RNN for Task 2p) are RNN-
based QE systems consisting of two component:
two bidirectional RNNs on the source and tar-
get sentences in the first component and other
RNNs for predicting the final quality in the sec-
ond component. The first component is an RNN-

based modified neural MT model which gener-
ates quality vectors. Quality vectors indicate a
sequence of vectors about target words’ transla-
tion quality. The second component using other
RNNs predicts the quality at sentence level (Task
1), word level (Task 2), and phrase level (Task 2p).
POSTECH’s RNN-based systems are entirely neu-
ral approaches for QE. Due to the small amount of
data to train the prediction models, each compo-
nent of the systems is trained separately by using
different training data. To train the first component
of the systems, the Europarl v7 English-German
parallel corpus was used. To train the second com-
ponent of the systems, WMT16 QE task English-
German datasets were used.

RTM (Task 1, Task 2, Task 3): Referential trans-
lation machines (RTMs) (Biçici and Way, 2015)
are a language-independent approach for predict-
ing translation quality, as well as for addressing
other text similarity tasks. They eliminate the need
to access any task or domain specific information
or resource. SVR and regression trees are used
in combination with feature selection and partial
least squares for the document and sentence-level
prediction tasks and global linear models with dy-
namic learning were used for the word and phrase-
level prediction tasks.

SHEF (Task 1): The SHEF systems exploit
RNNs and the principle of compositionality to of-
fer a resource-light solution to sentence-level QE.
They use only one side of the translation, the
source (SRC) or the target (TGT). They split the
sentence in ngrams and train a model that pre-
dicts the quality of ngrams. To calculate the qual-
ity of an entire sentence translation, they split its
source/target side in ngrams, estimate their qual-
ity individually, then average their quality scores.
They use word embedding models trained over 7
billion words as external resource (English and
German) using word2vec.

SHEF-LIUM (Task 1): The two joint sub-
missions from the University of Sheffield and
LIUM use (i) a Continuous Space Language
Model (CSLM) to extract sentence embeddings
and cross-entropy scores, (ii) a neural network
MT (NMT) model, (iii) a set of QuEst++ fea-
tures (iv) a combination of features produced by
QuEst++ and the features produced with CSLM
and NMT. When added to QuEst++ standard fea-
ture sets for Task 1, the CSLM sentence embed-

ding features along with the cross entropy and
NMT likelihood led to large improvements in pre-
diction, and achieved third place in the scoring and
second place in the ranking task variants according
to the official evaluation metrics. Neural network
features alone also performed very well. This is a
very encouraging finding since for many language
pairs it is sometime hard to find appropriate re-
sources to build hand-crafted features, while the
neural network features used only require (suffi-
cient) monolingual data to train models, which is
available in abundance for many languages.

SHEF-MIME (Task 2): The University of
Sheffield’s submission to the word-level QE task
is based on imitation learning, an approach that
treats structured prediction as a sequence of ac-
tions taken by a binary classifier. This approach
allows the use of arbitrary information from pre-
vious tag predictions and has the ability to train
the classifier using non-decomposable loss func-
tions over the predicted structure. The submitted
system uses the baseline features provided by the
shared task organisers plus additional features re-
lying on the predicted structure, such as previous
tag ngrams and the total number of BAD predic-
tions. It employs an online learning algorithm as
the underlying classifier and uses a loss function
based on the official shared task evaluation metric.
No external data or resources were used for this

submission.

UALacant (Task 2): The submissions of the
Universitat d’Alacant team focus for Task 2 were
obtained by applying the approach by Esplà-
Gomis et al. (2015), which uses any source of
bilingual information available online in order to
spot sub-segment correspondences between the
source segment and the translation hypothesis.
These sub-segment correspondences are used to
extract a collection of features that are then used
by a multilayer perceptron to determine the fi-
nal word-level QE labels. The probabilities pro-
vided by this classifier for every word in a phrase
are then used as new features for a second multi-
layer perceptron that is able to obtain quality esti-
mates at the phrase level. Three sources of bilin-
gual information available online were used by the
UAlacant submissions: two online MT systems,
Lucy LT KWIK15 and Google Translate,16 and
the bilingual concordancer Reverso Context.17

Two systems were submitted, both for word-level
and phrase-level QE tasks: one using only features
based on external sources of bilingual information,
and another combining them with the baseline fea-
tures provided by the task organisers.

UFAL (Task 1): The submission is based on
word alignments and bilingual distributed repre-
sentations to introduce a new set of features for the
sentence-Level QE task. The features extracted in-
clude three alignment-based features, three bilin-
gual embedding-based features, two embedding-
based features constrained on alignment links, as
well as a set of 74 bigrams used as boolean fea-
tures. The set of bigrams represents the most fre-
quent bigrams in translations that have changed
after the post-edition, and they are compiled by
aligning translations to their post-editions pro-
vided in the WMT QE datasets. To produce
these features, GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) was
used for word alignment and Multivec (Berard
et al., 2016) was used for the bilingual model,
which jointly learns distributed representations for
source and target languages using a parallel cor-
pus. To build the bilingual model, domain-specific
data compiled from the resources made available
for the WMT 16 IT-Domain shared task was used.
As prediction model, a Linear Regression model
using scikit-learn was built using a combina-
tion of QuEst++ baseline features and the new fea-
tures proposed.

UGENT-LT3 (Task 1, Task 2): The submissions
for the word-level task use 41 features in com-
bination with the baseline feature set to train bi-
nary classifiers. The 41 additional features at-
tempt to capture accuracy errors (concerned with
the meaning transfer from the source to target sen-
tences) using word and phrase alignment proba-
bilities, fluency errors (concerned with the well-
formedness of target sentence) using language
models trained on word surface forms and on
part-of-speech tags, and terminology errors (con-
cerned with the domain-specific terminology) us-
ing a bilingual terminology list. Based on the com-
bined feature set, SCATE-RF uses random forests
for binary classification, which combines deci-
sion trees into an ensemble. SCATE-ENS uses
the same feature set and combines different algo-
rithms into an ensemble by applying the major-
ity voting scheme. For the sentence-level task,
SCATE-SVM1 adds 18 features to the baseline
feature set to train SVR models using an RBF ker-
nel. SCATE-SVM2 additionally utilises an extra
feature, which is based on the percentage of words
that are labelled as BAD by the best word-level QE
system (SCATE RF). External language resources
from the IT domain are used to extract the addi-

tional features for both tasks.

UNBABEL (Task 2): Two systems were
submitted for the word-level task. UNBA-
BEL 2 linear is a feature-based linear sequen-
tial model. It uses the baseline features pro-
vided by the shared task organisers (with slight
changes) conjoined with individual labels and
pairs of consecutive labels. It also uses vari-
ous syntactic dependency-based features (depen-
dency relations, heads, and second-order struc-
tures like siblings and grandparents). The syntac-
tic dependencies are predicted with TurboParser
trained on the TIGER German treebank. UN-
BABEL 2 ensemble uses a stacked architecture,
inspired by the last year’s QUETCH+ system
(Kreutzer et al., 2015), which combines three
neural systems: one feedforward and two re-
current ones. The predictions of these sys-
tems are added as additional features in the lin-
ear system above. The following external re-
sources were used: part-of-speech tags and extra
syntactic dependency information obtained with
TurboTagger and TurboParser (Martins et al.,
2013), trained on the Penn Treebank (for English)
and on the version of the German TIGER corpus
used in the SPMRL shared task (Seddah et al.,
2014) for German. For the neural models, pre-
trained word embeddings from Polyglot (Al-
Rfou et al., 2013) and those produced with a neural
MT system (Bahdanau et al., 2014) were used.

USFD (Task 2): USFD’s submissions tested two
different approaches for phrase-level QE. The first
one (CONTEXT submission) is an enhancement
of the baseline feature set provided with the con-
text features. The additional features consist of the
source and target tokens which precede and fol-
low the phrase under consideration, part-of-speech
tags of these tokens, and language model scores
for ngrams at the borders of the phrase. The
second approach (W&SLP4PT submission) learns
phrase-level labels from predictions at other lev-
els. The models are trained on a set of seven fea-
tures that are based on (i) the phrase segmentation
itself (length and ratio to the sentence), (ii) word-
level predictions (number of predicted OK/BAD
words in the current phrase and in the sentence),
and (iii) the predicted quality of the sentence.
CRFsuite is used to train the prediction models
in both cases.

163



USHEF (Task 3): Two different systems were
submitted for Task 3. The first system (BASE-
EMB-GP) combines the 17 baseline features with
word embeddings from the source documents (En-
glish) using a Gaussian Process (GP) model. The
word embeddings were learned by using the Con-
tinuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) model (Mikolov
et al., 2013), trained on the Google’s billion-word
corpus,18 with a vocabulary size of 527K words.
Document embeddings are extracted by averaging
word embeddings in the document. The GP model
was trained with two Rational Quadratic kernels
(Rasmussen and Williams, 2006): one for the 17
baseline features and another for the 500 features
from the embeddings. Since each kernel has its
own set of hyperparameters, the full model can
leverage the contributions from the two different
sets. The second system (GRAPH-DISC) com-
bines the baseline features with discourse-aware
features. The discourse aware features are the
same as the ones used by Scarton et al. (2015a)
plus Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) cohesion
features (Scarton and Specia, 2014), number of
subtrees and height of the Rhetorical Structure
Theory (RST) tree and entity graph-based coher-
ence scores (Sim Smith et al., 2016). Discourse-
aware and RST tree features were extracted only
for English (tools are only available for this lan-
guage), LSA features were extracted for both lan-
guages, and entity graph-based coherence scores
were extracted for the target language only (Span-
ish), as the source documents are expected to be
coherent. This QE model was trained with an SVR
algorithm.

UU (Task 1): The UU system uses SVR to pre-
dict HTER scores based on features extracted with
QuEst++ plus additional features. The feature
vector consists of a combination of the 17 base-
line features and top performing new features pro-
posed by UU. These new features are related to re-
ordering and noun translation, grammatical corre-
spondence and structural integrity, based on parse
trees and part-of-speech tags. The system submit-
ted uses Kendall Tau distances in alignments be-
tween source and target for measuring reordering,
noun group ratio, verb ratio and probabilistic con-
text free grammars probabilities.

1-billion-word-language-modeling-benchmark

YSDA (Task 1): The YSDA submission is based
on a simple idea that the more complex the sen-
tence is the more difficult it is to translate. For this
purpose, it uses information provided by syntac-
tic parsing (information from parsing trees, some
specific language constructions, etc). Addition-
ally, it uses features based on pseudo-references,
back-translation, web-scale language model, word
alignments (as given by the data for Task 2),
and combinations of several features. A regres-
sion model was training to predict BLEU as tar-
get metric instead HTER. The machine learning
pipeline uses an SVR with RBF kernel to pre-
dict BLEU scores, followed by a linear SVR to
predict HTER scores from BLEU scores. As
external resources, the system uses a syntac-
tic parser, pseudo-references and back-translation
from web-scale MT system, and a web-scale lan-
guage model.

6.3 Task 1: Predicting sentence-level quality

This task consists in scoring (and ranking) transla-
tion sentences according to the percentage of their
words that need to be fixed. HTER (Snover et al.,
2006) is used as quality score, i.e. the minimum
edit distance between the machine translation and
its manually post-edited version in [0,1].

As in previous years, two variants of the results
could be submitted:

• Scoring: An absolute HTER score for each
sentence translation, to be interpreted as an
error metric: lower scores mean better trans-
lations.

• Ranking: A ranking of sentence translations
for all source sentences from best to worst.
For this variant, it does not matter how the
ranking is produced (from HTER predictions
or by other means). The reference ranking is
defined based on the true HTER scores.

Data The data is the same as that used for the
WMT16 Automatic Post-editing task, collected
By the QT21 Project19 in the Information Technol-
ogy (IT) domain.20 Source segments are English
sentences and target segments are German trans-
lations produced by a strong SMT system built
within the QT21 Project. The human post-editions

19http://www.qt21.eu/
20The source sentences and reference translations were

provided by TAUS (https://www.taus.net/) and come
from a unique IT vendor.

164



are a manual revision of the target, done by profes-
sional translators using the PET post-editing tool
(Aziz et al., 2012). HTER labels were computed
using the TERCOM tool21 with default settings (to-
kenised, case insensitive, exact matching only),
and scores capped to 1.

As training and development data, we provided
English-German datasets with 12,000 and 1,000
source sentences, their machine translations, post-
editions and HTER scores. As test data, we pro-
vided an additional set of 2,000 English-German
source-translations pairs produced by the same
SMT system used for the training data.

Evaluation Evaluation was performed against
the true HTER label and/or ranking, using the fol-
lowing metrics:

• Scoring: Pearson’s r correlation score (pri-
mary metric, official score for ranking sub-
missions), Mean Average Error (MAE) and
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

• Ranking: Spearman’s ρ rank correlation and
DeltaAvg.

Statistical significance on Pearson r and Spear-
man rho was computed using the William’s test,
following the approach suggested in (Graham,
2015).

Results Table 19 summarises the results for
Task 1, ranking participating systems best to worst
using Pearson’s r correlation as primary key.
Spearman’s ρ correlation scores should be used to
rank systems according to the ranking variant. We
note that three systems have not submitted results
ranking evaluation variant.

6.4 Task 2: Predicting word-level quality
The goal of this task is to evaluate the extent to
which we can detect word-level errors in MT out-
put. Various classes of errors can be found in
translations, but for this task we consider all error
types together, aiming at making a binary distinc-
tion between OK and BAD tokens. The decision to
bucket all error types together was made because
of the lack of sufficient training data that could al-
low consideration of more fine-grained error tags.

Data This year’s word-level task uses the same
dataset as Task 1, for a single language pair:
English-German. Each instance of the training,

21http://www.cs.umd.edu/˜snover/tercom/

development and test sets consists of the follow-
ing elements:

• Source sentence (English).
• Automatic translation (German).
• Manual post-edition of the automatic transla-

tion.

• Word-level binary (OK/BAD) labelling of the
automatic translation.

The binary labels for the datasets were acquired
automatically with the TERCOM tool. The tool iden-
tifies four types of errors: substitution of a word
with another word, deletion of a word (word was
omitted by the translation system), insertion of a
word (a spurious word was added by the transla-
tion system), and word or sequence of words shift
(word order error). Every word in the machine-
translated sentence is tagged with one of these er-
ror types or not tagged if it matches a word from
the reference.

All the untagged (correct) words were tagged
with OK, while the words tagged with substitution
and insertion errors were assigned the tag BAD.
The deletion errors are not associated with any
word in the automatic translation, so we could not
consider them. We also disabled the shift errors by
running TERCOMwith the option ‘-d 0’. The reason
for that is the fact that searching for shifts intro-
duces significant noise in the annotation. The tool
cannot discriminate between cases where a word
was really shifted and where a word (especially
common words such as prepositions, articles and
pronouns) was deleted in one part of the sentence
and then independently inserted in another part of
this sentence, i.e. to correct an unrelated error. The
statistics of the datasets are outlined in Table 20.

Evaluation This year’s evaluation procedure is
different from the one used in previous QE tasks.
Previously, the submissions were evaluated in
terms of F1-score for the BAD class. However,
this metric was criticised for being biased towards
“pessimistic” labellings. It tends to rate higher the
outputs of systems which labelled most of words
as BAD, e.g. a trivial “all-BAD” baseline out-
performs many real systems in terms of F1-BAD
score (Bojar et al., 2013).

Therefore, this year we used a different metric:
the multiplication of F1-scores of the BAD and
OK classes (herein referred to as F1-mult). As it

was shown in (Logacheva et al., 2016c), this met-
ric is not biased neither towards “pessimistic” nor
to “optimistic” labellings, and is good at discrimi-
nating between different systems.

We tested the significance of the results using
randomisation tests (Yeh, 2000) with Bonferroni
correction (Abdi, 2007).

Results The results for Task 2 are summarised in
Table 21. We show the performance of all partici-
pating systems as well as the baseline model. The
results are ordered by the F1-mult metric. The top
three submissions are statistically significantly dif-
ferent from any other system. However, we cannot
unambiguously depict other significance groups in
the table. Therefore, we only show the systems
which are not significantly different from the base-
line (grey area). The models above and below the
grey area are significantly better and worse than
the baseline system, respectively.

In order to show and analyse the groups of
significantly different systems we plot the results
of significance test as a heatmap (see Table 22).
Here, a cell at the crossing of a row and a col-
umn corresponding to different submissions con-
tains the information about the significance of the
difference in their results: the darker the cell is,
the lower is the significance in the difference for

the pair of systems. The coloured frames denote
groups of submissions which are not significantly
different.

We should also note that in order to adequately
evaluate the significance for multiple experiments
we used Bonferroni correction. The essence of
this method is that in cases when multiple results
are compared (i.e. multiple comparisons are per-
formed) the final significance level is computed
as the initial significance level over the number of
comparisons. In our case we had 91 comparisons
which gave us αB = α91 = 0.0005 for the sig-
nificance level of 0.05. Bonferroni correction is
quite a conservative method, so the number of sig-
nificance groups may vary when using a different
correction technique.

Overall, there are 10 groups of significantly
different results: three of them contain one sub-
mission (the three best-performing models), other
seven contain two to five models each (these are
the groups denoted by frames of different colours).

6.5 Task 2p: predicting phrase-level quality

As an extension of the word-level task, we intro-
duced a new task: phrase-level prediction. For this
task, given a “phrase” (segmentation as given by
the SMT decoder), participants are asked to label it
as ‘OK’ or ‘BAD’. Errors made by MT engines are
interdependent and one incorrectly chosen word
can cause more errors, especially in its local con-
text. Phrases as produced by SMT decoders can be
seen as a representation of this local context and
in this task we ask participants to consider them as
atomic units, using phrase-specific information to

improve upon the results of the word-level task.

Data The data to be used is exactly the same as
for Task 1 and the word-level task. The labelling
of this data was adapted from word-level labelling
by assigning the ‘BAD’ tag to any phrase that con-
tains at least one ‘BAD’ word. The phrase seg-
mentation used in this dataset is the original seg-
mentation of sentences produced by the SMT de-
coder during translation.

The dataset statistics are outlined in Table 23
(this is similar to Table 20, but shows the percent-
age of incorrect phrases instead of words).

Evaluation Although the QE was produced at
the level of phrases, we used word-level metrics
to evaluate the performance of participating sys-
tems. This choice was motivated by the fact that
the length of phrases can vary significantly, and
an incorrectly labelled phrase can actually mean 1
to 5 incorrectly labelled words, while phrase-level
metrics do not weigh incorrect labels by the length
of the phrases. We decided to use word-level eval-
uation to make the results of this task more intu-
itive. We used the same metric as the one used
in task 2: multiplication of word-level F1-OK and
word-level F1-BAD (F1-mult). However, the test
set was re-labelled in order to agree with phrase
boundaries: if a phrase had at least one BAD word,
all its labels were replaced with BAD.

Thus, the sequence
OK ‖ BAD OK OK ‖ OK ‖ BAD OK ‖ OK OK
was converted to:
OK ‖ BAD BAD BAD ‖ OK ‖ BAD BAD ‖ OK OK
As in Task 2, statistical significance was com-

puted using randomisation tests with Bonferroni
correction.

Results The results of the phrase-level task are
represented in Table 24. Here, unlike the word-
level task, we cannot find a single winner: al-
though the F1-mult scores of the top five systems
vary from 0.379 to 0.364, this difference is not
significant. However, all the winning submissions
outperform the baseline.

Analogously to the previous task, we provide
the F1-BAD and F1-OK scores in order to bet-
ter understand the differences between the models.
We can see that some models have very close F1-
mult scores, although their per class components
scores can differ. For example, the F1-mult scores
of two submissions by the USFD team are very
close (0.367 and 0.364). However, if we decom-
pose these scores, we will see that both F1-BAD
and F1-OK scores of the two models have around
2% of absolute difference: the W&SLP4PT model
is more “pessimistic” (i.e. it is better at labelling
BAD words), while the CONTEXT model identi-
fies the correct words more accurately. However,
the combinations of these scores lead to very sim-
ilar F1-mult. The situation is the same with all
top five submissions: the differences in F1-BAD
are levelled off by the F1-OK component, and the
values of the F1-mult are closer than those of F1-
BAD.

This suggests that the F1-mult score might not
be an best metric for the phrase-level task. While
in the phrase-level models phrases of different
length are treated in the same way, the word-level
metric unfolds each phrase-level label to a set of

word-level labels, thus giving different importance
to phrases of different lengths. In order to find a
more suitable metric we tested another evaluation
strategy. We evaluated the submissions in terms
of phrase-level F1-scores: here all phrases were
considered as uniform atomic units regardless of
their lengths, and F1-BAD and F1-OK were com-
puted as harmonic means of precision and recall
for phrase-level of OK and BAD labels.

Table 25 shows the performance of phrase-level
QE models measured in terms of multiplication of
phrase-level F1-scores. Except for some changes
in the order of models, this ranking is very similar
to the official one represented in Table 24. Here,
the order of submissions by the POSTECH and
CDACM teams is different from the ranking pro-
duced with the primary metric, but they are still
not significantly different. On the other hand, the
USFD team models are no longer best-performing
under the phrase-level F1-score. This evaluation
shows that phrase-level F1-mult is slightly better
at discriminating between models, although they
are still considered too close and no single best-
performing approach can be identified.

6.6 Task 3: Predicting document-level quality

The document-level QE task consists in scoring
and ranking documents according to their pre-
dicted quality. Knowing the quality of entire doc-
uments is useful for scenarios where fully auto-
mated approaches are used. An example is gisting,
mainly if the user of the system does not know the
source language. Another example are scenarios
where post-editing is not an option or cannot be
performed for the entire data.

Different from last year’s task, in this second
edition we use entire documents and a document-
oriented quality score. The quality scores are
achieved by a two-stage post-editing method
(Scarton et al., 2015b), with post-editing done by
professional translators. In the first stage, sen-
tences are shuffled and post-edited without context
(PE1). In the second stage, the post-edited sen-
tences (from the first stage) are put together in the
document context and post-edited again (PE2) by

the same translator. This approach aims to isolate
problems that can only be solved with document-
level information.

Although the annotation task is considerably
simple to perform, generating reliable quality la-
bels from the data is not a trivial task. Aver-
age (AVG) and Standard Deviation (STDEV) of
HTER between PE1 and MT (PE1 ×MT ), PE2
and MT (PE2 ×MT ) and PE2 and PE1 (PE2 ×
PE1) are presented in Table 26.22

As shown in Table 26, PE1 ×MT and PE2 ×
MT show low variation. As discussed last year
(Bojar et al., 2015), we hypothesise that the low
variation in the scores means that quality labels
are not not able to distinguish documents reliably.
PE2×PE1 values, on the other hand, show a high
variation, indicating that the documents vary more
when only document-wide errors are considered.
However, taking only PE2 × PE1 as quality la-
bel is not ideal as it disregards problems at word
and sentence levels, which certainly also influence
the quality of the document as whole. Our solu-
tion is to combine the scores such as to maintain
a high enough variation in the data, while consid-
ering all issue levels. More specifically, we use a
linear combination of PE1×MT and PE2×PE1
(Equation 1).

f = w1 · PE1 ×MT + w2 · PE2 × PE1, (1)

where w1 and w2 are empirically defined weights.
w1 was fixed to 1, while w2 was optimised aim-
ing at finding how much relevance we should give
to each component in order to meet two crite-
ria. First, the final label (f ) should lead to sig-
nificant data variation (in terms of standard devi-
ation on the mean). Second, the difference be-
tween the MAE of the mean baseline23 and the
MAE of the official baseline QE system should be
large enough.24 The quality labels were defined
by Equation 1 with w1 = 1 and w2 = 13.

22HTER was calculated by using the Asiya toolkit im-
plementation of TER (non-tokenised and case insensitive)
(Giménez and Màrquez, 2010).

23This baseline is calculated by assuming the mean of the
training set as the predicted value of all instances in the test
set.

24In our experiments, for variance we defined that the ratio
between the standard deviation and mean should be at least
0.5 and for MAE difference, we defined it to be at least 0.1.
w2 was increased by 1 at each iteration and the optimisation
process stopped when any of the requirements was met.

Data The documents were extracted from the
WMT translation task test data from 2008 to 2013,
using submissions from all participating MT sys-
tems. Source documents were randomly chosen.
For each source document, a translation was taken
from a different MT system. We considered EN-
ES as language pair, extracting 208 documents.
All documents were post-edited as previously ex-
plained. 146 documents were used for training and
62 for test.

Evaluation The evaluation of the document-
level task was the same as that for the sentence-
level task. Pearson’s r, MAE and RMSE are re-
ported as evaluation metrics for the scoring task,
with Pearson’s r as official metric for the ranking
of systems. For the ranking task, Spearman’s ρ
correlation and DeltaAvg are reported, with Spear-
man’s rho as main metric. The significance of the
results is evaluated by applying the Williams test

on Pearson’s r scores.

Results The results of both the scoring and rank-
ing variants of the task are given in Table 27,
sorted from best to worst by using the Pearson’s
r scores as primary key. USHEF/BASE-EMB-
GP and RTM/RTM-FS+PLS-TREE showed the
best scores, with no significant difference between
them. The other two systems are not statistically
significantly different from the baseline.

The two winning submissions are very differ-
ent. The BASE-EMB-GP system combines word
embeddings with the official baseline features in a
GP model with two-kernels, while RTM-FS+PLS-
TREE is an RTM implementation that explores
more sophisticated features from the source and
target texts. For ranking variant, however, RTM-
FS+PLS-TREE showed better results. Moreover,
this is the only system with higher scores than the
baseline that is also significantly better than the
baseline.

previously identified for it.

Domain specific, professionally done
post-editions
Last year we used the largest dataset of all editions
of the shared task to date (for sentence and phrase-
level QE): ∼14K segment pairs altogether. How-
ever, the findings were somewhat inconclusive as
the quality of the dataset was dubious (crowd-
sourced post-editions). This year we were able
to collect a dataset of comparable size (15K) but
in a completely controlled way, and with profes-
sional (paid) translators to ensure the quality of
the data. Another critical difference in this year’s
main dataset is its domain: IT, as opposed to the
rather general, “news” domain that had been used
so far. Finally, we had access to the SMT sys-
tem that produced the translations, which was very
important for the new task introduced this year –
phrase-level QE. For phrase-level QE, the segmen-
tation of the sentences in phrases was necessary.
Having a more repetitive text domain was deemed
particularly relevant for the word and phrase-level
tasks, where data sparsity is a major issue.

In practice, we found that this year’s main
dataset is similar to last year’s in terms of error
distribution at the word-level: about 20% of the
words are labelled as BAD. One thing to notice,
however, is that with the new data systems did not
seem to benefit from filtering data out. Last year,
various systems reported improvements from fil-
tering out significant portions of the “all/mostly
GOOD” sentences, which could have meant that
these sentences may not have been correct, but did
not get post-edited by the crowdworkers.

In terms of progress with respect to last year for
comparable tasks, although direct comparisons are
not possible, we observed that:

• For sentence-level, the Pearson correlation of
the winning submission last year was 0.39

(against 0.14 of the baseline system). This
year, the winning submission reached 0.52
Pearson correlation, with many other systems
above 0.4 (against 0.35 of the same baseline
system as last year). One can speculate that
the task was made somewhat “easier” by us-
ing high quality data, but the delta in Pearson
correlation between the baseline and winning
submission is still very substantial.

• For word-level, the main metric used this
year (F1-mult) is different from the one used
last year (F1-BAD), and this may have been
the metric most systems optimised against, so
looking at the F1-BAD results for both years
is not entirely fair to this year’s systems, but
nevertheless this year’s systems performed
much better: 0.56 against 0.43 last year. The
baseline system used last year was much sim-
pler, and therefore comparisons against the
baseline cannot be made.

Effectiveness of new quality label provided by
humans for document-level prediction
Participation in the document-level task was again
disappointingly low, with only four systems.
Document-level QE is still a relative new area and
engaging the community is therefore still a chal-
lenge.

The main changes in this year’s task were the
fact that entire documents are used (potentially re-
sulting in the need for more discourse/document-
wide features), and the the fact that the quality la-
bels are computed based on human post-editing.
We start by analysing the new quality label against
automatic metrics (such as BLEU) used in previ-
ous work. Our hypothesis is that automatic met-
rics are not reliable labels for document-level eval-
uation (as discussed in (Scarton et al., 2015b)).
Therefore, we expect that our new label would per-
form differently from these metrics. We use cor-

171



relation to measure whether or not the new label
shows different behaviour. Table 28 shows Pear-
son r correlation scores for automatic metrics ver-
sus the new label, as well as between HTER and
all labels. The HTER score was calculated consid-
ering the last version of the two-stage post-editing
method (PE2 ×MT ).

NEW (↓) BLEU(↑) TER(↓) METEOR(↑)
BLEU −0.168 - - -
TER +0.195 −0.928 - -
METEOR −0.186 +0.954 −0.961 -
HTER(↓) +0.516 −0.462 +0.449 −0.452

Table 28: Pearson r correlation between automatic metrics,
our new label (NEW) and HTER. All correlation scores are
significant with 95% of confidence.

Although the new label showed some corre-
lation to BLEU, TER and METEOR, the best
correlation is showed with HTER. On the other
hand, the automatic metrics showed higher cor-
relation among themselves than against HTER
scores, which is expected since such metrics are
similar in many ways.

An important observation is that the automatic
metrics are calculated against a human translation
and HTER is calculated against a post-edited ver-
sion. The effect of this is that BLEU, TER and
METEOR compare the MT output to a human
translation that can be completely different from
the MT output, without necessarily meaning that
the machine translation is bad. HTER, conversely,
compares the MT output to its post-edited version.

It is also worth noticing that although HTER did
not show a high variation (0.091 for mean 0.381 -
third column of Table 26), similar to the automatic
metrics, it still did not show very high correla-
tion with BLEU, TER and METEOR. Conversely,
the new label showed high correlation with HTER,
but much lower correlation with BLEU, TER and
METEOR than HTER itself. This seems to indi-
cate that the new label captures different informa-
tion than BLEU, TER and METEOR. Therefore,
we believe that the new label and standard evalu-
ation metrics provide complementary information
on translation quality.

In terms of features, most are similar to
those used by the systems submitted last year,
which are aggregations of sentence-level fea-
ture values. Therefore, our hypothesis that
discourse/document-aware features would show
better results on evaluating full document was not
proved. Systems using discourse-aware features
(USHEF/GRAPH-DISC) did not show improve-

ments relative to the baseline system. This could
be an indication of the limitations of the features
or of the labels themselves.

QE at the phrase level
One of the main motivations for switching from
the word level to phrase level is the fact that MT
errors are often context-dependent, and the wrong
choice of a word might be explained by an error
in its context. A good example of such errors are
adjectives that take the gender of the noun they
depend on, and become erroneous if this noun is
replaced with another noun of a different gender.

This motivation suggests that the phrases to be
used as atomic units in a phrase-level QE sys-
tem should be syntactically motivated. However,
there can be other approaches. For example, the
very popular SMT systems manipulate sequences
of words as opposed to single words. These se-
quences – referred to as “phrases” – are not lin-
guistically motivated phrases. During decoding
these phrases are selected or rejected as atomic
units (regardless of the quality of the individual
words they consist of), and thus it may be useful
to estimate the quality of the entire phrase.

Overall, there is no single answer to what
should be considered as a “phrase” in a phrase-
level QE system. A fully-fledged phrase-level QE
system should be able to handle both the segmen-
tation of a sentence into phrases and the labelling
of each phrase for quality. However, each of these
two steps is a complex problem on itself. There-
fore, for the first edition of the task we decided to
simplify it and provide the phrase segmentation.
Following Logacheva et al. (2015), we considered
a “phrase” the final segmentation produced by the
SMT decoder by an MT decoder that generated
the automatic translations in the dataset. This seg-
mentation is useful for decoding-time QE.

The baseline phrase-level QE system uses a
set of features which were originally designed
for sentences and later adapted for smaller se-
quences. These features were used to train a CRF
model. Participants chose many different tech-
niques to model the task. The best performing
ones are deep neural networks: the Recurrent Neu-
ral Network from the POSTECH team which pre-
dicts the phrase-level label and the CDACM Re-
current Neural Network whose word-level predic-
tions were successfully applied to the phrase-level
task. Two of the submitted models make use of
the baseline feature set: the USFD team enhanced

172



it with context information, while the UAlacante
team combined it with features based on pseudo-
reference translations coming from a number of
sources.

Several teams attempted to take into account
the predictions for other the task at other levels.
The phrase-level submission from CDACM sim-
ply labels the phrase-level test set using word-
level predictions; while the UAlacant submission
uses the probability of each word in a phrase be-
ing labelled as BAD along with other external fea-
tures. Similarly, USFD uses information on word
labels within a phrase as well as the information
on sentence-level quality.

Comparison of word-level and phrase-level
models The word-level and phrase-level sys-
tems that participated in Tasks 2 and 2p are not di-
rectly comparable. Although they are evaluated on
the same test sentences, and the labels for the test
set come from the same post-editions, they are not
identical. The labels for the phrase-level test set
were modified in order to comply with the phrase-
level training data. We established a pessimistic
approache where a phrase is considered BAD if
any of its words is BAD. We changed the word-
level labels so that all labels within a BAD phrase
are also BAD. This is analogous to replacing some
OK labels with BAD labels for words.

Nevertheless, we can still try to compare the
word-level and phrase-level submissions if we
change the word-level submissions appropriately.
Let us consider that a word-level QE model was
used to label phrases for quality. Following the
rules mentioned above we will label a phrase as
BAD if our QE model labelled any of words of
this phrase as BAD. After performing this trans-
formation we can use the Task 2p test set to eval-
uate both phrase-level and (modified) word-level
submissions.

While this comparison is an approximation as
the submitted word-level models were not trained
to predict the quality of phrases, it still al-
lows a rough comparison between word-level and
phrase-level QE models. One of the purposes
of the phrase-level task was to understand if the
subsentence-level QE can benefit from joint la-
belling of groups of words, and this cross-task
comparison is a means to try to answer that ques-
tion.

Table 29 contains the joint results of Tasks 2 and
2p. The best-performing system is the winning

word-level submission. Moreover, the word-level
systems tend to perform better in this task in gen-
eral: the top seven positions in this joint table are
occupied by the word-level systems. Some of the
phrase-level systems which performed well turn
out not to be better than the word-level baseline
system. Presumably, this result means that defin-
ing the quality for individual words yields better
results in general.

Another observation we can make from this ta-
ble is the change in the significance level of the re-
sults: some of the word-level submissions which
were significantly different from the word-level
baseline model in the original (word-level) task
are no longer different in the phrase-level version.
This can shed some light on the difficulties we had
with defining the single best phrase-level system:
perhaps the lack of significance in the differences
between the labellings is derived from the phrase-
level task itself. Alternatively, as it was discussed
in Section 6.5, it could be explained by the fact that
F1-mult score is not a suitable metric for phrase-
level QE.

In order to examine how the phrase-level task
relates to the word-level one more closely we per-
formed a different comparison. Some of the teams
presented their results for both variants of Task 2,
and the majority of them have similar models for
both levels: they tried to adapt their original word-
level system for the phrase-level task. We can
compare these pairs of systems to see if the adap-
tation was successful. This is not a direct compar-
ison, because the models, although similar, can-
not be identical due to differences between words
and phrases. This comparison was only done for
analysis, as it can give us more insights on the fu-
ture perspectives for the phrase-level task. Table
30 outlines the results of this comparison.25

Here, in order to enable the direct comparison,
we adapted the word-level systems to phrase-level
test set the same way as we did for Table 29. It can
be clearly seen that the performance of word-level
systems is better than that of the analogous phrase-
level systems. There are multiple possible reasons
for that, for example, wrong choice of phrase-level
features, limitations of models originally designed
for word-level QE in dealing effectively with word

25The submission by the CDACM team was not included
in the table because their phrase-level submission is an adap-
tation of word-level predictions to phrase level. It was per-
formed analogously to our word-level submissions adapta-
tion, therefore it should be no different.

sequences.
Nevertheless, it is worth noticing the phrase-

level QE systems introduced a number of inter-
esting strategies that allowed them to outperform
a strong baseline phrase-level model. Finally, we
recall that the evaluation metric – word-level F1-
mult – has difficulties to distinguish phrase-level
systems. This suggests that we may need to find a
different metric for evaluation of the phrase-level
task, with phrase-level F1-mult one of the candi-
dates.

7 Automatic Post-editing Task

This year WMT hosted the second round of the
shared task on MT automatic post-editing (APE),
which consists in automatically correcting the er-
rors present in a machine translated text. As

pointed out by Chatterjee et al. (2015b), from the
application point of view the task is motivated by
its possible uses to:

• Improve MT output by exploiting informa-
tion unavailable to the decoder, or by per-
forming deeper text analysis that is too ex-
pensive at the decoding stage;

• Cope with systematic errors of an MT system
whose decoding process is not accessible;

• Provide professional translators with im-
proved MT output quality to reduce (human)
post-editing effort;

• Adapt the output of a general-purpose MT
system to the lexicon/style requested in a spe-
cific application domain.

174



Also this year, the general framework consisted
in a “black box” scenario in which the MT sys-
tem that produced the translations is unknown to
the participants and cannot be modified. How-
ever, building on the lessons learned in the first pi-
lot round (Bojar et al., 2015), some changes have
been made.

The major differences concern the domain and
the origin of the data. First, we moved from
the general news domain to the more specific
information technology (IT) domain. This
novelty is motivated by the difficulties observed in
the pilot round, in which the baseline (the simple
do-nothing APE system that leaves all the test sen-
tences unmodified) remained unbeaten. Indeed,
the scarce repetitiveness of the news domain pre-
vented participants to learn from the training data
effective correction patterns that are also applica-
ble to the test set. Second, concerning the ori-
gin of the data, we moved from post-edits ob-
tained from non-professional crowdsourced work-
force to material collected from professional trans-
lators. Data collected from trained professionals
represents first of all a more standard scenario for
the translation industry. Besides this, they are con-
sidered to guarantee higher translation coherence,
feature higher repetitiveness and, eventually, make
the APE task more feasible by automatic systems.

Other changes concern the language combina-
tion and the evaluation mode. As regards the
languages, we moved from English-Spanish to
English-German, which is one of the language
pairs covered by the QT21 Project26 that sup-
ported data collection and post-editing. Con-
cerning the evaluation, we changed from TER
scores computed both in case-sensitive and case-
insensitive mode to a single ranking based on case
sensitive measurements.

Besides these changes the new round of the
APE task included some extensions in the evalu-
ation. BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) has been in-
troduced as a secondary evaluation metric to mea-
sure the improvements over the rough MT output.
In addition, to gain further insights on final output
quality, a subset of the outputs of the submitted
systems has also been manually evaluated.

Based on these changes and extensions, the
goals of this year’s shared task were to: i) im-
prove and stabilize the evaluation framework in
view of future rounds, ii) analyze the effect on task

26http://www.qt21.eu/

feasibility of data coming from a narrow domain,
iii) analyze the effect of post-edits collected from
professional translators, iv) analyze how humans
perceive TER/BLEU performance differences be-
tween different systems, v) measure the progress
made during one year of research on the APE task.

Although the changes made with respect to the
first pilot round prevent from fair and informa-
tive result comparisons, we believe that these ob-
jectives were successfully achieved. Most notice-
ably, the higher feasibility of the task brought by
domain-specific data and professional post-edits
resulted in significant baseline improvements (up
to 3.2 TER and 5.5 BLEU points), which are also
evident to human evaluation. These positive re-
sults, together with the increase in the number of
participants with respect to the pilot round (from
four to six), represent a good starting point for fu-
ture rounds of the APE task.

7.1 Task description

Similar to last year, participants were provided
with training and development data consisting of
(source, target, human post-edit) triplets, and were
asked to return automatic post-edits for a test set of
unseen (source, target) pairs.

7.1.1 Data
One of the findings of the first pilot task was that
the origin and the domain of the data pose specific
challenges to the participating systems. In particu-
lar, our analysis highlighted the strong dependence
of system results on data repetitiveness, which
tends to be higher within restricted domains and
with coherent post-edits. On one side, restricted
domains are more likely to feature smaller vocabu-
laries and to be more repetitive (or, in other terms,
less sparse). This situation, in turn, will likely de-
termine a higher applicability of the learned error
correction patterns. On the other side, coherent
post-edits (like those produced within controlled
professional environments) will result in a lower
variability in the correction of specific errors and,
in turn, in favorable conditions to learn and gather
reliable statistics. These considerations motivate
some of the major changes of this year’s round
of the APE task, namely those concerning the do-
main (a specific one as opposed to news) and the
origin of the post-edits (from professional transla-
tors instead of crowdsourced).

The data used this year was released by the
QT21 Project. This material was obtained by

175



randomly sampling from a collection of English-
German (source, target, human post-edit) triplets
drawn from the Information Technology (IT)
domain.27 Also this year, the main reason for ran-
dom sampling was to induce a higher data homo-
geneity and, in turn, to increase the chances that
correction patterns learned from the training set
can be applied also to the test set. The down-
side of losing information yielded by text coher-
ence (an aspect that some APE systems might take
into consideration) has hence been accepted in ex-
change for a higher error repetitiveness across the
three data sets.

The training and development sets respectively
consist of 12, 000 and 1, 000 instances. In each
instance:

• The source (SRC) is a tokenized English sen-
tence whose length ranges between 3 and 30
tokens;

• The target (TGT) is a tokenized German
translation of the source. Translations were
obtained with a statistical MT system.28 This
information, however, was unknown to par-
ticipants, for which the MT system was a
black-box.

• The human post-edit (PE) is a manually-
revised version of the target, done by profes-
sional translators.29

Test data (2, 000 instances) consists of (source,
target) pairs having similar characteristics of those
in the training set. Human post-edits of the test
target instances were left apart to measure system
performance.

Table 31 provides some basic statistics about
the data. As discussed in Section 7.3, the differ-
ences in the domain and the origin of this year’s
data can contribute to explain the large improve-
ments over the baseline, which in the first pilot
round unfortunately remained unbeaten. These
differences are highlighted by the Repetition Rate

27The source sentences (together with their reference
translations which were not used for the task) were provided
by TAUS (https://www.taus.net/) and originally come
from a unique IT vendor.

28It consists of a phrase-based machine translation system
leveraging generic and in-domain parallel training data and
using a pre-reordering technique (Herrmann et al., 2013). It
takes also advantages of POS and word class-based language
models.

(RR30) scores reported in Table 32. Values are in-
deed very close to those observed in the IT-related
corpus (the Autodesk Post-Editing Data corpus31)
that was used last year as a term of comparison to
motivate the high difficulty of dealing with news
data.

7.1.2 Evaluation metric

System performance was evaluated by computing
the distance between automatic and human post-
edits of the machine-translated sentences present
in the test set (i.e. for each of the 2, 000 target
test sentences). Differently from the first edition of
the task, in which this distance was only measured
in terms of Translation Error Rate (TER) (Snover
et al., 2006), this year the BLEU (Papineni et al.,
2002) score was also used. TER is an evalua-
tion metric commonly used in MT-related tasks
(e.g. in quality estimation) to measure the mini-
mum edit distance between an automatic transla-
tion and a reference translation.32 BLEU is the
reference metric for MT evaluation and is based
on modified n-gram precision to find how many of
the n-grams in the candidate translation are present
in the reference translation over the entire test set.
The main difference between the two metrics is
that TER works at word level, while BLEU takes
advantage of words and n-grams with n from 2 to
4. Systems were ranked based on the average TER
calculated on the test set by using the TERcom33

software: lower average TER scores correspond
to higher ranks. BLEU was computed using the
multi-bleu.perl package34 available in MOSES.

Differently from the pilot round, in which TER
was computed both in case-sensitive and case-
insensitive mode, this year we opted for only one
mode. Working with German, for which case er-
rors are of crucial importance, participants’ sub-
missions were evaluated with the more strict case-
sensitive mode.

30Repetition rate measures the repetitiveness inside a text
by looking at the rate of non-singleton n-gram types (n=1...4)
and combining them using the geometric mean. Larger value
means more repetitions in the text.

31https://autodesk.app.box.com/
Autodesk-PostEditing

32Edit distance is calculated as the number of edits (word
insertions, deletions, substitutions, and shifts) divided by the
number of words in the reference. Lower TER values indicate
lower distance from the reference as a proxy for higher MT
quality.

7.1.3 Baseline
The official baseline results are the TER and
BLEU scores calculated by comparing the raw MT
output with the human post-edits. In practice, the
baseline APE system is a system that leaves all the
test targets unmodified.35 Baseline results are re-
ported in Table 34.

Monolingual translation as another term of
comparison. To get some insights about the
progress with respect to the first pilot task, partic-
ipating systems were also evaluated against a re-
implementation of the approach firstly proposed
by Simard et al. (2007).36 Last year, in fact, this
statistical post-editing approach represented the
common backbone of all submissions (this is also
reflected by the close results achieved by partici-
pants in the pilot task). For this purpose, a phrase-
based SMT system based on Moses (Koehn et al.,
2007) was used. Translation and reordering mod-
els were estimated following the Moses protocol
with default setup using MGIZA++ (Gao and Vo-
gel, 2008) for word alignment. For language mod-
eling we used the KenLM toolkit (Heafield, 2011)
for standard n-gram modeling with an n-gram
length of 5. Finally, the APE system was tuned on

35In the case of TER, the baseline is computed by averag-
ing the distances between each machine-translated sentence
and its human-revised version. The actual evaluation metric
is the human-targeted TER (HTER). For the sake of clarity,
since TER and HTER compute edit distance in the same way
(the only difference is in the origin of the correct sentence
used for comparison), henceforth we will use TER to refer to
both metrics.

36This is done based on the description provided
in (Simard et al., 2007). Our re-implementation, however,
is not meant to officially represent such approach. Discrep-
ancies with the actual method are indeed possible due to our
misinterpretation or to wrong guesses about details that are
missing in the paper.

the development set, optimizing TER/BLEU with
Minimum Error Rate Training (Och, 2003). The
results of this additional term of comparison are
also reported in Table 34.

For each submitted run, the statistical signifi-
cance of performance differences with respect to
the baselines and the re-implementation of Simard
et al. (2007) was calculated with the bootstrap
test (Koehn, 2004).

7.2 Participants
This year, six teams (two more than in the pilot
round) participated in the APE task by submitting
a total of eleven runs. Participants are listed in
Table 33; a short description of their systems is
provided in the following.

Adam Mickiewicz University. This system is
among the very first ones exploring the appli-
cation of neural translation models to the APE
task. In particular, it investigates the following
aspects: i) the use of artificially-created post-
edited data to train the neural models, ii) the log-
linear combination of monolingual and bilingual
models in an ensemble-like manner, iii) the ad-
dition of task-specific features in the log-linear
model to control the final output quality. Con-
cerning the data, in addition to the official train-
ing and development material, the system exploits
the English-German bilingual training material re-
leased for the IT-domain and news translation
shared tasks. The German monolingual common
crawl corpus admissible for these two tasks is also
exploited. This data is used by a “round-trip trans-
lation” approach aimed to artificially create the
huge amount of triples needed to train the neu-
ral models. Such models are attentional encoder-
decoder models (Bahdanau et al., 2014) trained
with subword units (Sennrich et al., 2015) in or-
der to deal with the limited ability of neural trans-
lation models to handle out-of-vocabulary words.
They include both monolingual models trained to
translate from TGT to PE, and cross-lingual mod-
els trained to translate from SRC to PE. An en-
semble is obtained through their log-linear combi-
nation with empirically-set weights (higher for the

based on string matching is added to the log-linear
combination to control the faithfulness of the APE
results with regard to the input. This is done by
penalizing words in the output that do not appear
in the input to be corrected.

Univerzita Karlova v Praze. Also this system
is based on the neural translation model with atten-
tion proposed by Bahdanau et al. (2014) and ex-
tends it to include multiple encoders able to man-
age different input representations. Each encoder
is a bidirectional RNN that takes in input a one-
hot vector for each representation of a word. The
decoder is an RNN which receives an embedding
of the previously produced word as an input in ev-
ery time step together with the hidden state from
the previous time step. The RNNs output is then
used to compute the attention and the next word
distribution. The attention is computed over each
of the encoders separately. The initial state of the
decoder is obtained by a weighted combination of
the encoders final states. To improve the capability
of the network to focus on the edits made by the
post-editors, the target sentence is converted in the
minimum-length sequence of edit operations per-
formed on the machine-translated sentence. For
this purpose, the network vocabulary is extended
adding two more tokens (keep and delete) and the
new representation is made of a sequence of keep,
delete and insert operations, where the insert op-
eration is defined by placing the word itself. The
different inputs used for the APE task submission
are the source sentence and its translation into the
target language and the sequence of edits. The
network is trained using only the task data. To
better handle the complexity of the German target
language, different language-dependent pre- and
post-processing are used, in particular, splitting
the contracted prepositions and articles and sep-
arating some pronouns from their case ending.

Dublin City University. This system is de-
signed as an automatic rule learning system. It
considers four types of editings, i.e. replace-
ment, deletion, insertion and reordering, as gener-
alized replacement (GR) editings. GR editings are
learned from aligning words in source and target
sentences and records replacement pairs and their
corresponding contexts for each source and target
sentence pair. When the source word is empty,
it is of an insertion editing; similarly, when the
target word is empty, it is of a deletion editing.
When the source words and target words in a GR
editing both comprise the same set of words but
with different orderings, it is of a reordering edit-
ing. The word-based GR editings and their gener-
alization which uses POSs to replace their context
words, comprise the whole rule set of GR editings.
There is no linguistic knowledge incorporated in
the system, which therefore can be applied to any
language for post-editing purposes. Three things
are learned from the training set, 1) the GR rules,
2) the precedence ordering of these rules, and 3)
the maximum number of rules to be applied to
a sentence. For each set of GR rules, the prece-
dence ordering can be ranked based on the counts
of replacement words, the counts of their context
words, the lengths of GR editings, the number
of occurrences of GR editings observed in train-
ing set and/or their combinations. In the training
phase, given a set of GR rules, the system will ap-
ply the rules to the training set using different set-
tings of precedence ordering and maximum num-
ber of rules to be applied for each sentence. The
system is trained when one setting is selected if
the system yields the best overall post-edited re-
sults by applying that setting. In the test phase,
the GR rules will be applied to each sentence in
the test set using the trained precedence ordering
and stop when the maximum number of rules to be
applied is met for that sentence.

Fondazione Bruno Kessler. This system com-
bines the monolingual statistical approaches pre-
viously exploited in Chatterjee et al. (2015a) with
a factored machine translation model that is able to
leverage benefits from both. One is the monolin-
gual statistical translation approach proposed by
Simard et al. (2007). The other is the context-
aware variant proposed by Béchara et al. (2011).
The former is more robust and it better general-
izes the learned post-editing rules. The latter is
prone to data sparsity, word alignment and tun-
ing problems due to its richer representation of
the terms. Nevertheless, by integrating knowl-
edge about the source context in the learned rules,
its precision is a good complement to the higher
recall of (Simard et al., 2007). By enabling a
straightforward integration of additional annota-
tion (factors) at the word-level, factored transla-
tion models (Koehn and Hoang, 2007) are used
to leverage such complementarity. In the FBK
system they include part-of-speech-tag and class-
based neural language models (LM) along with
statistical word-based LM to improve the fluency
of the post-edits. These models are built upon
a data augmentation technique (i.e. the exten-
sion of the monolingual parallel corpus with the
post-edits available in the training data), which
helps to mitigate the problem of over-correction
in phrase-based APE systems. One of the submit-
ted runs incorporates a quality estimation model
(C. de Souza et al., 2013, 2014), which aims to
select the best translation between the MT output
and the automatic post-edit.

Jadavpur University & Saarland University.
This system contains three basic components: sta-
tistical APE, word deletion model and word sur-
face form correction model. The final generated
translation is the product of a multi-engine re-
ranking system. The statistical APE component
is based on the phrase-based APE approach of Pal
et al. (2015). MT outputs generally contain four
types of errors: presence of unwarranted words,
wrong word surface form, absence of some rele-
vant words, and wrong word order. The system
tries to address the first two types of errors. The
word deletion model is based on source language
context modelling and target language word dele-
tion frequency in the training data. The surface
form correction model tries to fix the morphologi-
cal errors by generating all possible surface forms
for each root word present in the MT output and

to select the most likely sequence of word sur-
face forms by applying a language model. The
word deletion model and the word surface form
correction model are applied to all the APE out-
puts. Finally, the generated translation candidates
are ranked using a ranking algorithm based on
language model information and a length-based
heuristic. The top ranked output is chosen as the
final APE output.

Saarland University. This system combines the
Operation Sequence Model (OSM) (Durrani et al.,
2011) with the classic phrase-based statistical MT
(PB-SMT) approach. The OSM-APE method rep-
resents the post-edited translation process as a lin-
ear sequence of operations such as lexical genera-
tion of post-edited translation and their orderings.
The translation and reordering decisions are con-
ditioned on n previous translation and reordering
decisions. This technique is able to model both lo-
cal and long-range reorderings that are quite useful
when dealing with the German language. To im-
prove the capability of choosing the correct edit to
process, eight new features are added to the log-
linear model. These features capture the cost of
deleting a phrase and different information on pos-
sible gaps in reordering operations. The monolin-
gual alignments between the MT outputs and their
post-edits are computed using different methods
based on TER, METEOR (Snover et al., 2006) and
Berkeley Aligner (Liang et al., 2006). Only the
task data is used for these submissions.

7.3 TER/BLEU results

The official TER and BLEU results achieved by
participants are reported in Table 34. The sub-
mitted runs are sorted based on the average (case-
sensitive) TER measured on test data, which was
this year’s primary evaluation metric.

Looking at the performance of the two base-
lines, i.e. the raw MT output (Baseline) and the
basic statistical APE approach of Simard et al.
(2007), the latter outperforms the former with both
metrics. This indicates that, under this year’s
evaluation conditions, the MT outputs could be
improved by learning from human post-editors’
work.

Differently from the pilot task (Bojar et al.,
2015), in which none of the runs was able to beat
the baselines, this year half of the participants
achieved this goal by producing automatic post-
edited sentences that result in lower TER (with a

maximum of -3.24 points) and higher BLEU score
(up to +5.54 points). All differences with respect
to such baselines are statistically significant. This
suggests that the correction patterns learned from
the data were reliable enough to allow most sys-
tems to effectively correct the original MT output.

The obvious question is whether the improve-
ments observed this year are due to the new data
set (i.e. domain-specific texts and professional
post-edits) or to a real technology jump (i.e. the
use of neural end-to-end APE systems, factored
or operational sequential models). A partial an-
swer is given by the performance of the approach
of Simard et al. (2007), which we run on the data
of both rounds of the APE task with the same im-
plementation. Although its results on the two test
sets are difficult to compare (also due to the differ-
ent language setting), the overall TER scores and
the relative distances with respect to the other sub-
mitted runs can give us some indications.

First of all, on the pilot test set, the basic statis-
tical APE method damaged the original MT out-
put quality, with a TER reduction of about 1 point.
On this year’s data it achieves a small improve-
ment (though statistically significant only in terms
of BLEU). This suggests that, as hypothesized in
Section 7.1.1, the higher repetitiveness featured by
the selected data can facilitate the work of the APE
systems. The new scenario, with repetition rates
for SRC, TGT and PE that are more than twice the
values measured last year (see Table 32), makes
them able to learn from the training data a larger
number of reliable and re-applicable correction
patterns. However, the large improvements ob-

tained this year by the top runs can only be reached
by moving from the basic statistical MT backbone
shared by all last year’s participants to new and
more reliable APE solutions. Indeed, its distance
from the top-ranked systems has increased from
0.6 up to 3.12 TER points. While on one side it
is true that the new data made the task easier, on
the other side the deployed solutions and the in-
creased results’ distance over the basic statistical
APE approach indicate a significant step forward.

In terms of TER and BLEU evaluations, there
are minor differences (only for the lower ranked
systems) between the two rankings. This confirms
that both metrics capture similar linguistic phe-
nomena and the use of n-grams does not show par-
ticular advantages.

7.4 System/performance analysis

Differently from the pilot round, in which TER re-
sults were more concentrated (the difference be-
tween the top and the lowest ranked system was
about 1.5 points), this year systems’ performance
is distributed within an interval of about 7.5 points.
Indeed, the two rankings of Table 34 can be seen
as composed of three blocks: the best system,
the systems scoring around the baselines and the
lower performing systems. Trying to go beyond
rough TER/BLEU measurements and to shed light
on such performance differences, in this section
we focus on a more fine-grained analysis of sys-
tems’ behaviour and the corresponding errors.

7.4.1 System behaviour
A first interesting aspect to analyse is systems’ be-
haviour which, compared to last year, reflects the
larger variety of approaches explored. Does this
variety result in major differences in the correc-
tion strategies/operations? To answer this ques-
tion, we first analysed the submitted runs taking
into consideration the changes made by each sys-
tem to the test instances. Table 35 shows the num-
ber of modified, improved and deteriorated sen-
tences. It’s worth noting that, as observed last
year, for all the systems the number of modified
sentences is higher than the sum of the improved
and the deteriorated ones. This difference is rep-
resented by modified sentences for which the cor-
rections do not yield TER variations. This grey
area, for which quality improvement/degradation
can not be automatically assessed, contributes to
motivate the human evaluation discussed in Sec-
tion 7.5

Table 35: Number of test sentences modified, improved and deteriorated by each submitted run.

Looking at the numbers in Table 35, it be-
comes evident that the overall number of modi-
fied sentences is considerably larger than in the
pilot task. On average, the best run submitted
by each team modified 42.5% sentences. This
amount is much larger than last year, when the
percentage was 18.0%, probably due to the higher
repetitiveness of the data which makes possible
to learn more reliable and applicable correction
rules. The same holds for the average number
of improved sentences, which this year is signif-
icantly larger (18.7% vs. 11% in the pilot). This
trend is confirmed by the performance of our re-
implementation of Simard et al. (2007), which
modified 35% of the sentences (vs. 26% in the
pilot), improving 45% (vs. 11% last year) and de-
teriorating 36% of them (vs. 61%).

These figures, however, vary considerably
across the submitted runs. Among the systems that
improve over the basic statistical APE approach,
the top-ranked one modified an impressive num-
ber of test sentences (80%), which is more than
twice the amount of items changed by the other
submissions. For the same system, the improved
and the deteriorated ones are respectively about
58% and 23% of the total, which is in line with the
other participants that improved the baseline. An
interesting general conclusion that we can draw is
that the neural approach adopted by the top-ranked
system allowed it to better cope with the data spar-
sity issues that affect the other methods (despite
the higher repetitiveness of this year’s data). More
thorough investigations that are beyond the scope
of this overview should verify the hypothesis that
learning and generalising rules from a relatively
small amount of human post-edits is easier with

Figure 10: System Behaviour – TER(MT, APE)

neural models than with pure statistical solutions.
Another aspect that should be checked is whether
the neural solution performs better per se or thanks
to the much larger amount of training data needed
for its deployment.

Further insights about systems’ behaviour can
be drawn from the analysis of Figure 10. It plots
the distribution of the edit operations done by each
system (insertions, deletions, substitutions, shifts)
obtained by computing the TER between the orig-
inal MT output and the output of each system as
reference (only for the primary submissions).

The figure evidences some interesting trends,
starting from the much larger proportion of shifts
made by the top-ranked neural approach. More
than 450 shift operations (9.2% of the total),
in fact, represent the major difference between
the behaviour of the winning system and all the

181



Figure 11: System Error – TER(APE, human post-edits)

other submissions (the second-ranked one per-
forms only 26 shifts, 2.5% of the total). It is likely,
but this should be verified, that the available train-
ing data featured correction patterns that the neural
method was able to model and re-apply better than
the other solutions. Overall, the behaviour of the
best system is the most balanced with respect the
three other operations. In total, insertions, dele-
tions and substitutions (respectively 1,132, 1,465
and 1,807) are considerably more that those made
by the other systems and they are more evenly dis-
tributed (23%, 30% and 37% respectively). As a
term of comparison, the second-ranked primary
submission performed much less operations (83
insertions, 652 deletions and 248 substitutions),
with a clear predominance (65%) of deletions that
is common also to other submissions. As a gen-
eral remark, best results seem to be associated with
a rather homogeneous distribution of the types of
correction patterns learned by the system.

7.4.2 System error
Another interesting aspect to analyse is the effect
of the different methods on the types of errors
made by each system. Does the variety in the ap-
proaches result in major differences in the types of
errors made? To answer this question, Figure 11
plots the distribution of the edit operations needed
to transform the output of each system into the
human post-edits available for each test sentence.
Such distribution of systems’ errors is obtained by
computing the TER between their output and the
human post-edits of the original translations as ref-
erence.

The figure does not show visible trends that can
provide us with useful hints. In terms of error dis-
tribution, the task baseline, our re-implementation
of Simard et al. (2007), and the submitted pri-
mary runs show almost identical ratios. Inser-
tions range between 17% and 20% of the total,
deletions range between 23% and 28%, substitu-
tions range between 44% and 49%. The high-
est percentage of substitution errors suggests that
the major problem for all systems is the lexical
choice. Half of the errors in the APE output be-
long to this error category, indicating that learn-
ing the appropriate lexical replacements from hu-
man post-edits is still one of the main challenges.
Comparing the error distribution in the MT base-
line (our ground truth in terms of what has to be
corrected) with the actions actually made by each
system as shown in Figure 10, it is interesting to
emphasise the higher similarity with the distribu-
tions of the operations made by the top-performing
system. “AMU Primary”, indeed, seems to per-
form a slightly larger amount of insertions com-
pared to the total insertions actually needed, while
the other operations are substantially in line with
the expected amount. Based on TER information,
nothing can be said about which of them are actu-
ally correct/wrong. The only conclusions we can
draw at this stage are: i) a good amount of MT
errors is corrected (the global TER decreases), ii)
the actions of the top-performing system are quite
evenly distributed, iii) such distribution is the clos-
est to the distribution of ground truth operations
but iv) errors (missing corrections and/or wrong
corrections) still remain in all classes.

In light of these considerations, we performed
further analysis by evaluating this years’ APE sub-
missions also from another point of view. To this
aim, in the next section we try to understand the re-
lation between the participants’ performance and
the human perception of translation quality.

7.5 Human Evaluation

To assess the quality of APE systems and produce
a ranking based on human judgement, as well as
analyze how humans perceive TER/BLEU perfor-
mance differences between the submitted systems,
two runs of human evaluations were conducted.
The whole evaluation took approximately a month
and was performed mainly by student translators
who annotated the APE systems’ outputs. This
subsection describes the human evaluation pro-

182



cedure, gives details about the annotators’ back-
grounds and profiles, and finally presents the re-
sults of the evaluation.

7.5.1 Evaluation Procedure
The two runs of human evaluation were conducted
using the Appraise37 (Federmann, 2012) open-
source annotation platform through the ranking
task interface. A ranking task consists of a source
segment and the outputs of up to 5 anonymized
APE systems randomly selected from the set of
participants and displayed in random order to hu-
man evaluators. The main difference between the
two evaluation runs is the following: for the first
run, the annotators were presented with a transla-
tion reference consisting of the manual post-edit of
the machine-translated source segment, while for
the second run no translation reference was pre-
sented to the human evaluator. For both evaluation
runs, the non-post-edited MT output was included
among the systems to evaluate. For the second
evaluation run, the human post-edited version of
the MT output was included among the systems to
evaluate.

A total of 200 randomly extracted source seg-
ments taken from the test set presented in Table 31
with their corresponding systems’ outputs were
considered for the first evaluation run, while 100
source segments went through the second run. The
decision to consider a larger set of segments for
the first evaluation run is based on the previous
editions of WMT, where human evaluations con-
ducted for the translation tasks included a transla-
tion reference. The smaller scale evaluation for the
second run can be seen as a pilot study, where no
translation reference is given to the annotators and
where the human post-edit is presented as part of
the anonymized systems. The latter setup allows
us to see if APE systems can reach human post-
editing in terms of quality while avoiding evalua-
tion bias towards a reference.

We carried out six annotation sessions in a con-
trolled environment of approximately 45 to 60
minutes each, divided in two blocks of equal dura-
tion with a small break in between. Prior to the hu-
man evaluation task, we provided annotators with
a pilot study in order to be introduced to the rank-
ing task and be familiarized with the annotation
interface. For each source sentence, five systems’
outputs were randomly selected among the partic-

37https://github.com/cfedermann/Appraise

ipants and the non-post-edited MT output. For the
second evaluation run, the human post-edit was in-
cluded in the random selection of target sentences
to annotate. The human annotators then ranked the
outputs from 1 to 5 (1 being the best) with ties al-
lowed. All source segments were evaluated by at
least 3 annotators. The annotations were then used
with the TrueSkill38 adaptive ranking system to
produce a score for each system based on their in-
ferred means (Sakaguchi et al., 2014). This score
was used to sort and cluster the systems submitted
by the participants, as well as the MT output and
the human post-edit, and produce the final ranking
presented in Section 7.5.3

7.5.2 Annotators Background
A total of 37 annotators participated in the man-
ual evaluation of APE systems, including 30
5th semester B.A. students in the Comparative
Linguistics, Literature, and Translation program
taught in Saarland University.39 The remaining
7 evaluators are expert translators and lecturers
at Saarland University in the Applied Linguis-
tics, Translation and Interpreting department.40

Among the annotators, 34 are native German
speakers with strong English skills and have com-
pleted introductory courses such as translation the-
ory and translation studies, machine translation,
CAT tools, and MT evaluation and post-editing.
The remaining 3 annotators have strong German
skills and have been living in Germany for several
years.

7.5.3 Results
The first and second runs of human evaluation re-
sults are respectively presented in Table 36 and Ta-
ble 37.

The first run shows a preference for the AMU
Primary system compared to the other submis-
sions (Table 36). These results confirm those ob-
tained with the automatic metrics as shown in Ta-
ble 34 and we can see that two systems are above
the Baseline (the raw MT output). The CUNI
Primary and USAAR Primary systems are in the
same cluster with the Baseline, which indicates a
non-significant difference with p ≤ 0.05. Two
systems are in a single cluster below the base-
line, namely JUSAAR Primary and DCU Primary,
being on par with the results obtained using au-

tomatic metrics. The correlation between auto-
matic metrics and the first manual evaluation run
indicates the reliability of popular MT metrics for
the evaluation of APE systems. On average, an-
notators needed 53 seconds to perform one rank-
ing task, while the fastest ranking was performed
in 18.3 seconds and the slowest one took more
than 4 minutes and 30 seconds (averaged over at
least 3 annotators for the same source segment).
The agreement between annotators on the first run
of evaluation is k = 0.481 according to Fleiss’
Kappa (Fleiss, 1971).

The results of the second run of manual evalua-
tion (Table 37) show that the human post-editing
of MT output is preferred by human annotators
when compared to the other systems’ outputs,
reaching the first position. It indicates that, in spite
of the significant improvements over the original
MT output, none of the submitted APE systems
managed to reach the translation quality achieved
by human post-editing. The second position in
the ranking is reached by the AMU Primary sys-

tem, while a single cluster is ranked third and con-
tains all the remaining systems as well as the Base-
line. This smaller amount of clusters can be due
to the limited scale of the second run of manual
evaluation involving 100 source segments only,
compared with the 200 segments for the first run.
However, this second run shows that the AMU Pri-
mary system is again preferred by human evalua-
tors compared to the other systems without nec-
essarily being closer to the human post-edited MT
output, which is not included as a translation refer-
ence, and thus without biasing human judgements.
The agreement between annotators for the second
run of evaluation is slightly lower compared to
the first run, with a Fleiss’ Kappa of k = 0.466.
For both runs, the inter-annotator agreement is
considered moderate. On average, the annota-
tors needed 60 seconds per ranking task, while the
fastest ranked outputs was completed in 21.7 sec-
onds and the slowest one in 3 minutes.

7.6 Lessons learned and outlook

The objectives of this pilot APE task were to: i)
improve and stabilize the evaluation framework in
view of future rounds, ii) analyze the effect on task
feasibility of data coming from a narrow domain,
iii) analyze the effect of post-edits collected from
professional translators, iv) analyze how humans
perceive TER/BLEU performance differences be-
tween different systems, v) measure the progress
made during one year of research on the APE task.

Concerning the first point, no specific issues
emerged this year calling for major changes. The
overall format, starting from the baselines and the
evaluation metrics adopted, will likely be kept also
for the next round.

As regards points ii) and iii) the positive effect
of domain-specific data and professional-quality
post-edits is evident. Most likely, these favorable
conditions for automatic post-editing will be kept
as well, also because they represent a more stan-
dard translation scenario compared to the generic
news domain.

Regarding point iv), an interesting finding of
the manual evaluation is a correlation between hu-
man judgements and the results obtained with au-
tomatic metrics. This confirms the reliability of
popular MT metrics, namely BLEU and TER, for
APE systems evaluation. Despite the baseline im-
provements and the significant overall TER/BLEU
gains, the feedback from human evaluators regard-

184



ing the quality of the APE MT segments is not
fully positive yet, showing that there is still room
for improvement. One explanation for this is prob-
ably related to the domain specificity of the data
set used for this year’s APE shared task. Many
segments contain sets of instructions and com-
mands that are used in user manuals of the IT do-
main and were given to annotators without con-
text. The annotators also pointed out that they con-
sidered difficult to rank very similar segments, as
most APE systems do not make substantial modi-
fications of the MT output, which results in similar
outputs in terms of quality and leads to challeng-
ing comparisons for humans. This aspect is em-
phasized when no translation reference is given to
the annotators. In this case, only the top-ranked
system emerges as a source of corrections that are
significantly better than the baseline (in spite of
the impressive TER and BLEU gains, respectively
up to -3.24 and +5.54 points).

In terms of progress over the last year, this was a
successful follow-up. More participants, some of
which new, resulted in a larger variety in the sub-
mitted systems. Those pursuing the phrase-based
approach that dominated the pilot round managed
to improve over this common backbone in dif-
ferent ways. Other teams introduced interesting
novelties, bringing also into the APE framework
the popularity of neural approaches. The tangi-
ble result is represented by the large improvements
over the (last year unbeaten) baseline achieved by
most of the systems. Such gains indicate the good
potential of APE systems to improve MT output
in black-box conditions and motivate further re-
search and developments.

A Pairwise System Comparisons by Human Judges

Tables 40–46 show pairwise comparisons between systems for each language pair. The numbers in each
of the tables’ cells indicate the percentage of times that the system in that column was judged to be better
than the system in that row, ignoring ties. Bolding indicates the winner of the two systems.

Because there were so many systems and data conditions the significance of each pairwise compar-
ison needs to be quantified. We applied the Sign Test to measure which comparisons indicate genuine
differences (rather than differences that are attributable to chance). In the following tables ? indicates sta-
tistical significance at p ≤ 0.10, † indicates statistical significance at p ≤ 0.05, and ‡ indicates statistical
significance at p ≤ 0.01, according to the Sign Test.

Each table contains final rows showing how likely a system would win when paired against a randomly
selected system (the expected win ratio score) and the rank range according bootstrap resampling (p ≤
0.05). Gray lines separate clusters based on non-overlapping rank ranges.
