The study of evaluation, affect, and subjectivity is a multidisciplinary enterprise, including

sociology, psychology, economics, linguistics, and computer science. A number of excellent

computational linguistics and linguistic surveys of the field exist. Most surveys, however,

do not bring the two disciplines together to show how methods from linguistics can benefit

computational sentiment analysis systems. In this survey, we show how incorporating linguistic

insights, discourse information, and other contextual phenomena, in combination with the

statistical exploitation of data, can result in an improvement over approaches that take advantage

of only one of these perspectives. We first provide a comprehensive introduction to evaluative

language from both a linguistic and computational perspective. We then argue that the standard

computational definition of the concept of evaluative language neglects the dynamic nature of

evaluation, in which the interpretation of a given evaluation depends on linguistic and extra-

linguistic contextual factors. We thus propose a dynamic definition that incorporates update

functions. The update functions allow for different contextual aspects to be incorporated into the

calculation of sentiment for evaluative words or expressions, and can be applied at all levels of

discourse. We explore each level and highlight which linguistic aspects contribute to accurate

extraction of sentiment. We end the review by outlining what we believe the future directions of

sentiment analysis are, and the role that discourse and contextual information need to play.

1. Introduction

Evaluation aspects of language allow us to convey feelings, assessments of people,
situations and objects, and to share and contrast those opinions with other speakers.
An increased interest in subjectivity, evaluation, and opinion can be viewed as part of
what has been termed the affective turn in philosophy, sociology, and political science
(Clough and Halley 2007), and affective computing in artificial intelligence (Picard
1997). This interest has met with the rise of the social web, and the possibility of widely
broadcasting emotions, evaluations, and opinions.

The study of evaluation, affect, and subjectivity is a multidisciplinary enterprise,
including sociology (Voas 2014), psychology (Ortony et al. 1988; Davidson et al. 2003),
economics (Rick and Loewenstein 2008), and computer science (Pang and Lee 2008;
Scherer et al. 2010; Cambria and Hussain 2012; Liu 2012, 2015). In linguistics, studies
have been framed within a wide range of theories, such as Appraisal theory (Martin
and White 2005), stance (Biber and Finegan 1989), evaluation (Hunston and Thompson
2000b), and nonveridicality (Taboada and Trnavac 2013) (cf. Section 2.3). In computer
science, most current research examines the expression and automatic extraction of
opinion at three main levels of granularity (Liu 2012): the document, the sentence,
and the aspect. The first level aims to categorize documents globally as being positive
or negative, whereas the second one determines the subjective orientation and then
the opinion orientation (positive or negative) of sequences of words in the sentence
that are determined to be subjective. The aspect level focuses on extracting opinions
according to the target domain features or aspects (cf. Section 3.2). Extraction methods
used in each of the three levels rely on a variety of approaches going from bag-of-
words representations and structured representations based on the use of grammar
and dependency relations, to more sophisticated models that address the complexity of
language, such as negation, speculation, and various context-dependent phenomena.

A number of excellent computational linguistics and linguistic surveys of the field
exist. Hunston and Thompson (2000b) proposed in their book Evaluation in Text an
overview of how evaluative expressions can be analyzed lexically, grammatically, and
textually, and a recent edited collection (Thompson and Alba-Juez 2014) focuses on
theoretical and empirical studies of evaluative text at different linguistic levels (phono-
logical, lexical, or semantic), and in different text genres and contexts. Computational
approaches to evaluative text (known as sentiment analysis) have been reviewed by
Pang and Lee (2008), Liu (2012, 2015), and Feldman (2013), among others. This is clearly
an important topic: A Google Scholar search for “sentiment analysis” yields about
31,000 publications, and the Pang and Lee survey alone has more than 4,700 citations.

In this survey, we focus on linguistic aspects of evaluative language, and show how
the treatment of linguistic phenomena, in particular at the discourse level, can benefit
computational sentiment analysis systems, and help such systems advance beyond
representations that include only bags of words or bags of sentences. We also show
how discourse and pragmatic information can help move beyond current sentence-level
approaches that typically account for local contextual phenomena, and do so by relying
on polarity lexicons and shallow or deep syntactic parsing.

More importantly, we argue that incorporating linguistic insights, discourse infor-
mation, and other contextual phenomena, in combination with the statistical exploita-
tion of data, can result in an improvement over approaches that take advantage of only
one of those perspectives. Together with an affective turn, we believe computational
linguistics is currently experiencing a discourse turn, a growing awareness of how
multiple sources of information, and especially information from context and discourse,

Benamara, Taboada, and Mathieu Evaluative Language Beyond Bags of Words

can have a positive impact on a range of computational applications (Webber et al. 2012).
We believe that future breakthroughs in natural language processing (NLP) applications
will require developing synergies between machine learning techniques and bag-of-
words representations on the one hand, and in-depth theoretical accounts, together
with detailed analyses of linguistic phenomena, on the other hand. In particular, we
investigate:

r The complex lexical semantics of evaluative expressions, including
semantic categorization and domain dependency.

r Contextual effects deriving from negation, modality, and nonveridicality.

r Topicality, coherence relations, discourse structure, and other related
discourse-level phenomena.

r Complex evaluative language phenomena such as implicit evaluation,
figurative language (irony, sarcasm), and intent detection.

r Extra-linguistic information, such as social network structure and user
profiles.

The article is organized around four main parts. The first (in Section 2) provides a
comprehensive introduction to evaluative language, focusing on linguistic theories and
how evaluative phenomena are described. Section 3 contains a computational definition
of the problem statement, and a brief explanation of the standard approaches that have
been applied in sentiment analysis. We argue that the standard definition of the concept
of evaluative language is not sufficient to address discourse and contextual phenomena,
and thus Section 4 introduces a new dynamic definition. Then, in Sections 5 and 6 we
move from current approaches to future directions in sentiment analysis. Under current
approaches, we discuss local and sentence-level phenomena, and in the new directions
section we overview the main discourse and context-level phenomena that we believe
need to be addressed to accurately capture sentiment. The last section summarizes what
we believe are the future directions of sentiment analysis, emphasizing the importance
of discourse and contextual information.

2. Linguistic Approaches to Evaluative Text

Evaluation, as a cover term for many approaches, has long been the object of interest
in linguistics. Unfortunately, however, no single theoretical framework has attempted
to examine and account for the full range of evaluative devices available in language.
The main exception is the Appraisal framework (Martin and White 2005), which does
provide a very rich description of how evaluation is expressed and also implied in
text. Before we devote a good part of this section to Appraisal, we briefly discuss other
approaches in linguistics that have dealt with the resources deployed in the expression
of evaluation. We are aware that the term evaluation is also used within the context
of testing and benchmarking in computer science. To avoid confusion, we explicitly
use the terms evaluative language or evaluative expressions to refer to the computational
study of evaluative text. When we use the shorter form evaluation, it generally refers to
expression of evaluation and opinion in language.

2.1 Stance

We could begin at different points, but one of the earliest attempts to describe evaluative
language comes from Biber, Finegan, and colleagues. In a series of papers (Biber and
Finegan 1988, 1989; Conrad and Biber 2000), they describe stance as the expression
of the speaker’s attitudes, feelings, and judgment, as well as their commitment towards
the message. Stance, in this sense, encompasses evidentiality (commitment towards
the message) and affect (positive or negative evaluation). The initial focus (Biber and
Finegan 1988) was on adverbials (personally, frankly, unquestionably, of course, apparently).
Later on, Biber and Finegan (1989) added adjectives, verbs, modal verbs, and hedges as
markers of evidentiality and affect. In both papers, the classification of stance markers
leads to an analysis of texts based on cluster analysis. The clusters represent different
stance styles, such as Emphatic Expression of Affect, Expository Expression of Doubt,
or Faceless. Within each of those styles one can find different genres/registers. For
instance, Emphatic Expression of Affect includes texts such as personal letters, face-to-
face conversations, and romance fiction. On the other hand, Faceless texts were found
in the following genres: academic prose, press reportage, radio broadcasts, biographies,
official documents and letters, among others.

This kind of genre classification, identifying how much the writer/speaker is in-
volved, and how much evaluation is being displayed, is useful to gauge the “volume”
of a text. If we know that we are dealing with a highly subjective genre, then finding
high levels of subjective and evaluative words is not surprising. On the other hand, in
what Biber and Finegan call Faceless texts, a high proportion of evaluative expressions
is more significant, and is probably indicative of an overtly subjective text (i.e., one
with a higher “volume,” from the point of view of evaluative language).

The term stance, in Biber and Finegan’s work, is quite close to our use of evaluative
language or opinion. There is another meaning of stance, with regard to position in a
debate, namely, for or against, or ideological position (Somasundaran and Wiebe 2009).
We will not have much to say about recognizing positions, although it is an active
and related area of research (Thomas et al. 2006; Hasan and Ng 2013). The SemEval
2016 competition included both sentiment analysis and stance detection tasks, where
stance is defined as “automatically determining from text whether the author is in
favor of, against, or neutral towards a proposition or target (Mohammad et al. in press).
Targets mentioned in the SemEval task include legalization of abortion, atheism, climate
change, or Hillary Clinton. The SemEval task organizers further specify that sentiment
analysis and stance detection are different in that sentiment analysis attempts to capture
polarity in a piece of text, whereas stance detection aims at extracting the author’s
standpoint towards a target that may not be explicitly mentioned in the text. Stance
detection may be seen as a textual entailment task, because the stance may have to be
inferred from what is present in the text, such as the fact that the author does not like
Hillary Clinton if they express favorable views of another candidate.

2.2 Evidentiality

Biber and Finegan only briefly touch on evidentiality, but it is an area of study in its
own right, examining the linguistic coding of attitudes towards knowledge, and in par-
ticular ways of expressing it cross-linguistically (Chafe and Nichols 1986). Evidentiality
expresses three basic types of meaning (Chafe 1986; Boye and Harder 2009):

r Reliability of knowledge, with adverbs such as maybe, probably, surely.

204



Benamara, Taboada, and Mathieu Evaluative Language Beyond Bags of Words

r Mode of knowing: belief with constructions such as I think, I guess;
induction with must, seem, evidently; and deduction with should, could,
presumably.

r Source of knowledge indicated by verbs indicating the source of input
(see, hear, feel).

Evidentiality has not received a great deal of attention in the sentiment analysis
literature, even though it provides a set of resources to ascertain the reliability of an
opinion, and is within the realm of speculation (Vincze et al. 2008; Saurı́ and Pustejovsky
2009). Some aspects of it, however, are captured in the Engagement system within the
Appraisal framework, which we will discuss later.

2.3 Nonveridicality

Nonveridicality usually includes a host of phenomena that indicate that individual
words and phrases may not be reliable for the purposes of sentiment analysis, also
known as irrealis. Irrealis in general refers to expressions that indicate that the events
mentioned in an utterance are not factual. Nonveridicality is wider, including all
contexts that are not veridical—that is, which are not based on truth or existence
(Giannakidou 1995; Zwarts 1995). The class of nonveridical operators typically includes
negation, modal verbs, intensional verbs (believe, think, want, suggest), imperatives, ques-
tions, protasis of conditionals, habituals, and the subjunctive, (in languages that have an
expression of subjunctive) (Trnavac and Taboada 2012).

Nonveridicality is different from evidentiality in that evidential markers may
code nonveridical meanings, but also different shades within veridical propositions.
A speaker may present something as fact (thus veridical), but at the same time distance
themselves from the reliability of the statement through evidential markers (e.g., Critics
say it’s a good movie).

Nonveridicality is relevant in sentiment analysis because evaluative expressions in
the scope of a nonveridical operator may not be reliable, that is, they may express the
opposite polarity of the evaluative expression (when in the scope of negation), may
see their polarity downtoned or otherwise hedged (in the presence of modal verbs or
intensional verbs), or may interact with nonveridical operators in complex ways. The
presence of conditionals as nonveridical operators has led to some work on the nature
of coherence relations and their role in evaluative language (Asher et al. 2009; Trnavac
and Taboada 2012). We discuss computational treatment of nonveridicality in Section 5.

2.4 Subjectivity

The term subjectivity has different senses and has been adopted in computational
linguistics to encompass automatic extraction of both sentiment and polarity (Wiebe
et al. 2004). Subjectivity in linguistics is a much more general and complex phenomenon,
often relating to point of view. Researchers working with this definition are inter-
ested in deixis, locative expressions, and use of modal verbs, among other phenomena
(Langacker 1990). The connections to sentiment analysis are obvious, because epistemic
modals convey subjective meaning and are related to evidentiality.

White (2004) has also written about subjectivity as point of view, and some of his
work is framed within the Appraisal framework (see Section 2.6). White discusses the
opposition between objective and subjective statements in media discourse, and how

205



Computational Linguistics Volume 43, Number 1

the latter can be conveyed not through overt subjective expressions, but through associ-
ation, metaphor, or inference. Distilling such forms of opinion is certainly important in
sentiment analysis, but also particularly difficult, as they rely on world knowledge that
is inaccessible to most systems. We will discuss the role of some of these in Section 6.

Our discussion of subjectivity will then be circumscribed to the distinction between
objective and subjective statements. Wiebe and colleagues have devoted considerable
effort to finding indicators of subjectivity in sentences (Wiebe et al. 2004; Wiebe and
Riloff 2005; Wilson et al. 2006). They propose a set of clues to subjectivity, some of them
lexical and some syntactic. Among the lexical clues are psychological verbs and verbs
of judgment (dread, love, commend, reprove); verbs and adjectives that usually involve
an experiencer (fuss, worry, please, upset, embarrass, dislike); and adjectives that have
been previously annotated for polarity. The syntactic clues are learned from manually
annotated data (Riloff and Wiebe 2003; Wiebe et al. 2003).

2.5 Evaluation and Pattern Grammar

Under the label “evaluation” we will examine a fruitful area of research that has
studied evaluation and opinion within a functional framework. The best example of
such endeavor is the edited volume by Hunston and Thompson (2000b). Hunston
and Thompson (2000a), in their Introduction, propose that there are two aspects to
evaluative language: modality and something else, which is variously called evaluation,
appraisal, or stance. Modality tends to express opinions about propositions, such as
their likelihood (It may rain). It also tends to be more grammaticalized. Evaluation, on
the other hand, expresses opinions about entities, and is mostly (although not exclu-
sively) expressed through adjectives. Hunston and Thompson review some of the main
approaches to the study of subjectivity, and note that there seem to be approaches that
separate modality and evaluation as two distinct phenomena (Halliday 1985; Martin
2000; White 2003; Halliday and Matthiessen 2014). Other researchers combine the two
expressions of opinion, often under one label, such as stance (Biber and Finegan 1989;
Conrad and Biber 2000). In sentiment analysis, modality has been included as one of
the phenomena that affect evaluative language. A comprehensive treatment of such
phenomena, however, such as the one offered by nonveridicality (see Section 2.3) seems
beneficial, as it provides a unified framework to deal with all valence shifters. Hunston
and Thompson (2000a) espouse a combining approach, and propose that the cover term
for both aspects should be “evaluation.”

Hunston and Thompson (2000a, page 6) argue that evaluation has three major
functions:

r To express the speaker’s or writer’s opinion.

r To construct and maintain relations between the speaker/writer and
hearer/reader.

r To organize the discourse.

The first two functions are variously discussed in the sentiment literature, with
emphasis on the first one, and some treatment of the second, in terms of how the
writer presents, manipulates, or summarizes information. This is an area covered by
the Engagement system in Appraisal. But it is the third aspect that has received the
least attention in computational treatments of evaluative language, perhaps because it
is the most difficult to process. Hunston and Thompson (2000a) present this function

206



Benamara, Taboada, and Mathieu Evaluative Language Beyond Bags of Words

as one of argumentation. A writer not only expresses opinion, and engages with the
reader, but also presents arguments in a certain order and with a certain organization.
Evaluation at the end of units such as paragraphs indicates that a point in the argument
has been made, and that the writer assumes the reader accepts that point. In general,
Hunston and Thompson argue that evaluation is expressed as much by text as it is by
individual lexical items and by grammar. We would argue that, in addition to location
in the text, other textual and discourse characteristics, in particular coherence relations
(see Section 6.1), play a role in the interpretation of evaluation.

Pattern-based descriptions of language are of special relevance here, because they
avoid a distinction between lexis and grammar, but rather treat them as part of the
same object of description (Hunston and Francis 2000). Subjectivity spans over the two,
sometimes being conveyed by a single word, sometimes by a phrase, and sometimes by
an entire grammatical structure. Hunston and Francis (2000, page 37) define patterns of
a word as “all the words and structures which are regularly associated with the word
and which contribute to its meaning.”

The most in-depth description of patterns and evaluation is Hunston (2011), where
a case is clearly made that certain patterns contribute to evaluative meanings, with
a distinction between patterns that perform the function of evaluation, namely, “per-
formative” patterns, according to Hunston (2011, page 139), and patterns that report
evaluation. Examples of performative patterns are it and there patterns, as in It is
amazing that. . . ; There is something admirable about. . . An example of a pattern that reports
evaluation is Verb + that, as in Most people said that he was aloof. Hunston also discusses
phrases that accompany evaluation, such as as (is) humanly possible; to the point of; or
bordering on.

Work on evaluative language within linguistics has seen steady publication in the
last few years, including a follow-up volume, edited by Thompson and Alba-Juez
(2014). This new collection places even more emphasis on the whole-text nature of
evaluation: The title is Evaluation in Context, and the papers therein clearly demonstrate
the pervasive nature of evaluation, in addition to its connection to emotion. In the
introduction, Alba-Juez and Thompson argue that evaluation permeates all aspects of
the language:

r The phonological level through intonation and pitch.

r The morphological with suffixes in morphologically rich languages, but
also in English. Consider the use of the suffix –let in the term deanlet,
coined by Ginsberg (2011) to describe a new class of academic
administrators.

r The lexical level. This is self-evident, as most of our discussion, and the
discussion in the sentiment analysis literature has focused on words.

r The syntactic level. Systems of modality and nonveridicality, but also
word order and structural aspects, as discussed within pattern grammar.

r The semantic level. This is the thorniest aspect, and includes pragmatics
as well. It refers to the non-compositional nature of some evaluative
expressions and their context-dependence. A long meal may be positive
if it is with friends, but is perhaps negative with business relations.

It is clear, then, that focusing on only one of those levels, the lexical level, will
result in an incomplete picture of the evaluative spectrum that language has to offer.

207



Computational Linguistics Volume 43, Number 1

That is why we believe that bags-of-words approaches need to be complemented with
information from other levels.

2.6 Appraisal

Appraisal belongs in the systemic-functional tradition started by Halliday (Halliday
and Matthiessen 2014), and has been developed by Jim Martin, Peter White, and col-
leagues (Martin 2000; Martin and White 2005; White 2012; Martin 2014). Martin (2000)
characterizes appraisal as the set of resources used to negotiate emotions, judgments,
and valuations, alongside resources for amplifying and engaging with those evalua-
tions. He considers that appraisal resources form a system of their own within the lan-
guage (in the sense of system within Systemic Functional Linguistics), and divides the
Appraisal system into three distinct sub-systems (see Figure 1): Attitude, Graduation,
and Engagement.

The central aspect of the theory is the Attitude system and its three subsystems,
Affect, Judgment, and Appreciation. Affect is used to construe emotional responses
about the speaker or somebody else’s reactions (e.g., happiness, sadness, fear). Judgment
conveys moral evaluations of character about somebody else than the speaker (e.g.,
ethical, deceptive, brave). Appreciation captures aesthetic qualities of objects and natural
phenomena (remarkable, elegant, innovative).

Computational treatment of Appraisal (see Section 6) typically involves inscribed
instances, that is, those that are explicitly present in the text via a word with positive or
negative meaning. Instances that are not inscribed are considered to be invoked (also
sometimes called evoked), in which “an evaluative response is projected by reference to
events or states which are conventionally prized” (Hunston and Thompson 2000b, page
142). Thus, a bright kid or a vicious kid are inscribed. On the other hand, a kid who reads
a lot or a kid who tears the wings off butterflies present invoked Appraisal. Because it is
easier to identify automatically, most research in computational linguistics has focused
on inscribed Appraisal and evaluation. We discuss implicit or invoked evaluation in
Section 6, together with metaphor, irony, and sarcasm.

In addition to the very central Attitude system, Martin and White (2005) argue
that two other systems play a crucial role in the expression of opinion. The Graduation
system is responsible for a speaker’s ability to intensify or weaken the strength of the

Figure 1

Benamara, Taboada, and Mathieu Evaluative Language Beyond Bags of Words

opinions that they express, and has Force and Focus as subsystems. Force captures the
intensification or downtoning of words that are inherently gradable, whereas Focus
represents how speakers can sharpen or soften words that are usually non-gradable.
Examples of intensification and downtoning are somewhat interesting and a little bit sad.
In a true friend the meaning of friend, usually a non-gradable word, is sharpened. On the
other hand, a friend of sorts implies a softening of the meaning.

The Engagement system is the set of linguistic options that allow the individual
to convey the degree of their commitment to the opinion being presented. It makes a
fundamental distinction between heteroglossic and monoglossic expressions, following
proposals by Bakhtin (1981). In a heteroglossic expression, inter-subjective positioning
is open, because utterances invoke, acknowledge, respond to, anticipate, revise, or
challenge a range of convergent and divergent alternative utterances (Martin and White
2005; White 2012, 2003). The other option is monoglossia, where no alternative view or
openness to accept one is present. Monoglossic utterances are presented as facts.

Appraisal is quite well understood (at least in English), with a wide range of studies
dealing with different genres and other languages. The Appraisal framework provides a
very rich description of different aspects of evaluation and subjective positioning. From
the early stages of sentiment analysis and opinion mining, it was always obvious to
researchers in those areas that Appraisal could be helpful in identifying types of opin-
ions, and in pinpointing the contribution of intensifiers and valence shifters (Polanyi
and Zaenen 2006) in general. We further discuss computational treatments of Appraisal
in Section 5.1.4.

3. Evaluative Language in Computational Linguistics

After an introduction to evaluation and subjectivity in linguistics, we now present
research in computational linguistics, starting with a basic problem definition and a
common characterization of evaluative language. We then provide a short overview of
standard approaches in sentiment analysis.

3.1 Problem Definition

In computational linguistics, evaluative language is used as an umbrella term that
covers a variety of phenomena including opinion, sentiment, attitude, appraisal, affect,
point of view, subjectivity, belief, desire, and speculation. Although computational
linguists do not always seek to distinguish between these phenomena, most of them
commonly agree to define evaluative language as being a subjective piece of language
expressed by a holder (a person, a group, an institution) towards a topic or target
(an object, a person, an action, an event). A key element in this definition is that an
evaluative expression is always associated with a polarized scale regarding social or
moral norms (bad vs. good, love vs. hate, in favor of vs. against, prefer vs. dislike, better
vs. worse, etc.). Hence, the sentence in Example (1) is evaluative because it expresses
a positive evaluation towards the food served in a restaurant, whereas Example (2) is
not. Indeed, Example (1) can be paraphrased as I loved the food, or Go to this restaurant; I
recommend it. On the other hand, Example (2) expresses an emotion, namely, the author’s
subjective feelings and affect, and is not as easily characterized on a polar scale (except
if we accept that jealousy is conventionally defined as negative).

(1) This restaurant serves incredibly delicious food.

(2) I am jealous of the chef.

209



Computational Linguistics Volume 43, Number 1

In the remainder of this survey, we focus on automatic detection of polarized evalua-
tion in text, excluding other forms of evaluative language. For the sake of readability, the
terms evaluation, evaluative language, and polarized evaluation are used interchange-
ably. We leave outside of the scope of this survey research on emotion detection and
classification, which is surveyed by Khurshid (2013) and Mohammad (2016). Related,
but also somewhat beyond our scope, is work on detecting negation and speculation, in
particular in biomedical text (Saurı́ and Pustejovsky 2009; Councill et al. 2010; Morante
and Sporleder 2012a; Cruz et al. 2016).

A frequently used definition of evaluative language as a structured model has been
proposed by Liu (2012), drawing from Kim and Hovy (2004) and Hu and Liu (2004a).
This model is a quintuple (e, a, s, h, t) where e is the entity that is the topic or target
of the opinion (restaurant in Example (1)), a the specific aspect or feature of that entity
(food), s the sentiment or evaluation towards a (incredibly delicious), h the opinion holder
or source (the author in our example), and t the posting time of s. Liu (2012) further
represents s by a triple (y, o, i) in order to capture the sentiment type or sentiment
semantic category y (delicious denotes an appreciation), sentiment polarity or orientation
o (delicious is positive), and sentiment valence i, also known as rate or strength, that
indicates the degree of evaluation on a given scale (incredibly delicious is stronger than
delicious). Sentiment type can be defined according to linguistic-based or psychology-
based classifications. We discuss some of them in Section 5.1.

Liu (2012) notes that sentiment analysis based on this model corresponds to aspect-
based or feature-based sentiment analysis in which systems relate each sentiment s to
an aspect a (or more generally an entity e). Aspect-based models of sentiment have been
most popular in the domain of consumer reviews, where movies, books, restaurants,
hotels, or other consumer products are evaluated in a decompositional manner, with
each aspect (e.g., ambiance, food, service, or price for a restaurant) evaluated separately.
In Section 4.2, we will introduce a new definition, because we believe that contextual
phenomena need to be accounted for in a definition of evaluative language.

3.2 Standard Approaches

The study of how to automatically extract evaluation from natural language data began
in the 1990s (Hearst 1992; Wiebe 1994; Spertus 1997; Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown
1997; Bruce and Wiebe 1999). These initial efforts proceeded in a rather similar way
by making an in-depth inspection of linguistic properties of evaluative language a
prior step to any automatic treatment. The detection of expressions of evaluation relied
not only on individual words taken in isolation but also on surrounding material or
contextual information that were considered essential for a better understanding of
evaluative language in text both at the expression and document level. For example,
Hearst (1992) proposed a model inspired in cognitive linguistics, in which portions of
a text are interpreted following a directionality criterion to determine if an author is
in favor of, neutral, or opposed to some events in a document. The model involved a
set of grammatical patterns relying on a syntactic parser. Spertus (1997) automatically
identified hostile messages by leveraging insulting words and the syntactic context in
which they are used (such as imperative statements, which tend to be more insulting).
Wiebe (1994) proposed an algorithm to identify subjectivity in narratives following
Banfield’s (1982) theory, which characterized sentences of narration as objective
(narrating events or describing the fictional world) or subjective (expressing the
author’s thoughts or perceptions). This algorithm relied on the sentence proximity

assumption where subjective vs. objective sentences were postulated to be more likely
to appear together. Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) studied subjectivity at the
expression level, focusing on the prior sentiment orientation of adjectives. Using a
supervised learning method, they empirically demonstrated that adjectives connected
with the conjunctions and and or usually share the same orientation, whereas the
conjunction but tends to connect adjectives with opposite orientations. Turney and
Littman (2002) extended this approach to infer semantic orientation of words (not only
adjectives) in large corpora.

Since 2000, computational approaches to evaluative language, labeled either as
sentiment analysis or opinion mining, have become one of the most popular appli-
cations of NLP in academic research institutions and industry. In the new century,
however, and moving away from the early approaches where linguistics (and thus
context) played a central role, sentiment analysis has become more a computational
modelization problem than a linguistic one. Popular and commonly used approaches
(“standard” approaches) focus on the automatic extraction of one or several elements of
the quadruple (e, a, s, h), making sentiment analysis a field that involves roughly three
main sub-tasks: (1) topic/aspect extraction, (2) holder identification, and (3) sentiment
determination. These tasks are either performed independently from each other or
simultaneously. When sub-tasks (1), (2), and (3) are treated independently, the depen-
dencies between sentiment and topics are ignored. To account for these dependencies,
two main approaches have been explored: sequential learning (Jakob and Gurevych
2010; Yang and Cardie 2012; Mitchell et al. 2013; Vo and Zhang 2015) and probabilistic
joint sentiment-topic models, which are capable of detecting sentiment and topic at the
same time in an unsupervised fashion (Hu and Liu 2004a; Zhuang et al. 2006; Lin and
He 2009; Wang and Ester 2014; Nguyen and Shirai 2015), even though some approaches
still require a seed of sentiment-bearing words and/or aspect seeds (Qiu et al. 2009; Hai
et al. 2012).

In the following sections we overview the standard approaches to evaluative text
on the three tasks just mentioned. The overview is necessarily brief, because our aim
is not to provide an exhaustive survey of the field of sentiment analysis, but to focus
on how more linguistically informed representations can contribute to the analysis
and extraction of evaluation. For an excellent benchmark comparison of twenty-four
different sentiment analysis systems, see Ribeiro et al. 2016.

3.2.1 Topic/Aspect and Holder Detection. Tasks (1) and (2) are important sub-tasks in
sentiment analysis (Hu and Liu 2004a; Kim and Hovy 2005; Popescu and Etzioni 2005;
Stoyanov and Cardie 2008; Wiegand and Klakow 2010). The holder can be the author,
expressing their own evaluation (The movie is great), or the author stating or reporting
someone else’s evaluation (My mother loves the movie; My mother said that the movie is
great) (Wiebe and Riloff 2005). The holder evaluates a topic or target that is the entity
or a part or attribute of the entity that the sentiment is predicated upon (Liu 2015). A
topic is thus a global entity e (e.g., a product, service, person, event, or issue) organized
hierarchically into a set of attributes or aspects a (e.g., engine, tires are part of the entity
car), as can be done in a thesaurus or domain ontology.

For holder recognition, it has been shown that semantic role labeling à la PropBank
or FrameNet is beneficial (Bethard et al. 2004; Choi et al. 2006; Kim and Hovy 2006;
Gangemi et al. 2014), although Ruppenhofer et al. (2008) argue that evaluation that is
connected to its source indirectly via attribution poses challenges that go beyond the
capabilities of automatic semantic role labeling, and that discourse structure has to be
considered. Topic and aspect recognition, on the other hand, are seen as information

extraction tasks that generally exploit noun or noun phrases, dependency relations,
some syntactic patterns at the sentence level, knowledge representation paradigms (like
hierarchies or domain ontologies), and external sources (e.g., Wikipedia) to identify
explicit aspects (Hu and Liu 2004a; Popescu and Etzioni 2005; Zhao and Li 2009; Wu
et al. 2009).1

3.2.2 Sentiment Determination. Task (3), sentiment determination, is probably the most
studied. It consists of identifying polarity or orientation. In its simplest form, it corre-
sponds to the binary orientation (positive or negative) of a subjective span regardless
of external context within or outside a sentence or document. Some researchers argue
instead for a ternary classification, with a neutral category to indicate the absence of
evaluation (Koppel and Schler 2006; Agarwal et al. 2011). The intensity of a subjective
span is often combined with its prior binary polarity to form an evaluation score that
tells us about the degree of the evaluation, that is, how positive or negative the word is.
Several types of scales have been used in sentiment analysis research, going from con-
tinuous scales (Benamara et al. 2007) to discrete ones (Taboada et al. 2011). For example,
if we have a three-point scale to encode strength, we can propose score(good) = +1 and
score(brilliant) = +3. Generally, there is no consensus on how many points are needed
on the scale, but the chosen length of the scale has to ensure a trade-off between a
fine-grained categorization of subjective words and the reliability of this categorization
with respect to human judgments.

Two main approaches have been proposed, corpus-based (mostly using machine
learning techniques) and lexicon-based systems, which typically perform, in their most
simplistic form, a lexical lookup and combine the meaning of individual words to derive
the overall sentence or document sentiment (Hu and Liu 2004a; Kim and Hovy 2004;
Taboada et al. 2011). For example, Kim and Hovy (2004) propose a three-step algorithm
to compute sentence-level opinion orientation: First find the sentiment orientation of a
word using a propagation algorithm that estimates its polarity on the basis of paradig-
matic relations it may have with seed sentiments words, as encoded in WordNet. Then,
compute the sentence sentiment orientation. In this second step, only words that appear
near a holder and/or topic are considered. The sentiment scores of these words are
then combined with various aggregation functions (average, geometric mean, etc.). Hu
and Liu (2004a) propose a similar approach, taking into account in addition opposition
words (like but, however). They also generate a feature-based summary of each review.

At the sentence level, the task is to determine the subjective orientation and then
the opinion orientation of sequences of words in the sentence that are determined to
be subjective or express an opinion (Riloff and Wiebe 2003; Yu and Vasileios 2003;
Wiebe and Riloff 2005; Taboada et al. 2011), with the assumption that each sentence
usually contains a single opinion. To better compute the contextual polarity of opinion
expressions, some researchers have used subjectivity word sense disambiguation to
identify whether a given word has a subjective or an objective sense (Akkaya et al. 2009).
Other approaches identify valence shifters (negation, modality, and intensifiers) that
strengthen, weaken, or reverse the prior polarity of a word or an expression (Polanyi
and Zaenen 2006; Moilanen and Pulman 2007; Shaikh et al. 2007; Choi and Cardie 2008).
The contextual polarity of individual expressions is then used for sentence as well as
document classification (Kennedy and Inkpen 2006; Li et al. 2010).

At the document level, the standard task is either a classification problem, catego-
rizing documents globally as being positive, negative, or neutral towards a given topic
(Pang et al. 2002; Turney 2002; Mullen and Nigel 2004; Blitzer et al. 2007), or regression,
assigning a multi-scale rating to the document (Pang and Lee 2005; Goldberg and Zhu
2006; Snyder and Barzilay 2007; Lu et al. 2009; Lizhen et al. 2010; Leung et al. 2011;
Moghaddam and Ester 2011; Ganu et al. 2013).

The classification/regression approach to determining document sentiment typi-
cally uses bag-of-words representations (BOW), which model each text as a vector of the
number of occurrences, or the frequency with which each word/construction appears.
Bag-of-words features also include n-grams, parts of speech, and features that account
for the presence/absence of subjective words (including emoticons), or valence shifting
words (e.g., negation, intensifiers). Bags of words disregard grammar and cannot easily
move beyond the scope of the analyzed corpus. The approach is, however, quite simple
to implement and does keep token frequency. Bags of words are attractive because,
through feature reduction techniques, they reduce a large feature space of possibly
hundreds of thousands of dimensions to a manageable size that can help classifiers
boost their performance (Abbasi et al. 2008; Liang et al. 2015).

To account for word order, BOWs may include syntactic dependency relations that
rely on the assumption that specific syntactic phrases are likely to be used to express
opinions such as adjective–noun, subject–verb, or verb–object relationships (Dave et al.
2003; Gamon 2004; Matsumoto et al. 2005; Ng et al. 2006; Joshi and Penstein-Rosé 2009;
Xia and Zong 2010), thus becoming, more precisely, bags of phrases. These insights
on the types of structures that convey sentiment are the ones formalized in pattern
grammar (see Section 2.5). Experiments show a mitigated success. First of all, some de-
pendency relations are not frequent enough for the classifier to generalize well. Second,
dependencies provide only grammatical relations between words within a sentence,
but inter-sentential relations that may influence the sentence’s sentiment polarity are
not considered.

Bag-of-words approaches are popular in particular for long documents and very
large corpora, where classification accuracy can exceed 80%. The effectiveness of super-
vised learning, however, depends on the availability of labeled (sometimes unbalanced)
data in one domain that usually involves high costs in terms of work and time, because
it involves collecting and labeling data. In addition, some languages lack such resources.
To overcome this problem, unsupervised (Turney and Littman 2002; Feng et al. 2013) or
semi-supervised learning have been proposed. Semi-supervised learning methods use
a large amount of unlabeled data together with labeled data to build better classifiers
(Li et al. 2011; Täckström and McDonald 2011; Raksha et al. 2015; Yang et al. 2015).
Popular approaches include self-training (He and Zhou 2011), co-training (Wan 2009),
and structural learning methods that learn good functional structures using unlabeled
data (Ren et al. 2014).

A second problem with BOW approaches is that they are difficult to generalize,
since the interpretation of evaluative expressions is often domain or genre dependent.
For example, Aue and Gamon (2005) reported a loss in classifier accuracy (up to 20% to
30%) when training on movie review data and testing on book and product reviews.
Most of the classifiers built using movie review data suffer from bias toward that
genre, and they would not be able to capture the particular characteristics of other
types of text, such as formal reviews or blog posts. An alternative could involve us-
ing labeled data from a source domain to classify large amounts of unlabeled data
(documents/sentences) in a new target domain. According to Jiang and Zhai (2007)
and Xia et al. (2015), there are two methods to perform domain adaptation: instance

213



Computational Linguistics Volume 43, Number 1

adaptation, which approximates the target-domain distribution by assigning different
weights to the source domain labeled data, and labeling adaptation. The last one is the
most widely used in sentiment analysis (Blitzer et al. 2007; Pan et al. 2010; Samdani and
Yih 2011; Bollegala et al. 2013; Cambria and Hussain 2015). It aims at learning a new
labeling function for the target domain to account for those words that are assigned
different polarity labels. For example, long may be positive in the phone domain (long
battery life) and negative in the restaurant domain (long wait times). This means that
this method treats knowledge from every source domain as a valuable contribution
to the task on the target domain. However, in addition to data sampled from different
distributions (in the source and target domains), label adaptation approaches may suffer
from negative transfer where instead of improving performance, the transfer from other
domains degrades the performance on the target domain. One possible solution is active
learning, which relies on a small amount of good labeled data in the target domain to
quickly reduce the difference between the two domains (Rai et al. 2010; Li et al. 2013b).

Compared with machine learning, lexicon-based methods make use of the linguistic
information contained in the text that makes them more robust across different domains
(Kennedy and Inkpen 2006; Taboada et al. 2011). Furthermore, Brooke et al. (2009)
showed that porting dictionaries to a new language or a new domain is not an onerous
task, probably less onerous than labeling data in a new domain for a classifier. Com-
bining lexicon-based learning and corpus-based learning could be a good solution to
incorporate both domain-specific and domain-independent knowledge. This has been
investigated in several studies relying either on a complete lexicon or fully labeled
corpus (Andreevskaia and Bergler 2008; Qiu et al. 2009), or a partially labeled corpus
as training examples (Yang et al. 2015).

4. Towards a Dynamic Model of Evaluative Language

The model presented in Section 3, where evaluation = (e, a, s, h, t), is an operationalized
representation that views sentiment analysis as an information extraction task. The
model builds a structured representation from any unstructured evaluative text that
captures the core elements relative to the evaluations expressed in the text. Liu (2012)
points out that not all applications need all five elements of the quintuple. In some
cases, it is hard to distinguish between entity and aspect, or there is no need to deal
with aspect. In other cases, opinion holder or time can be ignored.

Although this model covers the essential elements for dealing with evaluative
language in real scenarios, we argue that it is rather static because linguistic and extra-
linguistic contextual factors that directly impact one or several elements of the quintuple
are hidden in the structured representation. We show in Section 4.1 that each element
is context-dependent at different linguistic levels and that a new dynamic model that
explicitly incorporates context is necessary. We think that such a dynamic model needs
to combine two complementary perspectives: a conceptual one, allowing for a theoretical
characterization of the problem from a linguistic point of view, and a computational
one, allowing computer algorithms to easily operationalize the extraction process. To
this end, we propose extending Liu’s (2012) model to account for the semantic and
pragmatic contribution that an evaluative sentence or a clause makes to a discourse in
terms of a relation between an input context prior to the sentence and an output context.
This new characterization of evaluative language falls within the dynamic semantics
paradigm (Kamp and Reyle 1993) and will offer the basis for investigating, detecting,
and formalizing various discursive and pragmatic aspects of evaluation.

214



Benamara, Taboada, and Mathieu Evaluative Language Beyond Bags of Words

In this section, we first motivate why a new model is needed, discuss some of the
quintuple elements, and then present a new dynamic definition of evaluative language.

4.1 Motivation

Holder (h) and topic + aspect (e, a). Aspects may be explicit or implicit (Hu and Liu 2004a).
Explicit aspects appear as nouns or noun phrases, as in The characters are great, which
explicitly refers to the movie characters. Implicit aspects are generally inferred from
the text through common sense or pragmatic knowledge, as in the restaurant review in
Example (3), where the pronoun it does not refer to the potential antecedent new vegan
restaurant, but to an implicit aspect of a restaurant, its food. This is a form of bridging
inference (Haviland and Clark 1974).

(3) We went to the new vegan restaurant yesterday. It was all too raw and chewy
for me.

Despite substantial progress in the field, implicit topic/aspect identification as well
as complex explicit aspects (which use, for example, verbal constructions) remain un-
solved. See Section 6.2 for a survey of the existing work that tackles this hard problem.

In addition to the explicit vs. implicit nature of aspects, the way holders, topics, and
aspects are extracted heavily depends on the corpus genre. For example, review-style
corpora typically discuss one main topic and its related aspects and are the viewpoints
of one holder (the review writer). Other corpus genres, however, do not meet these
characteristics. Some are author-oriented like blogs where all the documents (posts and
comments) can be attributed to the blogs’ owners. A blogger, for example, may compare
two different products in the same post. Others are both multi-topic and multi-holder
documents like news articles, where each pair (topic, holder) has its own evaluation,
which means that different quintuples are needed to account for opinions about differ-
ent topics (old or new) and from different holders. In addition, social media corpora are
composed of follow-up evaluations, where topics are dynamic over conversation threads
(i.e., not necessarily known in advance). For example, posts on a forum or tweets are
often responses to earlier posts, and the lack of context makes it difficult for machines
to figure out whether the post is in agreement or disagreement. Finally, in a multi-topic
setting, the author introduces and elaborates on a main topic, switches to other related
topics, or reverts back to an older topic. This is known as discourse popping, where a
topic switch is signaled by the fact that the new information does not attach to the prior
clause, but rather to an earlier one that dominates it (Asher and Lascarides 2003).

Investigating evaluations toward a given topic and how related topics influence
the holder’s evaluation on this main topic is an interesting and challenging research
problem (He et al. 2013). Multi-topic sentiment analysis is generally seen as a special
case of multi-aspect sentiment analysis (Hu and Liu 2004b; Zhao et al. 2010). With the
rise of social media, tracking follow-up evaluations and how they change towards a
topic over time has become very popular (Wang et al. 2012; Farzindar and Inkpen 2015).
See also Section 6.4 on the contribution of social network structure to sentiment analysis.

Sentiment (s). Polarized evaluative expressions may be explicit or implicit. The former
are triggered by specific subjective words or symbols (adjectives, adverbs, verbs, nouns,
interjections, emoticons, etc.), whereas the latter, also known as fact-implied opinions
(Liu 2012), are triggered by situations that describe a desirable or an undesirable activity
or state. These situations are understood to be evaluative on the basis of pragmatic,
cultural, or common knowledge shared by authors and readers. For example, there

215



Computational Linguistics Volume 43, Number 1

are three evaluative expressions in the movie review in Example (4): The first two are
positive explicit expressions (underlined), whereas the last one (in italics) is an implicit
positive opinion. Not moving from one’s seat is not inherently positive or negative; it
only becomes positive in the context of watching a movie.

(4) What a great animated movie. I was so scared the whole time that I didn’t even

move from my seat.

Compared with explicit evaluation, little work has been done on implicit eval-
uation, mainly because it is difficult to discriminate between explicit, implicit, and
objective statements, even for humans (see Section 6.2). Obviously, the treatment of
explicit evaluation is not always easy, especially when complex linguistic devices are
used. Consider, for example, the ironic statement in Example (5). The overall evaluation
is negative even though there are no explicit negative words. In this construction, the
author conveys a message that fails to make sense against the context. The excerpt
in Example (6) illustrates another interesting phenomenon particularly common in
reviews, named thwarted expectations, where the author sets up a deliberate contrast
to the preceding discourse (Pang et al. 2002; Turney 2002). This example contains four
opinions: The first three are strongly negative whereas the last one (introduced by the
conjunction but in the last sentence) is positive. A bag of words approach would classify
this review as negative. An aspect-based sentiment analysis system would probably
do better, by classifying the last sentence as being positive towards the TV series and
the first three as negative towards particular aspects of the series. This is, in part, the
counter-expectation strategy discussed within Appraisal as a way of flagging invoked
Appraisal (Martin and White 2005). It is obvious from these examples that the s part of
the definition of evaluation is context dependent.

(5) I love when my phone turns the volume down automatically.

(6) The characters are unpleasant. The scenario is totally absurd. The decoration
seems to be made of cardboard. But, all these elements make the charm of this
TV series.

Polarity (o) and Intensity (i). Sentiment s is further defined by Liu (2012) as a triple of
y = type of sentiment; o = orientation or polarity; and i = intensity of the opinion (cf.
Section 3.1). With respect to polarity, the prior polarity of a word, that is, its polarity
in the dictionary sense, may be different from contextual polarity, which is determined
on the basis of a sentiment composition process that captures how opinion expressions
interact with each other and with specific linguistic operators such as intensifiers, nega-
tion, or modality (Polanyi and Zaenen 2006; Moilanen and Pulman 2007; Wilson et al.
2009). For instance, in This restaurant is not good enough, the prior positive orientation of
the word good has to be combined with the negation not and the modifier enough. Apart
from local linguistic operators, prior polarity may also vary according to the context
outside of the utterance, including domain factors (Aue and Gamon 2005; Blitzer et al.
2007; Bollegala et al. 2011). A given span may be subjective in one context and objec-
tive in another. Haas and Versley (2015) observe that seemingly neutral adjectives can
become polar when combined with aspects of a movie (elaborate continuation, expanded
vision), as can words that are intensified (simply intrusive was considered negative, but
intrusive was neutral). Even if there is any ambiguity on the subjectivity status of a word,
orientation can be highly context-dependent: A horrible movie may be positive if it is a
thriller, but negative in a romantic comedy. Additionally, out of context, some subjective
expressions can have both positive and negative orientations. This is particularly salient

216



Benamara, Taboada, and Mathieu Evaluative Language Beyond Bags of Words

for expressions of surprise and astonishment as in This movie surprised me. The way
evaluative language is used depends also on cultural or social differences, which makes
polarity vary according to a specific situation, group, or culture. For instance, Thompson
and Alba-Juez (2014) point out that utterances such as Yeah and right, depending on the
situation, the kind of speaker, and the way in which they are spoken, may be intended as
positive signs of agreement or as very negative disagreement. Liu (2015) also points out
that there may be a difference between author and reader standpoints: A small restaurant
does not convey a universal negative feeling.

Another interesting property of evaluative language is its multi-dimensional na-
ture. Apart from the traditional binary categorization (positive vs. negative) of eval-
uation towards a given target, researchers have suggested that sentiment analysis is
a quantification task, one where the goal is not to classify an individual text, but to
estimate the percentage of texts that are positive or negative (Esuli and Sebastiani
2015). Evaluative language may also take several other forms. For example, evalua-
tion involving comparatives expresses an ordering towards targets based on some of
their shared aspects, for example, the picture quality of camera X is better than that of Y
(Jindal and Liu 2006a, 2006b). There are also evaluations that concern relative judgment
towards actions or intentions, preferring them or not over others (e.g., I prefer the first
season over the second one, or Shall we see Game of Thrones next week?). In this last case,
reasoning about preferences determines an order over outcomes that predicts how a
rational agent will act (Cadilhac et al. 2012; Chen et al. 2013). Other forms of evalu-
ative language involve finding a consensus or conflict over participants by identifying
agreement/disagreement on a given topic in a debate or discussion (Somasundaran and
Wiebe 2009; Mukherjee and Bhattacharyya 2012). We address preferences and intentions
in Section 6.5.

4.2 A New Dynamic Model of Evaluative Language

We hope to have established by now that evaluative language is context-dependent at
different discourse organization levels:

r The sentence: Interactions with linguistic operators like negation,
modality, and intensifiers; or syntactic constraints such as altering the
order of constituents in a clause or sentence.

r The document: Discourse connectives, discourse structure, rhetorical
relations, topicality.

r Beyond the document:2 Effects of various pragmatic phenomena such as
common-sense knowledge, domain dependency, genre bias, cultural and
social constraints, time constraints.

Inspired by Polanyi and Zaenen’s (2006) first attempt to study contextual valence
shifting phenomena, as well as recent linguistic studies on evaluation (Thompson and
Alba-Juez 2014) that characterize it as a dynamic phenomenon, we propose a more
flexible and abstract model of evaluative language that extends Liu’s (2012) model to

2 We will use terms such as document and text throughout, but we believe that most of what we discuss here
applies equally to spoken language, which has further special characteristics (prosody, pitch, gesture).

217



Computational Linguistics Volume 43, Number 1

take into account context. The model is represented as a system of two main components
〈Ω, ℑ〉, where:

r Ω = (e, a, s, h) is a quadruple that corresponds to the intrinsic properties of
evaluative language (target, aspect, sentiment, and holder). The sentiment
element s is additionally composed of a quadruple (span, category, pol, val)
to encode span (the evaluative expression), semantic category, polarity,
and strength. Elements of Ω resemble those of Liu (2012), except that we
restrict s to textual spans composed of explicit subjective tokens only
(adjectives, verbs, nouns, adverbs, emoticons), excluding local operators at
the sentence level. The aim is to explicitly separate the prior sentiment
orientation of s (i.e., its value out of context) from its contextual
interpretation that is considered to be part of the extrinsic properties of
evaluation (see ℑ below). In addition, polarity (pol) is used as an umbrella
term that covers any polarized scale in order to extend the traditional
positive/negative categorization. Polarized scales may be
positive–negative, for–against, positive–neutral–negative, or any number
of stars in a star scale. If any of the four elements of Ω is not lexicalized,
then their corresponding values are underspecified.3

r A set of functions ℑ = {F1, . . . , Fn} that capture the extrinsic properties of an
evaluation by adjusting or adapting the prior values of Ω when they are
interpreted in a given context, such that ∀Fi ∈ ℑ, Fi : Ω 7→ Updatel(Ω).
These functions act as complex update operators at different discourse
organization levels l (sentence, document, beyond the document), and
their interpretation reflects the special influence that they have on
evaluative expressions. For example, at the sentence level, one can design
a function to account for the role of negation or modality. At the document
level, functions may use discourse relations or argumentative structure to
update the prior polarity of an evaluation. At the extra-linguistic level,
some functions can account for the conversation thread. We expressively
avoid defining all the functions that may be included in ℑ, so that users
can specify them according to need and available NLP techniques. Not all
functions are necessary for all applications, and some of them can be
left out.

Let us illustrate this model with Example (4), reproduced again as Example (7). We
explain how the model behaves when applied at the sentence level,4 but it can also be
easily applied at a finer or more-coarse grained level.

(7) What a great animated movie. I was so scared the whole time that I didn’t even
move from my seat.

In Example (7), the immediate interpretation of great in the first sentence leads to a
positive evaluation that remains stable after updating the intrinsic property of polarity,
i.e., Ω1 = Update(Ω1) = (movie, , (great, ,+,1), author). In the second sentence, the sen-

3 Note that we do not include a time dimension in our definition for simplicity purposes. In cases where
time is important, an element t may be added.

4 In this example, we deliberately leave the sentiment semantic category underspecified. For strength, we
use a discrete scale.

218



Benamara, Taboada, and Mathieu Evaluative Language Beyond Bags of Words

timent span scared is generally given a negative evaluation out of context, Ω2 = (movie,
, (scared, ,−,1), author). At the sentence level, the evaluation in scared is influenced by

the adverb so, which modifies the prior intensity of the evaluation: Updatesentence(Ω2) =
(movie, , (so scared, ,−,2), author). Then, if one takes into account the discursive
context given by the first sentence, the prior polarity of scared has to be updated:
Updatediscourse(Ω2) = (movie, , (so scared, ,+,2), author). Finally, the pragmatic level
tells us about the presence of an additional positive evaluation, as already explained in
the previous section: Updatepragmatic(Ω2) = (movie, , {(so scared, ,+,2), (didn’t move...seat,

,+,2)}, author).
In practical sentiment analysis systems, the complete instantiation of the model

〈Ω, ℑ〉 depends on their context-sensitiveness. As far as we know, no existing system
deals simultaneously with all levels of context. Most systems are either static and
context insensitive, or they exploit one or two levels at most. Some deal with local
factors at the sentence level, for example, the presence of negation in the proximity
of polarized words using dependency parsing; others deal with discourse; whereas
others deal with domain and genre factors, or figurative language. Overall, two main
directions have been explored to deal with context: (a) extend the bag-of-words model
by incorporating more contextual information; and (b) combine theories and knowl-
edge from linguistics with the statistical exploitation of data. In the next two sections,
we explore these two directions, focusing on how sentiment analysis systems can be
made much more effective and accurate by explicitly considering context in its wider
sense. We investigate several dimensions of context, and for each dimension, we outline
which linguistic aspects contribute to accurate extraction of sentiment.

5. Current Approaches: From Lexical Semantics to the Sentence

The sentiment analysis problem can be described as the process of moving from the
bottom–up, starting at the word level and ending with context. In this section, we
describe how sentiment is expressed and extracted at the word, phrase, and sentence
levels, and in the next section we address discourse and contextual phenomena.

5.1 Lexical Semantics of Evaluative Expressions

Finding subjective words (and their associated prior polarity) is an active research topic
where both corpus-based and lexicon-based approaches have been deployed. There are
several manually or automatically created lexical resources. Most of them share four
main characteristics: They are domain-and language-specific, of limited coverage, and
they group evaluative expressions along a binary positive/negative axis.

Domain adaptation has been extensively studied in the literature (cf. Section 3.2
for a discussion). Language adaptation often consists of transferring knowledge from a
resource-rich language such as English to a language with fewer resources, using par-
allel corpora or standard machine translation techniques (Mihalcea et al. 2007; Abbasi
et al. 2008; Balahur et al. 2012; Balahur and Perea-Ortega 2015; Gao et al. 2015). Other ap-
proaches make few assumptions about available resources by using a holistic statistical
model that discovers connections across languages (Boyd-Graber and Resnik 2010). Un-
der the assumption that similar terms have similar emotional or subjective orientation
(Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown 1997), lexicon expansion techniques grow an initial
set of subjective seed words by diverse semantic similarity metrics. These techniques
may also exploit word relationships such as synonyms, antonyms, and hypernyms

within general linguistic resources such as WordNet, or syntactic properties such as
dependency relations.5 Compared with lexicon expansion and domain and language
adaptation, few studies propose to enhance the binary categorization of evaluative
expressions. In the remainder of this section, we focus on these studies, as we believe
they can be beneficial to subjective lexicon creation. Studies can be roughly divided
into how they approach categorization of lexical expressions: by tackling intensity, emo-
tion, and either syntactic or semantic principles for classification (including Appraisal
categories).

5.1.1 Intensity-Based Categorizations. One way to improve upon simple polarity determi-
nation is to associate with each subjective entry an evaluation score or intensity level.
SentiWordnet (Baccianella et al. 2010) is an extension of WordNet (Fellbaum 1998) that
assigns to each synset three sentiment scores: positive (P), negative (N), and objective
(O). Hence different senses of the same term may have different sentiment scores. For
example, the adjective happy has four senses: The first two expressing joy or pleasure
are highly positive (P = 0.875 and P = 0.75, respectively); the third corresponding to
eagerly disposed to act or to be of service (as in happy to help) is ambiguous (P = 0.5 and
O = 0.5); and the last sense (a happy turn of phrase) is likely to be objective (P = 0.125
and O = 0.875). Although SentiWordNet has been successfully deployed to derive
document-level sentiment orientation (Denecke 2009; Martin-Wanton et al. 2010; Popat
et al. 2013; Manoussos et al. 2014), word-sense disambiguation algorithms are often
needed to find the right sense of a given term. Other intensity-based lexicons in English
include Q-WordNet (Agerri and Garcı́a-Serrano 2010), the MPQA Subjectivity Lexicon
(Wiebe et al. 2005), and SO-CAL (Taboada et al. 2011).

Methods for automatic ordering of polar adjectives according to their intensity
include pattern-based approaches, assuming one single intensity-scale for all adjec-
tives (de Melo and Bansal 2013), or corpus-driven techniques, providing intensity
levels to adjectives that bear the same semantic property (Ruppenhofer et al. 2014;
Sharma et al. 2015).

5.1.2 Emotion and Affect Categorizations. A second way to enhance polarity consists of
encoding, in addition to polarity and/or intensity, information about the semantic cat-
egory of the evaluative expression. Categories can be defined according to psychologi-
cally based classifications of emotions and affect of various sorts that attempt to group
evaluation into a set of basic emotions such as anger, fear, surprise, or love (Osgood
et al. 1957; Izard 1971; Russell 1983; Ekman 1984; Ortony et al. 1988). Well-known
Affect resources in English include the General Inquier (Stone et al. 1962), the Affective
Norms for English Words (ANEW) (Bradley and Lang 1999), the LIWC Dictionary,6 and
the LEW list (Francisco et al. 2010). WordNet-Affect is also a resource for the lexical
representation of affective knowledge (Strapparava and Valitutti 2004). It associates
with each affective synset from WordNet an emotion class, following the classes defined
within Ortony et al.’s (1988) model of emotions. Other interesting affective resources
are SenticNet (Poria et al. 2013) and the EmotiNet knowledge base (Balahur et al.
2011), which associates polarity and affective information with affective situations such
as accomplishing a goal, failing an exam, or celebrating a special occasion. Modeling such
situations is particularly important for recognizing implicit emotions (Balahur et al.

2012). Besides the obvious usefulness of affect lexicons in emotion detection, their use
in sentiment analysis tasks has shown to be helpful (Agarwal et al. 2009), especially in
figurative language detection (Reyes and Rosso 2012) (see Section 6.3).

The choice of the right resources to use generally depends on the task and the
corpus genre. Musto et al. (2014) compare the effectiveness of SentiWordNet, WordNet-
Affect, MPQA, and SenticNet for sentiment classification of Twitter posts. Their results
show that MPQA and SentiWordNet performed the best. This is interesting because
although MPQA is a lexicon with small coverage, its results are comparable to a general-
purpose lexicon like SentiWordNet. To overcome coverage limitation, one can consider
combining several lexicons. This can, however, lead to polarity inconsistency, where
the same word appears with different polarities in different dictionaries. Dragut et al.
(2012) point out that sentiment dictionaries have two main problems: They exhibit
substantial (intra-dictionary) inaccuracies, and have (inter-dictionary) inconsistencies.
They propose a method to detect polarity assignment inconsistencies for the words
and synsets within and across dictionaries.

5.1.3 Syntactic and Semantic Categorizations. Other categories have been proposed in
the literature to deal with the complex lexical semantics of evaluative expressions.
Some are both syntactically and semantically driven, whereas others are exclusively
semantic. Levin (1993) classifies over 3,000 English verbs according to shared meaning
and syntactic behavior. She examines verb behavior with respect to a wide range of
syntactic alternations that reflect verb meaning. Several classes are sentiment relevant
such as Judgment Verbs or Verbs of Psychological State. Mathieu (2005) offers a semantic
classification of sentiment in which verbs and nouns are split into 38 semantic classes,
according to their meaning (Love, Fear, Astonish, etc.). She points out that syntactic
structure influences the interpretation of evaluative expressions and distinguishes be-
tween three classes of verbs that mean: The experience or the causation of a rather
unpleasant feeling, pleasant feeling, and neither pleasant nor unpleasant. Semantic
classes are linked by meaning, intensity, and antonymy relationships. She associates a
set of linguistic properties with words and classes and builds semantic representations,
described by means of feature structures. Mathieu and Fellbaum (2010) extended this
classification to English verbs of emotion.

SentiFrameNet (Ruppenhofer and Rehbein 2012) is probably the best example of
the syntactico-semantic categorization of evaluative expressions. It extends FrameNet
(Baker et al. 1998) to connect opinion source and target to semantic roles, and to add
semantic features such as polarity, intensity, and affectedness (changes of state that leave
an event participant in a changed state). Evaluative language per se is not described
in FrameNet, but several frames are relevant for sentiment analysis like JUDGMENT,
OPINION, EMOTION DIRECTED, and semantic roles such as JUDGE or EXPERIENCER.
Each frame is associated with a set of lexical units composed of words that evoke that
frame. Example (8) illustrates the frame elements of the lexical unit splendid (from the
frame DESIRABILITY).

(8) [On clear days,]Circumstance [the view]Evaluee was [absolutely]Degree splendid.

Ruppenhofer and Rehbein (2012) argue that a frame-based representation of evaluative
language is suitable for capturing multi-word evaluative expressions and idioms such
as give away the store and sentiment composition. However, apart from using semantic
frames for identifying the topics (or targets) of sentiment (Kim and Hovy 2006) and
deriving an intensity-based sentiment lexicon (Raksha et al. 2015), little work has been

221



Computational Linguistics Volume 43, Number 1

done to show the real effectiveness of this deep representation in practical sentiment
analysis systems.

Purely semantic categorizations include the categories defined within the MPQA
project (Wiebe et al. 2005), and the Blogoscopy lexicon (Daille et al. 2011), which
classifies opinions according to four main categories following Charaudeau (1992),
and the lexicon model for subjectivity description of Dutch verbs proposed by Maks
and Vossen (2012). Drawing from Levin (1993), Mathieu (2005), and Wierzbicka (1987),
Asher et al. (2009) group each opinion expression into four main categories: REPORTING,
which provides, at least indirectly, a judgment by the author on the opinion expressed;
JUDGMENT, which contains normative evaluations of objects and actions; ADVICE,
which describes an opinion on a course of action for the reader; and SENTIMENT-
APPRECIATION, containing feelings and appreciations. Subcategories include, for ex-
ample, INFORM, ASSERT, EVALUATION, FEAR, ASTONISHMENT, BLAME, and so forth.
These categories have been successfully deployed as features for consensus detection in
book reviews (Benamara et al. 2014) and for studying opinion in discourse (Benamara
et al. 2016). Also, the ADVICE category, which is decomposed into SUGGEST, HOPE,
and RECOMMEND, has been used for extracting customer suggestions from reviews
(Negi and Buitelaar 2015). We further discuss discourse-based sentiment analysis and
suggestion detection in Section 6.

Even though efforts have been made to move beyond positive/negative classifica-
tion, the resulting lexicons are not widely used in the sentiment analysis community. We
do believe that the semantic categorizations discussed in this section are necessary for a
better understanding of evaluative language and hope that further studies will leverage
such categorizations to enhance current bag-of-words approaches. One categorization
that deserves separate treatment, because of its comprehensiveness, is Appraisal. After
an introduction to the theory itself in Section 2.6, in the next section we discuss compu-
tational treatments of Appraisal.

5.1.4 Semantic Categorizations: Appraisal in Sentiment Analysis. An early surge of interest
in Appraisal led to publications proposing how to automatically identify expressions
that could be characterized as belonging to the three subtypes of Attitude (Affect,
Judgment, and Appreciation). The potential gains are obvious: A positive or a negative
expression is informative in itself, but even more so if we know whether it refers to
personal feelings, opinions about others, or evaluations of objects. Taboada and Grieve
(2004) first proposed a classification of adjectives as to whether they mostly conveyed
one of the three main Attitude categories (Affect, Judgment, Appreciation). They then
used this classification of adjectives to determine what type of Attitude was predomi-
nant in a text.

Whitelaw et al. (2005) investigated the use of Appraisal groups or phrases for
sentiment analysis. They also classified adjectives according to three Attitude cate-
gories. Using a combination of manual methods and thesauri crawling, they built a
list of 1,329 adjectives. They then used this information to extract Appraisal groups, in
particular, adjective groups that may include intensifiers and negation (e.g., very good,
not terribly funny). The resulting Appraisal groups are fed into a classifier to train a
system that identifies movie reviews as positive or negative. Whitelaw et al. found
that using Appraisal groups improved the classification over baselines that utilized
bag-of-words features. It is clear from their results that using adjectives that can be
classified as conveying appraisal values is beneficial in sentiment analysis. In particular,
and unsurprisingly, adjectives labeled as Appreciation are some of the most useful
features for the classifier. Further analysis showed that bag-of-words features contribute

222



Benamara, Taboada, and Mathieu Evaluative Language Beyond Bags of Words

positively to the classification in part because they contain sentiment words that are
not adjectives.

Although it was a breakthrough in terms of using sentiment-specific adjectives,
and using linguistic insights (phrases rather than isolated adjectives; intensification
and negation), the work of Whitelaw and colleagues did not explicitly utilize the in-
formation contained in the Appraisal groups. That is, whether a text contained more
Appreciation than Judgment, for instance, was not part of the classification or the infor-
mation extracted from the text. The authors do point out potential benefits of Appraisal
analysis, including identifying the Appraiser and Appraised (what elsewhere have been
termed source and target). Similar work by Read and Carroll uses a corpus annotated for
Appraisal (not only Attitude, but also Graduation and Engagement) to train a classifier
that detects whether unseen words and phrases are instances of Appraisal and, when
they are, their polarity (Read and Carroll 2012b, 2012a).

Work by Argamon, Bloom, and colleagues (Bloom et al. 2007; Argamon et al. 2009;
Bloom and Argamon 2010) also focused on using Appraisal to build lexicons. Of note
is the effort in Bloom et al. (2007) to extract adjectives according to Appraisal categories
(the three top-level Attitude types) and present them as output (rather than just use
them as input to build a lexicon). Furthermore, their system assigns a target to each
adjective, specifying whether, for example, it refers to an actor, a character, or the plot
or special effects of a movie. This linking of Appraisal expression and target is achieved
via dependency parsing. Their method seems to perform well, as shown by a manual
evaluation of the extracted expressions, and by its potential usefulness in creating rules
for opinion patterns. In a follow-up paper, Bloom and Argamon (2010) present an
automatic method for linking Appraisal expressions and patterns.

Such linking of Appraisal expressions and targets precedes later work in feature-
based sentiment extraction or opinion mining (Titov and McDonald 2008; Brody and
Elhadad 2010; Liu 2012), which seems to have developed independently, and without
taking into account the possibility of bootstrapping the identification of features with
Appraisal expressions. Information on whether an Appraisal expression is likely to be
Judgement rather than Appreciation will help determine whether its target is human or
not, and vice versa.

A notable exception in the practical application of Appraisal is the Attitude Analysis
Model of Neviarouskaya and colleagues (Neviarouskaya 2010; Neviarouskaya et al.
2010b, 2010a; Neviarouskaya and Aono 2013). They propose a method of assigning
what are essentially Attitude values to adjectives. In their system, a classifier is trained
to determine whether a particular word or phrase expresses the three basic types of
Attitude, with the determination being done in context, that is, taking into account the
sentence in which the word appears.

In summary, we see Appraisal analysis as a richer, more detailed analysis that
goes beyond simple polarity labels, and that can help characterize texts across sev-
eral categories. Once more data and resources become available, automatic analysis of
Appraisal is possible. This would enable the presentation of Appraisal information as
part of the process of sentiment analysis. Just as some systems break down lengthy
reviews and provide information on features or aspects (such as service, food or am-
biance for a restaurant), a review can be further characterized according to Appraisal
categories, specifying, for instance, whether it contains more Affect than Judgment,
or an unusally high frequency of graduated terms (indicating a particularly strong
opinion). Current research, however, does not seem to be making use of Appraisal, and
it is unclear how significant the improvements may be for simple binary classification
systems.

5.2 Valence Shifters

The term valence shifters was first used by Polanyi and Zaenen (2006) to describe
how an evaluation expression can be modified by context, including extra-propositional
aspects of meaning, intensification, downtoning, presuppositions, discourse, and irony.
This section focuses on valence shifters that may impact evaluative expressions at the
sentence or the sub-sentential level.

Dealing with valence shifters roughly involves three sub-tasks: identifying these
expressions and their scope, analyzing their effect on evaluation, and computing sen-
timent composition, leveraging this effect to update the prior polarity of opinion ex-
pressions. The first task makes use of full sentence parsing or dependency parsing to
identify the scope of cues (Councill et al. 2010; Wiegand et al. 2010; Velldall et al. 2012).
We detail in the following sections the latter two tasks.

Intensification and downtoning. Whatever parts of speech are identified as conveying
sentiment, they can be intensified and downtoned by being modified. The general term
intensifier is used for devices that change the intensity of an individual word, whether
by bringing it up or down. Many devices intensify; for instance, adjectives may intensify
or downtone the noun they accompany (a definite success). Periphrastic expressions and
hedges also change the intensity of other words, as is the case with in a way or for the
most part.

Intensification, however, is mostly expressed via adverbs. Syntactically, adverbs
may appear in different positions in a sentence. For example, they could occur as
complements or modifiers of verbs (he behaved badly), modifiers of nouns (only adults),
adjectives (a very dangerous trip), adverbs (very nicely), and clauses (undoubtedly, he was
right). Adverbs of degree and manner have been the most studied, as they are most
sentiment relevant. Taking them into account has consistently been shown to improve
the performance of sentiment analysis systems (Kennedy and Inkpen 2006; Benamara
et al. 2007; Taboada et al. 2011).

The effect of intensifiers and downtoners on evaluative language is generally mod-
eled as a linear model using addition or subtraction. For example, if a positive adjective
has a value of 2, an amplified (or positively intensified) adjective would become 3, and
the downtoned version a 1. Intensifiers, however, do not all intensify at the same level.
For instance, consider the difference between extraordinarily and rather. The value of
the word being intensified also plays a role. A word at the higher end of the scale
is probably intensified more intensely, as can be seen in the difference between truly
fantastic and truly okay. In fact, the latter is probably often used ironically. A method of
modeling these differences is to use multiplication rather than addition. For example,
Taboada et al. (2011) place intensifiers on a percentage scale, proposing values such as
the following: most+100%, really +25%, very +15%, somewhat −30%, and arguably−20%.

Extra-propositional aspects of meaning. These are aspects of meaning that convey infor-
mation beyond the propositional content of a clause or sentence (i.e., beyond simple,
categorical assertions), but are still within the realm of syntax, not discourse.

Nonveridicality is an example of such aspects (see Section 2.3). It can be used to
express possibility, necessity, permission, obligation, or desire, and it is grammatically
expressed via adverbial phrases (perhaps, maybe, certainly), conditional verb mood, some
modals (must, can, may), and intensional verbs (think, believe). Adjectives and nouns

224

5.2.1 Effect of Valence Shifters on Sentiment Analysis



Benamara, Taboada, and Mathieu Evaluative Language Beyond Bags of Words

can also express modality (a probable cause; It remains a possibility). A general consensus
in sentiment analysis is that nonveridicality and irrealis result in the unreliability of
any expression of sentiment in the sentences containing it (Wilson et al. 2009; Taboada
et al. 2011; Benamara et al. 2012; Morante and Sporleder 2012b; Denis et al. 2014).
Consider the effect of the intensional verb thought and the modal would in Example (9)
and the modal plus question in Example (10), which completely discount any positive
evaluation that may be present in good and more suitable. In some cases, however, eval-
uative expressions under the scope of modality do not have to be ignored (Benamara
et al. 2012). This is true for the cumulative modality in Example (11) and the use of
negation in Example (12), where the deontic modal should strengthens the negative
recommendation.

(9) I thought this movie would be as good as the Grinch.

(10) Couldn’t you find a more suitable ending?

(11) You definitely must see this movie.

(12) You should not go see this movie.

Not enough research has explored exactly how evaluative expressions are affected
in the presence of nonveridical operators. In de Marneffe et al. (2012), nonveridicality is
characterized as a distribution over veridicality categories, rather than a binary classifi-
cation, which would make accurate identification of nonveridical statements even more
challenging. Liu et al. (2014) automatically determine whether opinions expressed in
sentences with modality are positive, negative, or neutral.

Negation is another linguistic phenomenon that affects evaluative expressions lo-
cally. In Example (13), the negation not conveys a mild positive evaluation by negating
a negative item (bad), or the opposite, using a negated positive to express a negative
evaluation (cf. Example (14)). The effect of negation seems to be one of downtoning the
overall effect of the evaluation, whether positive or negative. This is a form of litotes,
the negation of the opposite meaning to the one intended, often for rhetorical effect.

(13) This student is not bad.

(14) It hasn’t been my best day.

Negation can be used to deny or reject statements. It is grammatically expressed via
a variety of forms: prefixes (un-, il-), suffixes (-less), content word negators such as not,
and negative polarity items (NPIs) like any, anything, ever. NPIs are words or idioms that
appear in negative sentences, but not in their affirmative counterparts, or in questions
but not in assertions (which also makes them nonveridical markers). Negation can be
expressed using nouns or verbs that have negation as part of their lexical semantics
(abate or eliminate). It can also be expressed implicitly without using any negative words,
as in This restaurant was below my expectations. Negation can aggregate in a variety of
ways. In some languages, multiple negatives cancel the effect of negation (This restaurant
never fails to disappoint on flavor), whereas in negative-concord languages like French,
multiple negations usually intensify the effect of negation. Compared to negators and
content word negators, NPIs and multiple negatives have received less attention in the
sentiment analysis literature. Taboada et al. (2011) treat NPIs (as well as modalities) as
irrealis blockers by ignoring the semantic orientation of sentiment words in their scope.
For example, the adjective good will just be ignored in Any good movie in this theater. In
contrast, Benamara et al. (2012) consider that NPIs strengthen expressions under their
scope. They observe that most multiple negatives preserve polarity, except for those

225



Computational Linguistics Volume 43, Number 1

composed of content word negators and NPIs that cancel the effect of lexical negations.
For example in the French expression manque de goût (‘lack of taste’), the polarity is
negative, while in ne manque pas de goût (roughly, ‘no lack of taste’), the opinion is
positive.

Another notable aspect of negation is its markedness. Negative statements tend to
be perceived as more marked than their affirmative counterparts, both pragmatically
and psychologically (Osgood and Richards 1973; Horn 1989). Potts (2010) posits an emer-
gent expressivity for negation and negative polarity, observing that negative statements
are less frequent and pragmatically more negative, with emphatic and attenuating
polarity items modulating such negativity in a systematic way. Research in sentiment
analysis has found that accurately identifying negative sentiment is more difficult, per-
haps because we use fewer negative terms and because negative evaluation is couched
in positive terms (Pang and Lee 2008, Chapter 3). One way to solve this problem is to,
in a sense, follow the Negativity Bias (Rozin and Royzman 2001; Jing-Schmidt 2007): If
a negative word appears, then it has more impact. This has been achieved by weighing
negative words more heavily than positives in aggregation (Taboada et al. 2011).

Most approaches treat negation as polarity reversal (Wilson et al. 2005; Polanyi and
Zaenen 2006; Moilanen and Pulman 2007; Choi and Cardie 2008). However, negation
cannot be reduced to reversing polarity. For example, if we assume that the score of the
adjective excellent is +3, then the opinion score in This student is not excellent cannot be
−3. The sentence probably means that the student is not good enough. It is thus difficult
to negate a strongly positive word without implying that a less positive one is to some
extent possible (not excellent, but not horrible either). A possible solution is to use shift
negation, in which the effect of a negator is to shift the negated term in the scale by a
certain amount, but without making it the polar opposite of the original term (Liu and
Seneff 2009; Taboada et al. 2011; Chardon et al. 2013a).

5.2.2 Sentiment Composition. Sentiment composition aims at computing the sentiment
orientation of an expression or a sentence (in terms of polarity and/or strength) on the
basis of the sentiment orientation of its constituents. This process, based on the principle
of compositionality (Dowty et al. 1981), captures how opinion expressions interact with
each other and with specific linguistic operators such as intensifiers, negations, or
modalities. For instance, the sentiment expressed in the sentence This restaurant is good
but expensive is a combination of the prior sentiment orientation of the words good, but,
and expensive.

A prior step to this process is to perform syntactic parsing to determine the scope
of valence shifters and then use syntax to do compositional sentiment analysis. Jia et al.
(2009) propose a set of complex heuristic rules to determine the scope of negation and
then study the impact of different scope models for sentence and document polarity
analysis. Their results show that incorporating linguistic insights into negation model-
ing is meaningful. Another way to model composition is to rely on a sentiment lexicon
and predefined set of heuristics that predicts how shifters affect the sentiment of a
phrase/sentence (Moilanen and Pulman 2007; Choi and Cardie 2008; Nakagawa et al.
2010; Taboada et al. 2011; Benamara et al. 2012). For example, Moilanen and Pulman
(2007) propose three types of rules to deal with negation and intensifiers: sentiment
propagation (the polarity of a neutral constituent is overridden by that of the evaluative
constituent), polarity conflict resolution (a non-neutral polarity value is changed to
another non-neutral polarity value), and polarity reversal. Lexicon-based sentiment
composition has been shown to outperform bag-of-words learning classification of
sentiment at the sentence level (Choi and Cardie 2008).

226



Benamara, Taboada, and Mathieu Evaluative Language Beyond Bags of Words

Rules being language-and context-dependent, another alternative approach is to
represent each node in a parse tree with a vector, and then learn how to compose
leaf vectors in a bottom–up fashion. The composition process is modeled as a func-
tion learned from the training data, which can be standard data sets that only have
document-level sentiment annotation (e.g., star ratings [Yessenalina and Cardie 2011;
Socher et al. 2011, 2012] or sentiment treebanks with fine-grained annotations for every
single node of the top parse tree (Johansson and Moschitti 2013; Socher et al. 2013; Dong
et al. 2014; Hall et al. 2014; Zhu et al. 2015). The Stanford Sentiment Treebank is probably
the best known example (Socher et al. 2013). It is composed of 215,154 phrases annotated
by three human judges according to six sentiment values, ranging from very negative to
very positive, with neutral in the middle. Those phrase annotations are then combined
with a dependency parse to propagate sentiment up through the nodes of the tree.

Various composition functions have been proposed in the literature. For example,
Yessenalina and Cardie (2011) represent each word as a matrix and combine words
using iterated matrix multiplication, which allows for modeling both additive (for
negation) and multiplicative (for intensifiers) semantic effects. Wu et al. (2011) propose
a graph-based method for computing a sentence-level sentiment representation. The
vertices of the graph are the opinion targets, opinion expressions, and modifiers of
opinion; the edges represent relations among them (mainly, opinion restriction and
opinion expansion). However, using recursive neural tensor networks trained over the
Stanford Sentiment Treebank yields significant improvements over approaches based
on token-level features. Haas and Versley (2015) observe that this gain in accuracy
comes at the cost of the huge effort needed to built such treebanks, which are necessarily
limited to certain domains and languages. To overcome this difficulty, they propose an
alternative cross-lingual and cross-domain approach.

6. New Approaches: From Discourse to Pragmatic Phenomena

Valence shifters capture important linguistic behavior. Relying on the principle of com-
positionality, researchers take for granted that the sentiment of a document, a sentence,
or a tweet is the sum of its parts. Some of the parts contribute more than others and
some reduce or cancel out the sentiment, but the assumption is often that components
can be added up, subtracted, or multiplied to yield a reliable result. Shifting phenomena
discussed in the last section cannot account for the phenomena of contextual valence
shifting in general because they are necessarily bounded at the sentence level and
contextual sentiment assignment occurs at the discourse and the pragmatic levels.

In this section, we discuss five contextual phenomena that we believe constitute
the keys to the future of sentiment analysis systems: discourse, implicit evaluation,
figurative language, extra-linguistic information, and intent detection.

6.1 Discourse-Level Phenomena

Texts and conversations are not mere juxtapositions of words and sentences. They are,
rather, organized in a structure in which discourse units are related to each other so as to
ensure both discourse coherence and cohesion. Coherence refers to the logical structure
of discourse where every part of a text has a function, a role to play, with respect to
other parts in the text (Taboada and Mann 2006b). Coherence has to do with semantic or
pragmatic relations among units to produce the overall meaning of a discourse (Hobbs
1979; Mann and Thompson 1988; Grosz et al. 1995). The impression of coherence in
text (that it is organized, that it hangs together) is also aided by cohesion, the linking

227



Computational Linguistics Volume 43, Number 1

of entities in discourse (Halliday and Hasan 1976). Linking across entities happens
through grammatical and lexical connections such as anaphoric expressions and lexical
relations (synonymy, meronymy, hyponymy) appearing across sentences.

In sentiment analysis, discourse structure provides a crucial link between the local
sentence level and the entire document (article, conversation, blog post, tweet, headline)
and is needed for a better understanding of the opinions expressed in text. In particular,
discourse can help in three main tasks: (1) identifying the subjectivity and polarity
orientation of evaluative expressions; (2) furnishing important clues for recognizing
implicit opinions; and (3) assessing the overall stance of texts. Two main directions have
been explored to deal with discourse phenomena: top–down and bottom–up.

6.1.1 Top–Down Approaches. Top–down discourse analysis captures the macro-
organization of a text or high-level textual patterns, following previous studies dealing
with the signalling of text organization (Chafe 1994; Fries 1995; Goutsos 1996), the line-
arization problem (Levelt 1981), and the multi-dimensionality of discourse (Halliday
and Hasan 1976). Top–down approaches define discourse segments as being units
higher than the sentence (e.g., paragraph, topic units) and focus on building either a
topic structure or a functional structure (see Purver 2011 and Stede 2011 for comprehen-
sive surveys). Organizing discourse by topicality consists of splitting discourse into a
linear sequence of segments, each of which focuses on a distinct subtopic occurring in
the context of one or more main topics. Topic segmentation is generally guided by local
discourse continuity or the lexical cohesion assumption (Halliday and Hasan 1976) that
stipulates that topic and lexical usage (such as word repetition, discourse connectives,
and paradigmatic relations) are strongly related (Hearst 1994). Functional structure,
on the other hand, analyzes discourse from the point of view of the communicative
roles or intentions of discourse units in genre-specific texts or from the speaker’s (or
writer’s) communicative intention perspective (Grosz and Sidner 1986; Moore and Paris
1993; Lochbaum 1998). Genre-induced text structure aims at segmenting discourse into
different parts that serve different functions. This segmentation is achieved through
a conventionalized set of building blocks that contribute to the overall text function.
These building blocks are called content, functional, or discourse zones. Discourse
zones are specific to particular genres, such as the communicative roles played by the
introduction, background, and conclusion sections in a scientific paper (Swales 1990;
Teufel and Moens 2002). Other genres studied include law texts (Palau and Moens 2009),
biomedical articles (Agarwal and Yu 2009), and movie reviews (Bieler et al. 2007).

Top–down approaches in sentiment analysis assume that in a subjective document
only some parts are relevant to the overall sentiment. Irrelevant parts thus have to be
filtered out or de-emphasized, and the remaining parts are used to infer an overall eval-
uation at the document level. For example, a recent psycholinguistic and psychological
study shows that polarity classification should concentrate on messages in the final
position of the text (Becker and Aharonson 2010). Pang et al. (2002) were the first to
empirically investigate positional features. Specifically, depending on the position at
which a token appears (first quarter, last quarter, or middle half of the document), the
same unigram is treated as different features. However, the outcomes did not result
in a significant improvement. An error analysis showed that this low improvement is
due to the positional features that fail to adequately handle the “thwarted expectation”
phenomenon, very common in such text genre (cf. Section 4). Pang et al. (2002) argued
that a more sophisticated form of discourse analysis is needed. Taboada and Grieve
(2004) also used positional features, but focused on adjectives and found that adjectives

at the beginning of the text are not as relevant, and that an opinion on the main topic
tends to be found towards the end of the text.

Instead of keeping relevant segments on the basis of their relative position in a
document, other studies suggest selecting them according to topic criteria. Inspired
by Wiebe’s (1994) assumption that objectivity and subjectivity are usually consistent
between adjacent sentences, Pang and Lee (2004) built an initial model to classify each
sentence as being subjective or objective and then used the top subjective sentences as
input for a standard document level polarity classifier. The proposed cascade model
was shown to be more accurate than one using the whole document. To reduce errors
relative to models trained in isolation, McDonald et al. (2007), Mao and Lebanon (2007),
Yessenalina et al. (2010), Täckström and McDonald (2011), Paltoglou and Thelwall
(2013), and Yogatama and Smith (2014) use a joint structured model for both sentence-
and document-level that captures sentiment dependencies between adjacent sentences.
These models outperform a plain bag-of-words representation for document polarity
classification.

Another line of research explores the functional role played by some parts or zones
in a text. Smith and Lee (2014) focused on two discourse function roles—expressive and
persuasive—and showed that training a supervised polarity classifier on persuasive
documents can have a negative effect when testing on expressive documents. Based
on a corpus study of German film reviews, Bieler et al. (2007) implemented a hybrid
algorithm that automatically divided a document into its formal and functional con-
stituents, with the former being constituents whose presence is characteristic for the
genre (factual information such as date of the review, name of the author, or cast of
the film), and the latter being longer paragraphs making contributions to the commu-
nicative goal of the author. Functional constituents are further divided roughly into
Description and Comment, the former containing background information about the
film or a description of the plot, and the latter contains the main evaluative content
of the text, the part from which sentiment should be extracted. Using 5-gram SVM
classifiers, the authors report a precision ranging from 70% for formal zones to 79%
for functional zones. Later, Taboada et al. (2009) extended this approach and used the
output of a paragraph classifier to weigh paragraphs in a sentiment analysis system.
Results show that weighing Comment paragraphs higher than Description paragraphs
boosts the accuracy of classifying reviews as either positive or negative from 65% to
79%. Roberto et al. (2015) follow the same idea for hotel reviews.

Argumentation is another top–down aspect that can play a functional role in eval-
uative texts. In fact, evaluative language may also serve a role in building arguments.
Hunston and Thompson (2000a) suggest that evaluation helps organize the discourse,
in addition to its role of strictly conveying an opinion (see Section 2.5). Argumentation
is a process by which arguments are constructed by the writer to clarify or defend
their opinions. An argument is generally defined as a set of premises that provide the
evidence or the reasons for or against a conclusion, also known as a claim (Walton 2009).
When using arguments, holders are able to tell not just what views are being expressed,
but also why those particular views are held (Lawrence and Reed 2015).

Premises can be introduced in texts by specific markers or cue phrases such as for
example, but, or because (Knott and Dale 1994). The claim is a proposition stating the gen-
eral feeling or recommendation of the writer. It can be supported or attacked through
various statements making a holder reveal preferences and priorities. For instance, in
The movie is good because the characters were great, the second clause is evidence that
supports the conclusion in the first clause, whereas in The movie is good but the script was
bad, the same conclusion is attacked. Tracking arguments in text consists of identifying

229



Computational Linguistics Volume 43, Number 1

its argumentative structure, including the premises, conclusion, and the connections
between them such as the argument and counter-argument relationships.

Argumentation mining is a relatively new area in NLP (Mochales and Moens 2011;
Peldszus and Stede 2013; Hasan and Ng 2014). Roughly, three main approaches have
been proposed to extract arguments (Lawrence and Reed 2015). The first one relies on a
list of discourse markers connecting adjacent premises split into two groups according
to their effect on argumentation: support markers and attack markers. For example,
adversative connectives such as but and although connect opposing arguments, whereas
conjunctives like and, or, and then link independent arguments that target the same goal.
The second approach in argumentation uses supervised learning to classify a given
statement as being an argument or not. Then each argument can be classified as being
either a premise or a conclusion, or whether it fits within a predefined argumentative
scheme that takes the form of a number of premises working together to support or
attack a conclusion. Finally, the last approach makes use of topic changes as indicators
of a change in the argumentation line. For instance, if the topic of a given proposition
is similar to the one discussed in the preceding propositions, then one can assume that
these propositions are connected and are following the same line of reasoning.

In sentiment analysis, the role of argumentation has been investigated for doc-
ument polarity classification (Hogenboom et al. 2010; Vincent and Winterstein 2014;
Wachsmuth et al. 2014). For example, Vincent and Winterstein (2014) noticed in their
corpus of movie reviews that a persuasive argumentation in positive reviews often con-
sists of several independent arguments in favor of its conclusion. In negative reviews,
however, a single negative argument appears to be enough. To date, most existing
studies use a predefined list of markers to extract arguments and build the document’s
argumentative structure. Although the approach is rather simple (only a few arguments
are marked), it has shown to improve document classification.

6.1.2 Bottom–Up Approaches. Bottom–up parsing defines hierarchical structures by con-
structing complex discourse units from Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs) in a re-
cursive fashion. It aims at identifying the rhetorical relations holding between EDUs,
which are mainly non-overlapping clauses, and also between larger units recursively
built up from EDUs and the relations connecting them.7 Identifying rhetorical relations
is a crucial step in discourse analysis. Given two discourse units that are deemed to
be related, this step labels the attachment between the two units with relations such as
ELABORATION, EXPLANATION, or CONDITIONAL, as in [This is the best book]1 [that I have
read in a long time]2, where the second argument expands or elaborates on the first. Some
relations are explicitly marked, that is, they contain overt markers to clearly signal the
type of connection between the arguments, such as but, although, as a consequence. Others
are implicit, that is, they do not have clear indicators, as in I didn’t go to the beach. It
was raining. In this last example, in order to infer the EXPLANATION relation (or, more
generally, a causal relation) between the clauses, we need detailed lexical knowledge
and probably domain knowledge as well (that beaches are usually avoided when it is
raining).

The study of discourse relations in language can be broadly characterized as falling
under two main approaches: the lexically grounded approach and an approach that
aims at complete discourse coverage. Perhaps the best example of the first approach is

7 For an introduction to rhetorical, coherence, or discourse relations, see Asher and Lascarides (2003) and
Taboada and Mann (2006b).

230

the Penn Discourse Treebank (Prasad et al. 2008). The annotation starts that specific lexi-
cal items that signal the relation explicitly, most of them conjunctions, and includes two
arguments for each conjunction. This leads to partial discourse coverage: There is no
guarantee that the entire text is annotated, because parts of the text not related through
a conjunction would be excluded. Complete discourse coverage requires annotation of
the entire text, with most of the propositions in the text integrated in a structure. It
includes work from two theoretical perspectives, either intentionally driven, such as
Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST; Mann and Thompson 1988), or semantically driven,
such as Segmented Discourse Representation Theory (SDRT; Asher and Lascaride 2003).
RST proposes a tree-based representation, with relations between adjacent segments,
and emphasizes a differential status for discourse components (the nucleus vs. satel-
lite distinction). Captured in a graph-based representation with long-distance attach-
ments, SDRT proposes relations between abstract objects using a relatively small set of
relations.

Manually annotated resources following the aforementioned approaches have con-
tributed to a number of applications, most notably discourse segmentation into elemen-
tary discourse units, identification of explicit and implicit relations for the purpose of
discourse parsing, and development of end-to-end discourse parsers (Hernault et al.
2010; Feng and Hirst 2014; Joty et al. 2015; Surdeanu et al. 2015).

Efforts to incorporate discourse information into sentiment analysis can be grouped
into two categories: those that rely on local discourse relations at the inter-sentential or
intra-sentential level, and those that rely on the structure over the entire document,
as given by a discourse parser or manually annotated data. We discuss each of these
approaches in turn.

Leveraging local discourse relations. The idea is that among the set of relations, only
some are sentiment-relevant. The simplest way to identify them is to take into account
discourse connectives or cue phrases. Polanyi and Zaenen (2006) first noticed that
connectives can reverse polarity, and they can also conceal subjectivity. For example, the
CONCESSION relation in Although Boris is brilliant at math, he is a horrible teacher shows
that the positivity of brilliant is neutralized, downtoned at best. A CONDITION relation
will also limit the extent of a positive evaluation, as observed by Trnavac and Taboada
(2012) in a corpus study of Appraisal in movie and book reviews. For instance, in It is an
interesting book if you can look at it without expecting the Grisham “law and order” style, the
positive evaluation in interesting is tempered by the condition that readers have to be
able to change their expectations about the author’s typical style and previous books.
Narayanan et al. (2009) also focused on conditionals marked by connectives such as
if, unless, and even if, and proposed a supervised learning algorithm to determine if
sentiment expressed on different topics in a conditional sentence is positive, negative,
or neutral. Instead of extracting specific connectives, some researchers use a compiled
list of connectives and incorporate it as features in a bag-of-words model to improve
sentiment classification accuracy (Mittal et al. 2013; Trivedi and Eisenstein 2013). Others
identify discourse connectives automatically, relying on a discourse tagger trained on
the Penn Discourse Treebank (Yang and Cardie 2014).

Relations that have been used in sentiment analysis are either relations proposed
under various theories of discourse (e.g., RST, SDRT), or a set of relations built specifi-
cally to be used in sentiment analysis. Asher et al. (2008) considered five types of SDRT-
like rhetorical relations, both explicit and implicit (CONTRAST, CORRECTION, RESULT,
CONTINUATION, and SUPPORT), and conducted a manual study in which they repre-
sented opinions in text as shallow semantic feature structures. These are combined into

231



Computational Linguistics Volume 43, Number 1

an overall opinion using hand-written rules based on manually annotated discourse re-
lations. Benamara et al. (2016) extended this study by assessing the impact of 17 relations
on both subjectivity and polarity analysis in movie reviews in French and in English, as
well as letters to the editor in French. Zhou et al. (2011) focused on five RST relations
(CONTRAST, CONDITION, CONTINUATION, CAUSE, and PURPOSE). Instead of relying
on cue phrases, they proposed an unsupervised method for discovering these relations
and eliminating polarity ambiguities at the sentence level. Zirn et al. (2011) grouped RST
relations into Contrast vs. Non-Contrast and integrated them as features in a Markov
Logic Network to encode information between neighboring segments. Somasundaran
et al. (2009) proposed the notion of opinion frames as a representation of documents
at the discourse level in order to improve sentence-based polarity classification and to
recognize the overall stance. Two sets of relations were used: relations between targets
(SAME and ALTERNATIVE) and relations between opinion expressions (REINFORCING
and NON-REINFORCING). Lazaridou et al. (2013) also use a specific scheme of discourse
relations. However, rather than relying on gold discourse annotations, they jointly
predict sentiment, aspect, and discourse relations and show that the model improves
accuracy of both aspect and sentiment polarity at the sub-sentential level.

Leveraging overall discourse structure. Coping with discourse relations at the local level
has three main disadvantages: (1) the local approach captures explicitly marked
relations—indeed, most approaches do not handle cases where a signal can trigger
different relations or does not have a discourse use; (2) it accounts for the phenomena of
contextual valence shifting only at the sentence level; and finally, (3) it does not account
for long-distance discourse dependency. Polanyi and van den Berg (2011) argue that
sentiment is a semantic scope phenomenon. In particular, discourse syntax encodes
semantic scope; and because sentiment is a semantic phenomenon, its scope is gov-
erned by the discourse structure. Another important feature for studying the effects of
discourse structure on opinion analysis is long-distance dependency. For instance, if an
opinion is within the scope of an attribution that spans several EDUs, then knowing the
scope of the attribution will enable us to determine who is in fact expressing the opinion.
Similarly, if there is a contrast that has scope over several EDUs in its left argument, this
can be important to determine the overall contribution of the opinions expressed in the
arguments of the contrast. Example (15) illustrates this where complex segment [1–5]
contrasts with segment [6–7].

(15) [I saw this movie on opening day.]1 [Went in with mixed feelings,]2 [hoping it
would be good,]3 [expecting a big let down]4 [(such as clash of the titans (2011),
watchmen etc.).]5 [This movie was shockingly unique however.]6 [Visuals, and
characters were excellent.]7

The importance of discourse structure in sentiment analysis has been empirically
validated by Chardon et al. (2013b). Relying on manually annotated structures follow-
ing SDRT principles, they proposed three strategies to compute the overall opinion
score for a document: bag-of-segments that does not take into account the discourse
structure; partial discourse that takes into account only relevant segments; and full dis-
course, which is based on the full use of a discourse graph, where a rule-based approach
guided by the semantics of rhetorical relations aggregates segments opinion scores in
a bottom–up fashion. These strategies were compared with a baseline that consisted of
aggregating the strengths of opinion words within a review with respect to a given po-
larity and then assigning an overall rating to reflect the dominant polarity. The strategies
were evaluated on 151 French movie reviews and 112 French news reactions annotated

232



Benamara, Taboada, and Mathieu Evaluative Language Beyond Bags of Words

with both opinion and discourse. Results showed that discourse-based strategies lead
to significant improvements of around 10% over the baseline on both corpora. The
added value of the discourse models is more impressive for newspaper comments
than for movie reviews. This is probably because implicit evaluations (more frequent
in comments) are well captured by the discourse graph. Another interesting result
suggests that the use of full discourse is more salient for overall scale rating than for
polarity rating. Wang et al. (2012) also relied on manual RST annotations in Chinese.
They, however, only focus on relations triggered by explicit connectives using a strategy
that weighs nuclei and satellites differently.

Extracting evaluative expressions in real scenarios requires automatic discourse
representations. Voll and Taboada (2007) explored the integration of Spade (Soricut
and Marcu 2003), a sentence-level RST discourse parser, into their system SO-CAL for
automatic sentiment analysis. Their approach ignores adjectives outside the top nuclei
sentences. The results obtained are comparable to those for the baseline that averages
over all adjectives in a review. The authors argue that the loss in performance is mainly
due to the parser having approximately only 80% accuracy in assigning discourse
structure. Later work by Taboada et al. (2008) uses the same parser with a different
approach: They first extract rhetorical structure from the texts, assign parts of the text
to nucleus or satellite status, and then perform semantic orientation calculations only
on the nuclei, namely, the most important parts. The authors evaluate the performance
of this approach against a topic classifier that extracts topic sentences from texts. Re-
sults show that the use of weights on relevant sentences results in an improvement
over word-based methods that consider the entire text equally. However, the weighing
approach used only nuclei, regardless of the type of relation between nucleus and
satellite. For example, a contrasting span may play a different role in conveying the
overall sentiment than an elaboration on information in the nucleus does. Heerschop
et al. (2011) further develop this finding and show that exploiting sentence-level RST
relation types outperforms the baseline, with a sentiment classification accuracy in-
crease of 4.5%.

The weighing scheme has also been used on document level parsing following RST
(Gerani et al. 2014; Bhatia et al. 2015; Hogenboom et al. 2015). For example, Bhatia et al.
(2015) propose two ways of combining RST trees with sentiment analysis: reweighing
the contribution of each discourse unit based on its position in the tree, and recursively
propagating sentiment up through the tree. Compared with a standard bag-of-words
approach, the reweighing method substantially improves lexicon-based sentiment anal-
ysis, but the improvements for the classification-based models are poor (less that 1%).
The recursive approach, on the other hand, results in a 3% accuracy increase on a large
corpus of 50,000 movie reviews. Adding sensitivity to discourse relations (Contrastive
vs. Non-Contrastive relations) offers further improvements.

6.2 Implicit Evaluation

Compared with explicit evaluation, implicit evaluation requires readers to make prag-
matic inferences that go beyond what is literally said. Although humans are much better
than automatic systems at figuring out implicit evaluation, much of it is difficult even
for humans. For example, Toprak et al. (2010) reported a kappa of 0.56 for polar fact sen-
tences in customer reviews, and Benamara et al. (2016) obtained 0.48 when annotating
implicit opinions in French news reactions. In addition, when analyzing the Pearson’s
correlations between annotators’ overall opinion score of a document and the scores
given to subjective segments, Benamara et al. (2016) showed that implicit opinions are

233



Computational Linguistics Volume 43, Number 1

better correlated with the global opinion score when negative opinions are concerned.
This could indicate a tendency to “conceal” negative opinions as seemingly objective
statements, which can be related to social conventions (politeness, in particular).

Grice (1975) made a clear distinction between what is said by an utterance (i.e.,
meaning out of context) and what is implied or meant by an utterance (i.e., meaning
in context). In his theory of conversational implicature, Grice considers that to cap-
ture the speaker’s meaning, the hearer needs to rely on the meaning of the sentence
uttered, contextual assumptions, and the Cooperative Principle, which speakers are
expected to observe. The Cooperative Principle states that speakers make contributions
to the conversation that are cooperative. The Cooperative Principle is expressed in four
maxims that the communication participants are supposed to follow. The maxims ask
the speaker to say what they believe to be the truth (Quality), to be as informative
as possible (Quantity), to say the utterance at the appropriate point in the interaction
(Relevance), and in the appropriate manner (Manner). Maxims are, in a sense, ideals,
and Grice provided examples of violations of maxims for various reasons. The violation
of a maxim may result in the speaker conveying, in addition to the literal meaning of
the utterance, an additional meaning that does not contribute to the truth-conditional
content of the utterance, which leads to conversational implicature. Implicatures are
thus inferences that can defeat literal and compositional meaning. Example (16) is a
typical example of relevance violation: B conveys to A that he will not be accepting A’s
invitation for dinner although he has not literally said so.

(16) A. Let’s have dinner tonight.

B. I have to finish my homework.

Borrowing from Grice’s conversational implicature, Wilson and Wiebe (2005) view
implicit evaluation as opinion implicatures, which are “the default inferences that may
not go through in context.” Hence, subjectivity is part of what is said while private-state
inferences is part of what is implied. Example (17), taken from the MPQA corpus (Wiebe
et al. 2005), illustrates the inter-dependencies among explicit and implicit sentiment.
The explicit sentiment happy clearly indicates a positive sentiment but, at the same
time, a negative sentiment toward Chavez himself may be inferred (somebody’s fall
is a negative thing; being happy about it implies that they deserved it, or that they are
not worthy of sympathy).

(17) I think people are happy because Chavez has fallen.

Implicit evaluation is sometimes conveyed through an elusive process of discourse
prosody, the positive or negative character that a few explicit items can infuse a text
with. Martin and White (2005, page 21) define (one form of) prosody as meanings that
are realized locally, but that color a longer stretch of text by dominating meanings in
their domain. For instance, a review that starts out negatively, or that we see has a
low number of stars associated with it, will lead us to interpret many of the meanings
in the review as negative, even if negative opinion is not always explicitly stated.
Bednarek (2006) also discusses this phenomenon in news discourse, characterizing it
as evaluative prosody. Discourse prosody is also related to the sentence proximity
assumption of Wiebe’s (1994), whereby subjective or objective sentences are assumed
to cluster together (see Section 3.2).

In general terms, there are three ways to make an evaluation implicit or invoked.
The first one is to describe desirable or undesirable situations (states or events). Wilson
(2008) refers to these as polar facts, that is, they are facts (as opposed to opinions),
but they convey polarity because of the way such states or events are conventionally

234



Benamara, Taboada, and Mathieu Evaluative Language Beyond Bags of Words

associated with a positive or negative evaluation. Van de Kauter et al. (2015) state that
the polarity of such facts is inferred using common sense, world knowledge, or context.
Situations can be conveyed through verb phrases like those in italics in Examples (18)
and (19), or noun phrases like the word valley in Example (20). The first two examples
are translations from the French CASOAR corpus (Benamara et al. 2016); Example (20)
comes from Zhang and Liu (2011).

(18) The movie is not bad, although some persons left the auditorium.

(19) This movie is poignant, and the actors excellent. It will remain in your DVD closet.

(20) Within a month, a valley formed in the middle of the mattress.

Situations that affect the evaluation of entities can be automatically identified
relying either on co-occurrence assumptions, a set of rules, or patterns enlarged via
bootstrapping (Goyal et al. 2010; Benamara et al. 2011; Zhang and Liu 2011; Riloff
et al. 2013; Deng et al. 2014b; Wiebe and Deng 2014). For example, Riloff et al. (2013)
learn from tweets patterns of the form [VP+].[Situation−] that correspond to a contrast
between positive sentiment in a verb phrase and a negative situation. Tweets following
this pattern are more likely to be sarcastic (see Section 6.3 on sarcasm and figurative
language). Zhang and Liu (2011) exploit context to identify nouns and noun phrases
that imply sentiment. They hypothesize that such phrases often have a single polarity
(either positive or negative, but not both) and tend to co-occur in an explicit negative
(or positive) context. In addition to co-occurrence, Benamara et al. (2011) use discursive
constraints to find the subjective orientation of EDUs in movie reviews. An EDU can
belong to four classes: explicit evaluative, subjective non-evaluative, implicit, and ob-
jective. These constraints were guided by the effect certain discourse relations may have
on evaluative language: Contrasts usually reverse polarity, as in Example (18), whereas
parallels and continuations preserve subjectivity, as in Example (19).

We believe that leveraging positive and negative situations would improve senti-
ment detection, especially in blogs or corpora about politics or economy, which tend
to contain more implicit evaluation. Recent results are very encouraging. For example,
using a global optimization framework, Deng et al. (2014b) achieve a 20-point increase
over local sentiment detection that does not account for such situations.

The second type of implicit evaluation concerns objective words that have positive
or negative connotations. Whereas denotation is the precise, literal definition of a word
that might be found in a dictionary, connotation refers to emotional suggestive mean-
ings surrounding a word. Consider the words in italics in the following three sentences:

(21) a. Jim is a vagrant.

b. Jim has no fixed address.

c. Jim is homeless.

All these expressions refer to exactly the same social situation, but they will evoke
different associations in the reader’s mind: Vagrancy has a significant negative conno-
tation in English. It is used to describe those who live on the street and are perceived as
a public nuisance. For example, there are laws against vagrancy in many locations. A
homeless person, on the other hand, is not necessarily perceived as a nuisance, and the
expression can connote sympathy and be used to appeal to charity. Taboada et al. (2011)
noticed that some nouns and verbs often have both neutral and non-neutral connota-
tions. For instance, inspire has a very positive meaning (The teacher inspired her students
to pursue their dreams), as well as a rather neutral meaning (This movie was inspired by

235



Computational Linguistics Volume 43, Number 1

real events). Some instances of different connotations can be addressed through word-
sense disambiguation (Akkaya et al. 2011; Sumath and Inkpen 2015). In other cases, the
problem is framed as domain dependency. What is considered positive in one domain
may be negative in another. Example (22) was seen on the Toulouse transit system. The
word volume changes its connotation, or polarity, with different domains of application:
Volume is good for hair; (loud) volume is bad for public transit.

(22) Le volume c’est bien dans les cheveux. . . moins dans les transports.

‘Volume is good in hair. . . less so in transportation.’

Although connotation has a strong impact on sentiment analysis, most current
subjective lexicons contain words that are intrinsically positive or negative. To overcome
this limitation, Feng et al. (2013) propose a set of induction algorithms to automatically
build the first broad-coverage connotation lexicon.8 This lexicon performs better than
denotation lexicons in binary sentiment classification on SemEval and Tweet corpora.
Later, Kang et al. (2014) extended this lexicon to deal with polysemous words and
introduced ConnotationWordNet, a connotation lexicon over words in conjunction with
senses. Connotation is also being explored in other NLP tasks like machine translation
(Carpuat 2015).

The third way in which implicit evaluation can arise is when one expresses an
evaluation towards an implicit aspect of an entity. This has been more frequently
observed in aspect-based sentiment analysis (Liu 2012). For example, the adjective
heavy in The cell phone is heavy implicitly provides a negative opinion about the aspect
weight. Similarly, the verb last in My new phone lasted three days suggests that the aspect
durability is assigned a negative opinion. Some of these implicit evaluations arise out
of connotations, some of them because of polysemy (the problem to be solved in word
sense disambiguation), and some of them because of domain dependence, as pointed
out earlier. Implicit aspects can be expressed by nouns, noun phrases, or verb phrases,
as in The camera fits in my pocket, which expresses a positive evaluation towards the size
of the camera. Inferring implicit aspects from sentences first requires detecting implicit
aspect clues that are often assumed to be subjective words (adjective, adverb, or noun
expressions). Once clues are found, clustering methods are used to map them to their
corresponding aspects (Popescu and Etzioni 2005; Su et al. 2008; Hai et al. 2011; Fei
et al. 2012; Zeng and Li 2013). Although recent studies are addressing verb expressions
that imply negative opinions (Li et al. 2015), identifying implicit aspects that are not
triggered by sentiment words is still an open problem.

6.3 Dealing with Figurative Language

Figurative language makes use of figures of speech to convey non-literal meaning, that
is, meaning that is not strictly the conventional or intended meaning of the individ-
ual words in the figurative expression. Figurative language encompasses a variety of
phenomena, including metaphor, oxymoron, idiomatic expressions, puns, irony, and
sarcasm.

Metaphors equate two different entities, concepts, or ideas, referred to as source
and target. It has traditionally been viewed as the domain of expressive and poetic
language, but studies in cognitive linguistics have clearly shown that it is pervasive
in language. In cognitive linguistics, the all-encompassing view of metaphor states that

8 The lexicon is available from: www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/∽ychoi/connotation/.

236



Benamara, Taboada, and Mathieu Evaluative Language Beyond Bags of Words

it is fundamental to our conceptual system, and that metaphors in language are simply
a reflection of our conceptual framework, whereby we conceptualize one domain by
using language from a more familiar or basic one. For instance, political and other
debates often borrow the language of war and conflict to characterize their antagonistic
nature (we win arguments; attack or shoot down the opponent’s points; defend our point
of view). Lakoff and Johnson (1980) constitutes the foundational work in this area,
and Shutova et al. (2013) and Shutova (2015) provide an excellent overview from a
computational perspective.

Far from it being a phenomenon restricted to literary text, metaphor and figurative
language are present in all kinds of language and at all levels of formality. According
to Shutova and Teufel (2010), approximately one in three sentences in regular general
text contains a metaphorical expression. Irony and sarcasm can be viewed as forms of
metaphorical and figurative language, because they convey more than what is literally
expressed.

Irony detection has gained relevance recently because of its importance for effi-
cient sentiment analysis (Maynard and Greenwood 2014; Ghosh et al. 2015). Irony is
a complex linguistic phenomenon widely studied in philosophy and linguistics (Grice
1975; Sperber and Wilson 1981; Utsumi 1996; Attardo 2000). The reader can refer to
Barbe (1995), Winokur (2005) and Wallace (2015) for linguistic models of verbal irony.
Glossing over differences across approaches, irony can be defined as an incongruity
between the literal meaning of an utterance and its intended meaning. For example, to
express a negative opinion towards a cell phone, one can either use a literal form using
a negative opinion word, as in This phone is a disaster, or a non-literal form by using a
positive word, as in What an excellent phone!! For many researchers, irony overlaps with a
variety of other figurative devices such as satire, parody, and sarcasm (Clark and Gerrig
1984; Gibbs 2000). In computational linguistics, irony is often used as an umbrella term
that includes sarcasm, although some researchers make a distinction between irony
and sarcasm, considering that sarcasm tends to be harsher, humiliating, degrading, and
more aggressive (Lee and Katz 1998; Clift 1999).

In social media, such as Twitter, users tend to utilize specific hashtags (#irony,
#sarcasm, #sarcastic) to help readers understand that their message is ironic. These
hashtags are often used as gold labels to detect irony in a supervised learning setting
(i.e., learning whether a text span is ironic/sarcastic or not). In doing so, systems are not
be able to detect irony without explicit hashtags, but on the positive side, it provides
researchers with positive examples with high precision. There are, however, some
dangers in that kind of approach. Kunneman et al. (2015) show that tweets with and
without the hashtag have different characteristics. The main difference between tagged
tweets and tweets labeled by humans as sarcastic (but without a hashtag) is that the
tagged tweets have fewer intensified words and fewer exclamations (at least in Dutch,
the language of their corpus). Kunneman et al. hypothesize that the intensification, a
form of hyperbole, helps in the identification of sarcasm by readers, and that the explicit
hashtag is the equivalent of non-verbal expressions in face-to-face interaction, which
are used to convey nuances of meaning.

A comparative study on the use of irony and sarcasm in Twitter suggests two main
findings (Wang 2013). First, sarcastic tweets tend to be more positive whereas ironic
tweets are more neutral. Indeed, sarcasm being more aggressive, users seem to soften
their message with the use of more positive words. Second, sarcastic tweets are more
likely to contain subjective expressions. The automatic distinction between irony and
sarcasm seems rather difficult, nevertheless. For example, Barbieri and Saggion (2014)
report an F-score of 0.6 on sarcasm vs. irony, around 25% less than the scores obtained on

237

sarcasm vs. non-ironic hashtags. Besides these results, we believe that such a distinction
can have an impact on both polarity analysis and rating prediction. A first step in this
direction has been carried out by Hernández Farı́as et al. (2015) with the use of a specific
feature that reverses the polarity of tweets that include #sarcasm or #not.

There are roughly two ways to infer irony or sarcasm from text: Rely exclusively
on the lexical cues internal to the utterance, or combine these cues with an additional
pragmatic context external to the utterance. In the first case, the speaker intentionally
creates an explicit juxtaposition of incompatible actions or words that can either have
opposite polarities (cf. Example (23)), or can be semantically unrelated. Explicit oppo-
sition can also arise from an explicit positive/negative contrast between a subjective
proposition and a situation that describes an undesirable activity or state. The irony is
inferred from the assumption that the writer and the reader share common knowledge
about this situation, which is judged as being negative by cultural or social norms.
Raining on summer holidays or growing older are examples of such situations.

(23) I love when my phone fails when I need it.

To detect irony in explicit and implicit oppositions, most state-of-the-art approaches
rely on a variety of features gleaned from the utterance-internal context going from
n-gram models, stylistic (punctuation, emoticons, quotations), to dictionary-based
features (sentiment and affect dictionaries, slang language) (Kreuz and Caucci 2007;
Burfoot and Baldwin 2009; Davidov et al. 2010; Tsur et al. 2010; González-Ibáñez et al.
2011; Gianti et al. 2012; Liebrecht et al. 2013; Reyes et al. 2013; Barbieri and Saggion
2014). Kreuz and Caucci (2007) conclude that the presence of interjections is an impor-
tant indication for irony detection whereas word frequency, the presence of adjectives,
adverbs, words in bold font, and punctuation do not have a strong impact. Gianti et al.
(2012) found that verb tenses can be another way to study linguistic differences between
humorous and objective text. Carvalho et al. (2009) proposed a set of eight patterns
among which the ones based on the presence of quotations and emoticons achieved
the best with accuracy of 85.4% and 68.3%, respectively, when testing on Portuguese
newspaper articles. Veale and Hao (2010) focused on simile, a specific form of irony
in which an element is provided with special attributes through a comparison with
something quite different (e.g., As tough as a marshmallow cardigan). This is a form of
metaphor, and is often marked by specific cues such as like, about, or as in English.
Veale and Hao (2010) used patterns of the form about as X as Y or as ADJ as, and
semantic similarities to detect ironic simile. They conclude that ironic similarities often
express negative feelings using positive terms. The evaluation of this model achieves an
F-measure of 73% for the irony class and 93% for the non-ironic. Qadir et al. (2015)
extend this approach to learn to recognize affective polarity in similes.

In addition to these more lexical features, many authors point out the necessity of
pragmatic features in the detection of this complex phenomenon. Utsumi (2004) shows
that opposition, rhetorical questions, and politeness level are relevant. Burfoot and
Baldwin (2009) focus on satire detection in newswire articles and introduce the notion of
validity, which models absurdity by identifying a conjunction of named entities present
in a given document and queries the web for the conjunction of those entities. González-
Ibáñez et al. (2011) exploit the common ground between speaker and hearer by checking
whether a tweet is a reply to another tweet. Reyes et al. (2013) use opposition in time
and context imbalance to estimate the semantic similarity of concepts in a text to each
other. Barbieri and Saggion (2014) capture the gap between rare and common words as
well as the use of common vs. rare synonyms. Finally, Buschmeier et al. (2014) measure
the imbalance between the overall polarity of words in a review and its star rating.

238

Most of these pragmatic features still rely on linguistic aspects of the tweet by
using only the text of the tweet. Recent work explores other ways to go further by
capturing the context outside of the utterance that is needed to infer irony. Bamman
and Smith (2015) explore properties of the author (like profile information and historical
salient terms), the audience (such as author/addressee interactional topics), and the
immediate communicative environment (previous tweets). Wallace et al. (2015) exploit
signals extracted from the conversational threads to which comments belong. Finally,
Karoui et al. (2015) propose a model that detects irony in tweets containing an asserted
fact of the form Not(P). They hypothesize that such tweets are ironic if and only if one
can prove the validity of P in reliable external sources, such as Wikipedia or online
newspapers.

6.4 Extra-Linguistic Information

In the previous section, we saw how irony classification can gain in accuracy when
extra-linguistic or extra-textual features are taken into account. In this section, we
further discuss how sentiment analysis can benefit from these features. We focus in
particular on demographic information and social network structure.

Demographic information refers to statistical data used in marketing and business
to classify an audience into age, gender, race, income, location, political orientation, and
other categories. Several studies have found strong correlations between the expression
of subjectivity and gender and leverage these correlations for gender identification (Rao
et al. 2010; Thelwall et al. 2010; Burger et al. 2011; Volkova et al. 2015). For example,
women tend to use more emotion features (emoticons, exasperation, etc.) than men, or
different writing styles. Recently, Volkova et al. (2014) propose an approach to exploit
gender differences to improve multilingual sentiment classification in social media.
The method relies on the assumption that some subjective words will be used by
men, but never by women, and vice versa. Polarity may also be gender-influenced. A
combination of lexical features and features representing gender-dependent sentiment
terms improve subjectivity and polarity classification by 2.5% and 5% for English, 1.5%
and 1% for Spanish, and 1.5% and 1% for Russian, respectively. In addition to gender,
Persing and Ng (2014) explore 15 other types of demographic information to predict
votes from comments posted in a popular social polling Web site. This information
is found in the user’s profile and includes, for example, political views (conservative,
moderate, or progressive), relationship status (single, married, etc.), and whether the
user is a drinker or smoker. Not all information is known, but, when it is, it is modeled as
features in a voting prediction system. Results show that combining these features with
inter-comment constraints improves over a baseline that uses only textual information.

Another interesting source of extra-linguistic information can be extracted from the
structure of social networks. Indeed, while on review Web site reviews are typically
written independently of each other, comments posted in social media are usually con-
nected in such a way that enables the grouping of users according to specific communi-
ties. A community is often not identified in advance, but its users are expected to share
common goals: circles of friends, business associates, political party members, groups
of topically related conversations, and so forth. Hence, users in a given community may
have similar subjective orientations. This observation has been empirically validated in
several recent studies showing that sentiment can enhance community detection (Xu
et al. 2011; Deitrick and Hu 2013), and users’ social relationships sentiment analysis
(Tan et al. 2011; Hasan and Ng 2013; Deng et al. 2014a; Vanzo et al. 2014; West et al.
2014; Naskar et al. 2016; Ren et al. 2016).

6.5 Intent Detection
6.5.1 From Sentiment to Intent Analysis. Discourse and different pragmatic context can en-
hance sentiment analysis systems. However, knowing what a holder likes and dislikes
is only a first step in the decision making process. Consider the statements in Examples
(24), (25), (26), and (27):

(24) I don’t like Apple’s policy overall, and will never own any Mac products.

(25) I wish to buy a beautiful house with a swimming pool.

(26) How big is the screen on the Apple iPhone 4S?

(27) I am giving birth in a month.

If we look at these examples from a sentiment analysis point of view, only the
first sentence, in Example (24), would be classified as negative, the other examples
being objective.9 However, in addition to a negative opinion, the writer in Example
(24) explicitly states their intention not to buy Mac products, which is not good news
for Apple. In Example (25), the writer wishes for a change in their existing situation,
but there is no guarantee that this wish will lead to forming an intention to buy a new
house in the future. In Example (26), the writer wants to know about others’ opinions
and, based on these opinions, they may or may not be inclined to buy an iPhone. Finally,
in Example (27), one can infer that the writer may want to buy baby products that may
help Web sites to provide the most appropriate ads to display. These last two examples
are typical of implicit intentions.

Knowing about the holder’s future actions or plans from texts is crucial for decision
makers: Does the writer intend to stop using a service after a negative experience? Do
they desire to purchase a product or service? Do they prefer buying one product over
another? Intent analysis attempts to answer these questions, focusing on the detection of
future states of affairs that a holder wants to achieve.

We use the term intent as a broader term that covers desires, preferences, and in-
tentions, which are mental attitudes contributing to the rational behavior of an agent.
These attitudes play a motivational role and it is in concert with beliefs that they can
move us to act (Bratman 1990). Indeed, before deciding to perform an action, an agent
considers various desires, which are states of affairs that the agent, in an ideal world,
would wish to be brought about. Desires may be in conflict and are thus subject to
inconsistencies. Among these desires, only some can be potentially satisfied. The chosen
desires that the agent has committed to achieving are called intentions (Bratman 1990;
Wooldridge 2000; Perugini and Bagozzi 2004). Intentions cannot conflict with each other
and have to be consistent. This constitutes an important difference between desires and
intentions. This distinction has been formalized in the Belief-Desire-Intention model
(Bratman 1990), an intention-based theory of practical reasoning, namely, reasoning
directed toward actions.

Desires may be ordered according to preferences. A preference is commonly defined
as an asymmetric, transitive ordering by an agent over outcomes, which are understood
as actions that the agent can perform or goal states that are the direct result of an
action of the agent. For instance, an agent’s preferences may be defined over actions
like buy a new car or by its end result like have a new car. Among these outcomes,
some are acceptable for the agent (i.e., the agent is ready to act in such a way as to

9 A standard system that does not account for the volitive modality of wish would also classify
Example (25) as positive.

240



Benamara, Taboada, and Mathieu Evaluative Language Beyond Bags of Words

realize them) and some outcomes are not. Among the acceptable outcomes, the agent
will typically prefer some to others. Preferences are not opinions. Whereas opinions
are defined as a point of view, a belief, a sentiment, or a judgment that an agent may
have about an object or a person, preferences involve an ordering on behalf of an agent
and thus are relational and comparative. Opinions concern absolute judgments towards
objects or persons (positive, negative, or neutral), and preferences concern relative judg-
ments towards actions (preferring them or not over others). The following examples
illustrate this.

(28) The movie is not bad.

(29) The script for the first season is better than the second one.

(30) I would like to go to the cinema. Let’s go and see Madagascar 3.

Example (28) expresses a direct positive opinion towards the movie, but we do not
know if this movie is the most preferred. Example (29) expresses a comparative opinion
about two movies with respect to their shared features (script). If actions involving
these movies (e.g., seeing them) are clear in the context, such a comparative opinion
will imply a preference, an ordering the first season scenario over the second. Finally,
Example (30) expresses two preferences, one depending on the other. The first is that the
speaker prefers to go to the cinema over other alternative actions; the second is: Given
the option of going to the cinema, they want to see Madagascar 3 over other possible
movies.

Reasoning about preferences is also distinct from reasoning about opinions. An
agent’s preferences determine an order over outcomes that predicts how the agent, if
they are rational, will act. This is not true for opinions. Opinions have at best an indirect
link to action: I may not absolutely love what I am doing right now, but do it anyway
because I prefer that outcome to any of the alternatives.

6.5.2 Intent Detection: Main Approaches. Acquiring, modeling, and reasoning with desires,
preferences, and intentions are well-established fields in artificial intelligence (Cohen
and Levesque 1990; Georgeff et al. 1999; Brafman and Domshlak 2009; Kaci 2011).
Predicting user intentions from search queries and/or the user’s click behavior has also
been extensively studied in the Web search community to assist the user to search what
they want more efficiently (Chen et al. 2002; Wang and Zhang 2013). There is, however,
little research that investigates how to extract desires, preferences, and intentions from
users’ linguistic actions using NLP techniques. We survey here some existing work.

Desire extraction. Wish and desire detection from text have been explored by Goldberg
et al. (2009). They define a wish as “a desire or hope for something to happen” and
propose an unsupervised approach that learns if a given sentence is a wish or not.
Given that the expression of wishes is domain-dependent, they first exploit redundancy
in how wishes are expressed to automatically discover wish templates from a source
domain. These templates are then used to predict wishes in two target domains: product
reviews and political discussions. The source domain is a subset of the WISH corpus
composed of about 100,000 multilingual wish sentences collected over a period of 10
days in December 2007, when Web users sent in their wishes for the new year. Peace on
earth, To be financially stable, and I wish for health and happiness for my family, are typical
sentences. Extraction suggestions for products using templates has also been explored
for tweets (Dong et al. 2013). Using a small set of hand-crafted rules, Ramanand et al.
(2010) focus on two specific kinds of wishes characteristic of product reviews: sentences

241



Computational Linguistics Volume 43, Number 1

that make suggestions about existing products, and sentences that indicate the writer
is interested in purchasing a product. The same approach has been used in Brun and
Hagège (2013) to improve feature-based sentiment analysis of product reviews. It is,
however, limited, since the system only detects those wishes that match previously
defined rules.

Preference extraction. Preference extraction from text has been investigated with the study
of comparative opinions (Jindal and Liu 2006a, 2006b; Ganapathibhotla and Liu 2008;
Yang and Ko 2011; Li et al. 2013a). Given a comparison within a sentence, this task
involves two steps. First extract entities, comparative words, and entity features that
are being compared; then, identify the most preferred entity. In Example (29), the first
season and second season are the entities, better than the comparative, script the entity
feature, and the first season the preferred entity. This approach is quite limited, because it
either only focuses on the task of identifying comparative sentences without extracting
the comparative relations within the sentences, or when it does, it only considers com-
parisons at the sentence level, even sometimes with the assumption that there is only
one comparative relation in a sentence. However, for reasoning with preferences, it is
unavoidable to consider more complex comparisons with more than one dependency
at a time and with a higher level than just the sentence, in order to manage all the
preference complexity. Cadilhac et al. (2012) explore such an approach to automatically
extract the preferences and their dependencies within each dialogue move in negotia-
tion dialogues. They perform the extraction in two steps: first the set of outcomes; then,
how these outcomes are ordered. Those extracted preferences are then used to predict
trades in the win–lose game Settlers of Catan (Cadilhac et al. 2013).

Intention extraction. As for desires and preferences, intention extraction is also formu-
lated as a classification problem: deciding whether a sentence expresses an intention or
not. Sujay and Yalamanchi (2012) focus on explicit intentions and propose to categorize
text according to the type of intentions it expresses among wish, praise, complain, buy,
and so on. Using a naive bag-of-words approach, they achieve an accuracy of almost
67% on a social media corpus. Chen et al. (2013) also focus on explicit intentions in
discussion forums such as I am looking for a brand new car to replace my old Ford Focus.
The authors observe that this classification problem suffers from noisy data (only a
few sentences express intentions) and domain-dependency of features indicating the
negative class (i.e., non-intention). To deal with these issues, Chen et al. propose a
transfer learning method that first classifies sentences using labeled data from a given
source domain, and then applies the classifier to classify the target unlabeled data.
Transfer learning has also been applied to detect implicit intentions in tweets following
a two-step procedure (Ding et al. 2015): First, determine whether the sentence involves
a consumption intention. If it does, extract intention words.

In summary, we see intent analysis as orthogonal and supplementary to sentiment
analysis, which focuses on past/present holder’s states. This is why we believe that
intent detection would benefit from being built on top of sentiment analysis systems,
since positive or negative sentiments are often expressed prior to future actions.

7. When Linguistics Meets Computational Linguistics: Future Directions

We firmly believe that future developments in sentiment analysis need to be grounded
in linguistic knowledge (and also extra-linguistic information). In particular, dis-
course and pragmatic phenomena play such an important role in the interpretation of

242



Benamara, Taboada, and Mathieu Evaluative Language Beyond Bags of Words

evaluative language that they need to be taken into account if our goal is to accurately
capture sentiment. The dynamic definition of sentiment that we have presented in-
cludes update functions that allow for different contextual aspects to be incorporated
into the calculation of sentiment for evaluative words and expressions, and can be
applied at all levels of language. We see the use of linguistic and statistical methods
not as mutually exclusive, but as contributing to each other. For instance, rather than
general n-gram bag-of-words features, other features from discourse can be used to
train classifiers for sentiment analysis. Contextual features can be deployed to detect
implicit evaluation, and to accurately capture the meaning in figurative expressions.

We showed in this survey that including discourse information into opinion analy-
sis is definitively beneficial. Discourse has also been successfully deployed in machine
translation (Hardmeier 2013), natural language generation (Ashar and Indukhya 2010),
and language technology in general (Taboada and Mann 2006a; Webber et al. 2012).
Incorporating discourse into sentiment analysis can be done by relying either on shallow
discourse processing (using specific discourse markers, leveraging the notion of topicality,
zoning, and social network structure), or through full discourse parsing, exploiting the
entire discourse structure of a document. The shallow approach has been shown to be
effective when experimented on movie/product review data, and there is an increasing
amount of work on other kinds of data, such as blogs (Liu et al. 2010; Chenlo et al.
2013) and tweets (Mukherjee and Bhattacharyya 2012), where links across posts and the
stream of related posts are investigated. The effectiveness of full discourse, however,
strongly depends on the availability of powerful tools, such as discourse parsers. Com-
pared with syntactic parsing and shallow semantic analysis, discourse parsing is not as
mature. To date, the performance of parsers is still considerably inferior compared with
the human gold standard, although significant advances have been made in the last few
years (Muller et al. 2012; Ji and Eisenstein 2014; Feng 2015; Joty et al. 2015; Surdeanu
et al. 2015; Perret et al. 2016), and we expect improvements to continue. Automatic
discourse segmentation has attained high accuracy. For example, Fisher and Roark
(2007) report an F-score of 90.5% in English. Discourse relations remain nonetheless
hard to detect, due in part to the ambiguity of discourse markers, and to implicit
relations. End-to-end parsing involving structured prediction methods from machine
learning is also still in development. For example, Ji and Eisenstein (2014) report an
accuracy of 60% for discourse relation detection and Joty et al. (2015) achieve above
55% for text-level relation detection in the RST Treebank. Muller et al. (2012) also achieve
between 47% and 66% accuracy on the ANNODIS corpus, annotated following SDRT.
This may explain why most state-of-the-art NLP applications that rely on discourse do
not yet offer a substantial boost compared with discourse-unaware systems.

An additional problem is the domain dependence of many of the existing parsers,
which have been trained on newspaper articles, mostly versions of the Penn corpus
of Wall Street Journal articles, either in its RST annotation (Carlson et al. 2002), SDRT
annotation (Afantenos et al. 2012), or the Penn Discourse TreeBank annotation (Prasad
et al. 2008). It is no surprise, then, that they do not perform very well on reviews. A
possible solution would be to train a parser on gold discourse structure annotations and
sentiment labels, such as the SFU Review Corpus (Taboada et al. 2008) or the CASOAR
Corpus (Benamara et al. 2016). On the negative side, such corpora are too small to train
a discourse parser and a competitive sentiment analysis system. On the positive side,
review-style documents are relatively short , which can make parsers less sensitive to
errors due to long dependency attachments. Also, given that not all discourse relations
are sentiment relevant, the number of relations to be predicted can be reduced. This
might concern framing relations like BACKGROUND and CIRCUMSTANCE but also

243



Computational Linguistics Volume 43, Number 1

some temporal relations such as SEQUENCE or SYNCHRONOUS. On the other hand,
relations can be grouped according to their similar effects on both subjectivity and
polarity analysis. One possible grouping could be argumentative relations that are
used to support (e.g., MOTIVATION, JUSTIFICATION, INTERPRETATION) or oppose (e.g.,
CONTRAST, CONCESSION, ANTITHESIS) claims and theses, causal relations (e.g., RESULT,
CONDITION), and structural relations (e.g., ALTERNATIVE, CONTINUATION). Thematic
relations like ELABORATION, SUMMARY, and RESTATEMENT have also a strong impact
on evaluative discourse. Their effect is, however, close to support relations. We believe
that discarding certain relations and grouping others will make discourse parsers
more reliable.

Besides domain dependency, parsing is by definition theory-dependent, which
means that a system trained to learn RST relations fails to predict SDRT or PDTB
relations. Indeed, each theory has its own hierarchy of discourse relations, but relations
tend to overlap or be related in a few specific ways: A relation R in one approach
can correspond to several relations in another approach and vice versa; a relation
may be defined in one approach but not taken into account in another; and, finally,
relations across approaches may have similar names, but different definitions. One
solution to this problem is to map relations across approaches to a unified hierarchy.
Merging different discourse relation taxonomies has several advantages. First of all,
for classification tasks such as discourse parsing, access to larger amounts of data is
likely to yield better results. Secondly, and from a more theoretical point of view, we
think that differences across approaches are minimal, and a unified set of relations is
possible. Third, a unified set of discourse relations would allow us to compile a list
of discourse markers and other signals for those relations, which would also benefit
discourse annotation. Recent efforts to merge existing discourse relation taxonomies
and annotations should help improve discourse parsing (Benamara and Taboada 2015;
Rehbein et al. 2015). Notable also is work being carried out within the COST Action
TextLink, a pan-European initiative to unify definitions of relations and their signals
across languages (http://www.textlink.ii.metu.edu.tr/).

Once powerful discourse parsers are developed, the argumentative structure of
evaluative text can be fully exploited. Processing arguments for sentiment analysis is
still at an early stage and we feel that recent progress in argument mining will likely
spur new research in this direction (Bex et al. 2013; Stab and Gurevych 2014; Peldszus
and Stede 2015).

We see sentiment analysis not as an aim per se but as a first step in processing and
understanding large amounts of data. Indeed, sentiment analysis has strong interac-
tions with social media (Farzindar and Inkpen 2015), big data (Arora and Malik 2015),
and, more importantly, with modeling human behavior, that is, how sentiment trans-
lates into action. We defined “the sentiment to action” process as intent detection (cf.
Section 6.5), an area which gives linguistic objects a predictive power such as predicting
voter behavior and election results (Yano et al. 2013; Qiu et al. 2015), predicting decep-
tion (Fitzpatrick et al. 2015), or intention to buy (Ding et al. 2015). Predictions can also be
derived on the basis of extra-linguistic sources of information such as characteristics of
the author and their online interactions (Qiu et al. 2015). State-of-the-art approaches are
still heavily dependent on bag-of-words representations. We believe that predicting a
user’s future actions from text (and speech) needs to integrate models from artificial
intelligence with NLP techniques to find specific intent signals, such as changes in
the argumentation chain; the social relationship between discourse participants; topic
changes; user’s beliefs; the sudden use of sentiments or emotions of a certain type
(like aggressive expressions); or the correlation between genre and the use of specific

244



Benamara, Taboada, and Mathieu Evaluative Language Beyond Bags of Words

linguistic devices. Intent detection is an emerging research area with great potential in
business applications (Wang et al. 2015).

In summary, we believe that the discourse turn that computational linguistics is
experiencing can be successfully combined with data-driven methods as part of the
effort to accurately capture sentiment and evaluative language.
