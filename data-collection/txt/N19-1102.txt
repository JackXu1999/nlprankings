Abstract

Complex Word Identification (CWI) is the task
of identifying which words or phrases in a
sentence are difficult to understand by a tar-
get audience. The latest CWI Shared Task re-
leased data for two settings: monolingual (i.e.
train and test in the same language) and cross-
lingual (i.e. test in a language not seen dur-
ing training). The best monolingual models
relied on language-dependent features, which
do not generalise in the cross-lingual setting,
while the best cross-lingual model used neural
networks with multi-task learning. In this pa-
per, we present monolingual and cross-lingual
CWI models that perform as well as (or bet-
ter than) most models submitted to the latest
CWI Shared Task. We show that carefully se-
lected features and simple learning models can
achieve state-of-the-art performance, and re-
sult in strong baselines for future development
in this area. Finally, we discuss how incon-
sistencies in the annotation of the data can ex-
plain some of the results obtained.

1 Introduction

Complex Word Identification (CWI) consists of
deciding which words (or phrases) in a text could
be difficult to understand by a specific type of
reader. In this work, we follow the CWI Shared
Tasks (Paetzold and Specia, 2016; Yimam et al.,
2018) and assume that a target word or multi-word
expression (MWE1) in a sentence is given, and our
goal is to determine if it is complex or not (an ex-
ample is shown in Table 1). Under this setting,
CWI is normally treated using supervised learn-
ing and feature engineering to build monolingual
models (Paetzold and Specia, 2016; Yimam et al.,
2018). Unfortunately, this approach is infeasible
for languages with scarce resources of annotated

data. In this paper, we are interested in both mono-
lingual and cross-lingual CWI; in the latter, we
build models to make predictions for languages
not seen during training.

While monolingual CWI has been studied ex-
tensively (see a survey in Paetzold and Specia
(2017)), the cross-lingual setup of the task was in-
troduced only recently by Yimam et al. (2017b),
who collected human annotations from native and
non-native speakers of Spanish and German, and
integrated them with similar data previously pro-
duced for three English domains (Yimam et al.,
2017a): News, WikiNews and Wikipedia.

For the Second CWI Shared Task (Yimam et al.,
2018), participants built monolingual models us-
ing the datasets previously described, and also
tested their cross-lingual capabilities on newly col-
lected French data. In the monolingual track, the
best systems for English (Gooding and Kochmar,
2018) differed significantly in terms of feature set
size and the model’s complexity, to the best sys-
tems for German and Spanish (Kajiwara and Ko-
machi, 2018). The latter used Random Forests
with eight features, whilst the former used Ad-
aBoost with 5000 estimators or ensemble voting
combining AdaBoost and Random Forest classi-
fiers, with about 20 features.

In the cross-lingual track, only two teams
achieved better scores than the baseline: Kajiwara
and Komachi (2018) who used length and fre-
quency based features with Random Forests, and



971

Bingel and Bjerva (2018) who implemented an en-
semble of Random Forests and feed-forward neu-
ral networks in a multi-task learning architecture.

Our approach to CWI differs from previous
work in that we begin by building competitive
monolingual models, but using the same set of
features and learning algorithm across languages.
This reduces the possibility of getting high scores
due to modelling annotation artifacts present in the
dataset of one language. Our monolingual models
achieve better scores for Spanish and German than
the best systems in the Second CWI Shared Task.
After that, we focus on language-independent fea-
tures, and keep those that achieve good perfor-
mance in cross-lingual experiments across all pos-
sible combinations of languages. This results in
a small set of five language-independent features,
which achieve a score as high as the top models in
the French test set. Finally, we analyse the annota-
tion of the datasets and find some inconsistencies
that could explain some of our results.

2 Problem Formulation

We tackle the binary classification task in the Sec-
ond CWI Shared Task (Yimam et al., 2018), in
which a model decides if a target word/MWE in
a sentence is complex or not. Following com-
mon practice, we extract features from the target
word/MWE and its context, and then use a su-
pervised learning algorithm to train a classifier.
For training and testing our models, we use the
annotated datasets provided for the Second CWI
Shared Task (see Table 2 for some statistics).

3 Monolingual Models

3.1 Features Description

Our feature set consists of 25 features that can be
extracted for all languages considered (English,

German, Spanish and French). They can be di-
vided into three broad categories: features based
on the target word/MWE, sub-word level features,
and sentence-level features to capture information
from the target’s context. As we intended that our
features be applicable across languages, we drew
on features found to be useful in previous work on
CWI (Yimam et al., 2017b, 2018). We made use of
the python libraries spaCy2 (Honnibal and Mon-
tani, 2017) and NLTK3 (Loper and Bird, 2002).
Details on the resources used for extracting each
feature can be found in Appendix A.

At the target word/MWE level, we experi-
mented with features such as Named Entity (NE)
type, part-of-speech, hypernym counts, number of
tokens in the target, language-normalised num-
ber of characters in each word, and simple uni-
gram probabilities. These features are linguisti-
cally motivated. The perceived complexity of a
MWE may be higher than that of a single word,
as each component word can be complex, or sim-
ple component words can be synthesised into a
complex whole. Similarly, infrequent words are
less familiar, so we would expect low-probability
target words to be found more complex. Along
these lines, proper nouns could be more complex,
as there is a vast number of NEs, and the chance
that a person has encountered any one of them is
low. We would expect this trend to reverse for the
NE type of organisations, in combination with the
Enlgish-News dataset, as organisations mentioned
in news articles are frequently global, and so the
chance that a person has encountered a proper
noun that is an organisation is often higher than
for proper nouns in general. In total, 14 features
were used at the target word/MWE level.

Our sub-word level features include prefixes,
suffixes, the number of syllables, and the num-
ber of complex punctuation marks (i.e. punctu-
ation within the target word/MWE, such as hy-
phens, that could denote added complexity). We
would expect certain affixes to be useful features,
as language users use sub-word particles like these
to identify unknown words: by breaking up a word
like “granted” into “grant-” and “-ed”, readers can
fall back on their knowledge of these component
pieces to clarify the whole. A total of 9 sub-word
features were used in the monolingual models.

Finally, sentence level features with linguistic

motivations were also considered. Long sentences
could be harder to understand, which makes it
more difficult to figure out the meaning of un-
known words contained within them. Also, long
sentences are more likely to include more un-
known words or ambiguous references. Therefore,
we considered sentence length (i.e., number of to-
kens in the sentence) as a feature. In addition,
we extracted N-grams (unigrams, bigrams and tri-
grams) from the whole sentence, since certain sen-
tence constructions can help a reader understand
the target word/MWE. For example, “A of the B”
suggests a relation between A and B. We used 2
sentence-level features in total.

3.2 Experiments and Results

Following Yimam et al. (2018), we used Macro-
F1 score to evaluate performance and for compar-
ison with previous work on the datasets. We used
Logistic Regression for all our experiments, as it
allowed for easy exploration of feature combina-
tions, and in initial experiments we found that it
performed better than Random Forests. We eval-
uated both using the full feature set described be-
fore, as well as a two-feature baseline using the
number of tokens of the target and its language-
normalised number of characters. Results of our
monolingual experiments are shown in Table 3.

In the test set, our baseline results (BL in Ta-
ble 3) are strong, especially in German. Our
full 25-features model improves on the baseline
in all cases, with the biggest increase of over 16
percentage points seen for the EN-News dataset.
Our system beats the best performing system from
the Shared Task in Spanish (77.0) and German
(74.5), both obtained by Kajiwara and Komachi
(2018). However, the state of the art for German
remains the Shared Task baseline (75.5) (Yimam
et al., 2018). The best results for all three English

datasets were obtained by Gooding and Kochmar
(2018); ours is within two percentage points of
their News dataset score. Furthermore, the mean
score for our system (79.2) is close to the mean of
the best performing models (81.0), which are dif-
ferent systems, while using simpler features and
learning algorithm. The best-performing model in
English, for example, used Adaboost with 5000
estimators (Gooding and Kochmar, 2018).

4 Cross-lingual Models

4.1 Features Description

Linguistically, the cross-lingual approach can be
motivated by the relation between certain lan-
guages (such as French and Spanish both being
Romance languages). In addition, there may be
features identifying complex words that are shared
even across language families.

To be able to test a model on a language that
was unseen during training, the features the model
works with must be cross-lingual (or language-
independent) themselves. For example, the words
themselves are unlikely to transfer across lan-
guages (apart from those that happen to be spelled
identically), but the popularity of the words would
transfer. This rules out some of the features we
used for the monolingual approach (see Sec. 3.1),
as they were language-dependent. One such fea-
ture is N-grams for the target word/MWE, which
depend on the language, and so will only occur
with extreme sparsity outside of their source lan-
guage. For example, if applying a system trained
on English to unseen French, the English phrases
“à la mode” or “film noir” might reoccur in the
French, since they originate from that language,
but these are rare exceptions. What is more, a
French loan-phrase may have different complex-
ity characteristics to the same N-grams occurring
in their native language. Therefore, we did not use
these features in the cross-lingual system.

4.2 Experiments and Results

To find out which features were best suited for
the cross-lingual approach, we performed an it-
erative ablation analysis (see Appendix B for de-
tails). Using this process, we arrived at our final
cross-lingual feature set: number of syllables in
the target, number of tokens in the target, number
of complex punctuation marks (such as hyphens),
sentence length, and unigram probabilities.

Furthermore, we analyse the effect of different



973

language combinations on the performance of the
cross-lingual model in order to investigate how
the relationship between the languages trained and
tested on would influence model performance. Re-
call that we only have training data for English,
Spanish and German, but not French. We train
models using all possible combinations (each lan-
guage independently, each pairing, and all three)
and evaluate on each of the four languages that
have test data (i.e. the former three and French),
excluding training combinations that include the
test language. Results are shown in Table 4.

When testing on French, we achieved the high-
est performance by training on German only
(75.8), followed closely by training on a combina-
tion of German and Spanish (75.7) and only Span-
ish (75.5). The worst performance was achieved
by training only on English (69.2), and the per-
formance also noticeably decreased for all training
combinations that included English.

When testing on German, language choice had a
weaker effect. The highest score came from com-
bining English and Spanish (73.4), but using only
one of those languages gave comparable results
(72.6 for Spanish, 73.0 for English).

For Spanish, the best results were achieved
when training only on German (72.6). Adding
English to the training languages decreased the

performance (70.8), which was even lower when
training only on English (69.1).

It is noteworthy that adding English to the train-
ing languages noticeably decreases performance
for both Spanish and French, but not for Ger-
man. One possible reason for Spanish and French
not benefiting from English when German does is
that both English and German are Germanic lan-
guages, whereas Spanish and French are Romance
languages. Another possible explanation for the
decrease of performance caused by training with
English is that there are inconsistencies in the way
MWEs in the datasets were labelled across lan-
guages, which we explore in Sec. 5.

We finally compare our cross-lingual models
against the state of the art: the best monolin-
gual system for Spanish and German, and the best
cross-lingual system for French, where no mono-
lingual systems exist. As Table 5 shows, our cross-
lingual models come close to the best monolingual
models for Spanish and especially for German.
This is remarkable given how simple our model
and features are, and that the approaches we com-
pare against train complex models for each lan-
guage. Furthermore, this points towards the possi-
bility of extending CWI to more languages which
lack training data.

Finally, Table 6 compares the coefficients for
models trained on Romance and Germanic lan-
guages. Notably, use of complex punctuation
(such as the hyphenation in “laser-activated” or
“drug-related”) and the number of tokens are in-
versely correlated w.r.t. the word or MWE being
complex. More words in the target was correlated
with complexity for English and German, and in-
versely correlated for Spanish.

5 Dataset Analysis

While examining our models’ incorrect predic-
tions, we observed inconsistencies in labelling in
the datasets between target MWEs and their sub-
words/sub-expressions (SWs).

The First CWI Shared Task (Paetzold and Spe-
cia, 2016) used the annotations of a group (i.e.
ten annotators on the training data) to predict the
annotation of an individual (i.e. one annotator on
the test data). The resulting inconsistencies in la-
belling may have contributed to the low F-scores
of systems in the task (Zampieri et al., 2017). Al-
though the Second CWI Shared Task improved on
the first by having multiple annotators for all splits
of the data, it contains some labelling inconsisten-
cies arising from annotators now being able to la-
bel phrases, and words within them, separately.

More concretely, we found that across all
datasets, 72% of MWEs contain at least one SW
with the opposite label (see Table 7). While this
makes sense in some cases, every SW in 25% of
MWE instances has the opposite label. For ex-
ample, “numerous falsifications and ballot stuff-
ing” is not annotated as complex, despite its SWs
“numerous”, “numerous falsifications”, “falsifica-
tions”, “ballot”, “ballot stuffing” and “stuffing” all
being complex. Conversely, “crise des marchés du
crédit” is complex, despite “crise”, “marchés” and
“crédit” being labelled non-complex. It is diffi-
cult to see how classifiers that extract features for
MWEs from their individual SWs could predict
the labels of both correctly.

Furthermore, every target MWE in the Spanish,
German and French datasets is labelled complex.
This may bias a classifier trained on the Span-
ish or German datasets towards learning MWEs
and long individual words (if length is a feature)
are complex. In particular, this observation may
help explain why adding English as a training lan-
guage decreased the performance of our cross-
lingual system when testing on French and Span-
ish (where all MWEs are complex). An analysis in
Bingel and Bjerva (2018) further found that their
cross-lingual French model was effective at pre-
dicting long complex words/MWEs but had diffi-
culty predicting long non-complex words.

labelled complex (C) and non-complex (NC), numbers

reg.) having the opposite label.

It is also worth noting that considering a word
or MWE as complex is subjective and may differ
from person to person, even within the same target
audience. Bingel et al. (2018) investigated predict-
ing complex words based on the gaze patterns of
children with reading difficulties. They found a
high degree of specificity in misreadings between
children, that is, which words they found complex
when reading aloud. This variety of complexity
judgements even within one target group points to-
wards the high degree of subjectivity in the task,
which may also partly explain the inconsistencies
in the dataset.

6 Conclusion and Future Work

The monolingual and cross-lingual models pre-
sented achieve comparable results against more
complex, language-specific state-of-the-art mod-
els, and thus can serve as strong baselines for
future research in CWI. In addition, our analy-
sis of the dataset could help in the design of bet-
ter guidelines when crowdsourcing annotations for
the task. Dataset creators may wish to only al-
low single words to be chosen as complex to avoid
labelling inconsistencies. In case MWEs are be-
ing permitted, we suggest instructing annotators
to chose the smallest part of a phrase they find
complex (French annotators for the Second CWI
Shared Task sometimes grouped individual com-
plex words into a complex MWE (Yimam et al.,
2018)).
