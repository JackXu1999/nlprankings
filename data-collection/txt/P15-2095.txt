Abstract 

In this article, we discuss the challenges of 

document summarization for the blind and 

visually impaired people and then propose 

a new system called BrailleSUM to pro-

duce better summaries for the blind and 

visually impaired people. Our system con-

siders the factor of braille length of each 

sentence in news articles into the ILP-

based summarization method. Evaluation 

results on a DUC dataset show that 

BrailleSUM can produce shorter braille 

summaries than existing methods, mean-

while, it does not sacrifice the content qual-

ity of the summaries. 

1 Introduction  

People with normal vision can read news docu-

ments with their eyes conveniently. However, ac-

cording to WHO’s statistics, up to October 2013, 

285 million people are estimated to be visually 

impaired worldwide: 39 million are blind and 246 

have low vision. Unfortunately, the large number 

of blind and visually impaired people cannot di-

rectly or conveniently read ordinary news docu-

ments like sighted people, and they have to read 

braille with their fingerprints or special equip-

ments, which brings much more burden to them. 

Braille is a special system with a set of symbols 

composed of small rectangular braille cells that 

contain tiny palpable bumps called raised dots 

used by the blind and visually impaired. It is tra-

ditionally written with embossed paper. Special 

equipments such as refreshable braille displays 

and braille embosser have been developed for the 

blind and visually impaired people to read or print 

on computers and other electronic supports.  

   Though some news materials have already been 

prepared in braille format for the blind people’s 

reading and learning, most daily news documents 

are written for sighted people, and it is necessary 

to first translate the news documents into Braille, 

and then the blind people can read the news with 

their fingertips. Speech synthesizers are also com-

monly used for the task (Freitas and Kouroupetro-

glou, 2008), but the way of reading braille texts is 

still popular in the daily life of the blind people, 

especially for the deaf-blind people.  

    As we know, document summarization is a very 

useful means for people to quickly read and 

browse news articles in the big data era. Existing 

summarization systems focus on content quality 

and fluency of summaries, and they usually ex-

tract several informative and diversified sentences 

to form a summary with a given length. The sum-

maries are produced for sighted people, but not for 

the blind and visually impaired people. A text 

summary can be translated into a braille summary 

for the blind and visually impaired people’s read-

ing, and the length of a braille summary is defined 

as the number of the braille cells in the summary.  

It is noteworthy that the shorter the braille sum-

mary is, the less burden the blind people have 

when reading the summary with their fingertips. 

The burden lies in the fact that reading a braille 

text by touching each braille cell with fingertips is 

more difficult and inconvenient than reading a 

normal text with eyes. So a braille summary is re-

quired to be as short as possible, while keeping the 

content quality and fluency.  

    In this study, we investigate the task of docu-

ment summarization for the blind and visually im-

paired people for the first time. We discuss the 

major challenges of document summarization for 

the blind and visually impaired people and then 

propose a new system called BrailleSUM to pro-

duce better summaries for them. Our system con-

siders the factor of braille length of each sentence 

in news articles into the ILP-based summarization 

method. Evaluation results on a DUC dataset 

show that BrailleSUM can produce much shorter 

braille summaries than existing methods, mean-

while, it does not sacrifice the content quality of 

the summaries. 

2 Related Work 

Most previous summarization methods are extrac-

tion-based, which directly rank and extract exist-

578



ing sentences in a document set to form a sum-

mary. Typical methods include the centroid-based 

method (Radev et al., 2004), NeATS (Lin and 

Hovy, 2002), supervised learning based methods 

(Ouyang et al., 2007; Shen  et al., 2007; Schilder 

and Kondadadi, 2008; Wong et al., 2008), graph-

based ranking (Erkan and Radev, 2004; Mihalcea 

and Tarau, 2005), Integer Linear Programming 

(Gillick et al., 2008; Gillick and Favre, 2009; Li 

et al., 2013), and submodular function (Lin and 

Bilmes, 2010). Moreover, cross-language docu-

ment summarization has been investigated (Wan 

et al., 2010), but the task focuses on how to select 

the translated sentences with good content quality. 

We can see that all existing summarization sys-

tems were proposed for sighted people, but not for 

the blind and visually impaired people. Document 

summarization for the blind and visually impaired 

people has its specialty and is worth exploring.  

    It has been a long way to help the blind and vis-

ually impaired people to browse information as 

conveniently as ordinary people. Special devices 

have been developed for achieving this long-term 

goal (Linvill and Bliss, 1966; Shinohara et al., 

1998). After the popularity of Braille, many kinds 

of braille display devices have been developed for 

braille reading (Rantala et al., 2009). In addition, 

most research in this area focused on how to im-

prove accessibility of web information for the 

blind people (Salampasis et al., 2005; Mahmud et 

al., 2007; Hadjadj and Burger, 1999). 

3 Preliminaries of Braille Grades 

Braille is a system of raised dots arranged in cells 

and it was developed by Louis Braille in the be-

ginning of the 19th century. Braille letters, com-

mon punctuation marks, and a few symbols are 

displayed as raised 6 dot braille cell patterns read 

by using a fingertip to feel the raised dots. The 

number and arrangement of these raised dots 

within a cell distinguish one character from an-

other. For example, the letters “a”, “b” and “c” are 

displayed as  , respectively. Due to the var-

ying needs of braille readers, there are different 

grades of braille. In this study we adopt grade 2 

braille – EBAE (English Braille America Edition). 

Grade 2 braille was a space-saving alternative to 

grade 1 braille. In grade 2 braille, a cell can repre-

sent a shortened form of a word. Many cell com-

binations have been created to represent common 

words, making this the most popular of the grades 

of braille. There are part-word contractions (e.g. 

“stand” → , “without” → ), which often 

stand in for common suffixes or prefixes, and 

whole-word contractions (e.g. “every” → , 

“knowledge” → ), in which a single cell repre-

sents an entire commonly used word. Words may 

be abbreviated by using a single letter to represent 

the entire word, using a special symbol to precede 

either the first or last letter of the word while trun-

cating the rest of the word, using a double-letter 

contraction such as "bb" or "cc", or removing 

most or all of the vowels in a word in order to 

shorten it. A complex system of styles, rules, and 

usage has been developed for this grade of braille. 

4 System Overview 

The focus of traditional summarization tasks is 

how to improve the content quality of a summary 

with a given length limit, and the content quality 

of a summary is measured by the overlap between 

the summary and reference summaries written by 

annotators. However, document summarization 

for the blind and visually impaired people is dif-

ferent from traditional summarization tasks. Be-

sides the content quality, the length of a braille 

summary is a very important factor to be consid-

ered, because the number of braille cells in a 

braille summary have a direct impact on the blind 

and visually impaired people when they read the 

summary with their fingertips, and more highly 

contracted braille is quicker to read, as shown in 

previous studies such as (Veispak et al., 2012). 

   Given a document set, our new summarization 

task aims to produce a braille summary, which are 

translated from a traditional textual summary with 

a predefined length (usually measured by the 

count of words). The braille summary is required 

to keep the content quality, measured by the con-

tent quality of the textual summary. Moreover, the 

braille length of the summary is required to be as 

short as possible. The length of a braille summary 

is defined as the number of the rectangular braille 

cells in the summary. The shorter the length is, the 

blind and visually impaired people will spend less 

time reading the summary with their fingertips 

and thus the summary is better. For simplicity, we 

define the braille length of a textual summary as 

the length of its translated braille summary. For 

example, the braille length of a text “hello, world!” 

is 9 since the length of its translated braille text 

 is 9.  

A basic solution to the new summarization task 

is first applying an existing summarization algo-

rithm (e.g. the most popular ILP-based method) to 

produce a summary, and then translating the sum-

mary into a braille summary, which is called Ba-

sicSUM. However, the braille translation is not a 

579



simple character-to-block conversion process and 

there exist various contractions during the transla-

tion process, as mentioned in the previous section. 

Two content-similar sentences may be translated 

into two braille sentences with totally different 

lengths due to the different word lengths and con-

version contractions.  Therefore, our solution is to 

consider the new factor of braille length of each 

sentence during the summarization process and 

produce a summary with shorter braille length 

while keeping its content quality. In our proposed 

BrailleSUM system, we incorporate the factor of 

braille length into the ILP-based summarization 

framework with a new ILP formulation.  

5 ILP-Based Braille Summarization 

In this study, we adopt the popular ILP-based 

summarization framework for addressing the new 

task of braille summarization. The concept-based 

ILP method for summarization is introduced by 

(Gillick et al., 2008; Gillick and Favre, 2009), and 

its goal is to maximize the sum of the weights of 

the language concepts (i.e. bigrams) that appear in 

the summary. The ILP method is very powerful 

for extractive summarization because it can select 

important sentences and remove redundancy at 

the same time. Formally, the ILP method can be 

represented as below: 

   𝑚𝑎𝑥 ∑ 𝑐𝑏𝑖𝑏𝑖
|𝐵|
𝑖=1                                     (1) 

subject to: 

    ∑ 𝑙𝑖
𝑁
𝑖=1 𝑠𝑖 ≤  𝐿𝑚𝑎𝑥                                     (2) 

∑ 𝑏𝑖 ≥ |𝐵𝑗|𝑠𝑗 𝑖∈𝐵𝑗 , for j = 1, …, N             (3) 

∑ 𝑠𝑗 ≥ 𝑏𝑖𝑗∈𝑆𝑖 ,  for i = 1, …,|B|                 (4) 

 𝑏𝑖 , 𝑠𝑗 ∈ {0,1}, ∀𝑖, 𝑗                                           
where: 

      𝑏𝑖 , 𝑠𝑗  are binary variables that indicate the pres-

ence of bigram i and sentence j, respectively; 

𝑐𝑏𝑖 is the document frequency of bigram 𝑏𝑖; 

B is the set of unique bigrams; 

𝐵𝑗  is the set of bigrams that sentence j contains. 

𝑆𝑖 is the set of sentences that contain bigram i. 
N is the count of the sentences; 

𝐿𝑚𝑎𝑥 is the maximum word count of the summary, 
which is set to 250 in the experiments; 

𝑙𝑖 is the word count of sentence i. 

Constraint (2) ensures that the total length of 

the selected sentences is limited by the given 

length limit. Inequalities (3)(4) associate the sen-

tences and bigrams. Constraint (3) ensures that se-

lecting a sentence leads to the selection of all the 

bigrams it contains, and constraint (4) ensures that 

selecting a bigram only happens when it is present 

in at least one of the selected sentences.

The new objective function for braille summa-

rization consists of two parts: the original part re-

flecting the content quality and the new part re-

flecting the braille length factor. The function is 

presented as below and the constraints are the 

same with (2)(3)(4). 

𝑚𝑎𝑥{(1 − 𝜆) ∑
𝑐𝑏𝑖

𝑏𝑖

𝐶

|𝐵|
𝑖=1 + 𝜆 ∑ 𝑏𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑒_𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑗𝑠𝑗

𝑁
𝑗=1 }     

(5) 

where 𝐶 = ∑ 𝑐𝑏𝑖𝑖∈𝐵  is a normalization constant to 

make the values of the two parts in the equation 

comparable. 𝜆 ∈ [0, 1] is a combination parame-
ter to reflect the different influences of the two 

parts.  𝑏𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑒_𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑗 is a new factor to reflect the 

suitability level of sentence j to be selected, which 

is computed as below: 

    𝑏𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑒_𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑗 =
𝑙𝑗

𝑏𝑙𝑗
                                   (6) 

where 𝑏𝑙𝑗 is the braille length of sentence j, and it 

is defined as the number of braille cells in the cor-

responding braille sentence. 𝑙𝑗 is the word count 

in the original sentence. As mentioned earlier, the 

number of characters and signs in an English sen-

tence is not equal to the number of the braille cells 

in the corresponding braille sentence, since grade 

2 braille is not based on a simple one-to-one con-

version from each character or sign to a braille cell. 

In this study, we adopt the open-source libbraille1 

tool for converting an English sentence into a 

braille sentence, and then get the braille length of 

the sentence. An example English sentence and its 

corresponding braille sentence are shown below: 
Infected feed cannot account for four cases. 

 
We can see that the number of characters and 

signs in the English sentence is 38, while the num-

ber of braille cells in the braille sentence is 26, and 

thus the braille length 𝑏𝑙𝑗  is 26. We can also 

simply know that the word count of the sentence 

𝑙𝑗  is 7. Thus the braille ratio of the sentence is 

7/26=0.269. We can see that if a sentence has a 

larger ratio of its word count to its braille length, 

then it is more suitable to be selected. Particularly, 

for two sentences with the same word count, the 

one with a shorter braille length is preferred. Note 

that since the sum of 𝑙𝑗 for the sentences in a sum-

mary is fixed, the sum of 𝑏𝑙𝑗  for the sentences 
should be as small as possible in order to maxim-

ize the second part in Equation (5). For the new 

objective function in Equation (5), the first part 

ensures the content quality, and the second part 

tries to make the braille length of the summary as 

short as possible. The combination of the two 

580



parts can achieve the two goals of our new sum-

marization task at the same time. If the combina-

tion parameter 𝜆 is set to 0, then the formulation 
in (5) is actually the same with (1).   

Finally, we solve the above linear programming 

problem by using the IBM CPLEX optimizer and 

get the English summary according the value of 

each variable 𝑠𝑗.  The corresponding braille sum-

mary can be produced after translation with lib-

braille. 

6 Evaluation 

In this study, we used the multi-document sum-

marization task in DUC2006 for evaluation. 

DUC2006 provided 50 document sets and a sum-

mary with a length limit of 250 words was re-

quired to be created for each document set. Refer-

ence summaries have been provided by NIST an-

notators. For simplicity, the topic description was 

ignored in this study. In the experiments, our pro-

posed BrailleSUM system with the new ILP 

method in Equation (5) was compared with the 

BasicSUM system with the traditional ILP 

method in Equation (1). The parameter 𝜆  in 
BrailleSUM is simply set to 1/4 (i.e. 0.25). 

Since the aim of our system is reducing the 

braille length of a summary without sacrificing its 

content quality, we evaluate the summaries from 

the following two aspects: First, we evaluate the 

content quality of the summaries by measuring the 

content overlap between the summaries and the 

reference summaries with the ROUGE-1.5.5 

toolkit (Lin and Hovy, 2003). In this study, we 

use three ROUGE recall scores in the experi-

mental results: ROUGE-1 (unigram-based), 

ROUGE-2 (bigram-based) and ROUGE-SU4 

(based on skip bigram with a maximum skip 

distance of 4). Second, we compute the braille 

length of each summary by summing the 

braille lengths of all the sentences in the sum-

mary, and then average the lengths across the 50 

document sets.  

The comparison results on summary content 

quality and average summary braille length are 

shown in Table 1. We can see that BrailleSUM 

and BasicSUM can achieve very similar ROUGE 

scores, and the score differences are non-signifi-

cant because the 95% confidence intervals are 

highly overlapped. The scores of BrailleSUM and 

BasicSUM are much higher than that of the NIST 

baseline and the average scores of all participating 

systems (i.e. AverageDUC). More importantly, 

BrailleSUM can produce summaries with much 

shorter braille lengths than BasicSUM, and the 

braille length reduction is significant. The results 

demonstrate that BrailleSUM can produce much 

shorter braille summaries while not sacrificing the 

summaries’ content quality. We can see that the 

incorporation of the braille length factor into the 

ILP framework is very effective for addressing the 

new summarization task. 

In order to show the influence of parameter λ in 

BrailleSUM, we vary λ from 0 to 1, and show the 

curves of ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 scores, and 

average braille length in Figures 1-3, respectively. 

We can see that with the increase of λ, the average 

braille length of the produced summaries is de-

creasing steadily. The result can be easily ex-

plained by that a larger λ means more considera-

tion of the braille length factor. We can also see 

from the figures that when λ is less than 0.3, the 

ROUGE scores usually keep steady and do not de-

cline significantly, but when λ is becoming larger, 

the ROUGE scores decline obviously. The results 

demonstrate that the content quality factor and the 

braille length factor need to be balanced with a 

proper value of λ.

(ROUGE Recall) and average summary braille length. (The 

95% confidence interval for each ROUGE score is reported 

in brackets; △bl means the reduction of average braille length 
over BasicSUM; * means the average braille length reduction 

over BasicSUM is statistically significant with p-

value=2.46975E-18 for t-test.)
