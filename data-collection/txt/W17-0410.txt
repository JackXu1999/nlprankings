Abstract

This article is about annotating clauses
with nonverbal predication in version 2
of Estonian UD treebank. Three possible
annotation schemas are discussed, among
which separating existential clauses from
copular clauses would be theoretically
most sound but would need too much man-
ual labor and could possibly yield incon-
cistent annotation. Therefore, a solution
has been adapted which separates exis-
tential clauses consisting only of subject
and (copular) verb olema be from all other
olema-clauses.

1 Introduction

This paper discusses the annotation problems and
research questions that came up during the anno-
tation of Estonian copular sentences while devel-
oping Estonian Universal Dependencies treebank,
especially while converting it from version 1 of
UD annotation guidelines to version 2.

Copular clauses are a sentence type in which the
contentful predicate is not a verb, but falls into
some other category. In some languages there is
no verbal element at all in these clauses; in other
languages there is a verbal copula joining the sub-
ject and the non-verbal element (Mikkelsen, 2011,
p. 1805).

In Estonian, there is mainly one verb, namely
olema ’be’, that functions as copula in copular
clauses. Estonian descriptive grammar (Erelt et
al., 1993) uses the term copular verb (Est ’köide’)
only for describing sentences with subject com-
plements, stating that in such sentences the verb
olema has only grammatical features of a predi-
cate (time, mode, person). Also, the copula olema
is semantically empty if used alone and it can not
have any other dependents than non-verbal pred-
icate. At the same time, verb olema is the most

frequent verb of Estonian language which can also
function as auxiliary verb in compound tenses, be
part of phrasal verbs, and may occur in existential,
possessor or cognizer sentences.

As the descriptive grammar of Estonian (Erelt
et al., 1993) lacks more detailed treatment of cop-
ular sentences, the label “copula” has not been in-
troduced into original Estonian Dependency Tree-
bank (EDT) (Muischnek et al., 2014). In copu-
lar clauses olema is annotated as the root of the
clause and other components of the sentence de-
pend on it; that is also the case if the sentence
contains a subject complement. As subject com-
plements have a special label PRD (predicative) in
EDT, such sentences can be easily searched.

Estonian treebank for UD v1.3 has been gener-
ated automatically from EDT using transfer rules.
The guidelines for UD v1 implied that subject
complements serve as roots in copular clauses.
This analysis of copula constructions, according
to UD v1 guidelines, extended to adpositional
phrases and oblique nominals as long as they have
a predicative function. By contrast, temporal and
locative modifiers were treated as dependents on
the existential verb ’be’.

Therefore, while converting EDT to UD v1,
sentences with subject complements were rela-
tively easily transferred to sentences with copular
tree structure (Muischnek et al., 2016). However,
oblique nominals and adpositional phrases were
not annotated as instances of nonverbal predica-
tion.

Since UD v 2.0 assumes a more general annota-
tion scheme for copular sentences, we faced sev-
eral conversion problems and also linguistic ques-
tions. This paper provides insights into these re-
search questions, gives an overview how copular
clauses are annotated in some UD v2 treebanks for
some other languages (Finnish, German, English)
and describes what are the options for annotating
Estonian sentences.

In the remainder of this paper, Section 2 we give
a short account of UD v2 guidelines for annotat-
ing copular clauses and show how these construc-
tions are annotated in some UD v2 treebanks for
Finnish, German and English. Section 3 is ded-
icated to copular constructions in Estonian lan-
guage and Estonian UD versions 1 and 2. Some
conclusions are drawn in Section 4.

2 UD annotation guidelines for
nonverbal predication

According to the UD annotation scheme version
1, copular constructions are to be annotated differ-
ently from other clause types, analysing the pred-
icative element as root and if there is an overt link-
ing verb present, it should be attached to this non-
verbal predicate as copula. The copula relation is
restricted to function words whose sole function
is to link a non-verbal predicate to its subject and
which does not add any meaning other than gram-
maticalised TAME categories. Such an analysis is
motivated by the fact that many languages often or
always lack an overt copula, so annotation would
be cross-linguistically consistent1.

Version 2 of UD annotation guidelines extend
the set of constructions that should be annotated
as instances of nonverbal predication, defining
six categories of nonverbal predication, namely
those of equation, attribution, location, posses-
sion, benefaction and existence2.

In order to get better overview of practical anno-
tation of copular constructions cross-linguistically,
we studied the v2 versions of UD treebanks of
Finnish, which is the most closely related lan-
guage to Estonian present in UD, and also German
and English. As the language-independent anno-
tation guidelines for UD version 2 were published
in the very end of last year, there are no language-
specific guidelines published yet. So we had to
rely on treebank queries in order to gain infor-
mation about annotating copular and related con-
structions in the afforementioned languages. We
queried UD v2 treebanks using the SETS treebank
search maintained by the University of Turku3.

There are two UD treebanks for Finnish: the
Finnish UD treebank, based on Turku Dependency
Treebank, and Finnish-FTB (FinnTreeBank). In

Finnish UD v2 treebank, clauses with olla ’be’ are
mostly regarded as instances of nonverbal predi-
cation, annotating olla as copula (1), among them
also possessive clauses (2). However, if the clause
contains only subject besides some form of olla,
olla is annotated as root (3).

In Finnish FTB v2 treebank more clause types
are annotated with olla as root, e.g. possessive
clause (4) and clause containing predicative adver-
bial (5). It seems that annotation of copular con-
structions in Finnish FTB resembles that in ver-
sion 1 of Estonian UD only subject complements
are annotated as roots in copular constructions.

In the UD v2 treebank of German, sentences
with subject complement are annotated as in-
stances of nonverbal predication (6) and other in-
stances of sein and werden ’be’ seem to be anno-
tated as main verbs, not copulas (7).

There are four English UD treebanks, but we
queried only the largest of them, the English Web
Treebank. It seems that predicative (e.g. Fig. 1)
and locative (Fig. 2) constructions are analysed as
instances of non-verbal predication, whereas exis-
tential clauses (Fig. 3) are not.

Figure 1: Predicative construction in the English
UD treebank.

Figure 2: Locative construction in the English UD
treebank.

Figure 3: Existential clause in the English UD
treebank.

As the above discussion illustrates, annota-
tion of copular constructions varies across differ-
ent languages and also across different treebanks.
Having better documentation for v2 treebanks
would facilitate better understanding of these dif-
ferences. It would also be helpful for those teams
which are still working on v2 of their treebanks to
make more informed decisions.

3 Copular and existential constructions
in Estonian

In Estonian, copular verb can not be omitted in
normal writing or speech. However, there are

some exceptions. First, copula is often omitted in
headlines like (8).

(8) Valitsus
Government

otsustusvõimetu
indecisive

’Government is indecisive.’

And due to time pressure, copula, but also other
verbs, can be omitted in online communication
(9).

(9) Ma
I

nii
so

kurb
sad

’I am so sad.’

As a sidenote, although ellipsis of verb olema
is rare in Estonian, it is still more frequent than in
Finnish (Kehayov, 2008).

The annotation guidelines for version 2 of
Universal Dependencies define six categories of
nonverbal predication that can be found cross-
linguistically (with or without a copula), namely
equation (aka identification), attribution, location,
possession, benefaction and existence.

As for Estonian, constructions expressing equa-
tion (10a), attribution (10b), location (10c), pos-
session (10d), benefaction (10e) or existence (10f)
are all coded using verb olema. In addition to the
afforementioned clause types, there are also cog-
nizer clauses (10g) that can be viewed as a sub-
type or metaphorical extension of the possessive
clause type. Perhaps also quantification clause
(10h) should be mentioned as a separate type.

Further in this section we will discuss three pos-
sible ways to annotate Estonian clauses containing
the (copular) verb olema.

Among the constructions (10 a-h), existential
clauses (f) are exceptional as they can consist also
only of subject and some form of verb olema.
In our opinion, such construction can not be an-
notated as an instance of nonverbal predication
as there is no possible predicate except the verb
olema. As for the sake of consistency, all existen-
tial clauses should be annotated in the same way,
i.e. as instances of verbal predication, not nonver-
bal, we would have to distinguish existential con-
structions from all other olema-clauses.

In what follows in this Section, we will study
if this solution can be applied while annotating
real corpus sentences. For that we have to find
out, if and how existential clauses can be iden-
tified. We start with investigating the linguistic
features of the existential clause type on the back-
ground of main clause types in Estonian. Subsec-
tion 3.1 presents the linguistic features of Estonian
existential constructions. Subsection 3.2 gives
overview of constructions annotated as instances
of nonverbal predication in version 1 of Estonian
UD treebank. In subsection 3.3 we discuss three
possibilities for annotating olema-clauses in Esto-
nian UD v2 and conclude the section with adopt-
ing a compromise solution.

3.1 Existential clauses in Estonian

Characteristic features of Estonian existential
clauses include the possibility of partitive subject
(the default case of Estonian subject is nomina-
tive) and inverted word order (subject comes after
verb), but existential clauses share these features
with possessive clauses and also some other mi-
nor clause types. In order to understand the prob-
lem, we start with a small overview of main clause
types in Estonian, explain how olema-clauses are
distributed among those clause types, paying spe-
cial attention to the existential clause type.

Descriptive grammars of Estonian (Erelt et al.,
1993, pp. 14–15) and (Erelt, 2003, pp. 43–46)

distinguish between three main clause types, de-
pending on whether syntactic subject, semantic
macrorole of actor and clause topic (theme) over-
lap, i.e. are coded by the same nominal. In so-
called normal clauses, the same nominal functions
as subject, actor and topic; in possessor-cognizer
clauses, the possessed or cognized entity is both
subject and topic, but not actor, which in turn de-
notes the possessor or cognizer. Subject noun de-
notes actor in existential clauses, but is rhematic.

Possessor-cognizer and existential clauses are
regarded as marked clause types, also termed in-
verted clauses (Erelt, 2003, pp. 93–55), as they
have inverted word order in pragmatically neutral
sentences - XVS instead of SVX, otherwise typi-
cal for “ordinary” Estonian sentences. Subjects of
these marked clause types can be in partitive case
form, while nominative is the unmarked and sta-
tistically dominant subject case.

A few remarks about the possible case forms of
subject in Estonian are in place here. Estonian de-
scriptive grammars (Erelt et al., 1993, p. 15) and
(Erelt, 2013, p. 36) state that existential and pos-
sessive clauses differ from other clause types in
the possibility of subject case alternation: the sub-
ject is mostly in partitive case form in negative
sentences (12), (14) and can be in partitive case
form also in affirmative sentences (11),(13) if the
referent of the subject noun is quantitatively un-
bounded.

Statistically, negation is the most powerful pre-
dictor of partitive subject (Miestamo, 2014). Of
the clause types defined in UD documentation,
existential clauses share the property of case-
alternating subject with possessive clauses, but
partitive subject is much less frequent in cognizer
clauses, which can otherwise be seen as a con-
structional extension of the possessive clause. Par-
titive subject is the only option in quantification
clause, regardless of its polarity, and in negative
possessive clause.

Existential clauses differ from other marked
clause types as they can consist also of subject
only, besides the verb olema; in this case the
clause merely states or negates the existence of an
entity denoted by subject (15). There is also a spe-
cial periphrastic verb form olema olemas (be be-
INE) used for stating that something exists (16).

3.2 Nonverbal predication in version 1 of
Estonian UD treebank

According to the first version of Universal Depen-
dencies’ guidelines, copular clauses consisting of
a noun or an adjective, which takes a single ar-
gument with the subject relation were to be anal-
ysed as instances of nonverbal predication. The
copula verb (if present) was attached to the pred-
icate with the “cop” relation. This analysis of
copula constructions was extended to adpositional
phrases and oblique nominals as long as they had
a predicative function. By contrast, temporal and
locative modifiers were to be treated as depen-
dents on the existential verb ’be’. So clauses con-
taining some copular verb were to be divided be-
tween categories of verbal and nonverbal predi-
cation. In version 1 of Estonian UD treebank,
only sentences containing verb olema and subject
complement in nominative or partitive case form

were annotated as instances of nonverbal predica-
tion (17). This was partly motivated by the fact
that subject complements were already annotated
using a special dependency relation (PRD) in our
original treebank, the Estonian Dependency Tree-
bank. All other copular clauses were annotated as
instances of verbal predication, annotating form of
verb olema as root (18).

3.3 Nonverbal predication in Estonian UD
version 2: three possible solutions

As already mentioned in Section 2, version 2 of
the Universal Dependencies’ guidelines extends
the number of constructions that fall into the cate-
gory of nonverbal predication.

Among the Estonian copular constructions
listed in the beginning of Section 3, existential
constructions only stating or negating the exis-
tence of an entity expressed by subject and consist-
ing only of verb olema and its subject (15) pose a
problem for UD v2 annotation scheme. We are on
the opinion that they can not be analysed as exam-
ples of nonverbal predication as one can not label
subject as a predicate, so in these sentences verb
form of olema ’be’ has to be annotated as root, not
as copula.

Thus we have three basic options for annotating
copular constructions in Estonian UD v2: always
annotate olema as copula; separate clauses con-
sisting of verb olema and its subject from all other
olema-clauses and, as third option, try to separate
existential clauses from other olema-clauses. The
fourth possible solution would be to stick to the so-
lution we had in version 1 of Estonian UD, namely
annotate only subject complements, i.e. nouns and
adjectives in nominative or partitive case form as
non-verbal predicates, but as this solution would
violate the guidelines for UD version 2, we will
not discuss it further.

We will take a closer look at the first three af-
forementioned options one by one.

83



Annotate all olema-clauses as instances of
nonverbal predication
This would be the most straightforward solution
from the point of view of UD v1 to v2 conversion
process. The main drawback would be having to
annotate subjects as predicates in clauses consist-
ing only of verb olema and its subject (Fig. 4).

Figure 4: A subject as a root, annotation of the
sentence (15).

Distinguishing subject-only clauses and other
olema-clauses
Second possible option would be to distinguish
two separate classes of olema-clauses basing on
simple syntactic criterion: if the sentence con-
sists only of some form of olema or periphrastic
verb olemas olema and its subject, then (olemas)
olema is annotated as root. All other sentences are
annotated as instances of nonverbal predication.
The distinction would be easy to make and the
main drawback would be that existential sentences
like (15) and (19) get different syntactic structures,
which can be regarded as an inconsistent solution.

poem-PL.PRT

’There was a concert yesterday where po-
ems were also chanted.’

Separate existentials and other olema-clauses
For the sake of consistency, all existential con-
structions should be annotated the same way, ir-
relevant whether they consist only of subject and
verb or do they have more syntactic participants.
This approach, although theoretically correct in
our opinion, is not easy to apply in annotation
practice.

As already described in subsection 3.1, Esto-
nian existential clauses are defined as those, which
subject is in partitive case in negative clauses and
can be in partitive case also in affirmative clauses.
In a pragmatically neutral affirmative clause, word
order distinguishes between locative (20) and ex-
istential clauses (21). Negative variants of these

clauses show the distinction - subject is in nomi-
native case form in locative clause (22) and in par-
titive case form in existential clause (23). The ex-
ample sentences are of course simplifications, es-
pecially with regard to word order; in the corpus
sentences the word order does not distinguish ex-
istential clauses as it is determined mostly by in-
formation structure and depends heavily on larger
textual context.

(20) Koer
Dog

on
is

aias.
garden-INE

’Dog is in the garden.’

(21) Aias
garden-INE

on

koer.
dog

’There is a dog in the garden.’

(22) Koer

garden-INE

’Dog is not in the garden.’

(23) Aias
garden-INE

ei
not

ole
is

koera.
dog-PRT

’There is no dog in the garden.’

So, if we would like to apply this solution, it
would mean that human annotators have to go over
all affirmative clauses that could possibly be exis-
tential clauses and make the distinction basing on
their intuitions about the probable subject case in
the negative counterpant of the affirmative clause
under consideration - which means that there has
to be more than one annotator for every clause.
But Peep Nemvalts (2000), who has analysed Es-
tonian existential sentences, comparing them with
the same phenomenon in other languages, has con-
cluded that it is impossible to distinguish Estonian
existential sentences basing on formal criteria.

Therefore, after considering all possible solu-
tions for distinguishing copular and non-copular
usages of olema ’be’, we had to make a compro-
mise and adopt the second possible solution, i.e.
distinguish subject-only clauses and other olema-
clauses. In resulting annotated treebank, existen-
tial clauses are divided between instances of verbal
and non-verbal predication, which can be regarded
as a drawback. On the other hand, the resulting an-
notation is consistent, which is a clear advantage.

4 Conclusion

Universal Dependencies is planned to offer
language-typologically relevant and cross-
linguistically consistent annotation guidelines

84



for building dependency treebanks (Nivre et al.,
2016). Its version 2, published only a few months
ago, introduced a major change concerning
annotating nonverbal predication: the repertoire
of clauses that should be treated as examples of
nonverbal predication was considerably broad-
ened. Often real corpus data is a challenge even
for well-premeditated theoretical constructs; even
more so if this corpus data comes in more than 50
languages. So it should not be a surprise that there
are still some open issues or inconsistencies.

This article tackled the problems concerning
defining and annotating copular constructions in
Estonian, with some brief cross-linguistic compar-
ison.

We came forward with three possible annota-
tion schemas, among which separating existential
clauses from copular clauses would be theoreti-
cally most sound but would need too much manual
labor and would possibly result in inconcistent an-
notation. So we will adapt the solution that, some-
what artificially, separates existential clauses con-
sisting only of subject and (copular) verb olema
from all other olema-clauses.

It seems that delimiting and annotating nonver-
bal predication and related phenomena is not en-
tirely consistent cross-linguistically. In this ar-
ticle we had a look at a very small set of lan-
guages, but the analysis of nonverbal predication
and copular constructions from a cross-linguistic
(or cross-treebank) perspective deserves in-depth
study. For the sake of better understanding the ex-
act annotation of linguistic phenomena in different
languages, thorough documentation of principles
and decisions underlying the annotation would be
beneficial.

As for Estonian UD treebank, the solution that
at the first glance seemed most correct from the
linguistic point of view, is (almost) impossible to
achieve even by manual annotation.
