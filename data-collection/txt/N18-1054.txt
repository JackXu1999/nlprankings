Abstract

For over a decade, machine learning has been
used to extract opinion-holder-target struc-
tures from text to answer the question Who ex-
pressed what kind of sentiment towards what?.
Recent neural approaches do not outperform
the state-of-the-art feature-based models for
Opinion Role Labeling (ORL). We suspect
this is due to the scarcity of labeled train-
ing data and address this issue using differ-
ent multi-task learning (MTL) techniques with
a related task which has substantially more
data, i.e. Semantic Role Labeling (SRL). We
show that two MTL models improve signif-
icantly over the single-task model for label-
ing of both holders and targets, on the devel-
opment and the test sets. We found that the
vanilla MTL model which makes predictions
using only shared ORL and SRL features, per-
forms the best. With deeper analysis we deter-
mine what works and what might be done to
make further improvements for ORL.

1 Introduction

Fine-Grained Opinion Analysis (FGOA) aims to:
(i) detect opinion expressions (O) that convey at-
titudes such as sentiments, agreements, beliefs or
intentions (like feared in example (1)), (ii) mea-
sure their intensity (e.g. strong), (iii) identify their
holders (H), i.e. entities that express an attitude
(e.g. it), (iv) identify their targets (T), i.e. enti-
ties or propositions at which the attitude is di-
rected (e.g. violence) and (v) classify their target-
dependent attitude (e.g. negative sentiment)1.

As the commonly accepted benchmark corpus

notations to represent opinion entities (opinions,

holders and targets), the task is usually approached
with sequence labeling techniques and the BIO
encoding scheme (Choi et al., 2006; Yang and
Cardie, 2013; Katiyar and Cardie, 2016). Initially
pipeline models were proposed which first pre-
dict opinion expressions and then, given an opin-
ion, label its opinion roles, i.e. holders and tar-
gets (Kim and Hovy, 2006; Johansson and Mos-
chitti, 2013). Pipeline models have been sub-
stituted with so-called joint models that simulta-
neously identify all opinion entities, and predict
which opinion role is related to which opinion
(Choi et al., 2006; Yang and Cardie, 2013; Katiyar
and Cardie, 2016). Recently an LSTM-based joint
model was proposed (Katiyar and Cardie, 2016)
that unlike the prior work (Choi et al., 2006; Yang
and Cardie, 2013) does not depend on external re-
sources (such as syntactic parsers or named en-
tity recognizers). The neural variant does not out-
perform the feature-based CRF model (Yang and
Cardie, 2013) in Opinion Role Labeling (ORL).

Both the neural and the CRF joint models
achieve about 55% F1 score for predicting which
targets relate to which opinions in MPQA. Thus,
these models are not yet ready to answer the ques-
tion this line of research is usually motivated with:
Who expressed what kind of sentiment towards
what?. Our goal is to investigate the limitations
of neural models in solving different subtasks of
FGOA on MPQA and to gain a better understand-
ing of what is solved and what is next.

We suspect that one of the fundamental obsta-
cles for neural models trained on MPQA is its
small size. One way to address scarcity of labeled
data is to use multi-task learning (MTL) with ap-
propriate auxiliary tasks. A promising auxiliary
task candidate for ORL is Semantic Role Labeling
(SRL), the task of predicting predicate-argument
structure of a sentence, which answers the ques-
tion Who did what to whom, where and when?.

SRL4ORL. The semantic roles of the predicate
fear (marked blue bold) correspond to the opin-
ion roles H and T, according to MPQA. For this
reason, the output of SRL systems has been com-
monly used for feature-based FGOA models (Kim
and Hovy, 2006; Johansson and Moschitti, 2013;
Choi et al., 2006; Yang and Cardie, 2013). Ad-
ditionally, a considerable amount of training data
is available for training SRL models (Table 2 in
Sec. 3), which made neural SRL models success-
ful (Zhou and Xu, 2015; Yang and Mitchell, 2017).

Obstacles. Although SRL is similar in nature
to ORL, it cannot solve ORL for all cases (Rup-
penhofer et al., 2008). In example (2) holder and
target of the predicate please correspond to A1, A0
semantic roles respectively, wheres for the predi-
cate fear in (1) holder and target correspond to A0,
A1 respectively. We took into account this ob-
servation when deciding on an appropriate MTL
model by splitting its parameters into shared and
task-specific ones (i.e. hard-parameter sharing).

cil has now approved the Kyoto Protocol

ratification]A0T .

A further obstacle for properly exploiting SRL
training data with MTL could be specificities, in-
consistency and incompleteness of the MPQA an-
notations. In example (3), Rice expressed his
negative sentiment towards the three countries in
question by setting the criteria which states some-
thing negative about those countries: they are re-
pressive and grave human rights violators [...]. In
this case, the model should not pick any local se-
mantic role for the target.

(3) The criteria [set by]Oneg [Rice]H are the fol-
lowing: [the three countries in question]T are

repressive and grave human rights violators,
and aggressively seeking weapons [...].

In examples (4–5), the same opinion expression
concerned realizes different scopes for the target.
A model which exploits SRL knowledge could be
biased to always label targets as complete SRL
role constituents, as in example (5).

(4) Rice told us [the administration]H was
[concerned]Oneg that [Iraq]T would take ad-
vantage of the 9/11 attacks.

(5) [The Chinese government]H is deeply
[concerned]Oneg about [the sudden deterio-
ration in the Middle East situation]T , Tang
said.

Regarding incompleteness, prior work (Kati-
yar and Cardie, 2016) has shown that their model
makes reasonable predictions in sentences which
do not have annotations at all, e.g. [mothers]H
[care]O for [their young]T , in: From the fact that
mothers care for their young, we can not deduce
that they ought to do so, Hume argued.

The examples above show that incorporating
SRL knowledge via multi-task learning is a rea-
sonable way to improve ORL, but at the same time
they alert us that given the specificities of MPQA
and ORL annotations in general, it is not obvious
whether MTL can overcome divergences in the an-
notation schemes of opinion and semantic role la-
beling. We investigate this research question by
adopting one of the recent successful architectures
for SRL (Zhou and Xu, 2015) and experiment with
different multi-task learning frameworks.

Our contributions are: (i) we adapt a recently
proposed neural SRL model for ORL, (ii) we en-
hance the model using different MTL techniques
with SRL to tackle the problem of scarcity of la-
beled data for ORL, (iii) we show that most of the
MTL models improve the single-task model for la-
beling of both holders and targets on development
and test sets, and two of them make yield signif-
icant improvements, (iv) by deeper analysis we
provide a better understanding of what is solved
and where to head next for neural ORL.

2 Neural MTL for SRL and ORL

Neural multi-task learning (MTL) receives a lot of
attention and new MTL architectures emerge reg-
ularly. Yet there is no clear consensus which MTL
architecture to use in which conditions. We exper-
iment with well-received architectures that could
adapt to different cases of ORL from Section 1.

As a general neural architecture for single- and
multi-task learning we use the recently proposed
SRL model (Zhou and Xu, 2015) (Z&X-STL)
which successfully labels semantic roles without
any syntactic guidance. This model consists of a
stack of bi-directional LSTMs and a CRF which
makes the final prediction. The inputs to the first
LSTM are not only token embeddings but three
additional features: embedding of the predicate,
embedding of the context of the predicate and an
indicator feature (1 if the current token is in the
predicate context, 0 otherwise). Thus, every sen-
tence is processed as many times as there are pred-
icates in it. Adapting this model for labeling of
opinion roles is straightforward, the only differ-
ence being that opinion expressions can be multi-
words and only two opinion roles are assigned.

MTL techniques aim to learn several tasks
jointly by leveraging knowledge from all tasks. In
the context of neural networks, MTL is commonly
used in such a way that it is predefined which
layers have tied parameters and which are task-
specific (i.e. hard-parameter sharing). There are
various ways of defining which parameters should
be shared and how to train them.

Fully-shared (FS) MTL model. A fully-shared
model (Fig. 1) shares all parameters of the general
model except the output layer. Each task has a
task-specific output layer which makes the predic-
tion based on the representation produced by the
final LSTM. When training on a mini-batch of a
certain task, parameters of the output layer of the

other tasks are not updated. This model should
be effective for constructions with a clear mapping
between opinion and semantic roles such as {H 7→
A0, T 7→ A1} as in example (1) (Sec. 1).

Hierarchical MTL (H-MTL) model. For NLP
applications, often some given (high-level) task
is supposed to benefit from another (low-level)
task more than the other way around, e.g. parsing
from POS tagging. This intuition lead to design-
ing hierarchical MTL models (Søgaard and Gold-
berg, 2016; Hashimoto et al., 2017) in which pre-
dictions for low-level tasks are not made on the
basis of the representation produced at the final
LSTM, but on the representation produced by a
lower-layer LSTM (Fig. 2). Task-specific layers
atop shared layers could potentially give the model
more power to distinguish or ignore certain se-
mantic roles. If so, this MTL model is more suit-
able for examples like (2) and (3) (Sec. 1).

Shared-private (SP) MTL model. In the state-
private model, in addition to the stack of shared
LSTMs, each task has a stack of task-specific
LSTMs (Liu et al., 2017) (Fig. 3). Representa-
tions at the outermost shared LSTM and the task-
specific LSTM are concatenated and passed to the
task-specific output layer. The ORL representa-
tion produced independently from SRL gives the
model the ability to utilize the shared and entirely
task-specific information. For labeling of targets,
it is expected that for examples (1) & (5) the model
relies mostly on the shared representation, for ex-
amples (2) & (4) on both shared and ORL-specific
representations, and for example (3) solely on the
ORL-specific representation.

Adversarial shared-private (ASP) model.
The limitation of the SP model is that it does
not prevent the shared layers from capturing task-
specific features. To ensure this, ASP extends the

SP model with a task discriminator (Liu et al.,
2017). The task discriminator (Fig. 3, marked red)
predicts to which task the current batch of data
belongs, based on the representation produced by
the shared LSTMs. If the shared LSTMs are task-
invariant, the discriminator should perform badly.
Thus, we update the shared parameters to maxi-
mize the discriminator’s cross-entropy loss. At the
same time we want the discriminator to challenge
the shared LSTMs, so we update the discrimi-
nator’s parameters to minimize its cross-entropy
loss. This minmax optimization is known as ad-
versarial training and recently it gained a lot of
attention for NLP applications (Liu et al., 2017;
Chen et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2017; Qin et al.,
2017; Wu et al., 2017; Gui et al., 2017; Li et al.,
2017; Zhang et al., 2017; Joty et al., 2017).

3 Experimental setup

3.1 Datasets
For SRL we use the newswire CoNLL-2005
shared task dataset (Carreras and Màrquez, 2005),
annotated with PropBank predicate-argument
structures. Sections 2-21 of the WSJ corpus (Char-
niak et al., 2000) are used for training and section
24 as dev set. The test set consists of section 23 of
WSJ and 3 sections of the Brown corpus.

For ORL we use the manually annotated MPQA
2.0. corpus (Wiebe et al., 2005; Wilson, 2008). It
mostly contains news documents, but also travel
guides, transcripts of spoken conversations, e-
mails, fundraising letters, textbook chapters and
translations of Arabic source texts.

We report detailed pre-processing of MPQA4

and data statistics in the Supplementary Material.

3.2 Evaluation metrics
For both tasks we adopt evaluation metrics from
prior work. For SRL, precision is defined as the
proportion of semantic roles predicted by a system

naacl-mpqa-srl4orl/blob/master/generate_
mpqa_jsons.py.

which are correct, recall is the proportion of gold
roles which are predicted by a system, F1 score is
the harmonic mean of precision and recall.

In case of ORL, we report 10-fold CV5 and re-
peated 4-fold CV with binary F1 score and propo-
rtional F1 score, for holders and targets separately.
Binary precision is defined as the proportion of
predicted holders (targets) that overlap with the
gold holder (target), binary recall is the proportion
of gold holders (targets) for which the model pre-
dicts an overlapping holder (target). Proportional
recall measures the proportion of the overlap be-
tween a gold holder (target) and an overlapping
predicted holder (target), proportional precision
measures the proportion of the overlap between a
predicted holder (target) and an overlapping gold
holder (target). F1 scores are the harmonic means
of the corresponding precision and recall.

3.3 Training details

We evaluate our models using two evaluation set-
tings. First, we follow Katiyar and Cardie (2016)
which set aside 132 documents for development
and used the remaining 350 documents for 10-fold
CV. However, in the 10-fold CV setting, the size
of the tests sets is 3 times smaller than the dev set
size (Table 2, row 3), and, consequently, results in
high-variance estimates on the test sets. Therefore
we additionally evaluate our models with 4-fold
CV. We set aside 100 documents for development
and use 25% of the remaining documents for test-
ing. The resulting test sets are comparable in size
to the dev set (Table 2, row 2). We run 4-fold CV
twice with two different random seeds. We do not
tune hyperparameters (HPs), but follow suggesti-
ons proposed in the thorough HP study for seque-
nce labeling tasks (Reimers and Gurevych, 2017).
HPs can be found in the Supplementary Material.

tions) and the standard deviation of all models in
Table 4. Evaluation metrics follow Section 3.2.

We mark significant difference between MTL
models and the single-task (Z&X-STL) model,
observed using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov signifi-
cance test (p < 0.05) (Massey Jr, 1951), with • in
superscript and between the FS-MTL model and
other MTL models with 3.

STL vs. MTL. In the 10-fold CV evaluation
setting (Table 3), the FS-MTL and the H-MTL
models improve over the Z&X-STL model in all
evaluation measures, for both holders and targets.
When evaluated in the repeated 4-fold CV setting
(Table 4), all MTL models improve over the Z&X-
STL model in all evaluation measures, for both
holders and targets.

The FS-MTL and the H-MTL models improve
significantly in all evaluation measures, for both
holders and targets, on both dev and test sets, when
evaluated with repeated 4-fold CV. With 10-fold
CV the improvements are also significant, except
for targets on the test set. This is probably due
to the small size of the test sets (Table 2, row 3),
which results in a high-variance estimate. Indeed,
standard deviations on the 10-fold CV test sets are
always much higher compared to the dev set or to
the test sets of 4-fold CV.

It is not surprising that larger improvements are
visible in the labeling of holders. They are usually
short, less ambiguous and often presented with the

A0 semantic role, whereas annotating targets is a
challenging task even for humans.6

Larger improvements are visible for propor-
tional F1 score than for binary F1 score. That is,
more data and SRL knowledge helps the model to
better annotate the scope of opinion roles.

Comparing MTL models. In Section 2 we in-
troduced MTL models with task-specific LSTM
layers hypothesizing that these layers should give
MTL models more power to adapt to a variety of
potentially problematic cases that we illustrated in
the Introduction. However, our results show that
the FS-MTL model performs significantly better
or comparable to MTL models that include task-
specific layers. Reimers and Gurevych (2017)
show that MTL is especially sensitive to the selec-
tion of HPs. Thus, a firm and solid comparison of
the different MTL models requires thorough HP
optimization, to properly control the number of
parameters and regularization of the models. We
leave HP optimization for future work.

5 Analysis

Our aim in this section is to analyze what the pro-
posed models are good at, in which ways MTL im-
proves over the single-task ORL model and what
could be done to achieve further progress.

models on the ORL dev set using 4-fold CV re-
peated twice with different seeds (8 evaluation tri-
als). We say that a model predicts a role of a
given opinion expression correctly if the model
predicts a role that overlaps with the correct role
in at least 6 out of 8 evaluation trials. If a model
predicts a role that overlaps with the correct role
in at most 2 out of 8 trials, we say that the model
predicts the role incorrectly. The requirement on
6-8 (in)correct predictions reduces the risk of an-
alyzing inconsistent predictions and enables us to

draw firmer conclusions. We analyze the follow-
ing scenarios:

(i) both the FS-MTL model and the Z&X-STL
model make correct predictions (Tables 5–6)

(ii) the FS-MTL model makes a correct predic-
tion, while the Z&X-STL makes an incorrect
prediction (Tables 11–12)

(iii) both models make wrong predictions (Tables
9–10)

In the following, we categorize predictions in
case (i) as easy cases, and predictions in case (iii)
as hard cases.

In Tables 5–6 and 9–12, the opinion expression
is bolded, the correct role is italicized, predictions
of the FS-MTL model are colored blue (subscript
FS), predictions of the Z&X-STL model are col-
ored yellow (subscript ZX) and green marks pre-
dictions where both models agree. For simplic-
ity, we show only holders or targets, although the
models predict both roles jointly.

What works well? There are 668/1055 in-
stances in the dev set for which both models pre-
dict holders correctly, and 663/1055 for targets.

cases) are subjects of their governing heads or A0
roles. The statistics in Table 7 (col. 1, rows 2–
3) supports this observation.7 In contrast, holders
that both models predict incorrectly (hard cases)
are less frequently subjects or A0 roles (col. 2,
rows 2–3). Also, easy holders are close to the cor-
responding opinion expression: the average dis-
tance is 1.54 tokens (Table 7, row 4), contrary to
the hard holders with the average distance of 7.56.

Examples 1–5 in Table 6 suggest that targets
that can be properly labeled by both models are
objects of their governing heads or A1 roles. Ta-
ble 8, row 3, shows that the majority of the easy
targets are indeed A1 roles, in contrast to the hard
targets. Similar to holders, the easy targets are in
average 7 tokens closer to the opinion expression.

both models predict holders incorrectly, and 176
for targets.

As we have seen so far, many holders that are
subjects or A0 roles, and targets that are A1 roles,
are properly labeled by both models. However, a
considerable amount of such holders and targets
are not correctly predicted (Table 7–8, col. 2, rows
2–3). Thus our models do not work flawlessly for
all such cases. A distinguishing property of the
hard cases is the distance of the role from the opin-
ion. Thus, future work should advance the model’
s ability to capture long-range dependencies.

Examples in Table 9 demonstrate that holders,
harder to label with our models, occur with the
corresponding opinions in more complicated syn-
tactic constructions. In the first example, the FS-
MTL model does not recognize the possessive and
is possibly biased towards picking the country (Is-
real), which occurs immediately after the opinion.
In the second example, the opinion expression is

a nominal predicate and the holder is its object.
The sentence is in passive voice but the models
probably interpret it in the active voice and thus
make the wrong prediction. In the third exam-
ple, the opinion expression is the head of the rel-
ative clause that modifies the holder. These ex-
amples raise the following questions: would im-
proved consistency with syntax lead to improve-
ments for ORL and could we train a dependency
parsing model with SRL and ORL to help the
models handle syntactically harder cases?

Example 4 shows that holders specific to the
MPQA annotation schema are hard to label as they
require inference skills: from the department said,
we can defeasibly infer that it is the department
who expects [this cost] to stand at just $400/year
[...]. To handle such cases, it would be worth try-
ing training our models jointly with models for
recognizing textual entailment.

Examples 6–7 illustrate that some gap in per-

formance stems from difficulties in processing
MPQA. Example 5 has no gold holder, but the
models make plausible predictions. For example
6, FS-MTL predicts the discontinuous holder they
... all, while MPQA allows only contiguous enti-
ties. Therefor our evaluation scripts interpret they
and all as two separate holders and deem all as
incorrect, resulting with lower precision. Finally,
for example 7 our models make plausible predic-
tions. However, the gold holder is always the en-
tity from the coreference cluster that is the closest
to the opinion.8 The evaluation scripts needs to be
extended such that predicting any entity from the
coreference cluster is considered to be correct. To
conclude, to better evaluate future developments,
it would be worth curating MPQA instances with
missing roles and extending evaluation to account
for coreferent holders and discontinuous roles.

The examples in Table 10 demonstrate that dif-

ficulties in labeling targets originate from simi-
lar reasons as for holders. Examples 1–3 demon-
strate complex syntactic constructions, examples
4–6 MPQA-specific annotations that require infer-
ence and example 7 exemplifies a missing target.

How does MTL help? There are 18/1055 in-
stances in the dev set for which the FS model pre-
dicts the holder correctly and the Z&X-STL model
does not, and 19/1055 for targets.

For holders, for 9 out 18 of such examples, the
Z&X-STL model does not predict anything (as in
examples 2–5 in Table 11). From examples 1–
5 we notice that SRL data helps to handle more
complex syntactic constructions. From examples
5–7 we observed that using MTL with SRL helps
to handle cases when more than one person or or-
ganization is present in the close neighborhood of
the opinion. For targets, for 11 out of 18 cases the
Z&X-STL model does not predict anything as in
examples 1–2 in Table 11. We conclude that the
greatest improvements from the FS-MTL model
comes from having far fewer missing roles.

FGOA. Closest to our work are Yang and Cardie
(2013) (Y&C) and Katiyar and Cardie (2016)
(K&C). They as well label both holders and targets
in MPQA. By contrast, our focus is on the task of
ORL. We thus refrain from predicting opinion ex-
pressions first, to ensure a reproducible evaluation
setup on a fixed set of gold opinion expressions.
The MTL models we develop in this work will,
however, be the basis for the full task in a later
stage. Because of these differences, direct com-
parison to Y&C and K&C is not possible. How-
ever, if we compare our results we notice a big gap
that demonstrates that opinion expression extrac-
tion is the import step in FGOA. Similar to K&C,
Liu et al. (2015) jointly labels opinion expressions
and their targets in reviews.

Some work focuses entirely on labeling of opin-
ion expressions (Yang and Cardie, 2014; Irsoy
and Cardie, 2014). Other work looks into spe-
cific subcategories of ORL: opinion role induction
for verbal predicates (Wiegand and Ruppenhofer,
2015), categorization of opinion words into actor
and speaker view (Wiegand et al., 2016b), opinion
roles extraction on opinion compounds (Wiegand
et al., 2016a). Wiegand and Ruppenhofer (2015)
report 72.54 binary F1 score for labeling of hold-
ers in MPQA (results for targets are not reported).

Neural SRL. New neural SRL models have
emerged (He et al., 2017; Yang and Mitchell,
2017; Marcheggiani and Titov, 2017) since we
started this work. In future work we can improve
our models with such new proposals.

Auxiliary tasks for MTL. Other work inves-
tigates under which conditions MTL is effective.
Martı́nez Alonso and Plank (2017) show that the
best auxiliary tasks have low kurtosis of labels
(usually a small label set) and high entropy (la-
bels occur uniformly). We show that the best MTL
model for ORL is the model which uses shared
layers only. Thus it seems reasonable to consider
only a small and uniform SRL label set {A0, A1}.

Bingel and Søgaard (2017) show that MTL
works when the main task has a flattening learn-
ing curve, but the auxiliary task curve is still steep.
We notice such behavior in our learning curves.

7 Conclusions

We address the problem of scarcity of annotated
training data for labeling of opinion holders and
targets (ORL) using multi-task learning (MTL)
with Semantic Role Labeling (SRL). We adapted
a recently proposed neural SRL model for ORL
and enhanced it with different MTL techniques.
Two MTL models achieve significant improve-
ments with all evaluation measures, for both hold-
ers and targets, on both dev and test set, when eval-
uated with repeated 4-fold CV. We recommend
evaluation with comparable dev and test set sizes
for future work, as this enables more reliable eval-
uation.

With deeper analysis we show that future devel-
opments should improve the ability of the models
to capture long-range dependencies, investigate if
consistency with syntax can improve ORL, and
consider other auxiliary tasks such as dependency
parsing or recognizing textual entailment. We em-
phasize that future improvements can be measured
more reliably if opinion expressions with missing
roles are curated and if the evaluation considers
all mentions in opinion role coreference chains as
well as discontinuous roles.
