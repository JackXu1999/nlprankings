Abstract

The cross-lingual pronoun prediction task
at WMT 2016 requires to restore the miss-
ing target pronouns from source text and
target lemmatized and POS-tagged trans-
lations. We study the benefits for this task
of a specific Pronoun Language Model
(PLM), which captures the likelihood of
a pronoun given the gender and number
of the nouns or pronouns preceding it, on
the target-side only. Experimenting with
the English-to-French subtask, we select
the best candidate pronoun by applying
the PLM and additional heuristics based
on French grammar rules to the target-side
texts provided in the subtask. Although
the PLM helps to outperform a random
baseline, it still scores far lower than sys-
tem using both source and target texts.

1 Introduction

The translation of pronouns has been recognized
as a challenge since the early years of machine
translation (MT), as pronoun systems do not map
1:1 across languages. Recently, specific strategies
for translating pronouns have been proposed and
evaluated, as reviewed by Hardmeier (2014, Sec-
tion 2.3.1) and by Guillou (Guillou, 2016).

Following the DiscoMT 2015 shared task on
pronoun-focused translation (Hardmeier et al.,
2015), the goal of the 2016 WMT pronoun shared
task (Guillou et al., 2016) is to compare systems
that are able to predict the translation of a source
pronoun among a small, closed set of target can-
didates. The task was proposed for four lan-
guage pairs: English/German and English/French,
in both directions. Besides the original source
documents (transcripts of TED talks), participants
were given the formatted target documents, where

all words were lemmatized and POS-tagged, and
all pronouns were hidden. Participants were re-
quired to restore (or predict) each translated pro-
noun, in a fully inflected form.

We participate in the subtask of English-to-
French pronoun prediction, with the main goal of
testing the merits of a simple target-only approach.
In previous work, we found that this approach
improved the translation of neuter English pro-
nouns it and they into French, and outperformed
the DiscoMT 2015 baseline by about 5% relative
improvement on an automatic metric (Luong and
Popescu-Belis, 2016). Our method uses only the
fact that the antecedent of a pronoun is likely to
be one of the noun phrases preceding it closely.
Therefore, if a majority of these nouns exhibit the
same gender and number, it is more likely that
the correct French pronoun agrees in gender and
number with them. We model this majority gen-
der and number as a Pronoun Language Model
(PLM, see Luong and Popescu-Belis (2016)). This
knowledge-lean approach does not make any hy-
pothesis on which of the nouns is the antecedent,
though it is augmented, for the 2016 shared task,
with language-dependent grammar heuristics to
determine the right candidate for neuter French
pronouns, which are less constrained in gender
and number.

In what follows, after introducing briefly the
method (Section 3), we explain how to represent
these intuitions in a formal probabilistic model –
the PLM – that is learned from French data (Sec-
tion 4) and we describe the grammar heuristics
to deal with neuter pronouns as well (Section 5).
Then, we show how these two resources are used
to determine the target pronoun as required by the
2016 shared task (Section 6) and we analyze our
results for both development and test sets (Sec-
tion 7), showing that the benefits of our system
remain inferior to those of systems using both the

589



source and the target sides. But first, we present a
brief state of the art in pronoun translation in order
to compare our proposal with related work.

2 Related Work

Several previous studies have attempted to im-
prove pronoun translation by integrating anaphora
resolution with statistical MT. Le Nagard and
Koehn (2010) trained an English-French transla-
tion model on an annotated corpus in which each
occurrence of English pronouns it and they was an-
notated with the gender of its antecedent in the tar-
get side, but this could not outperform a baseline
that was not aware of coreference links. Hard-
meier and Federico (2010) integrated a word de-
pendency model into an SMT decoder as an ad-
ditional feature function, to keep track of source
antecedent-anaphor pairs, which improved the
performance of their English-German SMT sys-
tem.

Following a similar strategy, in our previous
work (Luong et al., 2015), we linearly combined
the score obtained from a coreference resolu-
tion system with the score from the search graph
of the Moses decoder, to determine whether an
English-French SMT pronoun translation should
be post-edited into the opposite gender (e.g. il →
elle). Their system performed best among six par-
ticipants on the pronoun-focused shared task at
the 2015 DiscoMT workshop (Hardmeier et al.,
2015), but still remained below the SMT baseline.

A considerable set of coreference features, used
in a deep neural network architecture, was pre-
sented by Hardmeier (2014, Chapters 7–9), who
observed significant improvements on TED talks
and News Commentaries. Alternatively, to avoid
extracting features from an anaphora resolution
system, Callin et al. (2015) developed a classifier
based on a feed-forward neural network, which
considered mainly the preceding nouns, determin-
ers and their part-of-speech as features. Their pre-
dictor worked particularly well on ce and ils pro-
nouns, and had a macro F-score of 55.3% on the
DiscoMT 2015 pronoun prediction task. Tiede-
mann (2015) built a cross-sentence n-gram lan-
guage model over determiners and pronouns to
bias the SMT model towards selecting correct pro-
nouns. The goal of our paper, in the framework of
pronoun-focused translation, is to test whether a
target-side language model of nouns and pronouns
can improve over a purely n-gram-based one.

3 Overview of the Method

The proposed method to predict target pronouns at
the WMT 2016 task, for English-to-French, con-
sists of two principal stages:

• We first apply several heuristics to determine
if the predicted pronoun belongs to the ad-
hoc cases (e.g. ‘on’, ‘other’) (see Section 5)
and then predict its translation, as the PLM is
not able to address them.

• If the anaphor is detected as not one of these
above-mentioned cases, then we employ the
PLM to score all possible candidates and se-
lect the one with the highest score (see Sec-
tion 4).

In the next two sections, we discuss first in
detail the construction of our pronoun language
model, which has the strongest theoretical founda-
tions, and then present the grammatical heuristics.

4 Pronoun Language Model

4.1 Overview of the PLM

The key intuition behind the idea of a Pronoun
Language Model is that additional, probabilistic
constrains on target pronouns can be obtained by
examining the gender and number of the nouns
preceding them, without any attempt to perform
anaphora resolution, which is error-prone. For in-
stance, considering the EN/FR translation diver-
gency “it → il/elle/. . .”, the higher the number of
French masculine nouns preceding the pronoun,
the higher the probability that the correct transla-
tion is il (masculine).

To this end, we first estimate from parallel data
the probabilistic connection between the target-
side distribution of gender and number features
among the nouns preceding a pronoun and the ac-
tual translation of this pronoun into French (fo-
cusing on translations of it and they which ex-
hibit strong EN/FR divergencies). Then, we use
the above information to score all possible target
candidates of each source pronoun it and they and
select the one with highest score.

The above method is implemented as a
pronoun-aware language model (PLM), which is
trained as explained in the next subsection, and is
then used for selecting pronoun candidate as ex-
plained in Section 6.

4.2 Learning the PLM

The data used for training the PLM is the target
side (French) of the WIT3 parallel corpus (Cettolo
et al., 2012) distributed by the IWSLT workshops.
This corpus is made of transcripts of TED talks,
i.e. lectures that typically last 18 minutes, on var-
ious topics from science and the humanities with
high relevance to society. The TED talks are given
in English, then transcribed and translated by vol-
unteers and TED editors. The French side con-
tains 179,404 sentences, with a total of 3,880,369
words.

We process the data sequentially, word by word,
from the beginning to the end. We keep track
of the gender and number of the N most recent
nouns and pronouns in a list, which is initialized
as empty and is then updated when a new noun
or pronoun is encountered. In these experiments,
we set N = 5, i.e. we will examine up to four
nouns or pronouns before a pronoun. This value is
based on the intuition that the antecedent seldom
occurs too far before the anaphor. To obtain the
morphological tag of each word, specifically the
gender and number of every noun and pronoun,
we employ a French part-of-speech (POS) tagger,
Morfette (Chrupala et al., 2008).

When a French pronoun is encountered, the se-
quence formed by the gender/number features of
the N previous nouns or pronouns, acquired from
the above list, and the pronoun itself is appended
to a data file which will be used to train the PLM.
If the lexical item can have multiple lexical func-
tions, including pronoun – e.g. le or la can be ob-
ject pronouns or determiners – then their POS as-
signed by Morfette is used to filter out the non-
pronoun occurrences. We only process the French
pronouns that are potential translations of the En-
glish it and they, namely the following list: il, ils,
elle, elles, le, la, lui, l’, on, ce, ça, c’, ç, ceci,
celà, celui, celui-ci, celui-là, celle, celle-ci, celle-
là, ceux, ceux-ci, ceux-là, celles, celles-ci, celles-
là.

In the next step, we apply the SRILM language
modeling toolkit (Stolcke, 2002), with modified
Kneser-Ney smoothing, to build a 5-gram lan-
guage model over the training dataset collected
above, which includes 179,058 of the aforemen-
tioned sequences. The sequences are given to
SRILM as separate “sentences”, i.e. two consec-
utive sequences are never joined and are consid-
ered independently of each other. The pronouns

are always ending a sequence in the training data,
but not necessarily in the n-grams generated by
SRILM, as exemplified in Figure 1: the exam-
ples include n-grams that do not end with a pro-
noun, e.g. the fifth and the sixth ones. These will
be needed for back-off search and are kept in the
model used below.

their log-probabilities, learned by SRILM.

4.3 Empirical Validation of the PLM

To test the intuition that a larger number of nouns
and pronouns of a given gender and number in-
creases the probability of a translation of it with
the same gender and number, we examine in this
section some parameters of the learned PLM. For
instance, in Figure 2(a), first four bars, we rep-
resent how the log-probability of French mascu-
line singular il varies with the number of mascu-
line singular nouns or pronouns preceding it. We
compute the average log-probability over all PLM
n-grams containing exactly n time(s) (n from 1 to
4 for the bars from left to right) a masculine singu-
lar noun and finishing with il. The same operation
can be done for other pronouns, such as ce, ils, elle
or elles, as represented in the subsequent groups
of bars in Figure 2(a), which all show the evo-
lution of the probability to observe the respective
pronoun after 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 masculine singular
nouns (bars from left to right for each pronoun).
The log-probability increases for il with the num-
ber of masculine singular (pro)nouns preceding it,
and decreases for all the other pronouns, except
for the neutral ce, for which it remains constant. A
similar result in Figure 2(b) shows that the proba-
bility to observe elle after 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 feminine
singular nouns increases with this number. Such
results bring support to the idea of the PLM.

Similar observations can be made for the log-
probability to observe one of the five pronouns
listed above after 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 feminine sin-
gular nouns, as shown in Figure 2(b). Again, our
proposal is supported by the fact that this proba-
bility increases for elle and decreases for all other
pronouns.

Figure 2: Log-probabilities to observe a given pronoun depending on the number of (pro)nouns of a
given gender/number preceding it, either masculine singular in (a) or feminine singular in (b). In (a),
the probability of il increases with the number of masculine singular (pro)nouns preceding it (four bars
under il, 1 to 4 (pro)nouns from left to right), while the probabilities of all other pronouns decrease with
this number. A similar result for elle with respect to the other pronouns is observed in (b), depending on
the number of feminine singular (pro)nouns preceding elle.

Moreover, the log-probabilities for four com-
binations of features ({masculine, feminine} ×
{singular, plural}) and the twelve most frequent
French pronouns which are translations of it and
they are given in (Luong and Popescu-Belis,
2016). These results suggest that, for most third-
person pronouns (il, elle, ils, elles, le, la) the av-
erage log-probability of the pronoun gradually in-
creases when more and more nouns (or pronouns)
of the same gender and number are found before
it. By contrast, the log-probability decreases with
the presence of more words of a different gender
and number. However, such tendencies are not
observed for the neuter indefinite pronoun on, the
vowel-preceding object pronoun l’, or the indirect
object pronoun lui.

Another important observation, which holds for
all four possible combinations of gender and num-
ber values, is that the log-probability of the n-
gram containing four nouns of the same gender
and number as the pronoun (e.g. four masculine
singular nouns followed by il) is always higher
than those containing a different pronoun. More-
over, among the remaining pronouns, the PLM pri-
oritizes the neuter ones (e.g. ce, c’ , or ca) over
those of the opposite gender or number, which is
beneficial for pronoun selection by re-ranking hy-
potheses from an SMT decoder.

5 Grammar-Based Heuristics

Among the eight classes to predict (il, elle, ils,
elles, ce, cela, on, other), the two classes on and

other exhibit strong independence from the gender
and number of the previous nouns and pronouns,
hence they are unable to benefit from the PLM as
much as the remaining ones. To detect their pres-
ence in the target sentence, we apply specific rules,
based on their grammar constraints with the neigh-
boring words.

5.1 Rule for Predicting on

In French, the pronoun on can be used in both per-
sonal and impersonal modes. The latter usage of-
ten occurs when translating an English sentence in
passive voice, like in the following examples:

• They were told to . . .→ On leur a dit de . . .

• They are asked to . . .→ On leur demande de
. . .

Nevertheless, in such cases, the French passive
voice can just as well be used, respectively as: “Il
leur a été dit de . . .” and “Il leur est demandé
de . . .”, depending on the writing style, the lat-
ter variant being more formal. Our way to predict
the presence of on in the target text is to exam-
ine the target word which follows the pronoun and
which should not be the verb être (in English to
be) in its lemmatized form. In fact, the pronoun
on, if predicted, is not actually the translation of
the source pronoun they, but has an impersonal
function. However, in many cases of the task’s
training data, the placeholder appears before the
actual translation, e.g. “PLACE HOLDER leur a

592



dit...”, therefore on is an appropriate candidate to
consider. Algorithmically, the rule is formulated
as follows:

if source = They + {are, were, ’re, have been, ’ve been} +
V erb (Past Participle) then

if target = Pronoun + V erb (not être) then
Pronoun == “on”

end if
end if

In cases where the pronoun is not on, then it will
be handled by the PLM.

5.2 Predicting Untranslated Pronouns
In English-French translation, the source pronoun
might remain untranslated for instance to simplify
the sentence or to avoid repeating a pronoun which
was previously mentioned. For instance:

• Source: But it takes time , it takes money .

• Target: Mais ça prend du temps et de l’ ar-
gent.

Although the PLM cannot address these usages,
we attempt to predict the placeholder using the
word following it. Specifically, if we encounter
a noun, an adjective, a punctuation, a conjunction,
a preposition or an adverb as the subsequent word
of the placeholder, then it is very likely that the
pronoun was skipped and the placeholder should
be filled with an untranslated word, i.e. the other
class.

6 Experimental Setting

We employ the TEDdev dataset from the 2015
shared task (Hardmeier et al., 2015), containing
1,664 sentences with reference translations, 563 it
and they instances, as the development set to in-
vestigate the usefulness of the proposed PLM and
rules. Firstly, the PLM is used independently for
the prediction, and then it is incorporated with the
grammar rules for detecting on and other classes.

Unlike the development set, the test set of the
2016 task (with 1,213 sentence pairs and 373 in-
stances of it and they) comes in a lemmatized rep-
resentation, which prevents participants from ex-
tracting explicitly the number of the target nouns
and pronouns, though their gender is available.
Hence, we only make use of the gender of the
target word and the number of the source word
aligned to it, using the alignment information pro-
vided.

7 Results and Analysis

The per-class micro-averaged Precision, Recall
and F-score of two systems – the PLM alone and
PLM+rules – are displayed in Table1: on the left-
hand side for the development set and on the right-
hand side for the test set.

The results on the development set demonstrate
that while the PLM performs quite poorly when
used alone, it is clearly improved by adding gram-
mar rules, especially for ils (F = 81.37%), ce (F
= 82.46%), and other (F = 55.17%). Hence, we
selected PLM+rules as our primary submission,
and kept PLM as the contrastive one.

The performance of our primary (PLM+rules)
and contrastive (PLM) submissions, as well as the
Baseline system for this sub-task on the test data
are shown on the right side of Table 1. For the sake
of completeness, we also report the official score
used to rank systems, the macro-averaged Recall,
on these systems in Table 2. Again, both systems
perform best for ils and ce, in comparison to the
remaining ones. In addition, making use of the
rule for other class allows to boost significantly
the prediction capability for this class, from zero
to 57.60 F-score. Likewise, the rule for detecting
on plays a positive role on the test data, although it
brings a smaller improvement than that on the de-
velopment data. Conversely, none of the two sys-
tems can output feminine plural subject pronoun
elles, which is due to the fact that the score for
elles is lower than that of ils on almost all gender-
number combinations in our PLM.

Despite promising scores over certain classes,
the macro-averaged recall scores (considered as
the official criterion for performance assessment
in the 2016 shared task) of our primary and con-
trastive submissions do not outperform the two
baselines (36.36% and 30.44% respectively for
our systems, vs. 50.85% and 46.98% for the
two baselines). Furthermore, these results are
markedly poorer than that of the first-ranked sys-
tem (65.70%), suggesting that the target-side PLM
and grammar rules, although useful, are shallow
and inadequate when being used as the sole knowl-
edge base for pronoun prediction. These results
emphasize the necessity of using the source text,
which is likely to contain essential features for
predicting the translations of pronouns, and avoid
relying on the target-side only, following a post-
editing approach.

8 Conclusion and Perspectives

This paper addressed the English-French pronoun
prediction task by using a Pronoun Language
Model (PLM) complemented with some grammar
heuristics. The PLM encodes the likelihood of
each target pronoun given the sequence of gen-
der/number values of preceding nouns and pro-
nouns. Here, the PLM was employed to rank
all possible candidate French pronouns. In two
specific cases, namely for the passive or imper-
sonal on and the elliptic target pronouns, the deci-
sions were made by several specific heuristics. Al-

though our system outperforms the baseline sys-
tem on the development data, it shows a rather
poor performance compared with other submis-
sions on the test data. The presence of numerous
cases where the preceding (pro)nouns are strongly
divergent, and the complex usages of on and other
classes in the test set, are likely the main rea-
sons that make our approach unable to discrimi-
nate them, when used independently from decoder
and source-side co-reference features.

In future work, we will integrate the PLM in
the log-linear model of the decoder as a fea-
ture function. Besides, we will take into con-
sideration the positional factor by putting more
weight on the nouns and pronouns that are closer
to the examined one, in comparison to more dis-
tant ones, when they share the same gender-
number. Furthermore, we will also attempt to
study and exploit linguistic characteristics to dis-
tinguish among neuter French pronouns.
