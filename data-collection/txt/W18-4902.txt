Universal Dependencies (UD; Nivre et al. 2016) has recently become a de facto standard as a de-
pendency representation used in Natural Language Processing (NLP). As perhaps most of syntactic
processing in NLP involves dependency structures, it is safe to say that it is becoming a standard for
syntactic processing at large. There are 122 treebanks for 71 languages in the July 2018 release 2.2 of
UD, publicly available at http://universaldependencies.org/. New UD treebanks are often
the result of converting corpora adhering to other annotation schemes – not only dependency-based, but
also constituency-based.

Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG; Bresnan 1982, Dalrymple 2001, Bresnan et al. 2015) is a lin-
guistic theory which assumes two syntactic levels of representation (in addition to other, non-syntactic
levels): constituency structure (c-structure) and functional structure (f-structure). In the case of the Polish
sentence (1), in which two asyndetically coordinated verbs within a clausal subject share a number of
dependents, the c-structure is given in (2) and the f-structure – in (3):1

‘It seemed that, after all, the war overwhelmed and scared him.’

The first aim of this paper is to describe a procedure of converting such LFG structures to depend-
ency representations following the UD standard, specifically, its enhanced version 2. Conversion of LFG
structures to dependency structures is not a new task, but – with the exception of Meurer 2017 – previous
attempts are only mentioned or very roughly outlined in the literature. Moreover, previous work has been
limited to dependency trees as the output format. As is well known, simple dependency trees cannot
straightforwardly represent many kinds of linguistic information, so the conversion from representations
such as those assumed in LFG invariably resulted in considerable loss of information.

The current version 2 of Universal Dependencies assumes, apart from basic dependency trees, also
enhanced dependency structures, which make it possible to represent phenomena beyond the scope of
simple trees. For example, the result of converting the LFG structures (2)–(3) to UD is shown in (4) (with
the basic tree displayed above the text and the enhanced structure – below the text, with the differences
shown in red). The second aim of this paper is to examine to what extent rich information available in
LFG structures is or may in principle be preserved in such enhanced UD representations.

The empirical basis for the conversion is a manually disambiguated LFG parsebank of Polish (Patejuk
and Przepiórkowski 2014) consisting of over 17,000 sentences (almost 131,000 tokens). Since this is
a parsebank, it only contains analyses successfully provided by the LFG parser of Polish (Patejuk and
Przepiórkowski 2012b, 2015) and selected by human annotators as correct. While this constrains the
number and kinds of constructions present in the corpus, the underlying LFG grammar of Polish is
currently one of the largest implemented LFG grammars, and it includes a comprehensive analysis of
various kinds of coordination and its interaction with other phenomena (Patejuk and Przepiórkowski
2012a), so there is no shortage of sentences which pose potential difficulties for the conversion.

1RM in (1) stands for ‘reflexive marker’, which in this case is an inherent part of the verb wydawało się ‘seemed’; other
abbreviations are standard. LFG structures shown in (2)–(3) are visualisations produced by the INESS system (http://
clarino.uib.no/iness/; Rosén et al. 2012), which hosts the Polish LFG structure bank, among other treebanks.
