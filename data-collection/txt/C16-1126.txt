Abstract

Several recent studies have shown that eye movements during reading provide information about
grammatical and syntactic processing, which can assist the induction of NLP models. All these
studies have been limited to English, however. This study shows that gaze and part of speech
(PoS) correlations largely transfer across English and French. This means that we can replicate
previous studies on gaze-based PoS tagging for French, but also that we can use English gaze
data to assist the induction of French NLP models.

1 Introduction

The eye movements during normal, skilled reading are known to reflect the processing load associ-
ated with reading. Recently, eye movement data has been integrated into natural language processing
models for weakly supervised part-of-speech (PoS) induction (Barrett et al., 2016), sentence compres-
sion (Klerke et al., 2016), supervised PoS tagging (Barrett and Søgaard, 2015a), and supervised pars-
ing (Barrett and Søgaard, 2015b).

Barrett et al. (2016) used eye movements from the English portion of a large eye tracking corpus,
the Dundee corpus (Kennedy et al., 2003), for weakly supervised PoS induction for English, obtain-
ing significant improvements over a baseline without gaze features. They used a second-order hidden
Markov Model, which was type-constrained by Wiktionary dictionaries for their experiments. These re-
sults suggest an approach to weakly supervised PoS induction using only a dictionary and eye movement
data. Such an approach would be applicable for low-resource languages, for which it is difficult to find
professional annotators.

The present study further explores to which
extent native readers’ processing of PoS gener-
alizes across related languages. We use a sim-
ilar model as Barrett et al. (2016), but perform
cross-lingual experiments with both the French
and the English portion of the Dundee Corpus.

Contribution This is to the best of our
knowledge the first study to explore how the
eye movements of native readers that inform
PoS models generalize from one language to
another. We also introduce a new resource
for studying the relation between grammatical
class and eye movements in French: we provide
PoS annotation for most of the French Dundee
Corpus by aligning it with the morphosyntactic
annotation of the French Treebank (Abeillé et
al., 2003).

2 Data preparation

The data used for this experiment is the English and French portions of the Dundee Corpus (Kennedy et
al., 2003). The Dundee Corpus is the largest available eye movement corpus by token count. For English
and French, 10 native speakers of each language read 20 newspaper articles from either The Independent
(English) or Le Monde (French). The corpus comprises around 50,000 tokens per language.

For both the English and the French part of the Dundee Corpus, the original tokenization follows the
visual units of the text, and contractions and punctuation are attached to the word whose visual unit
they belong to. For instance, s’entendre or rappelle-t-il are one token in the French Dundee Corpus but
two and five, respectively, in the French Treebank. In the English Dundee Corpus, don’t! is one token,
but three in the Dundee Treebank. As a result, eye movement measures are only available for the entire
visual unit. We address this issue by duplicating the eye movement measures for all treebank tokens that
comprise a Dundee token (i.e., a visual unit). This is the same approach Barrett et al. (2016) used. As
a result, the number of tokens increases in the PoS-tagged version of the Dundee Corpus; also, some
tokens are associated with eye movement measures that reflect the processing of several tokens.

For English, the treebank tokenization leads to 13.8% increase of tokens to 58,599 tokens. For French,
the treebank tokenization leads to an 17.7% increase on token count to 56,683 tokens. For the English
training set, 76% of all Dundee Corpus tokens are mapped to one treebank token. The same goes for 62%
of the Dundee Corpus tokens for French.

2.1 English
The Dundee Treebank (Barrett et al., 2015) is a recent manual, syntactic annotation layer for the English
portion of the Dundee Corpus following the Universal Dependency formalism. For evaluation, we use
the PoS labels from this resource. We mapped the Penn Treebank tagset used in the Dundee Treebank

1331



automatically to the Universal PoS tag set (Petrov et al., 2011).
The split into training, development, and test set for the English Dundee corpus is identical to the splits

used by Barrett et al. (2016), with 80% of the tokens for training and 10% of the tokens for development
and testing, respectively, without splitting up sentences. This split results in 46,879 tokens in 1,896
sentences for training, 5,868 tokens in 230 sentences for development, and a test set of 5,832 tokens in
241 sentences.

2.2 French

The text for the French part of the Dundee Corpus is originally from the French Treebank version
1.4 (Abeillé et al., 2003) and we re-aligned the two corpora for this experiment. We first manually iden-
tified the relevant subset of the French Treebank (which is discontinuous). A small part (2,518 tokens
equivalent of 5.31% of the French Dundee tokens) of the Dundee Corpus could not be found by manual
search in the French Treebank and was therefore omitted from the experiment. Only entire sentences
were removed. The morphosyntactic annotation of the French Treebank was semi-manually aligned with
the Dundee Corpus by a set of heuristic rules and by manually fixing all exceptions. Due to tokenization
inconsistencies in both the French Treebank and the Dundee Corpus, manual intervention was required.

For French there are some treebank tokens with no token string, only PoS, lemma etc. For example,
du should be split into de and le, but in some instances the token string for le is missing. These missing
tokens were omitted from this experiment.

The French Dundee Corpus does not come with a training-development-test split. We use a similar
approach as for English, with the first 80% of the tokens for training, the next 10% of the tokens for
development and the last 10% for testing. No sentences were split into separate sets. That results in
43,383 tokens in 1,585 sentences for training, 5,407 tokens in 240 sentences for development, and 5,444
tokens in 178 sentences for testing.

The tagset of the French Treebank was automatically mapped to the Universal PoS tag set (Petrov et
al., 2011). We make the aligned, morphosyntactic annotation for the French Dundee Corpus available at
https://bitbucket.org/lowlands/release.

2.3 Reading differences between English and French

This section discusses the results of existing studies comparing reading in French and English. The two
main studies used the two Dundee corpora for their analysis.

Pynte and Kennedy (2006) compared the eye movements of the French and English Dundee corpus
to explore local effects (e.g., word frequency, word length, local context) and global effects (e.g., pre-
dictability, reading strategy, inspection strategy) on five eye movement metrics.

They first of all noted that French was read slower than English with more and longer fixations.
This effect is significant and is even more pronounced for long words and there are also significantly
more re-fixations for French compared to English. Kennedy and Pynte (2005) argue that re-fixations
reflect the most crucial difference between French and English. Besides being an obvious difference in
the processing of the target word, more re-fixations also enhance preview of the next word. Pynte and
Kennedy (2006) report that participants of the English and French experiments were matched (though
not on which factors) and that the procedure, including calibration technique, equipment, control soft-
ware, instructions, and data-reduction software, were identical across language, though the French data
was collected in Aix-en-Provence, France and the English data in Dundee, UK. Therefore they ascribed
this difference to the text itself. Even though they found that French words (5.2 characters) are on aver-
age longer than English ones (4.7 characters), there are more two-letter words in French (19.7%) than
in English (17.2%). Therefore Kennedy and Pynte (2005) suggest that the reading difference is due the
distribution of information across the letters of a given words, which is different across these two lan-
guages. For example, in French, terminal accents, case markers, and gender and tense marking convey
crucial morphological information. This is in line with their finding that eye movements in the English
part of the Dundee Corpus were more sensitive to the length of the next word, whereas French showed
equivalent effects of the informativeness of the word-initial trigram.

Overall, Pynte and Kennedy (2005; 2006) conclude that the English and French inspection strategies
are remarkably similar, which is the same conclusion Sparrow et al. (2003) made when testing the English
EZ reader model on another eye movement corpus of 134 words of French. Kennedy and Pynte (2005)
provide an analysis of the statistical differences between English and French, but besides re-fixations
being more frequent in French, they seem to conclude that the reading is in many respects similar, which
is also supported by their choice of mainly analyzing French and English jointly.

The treebank annotation includes sentence boundaries, which makes it possible to compare the length
and the complexity of the sentences for both languages. We find that the average sentence length of the
English training set is 24.7 tokens (SD 13.1). For French it is 28.7 tokens (SD 17.8). Sentence length
was not considered by Pynte and Kennedy (2005; 2006). A consequence of longer sentences is that
reading difficulty increases. The Coleman-Liau index (Coleman and Liau, 1975) is 10.38 for the English
training set and 12.98 for the French.1 This could stem from different writing styles in Le Monde and
The Independent or a biased sampling of articles.

The conclusion can go no further than to say that French and English readers can display a more or
less similar inspection strategy when reading text under matched conditions. Some effects, e.g., the fact

that word-initial trigrams are more important for fixation durations in French than in English, could be
due to cross-lingual differences in the spelling of the two languages, leading to re-fixations in order to
increase preview. But slower reading could also be partly due to the presence of more difficult texts in
the French corpus. See Section 7 for a further discussion on grammatical processing differences across
languages.

2.3.1 Comparing reading of PoS for English and French
The statistics presented in the following section were computed on the French and English training sets
and extends the comparison of Section 2.3 with respect to PoS. We show that the PoS classes are overall
read similarly across the two languages with few exceptions due to systematic biases.

Figure 1 shows the distribution of PoS classes in the English and French data. The biggest differences
are that there are no NUM tags in French. This is due to the annotation scheme and our automatic
mapping, in which no tags map to NUM. There are also very few particles in the French data compared
to English.

Figure 2 shows boxplots for two different reading metrics: number of fixations and first pass duration,
across PoS class for English and French. The first pass duration is the sum of fixation durations for a
token in the first pass through the text. This measure is said to encompass early syntactic and lexical
processing. The number of fixations encompasses re-fixations and regressions to a token and reflects
later syntactic and semantic processing.

Note that punctuation is almost always glued to a word and any eye movements on a punctuation will
mainly—if not solely—reflect the processing of the other token. Therefore punctuation is excluded from
Figure 2.

When comparing Figure 2d and 2b, we can confirm Pynte and Kennedy’s (2006) finding that fixations

1334



are generally longer in the French portion than in the English portion of Dundee. Average gaze duration
in the training set is 236 ms for English and 303 ms for French.

It can be seen from Figure 2 that the measures differ across PoS for most classes in an intuitive way.
For instance, PoS classes of short, frequent, closed-class words such as CONJ, ADP, PRON and DET get
fewer and shorter fixations than, e.g., NOUN, VERB, ADJ, and ADV. This seems to be consistent across
the two languages, and is in line with a similar analysis for English (Barrett and Søgaard, 2015a) for a
smaller data set of naturally occurring text from five different domains.

The PRT category seems to be an exception. In French, PRT seems to require extensive early and late
processing. Remember from Figure 1 that there are more PRTs for English (3.6%) and fewer for French
(0.05%). The sets of PRT words for the two languages reveal a systematic bias in the annotation scheme
or automatic mapping. For the French training set, the set of PRTs is {vice-, pseudo-, post-, contre-, anti-,
non-, quasi-, soviéto-, supra-, néo-, inter-}. For English it is {off, down, To, about, on, in, over, around,
back, up, out, to, away, ’, ’s}. French particles are therefore always at least two-token visual units that
seem to be quite infrequent as well as long, whereas English particles are short and frequent.

3 Features

For our weakly supervised PoS tagging experiments, we use 22 gaze features that measure both early
processing and late processing. They are equivalent to the 22 gaze features used by Barrett et al. (2016).
Early processing measures are said to reflect different aspects of early syntactic and semantic processing
and include first pass duration and first fixation duration. Late processing measures reflect, e.g., late
syntactic and semantic integration (Rayner, 1998). Examples are number and duration of regressions
going to a word, as well as the total reading time for a word.

Non-gaze features are usually included in eye movement models, because they explain a lot of the
variance in fixation durations. Word frequency and word length together have been found to explain 69%
of the variance in the mean gaze duration (Carpenter and Just, 1983). Like Barrett et al. (2016), we use
word length, log word frequencies from a big corpus and log word frequencies from the Dundee training
set for the target word, and the previous and next words. From the Dundee training set, we also extract
the forward and backward transitional probability, i.e., the conditional probabilities for a word given the
next or previous word. Our non-gaze features are almost equivalent to Barrett et al. (2016). The only
difference is that they also used forward and backward transitional probabilities from a big corpus.

The big corpus log frequencies were obtained from the British National Corpus2 for English, extracted
with KenLM (Heafield, 2011) and Lexique3 for French. The Dundee log frequencies were calculated on
the respective training sets using CMU Language Modeling Toolkit4 with Witten-Bell smooting.

In total we have 29 features. All features are first averaged over all 10 readers of the corpus, then scaled
to a value between 0 and 1 by minmax scaling. The best model of the feature ablation study of Barrett et
al. (2016) used all features, which suggests that grammatical processing of a broad set of PoS categories
is reflected across many features and need non-gaze features as well.

4 Experiment

We replicate the experimental setup of Barrett et al. (2016), which used the best model from Li et
al. (2012), a second-order hidden Markov model with maximum entropy emissions (SHMM-ME) con-
strained by Wiktionary tags such that emissions are confined to the allowed PoS tags of the Wiktionary
given that the token exists in the Wiktionary. Li et al. (2012) report considerable improvements from the
Wiktionary contraint when comparing to unsupervised methods.

The second-order model includes transition probabilities from the antecedent state like a first order
model (Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2010) as well as from the second-order antecedent state.

We use the original implementation of Li et al. and we also include a subset of their word-level features,
viz., four features detecting hyphens, numerals, punctuation and capitalization. We leave out the three

4http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/SLM/toolkit.html

1335



suffix features from Li et al.’s basic feature model, as these features do not transfer across languages.
These features were also included by Barrett et al. (2016).

We use the English Wiktionary dumps made available by Li et al.5 The French Wiktionary dump is
from Wisniewski et al. (2014) and does not include any punctuation. We therefore augment it with all
punctuation entries from the English Wiktionary. Furthermore, tokens for the tag ADP are completely
missing from the French Wiktionary, and the tokens for the class DET were sparse. We therefore add all
examples of DET and ADP from the French training set to the French Wiktionary.

For the cross-lingual experiments, we use the union of the French and the English Wiktionary dictio-
naries.

Barrett et al. (2016) used Li et al.’s model for weakly supervising PoS induction with gaze features for
English, and performed model tuning and feature ablation. We use their best hyper-parameter setting, i.e.,
five EM iterations, as well as the best feature combination: all features. Following Barrett et al. (2016),
we try token-level and type-level features. For the token-level experiments, each token is represented by
its feature vector. For the type-level experiments, each token is represented by an average of the feature
vectors for all occurrences of the lower-cased word type of the training set.

French and English train set gaze vectors across gaze
features. Sorted by similarity.

The tagging accuracy for all combinations of
training and testing language on the develop-
ment set and the test set can be seen in Table 1.

For all conditions, type-level features work
better than token-level, though the type-level im-
provement over the baseline is not significant for
FR-EN.

The English monolingual condition plus suf-
fix is almost equivalent to the best model in
Barrett et al. (2016). The only difference is the
two missing non-gaze features described in Sec-
tion 3. On the test set, they report a baseline ac-
curacy of 79.77, a token-level accuracy of 81.00,
and a type-level accuracy of 82.44, which is
in line with our results. We observe that the
suffix features seem to help in the monolin-
gual conditions. For monolingual conditions, we
confirm that type-level gaze-features and token-
level ones outperform the baseline. These dif-
ferences are significant, except for the EN-EN
token-level plus suffix condition.

FR-FR PoS tagging seems to be a slightly an
easier task than EN-EN PoS tagging, achieving
overall higher accuracies.

The cross-lingual conditions generally
achieve lower performance than the monolin-
gual. When training on English and testing
on French, both token-level and type-level
conditions are significantly better than baseline.

6 Error Analysis

There are—as expected—more errors when using cross-lingual gaze data. This section will explore these
errors by comparing the predictions of the cross-lingual experiments with the predictions of the mono-

1336



lingual experiments. All analysis is on the development set output of the type-level models. We compare
them to the output of the type-level monolingual models.

Figure 3 shows accuracy scores per PoS class comparing experiments with same test set. The accuracy
of punctuations is due to the basic feature model and the Wiktionary constraints—not the eye movement
measures. PRT and NUM are real challenges for FR-EN compared to EN-EN. This can be assumed to
be due to the different use of the PRT tag and the missing NUM class in the French dataset described in
Section 2.3.1. ADJ also seems like a cross-lingual challenge, though harder when trained on English and
tested on French than the other way around.

Figure 4 shows the erroneous predictions per gold PoS tag, allowing us to compare error types across
experiments. When comparing Figure 4a and Figure 4c, both evaluated on English, most classes seem to
have almost the same set of misclassified labels though for some labels in different magnitude or ratio
depending on whether they are trained on English or French. The main differences are: when trained on
French, ADP and ADJ are generally more often misclassified, ADP is not mainly misclassified as CONJ,
but more often as ADV, DET is also misclassified as VERB and ADV, PRT is misclassified as ADV and
not mainly as ADP.

When comparing Figure 4b and Figure 4d, both evaluating on French, we also find that for many of the
PoS classes, the misclassifications are of the same type, though different in magnitude or ratio. The main
differences we observe when training on English are: ADJ is mainly misclassified as NOUN instead of
ADP, ADV, DET, NOUN, and PRT; ADV is misclassified as VERB; DET is never misclassified as PRT,
but more often as NOUN and ADJ; and NOUN is rarely misclassified as PRT. The last error probably
has to do with the long gaze durations for PRT in the French data (resembling gaze durations of NOUNs)
opposed to the short gaze durations of English PRT.

Table 2 shows the cosine similarity between
the English and French PoS-averaged gaze vec-
tors from the train set for all gaze features. This
gives information about which gaze feature av-
erages differ between French and English PoS.
Pynte and Kennedy (2006) found that French
had more re-fixations than English, which is re-
flected in the table. Measures correlating with
re-fixations like re-read probability, number of
fixtions, and total fixation duration are naturally
also different across languages. First pass dura-
tion is not directly correlated with number of re-
fixations, and must be considered an distinct pat-
tern.

6.1 Wiktionary agreement

Figure 5 shows the word types for the En-
glish and French development set according to
their representation in the respective monolin-
gual Wiktionary. This figure is inspired by Li
et al. (2012). For English, more PoS types agree with the Wiktionary (Same or SubsetOfWik) than for
French. We also computed token-level accuracies, where a tag licensed by Wiktionary counts as correct.
For the French development set, this maximum dictionary accuracy is 0.95, whereas for English it is
0.92.

7 Discussion

We presented four experiments with PoS induction using gaze data in a monolingual and cross-lingual
setup with a second-order hidden Markov model. Our experiments confirm the main conclusion from
Barrett et al. (2016), viz., that type-level gaze vectors improve PoS induction. We replicated their result

for English and report the same finding for French as well as for French when trained on English gaze
vectors.

It is difficult to determine how much the relatedness of the French and English languages is responsible
for the ability of the model to generalize cross-lingually. The psycholinguistic literature does not reveal
how different PoS categories are processed across languages; most experimental work in the literature
studies single phenomena in one language. For instance, in reaction time studies of lexical decision tasks
it has been found that the processing of English plural and singular nouns is influenced by surface fre-
quency only6 (Sereno and Jongman, 1997), whereas for Dutch (Baayen et al., 1997) and French (New et
al., 2004), the lexical processing of singular and plural nouns is influenced by the base frequency7. The
English data thus support a full-storage cognitive model, whereas the French and the Dutch data sup-
port the Parallel Dual-Route model where a word is processed as segments in parallel with whole word
processing. These results suggest that nouns are processed differently in the brain for native speakers of
different languages. This means that our results may not generalize to other combinations of languages
and in the specific case of nouns it suggests that Dutch and French nouns are processed more similarly
than French and English.

8 Conclusion

This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first study to explore whether gaze features generalize from
one language to another for a broad set of syntactic categories. We used a type-constrained second-
order HMM for monolingual and cross-lingual PoS induction on the English and French portions of
the Dundee eye tracking corpus. We experimented with both token-level and type-level features and
confirmed that type-level gaze features improve monolingual PoS induction for both English and French.
We also showed that type-level gaze features significantly improve PoS induction for French, even when
the model is trained on English gaze vectors.
