Abstract

This contribution is about the annotation of sentences with verbal predicate
ellipsis in the Estonian Universal Dependencies (UD) treebank. The main aim of
the UD initiative is to develop a cross-linguistically consistent treebank annota-
tion scheme and build a multilingual treebank collection. There are more than
70 treebanks in over 100 languages in UD treebank collection version 2.2. How-
ever, the UD annotation scheme is constantly improved and amended and so the
annotation of the treebanks is also changing from version to version.

Our article studies a problematic issue in representing syntactic structure –
clauses with predicate verb ellipsis. UD syntactic annotation scheme is based on
dependency syntax and as the dependency structure is verb-centered, predicate
verb ellipsis causes more annotation problems than other types of ellipsis. We
focus on such constructions (referred to in English often as gapping and stripping)
in Estonian and their annotation in Estonian UD treebank versions 1 and 2.2.

Kokkuvõte

Artikkel käsitleb elliptilise öeldisega laustete märgendamist eesti keele Uni-
versal Dependencies’ (UD) puudepangas. UD eesmärgiks on esiteks töötada välja
puudepankade morfoloogilise ja sõltuvussüntaktilise märgendamise skeem, mis
oleks keelest sõltumatu selles mõttes, et sobiks kõigi keelte märgendamiseks, ja
teiseks luua selle märgendusskeemi järgi annoteeritud puudepankade kollekt-
sioon. UD versioon 2.2 sisaldab enam kui 100 puudepanka rohkem kui 70 keeles.
Märgendusskeemi arendatakse ja täiustatakse pidevalt ja seega tuleb UD kujul
olevaid puudepanku uute versioonide tarbeks pidevalt ümber märgendada.

UD süntaktiline märgendus põhineb sõltuvussüntaksi põhimõtetel, mille jär-
gi lause keskmeks on öeldis, tavaliselt finiitne verbivorm. Erandiks on koopula-
laused (eesti keele puhul olema-verbiga laused), mille kõrgeimaks ülemuseks on

mitte-verbiline predikaat. Kuna UD süntaksimärgendus on oma olemuselt ver-
bikeskne, põhjustab öeldise ellips lausepuu moodustamisel rohkem probleeme
kui mõne muu lausemoodustaja väljajätt. Tavaline on öeldisverbi väljajätt koor-
dinatsiooniseoses olevates identse öeldisverbiga osalausetes, kus öeldisverb on
olemas ainult esimeses osalauses ning järgnevates on tüüpiliselt kustutatud. Ar-
tiklis ongi vaatluse all sellised öeldisverbi ellipsiga laused eesti keele UD puu-
depangas: nende lausete tüpoloogia, automaatne tuvastamine ning automaatne
(ümber)märgendamine eesti keele UD puudepanga versiooni 2.2 jaoks.

1 Introduction
Universal Dependencies1 (henceworth: UD) (McDonald et al., 2013) is an initiative
aimed at developing cross-linguistically consistent treebank annotation for many lan-
guages. UD is an ongoing project, which means that the annotation guidelines and
treebank annotations are subject to constant changes. Its Version 2.2 includes more
than 100 treebanks in over than 70 languages.

Syntactic annotation in the UD framework represents dependency relations be-
tween tokens; the dependency arcs are labelled, i.e. they are typed dependencies.
Dependency description of a clause is verb-centered: the root of a dependency tree is
a finite verb form or, in copular sentences, a predicative word-form. So predicate verb
ellipsis poses more problems for building a dependency tree structure than ellipsis of
some argument or adjunct.

In Estonian, the most common cases of predicate verb ellipsis are gapping and
stripping constructions that appear in coordinated clauses. Gapping means that the
identical finite verb (together with the possible auxiliaries) is omitted in the second
coordinate clause. Extended gapping construction means that some other constituent
also has been elided togetherwith the predicate verb. By stripping everything is elided
from the coordinate clause except one constituent and often an additive or adversative
particle is added to the single remaining constituent.

The UD version 2.2 Annotation Guidelines2 suggest that the elliptical construc-
tions should be annotated as follows:

1. If the elided element has no overt dependents, there is no special annotation,
i.e. the elided element remains unnoticed.

2. If the elided element has overt dependents, one of these should be promoted to
take the role of the head.

3. If the elided element is a predicate and the promoted element is one of its
arguments or adjuncts, a special relation – orphan – should be used when attaching
other non-functional dependents to the promoted head.

As Schuster et al. (2017) point out, these guidelines ”put stripping in a gray zone” as
the additive/negative particle can be annotated using the relation ”orphan” or simply
as an adverbial modifier.

Ellipsis has been a relatively popular research topic in UD framework. Droganova
and Zeman (2017) provide an overview of annotating gapping and stripping construc-
tions (usage of label ”orphan”) in UD 2.0 treebanks. Schuster et al. (2017) analyse gap-
ping constructions in several languages and argue in favor of the annotation scheme
of these constructions proposed in UD v2.

As the main aim of UD initiative is to facilitate multi-lingual parsing, there have
already been a couple of papers that report on experiments on improving the parsing
of elliptical constructions, e.g. Droganova et al. (2018) or Schuster et al. (2018).

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives an overview of pred-
icate ellipsis types in Estonian and Section 3 briefly describes their annotation in Es-
tonian treebanks prior to Estonian UD v2.2. Method for detecting and re-annotating
elliptical constructions in Estonian UD v2.2 is introduced in Section 4 as well as the
main findings, i.e. types of predicate verb ellipsis in the treebank and their annotation.

2 Gapping, stripping and similar constructions in Esto-
nian

Estonian word-order is relatively free, meaning that it is mostly determined by in-
formation structure and the main principle determining the word order is V2 (verb-
second). However, there are also several clause types where the finite verb form is
placed in the very beginning or in the very end (Lindström, 2017).

Gapping is norm in coordinated V2 clauses where the predicate verb has at least
two dependents – the identical predicate verb is omitted in all other clauses except
the first one. (Erelt, 2017, pp 598–599) So there are typically at least two orphans in
an Estonian gapping clause, as in (1).

(1) Mari
Mari

sööb
eats

jäätist
ice-cream-Ptv

ja
and

Jüri
Jüri

0
0
kommi.
candy-Ptv

‘Mari is eating an ice-cream and Jüri a candy.’

An extended gapping construction is also quite common. If the clause starts with an
adverbial, subject is placed next to the verb and the subject and verb are identical in
coordinated clauses, the subject can be omitted together with the verb (2). (Erelt, 2017,
p 599)

(2) Suvel
Summer-Ade

sööb
eats

Mari
Mari

jäätist
ice-cream-Ptv

ja
and

talvel
winter-Ade

0
0
kommi.
candy-Ptv

‘Mari eats ice-cream during the summer and candy during the winter.’

Non-contiguous gaps are also present in Estonian: in sentence (3) the identical finite
verb form andis ‘gave’ and adverbial modifier kingituseks ‘as a gift’ are omitted in the
second coordinated clause.

(3) Ta
S/he

andis
gave

mulle
I-All

kingituseks
present-Trans

raamatu

ja
and

mina
I

0
0
talle
s/he-All

0
0
roosi.
rose-Ptv

‘S/he gave me a book as a gift and I him/her a rose.’

The stripping construction has two subtypes: coordinating (4) and adversative (5).
In both cases the elliptical clause contains only one argument plus a particle. Com-
mon additive particles in coordinating stripping constructions are ka ‘also’ and samuti
‘also’; in negative clauses ka mitte ‘also not’ and samuti mitte ‘also not’. In adversative
constructions particle mitte ‘not’ is used.(Erelt, 2017, pp 599–601)

‘Jüri is eating an ice-cream but Mari is not.’

Another construction that has been annotated as an example of ellipsis in Estonian
UD v 2.2 is the so-called seda-construction (seda is singular partitive case form of
pronoun see ‘it, this’), exemplified in (6).

There are two alternative ways to analyse this construction. One possibility is
to consider it a clause that has undergone two successive alternations: anaphoric
substitution and ellipsis. The other possibility is to interpret it as a result of one-
step anaphoric substitution. In both cases, the ”full” version of the sentence would
look like (7). In the first alternative case, there are two alternations taking place:
as the first step the whole first clause raba pakub kordumatuid elamusi ‘marsh offers
unique experiences’ is substitutedwith anaphoric expression teeb seda ‘does it’. As the
second step, the finite verb form teeb ‘does’ is deleted. So the output of the first step
– the anaphoric substitution would look like (8), which is a grammatical, well-formed
Estonian sentence, and the final, elliptical version like (6).

Another way to explain the seda-construction is to say that the whole first clause is
simply substituted with pronominal form seda, thus producing a verbless clause in
one step.

This construction has passed unnoticed by Estonian grammar books so far, so we
have no linguistic analyses to base our annotation principles on. We have decided
to adopt two-step explanation (anaphora followed by ellipsis) and we treat it as an
example of predicate verb ellipsis. However, this construction differs from gapping
and stripping as the deleted verb is not identical with the predicate verb in the previous
coordinate clause.

3 Previous treatment of ellipsis in Estonian treebanks
The Estonian UD treebank has been created by semi-automatically converting the
Estonian Dependency Treebank (EDT) (Muischnek et al., 2014) into UD format. The
EDT annotation scheme was based on Dependency Constraint Grammar (Karlsson
et al., 1995; Bick and Didriksen, 2015).

Annotations of Estonian UD treebank are produced by several semi-automatic
annotation conversions (from EDT to UD v1 and then from UD 1 to UD v2) and as
such contain errors and inconsistencies.

In the original EDT the elliptical constructions were annotated so that one of the
remaining arguments in the elliptical clause was promoted as the root of the clause
and dependents of the deleted verb-form were annotated as dependents of the pro-
moted argument, keeping their original syntactic labels. So the attachment of depen-
dents is in principle same as in UD v2, but no special label (orphan in UD v2) was
used to annotate the ”orphaned” dependents.

In contrast, UD v1 annotation scheme used a special relation remnant to attach
dependents of the elided verb to their correlates in the coordinated clause where the
verb is present. However, this annotation principle was not followed in Estonian UD
v1, mainly due to lack of (human) resources for re-annotation. Figure 1 depicts an-
notation of an elliptical sentence in Estonian UD v1 treebank. The example sentence
consists of three coordinated clauses, all sharing identical predicate verb õpib ‘studies’
that is omitted in the second and third clause. In the elliptical clauses the ”orphaned”
subjectsMaarit and Ilmar are annotated as the roots of the respective clauses and the
”orphaned” objects kirjandust ‘literature’ and ajalugu ‘history’ are, somewhat illogi-
cally, attached to the promoted subjects.

4 Detecting and re-annotating clauseswith predicate verb
ellipsis in Estonian UD v2.2 treebank

As elliptical constructions were not explicitly annotated in the previous versions of
the Estonian UD treebank, a special effort was needed to find and re-annotate them.
A rule-based program (Python3) was created to find and re-annotate clauses with
predicate verb ellipsis. The main principle is quite simple: the program looks for a
verb that has a conjunct which is not a verb. This conjunct has to have at least one
dependent that is not a punctuation mark or a coordinating conjunction. In order
to exclude copular clauses, the conjunct also should not have a dependent labelled
as copula. It means that the created piece of software works only with the locally
(mis)customized version of UD v1 annotation.

As already mentioned, according to the UD v2 annotation scheme, in an elliptical



60

clause one of the ”orphaned” dependents of the deleted verb is promoted as the head
of the clause and the other dependents of the deleted verb are attached to it using the
label orphan. However, in the enhanced version3 of UD syntactic annotation the label
orphan should be replaced with the label that the token would have as a dependent
of the elided (and restored as a null node) verb, which is the same label that the token
had in v1 of the Estonian UD treebank. In order to be able to restore the correct label
in the enhanced dependencies version, we have introduced special subtypes of the
label orphan, e.g orphan:obj, orphan:advmod etc.

The program achieved 95% precision and 73% recall on a test corpus consisting
of 1000 sentences. It means that 95% of the detected sentences were really elliptical
sentences and that 73% of the targeted sentences were actually found by the program.
For the re-annotation of orphans these figures were 81.8% and 94.4%, respectively. The
relatively low recall for elliptical sentence detection is mainly due to inconsistent and
erroneous annotations in the treebank.

There were 359 sentences containing predicate verb ellipsis in Estonian UD tree-
bank. Given that the treebank has a little more than 30,000 sentences, only ca 1.2% of
trees contain gapping or stripping or other similar constructions.

Table 1 gives an overview of predicate verb ellipsis types in v2.2 of Estonian UD
treebank as detected by the software. In the following subsections we analyse them
one by one.

cate ellipsis

4.1 Simple gapping constructions

Simple gapping construction is the most frequent type of predicate ellipsis in the Es-
tonian UD treebank, making up 42.1% of all elliptical clauses. Figures 2 and 3 depict a
typical case of gapping: the identical verb-form juhivad ‘(they) lead’ has been deleted
in the second coordinated clause, leaving an ”orphaned” object analüüsi ‘analysis in
partitive case form’. The annotation on Figure 2 is that of v1 of Estonian UD treebank.
On Figure 3 we can see the annotation that has been automatically converted into UD
v2.2 format.

4.2 Extended gapping constructions

Extended gapping constructions make up 6.4% of all elliptical clauses. In this case,
in addition to the predicate verb, also some of its dependents (subject, object, oblique
dependents etc) are deleted. Figures 4 and 5 depict a typical case of extended gapping:
both conjuncted clauses have the same finite verb on hõivatud ‘are occupied’ plus the
same oblique dependent kõrvaltöödega ‘with additional jobs’, both are elided in the
second clause. The annotation on Figure 4 is that of v1 of Estonian UD treebank, on
Figure 5 that of the v2.2.

4.3 Non-contiguous gaps

Non-contiguous gapsmake up 5.3% of all elliptical clauses. Among them, themost fre-
quent pattern is that the identical verb and head of a numerical or adjectival modifier
are deleted from the coordinated clause.

Figures 6 and 7 depict a typical example of non-contiguous gapping: the finite verb
form maksti ‘was paid’ and the adverbial modifier rubla ‘rouble’ are deleted from the
coordinated clause. Deletion of finite verb leaves behind two orphaned modifiers:
adverbial modifier tollal ‘then’ and oblique modifier 410 that has been promoted to
the position of the deleted oblique modifier rubla ‘rouble’.

4.4 Stripping constructions

Stripping constructions make up 6.4% of all elliptical clauses in Estonian UD tree-
bank. As already mentioned in Section 2, by stripping everything is deleted from the
coordinated clause except one argument plus an additive or adversative particle.

In the example sentences on Figure 8 and Figure 9 everything except the subject
mõned ‘some’ is deleted from the coordinated clause. The adversative particle mitte
‘not’ reverses the meaning of the stripped coordinated clause. The remaining subject
is annotated as the head of the clause and the adversative particle is attached to it as
an adverbial modifier.

4.5 seda-constructions

3.8% of the clauses with predicate ellipsis are the so-called seda-constructions (cf Sec-
tion 2). Figure 10 depicts a sentence with seda-construction annotated in UD v1 style
and Figure 11 the same sentence as in Estonian UD v2.2. The second coordinated
clause consists of pronominal form seda ‘it/that in partitive case form’ plus an oblique
modifier sündmusega ‘with/by event’ and its determiner mitme ‘several in genitive
case form’. seda is annotated as the head of the elliptical clause and sündmusega as
its ”orphaned” oblique dependent.

4.6 Copular constructions

Clauses with missing copula verb olema ‘be’ make up 28% of all clauses with finite
verb form ellipsis.

A special note on copula sentences is perhaps needed here. Our program also
detects sentences with missing copular verb olema ‘to be’. However, according to
the UD Annotation Guidelines4, the copular clauses are regarded as instances of non-
verbal predication and some argument is annotated as the root of the clause whereas
the copular verb is attached to this root using the syntactic relation label cop. So, the
deletion of olema ‘be’ does not leave behind any ”orphaned” constituents.

64

It should be pointed out that in Estonian texts there seems to be no difference
between deleting olema or any other verb, the clause patterns are more or less the
same. Figure 12 depicts a sentence with two coordinated copular clauses, where the
copular verb form on ‘is’ is deleted from the second clause, but that does not result
in any need for special annotation as the predicatives kitsas ‘narrow’ and tihe ‘tight,
here: heavy’ serve as clause roots. The annotation is the same in both version 1 and
version 2.2 of the Estonian UD treebank.

5 Conclusion
Predicate verb ellipsis is a difficult case for dependency syntax as the finite verb form
should, as a rule, be the head of a clause. In case of its absence, dependency structure
of a clause has to be constructed in some more or less artificial way.

Universal Dependencies’ (UD) syntactic annotation scheme has evolved and changed
over several years and so also the UD treebank annotations need to be amended and
improved for the new treebank releases. Ellipsis, especially gapping and stripping,
are one of those constructions that have been annotated differently in UD versions 1
and 2 and that are planned to have a special annotation (null-node insertion) in the
enhanced version of UD.

This article gave an overview of predicate verb ellipsis – gapping, stripping and
related constructions – in Estonian language and their frequency and annotation in
the Estonian UD treebank versions 1 and 2.2.

Thework described in this article has resulted inmore accurate version of Estonian
UD treebank. The next step would be annotating an enhanced dependencies version
of the Estonian UD treebank. For elliptical constructions it means ”restoring” the
elided predicate verbs as null-nodes and re-attaching and re-naming its dependents.
