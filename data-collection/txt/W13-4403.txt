Abstract 

The accuracy of Chinese parsers trained on Penn 

Chinese Treebank is evidently lower than that of 

the English parsers trained on Penn Treebank. It is 

plausible that the essential reason is the lack of 

surface syntactic constraints in Chinese. In this 

paper, we present evidences to show that strict 

deep syntactic constraints exist in Chinese sen-

tences and such constraints cannot be effectively 

described with context-free phrase structure rules 

as in the Penn Chinese Treebank annotation; we 

show that such constraints may be described pre-

cisely by the idea of Sentence Structure Grammar; 

we introduce how to develop a broad-coverage 

rule-based grammar for Chinese based on this 

idea; we evaluated the grammar and the evaluation 

results show that the coverage of the current 

grammar is 94.2%. 

1 Introduction 

Penn Treebank (PTB) was built based on the idea 

of context-free PSG (Marcus et al., 1993). It is 

now a common practice to develop data-driven 

English parsers using PTB annotation and en-

couraging performances have been reported 

(Collins, 2000; Charniak, 2000). 

Following the success of PTB, Xue et al. 2000 

built Penn Chinese Treebank (CTB). CTB is also 

based on context-free PSG. Since CTB provides 

training data for Chinese parsing, researchers 

attempted to train Chinese parsing with CTB 

(Bikel and Chiang, 2000; Chiang and Bikel, 

2002; Levy and Manning, 2003; Bikel, 2004; 

Wang et al., 2006; Zhang and Clark, 2009; 

Huang et al., 2009). However, these works 

showed that the performances of Chinese parsing 

were significantly worse than English. 

Such inferior performances can be the result of 

several factors. One of them being that Chinese 

is an isolating language. Verbs and nouns of 

Chinese have little morphological paradigms so 

that the surface syntactic constraints of Chinese 

sentences less than English sentences. For exam-

ple, the word “process” acts as different roles in 

English sentences 1a), 1b) and 1c). The mor-

phologies of the word provide constraints for the 

roles that it acts as. As a contrast, “处理/process” 
acts as different roles also in Chinese sentences 

2a), 2b) and 2c), but there is no morphology 

change of the word. Either English PSG rules of 

PTB or Chinese PSG rules of CTB describe sur-

face syntactic structures of sentences. The lack of 

surface syntactic constraints of Chinese causes 

that PSG rules of CTB for Chinese sentences are 

looser than PSG rules of PTB for English sen-

tences. Therefore, we speculate that the lack of 

surface syntactic constraints of Chinese sentenc-

es is the essential reason why the performances 

of Chinese PSG parsing are lower than English 

obviously.

There is another question: are there strict deep 

syntactic constraints in Chinese sentences? If 

there were strict deep syntactic constraints in 

Chinese sentences, and there was grammar for-

mulism capable of describing such constraints 

precisely, then it would be possible to further 

improve the performances of Chinese parsing. 

 In this paper, we present evidences to show that 

there are strict deep syntactic constraints in Chi-

nese sentences, which are constraints of co-

occurrence between deep sentence structures and 

predicate verbs, but such constraints cannot be 

described with PSG rules of CTB (section 2); we 

present examples to show that the idea of Sen-

tence Structure Grammar (SSG) can describe 

such deep syntactic constraints so that SSG rules 

can analyze Chinese sentences deeper and more 

precisely than PSG rules of CTB (section 3);we 

also show  how a broad-coverage Chinese 

grammar was developed based on SSG (section 

4); we evaluate the coverage of the grammar and 

the results show that  its coverage is satisfactory 

(section 5). 

2 Deep Syntactic Constraints in Chinese 
Sentences 

 There are plenty of evidences showing that strict 

deep syntactic constraints exist in Chinese sen-

tences. These are constraints of co-occurrence 

between deep sentence structures and predicate 

verbs. We present some examples here. 

Sentences (3a-3c) and (4a-4c) can be abstracted 

into two deep structures: 5a) and 5b). Since the 

structures like 5a) and 5b) describe the relations 

between the predicate and its semantic-related 

constituents like “Agent” and “Direction”, we 

call such structures as deep sentence structures. 

The deep sentence structures 5a) and 5b) accept 

“飞/fly” as their predicates but not “吃/eat”, and 

“喜欢/like”. Therefore, 3a) and 4a) are gram-
matical sentences but 3b), 3c), 4b) and 4c) are 

ungrammatical. 

 
3a. 鸟儿   向         南方    飞 
      Bird towards south     fly 

      Birds fly towards the south  

3b. *鸟儿   向        南方     吃 
Bird towards south      eat 

      Birds eat towards the south  

3c. *鸟儿   向       南方    喜欢 
Bird towards south     like 

      Birds like towards the south  

4a. 鸟儿  飞    向         南方 
      Bird  fly towards   south  

      Birds fly towards the south  

4b. *鸟儿 吃    向       南方 
      Bird  eat towards   south  

      Birds eat towards the south  

4c. *鸟儿 喜欢   向       南方 
      Bird   like  towards  south  

      Birds like towards the south  

5a. Agent  Direction  V 

5b. Agent  V  xiang4  Direction 
 

Sentences (6a-6c) and (7a-7c) can be abstracted 

into two deep sentence structures: 8a) and 8b). 

8a) and 8b) accept “吃/eat” as their predicates 

but not “飞/fly” and “喜欢/like”. That is why 
6a) and 7a) are grammatical sentences but 6b), 

6c), 7b) and 7c) are ungrammatical. 

 
6a. 鸟儿 把  种子 吃  了 
      Bird  ba  seed  eat  le 

      Birds ate the seeds   

6b. *鸟儿 把 种子 飞 了 
      Bird    ba  seed  fly  le 

      Birds fly the seeds 

6c. *鸟儿 把 种子 喜欢 了 
      Bird    ba  seed   like  le 

      Birds liked the seeds 

7a. 种子 被 鸟儿  吃 了 
      Seed bei bird  eat  le 

      Seeds were eaten by birds  

7b. *种子 被 鸟儿 飞 了 
      Seed  bei  bird  fly  le 

      Seeds were flied by birds 

7c. *种子 被 鸟儿 喜欢 了 
      Seed   bei bird  like    le 

      Seeds were liked by birds 

 

8a. Agent  ba  Object  V  le  

8b. Object bei  Agent  V  le 

 

Sentences (9a-9c) and (10a-10c) can be abstract-

ed into two deep sentence structures: 11a) and 

11b). 11a) and 11b) accept “喜欢/like” as their 

predicates but not “吃/eat” and “飞/fly”. For this 
reason, the sentences 9a) and 10a) are grammati-

cal but 9b), 9c), 10b) and 10c) are ungrammatical 

sentences. 

 
9a. 鸟儿 比  狗儿 喜欢 种子 
      bird  than dog  like  seed 

      Birds like seeds than dogs 

9b. *鸟儿 比 狗儿 飞   种子 
      bird  than dog  fly  seed 

      Birds fly seeds than dogs 

9c. *鸟儿 比  狗儿 吃  种子 
      bird   than dog  eat  seed 

      Birds eat seeds than dogs 

10a. 鸟儿 喜欢 狗儿  偷  种子 
        Bird   like  dog  steal seed 

        Birds like that dogs steal seeds 

12



10b. *鸟儿 飞 狗儿    偷    种子 
        Bird   fly  dogs  steal  seed 

        Birds fly that dogs steal seeds 

10c. *鸟儿 吃 狗儿  偷  种子 
        Bird  eat  dog  steal seed 

        Birds eat that dogs steal seeds 

 

11a. Agent  Comparison  V  Object 

11b. Agent  V  Objects  

 

The above examples provide evidences that 

deep sentence structures and predicate verbs 

choose each other. In another words, constraints 

of co-occurrence between deep sentence struc-

tures and predicate verbs exist widely in Chinese 

sentences. 

Deep sentence structures choose predicates ac-

cording to their deep syntactic properties. “飞

/fly” accepts a direction constituent but not an 
object or a comparison constituent, so it can ap-

pear 5a) and 5b) but not 8a), 8b), 11a) and 11b). 

“吃/eat” accepts an object but not a direction 
constituent or a comparison constituent, thus it 

chooses 8a) and 8b) but not 5a), 5b), 11a) and 

11b); “喜欢/like” accepts an object, an senten-
tial object or a comparison constituent but not a 

direction constituent so that it can be predicates 

of 11a) and 11b) but not 5a), 5b), 8a) and 8b). 

 Constraints of co-occurrence between deep sen-

tence structures and predicate verbs exist in Chi-

nese sentences commonly. Obviously, CTB rules 

that describe sentences with context-free phrase 

structures cannot describe such deep syntactic 

constraints in Chinese sentences so that distin-

guish the grammatical sentences from ungram-

matical sentences in the above sentences. The 

rule set of CTB are written to cover the gram-

matical sentences 3a), 4a), 6a), 7a), 9a), and 10a), 

but they also cover all ungrammatical sentences 

above.

3 Describing Deep Syntactic Con-
straints with SSG Rules 

Sentence Structure Grammar (SSG) is an idea for 

grammar formulism (Wang and Miyazaki, 2007; 

Wang et al., 2012a). SSG focus on describing 

constraints of co-occurrence between deep sen-

tence structures and predicate verbs that are dis-

cussed in section 2.  Deep sentence structures in 

section 2 are treated as rules based on SSG ideas 

(figure 2); predicate verbs are classified accord-

ing to their deep syntactic properties (as shown 

in figure 3); for each type of predicate verbs, on-

ly the deep sentence structures that co-occur with 

them are treated as SSG rules (figure 4). SSG 

rules not only present deeper information but 

avoid effectively covering ungrammatical sen-

tences that are covered by CTB rules. 

We show how SSG rules present deeper infor-

mation than CTB rules. SSG is a kind of context-

free grammar, but its idea to analyze language is 

different from context-free PSG. Rather than 

PSG rules describing a sentence with phrases, 

SSG rules treat a sentence as a whole that con-

sists of a predicate and its semantic-related con-

stituents. For example, PSG rules of CTB ana-

lyze 4a) as shown in figure 1 but SSG rules ana-

lyze the same sentence as shown in figure 2. SSG 

rules present semantic role information like 

“Agent” and “Direction” besides phrase infor-

mation such noun phrase, while CTB rules pre-

sent phrase information and syntactic role like 

“SBJ”.  

 

 
Figure 1: the CTB tree of 4a) 

 

 
Figure 2: the SSG tree of 4a) 

 

We show how SSG rules avoid covering un-

grammatical sentences in section 2, which are 

covered by CTB rules. Predicate verbs would be 

classified according to their deep syntactic prop-

erties based on SSG ideas. The verbs “飞/fly” 
belongs to a type that accept an agent and a di-

rection constituent; “吃/eat” belongs to the type 

13



that accept an agent and an object but not a direc-

tion constituent and a comparison constituent; 

“喜欢/like” is in a type that accept an agent, an 
object, a comparison constituent, and a sentential 

constituent (figure 3). 

 

 
Figure 3: how to classify the predicate verbs based on SSG 

 

For each type of predicate verbs, only deep 

sentence structures that co-occur with them are 

treated as rules. As shown in figure 4, for the 

verbs like “飞/fly”, only 5a) and 5b) are the deep 
sentence structures that co-occur with them, but 

8a), 8b), 11a) and 11b) are not, so only 5a) and 

5b) are described as the SSG rules 13a) and 13b) 

for this type of predicate verbs. In the same way, 

the deep sentence structures 8a) and 8b) are 

treated as the SSG rules 14a) and 14b) for the 

type of predicate verbs like “吃/eat”; the deep 
sentence structures 11a) and 11b) are written as 

the SSG rules 15a) and 15b) for the type of pred-

icate verbs like “喜欢/like”. In this way, the 
SSG rules 13a) and 13b) only cover the gram-

matical sentences 3a) and 4a) but not cover the 

ungrammatical sentences 3b), 3c), 4b) and 4c); 

the SSG rules 14a) and 14b) cover the grammati-

cal sentences 6a) and 7a) but not cover ungram-

matical sentences 6b, 6c), 7b) and 7c); the SSG 

rules 15a) and 15b) cover the grammatical sen-

tences 9a) and 10a) but not cover the ungram-

matical sentences 9b), 9c), 10b) and 10c). The 

constraints of co-occurrence between deep sen-

tence structures and predicate verbs are described 

precisely by SSG rules by this way.

4 Grammar Development for Chinese 
Based on SSG 

A broad-coverage grammar for Chinese, named 

Chinese Sentence Structure Grammar (CSSG), 

had been developed based on SSG (Wang et al., 

2012b). 

The idea of SSG is helpful for developing 

broad-coverage grammar. The predicate verbs of 

Chinese are classified into 52 types according to 

their deep syntactic properties. Such classifica-

tion of predicate verbs provides a clear goal for 

the developer to develop a broad-coverage 

grammar. It is to cover all deep sentence struc-

tures that co-occur with each type of predicate 

verbs (shown in fig. 4). For example, for the type 

of predicate verbs like “吃/eat”, the deep sen-
tence structures (16a-16l) are covered by the 

SSG rules (17a-17l) in CSSG. (16a-16l) include 

various constructions wide-discussed in linguis-

tic literatures like ba-construction, bei-

construction, topic-construction and so on. Fig-

ure 5 shows the SSG trees of (16a-16l).

There is a practical issue when developing a 

broad-coverage grammar based on the SSG idea. 

It is that the number of SSG rules covering a 

kind of language would be huge. Wang and 

Miyazaki 2007 proposed a method to avoid de-

veloping a huge number of rules. They divide 

constituents of a sentence into indispensable 

parts and dispensable parts. Indispensable con-

stituents must appear while dispensable constitu-

ents may or may not appear in a sentence. For 

example, in the SSG rule set 18a), the asterisked 

constituents “advp”, “AS” and “y” are dispensa-

ble constituents, while “Agent”, “Object” and 

“V2” are indispensable constituents. By this way, 

one SSG rule set 18a) can cover a lot of struc-

tures, like (19a-19i) (shown in figure 6).

5  Evaluation and Discussion 

5.1   Evaluation Results 

We evaluated the coverage of CSSG. We chose 

the first 200 sentences from CTB development 

data as the test set. We convert the CTB trees of 

the test data into the CSSG trees semi-

automatically with heuristics and some manual 

correction. Then we evaluate how many con-

structions of the test data are covered by the 

CSSG rules. 

  5,333 construction instances are exacted from 

the test data (table 1). These may be divided into 

3 types:  

1) Sentential constructions: the constructions of 
simple sentences and complex sentences; 

2) Semantic roles: the constructions of semantic 
roles like “Agent”, “Object” and  “Direc-

tion”; 

3) Phrase constructions: the constructions of 
phrase like “np”, “advp” and “tp”. 

Among these constructions, 19.1% are the sen-

tential constructions; 14.4% are the semantic 

roles; 62.9% are the phrase constructions.

Table 2 shows that the coverage of CSSG.  

94.2% of the total constructions of the test data 

are covered by CSSG: 89.3% of sentences con-

Since the coverage of the sentential construc-

tions of the CSSG is lower than the other types, 

we analyze the unmatched sentential construc-

tions further. As shown in table 3, 88.1% of un-

matched sentential constructions are for complex 

sentences, only 11.9% for simple sentences. 

90.5% of the sentential constructions are for 

simple sentences (table 4) and 98.6% of the con-

structions for simple sentences are covered by 

the CSSG (table 5).

2) The constructions for common structures; 
3) The constructions for new types of predicate 

verbs.

the sentential constructions of the CSSG is lower 

than the coverage of the total rules (table 2), but 

88.1% of the unmatched constructions are for 

complex sentences (table 3). As the discussion in 

section 2 and section 3, the CSSG rules focus on 

covering the deep sentence structures of simple 

sentences. The rules for complex sentences are 

still not included by the current version of the 

CSSG.  

Table 4 shows that 90.5% of the sentential con-

structions are for simple sentences, and the cov-

erage of the constructions of simple sentences of 

CSSG is 98.6% (table 5). The results verified 

that the CSSG rules cover the deep sentence 

structures of Chinese widely.  

  There are 13 deep sentence structures that failed 

to be covered by CSSG (table 5). As shown in 

17



table 6, most of them appear commonly but 

CSSG failed to cover these constructions; two of 

them are special structures like 20a) and 20b), 

these structures need to be described with special 

rules; two of them are not covered because their 

predicate verbs are not covered by the current 

version of the CSSG. The two verbs are “获悉

/know from” and “符合/be in accord with”. “获

悉/know from” accept a sentential object and a 

source constituent; “符合/be in accord with” ac-
cept a nominal subject, a sentential subject and 

an object (figure 7). These two types of verbs are 

still not included by the predicate classification 

of CSSG. It is possible to improve the coverage 

of CSSG by adding such new types of verbs to 

the predicate classification of CSSG and describ-

ing the SSG rules for them. For example, the 

predicate verb of 21a) is “获悉/know from”, and 
22a) is the deep sentence structure of 21a); the 

predicate verbs of 23a) and 23b) are  “符合/be in 
accord with”. 24a) and 24b) are the deep sen-

tence structures of 23a) and 23b). We can add the 

new types of predicates like “获悉/know from” 

and “符合/be in accord with” to the predicate 
classification of CSSG, then describe SSG rules 

for the deep sentence structures 22a), 24a) and 

24b). In this way, the coverage of CSSG can be 

further improved.

6 Conclusion and Future Work 

In this paper, we argued that the lack of surface 

syntactic constraints of Chinese is the essential 

reason of the lower performances of the Chinese 

parsing trained on CTB than the English parsing 

trained on PTB. We gave examples to show that 

surface syntactic constraints of Chinese are less 

than English. We presented evidences to show 

that there exist strict deep syntactic constraints in 

Chinese sentences but CTB rules cannot effec-

tively describe such constraints. We showed how 

to describe such deep syntactic constraints pre-

cisely based on SSG and how to develop a 

broad-coverage SSG-based Chinese grammar. 

The evaluating experiment was done and the re-

sults showed that the coverage of the Chinese 

grammar is 94.2%. 

  The CSSG rules analyze Chinese sentences 

deeper and more precisely than the CTB rules, so 

we will attempt to use it for Chinese parsing in 

the future.
