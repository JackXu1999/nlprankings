Abstract

In the third shared task of the Compu-
tational Approaches to Linguistic Code-
Switching (CALCS) workshop, we fo-
cus on Named Entity Recognition (NER)
on code-switched social-media data. We
divide the shared task into two com-
petitions based on the English-Spanish
(ENG-SPA) and Modern Standard Arabic-
Egyptian (MSA-EGY) language pairs. We
use Twitter data and 9 entity types to estab-
lish a new dataset for code-switched NER
benchmarks. In addition to the CS phe-
nomenon, the diversity of the entities and
the social media challenges make the task
considerably hard to process. As a re-
sult, the best scores of the competitions
are 63.76% and 71.61% for ENG-SPA and
MSA-EGY, respectively. We present the
scores of 9 participants and discuss the
most common challenges among submis-
sions.

1 Introduction

Code-switching (CS) is a linguistic behavior that
occurs on spoken and written language. CS hap-
pens when multilingual speakers move back and
forth from one language to another in the same
discourse. The growing incidence of social media
in the way we communicate has also increased the
occurrences of code-switching on informal written
language. As a result, there is a prevalent demand
for more tools and resources that can help to pro-
cess such phenomenon.

In the previous versions of the Computa-
tional Approaches to Linguistic Code-Switching
(CALCS) workshop, we focused on providing
an annotated corpora for language identification
(Solorio et al., 2014; Molina et al., 2016). In this

occasion, we extend the annotations to the Named
Entity Recognition (NER) level. The goal of this
shared task is to provide a code-switched NER
dataset that can help to benchmark NER state-
of-the-art approaches. This will directly impact
the performance of higher-level NLP applications
where the code-switching behavior is commonly
found.

2 Task definition

The task consists of recognizing entities in a rel-
atively short code-switched context. The entity
types for this task are person, organization, loca-
tion, group, title, product, event, time, and other.
We describe each entity type on Section 3.1. Since
NER is a sequential tagging task, we use the
IOB scheme to identify multiple words as a sin-
gle named entity. The addition of this scheme du-
plicates the number of entities in the task yielding
a B(eginning) and I(nside) variations of each of
them. This leaves us with 19 possible labels for
the classification task.

The evaluation of the task uses two versions of
the F1-score. The first is the standard F1, and the
second is the Surface Form F1-score introduced
by Derczynski et al. (2014). The Surface Form
F1-score captures the rare and emerging aspects of
the entities. We average both metrics to determine
the positions in the leaderboard. Additionally, the
shared task was conducted on the CodaLab plat-
form3, where participants are able to directly eval-
uate their approaches against the gold data.

3 Datasets

In this section we provide the definition of our
labels, describe the annotation process and show
the distribution of the ENG-SPA and MSA-EGY
datasets.

3.1 Entity instructions
The named entities have been annotated using the
instructions below. Note that the definitions of the
entity types apply to both language pairs.

• Person: This entity type includes proper
names and nicknames that can identify a per-
son uniquely. We ignore cases where a per-
son is referred by nouns with adjectives that
are not necessarily a nickname. Single artists
and famous people are treated as person.

• Organization: This entity type includes
names of companies, institutions and corpo-
rations, i.e. every entity that has employ-
ees and takes actions as a whole. If the NE
can potentially be any other type, the context
should be sufficient to support whether it is

benchmarks

organization or not (e.g., Facebook as orga-
nization vs. Facebook as the website applica-
tion).

• Location: This NE refers to physical places
that people can visit. It includes cities, coun-
tries, addresses, facilities, touristic places,
etc. This entity type is not to be confused
with organization. For instance, when peo-
ple use organization names to refer to places
that can be visited (e.g., restaurants), those
entities must be tagged as location.

• Group: This NE includes sports teams, mu-
sic bands, duets, etc. Group and organiza-
tion are not to be confused. For example, the
Houston Astros as a team (i.e., group) is dif-
ferent from the Houston Astros institution.

• Product: This NE refers to articles that have
been manufactured or refined for sale, like
devices, medicine, food produced by a com-
pany, any well-defined service, website ac-
counts, etc.

• Title: This type includes titles of movies,
books, TV shows, songs, etc. Very often, ti-
tles can be sentences (e.g., the movie We’re
the Millers). Titles usually refer to media and
must not be confused with the product type.

• Event: This type refers to situations or sce-
narios that gather people for a specific pur-
pose such as concerts, competitions, confer-
ences, award events, etc. Events do not con-
sider holidays.

• Time: This NE includes months, days of the
week, seasons, holidays and dates that hap-
pen periodically, which are not events (e.g.,
Christmas). It excludes hours, minutes, and
seconds. ‘Yesterday’, ‘tomorrow’, ‘week’
and ‘year’ are not tagged as time.

• Other: This type includes any other named
entity that does not fit in the previous cate-
gories. This may include nationalities, lan-
guages, music genres, etc.

The motivation behind these entity types partly
lies on the contextual difference in which they
appear. For instance, when an organization can
be lexically confused with a product, the context
should break down the ambiguity. Additionally,

we tried to include entity types that have an impact
on higher-level NLP applications under similar so-
cial media scenarios.

3.2 ENG-SPA
Data annotation: We use the English-Spanish
language identification dataset introduced in the
first CALCS shared task (Solorio et al., 2014). We
build upon this dataset to generate the entity la-
bels. To annotate the data, we designed a Crowd-
Flower4 job from scratch5. The interface of the job
is described in Figure 2. The job allows annotators
to select one or many words for a single NE. When
the annotators select a word the tool suggests to in-
corporate words surrounding the current selection.
When the selection of a whole entity is done, the
annotators can add the entity to the second step
where the type is determined. The annotators re-
peat this process until no more named entities can
be identified in the tweet. The output of our cus-
tomized job contains the entity type of one or mul-
tiple words that identify an NE according to the
criteria of the annotators. The annotators are re-
quired to know both English and Spanish, and the
job is constrained to reach an accuracy of at least
80%. We also required 3 annotators per tweet. Ad-
ditionally, the job was launched in geographic lo-
cations were both English and Spanish are reason-
ably common. Some of these places were USA,

Mexico, Central America, Puerto Rico, Colombia,
Venezuela, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay and Spain.
After getting the output data from CrowdFlower,
we reviewed the results to correct any possible
mistakes.
Data distribution: The entity types along with
their distribution are listed in Table 1. We provide
training, development and testing6 sets containing
50,757, 832 and 15,634 tweets, respectively. The
development and testing splits are inherited from
previous CALCS Shared Tasks, whereas training
uses the original split with the addition of 40,000
tweets. We added more tweets to the original
training set to increase the number of samples per
entity type since the NER datasets are naturally
skewed. From Table 1, it is worth noting that
the total number of NE training tokens is 18,544
whereas the non-entity tokens add up to 614,013.
This means that only 3% of the tokens of the
training set are NE-related. Likewise, the ratio
of tokens for the development and testing sets are
2.3% and 2.5%, respectively. This skewed distri-
bution poses a great challenge considering that the
datasets are further separated by 18 fine-grained
entity types (i.e., each entity type has a beginning
and inside variations from the IOB scheme). How-
ever, we think that the skewness can be reason-
ably handled with the provided data. Moreover,
the training, development and testing sets draw a

very similar data distribution, which can also help
to adapt the learning from training to testing.

3.3 MSA-EGY

Validating old tweets: For the Modern Standard
Arabic-Egyptian Arabic Dialect (MSA-EGY) lan-
guage pair, we combined the training, develop-
ment, and test sets that we used in the EMNLP
2016 CS Shared Task (Molina et al., 2016) to cre-
ate the new training corpora for the NER Shared
Task. The data was harvested from Twitter. We
apply a number of quality and validation checks
to insure the quality of the old data. Therefore,
we retrieved all old tweets using the the new ver-
sion of the Arabic Tweets Token Assigner which is
made available through the Shared Task website 7.
One of the main reasons for the re-crawling step is

7https://code-switching.github.io/
2018/

to eliminate the tweets that have been deleted, or
the tweets that belong to the users whose accounts
are suspended by Twitter. The other reason is that
some tweets may cause encoding issues when they
are retrieved using the crawler script. Thus, all
these tweets were removed and eliminated. Af-
ter performing the validation checks, we accepted
and published 11,224 tweets (10,102 tweets for the
training set, and 1,122 tweets for the development
set).

.
Data creation and annotation: Since we com-
bined the test set used in the EMNLP-2016
CS Shared Task (Molina et al., 2016) with the
dataset used in the EMNLP-2014 CS Shared Task
(Solorio et al., 2014) to form the new training and
development sets, we needed to crawl and anno-
tate a new test set for our new Shared Task. We
resorted to using the Tweepy library to harvest the
timeline of 12 Egyptian public figures. We ap-
plied the same filtration criteria when crawling and
building the test set used in the 2016 CS shared
task (Molina et al., 2016). We divided the old com-
bined tweets into training and development sets as
follows: 80% train set and 10% development set.
Thus, we needed∼ 1,110 tweets, which represents
the 10% of the new test set. As we did in the previ-
ous Shared Task, we wanted to consider choosing
tweets from public figures whose tweets contain
more code-switching points. Therefore, we re-
sorted to using the Automatic Identification of Di-
alectal Arabic (AIDA2) tool (Al-Badrashiny et al.,
2015) to perform token-level language identifica-
tion for the MSA and EGY tokens in context. Pub-
lic figures with more than 35% of code-switching
points in their tweets were considered. The an-
notation work of the MSA-EGY dataset was done
in-lab by two trained Egyptian native speakers.
Our annotation team followed the Named Entity
Annotation Guidelines for MSA-EGY, which is
made available through the Shared Task website
8. In the two previous editions of the CS Shared
Task (Solorio et al., 2014; Molina et al., 2016),
we used a Named Entity (“ne”) tag. The “ne”
tag was defined as a word or multi-word that rep-
resents names of a unique entity such as peo-
ple’s names, countries and places, organizations,
companies, websites, etc. The AIDA2 tool (Al-
Badrashiny et al., 2015) was used to assign initial
automatic tags for highly confident data categories

(i.e., URL, Punctuation, Number, etc) in addition
to named entities. Then, we extracted and pre-
pared all the tweets that contained “ne” for anno-
tation. As we mentioned earlier, the IOB scheme
is used as an annotation scheme to identify multi-
ple words as a single named entity. All the URLs,
Punctuation and Numbers tags are deterministi-
cally converted to “O” tag, while the tweets that
include “ne” tags were given to our in-lab annota-
tors for validation and re-annotation if needed.

.
Quality checks and data distribution: We com-
puted the Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA) on
10% of the dataset to validate the performance and
agreement among annotators. One of our annota-
tors is a specialist linguist who carried out adju-
dication and revisions of accuracy measurements.
We approached a stable Inter Annotator Agree-
ment (IAA) of over 92% pairwise agreement. The
workflow of the annotation process for MSA-EGY

is shown in Figure-3.
The total number of tweets in MSA-EGY

dataset is 12,334 tweets. It is divided into three
sets train, development, and test sets (10,102,
1,122, 1,110 tweets, respectively). Table 1 shows
that the total number of NE training tokens is
23,093. It means that NE tokens represent 11.3%
of the total number of tokens. Similarly, the per-
centages of NE tokens in the development and test
sets are 7.5%, 11.9%, respectively. As we men-
tioned earlier, the MSA-EGY tweets were har-
vested from the timeline of 12 Egyptian politicians
public figures. Generally, politicians tend to use
NEs more often when they write their tweets. This
explains why the percentage of the NE tokens in
MSA-EGY dataset is higher than the percentage
of the NE tokens in ESP-ENG dataset.

4 Approaches

In this section, we briefly describe the systems of
the participants and discuss their results as well as
the final scores.

• IIT BHU (Trivedi et al., 2018). They pro-
posed a “new architecture based on gating of
character- and word-based representation of
a token”. They captured the character and the
word representations using a CNN and a bidi-
rectional LSTM, respectively. They also used
the Multi-Task Learning on the output layer
and transfer the learning to a CRF classifier
following Aguilar et al. (2017). Moreover,
they fed a gazetteers representation to their
model.

• CAiRE++ (Winata et al., 2018). They used a
bidirectional LSTM model for characters and
words. They primarily focused on OOV us-
ing the FastText library (Bojanowski et al.,
2016).

• FAIR (Wang et al., 2018). They proposed a
joint bidirectional LSTM-CRF network that
uses attention at the embedding layer. They
also preprocessed the data before feeding the
network.

• Linguists (Jain et al., 2018). They used a
Conditional Random Fields with many hand-
crafted features. Their focus was primarily
on English-Spanish data.

• Flytxt (Sikdar et al., 2018). This team
also employed a Conditional Random Fields.

Table 2: The table shows the main component and strategies used by the participants. Ext Res means

features such as capitalization.

They fed the CRF with features from both ex-
ternal and internal resources. Additionally,
they incorporated the language identification
labels of the datasets from the previous ver-
sions of this workshop.

• semantic (Geetha et al., 2018). They jointly
trained a Bidirectional LSTM with a Condi-
tional Random Fields on the output layer.

• BATs (Janke et al., 2018). They used a Con-
ditional Random Fields with multiple fea-
tures. Some of those features were also used
for neural network, but they got better results
with the CRF approach.

• Fraunhofer FKIE (Claeser et al., 2018).
They used a Support Vector Machine (SVM)
classifier with a Radial Basis kernel. They
handcrafted a lot of features and also in-
cluded gazetteers.

• GHHT (Attia and Samih, 2018). They
trained a BLSTM-CRF network using pre-
trained word embeddings, brown clusters and
gazetteers.

• Baseline. We used a simple Bidirectional
LSTM network with randomly initialized
embedding vectors of 200 dimensions. We
also used dropout operations on each direc-
tion of the BLSTM component.

5 Evaluation and results

5.1 Evaluation
The evaluation of the shared task was conducted
through CodaLab, where the participants were

able to obtain immediate feedback of their submis-
sions. The metrics used for the evaluation phase
were the standard harmonic mean F1-score and
the Surface Form F1 variation proposed by Der-
czynski et al. (2014). Additionally, to have a sin-
gle leaderboard per language pair, we unified both
metrics by averaging them. The average values are
the ones described in Table 3.

As stated by (Derczynski et al., 2014), the idea
of the Surface Form F1-score is to capture the
novel and emerging aspects that are usually en-
countered in social media data. Those aspects de-
scribe a fast-moving language that constantly pro-
duces new entities challenging more the recall ca-
pabilities of state-of-the-art models than the preci-
sion side.

5.2 Results and Error analysis

Although all the scores reported by the partici-
pants outperformed the baselines in both ENG-
SPA and MSA-EGY language pairs, the results
are arguably low considering that the current state-
of-the-art systems achieve around 91.2% of F1-
score on well-formatted text (Lample et al., 2016;
Ma and Hovy, 2016; Liu et al., 2017). As
mentioned before, the best performing systems
reached 63.76% (Trivedi et al., 2018) and 71.61%
(Wang et al., 2018) for ENG-SPA and MSA-EGY,
respectively. These low outcomes are aligned with
the challenges that come along with social media
data and the addition of more heterogeneous entity
types (Ritter et al., 2011; Augenstein et al., 2017;
Derczynski et al., 2014; Aguilar et al., 2018).

Most of the MSA-EGY tweets are related to
politics because they were harvested from the

timeline of number of Egyptian politician public
figures. Generally, these kinds of tweets encom-
pass more NEs in comparison with other kinds of
tweets. This explains why the percentage of the
NE tokens in MSA-EGY dataset is high compared
to the NEs’ percentage in ESP-ENG data set. This
high percentage of NE tokens helps the submitted
systems to see and learn more examples and pat-
terns. Thus, systems can generalize more effec-
tively.

According to the results of the participants in
the ENG-SPA shared task, the top three most chal-
lenging entity types were event, title, and time. It
is worth noting that these three classes are more or
less the least frequent types in the dataset (see Ta-
ble 1), which suggests that having more data sam-
ples would produce better results. However, in the
case of title, there are 1,980 samples against 1,381
samples of organization, and the performance is
significantly better for the latter one (19% vs. 35%
of F1-scores). Additionally, looking at Table 4, the
entity Orange is the New Black was not recognized
by participants as a title. This is an example of
what we refer to heterogeneous entity type, mean-

ing that the entity instances are flexible in format
that can even describe independent sentences (i.e.,
a homogeneous type is person). The entities Love
Man (title), Billboard 2014 (event), and show de
shamu (event) also describe the same pattern and
they were hardly identified by participants.

Unlike English and Spanish language pair
which can be considered as two distinct languages,
Modern Standard Arabic and Egyptian are more
closely related which makes the task of identifying
NE tokens more challenging. This is mainly due
to the fact that Modern Standard Arabic and Egyp-
tian are close variants of one another and hence
they share considerable amount of lexical items.
Some of the challenges faced by the participants
include words that still have punctuation attached
to them (e.g. rO) , (mSr, (Egypt ) . In or-
der to mitigate these issues, some participants pre-
processed these cases by, for example, removing
any leading and trailing punctuation from those to-
kens. Other participants normalized these cases by
unifying all the attached punctuations, while the
remaining participants decided to keep them and
let their model learn them. Table 5 and the follow-
ing examples show some challenges faced by the
submitted systems:

• Clitic attachment can obscure tokens, e.g.
¢l�¤ wAllh “and-God” or ”swear”.

• Clitic attachment can obscure tokens, e.g.
Yn¤ wmnY “and-Mona” or ”swear”.

6 Related work

Before the CALCS workshop series, the code-
switching behavior was studied from different per-
spectives and for many languages (Toribio, 2001;
Solorio and Liu, 2008a,b; Piergallini et al., 2016;
AlGhamdi et al., 2016). Most of them focused
on either exploring this phenomenon or solving
core code-switching tasks from the NLP pipeline.
More recently, researchers have been considering
the sentiment analysis task on code-switching set-
tings (Lee and Wang, 2015; Vilares et al., 2015).
However, the lack of resources at the core level of
the NLP pipeline greatly reduces the chances of
improving higher-level applications. In this line,
we aim at providing two datasets for named entity
recognition benchmarks on the English-Spanish
and Modern Standard Arabic-Egyptian language
pairs.

It worth noting that there are some contributions
of CS corpora, such as a collection of Turkish-
German CS tweets (Calzolari et al., 2016), a large
collection of Modern Standrd Arabic and Egyp-
tian Dialectal Arabic CS data (Diab et al., 2016)
and a collection of sentiment annotated Spanish-
English tweets (Vilares et al., 2016). Named en-
tity recognition has been vastly studied along the

years (Sang and Meulder, 2003). More recently,
however, the focus has drastically moved to social
media data due to the great incidence that social
networks have in our daily communication (Ritter
et al., 2011; Augenstein et al., 2017). The work-
shop on Noisy User-generated Text (W-NUT) has
been a great effort towards the study of named en-
tity recognition on noisy data. In 2016, the or-
ganizers focused on named entities from different
topics to evaluate the adaptation of models from
one topic to another (Strauss et al., 2016). In
2017, the organizers introduced the Surface Form
F1-score metric and collected data from multiple
social media platforms (Derczynski et al., 2014).
The challenge not only lies on the entity types and
the social media noisy but also in the distribution
of the datasets and their different data domain pat-
terns.

7 Conclusion

We presented the setup and results of the 3rd
shared task of the Computational Approaches to
Linguistic Code-Switching workshop. We intro-
duced a named entity recognition dataset focused
on code-switched social media text for two lan-
guage pairs: English-Spanish and Modern Stan-
dard Arabic-Egyptian. We received submissions
from nine teams, eight of them submitted to ENG-
SPA and six to MSA-EGY. Similar to the pre-
vious sequence tagging tasks of our workshop,
the predominant aspect among the approaches
was the Conditional Random Fields. Addition-
ally, the combination of the CRF with a bidirec-
tional LSTM (with some variations) yielded the
best results among participants. The best F1-
score for ENG-SPA was 63.7628% and for MSA-
EGY was 71.6154%. Compared to monolingual
formal text (i.e., newswire), the reported scores
are significantly lower due to the code-switching
phenomenon as well as the noise of SM envi-
ronment. This serves as strong evidence that we
need more robust approaches that can detect and
process named entities in such challenging condi-
tions.
