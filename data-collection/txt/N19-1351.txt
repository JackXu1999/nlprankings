Abstract

Current state of the art systems in NLP heav-
ily rely on manually annotated datasets, which
are expensive to construct. Very little work ad-
equately exploits unannotated data – such as
discourse markers between sentences – mainly
because of data sparseness and ineffective ex-
traction methods. In the present work, we pro-
pose a method to automatically discover sen-
tence pairs with relevant discourse markers,
and apply it to massive amounts of data. Our
resulting dataset contains 174 discourse mark-
ers with at least 10K examples each, even for
rare markers such as coincidentally or amaz-
ingly. We use the resulting data as supervision
for learning transferable sentence embeddings.
In addition, we show that even though sen-
tence representation learning through predic-
tion of discourse markers yields state of the art
results across different transfer tasks, it is not
clear that our models made use of the semantic
relation between sentences, thus leaving room
for further improvements. Our datasets are
publicly available 1

1 Introduction

An important challenge within the domain of nat-
ural language processing is the construction of ad-
equate semantic representations for textual units –
from words over sentences to whole documents.
Recently, numerous approaches have been pro-
posed for the construction of vector-based repre-
sentations for larger textual units, especially sen-
tences. One of the most popular frameworks aims
to induce sentence embeddings as an intermedi-
ate representation for predicting relations between
sentence pairs. For instance, similarity judge-
ments (paraphrases) or inference relations have
been used as prediction tasks, and the resulting
embeddings perform well in practice, even when

synapse-developpement/Discovery

the representations are transfered to other seman-
tic tasks (Conneau et al., 2017). However, the kind
of annotated data that is needed for such super-
vised approaches is costly to obtain, prone to bias,
and arguably fairly limited with regard to the kind
of semantic information captured, as they single
out a narrow aspect of the entire semantic content.

Unsupervised approaches have also been pro-
posed, based on sentence distributions in large cor-
pora in relation to their discourse context. For in-
stance, Kiros et al. (2015) construct sentence rep-
resentations by trying to reconstruct neighbouring
sentences, which allows them to take into account
different contextual aspects of sentence meaning.
In the same vein, Logeswaran et al. (2016) propose
to predict if two sentences are consecutive, even
though such local coherence can be straightfor-
wardly predicted with relatively shallow features
(Barzilay and Lapata, 2008). A more elaborate
setting is the prediction of the semantic or rhetor-
ical relation between two sentences, as is the goal
of discourse parsing. A number of annotated cor-
pora exist, such as RST-DT (Carlson et al., 2001)
and PDTB (Prasad et al., 2008), but in general
the available data is fairly limited, and the task
of discourse relation prediction is rather difficult.
The problem, however, is much easier when there
is a marker that makes the semantic link explicit
(Pitler et al., 2008), and this observation has of-
ten been used in a semi-supervised setting to pre-
dict discourse relations in general (Rutherford and
Xue, 2015). Building on this observation, one ap-
proach to learn sentence representations is to pre-
dict such markers or clusters of markers explicitly
(Jernite et al., 2017; Malmi et al., 2018; Nie et al.,
2017). Consider the following sentence pair:

I live in Paris. But I’m often abroad.

The discourse marker but highlights an op-
position between the first sentence (the speaker

lives in Paris) and the second sentence (the
speaker is often abroad). The marker can thus
be straightforwardly used as a label between sen-
tence pairs. In this case, the task is to pre-
dict c = but (among other markers) for the pair
(I live in Paris, I’m often abroad). Note that dis-
course markers can be considered as noisy labels
for various semantic tasks, such as entailment (c =
therefore), subjectivity analysis (c = personally)
or sentiment analysis (c = sadly). More gener-
ally, discourse markers indicate how a sentence
contributes to the meaning of a text, and they pro-
vide an appealing supervision signal for sentence
representation learning based on language use.

A wide variety of discourse usages would be
desirable in order to learn general sentence rep-
resentations. Extensive research in linguistics has
resulted in elaborate discourse marker inventories
for many languages.2 These inventories were cre-
ated by manual corpus exploration or annotation
of small-scale corpora: the largest annotated cor-
pus, the English PDTB consists of a few tens of
thousand examples, and provides a list of about
100 discourse markers, organized in a number of
categories.

Previous work on sentence representation learn-
ing with discourse markers makes use of even
more restricted sets of discourse markers, as
shown in table 2. Jernite et al. (2017) use 9 cate-
gories as labels, accounting for 40 discourse mark-
ers in total. It should be noted that the aggregate
labels do not allow for any fine-grained distinc-
tions; for instance, the TIME label includes both
now and next, which is likely to impair the super-
vision. Moreover, discourse markers may be am-
biguous; for example now can be used to express
contrast. On the other hand, Nie et al. (2017) make
use of 15 discourse markers, 5 of which are ac-
counting for more than 80% of their training data.
In order to ensure the quality of their examples,
they only select pairs matching a dependency pat-
tern manually specified for each marker. As such,

2See for instance a sample of language on the Textlink
project website: http://www.textlink.ii.metu.
edu.tr/dsd-view

both of these studies use a restricted or impover-
ished set of discourse markers; they also both use
the BookCorpus dataset, whose size (4.7M sen-
tences that contain a discourse marker, according
to Nie et al., 2017) is prohibitively small for the
prediction of rare discourse markers.

In this work we use web-scale data in order to
explore the prediction of a wide range of discourse
markers, with more balanced frequency distribu-
tions, along with application to sentence represen-
tation learning. We use English data for the exper-
iments, but the same method could be applied to
any language that bears a typological resemblance
with regard to discourse usage, and has sufficient
amounts of textual data available (e.g. German or
French). Inspired by recent work (Dasgupta et al.,
2018; Poliak et al., 2018; Levy et al., 2018; Glock-
ner et al., 2018) on the unexpected properties of
recent manually labelled datasets (e.g. SNLI), we
will also analyze our dataset to check whether la-
bels are easy to guess, and whether the proposed
model architectures make use of high-level rea-
soning for their predictions. Our contributions are
as follows:

– we propose a simple and efficient method to
discover new discourse markers, and present
a curated list of 174 markers for English;

– we provide evidence that many connectives
can be predicted with only simple lexical fea-
tures;

– we investigate whether relation prediction ac-
tually makes use of the relation between sen-
tences;

– we carry out extensive experiments based on
the Infersent/SentEval framework.

2 Discovering discourse markers

2.1 Rationale

Our goal is thus to capture semantic aspects of
sentences by means of distributional observations.
For our training signal, we aim at something more
evolved than just plain contextual co-occurrence,

Table 2: Discourse markers or classes used by previous work on unsupervised representation learning

but simpler than a full-fledged encoder-decoder à
la Skip-Thought. In that respect, discourse rela-
tions are an interesting compromise, if we can re-
liably extract them in large quantities. This ob-
jective is shared with semi-supervised approaches
to discourse relation prediction, where automati-
cally extracted explicit instances feed a model tar-
getting implicit instances (Marcu and Echihabi,
2002; Sporleder and Lascarides, 2008; Pitler and
Nenkova, 2009; Rutherford and Xue, 2015). In
this perspective, it is important to collect unam-
biguous instances of potential discourse markers.
To do so, previous work used heuristics based on
specific constructs, especially syntactic patterns
for intra-sentential relations, based on a fixed list
of manually collected discourse markers. Since
we focus on sentence representations, we limit
ourselves to discourse arguments that are well-
formed sentences, thus also avoiding clause seg-
mentation issues.

Following a heuristic from Rutherford and Xue
(2015), also considered by Malmi et al. (2018) and
Jernite et al. (2017), we collect pairs of sentences
(s1, s2) where s2 starts with marker c. We only
consider the case where c is a single word, as de-
tecting longer adverbial constructions is more dif-
ficult. We remove c from the beginning of s2 and
call the resulting sentence s′2. Malmi et al. (2018)
make use of a list of the 80 most frequent discourse
markers in the PDTB in order to extract suitable
sentence pairs. We stay faithful to Rutherford and
Xue (2015)’s heuristic, as opposed to Malmi et al.
(2018); Jernite et al. (2017): if s2 starts with c fol-
lowed by a comma, and c is an adverbial or a con-
junction, then it is a suitable candidate. By limit-
ing ourselves to sentences that contain a comma,
we are likely to ensure that s′2 is meaningful and
grammatical. As opposed to all the cited work
mentioned above, we do not restrict the pattern to
a known list of markers, but try to collect new re-

liable cues.
This pattern is decisively restrictive, since dis-

course markers often appear at the clausal level
(e.g. I did it but now I regret it). But clauses
are not meant to be self contained, and it is not
obvious that they should be included in a dataset
for sentence representation learning. At the same
time, one could easily think of cases where c is
not a discourse marker, e.g. (s1, s2)= (“It’s cold.”,
“Very, very cold.”). However, these uses might be
easily predicted with shallow language models. In
the next section, we use the proposed method for
the discovery of discourse markers, and we inves-
tigate whether the resulting dataset leads to im-
proved model performance.

2.2 Methodology

We use sentences from the Depcc corpus
(Panchenko et al., 2017), which consists of En-
glish texts harvested from commoncrawl web data.
We sample 8.5 billion consecutive sentence pairs
from the corpus. We keep 53% of sentence pairs
that contain between 3 and 32 words, have a high
probability of being English (> 75%) using Fast-
Text langid from Grave et al. (2018), have bal-
anced parentheses and quotes, and are mostly low-
ercase. We use NLTK (Bird et al., 2009) as sen-
tence tokenizer and NLTK PerceptronTagger as
part of speech tagger for adverb recognition. In
addition to our automatically discovered candidate
set, we also include all (not necessarily adverbial)
PDTB discourse markers that are not induced by
our method. Taking this into account, 3.77% of
sentence pairs contained a discourse marker can-
didate, which is about 170M sentence pairs. An
example from the dataset is shown in table 1. We
only keep pairs in which the discourse marker oc-
curs at least 10K times. We also subsample pairs
so that the maximum occurrence count of a dis-
course marker is 200K. The resulting dataset con-

markers; the horizontal line indicates the subsampling

tains 19M pairs.
We discovered 243 discourse marker candi-

dates. Figure 1 shows their frequency distribu-
tions. As expected, the most frequent markers
dominate the training data, but when a wide range
of markers is included, the rare ones still con-
tribute up to millions of training instances. Out
of the 42 single word PDTB markers that precede
a comma, 31 were found by our rule. Some mark-
ers are missing because of NLTK errors, which
mainly result from morphological issues.3

2.3 Controlling for shallow features

As previously noted, some candidates discovered
by our rule may not be actual discourse markers.
In order to discard them, we put forward the hy-
pothesis that actual discourse markers cannot be
predicted with shallow lexical features. Inspired
by Gururangan et al. (2018), we use a Fasttext
classifier (Joulin et al., 2016) in order to predict
c from s′2. The Fasttext classifier predicts labels
from an average of word embeddings fed to a lin-
ear classifier. We split the dataset in 5 folds, and
we predict markers for each fold, while training on
the remaining folds. We use a single epoch, ran-
domly initialized vectors of size 100 (that can be
unigrams, bigrams or trigrams) and a learning rate
of 0.5.

In addition, we predict c from the concatenation
of s1 and s′2 (using separate word representations
for each case). One might assume that the predic-
tion of c in this case relies on the interaction be-
tween s1 and s2; however, the features of s1 and
s2 within Fasttext’s setup only interact additively,

3For instance, lovely is tagged as an adverb because of its
suffix, while besides was never tagged as an adverb

which means that the classification most likely re-
lies on individual cues in the separate sentences,
rather than on their combination. In order to test
this hypothesis, we introduce a random shuffle op-
eration: for each example (s1, s′2, c), s

′
2 is replaced

by a random sentence from a pair that is equally
linked by c (we perform this operation separately
in train and test sets).

Table 3 indicates that shallow lexical fea-
tures indeed yield relatively high prediction rates.
Moreover, the shuffle operation indeed increases
accuracy, which corroborates the hypothesis that
classification with shallow features relies on indi-
vidual cues from separate sentences, rather than
their combination.

dates that are unlikely to be interesting discourse cues.

Interestingly, the two most predictable candi-
dates are not discourse markers. Upon inspection
of harvested pairs, we noticed that even legitimate
discourse markers can be guessed with relatively
simple heuristics in numerous examples. For ex-
ample, c = thirdly is very likely to occur if s1 con-
tains secondly. We use this information to option-
ally filter out such simple instances, as described
in the next section.

2.4 Dataset variations
In the following, we call our method Discovery.
We create several variations of the sentence pairs
dataset. In DiscoveryHard, we remove examples
where the candidate marker was among the top
5 predictions in our Fasttext shallow model and
keep only the 174 candidate markers with a fre-
quency of at least 10k. Instances are then sampled
randomly so that each marker appears exactly 10k
times in the dataset.

Subsequently, the resulting set of discourse
markers is also used in the other variations of our
dataset. DiscoveryBase designates the dataset for
which examples predicted with the Fasttext model
were not removed. In order to measure the ex-
tent to which the model makes use of the rela-
tion between s1 and s′2, we also create a Dis-
coveryShuffled dataset, which is the Discovery-
Base dataset subjected to the random shuffle oper-
ation described previously. To isolate the contribu-
tion of our discovery method, the dataset Discov-
eryAdv discards all discourse markers from PDTB
that were not found by our method. Also, in or-
der to measure the impact of label diversity, Dis-
covery10 uses 174k examples for each of the 10
most frequent markers,4 thus totalling as many in-
stances as DiscoveryBase. Finally, DiscoveryBig
contains almost twice as many instances as Dis-
coveryBase, i.e. 20k instances for each discourse
marker (although, for a limited number of mark-
ers, the number of instances is slightly lower due
to data sparseness).

3 Evaluation of sentence representation
learning

3.1 Setup
Our goal is to evaluate the effect of using our
various training datasets on sentence encoding,
given encoders of equivalent capacity and similar

4They are: however, hence, moreover, additionally, never-
theless, furthermore, alternatively, again, next, therefore

setups. Thus, we follow the exact setup of In-
fersent (Conneau et al., 2017), also used in the
Dissent (Malmi et al., 2018) model: we learn
to encode sentences into h with a bi-directional
LSTM sentence encoder using element-wise max
pooling over time. The dimension size of h is
4096. Word embeddings are fixed GloVe embed-
dings with 300 dimensions, trained on Common
Crawl 840B.5 A sentence pair (s1, s2) is repre-
sented with [h1, h2, h1 � h2, |h2 − h1|],6 which
is fed to a softmax in order to predict a marker
c. Our datasets are split in 90% train, 5% vali-
dation, and 5% test. Optimization is done with
SGD (learning rate is initialized at 0.1, decayed by
1% at each epoch and by 80% if validation accu-
racy decreases; learning stops when learning rate
is below 10−5 and the best model on training task
validation loss is used for evaluation; gradient is
clipped when its norm exceeds 5). Once the sen-
tence encoder has been trained on a base task, the
resulting sentence embeddings are tested with the
SentEval library (Conneau et al., 2017).

We evaluate the different variations of our
dataset we described above in order to analyze
their effect, and compare them to a number of ex-
isting models. Table 7 displays the tasks used for
evaluation. For further analysis, table 9 displays
the result of Linguistic Probing using the method
by Conneau et al. (2018). Although these tasks are
primarily designed for understanding the content
of embeddings, they also focus on aspects that are
desirable to perform well in general semantic tasks
(e.g. prediction of tense, or number of object).

3.2 Results

Table 6 gives an overview of transfer learning
evaluation, also comparing to other supervised and
unsupervised approaches. Note that we outper-
form DisSent on all tasks except TREC7 with less
than half the amount of training examples. In ad-
dition, our approach is arguably simpler and faster.

MTL (Subramanian et al., 2018) only achieves
stronger results than our method on the MRPC and
SICK tasks. The MTL model uses 124M train-
ing examples with an elaborate multi-task setup,
training on 45M sentences with manual transla-
tion, 1M pairs from SNLI/MNLI, 4M parse trees
of sentences, and 74M consecutive sentence pairs.

Table 6: SentEval evaluation results with our models trained on various datasets. The first two models are su-
pervised, the other ones unsupervised. All scores are accuracy percentages, except SICK-R, which is Pearson
correlation percentage. InferSent is from Conneau et al. (2017), MTL is the multi-task learning based model from
Subramanian et al. (2018). Evaluation tasks are described in table 7, and N denotes the number of examples for
each dataset (in millions). Dissent is from Nie et al. (2017), QuickThought is from Logeswaran and Lee (2018)
with fixed embeddings configuration. The best result per task appears in bold, the best result for unsupervised
setups is underlined.

The model also fine-tunes word embeddings in or-
der to achieve a higher capacity. It is therefore re-
markable that our model outperforms it on many
tasks. Besides, MTL is not a direct competitor
to our approach since its main contribution is its
multi-task setup, and it could benefit from using
our training examples.

Our best model rivals (and indeed often out-
performs) QuickThought on all tasks, except re-
latedness (SICK-R). QuickThought’s training task
is to predict whether two sentences are contigu-
ous, which might incentivize the model to perform
well on a relatedness task. We also outperform In-
ferSent on many tasks except entailment and relat-
edness. Entailment prediction is the explicit train-
ing signal for Infersent.

To help the analysis of our different model vari-
ations, table 8 displays the test scores on each
dataset for the original training task. It also
shows the related PDTB implicit relation predic-
tion scores. The PDTB is annotated with a hierar-
chy of relations, with 5 classes at level 1 (includ-
ing the EntRel relation), and 16 at level 2 (with
one relation absent from the test). It is interest-
ing to see that this form of simple semi-supervised
learning for implicit relation prediction performs
quite well, especially for fine-grained relations, as
the best model slightly beats the best current ded-
icated model, listed at 40.9% in Xue et al. (2017).

DiscoveryHard scores lower on its training task
than DiscoveryBase, and it also performs worse
on transfer learning tasks. This makes sense,
since lexical features are important to solve the

evaluation tasks. Our initial hypothesis was that
more difficult instances might force the model
to use higher-level reasoning, but this does not
seem to be the case. More surprisingly, prevent-
ing the encoders to use the relationship between
sentences, as in DiscoveryShuffled, does not sub-
stantially hurt the transfer performance, which re-
mains on average higher than Nie et al. (2017).
Additionally, our models score well on linguistic
probing tasks. They outperform Infersent on all
tasks, which seems to contradict the claim that
SNLI data allows for learning of universal sen-
tence representations (Conneau et al., 2017). And
a final interesting outcome is that the diversity of
markers (e.g. using DiscoveryBase instead of Dis-
covery10) seems to be important for good perfor-
mance on those tasks, since Discovery10 has the
worst overall performance on average.

3.3 Visualisation

The softmax weights learned during the training
phase can be interpreted as embeddings for the
markers themselves, and used to visualize their
relationships. Figure 2 shows a TSNE (van der
Maaten and Hinton, 2008) plot of the markers’
representations. Proximity in the feature space
seems to reflect semantic similarity (e.g. usu-

ally/normally). In addition, the markers we dis-
covered, colored in red, blend with the PDTB
markers (depicted in black). It would be interest-
ing to cluster markers in order to empirically de-
fine discourse relations, but we leave this for future
work.

4 Related work

Though discourse marker prediction in itself is an
interesting and useful task (Malmi et al., 2017),
discourse markers have often been used as a train-
ing cue in order to improve implicit relation pre-
diction (Marcu and Echihabi, 2001; Sporleder and
Lascarides, 2005; Zhou et al., 2010; Braud and
Denis, 2016). This approach has been extended
to general representation learning by Jernite et al.
(2017)—although with empirically unconvincing
results, which might be attributed to an inappropri-
ate training/evaluation set-up, or the use of a lim-
ited number of broad categories instead of actual
discourse markers. Nie et al. (2017) used the more
standard InferSent framework and obtained bet-
ter results, although they were still outperformed
by QuickThought (Logeswaran and Lee, 2018),

which uses a much simpler training task. Both
of these rely on pre-established lists of discourse
markers provided by the PDTB, and both per-
form a manual annotation for each marker—Nie
et al. (2017) uses dependency patterns, while Jer-
nite et al. (2017) uses broad discourse categories.
Our work is the first to automatically discover dis-
course markers from text.

More generally, various automatically extracted
training signals have been used for unsupervised
learning tasks. Hashtags (Felbo et al., 2017) have
been sucessfully exploited in order to learn sen-
timent analysis from unlabelled tweets, but their
availability is mainly limited to the microblog-
ging domain. Language modeling provides a gen-
eral training signal for representation learning,
even though there is no obvious way to derive
sentence representations from language models.
BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) currently holds the
best results in transfer learning based on language
modeling, but it relies on sentence pair classifi-
cation in order to compute sentence embeddings,
and it makes use of a simple sentence contigu-
ity detection task (like QuickThought); this task
does not seem challenging enough since BERT re-
portedly achieves 98% detection accuracy. Phang
et al. (2018) showed that the use of SNLI datasets
yields significant gains for the sentence embed-
dings from Radford (2018), which are based on
language modeling.

For the analysis of our models, we draw inspira-
tion from critical work on Natural Language Infer-
ence datasets (Dasgupta et al., 2018; Levy et al.,
2018). Gururangan et al. (2018); Poliak et al.
(2018) show that baseline models that disregard

the hypothesis yield good results on SNLI, which
suggests that the model does not perform the high
level reasoning we would expect in order to pre-
dict the correct label. They attribute this effect
to bias in human annotations. In this work, we
show that this issue is not inherent to human la-
beled data, and propose the shuffle perturbation in
order to measure to what extent the relationship
between sentences is used.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we introduce a novel and efficient
method to automatically discover discourse mark-
ers from text, and we use the resulting set of can-
didate markers for the construction of an exten-
sive dataset for semi-supervised sentence repre-
sentation learning. A number of dataset variations
are evaluated on a wide range of transfer learn-
ing tasks (as well as implicit discourse recogni-
tion) and a comparison with existing models indi-
cates that our approach yields state of the art re-
sults on the bulk of these tasks. Additionally, our
analysis shows that removing ‘simple’ examples
is detrimental to transfer results, while preventing
the model to exploit the relationship between sen-
tences has a negligible effect. This leads us to be-
lieve that, even though our approach reaches state
of the art results, there is still room for improve-
ment: models that adequately exploit the relation-
ship between sentences would be better at lever-
aging the supervision of our dataset, and could
yield even better sentence representations. In fu-
ture work, we also aim to increase the coverage
of our method. For instance, we can make use of
more lenient patterns that capture an even wider

range of discourse markers, such as multi-word
markerse.
