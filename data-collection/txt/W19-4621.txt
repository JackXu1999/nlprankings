Abstract

Sentiment analysis (SA) is one of the most
useful natural language processing applica-
tions. Literature is flooding with many papers
and systems addressing this task, but most of
the work is focused on English. In this pa-
per, we present “Mazajak”, an online system
for Arabic SA. The system is based on a deep
learning model, which achieves state-of-the-
art results on many Arabic dialect datasets in-
cluding SemEval 2017 and ASTD. The avail-
ability of such system should assist various ap-
plications and research that rely on sentiment
analysis as a tool.

1 Introduction

Sentiment analysis (SA) can be defined as the pro-
cess of extracting and analysing the sentiment and
polarity in a given piece of text (Liu, 2012). It
is one of the tasks in the larger natural language
processing (NLP) field. The rapid and wide in-
crease in the use of social media platforms, and
the reliance on online shopping and marketing re-
sulted in a flood of information. Many researchers
started analysing and mining data for the task of
public opinion mining. Sentiment analysis is one
of the vital approaches to extract public opinion
from large corpora of text. Companies can bene-
fit from understanding the feedback of their cos-
tumers and their opinions. Governments as well
can use it to understand the reaction of people to
their policies and actions.

Work on SA started in early 2000s, particularly
with the work of (Pang et al., 2002), where they
studied the sentiment of movies’ reviews. The
work has developed since then and it spanned
different topics and fields such as social media.
SA gained a lot of interest from researchers who
recognised its importance and benefits. However,
most of the work is focused on English whereas

Arabic did not receive much attention until re-
cently, but it still lacks behind due to the many
challenges of the Arabic language; including the
large variety in dialects (Habash, 2010; Darwish
et al., 2014) and the complex morphology of the
language (Abdul-Mageed et al., 2011).

Recently, the world witnessed a strong revolu-
tion in deep learning which was the driving force
for many improvements in many fields. The work
on English NLP started utilising deep learning
models from an early stage, then followed by Ara-
bic NLP. The utilisation of deep learning for Ara-
bic SA started to receive more attention recently
showing significant improvement in performance
(Dahou et al., 2016; Al-Sallab et al., 2015; Alayba
et al., 2018; Al-Smadi et al., 2018).

While there is a considerable amount of work
that studies Arabic SA (Al-Ayyoub et al., 2019),
to the best of our knowledge, there is no exist-
ing open-source tool for Arabic SA that could be
used directly. The only work that we are aware of
is SentiStrength1 (Thelwall et al., 2010), which is
mainly developed for English, but supports other
languages including Arabic. However, it uses a
basic dictionary-based approach that works with
Arabic MSA and terribly fails with dialects which
is the main language used in social media.

In this paper, we present Mazajak2, an Online
Arabic sentiment analysis system that utilises deep
learning and massive Arabic word embeddings.
The system is available as an online API that can
be used by other researchers.

is based on conventional machine learning algo-
rithms with few attempts to use deep learning.
A recent publication (Al-Ayyoub et al., 2019)
presents a comprehensive survey on Arabic SA.

In (Al-Smadi et al., 2017a), the authors pro-
posed an aspect-based SA system for Arabic ho-
tel reviews, in which they used SVM and recur-
rent neural networks (RNNs). In another work
(Shoeb and Ahmed, 2017), the authors applied
SA on tweets using Naive Bayes (NB) and KNN,
they achieved relatively good results. Al-Ayyoub
et al. (2015) also created a large lexicon of Ara-
bic terms extracted from news articles. Based on
their lexicon, they built an SA system and tested it
on data collected from Twitter. In (Elmasry et al.,
2014), the authors aimed to tackle the problem of
dialects. They built a slang sentimental words and
idioms lexicon (SSWIL) and conducted some ex-
periments using SVM and the new lexicon.

In the realm of social media analysis, the work
in (Abdulla et al., 2013) introduced a dataset of
2000 tweets, which the authors used to conduct an
experiment with lexicon-based and ML-based sys-
tems. They found that combining both approaches
would achieve better results. Abdul-Mageed et al.
(2014) proposed an SA system for social media. In
their work, they experimented and studied a large
variety of features. They also studied the effect
of the dialects and morphological richness of Ara-
bic. Moreover, In (Abdul-Mageed, 2017a,b), the
authors studied the different ways to handle the
Arabic morphological richness for SA. They stud-
ied the effect of segmentation in representing the
lexical input, also they tried to study the weight
and importance of these segments for SA.

In SemEval 2017, a sentiment analysis task was
presented that included Arabic (Rosenthal et al.,
2017). El-Beltagy et al. (2017) were ranked first
in SemEval 2017 task for Arabic SA. They used a
set of hand-engineered and lexicon-based features,
the classifier of choice was a complement NB clas-
sifier. The second rank in the same task was for the
work of Jabreel and Moreno (2017), who intro-
duced a rich set of features that are mostly based
on bag of words (BoW) model in addition to some
features extracted from word embeddings. They
used SVM as their classification algorithm.

Dahou et al. (2016) proposed a set of word em-
beddings to be used for Arabic SA, which was
built using a corpus of 3.4 billion words. They
used a convolutional neural network (CNN) based

system to evaluate their embeddings and the re-
sults were promising. Another use of word em-
beddings was in (Aziz Altowayan and Tao, 2016),
where the authors created their own word embed-
dings and used them as the only features to be
fed to the classifier without any engineered fea-
tures, the results were comparable and slightly bet-
ter than those of other systems.

In (Alayba et al., 2017), the authors presented
their own SA dataset of opinions on health ser-
vices. They built an SA system and it was tested
on the new dataset. Their experiments included
the use of many ML algorithms including CNNs.
Al-Sallab et al. (2015) experimented with differ-
ent deep learning models such as recursive auto-
encoder (RAE), deep belief networks (DBN) and
deep auto-encoder (DAE). They relied on the Ar-
SenL lexicon (Badaro et al., 2014) to build the fea-
ture vectors. In (Al-Smadi et al., 2017b), the au-
thors addressed the aspect-based sentiment analy-
sis (ABSA). In their experiments, they used RNNs
and SVM as classifiers, the results showed that
SVM was superior. Alayba et al. (2018) built
an SA system that is based on a combination of
CNNs and LSTMs. They tested their model on
two datasets, Ar-Twitter and Arabic Health Ser-
vices datasets, where they achieved accuracies
of 88.1% and 94.3% respectively. In (Al-Smadi
et al., 2018), the authors proposed an aspect-based
sentiment analysis system, their model is based on
a Bi-LSTM and conditional random field (CRF).
They tested their model on Arabic hotels’ re-
views dataset, they achieved an F-score of 70%.
Elshakankery and Ahmed (2019) proposed a hy-
brid system for Arabic SA, that utilises lexicon-
based and machine learning based approaches.
In their work, they experimented with multiple
dataset such as ASTD and ArTwitter. They used
different classifiers for the task, which varied
from using conventional machine learning, to deep
learning models.

Among the previous mentioned work, we are
not aware of any released open-source tool for
Arabic SA, which is considered one of the largest
limitations in Arabic NLP. While there are many
Arabic NLP tools for various tasks, including seg-
mentation, POS tagging, and diacritization (Pasha
et al., 2014; Abdelali et al., 2016), the Arabic NLP
research community still lack a tool for sentiment
analysis. In this work, we offer the first open-
source SA tool for Arabic social media .

3 Methodology

This section describes the different components
and steps that are used by our system, Mazajak.

3.1 Data Preprocessing

In general, this step is an initial step that aims to
reduce the inconsistencies and normalise the data
into a coherent form so that it can be handled eas-
ily. The steps are mainly based on the work in
(El-Beltagy et al., 2017). In our implementation,
we used the following steps:
• Letter normalisation: unifying the letters that

appear in different forms. We replace {, �
� , �} with {�}, {­} with {£} and {«} with
{©} (Darwish et al., 2014).
• Elongation removal: removing the repeated

letters which might appear specially in social
media data (Darwish et al., 2012).
• Cleaning: removing unknown characters, di-

acritics, punctuation, URLs, etc.

3.2 Text representation

Sentences are represented as two dimensional ma-
trix where each row represents a word, and each
word is represented by its corresponding embed-
ding. We set the size of the embedding D to 300.
In our work, short sentences are padded to match
the longest sentence in the training set.

Word embeddings were created using the
word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013), the skip-gram ar-
chitecture was used. The embeddings were built
using a corpus of 250M unique Arabic tweets; this
makes it the largest Arabic word embeddings set
when compared to the available AraVec (Soliman
et al., 2017), which is currently the largest set,
built using a corpus of 67M tweets. The tweets
were collected over different time periods between
2013 and 2016 to ensure the coverage of differ-
ent topics. The large and diverse corpus ensures
that many dialects are covered which would help
in reducing the effect of dialectal variation. When
creating the embeddings, the same preprocessing
steps utilised in the SA system were used.

3.3 Model Architecture
The model is built on a CNN followed by an
LSTM. The CNN works as a feature extractor,
where it learns the local patterns inside the sen-
tence and provides representative features. The
LSTM works on the extracted features where the
context and word ordering would be taken into
consideration. The model has been designed after
extensive comparison to existing models in litera-
ture, and has been shown to be the most effective
one among the state-of-the-art models, as demon-
strated in next section. Figure 1 shows the archi-
tecture, the embeddings are fed into the CNN, af-
ter that they are fed to a max-pooling layer, the
reason behind using max pooling is to have the
most important features which conforms with the
fact that sentiment is usually expressed in spe-
cific words. The extracted features are fed into
an LSTM which is followed by a softmax layer
that would give a probability distribution over the
output classes. The hyper-parameters used in our
architecture is shown in Table 1.

4 Model Performance

4.1 Experimental Setup
To examine the effectiveness of our model before
offering it online for public use, we tested the
model on three different datasets. The first is Se-
mEval 2017 task 4-A benchmark dataset (Rosen-
thal et al., 2017), which consists of 6,100 test-
ing tweets and 3,555 training ones. All tweets
are labelled to one of three classes: positive, neg-
ative or neutral. The second dataset is ASTD
benchmark dataset (Nabil et al., 2015), which con-

sists of 10,006 tweets, 6,691 of them are objective
which means that they are not useful for SA. The
rest are divided over three sentiment classes. The
third dataset is ArSAS (Elmadany et al., 2018), the
largest available dataset for Arabic SA which con-
sists over 21K tweets labelled over four sentiment
classes: positive, negative, neutral, and mixed.
The mixed class has the smallest number of sam-
ples, thus we decided to ignore it. In addition, Ar-
SAS has a confidence value for each label. We de-
cided to keep only the tweets with confidence level
over 50% and ignore the rest. After this step, we
end up with 17,784 tweets in the ArSAS dataset
labelled with three sentiment labels. Both ASTD
and ArSAS datasets have no specific splitting of
the data to test and train; thus, we applied ran-
dom sampling to split both datasets to 80/20% for
train/test respectively.

4.2 Baselines and Evaluation
To ensure having Mazajak achieving state-of-the-
art performance, we compared its effectiveness to
the existing best reported performance on each of
the three datasets. For evaluation, we followed
the same methodology adopted by SemEval 2017
task which uses average recall, FPN and accuracy.
FPN is the macro-average F-score over the posi-
tive and negative classes only while neglecting the
neutral class (Rosenthal et al., 2017). The best per-
forming system in the SemEval 2017 task is the
one described in (El-Beltagy et al., 2017) which
achieved an FPN of 0.61. For the ASTD, the best
reported results are by (Heikal et al., 2018) who
used an ensemble system combining output of
CNN and Bi-LSTM architectures, which achieved
an FPN of 0.71. These two systems are used as
our baselines. For the ArSAS dataset, we are not
aware of any reported results on it yet.

4.3 Classification Performance
Table 2 reports the classification results of our sys-
tem Mazajak and compares it to the state-of-the-

art systems for the three benchmark datasets. As
shown in the table, Mazajak model outperformed
the current state-of-the-art models on the SemEval
and ASTD datasets. In addition, it achieved a
high performance on the ArSAS dataset. Our re-
ported scores are higher than current top systems
for all the evaluation scores, including average re-
call, FPN , and accuracy. These results confirm
that our model choice for our tool represents the
current state-of-the-art for Arabic SA.

5 Mazajak Online API

Our Arabic SA model is deployed as an online
system, Mazajak3, and can be accessed online at
“Mazajak.inf.ed.ac.uk:8000”.

The final model hosted online is trained on the
SemEval and ASTD dataset combined4.

Our online tool provides four modes of opera-
tion as follows:
• Text Input: where the user can input any

piece of text into a text-box, and the system
will display the polarity of the sentiment in
the text. This mode allows the user to give

3the word “Mazajak” (��z), is an Arabic word which
means “your mood”.

4this is different from the experimentation above when we
were comparing the system to state-of-the-art.

feedback on the output sentiment using the
form shown in Figure 2. This, in turn, would
help to continuously collect more training
data. The collected data is used periodically
to update our model to improve the system
performance.
• Batch Mode: where the user provides a file

with multiple lines of text, and the system re-
turns back an output file with the correspond-
ing sentiment to each line in the input file.
• Timeline mode: where the user provides a

Twitter account name, and the system will
analyse the sentiment of the tweets in the ac-
count’s timeline. The output is a graph show-
ing the number of the tweets of each of the
classes over time and an overall ratio of the
percentages of the tweets corresponding to
each class as shown in Figure 3.
• Online API: where an API could be down-

loaded to help other research that utilises sen-
timent analysis. The API provides two func-
tions, either getting the sentiment of a sen-
tence or a list of sentences. The API func-
tions are provided in Python, but with a few
lines of coding it can be accessed using other
programming languages.

Table 3 shows some examples of classified
tweets using the tool, these examples show that the
model can handle the dialectal variations.

Our online system would be updated periodi-
cally with new training data and potentially better
preforming models. We aim that Mazajak would
serve the research community in analysing senti-
ment in Arabic text in a simple way, which, as we
hope, would further promote the research in Ara-
bic language.

6 Conclusion

In this paper, we presented Mazajak, the first on-
line Arabic sentiment analysis tool. The system

utilises the advancements in the NLP and deep
learning fields. The model, on which the system
relies, achieves state-of-the-art results on three of
the benchmark datasets for Arabic SA including
SemEval 2017 task, ASTD and ArSAS. The sys-
tem is available as an online API that can be ac-
cessed easily, which would help and ease the work
of other researchers in applications that make use
of sentiment information.

Mazajak is offered for free use for research pur-
poses. For commercial usage, please contact the
authors.

In the future, we hope to improve the model
so it would achieve better results. Also, we look
forward to add more features such as the abil-
ity to handle Arabizi –Arabic written in English
alphabet– and emojis.
