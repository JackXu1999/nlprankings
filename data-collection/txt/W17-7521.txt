Abstract 
The multilingual multidirectional dictionary 

gives the linguistic equivalent across the 

languages. In order to build such a dictionary 

in electronic form poses considerable 

challenges to the lexicographer and the 

dictionary architect. One of the major 

challenges is linking lexical ambiguity across 

languages. This paper intends to address that 

issue along with many other challenges 

involved in creating such a multilingual and 

multidirectional dictionary. 

 

1 Introduction: 
Dictionaries are compiled with a view to provide 
lexical and semantic information from thousands 

of years. Electronic/digital dictionary does the 

same by replacing the format of the traditional 

printed dictionaries. An electronic dictionary, 

though primarily designed to provide basic 

information such as grammatical category, 

meaning, usage etc. as the paper dictionaries, 

they can also provide additional information like 

pronunciation, motion pictures through 

multimedia which paper dictionaries cannot.   

The expression Electronic dictionary gained 

momentum in the last quarter of the 20
th
 century 

as a term for a specialized device - a handheld 
computer dedicated to storing a lexical database 

and performing lookup in it. Classical 

lexicography demands a complex relationship 

with linguistic theory. So is electronic 

lexicography with computational linguistics. 

Electronic dictionaries are a product of this 

association and they also serve as tools and 
feedstock for creating other products. An 

electronic bilingual or multilingual dictionary 

may be a digitized edition of a conventional 

reference work perhaps augmented by types of 

information specific of this medium (recorded 

pronunciations, hyperlinks, full text search etc.). 

Alternatively, it may be a system of monolingual 

dictionaries of different languages interlinked at 

the level of entries. [Ivan A Derhanski 2009] 

If the construction of the multilingual 

electronic dictionary is not just a collection of 

digitized versions of printed dictionaries but to 
offer facilities like multidirectional search, 

extracting mono-lingual, bi-lingual, tri-lingual 

dictionaries, root lexicons and even provide 

backend support for translation systems then 

designing such a dictionary database throws 

practical challenges. Especially when such 

database accommodates multiple languages at 
one go and provides options for multidirectional 

search. That means word of any language as 

source can be sought in one or more target 

languages catered by the dictionary system.  

The creation of a multilingual dictionary 

database concerns itself with the source of 

information used for constructing them. Most of 

such endeavors primarily rely on printed 

dictionaries or machine readable versions of the 

same.  Currently we have the advantage of 

electronic corpora which has been built for many 

Indian Languages over the past decade.  

Polysemy is seldom a serious problem in 

human communication. Lexicographers have 

traditionally been concerned with the best way to 

account for the fact that one word can carry 

several different meanings (Leacock C. and 

Ravin 2000).  Over time, lexicographic 

procedures have been established that have 

resulted in the listing of multiple dictionary 

senses for polysemous words where sub-senses 

are grouped together with their respective 

definitions (Henri Béjoint 2000).  

This paper addresses how the concepts 

described in a lingua-franca provides a basis for 

conducting cross-linguistic research there by 
facilitating the creation of multilingual 

dictionary capable of overcoming a number of 

important linguistic problems.  

165



The lexical under-specifications and lexical 

ambiguity are among the major problems. 

Sometimes one leads to the other. Lexical 

ambiguity is one of the issues that a 

lexicographer and the dictionary architect have 
to face. This paper describes the observations 

that a lexicographer encounters while handling 

prototype of ‘concept-set-model’ architecture.  

 

2 Review of literature:  
When we took up the task of building 

multilingual, multidirectional dictionary for 

Indian languages, we researched few previous 

initiatives. The Universidad Politécnica de 

Madrid’s School of Computing have developed a 

system for building multilingual dictionaries 

based on multiple term equivalences known as 

universal words. The system is based on 

Princeton University’s WordNet database. 

WordNet is a lexical database developed by 

linguists at Princeton’s Cognitive Science 

Laboratory. The database was designed to 

inventory, classify and relate the semantic and 

lexical content of the English language. The 
system’s other mainstay are universal words. 

The concept of universal word came out of the 

UNL (Universal Networking Language) Project. 

The aim of this project is to eliminate the 

barriers of linguistic diversity by creating a 

medium of information exchange through which 

users can communicate in their own language. 

Similar attempts were done in PanLex Project 

that aims to help one to express any lexical 

concept in any language. The endeavor like 

BabelNet, which is developed with lexicographic 

and encyclopedic coverage of terms, is a 

semantic network which connects concepts and 

named entities in a very large network of 

semantic relations, called Babel synsets. Each 

Babel synset represents a given meaning and 

contains all the synonyms which express that 

meaning in a range of different languages.  

 

3 Our Approach:  
Since our objective is narrow and is to make a 

corpus based dictionary of Indian languages and 

not of a semantic net. The paper is about 

dictionary only. To make a multilingual 

multidirectional digital dictionary the approach 

of word to word linking across languages is not 

practically feasible. Some concepts may never 

have a word for it because the concept itself 

could be alien to the language culture. For 

example, there cannot be an equivalent word for 

Kannada ‘mud̪d̪e’. mud̪d̪e is a kind of edible ball 
prepared by cooking millet powder used majorly 

in southern part of Karnataka. So does for ‘tulip’ 
flower in Telugu. Since the tulip flower is not 

native to the culture of the Telugu speaking land.  
In traditional dictionaries, such cases are dealt 

with by describing source language word in 

target language.  

Word from language ‘A’ may have more than 

one meaning which gets connected to a word in 

language ‘B’ which may not share all the 

meanings of the language ‘A’. Sometimes it may 

have other meanings too which language ‘A’ 

word may not have. 

Fixing a language as source and other 

languages as target may bring only the concepts 

of the source language culture and omits all 

possible concepts that other languages may have. 

A dictionary database based on such limited 

concepts offers limited descriptions to the end-

user, primarily if the end user is searching 

between two languages which are only target 

languages in the database architecture. Making a 

universal word-set is a good start but it will 

eventually lack the language specific or region 
specific concepts in the multilingual 

multidirectional dictionary.  

Words borrowed from same origin like Proto-

Dravidian or Sanskrit to two different languages 

may not carry the same concept with them. So it 

is evident that word to word linking across 

languages is not a feasible solution even at the 
stage of polysemy or borrowed words like 

tatsamas. Thus we have to lean back to the basic 
principles of linguistics where it is the concept 

that exists as the fact and we label it differently 

in different languages.  

As the Vedic hymn say “Ékam sáth víprā 
bahudhā́ vadanti”. (The fact exists and the 
learned one call it by different names -Rigveda) 
The world existed before any language came 

into existence. When languages evolved with its 

vocabulary its primary job was to label the 

things and actions.  Those words later fell into 

different grammatical categories like noun, verb, 

adjective, adverb etc.  

According to Ferdinand de Saussure the 

signified is the concept, the meaning, the thing 

indicated by the signifier (Language). It need not 

be a 'real object' but is some referent to which 

the signifier refers. The language is built around 

the concepts that exist in environment.    
Let us consider the concept ‘leaf” and its 

description as ‘The main organ of photosynthesis 

and transpiration in higher plants’1. This 

166



concept-set idea of leaf in four Dravidian 

languages Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, and 

Kannada is as follows.  

 

 

In Terminology, terms i.e. the “verbal 

definition of a concept” need to be separated 

from concept names since they belong to two 

different semiotic systems. The first is a 

linguistic system while the second is conceptual. 

Similarly, term definitions written in natural 

language need to be separated from concept 

definitions written in a formal language. The 

former are viewed as linguistic explanations 

while the latter are considered logical 

specifications of concept. The result is a new 

kind of terminology called onto terminology  

(Christophe Roche, Marie Calberg-Challot, Luc 

Damas, Philippe Rouard 2009) 

On the similar lines of onto terminology we 

build our concept set which is a basic data unit 
for a lexical entry. A concept set is a set which 

has a concept described in Lingua-franca along 

with its associated sense in connected languages 

which in turn connected to related words in 

Indian languages catered by the dictionary.   

Our typical concept set looks as follows. 

 

 
The 'concept-set-model' i.e. a Lexical item is 

entered along with its synonyms and semantic 

meaning linked with ‘concept’ (descriptive 

meaning in lingua-franca) into the database. We 

have chosen English as lingua-franca with its 

probable word if exists in English. Based on the 
concept the process is iterated in other 

languages. In other words, we are following 

indexation of ‘concept’. Here word is terminal or 

leaf end of the linkage and not like a node of a 

semantic network model. 

In Central Institute of Indian Languages 

(CIIL) the concept-set model based dictionary 

architecture was built in 2010 (Rajesha N, 

Ramya M and Samar Sinha 2011). We have the 

advantage of electronic corpora which was built 

in house for many Indian Languages over the 

past decade by CIIL. We thought of using the 

same to enrich our dictionary named ‘vāgartha’ 
(word and sense) that we are building in-house. 

  
Since we are following the concept which is 

the fact that exists, rather than any words to 

connect with, the challenge of choosing a fixed 

primary language is also eliminated. For the 

purpose of management and to avoid confusions, 
the method of entering the new concepts into the 

dictionary restricts to one language at a given 

point of time. Such language will be called as 

Primary Language. All other languages will add 

the entries and other respective fields in their 

language in correspondence with the concepts 

given by the Primary Language. After a fixed 

period a different language will become the 

Primary language so that the dictionary should 

not miss any concepts which could be a cultural 

specific item of a language community/region. 

We devised a system where the concept is fixed 

and the words act as labels attached to the 
concepts. The concept and the primary language 

word associated with it, is shown to the

connecting lexicographer. The system gives a 

facility to transliterate the primary language 

word if it would be of any help to the 

lexicographer.   

 

4 Observations: 
Looking beyond the well-known issues 

surrounding the treatment of polysemy in a 

single language we find even greater problems 

when it comes to accounting for polysemy 

across languages. Overcoming these problems is 

not only important for the design of traditional 

lexicons but also crucial for the successful 

implementation Multilingual Lexical Databases. 

(Hans Christian Boas 2009) 

Polysemy can pose problems in intra-lingual 

and inter-lingual linkages. 

 

4.1 Lexical Ambiguity in a language  
In Intra-lingual linking the Lexical Ambiguity 

words that are not even remotely connected in 
conceptual sense bring ambiguity to the user. For 

example the Malayalam word ‘ʋaɽʃam’ has two 
senses as following. 

1. ‘Year- A period of time containing 365 (or 
366) days’

1
  

2. ‘Rain- Water falling in drops from vapour 
condensed in the atmosphere’1.  

 
The Dictionary database architect has to 

arrange the data without any redundancy in 

relational database. So the single lexical entry of 

the word has to be connected with two or more 

senses here. None of them is a sub-sense of the 

other.   

An end user search of database for Malayalam 

word ‘aːɳʈə’ should fetch the description as well 
as the synonyms of ‘aːɳʈə’; in such a case it will 
obviously fetch ‘ʋaɽʃam’. But because the 
‘ʋaɽʃam’ is connected with other words (like 
‘maɻa’) in the sense of ‘Rain’, database should 
not render ‘maɻa’ for ‘aːɳʈə’. 

 

Tautologous: The organization of data should 
follow the guideline. i.e., words should be 

interlinked with all other synonyms and the 

concept to which it is related. While writing 

dictionary definitions many lexicographers 

follow precise guidelines on how to define a 

word.   

In spite of this we find definitions like  

Luncher — ‘Someone who is eating lunch’1  

Magnetism — ‘The branch of science that 

studies magnetism’1  

These definitions are logically sound and 

literally true but they are also tautologous.  They 

use the same words or roots in the definition as 

are found in the headword. The lexicographer 

has to understand that the architecture of the 
database will be such that the definitions are not 

only for the headword but to all the synonyms to 

which the sense is connected. All these 

synonyms are also headword candidates and part 

of lexicon of that language.  So none of those 

words should be used in definition which leading 

to tautologous entries. 

 

4.2 Lexical Ambiguity across language 
In practical scenario we observed four different 

types of cross linguistic patterns and two 

potentially confusing patterns. The following 

table gives a description of these observations in 

the multilingual database. 

Patterns Description 

A = A 
Complete overlapping of word 

senses  

A ≠ A 
No overlapping of word senses 
even if words belongs to the same 

origin or word conceptualization 

A1 = A1  

A2 ≠ A2 

Semi overlapping of word senses. 

The word may be having more 

than one sense in a language-duo 

of which one is common across 

language but the other senses 

may not.  

A1 = A1 

A2 = Null 

Lexical under specification 

leading to lexical ambiguity.  

The word has a meaning in one 

language similar to the other. In 

addition to that the same word 

has a specialized sense in the 

prior which is absent in the later.  

A ≠ A  
   ↙↙↙↙ 

B ≠ B 

Semi cross lexical ambiguity is 

an extension of no overlapping 

pattern where a pair of words 

exists in a language-duo and one 

of the word in the pair connect 

with the one which are not their 

replica  

A ≠ A 
  ⤩⤩⤩⤩ 
B ≠ B 

Full Cross lexical ambiguity is an 

extension of no overlapping 

pattern where a pair of words 
exist in a language-duo but both 

of the words connect with the 

ones which are not their replicas  

Table: 1 Cross Linguistic Patterns

4.2.1 Complete overlapping: 
The complete overlap of word senses; we find 

"Overlapping polysemy" which refers to cases in 

which items in two languages have exactly the 

same meanings. In Indian language scenario, 

normally some words have same origin like 
proto-Dravidian or Sanskrit bor

different languages.  

Let us consider an example of overlapping 

polysemy among Malayalam ‘aʈi
‘aʈi’. The word carries four senses as follows:

1. To Beat (Verb) 
2. The part of the leg of a human

the ankle joint (Noun) 

3. The lower part of anything (Noun)

4. A linear unit of length equal to 12 inches or 

a third of a yard (Quantifier)
1
  

 
We can observe the varying degrees of 

polysemy exhibited by them and come to the 

conclusion that the four senses exhibit "Almost 

complete" overlapping polysemy patterns. 

Overlapping polysemy poses no problems for 

multilingual dictionaries.  
 

4.2.2 No Overlapping: 
In contrast to the above we observe common 

phenomena that the word borrowed from the 

same source into two different languages may 

have diverging structure. For example ‘
in Kannada and Malayalam exhibit semantic 

overlap when it comes to the basic sense 

‘indication of something, highlighting, marking 

something’. However they differ widely in their 

meaning extensions when it comes to more 

narrowed senses over time. In Kannada 

‘laːɲʧana’ widely used to describe ‘Emblem 
visible symbol representing an abstract idea’

This concept is not carried in Malayalam. But it 

is carried as ‘Indication - Something that serves 

to indicate or suggest’ The Kannada ‘

cannot be equated with Malayalam ‘

anymore. No overlapping poses an issue to the 
lexicographer, so that simply looking into the 

word and not the sense will not help while 

connecting words.  

 

4.2.3 Semi Overlapping: 
We came across situations in which a word may 

be having more than one sense in a language

of which one is common across language but the 

other senses may not. For example both 

Malayalam and Tamil have the word ‘

it is used in two senses in both languages. Only

anymore. No overlapping poses an issue to the

We came across situations in which a word may 

be having more than one sense in a language-duo 

of which one is common across language but the 

other senses may not. For example both 

Malayalam and Tamil have the word ‘kat̪t̪i’ and 

in both languages. Only 

one sense is a shared meaning and the other 

sense is not mutually related. Both words share 

the meaning ‘Knife - A weapon with a handle 
and blade with a sharp point’1.  

Malayalam ‘kat̪t̪i’ has a sense ‘

Destroyed or badly damaged by fire

Tamil ‘kat̪t̪i’ has a sense ‘Loudly 

relatively high volume’.
1
 Simply because these 

two words are sounds similar and connected in 

one sense, database architecture should not allow 

the sense of ‘Burnt’ to get linked with ‘Loudl

Concept-set-model will take care of it since the 

words are connected to concepts rather than 

words. But lexicographer has to be cautious not 

to jump into conclusions by just looking at the 

transliterated word that is offered to assist. 

 

4.2.4 Lexical under specification leading 

to lexical ambiguity: 
The fourth type of cross-linguistic phenomenon 

posing problem for the lexicographer is, cases in 

which there are no clear equivalents in the target 

languages. The word has a meaning in one 

language similar to the other. In addition to that 

the same word has a specialized sense in the 

prior which is absent in the later, these cases 

may lead to zero translations. When the word is 

outside the culture of the target language and has 

to be linked, usually lexicographer chooses to 

borrow the word from source by transliterating 
the word, (like English word ‘tulip’ is ‘

Kannada, as it describes a particular flower.) But 

in this case lexicographer cannot borrow the 

word as foreign word for the sake of dictiona

entry since it leads to polysemy.   

 

Let’s have a look on such a case

sense is not mutually related. Both words share

169



 ‘rasaːjana’ of Kannada and ‘rasaːjana’ of 
Bangla exhibit semantic overlap when it comes 

to the basic senses describing mixture of two or 

more elements. It is mainly used for the sense 

‘Chemical - Material produced by or used in a 
reaction involving changes in atoms or 

molecules’1 in both languages.  However they 

differ widely in their meaning extensions when it 

comes to more specialized sense. The Kannada 

‘rasaːjana’ is used to describe ‘Ambrosia- Fruit 
dessert made of bananas and other fruits with 

shredded coconut’
1
.  This concept is not carried 

in Bangla. To give equivalent, the Lexicographer 

cannot borrow it easily since it leads to creating 

confusion because it is not familiar with the 

language culture. In such cases lexicographer 

can just describe the concept in Bangla to 

convey the meaning to the user. Creating or 

borrowing a word leads to other complications 

like social acceptance of something which is not 

at all part of culture. 

In spite of its complexity to find proper 

equivalents for difficult lexical items across, 

linguistically it is necessary to account for them 

within the Database. Without their inclusion, 
neither humans nor machine will be able to 

successfully use the database for translation 

purposes.  

 

4.2.5 Semi Co-lexical pattern 
Even though a concept is not a lexical ambiguity 

we observed a potentially confusing pattern for a 

lexicographer. This is an extension of no 

overlapping pattern where a pair of words exist 

in a language-duo and one of the word in the pair 

connect with the one which are not their replica  

For example ‘upanjaːsa’and ‘kaːd̪ambari’ are 
part of vocabulary of Kannada and Hindi. Both 

words have Sanskrit origin.  

Kannada ‘upanjaːsa’ is ‘Lecture - A speech 
that is open to the public’

1
.   

Hindi ‘upanjaːsa’ is, ‘Novel - an extended 
fictional work in prose; usually in the form of a 

story’1.  

In Kannada ‘kaːd̪ambari’ is ‘Novel’ and in 
Hindi ‘kaːd̪ambari’ is ‘Cluster-of-Clouds’2.  
Both words are present in both languages. But 

one of the words is having the meaning of the 
other but the other words are nowhere 

associated. Lexicographer should not take these 

words lightly and connect as per their 

understanding of the word in their language.  

  

The Lexicographer has to take care of the 

context which appears with the word before 

connecting it into a sense in their language. Mere 

identifying the word in their own language will 

not help them anyway.  
 

4.2.6 Full Co-lexical pattern 
This is an extension of no overlapping pattern 

where a pair of words exists in a language-duo, 

having same origin but both of the words 

connect with the ones which are not their 

replicas. It is also a potentially confusing pattern 

for a lexicographer. 

For example, the words ‘samɕoːd̪ʰana’ and 
‘anusand̪ʰaːna’ is present in both Kannada and 
Hindi. Both words are having Sanskrit origin. 

Kannada ‘samɕoːd̪ʰana’ carries the sense 
‘Research - Systematic investigation to establish 

facts’
1
. In Hindi ‘anusand̪ʰaːna’ is the word for 

the same sense. 

One of the senses that Kannada 

‘anusand̪ʰaːna’ carries is ‘Modification- The act 
of making something different in order to 

achieve desired format’1.  And in Hindi, word 

‘samɕoːd̪ʰana’ goes with the sense. The word has 
other senses like ‘examine’, ‘union’ etc in 

Kannada. 

In this case since both words are part of both 
the languages vocabulary so the lexicographer 

has to take extra care to look into the context 

while connecting. Simply looking into the 

transliteration form offered by the interface to 

facilitate the lexicographer will not help and may 

cause wrong connections.  
 

Conclusion: 
As per our observations every word is a new 

word for the lexicographer. A lexicographer has 

to take appropriate measures not to get mistaken 

by looking at the source language word. We 

mentioned our efforts to ensure appropriate 
management of the multilingual and 

multidirectional dictionary project. Once 

developed, such a dictionary provides a vital 

resource for cross lingual lexicographers and 

programmers. At present the data building with 

the approach of concept set modeling is being 

carried out. Once the substantial data is entered 
many more complexities and linking issues may 

be created. Probable solutions for the same are to 

be researched accordingly.
