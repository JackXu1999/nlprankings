Abstract

Traditional approaches to extractive
summarization rely heavily on human-
engineered features. In this work we
propose a data-driven approach based on
neural networks and continuous sentence
features. We develop a general frame-
work for single-document summarization
composed of a hierarchical document
encoder and an attention-based extractor.
This architecture allows us to develop
different classes of summarization models
which can extract sentences or words. We
train our models on large scale corpora
containing hundreds of thousands of
document-summary pairs1. Experimental
results on two summarization datasets
demonstrate that our models obtain results
comparable to the state of the art without
any access to linguistic annotation.

1 Introduction

The need to access and digest large amounts of
textual data has provided strong impetus to de-
velop automatic summarization systems aiming to
create shorter versions of one or more documents,
whilst preserving their information content. Much
effort in automatic summarization has been de-
voted to sentence extraction, where a summary is
created by identifying and subsequently concate-
nating the most salient text units in a document.

Most extractive methods to date identify
sentences based on human-engineered features.
These include surface features such as sentence
position and length (Radev et al., 2004), the words
in the title, the presence of proper nouns, content
features such as word frequency (Nenkova et al.,
2006), and event features such as action nouns (Fi-
latova and Hatzivassiloglou, 2004). Sentences are

typically assigned a score indicating the strength
of presence of these features. Several methods
have been used in order to select the summary sen-
tences ranging from binary classifiers (Kupiec et
al., 1995), to hidden Markov models (Conroy and
O’Leary, 2001), graph-based algorithms (Erkan
and Radev, 2004; Mihalcea, 2005), and integer lin-
ear programming (Woodsend and Lapata, 2010).

In this work we propose a data-driven approach
to summarization based on neural networks and
continuous sentence features. There has been a
surge of interest recently in repurposing sequence
transduction neural network architectures for NLP
tasks such as machine translation (Sutskever et
al., 2014), question answering (Hermann et al.,
2015), and sentence compression (Rush et al.,
2015). Central to these approaches is an encoder-
decoder architecture modeled by recurrent neu-
ral networks. The encoder reads the source se-
quence into a list of continuous-space representa-
tions from which the decoder generates the target
sequence. An attention mechanism (Bahdanau et
al., 2015) is often used to locate the region of focus
during decoding.

We develop a general framework for single-
document summarization which can be used to
extract sentences or words. Our model includes
a neural network-based hierarchical document
reader or encoder and an attention-based content
extractor. The role of the reader is to derive the
meaning representation of a document based on its
sentences and their constituent words. Our models
adopt a variant of neural attention to extract sen-
tences or words. Contrary to previous work where
attention is an intermediate step used to blend hid-
den units of an encoder to a vector propagating ad-
ditional information to the decoder, our model ap-
plies attention directly to select sentences or words
of the input document as the output summary.
Similar neural attention architectures have been
previously used for geometry reasoning (Vinyals
et al., 2015), under the name Pointer Networks.

One stumbling block to applying neural net-
work models to extractive summarization is the
lack of training data, i.e., documents with sen-
tences (and words) labeled as summary-worthy.
Inspired by previous work on summarization
(Woodsend and Lapata, 2010; Svore et al., 2007)
and reading comprehension (Hermann et al.,
2015) we retrieve hundreds of thousands of news
articles and corresponding highlights from the
DailyMail website. Highlights usually appear as
bullet points giving a brief overview of the infor-
mation contained in the article (see Figure 1 for
an example). Using a number of transformation
and scoring algorithms, we are able to match high-
lights to document content and construct two large
scale training datasets, one for sentence extraction
and the other for word extraction. Previous ap-
proaches have used small scale training data in the
range of a few hundred examples.

Our work touches on several strands of research
within summarization and neural sequence model-
ing. The idea of creating a summary by extracting
words from the source document was pioneered in
Banko et al. (2000) who view summarization as a
problem analogous to statistical machine transla-
tion and generate headlines using statistical mod-
els for selecting and ordering the summary words.
Our word-based model is similar in spirit, how-
ever, it operates over continuous representations,
produces multi-sentence output, and jointly se-
lects summary words and organizes them into sen-
tences. A few recent studies (Kobayashi et al.,
2015; Yogatama et al., 2015) perform sentence ex-
traction based on pre-trained sentence embeddings
following an unsupervised optimization paradigm.
Our work also uses continuous representations to
express the meaning of sentences and documents,
but importantly employs neural networks more di-
rectly to perform the actual summarization task.

Rush et al. (2015) propose a neural attention
model for abstractive sentence compression which
is trained on pairs of headlines and first sentences
in an article. In contrast, our model summarizes
documents rather than individual sentences, pro-
ducing multi-sentential discourse. A major archi-
tectural difference is that our decoder selects out-
put symbols from the document of interest rather
than the entire vocabulary. This effectively helps
us sidestep the difficulty of searching for the next
output symbol under a large vocabulary, with low-
frequency words and named entities whose rep-

resentations can be challenging to learn. Gu et
al. (2016) and Gulcehre et al. (2016) propose a
similar “copy” mechanism in sentence compres-
sion and other tasks; their model can accommo-
date both generation and extraction by selecting
which sub-sequences in the input sequence to copy
in the output.

We evaluate our models both automatically (in
terms of ROUGE) and by humans on two datasets:
the benchmark DUC 2002 document summariza-
tion corpus and our own DailyMail news high-
lights corpus. Experimental results show that
our summarizers achieve performance compara-
ble to state-of-the-art systems employing hand-
engineered features and sophisticated linguistic
constraints.

2 Problem Formulation

In this section we formally define the summariza-
tion tasks considered in this paper. Given a doc-
ument D consisting of a sequence of sentences
{s1, · · · ,sm} and a word set {w1, · · · ,wn}, we are
interested in obtaining summaries at two levels of
granularity, namely sentences and words.

Sentence extraction aims to create a sum-
mary from D by selecting a subset of j sentences
(where j < m). We do this by scoring each sen-
tence within D and predicting a label yL ∈ {0,1}
indicating whether the sentence should be in-
cluded in the summary. As we apply supervised
training, the objective is to maximize the likeli-
hood of all sentence labels yL = (y1L, · · · ,ymL ) given
the input document D and model parameters θ:

log p(yL|D;θ) =
m

∑
i=1

log p(yiL|D;θ) (1)

Although extractive methods yield naturally
grammatical summaries and require relatively
little linguistic analysis, the selected sentences
make for long summaries containing much redun-
dant information. For this reason, we also de-
velop a model based on word extraction which
seeks to find a subset of words2 in D and
their optimal ordering so as to form a summary
ys = (w′1, · · · ,w′k),w′i ∈ D. Compared to sentence
extraction which is a sequence labeling problem,
this task occupies the middle ground between
full abstractive summarization which can exhibit
a wide range of rewrite operations and extractive

2The vocabulary can also be extended to include a small
set of commonly-used (high-frequency) words.

late word extraction as a language generation task
with an output vocabulary restricted to the original
document. In our supervised setting, the training
goal is to maximize the likelihood of the generated
sentences, which can be further decomposed by
enforcing conditional dependencies among their
constituent words:

In the following section, we discuss the data elici-
tation methods which allow us to train neural net-
works based on the above defined objectives.

3 Training Data for Summarization

Data-driven neural summarization models require
a large training corpus of documents with labels
indicating which sentences (or words) should be
in the summary. Until now such corpora have
been limited to hundreds of examples (e.g., the
DUC 2002 single document summarization cor-
pus) and thus used mostly for testing (Woodsend
and Lapata, 2010). To overcome the paucity of
annotated data for training, we adopt a methodol-
ogy similar to Hermann et al. (2015) and create
two large-scale datasets, one for sentence extrac-
tion and another one for word extraction.

In a nutshell, we retrieved3 hundreds of thou-
sands of news articles and their corresponding
highlights from DailyMail (see Figure 1 for an ex-
ample). The highlights (created by news editors)

3The script for constructing our datasets is modified from
the one released in Hermann et al. (2015).

are genuinely abstractive summaries and therefore
not readily suited to supervised training. To cre-
ate the training data for sentence extraction, we
reverse approximated the gold standard label of
each document sentence given the summary based
on their semantic correspondence (Woodsend and
Lapata, 2010). Specifically, we designed a rule-
based system that determines whether a document
sentence matches a highlight and should be la-
beled with 1 (must be in the summary), and 0 oth-
erwise. The rules take into account the position
of the sentence in the document, the unigram and
bigram overlap between document sentences and
highlights, the number of entities appearing in the
highlight and in the document sentence. We ad-
justed the weights of the rules on 9,000 documents
with manual sentence labels created by Woodsend
and Lapata (2010). The method obtained an accu-
racy of 85% when evaluated on a held-out set of
216 documents coming from the same dataset and
was subsequently used to label 200K documents.
Approximately 30% of the sentences in each doc-
ument were deemed summary-worthy.

For the creation of the word extraction dataset,
we examine the lexical overlap between the high-
lights and the news article. In cases where all high-
light words (after stemming) come from the orig-
inal document, the document-highlight pair con-
stitutes a valid training example and is added to
the word extraction dataset. For out-of-vocabulary
(OOV) words, we try to find a semantically equiv-
alent replacement present in the news article.
Specifically, we check if a neighbor, represented

486



by pre-trained4 embeddings, is in the original doc-
ument and therefore constitutes a valid substitu-
tion. If we cannot find any substitutes, we discard
the document-highlight pair. Following this pro-
cedure, we obtained a word extraction dataset con-
taining 170K articles, again from the DailyMail.

4 Neural Summarization Model

The key components of our summarization model
include a neural network-based hierarchical doc-
ument reader and an attention-based hierarchical
content extractor. The hierarchical nature of our
model reflects the intuition that documents are
generated compositionally from words, sentences,
paragraphs, or even larger units. We therefore em-
ploy a representation framework which reflects the
same architecture, with global information being
discovered and local information being preserved.
Such a representation yields minimum informa-
tion loss and is flexible allowing us to apply neural
attention for selecting salient sentences and words
within a larger context. In the following, we first
describe the document reader, and then present the
details of our sentence and word extractors.

4.1 Document Reader
The role of the reader is to derive the meaning rep-
resentation of the document from its constituent
sentences, each of which is treated as a sequence
of words. We first obtain representation vectors
at the sentence level using a single-layer convo-
lutional neural network (CNN) with a max-over-
time pooling operation (Kalchbrenner and Blun-
som, 2013; Zhang and Lapata, 2014; Kim et al.,
2016). Next, we build representations for docu-
ments using a standard recurrent neural network
(RNN) that recursively composes sentences. The
CNN operates at the word level, leading to the
acquisition of sentence-level representations that
are then used as inputs to the RNN that acquires
document-level representations, in a hierarchical
fashion. We describe these two sub-components
of the text reader below.

Convolutional Sentence Encoder We opted for
a convolutional neural network model for repre-
senting sentences for two reasons. Firstly, single-
layer CNNs can be trained effectively (without
any long-term dependencies in the model) and
secondly, they have been successfully used for

4We used the Python Gensim library and the
300-dimensional GoogleNews vectors.

sentence-level classification tasks such as senti-
ment analysis (Kim, 2014). Let d denote the
dimension of word embeddings, and s a docu-
ment sentence consisting of a sequence of n words
(w1, · · · ,wn) which can be represented by a dense
column matrix W ∈ Rn×d . We apply a tempo-
ral narrow convolution between W and a kernel
K ∈ Rc×d of width c as follows:

fij = tanh(W j: j+c−1⊗K+b) (3)
where ⊗ equates to the Hadamard Product fol-
lowed by a sum over all elements. fij denotes the
j-th element of the i-th feature map fi and b is the
bias. We perform max pooling over time to obtain
a single feature (the ith feature) representing the
sentence under the kernel K with width c:

si,K = max
j

fij (4)

In practice, we use multiple feature maps to
compute a list of features that match the dimen-
sionality of a sentence under each kernel width. In
addition, we apply multiple kernels with different
widths to obtain a set of different sentence vectors.
Finally, we sum these sentence vectors to obtain
the final sentence representation. The CNN model
is schematically illustrated in Figure 2 (bottom).
In the example, the sentence embeddings have six
dimensions, so six feature maps are used under
each kernel width. The blue feature maps have
width two and the red feature maps have width
three. The sentence embeddings obtained under
each kernel width are summed to get the final sen-
tence representation (denoted by green).

Recurrent Document Encoder At the docu-
ment level, a recurrent neural network composes a
sequence of sentence vectors into a document vec-
tor. Note that this is a somewhat simplistic attempt
at capturing document organization at the level of
sentence to sentence transitions. One might view
the hidden states of the recurrent neural network
as a list of partial representations with each fo-
cusing mostly on the corresponding input sentence
given the previous context. These representations
altogether constitute the document representation,
which captures local and global sentential infor-
mation with minimum compression.

The RNN we used has a Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) activation unit for ameliorat-
ing the vanishing gradient problem when train-
ing long sequences (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber,

where W is a learnable weight matrix. Next, we
discuss a special attention mechanism for extract-
ing sentences and words given the recurrent docu-
ment encoder just described, starting from the sen-
tence extractor.

4.2 Sentence Extractor

In the standard neural sequence-to-sequence mod-
eling paradigm (Bahdanau et al., 2015), an atten-
tion mechanism is used as an intermediate step
to decide which input region to focus on in order
to generate the next output. In contrast, our sen-
tence extractor applies attention to directly extract
salient sentences after reading them.

The extractor is another recurrent neural net-
work that labels sentences sequentially, taking into
account not only whether they are individually
relevant but also mutually redundant. The com-
plete architecture for the document encoder and
the sentence extractor is shown in Figure 2. As
can be seen, the next labeling decision is made

extraction.

with both the encoded document and the previ-
ously labeled sentences in mind. Given encoder
hidden states (h1, · · · ,hm) and extractor hidden
states (h̄1, · · · , h̄m) at time step t, the decoder at-
tends the t-th sentence by relating its current de-
coding state to the corresponding encoding state:

h̄t = LSTM(pt−1st−1, h̄t−1) (8)

p(yL(t) = 1|D) = σ(MLP(h̄t : ht)) (9)
where MLP is a multi-layer neural network with as
input the concatenation of h̄t and ht . pt−1 repre-
sents the degree to which the extractor believes the
previous sentence should be extracted and memo-
rized (pt−1=1 if the system is certain; 0 otherwise).

In practice, there is a discrepancy between train-
ing and testing such a model. During training
we know the true label pt−1 of the previous sen-
tence, whereas at test time pt−1 is unknown and
has to be predicted by the model. The discrep-
ancy can lead to quickly accumulating prediction
errors, especially when mistakes are made early in
the sequence labeling process. To mitigate this,
we adopt a curriculum learning strategy (Bengio
et al., 2015): at the beginning of training when
pt−1 cannot be predicted accurately, we set it to
the true label of the previous sentence; as training
goes on, we gradually shift its value to the pre-
dicted label p(yL(t−1) = 1|d).
4.3 Word Extractor
Compared to sentence extraction which is a purely
sequence labeling task, word extraction is closer
to a generation task where relevant content must
be selected and then rendered fluently and gram-
matically. A small extension to the structure of
the sequential labeling model makes it suitable
for generation: instead of predicting a label for
the next sentence at each time step, the model di-
rectly outputs the next word in the summary. The

488



model uses a hierarchical attention architecture:
at time step t, the decoder softly5 attends each
document sentence and subsequently attends each
word in the document and computes the probabil-
ity of the next word to be included in the summary
p(w′t = wi|d,w′1, · · · ,w′t−1) with a softmax classi-
fier:

h̄t = LSTM(w′t−1, h̄t−1)6 (10)

atj = z
T tanh(Weh̄t +Wrh j),h j ∈ D (11)

btj = softmax(a
t
j) (12)

h̃t =
m

∑
j=1

btjh j (13)

uti = v
T tanh(We′ h̃t +Wr′wi),wi ∈ D (14)

p(w′t = wi|D,w′1, · · · ,w′t−1) = softmax(uti) (15)
In the above equations, wi corresponds to the vec-
tor of the i-th word in the input document, whereas
z, We, Wr, v, We′ , and Wr′ are model weights.
The model architecture is shown in Figure 3.

The word extractor can be viewed as a con-
ditional language model with a vocabulary con-
straint. In practice, it is not powerful enough to
enforce grammaticality due to the lexical diversity
and sparsity of the document highlights. A pos-
sible enhancement would be to pair the extractor
with a neural language model, which can be pre-
trained on a large amount of unlabeled documents
and then jointly tuned with the extractor during
decoding (Gulcehre et al., 2015). A simpler al-
ternative which we adopt is to use n-gram features
collected from the document to rerank candidate
summaries obtained via beam decoding. We incor-
porate the features in a log-linear reranker whose
feature weights are optimized with minimum error
rate training (Och, 2003).

5 Experimental Setup

In this section we present our experimental setup
for assessing the performance of our summariza-
tion models. We discuss the datasets used for

5A simpler model would use hard attention to select a sen-
tence first and then a few words from it as a summary, but this
would render the system non-differentiable for training. Al-
though hard attention can be trained with the REINFORCE
algorithm (Williams, 1992), it requires sampling of discrete
actions and could lead to high variance.

6We empirically found that feeding the previous sentence-
level attention vector as additional input to the LSTM would
lead to small performance improvements. This is not shown
in the equation.

training and evaluation, give implementation de-
tails, briefly introduce comparison models, and ex-
plain how system output was evaluated.

Datasets We trained our sentence- and word-
based summarization models on the two datasets
created from DailyMail news. Each dataset was
split into approximately 90% for training, 5% for
validation, and 5% for testing. We evaluated the
models on the DUC-2002 single document sum-
marization task. In total, there are 567 documents
belonging to 59 different clusters of various news
topics. Each document is associated with two ver-
sions of 100-word7 manual summaries produced
by human annotators. We also evaluated our mod-
els on 500 articles from the DailyMail test set
(with the human authored highlights as goldstan-
dard). We sampled article-highlight pairs so that
the highlights include a minimum of 3 sentences.
The average byte count for each document is 278.

Implementation Details We trained our mod-
els with Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with ini-
tial learning rate 0.001. The two momentum pa-
rameters were set to 0.99 and 0.999 respectively.
We performed mini-batch training with a batch
size of 20 documents. All input documents were
padded to the same length with an additional mask
variable storing the real length for each document.
The size of word, sentence, and document em-
beddings were set to 150, 300, and 750, respec-
tively. For the convolutional sentence model, we
followed Kim et al. (2016)8 and used a list of ker-
nel sizes {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}. For the recurrent doc-
ument model and the sentence extractor, we used
as regularization dropout with probability 0.5 on
the LSTM input-to-hidden layers and the scoring
layer. The depth of each LSTM module was 1.
All LSTM parameters were randomly initialized
over a uniform distribution within [-0.05, 0.05].
The word vectors were initialized with 150 dimen-
sional pre-trained embeddings.9

Proper nouns pose a problem for embedding-
based approaches, especially when these are rare

7According to the DUC2002 guidelines http:
//www-nlpir.nist.gov/projects/duc/guidelines/
2002.html, the generated summary should be within 100
words.

8The CNN-LSTM architecture is publicly available at
https://github.com/yoonkim/lstm-char-cnn.

9We used the word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) skip-gram
model with context window size 6, negative sampling size 10
and hierarchical softmax 1. The model was trained on the
Google 1-billion word benchmark (Chelba et al., 2014).

or unknown (e.g., at test time). Rush et al. (2015)
address this issue by adding a new set of features
and a log-linear model component to their sys-
tem. As our model enjoys the advantage of gener-
ation by extraction, we can force the model to in-
spect the context surrounding an entity and its rel-
ative position in the sentence in order to discover
extractive patterns, placing less emphasis on the
meaning representation of the entity itself. Specif-
ically, we perform named entity recognition with
the package provided by Hermann et al. (2015)
and maintain a set of randomly initialized entity
embeddings. During training, the index of the en-
tities is permuted to introduce some noise but also
robustness in the data. A similar data augmenta-
tion approach has been used for reading compre-
hension (Hermann et al., 2015).

A common problem with extractive methods
based on sentence labeling is that there is no con-
straint on the number of sentences being selected
at test time. We address this by reranking the posi-
tively labeled sentences with the probability scores
obtained from the softmax layer (rather than the
label itself). In other words, we are more inter-
ested in is the relative ranking of each sentence
rather than their exact scores. This suggests that
an alternative to training the network would be to
employ a ranking-based objective or a learning to
rank algorithm. However, we leave this to future
work. We use the three sentences with the highest
scores as the summary (also subject to the word or
byte limit of the evaluation protocol).

Another issue relates to the word extraction
model which is challenging to batch since each
document possesses a distinct vocabulary. We
sidestep this during training by performing neg-
ative sampling (Mikolov et al., 2013) which trims
the vocabulary of different documents to the same
length. At each decoding step the model is trained
to differentiate the true target word from 20 noise
samples. At test time we still loop through the
words in the input document (and a stop-word list)
to decide which word to output next.

System Comparisons We compared the output
of our models to various summarization meth-
ods. These included the standard baseline of sim-
ply selecting the “leading” three sentences from
each document as the summary. We also built
a sentence extraction baseline classifier using lo-
gistic regression and human engineered features.
The classifier was trained on the same datasets

as our neural network models with the follow-
ing features: sentence length, sentence position,
number of entities in the sentence, sentence-to-
sentence cohesion, and sentence-to-document rel-
evance. Sentence-to-sentence cohesion was com-
puted by calculating for every document sentence
its embedding similarity with every other sentence
in the same document. The feature was the nor-
malized sum of these similarity scores. Sentence
embeddings were obtained by averaging the con-
stituent word embeddings. Sentence-to-document
relevance was computed similarly. We calculated
for each sentence its embedding similarity with the
document (represented as bag-of-words), and nor-
malized the score. The word embeddings used in
this baseline are the same as the pre-trained ones
used for our neural models.

In addition, we included a neural abstractive
summarization baseline. This system has a similar
architecture to our word extraction model except
that it uses an open vocabulary during decoding.
It can also be viewed as a hierarchical document-
level extension of the abstractive sentence summa-
rizer proposed by Rush et al. (2015). We trained
this model with negative sampling to avoid the ex-
cessive computation of the normalization constant.

Finally, we compared our models to three previ-
ously published systems which have shown com-
petitive performance on the DUC2002 single doc-
ument summarization task. The first approach is
the phrase-based extraction model of Woodsend
and Lapata (2010). Their system learns to produce
highlights from parsed input (phrase structure
trees and dependency graphs); it selects salient
phrases and recombines them subject to length,
coverage, and grammar constraints enforced via
integer linear programming (ILP). Like ours, this
model is trained on document-highlight pairs, and
produces telegraphic-style bullet points rather than
full-blown summaries. The other two systems,
TGRAPH (Parveen et al., 2015) and URANK (Wan,
2010), produce more typical summaries and repre-
sent the state of the art. TGRAPH is a graph-based
sentence extraction model, where the graph is con-
structed from topic models and the optimization
is performed by constrained ILP. URANK adopts a
unified ranking system for both single- and multi-
document summarization.

Evaluation We evaluated the quality of the
summaries automatically using ROUGE (Lin and
Hovy, 2003). We report unigram and bigram over-

mativeness and the longest common subsequence

In addition, we evaluated the generated sum-
maries by eliciting human judgments for 20 ran-
domly sampled DUC 2002 test documents. Par-
ticipants were presented with a news article and
summaries generated by a list of systems. These
include two neural network systems (sentence-
and word-based extraction), the neural abstrac-
tive system described earlier, the lead baseline, the
phrase-based ILP model10 of Woodsend and La-
pata (2010), and the human authored summary.
Subjects were asked to rank the summaries from
best to worst (with ties allowed) in order of in-
formativeness (does the summary capture impor-
tant information in the article?) and fluency (is the
summary written in well-formed English?). We
elicited human judgments using Amazon’s Me-
chanical Turk crowdsourcing platform. Partici-
pants (self-reported native English speakers) saw
2 random articles per session. We collected 5 re-
sponses per document.

NN-WE our word extraction model, and NN-ABS
the neural abstractive baseline. The table also in-
cludes results for the LEAD baseline, the logistic
regression classifier (LREG), and three previously
published systems (ILP, TGRAPH, and URANK).

The NN-SE outperforms the LEAD and LREG
baselines with a significant margin, while per-
forming slightly better than the ILP model. This
is an encouraging result since our model has
only access to embedding features obtained from
raw text. In comparison, LREG uses a set of
manually selected features, while the ILP system
takes advantage of syntactic information and ex-
tracts summaries subject to well-engineered lin-
guistic constraints, which are not available to our
models. Overall, our sentence extraction model
achieves performance comparable to the state of
the art without sophisticated constraint optimiza-
tion (ILP, TGRAPH) or sentence ranking mech-
anisms (URANK). We visualize the sentence
weights of the NN-SE model in the top half of Fig-
ure 4. As can be seen, the model is able to locate
text portions which contribute most to the overall
meaning of the document.

ROUGE scores for the word extraction model
are less promising. This is somewhat expected
given that ROUGE is n-gram based and not very
well suited to measuring summaries which contain
a significant amount of paraphrasing and may de-
viate from the reference even though they express
similar meaning. However, a meaningful com-
parison can be carried out between NN-WE and
NN-ABS which are similar in spirit. We observe
that NN-WE consistently outperforms the purely
abstractive model. As NN-WE generates sum-
maries by picking words from the original docu-
ment, decoding is easier for this model compared
to NN-ABS which deals with an open vocabulary.
The extraction-based generation approach is more
robust for proper nouns and rare words, which
pose a serious problem to open vocabulary mod-

els. An example of the generated summaries for
NN-WE is shown at the lower half of Figure 4.

Table 1 (lower half) also shows system results
on the 500 DailyMail news articles (test set). In
general, we observe similar trends to DUC 2002,
with NN-SE performing the best in terms of all
ROUGE metrics. Note that scores here are gener-
ally lower compared to DUC 2002. This is due
to the fact that the gold standard summaries (aka
highlights) tend to be more laconic and as a result
involve a substantial amount of paraphrasing.

The results of our human evaluation study are
shown in Table 2. Specifically, we show, propor-
tionally, how often our participants ranked each
system 1st, 2nd, and so on. Perhaps unsurpris-
ingly, the human-written descriptions were con-
sidered best and ranked 1st 27% of the time, how-
ever closely followed by our NN-SE model which
was ranked 1st 22% of the time. The ILP system
was mostly ranked in 2nd place (38% of the time).
The rest of the systems occupied lower ranks. We
further converted the ranks to ratings on a scale of
1 to 6 (assigning ratings 6. . .1 to rank placements
1. . .6). This allowed us to perform Analysis of
Variance (ANOVA) which revealed a reliable ef-
fect of system type. Specifically, post-hoc Tukey
tests showed that NN-SE and ILP are significantly
(p < 0.01) better than LEAD, NN-WE, and NN-ABS
but do not differ significantly from each other or
the human goldstandard.

7 Conclusions

In this work we presented a data-driven summa-
rization framework based on an encoder-extractor

architecture. We developed two classes of mod-
els based on sentence and word extraction. Our
models can be trained on large scale datasets and
learn informativeness features based on continu-
ous representations without recourse to linguistic
annotations. Two important ideas behind our work
are the creation of hierarchical neural structures
that reflect the nature of the summarization task
and generation by extraction. The later effectively
enables us to sidestep the difficulties of generat-
ing under a large vocabulary, essentially covering
the entire dataset, with many low-frequency words
and named entities.

Directions for future work are many and var-
ied. One way to improve the word-based model
would be to take structural information into ac-
count during generation, e.g., by combining it with
a tree-based algorithm (Cohn and Lapata, 2009). It
would also be interesting to apply the neural mod-
els presented here in a phrase-based setting similar
to Lebret et al. (2015). A third direction would be
to adopt an information theoretic perspective and
devise a purely unsupervised approach that selects
summary sentences and words so as to minimize
information loss, a task possibly achievable with
the dataset created in this work.
