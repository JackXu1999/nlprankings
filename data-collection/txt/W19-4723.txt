Abstract

The distribution of most dialectal variants
have not only spatial but also temporal pat-
terns. Based on the ‘apparent time hypoth-
esis’, much of dialect change is happening
through younger speakers accepting innova-
tions1. Thus, synchronic diversity can be in-
terpreted diachronically. With the assump-
tion of the ‘contact effect’, i.e. contact possi-
bility (contact and isolation) between speaker
communities being responsible for language
change, and the apparent time hypothesis, we
aim to predict the usage of dialectal variants.
In this paper we model the contact possibil-
ity based on two of the most important factors
in sociolinguistics to be affecting language
change: age and distance. The first steps of
the approach involve modeling contact pos-
sibility using a logistic predictor, taking the
age of respondents into account. We test the
global, and the local role of age for varia-
tion where the local level means spatial sub-
sets around each survey site, chosen based on
k nearest neighbors. The prediction approach
is tested on Swiss German syntactic survey
data, featuring multiple respondents from dif-
ferent age cohorts at survey sites. The re-
sults show the relative success of the logistic
prediction approach and the limitations of the
method, therefore further proposals are made
to develop the methodology.

Contact and isolation, in geographic space and in
social space, are assumed to be the most impor-

ing new form with or without attestation elsewhere can be
considered an innovation.

tant factors behind language change. The concept
of apparent time (Bailey et al., 1991) hypothesizes
that mother tongue is mostly acquired until the late
teenage, after which one’s language is more re-
sistant to change. Throughout an individual’s life
contact patterns and social network might change
(e.g., due to the ease of contact through media and
changing migration or commuting patterns – espe-
cially from the 20th century). However, based on
the apparent time hypothesis, if not uprooted, an
individual’s linguistic patterns can be assumed to
reflect the contact patterns of their early life. With
keeping all other variables constant, it can be as-
sumed that for two people that are close in age and
spent their youth near each other, the chance for a
similar language is higher.

Thus, the quantification of contact possibil-
ity allows predicting current language usage and,
through the concept of ‘apparent time depth’,
future dialect change. If it is possible to pre-
dict the usage of variants based on the contact
among users, core issues in sociolinguistics and
diachronic linguistics such as the diffusion of vari-
ants, tracing back and forecasting change in lan-
guage can be addressed with a better (spatial and
temporal) granularity. Besides, through such an
approach, linguistic theories long used, such as the
apparent time concept (Bailey et al., 1991), lan-
guage change following gravity-like paths (Trudg-
ill, 1974) or wave-like diffusion (Yokoyama and
Sanada, 2009; Blythe and Croft, 2012), can be
tested. Further, it can contribute to natural lan-
guage processing endeavours, such as predict-
ing age from language attributes (Morgan-Lopez
et al., 2017).



187

This study, tracing language variation back to
the patterns of contact between communities, con-
tributes to existing approaches (e.g., Pickl and
Rumpf, 2012; Wieling and Nerbonne, 2015; Ya-
mauchi and Murawaki, 2016; Burridge, 2017)
in language change and variation studies. So
far linguistic geography mostly tested individ-
ual phenomena (Willis, 2017), but as obtaining
data with better granularity becomes increasingly
faster, computational approaches can speed up
analysis in language change studies, and highlight
variants that can be then more thoroughly investi-
gated with the methods of qualitative and quanti-
tative linguistics.

To account for the diverse roles of contact quan-
titatively, the relationship of the measured lin-
guistic variation and variables affecting contact
patterns – including social, demographic, policy-
related or geographic factors – has to be tested.
This paper is not the first step in this direction,
with sociolinguistics and linguistic geography ex-
tensively having researched social status, geo-
graphic distances and trade, among others, in these
regards (e.g., Labov, 1963; Gooskens, 2004; Ner-
bonne, 2009; Szmrecsanyi, 2012; Lameli et al.,
2015). However, this paper shows one of the first
steps towards assembling a model for predicting
usage of dialectal variants, and thereby, language
change by means of taking as many extralinguis-
tic variables as possible into account. In this pa-
per we start assembling the model by taking two
main variable assumed by sociolinguistics to have
a crucial impact on language contact and change:
age and distance. In a previous paper (Jeszenszky
et al., 2018), we provided first steps from the or-
dination aspect for assessing the spatial predictors
of different grammatical domains.

The specific goal of this paper is to analyze the
roles that age and distance play in language con-
tact, as explanatory variables for the usage patterns
of dialectal variants, tested at the linguistic level
of syntax. We build a logistic predictor model at
global and local scales for classifying multivariate
syntactic data from a Swiss German dialect survey
and present first results.

2 Materials and Methods

2.1 Dialect Data

It is often assumed in dialectology that of all
linguistic levels, change in syntax is the slow-
est (Longobardi and Guardiano, 2009). It could

mean that the association with age might be lower
in syntax than for lexicon (Morgan-Lopez et al.,
2017). However, the lower possible number of
syntactic variants allows for more robust results
with fewer responses in a survey.

The dialectal data used in this paper stems
from the database of the Syntactic Atlas of
German-speaking Switzerland (SADS; (Bucheli
and Glaser, 2002; Glaser and Bart, 2015)). The
database holds data collected in a series of four
dialect surveys, which was conducted between
2000 and 2002, and probed 54 different (mor-
pho)syntactic phenomena. At 383 survey sites,
relatively homogeneously distributed throughout
the German-speaking area, a total of 3’174 respon-
dents (multiple respondents, 3-26 per survey site,
median=7) filled in the questionnaires containing
118 questions. Respondents of several age groups
(12-94 years old) were included at most survey
sites. However, the age distribution is slightly
skewed, with a median of 57 years (Stoeckle,
2018). The multitude of responses shows the lo-
cal variation in variant usage, and give a higher
attribute granularity and thus allows testing the as-
sociation of variant usage and extralinguistic vari-
ables, such as age. Most survey questions involved
translation from Standard German to the local di-
alect and multiple choice (MC) questions. For MC
questions however, respondents could accept sev-
eral answer variants as locally valid, and they were
asked to specify their ‘preferred’ variants. In this
work we rely on these preferred variants, as espe-
cially younger respondents tended to accept more
variants (Glaser et al., 2019) – a clue for age as
a factor conditioning usage patterns of dialectal
variants. It has to be noted that even though di-
alectological research often refers to survey ques-
tions as variables, in this paper we call them ‘phe-
nomena’, as the term ‘variable’ overlaps with the
statistical terms used further on (i.e., explanatory
variable, independent variable).

2.2 Predicting Dialectal Variant Usage Based
on Age and Spatial Neighborhood

This paper presents the methodology and first re-
sults of our proposed approach for analysing the
effects of age and regional contact. Regional con-
tact is assumed to be more important in language
change, manifesting itself in the variation of di-
alectal variants by age. We test the following two
hypotheses:



188

• At the global scale, age explains the usage of
dialect variants in linguistic phenomena.

• Age is a better predictor for the usage of di-
alect variants at the local scale.

Firstly, using logistic regression, similarly to
Willis (2017), we analyse the predictive power
of age at the global level, taking into account all
respondents, for the usage of variants that corre-
spond to dialectal phenomena. Secondly, we uti-
lize a regionalisation approach: for every survey
site s, taking a set of k nearest survey sites, we
predict the usage of each variant in s, based on the
age of respondents and the variant preference in
the whole set.

Global scale. We test the association between
linguistic variation as a categorical (nominal) vari-
able and age as a continuous predictor variable, us-
ing logistic regressions. Logistic regression does
not provide a good effect size statistic similar to
R2 used for Pearson’s product-moment correla-
tion. Nevertheless, its predictive power can be
tested by training the logistic regression predictor
on a training set in the data and checking whether
the predictions of this model correspond to the ob-
served data previously masked. We use a 10-fold
cross-validation strategy, with all data used in the
training set and all observed data predicted. This
tests whether logistic regression based on age pro-
vides a significant prediction on the usage of vari-
ants at the global level, and if so, with what ac-
curacy. Thus, we report in Figure 1 the signifi-
cance in a binary way (i.e., whether the prediction
of the usage of a certain variant is significant or
not). Besides, we present the AUC in Figure 1
as well, as a typical performance measurement for
binary classifiers, showing the separability, i.e., to
what degree the model is capable of distinguishing
between classes. The higher the AUC, better the
model is at predicting 0s as 0s and 1s as 1s.

Local scale. The regional approach can be
viewed as a classification problem. Our model has
to decide for each variant whether respondents at a
central survey site s used it or not, based on age as
the predictor variable in a set of k nearest neighbor
survey sites. We use a logistic regression approach
again. Using age as continuous and answer vari-
ants of all respondents as boolean variables, we
train a logistic model and predict the variant usage
for each respondent at s. We do this for all 383
survey sites. In this paper, we choose the k near-
est neighbors based on Euclidean distance and we

test models with different k values (5 to 50). Our
approach employs distance cut-off, rather than dis-
tance decay, however it can also be assumed that
the closer survey sites are, the more linguistic in-
fluence they have on each other.

3 Results

For this paper, we used 60 phenomena from the
SADS survey (approximately half of all), which
were already used in Jeszenszky et al. (2017). Ap-
pendix A provides some linguistic details on each
phenomenon.

Results with regards to the explanatory value
of age as a global predictor for variant usage are
presented in Figure 1. For more than half of the
variants considered, age is not a significant pre-
dictor (dark grey squares). The AUC values of
separability, reported for the variants where the
relationship with age is significant, are relatively
low (0.5 means no discriminative capacity of the
model). At the same time, variants that reach
higher values typically have relatively few users
(below 100 out of 3’714), e.g., II5 32; 10 users and
II30 7; 8 users. However, several variants with
sparse usage are also found among those not pre-
dicted significantly by age. Variants with many
users (e.g., I12 1; 2’683 users, I7 3; 2’880 users,
III2 1; 2’021 users) typically have an AUC value
between 0.5 and 0.6. These values of association
between variant usage and age alone are relatively
low overall, leading us to investigate the prediction
power of age at the regional scale, the patterns of
which are possibly concealed by the global pat-
terns.

For each variant in each phenomenon, Figure 2
presents the number of survey sites (out of the total
383) in which age significantly predicts the vari-
ant’s usage, based on k = 13 nearest neighbors.
It is visible that age proves to be a significant pre-
dictor in a large amount or survey sites only for
a few variants. These are, however, not always
variants with a few users. The first few variants
in each phenomenon usually cover the majority of
respondents.

The distribution of one such variant (III7 2) is
mapped in Figure 3 along with the significance
and accuracy of the predictor variable age. The
patterns in Figure 3 show that the higher number

of users does not necessarily make age a signifi-
cant predictor. Significance of age as a predictor
variable is spatially autocorrelated, which can be
interpreted as follows. When present, the usage of
this variant is characteristic of certain age groups
at survey sites with green points, while at red ones
it is used by different age groups.

As logistic regression is sensitive to class imbal-
ances, it might not always be the best choice as a
predictor when there are a lot of 0s and only a few
1s in the data, as it might result in false accuracy
by predicting 0s only and not the 1s.

Interpretations of the first results show that age
alone does not prove to be an exceptionally good
predictor of syntactic variation. This is partly due
to the nature of the data. It has been shown that
while lexicon is more prone to have a correlation
with age, syntax changes slower. The first results,
however, show that already with a relatively sim-
ple approach, our research direction seems to be
a worthwhile undertaking. Therefore, we have a
wide outlook for further developing the methodol-
ogy. The area and number of respondents involved
in each model will be tested through different val-
ues of k, a distance decay approach and weights

based on different parameters (including age). The
spatial basis of the model will feature estimations
of contact potential that have proved more ‘in-
formative’ than Euclidean distance, such as travel
time (Jeszenszky et al., 2017); linguistic gravity
(Trudgill, 1974), predicting influence and there-
fore language change based on settlement popula-
tions as weights in a gravity equation; or linguis-
tic distance (Pickl et al., 2014), assuming that the
closer dialect varieties should be the outcomes of
closer (historical) contact. Furthermore, different
algorithms beyond the logistic predictor (e.g., ran-
dom forests, SVM, XGBoost) will be tested in the
prediction model.
