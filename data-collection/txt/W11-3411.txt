Abstract 

Content-targeted advertising systems 

are becoming an increasingly important 

part of the funding for free web services. 

These programs automatically find rele-

vant keywords on a web page, and then 

display ads based on those keywords. 

We propose a method for providing 

links to ads for travel products (which 

we call ad links) automatically. We ex-

tract keywords from citing areas of 

travel information links, and provide 

appropriate ad links. To investigate the 

effectiveness of our method, we con-

ducted experiments. We obtained a high 

precision for the extraction of keywords 

and provision of ad links. 

1 Introduction 

Online advertising is a form of promotion that 

uses the World Wide Web for the expressed pur-

pose of delivering marketing messages to attract 

customers. Examples of such online ads are con-

textual advertising and listing advertising. Con-

tent-targeted advertising systems, such as 

Google’s Ad Sense program and Yahoo’s Con-

textual Match product, are becoming an increas-

ingly important part of the funding for free web 

services. These programs automatically find rel-

evant keywords on a web page, and then display 

ads based on those keywords. We propose a 

method for providing ad links for travel products 

to travel blog entries, which are travel journals 

written by bloggers in diary form. By specifying 

the travel domain, we aim to provide more ap-

propriate ad links than existing content-targeted 

advertising systems. 

To provide these ad links, we take account of 

the types of hyperlinks in each travel blog entry. 

Ishino et al. (2011) devised a method for con-

structing a collection of web links for travel in-

formation automatically. They extracted the hy-

perlinks by which bloggers describe useful web 

sites for a tourist spot from travel blog entries, 

and classified types of travel information link 

into the following four categories. 

 

 S (Spot): The information is about tourist 
spots. 

 H (Hotel): The information is about ac-
commodation. 

 R (Restaurant): The information is about 
restaurants. 

 O (Other): Other than types S, H, and R. 
 

By switching strategies for providing ad links 

according to these types, we attempt to provide 

more appropriate ad links for travel. 

The remainder of this paper is organized as 

follows. Section 2 shows the system behavior in 

terms of snapshots. Section 3 discusses related  
work. Section 4 describes our methods. To inves-

tigate the effectiveness of our methods, we con-

ducted some experiments, and Section 5 reports 

on these and the results. We present some con-

clusions in Section 6. 

2 System Behavior 

In this section, we describe our prototype system, 

which provides information about (1) useful web 

sites for tourist spots and (2) ads for travel prod-

ucts. The two steps in the search procedure are: 

(Step 1) Input a keyword, such as “Okonomi-

yaki” (Japanese-style pancake), in the search 

form (shown as ① in Figure 1). 

63



(Step 2) Click the “link” button (shown as ②) 
to generate a list of URLs for web sites related to 

the keyword together with automatically identi-

fied link types using Ishino’s method (Ishino et 

al. 2011), the context of citations (“citing areas”), 

by which the authors of the travel blog entries 

describe the sites, and ads for travel products 

related to the citing areas. We classified link 

types into the four categories described above. 

(Step 3) Click the “link”(shown as ③) to  dis-
play detailed information of ads for travel prod-

ucts (shown in Figure 2). 

We propose a method for providing ad links to 

travel products corresponding to the link type.

3 Related Work 

In this section, we describe some related studies. 

Recommendation systems provide a promising 

approach to ranking commercial products or var-

ious documents according to a user’s interests. 

These systems can be classified into two catego-

ries by their underlying method of recommenda-

tion: (1) collaborative filtering (Goldberg et al. 

1992) and (2) content-based filtering (Sarwar et 

al. 2000). We focus on the online advertising 

using the content-based filtering techniques. 

Examples of online advertising are listing ad-

vertising and contextual advertising. Listing ad-

vertising is a method of placing online ads on 

web pages that show results from search engine 

queries. Search advertisements are targeted to 

match the entered keywords. Fujita et al. (2010) 

showed a system that automatically generates 

shop-specific listing ads by reusing textual data 

promoting each shop. They used a restaurant por-

tal site as textual data. We use citing areas of 

travel information links, and provide ad links to 

related travel products.  

In this paper, we focus on contextual advertis-

ing, which is based on keywords automatically 

extracted from the text of the web page. Key-

word extraction is the core task of the contextual 

advertising system. There are a number of classi-

cal approaches to extracting keywords. TF*IDF 

uses a frequency criterion to select keywords. 

Yih et al. (2006) showed a learning-based tech-

nique using TF*IDF for contextual advertising. 

Recently, new methods based on the Wikipedia 

corpus have been proposed. The Wikify! system 

(Mihalcea and Csmomai, 2007) identifies key-

words in a text, and then links these keywords to 

the corresponding Wikipedia pages. They identi-

fied keywords using a criterion called 

keyphraseness. They applied their method to 

English texts. We extract keywords from Japa-

nese citing areas. Therefore, we cannot apply 

their method for Japanese citing areas. 

4 Automatic Organization of Travel In-
formation through Blogs 

The task of organizing travel through blogs is 

divided into two steps: (1) classification of links 

in travel blog entries, and (2) providing ad links 

for travel information links. These steps are ex-

plained in Sections 4.1 and 4.2. 

4.1 Link Classification 

Ishino et al. (2011) devised a method for classi-

fying links in travel blog entries into the four 

categories described in Section 1. The procedure 

is as follows.

1. Input a travel blog entry. 
2. Extract a hyperlink and any surrounding 

sentences that mention the link (a citing 

area). 

3. Classify the link by taking account of the 
information in the citing area.  

In the following, we will explain Steps 2 and 3. 

 

Extraction of citing areas 

Ishino et al. manually created rules for the auto-

matic extraction of citing areas. These rules use 

cue phrases. 

Method of link type classification  

They classified hyperlinks automatically. They 

employed a machine-learning technique using 

the following features. Here, a sequence of nouns 

(a noun phrase) was treated as a noun. 

 

 A word. 
 Whether the word is a cue phrase, de-

tailed as follows, where the numbers in 

brackets shown for each feature represent 

the number of cues (shown in Table 1, 

Table 2, and Table 3).

To investigate the effectiveness of their meth-

od, Ishino et al. conducted an experiment. The 

evaluation results are shown in Table 4. We ap-

plied this model to 17,266 travel blog entries, 

and classified 4,155 links. The numbers of auto-

matically classified links are shown in Table 5. 

We call these links travel information links. We 

describe the method for providing ad links to 

travel products in the following section.

4.2 Providing Ad Links for Travel Infor-
mation Links 

The procedure for providing ad links for travel 

information links is as follows. 

1. Input a link type and the citing areas of a 
travel information link. 

2. Extract keywords from the citing areas. 
3. Extract product data containing all key-

words, and calculate the similarity be-

65



tween the citing areas of a travel infor-

mation link and the product data. 

4. Provide an ad link to the product data 
having the highest similarity for the travel 

information link. 

In the following, we will explain Steps 2 and 3. 

 

Keyword extraction based on link types 

We extract keywords for travel products corre-

sponding to the link type. We use the cues used 

by Ishino’s method for classifying travel infor-

mation links, and extract keywords from citing 

areas of link types S and R. 

First, we describe the method for extracting 

keywords from citing areas of link type S. The 

cues for type S shown in Table 1, such as tourist 

spots collected from Wikipedia and words fre-

quently used in the names of tourist spots, tend to 

become keywords. Therefore, we register these 

cues as candidate keywords for link type S. If 

citing areas of link type S contain candidate 

keywords, we extract them as keywords. In addi-

tion, if citing areas contain names of places, we 

extract them as keywords. Candidate keywords 

for link type S are shown in Table 6. 

Next, we describe a method for extracting 

keywords from citing areas of link type R. The 

cue for type R shown in Table 3, such as dish 

names and cooking styles, tend to become key-

words. Therefore, we register these cues as can-

didate keywords for link type R. If citing areas of 

link type R contain candidate keywords, we ex-

tract them as keywords. Candidate keywords for 

link type R are shown in Table 7. We used Cab-

oCha software 

(http://chasen.org/~taku/software/cabocha/) to 

identify location names.

Product data extraction based on the link types 

We extract product data, which contain all key-

words, and calculate the similarity between cit-

ing areas of a travel information link and the 

product data. 

 

Product data 

We provide ad links to travel products of 

Rakuten Shopping Mall (Rakuten Ichiba) or fa-

cility data of Rakuten Travel released through 

the Rakuten Institute of Technology for travel 

information links.  An example of product data 

of Rakuten Ichiba is shown in Figure 3. The 

product data contain 50 million items. An item 

has a name, a code, a price, descriptive texts, 

URL, picture, shop code, category ID and regis-

tration date. The facility data contain 11,468 fa-

cilities. A facility data entry has a name, ID 

number, and user review.

We provide ad links to product data having as-

sociations with travel information links by using 

the link types of the travel information links. We 

take account of the characteristics of link types, 

and assign each category to link types. Catego-

ries of product data are shown in Table 8.

A category master, shown in Table 9, was re-

leased through the Rakuten Institute of Technol-

ogy. The category master has a hierarchic struc-

ture. First, we collect subcategories of the cate-

gory “Travel, Study abroad, Outdoor amuse-

ment”. In this way, we collect category IDs relat-

ed to travel, and show the category IDs in Table 

10. Next, we collect product data with category 

ID related to travel as product data related to 

travel. In the same way, we collect product data 

related to food.

Similarity calculation 

We describe the method for calculating the simi-

larity between citing areas and product data. We 

extract product data that contain all keywords K, 

and calculate the similarity Score between citing 

areas of a travel information link and the product 

data. Score is calculated as follows: 
)1()(_*)(_ 　　　




Kk

i

kScoregAdvertisinkScoreLinkScore  

Link_Score(ki) is the number of times the giv-

en keywords ki appears in that citing area. Adver-

tising_Score(ki) is the number of times the given 

keyword ki appears in the descriptive text of the 

product data. We provide an ad link to the prod-

uct having the highest score for the travel infor-

mation link.
 

5 Experiments 

To investigate the effectiveness of our methods, 

we conducted several experiments.  

5.1 Experimental Method 

To generate the test data for providing ad links, 

we randomly selected 50 travel information links 

of type S and 50 of type R and manually classi-

fied them. To investigate the effectiveness of our 

method, we extracted keywords using the follow-

ing two methods for evaluation of keywords in 

Section 5.2 and ad links in Section 5.3. 

 

 Our method: Extract keywords by our 
method, as described in Section 4.2. 

 TF*IDF: TF*IDF is a conventional base-
line used in the scientific literature for 

comparison of keywords extraction algo-

rithms. IDF was calculated using an open 

API 

(http://developer.yahoo.co.jp/webapi/sear

ch/websearch/v2/websearch.html). We 

extract the top-X words as keywords. 

 

In addition, we evaluated our method for ad 

links for the limited categories described in Sec-

tion 4.2 and all categories of product data.  

5.2 Evaluation of Keywords 

We evaluated the method for keywords extrac-

tion. We used precision as the evaluation meas-

ure, calculated as follows: 

 

)2(

The evaluation results are shown in Table 11.

TF*IDF(X=5) 34.0 (85/250) 32.5 (80/246) 

Table 11.Precision of extracted keywords 

 

There were two typical errors in keyword ex-

traction: (1) the lack of cues and (2) a problem 

with the method of keywords extraction. We de-

scribe these errors as follows. 

 

(1) The lack of cues: 

For keywords extraction, we used manually se-

lected cues, as described in Section 4.2. To im-

prove the coverage of cues, a statistical approach, 

such as applying n-gram statistics to a larger blog 

corpus, will be required. 

 

(2) The problem with the method of keywords 

extraction: 

In the following example, our method mistak-

enly extracted “天然温泉” (a natural hot spring) 
as a keyword, because the candidate keywords 

for link type S “天然温泉” (a natural hot spring) 
appears in the citing areas.

5.3 Evaluation of Ad Links 

We evaluated the method for providing ad links 

for travel information links. We used precision 

and coverage as evaluation measures, which 

were calculated as fol-

lows:

Table 13. Precision and coverage of providing ad 

links for travel information links of type R 

 

First, we discuss the results for link type S. As 

shown in Table 12, our method attained higher 

precision than the baseline methods. For cover-

age, TF*IDF (X=1) and TF*IDF (X=2) were 

better than our method, while we obtained more 

appropriate travel information links provided as 

ad links than the baseline method. 

Next, we discuss the results for link type R. As 

shown in Table 13, our method attained higher 

precision than the baseline methods. For cover-

age, TF*IDF (X=1), TF*IDF (X=2) and TF*IDF 

(X=3) were better than our method, while we 

obtained larger numbers of appropriate travel 

information links provided as ad links than the 

baseline methods. Therefore, our experimental 

results confirm the effectiveness of our methods. 

We discuss a typical error in providing links. 

In the following example, we could not provide 

ad links. Our method extracted an appropriative 

keyword “Nihon-heso-kōen” (The Navel Park, 

68



NISHIWAKI, JAPAN). Nihon-heso-kōen is a 

park in Hyogo prefecture, Japan. However, there 

are no product data containing this word, and we 

could not provide any ad links for the travel in-

formation link. To solve this problem, we took 

the address of Nihon-heso-kōen from web pages, 

and provided an ad link to a guidebook that de-

scribes tourist spots near Nihon-heso-kōen for 

the travel information link.

5.4 Evaluation of Limited Category 

We evaluate our method for ad links for the 

limited category shown in Section 4.2 and for all 

categories of product data. We used precision 

and coverage as evaluation measures, as de-

scribed in Section 4.3. The evaluation results are 

shown in Table 14 and Table 15.

As shown in the tables, our method attained 

higher precision than the baseline method. For 

coverage, baselines of types S and R were better 

than our method, while we obtained a larger 

number of appropriate travel information links 

provided as ad links than the baseline method. 

Therefore, our experimental results confirm the 

effectiveness of our methods. 

As examples of more appropriate ad links than 

our method could provide, the baseline method 

could provide ad links to product data not direct-

ly related to travel, such as books, CDs and 

DVDs that describe tourist spots. These are not 

categorized as product data related to travel in 

our system. In our future work, we plan to classi-

fy such product data as related to travel automat-

ically so that we can provide more appropriate ad 

links. 

6 Conclusion 

We have proposed a method for providing ad 

links for travel information links automatically. 

For the extraction of keywords, we obtained 

81.8% precision for link type S and 98.0% preci-

sion for link type R. For providing ad links, we 

obtained 79.3% precision for link type S and 

78.3% precision for link type R. Our method also 

provided larger numbers of appropriate travel 

information links as ad links than the baseline 

method.  Our experimental results have con-

firmed the effectiveness of our methods.  

7 Future Work 

For our method, we used manually selected 

cues. To increase the number of cues, a statistical 

approach is required. 

In this paper, we have focused on travel in-

formation links written in Japanese. In our future
