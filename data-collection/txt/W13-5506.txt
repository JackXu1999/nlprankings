Abstract 

Developing language resources requires 
much time, funding and effort. This is why 
they need to be reused in new projects and 
developments, so that they may both serve a 
wider scientific community and sustain their 
cost. The main problems that prevent this 
from happening are that (1) language re-
sources are rarely free and/or easy to locate; 
and (2) they are hardly ever interoperable. 
Therefore, the language resource community 
is now working to transform their most valu-
able assets into open and interoperable re-
sources, which can then be shared and linked 
with other open and interoperable resources. 
This will allow data to be reanalyzed and re-
purposed. In this paper, we present the first 
steps taken to transform a set of such re-
sources, namely the Data Transcription and 
Analysis Tool’s (DTA) metadata and data, in-
to an open and interoperable language re-
source. These first steps include the devel-
opment of two ontologies that formalize the 
conceptual model underlying the DTA 
metadata and the labels used in the DTA to 
annotate both utterances and their transcrip-
tions at several annotation levels. 

1 Introduction 
As the web evolves into the Web 2.0 and is com-
plemented by the Web 3.0,1

 the Semantic Web 
and/or the Web of Data (Auer and Hellmann, 
2012), the need for language resources to be 
transformed into open, sharable and interopera-
ble resources becomes more urgent. Lately, this 
transformation has been achieved by converting 
language resources into linked open data sets 
and/or graphs. These linked data help formalize 
and make explicit common-sense knowledge in a 
way that satisfies the needs of the Web 3.0, the 
Semantic Web and/or the Web of Data. Indeed, 

computers are already using these linked data to 
process information “more intelligently”. 

In this context, many language resources may 
unfortunately be left aside and fade into oblivion 
if they fail to address this challenge (which 
would entail a waste of considerable data and 
effort for the scientific community). Making lan-
guage resources easier to share and more in-
teroperable would help researchers collaborate 
and build on others’ work. 

This is the case of the resources generated by 
the Data Transcription and Analysis Tool 
(DTA).2 The DTA tool is a primary research web 
application that organizes metadata and data 
primarily for the study of language acquisition, 
either monolingual or multilingual.3 Henceforth, 
we will use the term DTA to refer to the tool it-
self, its experiment bank component, and its as-
sociated corpora. The DTA allows for long dis-
tance collaborative research and serves as a 
teaching tool for training students on language 
data management and analysis. Besides provid-
ing a powerful relational database, which handles 
both experimental and naturalistic data, it also 
structures the primary data creation process from 
its initial stages. Hence, the DTA represents data 
so that it can be analyzed subsequently in a 
standardized and theory-neutral way, which en-
sures data comparability within a language and 
across languages. At the same time, it allows re-
searchers to create project-specific codings, al-
lowing multiple types of analyses in their own 
data or linking data across projects. This tool was 
created as part of the VCLA’s4 Virtual Linguis-
tics Lab5

Human Subjects confidentiality requirements and the intel-
lectual property rights of the contributing researchers. To 
allow for wider dissemination, multiple levels of access 
must be set. The PIs are currently investigating potential 
funding sources for this dissemination.

the digital age created for the interdisciplinary, 
cross-linguistic study of language acquisition 
(Blume and Lust, 2012; Blume et al., 2012).6

The research presented here is the result of a 
joint work in which we compared and linked two 
different language resources, namely 
OntoLingAnnot’s ontologies (Pareja-Lora and 
Aguado de Cea, 2010; Pareja-Lora, 2012a; 
Pareja-Lora 2012b; Pareja-Lora, 2013) and the 
Data Transcription and Analysis Tool (Blume 
and Lust, 2012; Blume et al., 2012). 

  

In this paper we introduce (i) the metadata and 
the labels that are used within the DTA to anno-
tate data on language acquisition; and (ii) the two 
ontologies that we have now built to represent, 
respectively, the DTA metadata and the DTA 
labels. In some cases, these labels (such as Noun 
Phrase, Sentence, Statement, Question or An-
swer) can be linked to ISOCat categories 
(Windhouwer and Wright, 2012) and/or are 
equivalent to some GOLD element (Farrar and 
Langendoen, 2010). 7  These links and equiva-
lences are being included in the ontologies as 
well, which should help add the DTA ontologies 
to the Linguistic Linked Open Data (LLOD) 
cloud8

Our paper is organized as follows. The DTA 
metadata categories are presented in section 

 (Chiarcos et al., 2012) shortly. 

2. 
Section 3 introduces the labels used in the DTA 
to annotate the data linguistically. A comparison 
of the DTA labels and metadata with those of 
other related projects, such as CHILDES and the 
Language Archive (LA), is provided in section 4. 
In Section 5, we show the two ontologies built to 
conceptualize, the DTA metadata and the DTA 
labels, each one in a dedicated subsection. Final-
ly, section 6 discusses the conclusions of this 
research and gives an overview of our future 
work. 

2 The DTA metadata categories 
The DTA is based on 10 tables with the follow-
ing basic markup categories: project, dataset, 

                                                 
6 The DTA capabilities extend to other areas of language 
knowledge and use, such as language deterioration in adult 
dementia. Although the VLL and its cybertools were creat-
ed with the study of language acquisition and multilingual-
ism in mind, they can not only be expanded to other lan-
guage areas but also used as a prototype for data manage-
ment and linking in other areas of scientific investigation 
7 The cross-linguistic data in the DTA should also be a good 
test for how well GOLD categories work across languages, 
an issue central to the 2005 E-Meld workshop (cf. 
http://www.emeld.org/workshop/2005/).

subject, session, recording, transcription, utter-
ance, coding set, coding, and utterance coding. 
Metadata codings involve the project and subject 
levels and the dataset level leading to transcribed 
utterances and related linguistic codings. In the 
DTA the data are organized in projects. A pro-
ject contains several subjects. Each subject is a 
participant whose language is studied in the pro-
ject. The subject screen is where all the partici-
pant info is stored. The application uses the 
UTF-8 encoding to store text and adopts the ISO 
639-3 standard language codes, which cover over 
7000 languages. It links with GeoNames.org for 
geographic reference. 

Each project contains the following main sec-
tions of information: Project Main Info, Refer-
ences, Subjects, Datasets, Coding, and Queries. 

2.1 The Project Main Info Section 
Under Project Main Info there are three tabs: 
Main Info, Results, Summary and Discussion. 
Main info provides an overview of the main in-
formation on a project so that other users may 
decide whether they choose to continue reading 
about this project or move to another one. The 
text fields include title (project’s name), princi-
pal investigator, additional and assisting investi-
gators, acknowledgments, dates, purpose, leading 
hypotheses, and comments. Results and summary 
and discussion allow one to enter the results and 
the discussion for the whole project (from all the 
datasets). 

2.2 The References Section 
References include publications, presentations, 
related studies, and references. They all have the 
same basic structure based on an APA format. 
The only variation is on the items one can select 
under “type”. Under publications, related stud-
ies, and references, “type” includes book, chap-
ter, article, web page, thesis, dissertation, and 
other. All types include the basic fields title, au-
thors, and date, and other needed fields accord-
ing to the reference type. Presentations contains 
the following types: conference, invited speaker, 
colloquium, and other (which are also included 
under related studies) with the same basic fields 
as publications plus “place of publica-
tion/presentation”, “URL” and “notes”. 

2.3 The Subjects Section 
The subject data are not session-specific; i.e., 
permanent characteristics of the subject are rec-
orded in this screen. The subject screen has two 
sections: Subject and Caretakers. Subject in-

35



cludes ID, name, gender, DOB, nationality, eth-
nicity, place of birth, whether the subject has any 
language or cognitive impairment, whether Hu-
man Subjects required documents have been 
filled in and a multilingualism questionnaire has 
been completed, the subject’s contact infor-
mation, and comments. Information on the lan-
guage(s), dialect(s), and levels of language com-
prehension and production for each language are 
also indicated. When subjects are children, in-
formation on their caretakers is also stored in-
cluding relationship with the subject, occupation, 
name, contact information, languages, dialects, 
and levels of proficiency. 

2.4 The Sessions and Datasets Section 
The subjects participate in different recording 
sessions (tests, observations, or surveys). The 
sessions are organized in groups called datasets. 
Each subject has at least one session, but they 
can have more than one. All sessions for a sub-
ject may be part of one dataset but they can be 
divided into more datasets. 9

Datasets contain two main sections: Main Info 
and Sessions. Main Info includes title, type (in-
vestigation or experiment), topic, abstract, and 
related WebDTA project/datasets, hypotheses, 
subjects (a summary description of subjects in 
the dataset), methods (production, comprehen-
sion, perceptual discrimination, or grammaticali-
ty judgment), design (factors, variables, condi-
tions, controls, specific hypotheses, statistical 
analyses), stimuli, procedures, scoring, results, 
and conclusions. Sessions include the following 
information fields: Session ID, date, interviewer, 
assistants, session length, task, languages used, 
and session location. Information on the subject 
characteristics at each particular session is also 
included: Current age (calculated by the DTA), 
number of siblings, position among siblings, ad-
dress, length of residence, education, occupation, 
and school. Fundamental information (name and 
transcription identifier) on the session partici-
pants besides the subject and interviewer is also 
created. Information on the general activities car-
ried out during the session and the analyses per-
formed on the data are included. 

 Each dataset con-
tains the recordings, transcriptions, and codings 
for each session. 

                                                 
9 Each project user can determine what constitutes a dataset; 
they are usually divided in terms of the experimental task 
used (each different task used in one project constitutes an 
independent dataset) or by participant characteristics (e.g. 
Spanish-speakers vs. English-speakers). 

3 The DTA Labels 
Labels in the DTA are called codings. Codings 
and their related queries can be established at a 
global level or at an individual dataset level. 
Global codings can be used by all projects and 
can only be established by users with administra-
tor access. Codings are grouped in coding sets. 
Simple coding sets were created to standardize 
and calibrate basic levels of linguistic analysis. 
They may also introduce students to linguistic 
coding with increasing levels of analy-
sis/difficulty. Experimental projects create their 
project-specific coding sets in addition to basic 
ones, as do researchers who work with natural 
speech. 

There are three basic coding sets: Utterance 
transcription, speech act, and basic linguistic. 
Utterance transcription includes text fields that 
give information to contextualize the utterances10 
and allows one to add simple linguistic descrip-
tions, translations and glosses of non-English 
utterances. 11  Speech act lists common speech 
acts with some additional ones common in child 
data12 and asks about the spontaneous or respon-
sive character of the utterance, and therefore re-
lates more to the pragmatic/discursive aspects of 
the data.13 Finally, basic linguistic asks whether 
the utterance is a sentence or not, and whether 
the sentence has an overt verb,14

                                                 
10 General context (a description of the participants, their 
location and activities throughout the session), utterance 
context (the context necessary to understand the contents of 
a particular utterance, for example, what the speaker is re-
ferring to or who they are addressing), and comments. 

 as well as for 
the number of morphemes, words, and syllables 
of the utterance, to calculate the Mean Length of 
Utterance (MLU), an important developmental 
measure in child language acquisition. Addition-
al basic linguistic codings are now being created. 

11  Morphological coding, word-by-word gloss, general 
gloss (a translation into English that conveys the meaning of 
the utterance regardless of structure), and phonetic tran-
scription. 
12  Declarative/assertive, question, imperative, promise, 
wish/request, expressives/exclamations, yes/no/OK, nam-
ing, counting, singing, politeness, greetings, unclear, and 
other. 
13  Spontaneous, self-repetition, other repetition, answer-
Y/N, answer-Wh, other answer (i.e., when the subject an-
swers a question which is not a Wh-question or a Y/N-
question), unclear, other. 
14  Verbless sentences are common in early child speech 
(e.g. Me [ə] cookie from mommy). The corresponding labels 
are “is this a sentence?” and “is the verb overt?”.

4 Comparing the DTA with other sys-
tems 

Certain databases, such as CHILDES and the 
Language Archive, share some of the purposes of 
the DTA. Given that both CHILDES and DTA 
have focused on child language data, they obvi-
ously have common or similar labels in the 
codings that they adopt (about 2415). However, 
one main difference is that the DTA provides the 
user with a structured interface for primary data 
entry and management, while CHILDES lists 
possible metadata fields in its accompanying 
manual, and provides no structure for the re-
searcher. The information on what to fill in when 
archiving data is provided in the CHILDES 
manual in a narrative form.16

One label in CHILDES may be covered by 
more than one label in the DTA. For example, 
the “creator” label corresponds to three labels in 
the DTA, namely “Principal Investigator”, “Ad-
ditional Investigators”, and “Assisting investiga-
tors.” A “How was data collected” label is cov-
ered by the DTA’s more specific fields under the 
Dataset Main Info: “type, method type, method 
details, design, and stimuli”. Some identical la-
bels refer to different things.

 

17

Although researcher compliance in filling the 
required fields cannot be assured, the main ad-
vantage of the DTA is its structured format, 
which helps researchers in the primary data crea-
tion process.

 CHILDES asks 
for information on the funding for the project 
which is not included in the DTA, but could easi-
ly be incorporated, and on some other aspects 
which the DTA creators did not consider rele-
vant, e.g., “religion”, “interests”, “friends”, “lay-
out of child’s home and bedroom” and whatever 
is included under “and so forth”. 

18

                                                 
15 Numbers in parentheses refer to number of fields. 

 

16 “7. Biographical data. Where possible, extensive demo-
graphic, dialectological, and psychometric data should be 
provided for each informant. There should be information 
on topics such as age, gender, siblings, schooling, social 
class, occupation, previous residences, religion, interests, 
friends, and so forth.[…]” (MacWhinney, 2012: 23) 
17 E.g. “acknowledgments” in the DTA refers to acknowl-
edgments of the persons who made the project possible, and 
in CHILDES it refers to the rules for citing data used by a 
researcher who did not create such data. 
18 In CHILDES, the requested information is not completed 
in several of the available corpora. To take one relevant 
case, the CHILDES corpus does not have all the requested 
information and includes several pieces of information (re-
lated to OLAC and IMDI), which are not mentioned in the 
manual. To get more complete information on a corpus, 
readers are directed to the Database Manuals in which each 

To compare the DTA and the Language Ar-
chive (LA), we looked at the metadata fields in 
Brugman et al. (2003). For clarification of the 
LA field definitions we consulted IMDI Metada-
ta 3.0.4. The DTA and the LA share many of 
their fields since both have language archiving 
and metadata creation purposes in mind. The 
main differences are related to content organiza-
tion. While the LA organizes data in terms of 
sessions, with project information contained in-
side a session and no dataset level, the DTA or-
ganizes it in terms of projects that contain da-
tasets which in turn contain sessions.19

The main differences between the systems 
stem from their partially divergent purposes. The 
DTA was developed mainly for child language 
acquisition so it asks for detailed information on 
the child’s caretakers and it was intended for ex-
perimental as well as observational data; thus it 
has much more detailed fields related to project 
and dataset experimental design (19) which do 
not exist in the LA. The LA has a much more 
detailed information section on the different 
types of resources (it distinguishes “source”, “re-
source”, and “written resource” with detailed 
information for type, format, encoding, access, 
and anonymity for all), and on the type of com-
munication context and genre of the interaction 
(30), some of which would be relevant for the 
DTA. Surprisingly, there are more than a few 
fields that the DTA has which are not 
child/experiment specific which the LA does not 
have, such as the participant’s length of resi-
dence at the session location, date of birth, na-
tionality, place of birth, levels of language or 
cognitive impairment, dialect, whether he/she is 
a native speaker of the language used in the ses-
sion, and his/her levels of proficiency in the lan-
guage. The DTA also has a more detailed divi-
sion of references as explained in section 

 

2.2 
above. 

                                                                          
corpus is described. Length of descriptions varies from a 
short paragraph to two or three pages. 
19 The DTA and the LA share very few fields at the differ-
ent levels (i.e., project description (3), session description 
(4) and transcription/annotation (1)). Several fields have 
similar names in the two systems (20). Nine fields in the LA 
are divided into more than one field in the DTA (e.g., task 
in the LA corresponds to dataset method type, dataset 
method details, and session task in the DTA, annotator in 
the LA corresponds to transcriber and checker in the DTA).

5 Ontological Formalization of DTA 
Categories 

As shown in the previous section, the DTA pro-
vides the most detailed and exhaustive repertoire 
developed so far with metadata and labels for 
child language analysis and annotation. There-
fore, it seems reasonable to formalize this reper-
toire by means of some ontologies. This formali-
zation will help to compare, integrate and link 
DTA annotations with the annotations resulting 
from CHILDES or the LA later on.20

As noted above, the DTA language acquisition 
data are annotated with extensive metadata, such 
as the time and place where they were collected, 
and the data (e.g. transcriptions) are annotated 
linguistically. At this time, these linguistic anno-
tations pertain mostly to the pragmatic and the 
phonological levels, in order to calibrate incom-
ing data, but also, to a lesser extent, to the 
morphosyntactic and the syntactic levels. 

 

Thus, the first ontology built for DTA (namely 
the DTA Metadata Ontology) contains a formali-
zation of the DTA metadata, which is particular 
of this initiative and, hence, had to be built most-
ly from scratch. The second ontology (that is, the 
DTA Labels Ontology) includes a conceptualiza-
tion of the labels used to annotate DTA transcrip-
tions linguistically. Accordingly, it reuses other 
linguistic resources and ontologies. In particular, 
the OntoLingAnnot set of ontologies (Pareja-
Lora and Aguado de Cea, 2010; Pareja-Lora, 
2012a; Pareja-Lora 2012b; Pareja-Lora, 2013) 
has been reused to formalize the DTA pragmatic 
level labels, 21  including convenient links to 
ISOCat22

 categories and OWL equivalences with 
GOLD elements. This will help make the DTA 
ontologies become part of the Linguistic Linked 
Open Data (LLOD) cloud. Each of the ontologies 
is described below. 

The DTA Metadata Ontology contains the differ-
ent elements described in section 2. In its devel-
opment, we have followed as faithfully as possi-
ble the categorizations applied in developing the 
DTA. The top-level classes of this ontology are 
shown in Figure 1. 

                                                 
20 The resulting ontologies have been published under a 3-
clause BSD license at https://github.com/apareja/DTA_ 
Ontologies.

the code of its ontological modules), please contact the first 
author of this paper.

Figure 1: DTA Metadata Ontology – Main classes 

These top-level classes include the formaliza-
tion of some of the ten DTA basic categories 
presented in section 2 (namely Project, Da-
taset, Session and Transcription). The 
ones not shown in the figure are subclasses of 
one or several of the classes shown: Subject is 
rdfs:subClassOf Person; the classes formal-
izing recording, coding and coding set are sub-
classes of DTAObject and of ProjectObject; 
and Utterance and UtteranceCoding have 
been included in the DTA Labels Ontology (cf., 
next section). Other relevant items in the DTA, 
i.e. languages, are also represented at this level, 
by means of the class Language. 

The Project and ProjectObject classes 
have two main subclasses respectively, i.e., 
DTAProject and DTAProjectObject. They 
are the most prominent subclasses of this ontolo-
gy, as shown in Figure 2. Indeed, as shown in the 
figure, most of the concepts presented in sections 
2.1-2.4 have been represented as subclasses of 
these two concepts. 

The classes DTAInformationSection and 
DTAInfoTab are related by means of the object 
property HasPart in the ontology, that is, DTA-
InformationSection HasPart DTAInfo-
Tab. Thus, each of the tabs associated to the dif-
ferent sections of information have been straight-
forwardly formalized as subclasses of one of the 
subclasses of DTAInfoTab, namely Project-
MainInfoTab, ReferencesTab, Subjects-
Tab and DatasetTab. They are not exhaustive-
ly described here to avoid redundancy with sec-
tion 2. However, it is important to note that (1) 
the formalization of the ReferencesTab entailed 
the inclusion of a whole sub-ontology of aca-
demic objects, shown in Figure 3. 

38

DTAProjectObject main subclasses 

 
Figure 3: DTA Metadata Ontology –  
the AcademicObject sub-ontology 

All these classes have corresponding data 
properties attached, which represent the different 
text and menu fields used in DTA to assign val-
ues and annotations (cf. section 2). The resulting 
hierarchy of properties is partially shown in Fig-
ure 4. Also a number of object properties have 
been formalized in this ontology, but they are not 
described due to space limitations. 

5.2 The DTA Labels Ontology 
The DTA Labels Ontology includes the DTA 
elements discussed in section 3. They are used in 
the annotation of utterances in the DTA. We de-
cided to develop a separate ontology for these 

elements due to their more general nature and, 
hence, their higher reusability in all kinds of lin-
guistic annotation projects.  

 
Figure 4: DTA Metadata Ontology –  

The hierarchy of data properties 

In this case, since the DTA labels are a partic-
ular case of linguistic annotation, we reused oth-
er existing ontologies and repositories of catego-
ries for linguistic annotation, such as GOLD, 
DCR/ISOCat, OntoTag (Aguado de Cea et al., 
2002; 2004; Pareja-Lora, 2012c), and 
OntoLingAnnot. We kept the same criteria and 
methodologies of classification and subdivi-
sion applied in these other linguistic resources, 
making the DTA Labels Ontology more interop-
erable with them.23

                                                 
23 However, the formalization of the links and the equiva-
lences with e.g. GOLD and ISOCat is still ongoing. Where-
as GOLD entities are linked by means of 
owl:equivalentClass statements, ISOCat categories are 
linked by means of an ad-hoc defined data property, namely 
correspondsToISOCatDataCategory, whose value is an 
xsd:anyURI pointer to the category’s ISO persistent identi-
fier. A matching between the DTA ontologies with the 
FOAF (Friend Of A Friend) vocabulary (http://www.foaf-
project.org) and with the Dublin Core Metadata 
(http://dublincore.org/) is planned as well. All the matches 
found will be added subsequently to the DTA ontologies. 

 For example, we developed 
three separate taxonomies within the ontology, 
one for linguistic units, one for linguistic attrib-
utes (or features), and another one for the lin-
guistic values that these attributes can take. The 
super-classes of these taxonomies are, respec-

39



tively, LinguisticUnit, LinguisticAttri-
bute and Linguistic-Value, which have 
been imported from the OntoLingAnnot ontolo-
gies. 

Each of these taxonomies is linked to each 
other by the corresponding relation of the 
OntoLingAnnot model, namely: 
LinguisticUnit hasFeature Linguis-
ticAttribute, LinguisticAttribute 
takesValue LinguisticValue, Linguis-
ticValue isValueTakenBy Linguistic-
Attribute, LinguisticAttribute isAt-
tachedTo LinguisticUnit. 

We created a DTALabel class, which is a 
rdfs:subClassOf LinguisticAttribute. 
Most DTA labels are subclasses of DTALabel. 
We have only classified DTA glosses differently, 
since they are in fact the aggregation of a label 
(namely WordByWordGlossLabel or Gen-
eralGlossLabel, which are the subclasses of 
DTAGlossLabel – see below) and a value (the 
actual text provided as a gloss).  

Each DTALabel is a GlobalCoding or a 
ProjectSpecificCoding. The main sub-
classes of GlobalCoding are Basic-
LinguisticLabel (which has only one sub-
class, i.e. DTASyntacticLabel), Utterance-
TranscriptionLabel (whose subclasses are 
Context, DTAGlossLabel, Morphological-
CodingLabel and PhoneticTranscript-
ionLabel) and SpeechActLabel, whose sub-
classes detail the attributes that can be applied to 
Searle’s types of speech acts 
(luo:Assertive, 24  luo:Commissive, luo: 
Declaration, luo:Directive and luo: 
Expressive25

The main subclasses of Project-
SpecificCoding are isAdjectivalPhrase, 
isAdverbialPhrase, isFragment, isNoun-

) and have been classified accord-
ingly. 

The linguistic units included and/or import-
ed into the DTA Labels Ontology are the fol-
lowing: luo:PhonologicalUnit (whose main 
subclasses are luo:Phoneme, luo:Pro-
sodicUnit, luo:Syllable and luo:Utter-
ance), luo:MorphoSyntacticUnit (whose 
main subclasses are luo:Morphological-

OntoLingAnnot’s Linguistic Unit Ontology (LUO).

Unit, luo:SyntacticUnit and luo:Word), 
luo:SemanticUnit, luo:DiscourseUnit, 
luo:PragmaticUnit (which is one of the su-
perclasses of luo:SpeechAct in this ontology, 
together with luo:SpeechUnit), and 
luo:TextUnit (whose main subclasses relevant 
to DTA, are MorphologicalCoding, Phone-
ticTranscription, PhoneticTranscript-
ionSymbol, UtteranceTranscription and 
luo:Text).  

We have also imported the luo:Morpheme 
class, which is an rdfs:subClassOf 
luo:MorphologicalUnit, and several sub-
classes of luo:SyntacticUnit, such as 
luo:Clause, luo:Phrase (and some of its 
subclasses, i.e. luo:AdjectivalPhrase,  
luo:AdverbialPhrase, luo:NounPhrase 
and luo:PrepositionalPhrase) and Sen-
tence (together with some of its subclasses, i.e., 
ComplexSentence, CompoundSentence and 
SimpleSentence). We have also added a par-
ticular DTA rdfs:subClassOf luo:Syn-
tacticUnit (Fragment), which represents the 
syntactic projection of those transcribed utter-
ances that cannot be considered an instance of 
any of the other syntactic units. 

The main individuals of the DTA Labels On-
tology are members of the subclasses of 
SpeechActLabel; for example, Count-
ingLabel, GreetingLabel, NamingLabel, 
PolitenessLabel, SingingLabel, Pro-
miseLabel, QuestionLabel and YesOr-
NoOrOKLabel formalize the particular types of 
speech act labels available within the DTA (see 
footnotes 12 and 13). They are used for the 
subclassification and/or annotation of utterances 
as speech acts, for instance.   

Briefly, the DTA Label Ontology entities were 
categorized as LinguisticUnit, Linguist-
icAttribute or LinguisticValue sub-
classes or individuals, and they were also linked 
among them with suitable object properties, 
such as Has/PartOf, Labels/isLabelled-
With, hasSyntacticProjection/isSyn-
tacticProjectionOf, or hasTranscript-
ion/isTranscriptionOf. As shown in these 
examples, we declared an inverse property for 
each direct object property identified, in order to 
facilitate inferences. 

Overall, the most relevant characteristic of this 
categorization is that it allows for a formalization 
of DTA annotations as linguistic RDF triples, as 
in the OntoLingAnnot model. This will allow for 

40



a fairly straightforward conversion of DTA anno-
tations into RDF triples and, therefore, into 
linked (open) data. Some statistics about the 
number of classes, properties, data types, indi-
viduals and axioms included in these ontologies 
have been included in Table 1.

6 Summary and future work 
In this paper, we have presented the first steps 

in the transformation of the DTA metadata and 
labels into a Linguistic Linked Open Data re-
source. The main results of this work are the two 
ontologies presented in Section 5, which formal-
ize the DTA elements, described in Sections 2 
and 3. We have also provided a comparison in 
Section 4 that shows that this is, to the best of 
our knowledge, one of the most relevant and de-
tailed initiatives in the study and annotation of 
child language. 

A suitable integration and linking of DTA an-
notations with the annotations resulting from 
CHILDES or the LA is still pending. This would 
first require the formalization of the label map-
pings between DTA and CHILDES and the LA 
(already identified in Section 4) in the two ontol-
ogies presented here. 

Other future work might include a re-
engineering of the DTA to convert it into a se-
mantic portal, using Semantic Web technologies. 
This would allow us to produce automatically 
open linked data annotations in the future, in-
stead of (1) storing the annotations first in a da-
tabase; and then (2) transforming them into 
linked data. 

Even though it is in its initial stages, this col-
laboration has already produced two immediate 
outcomes: (i) the evaluation of the categories 
included in OntoLingAnnot’s ontologies against 
the resources in the DTA26

                                                 
26  For example, the inclusion of rdfs:subClassOf 
luo:SyntacticUnit (Fragment); cf. section 

 and (ii) the detection

particular, Figure 3. 

of inconsistencies and gaps in the annotations of 
linguistic elements in the DTA, with the defini-
tions in other linguistic resources. 27

 This two-
way evaluation follows an interdisciplinary ap-
proach (computational and linguistic) and will 
allow for the transformation of the existing DTA 
data into linked (open) data, using the items now 
formalized in the DTA Metadata Ontology and 
the DTA Labels Ontology, allowing future 
linked-data-based, data-intensive research. 
Moreover, since the OntoLingAnnot model is 
ISO conformant and aims at the interoperability 
of linguistic resources and annotations, it will 
lead to the standardization of the DTA in order to 
make it more interoperable.

27 For example, the DTA classifies sentences according to 
their structure into two types: complex and simple; and then 
subdivides complex sentences into those involving coordi-
nation and those involving subordination. This classification 
does not correspond to how sources such as the SIL Glossa-
ry (http://www-01.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOflinguistic 
Terms/) or OntoTag and OntoLingAnnot classify them. In 
these other resources, (1) complex sentence refers to sen-
tences including at least one main clause and at least one 
subordinate clause; and (2) compound sentence refers to 
sentences that consist of two or more coordinate clauses.
