Abstract

With the development of several multilin-
gual datasets used for semantic parsing,
recent research efforts have looked into the
problem of learning semantic parsers in a
multilingual setup (Duong et al., 2017; Su-
santo and Lu, 2017a). However, how to
improve the performance of a monolingual
semantic parser for a specific language by
leveraging data annotated in different lan-
guages remains a research question that is
under-explored. In this work, we present
a study to show how learning distributed
representations of the logical forms from
data annotated in different languages can
be used for improving the performance of
a monolingual semantic parser. We ex-
tend two existing monolingual semantic
parsers to incorporate such cross-lingual
distributed logical representations as fea-
tures. Experiments show that our proposed
approach is able to yield improved seman-
tic parsing results on the standard multilin-
gual GeoQuery dataset.

1 Introduction

Semantic parsing, one of the classic tasks in nat-
ural language processing (NLP), has been ex-
tensively studied in the past few years (Zettle-
moyer and Collins, 2005; Wong and Mooney,
2006, 2007; Liang et al., 2011; Kwiatkowski et al.,
2011; Artzi et al., 2015). With the development of
datasets annotated in different languages, learning
semantic parsers from such multilingual datasets
also attracted attention of researchers (Susanto and
Lu, 2017a). However, how to make use of such
cross-lingual data to perform cross-lingual seman-
tic parsing – using data annotated for one language
to help improve the performance of another lan-

QUERY : answer (RIVER)

guage remains a research question that is largely
under-explored.

Prior work (Chan et al., 2007) shows that se-
mantically equivalent words coming from differ-
ent languages may contain shared semantic level
information, which will be helpful for certain se-
mantic processing tasks. In this work, we pro-
pose a simple method to learn the distributed rep-
resentations for output structured semantic repre-
sentations which allow us to capture cross-lingual
features. Specifically, following previous work
(Wong and Mooney, 2006; Jones et al., 2012; Su-
santo and Lu, 2017b), we adopt a commonly used
tree-shaped form as the underlying meaning rep-
resentation where each tree node is a semantic
unit. Our objective is to learn for each semantic
unit a distributed representation useful for seman-
tic parsing, based on multilingual datasets. Figure
1 depicts an instance of such tree-shaped seman-
tic representations, which correspond to the two
semantically equivalent sentences in English and
German below it.

For such structured semantics, we consider each
semantic unit separately. We learn distributed rep-



674

resentations for individual semantic unit based on
multilingual datasets where semantic representa-
tions are annotated with different languages. Such
distributed representations capture shared infor-
mation cross different languages. We extend two
existing monolingual semantic parsers (Lu, 2015;
Susanto and Lu, 2017b) to incorporate such cross-
lingual features. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first work that exploits cross-lingual
embeddings for logical representations for seman-
tic parsing. Our system is publicly available at
http://statnlp.org/research/sp/.

2 Related Work

Many research efforts on semantic parsing have
been made, such as mapping sentences into
lambda calculus forms based on CCG (Artzi
and Zettlemoyer, 2011; Artzi et al., 2014;
Kwiatkowski et al., 2011), modeling dependency-
based compositional semantics (Liang et al., 2011;
Zhang et al., 2017), or transforming sentences
into tree structured semantic representations (Lu,
2015; Susanto and Lu, 2017b). With the de-
velopment of multilingual datasets, systems for
multilingual semantic parsing are also developed.
Jie and Lu (2014) employed majority voting to
combine outputs from different parsers for cer-
tain languages to perform multilingual semantic
parsing. Susanto and Lu (2017a) presented an ex-
tension of one existing neural parser, SEQ2TREE
(Dong and Lapata, 2016), by developing a shared
attention mechanism for different languages to
conduct multilingual semantic parsing. Such a
model allows two types of input signals: single
source SL-SINGLE and multi-source SL-MULTI.
However, semantic parsing with cross-lingual fea-
tures has not been explored, while many recent
works in various NLP tasks show the effective-
ness of shared information cross different lan-
guages. Examples include semantic role labeling
(Kozhevnikov and Titov, 2013), information ex-
traction (Wang et al., 2013; Pan et al., 2017; Ni
et al., 2017), and question answering (Joty et al.,
2017), which motivate this work.

Our work involves exploiting distributed out-
put representations for improved structured pre-
dictions, which is in line with works of (Srikumar
and Manning, 2014; Rocktäschel et al., 2014; Xiao
and Guo, 2015). The work of (Rocktäschel et al.,
2014) is perhaps the most related to this research.
The authors first map first-order logical statements

produced by a semantic parser or an information
extraction system into expressions in tensor calcu-
lus. They then learn low-dimensional embeddings
of such statements with the help of a given logical
knowledge base consisting of first-order rules so
that the learned representations are consistent with
these rules. They adopt stochastic gradient de-
scent (SGD) to conduct optimizations. This work
learns distributed representations of logical forms
from cross-lingual data based on co-occurrence in-
formation without relying on external knowledge
bases.

3 Approach

3.1 Semantic Parser

In this work, we build our model and conduct
experiments on top of the discriminative hybrid
tree semantic parser (Lu, 2014, 2015). The parser
was designed based on the hybrid tree represen-
tation (HT-G) originally introduced in (Lu et al.,
2008). The hybrid tree is a joint representation
encoding both sentence and semantics that aims
to capture the interactions between words and se-
mantic units. A discriminative hybrid tree (HT-D)
(Lu, 2014, 2015) learns the optimal latent word-
semantics correspondence where every word in
the input sentence is associated with a semantic
unit. Such a model allows us to incorporate rich
features and long-range dependencies. Recently,
Susanto and Lu (2017b) extended HT-D by attach-
ing neural architectures, resulting in their neural
hybrid tree (HT-D (NN)).

Since the correct correspondence between
words and semantics is not explicitly given in the
training data, we regard the hybrid tree represen-
tation as a latent variable. Formally, for each sen-
tence n with its semantic representation m from
the training set, we assume the joint representation
(a hybrid tree) is h. Now we can define a discrim-
inative log-linear model as follows:

PΛ(m|n) =
∑

h∈H(n,m)

PΛ(m,h|n)

=

∑
h∈H(n,m) e

FΛ(n,m,h)∑
m′,h′∈H(n,m′) e

FΛ(n,m′,h′))
(1)

FΛ(n,m,h)) = Λ · Φ(n,m,h)) (2)

whereH(n,m) returns the set of all possible joint
representations that contain both n and m exactly,
and F is a scoring function that is calculated as a

http://statnlp.org/research/sp/


675

dot product between a feature function Φ defined
over tuple (m, n, h) and a weight vector Λ.

To incorporate neural features, HT-D (NN) de-
fines the following scoring function:

FΛ,Θ(n,m,h)) = Λ · Φ(n,m,h) + GΘ(n,m,h)
(3)

where Θ is the set of parameters of the neural
networks and G is the neural scoring function
over the (n,m,h) tuple (Susanto and Lu, 2017b).
Specifically, the neural features are defined over
a fixed-size window surrounding a word in n
paired with its immediately associated semantic
unit. Following the work (Susanto and Lu, 2017b),
we denote the window size as J ∈ {0, 1, 2}.

3.2 Cross-lingual Distributed Semantic
Representations

A multilingual dataset used in semantic parsing
comes with instances consisting of logical forms
annotated with sentences from multiple different
languages. In this work, we aim to learn one
monolingual semantic parser for each language,
while leveraging useful information that can be
extracted from other languages. Our setup is as
follows. Each time, we train the parser for a tar-
get language and regard the other languages as
auxiliary languages. To learn cross-lingual dis-
tributed semantic representations from such data,
we first combine all data involving all auxiliary
languages to form a large dataset. Next, for each
target language, we construct a semantics-word
co-occurrence matrix M ∈ Rm×n (where m is the
number of unique semantic units, n is the number
of unique words in the combined dataset). Each
entry is the number of co-occurrences for a partic-
ular (semantic unit-word) pair. We will use this
matrix to learn a low-dimensional cross-lingual
representation for each semantic unit. To do so, we
first apply singular value decomposition (SVD) to
this matrix, leading to:

M = UΣV∗ (4)

where U ∈ Rm×m and V ∈ Rn×m are unitary
matrices, V∗ is the conjugate transpose of V, and
Σ ∈ Rm×m is a diagonal matrix. We truncate the
diagonal matrix Σ and left multiply it with U:

UΣ̃ (5)

where Σ̃ ∈ Rm×d is a matrix that consists of only
the left d columns of Σ, containing the d largest

singular values. We leave the rank d as a hyper-
parameter. Each row in the above matrix is a d-
dimensional vector, giving a low-dimensional rep-
resentation for one semantic unit. Such distributed
output representations can be readily used as con-
tinuous features in Φ(n,m,h).

3.3 Training and Decoding
During the training process, we optimize the ob-
jective function defined over the training set as:

L(Λ,Θ) =
∑
i

log
∑

h∈H(ni,mi)

eFΛ,Θ(ni,mi,h)

−
∑
i

log
∑

m′,h′∈H(ni,m′)

eFΛ,Θ(ni,m
′,h′) (6)

We follow the dynamic programming approach
used in (Susanto and Lu, 2017b) to perform effi-
cient inference, and follow the same optimization
strategy as described there.

In the decoding phase, we are given a new input
sentence n, and find the optimal semantic tree m∗:

m∗ = arg max
m,h∈H(n,m)

FΛ,Θ(n,m,h) (7)

Again, the above equation can be efficiently
computed by dynamic programming (Susanto and
Lu, 2017b).

4 Experiments and Results

4.1 Datasets and Settings
We evaluate our approach on the standard Geo-
Query dataset annotated in eight languages (Wong
and Mooney, 2006; Jones et al., 2012; Susanto and
Lu, 2017b). We follow a standard practice for
evaluations which has been adopted in the liter-
ature (Lu, 2014, 2015; Susanto and Lu, 2017b).
Specifically, to evaluate the proposed model, pre-
dicted outputs are transformed into Prolog queries.
An output is considered as correct if answers that
queries retrieve from GeoQuery database are the
same as the gold ones . The dataset consists of 880
instances. In all experiments, we follow the ex-
perimental settings and procedures in (Lu, 2014,

2015; Susanto and Lu, 2017b). In particular, we
use 600 instances for training and 280 for test and
set the maximum optimization iteration to 150. In
order to tune the rank d, we randomly select 80%
of the training instances for learning and use the
rest 20% for development. We report the value of
d for each language in Table 1 and the F1 scores
on the development set.

4.2 Results
We compare our models against different existing
systems, especially the two baselines HT-D (Lu,
2015) and HT-D (NN) (Susanto and Lu, 2017b)
with different word window sizes J ∈ {0, 1, 2}.

WASP (Wong and Mooney, 2006) is a semantic
parser based on statistical phrase-based machine
translation. UBL-S (Kwiatkowski et al., 2010) in-
duced probabilistic CCG grammars with higher-
order unification that allowed to construct general
logical forms for input sentences. TREETRANS
(Jones et al., 2012) is built based on a Bayesian
inference framework. We run WASP, UBL-S,
HT-G, UBL-S, SEQ2TREE and SL-SINGLE 1 for
comparisons. Note that there exist multiple ver-
sions of logical representations used in the GEO-
QUERY dataset. Specifically, one version is based
on lambda calculus expression, and the other is
based on the variable free tree-shaped represen-

1 Note that in Dong and Lapata (2016), they adopted a
different split – using 680 instances as training examples and
the rest 200 for evaluation. We ran the released source code
for SEQ2TREE (Dong and Lapata, 2016) over eight different
languages. For each language, we repeated the experiments
3 times with different random seed values, and reported the
average results as shown in Table 2 to make comparisons.
Likewise, we ran SL-SINGLE following the same procedure.

tation. We use the latter representation in this
work, while the SEQ2TREE and SL-SINGLE em-
ploy the lambda calculus expression. It was noted
in Kwiatkowski et al. (2010); Lu (2014) that evalu-
ations based on these two versions are not directly
comparable – the version that uses tree-shaped
representations appears to be more challenging.
We do not compare against (Jie and Lu, 2014) due
to their different setup from ours.2

Table 2 shows results that we have conducted
on eight different languages. The highest scores
are highlighted. We can observe that when dis-
tributed logical representations are included, both
HT-D and HT-D (NN) can lead to competitive
results. Specifically, when such features are in-
cluded, evaluation results for 5 out of 8 languages
get improved.

We found that the shared information cross dif-
ferent languages could guide the model so that it
can make more accurate predictions, eliminating
certain semantic level ambiguities associated with
the semantic units. This is exemplified by a real
instance from the English portion of the dataset:

Input: Which states have a river?
Gold: answer(state(loc(river(all))))
Output: answer(state(traverse(river(all))))
Output (+O): answer(state(loc(river(all))))

2 They trained monolingual semantic parsers. In the eval-
uation phase, they fed parallel text from different languages
to each individual semantic parser, then employed a majority
voting based ensemble method to combine predictions. Dif-
ferently, we train monolingual semantic parsers augmented
with cross-lingual distributed semantic information. In the
evaluation phase, we only have one monolingual semantic
parser. Hence, these two efforts are not directly comparable.

Figure 2: 2-D projection of learned distributed representations for semantics.

Here the input sentence in English is “Which
states have a river?”, and the correct output is
shown below the sentence. Output is the pre-
diction from HT-D (NN) and Output (+O) is the
parsing result given by HT-D (NN+O) where the
learned cross-lingual representations of semantics
are included. We observe that, by introducing our
learned cross-lingual semantic information, the
system is able to distinguish the two semantically
related concepts, loc (located in) and traverse
(traverse), and further make more promising pre-
dictions.

Interestingly, for German, the results become
much lower when such features are included, indi-
cating such features are not helpful in the learning
process when such a language is considered. Rea-
sons for this need further investigations. We note,
however, previously it was also reported in the lit-
erature that the behavior of the performance as-
sociated with this language is different than other
languages in the presence of additional features
(Lu, 2014).

4.3 Visualizing Output Representations
To qualitatively understand how good the learned
distributed representations are, we also visualize
the learned distributed representations for seman-
tic units. In the Figure 2, we plot the embed-
dings of a small set of semantic units which are
learned from all languages other than English.
Each representation is a 30-dimensional vector
and is projected into a 2-dimensional space us-
ing Barnes-Hut-SNE (Maaten, 2013) for visual-
ization. In general, we found that semantic units
expressing similar meanings tend to appear to-

gether. For example, the two semantic units STATE
: smallest one ( density (STATE)) and STATE :
smallest one ( population (STATE)) share simi-
lar representations. However, we also found that
occasionally semantic units conveying opposite
meanings are also grouped together. This reveals
the limitations associated with such a simple co-
occurrence based approach for learning distributed
representations for logical expressions.

5 Conclusions

In this paper, we empirically show that the dis-
tributed representations of logical expressions
learned from multilingual datasets for semantic
parsing can be exploited to improve the perfor-
mance of a monolingual semantic parser. Our
approach is simple, relying on an SVD over
semantics-word co-occurrence matrix for find-
ing such distributed representations for semantic
units. Future directions include investigating bet-
ter ways of learning such distributed representa-
tions as well as learning such distributed represen-
tations and semantic parsers in a joint manner.
