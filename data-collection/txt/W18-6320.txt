Abstract

A popular application of machine translation
(MT) is gisting: MT is consumed as is to
make sense of text in a foreign language.
Evaluation of the usefulness of MT for gist-
ing is surprisingly uncommon. The classical
method uses reading comprehension question-
naires (RCQ), in which informants are asked
to answer professionally-written questions in
their language about a foreign text that has
been machine-translated into their language.
Recently, gap-filling (GF), a form of cloze test-
ing, has been proposed as a cheaper alter-
native to RCQ. In GF, certain words are re-
moved from reference translations and read-
ers are asked to fill the gaps left using the
machine-translated text as a hint. This paper
reports, for the first time, a comparative evalu-
ation, using both RCQ and GF, of translations
from multiple MT systems for the same for-
eign texts, and a systematic study on the effect
of variables such as gap density, gap-selection
strategies, and document context in GF. The
main findings of the study are: (a) both RCQ
and GF clearly identify MT to be useful; (b)
global RCQ and GF rankings for the MT sys-
tems are mostly in agreement; (c) GF scores
vary very widely across informants, making
comparisons among MT systems hard, and (d)
unlike RCQ, which is framed around docu-
ments, GF evaluation can be framed at the sen-
tence level. These findings support the use of
GF as a cheaper alternative to RCQ.

1 Introduction

1.1 Machine translation for gisting

Machine translation (MT) applications fall in two
main groups: assimilation or gisting, and dissem-
ination. Assimilation refers to the use of the raw
MT output to make sense of foreign texts. Dis-
semination refers to the use of the MT output as
a draft translation that can be post-edited into a

publishable translation. The needs of both groups
of applications are quite different; for instance,
an otherwise perfect Russian to English transla-
tion but with no articles (some, a, the), is likely to
be fine for assimilation, but would need substan-
tial post-editing for dissemination. State-of-the-art
MT systems are however usually evaluated —even
if manually— (and optimized) with respect to their
ability to produce translations that resemble refer-
ences, regardless of the intended application for
the system.

Assimilation is by far the main use of MT
in number of words translated. It is either ex-
plicitly invoked, for instance, by visiting web-
pages such as Google Translate, or integrated into
browsers and social networks. Raw MT may
sometimes be the only feasible option,1 for in-
stance when dealing with user-generated content
or ephemeral material (such as product descrip-
tions in e-commerce).

1.2 Evaluation of MT for gisting

A straightforward (but costly) way to evaluate MT
for gisting measures the performance of target-
language readers in a text-mediated task —for
instance, a software installation task (Castilho
et al., 2014)— by using raw MT and compares it
with the performance reached using a professional
translation of the text.

However, there may be scenarios without an ob-
vious associated task: news, product and service
reviews, or literature. On the other hand, even
with a clear associated task, task completion eval-
uation is also quite expensive. It is therefore desir-
able to have alternative objective indicators which
work as good surrogates for actual task-oriented

1Twenty-five years ago, (Sager, 1993, p. 261) already
hinted at MT-only scenarios: “there may, indeed, be no single
situation in which either human or machine would be equally
suitable.”

success.
Some authors have proposed eye-tracking (Do-

herty and O’Brien, 2009; Doherty et al., 2010;
Stymne et al., 2012; Doherty and O’Brien, 2014;
Castilho et al., 2014; Klerke et al., 2015; Castilho
and O’Brien, 2016; Sajjad et al., 2016) as a mea-
sure of machine translation usefulness, but the
technique is expensive and the evidence gathered
is rather indirect and does not have a straightfor-
ward interpretation in terms of usefulness.

There are many methods in which informants
are asked to judge the quality of machine-
translated sentences, usually as regards their
monolingual fluency (nativeness, grammaticality),
their bilingual adequacy (how much of the infor-
mation in the source sentence is present in the
machine-translated sentence), or even monolin-
gual adequacy (how much of the information in
the reference sentence is present in the machine-
translated sentence); informants may be asked ei-
ther to directly assess MT outputs by giving values
to these indicators in a predetermined scale or to
rank a number of MT outputs for the same source
sentence (sometimes being asked to consider as-
pects such as adequacy, fluency, or both). Direct
assessments of adequacy and MT ranking are the
official evaluation procedure for the most recent
WMT translation shared task campaigns (Bojar
et al., 2016, 2017). Other researchers use post-task
questionnaires (Stymne et al., 2012; Doherty and
O’Brien, 2014; Klerke et al., 2015; Castilho and
O’Brien, 2016) to assess the perceived usefulness
of MT output.

Direct assessment, ranking or post-task ques-
tionnaire evaluation methods are clearly subjec-
tive and require informants to make “in vitro”
judgements about the quality of MT outputs, with-
out considering their usefulness for a specific “in
vivo”, real-world application.

1.3 Reading comprehension questionnaires

Reading comprehension questionnaires (RCQ), as
used in the assessment of foreign-language learn-
ing, are the standard approach to evaluate MT for
gisting that measures reader performance in re-
sponse to MT. Readers answer questions using
either a machine-translated or a professionally-
translated version of the source text and their per-
formance on the tests (i.e. to what extent they an-
swer questions correctly) using the two sets of
texts is then compared. RCQ are however quite

costly: a human translation is needed for a con-
trol group and questions need to be professionally
written and often manually marked.

RCQ has a long history as an MT evalua-
tion method. Tomita et al. (1993), Fuji (1999),
and Fuji et al. (2001) evaluate the informative-
ness or usefulness of English–Japanese MT by
using standardized English-as-a-foreign-language
RCQs (TOEFL, TOEIC) which have been ma-
chine translated into Japanese and they are some-
times capable of distinguishing MT systems.
Jones et al. (2005b), Jones et al. (2005a), Jones
et al. (2007), and Jones et al. (2009) use the struc-
ture of standardized language proficiency tests
(Defence Language Proficiency Test, Interagency
Language Roundtable) to evaluate the readabil-
ity of Arabic–English MT texts. MT’ed docu-
ments are found to be harder to understand than
professional translations, and that they may be
assigned an intermediate level of English profi-
ciency. Berka et al. (2011) collected a set of En-
glish short paragraphs in various domains, created
yes/no questions in Czech about them, and ma-
chine translated the English paragraphs into Czech
with different MT systems. They found that out-
puts produced by different MT systems lead to dif-
ferent accuracy in the annotators’ answers. Weiss
and Ahrenberg (2012) evaluate comprehension of
Polish–English translations using RCQ tests and
found that a text with more MT errors have less
correct answers than a text with fewer MT errors.
Finally, Stymne et al. (2012) use RCQ to vali-
date eye-tracking as a tool for MT error analy-
sis for English–Swedish. Interestingly, for one of
their systems, the number of correct answers in the
RCQ tests were higher than for the human transla-
tion. However, test takers were more confident in
answering questions about the human translations
than about the MT outputs.

In this paper we explore RCQ as a measure of
MT quality by using the CREG-mt-eval corpus
(Scarton and Specia, 2016). In contrast to previ-
ous work, this paper presents an evaluation of MT
quality based on open questions that have different
levels of difficulty (as presented in Section 2) for
a considerable amount of documents (36 in con-
trast to only 2 analysed by Weiss and Ahrenberg
(2012)).

1.4 An alternative: evaluation via gap-filling

An alternative approach to RCQs, gap filling
(GF), has been recently proposed (Trosterud and
Unhammer, 2012; O’Regan and Forcada, 2013;
Ageeva et al., 2015; Jordan-Núñez et al., 2017)
based on another typical way of measuring reading
comprehension: cloze (or closure) testing (Taylor,
1953). Instead of a question, readers get an incom-
plete sentence with one or more words replaced
by gaps, and are asked to fill the gaps. Indeed,
GF may be seen as equivalent to the answering of
simple reading comprehension questions: for in-
stance, a question like Who was the president of
the Green Party in 2011? would be equivalent to
the sentence with one gap In 2011, was
the president of the Green Party.

GF tasks are prepared by automatically punch-
ing gaps in reference sentences taken from a pro-
fessional translation of the source text. Infor-
mants are given the machine-translated sentence
as a “hint” for the gap-filling task; therefore, we
may view GF as a way of automatically generating
questions to evaluate the MT output. The evalua-
tion measure is the proportion of gaps that can be
successfully filled using MT as a hint. This can be
compared with the success rate in the case where
no hint (MT) is provided, to give an estimate of
the usefulness of MT output.

Note that cloze testing evaluation of machine
translation was attempted decades ago in a com-
pletely different readability setting: gaps were
then punched in machine-translated output and in-
formants tried to complete them without any fur-
ther hint (Crook and Bishop, 1965; Sinaiko and
Klare, 1972). This work was reviewed and ex-
tended later by Somers and Wild (2000). But fill-
ing gaps in machine-translated output may be un-
necessarily challenging and therefore make eval-
uation less adequate: for instance, informants
would sometimes have to fill gaps in disfluent or
ungrammatical text, which is much harder than
filling them in a fluent, professionally translated
reference, or, even in fluent output, a crucial con-
tent word that has been removed may be very hard
to guess unless the surrounding text is very redun-
dant. Moreover, the GF method described here has
an easier interpretation in terms of its analogy to
RCQ.

This paper systematically builds upon previous
work on GF to obtain experimental evidence that
gap-filling is a viable, lower-cost alternative to

RCQ evaluation. Its main contributions are:

• While Trosterud and Unhammer (2012),
O’Regan and Forcada (2013), and Ageeva et
al. (2015) used GF just to demonstrate the
usefulness of a single rule-based MT system
for each language pair studied, this paper,
like Jordan et al.’s (2017), performs a com-
parison of several MT systems for the same
language pair.

• Previous work (Trosterud and Unhammer,
2012; O’Regan and Forcada, 2013; Ageeva
et al., 2015; Jordan-Núñez et al., 2017) sim-
ply assumes the validity of GF as an evalu-
ation method for MT gisting, in some cases
arguing about its equivalence to RCQ. Ours
is the first work to actually compare GF and
RCQ evaluation of the same MT systems.

• Previous work used sentences (Trosterud and
Unhammer, 2012; O’Regan and Forcada,
2013; Ageeva et al., 2015) or short excerpts
of text (Jordan-Núñez et al., 2017), but did
not study the influence of a larger, document-
level machine-translated context around the
target sentence, as it is done here.

• This paper explores for the first time a gap-
positioning strategy based on an approximate
computation of gap entropy, and compares it
to random placing of gaps.

The paper is organized as follows: section 2
describes the design and implementation of both
evaluation methods, RCQ and GF; then section 3
reports and discusses the results obtained; and, fi-
nally, concluding remarks (section 4) close the pa-
per.

2 Methodology

2.1 Data and informants
We use an extended version of CREG-mt-eval
(Scarton and Specia, 2016), a version of the
expert-built CREG reading comprehension cor-
pus (Ott et al., 2012) for 2nd-language learners of
German. CREG was originally created to build
and evaluate systems that automatically correct
answers to open questions. CREG-mt-eval con-
tains 108 source (German) documents with differ-
ent domains, including literature, news, job ad-
verts, and others (on average 372 words and 33
sentences per document). The original documents

194



were machine-translated in December 2015 into
English using four systems: an in-house baseline2

statistical phrase-based Moses (Koehn et al., 2007)
system trained on WMT 2015 data (Bojar et al.,
2015), Google Translate,3 Bing4 and Systran.5

CREG-mt-eval also contains professional transla-
tions of a subset of 36 documents (90–1500 words)
as a control group to check whether the questions
are adequate for the task. All questions from the
CREG original questionnaires (in German) were
professionally translated to English. On average,
there are 8.8 questions per document.

The questions in CREG-mt-eval are classified
(Meurers et al., 2011) as: literal, when they can
be answered directly from the text and refer to
explicit knowledge, such as names, dates (79%
of the total number of questions); reorganization,
also based on literal text understanding, but requir-
ing the combination of information from different
parts of the text (12% of the total number of ques-
tions); and inference, which involve combining lit-
eral information with world knowledge (9% of the
total number of questions).

Following Scarton and Specia (2016), test tak-
ers (informants) for both GF and RCQ were fluent
English-speaking volunteers, staff and students at
the University of Sheffield, who were paid (with
a 10 GBP online gift certificate) to complete the
task.

2.2 Reading comprehension questionnaire
task

For the version of CREG-mt-eval used herein,
thirty informants were given a set of six doc-
uments each and answered three to five ques-
tions per document, using only the English doc-
ument (either machine- or human-translated) pro-
vided. Therefore, for each of the 36 original doc-
uments, questions were answered using each ma-
chine translation system or the human translation.
Each document was only evaluated by one infor-
mant. The original German document was not
given. The guidelines were similar to those used
in other reading comprehension tests: test takers
were asked to answer the questions based on the

document provided. They were also advised to
read the questions first and then look for the infor-
mation required on the text in order to speed up the
task. Questions in CREG-mt-eval were marked as
proposed by Ott et al. (2012): correct answer (1
mark), if the answer is correct and complete; extra
concept (0.75 marks), when incorrect additional
concepts are added; missing concept (0.5 marks),
when important concepts are missing; blend (0.25
marks) when there are both extra and missing con-
cepts; and incorrect (0 marks), when the answer is
incorrect or missing.

Given the marks and the type of question, RCQ
overall scores (f ) are calculated as:

f = α · 1
Nl

Nl∑

k=1

lk + β ·
1

Nr

Nr∑

k=1

rk + γ ·
1

Ni

Ni∑

k=1

ik,

where Nl, Nr and Ni are the number of literal, re-
organization and inference questions, respectively,
lk, rk and ik are real values between 0 and 1, ac-
cording to the mark of question k, and α, β and γ
are weights for the different types of questions.

We experiment with three different types of
scores: simple (same weight for all question types:
α = β = γ = 1.0), i.e. marks are averaged giv-
ing all questions the same importance; weighted,
i.e. marks are averaged using different weights for
different types of question (α = 1, β = 2 and
γ = 3);6 and literal, where only marks for literal
questions are used to compute the average qual-
ity score (α = 1, β = γ = 0). The last score is
interesting because literal questions are the most
similar to gap-filling problems and correspond to
almost 80% of the corpus and they should be eas-
ier to answer than other types. Therefore, prob-
lems in answering a literal question may be a sign
of a bad quality translation.

Figure 1 shows an example of the question-
naires presented to the test takers. In this example,
the first, second and last questions are inference
questions, whilst the third and fourth questions are
literal questions.

2.3 Gap filling task
Twenty different kinds of configurations were
used in problems posed to informants. Sixteen
configurations used the four MT systems to gen-
erate hints, in two modalities (showing the full

(10% or 20%). We added 4 additional configura-
tions with no hint, using the same two gap den-
sities, and with two different gap-selection strate-
gies (statistical language model entropy and ran-
dom).

are punched in order of decreasing entropy, disal-
lowing gaps at stop-words or punctuation, and en-
suring that two gaps are never consecutive or sep-
arated only by stop-words or punctuation.

To select important sentences for the test, for
each of the reference documents, the best single-
sentence summary was selected as the problem
sentence using GenSim.8

Each of 60 informants was given exactly one
problem per document. Problem configurations
were assigned such that each informant tackled at
least one problem in each configuration, and each
document was evaluated 3 times in each configu-
ration. The mean time per problem was about 1
minute.

To create the user interface for the task we mod-
ified9 Ageeva et al.’s (2015) version of an older

centage of text to be kept in the summary is reduced until it
contains a single sentence.

version (2014) of Federmann’s (2012) Appraise.10

Each problem was presented in Appraise in a sin-
gle screen, divided in three sections. The top of
each screen reminded informants about the objec-
tive of the task. Immediately below, a machine-
translated Hint text is provided for those 16 con-
figurations that have one. The sentence in the
hint text corresponding to the problem sentence
is highlighted when a complete document is pro-
vided. At the bottom of the screen, the Problem
sentence containing the gaps to be filled is pro-
vided. Figure 2 shows a screenshot of the inter-
face, where a whole machine-translated document
is shown as a hint, with the key sentence high-
lighted. The score for each problem and config-
uration is simply the ratio of correctly filled gaps.

3 Results

Table 1 shows, for each system, the averaged in-
formant performance (see Appendix A for details)
for the GF and RCQ quality scores explained pre-
viously; BLEU and NIST scores are also given as
a reference. In view that score distributions are
actually very far from normality, the usual signif-
icance tests (such as Welch’s t-test) are not ap-
plicable; therefore, statistical significances of dif-
ferences between RCQ and GF scores will be re-
ported throughout using the distribution-agnostic
Kolmogorov–Smirnov test.11 Note that previous
work in RCQ did not provide statistical signif-
icance when comparing different hinting condi-
tions, and that only Jordan et al. (2017) provided
that information for GF.

3.1 Reading comprehension questionnaire
scores

According to all three variations of RCQ scores,
and contrary to BLEU and NIST, Systran appears
to be better than the homebrew Moses. The RCQ
scores for the professionally translated documents
(’Human’ row on the table) are higher than those
for the best MT system, which shows that the
questions are answerable from the texts and that
informants did follow the guidelines as expected.

We also report the statistical significance of
score differences and find (a) the only statisti-
cally significant difference at α < 0.05 between
MT systems for any score type is between Google

10https://github.com/cfedermann/
Appraise

11https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/

and the homebrew Moses; (b) all three scores
of Bing, Google and Systran are statistically in-
distinguishable among them; (c) some (but not
all) scores obtained with the professional transla-
tion are not statistically different from those ob-
tained with Google, Bing or Systran MT output;
and (d) all three scores obtained with the profes-
sional translation are statistically distinguishable
from those with Moses output.

3.2 Gap-filling

Gap placement strategy: Filling of gaps in the
absence of a hint was done in two configurations:
one where gaps were punched at random, and one
where gaps were punched where LM entropy was
maximum. Entropy appears to make gap filling
more difficult in the absence of hints (19.6% vs.
25.8% success rate) The value of pKS = 0.081,
above the customaryα = 0.05 significance thresh-
old, would however tentatively support our use of
entropy-selected gaps in all situations where MT
was used as a hint.

Comparing MT systems: Taking all MT sys-
tems together, one can see that the success rate
(58%) is, as expected, 3 times larger than that ob-
tained without MT using the entropy-driven gap
placing strategy (19%) and this difference is statis-
tically significant. The homebrew Moses system is
the least helpful (55.9%), and Bing the most help-
ful (62.6%), but the only statistically significant
difference is between these two (pKS = 0.005)
and between Bing and Systran (pKS = 0.044).
Even with 432 problems solved for each system,
MT systems were hard to distinguish by success
rate (Jordan et al. (2017) report clearer differ-
ences between systems, but the paper does not
clarify whether they are running the same prob-
lems through all MT systems to ensure the inde-
pendence of their comparisons).

Figure 3 shows box-and-whisker plots of the
distribution of performance across all 60 infor-
mants for each MT system. The large overlap ob-
served among the four MT systems illustrates how
hard it is to simply average gap-filling scores to
evaluate them.

Even if annotators are quite different, each one
of them may still be consistent in the relative
scores they give to different MT systems. Plot-
ting the average score each informant gives to
each MT system against their average score for all
systems after removing four clearly outlying in-

Table 1: A comparison of BLEU and NIST scores, RCQ marks in the three possible weightings, and GF success rates at
different densities.

formants, Pearson correlations are only moderate
(ranging between 0.47 and 0.73), and the slopes
asystem of line fits of the form score(system) =
asystemscore(all) show the same ranking as aver-
age scores: ahomebrew = 0.95, aSystran = 0.97,
aGoogle = 1.00, aBing = 1.06, but are very close
to each other and their confidence intervals over-
lap substantially.

Effect of context: In half of the configurations
with MT hints, a single machine-translated sen-
tence was shown; in the other half, the whole
machine-translated document was shown as a hint.
The results indicate that extended context, instead
of helping, seems to make the task slightly more
difficult (58.3% vs. 59.5% success rate), but dif-
ferences are not statistically significant; therefore,
GF scores in Table 1 are average scores obtained
with and without context. This supports evaluation

through simpler GF tasks based on single-sentence
hints.

Effect of gap density: Gaps were punched with
two different densities, 10% and 20%, to check
if a higher gap density would make the problem
harder. Contrary to intuition, the task becomes
easier when gap density is higher, and the result
is statistically significant (pKS < 0.001). This
unexpected result is however easily explained as
follows: problems with 20% gap density contain
all of the high-entropy gaps present in 10% prob-
lems, plus additional lower-entropy gaps, which
are easier to fill successfully, and therefore, the
average success rate rises. In the no-hint situa-
tion, however, as shown in Table 1, higher densi-
ties would seem to make the problem harder, per-
haps because the only information available to fill
the gaps comes from the problem sentence itself,

and higher gap densities substantially reduce the
number of available content words in the sentence.
However, the differences are not statistically sig-
nificant.

Gap density and MT evaluation: When com-
paring MT systems using only the 10% gap den-
sity problems, no differences are found to be sta-
tistically significant. This means that for very hard
gaps, systems would appear to behave similarly.
When selecting a value of 20% for the gap density
(some easier gaps are included), Bing and Google
do appear to be significantly better than the home-
brew Moses.

Inter-annotator agreement: As 3 different in-
formants filled the gaps for exactly the same set
of problems and configurations, with 20 such sets
available, we studied the pairwise Pearson corre-
lation r of their GF success in each of the 36 prob-
lems.12 All values of r were found to be positive,
averaging around 0.58, a sign of rather good inter-
annotator agreement. After removing two outlying
informants (r < 0.1), results did not appreciably
change.

Allowing for synonyms: The GF success scores
reported thus far have been computed by giving
credit only to exact matches. We have studied
giving credit to synonyms observed in informant
work, namely to those appearing at least twice (in
the work of all informants) that, according to one

set, but rather numerical success rates.

of the authors, preserved the meaning of the prob-
lem sentence, or were trivial spelling or case vari-
ations. A total of 124 frequent valid substitutions
were considered. As expected, GF success rates
(see table 2) increase considerably, for example,
from 22.7% to 32.2% for no hint, or from 58.9% to
75.5% for all systems averaged. The relative rank-
ing of MT systems is maintained; the statistical
significance of the homebrew Moses results ver-
sus Bing results is maintained, and two additional
statistically significant differences appear: Google
vs. homebrew Moses and Systran vs. homebrew
Moses. The statistical significance of the effect
of gap density disappears when allowing for syn-
onyms. This indicates that it would be beneficial
to assign credit to synonyms if the necessary lan-
guage resources are available or if further analysis
of actual GF results is feasible.

3.3 Correlation between GF and RCQ

One of our main goals was to explore whether
GF would be able to reproduce the results of the
established method in the field, RCQ. Table 1
shows reasonable agreement between RCQ and
GF scores: both give the homebrew Moses system
the worst score, and commercial statistical sys-
tems (Bing and Google) get the best scores. Also,
as commonly found for subjective judgements (for
example, Callison-Burch et al. (2006)), BLEU and
NIST penalize the rule-based Systran system with
respect to the statistical homebrew system, while
measurements of human performance do not, but
the differences observed are however not statisti-
cally significant.

Table 2: Effect in success rates of allowing for synonyms in GF

On the other hand, GF and RCQ scores assigned
to specific (document, MT system) pairs show low
correlation. This may be due to the scarcity of
RCQ data (only one data point per document–MT
system pair, as compared to of 12 data points for
GF), or to the fact that, while RCQ takes the whole
document into account, GF only looks at a specific
sentence. In addition, the RCQ tests and the sen-
tence selected for GF for a given document may
not directly correspond, i.e. the information re-
quired from the document to answer the RCQ tests
may differ from the information required to fill the
gaps in a given sentence. This happens because
the comprehension questions may target different
parts of the text and do not require the sentence
selected by our GF approach. A natural follow up
of this work is to use sentences for GF directly re-
lated to the RCQ tests.

4 Concluding remarks

We have compared two methods for the evalu-
ation of MT in gisting applications: the well-
established method using reading comprehension
questionnaires and an alternative method: gap fill-
ing. While RCQ require the manual preparation
of questionnaires for each document, and grading
of answers to open questions, GF is cheaper, as
it only needs reference translations for one or a
few sentences in each document and both ques-
tions and scores can be obtained automatically. GF
is fast and easily crowdsourceable.

In GF, without a hint, we found that entropy-
selected gaps appear to be harder than random
gaps. We therefore recommend using entropy-
selected gaps to discourage guesswork and incen-
tivize annotators to rely on the MT hints. Provid-
ing the whole machine-translated document as a
hint does not seem to help as compared with pro-

viding only the machine-translated version of the
problem sentence. This would suggest the possi-
bility of framing GF evaluation around single sen-
tences.

RCQ scores obtained using a machine-
translated text range between 70% and 95% of the
scores obtained using a professionally-translated
text. In GF, the presence of a machine-translated
text clearly improves performance (by about
3 times). Both results are a clear indication of the
usefulness of raw MT in gisting applications.

Both RCQ and GF rank a low-quality home-
brew Moses system worst, but differ as regards the
best MT system, although differences are not al-
ways statistically significant. It would seem as if
informants make do with any MT system regard-
less of small differences in quality. The discrimi-
native power of RCQ and GF evaluations is, how-
ever, quite low; this may be due to the scarcity
of data; if one expects that the collection of larger
amounts of human evaluation data (like the crowd-
sourced direct assessment (judgement) results de-
scribed by Bojar et al. (2016)) would increase the
discriminative power of the evaluation method,
this would be much more feasible using GF, than
the more costly RCQ.
