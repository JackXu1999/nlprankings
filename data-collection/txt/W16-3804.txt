Abstract

An excellent example of a phenomenon bridging a lexicon and a grammar is provided by gram-
maticalized alternations (e.g., passivization, reflexivity, and reciprocity): these alternations rep-
resent productive grammatical processes which are, however, lexically determined. While gram-
maticalized alternations keep lexical meaning of verbs unchanged, they are usually characterized
by various changes in their morphosyntactic structure.

In this contribution, we demonstrate on the example of reciprocity and its representation in the
valency lexicon of Czech verbs, VALLEX how a linguistic description of complex (and still sys-
temic) changes characteristic of grammaticalized alternations can benefit from an integration of
grammatical rules into a valency lexicon. In contrast to other types of grammaticalized alterna-
tions, reciprocity in Czech has received relatively little attention although it closely interacts with
various linguistic phenomena (e.g., with light verbs, diatheses, and reflexivity).

1 Introduction

Contemporary linguistic theories usually divide a language description into two components, a lexicon
and a grammar. The grammar consists of general patterns rendered in the form of formal rules that are
applicable to whole classes of language units. The lexicon, on the other hand, represents an inventory
of language units with their specific properties. Nevertheless, the distribution of linguistic information
between the grammar and the lexicon is not given by the language itself but it is purely an empirical
issue. Thus linguistic frameworks can substantially differ from each other in the design of the grammar
and the lexicon. In some theories a central role is performed by the grammar component, e.g., Chom-
skyan generative transformational grammar (Chomsky, 1965), while others put emphasis on the lexical
component, e.g., the Lexical-Functional Grammar (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982), the Head-Driven Phrase
Structure Grammar (Pollard and Sag, 1994), and the Meaning-Text Theory (Mel’čuk, 1988).

There are several linguistic phenomena, e.g., agreement and semantics, which are consistently treated
across various linguistic theories either in the grammar or lexical component, respectively. However,
a language is typically abundant with borderline phenomena whose treatment either as grammatical or
as lexical ones is strongly theory dependent. Moreover, some phenomena represent products of a close
interaction between the grammar and the lexicon. An excellent example of linguistic phenomena bridg-
ing these components is provided by grammaticalized alternations, e.g., passive, reflexive and reciprocal
alternations. These alternations represent fully (or almost fully) productive grammatical processes which
are, however, lexically determined.

Grammaticalized alternations typically preserve lexical meaning and deep syntactic structure of verbs;
however, they are characterized by various changes in surface syntactic structures. Morphologically rich
languages provide an excellent opportunity to study grammaticalized alternations as the surface syntac-
tic changes are manifested by changes in morphological expressions of the valency complementations
affected by the alternations, as can be illustrated by examples with the Czech verb potkat ‘meet’ in (1).
The deep syntactic structure of this verb is formed by two valency complementations ‘Actor’ (ACT) and

‘Patient’ (PAT), which are expressed in the unmarked structure of grammaticalized alternations (active,
unreciprocal and irreflexive) as subject in the nominative and direct object in the accusative, respectively
(1b). This verb allows for the reciprocity of ACT and PAT, see (1c). Comparing with the unreciprocal
structure in (1b), this structure is characterized by the following changes: (i) as subject, coordinated ACT
in the nominative is expressed; this results in the change in verb agreement, and (ii) the direct object po-
sition corresponding to PAT is occupied by the clitic reflexive pronoun se expressed in the accusative;
this reflexive pronoun corefers with the subject position.

Despite the changes in unreciprocal and reciprocal structures of the verb potkat ‘meet’, the meaning of
the verb remains unchanged: in both structures, it denotes the same situation when two or more individu-
als accidentally or intentionally come together. Thus these changes cannot be explained as a consequence
of polysemy of the given verb. The main difference between unreciprocal and reciprocal structures of
this verb rather lies in the fact that the reciprocal structure (unlike the unreciprocal one) denotes complex
event involving two propositions, which can be describe in the following way: Peter met Claire in the
theater and at the same time Claire met Peter in the theater. This semantics is characteristic of reciprocal
structures in general (Evans et al., 2007).

While the surface syntactic formation of marked structures of grammaticalized alternations (passive,
reflexive and reciprocal structures) is typically regular enough to be described by grammatical rules,
a possibility to create these structures is lexically conditioned, i.e., this possibility is primarily given
by the lexical meaning of verbs and thus it cannot be deduced from their deep and/or surface syntactic
structures alone. For example, both the verbs potkat ‘meet’ and absolvovat ‘undergo’ are characterized
by the same valency frames. However, only the former verb forms reciprocal structures, the latter one
does not allow for reciprocity, see examples (1) and (2). The information on applicability of individual
grammaticalized alternations thus must be stored in the lexicon.

In this contribution, we demonstrate on the example of reciprocity and its representation in the valency
lexicon of Czech verbs, VALLEX how the linguistic description of complex (and still systemic) changes
characteristic of grammaticalized alternations can benefit from the integration of grammatical rules into
a valency lexicon.

Let us stress that the representation of reciprocity proposed in this paper is restricted to reciprocity of
verbs. However, reciprocity is characteristic of other parts-of-speech as well, esp. of nouns, e.g., dohoda
jedné válčı́cı́ strany s druhou stranou ‘an agreement of one warring party with the other’ vs. dohoda
mezi válčı́cı́mi stranami ‘an agreement between warring parties’. Reciprocity of nouns has received little
attention so far. Further, the interplay between reciprocity on the one hand and diatheses or reflexivity
on the other is left aside here; this issue has not been sufficiently explored yet as well although their
interactions brought about specific changes in surface syntactic structures. For example, in Czech, in
contrast to the valency complementations involved in reciprocity in active light verb constructions, the
valency complementations in reciprocity in passive light verb constructions have a strong tendency to
be expressed as the valency complementations of nouns, e.g., Dosud nebyla uzavřena dohoda válčı́cı́ch

19

dosud nebyla uzavřena dohoda. ‘An agreement has not been made by warring party yet.’

2 Related Work

Grammaticalized alternations have been treated in the linguistic description of many languages as pro-
ductive grammatical processes, the applicability of which can be fully predicted from syntactic structure
of verbs. Thus their description entirely relies on the grammar alone, leaving the lexicon aside. As
a result, an explicit representation of grammaticalized alternations of verbs is still missing in most con-
temporary lexical resources. Reciprocity, which serves here as an illustrative example of grammatical-
ized alternations, does not represent any exception. Although reciprocity is cross-linguistically attested
as a widespread phenomenon, see esp. (Nedjalkov, 2007; König and Gast, 2008), from the important
lexical resource, only FrameNet1 introduces the information on reciprocity in the form of the non-lexical
semantic frame ‘Reciprocality’; this frame indicates that its daughter frames are endowed with frame
elements that can be used symmetrically. However, FrameNet does not provide any systematic way for
deriving reciprocal structures. Similarly, despite being based on Levin’s classification of verbs within
which reciprocity of English verbs is described in detail (Levin, 1993), VerbNet2 does not explicitly
distinguish between reciprocal structures and unreciprocal ones.

Reciprocity of Czech verbs has been theoretically elaborated within the Functional Generative De-
scription in (Panevová, 1999; Panevová, 2007; Panevová and Mikulová, 2007). In these studies, the
representation of reciprocity in a lexicon has been proposed as well. The theoretical results has been
then applied in the Prague Dependency Treebank, and in the VALLEX lexicon, see Section 3. The sys-
tematic rule description of morphosyntactic changes brought about reciprocity has been introduced in
(Skoumalová, 2001), (Urešová, 2011), and (Kettnerová et al., 2012b; Lopatková et al., 2016).

3 VALLEX and FGD

In this section, we describe main tenets of valency theory of the Functional Generative Description within
which we formulate a representation of grammaticalized alternations. The proposed representation is
then applied in the valency lexicon of Czech verbs, VALLEX3 (Lopatková et al., 2016). The main output
is a qualitatively and quantitatively enhanced version of this lexicon available for human users as well as
for NLP applications which allows for obtaining all surface manifestations of Czech verbs.

The Functional Generative Description (FGD)4 represents a stratificational dependency-oriented the-
oretical framework, see esp. (Sgall et al., 1986). Valency – as one of the core concepts – is related
primarily to the tectogrammatical (deep syntactic) layer of the linguistic description, i.e., the layer of
linguistically structured meaning, esp. (Panevová, 1994). Valency structure of verbs is captured in the
form of valency frames. According to a main descriptive principle of the valency theory of FGD, dif-
ferences in valency frames correlate with differences in lexical meaning; thus each meaning of a verb
should be characterized by a single valency frame. As grammaticalized alternations bring about changes
in valency frames of a verb while preserving its lexical meaning, they collide with this principle. We
further demonstrate how this collision can be overcome when we carefully distribute the information on
grammaticalized alternations between the lexicon and the grammar.

The valency theory of FGD has been applied in several valency lexicons, VALLEX, PDT-Vallex
(Urešová, 2011),5 and EngVallex (Urešová et al., 2016).6 VALLEX, being the most elaborated one,
forms a solid basis for the lexical component of FGD. For the purpose of representation of grammati-
calized alternations, VALLEX is divided into a lexical part (i.e., the data component) and a grammatical
part (i.e., the grammar component) (Kettnerová et al., 2012a).

Data component. The data component consists of an inventory of lexical units of verbs (correspond-
ing to their individual meanings) with their respective valency frames underlying their deep syntactic
structures. Each valency frame is modeled as a sequence of frame slots corresponding to valency com-
plementations of a verb labeled by (rather coarse-grained) tectogrammatical roles such as ‘Actor’ (ACT),
‘Patient’ (PAT), ‘Addressee’ (ADDR), ‘Effect’ (EFF), ‘Direction’, ‘Location’, ‘Manner’, etc. Further,
the information on obligatoriness and on possible morphological forms is specified for each valency
complementation. The valency frames stored in the data component describe unmarked structures of
grammaticalized alternations (i.e., active, unreciprocal, irreflexive). In addition to information on vari-
ous other syntactic properties, each lexical unit of a verb bears information on the possibility to create
marked syntactic structures of grammaticalized alternations (i.e., passive, reciprocal and reflexive).

The data component of VALLEX stores valency information on 2 722 verb lexemes (associating lex-
ical units and verb forms of a verb). These verb lexemes are represented by 4 586 verb lemmas and
describe 6 711 lexical units (VALLEX thus covers more than 96% of verb occurrences in the sub-corpus
of the Czech National Corpus SYN2000).7

Grammar component. The grammar component represents a part of the overall grammar of Czech.
It stores formal rules directly related to valency structure of verbs. These rules allow users to derive
marked structures of grammaticalized alternations (i.e., passive, reciprocal or reflexive).8 Let us stress
that grammaticalized alternations typically preserve deep syntactic structures of lexical units of verbs,
i.e., the number and type of their valency complementations remain unchanged; it is their morphosyn-
tactic structure that changes. These changes are manifested by changes in morphological forms of the
valency complementations affected by grammaticalized alternations. The rules contained in the grammar
component thus describe the systemic changes in morphological forms of the given valency complemen-
tations. Further, these rules can determine changes in lexical expressions of valency complementations
involved in grammaticalized alternations.

In the current stage of the project, the grammar component of VALLEX stores rules for the following
grammaticalized alternations:
• Diatheses. Diatheses represent a core type of grammaticalized alternations. In Czech linguistics,

five types of diatheses are distinguished (Panevová et al., 2014): passive, deagentive, resultative,
dispositional and recipient passive diatheses; they are covered by 17 formal rules, detailed descrip-
tion can be found in (Lopatková et al., 2016).
• Reflexivity. Reflexivity represents a peripheral type of grammaticalized alternations in Czech (Ket-

tnerová et al., 2014). Reflexive structures denote the actions which ACT performs on himself; thus
two valency complementations – one of which being expressed as subject – share the same refer-
ence, e.g., PetrACT se viděl v zrcadle. ≈ PetrACT viděl sám sebePAT (= Petra PAT) v zrcadle. ‘PeterACT saw
himselfPAT in the mirror.’ In VALLEX, reflexivity is covered by 4 formal rules.
• Reciprocity. Reciprocity (similarly as reflexivity) represents a peripheral type of grammaticalized

alternations; on reciprocity we further illustrate the representation of grammaticalized alternations
in VALLEX, see the following Section 4.

4 Reciprocity

The description of reciprocity (as well as other types of grammaticalized alternations) may benefit from
the distinction between a situational meaning and a structural meaning. The situational meaning portrays
a situation described by a lexical unit of a verb which is characterized by a set of situational participants

7http://ucnk.ff.cuni.cz/
8In this contribution, we leave aside lexicalized alternations. These alternations associate pairs of lexical units of verbs

characterized by systemic shifts in their lexical meaning which are exhibited across groups of semantically similar verbs.
Changes in surface syntactic structures of these lexical units result from changes in their deep structures. For example, two
lexical units of the verb znı́t ‘sound’ (e.g., Sálem znı́ chorál. ‘A choral singing sounds in the hall.’ – Sál znı́ chorálem. ‘The hall
sounds with choral singing.’) manifest similar changes in their deep and surface syntactic structures as lexical units of the verbs
hučet ‘roar’, chrastit ‘rattle’, bzučet ‘buzz’, blýskat se ‘shine’, vonět ‘smell’, etc. For representation of lexicalized alternations
in VALLEX see esp. (Kettnerová et al., 2012a).

related by particular relations (Mel’čuk, 2004; Apresjan, 1992).9 This type of the verbal meaning can
be characterized by semantic roles, by lexical conceptual structures, by semantic graphs, etc. For the
purpose of simplification, we further describe the situational meaning by a set of semantic roles assigned
to situational participants; we explicitly call attention to relations among participants only where it is
relevant. As for the structural meaning, it represents a structural part of the meaning of a lexical unit
of a verb – in FGD, it corresponds to the valency frame and its members are represented by individual
valency complementations.

Grammaticalized alternations differ from each other in systemic changes in the correspondence be-
tween situational participants and valency complementations and their mapping onto surface syntactic
positions. Reciprocity is characterized by a symmetrical relation into which two situational participants
enter;10 as a result of this symmetry, each valency complementation onto which these two situational
participants are mapped in unreciprocal structure corresponds to both situational participants at the same
time. Despite the complex correspondence between situational participants and valency complemen-
tations, the mapping of valency complementations onto surface syntactic positions is maintained, see
Figure 1.

Figure 1: Correspondence among situational participants, valency complementations and their morpho-
logical forms for example (3); the solid lines mark the correspondence in the unreciprocal structure, the
dashed lines mark the correspondence in the reciprocal structure.

The symmetrical relation between two situational participants expressed in reciprocal structures has
specific morphological and lexical markers. First, the surface position that is more prominent – proto-
typically subject (if subject is not involved, it is direct object) – has a plural meaning. This meaning can
be expressed syntactically as coordination, morphologically as plural, or lexically as a collective noun.
Second, the less prominent surface syntactic position is lexically expressed by the reflexive pronoun
coreferring with the more prominent surface position.Reciprocity in Czech has thus the same marking
as reflexivity; however, additional grammatical and/or lexical markers usually disambiguate between
reciprocity and reflexivity, see also the comment on reciprocity and reflexivity at the end of this Section.

Let us exemplify the above described changes in morphosyntactic structure of reciprocal constructions
on the verb svěřovat ‘to entrust’, example (3). The situational meaning of this verb is characterized by
three situational participants: ‘Agent’, ‘Recipient’ and ‘Theme’; its structural meaning is described by
the valency frame consisting of three valency complementations: ACT, ADDR, and PAT (3a). In un-
reciprocal constructions, each situational participant corresponds to a single valency complementation
(‘Agent’ to ACT, ‘Recipient’ to ADDR, and ‘Theme’ to PAT), see Figure 1 and example (3b). In re-
ciprocal constructions, ‘Agent’ and ‘Recipient’ enter into symmetry; as a result, ACT and ADDR with
which ‘Agent’ and ‘Recipient’ are linked in unreciprocal structure, respectively, correspond to both these

9Such part of the verbal meaning is not syntactically structured, see esp. (Mel’čuk, 2004). Following the FGD principles,
we do not formalize the concept of situational meaning here; instead, we use just intuitive and informal labels for situational
participants.

10Rarely triplets of situational participants are in symmetry, e.g., Petr, Jan a Pavel se sobě navzájem představili. ‘Peter, John
and Paul introduced themselves to each other.’. We leave these more complex cases of reciprocity aside here.

participants at the same time. Nevertheless, the mapping of ACT and ADDR onto surface syntactic po-
sition remains unchanged: ACT is still expressed as subject and ADDR as indirect object (3c) and (3d).
In these reciprocal structures, the reciprocal relation between situational participants and their complex
mapping onto valency complementations are grammatically marked (i) by the plural meaning of the sub-
ject position encoded by coordination (paratactic in (3c) or hypotactic in (3d)), and (ii) by the reflexive
pronoun expressed in the indirect position, which corefers with subject.

However, the reflexive pronoun, as one of the grammatical markers of reciprocity, is not prototypically
expressed with the verbs that bear the feature of reciprocity in their lexical meanings, see (4c) and (5c).

Example (5) illustrates the above described changes in morphosyntactic structure of reciprocal con-
structions when subject is not involved. The reciprocity is grammatically marked by the plural meaning
of the direct object position expressing PAT; in this case, the indirect position of EFF is not expressed
on the surface (and the reciprocal interpretation is thus often stressed by lexical expressions like spolu
‘together’ or vzájemně ‘each other’).

In the data component of the VALLEX lexicon, the information on the possibility of a lexical unit of
a verb to create reciprocal constructions is recorded in the attribute ‘reciprocity’ assigned to the given
lexical unit; the value of this attribute is the pair (or triplet in exceptional cases) of the valency com-
plementations involved in reciprocity (e.g., ACT-PAT for potkat ‘meet’ (1a), ACT-ADDR for svěřovat
‘entrust’ (3a) and diskutovat ‘discuss’ (4a), and PAT-EFF for porovnat ‘compare’ (5a)).

In VALLEX, reciprocity is indicated with more than 30% of lexical units of verbs, see Table 1; the
vast majority belongs to the reciprocity affecting subject as the more prominent position. Let us stress
that a single lexical unit may create reciprocal constructions involving different pairs of valency comple-
mentations, as is exemplified by (6).

Comment on reciprocity and reflexivity: With verbs allowing for reciprocity alongside with syntactic
reflexivity, the lexical expressions bearing reciprocal meaning disambiguate between reciprocal and re-
flexive structures. For example, the Czech sentence in (6d) can be interpreted either as reciprocal (‘John
and his wife lied to the judge about each other’), or as reflexive (‘John and his wife lied to the judge about
themselves’); its homonymy can be eliminated by the presence of the lexical marker (e.g., vzájemně ‘each
other’). The formal overlap between markers of reciprocity and reflexivity is not limited to Czech but it
is attested as a pervasive cross-linguistic phenomenon, see (Maslova, 2008).

5 System of Rules for Reciprocity in VALLEX

Reciprocity, as one of productive grammatical processes, can be described by grammatical rules. Let
us demonstrate the system of rules characterizing changes in reciprocal surface syntactic structures of
lexical units of verbs, as they are captured in the grammar component of VALLEX. We illustrate this
system on one of the core types of reciprocity, on reciprocity involving ACT and ADDR (e.g., (3c), (3d)
and (4c)); this type of reciprocity is indicated in the data component of the lexicon with 614 lexical units
of verbs. The proposed rules – applied to the valency frames stored in the data component of the lexicon
– allow for the derivation of grammatical patterns describing reciprocal structures. In case of reciprocity
involving ACT and ADDR, two rules are successively applied to the relevant valency frames: the basic
rule and one of the set of supplementary rules.

• The basic rule. The basic rule describes changes common for all lexical units of verbs allowing
for the given type of reciprocity, namely a plural meaning of ACT and the resulting change in
subject-verb agreement, see Figure 2.
• The supplementary rules. There are six supplementary rules formulated for reciprocity involving

ACT and ADDR; their choice depends on the morphological form of ADDR; the overview of sup-
plementary rules is given in Figure 3. These rules determine the morphological form of the reflexive
pronoun expressing ADDR. Further, lexical expressions stressing reciprocal meaning are specified
as their choice is conditioned by the form of ADDR.

Let us demonstrate one of the supplementary rules in more detail, see Figure 4 and example (7). This
rule is applied to lexical units of verbs under the following conditions: they have the value ACT-ADDR in
the attribute reciprocity (recipr: ACT-ADDR), their ADDR is in the dative (ADDR(dative)), and they are

represented by the reflexive lemmas (SE|SI).11 The rule determines that in reciprocal structures, ADDR
is expressed either in the strong form of the reflexive pronoun, or it is not expressed at all (sobě / �) (the
asterisk indicates that all forms of ADDR, the dative as well as all other possible morphological forms,
are subject to the given change). Further, the rule stipulates that in reciprocal structures, ADDR in the
prescribed form is obligatorily present in the deep structure. In case that ADDR has the null lexical form,
either of the listed lexical expressions must be expressed, see example (7c). The absence of the reflexive
pronoun in reciprocal structures of reflexive verbs results from the haplology of the clitic form of the
reflexive pronoun and the reflexive morpheme of verb lemmas, see (Rosen, 2014). As the haplology
occurs, one of the main grammatical markers of reciprocal meaning is missing and its role is taken
over by the lexical expressions (in reciprocal structures of irreflexive verbs, these lexical expressions
emphasize the reciprocal meaning but they are not the main markers of reciprocity, see e.g. (3c)).

reciprocity: ACT-ADDR

11With these verbs, the particles se and si are classified as word-forming morphemes representing a part of their verb lemmas:
Reflexive tantum verbs are verbs without corresponding irreflexive counterparts, e.g., bát se ‘fear’ (*bát), setkávat se ‘meet’
(*setkávat), dı́t se ‘happen’ (though the verb dı́t ‘say’ exists, it has completely different lexical meaning so these two verbs
are classified as homographs). With derived reflexive verbs, the reflexive variants are systematically semantically related to
their irreflexive variants, e.g., they express unintentional activities (e.g., šı́řit ‘disseminate’ – šı́řit se ‘spread’) or they signal
reciprocity (potkat ‘meet’ – potkat se ‘meet (together)’, svěřovat ‘entrust’ – svěřovat se ‘confide’), see also (Kettnerová and
Lopatková, 2014).

In (7c) and (7d), the reciprocity of ACT and ADDR is expressed by (i) the coordinated ACT cor-
responding to subject (the basic rule, Figure 2) and (ii) either by the dative strong form of the reflexive
pronoun sobě (7d), or in case that the reflexive pronoun is not present, by the lexical expression vzájemně
‘each other’ (7c) (the supplementary rule, Figure 4).

Conclusion

In this contribution, we have shown how the linguistic description of complex (but still systemic) changes
characteristic of grammaticalized alternations can benefit from the integration of grammatical rules into
a valency lexicon. As a case study, we have presented reciprocity in Czech: although a possibility to
create reciprocal structures is lexically conditioned, their morphosyntactic structures can be derived by
a set of formal rules. Based on detailed empirical observations, we have presented a model aiming
at an economic and theoretically well-founded description of valency behavior of verbs as it has been
developed for VALLEX, the Valency Lexicon of Czech Verbs.
