Abstract

The esoteric definitions of poetry are insuffi-
cient in enveloping the changes in poetry that
the age of mechanical reproduction has wit-
nessed with the widespread proliferation of
the use of digital media and artificial intelli-
gence. They are also insufficient in distin-
guishing between prose and poetry, as the con-
tent of both prose and poetry can be poetic.
Using quotes as prose considering their po-
etic, context-free and celebrated nature, stylis-
tic differences between poetry and prose are
delved into. Grammar and meter are justified
as distinguishing features. Datasets of popular
prose and poetry spanning across 1870-1920
and 1970-2019 have been created, and multi-
ple experiments have been conducted to prove
that prose and poetry in the latter period are
more alike than they were in the former. The
accuracy of classification of poetry and prose
of 1970-2019 is significantly lesser than that of
1870-1920, thereby proving the convergence
of poetry and prose.

1 Introduction

Language is the mathematics of expression. It is
a mathematics because one stitches together an al-
gorithm of concepts in the world, that we iden-
tify through words. This world of words is akin
to dealing with numbers, because both in their
atomic or denotative sense convey very little. But
when they combine, they have unlimited potential
of justifying profound concepts of time and space.

In this mathematical world of language, how-
ever, the origin and definitions of poetry as put
forth by philosophers are esoteric in nature with
little verifiability. And most of these esoteric defi-
nitions, though exotic, can be applied just as well
to prose. Plato, in Republic, Book X, writes that
poetry has the power to transform its audience,
and poets therefore should be held accountable for
what they write given this transformative power.

Aristotle (Golden, 1968), differentiates between
different artforms but his discussion of poetry as
being mainly tragedy or comedy explains that po-
etry since then has become a much wider artform.
Kant (1952) expounded that a “poem may be very
neat and elegant, but without spirit” if it lacks
imagination, while the same may be said about
prose. Shelley (2009) insists that poets are the
“unacknowledged legislators of the World” and
poetry to him is the “expression of the imagina-
tion” which he opines comes naturally to mankind.
He also gives a restricted definition of poetry as
follows:

Poetry in a mere restricted sense ex-
presses those arrangements of language,
and especially metrical language, which
are created by that imperial faculty,
whose throne is curtained within the in-
visible nature of man.

However, as pointed out by Gioia (2003), poetry
is a rapidly changing art. He writes that “the gen-
eral term poetry, for example, now encompasses
so many diverse and often irreconcilable artistic
enterprises that it often proves insufficient to dis-
tinguish the critical issues at stake.” Admittedly
then, the definition of a poem in the state of the
situation is the poem itself. And this causes a prob-
lem because anything goes in the name of poetry.

This paper is an attempt to understand what has
changed in poetry over the last 150 years within
the age of mechanical reproduction of art, named
so by Benjamin and Underwood (1998). Compar-
ison, therefore, has been done between the early
stages of this age, wherein romantic poetry flour-
ished, namely 1870-1920 and the late stage, 1970-
2019, which saw the mechanical reproduction of
art occurring through various digital forms. The
latter importantly saw the creation of artworks



15

using artificial intelligence, with many computa-
tional poetry generators spewing poetry.

Whatever one thinks of the artistic qual-
ity of the new poetic forms, one must
concede that at the very least they reas-
suringly demonstrate the abiding human
need for poetry.

(Dana Gioia)

1.1 Prose and Poetry - Differentiating
features

In the attempt to learn how poetry has changed
over the last 150 years, the features that are nor-
mally attributed to poetry were studied. How-
ever, it was noticed that semantic features such as
imagery, metaphors, sentiment, choice of words,
themes, topics and associations were not strictly
ascribed to poetry. All of these features can also be
found in prose, and it is for this reason that prose
is also called ‘poetic’, as corroborated by Eagle-
ton (2007). Toni Morrison, for instance, is called a
highly ‘poetic’ writer (Beaulieu, 2003). While we
see that many works of prose are poetic, choosing
entire novels would cause a lot of noise in the data.
It is for this reason that we carefully chose quotes
from popular novels as our prose, because quotes
are the touchstones of books, are contextually in-
dependent of the situation in the book and hence
make sense in a stand alone manner.

The visual difference between a quote and a
poem are the line breaks.

A poem is a fictional, verbally inventive
moral statement in which it is the author,
rather than the printer or word processor,
who decides where the lines should end.

(Terry Eagleton)

This, however, is also to say that a quote can be
converted to a poem by an individual’s decisions
as to where to split the sentences into new lines.
For this reason, line breaks were avoided as a fea-
ture.

Grammar, however, was identified as an impor-
tant differentiator between poetry and prose by
the authors by manual evaluation of the prose and
poetry datasets. Within grammar, different types
of inversions of word orders in sentences such
as verb-subject inversion, along with dependent
clauses, questions and conjunctions were chosen
as features and are justified under section 2.2.

Meter was also considered as a feature, because
as explained by Boulton (2014), meter is only a
subsection of rhythm, and meter consists of the
most identifiable rhythms. It is also important to
note that she makes it abundantly clear that “free
verse is not some glorious revolutionary emanci-
pation of poetry, allowing sincerities never before
possible.” But that it is the kind of poetry with a
meter that is neither traditional nor recognizable.
And inversions are mentioned to be used in or-
der to enforce a metrical structure in a poem, and
therefore, it made all the more sense to consider
meter as a feature.

Rhyme, however, was only used in comparing
poetry of the two chosen periods and is also aided
by inversion.

1.2 Related Work

Classification approaches between poetry and
prose have been done by Roxas and Tapang (2010)
using word adjacency networks and latent dirich-
let allocation. Jamal et al. (2012) have attempted
a classification of just poetry using themes. Tanas-
escu et al. (2016) have done a classification of po-
etry with respect to only rhyme and meter.

In work related to analysis of prose and poetry,
Doumit et al. (2013) have worked on differentiat-
ing prose and poetry of two popular poets and au-
thors each, using a semantic neural model. They
show that poetry possesses a higher number of as-
sociations than prose. However, quotes are as po-
etic as prose with many metaphors and associa-
tions. Therefore, our problem is unique as we dif-
ferentiate between quotes and poetry.

Kao and Jurafsky (2015) have done a computa-
tional analysis of poetic style using amateur and
professional poetry. However, they concentrate on
parts-of-speech tag occurrences and semantic fea-
tures such as imagery, emotional language, sound
devices and diction. Semantic features in this pa-
per have been avoided with a rationale that quotes
and poetry would be very similar with respect to
these.

Chen et al. (2014) have worked on converting
prose into rhyming verse, which uses substitution
choices so as to enforce rhyme and produces son-
nets based on an input of source sentences.

Computational poetry generators have used
prose in the form of input or as training data,
applying constraints on it using meter, rhyme
and type of words through deep learning as



16

well as heuristic approaches (Chen et al., 2014;
Ghazvininejad et al., 2016; Yi et al., 2017).

Therefore, the use of different sentences styles
in poetry as compared to prose contributed by the
use of inversion has not been used as a feature so
far. While meter was widely used, the dynam-
ics between meter, inversion and rhyme have not
been explored. Our high accuracies of classifica-
tion with just inversion as a feature show the im-
portance of the account of sentences-styling in po-
etry as compared to prose. The study of change
in poetry with respect to prose historically is also
unique to this paper, clearly showing the dwin-
dling of the features that were once more preva-
lent in poetry than they are today. The absence
of change in prose over the years with respect to
the stylistic features of inversion and meter is also
shown.

2 Methodology

2.1 Dataset Overview

The four datasets using which our features for the
historical analysis of poetry and prose were de-
rived, belong to two time segments 1870-1920 and
1970-2019. The reasoning behind choosing these
particular time segments is explained in Section 1.
Each time segment has a dataset of both prose and
poetry. Each of the datasets were made computa-
tionally by curating content written in the respec-
tive time segment by popular poets and books of
the time.

For poetry, PoetryFoundation1 and Po-
emHunter2 websites were used. Finding the year
of publishing of individual poems was difficult,
so lists of popular poets of that time period were
manually chosen from the websites mentioned,
and their works were collated in the form of pdf
files. These pdf files were converted into datasets.

For prose, 30 top liked quotes (or lesser if 30
weren’t available) from 500 most popular books
of the time segment as listed by Goodreads3 were
computationally collected. The top liked quotes
are often quite ’poetic’ in their content. The meta
structure of our datasets is described in table 1.

2.2 Features

Each line of a poem, and each sentence of a quote
was considered as the smallest unit on which the

Type Time Period Count
Prose 1870-1920 7838 quotes
Prose 1970-2019 12623 quotes
Poetry 1870-1920 13635 poems
Poetry 1970-2019 7917 poems

Table 1: Datasets

following features were calculated:

2.2.1 Grammar
While prose is always grammatical, poetry tends
to break away from the limitations of grammar.
With regard to the celebrated poet Emily Dick-
inson, Miller (1987) writes that the former of-
ten wrote in an ungrammatical manner. The term
‘poetic license’ (Britannica, 2007) is a testament
to the fact that poets often break the rules of
grammar. For instance, Kaur (2017) and Cum-
mings (1994) have written without capitalization
or punctuation, thus violating grammar.

While the lack of capitalization and punctuation
are not universal among poems, by manual eval-
uation, it was noticed that the styles of the sen-
tences used in poetry greatly differed from those
in prose because of the use of inversion. Inversion
is defined as, “the syntactic reversal of the normal
order of the words and phrases in a sentence, as,
in English, the placing of an adjective after the
noun it modifies (“the form divine”), a verb be-
fore its subject (“Came the dawn”), or a noun pre-
ceding its preposition “worlds between”)” (Britan-
nica, 2016).

As an example, Wordsworth in his poem, “I
Wandered Lonely As A Crowd” (Wordsworth)
uses the verb-subject inversion when he writes
“Ten thousand saw I at a glance” instead of “I saw
ten thousand at a glance”.

We use four different kind of inversions that
we observed in poetry based on the discussion of
styling sentences in Waddell (1993) supplemented
by the insights in Literary Devices website (De-
vices, 2015).

Along with these, features such as dependent
clause as a subject, rhetorical questions and lines
beginning with conjunctions are used as features.
The use of conjunctions at the beginning of a
line/sentence is disputed to be ungrammatical
(Soanes, 2012), but we noticed that the usage was
higher in poetry as compared to prose considering
that poetry is a grouping of phrases and clauses.



17

Waddell (1993) also describes the use of depen-
dent clauses as a pattern of styling sentences and
we noted that dependent clause as a subject oc-
curred quite often in poems. The use of rhetori-
cal questions in literature (Devices, 2017) is quite
prevalent, and they occurred more in our poetry
datasets. The list of features related to grammar
with examples are listed in table 2.

In order to implement all of the above features,
Stanford CoreNLP (Manning et al., 2014) tools
of tokenization, parts of speech tags, dependency
parse trees, OpenIE triples were used. Simple
heuristics were used to decide which kind of in-
versions exist in a given sentence using POS tags
and OpenIE triple occurrences in the sentence. For
instance, if the subject given by OpenIE triple of a
line is a noun or pronoun, and it is preceded by a
verb, the line would be marked as having subject-
verb inversion. The OpenIE tool trained on prose,
doesn’t always fetch results for lines in poetry and
in these cases, we use POS tags as they are ac-
curate for poetry as well. The various inversion
counts were normalized by the number of lines
in poetry datasets and the number of sentences in
prose datasets, so as to remove dependency on the
the length of the poem or quote.

2.2.2 Meter
Poets use inversion in order to fit their material
into a meter (Britannica, 2016), which is noth-
ing but the arrangement of stressed(s) and un-
stressed(w) syllables in a certain manner (Boulton,
2014). In order to implement meter, we used Stan-
ford Literary Lab’s Poesy (Heuser et al., 2018),
which is a python module for poetic processing.
The module gives information of a base meter
among four types of base meters:

1. Iambic [ws]

2. Trochaic [sw]

3. Anapestic [wws]

4. Dactylic [sww]

It also gives information regarding the number
of repetitions of meter in a given line, thus leading
to information on whether the poem is a pentame-
ter, hexameter etc.

2.2.3 Rhyme
Inversion is also used often to fit into a rhyme
scheme along with meter. Using the Poesy

(Heuser et al., 2018) module, we also extract the
rhyme scheme of poems. It was only used for
comparison between the two poetry datasets. It
has not been applied on the prose datasets as the
values were null.

2.3 Classification

The feature vectors consisted of 9 features dis-
cussed in the previous sections. Seven of them are
various inversion types, followed by the base me-
ter and number of feet. The extra feature, ‘rhyme
type’ was only used for classification between the
two poetry datasets.

The feature data was trained through a random
forest classifier (Breiman, 2001) and KNN classi-
fier with a 70/30 split for the training and testing
data. The optimal value of the number of trees for
random forest classifier was found to be 100. The
value of k is taken be 3 for the KNN classifier.
To deal with class imbalance, we adjust weights
inversely proportional to class frequencies in the
data.

Four experiments of different classifications be-
tween poetry and prose were conducted.

3 Results

Random Forest classifier performed better than
KNN classifier in all of the below experiments:

3.1 Prose vs Poetry of Each Period

Classification of prose and poetry of each period
was done to see if classification accuracy between
poetry and prose has reduced for the time seg-
ment 1970-2019 as compared to that of 1870-
1920. This would indicate that poetry and prose
are more similar in 1970-2019 than they were
in 1870-1920. Various combinations of features
were used with both the classifiers.

The reduction in the classification accuracy of
poetry and prose of 1970-2019 as shown in table 4
as compared to 1870-1920 as shown in table 3, in-
dicates convergence in poetry and prose in the pe-
riod 1970-2019.

3.2 Poetry: 1870-1920 vs 1970-2019

Classification of poetry of 1870-1920 and poetry
of 1970-2019 was conducted with rhyme as an ad-
ditional feature.

The results as shown in table 5 indicate that po-
etry has undergone a significant change with an
accuracy of 77% in classification.

Feature Example

Adjective Inversion: Adjective occurs right after the noun. ”I sing the body electric”

Subject Verb Inversion: Verb occurs before its subject. ”Ten thousand saw I at a glance.”

Prepositional Phrase Inversion: Prepositional phrase occurs
before subject and verb, or verb and subject. ”Until we meet again, to be counted as bliss.”

The Yoda construction: Modifier followed by subject and
verb. ”Whose woods these are I think I know.”

Dependent Clause as a subject, followed by verb. ”What man cannot imagine, he cannot create.”

Question ”Shall I compare thee to a summers day?”

Beginning with a conjunction

”Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood

And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;”

3.3 Prose: 1870-1920 vs 1970-2019

Classification of prose of 1870-1920 and prose of
1970-2019 was conducted.

The results as shown in table 6 indicate that
nothing much has changed in prose as per these
features over the two periods because the evalua-
tion scores are close to a random guess (59%).

3.4 Poetry and Prose Both Periods Combined

This classification was done with combined
datasets of poetry against combined datasets of
prose. As per the results shown in table 7, given an
input, this classifier would differentiate between it
being a poem or prose with 94.7% accuracy. This
is an important result as we do not consider line
breaks.

Inversion Count

4 Analysis

4.1 Inversion

Figures 1 and 2 are plotted between the normal-
ized inversion count(so as to remove any depen-
dency on the length of the poem/prose), and the
normalized frequency of the datasets(so as to re-
move dependency on the number of data points).

Figure 2: Prose (1870-1920) vs Prose (1970-2019) -
Inversion Count

Figure 1 indicates a significant fall in the inver-
sion count in the second time period. And figure 2
shows that the inversion counts of the two periods
of prose are more or less the same.

4.2 Meter Base Type

The figures 3 and 4 represent the historical change
in meter over the two periods for both prose and
poetry. The y axis represents the percentage of
dataset, which is a normalized indicator and does
not skew the graph towards the period with higher
data points.

20

Figure 4: Prose (1870-1920) vs Prose (1970-2019) -
Meter Type

Figure 3 clearly shows the dominance of the
iambic base meter in poetry datasets, and its fall
from 1870-1920 to 1970-2019. It also shows that
in 1970-2019, the number of poems with no dis-
tinguishable meter has risen considerably with no
significant change in anapestic or dactylic base
meters.

Figure 4 proves that there is no significant dif-
ference in the base meter of prose over the two
chosen periods, with none value as the most dom-
inant.

4.3 Popular Meters

Figure 5 and Figure 6 were drawn so as to show the
change in meter. Meter plotted is a combination of
the base meter and its feet in the poem. The top 7
meters were chosen for the plots.

Figure 5 shows the significant fall of the all the
popular meters in the second time period as com-
pared to the first. The increase in the none values
also suggests that the second time period consists
of poetry with no recognizable meter.

Figure 5: Poetry (1870-1920) vs Poetry (1970-2019)

Figure 6, on the other hand, shows the lack of
recognizable meter in prose which is expected.

Figure 7: Poetry (1870-1920) vs Poetry (1970-2019) -
Rhyme Scheme

4.4 Rhyme

The rhyme feature used in figure 7, shows that
a large percentage of 1970-2019 poetry has no
rhyme scheme, while also showing that the preva-
lence of the other rhyme schemes has also come
down.

5 Conclusion

From the experiments conducted, it has been
proved that the poetry of 1970-2019 is more sim-
ilar to prose of its period than the poetry of 1870-
1920 was to the prose of the same period. The
changes in prose of the two periods with respect
to stylistic features are minimal, but those in po-
etry are significant. The convergence of poetry and
prose and lack of change in prose, proves that po-
etry does not possess the liminal boundaries that
prose enjoys. The importance of a new age defi-



21

nition of poetry is thus established considering the
changes in poetry as an artform.

Apart from justifying the historical changes in
poetry and prose, this paper also achieves high ac-
curacy in the classification of poem and prose us-
ing no semantic features. This is an important in-
dicator that semantic content of poetry and prose
can be very alike and that they can still be differen-
tiated using stylistic features without considering
the obvious visual difference of line breaks.

The future work of this paper is to use these fea-
tures in constructing a personalized poetry assis-
tant that learns the stylistic preferences of the user
in inversions and meter, based on user input of cre-
ative text. This personalized nature of the assistant
would adapt to the user’s wishes in becoming a
‘modern’ or a ‘classic’ poet.
