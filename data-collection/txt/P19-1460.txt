Abstract
We identify agreement and disagreement be-
tween utterances that express stances towards
a topic of discussion. Existing methods fo-
cus mainly on conversational settings, where
dialogic features are used for (dis)agreement
inference. We extend this scope and seek
to detect stance (dis)agreement in a broader
setting, where independent stance-bearing ut-
terances, which prevail in many stance cor-
pora and real-world scenarios, are compared.
To cope with such non-dialogic utterances,
we find that the reasons uttered to back
up a specific stance can help predict stance
(dis)agreements. We propose a reason com-
paring network (RCN) to leverage reason in-
formation for stance comparison. Empirical
results on a well-known stance corpus show
that our method can discover useful reason in-
formation, enabling it to outperform several
baselines in stance (dis)agreement detection.

1 Introduction

Agreement and disagreement naturally arise when
peoples’ views, or “stances”, on the same topics
are exchanged. Being able to identify the con-
vergence and divergence of stances is valuable to
various downstream applications, such as discov-
ering subgroups in a discussion (Hassan et al.,
2012; Abu-Jbara et al., 2012), improving recog-
nition of argumentative structure (Lippi and Tor-
roni, 2016), and bootstrapping stance classifica-
tion with (dis)agreement side information (Sridhar
et al., 2014; Ebrahimi et al., 2016).

Previous efforts on (dis)agreement detection
are confined to the scenario of natural dia-
logues (Misra and Walker, 2013; Wang and
Cardie, 2014; Sridhar et al., 2015; Rosenthal
and McKeown, 2015), where dialogic struc-
tures are used to create a conversational con-
text for (dis)agreement inference. However, non-
dialogic stance-bearing utterances are also very

common in real-world scenarios. For example,
in social media, people can express stances au-
tonomously, without the intention of initiating a
discussion (Mohammad et al., 2016). There are
also corpora built with articles containing many
self-contained stance-bearing utterances (Ferreira
and Vlachos, 2016; Bar-Haim et al., 2017).

Studying how to detect (dis)agreement between
such independent stance-bearing utterances has
several benefits: 1) pairing these utterances can
lead to a larger (dis)agreement corpus for train-
ing a potentially richer model for (dis)agreement
detection; 2) the obtained pairs enable train-
ing a distance-based model for opinion cluster-
ing and subgroup mining; 3) it is applicable to
the aforementioned non-dialogic stance corpora;
and 4) it encourages discovering useful signals for
(dis)agreement detection beyond dialogic features
(e.g., the reason information studied in this work).

In this work, we investigate how to detect
(dis)agreement between a given pair of (presum-
ably unrelated) stance-bearing utterances. Table 1
shows an example where a decision is made on
whether two utterances agree or disagree on a dis-
cussed topic. This task, however, is more chal-
lenging, as the inference has to be made without
using any contextual information (e.g., dialogic
structures). To address this issue, one may need to
seek clues within each of the compared utterances
to construct appropriate contexts.

Topic: Gun Control
Utterance 1: Utterance2:
If guns are outlawed, only
outlaws will have guns.
(Stance: Against)

Freedom to have a gun is
same as freedom of speech.
(Stance: Against)

Class Label: Agree

Table 1: The task of detecting stance (dis)agreement
between utterances towards a topic of discussion.

It has been observed that when expressing

stances, people usually back up their stances with
specific explanations or reasons (Hasan and Ng,
2014; Boltuzic and Snajder, 2014). These rea-
sons are informative about which stance is taken,
because they give more details on how a stance
is developed. However, simply comparing the
reasons may not be sufficient to predict stance
(dis)agreement, as sometimes people can take
the same stance but give different reasons (e.g.,
the points outlaws having guns and freedom of
speech mentioned in Table 1). One way to ad-
dress this problem is to make the reasons stance-
comparable, so that the reason comparison results
can be stance-predictive.

In this paper, in order to leverage reason in-
formation for detecting stance (dis)agreement, we
propose a reason embedding approach, where the
reasons are made stance-comparable by project-
ing them into a shared, embedded space. In this
space, “stance-agreed” reasons are close while
“stance-disagreed” ones are distant. For instance,
the reason points outlaws having guns and free-
dom of speech in Table 1 would be near to each
other in that space, as they are “agreed” on the
same stance. We learn such reason embedding
by comparing the reasons using utterance-level
(dis)agreement supervision, so that reasons sup-
porting agreed (disagreed) stances would have
similar (different) representations. A reason com-
paring network (RCN) is designed to learn the rea-
son embedding and predict stance (dis)agreement
based on the embedded reasons. Our method com-
plements existing dialogic-based approaches by
providing the embedded reasons as extra features.
We evaluate our method on a well-known stance
corpus and show that it successfully aligns reasons
with (dis)agreement signals and achieves state-of-
the-art results in stance (dis)agreement detection.

2 RCN: The Proposed Model

Figure 1 illustrates the architecture of RCN. At a
high level, RCN is a classification model that takes
as input an utterance pair (P,Q) and a topic T ,
and outputs a probability distribution y over three
classes {Agree,Disagree,Neither} for stance
comparison. To embed reasons, RCN uses two
identical sub-networks (each contains an RNN en-
coder and a reason encoder) with shared weights
to extract reason information from the paired ut-
terances and predict their stance (dis)agreement
based on the reasons.

RNN Encoder: In this module, we use RNNs
to encode the input utterances. We first use word
embedding to vectorise each word in the input ut-
terance pair (P,Q) and topic T , obtaining three
sequences of word vectors P, Q, and T. Then
we use two BiLSTMs to encode the utterance
and topic sequences, respectively. Moreover, by
following the work of Augenstein et al. (2016),
we use conditional encoding to capture the utter-
ances’ dependencies on the topic. The output are
two topic-encoded sequences produced by the ut-
terance BiLSTM for P (Q), denoted by HP (Q) =
{hP (Q)i }

|P (Q)|
i=1 ∈ R|P (Q)|×2h, where h is the hid-

den size of a unidirectional LSTM.

Reason Encoder: Then we extract reasons from
the utterances, which is the main contribution of
this work. In particular, we focus on the major rea-
sons that most people are concerned with, which
possess two properties: 1) they are focal points
mentioned to support a specific stance; 2) they re-
cur in multiple utterances. With such properties,
the extraction of these reasons can then be reduced
to finding the recurring focal points in all the input
utterances.

To action on this insight, we take a weighting-
based approach by learning a weighting matrix A
that captures the relatedness between each posi-
tion in an utterance and each implied reason. For
example, on utterance P where we hypothesise κ
possible reasons, the weighting matrix is A|P |×κ,
with each cell Ai,k representing the relatedness be-
tween the ith position of P and the kth reason.

To learn the weighting matrix A, we use self-
attention (Cheng et al., 2016) and develop a par-
ticular self-attention layer for implementing the
above weighting scheme. Meanwhile, the recur-
rence of a reason is also perceivable, as all utter-
ances mentioning that reason are used to learn the

Figure 1: The architecture of RCN.

self-attention layer.
Our particular self-attention applied on an ut-

terance is designed as follows. First, a pairwise
relatedness score is computed between each pair
of positions (hi,hj) with a bilinear transformation,
ci,j = tanh(h>i W(1)hj), where W(1) ∈ R2h×2h
is a trainable parameter. Next, for each position
hi, we convert its relatedness scores with all other
positions into its overall relatedness scores with κ
possible reasons using a linear transformation f ,

ei,k = f({ci,j}|P | or |Q|j=1 ) =
|P | or |Q|∑

j=1

ci,j ·W (2)j,k + bk (1)

where W(2) = {W (2)j,k } ∈ R
|P orQ|×κ and b ∈ Rκ

are trainable parameters. The philosophy behind
Eq. 1 is that the relatedness distribution {ci,j} of
an utterance implies segments in it that are inter-
nally compatible, which may correspond to differ-
ent focal points (reasons). The transformation f
then learns the mapping between those two. Fi-
nally, we obtain the attention weight Ai,k for each
position i on each reason k by applying softmax
over all e∗,ks,

Ai,k =
exp(ei,k)∑|P | or |Q|

j=1 exp(ej,k)
(2)

With A obtained, we can compute an utterance’s
reason encoding as the sum of its RNN encoding
{hi} weighted by A: rk =

∑
i=1 ak,ihi, where

rk ∈ R2h is the encoding for the kth reason. We
use RP (Q) = [rP (Q)1 , ..., r

P (Q)
κ ] ∈ R2h×κ to de-

note the reason matrix for the utterance P (Q).
It is worth noting that the above self-attention

mechanism in our reason encoding can also
be seen as a variant of multi-dimensional self-
attention, as we simultaneously learn multiple at-
tention vectors for the different reasons implied in
an utterance.

Stance Comparator: Now we compare the
stances of P andQ based on their reason matrices.
Since we have captured multiple reasons in each
utterance, all the differences between their reasons
must be considered. We thus take a reason-wise
comparing approach, where every possible pair of
reasons between P and Q is compared. We em-
ploy two widely used operations for the compari-
son, i.e., multiplication: smuli,j = r

P
i � r

Q
j and sub-

traction: ssubi,j = (r
P
i − r

Q
j ) � (rPi − r

Q
j ), where

� denote element-wise multiplication. We then

aggregate all the differences resulting from each
operation into a single vector, by using a global
max-pooling to signal the largest difference with
respect to an operation,

smul = global max pooling({smuli,j |i, j ∈ [1, κ]})
ssub = global max pooling({ssubi,j |i, j ∈ [1, κ]})

(3)

The concatenation of the two difference vectors
s = [smul; ssub] forms the output of this module.

(Dis)agreement Classifier: Finally, a classifier
is deployed to produce the (dis)agreement class
probability ŷ = {ŷ1, ŷ2, ŷ3} based on the compar-
ison result s, which consists of a two-layer feed-
forward network followed by a softmax layer, ŷ =
softmax(FeedForward(s)).

Optimisation: To train our model, we use the
multi-class cross-entropy loss,

L(θ) = −
N∑
i

3∑
j

y
(i)
j log ŷ

(i)
j + λ

∑
θ∈Θ

θ2 (4)

where N is the size of training set, y ∈
{Agree,Disagree,Neither} is the ground-truth
label indicator for each class, and ŷ is the pre-
dicted class probability. λ is the coefficient for
L2-regularisation. Θ denotes the set of all train-
able parameters in our model.

Minimising Eq. 4 encourages the comparison
results between the extracted reasons from P and
Q to be stance-predictive.

3 Related Work

Our work is mostly related to the task of detecting
agreement and disagreement in online discussions.
Recent studies have mainly focused on classifying
(dis)agreement in dialogues (Abbott et al., 2011;
Wang and Cardie, 2014; Misra and Walker, 2013;
Allen et al., 2014). In these studies, various fea-
tures (e.g., structural, linguistic) and/or specialised
lexicons are proposed to recognise (dis)agreement
in different dialogic scenarios. In contrast, we
detect stance (dis)agreement between independent
utterances where dialogic features are absent.

Stance classification has recently received much
attention in the opinion mining community. Dif-
ferent approaches have been proposed to classify
stances of individual utterances in ideological fo-
rums (Murakami and Raymond, 2010; Somasun-
daran and Wiebe, 2010; Gottopati et al., 2013; Qiu
et al., 2015) and social media (Augenstein et al.,



4668

2016; Du et al., 2017; Mohammad et al., 2017). In
our work, we classify (dis)agreement relationships
between a pair of stance-bearing utterances.

Reason information has been found useful in
argumentation mining (Lippi and Torroni, 2016),
where studies leverage stance and reason signals
for various argumentation tasks (Hasan and Ng,
2014; Boltuzic and Snajder, 2014; Sobhani et al.,
2015). We study how to exploit the reason infor-
mation to better understand the stance, thus ad-
dressing a different task.

Our work is also related to the tasks on tex-
tual relationship inference, such as textual entail-
ment (Bowman et al., 2015), paraphrase detec-
tion (Yin and Schütze, 2015), and question an-
swering (Wang et al., 2016). Unlike the textual
relationships addressed in those tasks, the rela-
tionships between utterances expressing stances
do not necessarily contain any rephrasing or en-
tailing semantics, but they do carry discourse sig-
nals (e.g., reasons) related to stance expressing.

4 Experiments

4.1 Setup

Dataset: The evaluation of our model requires
a corpus of agreed/disagreed utterance pairs. For
this, we adapted a popular corpus for stance detec-
tion, i.e., a collection of tweets expressing stances
from SemEval-2016 Task 6. It contains tweets
with stance labels (Favour, Against, and None) on
five topics, i.e., Climate Change is a Real Concern
(CC), Hillary Clinton (HC), Feminist Movement
(FM), Atheism (AT), and Legalization of Abortion
(LA). We generated utterance pairs by randomly
sampling from those tweets as follows: Agreement
samples: 20k pairs labelled as (Favour, Favour)
or (Against, Against); Disagreement samples: 20k
pairs as (Favour, Against), (Favour, None), or
(Against, None); Unknown samples: 10k pairs as
(None, None)1.

Baselines: We compared our method with the
following baselines: 1) BiLSTM: a base model for
our task, where only the RNN encoder is used to
encode the input; 2) DeAT (Parikh et al., 2016):
a popular attention-based models for natural lan-
guage inference. 3) BiMPM (Wang et al., 2017):
a more recent natural language inference model

1Fewer unknown pairs being sampled is due to the inher-
ently fewer none-stance tweets in the original corpus.

where two pieces of text are matched from mul-
tiple perspectives based on pooling and attention.

Training details: An 80%/10%/10% split was
used for training, validation and test sets. All
hyper-parameters were tuned on the validation set.
The word embeddings were statically set with the
200-dimensional GloVe word vectors pre-trained
on the 27B Twitter corpus. The hidden sizes of
LSTM and FeedForward layers were set to 100. A
light dropout (0.2) was applied to DeAT and heavy
(0.8) to the rest. ADAM was used as the optimiser
and learning rate was set to 10−4. Early stopping
was applied with the patience value set to 7.

4.2 Results

Table 2 shows the results of our method and all the
baselines on tasks with different topics. We can
first observe that the proposed RCN consistently
outperformed all the baselines across all topics.
Despite being modest, all the improvements of
RCN over the baselines are statistically significant
at p < 0.05 with a two-tailed t-test. Among these
methods, BiLSTM performed the worst, showing
that only using the RNN encoder for sequence
encoding is not sufficient for obtaining optimal
results. DeAT and BiMPM performed similarly
well; both used attention to compare the utterances
at a fine-grained level, resulting in a 2∼5% boost
over BiLSTM. Finally, RCN performed the best,
with relative improvements from 2.1% to 10.4%
over the second best. As all the compared methods
shared the same RNN encoding layers, that RCN
performed empirically the best demonstrates the
efficacy of its unique reason encoder and stance
comparator in boosting performance.

4.3 Analysis

in the reason encoder of RCN. In particular, we
show the attentive activations in the reason en-

coder (i.e., A in Eq. 2), and see if reason-related
contents could draw more attention from RCN.

Visualising attention signals in tweets: Table 3
shows the attention activations on three examples
of tweet pairs chosen from our test set. For the
first two, we set the number of reasons to be at-
tended to as one. It can be seen that the parts of the
tweets that received large attention weights (the
highlighted words in Table 3) were quite relevant
to the respective topics; liar, corrupt, and lie are
words appearing in news about Hillary Clinton;
girl, pregnancy, and murder are common words in
the text about Legalisation of Abortion. Also, most
of the highlighted words have concrete meanings
and are useful to understand why the stances were
taken. The last row shows a case when two reasons
had been attended to. We observe a similar trend
as before that the highlighted contents were topic-
specific and stance-revealing. Moreover, since one
more reason dimension was added to be inferred in
this case, RCN was able to focus on different parts
of a tweet corresponding to the two reasons.

Visualising learned reasons: We also visu-
alised the reasons learned by our model, repre-
sented as the words assigned with the largest at-
tention weights in our results (i.e., 1.0). Ta-
ble 4 shows samples of such reason words. We

see that the reason words have strong correlations
with the respective topics, and, more importantly,
they reflect different reason aspects regarding a
topic, such as economy vs. community on Climate
Change is a Real Concern and culture vs. justice
on Legalisation of Abortion.

In summary, both the visualisations in Table 3
and 4 show that the attention mechanism em-
ployed by RCN is effective in finding different rea-
son aspects that contribute to stance comparison.

5 Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper, we identify (dis)agreement between
stances expressed in paired utterances. We exploit
the reasons behind the stances and propose a rea-
son comparing network (RCN) to capture the rea-
son information to infer the stance (dis)agreement.
A quantitative analysis shows the effectiveness of
RCN in recognising stance (dis)agreement on var-
ious topics. A visualisation analysis further illus-
trates the ability of RCN to discover useful reason
aspects for the stance comparison.

In the future, this work can be progressed in
several ways. First, it is necessary to evaluate our
model on more stance data with different linguistic
properties (e.g., the much longer and richer stance
utterances in posts or articles). Second, it is impor-
tant to show how the learned embedded reasons
can help downstream applications such as stance
detection. Finally, it would be insightful to further
visualise the reasons in the embedded space with
more advanced visualisation tools.
