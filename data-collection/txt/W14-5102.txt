Abstract

Marathi  and  Hindi  both  being  Indo-Aryan 
family  members  and  using  Devanagari 
script  are  similar  to  a  great  extent.  Both 
follow  SOV  sentence  structure  and  are 
equally liberal in word order. The translation 
for  this  language  pair  appears  to  be  easy. 
But  experiments  show  this  to  be  a 
significantly difficult task, primarily due to 
the  fact  that  Marathi  is  morphologically 
richer  compared  to  Hindi.  We  propose  a 
Marathi  to  Hindi  Statistical  Machine 
Translation (SMT) system which makes use 
of  compound  word  splitting  to  tackle  the 
morphological richness of Marathi. 

1 Introduction

Marathi is  widely  spoken  in  and  around 
Maharashtra, India and also in other parts of the 
world. Hindi is widely spoken in Northern India 
and is  understood in  most  parts  of  the  nation. 
Hindi  also  has  significant  number  of  speakers 
across the world in countries where Indians have 
migrated.  Marathi  speaking  areas  host  many 
important  economic and social  activity  centers, 
where many times there is need for translation of 
content from Marathi to Hindi.

Marathi and  Hindi  both  belong to  the  Indo-
Aryan family  of  languages  and  have  the  same 
flexibility  towards  word  order,  canonically 
following the SOV structure. As both are written 
in Devanagari script and have many words which 
are either same or can be traced to same origin, 
they resemble each other to a great extent. This 
resemblance  may  make  us  to  believe  that 
Statistical Machine Translation will be an easier 
affair  on  this  pair.  But  upon  experiments  it  is 
observed  that  the  morphological  richness  of 
Marathi makes it as difficult as any other Indian 
language  to  Indian  language  Machine 
Translation.

Marathi is agglutinative in nature which makes 
Marathi to Hindi SMT even more difficult. It is 

known that SMT produces more unknown words 
resulting  in  bad  translation  quality,  if 
morphological  divergence  between  source  and 
target languages is high. Koehn & Knight (2003), 
Popovic & Ney (2004) and Popovic et al. (2006) 
have demonstrated ways to handle this issue with 
morphological  segmentation  of  words  before 
training the SMT system.

We demonstrate a better performing Marathi to 
Hindi  SMT  system  which  makes  use  of 
morphological  segmentation  on  the  source side 
prior  to  training.  The  proposed  system  shows 
significant  improvement  in  translation  quality 
compared  to  the  baseline.  We  also  present 
comparative study using BLEU (Papineni et al. 
2002),  NIST  (Doddington,  2002),  Position-
independent  Word  Error  Rate  (Tillmann  et  al., 
1997),  Word  Error  Rate  (Nießen  et  al.,  2000), 
manual evaluations and 10-fold cross validation. 

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. 
In  Section  2,  we  discuss  the  similarities  and 
dissimilarities in the language pair under study. 
In Section 3, we describe the experimental set up 
and  splitting  algorithm.  Section  4  discusses 
experiments  and  results  for  splitting  and 
constrained splitting. Analysis and discussion is 
done in section 5 with manual evaluation, 10-fold 
cross validation, error analysis and comparative 
study with similar work, followed by conclusion 
and future work in section 6.

2 Similarity  Analysis  of  Marathi  and 
Hindi

Marathi  and  Hindi  both  belong  to  Indo-Aryan 
family  of  languages  and  Marathi  is  Southern-
most  in this  category.  Being situated in  such a 
geographical  vicinity  of  India  Marathi  seems 
considerably influenced by Dravidian languages 
(Junghare, 2009). It makes frequent use of word 
compounding  or  post  modifications  to  create 
meaningful  words  using  prefixes  and  suffixes. 
Number of such derived words in Marathi is very 
high and this distinguishes Marathi from others 
in  Indo-Aryan  language  family.  Dabre  et  al. 2



(2012) and Bhosale et  al.  (2011) have 
theoretically  discussed  the  morphological 
richness of Marathi and compared it with Hindi.

We  analyzed  a  parallel  Marathi  and  Hindi 
translation  corpus  of  size  48000  sentences  for 
following parameters:

• Average  Sentence  Length:  Considered 
number  of  words  in  a  sentence  as  the 
sentence  length.  This  parameter  is 
captured to compare number of words a 
language  needs  to  represent  a  concept, 
assuming  a  sentence  is  written  to 
represent a concept.

• Word Count: Total  number of words in 
the corpus. This is captured to affirm that 
a morphologically poorer language needs 
more words as compared to the richer.

• Unique Word Count: Number of distinct 
words in the corpus. This is computed to 
compare  morphological  richness  of  the 
languages.

• Average  Word  Frequency:  Word 
frequency is number of times the word is 
repeated  in  corpus.  This  will  help  to 
demonstrate  that  word  frequency  is 
higher  in  morphologically  poorer 
language.

• Average  Word  Length:  Number  of 
characters in a word is word length. This 
is  measured  to  analyze  the  significant 
presence of compound words in Marathi.

The corpus analysis in Table 1 shows that  a 
Hindi sentence needs on an average 17 words to 
represent  a  concept  whereas  Marathi  sentence 
needs  just  12  words  to  represent  the  same 
concept.  The  total  number  of  words  in  Hindi 
corpus is  834417 and Marathi  has  just  602500 
which  affirm  the  fact  that  Marathi  represents 
varied concepts with lesser number of words as 
compared to Hindi. We can also see that unique 

word count  for Marathi  is  more than Hindi  by 
44474,  which  demonstrates  that  Marathi  has 
larger  vocabulary  of  surface  forms  to  describe 
different meanings, and the same in case of Hindi 
is done by using different word combinations. As 
Hindi  has  less  unique words it  needs to repeat 
many of them for representing certain meanings 
and this is evident from the higher average word 
frequency of 19. Marathi has comparatively less 
word frequency as it doesn't need to do the same. 
The average word length for  Marathi  is  higher 
and it shows that significant number of Marathi 
words carry more information  than their  Hindi 
counterparts.  The  length  difference  also 
demonstrates  that  the  compound  words  are 
significantly high in Marathi and thus statistically 
affirms  the  morphological  richness  of  Marathi 
compared to Hindi.

In Marathi there are words like  'हिरदारमधयेही' 
(haridwarmadhyehi  –  also  in  Haridwar) and 
'पोहोचणयाकिरता'  (pohachanyakarita  –  to  reach) 
which  when  translated  to  Hindi  will  become 
'हिरदार मे भी' (haridwar men bhi) and  'पहुचंने के 
िलए'  (pahunchane ke liye) respectively. Here the 
word  'हिरदारमधयेही'  (haridwarmadhyehi) is 
formed by compounding a proper noun  'हिरदार' 
(haridwar),  preposition 'मधये' (madhye - in) and 
an adverbial  'ही' (hi -  also) and 'पोहोचणयाकिरता'  
(pohachanyakarita)  is  formed by  compounding 
'पोहोचणया'  (pohachanya -  derived  verb  form of 
'reach') and  'किरता'  (karita  -  'TO'  infinitive 
equivalent in Marathi). Marathi follows different 
rules  for  derivation  of  such  words  by  stacking 
together different surface forms and suffixes. In 
the process (called as Sandhi), it may modify the 
form of surface word.

As  an  example  we  can  see  word 
'उपाहारगृहापमाणे'  (upahargruhapramane) is 
formed by combining  'उपाहारगहृ'  (upahargruh -  
restaurant) and 'पमाणे' (pramane  –  as  per);  but 
while  combining  these  two  words,  ' ाा' (aa) 
letter is  attached to  'उपाहारगृह' (upahargruh)  as 
suffix to derive a new base form 'उपाहारगृहा'

(upahargruha)  and then word  'पमाणे' (pramane) 
is  suffixed.  More  examples  demonstrating  this 
phenomenon have been provided in Table 2. We 
can  observe  that  a  single  word  in  Marathi  is 
translated to multiple words in Hindi and English 
and that's  due to the morphological richness of 
Marathi compared to Hindi and English.

Another analysis presented in Table 3 shows 
that Marathi and Hindi have around 16693 words 
in  common  which  are  38.51%  of  Hindi  and 
19.00% of Marathi vocabulary extracted from the 
corpus. Some of these words are common nouns 
like  'सिचव'  (sachiv) and 'िचत'  (chitra),   proper 
nouns  like  'आकाश'  (akash),  'नागापिटनम'  
(nagapattinam) and  a  few  words  from  other 

languages transliterated in Devanagari script like 
'इनसुिलन'  (insulin) and  'टेकनोलॉजी'  (technology).  
Many of these common words have their origin 
in Sanskrit and are used as it is or on derivation. 
We also need to notice that the foreign language 
words transliterated into Devanagari are part of 
this common words set as both the languages use 
Devanagari for representation.

3 Experimental Setup

In the following subsections we describe training 
corpus  and  SMT  system  setup  for  the 
experiments.

3.1 Corpus for SMT Training and Testing

A prime  need  for  any  SMT  system  is  good 
quality bi-lingual corpus. We have used manually 
translated  bi-lingual  corpus  of  size  49000 
sentences for training the translation model. The 
49000 bi-lingual  corpus of Health and Tourism 
domains  contained  854995 Hindi  words  and 
644878 Marathi words. Language model training 
was done using monolingual Hindi corpus of size 
72394 sentences. A set of 1000 unseen sentences 
has been used for testing the systems. The test set 
contained  500  sentences  from  Health  and 
Tourism each. Table 4 summarizes the Training 
and Testing data.

3.2 Splitting Marathi Words

To  tackle  the  described  morphological 
complexity of Marathi for the purpose of better 
SMT system we have  devised  an  algorithm to 
split inflected and compound Marathi words. The 
splitting  algorithm  uses  a  list  of  suffix  and 
commonly  compounded  words  as  suffixes, 
combinedly referred as suffix list hereafter. The 
list  is created from the available bi-lingual and 
monolingual corpus.

3.2.1 Creating Suffix List

To  develop  the  Marathi  Splitter  we  trained  an 
alignment (GIZA++; Och and Ney, 2003) model 
to  get  the  Marathi-Hindi   phrase  alignments. 
Upon   training  we  extracted  Marathi  words 
which  align  to  multiple  Hindi  words  from the 
alignment table. The extracted Marathi word set 
was then manually analyzed to develop a list of 
valid  compound  words.  From  the  list  of  valid 
compound  words,  we  further  extracted  high 
frequency suffixes. On manual analysis of these 
suffixes a valid list of suffixes for splitting (list 1) 
was  developed.  We  also  analyzed  the  Marathi 
corpus  and  extracted  words  with  length  more 
than 10 (as the average word length for Marathi 
is 8). These extracted words were then manually 
analyzed  to  get  a  comprehensive  list  of 
compound suffixes (list 2). The final set of 129 
suffixes was a combination of list 1 and list 2. 

3.2.2 Splitter Algorithm

The algorithm splits a given Marathi word if it 
contains a suffix from the list created. Figure 1 
shows  pseudo-code  for  Marathi  Splitter.  The 
algorithm  will  split  Marathi  word 
'उपाहारगहृासारखी'  (upahargruhasarkhi  –  like 

restaurant) into  'उपाहारगहृ'  (upahargruha – 
restaurant)  and  'ाासारखी'  (aasarkhi)  which  are 
valid and invalid dictionary words respectively. 
In  case  of  'ाासारखी'  (aasarkhi),  'ाा' (aa) is  a 
Sandhi marker and 'सारखी'  (sarkhi) means 'like' 
in  English.  Word  'पसारमाधयमकेद' 
(prasarmadhyamkendra –  media  center)  on 
splitting will give 'पसारमाधयम’ (prasarmadhyam - 
media) and 'केद' (kendra – center) which are valid 
dictionary words. Though most of the splits give 
at least one valid dictionary word, there are cases 
where it fails to do so. Like in case of 'घेणयाचा' 
(ghenyacha  – to  take),  the  splits  will  be  'घेणय' 
(ghenya)  and  ' ााचा'  (aacha),  where  both  are 
invalid dictionary words.

3.3 SMT System Setup

The  baseline  system  was  setup  by  using  the 
phrase-based model (Och and Ney, 2003; Brown 
et al.,  1990; Marcu and Wong, 2002; Koehn et 
al., 2003) and Koehn et al. (2007) was used for 
factored  model.  The  language  model  (5-gram) 
was  trained  using  KenLM  (Heafield,  2011) 
toolkit  with  modified  Kneser-Ney  smoothing 
(Chen and Goodman, 1998). For factored SMT 
training  source  and  target  side  stem  has  been 
used  as  alignment  factor.  Stemming  has  been 
done  using  Ramanathan  and  Rao  (2003) 
lighweight stemmer for Hindi. The stemmer for 
Marathi  has  been  developed  by  modifying 
Ramanathan and Rao (2003).

3.4 Evaluation Metrics

The  different  experimental  systems  have  been 
evaluated using,  BLEU (Papineni  et  al.,  2002), 
NIST (Doddington,  2002),  position-independent 
word  error  rate  (Tillmann  et  al.,  1997),  word 
error  rate  (Nießen  et  al.,  2000)  and  manual 
evaluations. For a MT system to be better, higher 
BLEU  and  NIST  scores  with  lower  position-
independent  word  error  rate  (PER)  and  word 
error rate (WER) are desired.

4 Experiments and Results

In the following subsections we discuss different 
SMT systems  and  their  performance.  We  also 
study the impact of splitting on output of SMT 
systems.  Further  we  discuss  methodologies  to 
improve  splitting  and  hence  the  translation 
quality.

4.1 Impact of Splitting

For training the translation model we used 49K 
bi-lingual  corpus  and  language  model  was 
developed  using  72.394K Hindi  sentences.  We 
used splitting discussed in section 3.2.2, as a pre-
processing  step  for  training  phrase-based  and 
factored  SMT  systems,  MH3  and  MH4 
respectively. The systems are described in Table 
5.

Results  for the systems described in Table 5 
are detailed in Table 6. Impact of splitting can be 
observed by comparing MH1 and MH3. We also 
notice that factored systems, MH2 and MH4 are 
performing  better  than  phrase-based  systems, 
MH1  and  MH3  respectively.  The  significant 
improvements  in  all  evaluation  metrics 
demonstrate  that  splitting  of  Marathi  words  is 
helping to achieve better translation quality.

MH1 MH2 MH3 MH4
BLEU 38.35 38.55 41.71 42.01
NIST 7.756 7.778 7.982 8.023
PER 42.08 42.15 39.58 39.28
WER 35.82 35.61 32.21 31.91

Table 6. Experiment Results (in %)

Upon analysis of the translations by MH4, we 
noticed  that  some  of  the  words  were  getting 
wrongly translated. For example 'वरात' (varat – A 
marriage function) which should not have been 
split,  was  split  into  'वर'  (var)  and  ' ाात' (aat) 
resulting into incorrect translation as 'पर है' (par 
hai – over/at). How to tackle such errors? Can we 

use  length  constraints  to  prohibit  such  words 
from splitting? Can POS (NNP) constrain help? 
These questions lead us to investigate further. We 
experimented various combinations of length and 
POS constraints which are described in following 
section.

4.2 Constrained Splitting

We use splitting discussed in section 3.2.2, as a 
pre-processing step for  training various phrase-
based and factored SMT systems. However, we 
apply constraints over word length and POS tag 
before  splitting.  The  systems  with  different 
constraints are described in Table 7.  For MH5, 
MH7,  MH8  and  MH9,  words  with  character 
length at least five were considered for splitting. 
This particular length constraint was selected as 
it gave maximum BLEU score, on experimenting 
with different lengths ranging from 4 to 8. For 
MH5  and  MH6  pre-processing  was  performed 
only once. To tackle words like 'आजारापंासूनसुदा' 
(aajaranpasunsuddha), formed by compounding 
N  multiple  words,  they  need  to  be  split  N-1 
times.  We  have  tried  to  handle  these  cases  in 
MH7, MH8 and MH9 by two level  and multi-
level splitting as detailed in Table 7. In MH7 a 
word  was  subjected  to  pre-processing  twice, 
whereas in case of MH8 and MH9, the same was 
done  as  long  as  the  word  satisfies  length 
criterion.  Further,  with  the  aim  to  prohibit 
splitting  of  named  entities  like  'परमेशवर' 
(parmeshwar),  'पेशावर '  (peshawar)  and  'खरात ' 
(kharat),  we  tried  applying  NNP  POS  tag 
constraint in MH6.

Syntactically ill-formed / semantically unacceptable below 40% 1 point grade scale
No output / garbage output - 0 point grade scale

Table 9. Grading Scheme

Table 8 details the results obtained on different 
evaluation metrics for the experimental systems. 
We can see that among all, the highest BLEU and 
NIST  scores  are  achieved  by  MH9  which  is 
factored SMT system and makes use of  length 
constrained  multi-level  splitting.  There  is  not 
much difference in  BLEU for  MH3 and MH5. 
But  MH7  and  MH8  show  significant 
improvement  in  BLEU  over  MH3.  BLEU  for 
MH6 is slightly decreased, as many words like 
'राजसथानात'  (rajasthanat –  in Rajasthan) which 
are candidates for splitting are not  getting split 
because of their NNP POS tag. Use of a Marathi 
NER may be experimented to tackle this issue in 
future. In next section, we have further analyzed 
and  compared  manual  evaluation  and  10-fold 
cross  validation  for  some  of  these  systems  to 
better understand the performance difference.

5 Analysis and Discussion

We  discuss  here,  manual  evaluation,  10-fold 
cross validation  and error  analysis followed by 
comparative study with the existing work. MH1, 
MH3,  MH5,  MH8  and  MH9  only  have  been 
considered for manual evaluation, as comparison 
of these systems is  sufficient  to understand the 
contribution of splitting to translation quality.

5.1 Manual Evaluation

Figure  2  shows  manual  evaluation  of  systems 
(MH1,  MH3,  MH5,  MH8  and  MH9)  for  50 
random  sentences  from  the  test  set.  For  the 
evaluation,  sentences  were  translated  using 
systems  under  study  and  graded  as  per  the 
scheme detailed in Table 9.

Figure  2  shows  that  among  the  systems 
compared, MH9 has highest number of sentences 
with accuracy more than 80%. We can also see 
that use of constraints on splitting in MH5 has 
helped reduce the number of sentences in grade 2 
as  compared  to  MH3.  That  shows,  semantic 
acceptance of translations is increasing with the 
use of constrained splitting. 

Table  11  describes  with  the  help  of  an 
example,  improvement  in  the  quality  of 
translation  upon  use  of  splitting.  In  the  input 
sentence,  words  'वलसाडचया'  (valsadchya  –  of 
Valsad)  and  'िकनार्‍यावर'  (kinaryavar  –  on  the 
bank)  are candidates for  splitting.  These words 
are split into 'वलसाड' (valsad) + 'चया' (chya) and 
'िकनार्‍या' (kinarya) + 'वर' (var), respectively.  We 
can see that the MH1 is unable to translate the 
word  'वलसाडचया'  (valsadchya),  whereas  MH9 
has correctly translated it into 'वलसाड के' (valsad 
ke  –  of  Valsad)  as  expected  in  the  reference 
translation.

5.2 10-Fold Cross Validation

To  correctly  compare  the  performance  of  the 
systems,  we  also  did  10-fold  cross  validation. 
Results  for the same are available in Table 10. 
We can see that significant BLEU increment in 
all folds of MH5 which makes use of splitting, is 
consistent in comparison to MH1. Also we can 
infer that multi-level (MH8) splitting is slightly 
better  than  two-level  (MH7)  and  one-level 
(MH5) splitting.   

5.3 Error Analysis

In the following subsections we analyze different 
errors in splitting.

7



5.3.1 Superfluous Splitting

With  the  splitting,  Marathi  word  'िदलावर'  
(dilawar) is getting split into 'िदला'  (dila) + 'वर' 
(war) which is a wrong split. 'िदलावर' (dilawar) is 
a proper noun and hence should not have been 
split. We tried to overcome this error using NNP 
POS tag constraint, but that was stopping many 
other  valid  candidates  from  splitting.  Many 
words  like  'राजसथानात'  (rajasthanat  –  in 
Rajasthan)  have NNP as  POS tag and still  are 

valid candidates for splitting; applying NNP POS 
constraint prohibits them from being split, which 
doesn't help in reducing sparsity in training.

5.3.2 Bad Split

Word like 'जमरनीतील' (jarmanitil) is getting split 
into  'जमरनीत'  (jarmanit)  +  ' ाील '  (il)  which 
actually  should  have  been  split  into  'जमरनी'  
(jarmani) +'तील' (til). Similarly many words on 
splitting aren't giving any valid word which also 
doesn't help in reducing sparsity in training.

5.4 Comparative study with Similar Work

Not  much work  has  been  done  for  Marathi  to 
Hindi Machine Translation and we compare our 
work with the existing systems in our knowledge. 
We found that the proposed system outperforms 
all  the  existing  systems  (Kunchukuttan  et  al., 
2014; Shreelekha et al., 2013 and Bhosale et al., 
2011). Table 13 details scores for the systems to 
be compared. To compare the manual evaluation 
we have used formula given in Figure 3 (Bhosale 
et al., 2011).

Accuracy= (1*N4+0.8*N3+0.6*N2)/N
 

N4: Number of score 4 sentences
N3: Number of score3 sentences
N2: Number of score 2 sentences
N: Total Number of sentences

6 Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper, we presented a factored Marathi to 
Hindi SMT system, which makes use of source 
side  splitting  and  shows  significantly  higher 
accuracy than the baseline.  More work remains 
to  be  done  next  to  further  take  advantage  of 
splitting  by  using  sophisticated  methodologies 
for  the  same.  For  example,  suffix  list  can  be 
enriched  to  include  more  suffixes,  complex 
constraints  can  be  applied  to  reduce  negative 
impact  of  splitting,  source  language  dictionary 
can  be  used  to  guide  splitting  and  sandhi 
correction can also be exploited to generate valid 
words out of splitting. The same approach can be 
applied to other language pairs with similarities 
to  Marathi  and  Hindi.  SMT  for  Dravidian 
languages to Hindi is planned to be considered 
next.
