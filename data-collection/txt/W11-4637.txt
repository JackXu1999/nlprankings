Abstract

Plagiarism detection is a challenge for
linguistic models — most current im-
plemented models use simple occurrence
statistics for linguistic items. In this paper
we report two experiments related to pla-
giarism detection where we use a model
for distributional semantics and of sen-
tence stylistics to compare sentence by
sentence the likelihood of a text being
partly plagiarised. The result of the com-
parison are displayed for visual inspection
by a plagiarism assessor.

1 Plagiarism detection

Plagiarism is the act of copying or including
another author’s ideas, language, or writing,
without proper acknowledgment of the original
source. Plagiarism analysis is a collective term for
computer-based methods to identify plagiarism.
(Stein et al., 2007a) Plagiarism analysis can be
performed intrinsically — a text is examined for
internal consistency, to detect suspicious passages
that appear to diverge from the surrounding text,
or externally — a text is inspected with respect to
some known corpus to find passages with suspi-
ciously similar content to other text.

In external plagiarism detection, it is assumed
that the source document dsrc for a given plagia-
rized document dplg can be found in a target docu-
ment collection D. Typically, plagiarism detection
then proceeds in three stages:

1. candidate selection through retrieval of a set
of candidate source documents Dsrc is re-
trieved from Dplg;

∗This work is performed at SICS, supported by the
Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsrådet) through the
project “Distributionally derived grammatical analysis mod-
els” as part of Per Almquist’s M Sc program at the Royal
Institute of Technology (KTH), Stockholm

2. candidates dsrc from Dsrc is compared pas-
sage by passage with the suspicious docu-
ment dplg and every case where a passage
from dplg appears to be similar to some pas-
sage in some dsrc is noted;

3. followed by some post-processing to remove
false hits.(Stein et al., 2007b; Potthast et al.,
2010)

2 PAN workshop series

A series of workshops on Plagiarism Analysis,
Authorship Identification, and Near-Duplicate De-
tection, organised since 2007, have provided the
field with a shared task and test materials in the
form of gold standard text collections with manu-
ally and automatically constructed plagiarised sec-
tions marked for experimental purposes. Some of
the plagiarised sections are obfuscated with word
replacement, edits, and permutations. The re-
search results from the workshops are compara-
ble, since they are to a large extent performed on
the same materials using the same starting points
and same target measures.

Example results relevant to this study (and on
the whole none too surprising) are that unobfus-
cated plagiarism can be detected with a reasonable
accuracy by the top plagiarism detectors. The re-
call decreases slightly with increasing obfuscation
and that longer stretches of plagiarised material
are easier to detect than shorter segments.(Potthast
et al., 2010)

3 Our experimental set-up

The base of the experiment described here is to
test a finer-grained analysis of plagiarised texts
than other previous work. We use a sentence-by-
sentence comparison of the suspicious text (dplg)
with all sentences of each target text (dsrc) in Dsrc
using two different similarity measures: one based

The experiment is not a full scale evaluation of
our method but is intended to test the practicabil-
ity of our approach. Given that we have a sus-
picious text and some reasonable number of can-
didate source texts (through some retrieval proce-
dure) — can we detect the likelihood of plagia-
rism in a text by inspecting the sentence sequence
of the suspicious text one by one? This paper re-
ports a selected plot dry run of the methodology
performed over a number of sample texts.

3.1 Data

The experiments are performed on the PAN-PC-
09(Potthast et al., 2009)1 corpus since it can be
used free of charge for research and contains
plagiarized passages which has previously been
marked and labeled as plagiarism, so that we know
beforehand which passages are plagiarism.

The corpus is divided in two sets, one for train-
ing and one for test. The training set is further di-
vided into three parts (Dplg, Dsrc, and L). Dplg
contain the documents that are suspicious and
might plagiarize documents in Dsrc, where Dsrc
contain only orginal documents that make out the
sources of any plagiarism in Dplg, and L is the so-
lution, the labeling that tells us which sentences in
Dplg that plagiarize what sentence in Dsrc.

3.2 Nearest neighbour metrics
We use cosine similarity (as defined in equation 1)
to represent how similar two vectors are.

simCOS(~x, ~y) =
~x · ~y
|~x||~y| =

∑n
i=1

xiyi√∑n
i=1

x2i
√∑n

i=1
y2i

(1)

For every sentence s ∈ dplg its nearest neighbour
score (as defined in equation 2) is calculated.

max(simCOS(s, x)) for all sentences x ∈ Dsrc (2)

The nearest neighbour metric has the fortunate
feature that a value of 1 describes identical or
duplicate vectors. So if we were to find nearest
neighbour values of 1 those two sentences would
be very alike and therefore we would be able to as-
sume that the newer sentence plagiarizes the older
sentence.

In this experiment two settings for the experi-
ment were used. In experiment one below we eval-
uate how well the nearest neighbour metric of two
vectors in a semantic word-space model manage
to detect plagiarism. In experiment two below we
evaluate how well the nearest neighbour metric of
two binary vectors based on 19 different stylomet-
ric features manage to detect plagiarism.

3.3 Target plots
As an example plagiarism inspection mechanism
we plot the nearest neighbour metric with the sen-
tences of a text along the x-axis against the score
of the sentence. The objective is to find a stretch of
material where several sentences have high nearest
neighbour scores. As a comparison we will plot
the gold standard plagiarism labeling of respective
sentence and let the label for a sentence being pla-
giarism have value 1 and 0 otherwise. Now we
can just plot our nearest neighbour scores and our
modified labels against the sentences in the cor-
pus.

3.4 Experiment 1: semantic similarity
The sentences of dplg were compared by seman-
tic similarity using a word-space model (Schütze,
1993) as a base for computing similarity between
sentences. Each sentence was represented by the
centroid of its constituent words in a word-space
trained on the entire test corpus. The implemen-
tation was based on previous work on effective
word-space models.

“The word-space model is a computational model
of word meaning that utilizes the distributional pat-
terns of words collected over large text data to rep-
resent semantic similarity between words in terms
of spatial proximity.” (Sahlgren, 2006).

Table 2: Plots of semantic and stylometric similarity for texts with known plagiarized sections

The word-space model, from the work in (Kan-
erva, 1988) and (Sahlgren, 2006), models the
meaning of words according to their distribution,
creating a representation of their semantics based
on where and how in the text the words appear.
The word-space is a high dimensional vector space
where every word is represented by a vector. Two
words are semantically similar if their respective
vectors are similar. For example the words "yel-
low" and "green" could be argued to have similar
semantic meaning. So the vectors for yellow and
green should be expected to be similar as seen in
figure 1.

Figure 1: The vectors for the words "yellow" and
"green" in a semantic space.

The word-space model is, as its name implies,
mainly used to model words. It can however be
used to model other linguistic entities such as sen-
tences and documents using workarounds. A sen-
tence can be represented by taking the centroid of
the sentence’s individual word’s vectors. There-
fore if the sentence "A yellow car." was changed
to "A green car." the centroid ought not to change

too much since the only change to the centroid
would be one vector that in the first case repre-
sented the word "yellow" and in the second case
the word "green" and these vectors should be fairly
similar, as seen in figure 2. In our model we use a
semantic word-space to model sentences under the
hypothesis that if a sentence were to be obfuscated
its semantic similarity would be kept. We build a
semantic space for the corpus under consideration
and assign each sentence a representative centroid
vector of 3000 real dimensions for every sentence
in the corpus. We then perform, for every sentence
vector ~s from Dplg, the nearest neighbour search
nn(~s, ~ssrc) against all the vectors ~ssrc in Dsrc.

3.5 Experiment 2: stylometric similarity

The 19 stylometric features that were chosen can
be seen in table 1, and were chosen based on
the work in (Biber, 1988) and (Karlgren, 2000).
Our intention was to capture the authors’ writing
styles. We tried to find features that would not

change if another author were to copy the text and
even obfuscate it. Therefore we chose features that

• binds the texts to its topic, such as numbers
or units of measurement.

• anchors the text to its context, i.e. named en-
tities, location or time.

• captures peculiarities in the author’s writing
style: split infinitives or stranded preposi-
tions.

• indicates how complex the language is, such
as long sentences or subordinate clauses.

For every sentence in Dplg we extracted the sty-
lometric features into a 19th dimensional binary
vector ~f . We then extracted 470 unique 19th di-
mensional binary vectors Fsrc, based on the same
stylometric features, from Dsrc. Then we per-
formed the nearest neighbour search nn(~f, ~fsrc)
against all the vectors ~fsrc in Fsrc.

4 Results and Conclusions

Table 2 shows the results for the nearest neighbour
scores for both experiments, run on a test text with
a known plagiarized section with the correspond-
ing source text. We have three plots represent-
ing different levels of obfuscation of plagiarism,
namely; a high level of obfuscation, a low level of
obfuscation, and no obfuscation. To determine the
effectiveness of each nearness measure, the results
(red rhomboids) are displayed together with an in-
dication of which section of the text is plagiarized
(blue squares) noted with a score of 1 and a score
of 0 for the non-plagiarized sections.

4.1 Experiment 1: semantic similarity

We find that the semantic space model (1) is a
good detector for no obfuscation; (2) does not
hold up for obfuscated materials, neither for low
or high obfuscation since it is based on the pres-
ence of each word in the text; and consequentially
(3) needs tuning so that specifically topical terms
are weighted up compared to less topical terms.
This should be done specifically for the topic in the
candidate document being examined, since pre-
sumably the topic under consideration is the most
likely topic to be plagiarized.

4.2 Experiment 2: stylometric similarity
We find that the stylometric similarity score (1)
which is a dramatic dimensionality reduction un-
surprisingly gives a large number of false positives
for all levels of obfuscation; and (2) gives a com-
paratively high precision even for a high level of
obfuscation.

4.3 Directions
Coming experiments will establish whether the
combination of the two knowledge sources and the
preservation of sequence information in the can-
didate source texts might provide effective results
for a plagiarism detection task. Previous experi-
ments on sequence encoding of stylistic informa-
tion seem to indicate that sequential information
can contain the right type of information to distin-
guish writing style. (Karlgren and Eriksson, 2007)
