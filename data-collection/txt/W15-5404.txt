Abstract
In this paper a methodology for learn-
ing the complex agglutinative morphology
of some Indian languages using Adaptor
Grammars and morphology rules is pre-
sented. Adaptor grammars are a compo-
sitional Bayesian framework for grammat-
ical inference, where we define a mor-
phological grammar for agglutinative lan-
guages and morphological boundaries are
inferred from a plain text corpus. Once
morphological segmentations are produce,
regular expressions for sandhi rules and or-
thography are applied to achieve the final
segmentation. We test our algorithm in the
case of two complex languages from the
Dravidian family. The same morphologi-
cal model and results are evaluated com-
paring to other state-of-the art unsuper-
vised morphology learning systems.

1 Introduction

Morphemes are the smallest individual units that
form words. For example, the Malayalam word
(മലക�െട, malakaḷuṭe, related to mountains) con-
sists of several morphemes ( stem mala, plural
marker kal, and genitive case marker uṭe). Mor-
phological segmentation is one of the most studied
tasks in unsupervised morphology learning (Ham-
marström and Borin, 2011). In unsupervised mor-
phology learning, the words are segmented into
corresponding morphemes with any supervision,
as for example morphological annotations. It pro-
vides the simplest form of morphological analy-
sis for languages that lack supervised knowledge
or annotation. In agglutinative languages, there is
a close connection between suffixes and morpho-
syntactic functions and thus, in those languages
the morphological segmentation may approximate
morphological analysis well enough. Most un-
supervised morphological segmentation systems

have been developed and tested on a small set of
European languages (Creutz and Lagus, 2007a),
mainly English, Finnish and Turkish, with few ex-
ceptions in Semitic languages (Poon et al., 2009).
These languages show a variety of morphologi-
cal complexities, including inflection, agglutina-
tion and compounding. However, when applying
those systems on other language groups with their
own morphological complexities, we cannot ex-
pect the good results demonstrated so far to be au-
tomatically ported into those languages. We as-
sume that morphological similarities of same lan-
guage family enable us to define a general model
that work across all languages of the family.
In this paper we work with a set of Indian lan-

guages that are highly agglutinated, with words
consisting of a root and a sequence of possi-
bly many morphemes and with each suffix cor-
responding to a morpho-syntactic function such
as case, number, aspect, mood or gender. In ad-
dition to that, they are highly and productively
compounding, allowing the formation of very long
words incorporating several concepts. Thus, the
morphological segmentation in those languages
may partially look like a word segmentation task,
which attempts to split the words in a sentence.
Dravidian languages (Steever, 2003) are a group

of Indian languages that shows extensive use of
morpho-phonological changes in word or mor-
pheme boundaries during concatenation, a process
called sandhi. This process also occurs in Euro-
pean languages (Andersen, 1986), but it becomes
more important in the case of Dravidian languages
as they use alpha-syllabic writing systems. (Taylor
and Olson, 1995).
Recently, interest has shifted into semi-

supervised morphological segmentation that en-
ables to bias the model towards a certain language
by using a small amount of annotated training data.
We also adopt semi-supervised learning to more
effectively deal with the complex orthography

17



of the Dravidian languages. We use the Adaptor
Grammars framework (Johnson et al., 2007a) for
implementing our segmentation models that has
been shown to be effective for semi-supervised
morphological segmentation learning (Sirts and
Goldwater, 2013) and it provides a computational
platform for building Bayesian non-parametric
models and its inference procedure. We learn the
segmentation patterns from transliterated input
and convert the segmented transliterations into the
orthographic representation by applying a set of
regular expressions created from morphological
and orthographic rules to deal with sandhi.
We test our system on twomajor languages from

the Dravidian family— Malayalam and Kannada.
These languages, regardless of their large number
of speakers, can be considered resource-scarce, for
which not much annotated data available for build-
ing morphological analyzer. We build a model
that makes use of languages morphological and or-
thographic similarities. In Section 2, we list them
main morphological and orthographic similarities
of these languages.
The structure of this paper is as follows. In

Section 2 we describe more thoroughly the mor-
phological and orthographic challenges presented
in Dravidian languages. Section 3 describes the
Adaptor Grammars framework. In section 4, we
describe the morphological segmentation system
for the Dravidian languages. Experimental setup
is specified in Section 5, followed by the results
and analysis in section 6 and conclusions in Sec-
tion 7.

2 Morphology of Dravidian languages

In this study we focus on Kannada andMalayalam,
which are two major languages in the south Dra-
vidian group. These languages are inflected and
highly agglutinative, which make them morpho-
logically complex. The writing systems of these
languages are alpha-syllabic, i.e. each symbol rep-
resents a syllable. In this section we discuss mor-
phological and orthographic similarities of these
languages in detail.

2.1 Orthography

Kannada and Malayalam follow an alpha-syllabic
writing system in which individual symbols are
syllables. In both languages symbols are called
akṣara. The atomic symbols are classified
into two main categories (svaraṁ, vowels) and

(vyaṅṅajnaṁ, consonants). Both languages have
fourteen vowels, (including a, ā, i, ī, u,
ū, e, ē, ai, o, ō, au, aṁ)1, where aṁ is
an anusvāram, which means nasalized vowel. Ta-
ble 1 shows some examples of their orthographic
representation. These vowels are in atomic form
but when they are combined with consonant sym-
bols, the vowel symbols change to ligatures, re-
sulting in consonant ligatures (see examples in Ta-
ble 2).

Malayalam അ എ ഒ ഉ
Kannada ಅ ಇ ಈ ಉ

Table 2: Consonant ligature

ISO Transliteration m ī mī
Malayalam മ ഈ മീ
Kannada ಮ ಈ Ģೕ

Orthography of both languages supports a large
number of compound characters resulting from the
combination of two consonants symbols, as those
shown in Table 3.

Table 3: Compound characters
ISO Transliteration cca kka
Malayalam � �
Kannada ಚ© ಕ¤

The orthographic systems contain characters for
numerals and Arabic numerals are also present in
the system. See examples in table 4

2.2 Sandhi changes
Sandhi is a morpho-phonemic change happening
in the morpheme or word boundaries at the time
of concatenation. Both Kannada and Malayalam
have three major kinds of sandhi formations: dele-
tion, insertion and assimilation. In the case of dele-
tion sandhi, when two syllables are joined together
one of the syllable is deleted from the resulting
combination, while insertion sandhi adds one syl-
lable when two syllables are joined together. The
sandhi formations found in Sanskrit are also found
in these languages as these languages loan large

dard: ISO-15919

number of roots from Sanskrit. There are language
specific sandhi, such as visarga sandhi. Visarga
sandhi is commonly found in the case of loaned
words from Sanskrit. Visarga is an allophone
of phonemes /r/ and /s/ at the end of the utter-
ance. Kannada orthography keeps the symbol for
visarga butMalayalam orthography uses column
symbol for representing it. As languages follow
alpha-syllabic orthography, these sandhi changes
will change the orthography of the resulting word,
examples are listed in Table 5. In the examples,
when theMalayalam stem maḻa (mountain) joined
to āṇ (is), a new syllable y introduced to resulting
word maḻayāṇ. Similarly in the case of Kannada
stem magu, when joined with annu, the resulting
word maguyannu also includes an extra syllable
y. These similarities between languages enable us
to define a generic finite-state traducer for ortho-
graphic changes that are caused by phonological
changes. An example of created rule for addition
of syllabley is that when (a) is preceded with (u)
and (a) a new syllable is y is added with resulting
word.

Table 5: Sandhi Changes
Language Insertion sandhi
Malayalam maḻa+āṇ→ maḻayāṇ
Kannada Magu+annu→ maguyannu

2.3 Morphology

Due to those orthographic properties of Dravid-
ian languages, morpheme boundaries are marked
at the syllabic level. However, during concate-
nation, phonological changes sandhi may occur,
so that the resulting word has a different orthog-
raphy than the individual segments concatenated
together. That means the surface form may be
different from the lexical form. For example, in
Malayalam the surface form of the word ക�ി�
(kaṇṭilla) corresponds to the lexical form ക�
+ ഇ� (kaṇṭu + illa). The changes in orthog-
raphy in surface form when lexical units are com-
bined are present in this example. Kannada also
exhibits similar properties.

Malayalam and Kannada use case markers for
nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, instru-
mental, locative, and sociative (Agesthialingom
and Gowda, 1976). In both languages, nouns in-
flect with gender, number, and case. Gender is
marked for masculine and feminine, while neuter
corresponds to the absence of gender marker.
There are two categories of number markers: sin-
gular and plural. Both languages can use plu-
ral markers for showing respect. For example,
the Kannada word (�ಾಯು vāyu wind) is inflected
with masculine gender marker. Similarly, the
Malayalam word (വാ� vāyu wind) has a mascu-
line gender marker. In the case of verb morphol-
ogy, both languages inflect with tenses, mood, and
aspect. Where mood can follow arative, subjunc-
tive, conditional, imperative, presumptive , abil-
itative, and habitual. Aspect markers can follow
three categories, such as simple, progressive, pur-
posive. For example, the Kannada sentence (�ಾನು
ಬಂದು Nānu bandu I come), the verb bandu in-
flected with present tense marker u. Similarly the
Malayalam sentence (താരം വ� tāraṁ vannu Star
comes), the verb vannu inflected with u, which is
the present tense marker.
Compounding acts as another challenge in Dra-

vidian languages where words can have a recursive
compound structure. There can be compounds em-
bedded in a compound word, which itself can be-
come another compound (Mohanan, 1986). For in-
stance, in Malayalam (jātimātaviduveṣaṅṅaḷ,
hatred of caste and religion) consist of first com-
pound (jāti + māta, caste and religion), joined
with other compound (viduveṣam, hatred) and
plural inflection ṅṅaḷ.

3 Adaptor Grammars

Adaptor Grammars (AG) (Johnson et al., 2007a)
is a non-parametric Bayesian framework for per-
forming grammatical inference over parse trees.
AG has two components—a PCFG (Probabilistic
Context Free Grammar) and an adaptor function.
The PCFG specifies the grammar rules used to
generate the data. The adaptor function transforms
the probabilities of the generated parse trees so that
the probabilities of the adapted parse trees may be
substantially larger than under the conditionally in-
dependent PCFG model. Various Bayesian non-
parametric models can be used as Adaptor func-
tion, such as HDP (Teh et al., 2006). For instance,
the Pitman-Yor Adaptor (Johnson et al., 2007a),

19



which is also used in this work, transforms the
probability of an adapted parse tree in such a way
that it is proportional to the number of times this
tree has been observed elsewhere in the data. We
provide an informal description of adaptor gram-
mar here. An adaptor grammar consists of ter-
minals V and non-terminals N , (including a start
symbol, S), and initial rule set R with probabil-
ity p, like a Probabilistic Context Free Grammar
(PCFG). A non-terminal A ∈ N , has got a vector
of concentration parametersα, whereαA >0. Then
we say non-terminal A is adapted. If αA = 0 then
A is an unadapted non-terminal. A non-terminal
A, which is unadpted expand as in PCFG but an
adapted non-terminal A can expand in two ways:

1. A can expand to a subtree t with probability
nt/nA + αA, where nt is the number of times
A has expanded to t before and

2. Expand as in PCFG considering the probabil-
ity propositional to concentration parameter
αA

Inference on this model can achieved using a sam-
pling procedure . The formal definition of AGs can
be found in (Johnson et al., 2007a), details of the
inference procedures are described in (Johnson et
al., 2007b) and (Johnson and Goldwater, 2009).

4 AGs for morphological segmentation
for Dravidian languages

Dravidian languages are highly agglutinative,
which means that a stem can be attached a se-
quence of several suffixes and several words can
be concatenated together to form compounds. The
segmentation model has to take these language
properties into account.
We can define a grammar reflecting the agglu-

tinative structure of language similar to the com-
pounding grammar of (Sirts and Goldwater, 2013),
excluding prefixes:

Word→ Compound+

Compound→ Stem Suffix∗

Stem→ SubMorphs+

Suffix→ SubMorphs+

(1)

Segmentation of long agglutinated sentences is
the aim of above described grammar, where we
consider that words are composed of words2 and

2The word ”compound” is used in our representation for
words

words can be composed of Stem and Suffix, where
Stem and Suffix are adapted non terminals, which
are ”adapted” with Pitman-Yor Process (Pitman
and Yor, 1997). Both Stem and Suffix can gen-
erated from drawing of Pitman-Yor process or by
following PCFG rule. If these non-terminals ex-
pand according to PCFG rule, it expand to Sub-
morphs, which is an intermediate levels added be-
fore terminals, For more details refer (Sirts and
Goldwater, 2013)
The Submorphs can be defined in the following

way

Submorphs→ Submorph
Submorphs→ Submorph Submorphs
Submorphs→ Chars

Chars→ Char
Chars→ CharChars

(2)

The Submorphs can be composed of single
morph or Submorhs, which are combinations of
Char. In our case Char is our internal represen-
tation for alpha-syllabic characters. The above
grammar can generate various parse trees as a we
put a Pitman-Yor prior on component. It is going
to produce most probable morphological segmen-
tation based on the prior probabilities. For more
details of this procedure, refer (Johnson and Gold-
water, 2009)
This grammar enables representing long agglu-

tinated phrases that are common in Dravidian lan-
guages. For instance, an agglutinated Malayalam
word phrase sansthānaṅṅaḷileānnāṇ with the
correct morphological segmentation sansth +
ānaṅṅaḷileā + nnāṇ can be represented using the
grammar.
Although this grammar uses the knowledge

about the agglutinative nature of the language,
it is otherwise knowledge-free because it doesn’t
model the specific morphotactic regularities of the
particular language. Next, we experiment with
grammars that are specifically tailored for Dravid-
ian languages and express the specific morphotac-
tic patterns found in those languages. We look
at the regular morphological templates described
in linguistic textbooks (Krishnamurti, 1976) and
(Steever, 2003) rather than generating just a se-
quence of generic Suffixes.

4.1 Dealing with Sandhi

As explained above, the words in Dravidian lan-
guages often undergo phonological changes when
morphemes or compound parts are concatenated
together. Thus, in order to correctly express the
segmented words in script, it is necessary to model
those changes properly.
In this work we deal with sandhi during a post-

processing step where we apply to the segmented
words a set of regular expression rules that de-
scribe the valid sandhi rules. Our approach is sim-
ilar to (Vempaty and Nagalla, 2011) where rules
for orthographic changes are created. However,
we use FST rules at the syllable level. Our method
works with a general phonetic notation, which is
the same for both languages. For example, the
Malayalam word (marannal ̣, trees) is combination
of (maram tree + nnal plural marker). We create a
context sensitive rule for the orthographic change,
which look like V → V m”+”||nnal. In the above
V is set of all syllables in the languages. The same
rule also stands for Kannada orthographic change.
Similarly we create rule for orthographic changes
due to sandhi. One example of finite-state trans-
ducer rule to handle addition sandhi is given in fig-
ure 1. It handles the ya sandhi happens change
during the insertion sandhi. We have 62 rules for
Malayalam and 34 rules for Kannada for handling
sandhi changes. The statistics of the data is shown
in 5.

5 Data and Experiments

We conduct our experiments on word lists ex-
tracted fromWikipedia and newspaper’s websites.
The statistics of the data sets are given in Table 6.
Word list consist of 30 million tokens of Kannada
and 40 million tokens of Malayalam. The data set
consist of named entities, proper names and abbre-

viations. We also have 10k morphologically hand-
segmented words, which act as our gold standard
file.
In order to deal with complex orthographies

of Kannada and Malayalam, we have created a
internal representation, which is unique for both
languages. The conversion was done in fol-
lowing way: the Malayalam word (അേതസമയം ,
atēsamayam) converted in to a t h e s a m y a
m. During this process complex ligatures are con-
verted into corresponding extended ASCII format
and put spaces between the characters. Similarly
a Kannada word (ಮಧ½ದ, madhyada) converted to
m a d y a d a. This representation allow us to use
the same grammar for both languages. The con-
version of orthographic form to internal represen-
tation is as follows. In the first step we have con-
verted language’s scripts to corresponding ISO ro-
manization. This representation helps in getting
unique values for various ligatures and compound
characters. Once the script is converted to ISO ro-
manized form, we convert it into Extended ASCII
form with unique values for each characters. As
part of our experiment, we converted all words in
the lists and morphological segmentations to our
internal representation. For training the AG mod-
els3, we use the scenarios proposed by (Sirts and
Goldwater, 2013) we train the models using 10K,
20K 40k, 50K, 80K most frequent word types in
each language with same grammar and segment
the test data inductively with a parser using the
AG posterior grammar as the trained model. We
run five independent experiments with each setting
for 1000 iterations after which we collect a single
sample for getting the AG posterior grammar.
Using the trained models we segment our gold

standard. Once the AG posterior grammar pro-
duce the morphological segmentation in internal
formwe converted internal representation into cor-
responding orthographic form for evaluation of re-
sult. The process of converting the internal repre-

sentation to orthographic form is as follows. We
take the internal representation of a word one by
one and we apply finite-state rule that takes care
of sandhi and then it convert back to orthography.
The number of finite-state rules, is listed as RE
rules in the Table 5.

6 Evaluation, Error analysis and
Discussion

The evaluation is based on how well the methods
predicts the morpheme boundaries in orthographic
form and calculates precision, recall and F- score.
We used Python suite provided in the morpho-
challenge website4 for evaluation purposes We
also train Morfessor baseline, Morfessor-CAP
and Undivide, with 80K word types. We com-
pare our results with several baselines that have
been previously successfully used for aggluti-
nated languages: Finnish and Turkish. For unsu-
pervised baselines we use Morfessor Categories-
MAP (Creutz and Lagus, 2007b) and Undivide
(Dasgupta and Ng, 2007). We train Morfessor
Categories-MAPwith the 80Kmost frequent word
types and produce a model. Using this model the
gold standard file is segmented and the results are
compared with the manual segmentations. The
same process is carried out in the case of Morfes-
sor baseline. In the case of Undivide, we apply the
system on the gold standard file and get the seg-
mentation. We use Undivide software because it
performed very well in the case of highly inflected
Indian language Bengali. The results are evalu-
ated by computing the segment boundary F1 score
(F1) as is standard for morphological segmentation
task.
The result achieved is presented in the table 7.

In the table (P) stands for Precision and (R) stands
for Recall and (F) stands for F-score.
On the manual analysis of the predicted word

segmentations by our system and other baselines,
we note the following:

• Our system was able to identify the sandhi
changes and orthographic changes due to
sandhi but other systems were unable to do
that because of lack knowledge of orthogra-
phy and sandhi changes.

• In the case of compound characters, Mor-
fessor, Morfessor- MAP and Undivide seg-
mented it into two constituent character,

4http://research.ics.aalto.fi/events/morphochallenge/

which is not required. For example, the
Malayalam character (�, nka) to (n) and (ka).

• All algorithms have divided compounds
words.

We did not evaluated the result produced by the
Adaptor Grammar individually as we need the out-
put in language’s script.

7 Conclusion and future research

We have presented a semi-supervised morphol-
ogy learning technique that uses statistical mea-
sures and linguistic rules. The result of the pro-
posed method outperforms other state-of-art un-
supervised morphology learning techniques. The
major contribution of this paper is the use of same
model of morphology for segmenting two mor-
phologically complex languages and the sandhi
changes in both the languages are handled using
a single finite-state transducer. In essence, we can
consider it as a hybrid system, which make use of
statistical information and linguistic rules together
to produce better results. The experiments show
that morphology of two complex languages can be
learned jointly. Other important aspect of these ex-
periments is that we tested Adaptor Grammars in
the case of complex Indian languages and showed
that it can be used in languages with complex mor-
phology and orthography. The major aim of the
study was to show a general model of morphol-
ogy, which could be used to learn morphology of
two languages. As further research, we intend to
train the system with larger number of tokens and
evaluate the performance in the presence of large
amount of data. As we also noted an improvement
in the performance when the number of word type
increases.
