Abstract

This paper presents a methodology to extract a paraphrase database for the European and Brazil-
ian varieties of Portuguese, and discusses a set of paraphrastic categories of multiwords and
phrasal units, such as the compounds toda a gente vs todo o mundo "everybody" or the gerundive
constructions [estar a + V-Inf] vs [ficar + V-Ger] (e.g., estive a observar vs fiquei observando "I
was observing"), which are extremely relevant to high quality paraphrasing. The variants were
manually aligned in the e-PACT corpus, using the CLUE-Aligner tool. The methodology, in-
spired in the Logos Model, focuses on a semantico-syntactic analysis of each paraphrastic unit
and constitutes a subset of the Gold-CLUE-Paraphrases.1 The construction of a larger dataset of
paraphrastic contrasts among the distinct varieties of the Portuguese language is indispensable for
variety adaptation, i.e., for dealing with the cultural, linguistic and stylistic differences between
them, making it possible to convert texts (semi-)automatically from one variety into another, a
key function in paraphrasing systems. This topic represents an interesting new line of research
with valuable applications in language learning, language generation, question-answering, sum-
marization, and machine translation, among others. The paraphrastic units are the first resource
of its kind for Portuguese to become available to the scientific community for research purposes.

1 Introduction

Paraphrases are linguistic devices that allow to recognize and generate equivalent forms of expressing
the same content, either oral or written, i.e., of saying and writing the same thing/idea using different
wording or syntactic structure. Paraphrases are essential in human communication, both in language
production and understanding. They can occur at various levels: multiword or phrasal unit, phrase,
expression, sentence, paragraph, full text, etc.. Given the scale and nature of paraphrases, paraphrase
research has become an activity of growing importance in natural language processing, and a vital and
strategic area for future language technology industries, ranging from text production, language learning,
dialogue systems and machine translation applications, among others. The work presented here lies
within the scope of ongoing research activities of the eSPERTo project2, which aims to develop an
automated paraphraser to assist writers and language learners in text production and revision. eSPERTo
has the challenging objectives of guaranteeing thorough knowledge of the context, fluency of language,
appropriate style and consistent terminology. Within these objectives, eSPERTo is designed to enable
the adaption of a text within the different varieties of the Portuguese language.

In order to enable variety adaptation, we have analyzed the contrastive pairs of paraphrastic units
aligned and collected from the corpus e-PACT (eSPERTo Paraphrase Aligned Corpus of EN-EP/BP
Translations), a parallel corpus of aligned paraphrases (Barreiro and Mota, 2017). One of the motiva-
tions behind the creation of this corpus was to contrast the European (EP) and Brazilian (BP) varieties

1An approach based on word-level alignment clues is often referred to as the "clue alignment approach" (Tiedemann, 2003)
(Tiedemann, 2011)). In our approach, CLUE is an acronym that stands for "Cross-Language Unit Elicitation" that is based on
manual alignments of multiwords and other phrasal units, which can be monolingual or bilingual.

of Portuguese by exploring monolingual alignments taking into account both similar and differing forms
of expression between them. This approach allows finding vocabulary and expressions common to both
varieties, but also linguistic constructions that constitute lexico-syntactic and stylistic differences be-
tween EP and BP. Breaking away from ad-hoc and random alignment practices, our methodology centers
around the Logos Model (cf. (Scott, 2003), (Barreiro et al., 2011), (Scott, 2018)) and its semantico-
syntactic approach, which results from over 30 years of experience in successful commercial machine
translation.

The paraphrastic units collected, which are common between the two language varieties, are use-
ful to increase eSPERTo’s paraphrasing capabilities, whereas the paraphrastic variants, i.e., multiwords,
phrases or expressions not used in one of the varieties, are useful for variety adaptation. Variety adap-
tation allows, for example, the necessary amending proposals to ensure that eSPERTo’s user text, ways
of expression or style can add clarity to the text and improve its readability in the other Portuguese vari-
ety. Adaptation will also attempt to reduce communication barriers among the Portuguese varieties, and
eventually, contribute to an international variety of Portuguese (cf. (Santos, 2014) and (Santos, 2015)).

The alignments were performed with the support of the CLUE-Aligner tool (Barreiro et al., 2016),
developed to facilitate the alignment of both paraphrasing and translation units in monolingual and in
bitexts, including the alignment of discontinuous multiwords and phrasal units, such as the support verb
constructions fazer [] caminhadas por = dar [] passeios por "taking [] walks through", or ficar contente
"be happy". Within this line of research, we have developed a set of guidelines – CLUE4Paraphrasing
Alignment Guidelines – that use information about the syntactic and semantic properties of phrases to
align paraphrastic correspondences in a monolingual EP–BP sentence pair. Our alignment research fo-
cuses mainly on lexical and semantico-syntactic phenomena that can be, to a greater or lesser extent,
challenging to a paraphrasing system. As the paraphrastic database grows, our aim is to create an auto-
mated alignment model with pre-defined elements and concepts that can be used for future applications
involving monolingual or bilingual alignment tasks.

2 Related Work on Alignments

Paraphrasing systems can be trained using similar methods to those used in machine translation systems3,
i.e., they can be trained with paraphrastic alignments4, which are representations of semantically-
equivalent words, phrases, expressions or sentences within the same language or language variety, such
as EP and BP. The paraphrastic alignment process consists of identifying, analyzing and registering
corresponding phrasal equivalents within pairs of parallel sentences, where the source and the target
sentences correspond to the same language.

Paraphrastic alignments extracted from parallel corpora may be either of high quality or of question-
able quality depending on the quality of those corpora or the quality of the work performed during the
alignment task, respectively. For Portuguese, there is a lack of freely available parallel corpora that can
be used to train and test paraphrasing systems. Linguistic knowledge-based alignments extracted from
good quality corpora can contribute to increased precision and, subsequently, improve the quality of gen-
erated paraphrases. In particular, alignments of paraphrastic units can be extremely useful to collect data
and obtain an adequate dimension of the work to be executed prior to linguistic validation and integration
of good quality data into real-world systems.

Our alignment task consisted of identifying, aligning, and collecting paraphrastic equivalences, i.e.,
multiwords and phrasal units or expressions that represented semantic correspondences in the aligned
sentence pairs of the EP–BP parallel text. The outcome of our alignment task contained a set of individual
paraphrastic alignments between meaningful sequences of words, i.e., linguistically-motivated pairs of
paraphrastic units.5 From an applicational perspective for Portuguese, no research has been done at a

3In machine translation, several works have been published on alignment annotation guidelines or other aspects of alignment
research (cf. (Och and Ney, 2000), (Lambert et al., 2005), (Graça et al., 2008), or (Tiedemann, 2011), among others)

4In comparison to translation alignments, which are representations of semantically-equivalent words, phrases, expressions
or sentences within the source and target sentences of a bilingual or multilingual parallel corpus (Brown et al., 1990).

5In statistics, a sequence of more than one n-gram is commonly called "phrase". Our alignments do not contain statistical
phrases, but linguistic phrases or other linguistic units. Alignments based on random n-grams or statistical phrases do not

level beyond the lexicon. Early work on EP–BP standard and technical language lexical distinctions has
been compiled in a contrastive lexicon (Barreiro et al., 1996) that led to INESC’s Lusolex and Brasilex
dictionaries (Wittmann et al., 2000), but no alignment methods have been used. Despite meagre initial
resources, manually annotated paraphrastic alignments represent an important step in the development
of paraphrasing systems.

3 The eSPERTo Project

Variety adaptation is an important feature of the eSPERTo project, whose main focus is the development
of a paraphrasing system with capacity to produce semantically equivalent sentences and ways of expres-
sion, also when these are contrasting, as in the case of varieties of the same language. Figure 1 illustrates
the usefulness of paraphrases in eSPERTo’s variety adaptation capability, where for a sentence written in
EP, the system offers suggestions to paraphrase and rewrite it in BP (and vice-versa). For example, for
the BP sentence Todo mundo em Plotino tem a mesma vista "Everybody in Plotinus has the same view",
eSPERTo presents toda a gente as the EP suggestion for the BP phrase todo mundo and the EP suggestion
tem a mesma vista for the BP phrase tem vista igual. This adaptation is extremely useful when the user
wants to reach an audience that speaks the variety that he/she is less familiar with.

Figure 1: EP–BP paraphrastic variants toda a gente | todo mundo and tem a mesma vista | tem vista igual

eSPERTo uses semantico-syntactic knowledge to identify multiwords and other phrasal units, and ap-
plies local grammars to transform them into semantically equivalent phrases, expressions, or sentences.
The quantity and quality of the resources have been increasing considerably with the integration of
tables developed within the lexicon-grammar theoretical and methodological framework (cf. (Gross,
1984) and (Gross, 1987)), based on the transformational operator grammar (cf. (Harris, 1952), (Harris,
1965), (Harris, 1991), among others). Lexicon-grammar tables contain distributional and transforma-
tional properties of nominal predicates that can be used in paraphrasing tasks with successful results.
Several lexicon-grammar research works have been describing these predicates in great detail, establish-
ing relations between different types of predicate, and defining properties in tables that can be adapted
and converted into dictionary entries, becoming a useful resource for paraphrasing. Predicates are not
necessarily verbal, they can be nominal too, and they are often used interchangeably without any signif-
icant difference in meaning. There are nominal predicates, both nouns and adjectives, which, like verbs,

have a linguistic motivation or contrastive analysis lying behind them. Even though they represent an efficient intermediate
representation developed for engineering purposes in natural language processing and machine translation systems, they present
shortcomings from a linguistic point-of-view. In "n-grams in search of theories", (Maia et al., 2008) raised the question of the
need to create linguistically more robust n-gram tools, which imply a supporting theoretical or practical framework for the
research on word alignment.

have argumental selection properties. For example, there are adjectives that require complements (e.g.,
ele está desejoso de ir à praia "he is eager to go to the beach"), being classified as transitive adjectives,
and there are adjectives that do not require any complement (e.g., ele está doente "he is sick"), classified
as intransitive adjectives. In these cases, it is not the verb, which in both sentences is the same auxiliary,
está "is", that imposes these argument restrictions, it is the adjective instead. The same can be said with
regard to predicate nouns.

In our research work, three lexicon-grammar tables formalized for EP have recently been added to
expand eSPERTo’s paraphrastic capabilities: (i) the lexicon-grammar of human intransitive adjectives
(Mota et al., 2015), (ii) the lexicon-grammar of predicate nouns co-occurring with the support verb
fazer "do" or "make" (Mota et al., 2017), and (iii) the lexicon-grammar of predicate nouns which co-
occur in constructions with the support verb ser de "be of" (Mota et al., 2018). These resources allow
the generation of paraphrases such as de origem portuguesa "of Portuguese origin/roots" = portugueses
"Portuguese" = de Portugal "from Portugal"; fez uma classificação de NP "made a classification of NP" =
classificou NP "classified NP"; é de uma certa cortesia "is of a certain courtesy" = é cortês "is courteous".
So far, we have not managed to integrate any lexicon-grammar tables for BP, but we would only need to
formalize those entries which are exclusive or differ from the ones in EP.

Even though eSPERTo has been explored in a question-answering system and in a summarization tool
(Mota et al., 2016), the lexicon-grammar integrated resources have not been tested in these applications.
We envisage to test the new paraphrastic resources in an e-learning environment to assist Portuguese
language learners with the editing and revision of texts. But, precise paraphrases can also be helpful in
professional translation, editing, and proofreading, among other tasks.

4 Description of the Paraphrastic Alignment Task

Our paraphrastic alignment task was facilitated by the use of the CLUE-Aligner, an alignment tool that
permits the alignment and storage of both continuous and discontinuous multiwords and other phrasal
units to be used in paraphrasing (and also in translation), i.e., in monolingual or bilingual parallel sen-
tences. Based on the CLUE4Paraphrasing Alignment Guidelines6, we built a gold collection of pairs
of EP–BP paraphrastic variants for the e-PACT corpus. The CLUE4Paraphrasing Alignment Guide-
lines summarize the most important recommendations and decisions for the alignment of multiwords
and phrasal units found in monolingual parallel sentences corresponding to the EP and BP translations
of two books by David Lodge, Therapy and Changing Places.7 The initial e-PACT corpus contained
30% of the two novels extracted from the COMPARA English and Portuguese bidirectional parallel cor-
pus. To create the initial corpus (Barreiro and Mota, 2017), we extracted the first 3 parallel sentences of
each group of 10 parallel sentences, the EBDL1 batch contains 489 sentence alignments and the EBDL3
batch contains 313 sentence alignments, in a total of 802 parallel sentences. For the current work, we
enlarged the original e-PACT with 10% more of the total number of sentences for the 2 novels, which
correspond to the first 4 parallel sentences in each group of 10. This 10% increase corresponds to 163
sentence alignments in a first batch and 312 sentence alignments in a second batch. Therefore, so far, we
manually annotated 40% of the total number of aligned sentences for both novels, in total 1,277 parallel
sentences. From the enlarged e-PACT corpus, we have collected a few thousands of paraphrastic align-
ments that still need to be revised by a Portuguese and a Brazilian linguist before making them publicly
available. From this collection, not all the paraphrastic alignments correspond to contrasts between the
EP and BP varieties of Portuguese. Our goal in exploring monolingual alignments of two varieties of the
same language was not only to capture differing forms of expression between these varieties, but also
take into account paraphrases that can apply to one variety or the other. These variety-free/independent
paraphrases can contribute to the development of the eSPERTo paraphrase acquisition system.

6The CLUE4Paraphrasing Alignment Guidelines are a set of CLUE Alignment Guidelines.
7We have used EP and BP translations of the same English novels as alignment data, because this is a popular and straight-

forward approach to gather parallel paraphrastic data. However, one drawback of this kind of corpora is that there may be a
syntactic and lexical bias carrying over from the English original. It is possible that non-translation corpora may be less biased,
but more difficult to find or prepare.

5 Examples of EP–BP Contrastive Paraphrasing Phenomena

In this Section, we will illustrate several types of EP–BP paraphrases, which constitute real examples
from the e-PACT corpus. We provide the English source sentence for each EP–BP paraphrase case. Lack
of space precludes a detailed description of most of the paraphrasing phenomena found in the corpus.
We have selected a few examples of paraphrastic alignments. All multiwords, phrases and expressions,
including discontinuous ones, have been aligned as illustrated in Figure 2. Due to space limitation
we present only this illustrative image, which represents the paraphrastic alignment pair highlighted in
example (1). The alignment refers to the EP–BP variety contrast between the discontinuous support verb
construction subiram [] em espiral, literally "climbed [] in a spiral" in EP and the BP prepositional verb
espiralando "spiraling up". In EP the predicate noun espiral "spiral" is placed apart from the support
verb subir "climb". The direct object noun phrase insertion in the support verb construction, o tronco
"the branch", aligns independently (not highlighted in this image).

Figure 2: Paraphrastic S-alignment EP - subiram [ ] em espiral | BP - espiralando (por)

5.1 Verbal Constructions
5.1.1 Verbs and Support Verb Constructions
Verbs and support verb constructions are frequent in commutative conditions. Often paraphrastic vari-
ance between EP and BP results from the use of a support verb construction or of a verb, in one or
another direction. There are cases where their respective use is simply related to an arbitrary decision by
the translator. In other cases, the frontier between stylistic choice and variety adaptation is not straight-
forward. In example (1), EP and BP adopt different surface structures (i.e., syntax); EP uses a support
verb construction, while BP uses a verb. These could be simply considered stylistic variants resulting
from the fact that the BP translator translated less conventionally by using a new verb instead of the more
conventional support verb construction, but in a sense there seems to be a more evident translation per-
missibly that is allowed or fostered in BP as far as new vocabulary is concerned.8 A clear stylistic choice
was the translation of the support verb into the past tense, subiram, by the EP translator who arbitrarily
or voluntarily did not maintain the gerundive form used in the English source and in the BP translation.

(1) EN - I watched two playing tag [...] just outside my study window: spiralling up a trunk...
EP - Estive a observar da janela do meu escritório dois esquilos a brincarem à apanhada [...]:
subiram o tronco em espiral...
BP - Fiquei observando os dois esquilos que brincavam de pegapega [...] em frente à janela do meu
estúdio: espiralando pelo tronco...

5.1.2 EP [estar a + V–Inf] versus BP [ficar + V–Ger] Constructions
The use of progressive constructions when aligning EP–BP paraphrases is extremely frequent and there
are many interesting cases that are worth analyzing. However, due to space limitations we focus on: (i)

8While this verb is rather far-fetched even for a Brazilian speaker, it is known that BP speakers are in general less conserva-
tive as far as the formation of new words is concerned. It appears less likely that the verb espiralar would be employed by a EP
native speaker or translator. But, it is also possible that the English gerund spiralling induced a corresponding Portuguese form
espiralando from a translator that would not otherwise have used it, because it is a lexeme less likely to cross someone’s mind.



116

the gerundive infinitive, formed with the auxiliary verb estar "be" (or ficar "remain", or ir "go") plus the
preposition a "at" plus the infinitive form of the main verb: [estar a + V–Inf] (e.g., estar + a + trabalhar
= "to be + working"), used in written EP, and (ii) the gerundive construction made up of the auxiliary
verb estar (or ficar, or ir) plus the present participle (gerundive) of the main verb, which ends with the
suffix -ndo "-ing": [ficar + V–Ger] (e.g., ficar/estar + trabalhando = "to be + working), used in BP.
Example (2) illustrates the contrast between the EP gerundive infinitive, which is formed with the verb
estar in the past imperfect tense (estive) "(I) was", followed by the preposition a, and by the main verb in
the infinitive form, observar "observe", and the BP gerundive form, which is formed with the auxiliary
verb ficar in the preterit tense, fiquei ("(I) remained/stayed"), followed by the gerundive form of the main
verb, observando "observing".

(2) EN - I watched two playing tag [...] just outside my study window:
EP - Estive a observar da janela do meu escritório dois esquilos a brincarem à apanhada [...]:
BP - Fiquei observando os dois esquilos que brincavam de pegapega [...] em frente à janela do meu
estúdio:

5.2 Word Order – Placement of Clitic Pronouns: V–Pro versus Pro V
The placement of the clitic pronoun is different in EP and BP. In EP, the normal position for the clitic
is after the verb and connected to it by an hyphen9 ([(Prep)V]–Pro), while in BP, the normal position
for the clitic is before the verb with no attaching hyphen (Pro [(Prep)V]). As illustrated in example (3),
the prepositional verb10 puseram-me em, literally "(they) put me in", in the EP sentence is a paraphrastic
variant of the prepositional verb me mandaram para "(they) sent me to" in the BP sentence. While there
is a stylistic difference with regards to the translator’s choice of the prepositional verb, the word order
difference is a clear case of EP–BP paraphrastic variance.

(3) EN - My Mum and Dad sent me to Sunday school when I was a nipper...
EP - Os meus pais puseram-me na [em + a] catequese quando ainda era pequeno...
BP - Minha mãe e meu pai me mandaram para a Escola Dominical quando eu era pequeno...

5.3 Lexical versus non-Lexical Realization in Nominal Constructions
Within noun phrases, it is common to find paraphrastic alignments where one element of the pair of
paraphrases contains a lexically-realized determiner or a pronoun and the other element does not contain
them. Section 5.3.1 discusses the alignment of phrases containing determiners with phrases containing
what is known as zero determiners. Section 5.3.2 discusses the EP–BP variance cases involving subject
pronouns, or lack of them, which is normally designated as subject pronoun drop or simply pro-drop.

5.3.1 Determiners and Zero Determiners
The presence of zero articles is common in BP, and less frequent in EP. Aligning a zero determiner with a
lexically realized determiner implies association of the determiner to the noun. Determiners are aligned
together with the noun (single or compound) when they do not appear in one of the varieties (mostly
BP) of an alignment pair. When determiners appear in both variants of the alignment pair, they are also
aligned individually. For example, the noun phrase o Nizar with the definite article o and the named
entity Nizar in EP aligns with the single noun "Nizar" (no determiner) in BP, i.e., the alignment of EP -
[DET N] | BP - [Ø-DET N]. The alignment of phrases with determiners with phrases with no determiners
implies that the lexically realized determiner is associated to the phrase. In example (4), the noun phrase
containing the definite article os in the noun phrase os meus grupos "my groups" in the EP sentence
aligns with the noun phrase without a determiner meus grupos in the BP sentence.

(4) EN - I gather from Busby that you’ll probably be taking over my tutorial groups.
EP - Soube pelo Busby que vai ficar com os meus grupos.
BP - Pelo que Busby me contou, o senhor vai ser o orientador de meus grupos de estudos.

9Although in both EP and BP there are differences between written and spoken language (some correspond to regional
differences), and also between verb tenses or antecedents in the sentence, we will not enter into any of these details here.

10Prepositional verbs are preposition-governing transitive verbs, where the preposition is at the right-hand side of the verb.

Table 1: EP–BP lexical contrasts

5.3.2 Subject Pronoun Drop
The contrast of overt pronouns with omitted or null pronouns is a recurring phenomenon in the alignment
task (e.g., Ø sugeri = Eu disse "I said"). If a personal pronoun is overt in one of the varieties and omitted
in the other variety, alignment should be made on a one-by-two basis. In example (5), the subject pronoun
Ele "He" together with the verb era "was" of the adjectival support verb construction era um desportista
"(he) was a sportsman" in BP aligns with its equivalent without the pronoun Ele in BP.

(5) EN - He was in fact a keen sportsman
EP - Ø Era de facto um desportista hábil
BP - Ele era de fato um esportista aplicado

5.4 Forms of Address – 2nd versus 3rd Person
EP and BP have different forms of addressing people and different forms of courtesy. In EP, the pronoun
tu "you" is used as an informal way of addressing friends and family in casual situations. In formal
situations, it is used the pronoun você (sometimes omitted) with the verb conjugated in the third person
singular. In BP, the most common form of address is você in both formal and informal contexts.11 For
example, tens a certeza is used in EP, while tem certeza "you’re sure" is used in BP. Similarly, não te
importas is used in EP and não se importa "you don’t mind" is used in BP. The form of address is a very
frequent source of EP–BP paraphrastic variance.

(6) EN - You’re sure [Ø] you don’t mind?
EP - Tens a certeza de que não te importas?
BP - Tem certeza de que não se importa?

6 Variety Differences

The most important issue to be considered, at this particular point in our research, is to distinguish be-
tween those paraphrastic alignments that represent stylistic differences but that are natural and fluent
multiwords, expressions or phrases in both the EP and BP varieties, and those paraphrastic alignments
that represent contrastive variance between EP and BP and they cannot be used in commutative condi-
tions in both varieties, i.e., they are exclusively used either in EP or in BP. In the list of contrasts, we
have also registered lexical contrasts, illustrated in Table 1, even though they are not the focus of our
discussion. Table 2 illustrates contrasts of a syntactic nature, i.e., multiwords expressions or phrases that
are used only in EP or only in BP. Future work should focus on the categorization of each one of these
syntactic phenomena, and the creation of grammars that can use these phenomena in more generalized
contexts. This research needs to be deepened and sustained with validation of the contrasts by expert
linguists on both varieties. Table 4 illustrates stylistic contrasts that correspond to valid paraphrases for
both varieties of Portuguese.

Many of the EP–BP contrasts that we have collected have insertions, i.e., elements that are external
to the multiword or phrasal unit, either in the English source or in any of the Portuguese varieties, such

11However, in BP, você can be combined both with the second and third person singular personal pronouns to distinguish
between a more or less familiar person.

as We’re talking [sitcom] here, didn’t make me go to [Sunday School] any more, as mulheres [às vezes]
fazem coisas estranhas, or Já botei [Hal] a par do problema. According to the methodology described in
(Barreiro and Batista, 2016) for translation, we have extracted all these insertions from the paraphrastic
alignments and subsequently have assigned generic categories to these insertions, such as [NP] for noun
phrase, [ADV] for adverb, [PRO-Poss] for possessive pronoun, and so on and so forth. In the derived
generic grammars, extracted alignments are generalized by replacing dependents words with constituent
variables such as NP and ADV, etc., or SAL categories. The reason for this, is that we want grammars to
apply independently of the word (noun, adverb, pronoun, etc.) inserted. So, for example, instead of the
proper name Hal, the grammar would still be able to transform the expression no matter which proper
name would appear as an insertion. In other cases, we have defined semantico-syntactic (SAL) categories
so that grammars apply to a certain group of words (See (Scott, 2003; Barreiro et al., 2011; Scott, 2018)
for a description of SAL). For example, the English expressions I’m wearing a suit and I’m in jeans and
leather jacket were found in the same sentence illustrated in example (7) in the e-PACT corpus with the
EP translations vou de fato and vou de jeans e blusão de cabedal, and with the BP translations estou
usando um terno and estou com jeans e jaqueta de couro. The use of the SAL category [N(CO-clothes)]
([COncrete noun + clothes that one can wear/dress]) for the noun suit and the coordinated nouns jeans
and leather jacket and their corresponding translations in both EP and BP allows the grammar to apply
the paraphrases with any noun or coordinated nouns that are classified with the same SAL category (e.g.,
pants, dress, sweatshirt, etc.).

(7) EN - I’m wearing a suit myself today [...], but sometimes, when I’m in jeans and leather jacket
EP - Hoje também vou de fato [...] mas, às vezes, quando vou de jeans e blusão de cabedal
BP - Hoje estou usando um terno [...], mas às vezes, estou com jeans e jaqueta de couro

Table 4: Examples of stylist variants = paraphrases both possible in EP and BP

paraphrastic alignment can provide a sort of contrastive dictionary function after validation. We have
illustrated a few cases of paraphrasing phenomena, but many more could be brought for reflection. Our
main goal was to show how short paraphrastic variants can contribute to the development of a paraphraser
that handles variety adaptation. This is a fertile research field that still needs to mature in order to bear
fruit to enrich technological applications for language learning, writing and editing, among others.

A first observation to be made concerns the validation of the words, multiwords, phrases, expressions,
structures and sentences of each variety that are taken into consideration in the paraphrastic alignments.
Some ways of expression may vary according to the translator, the translator’s experience or professional
performance and be less related to the variety itself. For example, the use of the word estúdio with the
meaning of office is questionable (context-specific knowledge is important). Normally, it refers only
to an artist’s work place, not a regular office. While the kind of corpora used may be a rich source of
paraphrases, not all paraphrases are reliable, and some of them are not indicative of language variance.

We have targeted several morpho-syntactic alignment problems that have not been consistently con-
sidered up to now, such as the alignment of articles together with the nouns with zero articles, a solution
for a significant number of gender and number agreement problems between an article, and a noun, or
the alignment of the preposition with a noun in noun adjunct cases. Due to the extent of the work at hand,
a large amount of paraphrastic phenomena was left undiscussed. A detailed analysis of these phenom-
ena is important for the improvement of alignment techniques and for the enhancement of the quality of
paraphrasing. One of the phenomenon that we are currently revisiting is the alignment of multiwords
when there are contracted forms involved (Barreiro and Batista, 2018). Another one is the alignment of
verbal constructions involving clitic pronouns (Rebelo and Barreiro, 2018 forthcoming). As we move
along the development process of a manually aligned dataset and definition of a typology of linguistic
phenomena, we wish to attempt an automated alignment tool.

Finally, it is worth noting that the computational tools available for alignment also present shortcom-
ings and limitations. The process of collecting paraphrastic alignments is a far-reaching work that is far
from complete. In future work, we envisage to create grammars from many of these contrasts that will
use semantico-syntactic knowledge and apply to a larger number of cases whenever that is possible.
