Abstract

Aspect based sentiment analysis (ABSA)
can provide more detailed information
than general sentiment analysis, because
it aims to predict the sentiment polarities
of the given aspects or entities in text.
We summarize previous approaches into
two subtasks: aspect-category sentiment
analysis (ACSA) and aspect-term senti-
ment analysis (ATSA). Most previous ap-
proaches employ long short-term mem-
ory and attention mechanisms to predict
the sentiment polarity of the concerned
targets, which are often complicated and
need more training time. We propose a
model based on convolutional neural net-
works and gating mechanisms, which is
more accurate and efficient. First, the
novel Gated Tanh-ReLU Units can selec-
tively output the sentiment features ac-
cording to the given aspect or entity. The
architecture is much simpler than attention
layer used in the existing models. Sec-
ond, the computations of our model could
be easily parallelized during training, be-
cause convolutional layers do not have
time dependency as in LSTM layers, and
gating units also work independently. The
experiments on SemEval datasets demon-
strate the efficiency and effectiveness of
our models. 1

1 Introduction

Opinion mining and sentiment analysis (Pang and
Lee, 2008) on user-generated reviews can pro-
vide valuable information for providers and con-
sumers. Instead of predicting the overall sen-

timent polarity, fine-grained aspect based senti-
ment analysis (ABSA) (Liu and Zhang, 2012) is
proposed to better understand reviews than tradi-
tional sentiment analysis. Specifically, we are in-
terested in the sentiment polarity of aspect cate-
gories or target entities in the text. Sometimes,
it is coupled with aspect term extractions (Xue
et al., 2017). A number of models have been
developed for ABSA, but there are two different
subtasks, namely aspect-category sentiment anal-
ysis (ACSA) and aspect-term sentiment analysis
(ATSA). The goal of ACSA is to predict the sen-
timent polarity with regard to the given aspect,
which is one of a few predefined categories. On
the other hand, the goal of ATSA is to identify
the sentiment polarity concerning the target enti-
ties that appear in the text instead, which could be
a multi-word phrase or a single word. The num-
ber of distinct words contributing to aspect terms
could be more than a thousand. For example, in
the sentence “Average to good Thai food, but terri-
ble delivery.”, ATSA would ask the sentiment po-
larity towards the entity Thai food; while ACSA
would ask the sentiment polarity toward the aspect
service, even though the word service does not ap-
pear in the sentence.

Many existing models use LSTM lay-
ers (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) to
distill sentiment information from embedding
vectors, and apply attention mechanisms (Bah-
danau et al., 2014) to enforce models to focus on
the text spans related to the given aspect/entity.
Such models include Attention-based LSTM
with Aspect Embedding (ATAE-LSTM) (Wang
et al., 2016b) for ACSA; Target-Dependent
Sentiment Classification (TD-LSTM) (Tang et al.,
2016a), Gated Neural Networks (Zhang et al.,
2016) and Recurrent Attention Memory Network
(RAM) (Chen et al., 2017) for ATSA. Attention
mechanisms has been successfully used in many

NLP tasks. It first computes the alignment scores
between context vectors and target vector; then
carry out a weighted sum with the scores and the
context vectors. However, the context vectors
have to encode both the aspect and sentiment
information, and the alignment scores are applied
across all feature dimensions regardless of the dif-
ferences between these two types of information.
Both LSTM and attention layer are very time-
consuming during training. LSTM processes one
token in a step. Attention layer involves exponen-
tial operation and normalization of all alignment
scores of all the words in the sentence (Wang
et al., 2016b). Moreover, some models needs the
positional information between words and targets
to produce weighted LSTM (Chen et al., 2017),
which can be unreliable in noisy review text.
Certainly, it is possible to achieve higher accuracy
by building more and more complicated LSTM
cells and sophisticated attention mechanisms; but
one has to hold more parameters in memory, get
more hyper-parameters to tune and spend more
time in training. In this paper, we propose a fast
and effective neural network for ACSA and ATSA
based on convolutions and gating mechanisms,
which has much less training time than LSTM
based networks, but with better accuracy.

For ACSA task, our model has two separate
convolutional layers on the top of the embedding
layer, whose outputs are combined by novel gat-
ing units. Convolutional layers with multiple fil-
ters can efficiently extract n-gram features at many
granularities on each receptive field. The pro-
posed gating units have two nonlinear gates, each
of which is connected to one convolutional layer.
With the given aspect information, they can selec-
tively extract aspect-specific sentiment informa-
tion for sentiment prediction. For example, in the
sentence “Average to good Thai food, but terrible
delivery.”, when the aspect food is provided, the
gating units automatically ignore the negative sen-
timent of aspect delivery from the second clause,
and only output the positive sentiment from the
first clause. Since each component of the proposed
model could be easily parallelized, it has much
less training time than the models based on LSTM
and attention mechanisms. For ATSA task, where
the aspect terms consist of multiple words, we ex-
tend our model to include another convolutional
layer for the target expressions. We evaluate our
models on the SemEval datasets, which contains

restaurants and laptops reviews with labels on as-
pect level. To the best of our knowledge, no CNN-
based model has been proposed for aspect based
sentiment analysis so far.

2 Related Work

We present the relevant studies into following two
categories.

2.1 Neural Networks

Recently, neural networks have gained much pop-
ularity on sentiment analysis or sentence classifi-
cation task. Tree-based recursive neural networks
such as Recursive Neural Tensor Network (Socher
et al., 2013) and Tree-LSTM (Tai et al., 2015),
make use of syntactic interpretation of the sen-
tence structure, but these methods suffer from
time inefficiency and parsing errors on review
text. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) such as
LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) and
GRU (Chung et al., 2014) have been used for sen-
timent analysis on data instances having variable
length (Tang et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2016; Lai
et al., 2015). There are also many models that use
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) (Collobert
et al., 2011; Kalchbrenner et al., 2014; Kim, 2014;
Conneau et al., 2016) in NLP, which also prove
that convolution operations can capture composi-
tional structure of texts with rich semantic infor-
mation without laborious feature engineering.

2.2 Aspect based Sentiment Analysis

There is abundant research work on aspect based
sentiment analysis. Actually, the name ABSA is
used to describe two different subtasks in the lit-
erature. We classify the existing work into two
main categories based on the descriptions of senti-
ment analysis tasks in SemEval 2014 Task 4 (Pon-
tiki et al., 2014): Aspect-Term Sentiment Analysis
and Aspect-Category Sentiment Analysis.

Aspect-Term Sentiment Analysis. In the first
category, sentiment analysis is performed toward
the aspect terms that are labeled in the given sen-
tence. A large body of literature tries to utilize the
relation or position between the target words and
the surrounding context words either by using the
tree structure of dependency or by simply counting
the number of words between them as a relevance
information (Chen et al., 2017).

Recursive neural networks (Lakkaraju et al.,
2014; Dong et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2016a) rely



2516

on external syntactic parsers, which can be very
inaccurate and slow on noisy texts like tweets and
reviews, which may result in inferior performance.

Recurrent neural networks are commonly used
in many NLP tasks as well as in ABSA prob-
lem. TD-LSTM (Tang et al., 2016a) and gated
neural networks (Zhang et al., 2016) use two or
three LSTM networks to model the left and right
contexts of the given target individually. A fully-
connected layer with gating units predicts the sen-
timent polarity with the outputs of LSTM layers.

Memory network (Weston et al., 2014) coupled
with multiple-hop attention attempts to explicitly
focus only on the most informative context area
to infer the sentiment polarity towards the tar-
get word (Tang et al., 2016b; Chen et al., 2017).
Nonetheless, memory network simply bases its
knowledge bank on the embedding vectors of in-
dividual words (Tang et al., 2016b), which makes
itself hard to learn the opinion word enclosed
in more complicated contexts. The performance
is improved by using LSTM, attention layer and
feature engineering with word distance between
surrounding words and target words to produce
target-specific memory (Chen et al., 2017).

Aspect-Category Sentiment Analysis. In this
category, the model is asked to predict the sen-
timent polarity toward a predefined aspect cate-
gory. Attention-based LSTM with Aspect Embed-
ding (Wang et al., 2016b) uses the embedding vec-
tors of aspect words to selectively attend the re-
gions of the representations generated by LSTMs.

3 Gated Convolutional Network with
Aspect Embedding

In this section, we present a new model for ACSA
and ATSA, namely Gated Convolutional network
with Aspect Embedding (GCAE), which is more
efficient and simpler than recurrent network based
models (Wang et al., 2016b; Tang et al., 2016a;
Ma et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2017). Recurrent neu-
ral networks sequentially compose hidden vectors
hi = f(hi−1), which does not enable paralleliza-
tion over inputs. In the attention layer, softmax
normalization also has to wait for all the alignment
scores computed by a similarity function. Hence,
they cannot take advantage of highly-parallelized
modern hardware and libraries. Our model is built
on convolutional layers and gating units. Each
convolutional filter computes n-gram features at
different granularities from the embedding vectors

at each position individually. The gating units on
top of the convolutional layers at each position
are also independent from each other. Therefore,
our model is more suitable to parallel computing.
Moreover, our model is equipped with two kinds
of effective filtering mechanisms: the gating units
on top of the convolutional layers and the max
pooling layer, both of which can accurately gen-
erate and select aspect-related sentiment features.

We first briefly review the vanilla CNN for text
classification (Kim, 2014). The model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on many standard
sentiment classification datasets (Le et al., 2017).

The CNN model consists of an embedding
layer, a one-dimension convolutional layer and a
max-pooling layer. The embedding layer takes the
indices wi ∈ {1, 2, . . . , V } of the input words
and outputs the corresponding embedding vec-
tors vi ∈ RD. D denotes the dimension size
of the embedding vectors. V is the size of the
word vocabulary. The embedding layer is usu-
ally initialized with pre-trained embeddings such
as GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014), then they are
fine-tuned during the training stage. The one-
dimension convolutional layer convolves the in-
puts with multiple convolutional kernels of differ-
ent widths. Each kernel corresponds a linguistic
feature detector which extracts a specific pattern
of n-gram at various granularities (Kalchbrenner
et al., 2014). Specifically, the input sentence is
represented by a matrix through the embedding
layer, X = [v1,v2, . . . ,vL], where L is the length
of the sentence with padding. A convolutional fil-
ter Wc ∈ RD×k maps k words in the receptive
field to a single feature c. As we slide the filter
across the whole sentence, we obtain a sequence
of new features c = [c1, c2, . . . , cL].

ci = f(Xi:i+K ∗Wc + bc) , (1)

where bc ∈ R is the bias, f is a non-linear acti-
vation function such as tanh function, ∗ denotes
convolution operation. If there are nk filters of
the same width k, the output features form a ma-
trix C ∈ Rnk×Lk . For each convolutional filter,
the max-over-time pooling layer takes the maxi-
mal value among the generated convolutional fea-
tures, resulting in a fixed-size vector whose size is
equal to the number of filters nk. Finally, a soft-
max layer uses the vector to predict the sentiment
polarity of the input sentence.

Figure 1: Illustration of our model GCAE for
ACSA task. A pair of convolutional neuron com-
putes features for a pair of gates: tanh gate and
ReLU gate. The ReLU gate receives the given
aspect information to control the propagation of
sentiment features. The outputs of two gates are
element-wisely multiplied for the max pooling
layer.

Gated Tanh-ReLU Units (GTRU) with aspect em-
bedding are connected to two convolutional neu-
rons at each position t. Specifically, we compute
the features ci as

ai = relu(Xi:i+k ∗Wa +Vava + ba) (2)
si = tanh(Xi:i+k ∗Ws + bs) (3)
ci = si × ai , (4)

where va is the embedding vector of the given as-
pect category in ACSA or computed by another
CNN over aspect terms in ATSA. The two convo-
lutions in Equation 2 and 3 are the same as the
convolution in the vanilla CNN, but the convo-
lutional features ai receives additional aspect in-
formation va with ReLU activation function. In
other words, si and ai are responsible for generat-
ing sentiment features and aspect features respec-
tively. The above max-over-time pooling layer
generates a fixed-size vector e ∈ Rdk , which
keeps the most salient sentiment features of the
whole sentence. The final fully-connected layer
with softmax function uses the vector e to pre-
dict the sentiment polarity ŷ. The model is trained
by minimizing the cross-entropy loss between the
ground-truth y and the predicted value ŷ for all
data samples.

4 Gating Mechanisms

The proposed Gated Tanh-ReLU Units control
the path through which the sentiment information
flows towards the pooling layer. The gating mech-
anisms have proven to be effective in LSTM. In as-
pect based sentiment analysis, it is very common
that different aspects with different sentiments ap-
pear in one sentence. The ReLU gate in Equation 2
does not have upper bound on positive inputs but
strictly zero on negative inputs. Therefore, it can
output a similarity score according to the relevance
between the given aspect information va and the
aspect feature ai at position t. If this score is zero,
the sentiment features si would be blocked at the
gate; otherwise, its magnitude would be amplified
accordingly. The max-over-time pooling further
removes the sentiment features which are not sig-
nificant over the whole sentence.

In language modeling (Dauphin et al., 2017;
Kalchbrenner et al., 2016; van den Oord et al.,
2016; Gehring et al., 2017), Gated Tanh Units
(GTU) and Gated Linear Units (GLU) have shown
effectiveness of gating mechanisms. GTU is rep-
resented by tanh(X ∗W+ b)× σ(X ∗V+ c), in
which the sigmoid gates control features for pre-
dicting the next word in a stacked convolutional
block. To overcome the gradient vanishing prob-
lem of GTU, GLU uses (X∗W+b)×σ(X∗V+c)
instead, so that the gradients would not be down-
scaled to propagate through many stacked convo-
lutional layers. However, a neural network that
has only one convolutional layer would not suf-
fer from gradient vanish problem during training.
We show that on text classification problem, our
GTRU is more effective than these two gating
units.

5 GCAE on ATSA

ATSA task is defined to predict the sentiment po-
larity of the aspect terms in the given sentence.
We simply extend GCAE by adding a small con-
volutional layer on aspect terms, as shown in Fig-
ure 2. In ACSA, the aspect information controlling
the flow of sentiment features in GTRU is from
one aspect word; while in ATSA, such informa-
tion is provided by a small CNN on aspect terms
[wi, wi+1, . . . , wi+k]. The additional CNN ex-
tracts the important features from multiple words

6 Experiments

6.1 Datasets and Experiment Preparation
We conduct experiments on public datasets from
SemEval workshops (Pontiki et al., 2014), which
consist of customer reviews about restaurants and
laptops. Some existing work (Wang et al., 2016b;
Ma et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2017) removed “con-
flict” labels from four sentiment labels, which
makes their results incomparable to those from the
workshop report (Kiritchenko et al., 2014). We
reimplemented the compared methods, and used
hyper-parameter settings described in these refer-
ences.

The sentences which have different sentiment
labels for different aspects or targets in the sen-
tence are more common in review data than in
standard sentiment classification benchmark. The
sentence in Table 1 shows the reviewer’s different
attitude towards two aspects: food and delivery.
Therefore, to access how the models perform on
review sentences more accurately, we create small
but difficult datasets, which are made up of the
sentences having opposite or different sentiments
on different aspects/targets. In Table 1, the two
identical sentences but with different sentiment la-
bels are both included in the dataset. If a sentence
has 4 aspect targets, this sentence would have 4
copies in the data set, each of which is associated
with different target and sentiment label.

For ACSA task, we conduct experiments on

restaurant review data of SemEval 2014 Task 4.
There are 5 aspects: food, price, service, ambi-
ence, and misc; 4 sentiment polarities: positive,
negative, neutral, and conflict. By merging restau-
rant reviews of three years 2014 - 2016, we obtain
a larger dataset called “Restaurant-Large”. Incom-
patibilities of data are fixed during merging. We
replace conflict labels with neutral labels in the
2014 dataset. In the 2015 and 2016 datasets, there
could be multiple pairs of “aspect terms” and “as-
pect category” in one sentence. For each sentence,
let p denote the number of positive labels minus
the number of negative labels. We assign a sen-
tence a positive label if p > 0, a negative label if
p < 0, or a neutral label if p = 0. After removing
duplicates, the statistics are show in Table 2. The
resulting dataset has 8 aspects: restaurant, food,
drinks, ambience, service, price, misc and loca-
tion.

For ATSA task, we use restaurant reviews and
laptop reviews from SemEval 2014 Task 4. On
each dataset, we duplicate each sentence na times,
which is equal to the number of associated aspect
categories (ACSA) or aspect terms (ATSA) (Ruder
et al., 2016b,a). The statistics of the datasets are
shown in Table 2.

The sizes of hard data sets are also shown in Ta-
ble 2. The test set is designed to measure whether
a model can detect multiple different sentiment
polarities in one sentence toward different enti-
ties. Without such sentences, a classifier for over-
all sentiment classification might be good enough

for the sentences associated with only one senti-
ment label.

In our experiments, word embedding vectors
are initialized with 300-dimension GloVe vectors
which are pre-trained on unlabeled data of 840 bil-
lion tokens (Pennington et al., 2014). Words out of
the vocabulary of GloVe are randomly initialized
with a uniform distribution U(−0.25, 0.25). We
use Adagrad (Duchi et al., 2011) with a batch size
of 32 instances, default learning rate of 1e−2, and
maximal epochs of 30. We only fine tune early
stopping with 5-fold cross validation on training
datasets. All neural models are implemented in
PyTorch.

6.2 Compared Methods

To comprehensively evaluate the performance of
GCAE, we compare our model against the follow-
ing models.

NRC-Canada (Kiritchenko et al., 2014) is the
top method in SemEval 2014 Task 4 for ACSA and
ATSA task. SVM is trained with extensive fea-
ture engineering: various types of n-grams, POS
tags, and lexicon features. The sentiment lexicons
improve the performance significantly, but it re-
quires large scale labeled data: 183 thousand Yelp
reviews, 124 thousand Amazon laptop reviews, 56
million tweets, and 3 sentiment lexicons labeled
manually.

CNN (Kim, 2014) is widely used on text clas-
sification task. It cannot directly capture aspect-
specific sentiment information on ACSA task, but
it provides a very strong baseline for sentiment
classification. We set the widths of filters to 3, 4,
5 with 100 features each.

TD-LSTM (Tang et al., 2016a) uses two LSTM
networks to model the preceding and following
contexts of the target to generate target-dependent
representation for sentiment prediction.

ATAE-LSTM (Wang et al., 2016b) is an
attention-based LSTM for ACSA task. It appends
the given aspect embedding with each word em-
bedding as the input of LSTM, and has an atten-
tion layer above the LSTM layer.

IAN (Ma et al., 2017) stands for interactive

attention network for ATSA task, which is also
based on LSTM and attention mechanisms.

RAM (Chen et al., 2017) is a recurrent atten-
tion network for ATSA task, which uses LSTM
and multiple attention mechanisms.

GCN stands for gated convolutional neural net-
work, in which GTRU does not have the aspect
embedding as an additional input.

6.3 Results and Analysis

6.3.1 ACSA
Following the SemEval workshop, we report the
overall accuracy of all competing models over the
test datasets of restaurant reviews as well as the
hard test datasets. Every experiment is repeated
five times. The mean and the standard deviation
are reported in Table 4.

LSTM based model ATAE-LSTM has the worst
performance of all neural networks. Aspect-based
sentiment analysis is to extract the sentiment in-
formation closely related to the given aspect. It is
important to separate aspect information and sen-
timent information from the extracted information
of sentences. The context vectors generated by
LSTM have to convey the two kinds of informa-
tion at the same time. Moreover, the attention
scores generated by the similarity scoring function
are for the entire context vector.

GCAE improves the performance by 1.1% to
2.5% compared with ATAE-LSTM. First, our
model incorporates GTRU to control the sentiment
information flow according to the given aspect in-
formation at each dimension of the context vec-
tors. The element-wise gating mechanism works
at fine granularity instead of exerting an alignment
score to all the dimensions of the context vectors
in the attention layer of other models. Second,
GCAE does not generate a single context vector,
but two vectors for aspect and sentiment features
respectively, so that aspect and sentiment informa-
tion is unraveled. By comparing the performance
on the hard test datasets against CNN, it is easy
to see the convolutional layer of GCAE is able to
differentiate the sentiments of multiple entities.

are not designed for aspect based sentiment anal-
ysis, but their performance exceeds that of ATAE-
LSTM.

The performance of SVM (Kiritchenko et al.,
2014) depends on the availability of the features
it can use. Without the large amount of sentiment
lexicons, SVM perform worse than neural meth-
ods. With multiple sentiment lexicons, the perfor-
mance is increased by 7.6%. This inspires us to
work on leveraging sentiment lexicons in neural
networks in the future.

The hard test datasets consist of replicated sen-
tences with different sentiments towards differ-
ent aspects. The models which cannot utilize
the given aspect information such as CNN and
GCN perform poorly as expected, but GCAE has
higher accuracy than other neural network mod-
els. GCAE achieves 4% higher accuracy than
ATAE-LSTM on Restaurant-Large and 5% higher
on SemEval-2014 on ACSA task. However, GCN,
which does not have aspect modeling part, has
higher score than GCAE on the original restaurant
dataset. It suggests that GCN performs better than
GCAE when there is only one sentiment label in
the given sentence, but not on the hard test dataset.

6.3.2 ATSA

We apply the extended version of GCAE on ATSA
task. On this task, the aspect terms are marked
in the sentences and usually consist of multi-
ple words. We compare IAN (Ma et al., 2017),
RAM (Chen et al., 2017), TD-LSTM (Tang et al.,
2016a), ATAE-LSTM (Wang et al., 2016b), and

our GCAE model in Table 5. The models other
than GCAE is based on LSTM and attention
mechanisms. IAN has better performance than
TD-LSTM and ATAE-LSTM, because two atten-
tion layers guides the representation learning of
the context and the entity interactively. RAM also
achieves good accuracy by combining multiple at-
tentions with a recurrent neural network, but it
needs more training time as shown in the follow-
ing section. On the hard test dataset, GCAE has
1% higher accuracy than RAM on restaurant data
and 1.7% higher on laptop data. GCAE uses the
outputs of the small CNN over aspect terms to
guide the composition of the sentiment features
through the ReLU gate. Because of the gating
mechanisms and the convolutional layer over as-
pect terms, GCAE outperforms other neural mod-
els and basic SVM. Again, large scale sentiment
lexicons bring significant improvement to SVM.

6.4 Training Time

We record the training time of all models un-
til convergence on a validation set on a desktop
machine with a 1080 Ti GPU, as shown in Ta-
ble 6. LSTM based models take more training
time than convolutional models. On ATSA task,
because of multiple attention layers in IAN and
RAM, they need even more time to finish the
training. GCAE is much faster than other neural
models, because neither convolutional operation
nor GTRU has time dependency compared with
LSTM and attention layer. Therefore, it is easier
for hardware and libraries to parallel the comput-

trieved from the original paper, we are not able to
compare the training time of SVM.

6.5 Gating Mechanisms
In this section, we compare GLU (X ∗W + b)×
σ(X ∗Wa +Vva + ba) (Dauphin et al., 2017),

(van den Oord et al., 2016), and GTRU used in
GCAE. Table 7 shows that all of three gating
units achieve relatively high accuracy on restau-
rant datasets. GTRU outperforms the other gates.
It has a convolutional layer generating aspect fea-
tures via ReLU activation function, which controls
the magnitude of the sentiment signals according
to the given aspect information. On the other hand,
the sigmoid function in GTU and GLU has the up-
per bound +1, which may not be able to distill
sentiment features effectively.

7 Visualization

In this section, we take a concrete review sen-
tence as an example to illustrate how the proposed
gate GTRU works. It is more difficult to visualize

the weights generated by the gates than the atten-
tion weights in other neural networks. The atten-
tion weight score is a global score over the words
and the vector dimensions; whereas in our model,
there are Nword ×Nfilter ×Ndimension gate outputs.
Therefore, we train a small model with only one
filter which is only three word wide. Then, for
each word, we sum the Ndimension outputs of the
ReLU gates. After normalization, we plot the val-
ues on each word in Figure 3. Given different
aspect targets, the ReLU gates would control the
magnitude of the outputs of the tanh gates.

8 Conclusions and Future Work

In this paper, we proposed an efficient convolu-
tional neural network with gating mechanisms for
ACSA and ATSA tasks. GTRU can effectively
control the sentiment flow according to the given
aspect information, and two convolutional layers
model the aspect and sentiment information sep-
arately. We prove the performance improvement
compared with other neural models by extensive
experiments on SemEval datasets. How to lever-
age large-scale sentiment lexicons in neural net-
works would be our future work.
