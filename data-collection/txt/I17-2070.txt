Abstract

We describe a data-driven approach for au-
tomatically explaining new, non-standard
English expressions in a given sentence,
building on a large dataset that includes
15 years of crowdsourced examples from
UrbanDictionary.com. Unlike prior stud-
ies that focus on matching keywords from
a slang dictionary, we investigate the pos-
sibility of learning a neural sequence-to-
sequence model that generates explana-
tions of unseen non-standard English ex-
pressions given context. We propose a
dual encoder approach—a word-level en-
coder learns the representation of context,
and a second character-level encoder to
learn the hidden representation of the tar-
get non-standard expression. Our model
can produce reasonable definitions of new
non-standard English expressions given
their context with certain confidence.

1 Introduction

In the past two decades, the majority of NLP re-
search focused on developing tools for the Stan-
dard English on newswire data. However, the non-
standard part of the language is not well-studied
in the community, even though it becomes more
and more important in the era of social media.
While we agree that one must take a cautious ap-
proach to automatic generation of non-standard
language (Hickman, 2013), but for many practical
purposes, it is also of crucial importance for ma-
chines to be able to understand and explain this
important subversion of the language.

In the NLP community, using dictionaries of
non-standard language as an external knowledge
source is useful for many tasks. For example, Bur-
foot and Baldwin (2009) consult the slang defini-

cally explaining any newly emerged, non-standard
expressions (generating the blue box).

tions from Wiktionary to detect satirical news ar-
ticles. Wang and McKeown (2010) show that us-
ing a slang dictionary of 5K terms can help detect-
ing vandalism of Wikipedia edits. Han and Bald-
win (2011) make use of the same slang dictionary,
and achieve the best performance by combining
the dictionary lookup approach with word simi-
larity and context for Twitter and SMS text nor-
malization. However, using a 5K slang dictionary
may suffer from the coverage issue, since slang
is evolving rapidly in the social media age1. Re-
cently, Thanapon Noraset (2016) shows that it is
possible to use word embeddings to generate plau-
sible definitions. Nonetheless, one weakness is
that definition of a word may change within dif-
ferent contexts.

In contrast, we take a more radical approach:
we aim at building a general purpose sequence-to-
sequence neural network model (Sutskever et al.,
2014) to explain any non-standard English expres-
sion, which can be used in many NLP and social
media applications. More specifically, given a sen-
tence that includes a non-standard English expres-
sion, we aim at automatically generating the trans-
lation of the target expression. Previously, this
is not possible because the resources of labeled

non-standard expressions are not available. In this
paper, we collect a large corpus of 15 years of
crowdsourced examples, and formulate the task as
a sequence-to-sequence generation problem. Us-
ing a word-level model, we show that it is pos-
sible to build a general purpose non-standard En-
glish words and phrases explainer using neural se-
quence learning techniques. To summarize our
contributions:

• We present a large, publicly available corpus
of non-standard English words and phrases,
including 15 years of definitions and exam-
ples for each entry via crowdsourcing;

• We present a hybrid word-character
sequence-to-sequence model that directly
explains unseen non-standard expressions
from social media;

• Our novel dual encoder LSTM model outper-
forms a standard attentive LSTM baseline,
and it is capable of generative plausible ex-
planation for unseen non-standard words and
phrases.

In the next section, we outline related work on
non-standard expressions and social media text
processing. We will then introduce our dual en-
coder based attentive sequence-to-sequence model
for explaining non-standard expressions in Sec-
tion 3. Experimental results are shown in Sec-
tion 4. And finally, we conclude in Section 5.

2 Related Work

The study of non-standard language is of inter-
ests to many researchers in the social media and
NLP communities. For example, Eisenstein et
al. (2010) propose a latent variable model to study
the lexical variation of the language on Twitter,
where many regional slang words are discovered.
Zappavigna (2012) identifies the Internet slang as
an important component in the discourse of Twit-
ter and social media. Gouws et al. (2011) provide
a contextual analysis of how social media users
shorten their messages. Notably, a study on Tweet
normalization (Han and Baldwin, 2011) finds that,
even when using a small slang dictionary of 5K
words, Slang makes up 12% of the ill-formed
words in a Twitter corpus of 449 posts. In the
NLP community, slang dictionary is widely used
in many tasks and applications (Burfoot and Bald-
win, 2009; Wang and McKeown, 2010; Rosenthal

and McKeown, 2011). However, we argue that us-
ing a small, fixed-size dictionary approach may
be suboptimal: it suffers from the low coverage
problem, and to keep the dictionary up to date,
maintaining such dictionary is also expensive and
time-consuming. To the best of our knowledge,
our work is the first to build a general purpose ma-
chine learning model for explaining non-standard
English terms, using a large crowdsourced dataset.

3 Our Approach

3.1 Sequence-to-Sequence Model
Since our goal is to automatically generate expla-
nations for any non-standard English expressions,
we select sequence-to-sequence models with at-
tention mechanisms as our fundamental frame-
work (Bahdanau et al., 2014), which can pro-
duce abstractive explanations, and assign different
weights to different parts of a sentence. To model
both the context words and the non-standard ex-
pression, we propose a hybrid word-character dual
encoder. An overview of our model is shown in
Figure 2.

3.2 Context Encoder
Our context encoder is basically a recurrent
neural network with long-short term memory
(LSTM) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997).
LSTM consists of input gates, forget gates and
output gates, together with hidden units as its in-
ternal memory. Here, i controls the impact of new
input, while f is a forget gate, and o is an output
gate. C̃t is the candidate new value. h is the hidden
state, and m is the cell memory state. “�” means
element-wise vector product. The definition of the
gates, memory, and hidden state is:

it = σ(Wi[xt, ht−1])

ft = σ(Wf [xt, ht−1])

ot = σ(Wo[xt, ht−1])

C̃t = tanh(Wc[xt, ht−1])

mt = mt−1 � ft + it � C̃t
ht = mt � ot

At each step, RNN is given a vector as input,
changes its hidden states and produces outputs
from its last layer. Hidden states and outputs are
stored and later passed to a decoder, which pro-
duces final outputs based on hidden states, outputs,

and the decoder’s own parameters.The context en-
coder learns and encodes sentence-level informa-
tion for the decoder to generate explanations.

3.3 Attention Mechanism
The idea of designing an attention mechanism is
to select key focuses in the sentence. More specif-
ically, we would like to pay attention to specific
parts of encoder outputs and states. We follow a
recent study (Vinyals et al., 2015) to setup an at-
tention mechanism. We have a separate LSTM for
decoding.

Here we briefly explain the method. When the
decoder starts its decoding process, it has all hid-
den units from the encoder, denoted as (h1..hT1).
Also we denote the hidden state of the decoder
as (d1..dT2). T1 and T2 are input and output
lengths. At each time step, the model computes
new weighted hidden states based on encoder
states and three learnable components: v, W ′1 and
W ′2.

ati = softmax(u

i=1

atihi

Here a denotes the attention weights. ut has length
T1. After the model computes d′t, it concatenates
d′t and dt as new hidden states used for prediction
and next update.

3.4 Dual Encoder Structure
Given a single context encoder, it is challenging
for any decoder to generate explanation in the in-
stance. The reason is that there could be multi-
ple non-standard expressions in the sentence, and

it confuses the decoder on which one it should ex-
plain. In practice, the user can often pin point to
the exact expression she or he does not know, so in
this work, we design a second encoder to learn the
representation of the target non-standard expres-
sion.

Since our goal is to explain any non-standard
English words and phrases, we consider a
character-level encoder for this purpose. This sec-
ond encoder reads the embedding vector of each
character at each time step, and produces an out-
put vector, and hidden states. Our dual encoder
model linearly combines the hidden states of the
character-level target expression encoder with the
hidden states of the word-level encoder with the
following equation:

hnew = h1W1 + h2W2 +B

Here, h1 is the context representation, and h2 is
the target expression representation. The Bias
B and the combination weights W1 and W2 are
learnable.

4 Experiment

4.1 Dataset
We collect the non-standard English corpus2 from
Urban Dictionary (UD)3—the largest online slang
dictionary, where terms, definitions and examples
are submitted by the crowd. UD is made a reliable
resource, due to the quality control of its publish-
ing procedure. To prevent vandalism, a user must
have a Facebook or Gmail account, and when each
user submits an entry, the UD editors will vote
“Publish” or “Don’t Publish” (Lloyd, 2011). Each
editor is also distinguished by IP addresses, and
HTTP cookies are used to prevent each editor from
cheating. In recent years, United States Federal
government has consulted UD for the definition of
“murk” in a threat case (Jackson, 2011), whereas
UD is also referred in a financial restitution case in
Wisconsin (Kaufman, 2013), as well as determin-
ing appropriate license plates in Las Vegas (Davis,
2011).

A total of 421K entries (words and phrases)
from the period of 1999-2014 are collected. Each
entry includes a list of candidate definitions and
examples, as well as the surface form of the target

term. Using the UD API, we can pinpoint the to-
ken positions of the words/phrases, and obtain the
ground truth labels for tagging.

Our training and testing data use all the exam-
ples in an entry (a non-standard expression). We
randomly select 371,028 entries for training, re-
sulting in 907,624 sequence pairs of instance and
reference explanation. The test set includes 50,000
entries, and 61,330 sentences. Note that all testing
target non-standard expressions, instances and ex-
amples do not overlap with those in the training
dataset.

4.2 Experimental Settings

Our implementation is based on Tensorflow4. For
input embeddings, we randomly initialize the
word vectors. We use stochastic gradient descent
with adaptive learning rate to optimize the cross
entropy function. We use BLEU scores (Papineni
et al., 2002) for the evaluation.

4.3 Quantitative and Qualitative Results

Quantitative experimental results are showed in
Table 1. Here we compare the performance of
our proposed large dual encoder model to a single

context encoder, word-level attentive sequence-to-
sequence, as well as a full character-level context
encoder model. We use 256 hidden units for this
full character-level, because it is the largest setting
that fits our Titan X Pascale GPU. Character-level
model has longer sequence, which becomes one of
its shortages compared with word-level model.

We see that the single encoder and full character
level context models do not offer the best empiri-
cal performances on this dataset. Our novel dual
encoder method, which combines the strengths
of word-level and character-level sequence-to-
sequence models, obtained the best performance.

For qualitative analysis, we provide some gen-
erated explanations in Figure 3. For example, the
first target non-standard expression is the word
“loltastic”, which is a combination of the words
“lol” and “fantastic”. To explain this composite
non-standard expression, a character-level encoder
is needed. The generated explanation from our
dual encoder approach clearly makes more sense
than the single decoder result.

Overall, dual encoder can explain words with
more confidence partly because it knows which
words it needs to explain, especially for sentences
containing multiple non-standard English words
and phrases. Our model can also accurately ex-
plain many known acronyms. We also notice
that LSTM cells outperform gated recurrent units
(GRUs) (Cho et al., 2014), and attention mecha-
nism improves the performance.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we introduce a new task of learning
to explain newly emerged, non-standard English
words and phrases. To do this, we collected 15-
year of UrbanDictionary data, and designed a dual
encoder attentive sequence-to-sequence model to
learn the hidden context representation and the
hidden non-standard expression embedding. We
showed that combining word-level and character-
level models improved the performance for this
task
