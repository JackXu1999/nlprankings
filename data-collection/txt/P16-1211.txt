Abstract

The canonical word order of Japanese
double object constructions has attracted
considerable attention among linguists and
has been a topic of many studies. How-
ever, most of these studies require either
manual analyses or measurements of hu-
man characteristics such as brain activities
or reading times for each example. Thus,
while these analyses are reliable for the ex-
amples they focus on, they cannot be gen-
eralized to other examples. On the other
hand, the trend of actual usage can be col-
lected automatically from a large corpus.
Thus, in this paper, we assume that there is
a relationship between the canonical word
order and the proportion of each word or-
der in a large corpus and present a corpus-
based analysis of canonical word order of
Japanese double object constructions.

1 Introduction

Japanese has a much freer word order than En-
glish. For example, a Japanese double object con-
struction has six possible word orders as follows:

(1) a: Ken-ga Aya-ni camera-wo miseta.
Ken-NOM Aya-DAT camera-ACC showed

b: Ken-ga camera-wo Aya-ni miseta.
Ken-NOM camera-ACC Aya-DAT showed

c: Aya-ni Ken-ga camera-wo miseta.
Aya-DAT Ken-NOM camera-ACC showed

d: Aya-ni camera-wo Ken-ga miseta.
Aya-DAT camera-ACC Ken-NOM showed

e: Camera-wo Ken-ga Aya-ni miseta.
camera-ACC Ken-NOM Aya-DAT showed

f: Camera-wo Aya-ni Ken-ga miseta.
camera-ACC Aya-DAT Ken-NOM showed

In these examples, the position of the verb miseta
(showed) is fixed but the positions of its nomina-
tive (NOM), dative (DAT), and accusative (ACC) ar-
guments are scrambled. Note that, although the
word orders are different, they have essentially the
same meaning “Ken showed a camera to Aya.”

In the field of linguistics, each language is as-
sumed to have a basic word order that is funda-
mental to its sentence structure and in most cases
there is a generally accepted theory on the word
order for each structure. That is, even if there are
several possible word orders for essentially same
sentences consisting of the same elements, only
one of them is regarded as the canonical word
order and the others are considered to be gener-
ated by scrambling it. However, in the case of
Japanese double object constructions, there are
several claims on the canonical argument order.

There have been a number of studies on the
canonical word order of Japanese double ob-
ject constructions ranging from theoretical stud-
ies (Hoji, 1985; Miyagawa and Tsujioka, 2004)
to empirical ones based on psychological exper-
iments (Koizumi and Tamaoka, 2004; Nakamoto
et al., 2006; Shigenaga, 2014) and brain science
(Koso et al., 2004; Inubushi et al., 2009). How-
ever, most of them required either manual analyses
or measurements of human characteristics such as
brain activities or reading times for each example.
Thus, while these analyses are reliable for the ex-
ample they focus on, they cannot be easily gener-
alized to other examples1. That is, another manual
analysis or measurement is required to consider
the canonical word order of another example.

On the other hand, the trend of actual usage can
be collected from a large corpus. While it is dif-
ficult to say whether a word order is canonical or

1Note that in this work, we assume that there could be dif-
ferent canonical word orders for different double-object sen-
tences as will be explained in Section 2.2.

not from one specific example, we can consider
that a word order would be canonical if it is over-
whelmingly dominant in a large corpus. For exam-
ple, since the DAT-ACC order2 is overwhelmingly
dominant in the case that the verb is kanjiru (feel),
its dative argument is kotoba (word), and its ac-
cusative argument is aijô (affection) as shown in
Example (2), we can consider that the DAT-ACC
order would be canonical in this case. Note that,
the numbers in parentheses represent the propor-
tion of each word order in Examples (2) and (3);
φX denotes the omitted noun or pronoun X in this
paper.

(2) DAT-ACC: Kotoba-ni aijô-wo kanjiru.
(97.5%) word-DAT affection-ACC feel

ACC-DAT: Aijô-wo kotoba-ni kanjiru.
(2.5%) affection-ACC word-DAT feel

(φI feel the affection in φyour words.)

On the contrary, since the ACC-DAT order is
overwhelmingly dominant in the case that the verb
is sasou (ask), its dative argument is dêto (date),
and its accusative argument is josei (woman) as
shown in Example (3), the ACC-DAT order is con-
sidered to be canonical in this case.

(3) DAT-ACC: Dêto-ni josei-wo sasou.
(0.4%) date-DAT woman-ACC ask

ACC-DAT: Josei-wo dêto-ni sasou.
(99.6%) woman-ACC date-DAT ask

(φI ask a woman out on a date.)

Therefore, in this paper, we assume that there
is a relationship between the canonical word order
and the proportion of each word order in a large
corpus and attempt to evaluate several claims on
the canonical word order of Japanese double ob-
ject constructions on the basis of a large corpus.
Since we extract examples of double object con-
structions only from reliable parts of parses of a
very large corpus, consisting of more than 10 bil-
lion unique sentences, we can reliably leverage
a large amount of examples. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to analyze the
canonical word order of Japanese double object
constructions on the basis of such a large corpus.

2Since Japanese word order is basically subject-object-
verb (SOV) and thus the canonical position of nominative
argument is considered to be the first position, we simply
call the nominative, dative, accusative order as the DAT-ACC
order, and the nominative, accusative, dative order as the
ACC-DAT order in this paper.

2 Japanese double object constructions

2.1 Relevant Japanese grammar
We briefly describe the relevant Japanese gram-
mar. Japanese word order is basically subject-
object-verb (SOV) order, but the word order is of-
ten scrambled and does not mark syntactic rela-
tions. Instead, postpositional case particles func-
tion as case markers. For example, nominative,
dative, and accusative cases are represented by
case particles ga, ni, and wo, respectively.

In a double object construction, the subject,
indirect object, and direct object are typically
marked with the case particles ga (nominative),
ni (dative), and wo (accusative), respectively, as
shown in Example (4)-a.

(4) a: Watashi-ga kare-ni camera-wo miseta.
I-NOM him-DAT camera-ACC showed

b: Watashi-wa kare-ni camera-wo miseta.
I-TOP him-DAT camera-ACC showed

c: φI kare-ni camera-wo miseta.
φI -NOM him-DAT camera-ACC showed

(I showed him a camera.)

However, when an argument represents the
topic of the sentence (TOP), the topic marker wa is
used as a postpositional particle, and case particles
ga and wo do not appear explicitly. For example,
since watashi (I) in Example (4)-b represents the
topic of the sentence, the nominative case particle
ga is replaced by the topic marker wa.

Similarly, an argument modified by its predicate
does not accompany a postpositional case particle
that represents the syntactic relation between the
predicate and argument. For example, since cam-
era in Example (5) is modified by the predicate
miseta (showed), the accusative case particle wo
does not appear explicitly.

(5) Watashi-ga kare-ni miseta camera.
I-NOM him-DAT showed camera

(A camera that I showed him.)

In addition, arguments are often omitted in
Japanese when we can easily guess what the omit-
ted argument is or we do not suppose a specific
object. For example, the nominative argument
is omitted in Example (4)-c, since we can easily
guess the subject is the first person.

These characteristics make it difficult to auto-
matically extract examples of word orders in dou-
ble object construction from a corpus.

2.2 Canonical argument order

There are three major claims as to the canonical ar-
gument order of Japanese double object construc-
tions (Koizumi and Tamaoka, 2004).

One is the traditional analysis by Hoji (1985),
which argues that only the nominative, dative, ac-
cusative (DAT-ACC) order like in Example (1)-a
is canonical for all cases. The second claim, made
by Matsuoka (2003), argues that Japanese double
object constructions have two canonical word or-
ders, the DAT-ACC order and the ACC-DAT order,
depending on the verb types. The third claim, by
Miyagawa (1997), asserts that both the DAT-ACC
order and ACC-DAT order are canonical for all
cases.

Note that, the definition of the term canonical
word order varies from study to study. Some stud-
ies presume that there is only one canonical word
order for one construction (Hoji, 1985), while oth-
ers presume that a canonical word order can be
different for each verb or each tuple of a verb
and its arguments (Matsuoka, 2003). In addition,
some studies presume that there can be multiple
canonical word orders for one sentence (Miya-
gawa, 1997). In this paper, we basically adopt the
position that there is only one canonical word or-
der for one tuple of a verb and its arguments but
the canonical word orders can be different for dif-
ferent tuples of a verb and its arguments.

2.3 Other features related to word order

There are a number of known features that af-
fect word order. For example, it is often said
that long arguments tend to be placed far from the
verb, whereas short arguments tend to be placed
near the verb. The From-Old-to-New Principle
(Kuno, 2006) is also well known; it argues that the
unmarked word order of constituents is old, pre-
dictable information first; and new, unpredictable
information last. Note that these types of features
are not specific to argument orders in Japanese
double object constituents. For example, Bresnan
et al. (2007) reported the similar features were also
observed in the English dative alternation and use-
ful for predicting the dative alternation.

However, since we are interested in the canoni-
cal word order, we do not want to take these fea-
tures into account. In this work, we assume that
these features can be ignored by using a very large
corpus and analyzing the word order on the basis
of statistical information acquired from the corpus.

3 Claims on the canonical word order of
Japanese double object constructions

In this paper, we will address the following five
claims on the canonical word order of Japanese
double object constructions.

Claim A: The DAT-ACC order is canonical.

Claim B: There are two canonical word orders,
the DAT-ACC and the ACC-DAT order, de-
pending on the verb types.

Claim C: An argument whose grammatical case
is infrequently omitted with a given verb
tends to be placed near the verb.

Claim D: The canonical word order varies de-
pending on the semantic role and animacy of
the dative argument.

Claim E: An argument that frequently co-occurs
with the verb tends to be placed near the verb.

Claim A (Hoji, 1985) presumes that there is
only one canonical word order for Japanese double
object constructions regardless of the verb type.
On the other hand, Claims B and C argue that the
canonical word order varies depending on verb,
but they still do not take into account the lexical
information of the arguments. Thus, these claims
can be verified by investigating the distribution of
word orders for each verb.

With regard to Claim B, Matsuoka (2003) clas-
sified causative-inchoative alternating verbs into
two types: show-type and pass-type, and claimed
the DAT-ACC order is the canonical order for
show-type verbs, whereas the ACC-DAT order is
the canonical order for pass-type verbs. The def-
initions of each verb type are as follows. In the
case of show-type verbs, the dative argument of a
causative sentence is the subject of its correspond-
ing inchoative sentence as shown in Example (6).
On the other hand, in the case of pass-type verbs,
the accusative argument is the subject of its corre-
sponding inchoative sentence as shown in Exam-
ple (7).

(6) Causative: Kare-ni camera-wo miseta.
him-DAT camera-ACC showed

(φI showed him a camera.)

Inchoative: Kare-ga mita.
he-NOM saw

(He saw φsomething.)

2238



(7) Causative: Camera-wo kare-ni watashita.
camera-ACC him-DAT passed

(φI passed him a camera.)

Inchoative: Camera-ga watatta.
camera-NOM passed

(A camera passed to φsomeone.)

Claim C is based on our observation. It is based
on the assumption that if an argument of a verb is
important for interpreting the meaning of the verb,
it tends to be placed near the verb and does not
tend to be omitted.

Claims D and E take into account the lexi-
cal information of arguments and assume that the
canonical word order of Japanese double object
constructions is affected by the characteristics of
the dative and/or accusative arguments. With re-
gard to Claim D, Matsuoka (2003) asserted that
the canonical order varies depending on the se-
mantic role of the dative argument. Specifically,
the DAT-ACC order is more preferred when the
semantic role of dative argument is animate Pos-
sessor than when the semantic role is inanimate
Goal.

Claim E is based on our observation again,
which argues that if the dative or accusative ar-
gument frequently co-occurs with the verb, it has
a strong relationship with the verb, and thus is
placed nearby. A typical example that satisfies this
claim is idiomatic expressions as will be discussed
in Section 5.4.

4 Example collection

A corpus-based analysis of canonical word or-
der can leverage a much larger number of exam-
ples than approaches based on theoretical analysis,
psychological experiments, or brain science can.
However, automatically collected examples some-
times include inappropriate ones. For example, if
we extract all sequences of a verb and its preced-
ing argument candidates, the sequence “Kagi-wo
kare-ni iwareta” (φI am told the key by him) is
mistakenly extracted from Example (8), although
kagi-wo is not actually an argument of iwareta but
an argument of oita.

(8) Kagi-wo kare-ni iwareta basho-ni oita.
key-ACC him-DAT told place-DAT put

(φI put the key on the place where he told φme.)

As predicted, we can alleviate this problem by
using a dependency parser. However, the accu-

racy of the state-of-the-art Japanese dependency
parser is not very high, specifically about 92% for
news paper articles (Yoshinaga and Kitsuregawa,
2014), and thus, inappropriate examples would be
extracted even if we used one.

Therefore, in this work, we decided to extract
examples only from reliable parts of dependency
parses. Specifically, we used a corpus consisting
of more than 10 billion unique sentences extracted
from the Web, selected parse trees that have no
syntactic ambiguity, and then extracted examples
only from the selected parse trees. This strat-
egy basically follows Kawahara and Kurohashi
(2002)’s strategy for automatic case frame con-
struction. The detailed procedure of example col-
lection is as follows:

1. Extract Japanese Web pages using linguistic
information, split the Web pages into sen-
tences using periods and HTML tags, and
merge sentences that are the exactly same
into one sentence to avoid collecting the same
example several times, which might be ex-
tracted from a mirror site.

2. Employ the Japanese morphological analyzer
JUMAN3 and the syntactic analyzer KNP4,
and extract examples of verbs and their argu-
ments from parse trees that have no syntactic
ambiguity5.

3. Collect the examples if the verb satisfies all
the following conditions:

(a) The verb has an entry in the JUMAN
dictionary and appears in the active
voice.

(b) The verb has more than 500 different
examples of dative and accusative argu-
ment pairs.

(c) The proportion of examples that include
both the dative and accusative argu-
ments out of all examples that include
the target verb is larger than 5%.

We employ the syntactic analyzer KNP with op-
tions “-dpnd-fast -tab -check.” KNP with these

5Murawaki and Kurohashi (2012) reported that 20.7%

of the dependency relations were extracted from a newspa-
per corpus and the accuracy was 98.3% when they adopted
Kawahara and Kurohashi (2002)’s strategy.

options outputs all head candidates for each bun-
setsu6 on the basis of heuristic rules. We then ex-
tract the example of a verb and its argument if the
argument candidate have only one head candidate.

For example, since Japanese is a head-final lan-
guage and only the verb bunsetsu can be the head
of the most noun bunsetsu in Japanese, basho-ni
in Example (8) has only one head candidate oita
(put), whereas kagi-wo and kare-ni have two head
candidates iwareta (told) and oita (put). Thus, we
extract only the example “basho-ni oita” from Ex-
ample (8). In addition, when an argument consists
of a compound noun, we only extract the head
noun and its postpositional particle as the argu-
ment to avoid data sparsity.

Condition 3-(c) is set in order to extract only
ditransitive verbs, which take both dative and ac-
cusative arguments. Although the threshold of 5%
seems small at first glance, most verbs that sat-
isfy it are actually ditransitive. This is because ar-
guments are often omitted in Japanese, and thus,
only some of the examples explicitly include both
dative and accusative arguments even in the case
of ditransitive verb.

Out of a corpus consisting of more than 10 bil-
lion unique sentences, 648 verbs satisfied these
conditions. Hereafter, we will focus on these 648
verbs. The average number of occurrences of
each verb was about 350 thousand and the av-
erage number of extracted examples that include
both dative and accusative arguments was about
59 thousand.

5 Corpus-based analysis of canonical
word order

Here, we present a corpus-based analysis of the
canonical word order of Japanese double object
constructions. We will address Claims A and C
in Section 5.1, Claim B in Section 5.2, Claim D in
Section 5.3, and Claim E in Section 5.4.

5.1 Word order for each verb

Let us examine the relation between the proportion
of the DAT only example RDAT-only and the propor-
tion of the ACC-DAT order RACC-DAT for each of
the 648 verbs to inspect Claims A and C.

6In Japanese, bunsetsu is a basic unit of dependency, con-
sisting of one or more content words and the following zero
or more function words. In this paper, we segment each ex-
ample sentence into a sequence of bunsetsu.

RDAT-only is calculated as follows:

RDAT-only =
NDAT-only

NDAT-only + NACC-only
,

where NDAT/ACC-only is the number of example
types that only include the corresponding argu-
ment out of the dative and accusative arguments.
For example, we count the number of example
types like Example (9) that include an accusative
argument but do not include a dative argument to
get the value of NACC-only. Accordingly, the large
RDAT-only value indicates that the dative argument
is less frequently omitted than the accusative argu-
ment.

(9) Gakuchô-ga gakui-wo juyo-shita.
president-NOM degree-ACC conferred

(The president conferred a degree on φsomeone.)

However, if we use all extracted examples that
include only one of the dative and accusative argu-
ments for calculating RDAT-only, the value is likely
to suffer from a bias that the larger RACC-DAT is,
the larger RDAT-only becomes. This is because the
arguments that tend to be placed near the verb have
relatively few syntactic ambiguity. Since we ex-
tract the examples from the reliable parts of parses
that have no syntactic ambiguity, these arguments
tend to be included in the extracted examples more
frequently than the other arguments.

To avoid this bias, we use only these examples
in which the nominative case is also extracted for
calculating RDAT-only. This is based on the as-
sumption that since Japanese word order is basi-
cally subject-object-verb order, if the nominative
argument is collected but one of the dative and
accusative arguments is not collected, the argu-
ment is actually omitted. Through a preliminary
investigation on Kyoto University Text Corpus7,
we confirmed the effect of this constraint to avoid
the bias.

On the other hand, RACC-DAT is calculated as
follows:

RACC-DAT =
NACC-DAT

NDAT-ACC + NACC-DAT
,

where NDAT-ACC/ACC-DAT is the number of ex-
ample types that include both the dative and ac-
cusative arguments in the corresponding order.

Figure 1 shows the results. The left figure shows
the relation between the proportion of the DAT

only example RDAT-only and the proportion of the
ACC-DAT order RACC-DAT for each of the 648
verbs. The x-axis denotes RDAT-only, the y-axis de-
notes RACC-DAT, and each point in the figure rep-
resents one of the 648 verbs. The dashed line is
a linear regression line. The right figure shows
the number of verbs in the corresponding range of
RACC-DAT.

Pearson’s correlation coefficient between
RDAT-only and RACC-DAT is 0.391, which weakly
supports Claim C: an argument whose grammati-
cal case is infrequently omitted with a given verb
tends to be placed near the verb. The proportion
of the ACC-DAT order for all 648 verbs is
0.328. Thus, if we presume that there is only
one canonical word order for Japanese double
object constructions, this result suggests that the
DAT-ACC order is the canonical one, as claimed
by Hoji (Claim A). However, the right figure
shows that the proportions of the ACC-DAT order
differ from verb to verb. Moreover, the values of
RACC-DAT for 435 out of 648 verbs are between
0.2 and 0.8. From these observations, we can say
the preferred word order cannot be determined
even if the verb is given in most cases.

5.2 Word order and verb type

To inspect Matsuoka (2003)’s claim that the
DAT-ACC order is canonical for show-type verbs,
whereas the ACC-DAT order is canonical for pass-
type verbs, we investigated the proportions of the

ACC-DAT order for several pass-type and show-
type verbs. In this investigation, we used 11 pass-
type verbs and 22 show-type verbs that were used
by Koizumi and Tamaoka (2004) in their psycho-
logical experiments8.

Table 1 shows the results. Although we can see
that the macro average of RACC-DAT of pass-type
verbs is larger than that of show-type verbs, the
difference is not significant9. Moreover, even in
the case of pass-type verbs, the DAT-ACC order
is dominant, which suggests Matsuoka (2003)’s
claim is not true. Note that this conclusion is
consistent with the experimental results reported
by both Miyamoto and Takahashi (2002) and
Koizumi and Tamaoka (2004).

5.3 Relation between word order and
semantic role of the dative argument

Next, let us examine the relation between the cate-
gory of the dative argument and the word order to
verify the effect of the semantic role of the dative
argument. We selected eight categories in the JU-
MAN dictionary10 that appear more than 1 million
times as dative arguments. Table 2 shows the re-
sults. We can see that there are differences in the

8We excluded a show-type verb hakaseru (dress), since
it is divided into two morphemes by JUMAN. Instead, we
added two show-type verbs shiraseru (notify) and kotodukeru
(leave a message).

9The two-tailed p-value of permutation test is about 0.177.
10In JUMAN dictionary, 22 categories are defined and

tagged to common nouns.

proportions of the ACC-DAT order. In particular,
when the dative argument’s category is PLACE-
FUNCTION such as shita (bottom) and yoko (side)
or ANIMAL-PART such as te (hand) and mi (body),
the ACC-DAT order is more preferred than other-
wise.

As mentioned in Section 3, Matsuoka (2003)
claimed the DAT-ACC order is more preferred
when the semantic role of the dative argument is
animate Possessor than when the semantic role is
inanimate Goal. Thus, we thought the DAT-ACC
order would be preferred when the dative argu-
ment’s category is PERSON, but we could not find
such a trend. We think, however, this is due to that
dative arguments of the PERSON category do not
always have the semantic role of an animate Pos-
sessor. Thus, we conducted a further investigation
in an attempt to verify Matsuoka (2003)’s claim.

First, we collected examples that satisfied the
following two conditions: the accusative argu-
ment belongs to ARTIFACT-OTHER category, and
the dative argument belongs to either PLACE-
INSTITUTION or PERSON category. We call the
former Type-A11, and the latter Type-B hereafter,
and consider that the semantic role of the da-
tive argument is inanimate Goal in most cases

11That is, the categories of the accusative and dative ar-
guments of a Type-A example are ARTIFACT-OTHER and

of Type-A, whereas it is animate Possessor in
most cases of Type-B. Example (10) shows typ-
ical examples of Type-A and Type-B. Here, the
categories of hon (book), gakkô (school), and
sensei (teacher) are ARTIFACT-OTHER, PLACE-
INSTITUTION, and PERSON, respectively, and the
semantic roles of dative arguments are considered
to be Goal in (10)-a and Possessor in (10)-b.

(10) a: Hon-wo gakkô-ni kaeshita.

(φsomeone returned the book to school.)

b: Sensei-ni hon-wo kaeshita.
teacher-DAT book-ACC returned

(φsomeone returned the book to the teacher.)

Next, we extracted verbs that had at least 100
examples of both types, calculated the proportion
of the ACC-DAT order RACC-DAT for each verb and
type, and counted the number of verbs for which
the values of RACC-DAT were significantly different
between Type-A and Type-B12. Out of 126 verbs
that have at least 100 examples for both types,
64 verbs show the trend that Type-A prefers the
ACC-DAT order more than Type-B does, and only
30 verbs have the opposite trend. This fact sup-
ports Matsuoka (2003)’s claim.

12We conducted a two-proportion z-test with a significance
level of 0.05.

Figure 2: The left figure shows the relation between the difference of NPMI(nDAT, v) from NPMI(nACC, v)
(x-axis) and the proportion of the ACC-DAT order RACC-DAT (y-axis). The tuples whose verb and ac-
cusative/dative argument are used as an idiom are represented by +/×. The right figure shows the number
of tuples of a verb and its dative and accusative arguments in the corresponding range of RACC-DAT.

5.4 Relation between word order and degree
of co-occurrence of verb and arguments

Now let us turn to the relation between the propor-
tion of the ACC-DAT order RACC-DAT and the de-
gree of co-occurrence of a verb and its argument to
verify Claim E. Here, we leverage the normalized
pointwise mutual information (NPMI) for measur-
ing the degree of co-occurrence between a verb
and its argument. NPMI is a normalized version of
PMI. The value ranges between [-1,+1] and takes -
1 for never occurring together, 0 for independence,
+1 for complete co-occurrence. The NPMI of a
verb v and its argument nc (c ∈ {DAT,ACC}) is
calculated as

NPMI(nc, v) =
PMI(nc, v)

−log(p(nc, v)) ,

where PMI(nc, v) = log
p(nc, v)

p(nc)p(v)
.

We investigate the relation between the pro-
portion of the ACC-DAT order RACC-DAT and the
difference of NPMI(nDAT, v) from NPMI(nACC, v),
i.e., NPMI(nDAT, v) − NPMI(nACC, v). If Claim E
is true, when the dative argument co-occurs with
the verb frequently, the dative argument tends to
be placed near the verb and thus the proportion of
the ACC-DAT order would take a large value.

We investigated 2302 tuples of a verb and its
dative and accusative arguments that appear more

than 500 times in the corpus. The average num-
ber of occurrences of each tuple was 1532. Fig-
ure 2 shows the results. The left figure shows the
relation between the difference of NPMI(nDAT, v)
from NPMI(nACC, v) and the proportion of the
ACC-DAT order RACC-DAT. Each point in the fig-
ure represents one of the 2302 tuples. The dashed
line is a linear regression line. The right figure
shows the number of tuples in the corresponding
range of RACC-DAT.

Pearson’s correlation coefficient between the
difference of NPMI and RACC-DAT is 0.567, which
supports Claim E: an argument that frequently co-
occurs with the verb tends to be placed near the
verb. Moreover, the values of RACC-DAT are larger
than 0.9 or smaller than 0.1 for 1631 out of 2302
tuples. This result indicates that if a tuple of a verb
and its dative and accusative arguments is given,
the preferred word order is determined. This is
contrastive to the conclusion that the preferred
word order cannot be determined even if the verb
is given as discussed in Section 5.1.

One of the typical examples that satisfy Claim
E is an idiomatic expression. Indeed, a verb and
its argument that are used as an idiom co-occur
frequently and are usually placed adjacent to each
other. In addition, it is well known that if the ar-
gument order is scrambled, the idiomatic meaning
disappears (Miyagawa and Tsujioka, 2004). Thus,
we investigated to what extent idiomatic expres-

2243



sions affected the findings discussed above. For
all 2302 tuples, we manually judged whether the
verb and the adjacent argument are used as an id-
iom in most cases. As a result, the verbs and
their accusative arguments are judged as idiomatic
for 404; the verbs and their dative arguments are
judged as idiomatic for 84 out of 2302 tuples. We
show these tuples by + and × in Figure 2, respec-
tively. As predicted, the values of RACC-DAT are
smaller than 0.1 for all of the former examples,
and larger than 0.9 for all of the latter examples.
However, even if we ignore these idiomatic exam-
ples, Pearson’s correlation coefficient between the
difference of NPMI and RACC-DAT is 0.513, which
is usually considered as moderate correlation.

6 Conclusion

This paper presented a corpus-based analysis of
canonical word order of Japanese double object
constructions. Our analysis suggests 1) the canon-
ical word order of such constructions varies from
verb to verb, 2) there is only a weak relation be-
tween the canonical word order and the verb type:
show-type and pass-type, 3) an argument whose
grammatical case is infrequently omitted with a
given verb tends to be placed near the verb, 4) the
canonical word order varies depending on the se-
mantic role of the dative argument, and 5) an argu-
ment that frequently co-occurs with the verb tends
to be placed near the verb.
