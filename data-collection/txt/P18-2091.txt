Abstract

This paper presents the first study aimed
at capturing stylistic similarity between
words in an unsupervised manner. We
propose extending the continuous bag of
words (CBOW) model (Mikolov et al.,
2013a) to learn style-sensitive word vectors
using a wider context window under the
assumption that the style of all the words
in an utterance is consistent. In addition,
we introduce a novel task to predict lexical
stylistic similarity and to create a bench-
mark dataset for this task. Our experiment
with this dataset supports our assumption
and demonstrates that the proposed exten-
sions contribute to the acquisition of style-
sensitive word embeddings.

1 Introduction

Analyzing and generating natural language texts
requires the capturing of two important aspects of
language: what is said and how it is said. In the
literature, much more attention has been paid to
studies on what is said. However, recently, captur-
ing how it is said, such as stylistic variations, has
also proven to be useful for natural language pro-
cessing tasks such as classification, analysis, and
generation (Pavlick and Tetreault, 2016; Niu and
Carpuat, 2017; Wang et al., 2017).

This paper studies the stylistic variations of
words in the context of the representation learning
of words. The lack of subjective or objective defi-
nitions is a major difficulty in studying style (Xu,
2017). Previous attempts have been made to de-
fine a selected aspect of the notion of style (e.g.,
politeness) (Mairesse and Walker, 2007; Pavlick
and Nenkova, 2015; Flekova et al., 2016; Preotiuc-
Pietro et al., 2016; Sennrich et al., 2016; Niu et al.,
2017); however, it is not straightforward to create

tactic/semantic similarity.

strict guidelines for identifying the stylistic profile
of a given text. The systematic evaluations of style-
sensitive word representations and the learning of
style-sensitive word representations in a supervised
manner are hampered by this. In addition, there
is another trend of research forward controlling
style-sensitive utterance generation without defin-
ing the style dimensions (Li et al., 2016; Akama
et al., 2017); however, this line of research consid-
ers style to be something associated with a given
specific character, i.e., a persona, and does not aim
to capture the stylistic variation space.

The contributions of this paper are three-fold.
(1) We propose a novel architecture that acquires
style-sensitive word vectors (Figure 1) in an un-
supervised manner. (2) We construct a novel
dataset for style, which consists of pairs of style-
sensitive words with each pair scored accord-
ing to its stylistic similarity. (3) We demon-
strate that our word vectors capture the stylis-
tic similarity between two words successfully.
In addition, our training script and dataset are
available on https://jqk09a.github.io/
style-sensitive-word-vectors/.

2 Style-sensitive Word Vector

The key idea is to extend the continuous bag of
words (CBOW) (Mikolov et al., 2013a) by distin-

guishing nearby contexts and wider contexts under
the assumption that a style persists throughout ev-
ery single utterance in a dialog. We elaborate on it
in this section.

2.1 Notation

Letwt denote the target word (token) in the corpora
and Ut = {w1, . . . , wt−1, wt, wt+1, . . . , w|Ut|} de-
note the utterance (word sequence) including wt.
Here, wt+d or wt−d ∈ Ut is a context word of wt
(e.g., wt+1 is the context word next to wt), where
d ∈ N>0 is the distance between the context words
and the target word wt.

For each word (token) w, bold face vw and ṽw
denote the vector of w and the vector predicting
the word w. Let V denote the vocabulary.

2.2 Baseline Model (CBOW-NEAR-CTX)

First, we give an overview of CBOW, which is our
baseline model. CBOW predicts the target word
wt given nearby context words in a window with
width δ:

Cnearwt := {wt±d ∈ Ut | 1 ≤ d ≤ δ} (1)

The set Cnearwt contains in total at most 2δ words, in-
cluding δ words to the left and δ words to the right
of a target word. Specifically, we train the word
vectors ṽwt and vc (c ∈ Cnearwt ) by maximizing the
following prediction probability:

P (wt|Cnearwt ) ∝ exp
(̃
vwt ·

1

|Cnearwt |
∑

c∈Cnearwt

vc

)
. (2)

The CBOW captures both semantic and syntactic
word similarity through the training using nearby
context words. We refer to this form of CBOW
as CBOW-NEAR-CTX. Note that, in the imple-
mentation of Mikolov et al. (2013b), the window
width δ is sampled from a uniform distribution;
however, in this work, we fixed δ for simplicity.
Hereafter, throughout our experiments, we turn off
the random resizing of δ.

2.3 Learning Style with Utterance-size
Context Window (CBOW-ALL-CTX)

CBOW is designed to learn the semantic and syn-
tactic aspects of words from their nearby con-
text (Mikolov et al., 2013b). However, an inter-
esting problem is determining the location where
the stylistic aspects of words can be captured. To
address this problem, we start with the assumption
that a style persists throughout each single utter-

ance in a dialog, that is, the stylistic profile of a
word in an utterance must be consistent with other
words in the same utterance. Based on this assump-
tion, we propose extending CBOW to use all the
words in an utterance as context,

Callwt := {wt±d ∈ Ut | 1 ≤ d}, (3)

instead of only the nearby words. Namely, we
expand the context window from a fixed width
to the entire utterance. This training strategy is
expected to lead to learned word vectors that are
more sensitive to style rather than to other aspects.
We refer to this version as CBOW-ALL-CTX.

2.4 Learning the Style and
Syntactic/Semantic Separately

To learn the stylistic aspect more exclusively, we
further extended the learning strategy.

Distant-context Model (CBOW-DIST-CTX)
First, remember that using nearby context is effec-
tive for learning word vectors that capture semantic
and syntactic similarities. However, this means that
using the nearby context can lead the word vectors
to capture some aspects other than style. Therefore,
as the first extension, we propose excluding the
nearby context Cnearwt from all the context C

all
wt . In

other words, we use the distant context words only:

Cdistwt := C
all
wt \ C

near
wt = {wt±d ∈ Ut | δ < d}. (4)

We expect that training with this type of context
will lead to word vectors containing the style-
sensitive information only. We refer to this method
as CBOW-DIST-CTX.

Separate Subspace Model (CBOW-SEP-CTX)
As the second extension to distill off aspects other
than style, we use both nearby and all contexts
(Cnearwt and C

all
wt ). As Figure 2 shows, both the vector

vw and ṽw of each word w ∈ V are divided into
two vectors:

vw = xw ⊕ yw, ṽw = x̃w ⊕ ỹw, (5)

where ⊕ denotes vector concatenation. Vectors
xw and x̃w indicate the style-sensitive part of vw
and ṽw respectively. Vectors yw and ỹw indicate
the syntactic/semantic-sensitive part of vw and
ṽw respectively. For training, when the context
words are near the target word (Cnearwt ), we update
both the style-sensitive vectors (x̃wt , xc) and the
syntactic/semantic-sensitive vectors (ỹwt , yc), i.e.,
ṽwt , vc. Conversely, when the context words are



574

Figure 2: The architecture of CBOW-SEP-CTX.

far from the target word (Cdistwt ), we only update
the style-sensitive vectors (x̃wt , xc). Formally, the
prediction probability is calculated as follows:

P1(wt|Cnearwt ) ∝ exp
(̃
vwt ·

1

|Cnearwt |
∑

c∈Cnearwt

vc

)
, (6)

P2(wt|Cdistwt ) ∝ exp
(
x̃wt ·

1

|Cdistwt |
∑
c∈Cdistwt

xc

)
. (7)

At the time of learning, two prediction probabili-
ties (loss functions) are alternately computed, and
the word vectors are updated. We refer to this
method using the two-fold contexts separately as
the CBOW-SEP-CTX.

3 Experiments

We investigated which word vectors capture the
stylistic, syntactic, and semantic similarities.

3.1 Settings
Training and Test Corpus We collected
Japanese fictional stories from the Web to construct
the dataset. The dataset contains approximately
30M utterances of fictional characters. We sepa-
rated the data into a 99%–1% split for training and
testing. In Japanese, the function words at the end
of the sentence often exhibit style (e.g., desu+wa,
desu+ze1;) therefore, we used an existing lexicon
of multi-word functional expressions (Miyazaki
et al., 2015). Overall, the vocabulary size |V| was
100K.

Hyperparameters We chose the dimensions of
both the style-sensitive and the syntactic/semantic-
sensitive vectors to be 300, and the dimensions
of the baseline CBOWs were 300. The learn-
ing rate was adjusted individually for each part
in {xw,yw, x̃w, ỹw} such that “the product of the

learning rate and the expectation of the number of
updates” was a fixed constant. We ran the optimizer
with its default settings from the implementation of
Mikolov et al. (2013a). The training stopped after
10 epochs. We fixed the nearby window width to
δ = 5.

3.2 Stylistic Similarity Evaluation

3.2.1 Data Construction

To verify that our models capture the stylistic simi-
larity, we evaluated our style-sensitive vector xwt
by comparing to other word vectors on a novel
artificial task matching human stylistic similarity
judgments. For this evaluation, we constructed a
novel dataset with human judgments on the stylis-
tic similarity between word pairs by performing
the following two steps. First, we collected only
style-sensitive words from the test corpus because
some words are strongly associated with stylistic
aspects (Kinsui, 2003; Teshigawara and Kinsui,
2011) and, therefore, annotating random words for
stylistic similarity is inefficient. We asked crowd-
sourced workers to select style-sensitive words
in utterances. Specifically, for the crowdsourced
task of picking “style-sensitive” words, we pro-
vided workers with a word-segmented utterance
and asked them to pick words that they expected
to be altered within different situational contexts
(e.g., characters, moods, purposes, and the back-
ground cultures of the speaker and listener.). Then,
we randomly sampled 1, 000 word pairs from the
selected words and asked 15 workers to rate each
of the pairs on five scales (from −2: “The style
of the pair is different” to +2: “The style of the
pair is similar”), inspired by the syntactic/semantic
similarity dataset (Finkelstein et al., 2002; Gerz
et al., 2016). Finally, we picked only word pairs
featuring clear worker agreement in which more
than 10 annotators rated the pair with the same
sign, which consisted of random pairs of highly
agreeing style-sensitive words. Consequently, we
obtained 399 word pairs with similarity scores. To
our knowledge, this is the first study that created an
evaluation dataset to measure the lexical stylistic
similarity.

In the task of selecting style-sensitive words, the
pairwise inter-annotator agreement was moderate
(Cohen’s kappa κ is 0.51). In the rating task, the
pairwise inter-annotator agreement for two classes
({−2,−1} or {+1,+2}) was fair (Cohen’s kappa
κ is 0.23). These statistics suggest that, at least

in Japanese, native speakers share a sense of style-
sensitivity of words and stylistic similarity between
style-sensitive words.

3.2.2 Stylistic Sensitivity
We used this evaluation dataset to compute the
Spearman rank correlation (ρstyle) between the co-
sine similarity scores between the learned word
vectors cos(vw,vw′) and the human judgements.
Table 1 shows the results on its left side. First,
our proposed model, CBOW-ALL-CTX outper-
formed the baseline CBOW-NEAR-CTX. Further-
more, the x of CBOW-DIST-CTX and CBOW-SEP-
CTX demonstrated better correlations for stylis-
tic similarity judgments (ρstyle = 56.1 and 51.3,
respectively). Even though the x of CBOW-
SEP-CTX was trained with the same context win-
dow as CBOW-ALL-CTX, the style-sensitivity was
boosted by introducing joint training with the near
context. CBOW-DIST-CTX, which uses only the
distant context, slightly outperforms CBOW-SEP-
CTX. These results indicate the effectiveness of
training using a wider context window.

3.3 Syntactic and Semantic Evaluation
We further investigated the properties of each
model using the following criterion: (1) the
model’s ability to capture the syntactic aspect was
assessed through a task predicting part of speech
(POS) and (2) the model’s ability to capture the
semantic aspect was assessed through a task cal-
culating the correlation with human judgments for
semantic similarity.

3.3.1 Syntactic Sensitivity
First, we tested the ability to capture syntactic sim-
ilarity of each model by checking whether the POS
of each word was the same as the POS of a neigh-
boring word in the vector space. Specifically, we
calculated SYNTAXACC@N defined as follows:

1

|V|N
∑
w∈V

∑
w′∈N (w)

I[POS(w)=POS(w′)], (8)

where I[condition] = 1 if the condition is true and
I[conditon] = 0 otherwise, the function POS(w)
returns the actual POS tag of the wordw, andN (w)
denotes the set of the N top similar words {w′} to
w w.r.t. cos(vw,vw′) in each vector space.

Table 1 shows SYNTAXACC@N with N = 5
and 10. For both N , the y (the syntactic/semantic
part) of CBOW-NEAR-CTX, CBOW-ALL-CTX
and CBOW-SEP-CTX achieved similarly good. In-
terestingly, even though the x of CBOW-SEP-CTX
used the same context as that of CBOW-ALL-CTX,
the syntactic sensitivity of x was suppressed. We
speculate that the syntactic sensitivity was distilled
off by the other part of the CBOW-SEP-CTX vector,
i.e., y learned using only the near context, which
captured more syntactic information. In the next
section, we analyze CBOW-SEP-CTX for the dif-
ferent characteristics of x and y.

3.3.2 Semantic and Topical Sensitivities
To test the model’s ability to capture the se-
mantic similarity, we also measured correla-
tions with the Japanese Word Similarity Dataset
(JWSD) (Sakaizawa and Komachi, 2018), which
consists of 4,000 Japanese word pairs annotated
with semantic similarity scores by human workers.
For each model, we calculate and show the Spear-
man rank correlation score (ρsem) between the co-
sine similarity score cos(vw,vw′) and the human
judgements on JWSD in Table 12. CBOW-DIST-
CTX has the lowest score (ρsem=15.9); however,
surprisingly, the stylistic vector xwt has the high-
est score (ρsem=28.9), while both vectors have a
high ρstyle. This result indicates that the proposed
stylistic vector xwt captures not only the stylistic
similarity but also the captures semantic similarity,
contrary to our expectations (ideally, we want the
stylistic vector to capture only the stylistic similar-
ity). We speculate that this is because not only the
style but also the topic is often consistent in single
utterances. For example, “サンタ (Santa Clause)”
and “トナカイ (reindeer)” are topically relevant
words and these words tend to appear in a single
utterance. Therefore, stylistic vectors {xw} using
all the context words in an utterance also capture
the topic relatedness. In addition, JWSD contains
topic-related word pairs and synonym pairs; there-
fore the word vectors that capture the topic similar-
ity have higher ρsem. We will discuss this point in

2Note that the low performance of our baseline (ρsem =
27.8 for CBOW-NEAR-CTX) is unsurprising comparing to
English baselines (cf., Taguchi et al. (2017)).

3.4 Analysis of Trained Word Vectors
Finally, to further understand what types of features
our CBOW-SEP-CTX model acquired, we show
some words3 with the four most similar words in
Table 2. Here, for English readers, we also report a
result for English4. The English result also shows
an example of the performance of our model on
another language. The left side of Table 2 (for
stylistic vector x) shows the results. We found that
the Japanese word “拙者 (I; classical)” is similar
to “ござる (be; classical)” or words containing it
(the second row of Table 2). The result looks rea-
sonable, because words such as “拙者 (I; classical)”
and “ござる (be; classical)” are typically used by
Japanese Samurai or Ninja. We can see that the vec-
tors captured the similarity of these words, which
are stylistically consistent across syntactic and se-
mantic varieties. Conversely, the right side of the
table (for the syntactic/semantic vector y) shows
that the word “拙者 (I; classical)” is similar to the
personal pronoun (e.g., “僕 (I; male, childish)”).
We further confirmed that 15 the top similar words
are also personal pronouns (even though they are
not shown due to space limitations). These results
indicate that the proposed CBOW-SEP-CTX model
jointly learns two different types of lexical similar-

stylistic similarity evaluation dataset.

ities, i.e., the stylistic and syntactic/semantic simi-
larities in the different parts of the vectors. How-
ever, our stylistic vector also captured the topic
similarity, such as “サンタ (Santa Clause)” and
“トナカイ (reindeer)” (the fourth row of Table 2).
Therefore, there is still room for improvement in
capturing the stylistic similarity.

4 Conclusions and Future Work

This paper presented the unsupervised learning of
style-sensitive word vectors, which extends CBOW
by distinguishing nearby contexts and wider con-
texts. We created a novel dataset for style, where
the stylistic similarity between word pairs was
scored by human. Our experiment demonstrated
that our method leads word vectors to distinguish
the stylistic aspect and other semantic or syntactic
aspects. In addition, we also found that our training
cannot help confusing some styles and topics. A
future direction will be to addressing the issue by
further introducing another context such as a docu-
ment or dialog-level context windows, where the
topics are often consistent but the styles are not.
