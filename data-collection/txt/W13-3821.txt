of writing], (Levin 1993: 232-233). The patterns 

are taken from the Pattern Dictionary of English

stance, whereas the verb knife entails the notion 
of a knife as a means of killing. 

 Levin argues that the meaning of the verb de-

termines to a large extent its syntactic behaviour. 

She therefore undertakes the description of Eng-

lish verb classes that share both syntactic alterna-

tions and similar meaning. This claim bears 

comparison with empirical work in Corpus Lin-

guistics, such as Sinclair's account of yield (Sin-
clair 1990: 53-65), where convincing evidence 

that sense and syntax are closely associated was 

found. Similar claims are made in Natural Lan-

guage Processing, especially in distributional 

models of meaning (Grefenstette 1994; Bieman 

& Giesbrecht 2011) used in a large number of 

applications (Cohen & Widdows 2009).  

Levin's verb classes have been integrated and 

extended into a lexical resource for Natural Lan-

guage Processing (NLP), VerbNet
3
 (Kipper et al. 

2008) used in applications such as Semantic Role 

Labelling (Swier et al. 2004). The present paper 

proposes to create a semantic network from 

PDEV, by building strings of STs and linking 

them to verbs. One of the motivations behind this 

work is that PDEV contains useful information 

which is absent in NLP resources: while VerbNet 

analyses the interface between thematic roles 

(e.g. Agent, Patient) and selectional restrictions 

(e.g. [+ANIMATE], [+CONCRETE]), PDEV 

maps clause roles (e.g. Subject, Object) using 

STs (e.g. [[Human]], [[Location]]). 

This paper describes the background and 

methodology for this work (section 2) and pro-

vides a detailed analysis of Levin's claims about 

the 'poison' verb class (section 3), before describ-

ing results obtained from using the semantic 

network (section 4).

2 Methodology 
2.1 Background 
Corpus Pattern Analysis (CPA) is a new tech-
nique for mapping meaning onto words in text 
(Hanks 2012). The focus of CPA is on analysing 
large corpora to identify the prototypical syn-
tagmatic and collocational patterns with which 
words are associated. It has simultaneously given 
rise to a new theory of language in use, the Theo-
ry of Norms and Exploitations (TNE, see Hanks 
2013), which can be compared with Pattern 
Grammar (Hunston and Francis 2000) and Con-
struction Grammar (Goldberg 1995).  

PDEV (in progress) aims to provide a well-
founded corpus-driven account of verb meaning, 
using STs to stand as prototypes for collocational 
clusters occurring in each clause role. Current 
CPA practice has shown that the scientific con-
cepts from WordNet4, the most widely used se-
mantic repository, do not map well onto words as 
they are actually used; this is partly because folk 
concepts, and not scientific concepts, form the 
foundation of meaning in natural language 
(Wierzbicka 1984). For this reason, a new shal-
low Ontology consisting of 225 STs has been 
developed for PDEV which contrasts with 
WordNet in the following key respects: 

 WordNet contains many scientific con-
cepts, whereas the PDEV Ontology is 
modeled on folk concepts, for example, 
WordNet has over 50 hyponyms for Ani-
mate Being, whereas PDEV has only 17 
STs listed under [[Animate]]; 

 WordNet is intuition-based whereas the 
PDEV  Ontology  is  ‘corpus-driven’  and 
built from the words upwards. 

For each verb in PDEV, a sample of ~250 lines 
is analysed and phraseological norms, or pat-
terns, identified and then recorded using STs. For 
example, in the account of pattern 1 of strangle, 
below, the STs [[Human 1]] and [[Human 2]] are 
used to indicate that, prototypically, it is a human 
who performs the action of strangling and they 
typically perform this act upon another human. 

 
(1) [[Human 1]] strangle [[Human 2]] 

 
Where relevant, information about adverbial 

phrases is recorded as part of the pattern. For 
example, pattern 1 of drown, below, records that 
this use of drown frequently selects an adverbial

phrase indicating in which [[Watercourse]] or 
what type of [[Liquid]] the drowning occurred. 
 
(2) [[Human | Animal]] drown [NO OBJ] (in  
[[Watercourse]] | in  [[Liquid]]) 
 
These STs form the basis of the semantic net-
work, which generates semantic strings from pat-
terns and link them to verbs. 

2.2 A semantic network for verbs 
PDEV allows for a new kind of verb classifica-
tion, by clustering verbs according to the STs 
with which they combine across patterns. To ex-
plore this method further, PDEV patterns have 
been simplified to semantic strings, i.e. combina-
tions of types in various pattern positions. More 
specifically, semantic strings are the result of the 
following two changes to the PDEV patterns: 

 only STs and lexical sets of subjects, ob-
jects, adverbials, adverbial functions, and 
prepositions are kept and concatenated; 

 since patterns allow for several alterna-
tive STs in the same clause role and for 
these clause roles to be optional, all com-
binations are generated. 

   Based on the analysis of more than 3500 pat-
terns available in the PDEV, the current version 
of the network totals over 5064 different seman-
tic strings, with 955 of them linking more than 
one verb (covering over 71% of patterns). This 
allows the identification of both the different 
strings a verb combines with and the verbs clus-
tered around each semantic string. For example, 
the semantic string ‘[[Human]] verb [[Human]]’, 
accounting for the transitive use of verbs such as 
corner and sacrifice, is the largest cluster of the 
network, with 188 verbs. Lastly, the network 
offers the possibility of computing the similarity 
between verbs, using their shared strings, and 
applying standard distributional methods. 

3 Levin’s hypotheses 
3.1 Instrumental Phrases 
Levin hypothesizes that few of the 'poison' verbs 
'will select instrumental phrases (IPs), but that 
where this is the case, the instrumental phrase is 
a  “cognate”’. Table 1 lists the proportion of to-
kens combining with IPs for each PDEV pattern, 
focusing on  the patterns which  relate  to  the  ‘lit-
eral’  (ie  killing-related) senses and with a non-
instrumental subject, i.e. [[Human]], [[Institu-
tion]] or [[Animate]].

It is notable that only crucify and knife – verbs 
where the means is lexicalized unambiguously – 
generated zero returns. Elsewhere, contrary to 
Levin’s hypothesis, the selection of instrumental 
phrases is not infrequent. This could be ex-
plained by the broadness of the set of instruments 
lexicalized by verbs such as stab or hang (see 
below). It is interesting to compare the three pat-
terns of hang illustrated below: ‘[[Human 1 | In-
stitution]] hang [[Human 2]]’ rarely selects an 
instrumental phrase, presumably because in this 
context, where the event described is a formally 
decreed execution, the instrument used (i.e. rope, 
gallows) is unambiguous. However, ‘[[Human]] 
hang [NO OBJ] ([Adv[Location]])’ and ‘[[Hu-
man]] hang [Self]’ both describe ‘unofficial’ acts 
where the instrument used cannot be taken for 
granted, and in both these patterns the verb se-
lects an IP with relatively high frequency. 
Levin’s hypothesis, that where an instrumental 

phrase is used it  will  be  a  ‘cognate’, holds, if 
‘cognate’ is taken to mean ‘an object with similar 
physical properties to the object prototypically 
used to commit the act in question’. 

The instrumental phrases for stab include cog-
nates such as carving knife, sheath knife, and 
butcher’s knife, along with the less conventional 
screwdriver and pencil. For the previously-
mentioned  ‘unofficial’  senses of hang, the in-

strumental phrases include, rope, string, a belt, 
and blanket torn into strips. The broad and open-
ended nature of these lexical sets (i.e. ‘anything 
sharp and pointed’, or ‘anything long, thin, flexi-
ble and rope-like’) suggests that where the means 
lexicalized by a verb is ambiguous, it is not unu-
sual for an instrumental phrase to be selected. 

3.2 STs as subjects 
Levin hypothesizes that few of the ‘poison’ verbs 
'allow instrumental subjects'.

In order to investigate this aspect further, STs 
in Subject position have been extracted from the 
semantic network (Figure 1). As can be seen, 
both Instrument and Agent roles occur as sub-
jects: the subjects are [[Gas]], [[Stuff]], [[Event]] 
and [[Eventuality]]. In conformity  with  Levin’s 
claim, [[Stuff]] accounts for relatively few sub-
jects for suffocate (25%) and poison (12%).  In 
contrast, in our sample asphyxiate was only ob-
served to select [[Gas]] and [[Event]] as subjects. 
The network also reveals subjects that are neither 
Agents nor Instruments, represented by the ST 
[[Eventuality]] (example 3). 
 
(3) A rock-fall into Shimbara Bay caused three 
surges which drowned 15,000 people. 

 
Figure 1 also shows how verbs can be grouped 

according to STs: all verbs except asphyxiate 
select [[Human]] in subject position. In addition, 
poison, hang and crucify all select [[Human]] 
and [[Institution]] as subjects. 

4 ST-based classification 
4.1 Literal senses of 'poison' verbs 
The semantic network records a total of 161 se-
mantic strings for the ‘poison’ verbs, only 28 of 
which are related to ‘killing’, and 9 strings clus-
ter two or more verbs. The largest cluster is 
around the  string  ‘[[Human]]  verb  [[Human]]’, 
which is selected by all verbs with the exception 
of asphyxiate (see 3.2). No strings provide evi-
dence that asphyxiate belongs to the 'poison' 
class, as opposed to e.g. poison and suffocate, 
which share three strings. 
The  network  includes  strings  of  ‘[[Human]] 

verb [NO OBJ]’ for hang, drown, and suffocate, 
which are inchoative alternations of the transi-
tive/causative pattern. Levin has these alterna-
tions as a separate class [‘suffocate’ verbs] which 
only includes asphyxiate, choke, drown, stifle 
and suffocate. Levin does not list hang as having 
an  inchoative use  in  the ‘killing’  sense, but evi-
dence is found in the corpus (40 examples out of 
500) as in He was sentenced to hang. 

Reflexive object uses such  as  in  ‘[[Human]] 
verb [SELF]’ for drown and hang have not been 
identified by Levin (see Obligatorily Reflexive 
Objects class), but must be accounted for. 
   Strings that include adverbials are relevant to 
knife and stab,  which  share  ‘[[Human]]  verb 
[[Human]]  {to  death}’  (resultative),  and  ‘[[Hu-
man]] verb [[Human]] {in [[Body Part]]}’. These 
adverbial phrases serve to clarify some of the 

semantic ambiguity that these verbs entail, i.e. 
whether or not the action resulted in death, and 
the body part affected; verbs such as asphyxiate 
and strangle entail no such ambiguity and are not 
observed to select these adverbial patterns. 

4.2 Extended meanings of 'poison' verbs 
The semantic network identifies similarities be-
yond those previously discussed where the focus 
has been on strings entailing  the notion of ‘kill-
ing’.  Semantic  strings  extend  to  non-[[Human]] 
patients  as  exemplified  by  ‘[[Human]]  verb 
[[Physical Object]]’  (smother, hang). Here, the 
verb does not entail ‘killing’, e.g. hanging a lamp 
or smothering burning clothes with blankets. 

Moreover, some strings entail metaphorical 
meanings. For example, drown and smother 
share the ‘[[Sound]] verb [[Sound]]’ string; both 
patterns can be interpreted literally as one 
[[Sound]] being so loud that another [[Sound]] 
cannot be heard. Strangle and suffocate share the 
string  ‘[[Anything]]  verb  [[Eventuality]]’;  both 
conveying the notion that an [[Eventuality]] can 
be hindered or brought to an undesired end by 
[[Anything]]. The network thus helps to unveil 
the fact that the similarities between verbs can 
hold on several dimensions of meaning: whilst 
the  ‘poison’  verbs  also  select  strings which  ex-
press a means of killing, some of them share oth-
er strings which are not covered in Levin’s book. 

5 Conclusion and perspectives 
This paper has proposed a new approach to verb 
classification based on strings of STs (selected 
from a well-founded ontology) extracted from a 
semantic network based on PDEV patterns. Fo-
cusing on the 'poison' verbs has enabled the iden-
tification of key differences between this re-
source and Levin’s account. The paper has stud-
ied the hypothesis that the ‘poison’ verbs lexical-
ize a means, through claims made on syntactic 
and semantic constraints on prepositional phrases 
and subjects. The analysis has revealed that this 
class must be revised in light of corpus evidence, 
and that sub-groupings can be made. 

 This work will be extended to: 
 systematically explore the network with 

NLP techniques (e.g. distributional meth-
ods) to rank the similarity between verbs; 

 investigate degrees of ambiguity in lexi-
calization focusing on instrumental 
phrases and instrumental subjects; 

 explore metaphorical class extension.
