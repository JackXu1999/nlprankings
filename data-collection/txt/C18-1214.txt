Abstract

Most work on part-of-speech (POS) tagging is focused on high resource languages, or examines
low-resource and active learning settings through simulated studies. We evaluate POS tagging
techniques on an actual endangered language, Griko. We present a resource that contains 114 nar-
ratives in Griko, along with sentence-level translations in Italian, and provides gold annotations
for the test set. Based on a previously collected small corpus, we investigate several traditional
methods, as well as methods that take advantage of monolingual data or project cross-lingual
POS tags. We show that the combination of a semi-supervised method with cross-lingual transfer
is more appropriate for this extremely challenging setting, with the best tagger achieving an ac-
curacy of 72.9%. With an applied active learning scheme, which we use to collect sentence-level
annotations over the test set, we achieve improvements of more than 21 percentage points.

1 Introduction

Most natural language processing (NLP) applications have been developed for and tested on only a
handful of languages. The majority of the world’s languages are under-represented in the field, mostly
due to the lack of proper resources. Endangered languages pose additional problems, as the lack of
resources is further exacerbated by the lack of standard orthography. Therefore, there is an obvious need
for both resources and technologies adapted to languages of under-represented communities. Especially
in the case of endangered languages, computational approaches can be used to scale and accelerate
documentation and revitalization efforts.

For the purposes of this study, we focus on Griko, a Greek dialect spoken in southern Italy, in the
Grecı̀a Salentina area southeast of Lecce.1 There is another endangered Italo-Greek variety in southern
Italy spoken in the region of Calabria, known as Grecanico or Greco. Both languages, jointly referred
to as Italiot Greek, were included as seriously endangered in the UNESCO Red Book of Endangered
Languages in 1999. Griko is only partially intelligible with modern Greek, and unlike other Greek di-
alects, it uses the Latin alphabet. Less than 20,000 people (mostly people over 60 years old) are believed
to be native speakers (Horrocks, 2009; Douri and De Santis, 2015), a number which is quite likely an
overestimation (Chatzikyriakidis, 2010).

In general, the lack of annotated resources can be addressed through several directions. The obvious
first one is the collection of human annotations, an expensive and time-consuming process. Another
option is to collect additional monolingual data and use them in weakly-supervised approaches. Finally,
one could use methods that transfer knowledge across languages, in which case they could focus on
collecting translations or bilingual data. With this paper we attempt to quantify how effective each of
these directions can be at the beginning of building applications for an endangered language.

We present a corpus of Griko narratives, first collected in the beginning of the 20th century, along
with their Italian translations, suitable for computational research on the language.2 We focus on the task

of part-of-speech (POS) tagging, an important subcomponent of many downstream NLP applications,
although our long-term goal is to annotate the whole corpus with morphosyntactic tags. Three linguists
were tasked with creating gold-standard annotations for a portion of the resource, which we use as a test
set in our experiments. Subsequently, our corpus includes human annotations as well as monolingual
data and translations, allowing us to explore all approaches.

Based on another small Griko corpus with POS annotations, we explore computational methods for
annotating our collected resource with POS tags. We evaluate several commonly used models for POS-
tagging. We start with a traditional feature-based cross-entropy tagger, a Conditional Random Field
(CRF) tagger, and a neural bi-LSTM tagger. We further experiment with methods that take advantage
of additional monolingual data, and with methods that project cross-lingual tags through alignments. In
addition, we are the first to combine the two latter approaches for POS-tagging in a low-resource setting,
and we show that their combination achieves higher accuracy. Finally, we study how additional human
annotations can be incorporated through an applied active learning scenario. In line with previous work,
we show that this greatly improves the tagging accuracy.

Our contributions are three-fold: first, we aim to provide coarse insights into what type of annotations
and resources are more effective at the early stages of developing a tagging tool for an endangered
language. Second, we hope that the release of our resource will spark further interest in the computational
community, so that previous, and future, methods are tested in actual endangered language settings.
Finally, we benchmark the accuracy of several models on our dataset, and test them in a traditional
setting and in a transduction setting where we also use the translations of the test set. We also evaluate
all methods in an active learning scenario, showing that different approaches are suitable for different
amounts of annotated data.

When only 360 annotated sentences are available, the best method is the one that combines them
with both cross-lingual projections and monolingual data, achieving an accuracy of 72.9%. As the ac-
tive learning scheme unfolds, however, we show that there is no need for either semi-supervised nor
transfer learning approaches: a simpler feature-based CRF model achieves the highest scores, with more
than 94% accuracy.

2 Resource

Resources in Griko are very scarce. The German scholar Gerhard Rohlfs pioneered research on Griko
and composed the first grammar of the language (Rohlfs, 1977), also heavily influencing the subsequent
grammar created by Karanastasis (1997). Although the language has been further studied, almost no
corpora are available for linguistics research.

The only Griko corpus available online3 (Lekakou et al., 2013) consists of about 20 minutes of speech
in Griko, along with text translations into Italian. The corpus (henceforth UoI corpus, as it is hosted at
the University of Ioannina, Greece) consists of 330 mostly elicited utterances by nine native speakers,
annotated with transcriptions, morphosyntactic tags, and glossing in Italian.

The most noted Griko scholar is Vito Domenico Palumbo (1854–1928) who made the first serious
attempts to create a literary Griko for the dialect of Calimera (the most populous of the nine remaining
communities where Griko is still spoken), based on modified Italian orthography. Salvatore Tommasi and

Salvatore Sicuro then edited and published Palumbo’s manuscripts (Palumbo, 1998; Palumbo, 1999), a
part of which we now make available for computational and linguistic research.

After scraping from their website4 114 narratives that Palumbo had collected, along with their Italian
translations, we removed all HTML markup and normalized the orthography: we substituted all curly
quotes and apostrophes with simple ones, and substituted the vowels with circumflex (â, ô, û) that were
used in a few contractions with the more common accented vowel–apostrophe combination (à’, ò’ ù’).
Using the Moses tools (Koehn et al., 2007) with the Italian settings, we lowercased and tokenized our
parallel dataset. For completeness purposes, we also make available the untokenized and proper-case
versions of the corpus. The statistics of the resource are shown in Table 1.

We chose the first 10 narratives to be our test set, as they correspond to about 10% of all sentences.
The rest of the narratives are treated as a monolingual or parallel resource to be leveraged. The test set
was, in addition, hand-annotated by linguists: they corrected any tokenization errors that were introduced
by the automatic process (for example, regarding the use of the apostrophe) and produced POS tags for
every test sentence.

For every narrative, one of the linguists was presented with the produced output of the tagger, and
proceeded to correct it. In order to ensure the quality of the annotations, a second linguist was then pre-
sented with the result of the work of the first linguist and tasked with correcting it, until all disagreements
were resolved. Although it significantly slowed down the annotation process, we hope that this scheme
ensured the quality of our annotations.

2.1 Differences from previous Griko resources

Orthography Griko has never had a consistent orthography. The transcriptions in the UoI corpus are
based on orthographic conventions found in the few textual resources such as the local magazine Spı̀tta,
that closely follow conventions adopted in Italian, aiming to be familiar to the speakers of the language.
This non-standardization of the orthography leads to variations in the transcription of the same words.

In addition, we find that the word segmentation in our collected narratives follows more the concept
of a phonological word. As a result, words that are segmented in the UoI corpus, in our narratives are
often fused in a single token. The most common case that also appears in both Italian and Greek, is the
contraction of prepositions and subsequent articles, such as the Italian alla or the Greek στη (sti) ‘to
the.Fem’. Other examples of word fusion that is not permitted in either Italian or Greek but appear in our
narratives are nouns and possessive pronouns, or adverbs with other adverbs or prepositions. A direct
result of this phenomenon is that annotating such tokens with single POS tags does not capture all of the
necessary information.

Therefore, we chose to annotate such words with multiple POS-tags, effectively making our tag dic-
tionary the superset of the universal tagset. The final tags that appear in practice in our corpus, and their
respective frequencies, are listed in Table 2. Examples of fused words and their glosses and associated
tags are shown in Table 3.

gloss: to-the.Fem.SG mother-your.SG there-down have-COMP put-her on-her
translation: ‘to the’ ‘your mother’ ‘down there’ ‘will’ ‘put her’ ‘on her’

Table 3: Examples of fused types that receive multiple tags in our annotation. The first example is a
common preposition-determiner contraction, while the second and last example denote the common
fusion of pronouns that follow nouns or adverbs. Notice the doubled consonants in the second and fourth
instance, due to raddoppiamento fonosintattico.

Phonosyntactic Gemination One important difference is that the UoI corpus explicitly annotates the
phenomenon of raddoppiamento fonosintattico (phonosyntactic gemination, or doubling of the initial
consonant of the word in certain contexts) with a hyphen that separates the two words. The transcriptions
that we collected do not mark for this phenomenon. The two words are often fused into a single token, and
the doubling is not always present. For example, both following types appear in our corpus: aderfòmmu
and aderfòmu ‘my brother’.

Furthermore, the UoI corpus also uses apostrophes to mark word boundaries within which the rad-
doppiamento fonosintattico takes place. The use of apostrophes in our collected narratives is more loose.
They are used both to mark elision/apocope, stress, as well as what it seems to be instances of raddoppi-
amento fonosintattico. This poses further issues that are discussed in the next paragraph.

Code Switching There are three languages present in the region of Salento: the regional variety of
Italian, the Italo-Romance dialect of Salentino, and Griko.5 In modern day all members of the Griko
community are bilingual or trilingual. The generations before the Second World War are considered
to have been predominantly monolingual, and our narratives were collected at that time, around the
beginning of the 20th century. However, elements of Salentino do appear in the narratives, either as
passing words, or as full sentences, mostly in dialogue turns. Note that resources on Salentino are also
extremely scarce if not non-existent.

In order to deal with such examples, we decided to distinguish two scenarios. Tag switching or intra-
sentential switching instances were fully annotated. So, any Salentino words or phrases that appear within
a Griko sentence, are used for training and evaluation. However, in the few cases where we encounter
full sentences in Salentino, we opt to not use them for training or evaluation. Such sentences are marked
with distinctive tags in the released corpus. Note that the UoI corpus does not include any non-Griko
words or phrases. An extensive study of the code-switching phenomena that occur in our corpus is left
for future work.

The following is an example of usage of a Salentino phrase (italicized) within a Griko sentence, taken
from story 4. Note that there exists a Griko word for ‘olive oil’, namely alài or alàdi, as well words for
‘good’, namely kalòn or brao. However, the Salentino phrase oju finu ‘fine oil’ is chosen:

leo ti vastò oju finu
say-1SG COMP hold-1SG oil fine
V C V N Adj
‘I say that I have good olive oil’

Tokenization The UoI corpus has been carefully crafted to make sure that word boundaries are clearly
denoted by spaces or hyphens. This unfortunately is not the case in our collected narratives. The “loose”
use of apostrophes complicates the work of the tokenizer. We chose to tokenize all apostrophes as a single
token, except for the cases of known elisions that were present in previous corpora, such as the case of
the conjunction c’ (ce) ‘and’. In addition, in the manually annotated test set, the linguists corrected any
clear tokenization issues regarding the apostrophe.

2533

Stress Marking In the UoI corpus, all words with two or more syllables have a diacritic mark to
indicate the location of stress. However, the resources that we collected are not consistent in the use of
such a diacritic. Its use is, besides, not standardized and not well studied. Although in most cases such a
diacritic is used, there are several instances of polysyllabic words that have no stress marks.

2.2 Metadata

We further provide as much information as possible for each narrative, in the form of metadata. This
includes the original url of the narrative, the title of the narrative in Griko and its translation in Italian.
Whenever they were reported (more than 95% of the narratives) we include the location where the narra-
tive was collected, and we anticipate that further analysis could possibly reveal any regional variations.
The vast majority of the stories were naturally collected in Calimera, the largest village and the center of
the Griko community, but the resource also includes 10 stories collected in Martano, as well as stories
collected in Corigliano and Martignano, two smaller villages. We also include information about the date
that a story was collected, as well as the narrator of the story. There are a total of 37 different narrators,
while the 10 stories from Martano were retrieved from anonymous manuscripts. There are also 11 stories
where the narrator is not known. Two thirds of the stories were narrated by women, while 15% of the
narrators were male. The oldest manuscript dates back to 1883, while the most recent story was collected
in 1998. We hope that this additional information will further allow us to investigate morphosyntactic
phenomena in relation to their temporal or location context, but this is left as future work.

3 Related Work

POS tagging is a very well studied problem; probabilistic models like Hidden Markov Models and Con-
ditional Random Fields (CRF) were initially proposed (Lafferty et al., 2001; Toutanova et al., 2003), with
neural network approaches taking over in recent years (Mikolov et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2015).

The use of parallel data for projecting POS tag information across languages was introduced by
Yarowsky and Ngai (2001), and further improved at a large scale by Das and Petrov (2011) who used
graph-based label propagation to expand the coverage of labeled tokens. Täckström et al. (2013) used
high-quality alignments to construct type and token level dictionaries. In the neural realm, Zhang et al.
(2016) used only a few word translations in order to train cross-lingual word embeddings, using them
in an unsupervised setting. Fang and Cohn (2017), on the other hand, used parallel dictionaries of 20k
entries along with 20 annotated sentences.

Most of the previous approaches are rarely tested on under-represented languages, with research on
POS tagging for endangered languages being sporadic. Ptaszynski and Momouchi (2012), for example,
presented an HMM-based POS tagger for the extremely endangered Ainu language, based on dictionar-
ies, 12 narratives (yukar), using one annotated story (200 words) for evaluation. To our knowledge, no
other previous work has extensively tested several approaches on an actual endangered language.

The lack of high quality annotated data led to approaches that attempt to use monolingual resources in
a semi-supervised setting. Notably, Garrette and Baldridge (2013) used about 200 annotated sentences
along with monolingual corpora improving the accuracy of an HMM-based model. They tested their
model on two low-resource African languages, Kinyarwanda and Malagasy and they found that in this
time-constrained scenario type-level annotation leads to slightly higher improvements than token-level
annotation, increasing the accuracy of their taggers to slightly less than 80%. Similar conclusions were
reached in Garrette et al. (2013): 4 hours of annotation are more wisely spent if annotating at the type-
level, provided there exist additional raw monolingual data. This line of work adequately addressed the
question of what labeled data are preferable when there is (exceptionally) restricted access to annotators.

However, language documentation neither is nor needs to be restricted to such minimal amounts of
annotation work. In addition, recently proposed endangered language documentation frameworks (Bird
et al., 2014b) advocate the collection of translations (Bird et al., 2014a) which render the resource inter-
pretable. In the case of our resource, we argue that the translations are enough for providing type-level
supervision. Possibly, this is only feasible because the two languages belong in the same family and have
been in contact for centuries, so care needs to be taken with the application of this claim.

4 Part-of-Speech Tagging

First, we construct a mapping of the tags of the UoI corpus to the Universal Part-of-Speech tagset (Petrov
et al., 2012). This mapping is available as part of the complementary material of our resource.

Starting with the tagged UoI corpus, we can use several methods to train a tagger, which we use as
baselines. We use the Stanford Log-linear POS-tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003) (henceforth stanford),
trained and tested with the default settings. We also test a simple feature-based CRF tagger (henceforth
crf), using the implementation of the nltk toolkit (Bird and Loper, 2004). We extended the implemen-
tation to also use prefix and suffix features of up to 4 characters, along with bigram and trigram features.6

We will refer to this method as crf-mod.
Finally, we also investigate the use of a simple neural model. It uses a single bi-LSTM layer to encode

the input sentence, and it outputs tags after a fully connected layer applied on the output of the recurrent
encoder, as was described in Lample et al. (2016). The model is implemented in DyNet7 (Neubig et
al., 2017), with input embedding and hidden sizes of 128, and output (tag) embedding size of 32. It is
trained with the Adam optimizer with an initial learning rate of 0.0002 and for a maximum of 50 epochs.
We select the best model based on the performance on a small dev set of 40 sentences that we sampled
randomly from the training set.

The tagging performance of all methods is shown in the first column of Table 4. We find that the
crf-mod model is the best baseline model. With such few data to train on, both the crf and the
neural model do not perform well. The bi- and tri-gram features that the crf-mod model uses are
very sparse, while the neural model has to deal with a very large number of unknown words, as
discussed below in the Analysis subsection.

In line with previous work, we find that semi-supervised training achieves better results in such low-
resource settings. We exploit all the narratives that we collected by treating them as an additional mono-
lingual corpus, used in the framework proposed by Garrette and Baldridge (2013). This approach (hence-
forth G&B) significantly improves upon all baselines, achieving an accuracy of 71.67% in the test set, an
improvement of more than 4 percentage points.

Cross-lingual projected tags So far, our results have not used the Italian translations of our resource.
We can follow a procedure similar to the one of Täckström et al. (2013), and extract word alignments
from the Griko-Italian parallel data of the training set. We use a pre-trained Italian tagger8 in order to
tag the Italian side, and we map those tags to the universal tagset. We can then project the tags of the
Italian tokens to the aligned Griko ones.9 For the cross-lingual projected tags, we found that in practice

6Our extensions will be submitted to the nltk codebase.
7We will make the code available online.

9The type-level projections are also provided with the Supplementary Material.

type-level predictions work better, and thus we only report results with such models. The tags of the
Italian side of our resource, the Griko-Italian alignments, and the cross-lingual POS projections on Griko
types are available through the complementary material of our resource.

Augmenting the training set with the type-level projected tags (clp in Table 4), we achieve improve-
ments for all models, except crf-mod. The crf-mod method uses sparser features and is more prone
to errors due to the noise of the projections. The best performance is achieved when we combine the
projected tags, as type-level supervision, with the G&B method that leverages monolingual data. Their
combination achieves the best overall performance, with an accuracy of 72.9%, a significant improve-
ment over all other methods. As far as we know, this is the first time that cross-lingual projected tags are
combined with the method of Garrette and Baldridge (2013).

Transduction An additional approach that needs to be studied is the transductive approach. Since we
have translations both for the training and the test sets, we can extract word alignments and project POS
tags also for the test set. The results of the transductive approach using cross-lingual projected tags from
all the data that we have are shown in the third column of Table 4 (under clp-all).

We find that most methods benefit from the transductive approach, with the stanford and crf
methods exhibiting minimal improvements, while the neuralmethod improves significantly by about 5
percentage points as now there are even less out-of-vocabulary words in the input. The crf-modmethod
improves over the UoI+clp version, but still does not surpass the UoI only version. The only method
that does not benefit from the transduction setting is the G&B method, where the performance drops.

An additional transductive step that can be taken with the G&B method is to also add the test set as part
of the monolingual data that it uses. However, including the test set in the monolingual data also resulted
in a drop in performance. Using all monolingual data along with the train-only cross-lingual types (clp)
leads to accuracy around 69.9% (a drop of 3 points from the best model), while using all monolingual
data with clp-all leads to a drop of another 1.4 points, to an accuracy of only 68.5%, which however
is still better than all other taggers. These accuracy drops are probably justifiable, since G&B was not
developed under a transductive assumption.

Analysis It is worth noting that our choice of using combined tags for fused/contracted words means
that our training sets, under all settings, do not contain all tags that we encounter in the test set. The
tagset of the UoI corpus only had 14 tags (the 12 universal ones plus P+D and C+Pr), indicative of its
small size. As more narratives were annotated, the size of the necessary tagset increased to the final 29.
However, the additional tags that we had to use are rather rare and do not severely affect the performance
of our models. The tags that are present in the UoI corpus in fact account for 96.7% of all target tags in
the test set, a value that could be considered as a skyline for all methods.

The explanation of our models’ performance lies in vocabulary coverage. The UoI corpus only in-
cludes 46.6% of the test set tokens (8.9% of the test set types). The augmented training set with type-
level projections increases those numbers to 48.7% of test tokens and 14.8% of test types. Even though
we restrict ourselves to high quality alignments,10 we are able to project tags to 3870 types (3911 in
the transductive scenario), an amount higher than the amount of tags that a trained linguist can produce
within four hours of annotation (Garrette et al., 2013).

The G&B method deals with the vocabulary coverage issue by introducing a tag dictionary expansion
as a first step. They use a label propagation algorithm —Modified Adsorption (Talukdar and Crammer,
2009)— in order to spread labels between related items. In our framework, the cross-lingual projected
tags provide labels for a subset of the types, in a way similar that an annotator would, partially alleviating
the difficulty of the method’s first step. This leads to less noise in the created tag dictionary, leading to
increased accuracy. Note that, out of the cross-lingual projected tags that correspond to types that appear
in the test set (about 10% of the test set types, in the no transduction setting), more than 65% were
correctly projected.

10An alignment is used if either its probability is 1, or its probability is higher than 0.9 and the frequency of both tokens is
higher than 5. Relaxing those conditions leads to worse performance due to noise.

Table 5: Tagging accuracy for each test narrative with and without active learning. We obtain significant
improvements (shown in the ∆ column) by adding each annotated narrative to the training set before
retraining and tagging the next narrative. The last two columns further outline the improvements from
active learning, showing performance on the last and longest narrative of the test set (story-9) in each
iteration, also showing the best method in each iteration. The impact of using monolingual data and
type-level cross-lingual projections disappears when more training data are available.

5 Active learning

We further explored the use of active learning while tagging our test set. Our active learning scheme is as
follows: We first sorted the test set narratives according to length, and starting only with the UoI corpus,
we trained all taggers, producing annotations for the first story of the test set. After the corrections on the
annotation of each narrative were completed, it was added as gold training data and the taggers were re-
trained. For each subsequent story, the linguists were provided with the output of the tagger that achieved
the highest accuracy in the previous iteration.

The main reason why we decided to follow this narrative-level active learning scheme instead of
collecting type-level annotations is that a noisy corpus is not very helpful for linguistics research; at least
some part of the resource should have to be checked for quality and accuracy by hand. In addition, the
translations of the narratives can provide such information, as we already showed in the previous section.
As we expand the coverage of our POS annotations over the whole corpus, we will explore other methods
for selecting the types or sentences to be annotated through an active learning scheme.

The results, per narrative, with and without active learning, in the order that they were annotated by our
linguists (from the shortest narrative to the longest) are outlined in Table 5. The results for each narrative
in the active learning scenario (“with AL” column) report the best performing model that is trained on
the concatenation of the UoI corpus and all the stories that were annotated in previous iterations. It is
clear that the performance of the taggers improved continuously, as we added more training data. This is
further outlined by each iteration’s tagging accuracy on story 9, the last and longest narrative of the test
set. Of course, when a narrative is added in the training set, it is then excluded from the test set, and the
performance is reported on the rest of the narratives.

All methods display notable improvement as we added the annotated narratives to the training set. The
performance trends are outlined in Figure 1. Firstly, it is notable that as the training set increases, the
advantage of the model of Garrette and Baldridge (2013) that leverages monolingual data diminishes,
compared to our simpler crf-mod tagger, both with or without cross-lingual projected tags. Before the
first iteration, the accuracy gap is 6.4 percentage points in favor of G&B. However, after adding around
4-5 narratives so that there are around 500 training sentences, our crf-mod+clp method surpasses the
G&B method and keeps improving. This is also outlined by the dashed line in Table 5. As we add more
training instances, the accuracy of the G&B method plateaus around 85% and does not improve further.

Figure 1: Accuracy on the (remaining) test set as we add annotated narratives to the training set. All
methods benefit from the active learning approach, with G&B displaying better performance due to its
use of monolingual data in the first iterations, but the crf-mod approach achieving the best results in
the last iterations, eventually not even needing the cross-lingual type-level projections (+clp).

Furthermore, after a couple more iterations, when more than 800 annotated sentences are available
for training, the crf-mod method without cross-lingual projected tags achieves higher accuracy than
all others. We identify this point as the one where simple token-level supervision is efficient enough to
outperform semi-supervised or transfer-learning approaches.

Finally, we observe that the accuracy of the neural bi-LSTM approach that only uses the tagged
corpus without further use of monolingual data, improves significantly as the training set increases. With
only 370 training sentences, the gap between the neural and the best method is more than 14 percentage
points. With 1,100 training sentences, the accuracy gap diminishes to only 2 percentage points.

6 Cross-Validation

Our end goal is to annotate the whole corpus with POS tags, as well as richer annotations. Towards that
direction, our gold annotated test data could be used to train a higher quality POS tagger, which we
will use to annotate the rest of the corpus. In Section §5, we found that including all but one annotated
narratives for training, and testing on the last one (story-9) we were able to obtain an accuracy of more
than 94.17%. In order to get a better estimation of how well a tagger trained on our gold data would
work, we perform a cross-validation experiment, using crf-mod, our best performing model.

For each cross-validation instance, one of the annotated narratives becomes the test set, and the rest
will be included in the training set. This allows us to obtain an average performance over 10 instances.
The average accuracy of the crf-mod model is about 91.9%, with a standard deviation of about 2
percentage points (minimum is 88.5% on story 5, and maximum is 94.9% on story 2).

The main obstacle to annotating the rest of the corpus with higher quality is out-of-vocabulary words.
The combined vocabulary of the UoI corpus and our 10 annotated narratives covers 16% of the vocabu-
lary of the 104 unannotated sentences (but 85% of the total tokens). As part of our future work, we plan
to incorporate word-level active learning in our annotation/correction scheme, similar to the approaches
proposed by Fang and Cohn (2017).

7 Conclusion

We presented a parallel corpus of 114 narratives on an endangered language, Griko, with translations in
Italian. For now, a test set of 10 narratives is hand-annotated with Part-of-Speech tags, but in the future
we will enrich the resource with annotations on the rest of the corpus, as well as with richer syntactic
and morphological annotations. We also plan on contributing our corpus to the Universal Dependencies
treebanks (Nivre et al., 2016) as Griko is absent from the supported languages.

We extensively evaluated several POS tagging approaches, and found that the method of Garrette and
Baldridge (2013) can be combined with cross-lingual type-level projected tags, outperforming all other
methods, with an accuracy of 72.9%, when less than 500 sentences are available. As data was added in the
training set in an active learning scenario, a simple feature-based CRF approach outperforms all other
models, with accuracy improvements of over 21 percentage points and over 94% accuracy on the last
narrative. In fact, when more than 800 sentences are available for training, cross-lingual tag projections
hurt performance.

The collected annotations from our test set could form the basis for training a high-accuracy POS
tagger for Griko, so that we can expand the POS annotations to the rest of our corpus with only a small
amount of noise. We aim to explore this direction in our future work, along with other active learning
methods that require less human intervention. In addition, we plan to further enrich the annotations of
our corpus with morphological tags similar to the UoI corpus, that will provide even more insight in
Griko and its usage. When the full annotations of the corpus are completed, we plan to use statistical
methods to study specific phenomena regarding the grammar and syntax of Griko.

Finally, and most importantly, we hope that the release of this corpus will spark further interest for
computational approaches applied on endangered languages documentation and on under-represented
languages in general.
