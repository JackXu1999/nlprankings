Abstract

Persuasion is rarely achieved through a loose set of arguments alone. Rather, an effective delivery
of arguments follows a rhetorical strategy, combining logical reasoning with appeals to ethics and
emotion. We argue that such a strategy means to select, arrange, and phrase a set of argumentative
discourse units. In this paper, we model rhetorical strategies for the computational synthesis of
effective argumentation. In a study, we let 26 experts synthesize argumentative texts with different
strategies for 10 topics. We find that the experts agree in the selection significantly more when
following the same strategy. While the texts notably vary for different strategies, especially their
arrangement remains stable. The results suggest that our model enables a strategical synthesis.

1 Introduction

The primary use of arguments in natural language is to persuade others of a stance towards a controversial
topic (Mercier and Sperber, 2011). According to Johnson and Blair (2006), an argument is logically cogent
if its premises are relevant as support for its conclusion, individually acceptable, and together sufficient to
draw the conclusion. In real life, however, argumentation is by far not only about logic (Allwood, 2016).
Without a rhetorical strategy, arguments will hardly ever unfold their persuasive effectiveness.

Following Aristotle (2007), we see a rhetorical strategy as the purposeful encoding of three means
of persuasion in a well-arranged and well-phrased speech or text: logos (providing logically reasoned
arguments), ethos (demonstrating good character and credibility), and pathos (evoking the right emotions).
Listeners or readers then decode the encoding, forming their view of the author’s logos, ethos, and pathos.
In the realm of the area of computational argumentation, rhetorical strategies are particularly relevant for
technologies that synthesize argumentative text and that aim to deliver arguments effectively.

Existing argument mining research largely focuses on the logical structure of arguments, identifying
their units (premises vs. conclusions) and relations (support vs. attack). Recently, a few studies have tackled
strategy-related aspects, such as explicit expressions of ethos (Duthie et al., 2016) and the effects of logical
and emotional arguments across audiences (Lukin et al., 2017). So far, however, strategies have not been
considered in argumentation synthesis, which altogether has not received much attention (see Section 2).

In this paper, we study the role of rhetorical strategies when synthesizing argumentation. In particular,
we consider monological argumentative texts where an author seeks to persuade target readers of his or her
stance towards a given topic, such as news editorials and persuasive essays. Conceptually, we argue that
an author synthesizes a text of such genres in three subsequent steps:

1. Selecting content in terms of argumentative discourse units (along with facts, anecdotes, and similar)
that frame the given topic in a way that is effective for the intended stance,

2. arranging the structure of the units considering ordering preferences, and

3. phrasing the style of the resulting text to match the genre and the encoded means of persuasion.

We expect that the encoding of the means of persuasion becomes manifest in measurable text properties
related to selection, arrangement, and phrasing. Figure 1 sketches the analysis of such properties in a

I have a very distinct memory from my first day of college: My 
family's minivan slowly pulling into my dormitory's parking lot, 
through a crowd of first-year students flanked by helicopter parents 
and, in retrospect, probably hungover orientation week advisers. I 
remember thinking "Hurry up! I'm ready to start my real life."

I had no idea what I was really rushing towards.

As the only daughter of Nigerian immigrants with a tenuous-at-best 
toehold on the middle class, college was billed as the only path to 
financial security.   "No one can ever take away your education," my 
father would say repeatedly.   While that may be true, two degrees 
later someone could take away my access to decent housing because 
of my shit credit, thanks to the nearly $60,000 in student loans I've 
essentially defaulted on since graduating from the University of 
Chicago and Northwestern University.

It seems a college education is part of the American dream that's 
easy to buy (or borrow) into, but hard to pay off.

With tuition soaring, and the middle class shrinking along with their 
incomes, many students and their families are left holding incredibly 
expensive bags. In 2013, 69% of graduating seniors at public and 
private nonprofit colleges took out student loans to pay for college, 
and "about one-fifth of new graduates' debt was in private loans [...]"

pathos and ethos-oriented news editorial. Thereby, it also hints at our envisioned computational model
of rhetorical strategies. We discuss this model and its application when synthesizing an argumentative
text following a particular rhetorical strategy in Section 3. In Section 4, we design a dataset for studying
argumentation synthesis with 200 argumentative discourse units for 10 pairs of topic and stance from the
Arg-Microtexts corpus (Peldszus and Stede, 2016). To evaluate the adequacy of the general synthesis
process reflected by our model, we then carry out an experiment where 26 human experts select, arrange,
and re-phrase short argumentative texts following principled rhetorical strategies, thereby also creating
benchmark data for computational approaches (Section 5).

We find that humans agree significantly more when selecting argumentative discourse units to encode
specific means of persuasion, and we observe clear differences between strategies. At the same time, the
arrangement of the texts remains stable across strategies. Their phrasing requires further investigation in
future work. The results suggest that our model captures both general and strategy-specific aspects of syn-
thesizing argumentation. As such, it defines a first substantial step towards computational argumentation
synthesis following rhetorical strategies. In total, our main contributions are:

1. A computational model of rhetorical strategies for synthesizing monological argumentative texts.

2. A benchmark dataset with manually synthesized arguments that follow rhetorical strategies.

3. Empirical evidence that humans agree in strategy-specific argumentation synthesis.

2 Related Work

Aristotle (2007) revealed that persuasion is achieved through a well-arranged speech with a clear and
appropriate style that delivers an adequate mix of the three means of persuasion: (1) logos, the use
of logically reasoned arguments, (2) ethos, the demonstration of the speaker’s credibility and good
character, and (3) pathos, the evoking of the right emotions in the target audience. As Aristotle, we target
argumentation that aims for persuasion — as opposed to critical discussions where strategic maneuvering
is needed to achieve reasonableness (van Eemeren et al., 2014). Jovičić (2006) proposed a procedure to
evaluate the effectiveness of persuasive argumentation, though not in a computational way.

In natural language processing, most computational argumentation research focuses on the mining of
argumentative units and relations from text (Stab and Gurevych, 2014; Peldszus and Stede, 2015; Ajjour
et al., 2017). Argument mining infers the logical structure of arguments, but it does not analyze the
strategy used to compose arguments. Feng and Hirst (2011) classify the five most common argumentation
schemes of Walton et al. (2008). Such a scheme defines a pattern capturing the logical inference from an



3755

argument’s premises to its claim, i.e., it primarily aims at logos only. Song et al. (2014) combine the idea
of schemes with strategy-related considerations, and Habernal and Gurevych (2015) annotate pathos in
forum comments and blog posts. Likewise, Duthie et al. (2016) develop a corpus and an approach to mine
explicit expressions of ethos from political debates, whereas Hidey et al. (2017) even annotate all three
means of persuasion for the premises of arguments. The provided data and methods may be helpful for
studying persuasive effectiveness, but they have not been employed so far for that purpose.

In (Wachsmuth et al., 2016), we use the output of argument mining to assess four quality dimensions
of persuasive essays. Some assessed dimensions relate to rhetoric, such as argument strength, which is
defined based on how many readers are persuaded. Habernal and Gurevych (2016) examine the reasons
that make arguments convincing, and Lukin et al. (2017) study how effective logos-oriented and pathos-
oriented arguments are depending on the target audience. However, none of these works considers the
application of rhetorical strategies.

Tan et al. (2016) find that the chance to persuade someone in good-faith discussions on Reddit Change
My View is increased through multiple interactions and an appropriate linguistic style. Cano-Basave and He
(2016) analyze the impact of the semantic framing of arguments (e.g., “taking sides” and “manipulation”)
in political debates. Similarly, Wang et al. (2017) reveal the importance of selecting the right framing of a
discussion topic for winning classical debates. In such dialogical situations, the arguments of opposing
parties are usually fragmented into several alternating parts. Our work, in contrast, analyzes the rhetorical
strategies of complete monological texts where an author presents his or her entire argumentation.

Studying persuasive blog posts, Anand et al. (2011) develop a scheme with 16 persuasion tactics of four
types: those that postulate outcomes of an uptake, those that generalize in some way, those that appeal to
external authorities, and those that rely on interpersonal factors. These tactics are found in small text spans
and could be seen as the local counterpart of the global strategies we consider. To our knowledge, only
we have explicitly worked towards a computational analysis of such strategies so far. In particular, we
presented a corpus with 300 news editorials whose units are labeled with their roles in the argumentation,
such as “testimony” and “common ground” (Al-Khatib et al., 2016). In (Al-Khatib et al., 2017), we then
trained a classifier on this corpus to find sequential role patterns in 30k New York Times editorials. While
we observed insightful variances in the use of evidence across editorial topics, it still remains unclear to
what extent such patterns really reflect rhetorical strategies.

Clearly diverging from previous research, we consider rhetorical strategies in argumentation synthesis,
for which related work is generally still scarce. Bilu and Slonim (2016) generate new claims by recycling
topics and predicates from existing claims, whereas Reisert et al. (2015) synthesize complete arguments
based on the model of Toulmin (1958) where a claim is supported by data that is reasoned by a warrant.
Like us, those authors rely on a pool of argument units from which arguments are built. However, they
restrict their view to logical argument structure. The same holds for Green (2017) who generates arguments
with particular schemes (e.g., “cause to effect”) that are used to teach learners how to argue.

Yanase et al. (2015) present a method that arranges the sentences of an argumentative text in a natural
way. Sato et al. (2015) build upon this method. Their system pursues similar goals as we do, phrasing an
ordered text with multiple arguments. We extend their idea by rhetorical considerations, and we propose a
general argumentation synthesis model. It is in line with classical concepts of building natural language
generation systems (Reiter and Dale, 1997), but it targets argumentative texts in particular. With that, we
seek to contribute a missing aspect to technologies that synthesize arguments such as The Debater (Rinott
et al., 2015), namely, how to deliver arguments effectively. So far, strategical systems exist only for formal
argumentation (Rosenfeld and Kraus, 2016).

Our synthesis-oriented model covers content, structure, and style properties. For computational pur-
poses, such properties need to be mined before. To capture content, some works identify the different
frames under which a topic can be viewed (Naderi and Hirst, 2017), model key aspects of a topic (Menini
et al., 2017), or analyze potentially strategy-related topic patterns in campaign speeches (Gautrais et al.,
2017). In terms of structure, Persing et al. (2010) learn sequences of discourse functions in essays (e.g.,
“rebuttal” or “conclusion”) that correlate with a good organization, and we have modeled flows of arbitrary
types of information to classify text properties, such as stance or quality (Wachsmuth and Stein, 2017).



3756

In (Wachsmuth et al., 2017), we extend this idea to model sequential and hierarchical argumentation
structure simultaneously. Regarding style, Lawrence et al. (2017) analyze rhetorical figures in arguments,
Song et al. (2017) classify discourse modes in essays, and Zhang et al. (2017) study rhetorical questions
in political discourse. All such methods may be relevant when we operationalize our model.

Finally, the use of strategies in synthesis scenarios follows up on early work on discourse planning
(Young et al., 1994; Zukerman et al., 2000). The computational approaches relied on rule-based techniques
to create effective arguments (Carenini and Moore, 2006) for a few selected tactics. More recent
research on general text generation uses probabilistic models to employ text structure (Barzilay, 2010), or
synthesizes texts such that they have a certain style in terms of sentiment or similar (Hu et al., 2017; Shen
et al., 2017). Our model is meant to provide an abstract framework to be exploited in such approaches.

3 Model

We now delineate our model of rhetorical strategies for synthesizing a monological argumentative text
following a specified rhetorical strategy. As clarified below, its three main building blocks follow Aristotle
(2007). While we do not operationalize the model computationally in this paper, we will study its general
adequacy with human experts in Section 5. An instance of the model has been given in Figure 1.

3.1 Argumentation Synthesis following Rhetorical Strategies
Given a controversial topic or question (such as “Does college edu help financial security?” in Figure 1)
and a stance towards it (such as “con”), the goal of a rhetorical strategy can be seen as delivering arguments
along with facts, anecdotes, etc. to persuade some target audience of the intended stance in an effective
way. In line with Aristotle (2007), we hypothesize that such a strategy can be manifested in a monological
argumentative text through a purposeful encoding of the three means of persuasion (see Section 2). i.e.,
logos, ethos, and pathos. An instance of a strategy (which is tailored to a specific target audience) thus
specifies to what degree each means should be present, such as logos 70%, ethos 10%, pathos 20%.1

For giving a persuasive speech, Aristotle (2007) postulates five consecutive canons of rhetoric: (1) in-
ventio, the selection of arguments, (2) dispositio, the arrangement of the arguments to achieve maximum
impact, (3) elocutio, the phrasing of the arguments in a clear and appropriate style, (4) memoria, the mem-
orization of the speech, and (5) actio, the delivery of the speech with gestures, prosody, and further means.
Since we focus on written argumentation, the latter two are obsolete in the given context. Accordingly,
we model a rhetorical strategy for synthesizing monological argumentative texts as a process of the three
steps mentioned in Section 1: selecting content, arranging structure, and phrasing style.

Technically, we regard a strategy as a script of operators from a set Ω = Ωs ∪ Ωa ∪ Ωp, where Ωs are
select operators, Ωa are arrange operators, and Ωp are phrase operators. These operators can be combined
to form complex, nested n-ary operations on a set of input units. We expect that an applied strategy
becomes manifest in measurable text properties at different granularity levels, ranging from single words
and phrases over argumentative units and complete arguments, up to the full argumentation in a text. The
identification of the best properties is beyond the scope of this paper, but the box in the lower right corner
of Figure 1 summarizes an exemplary overall manifestation of a pathos and ethos-oriented strategy: The
author focuses on the financial impact of college education to support her stance against it. She rebuts
existing views, before she states her thesis and provides evidence, all in a personal evaluation.2

For a concrete operationalization of the model, the input to the operators may be pre-fabricated text units
(roughly: clauses corresponding to single propositions), semantic representations in a suitable formalism
(as in the case of classical “deep” text generation), or some intermediate form like partially-analyzed
text units, where information about syntax, named entities, etc. is available. In line with the experiment
reported in Section 5, we here assume that a set of candidate text units, which we call the pool, is available
to make informed selections. Ideally, the units have been analyzed for (1) means of persuasion present,
(2) stance on the topic, (3) framing of the topic, and (4) effectiveness when functioning in an argument.

1Also, a rhetorical strategy will have to consider conventions of the intended text genre (news editorial, persuasive essay,
etc.), but we leave that aside for present purposes.

2The distinction of content, structure, and style may not be perfectly orthogonal in all cases, which is rooted in the complexity
and polythetic nature of natural language. Notice in this regard that all labels depicted in Figure 1 are exemplary only.



3757

3.2 Selecting the Content (Inventio)
The first step of synthesizing argumentation is to decide on those frames under which to view a topic that
support the intended stance best, while matching the desired means of persuasion (as specified by the
strategy). In accordance with these decisions, a set of units is to be selected from the pool. For instance,
the editorial in Figure 1 frames college education in terms of its financial benefits and drawbacks, among
other frames. A different strategy could put the focus on the freedom of career choice. When making
the selection, facts, anecdotes, and similar statements may be added to the arguments, particularly to
demonstrate credibility or to evoke emotions (if the strategy favors ethos or pathos, respectively). In
Figure 1, we find a personal anecdote in the beginning, whereas the last paragraph gives statistical and
testimonial evidence. Technically, the set Ωs will contain operators of two types:

frames : select(topic, stance, strategy) units : select(frames, strategy)

To establish the knowledge base behind Ωs, a preceding corpus analysis will be needed, which associates
frames and units for topic-stance combinations with information about their persuasive effectiveness
and the encoded means of persuasion. As summarized in Section 2, several computational techniques
to implement various steps of this analysis have been proposed, such as unit segmentation (Ajjour et al.,
2017), frame classification (Naderi and Hirst, 2017), and key aspect clustering (Menini et al., 2017).

3.3 Arranging the Structure (Dispositio)
Given the units, the next step is to compose the selected units in structured arguments and to sequentially
order them, in a way that maximizes their impact. The financial drawback argument in Figure 1, for
instance, gives the debts from student loans as the premise for the author’s claimed solvency problems.
The resulting argument (pro the intended stance) rebuts the preceding con argument and — probably for
rhetorical reasons — is immediately followed by the main thesis within the sequential flow of the editorial
(indicated by the vertical lines). To illustrate the means of persuasion, an emphasis on pathos could, for
example, lead to a preference for gradually increasing the strength of emotional appeal throughout the
text. In contrast, for a logos-oriented strategy, it may be important that the sequence of units coheres
locally and globally (which for a pathos-oriented argument may be less relevant, or even detrimental).
Technically, we distinguish two types of arrange operators in Ωa:

arguments : arrange(units, strategy) flow : arrange(arguments, strategy)

For executing this step, knowledge about the roles of units in arguments (Stab and Gurevych, 2014) and
about effective flows of text units (Wachsmuth and Stein, 2017) is needed. This script-like knowledge
fuses the information on the means of persuasion and of unit strength on the one hand with principles of
text coherence and rhetorical organization on the other.

3.4 Phrasing the Style (Elocutio)
Finally, the sequence of units is to be presented in an argumentative text, making stylistic decisions, which
in turn are governed by the strategy. The technical approach depends much on the type of “unit” that is
being implemented (see end of Section 3.1). For minimally-analyzed text units, one can add connectives
indicating the relation between units. If deeper analyses are available, it may be possible to use markers
encoding evidence types or discourse modes, among other rhetorical devices. If syntax can be controlled,
then a pathos-oriented argument may prefer relatively flat structures, while a logos-oriented one may lean
towards more complex embedding, inviting the reader to follow the path of reasoning. In the mentioned
pro argument from the editorial, a concession is expressed through the word “while”, indicating that the
con argument is outweighed by the pro argument. A personal anecdote is then given as a sarcastic (“thanks
to”) causal evidence, which is used as a pathos-oriented persuasion attempt. Technically, we thus consider
the set Ωp to be composed of at least two basic types:

sentences : phrase(units, arguments, strategy) text : phrase(sentences, flow, strategy)

Existing techniques to identify the right phrasing operators include evidence type classification (Rinott et
al., 2015; Al-Khatib et al., 2017), discourse mode identification (Song et al., 2017), and others.

Table 1: The 10 questions from the Arg-Microtexts corpus from which we use ADUs for our dataset.

4 Data

This section describes the dataset in terms of a pool of argumentative discourse units that we built in order
to study the adequacy of the proposed model for strategical argumentation synthesis.

4.1 Source Texts of the Argumentative Discourse Units

We decided to work with the English version of the Arg-Microtexts corpus (Peldszus and Stede, 2016),
which was designed to provide crisp argumentation in a “pro and con” manner. The corpus contains 112
short argumentative texts that have been written in response to 18 questions on different controversial
topics. The stance of each text towards the topic is labeled (pro or con). Every text consists of 3 to 10
manually segmented argumentative discourse units (ADUs) with a mean of about 5. ADUs can range
from a single clause to (in principle) multiple sentences, which together contribute a single function to the
argumentative structure. The structure is inspired by the model of Freeman (2011) and allows for linked,
convergent, and serial support, as well as two kinds of attack (rebuttals and undercutters).

From the annotated structure, we can directly derive the thesis of each text (aka the main claim) and,
for each other ADU, the stance that it takes towards this thesis (pro or con). In total, the Arg-Microtexts
corpus contains 576 ADUs (112 theses, 339 pros, and 125 cons).

4.2 Decontextualization of the Argumentative Discourse Units

For our purposes, we need ADUs to be as independent as possible of the context in which they originally
occurred. At this point, the fact that the corpus texts are relatively short and hence free of complex
inter-relationships, becomes helpful. We semi-automatically preprocessed each unit in four steps:

1. Removal of sentence information. We removed all capitalizations of words that were due to sentence
beginnings as well as all sentence delimiters.

2. Removal of unit prefixes. We removed all discourse markers and connectives at unit beginnings. The
top 10 terms were “but” (43 times), “and” (39), “as” (18), “however” (15), “besides” (11), “for” (11),
“also” (1), “that’s why” (10), and “yet” (10). Together, they made up 61% of all removed prefixes.

3. Removal of unit infixes. We removed the following markers within units: “also” (16 times), “however”
(14), “therefore” (10), “hence” and “thus” (3 each), as well as “though” (2).

4. Pronoun resolution. Finally, we resolved all pronouns in the units whose reference was unclear or
ambiguous when given only the question of the respective text. For example, we replaced “they” by
“murderers and rapists” in “the have taken or destroyed another life” from a text on the death penalty.

4.3 A Pool of 200 Argumentative Discourse Units for 10 Controversial Topics

The goal of our study is to imitate the computational synthesis of monological argumentative texts, given a
topic, a stance towards the topic, and a strategy specification. To ensure a reasonably large pool of ADUs
for synthesis for each topic, we restrict our view to the 10 most frequent questions in the Arg-Microtexts
corpus. The number of texts for each of them is listed in Table 1 (controversial topics are marked bold).

Topic Should Germany introduce the death penalty? Stance Con

Table 2: The candidate thesis, con, and pro units for one topic-stance pair from the dataset we provide.

To reduce the bias of the expert’s personal opinions in the study, we use only theses for one stance
towards the respective topic. In particular, we kept only those with the majority stance on the topic,
resulting in at least four theses for each of the 10 topics.3 We kept all other ADUs, but we inverted the
stance of an ADU in case it referred to one of the discarded theses, because, for instance an ADU that is
against a discarded con thesis can be assumed to be in favor of a pro thesis on the same topic.

As a result, we had at least four con and 12 pro units for the four theses on each topic. Additional
units were discarded randomly to end up with an equal number of units for all 10 topics.The resulting
distribution of the unit types matches the desired distribution in the source corpus. We ordered the theses,
con units, and pro units alphabetically (to avoid ordering bias). Table 2 exemplary shows the list of 20
units for one topic. Each such list represents the pool of candidate units for one task in our experiment.4

5 Experiments

We now report on the experiment that we carried out with human experts in order to study whether the
general process of selecting, arranging, and phrasing defined by our model from Section 3 is suitable for a
strategical synthesis of argumentative texts.

5.1 Experimental Set-up for Manual Argumentation Synthesis following Rhetorical Strategies
We hypothesized that humans (1) agree when synthesizing arguments for the same strategy more than for
different ones, and (2) synthesize differently depending on their strategy, especially in terms of selection.

Participants A diverse set of 26 qualified experts participated in the study (10 female, 16 male) with
diverse demographic backgrounds (9 from North America, 11 from Europe, 6 from Asia). 16 came from
groups related to computational linguistics, while the others were writing experts, acquired on upwork.com.
16 had a PhD or master, 7 a bachelor, and 3 a high school degree. No author of this paper participated.

Strategies To emphasize the effects of a strategical synthesis, we consider only two somehow principled
rhetorical strategies, for which we gave the following short intuitions:

3In case of the question “Should shopping malls generally be allowed to open on holidays and Sundays?”, pro and con theses
were balanced (4 each). We chose con, so we ended up with five pro-topic and five con-topic cases in total.

• Logos-oriented. Argue based on logical reasoning, which means to make rational and logical
conclusions towards the intended stance on the given topic.

• Pathos-oriented. Argue based on emotional reasoning, which means to appeal to the emotions of the
reader regarding the topic within your arguments.5

Tasks All participants had to create one short argumentative text for each topic-stance pair, five logos-
oriented and five pathos-oriented texts. Pair-strategy combinations varied across participants, but were
balanced in overall terms. For each pair, the participants first had to select one thesis unit, one con unit,
and three pro units from our pool that they thought could best form a persuasive argument following the
given strategy.6 Then, they had to arrange these five units in the most suitable way they saw. Finally, they
should phrase a coherent text by adding discourse markers and connectives (example terms were given) as
well as punctuation marks before and after each unit. We provided a spreadsheet that made this process as
easy as possible. The participants were not trained in order to avoid biasing them towards our hypotheses.

5.2 Agreement and Differences in Selection, Arrangement, and Phrasing
The results of our experiment is a benchmark dataset with 13 manually synthesized texts for each combi-
nation of topic-stance pair and principled strategy. We provide it at http://arguana.com/data.

Agreement To make strategy differences explicit, Table 3 shows the participants’ agreement in selecting
units and in arranging the three unit types for arguments within each of the two strategies and across
them (“logos to pathos”). Majority agreement is given when over 50% of all participants decided equally
about choosing a unit, and the mean pairwise Cohen’s κ agreement captures the average agreement of two
participants. It is expected that the κ values are low, since various meaningful arguments can be synthesized
for each topic from our pool. Accordingly, other measures such as Fleiss’ κ are not suitable.7

For the selection, the decisive observation is that the κ is much higher within each strategy (e.g., 0.25
for logos and 0.10 for pathos in case of thesis) than across (−0.02). κ differences between each strategy
and across marked with * are significant with at least p < 0.05 (t-test in case of normal distribution,
Wilcoxon test otherwise). This speaks for the truth of Hypothesis 1, i.e., unit selection depends on the
strategy. The majority agreement indicates that, especially for logos-oriented arguments, thesis (59%) and
con (52%) are often selected uniformly. In contrast, the agreement for arrangement is similar within and
across strategies, rather deviating between logos and pathos. We further explore this finding below.

5We told the participants that the two strategies may overlap. Ethos-oriented argumentation was not considered, because the
demonstration of credibility seems hard, given that we required the participants to build arguments from our given pool of units.

6We use units as proxies for frames in the selection, as we do not have information on the exact frames covered by the units.
7High κ values would even be doubtful, because they would imply that the participants often selected exactly the same units,

which would render the potential of our pool of argumentative discourse units questionable.

Table 6: Differences between strategies in the rela-
tive frequency and the rank of the three most com-
mon unit type flows in the synthesized arguments.

For phrasing, we just show in Table 4 to what extent the experts agreed in connecting consecutive unit
types. We assume agreement if the same category of discourse marker or connective was used, distinguish-
ing comparison, contingency, concession, expansion, other, and none. The majority agreement is high in
many cases, while we see systematic κ disagreement. This implies that there were two opposing camps,
although statistical reliability is limited. Quite intuitively, comparison terms (e.g., “although” or “but”)
come often before or after con, whereas consecutive pros usually expand each other (e.g., with “and”).

Differences For brevity, we compare the relative frequencies of selecting each unit in logos-oriented
and pathos-oriented arguments visually in Figure 2. For the theses, we observe clear strategy differences.
For instance, nearly all logos texts on death penalty use t2, whereas the majority selected t1 for pathos
there. In general, the thesis selection seems more uniform for logos. The distribution of con units is rather
similar across strategies for many topics, suggesting that natural candidates to be rebutted exist among
these. Conversely, the stacked bars of the pro units diverge often, as in the case of dog excrements. As
far as our limited unit pool permits, these results support Hypothesis 2, i.e., different strategies lead to
different selections of units and topic frames.

We analyze the arrangement in terms of the distribution of each unit type over the five positions in the
synthesized texts as well as in terms of the resulting sequential unit type flows. As Table 5 reveals, the
distributions are very stable across strategies. About half of all texts begin with the thesis, whereas pro
units rather come at the end. Only for the con units, we see some differences, such as 42% (logos-oriented)
versus 51% (pathos-oriented) at position 2. Accordingly, both strategies yield the same three most common
flows, listed in Table 6, with (thesis, con, pro, pro, pro) at rank 1. We omit significance tests, since these
results rather entail the conclusion that arrangement is not specific to the given strategies.

Strategy # Text Manually Synthesized From Five Argumentative Discourse Units

Logos-oriented t2 Germany should not introduce capital punishment.
c4 Proponents of the death penalty count on its deterring effect as well as and the ultimate elimination of

any potential threat.
p5 However, despite the death penalty there are significantly more homicides in the US than in Germany.
p4 Furthermore, courts are subject to human error.
p9 It turns out time and again that innocent people are convicted and executed.

Pathos-oriented t1 Germany should by no means introduce capital punishment.
c2 Many people think that a murderer has already decided on the life or death of another person.
p2 Still, a door must remain open for making amends.
p6 Every human, even those who have committed a despicable crime, can bring themselves to regret and

change their opinion.
p11 Therefore, no one may have the right to adjudicate upon the death of another human being.

Table 8: Comparison of two selected argumentative texts, one for each strategy, manually synthesized
based on the units from Table 2. The italicized discourse markers have been added by the participants.

Similar holds for the phrasing of argumentative texts, or at least for the given task of adding discourse
markers and connectives. In particular, Table 7 presents the proportion of the most frequent categories of
these. Logos-oriented and pathos-oriented arguments are practically identical in this regard, even the most
often used terms in each category match. Comparisons (especially contrasts with “but”) as well as causal
contingency markers dominate the applied phrasing operators.

Insights Exemplarily, Table 8 compares two arguments against the death penalty synthesized by different
participants, one for each strategy. The theses differ in the emotional load rather than their framing. While
the logos-oriented argument frames death penalty in terms of its potential deterrent effect and the execution
of innocent people, the pathos-oriented puts full emphasis on the ability of humans to regret and change.
The different numbers of frames lead to a slightly different phrasing with discourse markers. Matching
our results, the arrangement of both arguments is the same on the abstraction level of unit types.

6 Conclusion

We propose a general model of synthesizing argumentation following rhetorical strategies in terms of
Aristotle’s means of persuasion: logos, ethos, pathos. The model idealizes the synthesis as the selection,
arrangement, and phrasing of argumentative discourse units (ADUs). Before we develop computational
approaches based on the model, this paper has evaluated its general adequacy in an experiment with
human experts. The results provide evidence that humans agree significantly more when synthesizing
argumentative texts following the same strategy. In addition, we found that the arrangement of the ADUs
and the re-phrasing of their connections is hardly affected by the strategy at all. A study of the phrasing of
the actual units is left to future work. In the long term, we envisage a system that is able to automatically
generate effective argumentation. Such a system requires two main types of resources: (1) a large pool of
decontextualized ADUs covering diverse topics, and (2) a sufficiently flexible set of select, arrange, and
phrase operators along with information about their effectiveness for specific topics and about the means
of persuasion they encode. Given corpora with respective annotations, both resources can be developed
using existing natural language processing techniques. We see this as the next step towards our goal.
