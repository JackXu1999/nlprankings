Abstract 

Developing an automatic tool for educating 

students has become essential in today’s world of 

computerization. For differently abled people, 

especially in India, where the resources are scares 

for educating them, it becomes essential to 

develop such technologies which give the 

opportunity to each and every individual to get the 

education online and free of cost. Research work 

has been done to create HamNoSys notation of 

atleast two words corresponding to each alphabet 

of Punjabi Language. The HamNoSys notation 

when used in JASigning animation tool produces 

the synthetic animation. The synthetic animations 

are better as compared to human videos in terms 

of memory requirement, standardization, and 

flexibility. Synthetic animations can be modified 

as per the requirement whereas the human videos 

cannot be modified. The only drawback that 

seems is, these synthetic animations may lack the 

natural non-manual component of sign. The 

research work has been incorporated to produce 

the web portal that displays the Punjabi alphabet 

along with the picture related to that alphabet and 

the synthetic animation with which that word is 

signed in Indian Sign Language. The work is the 

first of its kind for Indian Sign Language. 

Keywords Indian Sign Language, HamNoSys, 

SiGML, Punjabi Alphabet, Synthetic Animation 

1 Introduction 

Sign language is the visual spatial language 

which is used by the differently abled hearing 
impaired people to communicate. Sign Language 

is the three dimensional language which uses the 

3D space around the signer’s body using its 
hands, arms, body postures, face expressions, 

and head movements.  

Among approximately 7105 known living 

languages worldwide, there are 141 Sign 

Languages depending upon the region in the 

world.  There are nearly 72 million people who 

are hearing impaired among nearly 7 billion 

people on earth. The situation is worst as 90% of  

 

these differently abled people have very limited 

or no access to education and other information. 

[1][2]. 

In India, situation is worse; there are 5072914 

persons who suffer from hearing disability. 

Among them, only 546826 hearing impaired 

persons are literate below primary education [3] 

which accounts for only 10.78%.  

Sign language is different for different 

countries/regions as this language is not created 

but it is evolved by deaf people. So, depending 

on the region, the signs are different as well as 

the grammar is also different depending on the 

region. As far as Indian Sign Language is 

concerned, it is categorized in manual and non-

manual signs which may be static signs or 

dynamic signs. Static signs are those signs which 

do not have any movement in their signs. The 

dynamic signs are those which use the 

movement of the hands, and the non-manual 

features of the sign. Most of the signs used in the 

Sign Language are dynamic signs. 

 

 

Figure 1: ISL Type Hierarchy 

The one handed signs are represented by a single 

dominating hand whereas the two handed signs 

are represented by both the hands of the signer. 

172



Both one handed as well as two handed signs can 

be either static or dynamic (having movements). 

Each of the static and movement signs is further 

classified into manual and non-manual signs. 

Two handed signs with movements can be 
further distinguished as: Type0 and Type1 

signs.Type0 signs are those signs in which both 

the hands are active i.e. both the hands are in 
motion.Type1 signs are those signs in which one 

hand (dominant) is more active as compared to 

the other hand (non-dominant).  

2 Review of Literature 

The education is essential for the good social 

life. The hearing impaired persons also required 

to be educated so that they can communicate 

with each other in their own language as well as 

capable of communicating in their social life. In 

India, various schools are available to impart 

education to these people but these schools are 

limited to only urban areas. Even the number of 

schools is scarce in urban area. A lot of hearing 

impaired persons have no access of education 

and so they are cut off from the society.  

 

A lot of work has been done in implementation 

of sign language dictionary worldwide. 

Dictionaries have been created in the form of 

books which are obsolete in this day and age of 

computerization. Video dictionaries are available 

for sign languages of many countries like 

America, Britain, Australia, Spain, Italy, and 

even India. These video dictionaries can be 

categorized as real character (human being) 

producing the sign or computer generated 

animated character (avatar) producing the sign. 

A lot of Indian sign language dictionaries are 

available which uses the real human being 

producing the sign for an English word. No 

Indian sign language dictionary is available 

which uses computer generated character (ava-

tar) technology.  

 

• The Ramakrishna Mission collaborated with 

CBM International, Germany for a project on 

sign language dictionary in year January 

1999. The goal for the project was to 

standardize Indian Sign Language. On 

November 24, 2001, the first Indian Sign 

Language dictionary was released which 

contains more than 2500 signs. These signs 

were taken from 42 cities in 12 States to 

provide a common sign language all over 

India[4]. The signs in this online dictionary 

are videos of real human English Alphabets 

are also included in the sign dictionary. This 

dictionary does not contains any other 

languages of India even Hindi alphabets are 

not included. 

• Spread the Sign, an international project by 

Leonardo da Vinci supported by the European 

Commission through the Swedish 

International Program Office of Education 

and Training. The goal of this project is to 

share various sign languages from different 

countries over the internet. The drawback of 

this work is that it has videos for the words 

rather than animations which take a long time 

to load as compared to synthetic animations 

[5]. The participation of various countries is 

not upto the mark. 

• Handspeak created is the American Sign 

Language dictionary. The dictionary is 

released on the domain handspeak.com in 

2000. The website contains the ASL signs, 

some variants of ASL signs, some verb inflec-

tions, and more. The dictionary is produced 

and signed by native ASL bilinguals [6].  

• Sign Smith [7] is a 3D illustrated dictionary 

of ASL. It is used as educational software for 

the hearing impaired people of America. It is 

also an authoring tool to create ASL content.  

A lot of work is done in developing the 

dictionaries of sign language of various countries 

but no work has been found in developing the 
dictionary or tutorial for teaching the Punjabi 

(Language of the state Punjab) alphabet. 

3 Punjabi Alphabet 

Punjabi is one of the 22 official languages of 

India which is spoken in the state of Punjab. In 

India, Punjabi is written in Gurmukhi alphabet 
which is composed of vowels, consonants, vowel 

diacritics. 

The vowels and vowel diacritics are known as 

Laga Matra where as consonants are known as 

Vianjans. In Gurmukhi alphabet, there are a total 

of 10 vowels, 10 vowel diacritics and 41 

consonants.

4 Real Vs Synthetic Video Dictionaries 

Translation process from a source language to 

target language requires a bilingual dictionary 

between the source and target languages. In case 

of translating Punjabi text to Indian Sign 

Language, bilingual dictionary of Punjabi word 

and Indian Sign Language is required. Punjabi-

ISL bilingual dictionary is completely different 

from any other bilingual dictionary between the 

spoken languages. The reason behind is that the 

Indian Sign Language is the visual spatial 

language which cannot be spoken or written. So, 

irrespective of bilingual dictionaries of other 

spoken languages, for each Punjabi word, the 

corresponding ISL word is not the written word. 

Here, the Punjabi word’s counterpart in ISL can 

be a real human video, sign picture, coded sign 

language text, or synthetic animation. All the 

approaches have their own pros and cons but the 

synthetic animations are well suited because of 

scalability of computer generated avatar. A 

comparison of all the media used for creating the 

bilingual dictionary of English-SL has been 

given in the following table: 

Table 1: Comparison of Different Media for Representing the Sign 

Kind of Media Pros  Cons 

Video Signs • Realistic 

• Easy to create 

• Time consuming to create 

• High memory consumption 

• Not supported by translation system 

Pictures • Very less memory consumption • Time consuming to create pictures 

• Not realistic as compared to videos 

• Not supported by translation system 

Coded Sign Language 

Text (written form of SL) 
• Minimal Memory consumption 

• Supported by translation system 

as it is the written form and can 

be processed very easily 

• Very difficult to read and 

understand 

• Required to be learnt 

Synthetic Animations • Very less memory consumption 

• Can be easily reproduced 

• Supported by translation system 

• Avatar can be made different 

according to choice 

• Not as realistic as human videos. 

5  HamNoSys Notation 

Sign Language is a three dimensional language 

which cannot be written just like the other 

spoken languages like English, Hindi, Punjabi 

etc. But, researchers have created various writing  

 

notations of sign language. The benefit of 

writing notation is that the translation process 

from a spoken language to sign language 

becomes feasible. Even a writing notation of sign 

language is must for creating the computer 

174



generated character (Avtar) that can be 

just like the human being. Various writing 

notation available for writing the sign language 

are Bébian Notation, Stokoe Notation

Notation, Hamburg Notation System 

(HamNoSys), SignWriting (SW), si5s

SignScript, SLIPA etc. We have used 

HamNoSys notation to create the animation of 

the words related to Punjabi alphabet.

The Hamburg Notation System (HamNoSys) is a 

phonetically based notation system that was 

developed by Siegmund Prillwitz in 1984[8

the institute of German Sign Language, 

University of Hamburg. HamNoSys notation is 

rooted in the Stokoe notation with more detail 

handling the non-manual component of the sign 

also. Around 200 symbols are available in this 

notation system to describe any sign. The 

structure of this notation contains mainly four 

components: Symmetry operator (in case both 

the hands are used), NMF (to describe the non

manual features), Initial Configuration (contains 

in sequence the hand shape, hand orientation, 

and hand location), and Action/Movement (the 

dynamic part or movement of the hands)

The syntax of HamNoSys notation is the 

sequence of symbols of symmetry, non

features, hand features (hand shape, orientation, 

location) and last the hand movements. 

Following figure shows the basic structure of the 

HamNoSys notation. The first component of 

HamNoSys notation is always the symmetric 

operator which is used for two handed signs. The 

second component is for non-manual part of the 

sign such as face expressions, head movement, 

body movement, lips movement (for getting the 

phonetic expression). The third component is for 

hand shape, hand orientation, and hand location. 

The forth component of the notation is the 

movement of the hands in case of dynamic signs.

Following figure shows the basic structure of the 

HamNoSys notation. The first component of 

HamNoSys notation is always the symmetric 

operator which is used for two handed signs. The 

manual part of the 

sign such as face expressions, head movement,

phonetic expression). The third component is for 

hand shape, hand orientation, and hand location. 

tation is the 

movement of the hands in case of dynamic signs.

“Beautiful” 

An advantage of HamNoSys is that it is 

international and can be used to write any Sign 

Language. This notation system was initially 

handwritten, but a machine readable Unicode is 

now available from the University of Hamburg. 

This notation is iconic, has a formal syntax as 

shown above and can be stored in a computer 

database. The limiting part of this notation is that 

it does not provide an easy way to describe non

manual features, such as facial expressions and 

body movements but still the non

produced by using this notation is comparatively 

better than other notations.  

An XML encoding of HamNoSys called Signing 

Gesture Markup Language (SiGML) is also 

available. SiGML encoding is used to produce 

the animation of the sign using an animation tool 

JASigning [11]. It was developed for the 

ViSiCast project by Richard Kennaway 

Some of the symbols used in HamNoSys 

notation are:

Teaching Punjabi alphabet to hearing impaired 
students is very hard because of lack of teaching 

resources. We have tried an attempt to produce 

the web portal which displays the 
alphabet along with a word for that alphabet.

alphabet to hearing impaired 
students is very hard because of lack of teaching 

resources. We have tried an attempt to produce 

the web portal which displays the Punjabi 
alphabet along with a word for that alphabet. 

Along with the textual information (Punjabi 

175



Alphabet and corresponding word), a picture of 
the word is also displayed. The animation is 

produced in ISL describing how to produce the 

sign for each word. For each Punjabi alphabet, 
we have chosen two word for better 

understandability. For a total of 31 alphabets, we 

have created HamNoSys code for 61 words. 

HamNoSys has an alphabet of about 200 

symbols (Unicode of this notation system is 

available) which covers almost all the hand 
shapes, hand location, hand/palm orientation, 

hand movement, and non-manual parts of the 

sign. Later this HamNoSys can be converted into 
SiGML (Signing Gesture Markup Language) 

tags which are sort of XML tags that can be 

animated by an animation tool using an Avatar. 
The sequence of steps for creating the animation 

from English word is as shown in the following 

architecture [10]:  

 

Figure 5: Architecture to Produce the 

Animation from English Word 

All the 61 signs are dynamic signs except the 

sign of word ਨੱਕ (nose) which is static single 
handed sign. Below table shows the list of words 

corresponding to each Punjabi alphabet.

7. Conclusion 

Automatic tool for learning Punjabi Alphabet by 

the hearing impaired people is challenging task 

because creation of synthetic animation for all 

the words corresponding to Punjabi alphabets is 

very difficult to create. This paper represents the 

creation of synthetic animations using 

HamNoSys notation for 61 words for all the 
Punjabi alphabet. All the synthetic animations 

are incorporated in the web portal. The present 

work is important for hearing impaired people 

176



because of scarce resources like deaf schools in 
India. The tool can be very much beneficial for 

imparting education to these differently abled 

people.
