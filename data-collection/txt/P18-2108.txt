Abstract

We propose a novel neural method to ex-
tract drug-drug interactions (DDIs) from
texts using external drug molecular struc-
ture information. We encode textual drug
pairs with convolutional neural networks
and their molecular pairs with graph con-
volutional networks (GCNs), and then we
concatenate the outputs of these two net-
works. In the experiments, we show that
GCNs can predict DDIs from the molecu-
lar structures of drugs in high accuracy and
the molecular information can enhance
text-based DDI extraction by 2.39 percent
points in the F-score on the DDIExtraction
2013 shared task data set.

1 Introduction

When drugs are concomitantly administered to a
patient, the effects of the drugs may be enhanced
or weakened, which may also cause side effects.
These kinds of interactions are called Drug-Drug
Interactions (DDIs). Several drug databases have
been maintained to summarize drug and DDI in-
formation such as DrugBank (Law et al., 2014),
Therapeutic Target database (Yang et al., 2016),
and PharmGKB (Thorn et al., 2013). Automatic
DDI extraction from texts is expected to support
the maintenance of databases with high cover-
age and quick update to help medical experts.
Deep neural network-based methods have recently
drawn a considerable attention (Liu et al., 2016;
Sahu and Anand, 2017; Zheng et al., 2017; Lim
et al., 2018) since they show state-of-the-art per-
formance without manual feature engineering.

In parallel to the progress in DDI extrac-
tion from texts, Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCNs) have been proposed and applied to esti-
mate physical and chemical properties of molec-

ular graphs such as solubility and toxicity (Duve-
naud et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016; Gilmer et al.,
2017).

In this study, we propose a novel method to
utilize both textual and molecular information
for DDI extraction from texts. We illustrate the
overview of the proposed model in Figure 1. We
obtain the representations of drug pairs in molec-
ular graph structures using GCNs and concate-
nate the representations with the representations
of the textual mention pairs obtained by convo-
lutional neural networks (CNNs). We trained
the molecule-based model using interacting pairs
mentioned in the DrugBank database and then
trained the entire model using the labeled pairs
in the text data set of the DDIExtraction 2013
shared task (SemEval-2013 Task 9) (Segura Bed-
mar et al., 2013). In the experiment, we show
GCNs can predict DDIs from molecular graphs in
a high accuracy. We also show molecular informa-
tion can enhance the performance of DDI extrac-
tion from texts in 2.39 percent points in F-score.

The contribution of this paper is three-fold:
• We propose a novel neural method to extract

DDIs from texts with the related molecular
structure information.
• We apply GCNs to pairwise drug molecules

for the first time and show GCNs can predict
DDIs between drug molecular structures in a
high accuracy.
• We show the molecular information is useful

in extracting DDIs from texts.

2 Methods

2.1 Text-based DDI Extraction

Our model for extracting DDIs from texts is based
on the CNN model by Zeng et al. (2014). When
an input sentence S = (w1, w2, · · · , wN ) is given,
We prepare word embedding wwi of wi and word



681

Figure 1: Overview of the proposed model

position embeddings wpi,1 and w
p
i,2 that corre-

spond to the relative positions from the first and
second target entities, respectively. We concate-
nate these embeddings as in Equation (1), and we
use the resulting vector as the input to the subse-
quent convolution layer:

wi = [w
w
i ;w

p
i,1;w

p
i,2], (1)

where [; ] denotes the concatenation. We calculate
the expression for each filter j with the window
size kl.

zi,l = [wi−(kl−1)/2, · · · ,wi−(kl+1)/2], (2)
mi,j,l = relu(W

conv
j � zi,l + bconv), (3)

mj,l = max
i
mi,j,l, (4)

where L is the number of windows, W convj and
bconv are the weight and bias of CNN, and max
indicates max pooling (Boureau et al., 2010).

We convert the output of the convolution layer
into a fixed-size vector that represents a textual
pair as follows:

ml = [m1,l, · · · ,mJ,l], (5)
ht = [m1; . . . ;mL], (6)

where J is the number of filters.
We get a prediction ŷt by the following fully

connected neural networks:

h
(1)
t = relu(W

(1)
t ht + b

(1)
t ), (7)

ŷt = softmax(W
(2)
t h

(1)
t + b

(2)
t ), (8)

where W (1)t and W
(2)
t are weights and b

(1)
t and

b
(2)
t are bias terms.

2.2 Molecular Structure-based DDI
Classification

We represent drug pairs in molecular graph struc-
tures using two GCN methods: CNNs for finger-
prints (NFP) (Duvenaud et al., 2015) and Gated
Graph Neural Networks (GGNN) (Li et al., 2016).
They both convert a drug molecule graph G into a
fixed size vector hg by aggregating the represen-
tation hTv of an atom node v in G. We represent
atoms as nodes and bonds as edges in the graph.

NFP first obtains the representation htv by the
following equations (Duvenaud et al., 2015).

mt+1v = h
t
v +

∑
w∈N(v)

htw, (9)

ht+1v = σ(H
deg(v)
t m

t+1
v ), (10)

where htv is the representation of v in the t-th
step, N(v) is the neighbors of v, and Hdeg(v)t is
a weight parameter. h0v is initialized by the atom
features of v. deg(v) is the degree of a node v and
σ is a sigmoid function. NFP then acquires the
representation of the graph structure

hg =
∑
v,t

softmax(W thtv), (11)

where W t is a weight matrix.
GGNN first obtains the representation htv by us-

ing Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based recurrent
neural networks (Li et al., 2016) as follows:

mt+1v =
∑

w∈N(v)

Aevwh
t
w (12)

ht+1v = GRU([h
t
v;m

t+1
v ]), (13)



682

where Aevw is a weight for the bond type of each
edge evw. GGNN then acquires the representation
of the graph structure.

hg =
∑
v

σ(i([hTv ;h
0
v]))� (j(hTv )), (14)

where i and j are linear layers and � is the
element-wise product.

We obtain the representation of a molecular pair
by concatenating the molecular graph representa-
tions of drugs g1 and g2, i.e., hm = [hg1 ;hg2 ].

We get a prediction ŷm as follows:

h(1)m = relu(W
(1)
m hm + b

(1)
m ), (15)

ŷm = softmax(W
(2)
m h

(1)
m + b

(2)
m ), (16)

where W (1)m and W
(2)
m are weights and b

(1)
m and

b
(2)
m are bias terms.

2.3 DDI Extraction from Texts Using
Molecular Structures

We realize the simultaneous use of textual and
molecular information by concatenating a text-
based and molecule-based vectors: hall =
[ht;hm]. We normalize molecule-based vectors.
We then use hall instead of ht in Equation 7.

In training, we first train the molecular-based
DDI classification model. The molecular-based
classification is performed by minimizing the loss
function Lm = −

∑
ym log ŷm. We then fix the

parameters for GCNs and train text-based DDI ex-
traction model by minimizing the loss function
Lt = −

∑
yt log ŷt.

3 Experimental Settings

In this section, we explain the textual and molecu-
lar data and task settings and training settings.

3.1 Text Corpus and Task Setting
We followed the task setting of Task 9.2 in the
DDIExtraction 2013 shared task (Segura Bedmar
et al., 2013; Herrero-Zazo et al., 2013) for the eval-
uation. This data set is composed of documents
annotated with drug mentions and their four types
of interactions: Mechanism, Effect, Advice and
Int. For the data statistics, please refer to the sup-
plementary materials.

The task is a multi-class classification task, i.e.,
to classify a given pair of drugs into the four inter-
action types or no interaction. We evaluated the
performance with micro-averaged precision (P),

Figure 2: Associating DrugBank entries with texts
and molecular graph structures

recall (R), and F-score (F) on all the interaction
types. We used the official evaluation script pro-
vided by the task organizers.

As preprocessing, we split sentences into words
using the GENIA tagger (Tsuruoka et al., 2005).
We replaced the drug mentions of the target pair
with DRUG1 and DRUG2 according to their or-
der of appearance. We also replaced other drug
mentions with DRUGOTHER. We did not em-
ploy negative instance filtering unlike other exist-
ing methods, e.g., Liu et al. (2016), since our focus
is to evaluate the effect of the molecular informa-
tion on texts.

We linked mentions in texts to DrugBank en-
tries by string matching. We lowercased the men-
tions and the names in the entries and chose the
entries with the most overlaps. As a result, 92.15%
and 93.09% of drug mentions in train and test data
set matched the DrugBank entries.

3.2 Data and Task for Molecular Structures

We extracted 255,229 interacting (positive) pairs
from DrugBank. We note that, unlike text-based
interactions, DrugBank only contains the informa-
tion of interacting pairs; there are no detailed la-
bels and no information for non-interacting (neg-
ative) pairs. We thus generated the same num-
ber of pseudo negative pairs by randomly pairing
drugs and removing those in positive pairs. To
avoid overestimation of the performance, we also
deleted drug pairs mentioned in the test set of the
text corpus. We split positive and negative pairs
into 4:1 for training and test data, and we evaluated
the classification accuracy using only the molecu-
lar information.

To obtain the graph of a drug molecule, we took

as input the SMILES (Weininger, 1988) string en-
coding of the molecule from DrugBank and then
converted it into the graph using RDKit (Landrum,
2016) as illustrated in Figure 2. For the atom
features, we used randomly embedded vectors for
each atoms (i.e., C, O, N, ...). We also used 4 bond
types: single, double, triple, or aromatic.

3.3 Training Settings

We employed mini-batch training using the Adam
optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2015). We used L2
regularization to avoid over-fitting. We tuned the
bias term b(2)t for negative examples in the final
softmax layer. For the hyper-parameters, please
refer to the supplementary materials.

We employed pre-trained word embeddings
trained by using the word2vec tool (Mikolov et al.,
2013) on the 2014 MEDLINE/PubMed baseline
distribution. The vocabulary size was 215,840.
The embedding of the drugs, i.e., DRUG1 and
DRUG2 were initialized with the pre-trained em-
bedding of the word drug. The embeddings of
training words that did not appear in the pre-
trained embeddings were initialized with the av-
erage of all pre-trained word embeddings. Words
that appeared only once in the training data were
replaced with an UNK word during training, and
the embedding of words in the test data set that did
not appear in both training and pre-trained embed-
dings were set to the embedding of the UNK word.
Word position embeddings are initialized with ran-
dom values drawn from a uniform distribution.

We set the molecule-based vectors of un-
matched entities to zero vectors.

4 Results

Table 1 shows the performance of DDI extrac-
tion models. We show the performance with-
out negative instance filtering or ensemble for the
fair comparison. We observe the increase of re-
call and F-score by using molecular information,

which results in the state-of-the-art performance
with GGNN.

Both GCNs improvements were statistically
significant (p < 0.05 for NFP and p < 0.005 for
GGNN) with randomized shuffled test.

Table 2 shows F-scores on individual DDI
types. The molecular information improves F-
scores especially on type Mechanism and Effect.

We also evaluated the accuracy of binary clas-
sification on DrugBank pairs by using only the
molecular information in Table 3. The perfor-
mance is high, although the accuracy is evaluated
on automatically generated negative instances.

Finally, we applied the molecular-based DDI
classification model trained on DrugBank to the
DDIExtraction 2013 task data set. Since the Drug-
Bank has no detailed labels, we mapped all four
types of interactions to positive interactions and
evaluated the classification performance. The re-
sults in Table 4 show that GCNs produce higher
recall than precision and the overall performance
is low considering the high performance on Drug-
Bank pairs. This might be because the interactions
of drugs are not always mentioned in texts even if
the drugs can interact with each other and because
hedged DDI mentions are annotated as DDIs in the
text data set. We also trained the DDI extraction
model only with molecular information by replac-
ing hall with hm, but the F-scores were quite low
(< 5%). These results show that we cannot predict
textual relations only with molecular information.

5 Related Work

Various feature-based methods have been pro-
posed during and after the DDIExtraction-2013
shared task (Segura Bedmar et al., 2013). Kim
et al. (2015) proposed a two-phase SVM-based ap-
proach that employed a linear SVM with rich fea-
tures that consist of word, word pair, dependency
graph, parse tree, and noun phrase-based con-
strained coordination features. Zheng et al. (2016)
proposed a context vector graph kernel to exploit
various types of contexts. Raihani and Laachfoubi
(2017) also employed a two-phase SVM-based ap-
proach using non-linear kernels and they proposed
five groups of features: word, drug, pair of drug,
main verb and negative sentence features. Our
model does not use any features or kernels.

Various neural DDI extraction models have
been recently proposed using CNNs and Recur-
rent Neural Networks (RNNs). Liu et al. (2016)
built a CNN-based model based on word and po-
sition embeddings. Zheng et al. (2017) proposed
a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory RNN
(Bi-LSTM)-based model with an input attention
mechanism, which obtained target drug-specific
word representations before the Bi-LSTM. Lim
et al. (2018) proposed Recursive neural network-
based model with a subtree containment feature
and an ensemble method. This model showed the
state-of-the-art performance on the DDIExtraction
2013 shared task data set if systems do not use
negative instance filtering. These approaches did
not consider molecular information, and they can
also be enhanced by the molecular information.

Vilar et al. (2017) focused on detecting DDIs
from different sources such as pharmacovigilance
sources, scientific biomedical literature and social
media. They did not use deep neural networks and
they did not consider molecular information.

Learning representations of graphs are widely
studied in several tasks such as knowledge base
completion, drug discovery, and material sci-
ence (Wang et al., 2017; Gilmer et al., 2017).
Several graph convolutional neural networks have
been proposed such as NFP (Duvenaud et al.,
2015), GGNN (Li et al., 2016), and Molecular
Graph Convolutions (Kearnes et al., 2016), but
they have not been applied to DDI extraction.

6 Conclusions

We proposed a novel neural method for DDI ex-
traction using both textual and molecular informa-

tion. The results show that DDIs can be predicted
with high accuracy from molecular structure in-
formation and that the molecular information can
improve DDI extraction from texts by 2.39 percept
points in F-score on the data set of the DDIExtrac-
tion 2013 shared task.

As future work, we would like to seek the way
to model the textual and molecular representations
jointly with alleviating the differences in labels.
We will also investigate the use of other informa-
tion in DrugBank.
