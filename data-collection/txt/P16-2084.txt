Learning Distributed Word Representations?

Abstract

Recent comparative studies have demon-
strated the usefulness of dependency-
based contexts (DEPS) for learning dis-
tributed word representations for similar-
ity tasks. In English, DEPS tend to per-
form better than the more common, less
informed bag-of-words contexts (BOW).
In this paper, we present the first cross-
linguistic comparison of different context
types for three different languages. DEPS
are extracted from “universal parses” with-
out any language-specific optimization.
Our results suggest that the universal
DEPS (UDEPS) are useful for detecting
functional similarity (e.g., verb similarity,
solving syntactic analogies) among lan-
guages, but their advantage over BOW is
not as prominent as previously reported
on English. We also show that simple
“post-parsing” filtering of useful UDEPS
contexts leads to consistent improvements
across languages.

1 Introduction

Dense real-valued distributed representations of
words known as word embeddings (WEs) have be-
come ubiquitous in NLP, serving as invaluable fea-
tures in a broad range of NLP tasks, e.g., (Turian
et al., 2010; Collobert et al., 2011; Chen and
Manning, 2014). The omnipresent word2vec
skip-gram model with negative sampling (SGNS)
(Mikolov et al., 2013b) is still considered the state-
of-the-art word representation model, due to its
simplicity, fast training, as well as its solid and ro-
bust performance across a wide variety of seman-
tic tasks (Baroni et al., 2014; Levy et al., 2015).

The original implementation of SGNS learns
word representations from local bag-of-words

contexts (BOW). However, the underlying SGNS
model is equally applicable to other context types.

Recent comparative studies have demonstrated
the usefulness of dependency-based contexts
(DEPS) (Padó and Lapata, 2007) for the task. In
comparison with BOW, syntactic contexts steer
the induced semantic spaces towards functional
similarity (e.g., tiger:cat) rather than towards
topical similarity/relatedness (e.g., tiger:jungle).
DEPS-based embeddings outperform the less in-
formed BOW-based embeddings in a variety of
similarity tasks (Bansal et al., 2014; Levy and
Goldberg, 2014a; Hill et al., 2015; Melamud et
al., 2016). However, these studies have all fo-
cused solely on English. A comparison extend-
ing to additional languages is required before any
cross-lingual generalisations can be drawn.

Following recent initiatives on language-
agnostic and cross-linguistically consistent
universal natural language processing (i.e.,
universal POS (UPOS) tagging and dependency
(UD) parsing) (Nivre et al., 2015), this paper is
concerned with two important questions:

(Q1) Can one usefully replace the DEPS ex-
traction pipeline optimised for tools developed for
English with a pipeline that relies on language-
universal syntactic processing (UDEPS)?

(Q2) Are UDEPS universally better than BOW
for learning distributed word representations in
other languages?

Regarding Q1, the results show that it is pos-
sible to replace original DEPS with UDEPS for
English and to obtain benchmarking results with
only a slight drop in performance. As for Q2, the
framework is not equally effective in other lan-
guages, as suggested by the performance in Ital-
ian and German, which sheds new light on the
usefulness of BOW and dependency-based con-
texts. Further, the results reveal that even a sim-
ple preliminary “post-parsing” selection of use-

518



ful UDEPS contexts leads to consistent improve-
ments across languages, especially in detecting
functional similarity.

This focused contribution is the first cross-
linguistic comparison of different context types for
learning word representations in three languages,
reaching beyond English. It also constitutes a first
completely language-universal and widely appli-
cable framework for UDEPS extraction.

2 Methodology

Universal Multilingual Resources The depar-
ture point in our experiments is the Universal
Dependencies project (McDonald et al., 2013;
Nivre et al., 2015) which develops cross-
linguistically consistent treebank annotation.1 The
annotation scheme leans on the universal Stan-
ford dependencies (de Marneffe et al., 2014) com-
plemented with the Google universal POS tagset
(Petrov et al., 2012) and the Interset interlingua for
morphological tagsets (Zeman and Resnik, 2008).
It provides a universal and consistent inventory
of categories for similar syntactic constructions
across languages.

The main aim of the “universal initiative” is
to facilitate cross-lingual and multilingual learn-
ing (e.g., multilingual parser development, typolo-
gies) by capturing structural similarities across
languages and by exploiting connections that ex-
ist naturally between them (Berg-Kirkpatrick and
Klein, 2010; McDonald et al., 2011; Cohen et al.,
2011; Naseem et al., 2012). Here, we test the abil-
ity of such a universal annotation scheme to en-
code potentially useful semantic knowledge cross-
linguistically; in this case, to yield more informed
UDEPS contexts for improved word embeddings.

The extraction of UDEPS as the new vari-
ant of dependency-based contexts is completely
language-agnostic on purpose: exactly the same
procedure is followed for each language in com-
parison in order to make the representation learn-
ing framework completely universal.

2.1 Context Types

Prequel: Representation Model For all the
context types, we opt for the standard and robust
choice in vector space modeling: SGNS (Mikolov
et al., 2013b; Levy et al., 2015). In all our ex-
periments we use word2vecf, a reimplementa-

tion of word2vec which is capable of learning
from arbitrary (word, context) pairs.2 Keeping
the representation model fixed across experiments
and varying only the context type allows us to at-
tribute any differences in results to a sole factor:
the context type.

BOW The English sentence from Fig. 1 is used
as the running example for all context types.
Given the target word w and the window size k,
the BOW context simply comprises all 2k word
pairs (w, v), where v is found in the window of k
words preceding w or k words following w, e.g.,
BOW with k = 2 extracts the following contexts
v for the word discovers from Fig. 1: Australian,
scientist, stars, with. Note that BOW may miss
valid longer-range contexts (e.g., telescope) while
including some accidental (e.g., Australian) or un-
informative ones (e.g., with).

POSIT A more informed variant of BOW is po-
sitional contexts. It includes extra information on
the actual sequential position of each context word
(Levy and Goldberg, 2014b). Given the same ex-
ample, POSIT with k = 2 extracts the following
contexts for discovers: Australian_-2, scientist_-

1, stars_+2, with_+1. This context type has not
been studied systematically in relation to learning
WEs. POSIT suffers from the same issues with
locality as BOW, but its shallow positional anno-
tations may capture additional shallow syntactic
phenomena in the data. Therefore, POSIT may be
considered a link from BOW towards DEPS.3

UDEPS-NAIVE Given a corpus of parsed
sentences, for each target w with modifiers
m1, . . . ,mk and head h, w is paired with con-
text elements m1_r1, . . . ,mk_rk, h_r−1h , where r
is the type of the UD relation between the head and
the modifier (e.g., amod), and r−1 denotes an in-
verse relation. A naive version of the UD-based
model extracts contexts from the parsed corpus
without any post-processing. The UDEPS-NAIVE
contexts of discovers are now: scientist_nsubj,
stars_dobj, telescope_nmod. They capture longer-
range relations (e.g., telescope) and filter “acci-
dental contexts” (e.g., Australian). In addition, the
typed dependencies reveal more than POSIT and
BOW about the nature of the relation in context.

UDEPS-ARC However, UDEPS-NAIVE also
produces uninformative context pairs such as
(telescope, with_case), and it does not specify the
type of e.g. the nmod relation between discovers
and telescope which are linked through the prepo-
sition with. Our intuition is that a simple post-hoc
intervention into the UDEPS context extraction
may yield even more focused contexts. UDEPS-
ARC leans on the idea of arc collapsing from prior
work (Levy and Goldberg, 2014a; Melamud et al.,
2016) that we now adjust to the UD annotation
scheme. The difference to UDEPS-NAIVE is as
follows: For each pair of words linked through
case (e.g., discovers and telescope), we introduce
a new “pseudo-arc” which is typed by the actual
case/preposition. This results in a new context for
discovers: telescope_case_with and also for tele-
scope: discovers_case_with−1 (Fig. 1). In addi-
tion, we remove the uninformative case arc and
its associated contexts: (with, telescope_case−1),
(telescope, with_case) from the training pairs.

3Results with another context type relying on substitute
vectors (Yatbaz et al., 2012; Melamud et al., 2015) are omit-
ted due to its subpar performance in our experiments as well
as across a variety of semantic tasks in a recent English-
focused study (Melamud et al., 2016).

3 Experimental Setup

Evaluation Our cross-linguistic study is made
possible not only thanks to the “universal NLP”
initiative but also owing to the benchmarking eval-
uation sets for other languages beyond English
(i.e., IT, DE) that have very recently become avail-
able, e.g., (Leviant and Reichart, 2015). We
evaluate SGNS with different context types from
sect. 2.1 across the three languages on two bench-
marking tasks and datasets: (1) semantic similarity
on SimLex-999 (Hill et al., 2015) translated and
re-scored by native speakers in EN, DE, and IT
(Leviant and Reichart, 2015), and (2) word analo-
gies on the Google dataset (Mikolov et al., 2013a)
made available in IT (Berardi et al., 2015) and DE
(Köper et al., 2015) only recently.

WE Induction: Data All the word representa-
tions in comparison are induced from the Polyglot
Wikipedia data (Al-Rfou et al., 2013).4

UPOS Tagging and UD Parsing The
Wikipedia corpora were UPOS-tagged using
a state-of-the art system TurboTagger (Martins
et al., 2013).5 TurboTagger was trained using
suggested settings without any further parameter
fine-tuning (SVM MIRA with 20 iterations) on
the TRAIN+DEV portion of the UD treebank
annotated with UPOS tags. Following that,
the Wikipedia data were UD-parsed6 using the
graph-based Mate parser v3.61 (Bohnet, 2010)7

and the same regime: suggested settings on
the TRAIN+DEV UD treebank portion.8 The
performance of the models measured on the TEST
portion of the UD treebanks is reported in Tab. 1.

6Besides EN, DE, and IT, we also UPOS-tagged and UD-

parsed Wikipedias in NL, ES, and HR. We believe that the full
UPOS-tagged and UD-parsed Wikipedias in six languages
are a valuable asset for future research and we plan to make
the resource publicly available at:
http://ltl.mml.cam.ac.uk/resources/

8We opted for the Mate parser due to its speed, simplic-

ity, and state-of-the-art performance according to very recent
parser evaluations (Choi et al., 2015).

DEPS-LEVY refers to pre-trained 300-dimensional EN WEs from (Levy and Goldberg, 2014a).

The results are consistent with prior work on the
UD treebanks, e.g., (Tiedemann, 2015).

Training Setup The SGNS preprocessing
scheme for English was replicated from (Levy
and Goldberg, 2014a) and extended to the other
two languages: all tokens were converted to
lowercase, and words and contexts that appeared
less than 100 times were filtered. Exactly the
same vocabularies were used with all context
types (approx. 185K distinct EN words, 163K
DE words, and 83K IT words). The word2vecf
SGNS was trained using standard settings: 15
epochs, 15 negative samples, global learning
rate 0.025, subsampling rate 1e − 4. All WEs
were trained with d = 50, 100, 300, 500, 600.
BOW-based WEs were trained with k = 2
(BOW-2), proven to be the (near-)optimal choice
across various semantic tasks in related work
(Levy and Goldberg, 2014a; Melamud et al.,
2016). The same k was used for POSIT-based
WEs (POSIT-2).

4 Results and Discussion

Fig. 2(a)-2(c) show the results on SimLex-999
(Spearman’s ρ) for WEs with different d-s, while
Tab. 2 displays the Acc@1 scores in the anal-

ogy solving task. English DEPS with arc collaps-
ing from prior work (Levy and Goldberg, 2014a)
(DEPS-LEVY, d = 300) obtain ρ of 0.372 on all
SimLex pairs, and 0.378 on verb pairs.9 A com-
parison with UDEPS-ARC reveals only a slight
drop in performance when switching to language-
agnostic UDEPS (see Fig. 2(a), Q1).10

However, the results are heavily dependent on
the actual language: the claims made for English
(i.e., DEPS ≥ BOW) do not extend to other lan-
guages (Q2). A comparison of results from Tab. 1
with the task evaluation also shows that excel-
lent tagging and parsing results do not guarantee
a strong task performance.

The results over the verb subset of SimLex also
reveal that claims established with English are not
necessarily general and true with other languages.
For instance, while it has been noted that model-
ing verb similarity is indeed a difficult problem in
English as evidenced by lower correlation scores
on SimLex (see Fig. 2(a) and e.g. (Schwartz et
al., 2015)), verbs are apparently easier to model in
Italian (Fig. 2(c)), and a real challenge in German,

9Note that the correlation scores for all models on the
re-annotated version of SimLex-999 (Leviant and Reichart,
2015) are lower than those on the original SimLex-999.

10The comparison is valid since DEPS-LEVY were trained
on exactly the same data with the same vocabulary.

with extremely low correlation scores (Fig. 2(b)).
The results on the analogy task from Tab. 2 sug-

gest the evident advantage of more abundant (but
less informed) BOW contexts across all languages.
This finding is completely in line with the analyses
from prior work on English, e.g., Levy and Gold-
berg (2014a) report that “DEPS perform dramati-
cally worse than BOW contexts on analogy tasks”,
but without providing any exact numbers.

Nonetheless, the relative ranking of context
types over syntactic analogy sets as highlighted in
Tab. 3 marks the evident advantage of the more-
informed POSIT and UDEPS-ARC on analogies
referring to functional similarity. UDEPS-ARC
in German outperforms all other context types on
all syntactic analogies, except for the nationality-
adjective relation. The strongest performance of
UDEPS is detected with syntactic analogies where
two words in the analogy pair are perfectly re-
placeable in the given context (e.g., past-tense:
dancing-danced, sleeping-slept or opposite: sure-
unsure, honest-dishonest).

We can also see that POSIT displays a strong
performance in detecting functional similarity
across all three languages in both tasks (e.g., see
the results in Tab. 3 where they outperform BOW).
This finding reveals that POSIT should be in-
cluded as a strong baseline in any follow-up work.

We also analysed the influence of the train-
ing data size by learning EN WEs from the
EN Wikipedia comprising roughly 13M sentences
(same size as the IT Wikipedia). As Tab. 4 shows,
the absolute scores are naturally lower with less
training data, and we observe a decrease in the
performance of UDEPS. However, the decrease is
small: these results demonstrate that the reduced
performance of UDEPS in IT and DE cannot be
attributed solely to smaller training datasets and
sparsity of (word, context) pairs.

Finally, the consistent improvements of

trained on a reduced EN training set containing the
same number of sentences as the entire IT training
set (≈ 13M sentences). d = 300.
UDEPS-ARC over UDEPS-NAIVE for all three
languages on both tasks show the importance of a
careful post-hoc selection of informative contexts.
Future work will delve deeper into the informative
context selection for the WE learning.

5 Conclusion and Future Work

We have presented the first comparison of differ-
ent context types for learning word embeddings
for multiple languages. Dependency-based con-
texts in different languages are for the first time
extracted from “universal” parses made possible
by the Universal Dependencies initiative, without
any language-specific optimisation.

In sum, our comparison provides no clear an-
swer to the question posed by the title of this pa-
per. However, it shows conclusively that different
context types yield semantic spaces with different
properties, and that the optimal context type de-
pends on the actual application and language. The
usefulness of universal dependency-based con-
texts is evident with a simple post-parsing context
extraction scheme in tasks oriented towards syn-
tactic/functional similarity.

This first cross-linguistic analysis covering only
a small set of languages from the same (Indo-
European) phylum also reveals that training word
embeddings in languages other than English is not
trivial, suggesting Anglo-centric assumptions that
do not extend to other languages (Bender, 2011).
It is therefore essential not to generalise results
on English to other languages without clear em-
pirical evidence. Yet, a broader cross-linguistic
study involving more languages from other fam-
ilies (with UD treebanks available) and additional
experimentation is warranted in order to better
guide research on “universal NLP” and language-
independent word representation learning.
