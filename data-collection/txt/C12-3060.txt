ABSTRACT 

An interactive Multilingual Access Gateway (iMAG) dedicated to a web site S (iMAG-S) is a 
good tool to make S accessible in many languages immediately and without editorial 
responsibility. Visitors of S as well as paid or unpaid post-editors and moderators contribute to 
the continuous and incremental improvement of the most important textual segments, and 
eventually of all. Pre-translations are produced by one or more free MT systems. Continuous use 
since 2008 on many web sites and for several access languages shows that a quality comparable 
to that of a first draft by junior professional translators is obtained in about 40% of the (human) 
time, sometimes less. There are two interesting side effects obtainable without any added cost: 
iMAGs can be used to produce high-quality parallel corpora and to set up a permanent task-based 
evaluation of multiple MT systems. We will demonstrate (1) the multilingual access to a web 
site, with online postediting of MT results "à la Google", (2) postediting in "advanced mode", 
using SECTra_w as a back-end, enabling online comparison of MT systems, (3) task-oriented 
built-in evaluation (postediting time), and (4) application to a large web site to get a trilingual 
parallel corpus where each segment has a reliability level and a quality score.

简述 

一个iMAG (interactive Multilingual Access Gateway, 多语言交互式网关) 是很好的面向一个
网站的工具，它可以提供对该网站的多语言访问，并且无需任何编辑。通过iMAG访问该
网站的用户，可以作为有偿或无偿的后编辑人员或是管理者，来对该网站的文本段进行可
持续的、增量的改进。该网站的预翻译是由一个或多个免费的MT系统提供的。自从2008
年以来，通过iMAG对多个网站进行多语言的持续访问结果表明，对于相对翻译质量，首
轮由初级翻译者提供的翻译，使用iMAG只占纯人工翻译40%的时间，或更少。iMAG有两
个非常吸引人的方面并且无需额外成本：iMAG能用于产生高质量的平行语料，而且可以
通过多个MT系统对其进行长久性的评估。我们将要展示：(1) 多语言访问目标网站，并对
Google提供的预翻译进行在线后编辑，(2) 后编辑的高级模式，SECTra作为后台模块，可
实现MT系统的在线比较，(3) 面向任务的评估 （后编辑时间），和 (4) 应用到大型网站，
可获得三种语言的平行语料，每个文字段都拥有可靠性和质量的评分。

1 Introduction 

An iMAG is a website used as a gateway allowing a multilingual access to one (in general) or 
several elected websites. The name "iMAG" stands for interactive Multilingual Access Gateway. 

Apparently, an iMAG is similar to existing well-known translation gateways such as Google 
Translate, Systran, Reverso, etc. The first essential difference is that an iMAG is only used for 
elected websites. This allows the iMAG to manage the multilingualization of certain websites 
better than existing translation gateways. With an iMAG, we can enhance the quality of 
translated pages, starting from raw output of general-purpose and free MT servers, usually of low 
quality and often understandable unless one understands enough of the source language. 

An iMAG is dedicated to an elected website, or rather to the elected sublanguage defined by one 
or more URLs and their textual content.  It contains a translation memory (TM), both dedicated 
to the elected sublanguage. Segments are pre-translated not by a unique MT system, but by a 
(selectable) set of MT systems. Systran and Google are mainly used now, but specialized systems 
developed from the post-edit part of the TM, and based on Moses, will be also used in the future. 

iMAG also contains a module SECTra (Système d'Exploitation de Corpus de Traductions sur le 
web), in English, "Contributive Operating System of Translation Corpora on the Web". SECTra 
is a Web-based system offering several services, such as supporting MT evaluation campaigns 
and online post-editing of MT results, to produce reference translations adapted to classical MT 
systems not built by machine learning from a parallel corpus. 

2 Manipulation and pre-translation in the iMAG page  

2.1 Access multilingual website by iMAG 

Figure 1 shows the iMAG access interface to LIG (the Grenoble computer science laboratory) 
website. We choose target language (Chinese) in the pull-down menu. The page is now accessed 
in Chinese language. One or more free MT servers, in this case Google Translate and Systran, 
produce initial translations.

2.2 Post-edition and evaluation in web page context 

In iMAG, user can also optimize the translation results. As shown in Figure 2, when the user 
moves the mouse on translation unit (for example: a word, a title), the system will automatically 
pop up a small dialog box. This dialog box display source language content in blue font, and user 
can post edit and evaluate the translation results. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 2. Optimize translation results in iMAG interface 

If user is an anonymous, or non-privileged, this optimize translation and ratings only display to 
him, and he can't enter the advanced mode. If user has privilege, optimize translation and ratings 
will be stored in the system database, and also display to publics. If database contains multiple 
optimizes translations, system will select translation, which has the highest scores and time 
recently. For those users who have the appropriate permissions, they can come into "Advanced 
mode", and arrives into SECTra. This will be described in chapter 3. 

2.3 Visualization of the translation quality 

In the translated page, users can view quickly and clearly the translation quality of web pages by 
“reliability” mode. As shown in Figure 3, a color bracket encloses each translation unit. If user 
post-edit in this page, then his result will be displayed directly on the page, at the same time, 
bracket's color will be changed based on user permissions. Green brackets indicate that the 
translation results are edited and saved by privileged user. Orange means the translation results 
are edited and saved locally by anonymous users (only for anonymous users). Red indicate the 
translation results have never been edited. If the user clicks on the Original button, the left side of 
the browser will display the translation results; the right side displays the source language page.

2.4 Interaction between iMAG and SECTra 

Another possibility is to use the advanced mode (see the chapter 2.2), which consists in post-
editing a pseudo-document that is in fact a part of the translation memory.  

Remark: content of chapter 2 will be on display in the video 1. 

3 Post-edition of TMs in "Advance Mode" (SECTra) 

In order to obtain the translation results with the high quality, post-editing is a very important 
point, but also the most time-consuming work. In "Advance Mode" (SECTra), we can quickly get 
high quality translation results with minimum price. Figure 4 shows the interface of SECTra 
post-editing features.

3.1 Proposition of translation in SECTra 

The first time user create an iMAG, he can select different machines translations systems for his 
website. Certainly he can also add new machine translation system later in SECTra. In interface 
of post edit, SECTra allows us to do operations for machine translation results (such as Google 
Translate, Systran translation), and translation memory database. 

• For machine translation: clear translation result, re-call the machine translation system, 
and use the translation result. 

• For translation memory: delete translation memory, use translation memory 

3.2 Comparison between current translation and MT/TM results 

As shown in Figure 5, users can compare distance between the current translation and translation 
memory, or between the current translation and machine translation.

SECTra can also provide a reference language, which helps users to better post-edit, as shown in 
Figure 6.

3.3 Post-edition and evaluation  

Users can also vote the number of stars and the value of rating for these post-editions. The 
number of stars is the control ability of the language pair (the source language and the target 

479



language) of the current post-edition. The value of rating is the satisfaction level of the current 
post-edition. 

In the process of post-edition, the system will automatically record the time and segments 
number. As the first two authors are Chinese, they have experimented with French-Chinese (on a 
town web site) and with Chinese-English (on a Chinese web site dedicated to a famous Chinese 
NLP scientist). Here are the results.

Zh->En 16 mins 75 mins 32 495 (Zh) — 1.25 p. 307 (En) — 1.16 p. 

3.4 Visualization of post-edition in iMAG Web pages 

Post-edition results will be displayed directly on the iMAG Web page, and bracket's color will be 
changed based on user permissions (see the chapter 2.3). 

Remark: content of chapter 3 will be on display in the video 2. 

4. To obtain a high-quality parallel corpus 

4.1 Filtering and selection of segments 

On the platform of the SECTra, the user can export corpus of TM. At the time of export, we can 
filter segments by stars and scores. In Figure 7, for example the source language is French, the 
target language is Chinese, and we can select part of segments for export. 

Figure 7. Interface of export corpus 

4.2 Production of parallel corpus and download 

For the selected parallel corpus, the system will generate two txt files, and users may download 
these files, the results shown in Figure 9.

5. Conclusion and perspectives 

Continuous use since 2008 on many web sites and for several access languages shows that a 
quality comparable to that of a first draft by junior professional translators is obtained in about 
40% of the (human) time, sometimes less.  

In the near future, the system will be integrated Moses, and based on Moses for provide more 
accurate TA results.
