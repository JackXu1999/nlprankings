Abstract 

 

Rare diseases are not that rare: worldwide, one 
in 12-17 people will be affected by a rare dis-
ease. Newborn screening for rare diseases has 
been adopted by many European and North 
American jurisdictions. The results of genetic 
testing are given to millions of families and 
children’s guardians who often turn to the In-
ternet to find more information about the dis-
ease. We found 42 medical forums and blogs 
where parents and other related adults form 
virtual communities to discuss the disease di-
agnosis, share related knowledge and seek 
moral support.   Many people (up to 75% in 
some population groups) look for professional 
medical publications to find reliable informa-
tion. How can it be made easier for these non-
medical professionals to understand such 
texts?   We suggest that recommender sys-
tems, installed on web sites of research and 
teaching health care organizations, can be a 
tool that helps parents to navigate a massive 
amount of available medical information.  In 
this paper, we discuss NLP architecture of 
such a system. We concentrate on processing 
epistemic modal expressions and helping the 
general public to evaluate the certainty of an 
event.       

1 Introduction 

A rare disease is identified as a life-threatening 
or chronically debilitating condition affecting not 
more than 5 in 10.000 persons (Cornel et al., 
2013). Accumulatively, rare diseases are not un-
common. In UK, one in 17 people will be af-
fected at some point in their lives; this equates to 
more than 3.5 million people. Most of these will 
be children, and 30% of individuals with a rare 

disease will die before they are five years old. 1  
In Canada, one in 12 people suffer from a rare 
disease, and the number of identified rare diseas-
es identified constantly increases.2

Nevertheless, Raffle and Gray (2007) note that 
screening programs can induce harm.  Whereas 
the programs improve health status in patients by 
diagnosing them early and treating optimally, 
after the screening, parents and guardians of the 
newborns receive a substantial amount of new 
information about health of their children. The 
results may cause parental stress and anxiety, 
among other negative factors. To aid in naviga-
tion through the screening results, health care 
authorities organized web-based resource cen-
ters, such as a joint web site by the Newborn 
Screening Ontario program and Children’s Hos-
pital of Eastern Ontario

   

 A prevailing understanding is that early diagno-
sis and treatment may ease the burden of a dis-
ease.  Thus, newborn screening for rare diseases 
has become a routine procedure in USA, Canada 
and the member states of the European Union.

ing web site by the National Health Service4

Emergence of user-friendly online technologies 
prompted the general public to turn to the Inter-
net to gain more knowledge on health-related 
issues, a phenomenon often referred to as Dr. 
Google.  A 2011 survey of the US population 
estimated that i) 59% of all adults have looked 
online for information about health topics such

as a specific disease or treatment, ii) 18% of 
adults have consulted online reviews of particu-
lar drugs or medical treatments, iii) 29% of all 
adults sought online health information related to 
somebody’s else medical condition (Fox 2011; 
Fox 2011a).    Preference in online searches re-
lated to specific health problems was previously 
reported by Nicholas et al. (2003).  
 
At the same time, the general public does not 
consider different sources of the available health 
information as being equal.  75% of non-medical 
professionals aim their online searchers at pro-
fessional medical sites and publications (McMul-
lan, 2006). Many individuals prefer to have an 
access to a complex and complete information 
(80%), whereas some feel that the information 
usually accessed is too basic (45%) (ibid).  
An important question arises as to how well the 
readers can understand the information they re-
trieve. Eysenbach (2003) reported that patients 
who sought health information online felt that 
Internet information can be overwhelming 
(31%), conflicting (76%) and confusing (27%). 
 
The system that we are building aims to help in-
dividuals, specifically parents of newborns, to 
navigate and assess medical publications about 
rare diseases.   
 

2 Motivation 
It has been documented that many parental users 
of the Internet are first-time parents (Oprescu et 
al, 2013) and parents with young children (Balka  
and Butt, 2006). They might not have a hands-on 
experience or practice in dealing with a complex 
medical issue and information related to it and 
can be easily overwhelmed. This is especially 
true for parents of newborn babies which were 
screened positive for one of the rare diseases.       
 
The screening happens at the very beginning of 
the child’s life.  A positive result may cause par-
ents’ insecurity and increase their uncertainty 
about future (Brashers, 2001). Gaining new 
knowledge through relevant information is one 
of the tools that can alleviate stress and anxiety 
(Brashers, 2000). It is natural that the affected 
parents search for information about the diagno-
sis and turn their attention to professional medi-
cal publications.  
 

In the quest for knowledge, parents face a chal-
lenge of understanding a complex text that in-
cludes assessment of the relevance of the re-
trieved information and ability to differentiate 
among available options. This necessitates, 
among other required skills, ability to discrimi-
nate between different degrees of certainty and 
evaluate the likelihood score found in the text 
(Holmes, 1982; Morante and Sporleder, 2012).         
 

3 Medical Forum Data 
To get a notion of the public concerns and ques-
tions, we automatically extracted and manually 
analyzed messages posted on medical forums 
and blogs dedicated to newborn screening for 
rare diseases.     
 
We selected 42 forums frequently visited by 
parents and families concerned about newborn 
screening and its consequences (e.g., fo-
rums.familyeducation.com,www.justmommies.c
om/babies/newborn,www.parentingforums.org
/forum.php). We did not require research ethics 
review for this study as all of the data collected 
and used was from publically available sources. 
Nevertheless, we confirmed with our institutional 
research ethics board that no review of research 
on public data sets was necessary. 

 
To find what parents think and discuss, we fol-
lowed two strategies to collect data: a manual 
search and automated crawling of parenting fo-
rums and blogs. In our manual data collection, 
we used Google to find blogs, comments and 
medical forums that could post messages with 
the relevant content. Our queries were built from 
all the possible combinations of the following 
three sets of phrases: 

• {Forum, Bulletin Board, Message Board, 
BBS, Threads} 

• {Newborn, infant} 
• {Genetic Predisposition Testing, Genetic 

Screening, Predictive Genetic Testing, 
Genome Sequencing} 
 

For instance, the query {newborn genetic 
screening threads} is used to search for the re-
lated forums. After finding relevant blogs or 
threads, we downloaded the comments.  

25



To download the comments we used Selenium 
API5, Hibernate API6, MySQL database, and 
Java programming language. In automatic data 
collection, we used Apache Nutc crawler appli-
cation7  in combination with Apache Solr search 
platform8 to crawl handpicked forums.   
 
First, we performed manual search to find fo-
rums with the related phrases mentioned above. 
Then we used URLs of the selected forums as a 
seed for Nutch.  We stored the collected HTML 
pages in MySQL database.  Next, we searched 
these pages with Apache Solr, which uses the 
cosine similarity metric to find related page to 
the search query: 
   

 
 
where A and B are the term frequency vectors of 
the query and a document.  We marked page as 
relevant if it contained any three-phrase combi-
nation built from three sets of phrases mentioned 
earlier in this section.  
 
After finding pages with relevant comments, 
their content was downloaded and analyzed in-
dependently by two authors. We found that par-
ents and other involved individuals are often 
concerned about the following issues: 
 

• Prevalence and severity  of the disease 
• Available treatment and the effects of an 

early treatment 
• A possible course of the disease  
• Reliable tests 
• Health care facilities  
• Medications and their side effects  
• Future use of the results

4 Epistemic expressions  

Our current project focuses on disambiguating 
epistemic modal expressions. Previously, several 
studies connected the use of modal verbs (can, 
might, should), amplifiers (certainly, definitely) 
with the level of expectation of an event (He-
nriksson and Velupillai, 2010; Sokolova and La-
palme, 2011).   
 
However, these studies did not categorize epis-
temic expressions based on their strength of con-
viction in the event happening. We categorize the 
strength of conviction by assigning six catego-
ries: impossible, improbable, uncertain, possible, 
probable, and certain (Horn, 1989; Sokolova et 
al, 2010).  Table 2 shows the categories and ex-
pressions. 
 
Table 2: Examples of epistemic expressions 

Epistemic category Expressions 
Impossible Never happens  
Improbable Hardly expected 
Uncertain  We unsure 
Possible  Perhaps 
Probable  There is a certain risk 
Certain  We always see 
 
The suggested six categories add three negative 
categories (impossible, improbable, uncertain) to 
common positive happenstance categories (poss-
ible, probable, certain) (R. Saurı´ and J. Puste-
jovsky, 2009).   
 
Language expressions corresponding to the cate-
gories contain extensional modifiers, i.e. modifi-
ers of degree and happenstance (Sokolova and 
Lapalme, 2011). The modifiers can be modal 
verbs (can, must, would), adverbs (likely, most-
ly), adjectives (common, rare) and quantifying 
pronouns (every, none).   These expressions 
should be disambiguated in the context of a sen-
tence or a clause.  
 
Below we categorize a few expressions found in 
articles on rare diseases:  
• Impossible: such  off-target gene modulat-

ing effects are currently impossible to pre-
dict 

• Improbable: in part out of concern that re-
cruitment of eligible subjects with SMA Type 
I would be difficult because of their high 

level of inter-current illness and mortality in 
childhood  

• Uncertain: these studies could not rule out 
an additional contribution resulting from 
restoration of SMN levels in muscle  

• Possible: raising the possibility that intrinsic 
responses to low levels of SMN in skeletal 
muscle may also contribute directly to SMA 
pathogenesis  

• Probable: Studies have shown that restoring 
SMN protein levels in neurons can signifi-
cantly ameliorate disease progression  

• Certain: A neighboring nearly-identical copy 
of this gene, SMN2, is invariably present in 
individuals with SMA  

 
Our next step was to assess the presence of epis-
temic expressions in articles on rare diseases. 

5 Empirical evidence 
For our preliminary study we decided on a group 
of articles dedicated to spinal muscular atrophy 
(SMA), a neurodegenerative disease affecting 1 
in 11000  newborns world- wide (Farooq et al, 
2013).   We selected six full-length research ar-
ticles. The articles were published in  Orphanet 
Journal of Rare Diseases, Neurodegenerative 
Diseases (an open source book), Journal of Clin-
ical Investigation, Plos One, and Human Molecu-
lar Genetics (2 articles).  

 
The articles’ content covers most of parent con-
cerns (see Table 1): a) severity of the disease, b) 
available treatment and the effects of an early 
treatment, c) a possible course of the disease, 
reliability of tests, d) medications. Thus, the ar-
ticle selection allows the empirical results to be 
representative of the information parents will 
find. At the same time, we cover language ex-
pressions belonging to different authors.   
 
Three articles were written by a team of leading 
researchers in SMA; these authors have written 
papers that receive a high rank in SMA search 
through Google Scholar; hence, there is a high 
probability that parents looking for the SMA in-
formation will first encounter papers published 
by this team (Articles A).  Three other articles 
were written by other teams working on SMA 
research (Articles B).   We report the descriptive 
statistics in Table 3; vocabulary signifies differ-
ent words in the text.

We looked for epistemic expressions related to 
the main concerns found on medical forums (see 
Table 1).   For the information retrieval, we built 
N-gram models of each article (N = 1, …, 4).  
We tokenized data by splitting along spaces and 
punctuation marks.  We kept the original capita-
lization to preserve the beginning of sentences. 
We used combinations of the seed words to find 
N-grams with the epistemic meaning. Table 4 
lists examples of the seed words.   
 
Table 4: Examples of words used in search of epis-
temic expressions. 

Part-of-speech Examples 
Adverbs Possibly, perhaps  
Adjectives Impossible 
Modal verbs Can, may, should  
Negations No, not 
Nouns absence, presence  
Quantifying pronouns  Every, none  

 
To avoid counting the same expression multiple 
times, we filtered out those bi-grams which first 
word overlaps with the second word of another 
epistemic bi-gram.  From the list of tri-grams, we 
filtered out those which first word overlaps with 
the third word of another epistemic tri-gram.   
For instance, we filtered out not be as a possible 
extension of may not. 
 

Manual analysis showed that the most fre-
quent bi- and tri-grams expressed negative and 
positive conviction, supporting the proposed ex-
pansion of epistemic categories by negative im-
possible, improbable and uncertain.    Table 5 
lists the most frequent epistemic bi- and tri-
grams found in the articles.

temic bi- and tri-grams per article.

We hypothesized that the use of the expressions 
closely relates to the content of the article.   For 
example, articles reporting on clinical trials, 
treatments, medications may have a high fre-
quency of epistemic expressions as due to neces-
sity of drawing conclusions and implications for 
future patients.    We list the topics of the six pa-
pers and frequencies of the top epistemic bi- and 
tri-grams in Table 6.

temic expressions (x10-3)

Looking at the topics of the papers, we can see

the largest frequency of the epistemic expres-
sions in the text.  

6 Parent Advisor 
In the medical domain, uncertainty and misun-
derstanding of information can imperil lives and 
incur significant costs on health care systems 
(McCoy et al, 2012).  Although a thirst for medi-
cal knowledge among non-medical readers has 
been documented (see Section 1), there are not 
many developed NLP tools and methods that 
help such readers to understand medical texts.  
 

Although epistemic disambiguation is important 
for text understanding, other text analysis tasks 
are essential in order to build an effective system 
that helps parents to understand medical publica-
tions related to rare diseases.   Hence, the pro-
posed system name is the Parent Advisor.  
 
We suggest that such the Parent Advisor is orga-
nized as a pipeline of NLP and Text Mining 
tools, each serving a special purpose (Figure 1): 
1. social media analyzer, to identify concept 

shift in parents’ concerns;  
2. article content classifier, to  select relevant 

articles for further analysis; 
3. relevant article ranker, to  evaluate the use-

fulness  of the selected articles;    
4. factual information extractor, to  retrieve in-

formation related to parents’ concerns  
5. epistemic disambiguator, to assess the re-

trieved  factual information.  
6. the output ranker, which ranks the factual 

information according to the assigned epis-
temic categories.  

 
We also suggest that human participation should 
be incorporated in the system functioning. To 
support the actuality of text analysis, parents can 
be surveyed and polled either on a regular basis 
or in relation to medical and health-related 
events (e.g., a new discovery, a proposed change 
in health care) (Fox, 2011).  Medical profession-
als should be involved in the article ranking, to 
ensure the quality of the selected publications. 
Additionally to standard text annotation, a team 
of communication and medical professionals can 
assist in the factual information extraction and 
epistemic disambiguation (Scott et al, 2012).

For a given query, the system will release the 
information ranked accordingly to the epistemic 
categories.  For example, the information 
deemed certain will be ranked higher than the 
information deemed probable or possible (Table 
7).  When releasing the information marked with 
negative categories, we plan to label it with 
“Caution”.

diseases, protein, therapy”.

7 Related Work 
 
The semantic analysis of biomedical and clinical 
texts mainly focuses on identification and disam-
biguation of medical terms and events (Cohen et 
al, 2011; Demner-Fushman et al, 2010; Savova 
et al, 2011) including temporal characteristics of 
events (Boytcheva et al, 2012).   Emergence of 
electronic health records enabled studies of epis-
temic expressions, often linking them with the 
diagnosis of a patient (McCoy et al, 2012; S. Ve-

lupillai’ 2010). Expressions of certainty in the 
medical publications, however, are not well stu-
died, although it is natural to expect a medical 
publication to contain epistemic expressions: 
while presenting factual information, a publica-
tion also conveys the authors’ inference from the 
facts and conviction in the event happenstance.    

 
Categorizing text into speculative and non-
speculative parts partially addresses the problem 
(Szarvas, 2008; Sanchez et al, 2010) as such di-
vision only differentiates the certain (aka non-
speculative) category from other epistemic cate-
gories.   We, however, want to analyze language 
expressions of several epistemic categories.    
 
Vagueness in clinical records was studied by 
Emanuel and Emanuel (1989) and more recently 
by Hyland (2006) and Scott et al (2012).  
These studies concentrate on the use of happens-
tance modifiers (Sokolova and Lapalme, 2011), 
also known as linguistic hedges (e.g., possible, 
probably, few, consistent with). The goal is to 
develop an automated analysis of diagnosis and 
symptom information extracted from electronic 
patient records (Scott et al, 2012). Although the 
task is similar to our goal, we plan to work with 
information extracted from medical publications. 
 
A more complex approach would be to introduce 
a pragmatic component into the epistemic analy-
sis of medical publications. This approach diffe-
rentiates between a hypothesis, accepted know-
ledge, and new experimental knowledge (Nawaz 
et al, 2010).  Such categorization may be useful 
in the recommender system designed for the 
general public. In future, we plan to work on the 
hypothesis - experimental knowledge division.  
 
Our work also closely relates to text understand-
ing and interpretation (Bos, 2011). With the de-
velopment of Internet search engines, text under-
standing and interpretation mainly focused on 
retrieval of texts relevant to the query. A few 
systems develop a more advanced and deep text 
exploration which interprets text on demand 
from the system users (Dunne et al, 2012). The 
systems are field-specific, often built on ontolo-
gy, and are designed to help professionals work-
ing in the field (Dunne et al, 2012; Wimalasuriya 
and Dou, 2010).   An advanced, semantically 
based information retrieval is performed by ques-
tion-answering systems.  In medicine, such sys-
tems assist clinicians to find clinically-relevant 
information (Cao et al, 2011).  Our goal, in con-

30



trast, is to build a system that helps the general 
public to understand professional medical text.   
 
Note that during the related work analysis, we 
could not find published studies that relate parent 
concerns to social media to rare disease informa-
tion. 

8 Future Work  

Our immediate future work will focus on ep-
istemic annotation of a large collection of 
SMA articles. What can be considered a suf-
ficient size of the annotated corpus is an 
open question in BioNLP: the physical che-
mistry and biochemistry Core Scientific 
Concepts corpus has 265 articles (Liakata, 
2010), the bioinformatics’ Bioscope corpus 
has 9 articles and 1273 abstracts (Vincze et 
al, 2008).  

We suggest that the number of annotated ar-
ticles can be linked to the annual rate of 
SMA publications. For example, the Google 
Scholar search for “spinal muscular atro-
phy” 10  retrieved 278 articles 11  published in 
2012 – 2013. A similar PubMed search12 re-
trieved 222 articles13

The article and abstract selection is another 
open question in the article annotation.  Our 
criterion is the corpus compliance with the 

. Hence, we aim to an-
notate 150 - 200 SMA articles and abstracts.   

We want the article profiles be representative 
of the concerns expressed on the medical fo-
rums (listed in Table 1). For example, after 
adding the term “treatment” to both search-
ers we retrieved 77 articles through Google 
Scholar and 99 articles through PubMed, 
while substituting “treatment” by “drugs” we 
retrieved 45 articles and 7 articles respective-
ly.  Thus, our annotated data should include 
60-80 treatment-oriented and 10-30 drug-
oriented articles and abstracts.

expected retrieval results of the Web search. 
Hence, for each topic, we will select articles 
based on their relevance.  

To ensure that the corpus is consistent with 
the public concerns, we will continue to ana-
lyze medical forums in order to keep updates 
on the general public response on newborn 
screening for rare diseases.   

9 Conclusions 
We presented a preliminary work on the system 
which we call Parent Advisor. Parent Advisor 
can help parents to understand medical publica-
tions related to rare diseases.  The topic of rare 
diseases became a subject of many discussions, 
as more and more jurisdictions adopted a policy 
of newborn screening for rare diseases.     

 
To make our future system actual and useful for 
parents, we have studied messages posted on 42 
medical forums. These forums are frequently 
visited by parents and families who have ques-
tions related to newborn screening for rare dis-
eases.    We identified several issues that concern 
the general public most (prevalence and severity  
of the disease, available treatment and the effects 
of an early treatment, a possible course of the 
disease, reliable tests, health care facilities, 
medications and their side effects, future use of 
the results).   
 
We chose epistemic disambiguation as the focus 
of our first sub-project in building Parent 
Advisor.  We identified six epistemic categories 
(impossible, improbable, uncertain, possible, 
probable, certain), thus expanding a usual range 
of  positive categories (possible, probable 
certain)  by negative categories (impossible, 
improbable, uncertain).  
 
In this paper, we also outlined the architecture of 
the system, sketched human-system collabora-
tion desirable for the system to be effective, and 
presented a detailed plan for future work.
