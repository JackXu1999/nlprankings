Abstract 

Closely related words tend to be close 

together in monolingual language use. 

This paper suggests that this is differ-

ent in bilingual language use. The Dis-

tance Hypothesis (DH) proposes that 

long dependency distances between 

syntactically related units facilitate bi-

lingual code-switching. We test the DH 

on a 9,023 word German/English and a 

19,766 word Chinese/English corpus. 

Both corpora support the DH in that 

they present longer mixed dependen-

cies than monolingual ones. Selected 

major dependency types (subject, ob-

ject, adjunct) also have longer depend-

ency distances when the head word and 

its dependent are from different lan-

guages. We discuss how processing 

motivations behind the DH make it a 

potentially viable motivator for bilin-

gual language use. 

1 Introduction 

Corpus linguistic, computational linguis-

tic and experimental language research 

has produced a considerable body of evi-

dence over the past thirty years that there 

is a preference for linguistically related 

words to be close together in monolingual 

sentences (Gildea and Temperley 2010). 

Hudson (1995), Gibson (1998, 2000), Liu 

(2008) and others have worked on this 

from the comprehension side; Hawkins 

(1994, 2004), Temperley (2008) and col-

laborators have addressed the production 

side.  

Most of this research captures the no-

tion of linguistically ‘closely related’ and 

‘close together’ with the concept of de-

pendency distance/length. Dependencies 

are asymmetric syntactic relations be-

tween two words, a head/governor and a 

dependent. The head of each dependency 

is then the dependent of another word (un-

less it is the root of the sentence), forming 

a recursive structure which connects all 

the words of the sentence. Dependencies 

are (a) of a certain type, (b) directed, and 

(c) have a length.  

(a) Dependencies can be semantic, mor-

phological and/or syntactic. In this paper 

we are only looking at syntactic depend-

encies; the arrows representing dependen-

cies are therefore labelled for grammatical 

functions, e.g. subject, adjunct etc. 

(b) Dependency arrows point from the 

head to the dependent. Many languages 

have a dominant dependency direction: 

Arabic is predominantly head initial, 

Turkish head final; other languages like 

English, German and Chinese are more or 

less mixed. 

(c) Every arrow spans a specific number 

of words (unless it indicates the root of 

the sentence). The linear distance between 

a head and its dependent, measured in 

terms of intervening words, is the depend-

ency relation’s distance
1
 (Hudson 1995). 

The Mean Dependency Distance (MDD) 

of a sentence/text is the sum of its indi-

vidual distances divided by the number of 

its dependencies. 

Dependency distance (DD) is an im-

portant property of dependencies because 

of its implications for language produc-

tion/processing. Constructing and inter-

preting sentences involves incrementally 

connecting words to arrive at meaning. 

                                                           
1 Dependency distance can be quantified in differ-

ent ways. Gibson (1998), for example, quantifies 

it in terms of new intervening discourse referents.  

78



This process consumes human/ computa-

tional resources; it is ‘costly’. DD has 

been shown to correlate with the cognitive 

cost of processing syntactic relations in 

terms of the memory resources required to 

keep track of incomplete dependencies 

(Gibson 1998, 2000; Hudson 2010: 279); 

and in terms of the cost of connecting a 

new/incoming word to syntactically relat-

ed ones. The computational cost of inte-

grating a word into sentence structure has 

been shown to depend on the distance be-

tween a word and the most local head or 

dependent to which it attaches (Depend-

ency Locality Theory DLT, Gibson 2000). 

The DLT predicts that structures with 

longer dependencies are more difficult to 

process. It can account for a number of 

processing complexity phenomena, e.g. 

the relative ease of subject- vs. object-

extracted relative clauses; ambiguity reso-

lution in e.g. prepositional phrase attach-

ment decisions, heaviness effects, and 

processing overload effects of multiple 

center-embedded structures. 

Considerations of parsing complexity 

have also been proposed to affect lan-

guage production (Hawkins 1994, 2004, 

Temperley 2008). Synchronically and on 

the level of the individual speaker this 

seems to manifest itself mainly in phe-

nomena of syntactic choice, e.g. default 

word order vs. extraction/extraposition 

(Temperley 2008); diachronically Liu 

(2009) and Gildea and Temperley (2010) 

suggest dependency length minimization 

may also play a role in the shaping of 

grammars, i.e. language evolution. 

As DD has implications for the cost of 

language processing, factors influencing 

dependency length need to be considered. 

Liu (2008) suggests that projectivity, no 

crossing arches in the dependency graph 

of a sentence, influences DD. Liu com-

pared the MDDs of natural languages with 

those of artificial random languages, pro-

jective and non-projective ones. He found 

that non-projective artificial grammars 

have the longest MDD, followed by pro-

jective artificial languages and natural 

ones. Liu interprets his results as showing 

“the usefulness of a no-crossing approach 

to dependency length reduction” (Liu 

2008: 14) and the reduced DD of natural 

languages as a consequence of projectivi-

ty (see also Gildea and Temperley 2010: 

307). Most well-formed strings in natural 

languages are projective (Marcus 2007: 

159).  

Another factor that has been proposed 

to influence DD is dependency direction. 

If each word in a sentence has exactly one 

dependent, uniformly head-first or head-

last structures yield shorter dependency 

distances than ones with pre- and post-

dependents (Frazier 1985, Hawkins 1994, 

Rijkhoff 1994). Predominantly head-first 

or head last-languages, such as Arabic and 

Japanese, should therefore have the short-

est MDDs. Liu (2010) has shown that this 

is not the case. The reason is that words 

can and do have more than one dependent.  

If a word has more than one dependent, 

and the grammar requires all dependents 

to point in the same direction, and there is 

syntactic choice in terms of constituent 

order (e.g. a verb that has two preposi-

tional dependents), placing the shorter 

dependent (phrase) closer to the head re-

sults in shorter dependencies. Hawkins 

(1994, 2004) reports that the preference of 

placing the shorter dependent closer to the 

head is found in head-first and head-last 

languages.  

If a head has several dependents, plac-

ing all of them on the same side of the 

head creates a kind of ‘crowding’ effect. 

German subordinate clauses, which are 

head final (rather than V2), illustrate that 

all dependents of the verbal head (haben) 

crowd to its left.  

(1) 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

In this case, there is no word order choice; 

if there was, placing some dependents to 

the left and some of the right of the verb 

would result in a shorter MDD. If a head 

has several dependents, balancing them on 

either side of the head results in shorter 

dependency lengths (Temperley 2008).  

Languages that have a prevailing de-

pendency direction but allow some short 

dependent phrases to branch in the oppo-

site direction have shorter MDDs than 

consistently same branching languages

(Dryer 1992, Liu 2010). English is gener-

ally regarded as a predominantly head-

first language. In the Penn Treebank, 

however, only 48.8% of the English de-

pendencies are head-first; German was 

found to be, on average, 54.5% head-first 

and Chinese 31.5% (Liu 2010: 1571). Of 

the three languages we are looking at in 

this study, English has the best balance 

between left and right dependents and 

should therefore have the shortest MDD 

(followed by German and then Chinese). 

Section 5 presents empirical support for 

this hypothesis. 

So far we have established that DD is 

an appropriate and widely used measure 

for establishing the linear proximity of 

linguistically related words. DD can 

therefore be used to test whether closely 

related words tend to be close together in 

monolingual and bilingual language use. 

Other properties of dependencies, the type 

of relationship they encode and their di-

rection, were discusses as factors influ-

encing dependency distance. Most im-

portantly, the effect DD seems to have on 

the computational resources required for 

language processing and production was 

reviewed. Keeping track of long incomplete 

dependencies is a burden on memory load, and 

the cost of linking a new word into sentence 

structure - by connecting it to a head and/or 

dependent - also seems to be influenced by DD 

(Gibson 1998, 2000).  

In the next section we will look at DD in the 

three languages involved in our data. 

2 DD in English, German and 
Chinese 

MDDs differ cross-linguistically. Alt-

hough there is considerable variation in 

the type of language data analyzed to date 

(spoken, written; formal, informal) and 

ways in which distance is measured and 

calculated
2
, there is a surprising amount 

of agreement as to which languages have 

short, and which ones have long DDs. 

Out of the three languages we are look-

ing at, we anticipated English to have the 

shortest MDD, followed by German and 

                                                           
2 Eppler (2010) and Hiranuma (1999) measure dependen-

cy distance in terms of the number of intervening words; 

Liu (2008, 2009, 2010) in terms of the difference be-

tween the words’ position numbers. Liu (2009) found the 

resulting difference in MDD to be small (1.81 vs. 1.89). 

Chinese. This is exactly what Liu (2008: 

10) found: English (2.54) has a shorter 

MDD than German (3.35) and Chinese 

(3.66). Features of the three grammars 

that may account for this difference length 

will be looked at next. 

The fact that English has fairly fixed 

word order and a prevailing dependency 

direction (head-first), but allows some 

short dependent phrases to branch in the 

opposite direction, seems to account for 

the short MDD of English (1.39, 1.49, 

1.67 in Hiranuma’s (1999), Eppler’s 

(2010) and Wang and Liu’s (2013) spoken 

data; 2.30 and 2.54 in the written data an-

alysed by Gildea and Temperley (2010: 

301) and Liu (2008: 12). In English, most 

words that are syntactically related are 

also adjacent; between 63% according to 

Collins (1996), 76% according to Pake 

(1998) and 78% according to Eppler 

(2010), but only slightly over 50% ac-

cording to Liu (2008).  

The mean distance between two 

syntactically related German words is 

longer than the mean distance between 

two related English words: 1.87 according 

to Eppler (2010), 3.07 according to Gildea 

and Temperley (2010), and 3.35 according 

to Liu (2008). The main reasons why 

German has a longer mean distance are 

the generally freer word order; the 

discontinuity between auxiliaries and their 

verbal complements (the Verbalklammer); 

and the different word orders in main 

(V2) and subordinate clauses (SOV). 

According to Liu (2008: 17) German has 

more adjacent dependencies than both 

Chinese and English. 

Chinese has the longest MDD, not only 

of the three languages we are looking at in 

this paper, but also of the 20 languages 

Liu (2008) compared: 2.85 in spoken 

news data (Wang & Liu’s 2013:  63), and 

3.66 in written news data (Penn Chinese 

Treebank; Liu 2008: 12). The facts that 

Chinese has fewer mixed (head-first/head-

last) dependencies than German and Eng-

lish and that Chinese is an isolating lan-

guage, which marks e.g. tense, number 

and aspect with free (rather than inflec-

tional) morphemes, has a significant  in-

fluence on dependency length and the 

number of dependencies in a text.  

80



This brief cross-linguistic discussion of 

dependency length in English, German 

and Chinese has shown that rigidity of 

word order, consistency of dependency 

direction, and language type (isolating, 

inflecting) impact on a language’s MDD. 

Collins (1996), Pake (1998), Eppler 

(2010) and Liu (2008) have looked into 

the relationship between dependency 

length and adjacency. These preliminary 

findings are difficult to interpret and more 

work needs to be done on this in the fu-

ture. 

The comparison of MDDs in different 

data sets furthermore supports the idea 

that DD is positively correlated with style 

(Liu et al. 2009: 171, Temperley 2008). 

Casual speech has shorter distances than 

more formal speech and writing, even 

when of the same genre (e.g. news, Liu 

2009, Wang and Liu 2013). The average 

difference in dependency length between 

spoken and written data in English, Ger-

man and Chinese is approximately one 

(1.02), with little variation between the 

three languages (Chinese 0.81, English 

0.91 and German 1.34). 

In the next sections we will look at bi-

lingual data, speech which is constructed 

from lexical items and grammatical struc-

tures from typologically different lan-

guages (English and German, English and 

Chinese). We will test whether syntacti-

cally related words from different lan-

guages also prefer to be close together, or 

whether long dependency distances facili-

tate code-switching (DH); i.e. we will in-

vestigate the effects of DD on syntactic 

code-switching. 

3 The data 

The present paper is based on two bilin-

gual corpora, a 9,023 word sample of a 

93,235 word corpus of German/English 

(Eppler 2003), and a 19,766 word corpus 

of Chinese/English (Wang & Liu 2013). 

Both data sets were analyzed in the same 

dependency theoretic framework (Hudson 

2007, 2010). 

The German/English data was recorded 

in January 1993 among a close-knit net-

work of members of the German-speaking 

Jewish refugee community who settled in 

London in the late 1930s. All speakers 

included in this sample are female and in 

their late sixties or early seventies. Their 

L1 is Austrian German. The age of onset 

of their L2, British English, was during 

adolescence (15-21 years of age) for all 

speakers. In informal settings like the 

ones recorded, the participants use a bi-

lingual mode of interaction sometimes 

called ‘Emigranto’ (Eppler 2010). Lin-

guistically this mixed code is character-

ized by frequent switching at speaker turn 

boundaries and heavy intra-sentential 

code-switching. The audio data were tran-

scribed in the CHAT/LIDES (LIPPS 

Group 2000) format. The transcripts were 

manually annotated for word class, dependen-

cy type, dependency direction and dependency 

distance. See Table 1 for a summary of the 

data. 

The Chinese/English data (Wang and Liu 

2013) were audio-recorded from mainland 

China and Hong Kong TV or broadcasting 

programs from June to September 2011. Ap-

proximately 20% of the data are from inter-

view programs; about 80% of the materials are 

news, social news, and entertainment news. 

Intra-sententially code-switched sentences 

were selected from the data, transcribed and 

syntactically annotated to build a Treebank 

containing the following information: linear 

position of the head and the dependent in the 

sentence, word class, language and a selected 

number of dependency types. The MDD of the 

corpus and of individual dependency types 

were calculated from the Treebank using for-

mulae proposed by Liu (2009). See Table 1 for 

a summary of the data.

4 The Distance Hypothesis 

In monolingual dependencies the head and 

the dependent are from the same lan-

guage; in ‘mixed’ dependencies they are 

from different languages. The main point 

of interest for this paper is whether the 

MDDs of monolingual and mixed depend-

encies are similar or different. If they are 

significantly different, DD may have an 

effect on intra-sentential code-switching.  

Theoretically the MDDs of mixed de-

pendencies can be shorter, intermediate or 

longer than the MDDs of the monolingual  

81



dependencies. They would, for example, 

be shorter, if code-switching consumed 

additional processing resources which are 

counterbalanced by the reduced pro-

cessing cost of short dependencies (Gib-

son 2000). Dussias (2001) found that 

complexity and switch frequency are in-

versely related. As the German/English 

data is heavily switched, its production is 

expected to have incurred not additional 

resources. Mixed MDDs might be between 

monolingual means, because syntactic 

dependency properties of both languages 

are involved. Or they might be longer, if 

the influence of a word’s language on that 

of its dependent reduces with increased 

distance. In activation-based frameworks 

the activation level of a word and its 

properties (e.g. its sense or language) will 

decay with distance. Comprehension stud-

ies have shown that structural integration 

involves reactivating a word to a target 

threshold level so that aspects relevant for 

its integration can be retrieved from 

memory. This reactivation is not only 

costly (Gibson 1998), but may also be 

incomplete; information about a word’s 

properties may degrade partially or com-

pletely. If we assume similar processes to 

drive production
3
, we may hypothesise 

that long dependency distances (DD ≥ 2) 

increase the likelihood of an ‘other’ 

language dependent, i.e. a code-switch 

(DH). 

A decay in activation levels of 

syntactically related words over distance 

is assumed to be the motivating factor 

behind code-switching. Both the head and 

the dependent need to be - or be made - active 

at the point in language production when the 

dependency between them is being established. 

Activation levels of words (and their 

properties) decay as intervening words are 

being produced. In long dependencies the 

processing load is therefore high (Gibson 

1998, 2000) and the priming effect between 

the head and the dependent low. Mixed 

dependencies/code-switches may result 

from long DDs because the influence the 

head and the dependent have on each oth-

er decreases with increased distance. The 

                                                           
3 Dussias’ (2002: 98) study of the psycholinguistic com-

plexity of code-switching revealed “a relatively clean 

convergence from [...] corpus analysis [which reflects 

production data] and on-line comprehension effects”. 

DH is a syntactic processing hypothesis; 

evidence in its support would therefore 

shed light on grammatical and processing 

aspects of code-switching. 

5 MDDs in the two corpora 

The MDDs for monolingual and mixed 

dependencies in the German/English and 

Chinese/English copra are presented in 

Table 2.

Table 2: MDDs of monolingual and mixed depend-

encies with German, English and Chinese heads  
 

The results for monolingual German and 

English support the hypothesis that mono-

lingual German dependencies will be 

longer than monolingual English ones 

(made on the basis of the word order 

properties of the two languages in Section 

2), and findings by Liu (2008) and Gildea 

and Temperley (2010).  

The mean distances of mixed 

dependencies with a German head either 

indicate that heads do not have a more 

significant effect on dependency distance 

than dependents, or that German verbs, 

the word class that increases German 

MDD through bi-directional long-distance 

dependencies, are infrequently involved in 

mixed dependencies with a German head.  

The mean distance of mixed dependen-

cies with an English head suggests that 

English words enter into more remote syn-

tactic relations with German dependents. 

We therefore expect a) English words to 

‘head’ more dependency relations that are 

characterized by long distances (adjuncts, 

extractees and extraposees); and b) Ger-

man dependents of English heads to be 

more frequently located at the clause pe-

riphery (Treffers-Daller 1994, Muysken 

2000). 

The highly significant difference be-

tween monolingual and mixed dependency 

distances (p<0.001) supports the idea that 

DD affects code-switching. 

The recent analysis of a 19,766 word Chi-

nese/English corpus (Wang and Liu 2013) 

supports the DH and has revealed interesting 

similarities and differences between the Ger-

man/ English and Chinese/English data.  

82



Chinese dependencies are longer than Eng-

lish ones (p<0.005). This was expected from 

the morphological and word-order properties 

of the two languages (Section 2) and supports 

findings by Liu (2008, 2009). 

The MDD of mixed dependencies with a 

Chinese (L1) head and an English (L2) de-

pendent is longer than that of monolingual 

Chinese dependencies (p<0.001; this is differ-

ent to what we found in the German/English 

data), and also longer than the MDD of mixed 

dependencies with an English head and a Chi-

nese dependent (p<0.05).  

MDD increases more from monolingual 

English to mixed with an English head (+1.14) 

than from monolingual Chinese to mixed with 

a Chinese head (+ 0.69). This is similar to what 

we found in the German/English data, where 

the MDD between monolingual English and 

mixed dependencies with an English head in-

creases by (+ 0.77); the MDD between mono-

lingual German and mixed dependencies with 

a German head is virtually the same. Heads 

from the speakers’ L1s (German and Chinese) 

therefore hold their dependents ‘tighter’ than 

L2 heads. 

The mean distance of mixed dependencies 

with an English (L2) head and a Chinese (L1) 

dependent is also longer than that of monolin-

gual English dependencies, but the difference 

is not quite as marked as in the Ger-

man/English data (p<0.05 vs. p<0.001).  

The average MDD of mixed dependencies 

(3.18) is longer than that of monolingual de-

pendencies (2.26), and the average MDDs of 

mixed dependencies is longer than the MDDs 

of both English and Chinese monolingual de-

pendencies (p<0.05).  

In summary, the comparison of the MDDs 

from the German/English and Chinese/English 

data (Table 2) shows that  

- MDDs are cross-linguistically different with 

English having the shortest MDD, followed by 

German and Chinese 

- monolingual dependencies in mixed corpora 

are not significantly different to those found in 

comparable monolingual corpora 

- the average MDDs of mixed dependencies 

are significantly longer than those of monolin-

gual dependencies. 

The patterns in the Chinese/English da-

ta (Wang and Liu 2013) largely corre-

spond to those in the German/English da-

ta. Most importantly, greater DD also 

seems to increase chances of code-

switching in Chinese/English bilingual 

speech. The findings from a typologically 

different language pair and data set there-

fore support the hypothesis that long DDs 

affect the language of dependents in that they 

render other language dependents more likely 

(DH).  

6 MDDs of individual dependency 
types 

In this section we will compare individual de-

pendency types from the two data sets in 

terms of distance. The German/English 

data were analysed for the full range of 

syntactic relations used in Word Grammar 

(Hudson 2010). The Chinese/English data 

were analysed for four syntactic relations 

(subjects, objects, attributes and adverbi-

als – both of the latter two are considered 

as adjuncts in the German/English data). 

To facilitate the comparison, we will fo-

cus on subjects, objects, and adjuncts. 

Section 6.1 briefly looks at monolingual 

dependencies, Section 6.2 compares mon-

olingual L1 dependencies with mixed de-

pendencies with an L1 head, and Section 

6.3 compares monolingual L2 dependen-

cies with mixed dependencies with an L2 

head. The findings support the main idea 

outlined in the Section 5, the DH, and re-

lated findings from the code-switching 

literature (Treffers-Daller 1994, Mahoo-

tian and Santorini 1996, Muysken 2000).  

6.1 Monolingual dependencies 

Table 3 illustrates how individual depend-

ency types contribute to the average DD 

of 1.87 for monolingual German and 1.49 

for monolingual English dependencies in 

the German/English data.

The column entries of Table 3 demon-

fer cross-linguistically (Liu 2008, 2009) 

83



and that the German/English bilinguals’ 

grammars seem to be intact in terms of 

topological fields: there are no English 

left-dependent objects (nor x-comps). The 

MDDs that differ most significantly be-

tween German and English are subjects 

(and x-comps). These differences are 

caused by the subjects of clause-final fi-

nite verbs (which are at almost opposite 

ends of subordinate clauses) and the Ver-

balklammer. Gildea and Temperley (2010: 

301) also found that verb position con-

tributes to the longer dependency distanc-

es in German, but stress that it is not spe-

cifically the distance from subject to verb 

that results in this effect. Given that sub-

jects tend to be short and can frequently 

be placed on either side of the verb in 

German (s< or >s), this finding is in line 

with the interrelation between dependency 

direction and distance discussed in Sec-

tion 1. 

The biggest difference in mean distances be-

tween monolingual Chinese and English also 

lies in the subject relation (p<0.001).

Table 4. MDDs and frequencies of four monolingual 

Chinese and English dependency types 

 

Chinese prepositional constructions, such as 

bei, ba, jiang or ge and the complement of di, 

which are used as adverbials, must follow the 

subject but precede the modified verb; this in-

creases the DD between the subject and the 

root of Chinese sentences, as in Example (2) 

where the DD between the subject wo and the 

verb dang is 3 in Chinese; the DD between I 

and treat, on the other hand, is only 1.  

(2) wo ba ta dang pengyou. 

   I PREP him treat friend 

‘I treat him as my friend.’ 

Wang and Liu (2013) found longer MDD of 

Chinese objects in comparison with English 

ones (p<0.001). Tense is realized by inflec-

tional morphology in English; in Chinese tense 

is usually handled by function words which 

separate the object and the head. In Example 

(3) the DD between the object book and its 

head bought is 2. In Chinese, the DD between 

mai and shu is 4, because the complement of 

the classifiers zhe and ben and the perfect-

tense auxiliary le intervene between the object 

and its verbal head. 

(3) wo mai le zhe-ben shu. 

   I buy AUX this-CL book    

   ‘I bought the book.’  

Examples like these raise the question 

what size unit DD should be measured in. 

6.2 Monolingual L1 and mixed de-
pendencies with an L1 head  

Table 5 shows that in the German/English 

data the distances for most mixed syntac-

tic relations (subjects, adjuncts and post-

dependent objects) are longer than their 

monolingual German equivalents.

Table 6. MDDs and frequencies of monolingual 

German and mixed dependencies with a G head 
 

The slightly shorter mean distance of 

mixed dependencies with a German head 

is mainly due to the large number of bor-

rowed English nouns complements of 

German determiners (> c: G-G MDD 1.65 

(155) vs. G-E MDD 1.1 (309)).  

That English post-dependent adjuncts 

are, on average, two words further away 

from their German head than monolingual 

German ones supports the notion that 

code-switching is favoured in adjoined 

peripheral positions (Treffers-Daller 

1998, Mahootian and Santorini 1996, 

Muysken 2000), as in Example (3). 
(3) 

*MEL: ich bin draussen # as per usual. 

%tra: I    am  out         

Jen2.cha: line 185. 

The MDD of mixed adverbials with a Chinese 

head is also much longer than that of monolin-

gual Chinese adverbials (p<0.001), see Table7.

Table 7. MDDs and frequencies of monolingual Chinese 

and mixed dependencies with a Chinese head  

 

The Chinese/English corpus furthermore con-

tains data that support the notion that code-

84



switching is favoured in clause peripheral posi-

tions. In Example (4) the English subject fans 

is dislocated from its default position 

(preceding zhuanmen) and moved to the left 

clause periphery. Because of extraposition and 

obligatory pre-posing of prepositional phrases 

before the verb, the distance between fans and 

its Chinese head jisong is 6; in the 

corresponding monolingual Chinese sentence, 

the distance between the Chinese subject 

fensimen and its head jisong is only 2.  
(4) Fans  weile     xiang  ta   zhijing         zhuanmen  

jisong  xianhua. 

      Fans  in order to  to   him  pay their respects specially    

posted  flowers 

‘In order to pay their respects to him, fans specially 

posted flowers.’  

 
In Section 2 we suggested that the mean 

distance of mixed dependencies with a 

German head might be shorter than the 

mean distance of monolingual German 

dependencies because the word class that 

increases DD through a change in depend-

ency direction, German verbal heads, is 

infrequently involved in mixed dependen-

cies. An analysis of all German verbs in 

the German/English data revealed that, 

overall, German verbs are not significant-

ly less frequently involved in mixed de-

pendencies than monolingual ones 

(p=0.112). The same holds true for Ger-

man main verbs (p=0.192). German auxil-

iaries and modals, however, are signifi-

cantly more frequently involved in mixed 

dependencies than English ones 

(p<0.001). German auxiliaries are fre-

quently in the V2 topological field in 

German, a position that frequently coin-

cides with SVO. German AUX/MOD are 

therefore placed in congruence sites (Seb-

ba 1998). Congruence sites have been 

identified as facilitators of code-switching 

(Muysken 2000).  

6.3 Monolingual L2 and mixed de-
pendencies with an L2 head  

In Section 5 we suggested that mixed de-

pendencies may be the result of distance. 

As a consequence of their long DDs, 

code-switches were expected to be more 

frequently located at the clause periphery 

in predominantly SVO and V2 languages.  

More specifically, on the basis of the 

MMDs in the German/English data (Table 

2) we proposed that English heads may 

enter into ‘looser’, literally more remote, 

syntactic relations with German depend-

ents. We anticipated English words to 

‘head’ more dependencies that are charac-

terised by long distances, i.e. adjunct, ex-

tractee and extraposee relations, and pre-

dicted more German dependents of Eng-

lish heads to be located at the left or right 

clause periphery (Treffers-Daller 1994). 

This is what we find in the data.

Table 8. MDDs and frequencies of monolingual 

English and mixed dependencies with an E head; 

extraposee and extractee > x <  

Table 8 demonstrates that all mixed de-

pendencies with an English head (apart 

from objects) are longer than their mono-

lingual English counterparts (this is unlike 

the MDDs of monolingual German and 

mixed dependencies with a German head; 

Table 6). Table 8 furthermore illustrates 

that all dependency relations that yield a 

significantly higher number of mixed to-

kens than monolingual ones (German ad-

juncts, extractees), are further away from 

their English heads than their English 

counterparts. This finding supports the 

DH. 

Table 8 shows that the adjunct relation 

is very popular for switching between an 

English head and a German dependent. 

(5) 
*MEL: als kind I didn't like anything   

           aber I love food . 

%tra:   as a child I didn’t like anything  

           but I love food  

   Jen2.cha, line 2058 

The pre-adjunct in (5) is also moved out 

of its default word order position and ex-

tracted to the left clause periphery, which 

increases its DD by 4.  

Example (6) illustrates a German long-

distance clausal extraction.  

(6)    was die Dorit wieder geschmissen hat,  
 I [/]  I would have liked . 

85



It appears that for reasons of syntactic 

choice (Temperley 2008), speaker MEL 

increases the distance of a mixed depend-

ency relation from zero to six in Example 

(6).  

The hypothesis that L2 heads predomi-

nantly enter ‘looser’ longer syntactic rela-

tions with L1 dependents is also supported 

by the Chinese/English data, both numeri-

cally and in terms of DD.

Table 9. MDDs of four monolingual English and mixed 

dependencies with an English head 

 

The MDDs of all mixed dependencies 

with an English head is longer than that of 

monolingual English dependencies of the 

same type, and there are significantly 

(p<0.001) more switched Chinese adjuncts 

(Atr and Adv) than subjects and objects, 

like in the German/English data. Note, 

however, that the increase in MDD be-

tween monolingual and mixed dependen-

cies is bigger in subjects and objects than 

in adverbials. This may indicate that, if 

close syntactic relations are switched, 

their distance may have to be even longer. 

The distance between the Chinese subject 

tamen and its head is 2 in Example (7), in its 

English translation the DD between they and 

send is only 1. 

(7) Tamen tiantian  send E-mails. 

They  everyday send  

‘They send E-mails everyday.’ 

In Example (8) the distance of understand and 

its object yiqie is 5; in its English translation 

the distance of understand-everything is 1. 
(8) I fully understand ni  gaosu  ta     de    yiqie 

                                   you  tell    him AUX  everything 

     ‘I fully understand everything that you tell him.’ 

The hypothesis that greater DD of syntac-

tic relations increases the chances of 

code-switching appears to apply particu-

larly to mixed dependencies with an L2 

head. Mixed syntactic relations with an 

L2 head seem to pose a particular produc-

tion difficulty for the German/English and 

Chinese/English bilinguals alike, and the 

activation of L2 heads appears to decay 

more rapidly than that of L1 heads. This 

seems to render the retrieval of features of 

the L2 head (e.g. its language) from 

memory more difficult and lead to the 

significantly larger number of mixed long 

distance syntactic relation with an L2 

head in both corpora. The findings from 

the German/English data presented in Ta-

ble 8 and those from the Chinese/English 

Treebank (Table 9) also support the no-

tion that code-mixing is favoured in pe-

ripheral and adjoined positions (Treffers-

Daller 1994, Mahootian and Santorini 

1996, Mysken 2000).  

7 Summary and Conclusion 

We started from a well-established princi-

ple of monolingual language comprehen-

sion and production: closely related words 

tend to be close together in the sentence. 

We then suggested that this may be dif-

ferent in bilingual language use, i.e. that 

DD has an effect on whether both words 

in a dependency come from the same lan-

guage or not. The Distance Hypothesis 

proposes that long dependency distances 

increase the likelihood of an ‘other’ lan-

guage dependent, a code-switch. This syn-

tactic processing claim is based on the 

rationale that both the head and the depend-

ent need to be active at the point in the produc-

tion process when the syntactic relation be-

tween them is being established. If the head 

and the dependent are far apart, the influence 

(priming effect) of a word’s language on 

that of its dependent will decay with 

time/distance (the number of words inter-

vening between them). The longer the de-

pendency link, the less the priming influence, 

and the more likely a change in language.  

The analysis of a 9,023 word corpus of 

German/English monolingual and bilin-

gual speech revealed that mixed depend-

encies have a longer MDD than monolin-

gual ones. In a 19,766 word corpus of a 

typologically very different language pair, 

Chinese/English, mixed dependencies also 

have longer MDDs than monolingual ones 

(Wang and Liu 2013). The MDDs of both 

corpora thus support the DH.  

The analysis of individual syntactic re-

lations in both corpora revealed that, with 

86



one exception in the Chinese/English cor-

pus and three in the German/English data, 

all mixed dependency relations are, on 

average, longer than the corresponding 

monolingual ones. Both corpora contain 

considerable numbers of long-distance 

mixed adjuncts, and in the Ger-

man/English data L2 heads predominantly 

enter into mixed long-distance syntactic 

relations that are not essential for building 

sentence structures (adjunction, extraction 

and extraposition). When L1 subjects and 

objects of L2 verbs are switched in the 

Chinese/English data, they have especial-

ly long dependency distances. In lan-

guages in which root verbs tend to occupy 

central sentence positions (SVO or V2), 

such as English, German and Chinese, 

long distance dependents will be located 

near the clause periphery. That code-

switching is favoured in clause-peripheral 

positions has already been established in 

bilingualism research (Treffers-Daller 

1994, Muysken 2000). The DH however, 

captures this notion on a more general 

syntactic processing level. 

The results from the German/English 

and Chinese English data are promising. 

To establish DD between syntactically 

related units as a viable motivator for 

code-switching, the DH will have be test-

ed on other bilingual corpora and with 

controlled psycholinguistic experiments to 

establish, e.g. that distance has similar 

effects in comprehension and production.
