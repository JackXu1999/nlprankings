Abstract

We present BreakingNews, a novel dataset
with approximately 100K news articles in-
cluding images, text and captions, and en-
riched with heterogeneous meta-data (e.g.
GPS coordinates and popularity metrics).
The tenuous connection between the im-
ages and text in news data is appropriate to
take work at the intersection of Computer
Vision and Natural Language Processing
to the next step, hence we hope this dataset
will help spur progress in the field.

1 Introduction

Current successes in the crossroads between NLP
and computer vision indicate that the techniques
are mature for more challenging objectives than
those posed by existing datasets. The NLP com-
munity has been addressing tasks such as senti-
ment analysis, popularity prediction, summariza-
tion, source identification or geolocation to name
a few, that have been relatively little explored in
computer vision. BreakingNews is a large-scale
dataset1 of news articles with rich meta-data and,
we believe, an excellent benchmark for taking
joint vision and language developments a step fur-
ther. In contrast to existing datasets, the link be-
tween images and text in BreakingNews is not
as direct, i.e., the objects, actions and attributes
of the images may not explicitly appear as words
in the text (see example in Fig. 1). The visual-
language connections are more subtle and learn-
ing them will require the development of new in-
ference tools able to reason at a higher and more
abstract level. Furthermore, besides tackling ar-
ticle illustration or image captioning tasks, the

proposed dataset is intended to address new chal-
lenges, such as source/media agency detection, es-
timation of GPS coordinates, or popularity predic-
tion (which we annotate based on the reader com-
ments and number of re-tweets).

In (Ramisa et al., 2016) we present several base-
line results for different tasks using this dataset.

2 Description of the Dataset

The BreakingNews dataset consists of approxi-
mately 100,000 articles published between the 1st
of January and the 31th of December of 2014. All
articles include at least one image, and cover a
wide variety of topics, including sports, politics,
arts, healthcare or local news.

The main text of the articles was downloaded
using the IJS newsfeed (Trampuš and Novak,
2012), which provides a clean stream of semanti-
cally enriched news articles in multiple languages
from a pool of rss feeds.

We restricted the articles to those that were writ-
ten in English, contained at least one image, and
originated from a shortlist of highly-ranked news
media agencies (see Table 1) to ensure a degree of

consistency and quality. Given the geographic dis-
tribution of the news agencies, most of the dataset
is made of news stories in English-speaking coun-
tries in general, and the UK in particular. For each
article we downloaded the images, image captions
and user comments from the original article web-
page. News article images are quite different from
those in existing captioned images datasets like
Flickr8K (Hodosh et al., 2013) or MS-COCO (Lin
et al., 2014): often include close-up views of a per-
son (46% of the pictures in BreakingNews contain
faces) or complex scenes. Furthermore, news im-
age captions use a much richer vocabulary than in
existing datasets (e.g. Flickr8K has a total of 8,918
unique tokens, while eight thousand random cap-
tions from BreakingNews already have 28,028),
and they rarely describe the exact contents of the
picture.

We complemented the original article images
with additional pictures downloaded from Google
Images, using the full title of the article as search
query. The five top ranked images of sufficient
size in each search were downloaded as potentially
related images (in fact, the original article image
usually appears among them).

Regarding measures of article popularity, we
downloaded all comments in the article page and
the number of shares on different social networks
(e.g. Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn) if this informa-
tion was available. Whenever possible, in addi-
tion to the full text of the comments, we recovered
the thread structure, as well as the author, pub-
lication date, likes (and dislikes) and number of
replies. Since there were no share or comments
information available for "The Irish Independent",
we searched Twitter using the full title and col-
lected the tweets that mentioned a name associ-
ated with the newspaper (e.g. @Independent_ie,
Irish Independent, @IndoBusiness) or with links
to the original article in place of comments. We
considered the collective number of re-tweets as
shares of the article. The IJS Newsfeed annotates

the articles with geolocation information both for
the news agency and for the article content. This
information is primarily taken from the provided
RSS summary, but sometimes it is not available
and then it is inferred from the article using heuris-
tics such as the location of the publisher, TLD
country, or the story text. Fig. 2 shows a distri-
bution of news story geolocation.

Finally, the dataset is annotated for convenience
with shallow and deep linguistic features (e.g. part
of speech tags, inferred semantic topics, named
entity detection and resolution, sentiment analy-
sis) with XLike 2 and Enrycher 3 NLP pipelines.
