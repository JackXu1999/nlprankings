Abstract

The paper investigates the problem of
sentence readability assessment, which is
modelled as a classification task, with a
specific view to text simplification. In par-
ticular, it addresses two open issues con-
nected with it, i.e. the corpora to be used
for training, and the identification of the
most effective features to determine sen-
tence readability. An existing readabil-
ity assessment tool developed for Italian
was specialized at the level of training cor-
pus and learning algorithm. A maximum
entropy–based feature selection and rank-
ing algorithm (grafting) was used to iden-
tify to the most relevant features: it turned
out that assessing the readability of sen-
tences is a complex task, requiring a high
number of features, mainly syntactic ones.

1 Introduction

Over the last ten years, work on automatic read-
ability assessment employed sophisticated NLP
techniques (such as syntactic parsing and statisti-
cal language modeling) to capture highly complex
linguistic features, and used statistical machine
learning to build readability assessment tools. A
variety of different NLP–based approaches has
been proposed so far in the literature, differing
at the level of the number of identified readabil-
ity classes, the typology of features taken into ac-
count, the intended audience of the texts under
evaluation, or the application within which read-
ability assessment is carried out, etc.

Research focused so far on readability assess-
ment at the document level. However, as pointed
out by Skory and Eskenazi (2010), methods devel-
oped perform well when the task is characterizing
the readability level of an entire document, while
they are unreliable for short texts, including single

sentences. Yet, for specific applications, assessing
the readability level of individual sentences would
be desirable. This is the case, for instance, for text
simplification: in current approaches, text read-
ability is typically assessed with respect to the en-
tire document, while text simplification is carried
out at the sentence level, as e.g. done in Aluı́sio
et al. (2010), Bott and Saggion (2011) and Inui et
al. (2003). By decoupling the readability assess-
ment and simplification processes, the impact of
simplification operations on the overall readabil-
ity level of a given text may not always be clear.
With sentence–based readability assessment, this
is expected to be no longer a problem. Sentence
readability assessment thus represents an open is-
sue in the literature which is worth being further
explored. To our knowledge, the only attempts
in this direction are represented by Dell’Orletta et
al. (2011) and Sjöholm (2012) for the Italian and
Swedish languages respectively, followed more
recently by Vajjala and Meurers (2014) dealing
with English.

In this paper, we tackle the challenge of assess-
ing the readability of individual sentences as a first
step towards text simplification. The task is mod-
elled as a classification task, with the final aim
of shedding light on two open issues connected
with it, namely the reference corpora to be used
for training (i.e. collections of sentences classified
according to their readability level), and the iden-
tification of the most effective features to deter-
mine sentence readability. For what concerns the
former, sentence readability assessment poses the
remarkable issue of classifying sentences accord-
ing to their difficulty: if all sentences occurring in
simplified texts can be assumed to be easy–to–read
sentences, the reverse does not necessarily hold
since not all sentences occurring in complex texts
are to be assumed difficult–to–read. This fact has
important implications at the level of the composi-
tion of the corpora to be used for training. The sec-

163



ond issue is concerned with whether and to what
extent the features playing a significant role in the
assessment of readability at the sentence level co-
incide with those exploited at the level of docu-
ment. In particular, the following research ques-
tions are addressed:

1. in assessing sentence readability, is it bet-
ter to use a small gold standard training cor-
pus of manually classified sentences or a
much bigger training corpus automatically
constructed from readability–tagged docu-
ments possibly containing misclassified sen-
tences?

2. which are the features maximizing sentence
readability assessment?

3. to what extent do important features for sen-
tence readability classification match those
playing a role in the document readability
classification?

We will try to answer these questions by work-
ing on Italian, which is a less–resourced language
as far as readability is concerned. To this end,
READ–IT (Dell’Orletta et al., 2011; Dell’Orletta
et al., 2014), which represents the first NLP–based
readability assessment tool for Italian, was spe-
cialized in different respects, namely at the level of
the training corpus and of the learning algorithm;
to investigate questions 2. and 3. above, a maxi-
mum entropy–based feature selection and ranking
algorithm (i.e. grafting) was selected. The specific
target audience of readers addressed in this study
is represented by people characterised by low lit-
eracy skills and/or by mild cognitive impairment.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 de-
scribes the background literature, Section 3 intro-
duces our approach to the task, in terms of used
corpora, features and learning algorithm. Finally,
Sections 4 and 5 describe the experimental setting
and discuss achieved results.

2 Background

In spite of the acknowledged need of perform-
ing readability assessment at the sentence level,
so far very few attempts have been made to sys-
tematically investigate the issues and challenges
concerned with the readability assessment of sen-
tences (as opposed to documents). The first two
studies in this direction focused on languages
other than English, namely Italian (Dell’Orletta

et al., 2011) and Swedish (Sjöholm, 2012). In
both cases, the authors start from the assump-
tion that while all sentences occurring in simpli-
fied texts can be assumed to be easy–to–read sen-
tences, the reverse is not true, since not all sen-
tences occurring in complex texts are difficult–to–
read. This has important consequences at the level
of the evaluation of sentence classification results:
i.e. erroneous readability assessments within the
class of difficult–to–read texts may either corre-
spond to those easy–to–read sentences occurring
within complex texts or represent real classifi-
cation errors. To overcome this problem in the
readability assessment of individual sentences, a
notion of distance with respect to easy-to-read
sentences was introduced by Dell’Orletta et al.
(2011). Focusing on English, a similar issue is
addressed more recently by Vajjala and Meur-
ers (2014) who developed a binary sentence clas-
sifier trained on Wikipedia and Simple English
Wikipedia: they showed that the low accuracy ob-
tained by their classifier stems from the incorrect
assumption that all Wikipedia sentences are more
complex than the Simple Wikipedia ones.

Besides readability, sentence–based analyses
are reported in the literature for related tasks: for
instance, in a text simplification scenario by Drn-
darević et al. (2013), Aluı́sio et al. (2008), Štajner
and Saggion (2013) and Barlacchi and Tonelli
(2013); or to predict writing quality level by Louis
and Nenkova (2013). Sheikha and Inkpen (2012)
report the results of both document– and sentence–
based classification in the different but related task
of assessing formal vs. informal style of a docu-
ment/sentence. For students learning English, An-
dersen et al. (2013) made a self–assessment and
tutoring system available which was able to assign
a quality score for each individual sentence they
write: this provides automated feedback on learn-
ers’ writing.

A further important issue, largely investigated
in previous readability assessment studies, is the
identification of linguistic factors playing a role
in assessing the readability of documents. If tra-
ditional readability metrics (see e.g., Kincaid et
al. (1975)) typically rely on raw text characteris-
tics, such as word and sentence length, the new
NLP–based readability indices exploit wider sets
of features ranging across different linguistic lev-
els. Starting from Schwarm and Ostendorf (2005)
and Heilman et al. (2007), the role of syntactic

164



features in this task was considered, and more re-
cently, the role of discourse features (e.g., dis-
course topic, discourse cohesion and coherence)
has also been taken into account (see e.g., Barzi-
lay and Lapata (2008), Pitler and Nenkova (2008),
Kate et al. (2010), Feng et al. (2010) and Tonelli
et al. (2012)). Many of these studies also explored
the usefulness of features belonging to individual
levels of linguistic description in predicting text
readability. For example, Feng et al. (2010) sys-
tematically evaluated a wide range of features and
compared the results of different statistical classi-
fiers trained on different classes of features. Sim-
ilarly, the correlation between level–specific fea-
tures has been calculated by Pitler and Nenkova
(2008) with respect to human readability judg-
ments, and by François and Fairon (2012) with
respect to readability levels. In both cases, the
classes of features which turned out to be highly
correlated with readability judgments were used
in a readability assessment tool to test their effi-
cacy. Note, however, that in all cases the predic-
tive power of the selected features was evaluated
at the document level only.

3 Our Approach

In this section, we introduce the main ingredi-
ents of our approach to sentence readability as-
sessment, corpora used for training and testing,
selected features and the learning and feature se-
lection algorithm.

3.1 Corpora

We relied on two different corpora: a newspaper
corpus, La Repubblica (henceforth, Rep), and an
easy–to–read newspaper, Due Parole (henceforth,
2Par). 2Par includes articles specifically written
by Italian linguists experts in text simplification
for an audience of adults with a rudimentary lit-
eracy level or with mild intellectual disabilities
(Piemontese, 1996), which represents the target
audience of this study. The two corpora – selected
as representative of complex vs. simplified texts
within the journalistic genre – differ significantly
with respect to the distribution of features typi-
cally correlated with text complexity (Dell’Orletta
et al., 2011) and thus represent reliable training
datasets. However, whereas such a distinction is
valid as far as documents are concerned, it appears
to be a simplistic generalization when the focus is
on sentences. In other words, whereas we can con-

sider all sentences of 2Par as easy–to–read, not all
Rep sentences are expected to be difficult–to–read.
From this it follows that whereas the internal com-
position of 2Par is homogeneous at the sentence
level, this is not the case for Rep.

To overcome this asymmetry and in particular
to assess the impact of the noise in the Rep train-
ing corpus, we constructed different training sets
differing in size and internal composition, going
from a noisy set which assumes all Rep sentences
to be difficult–to–read to a clean but smaller set
in which the easy–to–read sentences occurring in
Rep were manually filtered out. These training
sets were used in different experiments whose re-
sults are reported in Section 4.2.

The corpus containing only difficult–to–read
sentences was manually built by annotating Rep
sentences according to their readability (i.e. easy
vs. difficult). The annotation process was car-
ried out by two annotators with a background in
computational linguistics. In order to assess the
reliability of their judgements, we started with a
small annotation experiment: the two annotators
were provided with the same 5 articles from the
Rep corpus (for a total of 107 sentences) and were
asked to extract the difficult–to–read sentences (as
opposed to both easy–to–read and not–easy–to–
classify sentences). The first annotator carried out
the task in 5 minutes and 46 seconds, while the
second annotator took 9 minutes and 8 seconds.
The two annotators agreed on the classification of
81 difficult–to–read sentences out of 107 consid-
ered ones (in particular, the first annotator iden-
tified 90 difficult–to–read–sentences and the sec-
ond one 93 sentences). The agreement between
the two annotators was calculated in terms of pre-
cision, by taking one of the annotation sets as the
gold standard and the other as response: on aver-
age, we obtained a precision of 0.88 in the retrieval
of sentences definitely classified as difficult–to–
read. Given the high level of agreement, the two
annotators were asked to select difficult sentences
from two sets of distinct Rep articles. This re-
sulted in a set of 1,745 difficult–to–read sentences
which were used together with a random selection
of easy–to–read sentences from 2Par for training
and testing.1

experiments. Only about 14 features are needed for an adequate model of document readability, whereas
this number increases to 30 for sentence readability (marked in boldface). Features which were not
selected during ranking have no rank.

3.2 Linguistic Features

The set of features used in the experiments re-
ported in this paper is wide, spanning across dif-
ferent levels of linguistic analysis. They can
be broadly classified into four main classes, as
reported in Table 1: raw text features, lexical
features, morpho–syntactic features and syntactic
features, shortly described below.2

2For an exhaustive discussion including the motivations
underlying this selection of features, the interested reader is

Raw text features (Features [1–2] in Table 1)
refer to those features typically used within tra-
ditional readability metrics and include sentence
length, calculated as the average number of words
per sentence, and word length, calculated as the
average number of characters per words.

The cover category of lexical features (Features
[3–8] in Table 1) includes features referring to

referred to Dell’Orletta et al. (2011, 2014) where these fea-
tures were successfully used for assessing the readability of
Italian texts.

166



both the internal composition of the vocabulary
and the lexical richness of the text. For what con-
cerns the former, the Basic Italian Vocabulary by
De Mauro (2000) was taken as a reference re-
source, including a list of 7000 words highly fa-
miliar to native speakers of Italian. In particular,
we consider: a) the percentage of all unique words
(types) on this reference list occurring in the text,
and b) the internal distribution of the occurring ba-
sic Italian vocabulary words into the usage classi-
fication classes of ‘fundamental words’ (very fre-
quent words), ‘high usage words’ (frequent words)
and ‘high availability words’ (relatively lower fre-
quency words referring to everyday life). Lexical
richness of texts is monitored by computing the
Type/Token Ratio (TTR), which refers to the ratio
between the number of lexical types and the num-
ber of tokens within a text. Due to its sensitivity
to sample size, this feature is computed for text
samples of equivalent length.

The set of morpho–syntactic features (Features
[9–41] in Table 1) is aimed at capturing differ-
ent aspects of the linguistic structure affecting in
one way or another the readability of a text. They
range from the probability distribution of part–
of–speech (POS) types, to the lexical density of
the text, calculated as the ratio of content words
(verbs, nouns, adjectives and adverbs) to the to-
tal number of lexical tokens in a text. This class
also includes features referring to the distribution
of verbs by mood and/or tense, which can be seen
as a language–specific feature exploiting the pre-
dictive power of the Italian rich morphology.

The set of syntactic features (Features [42–87]
in Table 1) captures different aspects of the syntac-
tic structure which are taken as reliable indicators
for automatic readability assessment, namely:

• the unconditional probability of syntactic de-
pendency types, e.g. subject, direct object,
modifier, etc. (Features 42–70);

• parse tree depth features (71–72), going from
the depth of the whole parse tree, calculated
in terms of the longest path from the root
of the dependency tree to some leaf, to a
more specific feature referring to the aver-
age depth of embedded complement ‘chains’
governed by a nominal head and including
either prepositional complements or nominal
and adjectival modifiers;

• verbal predicate features (73–78) aimed at

capturing different aspects of the behaviour
of verbal predicates: they range from the
number of verbal roots with respect to num-
ber of all sentence roots occurring in a text,
to more specific features such as the arity
of verbs, meant as the number of instanti-
ated dependency links sharing the same ver-
bal head (covering both arguments and modi-
fiers) and the relative ordering of subject and
object with respect to the verbal head;

• as subordination is widely acknowledged
to be an index of structural complexity
in language, subordination features (79–
85) include: the distribution of subordinate
vs. main clauses; for subordinates, the dis-
tribution of infinitives vs finite complement
clauses, their relative ordering with respect
to the main clause and the average depth of
‘chains’ of embedded subordinate clauses;

• the length of dependency links is another
characteristic connected with the syntactic
complexity of sentences. Features 86–87
measure dependency length in terms of the
words occurring between the syntactic head
and the dependent: they focus on all depen-
dency links vs. maximum dependency links
only.

3.3 Model Training and Feature Ranking
Given the twofold goal of this study, i.e. re-
liably assessing sentence readability and finding
the most predictive features undelying it, we used
GRAFTING (Perkins et al., 2003), as this approach
allows to train a maximum entropy model while si-
multaneously including incremental feature selec-
tion. The method uses a gradient–based heuristic
to select the most promising feature (to add to the
set of selected features S), and then performs a full
weight optimization over all features in S. This
process is repeated until a certain stopping crite-
rion is reached. As the grafting approach we use
integrates the l1 regularization (preventing overfit-
ting), features are only included (i.e. have a non-
zero weight) when the reduction of the objective
function is greater than a certain treshold. In our
case, the l1 prior we use was selected on the basis
of evaluating maximum entropy models with vary-
ing l1 values (range: 1e-11, 1e-10, ..., 0.1, 1) via
10–fold cross validation. We used TINYEST3, a

3http://github.com/danieldk/tinyest

167



grafting-capable maximum entropy parameter es-
timator for ranking tasks (de Kok, 2011; de Kok,
2013), to select the features and estimate their
weights. Whereas our task is not a ranking task,
but rather a binary classification problem, we were
able to model it as a ranking task by assigning a
high score (1) to difficult–to–read sentences and a
low score (0) to easy–to–read sentences. Conse-
quently, a sentence having a score < 0.5 was in-
terpreted as an easy–to–read sentence, whereas a
sentence which was assigned a score ≥ 0.5 was
interpreted to be a difficult–to–read sentence.

4 Experiments and Results

4.1 Experimental Setup
In all experiments, the corpora were automatically
tagged by the part–of–speech tagger described
in Dell’Orletta (2009) and dependency–parsed by
the DeSR parser (Attardi, 2006) using Support
Vector Machines as learning algorithm. We de-
vised two different experiments, aimed at explor-
ing the research questions investigated in this pa-
per. To this end, READ–IT was adapted by inte-
grating a specialized training corpus and a maxi-
mum entropy–based feature selection and ranking
algorithm (i.e. grafting).

Experiment 1
This experiment, investigating the first research
question, is aimed at identifying what is the most
effective training data for sentence readability as-
sessment. In particular, the goal is to compare
the results on the basis of using a small set of
gold standard data with respect to a (potentially
larger, but) noisy data set (i.e. without manual re-
vision) where every Rep sentence was assumed to
be difficult–to–read. In particular, the comparison
involved four datasets:

• a collection of gold standard data consisting
of 1,310 easy–to–read sentences randomly
extracted from the 2Par corpus and 1,310
manually selected difficult–to-read sentences
from the Rep corpus;

• a large and unbalanced collection of uncor-
rected data consisting of the whole 2Par cor-
pus (3,910 easy–to–read sentences) and the
whole Rep corpus (8,452 sentences, classi-
fied a priori as difficult–to–read);

• a balanced collection of uncorrected sen-
tences, consisting of 3,910 sentences from

2Par and 3,910 sentences from Rep;

• a balanced collection of uncorrected sen-
tences having the same size as the gold stan-
dard dataset, namely 1,310 sentences from
2Par and 1,310 sentences from Rep.

To assess similarities and differences at the level
of the different corpora used for training in this
experiment, in Table 2 we report a selection of
linguistic features (see Section 3.2) characterizing
the four datasets with respect to the whole 2Par
corpus.We can observe that 2Par differs from all
four Rep corpora for all reported features, and that
the four Rep corpora show similar trends. Inter-
estingly, however, the Rep Gold corpus is almost
always the most distant one from 2Par (i.e. at the
level of sentence length, word length, distribution
of adjectives and subjects, average length of de-
pendency links and parse tree depth).

On the basis of the four Rep datasets, four mod-
els were built which we evaluated using a held–
out test set consisting of 435 sentences from 2Par
and 435 manually classified difficult–to–read sen-
tences from Rep. Using the grafting method, we
calculated the classification score for each sen-
tence in our test set on the basis of an increasing
number of features (ranging from 1 to all non-zero
weighted features for the specific dataset): sen-
tences with a score below 0.5 were classified as
easy–to–read, whereas sentences having a score
greater or equal to 0.5 were classified as difficult–
to–read. This procedure was repeated for each of
the four models.

Experiment 2
The second experiment is aimed at answering our
second and third research questions, focusing on
the features relevant for sentence readability, and
the relationship of those features with document
readability classification. For this purpose, we
compared sentence– and document–based read-
ability classification results. In particular, we com-
pared the features used by the sentence–based
readability model trained on the gold standard
data and the features used by the document–based
model trained on Rep and 2Par. With respect
to the document classification, we used a cor-
pus of 638 documents (319 extracted from 2Par
representating easy–to–read texts, and 319 ex-
tracted from Rep representing difficult–to–read
texts) with 20% of the documents constituting the
held–out test set.

both overall accuracy (calculated as the proportion
of correct answers against all answers) and preci-
sion within each readability class (when using all
features), defined as the number of easy or diffi-
cult sentences correctly identified as such (in their
respective columns).

Accuracy was computed for all training models
tested using an increasing number of features (2,
10, 30, 50 and all features) as resulting from the
GRAFTING–based ranking and detailed in Table 1.
Note that the first two features correspond in all
cases to the traditional readability features of sen-
tence length and word length. The classification
model trained on the small gold standard dataset
turned out to almost always outperform all other
models: it achieved the best accuracy (83.7%) us-
ing a relatively small number of features (66), and
also for a fixed number of features (i.e. 2, 30
and 50). Only when using the top–10 features,
the uncorrected balanced large dataset slightly out-
performed the gold standard dataset. The accu-
racy when using the unbalanced dataset for train-
ing was always significantly (p < 0.05) worse (us-
ing McNemar’s test) than the accuracy based on
the other training data. The only other significant
difference existed between the balanced small and
large dataset for 10 features. All other differences
are non–significant.

It is also interesting to note that in the results
reported in column 2 ft of Table 3 a significant
difference is observed when comparing the accu-
racy achieved using the unbalanced large data set
with that achieved with the gold standard data: i.e.
about 15.5 percentage points of difference for the
2 ft model against 3 − 6% using higher numbers
of features. This result originates from the fact that
the unbalanced corpus contains to a larger extent
sentences which are short and complex at the same
time whose correct readability assessment requires
linguistically–grounded features (see below).

The last two columns of Table 3 report preci-
sion results for easy– vs. difficult–to–read sen-
tences for each of the four training datasets (all
features). It is clear that for the class of difficult–
to–read sentences the highest precision (88.5%) is
obtained when using the whole 2Par and Rep cor-
pora for training (i.e. unbalanced large), whereas
for the class of easy–to–read sentences the best
precision results (84.8%) are obtained with the
system trained on the gold standard dataset. In-
terestingly, the worst precision results (69.2%) are
reported for the class of easy–to–read sentences
with the unbalanced large training data set.

These results suggest that the advantages of us-
ing the gold standard data over the uncorrected
training data sets are limited. From this it fol-
lows that treating the whole Rep corpus as a col-
lection of difficult–to–read sentences is not com-
pletely unjustified: this is in line with the satisfac-
tory results reported by Dell’Orletta et al. (2011)
where Rep was used for training a sentence read-

169



ability classifier without any manual filtering of
sentences. Nevertheless, the results of this ex-
periment demonstrate that readability assessment
accuracy and in particular the precision in identi-
fying easy–to–read sentences can be improved by
using a manually selected training dataset. Bal-
ancing the size of larger but potentially noisy (i.e.
without manual revision) data sets appears to cre-
ate a positive trade–off between accuracy and pre-
cision for both classes, thus representing a viable
alternative to the construction of a gold standard
dataset.

4.3 Sentence vs. Document Classification:
which and how many features?

To identify the typology of features needed for
sentence readability assessment and compare them
to those needed for assessing document read-
ability, we compared the results obtained by the
grafting–based feature selection in the sentence
classification task (using the gold standard dataset
for training, see Table 3) to those obtained in the
document classification task whose accuracy on
the test set is reported in Table 4 for increasing
numbers of features selected via GRAFTING.

Train. data 2 ft 10 ft 30 ft 50 ft 70 ft (all)
Rep - 2Par 80 93.3 96.6 96.6 95

Table 4: Accuracy of document classification for
a varying number of features

By comparing the document classification re-
sults with respect to those obtained for sentences,
it can be noticed that the best accuracy is achieved
using a set of 30 features: in contrast to sentence
classification where adding features keeps increas-
ing the performance, more features do not appear
to help for document classification. Sentence read-
ability classification thus seems to be a more com-
plex task, requiring a higher amount of features.
This trend emerges more clearly in Figures 1(a)
and 1(b), where the classification results on the
training set (using 10–fold cross–validation) and
the held–out test set are visualized for increas-
ing amounts of features selected via GRAFTING.
As Figure 1(a) shows, the document classifica-
tion task requires about 14 features after which
the performance appears to stabilize (97.4% accu-
racy for the ten–fold cross-validation and 96.7%
for the held–out test set). In contrast, Figure
1(b) shows that sentence classification requires at

least 30 features (83.4% accuracy for the ten–fold
cross-validation and 79.9% for the test set).

Noticeable differences can also be observed in
the typology of features playing a prominent role
in the two tasks. For each feature taken into ac-
count, Table 1 reports its ranking as resulting from
sentence– and document–based classification ex-
periments (columns “Sent. class.” and “Doc.
class.” respectively). Note that in interpreting
the rank associated with each feature it should
be considered that in sentence– and document–
classification the number of required features is
significantly different, i.e. 30 and 14 respectively:
this is to say that approximately the same rank as-
sociated to the same feature does not entail a com-
parable role across the two classification tasks.

As already pointed out, for both sentences and
documents raw text features (i.e. Sentence length
and Word length) turned out to be the top features,
leading however to significantly different results:
i.e. 80% accuracy for documents vs. 65% for
sentences. Among the remaining features, graft-
ing results show that syntactic features do play
a central role in both sentence– and document–
based readability assessment: many of these are
highly ranked, with some differences. Syntactic
features playing a similar role in both readabil-
ity classification tasks include: Verbal root [73],
Parse tree depth [71], ‘Chains’ of embedded sub-
ordinate clauses [83] and Max. length of depen-
dency links [87], covering important aspects of
syntactic complexity such as depth of the syntactic
dependency (sub–)tree and length of dependency
links. Features that are mainly useful for sentence
readability turned out to be Arity of verbal pred-
icates [74], Pre–verbal subject [75], Post–verbal
object [78] and Embedded complement ‘chains’
[72], which can all be seen as representing local
features referring to sentence parts. The feature
Subordinate clauses in pre–verbal position [81],
focusing on the global distribution of pre–verbal
subordinate clauses within the document, is rele-
vant for document classification only. It is interest-
ing to note that features capturing different facets
of the same phenomenon can play quite a different
role for assessing the readability of sentences vs.
documents: this is the case of dependency length,
measured in terms of the words occurring between
the syntactic head and the dependent, where fea-
ture [86] refers to the average length of all de-
pendency links and [87] to the average length of

170

maximum dependency links from each sentence.
Whereas [86] plays a similar role for sentences
and documents (in both cases it is a middle rank
feature), [87] is a global feature playing a more
prominent role in document classification.

At the morpho–syntactic level, the feature rank-
ing is more comparable. However, it is interest-
ing to note that very few morpho–syntactic fea-
tures were selected by the feature selection pro-
cess: this is particularly true for document classi-
fication. This can follow from the fact that these
features can be considered as proxies of the syn-
tactic structure which in these experiments was
represented through specific features: in this situ-
ation, the grafting process preferred syntactic fea-
tures over morpho–syntactic ones, in spite of the
lower accuracy of the dependency parser with re-
spect to the part–of–speech tagger. Interestingly,
this result is in contrast with what reported by
Falkenjack and Jönsson (2014) for what concerns
document readability assessment, who claim that
an optimal subset of text features for readability
based document classification does not need fea-
tures induced via parsing. Among the morpho–
syntactic features, it appears that verbal features
play an important role: this can follow both by the
language dealt with which is a a morphologically
rich language, and by the fact that these features
do not have a counterpart at the syntactic level.

Lexical features show a much more mixed re-
sult. Type–Token Ratio (TTR) is only important
for document classification, whereas most of the
other features are important for sentence readabil-
ity, but not for document readability (with the ex-
ception of the presence of ‘fundamental words’ of
the Basic Italian Vocabulary).

5 Discussion

In this study we have focused on three research
questions. First, we asked which type of train-
ing corpus is best to assess sentence readability.
Whereas we found that using a set of manually
selected complex sentences was better than using
a simple corpus–based distinction, the extra ef-
fort needed to construct the training corpus might
not be worthwhile as observed improvements were
quite modest. However, we did not consider a
more sensitive measure of the difficulty of a sen-
tence (such as a number ranging between 0 and
1), and this might be able to offer a more sub-
stantial improvement (at the cost of needing more
time to create the training material). Of course,
when the goal is to identify the best features for
assessing sentence readability, it does make sense
to have high–quality training data to prevent se-
lecting inadequate features. The second research
question involved identifying which features were
most useful for assessing sentence readability. Be-
sides raw text features, syntactic but also morpho–
syntactic features turned out to play a central role
to achieve adequate performance. The third re-
search question investigated the overlap between
the features needed for document and sentence
readability classification. Whereas there certainly
was overlap between the top features (with dif-
ferent levels of performance), most of the fea-
tures had a different rank across the two tasks,
with local features being more predictive for sen-
tence classification and global ones for documents.
This suggests that the sentence readability task is
more complex than assessing document readabil-
ity, given that there is much less information avail-
able for a sentence than for a document.
