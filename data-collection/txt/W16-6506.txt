Abstract

We present a language-independent tool,
called Varseta, for extracting variation sets
in child-directed speech. This tool is evalu-
ated against a gold standard corpus annotated
with variation sets, MINGLE-3-VS, and used
to explore variation sets in 26 languages1 in
CHILDES-26-VS, a comparable corpus de-
rived from the CHILDES database. The tool
and the resources are freely available for re-
search.2

1 Introduction

Repetitiousness is a strong trait of child-directed
speech. When parents speak to young infants, a
large proportion of utterances are either exact repeti-
tions of an immediately preceding utterance, or par-
tial repetitions, where the message is repeated and
thus, the speaker intent is constant, but variation oc-
curs in the surface form. Such sequences of partial
repetitions were first referred to as variation sets by
Küntay and Slobin (1996). Surface form variation
includes expansion, insertion, deletion, and word or-
der change, e.g.:

le petit chat? (‘the small cat?’)3

tu m’aides? (‘will you help me?’)

tu m’aides à chercher? (‘will you help me
look?’)

il est où là le petit chat? (‘where is the
small cat?’)

The repetitiousness can also be semantic, e.g., in
cases of lexical substitution such as this where the
verbs titta, sett, kolla are variations of ‘to look (at
something)’ (Wirén et al., 2016):

titta här då! (‘look at this!’)4

har du sett vilka tjusiga byxor? (‘have you
seen such fancy pants?’)

kolla! (‘check it out!’)

Current research suggests that such sequences
of repetition and variation play a role in language
learning, e.g., experiments on artificial language
learning and variation sets (Onnis et al., 2008),
as well as child corpus studies on correlations be-
tween variation sets and language acquisition (Hoff-
Ginsberg, 1986; Hoff-Ginsberg, 1990; Waterfall,
2006; Küntay and Slobin, 1996). This paper builds
upon these assumptions, but does not concern the
output of the learner. Rather, our aim is to investi-
gate the input to the learner, and more specifically,
the longitudinal patterns of occurrences of variation
sets in child-directed speech across multiple lan-
guages.

To our knowledge, variation sets have been stud-
ied in Turkish (Küntay and Slobin, 1996; Küntay
and Slobin, 2002), English (Waterfall, 2006), Sign
Language of the Netherlands (Hoiting and Slobin,

2002), and Swedish, English, Russian, and Croatian
(Wirén et al., 2016). Studies using longitudinal data
have shown that as the communication skills of the
child increase, the proportion of utterances in varia-
tion sets decreases (Waterfall et al., 2010; Wirén et
al., 2016).

This study expands the scope of previous work
by using a large-scale cross-language approach to
explore repetition and variation in child-directed
speech. Further, the approach proposed in this pa-
per on extracting variation sets from transcripts of
child-directed speech is language-independent and
automatic. This paper presents two surface-based
strategies for automatic variation detection (see sec-
tion 4). The strategies are evaluated against a gold
standard corpus annotated according to the annota-
tion scheme for variation sets described in (Wirén et
al., 2016).

2 Related work

While most definitions of variation sets include both
speaker intention and utterance form (c.f., (Küntay
and Slobin, 1996; Küntay and Slobin, 2002; Water-
fall, 2006; Wirén et al., 2016)), previous attempts at
automatic extraction of variation sets focus primar-
ily on form.

Brodsky et al. (2007) suggest a narrower defini-
tion of variation set as sequences of utterances where
each successive pair of utterances has a lexical over-
lap of at least one element. Variation sets can thus
be extracted by comparing pairs of successive utter-
ances for repeated words, resulting in sets with at
least one word in common. Using such an extrac-
tion procedure, Brodsky et al. found that 21.5% of
the words in Waterfall’s (2006) corpus (12 mother–
child dyads, child age 1;2-2;6 years) occur in vari-
ation sets, and 18.3% of the words in the English
CHILDES database (MacWhinney, 2000).

Similarly, Onnis et al. based their extraction strat-
egy on Waterfall’s (2006) criteria for variation sets.
When applied to the CHILDES Lara corpus (child
age 1;9–3;3 years), 27,9% of the utterances were ex-
tracted as belonging to variation sets.

Also using a surface-based algorithm for auto-
matic extraction of variation sets, but with a novel
definition of variation sets, Wirén et al. (2016) show
that the proportion of variation sets in child-directed

speech decreases consistently as a function of chil-
dren’s age across Swedish, Croatian, English and
Russian. They report fuzzy F-scores of 0.822, 0.689,
0.601, and 0.425 for 4 age groups in Swedish data
respectively.

This study expands the scope of the latter paper
in two ways: a) by offering two variation set ex-
traction strategies ANCHOR and INCREMENTAL
which are evaluated against a gold standard corpus
of Swedish; b) by using these strategies in a large-
scale cross-language investigation of child-directed
speech corpora derived from the CHILDES database
(MacWhinney, 2000); c) by releasing the software
and the derived corpora along with the gold standard
corpus of Swedish.5

3 Data sets

We use two different data sets for exploration of rep-
etition and variation in child-directed speech. The
longitudinal Swedish corpus, MINGLE-3-VS, is an-
notated with variation sets. The second data set, here
called CHILDES-26-VS, consists of plain text tran-
scripts of child-directed speech in 26 languages, de-
rived from the CHILDES database (MacWhinney,
2000). The corpus files are grouped by language and
child age which allows for both cross-language and
within-language longitudinal comparisons.

3.1 MINGLE-3-VS: a corpus annotated with
variation sets

The gold standard variation set corpus, MINGLE-3-
VS, consist of transcripts of Swedish child-directed
speech annotated with variation sets according to the
annotation scheme described in (Wirén et al., 2016).

The transcripts originates from the MINGLE-
3 multimodal corpus (Björkenstam et al., 2016),
which consists of 18 longitudinal dyads with three
children (two girls, one boy; six dyads per child)
recorded between the ages of 7 and 33 months. The
complete duration of the 18 dyads is 7:29 hours
(mean duration 24:58 minutes). The video and audio
recordings were made from naturalistic parent–child
interaction in a studio at the Phonetics Laboratory
at Stockholm University (Lacerda, 2009). The chil-
dren were interacting alternately with their mothers
(10 dyads) and fathers (8 dyads) in a free play sce-

nario.6 The ELAN annotation tool (Wittenburg et
al., 2006) was used for transcription of parent and
child utterances, as well as non-verbal annotation
(Björkenstam et al., 2016).

ELAN was also used for manual variation set an-
notation. This allowed for the annotators to take
both verbal and non-verbal input from parent and
child into account when deciding on the boundaries
of variation sets. The annotation methodology was
as follows: during the first phase, a subset of four
dyads was annotated by two coders independently.
After merging the respective annotations for each

dyad, a third annotator marked cases of disagree-
ment. This resulted in an inter-annotator agree-
ment (measured as set overlap between annotators)
of 78%. Disagreements were solved during group
discussions. After evaluation of the first phase, the
remaining 14 dyads were annotated by one annota-
tor. Finally, a classification of communicative inten-
tion based on the Inventory of Communicative Acts-
Abridged (Ninio et al., 1994) was added. This clas-
sification was evaluated by comparing four repre-
sentative dyads annotated by three independent an-
notators, resulting in a Fleiss’s kappa of 0.63. The
transcripts were also annotated with part-of-speech
using Stagger (Östling, 2013), followed by manual



correction (Wirén et al., 2016).

3.2 CHILDES-26-VS: corpora derived from
CHILDES

We have extracted child-directed speech from tran-
scripts in 45 corpora in 26 languages from the
CHILDES database (MacWhinney, 2000). The se-
lection criteria was the scenario (naturalistic inter-
action), the participants (parents or other adults -
including researchers - and children), and the age
of the child (0;6 to 2;9 years). The selected tran-
scripts were grouped according to child age. The
grouping approximates major physical child devel-
opment stages, i.e., sitting up (0;6–0;11 years),
standing-walking (1;0–1;3 years), fully mobile (1;4–
1;11 years), and talking (2;0–2;9 years) (see table 2).

An overview of the sources is presented in table 1,
detailing for each language the language group ac-
cording to CHILDES, the name of the corpus or cor-
pora, the total number of children, the age groups
(1–4) covered by the transcripts, and the total num-
ber of transcripts.

All files in the derived corpora are grouped by
language and child age which allows for both cross-
language and within-language longitudinal compar-
isons of variation sets with the Varseta tool. This
data set is freely available for research as part of the
Varseta package (see section 4).

4 Varseta - a tool for automatic extraction
of variation sets

The Varseta tool for variation set extraction for any
language is available at GitHub7.

The definition of variation sets that we follow in
the implementation of the Varseta tool takes into ac-
count exact repetitions, and further allows the fol-
lowing transformations between utterances: reduc-

7https://github.com/ginta-re/Varseta

tion, expansion, and word order change (Wirén et
al., 2016). Although these alternations might be
fairly complex, a large proportion of them can be
observed on the surface level, and thus automatically
extracted on the basis of string similarity techniques.

Varseta employs two commonly used string sim-
ilarity measures: the Ratcliff-Obershelp pattern
recognition method (Black, 2004) and edit distance
ratio8 (Levenshtein, 1966), and uses two strategies
for detecting variation sets in child-directed speech:
ANCHOR and INCREMENTAL. The two string
similarity measures and the two strategies can be
used in any combination, allowing for 4 different
settings.

For a given set of utterances, the ANCHOR strat-
egy measures pairwise utterance similarity of all ut-
terances in relation to the first, e.g. 1-2, 1-3, 1-4.
The criterion for including two utterances in a varia-
tion set is that the difference between them (regarded
as strings) does not fall below a certain similarity
threshold. Additionally, following Brodsky et al.
(2007), we allow for sequences of maximally two in-
tervening dissimilar utterances that do not obey this
condition.

For a given set of utterances, the INCREMEN-
TAL strategy performs a stepwise comparison of
pairs of successive utterances, e.g. 1-2, 2-3, 3-4.
Two utterance strings that pass a certain similarity
threshold are marked as belonging to a variation set.
Unlike the ANCHOR strategy, sequences of inter-
vening dissimilar utterances are not allowed. Thus
the process continues, by adding similar utterances,
until a non-similar utterance occurs.

Both strategies can employ either edit distance
ratio (EDR) or Ratcliff-Obershelp pattern recogni-
tion method (DLR, as implemented in the Python
module difflib9). String similarity measures return
values between [0..1], convenient for categorizing
string utterances on the surface level. A value of
1 means exact repetition of an utterance, and 0
means two unrelated utterances without any overlap
of words. The similarity threshold used in this ex-
perimental study, as described in section 5, was arbi-
trarily selected. The most optimal similarity thresh-
olds when evaluated against the Swedish gold stan-

dard was 0.55 for DLR, and 0.51 for EDR (see Fig-
ure 1).

While performing experiments on the Swedish
gold standard data, we found that the ANCHOR
strategy with the DLR similarity measure performed
slightly better relative to the gold standard annota-
tion.

Additionally, we experimented on including in-
formation from the part-of-speech tagging of the
transcripts in such away that the pair of strings com-
pared consisted of both the words and their part-of-
speech tags. Our intuition was that this might give a
more refined analysis, for example, by distinguish-
ing cases of homonymy. This version of the algo-
rithm turned out not to improve performance, how-
ever (see Figure 1), and was therefore dropped.

5 Results: Automated extraction of
variation sets

5.1 Evaluation against the Swedish gold
standard

We evaluated the Varseta tool against the gold stan-
dard using two kinds of metrics, which we refer to
as strict and fuzzy matching. Strict matching re-
quires exact matching on the utterance level of the
extracted variation set and the corresponding gold
standard set, whereas fuzzy matching allows for par-
tial overlaps of the extracted variation set and the
gold standard set. In the example in Table 3, only
utterance 3 and 4 are members of the gold standard
variation set, whereas the algorithm extracts utter-
ances 1–4. Hence, the strict matching metric treats

this extracted set as a false positive, whereas the
fuzzy matching metric treats it as a true positive.

Table 4 summarizes the results of extraction of
variation sets relative to the gold standard according
to the strict and fuzzy metric. Strict F-score reaches
0.577 and fuzzy F-score reaches 0.813 for age group
1, but F-scores gradually decrease with increasing
age.

This observed phenomenon has two reasons: first,
the decrease in the proportion of exact repetitions as
the child grows older; second, the increasing com-
plexity of the parent’s speech. As the complex-
ity increases, capturing variation requires more than
surface-based methods. This finding is in line with
(Wirén et al., 2016).

5.2 Extraction of variation sets in 26 languages

For exploration of repetition and variation in child-
directed speech in 26 languages, as captured in
CHILDES-26-VS, we have used the Varseta tool.

We expected to find decreasing proportions of
utterances in variation sets as a function of child
age for all languages.

The findings for a majority of languages, 19
out of 26 (Irish, Welsh, Cantonese, Indonesian,
Japanese, Afrikaans, Danish, Dutch, English, Ger-
man, Swedish, Italian, Spanish, Croatian, Russian,
Estonian, Farsi, Greek, and Turkish), indicate a de-
crease in the proportion of utterances in variation
sets as a function of child age (see bold face pro-
portions in table 5 on page 7).

We have observed exceptions in Chinese, Thai,
Catalan, French, Portuguese, Hebrew, and Tamil.

Table 4: Evaluation of the Varseta tool for automatic variation-set extraction against the Swedish gold standard per age group.

For Chinese, Thai, Hebrew, and Tamil, there are
insufficient amounts of data for earlier age groups
(age groups 2, 1, 2, and 1, respectively) which skews
the proportion in comparison to older age groups.
For instance, Chinese age group 2 contains 294 ut-
terances and Chinese age group 3 contains 1395. In
the age groups with sufficient/comparable amounts
of data for these three languages, we do observe the
expected decrease pattern.

However, data insufficiency or incomparability
cannot explain the unexpected findings for French
and Portugese, and thus in-depth analysis of these
transcripts is needed.

For most of the languages the similar pattern of

decrease in proportion of exact repetitions cannot
be observed. One general trend is that the proportion
of exact repetitions is small as compared to the pro-
portion of utterances in variation sets. Exceptions
to this trend are observed in Swedish, Danish, En-
glish, Russian, Cantonese, Japanese, Thai, Welsh,
Estonian, Hebrew, and Tamil (average proportion of
exact repetition: 0.13 in age group 1, 0.096 in age
group 2, 0.066 in age group 3, and 0.04 in age group
4).

For some languages we observe a decrease in pro-
portions, even to no exact repetitions, for example in
German, French, Italian, Spanish, Farsi, and Turk-
ish. A close inspection of these data files revealed

that this is not only the effect of the absence of ex-
act repetitions, but also due to the level of analy-
sis added to the transcripts, for instance markup for
perceived pause length or prosody, comments in En-
glish, etc.

We also note that about half of the transcripts in
Cantonese, Chinese, and Japanese were in latin char-
acters, whereas e.g., some of the transcripts in age
group 2 are in Chinese characters. Transcripts writ-
ten in such logographic systems have a more com-
pressed representation on the utterance level, and
thus the similarity measure might need an adjust-
ment.

In addition to quantitative trends across the lan-
guages, Varseta also provides variation sets for in-
spection. Here are two examples of automatically
extracted variation sets in German and Farsi.

wo sind die anderen flaschen? (‘where are
the other bottles?’)11

guck mal da unten bei dem auto. (‘look
down there by the car.’)

da is noch eine flasche. (‘there is one bot-
tle.’)

da sin die anderen flaschen. (‘there are the
other bottles.’)

ho gorbe chi mige? (‘what does the cat
say?’)12

gorbehe ci mige? (‘what does the cat
say?’)

chi mige? (‘what does it say?’)
mamaoushe chi mige? (‘what does ?(the

mouse’s mother) say?’)
mamoushe chi? (‘?(the mouse’s mother)

what?’)

6 Discussion

The evaluation of the Varseta tool for Swedish in-
dicates that variation sets are easier to capture for
earlier age groups (ANCHOR fuzzy F-score: 0.813,
0.667, 0.640 and 0.453 for age groups 1, 2, 3 and 4).
The F-score reflects on the complexity of the input,

that is, not only the proportion of exact repetitions,
but also patterns of expansion, insertion, deletion,
word order change, and lexical substitution over se-
quences of utterances. Further, the algorithm does
not include information on speaker turns as this in-
formation is not available in the current version of
the corpus, and it is likely that this contributes to
the low precision in the later dyads. According to
the definition we follow, child vocalizations are al-
lowed within a variation set (c.f., Wirén et al., 2016),
but when such a child utterance constitutes a legiti-
mate turn, the variation set should be split in two.
Overall, the performance is according to what can
be expected from a simple surface-based method.
To our knowledge this is the only extraction method
that has been evaluated against a manually annotated
gold standard and therefore can serve as a baseline
method for similar investigations.

The Varseta tool offers both quantitative analysis
of repetition and variation in speech transcripts, and
output in the form of sequences of utterances from
those transcripts that constitute variation sets.

With regards to the analysis of the CHILDES-26-
VS with the Varseta tool, the expected decrease in
proportion of utterances in variation sets was ob-
served for the majority of languages. The same ob-
servation cannot be made for the proportion of ex-
act repetitions. This may be due to differences in
transcription, for example regarding utterance seg-
mentation and pause markup, between corpora in
CHILDES. For instance, the Varseta tool cannot rec-
ognize variation in this example, as within-utterance
repetition is not recognized by the tool. The short in-
tervals, here marked by ‘(.)’, may in another corpus
constitute segmentation boundaries:

canta lá (.) canta (.) tu sabes? (‘sing there
(.) sing (.) you know?’)13

canta com o patinho. (‘sing with the duck-
ling.’)

The current method does not take into account se-
mantic variation, complete lexical substitution, and
other forms of complex variation. The surface-based
approach can be improved by adaptating semantic
similarity methods like Word2Vec (Mikolov et al.,

13Example from CHILDES Romance/Portuguese/Santos/

2013) as a possible solution for capturing lexical
substitutions.

7 Conclusion

This study expands the scope of previous work
by using a large-scale cross-language approach to
exploring repetition and variation in child-directed
speech. Further, the approach proposed in this pa-
per on extracting variation sets from transcripts of
child-directed speech is language-independent and
automatic. The Varseta tool uses two surface-
based strategies for automatic variation set detec-
tion which were evaluated against a gold standard
corpus MINGLE-3-VS. The software, the gold stan-
dard corpus of Swedish, and the comparable corpus
of 26 languages derived from CHILDES are freely
available for exploration of repetition and variation
in child-directed speech.

We have also reported findings on repetition and
variation in child-directed speech in 26 languages,
as captured in CHILDES-26-VS, using the Varseta
tool. We expected to find decreasing proportions of
utterances in variation sets as a function of child age
for all languages. The findings confirmed this expec-
tation for a majority of languages, except for French
and Portuguese.
