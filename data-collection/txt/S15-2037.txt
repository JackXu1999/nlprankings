Abstract 

In this paper, we present a comment labeling 

system based on a deep learning strategy. We 

treat the answer selection task as a sequence 

labeling problem and propose recurrent 

convolution neural networks to recognize 

good comments. In the recurrent architecture 

of our system, our approach uses 

2-dimensional convolutional neural networks 

to learn the distributed representation for 

question-comment pair, and assigns the labels 

to the comment sequence with a recurrent 

neural network over CNN. Compared with 

the conditional random fields based method, 

our approach performs better performance on 

Macro-F1 (53.82%), and achieves the highest 

accuracy (73.18%), F1-value (79.76%) on 

predicting the Good class in this answer 

selection challenge. 

1 Introduction 

The community question answering site or system 

(CQA) is one kind of common platforms where 

people can freely ask questions, deliver comments 

and participate in discussions. The high-quality 

comments given a question are the important 

resources to generate useful question-answer pairs, 

which are of great value for knowledge base 

construction and information retrieval (IR). 

However, due to the unrestricted expressions in 

CQA, it still one problem to recognize the 

high-quality comments from the open domain data, 

which are involve in a large of noise information. 

Nevertheless, the semantic relevance between 

question and comment makes sense to predict the 

quality of comment by modeling the semantic 

matching for question-comment pair. 

Prior work on predicting the class of comment 

(or answer) mainly attempted to measure the 

semantic similarity between question and 

comment with typical classification approaches, 

such as LR and SVM. To achieve the semantic 

relevance matching for question-comment pair, a 

large number of works focus on constructing 

feature-engineering to extract the features of 

question and comment as the input of models. 

Beyond typical textual feature, some works 

integrate the structural information (Wang et al., 

2009; Huang et al., 2007) into the discrete 

representations of question-comment pairs to 

improve the performances of comment classifiers. 

Another option is extracting user metadata (Chen 

and Nayak, 2008; Shah and Pomerantz, 2010) 

from the question answering portal for enriching 

the feature-engineering. Empirically the 

approaches above have been shown to improve 

performances on recognizing positive answers, but 

they rely on large numbers of hand-crafted 

features, and require various external resources 

which may be difficult to obtain. Furthermore, 

they suffer from the limitation of requiring 

task-specific feature extraction for new domain. 

Recently the works about neural network-based 

distributed sentence models (Socher et al., 2012; 

Kalchbrenner et al., 2014) have achieved 

successes in natural language processing (NLP). 

As a consequence of this success, it appears 

natural to attempt to solve question answering 

using similar techniques. To recognize the 

high-quality answers, Hu et al. (2013) learned the 

joint representation for each question-answer pair 

210



 
Figure 1. The architecture of comment labeling system based on deep learning

by taking both of the textual and non-textual 

features as the input of multi-DBN model. To 

achieve the answer sentence selection, Yu et al. 

(2014) proposed convolution neural networks 

based models to represent the question and answer 

sentences. For the semantic matching between 

question and answer, the methods based on deep 

learning generally exploit to learn the distributed 

representation of question-answer pair as the input. 

Instead of extracting a variety of features, these 

approaches learn the semantic features to 

represent question and answer. However, these 

approaches only focus on modeling the semantic 

relevance between question and answer, ignoring 

the semantic correlations in answer sequence. 

In this work, we present a novel comment 

labeling system based on deep learning. We 

propose the recurrent convolutional neural 

networks (R&CNN) approach to assign the labels 

to comments given a question. Based on the 

distributed representations learned form 

2-dimensional CNN (2D-CNN) matching, our 

approach achieves to comment sequence learning 

and predict the classes of comments. Using the 

word embedding trained by provided Qatar Living 

data, R&CNN not only models the semantic 

relevance for question and comment, but also 

captures the correlative context in comment 

sequence for predicting the class of comment. The 

experimental results show that our system 

performs better performances than the CRF based 

method (Ding et al., 2008) on recognizing good 

comments, and performs more adaptive on the 

development and test dataset. 

2 System Description 

The architecture of our comment labeling system 

is a recurrent architecture (shown in Figure 1) 

with a recurrent neural network over the 

convolutional neural networks. Given a question, 

our approach achieves to learn the semantic 

relevance between question and comment by 

2D-CNN matching and generate the distributed 

representation of each question-comment pair. 

After that, our approach uses the RNN to model 

the semantic correlations in comment sequence, 

and makes the quality predictions for the comment 

sequence with the captured context. 

2.1 Convolutional Neural Networks for 
question-comment matching 

Convolutional neural networks are a natural 

extension of neural networks for treating image. 

Hu et al. (2014) proposed the 2D-CNN model to 

do semantic matching between two sentences. In 

our work, we use 2D-CNN to learn the distributed 

representations for question-comment pairs. 

Unlike 1D-CNN, executing the interaction 

between question and answer in final multi-layer 

perception (MLP) with their individual 

representations, 2D-CNN maps question and 

comment into a common space for learning the 

representation of question-comment pair and 

captures the rich matching patterns between 

question and answer by layer-by-layer convolution 

and pooling. 

The first layer is 1D-convolution layer, whose 

role is converting word embedding of question 

and comment into one common space with the 

sliding window, whose size k is (3 × 3). For the 
word i on question 𝑞 and word j on comment 𝑐, 
1D-convolution can formulated as: 

�̂�𝑖,𝑗
(0)

= [𝑞𝑖:𝑖+𝑘−1
𝑇 , 𝑐𝑖:𝑖+𝑘−1

𝑇 ]      (1) 

where �̂�𝑖,𝑗
(0)

simply concatenates the vectors of 

sentence segments in question 𝑞 and comment 𝑐; 

211



The 1D-convolution converts the concatenated 

matrix 𝐻0 of question and comment into the 
real-value matrix  𝐻1 . After that, 2D-CNN 
executes deep 2D-convolution and pooling, 

similar to that of traditional image input. The 

output of the mth hidden layer is computed as: 

𝐻𝑚 = 𝜎(𝑝𝑜𝑜𝑙(𝑤𝑚𝐻𝑚−1 + 𝑏𝑚))   (2) 

Here, 𝑤𝑚 is the parameter matrix for the feature 
maps on mth hidden layer and 𝑏𝑚 is the bias 
vector. 𝜎(. ) is the sigmoid activation function. 
The final distributed representation  𝑝𝑡 of 
question-comment pair learned from 2D-CNN 

represents the semantic relevance between 

question and comment, and provides the reliable 

evidences to make a quality prediction for the 

corresponding comment. 

2.2 Recurrent Neural Network for comment 
sequence labeling 

Recurrent neural network is a straightforward 

adaptation of the standard feed-forward neural 

network (Bengio et al., 2012) to allow it to model 

sequential data. The recurrent neural network in 

our work has one input layer X, one hidden layer 

H for updating the hidden state, and the output 

layer Y. For the time step t, the input to RNN 

includes the learned representation  𝑝(𝑡) and the 
previous hidden state  ℎ(𝑡 − 1) . The output is 
denoted as 𝑦(𝑡). The output of input, hidden and 
output layers are computed as: 

𝑥(𝑡) = 𝑤𝑖𝑝(𝑡) + 𝑤ℎℎ(𝑡 − 1) + 𝑏ℎ  (3) 

ℎ(𝑡) = 𝜎(𝑥(𝑡))                 (4) 

𝑦(𝑡) = 𝑔(𝑤𝑦ℎ(𝑡) + 𝑏𝑦)           (5) 

where 𝑤𝑖 is the matrix of connection between 
CNN and the input layer of RNN; 𝑤ℎ plays role 
in updating network state or context; and 𝑤𝑦 is 

the matrix of connection between hidden layer 

and output layer. Both of 𝑏ℎ and 𝑏𝑦 are bias 

vectors. Here, 𝜎(. ) is the sigmoid activation 
function; 𝑔(. ) is the softmax function. 𝑥(𝑡) is 
the joint representation of current pair and 

context. Our approach is able to capture the 

context by updating the hidden state ℎ(𝑡). 
To train the networks proposed here, we use the 

backpropagation through time with stochastic 

gradient descent (SGD) algorithm. At each 

training step, error vector is computed according 

to cross entropy criterion, weights are updated as: 

𝐸𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟(𝑡; 𝜃) = 𝑅(𝑡) − 𝑦(𝑡)         (6) 
where 𝑦(𝑡) is the result from our system, and 
𝑅(𝑡) is the true class; and 𝜃 includes all the 
parameters of CNN and RNN. 

3 Experiments 

3.1 Experimental setup 

We evaluate our approach (R&CNN) on both the 

development and test data of this answer selection 

challenge. The statistics of experimental dataset 

are summarized in Table 1. In this dataset, there 

are 3,229 questions and 21,062 answers, and the 

percentage of good comments is about 50%. The 

average length of comment sequence is 6.

Devel 300 1645 5.48 53.19 

Test 329 1976 6.00 50.46 

Table 1. Statistics of experimental dataset 

In our approach, we use 100-dimensional word 

embedding trained on the provided Qatar Living 

data with Word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013). The 

maximum size of coding the sentences with word 

embedding is set to be 100, and we use 3-words 

sliding window for 1D-convolution. The learning 

rate is initialized to be 0.01 and adapted 

dynamically using ADADELTA Method (Matthew, 

2012). Based on the results on development set, 

all the hyperparameters of our approach are 

optimized on train set. 

Table 2 lists the experimental methods and the 

corresponding official results. The baselines of 

comment sequence labeling include the method 

based on CRF and the approach CRF+V, which 

integrates distributed representation learnt from 

our approach (R&CNN). In addition, we illustrate 

the best result achieved by the supervised 

feature-rich approach SFR1.

3.2 Results and analysis 

Table 3 and Table 4 illustrate the results in 

development and test dataset respectively. As can 

be seen, our proposed R&CNN outperforms CRF 

and CRF+V on whole performances. Specifically, 

R&CNN achieves the state-of-the-art with the 

accuracy 73.18%, and 79.76% in F1-value of 

predicting Good class while performs 53.82% in 

Macro-F1 on the test dataset.

SFR 57.29 72.67 80.51 78.03 79.11 

Table 4. Performances on test dataset (%) 

Compared to CRF and CRF+V, our approach 

outperforms them in evolution metrics. There are 

several reasons for the unsatisfying performances 

of CRF and CRF+V. First, it is sparse to extract 

semantic features of question-comment pairs from 

short contents in baselines. In contrast, the 

distributed representation learned from our model 

is able to capture semantic relationship between 

words of question-comment pairs based on deep 

convolution and pooling. Secondly, there are large 

amount of noise information involved in CQA, 

such as various emotional symbols and the 

abbreviated words. The feature-engineering of 

CRF based method generally suffers from the 

quality of dataset. Besides of that, the divergences 

of class distribution between the development and 

test influence the effectiveness directly. Hence, 

our approach performs more powerful and 

adaptive to different dataset or new domain. We 

also can demonstrate this point by comparing the 

experimental results of CRF and CRF+V on the 

test (shown in Table 4). By integrating the 

distributed representation from our R&CNN, 

CRF+V improves 9% on Macro-F1, 7.74% on 

accuracy over CRF, and 4.53% in F1-value of 

predicting Good class. 

Taking only word embedding as the original 

features, our approach has achieved 53.82% in 

Macro-F1. In contrast, the supervised feature-rich 

(SFR) approach performs 57.29% in Macro-F1 by 

integrating multi-type features, such as word 

embedding, features from topic models and user 

metadata etc. The main reason for that is the low 

performance of our approach on predicting the 

answers of Potential class, which has a major 

import on Macro-F1 due to the effect of 

marcoaveraging. There are several factors for that 

result. The first is the imbalance distribution in 

training data, which is lacking of the train samples 

of Potential class. So the distributed models based 

purely on word embedding are not very well 

equipped to learn the meaningful representations 

for question and potential comments. Secondly, 

Potential class is an intermediate category 

(Màrquez et al., 2015) that was quite hard to 

human annotators. Hence, surface-form matching 

between the words of question-comment pair is 

hard to identify its correct class merely using word 

embedding.  

In addition, when considering the heavy 

reliance of feature-engineer of SFR in comparison 

to the simplicity of our approach, the Macro-F1 

our approach obtained is highly encouraging. 

What’s more, our model achieves the 

start-of-the-art in accuracy and F1-value of Good 

class. These promising results indicate the 

effectiveness of our approach in predicting the 

high-quality comments in CQA. 

4 Conclusion 

In this paper, we present a comment labeling 

system based on the deep learning architecture. 

Without the complicated feature-engineering and 

external semantic resources, the recurrent 

convolutional neural networks (R&CNN) 

approach proposed by us not only is able to 

capture semantic matching patterns between 

question and comments, but also learn the 

meaningful context in the comment sequence. In 

this answer selection task, our approach achieves 

the state-of-the-art on recognizing good comments, 

and performs better accuracy than baselines while 

obtains powerful results in Macro-F1. 

In the future, we would like to investigate the 

methods of training the imbalance data (e.g. the 

Potential class) to improve the performances of 

our approach, such as the typical oversampling 

and undersampling methods.
