Abstract

Computational Humor involves several
tasks, such as humor recognition, hu-
mor generation, and humor scoring, for
which it is useful to have human-curated
data. In this work we present a corpus
of 27,000 tweets written in Spanish and
crowd-annotated by their humor value and
funniness score, with about four annota-
tions per tweet, tagged by 1,300 people
over the Internet. It is equally divided
between tweets coming from humorous
and non-humorous accounts. The inter-
annotator agreement Krippendorff’s alpha
value is 0.5710. The dataset is available
for general usage and can serve as a basis
for humor detection and as a first step to
tackle subjectivity.

1 Introduction

Computational Humor studies humor from a com-
putational perspective, involving several tasks
such as humor recognition, which aims to tell if
a piece of text is humorous or not; humor gener-
ation, with the objective of generating new texts
with funny content; and humor scoring, whose
goal is to predict how funny a piece of text is.

In order to carry out this kind of tasks through
supervised machine learning methods, human-
curated data is necessary. Castro et al. (2016)
built a humor classifier for Spanish and provided
a dataset for humor recognition. However, there
are some issues: few annotations per instance,
low annotator agreement, and limited variety of
sources for the humorous and mostly for the non-
humorous tweets (the latter were only about news,
inspirational thoughts and curious facts). Up
to our knowledge, there is no other dataset to
work on humor comprehension in Spanish. Some

other authors, such as Mihalcea and Strapparava
(2005a,b); Sjöbergh and Araki (2007) have tackled
humor recognition in English texts, building their
own corpora by downloading one-liners (one-
sentence jokes) from the Internet, since working
with longer texts would involve additional work,
such as determining humor scope.

The microblogging platform Twitter has been
found particularly useful for building humor cor-
pora due to its public availability and the fact that
its short messages are suitable for jokes or hu-
morous comments. Castro et al. (2016) built their
corpus based on Twitter, selecting nine humorous
accounts and nine non-humorous accounts about
news, thoughts and curious facts. Reyes et al.
(2013) built a corpus for detecting irony in tweets
by searching for several hashtags (i.e., #irony, #hu-
mor, #education and #politics), which is also used
in Barbieri and Saggion (2014) to train a classifier
that detects humor. More recently, Potash et al.
(2017) built a corpus based on tweets that aims
to distinguish the degree of funniness in a given
tweet. They used the tweet set issued in response
to a TV game show, labeling which tweets were
considered humorous by the show.

In this work we present a crowd-annotated
Spanish corpus of tweets tagged with a humor/no
humor value and also by a funniness score from
one to five. The corpus contains tweets extracted
from varied sources and has several annotations
per tweet, reaching a high humor inter-annotator
agreement.

The contribution of this work is twofold: the
dataset is not only useful for building a humor
classifier but it also serves to approach subjectivity
in humor and funniness. Even though there are not
enough annotations per tweet as required to study
subjectivity in a genuine way with techniques such
as the ones by Geng (2016), the dataset aids as a
playground to study the funniness and disagree-

ment among several people.
This document is organized as follows. Sec-

tion 2 explains where and how we obtained the
data, and Section 3 describes how it was anno-
tated. In Section 4 we present the corpus, and we
address the analysis in Section 5. Finally, in Sec-
tion 6 we present draw the conclusions and present
the future work.

2 Extraction

The aim of the extraction and annotation process
was to build a corpus of at least 20,000 tweets that
was as balanced as possible between the humor
and not humor classes. Furthermore, as we in-
tended to have a way of calculating the funniness
score of a tweet, we needed to have several votes
for the tweets that were considered humorous.

As we wanted to have both humorous and
non-humorous tweet samples, we extracted tweets
from selected accounts and from realtime sam-
ples. For the former, based on Castro et al. (2016),
we selected tweets from fifty humorous accounts
from Spanish speaking countries, and took a ran-
dom sample of size 12,000. For the latter, we
fetched tweet samples written in Spanish through-
out February 20181, and from this collection we
took another random sample of size 12,000. Note
that we preferred to take realtime tweet samples
as we did not want to bias by selecting certain
negative examples, such as news or inspirational
thoughts as in Castro et al. (2016) and Mihalcea
and Strapparava (2005b). From both sources we
ignored retweets, responses, citations and tweets
containing links, as we wanted the text to be self-
contained. As expected, both sources contained
a mix of humorous and non-humorous tweets. In
the case of humorous accounts, this may be due to
the fact that many tweets are used to increase the
number of followers, expressing an opinion on a
current event or supporting some popular cause.

We first aimed to have five votes for each tweet,
and to decide which tweet was humorous by sim-
ple majority. However, at a certain stage during
the annotation process, we noticed that the users
were voting too many tweets as non-humorous,
and the result was highly unbalanced. Because
of this, we made some adjustments in the cor-
pus and the process: as the target was to have
five votes for each tweet, we considered that the

REST API.

Figure 1: Example of a tweet presented to the an-
notators. It says: I hate being bipolar, it’s so cool!.
The annotator is asked whether the tweet intends
to be humorous. The available options are “Yes”,
“No” or “Skip”. If the annotator selects “Yes”, five
emoji are shown so the annotator can specify how
funny he considers the tweet. The emoji also in-
clude labels describing the funniness levels.

tweets that already had three non-humorous anno-
tations at this stage should be considered as not
humor, then we deprioritized them so the users
could focus in annotating the rest of the tweets that
were still ambiguous. We also injected 4,500 more
tweets randomly extracted only from the humor-
ous accounts. These new tweets were also priori-
tized since they had less annotations than the rest.

3 Annotation

A crowdsourced web annotation task was carried
out to tag all tweets.2 The annotators were shown
tweets as in Fig. 1. The tweets were randomly cho-
sen but web session information was kept to avoid
showing duplicates. We tried to keep the user in-
terface as intuitive and self-explanatory as possi-
ble, trying not to induce any bias on users and let-
ting them come up with their own definition of hu-
mor. The simple and friendly interface is meant to
keep the users engaged and having fun while clas-
sifying tweets as humorous or not, and how funny
they are, with as few instructions as possible.

If a person decides that a tweet is humorous, he
has to rate it between one to five by using emoji.
In this way, the annotator gives more information
rather than just stating the tweet is humorous. We
also allowed to skip a tweet or click a help button
for more information. We consider that explic-
itly asking the annotator if the text intends to be
humorous makes the distinction between the Not
Humorous and Not Funny classes less ambiguous,

which we believe was a problem of (Castro et al.,
2016) user interface. Also, we consider our emoji
rated funniness score to be clearer for annotators
than their stars based rating.

The web page was shared on popular social net-
works along with some context about the task and
the annotation period occurred between March 8th

and 27th, 2018. The first tweets shown to every
session were the same: three tweets for which we
know a clear answer (one of them was humorous
and the other two were not). These first tweets
(“test tweets”) were meant as a way of introducing
the user into how the interface works, and also as
an initial way for evaluating the quality of the an-
notations. After the introductory tweets, the rest of
the tweets were sampled randomly, starting with
the ones with the least number of votes.

4 Corpus

The dataset consists of two CSV files: tweets and
annotations. The former contains the identifier
and origin (which can be the realtime samples or
the selected accounts) for each one of the 27, 282
tweets3, while the latter contains the tweet iden-
tifier, session identifier, date and annotation value
for each one of the 117, 800 annotations received
during the annotation phase (including the times
the skip button was pressed, 2, 959 times). The
dataset was released and it is available online.4

When compiling the final version of the corpus,
we considered the annotations of users that did
not answer the first three tweets correctly as hav-
ing lower quality. These sessions should not be
used for training or testing machine learning algo-
rithms. Fortunately, only a small number of anno-
tations had to be discarded because of this reason.
The final number of annotations is 107, 634 (not
including the times the skip button was pressed),
including 3, 916 annotations assigned to the test
tweets themselves.

5 Analysis

5.1 Annotation Distribution

Each tweet received 3.8 annotations on average,
with a standard deviation of 1.16, not consider-
ing the test tweets as they are outliers (they have
a large number of annotations). The annotation

distribution is shown in Fig. 2. The histogram is
highly concentrated: more than 98% of the tweets
received between two and six annotations each.
Even though the strategy was to show random
tweets among the ones with less annotations, note
that there are tweets with less than three annota-
tions because some annotations were finally fil-
tered out. At the same time, there are some tweets
with more than six annotations because we merged
annotations from a few dozen duplicate tweets.
Also, note that there is a considerable amount of
tweets with at least six annotations (1, 001). This
subset can be useful to study the different annota-
tor opinions under the same instances.

5.2 Class Distribution

Fig. 3 shows how the classes are distributed be-
tween the annotations. Roughly two thirds were
assigned to the class Not Humorous, agreeing with
the fact that there seem to be more non-humorous
tweets from humorous accounts than the other way
around. The graph also indicates that there is a
bias towards bad jokes in humor, according to the
annotators. We use simple majority of votes for
categorizing between humorous or not humorous,
and weighted average for computing the funniness
score only for humorous tweets. The scale goes
from one (Not Funny) to five (Excellent). Un-
der this scheme, 27.01% of the tweets are humor-
ous, 70.6% are not-humorous while 2.39% is un-
decided (2.38% tied and 0.01% no annotations).
At the same time, humorous tweets have little fun-
niness overall: the funniness score average is 1.35
and standard deviation 0.85.

5.3 Annotators Distribution

There were 1, 271 annotators who tagged the
tweets roughly as follows: two annotators tagged
13, 000 tweets, then one annotated 8, 000, the next
eight annotated between one and three thousand,

the next 105 annotated between one hundred and
one thousand and the rest annotated less than a
hundred, having 32, 584 annotations in total (see
Fig. 4). The average was 83 tags by annotator,
with a standard deviation of 597.

5.4 Annotators Agreement

An important aspect to analyze is to what extent
the annotators agree on which tweets are humor-
ous. We used the alpha measure from Krippen-
dorff (2012), a generalized version of the kappa
measure (Cohen, 1960; Fleiss, 1971) that takes
in account an arbitray number of raters. The
agreement alpha value on humorous versus non-
humorous is 0.5710. According to Fleiss (1981),
it means that the agreement is somewhat between
“moderate” to “substantial”, suggesting there is
acceptable agreement but the humans cannot com-
pletely agree. We believe that the carefully de-
signed user interface impacted in the quality of
the annotation, as unlike Castro et al. (2016)
this work’s annotation web page presented less
ambiguity between the class Not Humorous and
Not Funny. We clearly outperformed their inter-
annotator agreement (which was 0.3654). Addi-
tionally, if we consider the whole corpus (includ-
ing the removed annotations), this figure decreases
to 0.5512. This shows that the test tweets were
helpful to filter out low quality annotations.

Additionally, we can try to estimate to what ex-
tent the annotators agree on the funniness value
of the tweets. In this case, disagreement between
close values in the scale (e.g. Not Funny and Lit-
tle Funny) should have less impact than disagree-
ment between values that are further (e.g. Not
Funny and Excellent). Following Stevens (1946),
in the previous case we were dealing with a nomi-
nal measure while in this case it is an ordinal mea-
sure. Alpha considers this into the formula by us-
ing a generic distance function between ratings, so
we applied it and obtained a value of 0.1625 which
is far from good; it is closer to a random annota-
tion. There is a lack of agreement on the funni-
ness. In this case, a machine will not be able to as-
sign a unique value of funniness to a tweet, which
makes sense with its subjectivity, albeit other tech-
niques could be used (Geng, 2016). In this case,
if we consider the whole dataset, this number de-
creases to 0.1442.

If we only consider the eleven annotators who
tagged more than a thousand times (who tagged
50, 939 times in total), the humor and funniness
agreement are respectively 0.6345 and 0.2635.

6 Conclusion and Future Work

Our main contribution is a corpus of tweets in
Spanish labeled by their humor value and funni-
ness score with respect to a crowd-sourced anno-
tation. The dataset contains 27, 282 tweets com-
ing from multiple sources, with 107, 634 annota-
tions. The corpus showed high quality because of
the significant inter-annotator agreement value.

The dataset serves to build a Spanish humor
classifier, but it also serves as a first step to tackle
humor and funniness subjectivity. Even though
more annotations per tweet would be appropriate,
there is a subset of a thousand tweets with at least
six annotations that could be used to study peo-
ple’s opinion on the same instances.

Future steps involve gathering more annotations
per tweet for a considerable amount of tweets, so
techniques such as the ones in (Geng, 2016) could
be used to study how people perceive the humor-
ous pieces and what subjects and phrases they con-
sider funnier. It would be interesting to consider
social strata (e.g. origin, age and gender) when try-
ing to find these patterns. Additionally, a similar
dataset could be built for other languages which
count with more data to cross over with (such as
English) and build a humor classifier exploiting re-
