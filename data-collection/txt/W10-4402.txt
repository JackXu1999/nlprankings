Abstract

In this paper, we show that the analysis of
right-node-raising (RNR) in coordinate struc-
tures proposed in Sarkar and Joshi (1996) can
be extended to non-local RNR if it is aug-
mented with delayed tree locality (Chiang and
Scheffler, 2008), but not with flexible com-
position (Joshi et al., 2003). In the proposed
delayed tree-local analysis, we define multi-
component (MC) elementary tree sets with
contraction set specification. We propose that
a member of each of the MC sets participates
in forming a derivational unit called contrac-
tion path in the derivation structure, and that
contraction paths must be derivationally local
to each other for the relevant contraction to be
licensed.

1 Introduction

The term right node raising (RNR) was coined by
Ross (1967) to describe constructions such as (1), in
which an element, here the DP the theory, appears to
be syntactically and semantically shared at the right
periphery of the rightmost conjunct of a coordinate
structure.1 Furthermore, RNR may share an ele-
ment at unbounded embedding depths (Wexler and
Culicover, 1980). In (2)-(5), the shared argument is
the object of the verb complement clauses, relative
clauses, adjunct clauses and DPs embedded in the
coordinating clauses.2 We can thus characterize ex-
amples such as (1) as local RNR and examples such

1Subsequently, RNR has been shown to apply to noncoor-
dinate structures as well. These will be discussed in Section
5.

Potter (2010) for discussion of shared modifiers in an analysis
similar to Sarkar and Joshi (1996).

as (2)-(5) as non-local RNR.3

Early transformational analyses, e.g. Ross (1967),
explained RNR by extending the standard notion of
movement to allow across-the-board (ATB) move-
ment, in which two underlying copies of the shared
material are identified during movement, yielding
a single overt copy located ex situ, outside of the
coordinate structure. This type of analysis implies
that, apart from the ATB aspect of the movement,
RNR should otherwise behave as typical movement.
This prediction is not borne out, however, as RNR
is freely able to violate both the island constraints
and the right-roof constraint. In example (3), the
DP the theory is the argument of the verbs in the
relative clauses, which are complex noun phrase is-
lands. Under the ex situ analysis, depicted in (6), the
shared argument raises out of the coordinate struc-
ture, thereby also escaping the complex noun phrase
island. Such movement also violates the right-roof
constraint, which limits rightward movement to a
landing site one bounding node above the source
(Sabbagh, 2007). If the relevant bounding nodes are
vP and TP and the shared argument is merged under
vP, movement outside of the coordinated TP struc-
ture would violate this constraint. Such behaviours

ments (Hartmann, 2000; Féry and Hartmann, 2005).

are unpredicted if RNR is derived from movement
of the shared element to a position outside of the co-
ordinate structure.

taught ti ]] and [TP Tim [vP dislikes the
student who debunked ti ]] the theoryi.

While some attempt has been made to explain the
unpredicted behaviour of RNR in the ex situ anal-
ysis, e.g. Sabbagh (2007), an alternative approach
to RNR is available which circumvents these com-
plications by locating the shared elements in situ.
Sarkar and Joshi (1996) propose such an in situ anal-
ysis using Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG), positing
that the shared element is located in the canonical
position within the rightmost conjunct. One signifi-
cant consequence of this analysis is that the contrast
between movement and RNR requires no explana-
tion; RNR is not derived from movement, and thus
their differences in behaviour are unremarkable.

However, the implementation of Sarkar and
Joshi’s analysis does make clear predictions for the
locality of RNR: it predicts that non-local RNR is
illicit. As will be discussed in Section 2, the mech-
anism proposed by Sarkar and Joshi only permits
sharing between two elementary trees that are di-
rectly composed. Thus, examples such as (1), in
which the shared element the theory is an object
of the two clauses being coordinated, are permitted.
On the other hand, examples such as (2)-(5) are ex-
cluded, as the shared arguments in these examples
are not objects of the coordinated clauses, but rather
objects of clauses embedded within the coordinated
clauses. Thus, an unattested contrast in grammati-
cality is again predicted, in this case between local
and non-local RNR.

The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows. In Section 2, we first illustrate how local RNR
is handled in Sarkar and Joshi (1996), using ele-
mentary trees that conform to Frank’s (2002) Con-
dition on Elementary Tree Minimality (CETM). We
then demonstrate how the mechanisms in Sarkar and
Joshi cannot derive instances of non-local RNR with
standard TAG. We consider two ways of augment-
ing the analysis, one with delayed tree locality (Chi-
ang and Scheffler 2008) in Section 3, and the other
with flexible composition (Joshi et al. 2003) in Sec-
tion 4. We show that only the analysis with delayed

tree locality yields well-formed derivation in TAG.
In Section 5, we briefly discuss cases of noncoordi-
nate RNR and show that our proposed analysis can
be extended to these cases as well.

2 Sarkar and Joshi 1996

Sarkar and Joshi utilize elementary trees with con-
traction sets and coordinating auxiliary trees. The
elementary trees necessary to derive (1) are illus-
trated in Figure 1. Note that (αthe theory) is a
valid elementary tree conforming to Frank’s CETM,
as a noun can form an extended projection with
a DP, in line with the DP Hypothesis. Also, el-
ementary trees such as (βand dislikes{DP}) are in
accordance with CETM, as coordinators are func-
tional heads (Potter 2010). In each of (αlikes{DP})
and (βand dislikes{DP}), the object DP node is in
the contraction set, notated as a subscript in the
tree name and marked in the tree with a circle
around it, and represents a shared argument. When
(βand dislikes{DP}) adjoins to (αlikes{DP}), the
two trees will undergo contraction, sharing the node
in the contraction set. Effectively, in the derived tree,
the two nodes are identified, merging into one, and
in the derivation tree, a DP simultaneously substi-
tutes into the contraction nodes.

The derived and derivation structures are given
in Figure 2. In (δ1), (αthe theory) substitutes
into (αlikes{DP}) and (βand dislikes{DP}) simul-
taneously at the DP node, and in (γ1), the ob-
ject DPs are merged into one. These are thus di-
rected graphs: a single node is dominated by mul-
tiple nodes. Looking at (δ1) again, the elemen-
tary trees that are contracted are local to each other
derivationally: (αlikes{DP}) immediately domi-
nates (βand dislikes{DP}). It is this local relation-
ship that licenses contraction.

However, in instances of non-local RNR, this
local relationship does not obtain. The intended
derived structure for (3), for example, is given
in Figure 5, using the elementary trees in Fig-
ures 1 and 3.4 But the structure in Figure 5
cannot be generated with the given elementary
trees, as it would require an illicit derivation, de-

4Note that (αlikes) and (βand dislikes) trees are same as
(αlikes{DP}) and (βand dislikes{DP}), except that these do not
have contraction nodes.

between the two relative clause elementary trees
(βtaught{DP}) and (βdebunked{DP}). These rela-
tive clause trees though are not derivationally local
to each other: they must each adjoin to the DP trees

must substitute into the object positions of (αlikes)

MC set to compose with different elementary trees
as long as the members eventually compose into the
same elementary tree. In the derivation structure, the
members of the MC set do not need to be immedi-
ately dominated by a single node, though there must
be a node that dominates all the members of the MC
set. The lowest such node is called the destination
of an MC set. The delay of an MC set is the union
of the paths from the destination to each member of
the MC set, excluding the destination itself.

In deriving (3), we propose MC elementary tree
sets for relative clauses with shared nodes, as in Fig-
ure 6. We postulate a structural constraint between
the two trees in the MC set: the degenerate tree com-
ponent must dominate the relative clause tree com-
ponent in the derived structure.

In effect, with the addition of the MC tree sets
such as those in Figure 6, the specification of con-
traction sets is now divorced from the elementary
trees that compose through coordination. To accom-
modate this separation, we need to extend the licens-
ing condition for contraction. We take an elementary
tree participating in coordination and the immedi-
ately dominated degenerate tree with contraction set
as a derivational unit, and call it a contraction path.
We propose that contraction between two MC sets
A and B is licensed if A and B have corresponding
contraction sets, and the contraction path containing
the degenerate tree component of A either immedi-
ately dominates or is immediately dominated by the
contraction path containing the degenerate tree com-
ponent of B.

The delayed tree-local derivation for (3) is
depicted in the derivation structure in Figure
7, generating the derived structure in Figure 5.
(βtaught1{DP}) adjoins to (αthe professor), and
(βtaught2{DP}), a degenerate tree, adjoins to
the TP node of (αlikes). (βand dislikes) adjoins
to this TP, and (βdebunked2{DP}) adjoins to
the TP of (βand dislikes). (βdebunked1{DP})
adjoins to (αthe student) which substitutes into
(βand dislikes). The delay of the (taught{DP})
MC set is {(βtaught1{DP}), (βtaught2{DP}),
(αthe professor)} and the delay of the
(debunked{DP}) MC set is {(βdebunked1{DP}),
(βdebunked2{DP}), (αthe student)}. As no deriva-
tion node is a member of more than one delay, this
is a 1-delayed tree-local MC-TAG derivation. In this

derivation, (αlikes) and (βtaught2{DP}) form a con-
traction path, which immediately dominates another
contraction path, made up of (βand dislikes), a
coordinating auxiliary tree, and (βdebunked2{DP}),
a degenerate tree with a corresponding contrac-
tion set specification. As the two paths are local
to each other, contraction of the object DPs in
the relative clause trees, (βtaught1{DP}) and
(βdebunked1{DP}), is licensed.

The proposed analysis can rule out (7), where
RNR has taken place across a coordinating clause
without a shared argument.

and [Tim dislikes the student who took the

Due to the domination constraint between the
two trees in the MC set, the only plausible
derivation is as in Figure 8. But node con-
traction is not licensed in this derivation, as the
two contraction paths, one containing (αlikes)
and (βtaught2{DP}), and the other containing
(βand hates) and (βdebunked2{DP}), are separated
by (βand dislikes). As the two paths are not deriva-
tionally local to each other, contraction between the
relative clauses is not licensed.

Local RNR can also be accounted for in terms
of the proposed MC set with the contraction set
specification, and contraction paths. Returning to
(1), its derivation structure can be recast as in Fig-
ure 10, using the MC sets in Figure 9. In Chi-
ang and Scheffler’s definition of delayed tree-local
MC-TAG, one member of an MC set is allowed

4 Derivation using Flexible Composition

We now attempt to augment Sarkar and Joshi’s anal-
ysis with tree-local MC-TAG with flexible compo-
sition. Flexible composition can be seen as reverse-
adjoining: instead of β adjoining onto α at node η,
α splits at η and wraps around β. By reversing the
adjoining this way, tree-locality can be preserved in
an otherwise non-local MC-TAG derivation.

Figure 11: Illegal derivation structure for John likes the
professor who taught and Tim dislikes the student who
debunked the theory with flexible composition

As depicted in the derivation structure in Fig-
ure 11, flexible composition seems to keep the
derivation tree-local: (αthe professor) reverse-
adjoins to (βtaught1{DP}) which in turn sub-
stitutes into (αlikes), and (βtaught2{DP}), the
other component of the (taught{DP}) MC set
adjoins to (αlikes). And (βand dislikes) ad-
joins to (βtaught2{DP}), (βdebunked2{DP})
adjoins to (βand dislikes), and (αthe student)
reverse-adjoins to (βdebunked1{DP}), which
allows (βdebunked1{DP}) to substitute into
(βand dislikes). The contraction path containing
(αlikes) and (βtaught2{DP}) and the one containing
(βand dislikes) and (βdebunked2{DP}) are local to
each other, and so contraction between the relative
clauses should in principle be possible.

But there is a problem with this derivation: it
substitutes (βtaught1{DP}) and (βdebunked1{DP})
into (αlikes) and (βand dislikes) respectively. This
is problematic because these substitutions are us-
ing new DP nodes created by the reverse-adjoining
of (αthe professor) to (βtaught1) and (αthe student)
to (βdebunked1). Though this composition is al-
lowed by the definition in Joshi et al. (2003), it is
not allowed by the definition in Chiang and Schef-
fler (2008), where it is speculated that allowing such
derivation may increase the weak generative capac-
ity beyond standard TAG.

This result provides further support for Chiang
and Scheffler’s (2008) observation that while any
derivation using flexible composition can alterna-
tively be expressed in a 2-delayed tree-local MC-
TAG, a derivation using a 1-delayed tree-local anal-
ysis may not be expressed in an MC-TAG with flex-
ible composition. To verify this observation, Chiang

and Scheffler used ECM construction where there
is a binding relationship between the matrix subject
and the ECM subject, as in (8).

(8) John believes himself to be a decent guy.
(Ryant and Scheffler, 2006)

They show that though there is a simple derivation
using a 1-delayed tree-local MC-TAG, the deriva-
tion with flexible composition originally proposed
for (8) by Ryant and Scheffler (2006) is actually il-
legal. There, a reverse-adjoining takes place at a site
that is created by a reverse-substitution. We have es-
sentially obtained the same results with the deriva-
tion of non-local RNR.

5 Noncoordinate RNR

Following Hudson (1976), Napoli (1983), Goodall
(1987), Postal (1994), and Phillips (2003), and as
illustrated in (9) and (10), RNR is possible in non-
coordinated structures.

(9) a. [David changed ] while [Angela dis-
tracted the baby].

b. [I organize ] more than [I actually run
her life].

c. [I organize ] although [I don’t really run
her life].

(10) a. Of the people questioned, those [who
liked ] outnumbered by two to one those
[who disliked the way in which the de-
valuation of the pound had been han-
dled]. (Hudson, 1976)

b. Politicians [who have fought for ] may
well snub those [who have fought against
animal rights]. (Postal, 1994)

c. The professor [who taught ] dislikes the
student [who debunked the theory].

Our proposed analysis of coordinate RNR can
straightforwardly be extended to the examples in (9).
In the derivation of each of the examples, the ele-
mentary tree representing the adjunct clause adjoins
to the matrix clause, just as the elementary tree rep-
resenting the coordinated clause did. These elemen-
tary trees thus form a natural class with coordinating
elementary trees, and as such, they can each form
a contraction path with the immediately dominated

degenerate tree. And since the contraction path con-
taining the degenerate tree member representing the
matrix clause immediately dominates the one con-
taining the degenerate tree member of the adjunct
clause, contraction of the object DPs is licensed.

Unlike the cases of coordinate RNR and the ex-
amples in (9), in the examples in (10), the second
clause containing the shared argument is not adjoin-
ing onto the first clause with the shared argument.
Rather, they are relative clauses, each contained in
the subject DP and the object DP. (10c), for example,
can thus be given a 1-delayed tree-local derivation as
in Figure 12, using the elementary tree sets in Fig-
ure 6. Here, the degenerate trees, (βtaught2{DP})
and (βdebunked2{DP}), both adjoin to (αdislikes),
forming two contraction paths, one containing
(αdislikes) and (βtaught2{DP}) and the other con-
taining (αdislikes) and (βdebunked2{DP}). The
two paths are in sister relation, which is arguably
as local as immediate domination relation. It
thus follows that the contraction of the object DPs
in the relative clause trees, (βtaught1{DP}) and
(βdebunked1{DP}), is licensed.

6 Conclusion

In this paper, we have observed that non-local RNR
calls for a TAG derivation that is more descriptively
powerful than the one of standard TAG, and applied
two such variants of TAG to the problem, tree-local
MC-TAG with flexible composition and 1-delayed
tree-local MC-TAG. We have shown that the analy-
sis of local RNR proposed in Sarkar and Joshi can be
extended to non-local RNR if it is augmented with
delayed tree locality but not with flexible composi-
tion. We have seen that the proposed analysis is con-
straining as well, ruling out non-contiguous RNR,
and can also be extended to handle cases of nonco-
ordinate RNR.
