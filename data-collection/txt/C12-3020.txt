ABSTRACT 

While the popularity of Twitter brings a plethora of Twitter researches, short, plain and informal 

tweet texts limit the research progress. This paper aims to investigate whether hyperlinks in 

tweets and their linked pages can be used to discover rich information for Twitter applications. 

The statistical analysis on the analysed hyperlinks offers the evidence that tweets contain a large 

amount of hyperlinks and a high percentage of hyperlinks introduce substantial and informative 

information from external resources. The usage of hyperlinks is examined on a self-defined 

hyperlink recommendation task. The recommended hyperlinks can not only provide more 

descriptive or explanatory information for the corresponding trending topics, but also pave the 

way for further applications, such as Twitter summarization.  

 

KEYWORDS : Twitter, Hyperlink Usage, Hyperlink Recommendation 

 

1. Introduction 

The shift of information center from the mainstream media to the general public drives a growth 

of social network sites among which Twitter is undoubtedly one of the popular applications now. 

In academia, Twitter researches have become a new hotspot (H. Kwak et al, 2010; D. Zhao and 

M. Rosson, 2009; M. Michael and N. Kouda, 2010). Existing researches mainly focus on tweet 

content and user communication, while ignoring external resources. However, the limitation is 

the plain and short tweet text, which contains 140 characters at most. Even worse, tweets are 

usually written with many informal expressions.  

It has been reported in (TechInfo, 2010) that about 25% of tweets contain hyperlinks and the 

proportion is increasing. Recently, even Twitter itself also provides an interface to allow people 

pay close attention to the tweets with hyperlinks. This move probably implies that (1) tweets 

contain a large amount of hyperlinks; and (2) hyperlinks in tweets may provide useful 

information for understanding topics. For instance, at the time when we write this paper, 

“William & Kate” is a popular topic of conversation. When we follow some arbitrary hyperlinks 

in the tweets under this topic, we are often directed to the Web pages containing the detailed 

information about their royal honeymoon (http://styleite.com/gjhao), the video of royal wedding 

(http://bit.ly/ld72jW) and the comments on their expensive wedding (http://ow.ly/1cKi99). 

Without length limit, a Web page tends to use a longer text describing the topics. Especially some 

of these hyperlinked pages are written by professional editors, and are much more regular than 

ordinary tweets. “William & Kate” is just an example here. But it motivates us to seek for the 

answers for the following questions:  

Q1: How popular are hyperlinks in tweets? 

Q2: Can these hyperlinks provide additional, useful and relevant information for 

understanding topics? 

155



Q3: What kinds of information can be explored from hyperlinked Web pages?  

To answer these questions, we download ten trending topics from Twitter.com and annotate 2018 

hyperlinks in selected tweets to categorize the information presented in the hyperlinked pages. 

The statistical analysis of the annotation results indicates that 44% of tweets contain hyperlinks, 

among them 35% of examined hyperlinks are worth are worth further exploration, Actually, our 

study on hyperlink usage analysis indicates that about 70% of those valuable hyperlinked pages 

provide descriptive or explanatory information regarding the topics, which is much richer and 

more formal than that brought by tweets themselves. All these statistics suggests that hyperlinked 

pages can be used as external resources to assist understanding or interpretation of topics. They 

have many potential uses in Twitter applications. For example, trending topics explanation and 

summarization, can be generated from hyperlinked pages, rather than just from obscure and 

incoherent summary with informal tweets.  

In this paper, the usage of hyperlinks is examined on a self-defined hyperlink recommendation 

task. Here, hyperlink recommendation is defined to recommend the high-quality hyperlinks (i.e., 

the hyperlinks that provide most relevant textual information beyond Twitter text) for trending 

topics. The task is cast as a typical binary classification problem. Considering the small size of 

available labelled dataset and unlimited unlabelled dataset, a semi-supervised learning technique, 

called co-training, is employed to Leveraging the huge amount of unlabelled data resource to 

enhance classification performance. The results are promising. We hope our study will shed some 

light on the researches of Twitter hyperlink and its applications. 

2. Hyperlink Analysis 

To collect enough tweets, the public Twitter APIs (dev.twitter.com) are used to download tweets 

from the Twitter websites in real-time. We manually select ten trending topics from Twitter.com 

and download 81,530 related tweets with Twitter APIs from March 2 to March 12, 2011. These 

trending topics cover the main categories of trending topics. To answer the question 1 in 

Introduction, analysis is carried out on these tweets to determine the ratio of tweets with 

hyperlinks. In overall, the tweets with hyperlinks account for 44% of all the tweets, which is 

much higher than the data (25%) reported in (TechInfo, 2010) in July, 2010. This statistics 

answers the first question raised in Section 1. Meanwhile, we can also observe that the tweets 

belonging to the technology and emergency categories are more likely to include hyperlinks.   

With such a high proportion of tweets containing hyperlinks, the next issue concerned is to 

examine the percentage of the hyperlinks that can provide additional relevant information about 

the topic, or to say how many of the posted hyperlinks are useful for understanding or 

interpreting the topic (and the tweets about the topic`). This is to answer the question 2 in 

Introduction. To this end, we randomly selected 2018 hyperlinks for further analysis. These 

hyperlinks are annotated as useful, off-topic, spam, error-links, and non-English hyperlinks. The 

term useful here means that the Web pages can provide relevant information for trending topics 

while the spam hyperlinks refer to the Web pages with the evidential intention of advertising, e.g. 

advertisements, or some e-commercial pages. The off-topic hyperlinks are those pointing to the 

Web pages with no relevant information and the error-link hyperlinks are invalid ones. As 

exhibited in Figure 1.(a), among 2018 selected hyperlinks, the useful hyperlinks take up 35%. A 

much higher ratio is shown in the technology and emergency categories, while the ratio of meme 

category is much lower than the others. These observations indicate that the amount of hyperlinks 

in tweets can be used to provide related information for given trending topics. Meanwhile, the 

higher ratio in technology and emergency and the lower in meme category also indicate that the 

156



divergence of useful hyperlinks across the categories is striking. We also find that most non-

useful hyperlinks are off-topic hyperlinks (42%), especially in Meme category. This indicates the 

necessity of useful hyperlinks identification. 

FIGURE 1 – (a) Proportion of useful hyperlinks; (b) Proportion of hyperlink purpose 

To answer the question 3, the purpose of useful hyperlinked pages is investigated to evaluate 

what kind of information can be discovered from hyperlinked pages. We categorize the purpose 

of useful hyperlinked pages as source information, background information, supportive 

information, comment and others. These categories can direct researchers to explore different 

applications, e.g. information source Web pages is kind of help in trending topic explanations and 

summarization while the comment Web pages tends to be important in opinion mining. As Figure 

1.(b) suggests 69% of the annotated useful hyperlinked pages convey information about the 

source of trending topics, which can be also regarded as explanations to the trending topics. 

Similarly, the higher ratios occur in the technology and emergency trending category and a lower 

ratio appears in the meme category. 

Now we can conclude that tweets contain a large amount of hyperlinks and a high percentage of 

hyperlinks introduce substantial and informative information from external resources, though the 

quality of hyperlinks vary from category to category. 

3. Hyperlink Recommendation 

Since the statistics analysis on Twitter hyperlinks suggests that it is worth to explore the external 

information, we propose a new task, namely hyperlink recommendation, to recommend useful 

hyperlinks that provide most relevant information that beyond Twitter text for the corresponding 

trending topics. The significance of this hyperlink recommendation task is to pave the way for 

future researches that may need to identify the useful hyperlinks beforehand in order to enrich the 

text presentation of tweets or discover topic background information etc.  

In this preliminary study, hyperlink recommendation is cast as a typical binary classification 

problem by separating the useful hyperlinks that provide the relevance information for a trending 

topic from the others. Useful hyperlinks are further ranked according to their relevance and 

credibility. The top ones are regards as the recommended hyperlinks. One problem is the 

insufficient labelled data for effective learning. Fortunately, compared with the limited annotated 

hyperlinks, a large amount of unlabelled Twitter hyperlinks are available from Twitter.com. Thus, 

we choose to adopt semi-supervised learning as a solution to incorporate the unlabelled data to 

enhance the classification performance.  

157



We consider two sets of features for this classification task. They are the features related to 

tweets and topics of tweets, such as trending topics category and the average tweet length, and 

the features related to the hyperlinks and the linked target pages, such as PageRank (PR) value of 

the page and the domain of links (see Table 1). While a co-training technique is devised based on 

the assumptions that the given task can be described with two redundant feature sets and each set 

is sufficient enough for classification (M. Li and Z. Zhou, 2007), the design of these two 

independent sets of features is just coincident with the co-training assumption.  

Features Set Examples 

Trending Topics Category Twt Entertainment, Meme, etc. 

Trending Created Time Twt ipad2"created_at":"2011-05-19T00:44:13", etc. 

Spelling Error Twt “frinds-> friends”, etc. 

Acronym / Emoticon Twt FAQ, 10x, Lemeno, etc./ “☺”, ”�”, “^o^” 

Repeating letter word Twt  “soooo”,“Awesome!!!!” , etc. 

Average (tweet length)/(sentence number) Twt (12, etc.)/(2, etc.) 

Similarity of tweet and trending Twt 0.17817, etc. 

PR value Hyl “www.apple.com” (PR value:9) 

Domain feature Hyl cnn or yahoo 

HF-ITF Hyl 0.4037, etc. 

Similarity of webpage and trending/tweets Hyl 0.1085, etc. 

TABLE 1 – Hyperlink features and examples, where Twt/Hyl denote tweet/hyperlink feature set 

As mentioned in Section 2, the quality of hyperlinks in different trending topic categories varies 

distinctly. Thus, the trending topic category is selected as one of the features. The created time of 

a trending topic is introduced as well. These two topic features can be extracted via the public 

APIs of “What the Trend” (www.whatthetrend.com). Regarding the tweet feature extraction, two 

perspectives are considered: text writing style and statistic information. The text writing style 

features focus on text expressions, including spelling error, acronym usage, emoticon usage, 

repeating letter word usage. The toolkits of Jazzy API are used to detect the spelling error. 

However, identifying the real spelling error in tweet is a challenging task when Twitter 

frequently broadcasts the messages that contains a large number of nouns not presents in a 

common dictionary (M. Kaufmann, 2010). The spelling checker will fail to recognize the correct 

nouns. Hence, we calculate the edit distance of the erroneous word and the suggested spelling by 

Jazzy. Only those pairs with distance less than 3 letters are corrected, like “frinds-> friends”, 

“Niether-> Neither”. For the acronym feature, we uses two publicly available acronyms word 

lists from SmartDefine (www.smartdefine.org) (e.g., “FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions”) and 

ChatOnline (www.chatslang.com) (e.g., “10x: Thanks”). Meanwhile, ChatOnline offers 273 

commonly-used emoticons like “☺”, “�” and “^o^”. These emoticons are used to detect the 

emoticon usage in tweets text. The last feature about tweet writing style is the use of words with 

repeating letter or punctuation, like “what’sssss up”, “soooo guilty” and “Awesome!!!!” etc. As 

for the tweet statistics features, average tweet length, average sentence words in tweets are 

concerned, and these features in certain degree reflect how much attention the tweet poster pay to 

the trending topic. Intuitively more attention implies that the tweet is more likely to contain a 

useful hyperlink. In case of hyperlink per se features, the domain information and Google Page-

rank value are extracted, which indicate the global importance of hyperlinks. hf-itf of a hyperlink 

is also introduced, where hf denotes the frequency of hyperlinks present in one topic, and itf 

denotes the frequency of hyperlinks across all the topics. We also calculate the cosine similarity 

158



between a hyperlinked page text and the collective text of the tweets containing that hyperlink, 

and between a hyperlinked pages and the trending topic it resides to indicate the content 

similarity. 

Typical co-training paradigm works as follows. Given a set of labelled instances L and a set of 

unlabelled instances U, co-training will first define two features views (V1 and V2, corresponding 

to the feature sets related to tweets/topics and related to hyperlinks in this study) on each instance 

in L and U, and specialize two classifiers (C1 and C2) on each view. In each iterative procedure, 

classifier C1 and C2 will be trained with labelled instance L on feature set V1 and V2 respectively 

and label all instance in U. Then, the n most confident new labelled instances L’ are allowed to 

update labelled dataset of L for the next iteration. The iteration terminates when all unlabelled 

instance U are labelled or nothing is changed. Normally, when parameter n increases, the quality 

of new labelled instances will decline and lead the unstable of co-training. To avoid this problem, 

we define the most confident instances as the ones with the same predicted labels by both 

classifiers. The advantage of co-training is that with sufficient feature sets, classifier C1 and 

classifier C2 can learn information from the unlabelled dataset and exchange it with the other one. 

Given the identified useful links for a given topic, we further rank them in terms of relevance and 

credibility and recommend the top ones to users. The ranking strategy is simple. We first rank the 

useful hyperlinks by their PR values which represent the global importance of hyperlinks. When 

several links receive the equal PR value, they are ordered according to the similarity between the 

hyperlinked page and the trending topic. 

4. Experiments and Discussion 
The experiments are conducted on the whole hyperlinks extracted from tweets, including both 

labeled and unlabeled hyperlinks. We come up with 230 labeled hyperlinks. We are randomly 

split into the training and test datasets (with ratio 4:1). Similarly, unlabeled hyperlinks are 

generated from the unlabeled hyperlinks. The evaluations of supervised learning on different 

feature sets are provided in Table 2 as the baseline of comparison. Figure 2 shows the co-training 

evaluations using different number of new labeled instances updated in each iteration (n). 

Comparing Table 2 and Figure 2, the significant improvement is observed in the precision of co-

training, which indicates the co-training can utilize two feature sets information to predict higher 

accuracy labels. The higher precision and lower recall of NB classifier reflect that co-training can 

help NB learn some accurate rules to precisely predict the label, but cannot balance with the 

coverage. In contrast, SVM is able to learn some complex “rules”, which can cover more 

instances, while the precision declines a bit.  

 NB P NB R NB F SVM P SVM R SVM F 

Integration 0.35 0.91 0.51 0.78 0.91 0.84 

Tweet 0.64 0.95 0.76 0.85 0.85 0.85 

Hyperlink 0.35 0.91 0.51 0.35 0.91 0.51 

TABLE 2 – Evaluation of supervised learning 

Additionally, compared with the performance of supervised learning with hyperlink features, a 

remarkable increase can be achieved by introducing tweet features, which indicates tweet 

features play an important role in useful hyperlink classification. To certain degree, these tweet 

features can be regarded as features of tweet relevance, which means tweet relevance can be a 

good indicator of usefulness hyperlink. When taking a closer look at the wrongly predicted 

instances, we found two main sources of errors. The precision error mainly results from the non-

text context type of the hyperlinked pages. For example, a video page can be regarded as useful 

by manual annotation, but with little text information it is hard for classifiers to predict correctly. 

159



The recall error is mainly caused by the Web page that simply has word overlaps with a trending 

topic but not really related to it. For example, the Web page of selling ipad2 is prone to be 

regarded as related to the trending topic of the launch of apple’s ipad2 by classifiers, but actually 

the page is not what the users care about. 

 
FIGURE 2 – Co-training evaluation 

Eventually, useful hyperlinks are ranked by their PR value and their similarities with trending 

topics. The top two hyperlinks that are recommended for some example topics are illustrated in 

Table 3. These recommended hyperlinks provide the information about the trending topics, and 

help to understand the trending topics especially for technology and emergency category. For 

example, one of the recommended hyperlinks for “#ipad2” is the homepage of the Apple official 

website, and the other one presents the new properties of ipad2. The recommended hyperlinks for 

“Frankfurt Airport” are also linked to some predominate websites, e.g. jiHadwatch.com, 

webpartner.com, etc. However, the quality of recommended hyperlinks for meme trending topics 

is lower than the others. The reasons are: (1) the proportion of useful hyperlinks in meme is lower 

than that in the others and (2) there is too much unrelated information in this category. This also 

echoes the annotation findings. 

In the future, we will continue to improve the performance of useful hyperlink classification by 

reducing the precision errors and recall errors. We would also like to further explore the usage of 

hyperlinks, and apply useful hyperlinks for potential applications.
