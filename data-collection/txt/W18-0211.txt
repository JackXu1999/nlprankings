Abstract

According to the wide-spread belief, although Nganasan has vowel harmony,
the harmonic class of a given stem is unpredictable, completely lexicalized. The
research made on two different digital sources of Nganasan (a lexicon of a mor-
phological analyzer with harmonic class of the stems tagged and a morpholog-
ically annotated corpus) shows that in most of the cases the harmonic class of
stems is well predictable based on the vowels in it. Nganasan vowels belong to
two harmonic classes except for one neutral vowel.

In the past decade, we have observed an intensive growth of computational lin-
guistic projects on Uralic languages. Some researchers build annotated corpora for
their own research, some others develop morphological analyzers for practical tasks
(spellchecking etc.). Since these instruments (analyzers, annotated corpora) give a

basic analysis of linguistic structure, even linguists who are not experts of the given
language are able to do research based on the annotation. However, althoughmany of
these sources are open or at least accessible in some way, it is very rare that someone
makes use of the sources built by others for their own research.

I would like to present how I utilized two different Nganasan digital resources
to solve a problem of Nganasan vowel harmony. Neither of these projects had been
intended to analyze phenomena connected to Nganasan vowel harmony. Further-
more, I am not an expert on Nganasan. However, thanks to digital resources, I could
discover regularities of Nganasan morphophonology unknown even for experts.

1 Nganasan vowel harmony: completely lexicalized har-
monic class?

TheNganasan vowel inventory contains eight vowels and two diphthongs (see Table 1,
based on Helimski 1998, 483 and Várnai 2002, 33).

Palatal Velar
illabial labial illabial labial

high i ü ı¹ u
mid e ə o
low a
diphthongs ⁱa ua

Table 1: The vowel system of Nganasan

Nganasan has two kinds of vowel harmony ( Helimski 1998, 492-493; Várnai 2002,
55-60). One of these is a palatovelar harmony with alternating pairs i : ı and ü : u.
The palatal variant is used when we find high palatal vowels (i or ü) in the preceding
syllable, the velar variant is used in any other case. Since palatovelar harmony works
only in cases when the other kind of vowel harmony (see below) also works, there is
always an i : ı : ü : u alternation. Palatovelar harmony is very regular; therefore, it is
not interesting for us.

The other kind of harmony is much more complex. The alternating pairs we find
in this kind of harmony are presented in Table 2 (the variants given in parentheses
are the results of palatovelar harmony described above).

¹This vowel is represented in different ways in different publications: ï ( Helimski 1998), i ̮( Várnai 2002;
Wagner-Nagy 2002a), ɨ ( Brykina et al.) etc.



123

after U stems after I stems
u (ü) ı (i)
a ı (i)
a ⁱa

Table 2: Suffix internal vowel alternation according to vowel harmony

In this alternation, the alternating pairs differ in a different property in each of the
three subtypes. In the first case, it seems to be a roundness harmony. In the second
case, the main difference is in vowel height. In the third case, the first component of
the diphthong differs in height and palatality from the alternating vowel, while the
second component is exactly the same. In the following, I call this type of harmonyU/I
harmony, while I call the first type of harmony discussed above palatovelar harmony.

Whereas palatovelar harmony in Nganasan is obviously a new phenomenon, U/I
harmony is a relict of the Uralic palatovelar harmony. Helimski ( Helimski 1998, 490)
states that as a result of changes in the vowel system, the patterns of vowel har-
mony have also changed. Following Helimski ( Helimski 1998, 490–491), literature
on Nganasan morphophonology states that today it is unpredictable whether a given
stem belongs to U stems or I stems ( Várnai 2002, 56, Várnai and Wagner-Nagy 2003,
322, Katzschmann 2008, 333–334).

Nonetheless, I supposed that the vowels of the stem may determine which har-
monic class a specific stem belongs to. I decided to check this hypothesis in digital
resources by statistical methods, using simple Perl scripts to see whether there is a
connection between the quality of the vowels and the harmonic class of the stem.

2 Vowel statistics based on a lexicon
Thefirst resource I used for my research was the lexicon of the Nganasan morphologi-
cal analyzer (http://www.morphologic.hu/urali/). This programwas developed
between 2001 and 2009 by BeátaWagner-Nagy, Zsuzsa Várnai, Sándor Szeverényi and
Attila Novák. Although the development of the analyzer also served as a test field of
the morphophonological rules described earlier, U/I harmony was not involved. The
lexicon was based on Chrestomathia Nganasanica ( Wagner-Nagy 2002b) and on a
Russian–Nganasan–Russian dictionary ( Kosterkina et al. 2001).

Attila Novák was kind to send me the lexicon file, so I was able to compare the
vowel skeleton of the stems to their harmonic class. In the lexicon file, verbs are
listed in their infinitive forms. Since the suffix of the infinitive alternates according

http://www.morphologic.hu/urali/


124

to U/I harmony, it was easy to determinate which harmonic class the given verb stem
belongs to. About the 7% of the 3359 suffixable (verb, noun, adjective and numeral)
stems were not tagged to belong to any of the harmonic classes, 19 stems were tagged
I/U or U/I, both meaning that the stem can be suffixed with suffixes belonging both to
the U and the I class: all these 19 stems were ignored. In the case of nouns, adjectives
and numerals, most of the stems were explicitly tagged as U stems or I stems. Some
stems belonging to some other parts of speech (adverbs, postpositions etc.) were also
suffixable and tagged as belonging to one of the harmonic classes. All stems assigned
to a certain harmonic classwere taken into account, independently of the fact towhich
part of speech they belonged to.

2.1 Method

For statistics, I wrote a Perl script. First of all, I took the lexical items, I removed
unnecessary information, so that only the stem form, the stem type and the meaning
remained. I also modified transcription to make it more readable, but here I will not
go into the details. The only thing I note is that I used å instead of ua and ä instead of
ⁱa to make pattern matching easier.

For every lexical item I generated a type, which contained only the harmonic class
of the stem and the vowel skeleton (consonants were removed from the word form).
I used two hashes, and the generated type served as a key in both of them. In the first
one, the value was always a string, which contained the stems belonging to the given
type. In the second one, the value was a number, and it contained the number of the
lexical items belonging to the given type.

For example, the lexicon contained the word kiriba ‘bread’ in the form presented
in Figure 1.

kiribaU[N:kenyér];en:;

Figure 1: Example line from the lexicon of the morphological analyzer

In this row, kiriba is the stem form, U indicates that this is a U stem, N is for noun,
kenyér is the meaning in Hungarian, en: should stand for the meaning in English, but
in most of the cases it is missing. The type of kiriba was U: iia indicating this is
a U stem and it contains three vowels in the given order. There were two more words
among U words with the same vowel skeleton: kirbiśa(n-) ‘knife, scissors, razor’ and
ťiiďa- ‘to hide’. Therefore, the value associated with the key U: iia in the first hash
was what is presented in Figure 2 below and 3 in the second hash.



125

kirbibśa� 'kés,| olló,| borotva'
kiriba 'kenyér'
ťiiďa- 'elrejt'

Figure 2: Value associated with U: iia in the first hash

When I needed the number of stems matching a given pattern, I took all the keys
from the second hash, and the sum of the values associated to the keys matching the
required pattern was the number I needed. E.g. when I needed U stems with an a
in the last syllable, I used the regular expression /ˆU: .*a$/. However, if I needed
specific examples, I used the first hash, and listed the values associated with the keys
matching the pattern.

2.2 Results

First of all, I took all the monosyllabic stems. If vowel quality is connected to the
stem class in any way, it is supposed to be clear when there is only one vowel in the
stem. The results presented in Table 3 showed that most of the monosyllabic stems
containing a rounded vowel, a or the diphthong ua belong to U stems.

U stems I stems
o 5 2
ü 7 1
a 12 0
ua 2 0

Table 3: Vowels tending to occur in U stems in monosyllabic words

The only rounded vowel that did not fit in this picture was u: although 5 mono-
syllabic stems with u belong to U stems and only 4 to I stems, the difference was not
enough to prove connection between u and the U class. However, it seemed to be clear
that most of the unrounded vowels are connected to the I class, as it is demonstrated
in Table 4.

Nonetheless, monosyllabic stems with ə showed no significant difference:² 3 of
them belonged to the U class and 5 of them to the I class.

²As a rough approach, I considered that data are significant if one of the two options has at least a
two-thirds majority.



126

U stems I stems
i 1 13
e 0 4
ı 2 6
ⁱa 0 3

Table 4: Vowels tending to occur in I stems in monosyllabic words

As a next step, I also examined polysyllabic stems containing the same vowel.
The picture did not radically change: the results showed that rounded vowels (in-
cluding the diphthong ua) and a are connected to U stems, and unrounded vowels
are connected to I stems: even stems with u showed the preference of U stems. The
monosyllabic and polysyllabic stems together show a clear preference in the cases
presented in Table 5.

U stems I stems
u 41 6
ü 53 2
a 54 1
i 4 75
ı 2 23

Table 5: Vowels tending to occur in U or I stems in mono- and polysyllabic words

Since non-first syllable e and o are rare, usually occurring in fresh loanwords, I
could not find any polysyllabic words with just e. However, there was one (native)
word with two os: ďoot ‘ember, firebrand’, and it was an I stem. Despite that fact I
considered o to be connected to U stems: maybe it is not the best solution, but data
show that non-first syllable o occurs mostly in U stems, irrespective of other vowels in
the stem: raboťij ‘worker’, kresto ‘cross’, ťemodanə ‘suitcase’, kilogrammə ‘kilogram’,
kilomətra ‘kilometer’, honu’o ‘plait, braid’ etc. Non-first syllable diphthongs are not
so rare as non-first syllable e or o, but I could find just one stem containing more than
one diphthong: mⁱaiðⁱa- ‘to be married, to have a husband’ (an I stem, as we expect).

However, it seemed that ə is not connected to any of the stem types: I found alto-
gether 49 mono- and polysyllabic U stems containing no other vowel but ə, while 38
such stems were I stems. My conclusion was that Nganasan U/I harmony is basically a
roundness harmony. I found two exceptions: the vowel a, although phonetically un-
rounded, occurred in U-stems almost without exceptions. Therefore I decided to take



127

it as a phonologically rounded vowel. So, in the following when I write “rounded
vowel”, the set also includes a and diphthong ua. The vowel ə was ambiguous, it did
not trigger either of the stem classes. All other unrounded vowels were connected
with I stems.

If we have a look at Table 2 again, we can see that after U stems we find vow-
els which occur mostly in U stems, while after I stems we find vowels which usually
occur in I stems. That is exactly what we are expecting when speaking about vowel
harmony. Nonetheless, we expect that it will work even with stems containing dif-
ferent vowels. I distinguished the following types of stems:

• U: containing exclusively rounded vowels (u, o, ü, a or diphthong ua);

• Ux: containing exclusively rounded vowels (u, o, ü, a or diphthong ua) and
neutral ə;

• I: containing exclusively unrounded vowels (i, e, ı or diphthong ⁱa);

• Ix: containing exclusively unrounded vowels (i, e, ı or diphthong ⁱa) and neutral
ə;

• UI: containing both rounded (u, o, ü, a or diphthong ua) and unrounded vowels
(i, e, ı or diphthong ⁱa), but not neutral ə;

• UIx: containing both rounded (u, o, ü, a or diphthong ua) and unrounded vowels
(i, e, ı or diphthong ⁱa) and also ə;

The results justified my supposition (Table 6).

U stems I stems
U 562 (96%) 24 (4%)

Ux 895 (90%) 94 (10%)
I 12 (5%) 230 (95%)

Ix 81 (16%) 417 (84%)
UI 276 (52%) 252 (48%)

UIx 213 (48%) 228 (52%)

Table 6: Correlations between the vowel skeleton and harmonic class of stems

These numbers show that if a stem contains exclusively rounded or exclusively
unrounded vowels, the stem type is highly predictable: just every twentieth bet will
be wrong. However, the presence of a neutral vowel will spoil our chances. If the stem



128

contains rounded and neutral vowels, every tenth bet will be wrong; if it contains
unrounded and neutral vowels, we loose every sixth bet. Nonetheless, even these
chances can be considered very good; it shows a high predictability of stem type based
on the vowels the stem contains. Moreover, when the stem contains both rounded and
unrounded (and possibly neutral) vowels, it seems to be completely unpredictable
whether the stem belongs to the U class or the I class.

If we look at the composition of the stems, we can see that 2315 stems (70%) are
(internally) harmonic (that is they belong to the U, Ux, I or Ix category), and just
969 stems (30%) are disharmonic. (The 87 stems containing just ə are ignored here.re.)
That shows that also inside stems, rounded vowels prefer to occur with other rounded
vowels and unrounded vowels with other unrounded vowels.

Bisyllabic words with both rounded and unrounded vowels showed that the stem
type is more closely related to the last than to the first syllable (Table 7, first two rows).

bisyllabic stems U stems I stems
{u, o, a, ü, ua} + {i, e, ı, ⁱa} 43 (31%) 94 (69%)
{i, e, ı, ⁱa} + {u, o, a, ü, ua} 66 (79%) 18 (21%)

{u, o, a, ü, ua} + ə 93 (87%) 14 (13%)
ə + {u, o, a, ü, ua} 70 (85%) 12 (15%)

{i, e, ı, ⁱa} + ə 13 (18%) 59 (82%)
ə + {i, e, ı, ⁱa} 12 (25%) 36 (75%)

Table 7: Harmonic classes of bisyllabic disharmonic stems

Although in polysyllabic words (words of three or more syllables) overall statistics
did not show any evident correlation with the first, penultimate or last syllable, it
became clear that the final syllables have a key role in deciding the stem type. If
we examine bisyllabic stems with a rounded vowel and a neutral vowel, we find no
striking difference between the penultimate and last position (Table 7, third and fourth
rows). However, whenwe find an unrounded and a neutral vowel in a bisyllabic word,
the penultimate syllable seems to be more relevant (Table 7, last two rows).

In polysyllabic disharmonic stems, when the final two vowels are both rounded
or both unrounded, the stem type is highly predictable. Nonetheless, if we find a
rounded and an unrounded vowel in the final two syllables, their order does not help
to predict the stem type (Table 8).

When we find a neutral and a round vowel in the last two syllables of a polysyl-
labic disharmonic stem, it helps to predict the stem type, especially when the rounded
vowel is in the last syllable. However, when we find a neutral and an unrounded
vowel in the last two syllables of a polysyllabic disharmonic stem, although it helps

two final syllables U stems I stems
{u, o, a, ü, ua} 91 (91%) 9 (9%)

{i, e, ı, ⁱa} 14 (16%) 71 (84%)

{i, e, ı, ⁱa} + {u, o, a, ü, ua} 72 (48%) 77 (52%)

Table 8: Harmonic classes of polysyllabic stems with harmonic and disharmonic
vowels in the last syllables

to predict the stem type, our prediction will be wrong more often than in the case of
rounded vowels. Moreover, the stem type is more predictable if the unrounded vowel
is in the penultimate syllable than when it is in the last one (Table 9).

two final syllables U stems I stems
{u, o, a, ü, ua} + ə 78 (66%) 41 (34%)
ə + {u, o, a, ü, ua} 21 (87%) 3 (13%)

{i, e, ı, ⁱa} + ə 24 (27%) 66 (73%)
ə + {i, e, ı, ⁱa} 35 (38%) 56 (62%)

Table 9: Harmonic classes of polysyllabic stems with a harmonic and a neutral
vowel in the last syllables

It seems that the roundedness of the vowels in the first part of the word counts
even when the last two vowels are neutral. The order of the rounded and unrounded
vowelsmakes a difference evenwhen the two last syllables are neutral. Note, however,
that the number of examples is very low here. Therefore, the reliability of statistics is
disputable (Table 10).

two neutral final syllables U stems I stems
{u, o, a, ü, ua} …+ ə + ə 125 (79%) 34 (21%)

{i, e, ı, ⁱa} …+ ə + ə 33 (35%) 61 (64%)
{u, o, a, ü, ua} + {i, e, ı, ⁱa} … + ə + ə 2 (20%) 8 (80%)
{i, e, ı, ⁱa} + {u, o, a, ü, ua} … + ə + ə 4 (57%) 3 (43%)

Table 10: Harmonic classes of polysyllabic stems with a rounded and a neutral vowel
in the last syllables

We can conclude that in Nganasan we have two harmonic classes of vowels and a



130

neutral vowel. The vowels in the stem play a great role in the decision which variant
of an alternating suffix will be attached to the stem: the variant which contains the
vowel belonging to the same harmonic class as the vowels of the stem. When the
stem contains vowels belonging to both classes, vowels closer to the suffix (i.e. closer
to the end of the stem) play a more significant role. In most of the cases the stem cat-
egory is well predictable, in other cases (when it contains exclusively neutral vowels
or vowels belonging to both harmonic classes) we can predict that the stem category
is unpredictable.

It is clear that Nganasan vowel harmony works in a very different way from
Finnish or Hungarian vowel harmony, or vowel harmony known from any other
Uralic (or Turkic) language.³ However, since the main principle of the examined phe-
nomenon is that the vowels of the suffix must belong to the same group as the vowels
of the stem, it must be considered a type of vowel harmony.

3 Vowel statistics based on a corpus
When I started to spread news on my findings, Beáta Wagner-Nagy suggested check-
ing my results against different sources on Nganasan, namely on the Nganasan Spo-
ken Language Corpus or NLSC (Brykina et al.). While the Nganasan Morphological
Analyzer was tested on a text collection of one fieldworker from one informant (
or NLSCLabanauskas 2001), NSLC contains texts collected by different fieldworkers,
from different informants at different times.

3.1 Method

I downloaded 54 xml files, each containing an annotated text. First, using a Perl script,
I removed xml tags and other irrelevant information. I got a file which contained dif-
ferent annotation tiers in different lines. With the help of another Perl script, I merged
every word in one line with its annotation. In the new files, every line contained a
word segmented to morphs, then a tab character followed by the meaning of the stem
in English and Russian, separated by a pipe (vertical line) from each other, and sepa-
rated by a hash mark form the morpheme tags following it. Annotation was followed
by a tab character and the reference number in parentheses. (Reference numbers
were kept to help debugging.) Consequently, the example above was converted to
the string presented in Figure 3.

The hashtag was necessary since sometimes the gloss for meaning also contained
a hyphen like in Figure 4.

³The analysis of these differences are out of scope of the current study.

Figure 3: Word form and analysis put in one line

Abamu-nu� Ust'-avam|Усть-Авам#-GEN.1PL

Figure 4: Hyphen in meaning

In some marginal cases, the glosses in Russian and in English were different or
the annotation was missing. I gave a feedback on these cases to the developers of the
corpus, and I ignored these instances. It was not a considerable loss, because most of
the ignored word forms did not contain any suffixes.

My next step was merging all the word forms occurring in the text into one text
file. In this file, word forms were presented similarly to the previous one, but refer-
ence numbers were omitted and the frequency of the form (e.g. the total number of
occurrences in the 54 texts) stood at the end of the line. Since our example word form
occurred only once, the line containing it will look like in Figure 5.

kontu-gu-mə take.away|увезти#-IMP-1SG.O 1

Figure 5: Word form and analysis with its frequency

In this file word forms were listed in a quasi-alphabetic order. It makes it easy to
notice that the same stems are sometimes glossed in a different way. For example,
above the line presented in Figure 5, we find the line presented in Figure 6

kontu-gu-mə carry|отнести#-IMP-1SG.O 1

Figure 6: Word form and analysis with its frequency

We can also find the stem kontu- glossed with the meaning ‘lead/отвести’ nearby.
We can also find the stem kondu-, most of the times glossed as ‘take.away/увезти’,
but as ‘kill/убить’, too. This is important because the next step was the identification
of the stems. Every stem allomorph with a given meaning was considered to be a
separate stem. Therefore, although both kontu- and kondu- in all of their meanings
belong to the same verb, they counted as five different stems (see Figure 7; numbers
at the end of the lines indicate the number of word forms in which the given stem
allomorph occurs with the given meaning – it is ignored how many times the given
word forms occur).

This is important because thismethod inavoidablymodifies the results of statistics.

kondu ‘kill|убить’ 3
kondu ‘take.away|увезти’ 7
kontu ‘carry|отнести’ 1
kontu ‘lead|отвести’ 1
kontu ‘take.away|увезти’ 22

Figure 7: Word form and analysis with its frequency

However, the probability that a stem which proves our expectations will be overrep-
resented is the same that a stem which contradicts our hypothesis will be overrep-
resented. Therefore, we can hope this result will reflect roughly the same as a more
precise approach, namely, if we tried to associate all the allomorphs of a lexeme with
all glossed meanings to a single stem.

To get the stems organized as presented above, I used another Perl script. This
segmented the word forms and made two files: the list of stems (as presented above)
and a list of suffixes (as presented in Figure 8).

From this file, I generated another list in which allomorphs are ordered according
to their functions (Figure 9).⁴

The next step was to define which morphs undergo vowel harmony and which
harmonic class they belong to. Since Nganasan morphophonology is very complex,
I categorized allomorphs manually. Allomorphs containing no vowels undergoing
harmony (such as [1SG.O] or [IMP] ŋəə) were simply left out of the list. Only those
allomorphs were taken as undergoing harmony which had at least one pair belonging
to the other harmonic class. For example, -gu-, -gü-, -ku- and -kü- undergo palatal
harmony, and according to the literature (e.g. Helimski 1998, 493, Várnai 2002, 57–59)
this happens only when it also undergoes rounding harmony. However, (despite the
relatively high number of the above mentioned allomorphs, especially with u), none
of the allomorphs -gı-, -gi-, -kı- or -ki- were attested, I took -gu-, -gü-, -ku- and -kü-
as allomorphs not undergoing rounding harmony. Because of the same reason, -ŋəi-
was also taken as a suffix not undergoing vowel harmony. However, other allomorphs
beginning with ŋ were regarded as belonging to one or other harmonic class (see
Figure 10).⁵

⁴The Nganasan Spoken Language Corpus uses the character ɨ to indicate velar illabial high vowel. For
technical reasons, these are substituted by ï in the presented codes. For the same reason, Ɂ is replaced by
? and ’ is replaced by a vertical straight apostrophe.

⁵In fact, not all these allomorphs are the allomorphs of the same morpheme. The allomorphs begin-
ning with k or g are always used in first person forms, therefore a tag something like [1IMP] or [IMP1]
would be more appropriate for them. The allomorph -ŋəə- is used for third persons in the subjective and

Figure 8: List of suffixes (segments)

Allomorphs tagged in a slightly different way but clearly belonging to the same
morpheme were also included in the list (see Figure 11).

Allomorphs clearly belonging together but containing different zero allomorphs
were also taken into account, see Figure 12.

Allomorphs undergoing alternation but containing vowels belonging to different
harmonic classes were indicatedwith an exclamationmark (see Figure 13). Later these
allomorphs were not taken into account, but they were collected to another list for
further studies. They may be a result of an annotation mistake, a slip of the tongue,
signs of disintegration of vowel harmony (maybe not independently of language loss)
etc.

objective conjugation, -ŋəi- occurs in third person reflexive conjugation: these are two distinct morphemes
again. The allomorphs -ŋu- and -ŋü- are used in second person subjective and objective conjugation, -ŋa-
in second person reflexive conjugation, while -ŋi- and -ŋı- occur in second person forms of all the three
conjugations: two additional morphemes with some overlapping allomorphs again. So we have to speak
about six different morphemes, tagged in different ways (c.f. Helimski 1998, 505, Wagner-Nagy 2002a, 110).
Nonetheless, this problem does not influence my statistics.

Figure 13: List of suffixes with their harmony class tagged and a non-categorizable
allomorph among them

Based on this definition of harmonic classes of suffixes, all the suffixes were re-
placed by their harmonic classes in our file. E.g. our example in Figure 5 was first
reassigned into a form presented in the first line of Figure 14 and then the suffixes
were changed into their harmonic classes, as it is presented in the second line. NB,
although at first sight -gu- may seem to belong to the U harmonic class, it is neutral
(see above). However, the form presented in the third line contains two harmonic
suffixes, therefore it is changed into the form presented in the fourth line of the same
figure.

Figure 14: Annotations realigned to the morphs they belong to and changed to their
harmonic classes

Interestingly, I have found about 200 word forms in which I could identify suffixes
belonging to both of the harmonic classes, e.g. see Figure 15. In this case, my classifi-
cation contradicts the literature (e.g. Wagner-Nagy 2002a, 78), according to which the
plural lative suffix always contains i, therefore it is not a harmonic suffix. However, I
took it as an alternating suffix because I could find forms -tü- and -ntü- as in the word
forms shown in Figure 16.

Figure 15: Stem with two suffixes belonging to different harmonic classes

It is worth noting that theword formmeaning ‘to his tents’ has two different forms
here: matitü and matütu and the suffix is never attested with vowels ı or u. A similar
case is attested with the coaffix of perfect verbs, which should also contain i all the

time ( Wagner-Nagy 2002a, 101). But it also occurs with a, ü and ı and several kinds
of diphthongs (see below) in the annotated corpus.

In any case, I ignored word forms with suffixes (seemingly) belonging to different
harmonic classes and used just the forms in which all the suffixes belonged to the
same harmonic class (or were neutral).

3.2 Results

I made two kinds of statistics on these forms. The first shows the composition (vowel
skeleton) of the stems before the suffixes of the two harmonic classes. I used har-
monic categories based on the previous study. However, the corpus contained two
diphthongs, unknown by the literature ( Helimski 1998, 483, Várnai 2002, 33) and not
used by the morphological analyzer: ıa and üa (for pattern matching, substituted by
į and ű, respectively). As a hypothesis, I treated ıa as unrounded (as ⁱa is) and üa as
rounded (as ua is). The distribution shown by the statistics is presented in Table 11.

U class I class
U 395 (87%) 59 (13%)

Ux 305 (78%) 85 (22%)
I 26 (11%) 205 (89%)

Ix 52 (25%) 153 (75%)
UI 148 (51%) 142 (49%)

UIx 42 (49%) 44 (51%)
only ə 39 (59%) 27 (41%)

Table 11: Number of stems with a given vowels skeleton type before suffixes
belonging to different harmonic classes

The results show again that harmonizing suffixes with rounded vowels tend to
occur after stems with rounded vowels and harmonizing suffixes with unrounded
vowels tend to occur after stems with unrounded vowels. The presence of a neutral
vowel weakens this tendency. After stems containing vowels belonging to both or
none of the harmonic classes the harmonic class of the suffix is unpredictable.



137

To check whether the categorization of each vowel is proper, I also made statistics
for the separate vowels. I counted how many times they occur in stems suffixed by
the rounded and unrounded variants of harmonizing suffixes. (If the same vowel
occurs twice or three times in the same stem, it is counted as two or three occurrences,
respectively.)

U class I class
u 360 (73%) 135 (27%)
o 204 (76%) 64 (24%)
a 570 (80%) 135 (20%)
ü 314 (82%) 71 (18%)
ua 53 (91%) 5 (9%)
üa 6 (86%) 1 (14%)
i 218 (33%) 417 (67%)
e 42 (24%) 135 (76%)
ı 44 (17%) 222 (83%)
ⁱa 28 (35%) 51 (65%)
ıa – 2 (100%)
ə 540 (58%) 383 (42%)

Table 12: Number of different vowels before suffixes belonging to different harmonic
classes

The data presented in Table 12 show that at least two thirds of any vowel occurs
in stems before a suffix belonging to the same harmonic class as I classified them.
Although neutral ə also occurs more times before U class suffixes, the range here
is considerably lower than the lowest value for vowels classified as belonging to a
harmonic class (seven twelfth instead of eight).

3.3 Some problems

There were almost 250 stems which occurred with suffixes belonging to both of the
harmonic classes. In the statistics above, they were presented as two different stems
belonging to different harmonic classes. E.g. the word basa ‘iron, money’ was tagged
as an U stem in the morphonological analyzer. In the corpus, in most of the cases it
is followed by suffixes belonging to the U class (or neutral), but in some cases it is
followed by the I class variant of the destinitive suffix (Figure 17).

However, similarly to the case of the plural lative suffix and the perfect coaffix
seen above, the destinitive suffix is attested only with vowels i, ü and ı, therefore it is



138

basa-ði-n'i? iron|железо#-DST-ACC.PL.1PL
basa[iron|железо]-I-I
basa-ði-n'ü? money|деньги#-DST-ACC.PL.1PL
basa[money|деньги]-I-U
basa-ði-t'ü iron|железо#-DST-ACC.PL.3SG
basa[iron|железо]-I-U

Figure 17: Suffixed forms of basa ‘iron, money’

disputable whether it is a harmonizing suffix. Moreover, the (nominative-accusative-
genitive) plural form with a first person plural possessor (PL1.PL) also occurs with
vowels i and ü only. If we removed all these suffixes from the list of the harmonizing
suffixes, rounding harmony would seem more regular.

Nonetheless, there are cases which are more complicated. Sometimes we find
suffixes of different harmonic classes a certain stem, see Figure 18.

ŋad'a-ðï younger.sibling|младший.брат/сестра#-NOM.SG.3SG

Figure 18: The same form with suffixes belonging to different harmonic classes

In this case, the suffix occurs with all the four harmonizing vowels and I have
found no explanation for the lack of vowel harmony in the second case. All such
cases need a detailed analysis.

Moreover, to evaluate the results, it will be necessary to check the distribution of
seemingly irregular forms among the different informants. If we find that many of
these forms come from a smaller group of informants, we have to suggest that they
are further on the way of language loss (cf. Helimski 1998, 493) and therefore data
from them are not reliable for researching Nganasan vowel harmony in its intact form.
However, data from these people are a useful source for the research of language loss.

4 Conclusion
Contrary to what we find in the literature on Nganasan morphophonology, Nganasan
U/I vowel harmony proved to be quite well predictable by a statistical analysis of
Nganasan data. It is basically a rounding harmony, although phonetically unrounded
a belongs to rounded vowels and ə does not belong to either of the classes. The two
very different digital sources of Nganasan show basically the same tendency: stems

containing rounded vowels tend to be suffixed with harmonizing suffixes containing
rounded vowels and stems containing unrounded vowels tend to be suffixed with
harmonizing suffixes containing unrounded vowels.
