Abstract

While deep learning techniques have shown
promising results in many natural language
processing (NLP) tasks, it has not been widely
applied to the clinical domain. The lack
of large datasets and the pervasive use of
domain-specific language (i.e. abbreviations
and acronyms) in the clinical domain causes
slower progress in NLP tasks than that of the
general NLP tasks. To fill this gap, we employ
word/subword-level based models that adopt
large-scale data-driven methods such as pre-
trained language models and transfer learning
in analyzing text for the clinical domain. Em-
pirical results demonstrate the superiority of
the proposed methods by achieving 90.6% ac-
curacy in medical domain natural language in-
ference task. Furthermore, we inspect the inde-
pendent strengths of the proposed approaches
in quantitative and qualitative manners. This
analysis will help researchers to select neces-
sary components in building models for the
medical domain.

1 Introduction

Natural language processing (NLP) has broadened
its applications rapidly in recent years such as
question answering, neural machine translation,
natural language inference, and other language-
related tasks. Unlike other tasks in NLP area, the
lack of large labeled datasets and restricted access
in the clinical domain have discouraged active par-
ticipation of NLP researchers for this domain (Ro-
manov and Shivade, 2018). Furthermore, the per-
vasive use of abbreviations and acronyms in the
clinical domain causes the difficulty of text nor-
malization and makes the related tasks more diffi-
cult (Pakhomov, 2002).

In building NLP models, a word embedding
layer that transforms a sequence of tokens in text
into a vector representation is considered as one

of the fundamental components. In recent stud-
ies, it has been shown that the pre-trained lan-
guage models by using a huge diversity of corpus
(i.e. BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) and ELMo (Peters
et al., 2018)) generate deep contextualized word
representations. These methods have shown to be
very effective for improving the performance of a
wide range of NLP tasks by enabling better text
understanding and have become a crucial part of
the tasks since they have published.

To stimulate the research in the clinical domain,
researchers have further investigated to transform
the pre-trained language models from general pur-
pose version into the medical domain-specific ver-
sion. Lee et al. (2019) propose BioBERT that uti-
lizes large-scale bio-medical corpora, PubMed ab-
stracts (PubMed) and PubMed Central full-text ar-
ticles (PMC), to obtain a medical domain spe-
cific language representation through fine-tuning
the BERT. Similarity, a PubMed-ELMo1, trained
with medical domain corpus, is released as one
of the contributed ELMo models for medical do-
main researchers. However, these models are not
yet fully explored in medical domain tasks.

Besides these general efforts in building bet-
ter word representations, Romanov and Shivade
(2018) introduce a large and publicly available
natural language inference (NLI) dataset, called
MedNLI, for the medical domain (see table 1).
Considering the expensive annotation cost of med-
ical text due to the sparsity of the clinical-domain
experts, the medical NLI task plays an import role
in boosting existing datasets for medical ques-
tion answering systems by retrieving similar ques-
tions that are already answered by human ex-
perts. Along with this effort, ACL-BioNLP 2019
committee announced a shared task, NLI for the
medical domain, motivated by a need to develop

relevant methods, techniques and gold standards
for inference and entailment (Ben Abacha et al.,
2019). The newly released dataset is larger in size
than that of any other previous medical domain
NLI dataset, however, it is still not enough to train
complicated neural network based models.

To fill this gap, we propose a combination
approach of NLP models and machine learning
methods to tackle the medical domain NLI task.
Our contributions are summarized as follows:

• We adopt the pre-trained language models
(BioBERT, PubMed-ELMo) to overcome the
shortage of training data which is a common
problem in the clinical domain.

• We apply the transfer learning method with
two general domain NLI datasets and show
that a source task in a domain can benefit
learning a target task in a different domain.

• We show the independent strengths of the
proposed approaches in quantitative and
qualitative manners. This analysis will help
researchers to select necessary components in
building models for the clinical domain.

2 Related Work

Researchers have investigated NLI tasks. Most of
the works employed a recurrent neural network
to encode each pair of sentences and to compute
the similarity between them (Conneau et al., 2017;
Subramanian et al., 2018). Recently, Liu et al.
(2019) proposed multi-task learning for natural
language tasks and achieved the best results on
NLI tasks. In the medical domain, Romanov and
Shivade (2018) adopted the ESIM (Chen et al.,
2017) model to the MedNLI task. The ESIM

model employs two bidirectional LSTM to en-
code each sentence independently and to calculate
a matching score between the sentences by using
alignment and pooling methods. They also applied
transfer learning with SNLI (Bowman et al., 2015)
and MNLI (Williams et al., 2018) datasets to im-
prove model performance in the MedNLI task.

Recently, pre-trained language models were
proposed (Peters et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2018).
The multi-task benchmark for natural language
understanding (Wang et al., 2018) has shown that
these pre-trained language models brought addi-
tional performance gain by providing deep contex-
tualized word representations. Upon this success,
researchers further extended previous pre-trained
language models to medical domain-specific ver-
sions such as BioBERT (Lee et al., 2019) and
PubMed-ELMo (Peters, 2018).

However, none of these researches directly ap-
plied the pre-trained language models of the med-
ical domain to the MedNLI task.

3 Dataset and Problem

MedNLI (Romanov and Shivade, 2018), a large
publicly available and expert annotated dataset,
has been recently published for the MEDIQA
2019 shared task. This dataset comprises of tu-
ples<P,H, Y >where: P and H are a clinical sen-
tence pair, (premise and hypothesis, respectively);
Y indicates whether a given hypothesis can be in-
ferred from a given premise. In particular, Y is
categorized as one of three classes: “entailment”,
“contradiction”, and “neutral”. Table 1 shows ex-
amples of the MedNLI dataset. A total of 14,049
pairs, (11,232, 1,395, 1,422 for training, devel-
opment, and test, respectively), are created based
on the past medical history section of MIMIC-

In this research, we are interested in building a

model that classifies the given sentence pair into
the corresponding category. First, we consider a
point-wise approach that classifies each pair of
data independently into one of the three classes.
Next, we re-organize the dataset into the set of a
list that contains one of each class sentence pair.
Then we apply list-wise classification that clas-
sifies three sentence pair into each “entailment”,
“contradiction”, and “neutral” class exclusively.

4 Methods

As the size of the MedNLI dataset is limited to
train the whole weight parameters in complicated
neural network based models, we first choose a
BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) based model that pro-
vides pre-trained model parameters from a large
corpus. To further explore the performance of
modern neural network based models, we extend
the compare aggregate model (Wang and Jiang,
2016) with another type of pre-trained word-level
embedding, ELMo (Peters et al., 2018). Addition-
ally, we apply transfer learning from similar NLI
tasks (Bowman et al., 2015; Williams et al., 2018),
and we try to expand medical abbreviations to deal
with the general problem in the medical domain.

4.1 BioBERT

As a baseline model, we choose BioBERT (Lee
et al., 2019) since MedNLI is a bio-domain spe-
cific NLI task. It shows strength in understanding
medical domain text as it is fine-tuned with bio-
datasets such as PubMed and PMC. The BioBERT
adopts the same architecture as BERT, as shown in
figure 1, that takes WordPiece embeddings from
textual input and generates a language represen-
tation using a transformer model (Vaswani et al.,

2017).

WordPiece embedding: BioBERT utilizes the
WordPiece dictionary of BERT generated from
general domain corpus. Each premise P and
hypothesis H turn into sub-word embeddings,
EP ∈Rn×de and EH ∈Rm×de , using the dictio-
nary where de is a dimension of sub-word embed-
ding vectors and n and m are the length of the
sequences of P and H, respectively.

EP = WordPiece embedding(P),

EH = WordPiece embedding(H).
(1)

BioBERT adds the special classification embed-
ding “[CLS]” as the first token of every sen-
tence and separates EP and EH with a special to-
ken “[SEP]”. The final input representation fed to
transformer blocks is the sum of the token embed-
dings (ET ), position embeddings (EPo), and seg-
mentation embeddings (ES) as follow.

E = ET + EPo + ES ,

ET = [E[CLS], EP , E[SEP ], EH ].
(2)

Transformer encoder: The transformer en-
coder consists of multiple transformer blocks.
Each block uses Multi-Head Attention (MHA)
generating h different attentions. All the at-
tention heads calculated with different weights
are concatenated. A linear layer with a weight
matrix WH∈R(h×dv)×de computes the MHA
(Rinput length×de) with the concatenated attention
heads as follows:

MHA(Q, K, V) = (concat{hd1, .., hdn})WH ,
hdi = attn(Qi, Ki, Vi),

attn(Qi, Ki, Vi) = softmax(
QiKTi√

)Vi,

4.2 Compare Aggregate (CompAggr)

As we focus on the task that classifies the rela-
tionship between two sentences P and H (premise
and hypothesis) into one of three classes (entail-
ment, contradiction, or neutral), we adopt the com-
pare aggregate (CompAggr) model that is widely
used for a text sequence matching task (Wang

and Jiang, 2016). In addition to the CompAggr
model, we adopt PubMed-ELMo, that is trained
with medical domain corpus and released as one
of contributed ELMo models (Peters et al., 2018;
Peters, 2018), to alleviate the lack of training cor-
pus for the shared task. The final model consists of
four parts which are shown in figure 2.
Word representation: Premise P∈Rd×n and hy-
pothesis H∈Rd×m, (where d is a dimensionality
of word embedding and n, m are length of the se-
quences in P and H, receptively), are processed to
capture contextual information within the sentence
by using pretrained PubMed ELMo (Peters et al.,
2018) as follows:

EP = PubMed-ELMo(P),

EH = PubMed-ELMo(H).
(4)

Attention: The soft aliment of the EP and EH
are computed by applying an attention mechanism
over the column vector in EP for each column vec-
tor in EH . Using an attention weight αi for each
column vector in EP , we obtain a corresponding
vector AP ∈Rd×m from weighted sum of the col-
umn vectors of EP .

AP = EP · softmax((WEP )ᵀEH), (5)

where W is a learned model parameter matrix.
Comparison: We use an element-wise multipli-
cation as a comparison function to combine each
pair of AP and EH into a vector C∈Rd×m.
Aggregation: Finally Kim (2014)’s CNN with n-
types of filters is applied to aggregate all the infor-
mation followed by another fully connected layer

to classify the P and H pair as follow:

R = CNN(C), (R∈Rnd)
ŷc = softmax((R)ᵀ W + b ),

(6)

where ŷc is the predicted probability distribution
for the target classes and the W∈Rnd×3 and bias
b are learned model parameters.

Our loss function is cross-entropy between pre-
dicted labels and true-labels as follow:

L = − log
N∏
i=1

C∑
c=1

yi,clog(ŷi,c), (7)

where yi,c is the true label vector, and ŷi,c is the
predicted probability from the softmax layer. C is
the total number of classes (entailment, contradic-
tion, and neutral for this task), and N is the total
number of samples used in training.

4.3 Transfer learning
Pan and Yang (2010) provide definitions of trans-
fer learning as follows:

Definition 1 (Transfer Learning) Given a source
domain DS and learning task TS , a target domain
DT and learning task TT , transfer learning aims to
help improve the learning of the target predictive
function fT (·) in DT using the knowledge in DS
and TS , where Ds 6= DT , or TS 6= TT .

While MedNLI has a relatively large amount
of training data in the clinical domain, NLI tasks
in general domain such as SNLI (Bowman et al.,
2015) and MNLI (Williams et al., 2018) have way
larger training data than MedNLI has. Since a
source and a target task in different domains can
improve a model performance if they are related
to each other we decide to use the two general do-
main NLI tasks to train BERT and BioBERT to
transfer their knowledge for MedNLI. Our case is
DS 6= DT where the feature spaces between the
domains are different or the marginal probability
distributions between domain datasets are differ-
ent (P (XS) 6= P (XT )).

4.4 Abbreviation expansion
Not unlike other medical text, abbreviations and
acronyms are easily found throughout the text in
MedNLI as table 1 shows from # 4 to 6. In or-
der to understand the effect of expanded forms
for clinical abbreviations, we replace the abbre-
viations with corresponding expanded forms. As
Liu et al. (2015) mentions that no universal rules

we gather and exploit the public medical abbrevi-
ations from Taber’s Online2.

5 Experiments

We explore three kinds of BioBERT that are
fine-tuned from the original BERT with PMC,
PubMed, and PMC+PubMed datasets. As shown
in table 2, BioBERT trained on PubMed+PMC
performs the best. Thus we select it as a base
BioBERT model for the rest of the experiments.
Depends on a need for comparison or better un-
derstanding, we also include original BERT in the
experiments and report the results. The overall re-
sults of MedNLI are shown in table 3.

5.1 Experimental Setup

All experiments based on BioBERT and BERT
have a fixed learning rate 2e-5. We add early stop-
ping to stop the models from learning if evaluation
loss has not decreased for 4 steps where 1 step is
defined 20% of the whole training data. Other than
the learning rate and early stopping, all settings are
the same as they are in BioBERT and BERT.

For the CompAggr model, we use a context pro-
jection weight matrix with 100 dimensions. In the
aggregation part, we use 1-D CNN with a total
of 500 filters, which involved five types of fil-
tersK ∈R{1,2,3,4,5}×100, 100 per type. The weight
matrices for the filters were initialized using the
Xavier method (Glorot and Bengio, 2010). We use
the Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014) in-
cluding gradient clipping by norm at a threshold
of 5. For the purpose of regularization, we applied
dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014) with a ratio of 0.7.

5.2 Performance evaluation

Transfer learning: We conduct transfer learn-
ing on four different combinations of MedNLI,
SNLI, and MNLI as it shown in the table 4 (line
4 to 7) and also add the results of general domain
tasks (MNLI, SNLI) for comparison. As expected,
BERT performs better on tasks in the general do-
main while BioBERT performs better on MedNLI
which is in the clinical domain.

In overall, positive transfer occurs on MedNLI.
There are three things we can observe from the re-
sults. First of all, even though BioBERT is fine-
tuned on general domain tasks before MedNLI,
transfer learning shows better results than that
fine-tuned on MedNLI directly. It implies that the
same tasks in different domains have overlapping
knowledge and transfer learning between the tasks
effects positively on each other as the definition
of transfer learning mentions in section 4. Sec-
ond, the domain specific language representations
from BioBERT are maintained while fine-tuning
on general domain tasks by showing that the trans-
fer learning results of MedNLI on BioBERT have
better performance than the results on BERT (line
4 to 7). Lastly, the accuracy of MNLI and SNLI
on BioBERT is lower than the accuracy on BERT.
The lower accuracy indicates that BioBERT cap-
tures different features such as medical terms and
generate different representations than what BERT
does which are helpful for the clinical domain
task, MedNLI, but not for the other two tasks.

The best combination is SNLI → MNLI →
MedNLI on BioBERT. We refer to the best result
of transfer learning as BioBERT (transferred).

Results analysis for different models: There are
fundamental differences between the two models
we apply. BioBERT tokenizes an input sentence

to sub-word level and uses the transformer model
while CompAggr uses word-level embeddings and
Compare&Aggregate model. In light of the dis-
similar nature, we expect each model captures dif-
ferent features and generates different language
representations.

Figure 3 shows the percentage for each area
takes of the test set. CompAggr correctly classifies
97 examples (7% of the test set) which BioBERT
classifies them incorrectly while BioBERT clas-
sifies 188 examples correctly (13% of the test
set) which CompAggr does not. It demonstrates
that both models have different strength on the
MedNLI task.

We manually examine all promise and hypoth-
esis pairs of each portion of 7% and 13% of the
test set with high confidence and “element” label.
For CompAggr, we pick pairs with the probability
higher than 0.80 which are 6 pairs. For BioBERT,
we select pairs with top 10 probabilities. Interest-
ingly, each pair from CompAggr does not have
overlapping words between premise and hypoth-
esis. It appears that CompAggr’s strength is in
it’s ability to capture the relationship between two
sentences even though there is no word overlap
while BioBERT labels them “neutral” except one

pair as you can see in table 5. In contrast, the ma-
jority of the pairs, 7 out of 10, from BioBERT have
overlapping words between them. Biobert shows
strong confidence when premise and hypothesis
have overlapping words as below.

• (Premise) En route to the Emergency De-
partment, she developed worsening subster-
nal chest pain without any radiation.

• (Hypothesis) patient has chest pain

Lastly, we compute the average conditional
probability of the correct results to check the con-
fidence of each model. The results are 0.87 and
0.82 for BioBERT and CompAggr showing that
BioBERT predicts labels with higher confidence.

Abbreviation expansion: We refer to the
dataset of MedNLI with abbreviation expansion
as MedNLI (expanded). The inconsistency of the
experiment results on MedNLI (expanded) makes
it difficult to observe their effects. MedNLI (ex-
panded) shows better performance than MedNLI
on BioBERT while MedNLI works better on
BERT (see table 4). Furthermore, the performance
of MedNLI (expanded) with transfer learning is
higher on BERT and lower on BioBERT than the
performance of MedNLI with transfer learning.

We examine the test results to figure out the
inconsistency and observe an interesting phe-
nomenon that the abbreviation expansion changes
the conditional probability distribution P(Y|X),
where X and Y represent input texts and their ex-
pected labels, respectively. The same input texts
with no expansion are classified into different

pothesis like below is not changed after abbrevia-
tion expansion since it does not contain any abbre-
viations or acronyms.

However, the results are different. It is originally
classified into “neutral” which is the right label for
the pair but it is classified into “entailment” when
we use MedNLI (expanded).

5.3 MEDIQA-NLI shared task

We are participating in a shared task MEDIQA-
NLI of the bioNLP workshop at ACL 2019. In or-
der to solve the task, we try four different point-
wise approaches, CompAggr, BioBERT, transfer
learning, and abbreviation expansion. We run each
model several times to obtain the best result out
of each. Our best result, which is ranked 5th on
the leaderboard of the task, is obtained by ap-
plying list-wise approach (in section 3) with the
best result (BioBERT (transferred)). Table 6 shows
the model performance of each participant in the
leaderboard.

6 Conclusion

In this paper, we study natural language inference
in the clinical domain where training corpora is
insufficient due to its domain nature. To tackle the
problem, we propose approaches that adopts pre-
trained language models, transfer learning method
and data-augmentation to boost the train instances.
To this end, we observe that the BioBERT pre-
trained on bio-medical corpus shows better perfor-
mance than that of the BERT on the general do-
main corpus. The CompAggr with bio-ELMO and
the BioBERT behave differently in classifying the
MedNLI dataset due to the difference in their own
architecture. Transfer learning with NLI tasks in
general domain, (MNLI, SNLI), does not hurt the
ability of the BioBERT capturing language repre-
sentations of the clinical domain. In addition, we



413

observe that it transfers positive knowledge from
general NLI tasks to the MedNLI task. In contrast,
a abbreviation expansion method needs particular
care when adopting since it may hurt the model to
predict the conditional probability distribution of
the task.
