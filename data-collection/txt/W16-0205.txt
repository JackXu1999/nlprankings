Abstract 

Given multiple corrupted versions of the same 

text, as is common with ancient manuscripts, 

we wish to reconstruct the original text from 

which the extant corrupted versions were cop-

ied (typically via latent intermediary ver-

sions). This is a challenge of cardinal im-

portance in the humanities. We use a variant 

of expectation-maximization (EM), to solve 

this problem. We prove the efficacy of our 

method on both synthetic and real-world data. 

1 Introduction 

In ancient times, original documents were written 

by hand and then copied by scribes. Some societies 

transmitted traditions orally, which were written 

down and copied at some later date. These copies 

were inevitably inexact, each scribe introducing 

some errors into the text. These flawed copies 

spread around the world where they were then 

themselves imperfectly copied. Some small subset 

of these repeatedly corrupted documents survived 

until modern times.  

One of the main tasks of the study of such an-

cient manuscripts is to reconstruct the original 

document (the “ur-text”) from the corrupted manu-

scripts that are available. This has traditionally 

been done using painstaking manual methods. In 

this paper, we show this reconstruction can be au-

tomated using a variant of the expectation-

maximization (EM) algorithm (Dempster et al 

1977). 

The structure of the paper is as follows. In the 

next section, we consider previous work on the ur-

text problem (mostly dealing with a different ver-

sion of the problem). In Section 3, we define the 

synoptic form in which we assume the texts are 

presented. In Sections 4 and 5, we formalize the 

problem and present our solution. In the three sub-

sequent sections, we consider synthetic, artificial 

and real-world testbeds, respectively. 

2 Previous Work 

The reconstruction of ur-texts from corrupted 

manuscripts using manual methods has a long his-

tory (Maas 1958, West 1973). Such methods can 

be divided roughly into methods designed to select 

a single best manuscript (a “diplomatic” text) from 

among the extant ones (Bedier 1928) and methods 

designed to create an optimal hybrid (an “eclectic” 

text) out of the extant manuscripts (Lachmann 

1853, Timpanaro 2005).  

From a computational point of view, it is clear 

that the Bedierian approach is preferable when the 

collection of extant manuscripts for a given text is 

relatively complete (in the sense that the earlier 

manuscripts from which later manuscripts were 

copied are also included in the collection), espe-

cially if the ur-text itself might be found in the col-

lection. In these cases, the main challenge is to re-

40



 

 

 

 

construct the stemma, the tree that records which 

manuscript was copied from which. The root of the 

reconstructed stemma is hypothesized to be the ur-

text.  

This challenge is common with bio-informatics 

(Pupko et al. 2000, Yang 2007) and researchers 

have applied methods of bio-informatics to the re-

construction of document stemmata (Robinson and 

O’Hara 1996, Robinson et al. 1998, Roos and 

Heikkila 2009, Roelli and Bachmann 2010, An-

drews and Mace 2013). 

Hoenen (2015) considers the problem of auto-

mated ur-text reconstruction for cases in which the 

manuscript collection is relatively complete and 

compares several methods of post-processing re-

constructed stemmata to obtain (possibly eclectic) 

hypothesized ur-texts. 

In the case of ancient documents, which we con-

sider in this paper, the situation in which a collec-

tion is relatively complete – and might even in-

clude the ur-text – is exceedingly rare. Typically, 

the available manuscripts might be identifiable as 

(near or distant) cousins, but will be too sparse to 

permit even partial stemma reconstruction. Thus, 

we will develop an entirely new approach that does 

not focus on stemma reconstruction, as previous 

work did. 

Our approach involves three stages. First, all the 

manuscripts for a given text must be arranged so 

that parallel words or phrases are aligned in col-

umns (“synoptic form”). Second, when possible, 

related manuscripts should be clustered together. 

Finally, the ur-text can be inferred from the 

aligned, clustered texts by using statistical methods 

to make the optimal choice in each column of the 

synoptic text. 

3 Creating a Synopsis 

Consider the simple synopsis shown in Figure 1.  

 

United  States  on the 4th of July 

USA  on  Fourth of July 

United States in the end of June 

 
Figure 1: A fragment of a synoptic text. 

 

As is evident even in this simple example, there 

are a number of subtleties involved in creating 

such synopses. First, phrases (or any sequence of 

words that are inter-dependent) should ideally be 

in a single column, so that columns are as inde-

pendent of each other as possible. For example, the 

phrase “United States” (and the acronym “USA”) 

should be in a single column. (As in this example, 

typical available synopses are not ideal in this 

sense.) Second, words that differ only in trivial 

orthographic ways that are not important to us 

ought to be conflated. For example, we might 

choose not to distinguish between “4
th
” and 

“Fourth”. Finally, distinct words that play the same 

role in the text (fourth/end; June/July) should be 

aligned, though often this is a matter of judgment. 

One important limitation of such synopses is 

their monotonicity: the words in each row are laid 

out in the order they are found in the correspond-

ing manuscript. Thus, if some manuscript inverts 

the order of two strings of text, one of those strings 

will not correspond to its parallels in other rows. 

There have been efforts to automate the process 

of creating synopses from raw text. One approach 

adapts alignment methods developed in bio-

informatics for aligning strings of DNA (Notre-

dame et al. 2002). However, since the “words” 

aligned in bio-informatics are chosen from a small 

alphabet, whereas the words in texts are chosen 

from a large lexicon, such adaptation is not 

straightforward. There also are alignment methods 

designed specifically for text alignment (Robinson 

1989, Spencer and Howe 2004, Dekker et al. 

2014), as well as methods for aligning parallel 

texts in multiple languages (Och and Ney 2003).  

Existing methods for text alignment are ade-

quate for our purposes. As it happens, for the 

testbeds considered in this paper, manual synopses 

were available, allowing us to focus on the more 

basic issue of ur-text reconstruction. 

4 Formalizing the Problem 

Suppose now that we have a synopsis of n man-

uscripts each of which makes some choice with 

regard to each of m words (tokens) each appearing 

in a different column. We can think of our synopsis 

as an m*n matrix a = {aij}, where aij is the word 

(form) in the j
th
 column according to the i

th
 manu-

script. (Some of these words might be blanks, 

which we treat exactly like any other token.) Given 

such a synopsis, we wish to choose the most prob-

41



 

 

 

 

able choice in each column. The resulting sequence 

of words is the proposed ur-text.  

How can we determine the most probable 

choice in each column? A straightforward baseline 

solution is to use simple majority rule (SMR): for 

each column, choose the token found most fre-

quently in that column. Under certain trivial condi-

tions, Condorcet’s Jury Theorem guarantees that 

this method’s accuracy approaches 1 as the number 

of manuscripts grows. 

In real-life, however, the number of manu-

scripts available is usually quite limited. We will 

introduce a method that yields considerably 

stronger results than SMR for the kinds of situa-

tions encountered in the real world. 

We will assume that each manuscript i has 

some reliability level, pi. This means that for any 

given token, manuscript i has probability pi of 

choosing the right token (that is, using the same 

form that is being transcribed). Of course, the val-

ue pi is not known to us. Our objective will be to 

show how to simultaneously find the most likely 

reliability levels of the respective manuscripts and 

the most likely ur-text.  

Our initial generative model is as follows: a 

single ur-text of length m is copied by each of n 

scribes. For any token j{1,…,m}, there is proba-

bility pi that the scribe of manuscript i{1,…,n} 

will transcribe the token correctly. If he fails to 

transcribe a token correctly, there are kj equiproba-

ble potential distinct forms other than the original. 

(Note that the number of potential forms might be 

different for different tokens.) One limitation of 

this generative model is that we assume, perhaps 

unrealistically, that for any given scribe the proba-

bility of an error is the same for every word.  

We do not assume that for all i, pi >.5. Rather, 

for the binary case (kj=1), we assume only the al-

most trivial condition that pi >(1-pi); for non-
binary cases, the necessary condition is even 

weaker. Note that for the binary case, the necessary 

condition is weaker in the limit than the necessary 

condition for Condorcet’s Jury Theorem (Berend 

and Paroush 1998): limn average(pi-1/2)n =  . 

Thus our synopsis a={aij} is such that each col-

umn has at most kj+1 distinct choices: one correct 

choice and kj equiprobable potential alternative 

forms. We arbitrarily map each choice to a number 

in the set {1,…,kj+1}.  

An ur-text reconstruction is a mapping from the 

synopsis a={aij} to a proposed text in 

{1,…,kj+1}
m
. Our objective is to find an optimal 

reconstruction, given no information other than the 

synopsis a = {aij}. 

5 Our Proposed Method 

We treat our problem as an instance of judg-

ment aggregation in which each of a set of judges 

(manuscripts) makes judgments regarding multiple 

issues (words). This problem has been handled 

(Baharad et al 2011, Bachrach et al 2012, Hovy et 

al. 2013) using variants of EM; we adapt this ap-

proach here for our purposes.  

In principle, given the set of scribal reliabilities 

{pi}i and the probabilities in each column of each 

distinct form being the correct (original) form, 

{p(tj=w|w{1,…,kj+1})}j (or for short, {p(tj=w)}j) 

we could compute the conditional probability of 

obtaining the synopsis a. Thus, given some synop-

sis a, optimality is obtained by the values of {pi}i 

and {p(tj=w)}j that maximize the likelihood of a. 

As shown below, the values {p(tj=w)}j can be de-

termined from a and {pi}i. Thus, denoting by 

p(a;{pi}) the likelihood of a given the parameters 

{pi}i, our objective is to maximize p(a;{pi}).  

Our algorithm, which we’ll call UR, finds a lo-

cal maximum for p(a;{pi}) as follows. First, for 

each token j, we estimate the value of kj by simply 

assuming that every distinct form with non-zero 

probability actually occurs in one of the manu-

scripts (i.e., kj is one less than the number of dis-

tinct forms that appear in the column). Clearly, this 

estimate is only plausible when the number of 

manuscripts is large, but we find that it is good 

enough for our purposes.  

We assign some initial constant value to {pi}i. 

Then we repeat the following two steps until con-

vergence: 

 

1. Use the manuscript reliabilities {pi}i to 

recompute the values {p(tj=w)}j.  

2. Use the values {p(tj=w)}j to estimate the 
maximum likelihood values of the manu-

script  reliabilities {pi}i.  

For the first step, we assume that for every j the 

prior {p(tj=w} is equal for every w{1,…,kj+1}. 

42



 

 

 

 

Then we have by Bayes' rule that for each j and 

each w{1,…,kj+1},  

p(tj=w| a) = p(tj=w| aj) =  
𝒑(𝒂𝒋|𝒕𝒋=𝒘)

𝒁
   where aj is 

the j
th
 column of a and Z is a normalization factor. 

This can easily be computed by substituting 

p(aj|tj=w) =  pi*(1-pi)/kj . 
                  aij=w    aij≠w 
 

For the second step, we compare the values 

{p(tj=w)}j to the judgments of individual i , in or-
der to compute the maximum-likelihood values of 

{pi}i. Specifically, the maximum likelihood value 

of pi is equal to the average (over j) probability that 

aij = tj. Thus, our updated value of pi = 
𝟏

𝒎
(∑ 𝒑(𝒕𝒋𝒋 = 𝒂𝒊𝒋|𝒂)).  

It can be shown that the method converges to a 

local maximum of p(a;{pi}).   

5.1 Handling Dependencies  

The above method would guarantee a (locally) 

optimal solution if it were the case that manu-

scripts are independent of each other. In fact, how-

ever, manuscripts are copied from one another, so 

that various extant manuscripts might have some 

common ancestor (subsequent to the ur-text). Thus, 

for example, third-generation manuscripts fall nat-

urally into clusters, reflecting the second-order 

manuscript from which they are copied. The errors 

in manuscripts in the same cluster tend to be simi-

lar.  

Even when, as is usually the case, we don’t 

have a sufficiently complete collection of manu-

scripts to reconstruct a stemma, we might have 

enough (possibly external) information to at least 

divide the collection into several flat clusters of 

related manuscripts. Given such a clustering, we 

can use the UR method to identify the ur-text for 

each cluster and then use UR once again to recon-

struct the original ur-text from the multiple second-

generation ur-texts. 

 In most real life cases, domain experts are able 

to identify flat clusters (but not a full stemma) us-

ing external evidence. In cases where the clusters 

are not known, automatic clustering methods must 

be used to identify them. 

6 Experiments – Synthetic Synopses 

6.1 Direct Transcription   

We first test our method on synthetic manu-

scripts. For our initial experiment, we assume that 

there is a single ur-text T consisting of m words. T 

is copied directly by each of n scribes. (In these 

experiments, we use n=20.) Each manuscript is 

assigned some random reliability pi (the probabil-

ity of copying a given word correctly) chosen from 

a uniform distribution between 0.20 and 0.99. In 

addition, for each word wj, we let kj have equal 

chances of being either 1 or 2. If a word is copied 

incorrectly, it is randomly replaced by one of kj 

possible other words.  

For each trial, we use the method described 

above to reconstruct the ur-text. As a baseline 

method, we use simple majority rule (SMR) to de-

cide which word to choose in each column of the 

synopsis. 

We run 1000 trials as described above, showing 

results for different manuscript lengths. For each 

algorithm in each trial, we check the proportion of 

words that are reconstructed correctly and we av-

erage the results over all trials. In Figure 2, we 

show the results. 

UR improves initially as manuscript length in-

creases since its estimates of manuscript reliability 

improve, while SMR is indifferent to manuscript 

length. 

In Figure 3, we show results for the same setup 

where document length is fixed at 100 but the 

number of manuscripts varies. UR clearly outper-

forms the baseline simple majority rule.

6.2 Latent Manuscripts 

For our next set of experiments, we drop the as-

sumption that all extant manuscripts are copied 

directly from the ur-text. Instead, we assume that 

our manuscripts are copies of copies. We generate 

20 second-generation manuscripts by noisily copy-

ing the ur-text T 20 times, exactly as above. Now 

we generate 200 third-generation manuscripts, 

each time randomly choosing one of the second-

generation manuscripts and copying it noisily ac-

cording to some randomly-chosen reliability (from 

the same distribution as above). These 200 third-

generation manuscripts serve as input.  

We call the second-generation manuscripts to 

which we do not have access “latent” manuscripts 

and we call the set of third-generation manuscripts 

that are generated from a given second-generation 

manuscript a “cluster”. In these experiments, we 

assume that the clusters are known.   

For each trial, we use each of the following al-

gorithms for regenerating the ur-text: 

1. SMR 
2. UR 

3. Recursive SMR 

4. Recursive UR 

The recursive methods run the algorithm on 

each cluster separately and then again on the re-

sults of the respective clusters. 

In Figure 4, we show accuracy results averaged 

over 1000 trials as described above, showing re-

sults for different manuscript lengths. We find that 

UR that ignores clustering performs very poorly 

but Recursive UR is much stronger, outperforming 

both versions of SMR. (For all data-points, stand-

ard error is <.005, too small to be seen.)

SMR, respectively, for varying manuscript lengths, with and 

without clustering of manuscripts. 

7 An Artificial Manuscript Testbed 

As noted above, our method is appropriate for 

cases in which only a fraction of the manuscripts in 

the stemma are extant. In cases where the bulk of 

the stemma – possibly including the ur-text itself – 

44



 

 

 

 

is extant, it would be better to attempt to recon-

struct the stemma and identify the actual ur-text. 

Notre Besoin (Baret et al 2006) is an artificial 

collection of manuscripts generated by having 

“scribes” successively copy an Old French manu-

script. Thirteen manuscripts of length 1020 were 

generated in this fashion. The full set of manu-

scripts (including the ur-text itself) was used as a 

basis for comparing several methods for stemma 

reconstruction (Roos and Heikkila 2009) and ur-

text reconstruction (Hoenen 2014). 

Although this is a situation in which we regard 

our method as less appropriate than stemma recon-

struction methods, we run it for comparison pur-

poses. 

Hoenen found that an automated method 

(PAML) for stemma reconstruction (Yang 2007), 

yields an ur-text with word error rate of 4.7% and 

that post-processing the obtained stemma using a 

method akin to Recursive SMR lowers the word 

error rate to 4.1%. We find that applying Recursive 

UR to three non-hierarchical clusters – the de-

scendants of the three highest-level non-root nodes 

in the stemma reconstructed by PAML (provided 

by A. Hoenen) – while ignoring all other infor-

mation in the stemma, yields an ur-text word error 

rate of 4.6%. Thus the complete stemma recon-

struction offers no clear benefit beyond the shallow 

clustering method for our purposes.   

8 A Real-World Manuscript Testbed 

Finally, we consider a real-world example. The 

Babylonian Talmud is a 6
th
 century Aramaic com-

pendium transmitted orally and written down sev-

eral centuries later in Hebrew letters in Iraq. We 

use a synoptic version of a single chapter of the 

Talmud (the second chapter of Tractate Beitzah), 

consisting of 8564 columns and 20 manuscripts, 

seven of which are relatively complete and the rest 

of which are very fragmentary. A domain expert 

established that, based on external evidence, the 

manuscripts split naturally into six identifiable 

clusters (containing 8, 4, 3, 3, 1, and 1 manu-

scripts, respectively).  

Several pre-processing steps are applied to the 

raw synopsis. First, we automatically identify mi-

nor orthographic variants within a given column 

and standardize them so that they are treated as 

identical. Furthermore, since the raw synopsis in-

cludes single words, rather than phrases, in a given 

column, there are many dependencies among con-

secutive columns. To eliminate the most egregious 

such dependencies, we iteratively conflate to a sin-

gle column all perfectly correlated consecutive 

columns. After conflating dependent columns in 

this way, we remain with 5912 columns. In Figure 

5, we show the proportion of these columns con-

tain a single form, two variant forms, and so on. As 

can be seen, only for 17% of the columns do all 

manuscripts agree.  

 

 
Figure 5: The proportion of columns in the Beitzah corpus 

containing a given number of word forms 
 

 

We apply Recursive UR, as well as Recursive 

SMR as a baseline method, to the processed syn-

opsis. Recursive UR assigns the six clusters relia-

bilities ranging from 0.46 to 0.78, with the highest 

reliability assigned to a cluster consisting of a sin-

gle manuscript indeed considered to be particularly 

ancient and trustworthy. 

The two methods disagree for 448 of the col-

umns and agree for the rest. Our domain expert 

(who did not know which word choice came from 

which method) provided the most likely correct 

word according to his own judgment for those col-

umns for which the two methods disagree. Of the 

448 disagreements, he determined that 80 were 

significant and resolvable. In 66 of these 80 cases 

(82.5%), the expert’s judgment coincided with the 

form chosen by UR and in only 14 cases (17.5%), 

his judgment coincided with SMR.

9 Conclusions 

We have found that ur-texts can be reconstructed 

using automated methods far more effectively than 

using a simple majority rule. Furthermore, this can 

be done to some extent even using only manu-

scripts from the third-generation and later.  

We have assumed that the correct clustering of 

manuscripts is known. Left for future work is the 

case in which the clusters are identified using au-

tomated clustering methods.  

More importantly, perhaps, we have assumed 

throughout that a given manuscript has some fixed 

reliability over all words. In fact, it might be the 

case that reliability varies over different tokens (or 

types) and that, moreover, not each distinct form of 

a word is an equally probable alternative to the 

original. Graphical models could be used to gener-

alize our approach to handle such cases.
