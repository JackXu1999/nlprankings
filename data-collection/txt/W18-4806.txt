Abstract

In this paper we describe preliminary work on Kawennón:nis, a verb conjugator for Kanyen'kéha
(Ohsweken dialect). The project is the result of a collaboration between Onkwawenna Kenty-
ohkwa Kanyen'kéha immersion school and the Canadian National Research Council’s Indigenous
Language Technology lab.

The purpose of Kawennón:nis is to build on the educational successes of the Onkwawenna Ken-
tyohkwa school and develop a tool that assists students in learning how to conjugate verbs in
Kanyen'kéha; a skill that is essential to mastering the language. Kawennón:nis is implemented
with both web and mobile front-ends that communicate with an application programming inter-
face that in turn communicates with a symbolic language model implemented as a finite state
transducer. Eventually, it will serve as a foundation for several other applications for both
Kanyen'kéha and other Iroquoian languages.

1 Introduction

Kanyen'kéha is an Iroquoian language, commonly known as “Mohawk”, spoken in parts of Canada
(Ontario and Quebec) and the United States (New York state). It has a vibrant community of learners,
and educators but only about 3,500 L1 (first-language) speakers. Three main dialects are currently in
use: Western (Ohsweken and Kenhteke), Eastern (Kahnawake, Kanehsatake and Wahta) and Central
(Akwesasne). In our current work we focus exclusively on the Western dialect as spoken in Ohsweken.

The Truth and Reconciliation Committee of Canada led an inquiry into the atrocities committed during
the residential school era in Canada from 1883 to the late 1990s. In 2015, they released a report (TRC,
2015) containing 94 calls to action, among them five action items that are related to Indigenous languages
and culture. The report confirmed a macabre reality of residential schools that Indigenous people have
known all along, that the residential school system was “created for the purpose of separating Aboriginal
children from their families, in order to minimize and weaken family ties and cultural linkages” (TRC,
2015).

Since the release of the TRC report, a number of governmental and non-governmental programs and
initiatives aimed at supporting Indigenous languages in Canada have been started. This project is a part
of the National Research Council’s (further NRC) related initiative to research and develop Indigenous
language technology1.

Despite the disproportionate duress that speakers of Indigenous languages have endured at the hands
of Canadian colonial policies, the resilience and tenacity of Indigenous language communities can be
seen in the myriad ways that they have resisted and continued to teach, learn and speak their languages
(Pine and Turin, 2017, for further discussion). One such initiative is that of Onkwawenna Kentyohkwa,
described in depth in Section 4. Given the widely celebrated accomplishments of Onkwawenna Kenty-
ohkwa for almost two decades, it is apparent that it will be successful with or without the assistance of

technology. It is therefore the goal of Kawennón:nis to develop a fundamentally assistive reference tool
that doesn’t replace learners’ experience of acquiring Kanyen'kéha verbal morphology at Onkwawenna
Kentyohkwa, but that augments and complements it.

Another factor contributing to the technological inequity faced by second-language learners of
Kanyen'kéha compared with learners of more resourced languages is the result of the text-based bias
of contemporary language technologies. Similar to most other Indigenous languages of North America,
Kanyen'kéha acquired a standardized orthography recently (1993), relative to the multi-millennial history
of the language’s oral tradition. Dialectal differences, variations in spelling and the general paucity of
written content in the language make statistical language learning difficult. The situation is particularly
dire for the Western dialect: very little text is available in the Ohsweken dialect of Kanyen'kéha apart
from Onkwawenna Kentyohkwa’s curricular materials.

Most Indigenous languages in Eastern, Central and Northern Canada show high levels of polysynthe-
sis, that is, their words are composed of relatively many morphemes. All Iroquoian languages fall into
this category. Single words in Kanyen'kéha are routinely translated as entire sentences in English. For
example:

(1) enhake'serehtsherakwatákwahse-'
en-hake-'serehtsher-kwatakw-ahse-'
will-he.to.me-car-fix.it.up-for.me-punctual
FUT-3SG.M/1SG-fix.it.up-BEN-PUNC

‘he will repair my car for me’

(2) tetsyonkyathahahkwahnónhne
te-ts-yonky-at-hahahkw-hnón-hne
both-again-it.to.you.and.I-each.other-walk-purposive-have.gone
DUAL-REP-3SG.N/1.DU.INCL-SREFL-walk-PURP-PPFV

‘the two of us went for a walk’

The generative power and compositional morphology of the language is such that neologisms are
easily created, with no borrowing necessary. For example, the word for pizza is teyotena'tarahwe'nón:ni
which literally means round bread. However, this property also makes the language difficult to teach, as
learners cannot be expected to memorize paradigms arbitrarily. Rather, they must learn the patterns to
generate the paradigms. This is the essential insight on which the morpheme-based teaching approach
adopted by the Onkwawenna Kentyohkwa is based (see Section 4). The fact that there are 72 distinct
bound pronominal morphemes in Kanyen'kéha means that even learning how to properly conjugate a
modest number of verbs requires a significant amount of work. Kawennón:nis is a tool designed to help
students with this task. It allows a user to enter a number of variables which the software then processes
and outputs the corresponding grammatical form.

To the best of our knowledge, textual data in the Ohsweken dialect of Kanyen'kéha available publicly is
quite scarce. Accordingly, we were not able to identify a sufficiently large corpus to use with statistical
methods. The Ohsweken dialect also has less linguistic documentation than the Eastern and Central
dialects which have been studied more extensively (Postal, 1963; Bonvillain, 1973; Beatly, 1974; Mithun,
2004). However, Onkwawenna Kentyohkwa has created a textbook (Maracle, 2017) that describes and
explains salient morphological properties of Kanyen'kéha as spoken in Ohsweken. The textbook, along
with linguistic sources about other dialects of Kanyen'kéha and the closely related language Oneida are
the primary sources of information for creating the symbolic language model of Ohsweken Kanyen'kéha.

We see the main contributions of this work as follows. Successful collaborations between Indigenous
communities and technology partners are rare. Perhaps the single most important contribution of this
work is that it gives an example of a productive, harmonious collaboration between an immersion school



55

within an Indigenous community (Onkwawenna Kentyohkwa) and a research group from outside the
community (NRC). Details of this collaboration are discussed in Section 4.

Secondly, Kanyen'kéha has very little software support. Apart from LanguageGeek2 and FirstVoices3

keyboards there is no software that enables use of the language on desktops or on mobile devices. It
is therefore a second important contribution of this work that we are creating the first computational
language model of Kanyen'kéha.

The third contribution is in the applications, though at present these are prototypes and proofs of con-
cept. Creating a symbolic language model is time consuming and error-prone. The finite state transducer
behind Kawennón:nis is currently used for the verb conjugator and a limited spell-checker but in future,
we hope to add other applications, thereby maximally leveraging the time and effort involved in making
Kawennón:nis.

This paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we place our project in the context of related research.
In Section 3 we provide a high-level sketch of the relevant Kanyen'kéha verbal paradigms. Section 4
describes the immersion school Onkwawenna Kentyohkwa, the unique immersion teaching method it
uses and the collaboration with NRC. Section 5 provides an overview of the software architecture of
Kawennón:nis. In Section 6 we describe the symbolic language model that we have created. Section 7
talks about two prototype applications implemented to date and includes a brief discussion of evaluation.
Finally, we discussing future Work in Section 8 and provide conclusions in Section 9.

2 Related Work

In this section we will list some of the relevant computational systems. Our work also heavily depends
on linguistic sources (Lounsbury, 1953; Postal, 1963; Bonvillain, 1973; Beatly, 1974; Mithun, 1996;
Mithun, 2004)). Furthermore, many language activists, teachers, students have made important contri-
butions which, for the most part, are not available for citing.

While in general it is true that Indigenous languages lack adequate linguistic software support, our
work relies on previous computational and linguistic research.

Moshagen et al. (2013) describe Giella - a framework for FST-based modeling of languages with the
aim of easily creating end-user applications. The Giella infrastructure has been successfully used to
create FSTs and corresponding tools for a number of languages: Cree (Snoek et al., 2014; Harrigan et
al., 2017), Northern Haida (Lachler et al., 2018), Odawa (Bowers et al., 2017) are but a few of the many
examples.

In a different line of work Littell et al. (2017) have created a tool called Mother Tongues Dictionaries
(formerly Waldayu) that helps communities create web and mobile dictionaries from potentially hetero-
geneous community resources. The mobile version is used as the mobile front end for the extensive
FirstVoices resources (Brand et al., 2015) .

For Indigenous languages where it is realistic to collect sufficient data, statistical modeling has been
used successfully. Martin et al. (2003; Désilets et al. (2008) use parallel English-Inuktitut corpora to
create translation memories and Micher (2017) uses a monolingual corpus of Inuktitut to improve the
performance of a morphological analyzer.

For a recent survey of language technologies for Indigenous languages in Canada see (Littell et al.,
forthcoming). A more extensive inventory of open-source resources, in both Indigenous and other lan-
guages, is available at github.com/RichardLitt/endangered-languages.

Our work is most similar to that of Snoek et al. (2014; Harrigan et al. (2017; Lachler et al. (2018;
Bowers et al. (2017). Kawennón:nis is somewhat similar to morphologically-aware dictionaries, but its
design and content is far more customized.

yako- it to her yakonòn:we's it likes her
take- you to me takenòn:we's you like me
she- you to her shenòn:we's you like her

3 Kanyen'kéha, the language of the Kanyen'kehá:ka

Kanyen'kéha4 is part of the Iroquoian language family5. Two main subgroups of the Iroquoian lan-
guage family are distinguished: the Southern Iroquoian (now only containing Cherokee) and Northern
Iroquoian (Cayuga, Onondaga, Seneca, Mohawk (Kanyen'kéha), Oneida, Wyandot, Nottoway and Tus-
carora) (Mithun, 2004). Wyandot is currently often considered a sleeping language, but see (Lukaniec,
2010) for very promising reclamation and revitalization work.

Kanyen'kéha has 11 consonants6 /h/, /k/, /n/, /r/, /s/, /t/, /w/, /y/, /ts/, /kw/, and /P/ (Mithun, 2004) and
6 vowels /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /2̃/, and /õ/7. Vowels can be marked for stress (´) and falling tone (`); both stress
and falling tone can be marked for length (:) (Mithun, 1996).

A pronominal prefix, a verb root and an aspectual ending are always present (for commands the as-
pectual ending is null). A verb can contain pre- and post-pronominal prefixes and pre-aspectual suffixes.
Verb roots are also bound morphemes and do not, on their own, constitute well-formed words.

Kanyen'kéha has 15 stand-alone or free pronouns, and 72 bound pronouns which can only be used as a
part of a verb. Bound pronouns in Kanyen'kéha are very complex (Mithun, 1996). In one morphological
unit, a pronoun encodes information about both the agent and the patient of an action. For both the
agent and the patient, it also captures gender (male, female, neuter), number (single, dual or plural) and
whether the hearer is included in the set (inclusivity). If no agent or patient is available, the pronoun is
the same as the single neuter pronoun.

Some example pronouns are shown in Figure 1. The bound pronouns are divided into three groups:
active pronouns (3; roughly for situations where the actor is human, and the patient is not, or where there
is no patient), passive pronouns (4; for situations where the patient is human and the agent is not) and
“transitive” pronouns (5; for situations when both the actor and the patient are human). Below are some
examples:

(3) Senòn:wes
se-nonhwe’n-s
you.to.it-like-habitual
2.SG.AGENT-like-HAB

‘You like it.’

(4) Sanòn:wes
sa-nonhwe'n-s
it.to.you-like-habitual
2.SG.PATIENT-like-HAB

‘It likes you.’

4ISO 639-2 code is moh.
5In this Section and further in this paper we are sometimes faced with the choice of whether to use standardized terminology

from Linguistics, or to rely on the knowledge of the community. Almost exclusively, we use the terminology and categories as
described in (Maracle, 2017). We made this decision because the textbook is the most detailed and accurate description of the
Ohsweken dialect available to-date and because the theoretical understandings of the textbook form the basis of our language
model.

6These are represented orthographically and taught as 8 consonants, h, k, n, r, s, t, w, y, plus glottal stop ' (Maracle, 2017).
7These are represented orthographically as a, e, i, o, en, on respectively.



57

(5) Takenòn:wes
take-nonhwe'n-s
you.to.me-like-habitual
2.SG/1.SG-like-HAB

‘You like me.’

In reality, the situation is not quite this simple: in many cases, the choice of a pronoun is lexicalized
and determined more by the history of a specific verb or by traditional usage than by tangible properties
of the actor or the patient.

For instance the verb rihwayent meaning ‘decide’ as seen in example 6 below uses patientive pronouns
(in this case wake, roughly meaning it to me.)

(6) ya’tewakerihwayentà:ses
y-a'-te-wake-rihwayent-'se-s
there-did-it.to.me-decide-for.me-habitual
TRANS-FACT-1.SG.PATIENT-business.matters-decide-BEN-HAB

‘I decided.’

There are 11 possible pre-pronominal prefixes and a verb can take on one or more of them. Some
possible prefixes are the definite (7), cislocative (8), translocative (9), and many others. For example:

(7) Wa'katáweya'te'
wa'-k-ataweya't-e'
did-I.to.it-enter.a.place-punctual
FACT-1.SG.AGENT-enter.a.place-PUNC

‘I entered (a place).’

(8) Takatáweya'te'
t-a-k-ataweya't-e'
here-did.here-I.to.it-enter.a.place-punctual
CIS-FACT-1.SG.AGENT-enter.a.place-PUNC

‘I came in (here).’

(9) Ya'katáweya'te'
y-a'-k-ataweya't-e'
there-did-I.to.it-enter.a.place-punctual
TRANS-FACT-1.SG.AGENT-enter.a.place-PUNC

‘I went in (there).’

A verb may also take one of the three pre-aspectual case suffixes (Beatly, 1974). For example the
distributive (11), reversive (12) or purposive (13):

(10) Enkhnyó:ten'
en-k-hnyot-en'
will-I-stand.up-punctual
FUT-1SG.AGENT-stand.up-PUNC

‘I will stand it up.’

(11) Enkhnyónnyon'
en-k-hnyot-onnyon-'
will-I-stand.up-distributive-punctual
FUT-1SG.AGENT-stand.up-DIST-PUNC

‘I will stand many things up.’

(12) Enkhnyotá:ko'
en-k-hnyot-ako-'
will-I-stand.up-reversive-punctual
FUT-1SG.AGENT-stand.up-REV-PUNC

‘I will lower it.’

(13) Enkhnyotà:na'
en-k-hnyot-ahn-a'
will-I-stand.up-purposive-punctual
FUT-1SG.AGENT-stand.up-PURP-PUNC

‘I will go stand it up.’



58

The stem of a verb can also be complex due to noun incorporation. In the current version of
Kawennón:nis we only cover a limited set of paradigms: namely the mandatory parts of the verb (the
pronominal prefix, the root and the aspectual ending). In the coming months, we will extend our model
to all paradigms that do not require semantic restrictions.

4 Collaboration between NRC & Onkwawenna Kentyohkwa

Onkwawenna Kentyohkwa is an adult immersion program in southern Ontario that was founded in 1999.
The program currently teaches a two-year program that enables students to achieve high levels of profi-
ciency in Kanyen'kéha (the “Mohawk” language). Students attend six hours per day, five days a week,
for two school years, totaling 2,000 hours of instruction, all in the language.

The program uses a unique morpheme-based teaching method that allows students with little or no
previous language exposure to achieve one of the Advanced levels on oral proficiency assessments based
on the American Council on Teaching of Foreign Languages model (Breiner-Sanders et al., 2000). A
few graduates are now raising children as first-language speakers.

The program’s success has generated interest across the continent and adult groups from other Iroquois
communities (Oneida and Seneca) have translated the curriculum and materials into their languages to
teach adults in their communities.

The idea behind creating Kawennón:nis, originated with a staff member of the Onkwawenna Ken-
tyohkwa School. Thus, the Onkwawenna Kentyohkwa school defined the scope and the main parts
of Kawennón:nis, motivated by a specific educational need that the staff of Onkwawenna Kentyohkwa
identified as important.

In order to move ahead with the project in a collaborative fashion, NRC partnered with a staff mem-
ber of the school who participated in ongoing correspondence and communication, including weekly
online meetings to discuss the user interface of Kawennón:nis and to make decisions regarding morphol-
ogy. Additionally, members of NRC have made several in-person visits to Ohsweken to demonstrate
Kawennón:nis to students and staff of Onkwawenna Kentyohkwa and to participate in intensive, multi-
day, collaborative efforts brainstorming project decisions and direction as well as designing the user in-
terfaces. This level of mutual collaboration and continual involvement from both NRC and Onkwawenna
Kentyohkwa will be essential if the project is to succeed.

5 Kawennón:nis: Overview

Kawennón:nis is built with the hope of supporting a wide variety of user applications, and of eventually
extending it to use with other Iroquoian languages. It consists of three main parts: (1) a ‘frontend’
implemented with Angular and Ionic for the web, as well as Android and iOS platforms. (2) An API
implemented in Python (Flask). (3) a ‘backend’ consisting of a finite state transducer implemented
in Foma (Hulden, 2009). This architecture allows alternate frontends or future iterations of the current
frontend tools to make use of the FST. It also gives a clear point of integration for FSTs of other Iroquoian
languages. This section describes the software architecture for Kawennón:nis as illustrated in Figure 2.

Figure 2: Kawennón:nis system architecture from back to front.



59

5.1 API
The Kawennón:nis API (Application Programming Interface) is used to define the methods through
which frontend components or applications like websites or mobile apps may interact with the backend
FST. The API is read-only, requires an API-key to be accessed and follows RESTful design principles,
whereby the API is stateless, cacheable, decoupled from the FST and frontend applications as much as
possible and exposes information about available verbs, pronouns, conjugated forms and other data as
discrete resources and subresources.

5.2 Web & mobile applications
The user interface for both web and mobile frontends have the same core components. First, a ‘conju-
gation’ component which renders the API response on a number of different user-defined tiers. Second,
a ‘palette’ component which allows the user to set the parameters for the request to the API. Below in
Figure 3 the conjugation component can be seen on the left and the palette component on the right.

Additionally, the user has control over which parts in the conjugation to highlight. The Onkwawenna
Kentyohkwa immersion school uses a colour scheme where agents are highlighted in red, patients in
blue and transitive pronouns are highlighted in purple. For ensuring an easy transition between the
course and Kawennón:nis, this colour scheme is preserved in Kawennón:nis and the user can optionally
select whether to also colour-code the verb stem or various other types of affixes (aspectual suffixes,
for example). The user is also able to select between a variety of tiers to display in the conjugation
component. The first, main tier is the orthographic word without any segmentation. The next tiers that
are available include a morpheme breakdown tier, and two type glossing tiers, one which simply glosses
all morphemes by their category (ie ‘pronoun’, ‘root’ etc.) and another which gives the English gloss (ie.
‘you’, ‘cook’ etc.). Users are anonymously authenticated and their settings are saved across sessions on
the same devices.

6 Symbolic Model of Verbal Morphology in Kanyen'kéha

The backbone of Kawennón:nis is a symbolic model of the Kanyen'kéha verbal morphology implemented
as a finite state transducer (further FST).

A finite state transducer is a type of finite state automaton that maps between two sets of states: the
input set and the output set. The sets of states are often referred to as the input and output alphabets. The
transducer can be thought of as a “translating machine”: it translates an input sequence into an output
one. In our context, the FST first translates a sequence specifying 1) the verb stem and 2) a set of tags
capturing the desired morphological properties, and then it outputs a verb correct form.

Formally, an FST is a seven-tuple (Q,Σ,Γ, δ, w, I, F ) such thatQ is the finite set of all possible states,
Σ is the finite set of all possible input symbols – the input alphabet, Γ is the finite set of all possible output

Figure 3: The Kawennón:nis web application



60

symbols – the output alphabet, δ : Q × Σ → Q is the transition function, w : Q × Σ → Γ is the output
function, I ⊂ Q is the set of initial states and F ⊂ Q is the set of accepting states (Mohri, 1997).

For example, a toy FST for a subset of conjugations of the verb cook is shown in Figure 4 below.
Example 14 below is a demonstration of the valid input mappings to the corresponding output sequences.

(14) a. cook+3rd→ cooks
b. cook+Past→ cooked
c. kick+Participle→ kicking

In general even if the morphological paradigms that are encoded are complex, adding new verbs is
simple and straightforward.

Following the convention (Beesley and Karttunen, 2003; Koskenniemi, 1986), we separate lexical and
morphological rules from phonological alternations in our implementation. The latter are applied as a
second layer. The rules are implemented as a continuation lexicon in lexc formalism and the phonological
alternations as rewrite rules, both of which are implemented in Foma (Hulden, 2009). See Beesley and
Karttunen (2003) for a discussion on structuring linguistic FSTs.

Creating a linguistic FST involves manually hand-coding all morphological rules - a very time-
consuming and potentially error-prone process. A more contemporary alternative would be to learn
morphology from a corpus. However, we are unaware of any sufficiently large, homogeneous corpus of
Kanyen'kéha; nor are we aware of any corpus at all for the Ohsweken dialect. On the other hand, some
linguistic documentation for Kanyen'kéha is available (Beatly, 1974; Bonvillain, 1973; Postal, 1963;
Mithun, 1996; Mithun, 2004). The root-word method textbook (Maracle, 2017), the linguistic sources
listed above and continuous input from a proficient speaker of Kanyen'kéha8 have been our main sources
of information.

The FST is structured so that adding new verbs is fast and painless: it amounts to entering a lexical
entry into a spreadsheet and specifying several properties. The input, collation and quality control of this
task is done by both NRC researchers and teachers at Onkwawenna Kentyohkwa.

Long-distance dependencies complicate the otherwise relatively straightforward structure of morpho-
logical rules. While there are no true long-distance dependencies, the selectional preferences of verbs are
treated like long-distance dependencies by the lexc formalism. Some examples are restrictions on what
type of bound pronoun can be used with a given verb, the conjugation class of a verb or the presence of
a mandatory prefix. We model such dependencies using flag diacritics.

Phonological alternations are yet another challenge. For example, each of the 72 possible bound pro-
nouns changes depending on which sound follows it.9 Five major categories can be distinguished (verb
stems that start with a consonant, an “a”, “e’, “i”, or an “o’). However, there are numerous exceptions to
this which makes encoding phonological rules non-trivial.

affixes are possible.

Kawennón:nis is an early-stage research project and only a limited prototype has been released (to
a limited audience) and demonstrated to the community. The current version contains 30 verb stems,
all bound pronouns and 6 temporal paradigms (Command, Habitual form, Perfective form and Punctual
forms which include Definite past, Conditional and Future forms). These were chosen because of their
direct and early relevance in the teaching curriculum at Onkwawenna Kentyohkwa. We are working on
extending the lexicon to approximately 500 verb roots and including other paradigms.

7 Applications and Evaluation of the Kawennón:nis FST

Because of the early stage of this work and the absence of corpora, Kawennón:nis has not yet been
formally evaluated. However, our current workflow involves weekly meetings and consultations with
a proficient language speaker, who is a recent graduate of the program and now an educator10. The
correctness of the rules and the generated forms is checked step-by-step, manually. To the extent possible,
we intend to run a statistical evaluation once Kawennón:nis is close to completion.

Currently, the FST model is the backbone of three applications: the web application Kawennón:nis,
its mobile app version and a spellchecker. We have already described Kawennón:nis in Section 5. The
spellchecker is generated using the Giellatekno infrastructure (Moshagen et al., 2013). The spellchecker
only works in Office Libre but it is also unclear if the spellchecker will end up being released or used.
There is some hesitance within the community to develop a tool that corrects users’ spelling, as there is
this approach might be too prescriptive and punitive as well as reinforce a singular dialect, not allowing
for minor, but accepted, idiosyncratic differences in spelling. That is to say, just because we can develop a
particular technology with little extra effort does not necessarily mean we should. This question requires
further consideration.

Given how time-consuming it is to create a symbolic language model, we intend to use it for as many
applications as possible. In the near future, we intend to start a flash-card generator that would allow
students learn the subsets of morphology they are most interested in.

The next application we intend to focus on is predictive text on mobile devices.

8 Future Work

In the immediate future we will extend the inventory of verb roots to 500 and work on including all
relevant paradigms, namely pre-pronominal prefixes and pre-aspectual suffixes.

It is quite likely that we will be unable to include a majority of derivational affixes because selectional
preferences are not uniform across verbs in Kanyen'kéha. This may be addressed to a large extent by
subcategorizing the lexicon but this solution may become too unwieldy. In a similar vein, we will prob-
ably be unable to properly address noun incorporation due to semantic restrictions. However, we hope
to include a small subset of derivational affixes in a held-out, limited set of verbs that will help students
master the phenomena of derivational suffixes and noun incorporation.

Although nouns are not as frequent in Kanyen'kéha as verbs, they are obviously still a very important
part of the language and thus we will encode some nominal morphology after the verbal part is complete.

One of the biggest problems in collecting a reliable corpus of Kanyen'kéha is dialectal differences.
Plans for future work include creating a transducer between dialects which would allow corpora from
different dialects to be leveraged and used for statistical learning. It is also our hope that this work be
extended to other Iroquoian languages, such as Oneida.

While most of the future work mentioned above is centered around improving the language model, we
are also interested in leveraging the generative power of the model by making use of it in other applica-
tions. The details will not be clear until Kawennón:nis has been launched and used by the Onkwawenna
Kentyohkwa immersion school. That is, what was needed in the initial applications of Kawennón:nis
was ascertained by Onkwawenna Kentyohkwa staff who have the perspective that only years of experi-
ence can provide, and similarly, future applications and implementations of Kawennón:nis following its
initial release will require thoughtful planning and an acute awareness of the needs of Kanyen'kéha teach-

ers and learners alike. Some potential applications include automatic flash card generators, spellcheckers
and predictive text for mobile devices.

9 Conclusions

In this paper we presented preliminary work on Kawennón:nis, a verb conjugator for Kanyen'kéha.
The FST technology behind Kawennón:nis is time-consuming to engineer and difficult to change or

adapt, yet the low-data reality of many Indigenous languages is such that we cannot rely on statistical
alternatives. In general, smaller languages do not benefit in the short term from recent advances in
Language Processing or Machine Learning, due to a general scarcity of linguistic data. Restricting our
toolset to newer technologies would preclude us from making progress on this project.

Looking beyond Kawennón:nis, it is important to note the general lack of linguistic software support
for most Indigenous languages of North America, with many language communities only recently having
their writing systems supported by Unicode or having an input system to write their languages on mobile
devices11 or computers (Pine and Turin, 2018).

With Indigenous languages facing increased pressure from majority languages like English or French,
many language activists are turning to technology to assist in reclaiming and revitalizing their languages.
Developing basic technological scaffolding to support online communication through social media, text
processing tools and reference tools like Kawennón:nis could have an important role to play in this
process. It is clear that given the self-determined nature of Indigenous language reclamation efforts that
the only way forward is through respectful, contextually-informed collaboration. It is our hope that the
development of Kawennón:nis is a small but confident step in the right direction.
