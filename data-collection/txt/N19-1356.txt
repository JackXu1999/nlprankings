Abstract

How do typological properties such as word
order and morphological case marking af-
fect the ability of neural sequence models to
acquire the syntax of a language? Cross-
linguistic comparisons of RNNs’ syntactic
performance (e.g., on subject-verb agreement
prediction) are complicated by the fact that
any two languages differ in multiple typo-
logical properties, as well as by differences
in training corpus. We propose a paradigm
that addresses these issues: we create syn-
thetic versions of English, which differ from
English in one or more typological parame-
ters, and generate corpora for those languages
based on a parsed English corpus. We re-
port a series of experiments in which RNNs
were trained to predict agreement features for
verbs in each of those synthetic languages.
Among other findings, (1) performance was
higher in subject-verb-object order (as in En-
glish) than in subject-object-verb order (as in
Japanese), suggesting that RNNs have a re-
cency bias; (2) predicting agreement with both
subject and object (polypersonal agreement)
improves over predicting each separately, sug-
gesting that underlying syntactic knowledge
transfers across the two tasks; and (3) overt
morphological case makes agreement predic-
tion significantly easier, regardless of word or-
der.

1 Introduction

The strong performance of recurrent neural net-
works (RNNs) in applied natural language pro-
cessing tasks has motivated an array of studies
that have investigated their ability to acquire nat-
ural language syntax without syntactic annota-
tions; these studies have identified both strengths
(Linzen et al., 2016; Giulianelli et al., 2018;
Gulordava et al., 2018; Kuncoro et al., 2018;
van Schijndel and Linzen, 2018; Wilcox et al.,

2018) and limitations (Chowdhury and Zampar-
elli, 2018; Marvin and Linzen, 2018; Wilcox et al.,
2018).

Most of the work so far has focused on En-
glish, a language with a specific word order and
relatively poor morphology. Do the typological
properties of a language affect the ability of RNNs
to learn its syntactic regularities? Recent studies
suggest that they might. Gulordava et al. (2018)
evaluated language models on agreement predic-
tion in English, Russian, Italian and Hebrew, and
found worse performance on English than the
other languages. In the other direction, a study
on agreement prediction in Basque showed sub-
stantially worse average-case performance than
reported for English (Ravfogel et al., 2018).

Existing cross-linguistic comparisons are dif-
ficult to interpret, however. Models were in-
evitably trained on a different corpus for each
language. The constructions tested can differ
across languages (Gulordava et al., 2018). Per-
haps most importantly, any two natural languages
differ in a number of typological dimensions, such
as morphological richness, word order, or explicit
case marking. This paper proposes a controlled
experimental paradigm for studying the interac-
tion of the inductive bias of a neural architec-
ture with particular typological properties. Given
a parsed corpus for a particular natural language
(English, in our experiments), we generate cor-
pora for synthetic languages that differ from the
original language in one of more typological pa-
rameters (Chomsky, 1981), following Wang and
Eisner (2016). In a synthetic version of English
with a subject-object-verb order, for example, sen-
tence (1-a) would be transformed into (1-b):

(1) a. The man eats the apples.
b. The man the apples eats.

Figure 1: The sentences generated in our synthetic languages based on an original English sentence. All verbs
in the experiments reported in the paper carried subject and object agreement suffixes as in the polypersonal
agreement experiment; we omitted these suffixes from the word order variation examples in the table for ease of
reading.

We then train a model to predict the agreement
features of the verb; in the present paper, we focus
on predicting the plurality of the subject and the
object (that is, whether they are singular or plural).
The subject plurality prediction problem for (1-b),
for example, can be formulated as follows:

(2) The man the apples 〈singular/plural subject?〉.

We illustrate the potential of this approach in a
series of case studies. We first experiment with
polypersonal agreement, in which the verb agrees
with both the subject and the object (§3). We then
manipulate the order of the subject, the object and
the verb (§4), and experiment with overt morpho-
logical case (§5). For a preview of our synthetic
languages, see Figure 1.

2 Setup

Synthetic Language Generation We used an
expert-annotated corpus, to avoid potential con-
founds between the typological parameters we
manipulated and possible parse errors in an au-
tomatically parsed corpus. As our starting point,
we took the English Penn Treebank (Marcus et al.,
1993), converted to the Universal Dependencies
scheme (Nivre et al. 2016) using the Stanford con-
verter (Schuster and Manning, 2016). We then
manipulated the tree representations of the sen-
tences in the corpus to generate parametrically
modified English corpora, varying in case sys-

tems, agreement patterns, and order of core ele-
ments. For each parametric version of English, we
recorded the verb-argument relations within each
sentence, and created a labeled dataset. We ex-
posed our models to sentences from which one of
the verbs was omitted, and trained them to predict
the plurality of the arguments of the unseen verb.
The following paragraph describes the process of
collecting verb-argument relations; a detailed dis-
cussion of the parametric generation process for
agreement marking, word order and case marking
is given in the corresponding sections. We have
made our synthetic language generation code pub-
licly available.1

Argument Collection We created a labeled
agreement prediction dataset by first collecting
verb-arguments relations from the parsed corpus.
We collected nouns, proper nouns, pronouns, ad-
jectives, cardinal numbers and relative pronouns
connected to a verb (identified by its part-of-
speech tag) with an nsubj, nsubjpass or dobj de-
pendency edge, and record the plurality of those
arguments. Verbs that were the head of a clausal
complement without a subject (xcomp dependen-
cies) were excluded. We recorded the plurality of
the dependents of the verb regardless of whether
the tense and person of the verb condition agree-
ment in English (that is, not only in third-person

present-tense verbs). For relative pronouns that
function as subjects or objects, we recorded the
plurality of their referent; for instance, in the
phrase Treasury bonds, which pay lower interest
rates, we considered the verb pay to have a plural
subject.

Prediction Task We experimented both with
prediction of one of the arguments of the verb
(subject or object), and with a joint setting in
which the model predicted both arguments of each
verb. Consider, for example, the prediction prob-
lem (3) (the verb in the original sentence was
gave):

(3) The state 〈verb〉 CenTrust 30 days to sell the
Rubens .

In the joint prediction setting the sys-
tem is expected to make the prediction
〈subject: singular, object: plural〉. For each
argument, the model predicts one of three cate-
gories: SINGULAR, PLURAL or NONE. The NONE
label was used in the object prediction task for
intransitive verbs, which do not have an object; it
was never used in the subject prediction task.

Model We used bidirectional LSTMs with 150
hidden units. The bidirectional LSTM’s represen-
tation of the left and right contexts of the verb
was fed into a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with
two hidden layers of sizes 100 and 50. We used
independent MLPs to predict subject and object
plurality. To capture morphological information,

words were represented as the sum of the word
embedding and embeddings of the character n-
grams that made up the word.2

The model (including the embedding layer)
was trained end-to-end using the Adam optimizer
(Kingma and Ba, 2014). For each of the experi-
ments described in the paper, we trained four mod-
els with different random initializations; we report
averaged results alongside standard deviations.

3 Polypersonal Agreement

In languages with polypersonal agreement, verbs
agree not only with their subject (as in English),
but also with their direct object. Consider the fol-
lowing Basque example:3

(4) Kutxazain-ek
cashier-PL.ERG

bezeroa-ri
customer-SG.DAT

liburu-ak
book-PL.ABS

eman dizkiote
gave they-them-to-her/him
The cashiers gave the books to the customer.

Information about the grammatical role of certain
constituents in the sentence may disambiguate the
function of others; most trivially, if a word is the
subject of a given verb, it cannot simultaneously
be its object. The goal of the present experiment
is to determine whether jointly predicting both ob-
ject and subject plurality improves the overall per-
formance of the model.

Corpus Creation In sentences with multiple
verbs, agreement markers on verbs other than the
prediction target could plausibly help predict the
features on the target verb. In a preliminary ex-
periment, we did not observe clear differences
between different verb marking schemes (e.g.,
avoiding marking agreement on verbs other than
the prediction target). We thus opted for full mark-
ing in all experiments: verbs are modified with
suffixes that encode the number of all their argu-
ments (see Figure 1). The suffixes we used for
verbs are a concatenation of the respective case
suffixes of their arguments (Table 2). For consis-
tency, we remove plurality markers from English

2Specifically, let Et and Eng be word and n-gram em-
bedding matrices, and let tw and NGw be the word and the
set of all n-grams of lengths 1 to 5, for a given word w. The
final vector representation of w, ew, is given by ew = Et[t] +∑

ng∈NGw Eng[ng].
3The verb in Basque agrees with the indirect object as

well. In preliminary experiments, the recall of models trained
on indirect object prediction was very low, due to the small
number of indirect objects in the training corpus; we there-
fore do not include this task.

verbs before adding our suffixes (for example, by
replacing has with have).

Single Task Results The basic results are sum-
marized in Table 1. Recall is calculated as the pro-
portion of the sentences with a direct object for
which the model predicted either SINGULAR or
PLURAL, but not NONE. Since all verbs included
in the experiment had a subject, subject recall was
100% and is therefore not reported.

Plurality prediction accuracy was higher for
subjects than objects. Recall for object predic-
tion was 81.8%, indicating that in many sentences
the model was unable to identify the direct ob-
ject. The lower performance on object plurality
prediction is likely to be due to the fact that only
about third of the sentences contain a direct ob-
ject. This hypothesis is supported by the results of
a preliminary experiment, in which the model was
trained only on transitive sentences (with a direct
object). Transitive-only training led to a reversal
of the pattern: object plurality was predicted with
higher accuracy than subject plurality. We conjec-
ture that this is due to the fact that most noun mod-
ifiers in English follow the head, making the head
of the object, which in general determines the plu-
rality of the phrase, closer on average to the verb
than the head of the subject (see Table 3 below).

The accuracy we report for subject prediction,
94.7%, is lower than the accuracy of over 99% re-
ported by Linzen et al. (2016). This may be due
to one of several reasons. First, our training set
was smaller: ∼35,000 sentences in our treebank
corpus compared to ∼121,000 in their automati-
cally parsed corpus. Second, sentences in the Wall
Street Journal corpus may be more syntactically
complex on average than sentences in Wikipedia,
making it more challenging to identify the verb’s
arguments. Finally, we predicted agreement in all
tenses, whereas Linzen et al. (2016) limited their
study to the present tense (where English does in
fact show agreement); it may be the case that sen-
tences with past tense verbs are on average more
complex than those with present tense verbs, re-
gardless of the corpus.

Multitask Training Accuracy was higher in the
joint setting: polypersonal agreement prediction
is easier for the model. Subject prediction accu-
racy rose from 94.7% to 95.7%, object precision
was slightly higher (90.0% compared to 88.9%),
and object recall was significantly higher, increas-

ing from 81.8% to 85.4%. We hypothesize that
supervision signals from the prediction of both
arguments lead to more robust abstract syntactic
representations that transfer across the two tasks
(Enguehard et al., 2017); for example, the model
may be better able to identify the head of a noun
phrase, regardless of whether it is the subject or
the object. These findings suggest that when train-
ing on an auxiliary agreement prediction task in
order to improve a language model’s syntactic per-
formance, additional supervision—in the form of
predicting both subject and object—may be bene-
ficial.

4 Order of Core Elements

Languages vary in the typical order of the core
elements of a clause: the subject, the object and
the verb (Dryer, 2013). For example, whereas
in English the canonical order is Subject-Verb-
Object (SVO, The priests are reading the book), in
Irish it is Verb-Subject-Object (VSO, Dillon and
Ó Cróinin 1961):

(5) Léann
read.PRES

[na
the.PL

sagairt]
priest.PL

[na
the.PL

leabhair].
book.PL

‘The priests are reading the books.’

While there are six possible orderings of these
three elements, in most human languages the
subject precedes both the object and the verb:
about 86.5% of the languages use either SOV or
SVO orders, 9% of the languages use VOS order,
and OVS and OSV languages are extremely rare
(Tomlin, 1986).

To test whether RNNs have inductive biases fa-
voring certain word orders over others, we created
synthetic versions of English with all six possible
orders of core elements. While natural languages
often allow at least a limited degree of word or-
der flexibility, our experiments used a simplified
setting in which word order was either completely
fixed (e.g., always SVO) or fully flexible, where
one of the six orders was selected uniformly at
random for each sentence in the corpus (the same
order is used for all of the clauses of the sentence).

4.1 Corpus Creation

Given a dependency parse for a sentence, we mod-
ulated the order of the subject and object nodes
with respect to their verb. When changing the po-
sition of an argument node, we moved the entire
subtree rooted in that node, including verbs and



3536

other arguments in this subtree. In the permutation
process, we moved to the subject position not only
nominal subjects (nsubj and nsubjpass edges in
UD), but also clausal subjects (csubj edges). Sim-
ilarly, we moved to the object position not only
nominal objects (dobj edge), but also clausal com-
plements (ccomp and xcomp).

We kept negations, adverbial modifiers, parti-
cles and auxiliaries in their original position with
respect to the verb. Other non-core dependents of
the verb (i.e. not the subject or the object), such
as prepositional phrases, were placed according
to their original position relative to the verb. For
instance, in the clause the broker took them out
for lunch, the phrase for lunch appeared directly
following the verb and the arguments of the sub-
tree in which it resides (took, them, the broker)
in all word orders, reflecting its original position
relative to the verb took (see Figure 1). Relative
pronouns and complementizers remained in their
original position.4

In all experiments in this section, we trained the
model to jointly predict the plurality of the sub-
ject and the object. For consistency across the ob-
ject and subject plurality prediction tasks, we used
the polypersonal agreement markers on all verbs
in the sentence (except, of course, for the predic-
tion target, which was withheld completely). For
example, in the OVS version of the sentence pre-
sented in Figure 1, the input was (6), where kon
marks the fact that say has a plural subject:

(6) them 〈verb〉 out frequently the broker for
lunch saykon they .

4.2 Results

Performance varied significantly across word or-
ders (Table 3). Subject plurality prediction accu-
racy was inversely correlated with the frequency
of attractors (intervening nouns of the opposite
plurality) in the language: accuracy was lowest for
subject prediction in the VOS and SOV languages,
in which objects intervene between the subject
and the verb (Figure 2). The degraded perfor-
mance in these languages is consistent with the at-
traction effects found in previous studies of agree-

order was (ii) rather than (iii):

ment in natural languages (Linzen et al., 2016;
Gulordava et al., 2018), and support the hypothe-
sis that RNNs have an inductive bias favoring de-
pendencies with recent elements; we test this hy-
pothesis in a more controlled way in §4.3.

racy as a function of the percentage of sentences with
attractors that are arguments of the verb. Red circles
represent subject prediction and blue triangles repre-
sent object prediction. R2: 0.61 for subject, 0.43 for
object.

Attractors affected object prediction accuracy
as well. The highest accuracy among the synthetic
languages was in the SVO language and the worst
performance observed in the OSV language. As
in §3, subjects were easier to predict than objects,
likely because all verbs in the training set had a
subject, but only 35% had an object.

Flexible word order was especially challenging
for the model, with a subject plurality prediction
accuracy of 88.6%, object plurality prediction ac-
curacy of 74.1%, and object recall of 60.2%. This
does not necessarily bear on the RNNs’ inductive
biases: flexible word order without case marking
would make it difficult for any learner to infer syn-
tactic relations. Without overt cues, the model
must resort to selectional restrictions (e.g., in the
apples ate the man, the only plausible subject is
the man), but those are difficult to learn from a
small corpus. What’s more, some sentences are
truly ambiguous when there are no case mark-
ers or word order cues; this happens for example
when both arguments are animate, as in the lawyer
saw the doctor (Gibson et al., 2013; Ettinger et al.,
2018).

4.3 Withholding Direct Objects in Training
The previous experiments suggested that the RNN
has a tendency to identify the more recent argu-
ment as the subject, leading to attraction effects

caused by the object. We conjectured that this
is due to the fact that many verbs are intransi-
tive, that is, have a subject but not an object. The
clauses in which those verbs appear provide am-
biguous evidence: they are equally compatible
with a generalization in which the subject is the
most recent core element before the verb, and with
a generalization in which the subject is the first
core constituent of the clause. Attraction effects
suggest that the inductive bias of the RNN leads
it to adopt the incorrect recency-based generaliza-
tion. To test this hypothesis in a controlled way,
we adopt the “poverty of the stimulus” paradigm
(Wilson, 2006; Culbertson and Adger, 2014; Mc-
Coy et al., 2018): we withhold all evidence that
disambiguates these two hypotheses (namely, all
transitive sentences), and test how the RNN gen-
eralizes to the withheld sentence type.

We used the SOV and VOS corpora described
before; in both of these languages, the object in-
tervened between the subject and the verb, poten-
tially causing agreement attraction. Crucially, we
train only on sentences without a direct object, and
test on the following three types of sentences:

1. Sentences with an object of the opposite plu-
rality from the subject (object attractor).

2. Sentences with an object of the same plural-
ity as the subject (non-attractor object).5

3. Sentences without an object, but with one
or more nouns of the opposite plurality in-

5When the object is a noun-noun compound, it is consid-
ered a non-attractor if its head is not of the opposite plurality
of the subject, regardless of the plurality of other elements.
This can only make the task harder compared with the al-
ternative of considering compound objects such as “screen
displays” as attractors for plural subjects.

tervening between the subject and the verb
(non-object attractor); e.g., The gap between
winners and losers will grow is intransi-
tive, but the plural words winners and losers,
which are a part of a modifier of the subject,
may serve as attractors for the singular sub-
ject gap.

The results are shown in Table 4. Withholding di-
rect objects during training dramatically degraded
the performance of the model on sentences with
an object attractor: the accuracy decreased from
90.6% for the model trained on the full SOV cor-
pus (Table 3) to 60.0% for the model trained only
on intransitive sentences from the same corpus.
There was an analogous drop in performance in
the case of VOS (89.5% compared to 48.3%). By
contrast, attractors that were not core arguments,
or objects that were not attractors, did not hurt
performance in a comparable way. This suggests
that in our poverty of the stimulus experiments
RNNs were able to distinguish between core and
non-core elements, but struggled on instances in
which where the object directly preceded the verb
(the instances that were withheld in training). This
constitutes strong evidence for the RNN’s recency
bias: our models extracted the generalization that
subjects directly precede the verb, even though the
data were equally compatible with the generaliza-
tion that the subject is the first core argument in
the clause.

These findings align with the results of Khan-
delwal et al. (2018), who demonstrated that RNN
language models are more sensitive to perturba-
tions in recent input words compared with pertur-
bations to more distant parts of the input. While
in their case the model’s recency preference can

be a learned property (since recent information is
more relevant for the task of next-word predic-
tion), our experiment focuses on the inherent in-
ductive biases of the model, as the cues that are
necessary for differentiating between the two gen-
eralizations were absent in training.

4.4 Discussion

Our reordering manipulation was limited to core
element (subjects, objects and verbs). Languages
also differ in word order inside other types of
phrases, including noun phrases (e.g., does an
adjective precede or follow the noun?), adposi-
tional phrases (does the language use prepositions
or postpositions?), and so on. Greenberg (1963)
pointed out correlations between head-modifier
orders across phrase categories; while a signifi-
cant number of exceptions exist, these correlations
have motivated proposals for a language-wide set-
ting of a Head Directionality Parameter (Stowell,
1981; Baker, 2001). In future work, we would like
to explore whether consistent reordering across
categories improves the model’s performance.

In practice, even languages with a relatively
rigid word order almost never enforce this order
in every clause. The order of elements in English,
for example, is predominately SVO, but construc-
tions in which the verb precedes the subject do ex-
ist, e.g., Outside were three police officers. Other
languages are considerably more flexible than En-
glish (Dryer, 2013). Given that word order flexi-
bility makes the task more difficult, our setting is
arguably simpler than the task the model would
face when learning a natural language.

The fact that the agreement dependency be-
tween the subject and the verb was more challeng-
ing to establish in the SOV order compared to the
SVO order is consistent with the hypothesis that
SVO languages make it easier to distinguish the
subject from the object (Gibson et al., 2013); in-

deed, to compensate for this issue, SOV languages
more frequently employ case marking (Matthew
Dryer, quoted in Gibson et al. 2013).

There was not a clear relationship between the
prevalence of a particular word order in the lan-
guages of the world and the difficulty that our
models experienced with that order. The model
performed best on the OVS word order, which
is present in a very small number of languages
(∼1%). SOV languages were more difficult for
our RNNs to learn than SVO languages, even
though SOV languages are somewhat more com-
mon (Dryer, 2013). These results weakly support
functional explanations of these typological ten-
dencies; such explanations appeal to communica-
tive efficiency considerations rather than learning
biases (Maurits et al., 2010). Of course, since the
inductive biases of humans and RNNs are likely
to be different in many respects, our results do
not rule out the possibility that the distribution of
word orders is driven by a human learning bias af-
ter all.

5 Overt Morphological Case Systems

The vast majority of noun phrases in English
are not overtly marked for grammatical function
(case), with the exception of pronouns; e.g., the
first-person singular pronoun is I when it is a sub-
ject and me when it is an object. Other languages
mark case on most nouns. Consider, for example,
the following example from Russian:6

(7) a. ya
I

kupil
bought

knig-u.
book-OBJECT

‘I bought the book.’
b. knig-a

book-SUBJECT
ischezla.
disappeared

‘The book disappeared.’

Overt case marking reduces ambiguity and facil-
itates parsing languages with flexible word or-
der. To investigate the influence of case on agree-
ment prediction—and on the ability to infer sen-
tence structure—we experimented with different
case systems. In all settings, we used “fused” suf-
fixes, which encode both plurality and grammat-
ical function. We considered three case systems
(see Figure 1):

JECT and OBJECT for clarity.

suffix for each combination of number and
grammatical function.

2. A partially syncretic (ambiguous) case sys-
tem, in which the same suffix was attached
to both singular subjects and plural objects
(modeled after Basque).

3. A fully syncretic case system (argument
marking only): the suffix indicated only the
plurality of the argument, regardless of its
grammatical function (cf. subject/object syn-
cretism in Russian neuter nouns).

In the typological survey reported in Baerman and
Brown (2013), 62% of the languages had no or
minimal case marking, 20% had syncretic case
systems, and 18% had case systems with no syn-
cretism.

Corpus Creation The suffixes we used are
listed in Table 2. We only attached the suffix to
the head of the relevant argument; adjectives and
other modifiers did not carry case suffixes. The
same suffix was used to mark plurality/case on
noun and the agreement features on the verb; e.g.,
if the verb eat had a singular subject and plural
object, it appeared as eatkarker (the singular sub-
ject suffix was kar and the plural object suffix was
ker). We stripped off plurality and case mark-
ers from the original English noun phrases before
adding these suffixes.

Setup We evaluated the interaction between dif-
ferent case marking schemes and three word or-
ders: flexible word order and the two orders on
which the model achieved the best (OVS) and
worst (VOS) subject prediction accuracy. We train
one model for each combination of case system
and word order. We jointly predicted the plurality
of subject and the object.

Results and Analysis The results are summa-
rized in Table 5. Unambiguous case marking
dramatically improved subject and object plural-
ity prediction compared with the previous experi-
ments; accuracy was above 98% for all three word
orders. Partial syncretism hurt performance some-
what relative to the unambiguous setting (except
with flexible word order), especially for object
prediction. The fully syncretic case system, which
marked only the plurality of the head of each argu-
ment, further decreased performance. At the same
time, even this limited marking scheme was help-
ful: accuracy in the most challenging setting, flex-
ible word order (subject: 96.0%; object: 86.1%),
was not very different from the results on unmod-
ified English (95.7% and 90.0%). This contrasts
with the poor results on the flexible setting with-
out cases (subject: 88.6%; object: 60.2%). On the
rigid orders, a fully syncretic system still signifi-
cantly improved agreement prediction. The mod-
erate effect of case syncretism on performance
suggests that most of the benefits of case mark-
ing stems from the overt marking of the heads of
all arguments.

Overall, these results are consistent with the ob-
servation that languages with explicit case mark-
ing tend to allow a more flexible word orders com-
pared with languages such as English that make
use of word order to express grammatical function
of words.

6 Related Work

Our approach of constructing synthetic languages
by parametrically modifying parsed corpora for
natural languages is closely inspired by Wang and
Eisner (2016) (see also Wang and Eisner 2017).
While they trained a model to mimic the POS tags
order-statistics of the target language, we manu-
ally modified the parsed corpora; this allows us to



3540

control for selected parameters, at the expense of
reducing generality.

Simpler synthetic languages (not based on nat-
ural corpora) have been used in a number of recent
studies to examine the inductive biases of different
neural architectures (Bowman et al., 2015; Lake
and Baroni, 2018; McCoy et al., 2018). In an-
other recent study, Cotterell et al. (2018) measured
the ability of RNN and n-gram models to perform
character-level language modeling in a sample of
languages, using a parallel corpus; the main ty-
pological property of interest in that study was
morphological complexity. Finally, a large num-
ber of studies, some mentioned in the introduc-
tion, have used syntactic prediction tasks to exam-
ine the generalizations acquired by neural models
(see also Bernardy and Lappin 2017; Futrell et al.
2018; Lau et al. 2017; Conneau et al. 2018; Et-
tinger et al. 2018; Jumelet and Hupkes 2018).

7 Conclusions

We have proposed a methodology for generating
parametric variations of existing languages and
evaluating the performance of RNNs in syntactic
feature prediction in the resulting languages. We
used this methodology to study the grammatical
inductive biases of RNNs, assessed whether cer-
tain grammatical phenomena are more challeng-
ing for RNNs to learn than others, and began to
compare these patterns with the linguistic typol-
ogy literature.

In our experiments, multitask training on
polypersonal agreement prediction improved per-
formance, suggesting that the models acquired
syntactic representations that generalize across
argument types (subjects and objects). Perfor-
mance varied significantly across word orders.
This variation was not correlated with the fre-
quency of the word orders in the languages of the
world. Instead, it was inversely correlated with the
frequency of attractors, demonstrating a recency
bias. Further supporting this bias, in a poverty-
of -the-stimulus paradigm, where the data were
equally consistent with two generalizations—first,
the generalization that the subject is the first ar-
gument in the clause, and second, the generaliza-
tion that the subject is the most recent argument
preceding the verb—RNNs adopted the recency-
based generalization. Finally, we found that overt
case marking on the heads of arguments dramat-
ically improved plurality prediction performance,

even when the case system was highly syncretic.
Agreement feature prediction in some of our

synthetic languages is likely to be difficult not
only for RNNs but for many other classes of learn-
ers, including humans. For example, agreement
in a language with very flexible word order and
without case marking is impossible to predict in
many cases (see §4.2), and indeed such languages
are very rare. In future work, a human experiment
based on the agreement prediction task can help
determine whether the difficulty of our languages
is consistent across humans and RNNs.
