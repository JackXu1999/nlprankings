ABSTRACT
The Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration (NeIC) is a distributed organization of IT-experts
working at various national HPC centers throughout the Nordic region. The mission of NeIC
is to facilitate the development of high-quality e-Infrastructure solutions in areas of joint
Nordic interest. It is owned by the research councils and national e-Infrastructure provider
organisations from Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden. NeIC is hosted by
NordForsk in Oslo. Current collaboration areas include high-energy physics (CERN-related)
and life sciences. A call for Letters of Interest in 2012 elicited several opportunities within
the humanities, including fields such as computational analysis of language and semantic
annotation. This presentation will give an overview of the NeIC and its modus operandi, and
aims to provide a basis for discussions at NoDaLiDa on how NeIC may be put into use as a
vehicle for facilitating development of common e-Infrastructure services for linguistics and
related fields.
