ABSTRACT 

During last two decades, most of the named entity (NE) machine transliteration work in 
India has been carried out by using English as a source language and Indian languages 
as the target languages using grapheme model with statistical probability approaches 
and classification tools. It is evident that less amount of work has been carried out for 
Indian languages to English machine transliteration.  

This paper focuses on the specific problem of machine transliteration of Hindi to English 
and Marathi to English which are previously less studied language pairs using a phonetic 
based direct approach without training any bilingual database. Our study shows that in 
depth knowledge of word formation in Devanagari script based languages can provide 
better results as compared to statistical approaches. Proposed phonetic based model 
transliterates Indian-origin named entities into English using full consonant approach 
and uses hybrid (rule based and metric based) stress analysis approach for schwa 
deletion.

1. Introduction 

Hindi is the official national language of the India and spoken by around 500 million 
Indians. Hindi is the world’s fourth most commonly used language after Chinese, 
English and Spanish. Marathi is one of the widely spoken languages in India especially 
in the state of Maharashtra. Hindi and Marathi languages are derived from the Sanskrit 
and use the “Devanagari” script for writing. It is challenging to transliterate out of 
vocabulary words like names and technical terms occurring in the user input across 
languages with different alphabets and sound inventories. Transliteration is the 
conversion of a word from one language to another without losing its phonological 
characteristics (Padariya 2008). Hindi and Marathi to English NE transliteration is quite 
difficult due to  many factors such as difference in writing script, difference in number of 
alphabets, capitalization of leading characters, phonetic characteristics, character length, 
number of valid transliterations and availability of the parallel corpus (Saha 2008).

The architecture of Hindi/Marathi to English transliteration system and its functional 
modules are shown in figure 1.

3. Phonetic Map for Hindi/Marathi to English 

The possibility of different scripts between source and target languages is the problem 
that transliteration systems need to tackle. Hindi and Marathi use the Devanagari script 
whereas English uses the Roman script. Devanagari script used for Hindi and Marathi 
have 12 pure vowels, two additional loan vowels taken from the Sanskrit and one loan 
vowel from English. English has only five pure vowels but, the vowel sound is also 
associated with the consonants w and y (Koul 2008). There are 34 pure consonants, 5 
traditional conjuncts, 7 loan consonants and 2 traditional signs in Devanagari script and 
each consonant have 14 variations through integration of 14 vowels while in Roman 
script there are only 21 consonants (Walambe 1990, Mudur 1999). Table 1 shows 
phonetic map for Devanagari to Roman transliteration along with their phonological 
mapping using full consonant approach. It is fully based on the National Library of 

112



Kolkata and ITRANS of IIT Madras, India (Unicode 2007). The consonant /ळ/ is used 
only in Marathi language.

4. Syllabification 

Unicode encoded Hindi or Marathi named entity text input is given to the syllabification 
module which separates the input named entity into syllabic units. A syllabic unit is 
equivalent to one ’akshara’ in Devanagari where ‘akshara’ is the minimal articulatory 
unit of speech in Hindi and Marathi. Few examples are  

कैलाशनाथ � कै | ला | श | ना | थ   and   िवजयराघवगढ़ � िव | ज | य | रा | घ | व | ग | ढ़ 

5. Transliteration Module 

This module converts each syllabic unit in Devanagari into English by using phonetic 
map. Phonetic map is implemented by using the translation memory and mapping is 
done by writing the manual rules. It is to note that the first vowel /अअअअ/ in Hindi/Marathi 
is mapped to English letter ‘a’ (short vowel) while the second vowel /आआआआ/ is mapped to ‘ā’ 
(long vowel as per IPA) in English.  The alphabet ‘a’ in English is a short vowel 
equivalent to /अअअअ/ which is also a short vowel in Devanagari while /आआआआ/ in Devanagari is a 
long vowel and mapped capital ‘ā’ or ‘A’ in our phonetic scheme. Unicode and ISCII 
character encoding standards for Indic scripts are based on full form of consonants 
(Singh 2006, BIS 1991). Few examples are

Table 2. Output of Transliteration Module 

Schwa - The schwa is the vowel sound in many lightly pronounced unaccented syllables 
in words of more than one syllable. It is represented by /ə/ symbol (Naim 2009). The 
schwas remained in the transliterated output need to be deleted (Pandey 1990). The 

113



schwa identification and deletion is done by applying the manual rules and stress 
analysis. Instead of using either approach, it is better to combine both the approaches 
due to phonotactic constraints of Hindi and Marathi languages.  

6. Rules for Schwa Retention and Deletion  

From empirical observations the following six rules are applicable to all NEs (Choudhury 
2004). 

Rule 1: The schwa which occurs in isolation at the start of named entity never gets 
deleted. Example: amar (अमर, əmər) → [əəəə] : [mər]  

Rule 2: The schwa preceding a full vowel never gets deleted to maintain lexical 
distinctions. Example: pawai (पवई, pəwəəəəī) → [pə] : [wəəəə] : [i]    

Rule 3: The schwa which occurs in the first syllable never gets deleted if it is a consonant 
phoneme without any matra. 

Rule 4: The schwa which occurs at the end of word always gets deleted. Example: gopal 
(गोपाल, gopAləəəə) → [go]:[pa] :[ləəəə] 

Rule 5: If the word ends in a consonant cluster or the rafar diacritic, then the schwa is 
retained.  Example: atharva (अथव, əthərvəəəə) → [ə]:[thərvəəəə] 

Rule 6: The schwa of the syllable immediately followed by a conjugate syllable should 
always be retained. Example: brahaspati ( ह पती, brahəəəəspəti → [bra]:[həəəə]:[spa]:[ti] 

7. Schwa Deletion Using Stress Analysis 

Generally, the location of word stress in Hindi and Marathi is predictable on the basis of 
syllable stress. Stress is related both to the vowel length and the occurrence of 
postvocalic consonant. According to Hindi and Marathi phonology literature there are 
three classes of vowels used for stress analysis but it is possible to obtain the stress 
analysis using only two classes as shown below. 

Class- I: Short vowels /a or ə/, /u/ and /i/ denoted by L (Light) 

Class-II: Long vowels /ā/,/e/,/ī/,/o/,/ū/,/ai/, /au/ denoted by H (Heavy) 

Algorithm 1: Schwa Deletion Using Stress Analysis 

If last position has schwa then 

          If last syllabic unit does not contains consonant cluster or the rafar diacritic then 

           delete word-final schwa and resyllabify  named entity  

 endif 

 endif 

 foreach syllabic unit in English do . assign metrical class ( L or H) end foreach 

 foreach syllabic unit and next syllabic unit do  create metrical feet if any end foreach 

 foreach  foot  do  find unstressed foot  

          if the contexts of rule 1 to 4 from manual rules does not occur then 

114



             delete schwa(s) in unstressed  foot   and  resyllabify  foot 

         endif 

 end foreach 

The process of combining syllables is carried out from right to left as schwa always 
appears to the right position (Naim 2009). With syllable stress and metrical feet, it is 
possible to find which syllable receives primary lexical stress. The stress information is 
used to decide whether the schwa is an unstressed syllable and to delete all such 
unstressed schwas. Few examples are shown in table 3.

8. Demonstration 

We have developed real time application for a co-operative banking which allows user to 
enter data in Marathi or Hindi language and transliterate it into English. Figure 2 shows 
the snapshot from our experimentation for full name transliteration in English. 

 
Figure 2. Transliteration Using Phonology and Stress Analysis 

As there are more number of alphabets in Devanagari as compared to English, one 
alphabet in Devanagari can be mapped to multiple alphabets in English depending on 

115



the origin of word. Transliteration module maps the highest priority alphabet to 
generate the first candidate named entity. Table 4 is used to generate multiple 
transliteration candidates (Chinnakotla 2010).

Figure 3 shows the snapshot from our experimentation for personal profile of the bank 
account holder. It allows user to enter information in Marathi language and shows the 
corresponding transliterated record in English.

Conclusion 

The use of machine transliteration in cross language applications is imminent and 
promising. Hindi and Marathi can be supported in all e-governance projects of the 
Government of India. As there is no need of bi-lingual and multilingual databases to be 
trained, this application can easily be ported on mobile devices. This application can 
help masses of India who do not know English.
