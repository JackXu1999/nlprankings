ABSTRACT
In this paper, we present a Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) based approach to the
classification of emotion in short texts. We develop a method that makes use of the notion
put forward by Ortony et al. (1988), that emotions are valenced reactions. This hypothesis
sits central to our system, in which we adapt contextual valence shifters to infer the emotional
content of a text. We integrate this with an augmented version of WordNet-Affect, which acts as
our lexicon. Finally, we experiment with a corpus of headlines proposed in the 2007 SemEval
Affective Task (Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2007), and by taking the other competing systems as
a baseline, demonstrate that our approach to emotion categorisation performs favourably.

KEYWORDS: sentiment analysis, emotion classification, combinatory categorial grammar,

1 Introduction

Text, no matter the length, can potentially convey an emotional meaning. As the availability
of digitized documents has increased over the past decade, so the ability and need to classify
this data by its affective content has increased. This in turn has generated a large amount of
interest in the field of Sentiment Analysis.

Typical approaches to Sentiment Analysis tend to focus on the binary classification problem
of valence: whether a text has a positive or negative sentiment associated with it. The task
of classifying text by its valence has been applied successfully across varying datasets, from
product reviews (Blitzer et al., 2007) and online debates (Mukherjee and Liu, 2012), even
spanning as far as the sentiment communicated through patient discourse (Smith and Lee,
2012). While numerous works concentrate on the binary-classification task, the next logical
task in sentiment analysis, emotion classification, can sometimes be overlooked, for numerous
reasons.

Emotion classification provides a more complex problem than the polarity based sentiment
analysis task. While both suffer from the subtleties that the implicit nature of language holds,
one of the central reasons for its complexity is that there are a greater number of categories,
emotions, in which to undertake classification. Additionally, there is no fixed number of
categories, as varying theories of emotion have been proposed, each detailing a slightly different
subset of emotions.

This paper will provide a general approach to emotion classification, which utilises the lexical
semantics of words and their combinations in order to classify a text. We will experiment
with our proposed method on the SemEval 2007 Affective Task, proposed by Strapparava and
Mihalcea (2007). The task offered an interesting challenge for sentiment analysis, as little data
was given for training, so supervised machine learning approaches that are common to text
classification on the whole, were discouraged. This therefore encouraged competing systems to
consider the syntax and semantics of language when crafting their approaches to classification.
The task was split into two tracks, one for traditional valence classification, and one for emotion
classification. Our system experiments with the latter track.

1.1 The SemEval Data Sets and Evaluation

The corpus that was compiled for the Affective Task consisted of general news headlines
obtained from websites such as Google News and CNN. Whilst a corpus of headlines is not
typical for sentiment analysis, this domain was chosen for the task in hand due to the salience
of the emotions that are conveyed through the use of only a few thought provoking words. It is
usual for sentiment analysis to be carried out on large document sets, where documents may
consist of numerous paragraphs, but in the case of this task, sentiment analysis focused on the
sentence level.

The headlines provided in the corpus were annotated by six independent annotators. Six
different emotions that correspond with those proposed in Ekman (1982) were used as the
category labels. These six emotions were anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness and surprise. For each
emotional category, the headline was annotated on a fine-grained scale between 0 and 100,
dependent upon how strongly an annotator felt that a particular emotion was expressed. For
the coarse-grained evaluations of systems, each emotion was mapped to a 0/1 classification,
where 0=[0,50] and 1=[50,100].

The dataset that was released consisted of two sections, a trial set and a test set. The trial set,
consisted of 250 headlines, and the test set, used for evaluating the systems consisted of 1,000
annotated headlines.

1.2 Outline of Our Approach

A central part of our approach to emotion classification was the use of an appropriate lexi-
con. Whilst a number of lexica for sentiment analysis exist such as SentiWordNet (Esuli and
Sebastiani, 2006) and AFINN (Hansen et al., 2011), as is the case with most approaches to
sentiment analysis, valence is focused on, and emotions unfortunately are not considered.
Therefore, in our approach to emotion classification, we use the optional lexicon of emotion
bearing unigrams, WordNet-Affect, provided by the task organisers. This lexicon presents a
mapping from emotional terms to the relevant emotional categories that were used to annotate
the headlines in the affective task.

The WordNet-Affect dictionary alone would not suffice in a classification task from a specific
genre of texts, namely headlines. WordNet-Affect contains hypernymic words associated with
basic emotional concepts, but does not contain some of the more general emotion causing
lexical items that are associated with headlines, such as war. Due to this, expansion of the
lexicon with further emotion-bearing concepts was required.

Alongside the expansion of the lexicon, another occurrence in sentences needed to be taken
into account: contextual valence shifters. For example, consider the sentence from the trial data
set ’Budapest calm after night of violent protests’. A basic bag-of-words approach to this may view
the words (violent, protests) as fear, anger or sadness, whereas the only word that suggests joy
is (calm). With a uniform scoring system in place, this headline would be incorrectly classified.

To overcome this short-coming in bag-of-words approaches to classification, sentence level
valence shifters (Polanyi and Zaenen, 2006) are implemented. These influential lexical items
act by altering the valence of words around them. The combination of calm after suggests a
change in valence of the sentence, and so the phrase night of violent protests is shifted from a
negative to positive valence.

To apply this valence shifting technology to emotion classification, we must build upon the
hypothesis proposed by Ortony et al. (1988) that emotions are rooted with either a positive
or negative valence, and that most words have the capability to shift valence under certain
contexts. In the case of this task, we assume only joy to be associated with a positive valence,
and the emotions of anger, fear, disgust, sadness and surprise stem from a negative valence. In
doing this, we are able to make fine-grained emotional classifications on the headlines.

In order to implement the contextual valence shifters, a relevant parser was required that
could capture adequately the functionality of valence shifting lexical entities. The Categorial
Combinatory Grammar (Steedman, 2000) takes advantage of the surface syntax as an interface
to the underlying compositional semantics of a language, and therefore is suitable for discovering
valence shifting terms. To intergrate the CCG formalism into our system, Clark and Curran’s
(Clark and Curran, 2004) implementation of the parser was used.

2 Resources

To develop our system three main elements were integrated to tackle the problem of emotion
classification:

• A lexicon of emotion bearing unigrams - an augmented version of WordNet-Affect
• Contextual Valence Shifters
• A Combinatory Categorial Grammar parser

These will further be described below.

2.1 WordNet-Affect

WordNet-Affect (Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004) is a lexical resource developed by extending
WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) with affective domain labels in order to produce a lexicon capable
of associating affective concepts with affective words. To achieve this, WordNet-Affect (WN-A)
introduces a hierarchy of affective labels whereby the included synsets are considered due to
the affective concepts associated with them. This hierarchical emotional structure is modelled
upon the hypernymic relations of WordNet. The affective domain labels (a-labels) consist of
a number of concepts associated with affect, which include aspects such as emotion, mood,
attitude and cognitive state. For the SemEval Affective Task, a subset of WN-A was released that
specifically related to the six emotion categories that were used. An overview of this is given in
the following table.

Nouns Verbs Adjectives Adverbs
Anger 99 64 119 35

Disgust 6 22 34 10
Fear 43 65 96 26
Joy 149 122 203 65

Sadness 64 25 169 43
Surprise 8 28 41 13

Table 1: WordNet-Affect word counts

2.2 Contextual Valence Shifters

A prevalent aspect of language is that the lexical choice of the writer is salient in conveying
attitude. However, as Polanyi and Zaenen (2006) point out, the base valence of a lexical item
is often modified by the polarity of its neighbouring terms, and this is something that is often
overlooked in the sentiment analysis literature. For example, in the phrase ‘she is not happy’, the
use of the word not shifts the valence of the term happy from a positive valence to a negative
one.

However, whilst the valence may shift polarity, the same cannot be said for the emotion in
the example phrase. An assumption is to uniformly shift an emotion to its presumed opposite
emotion, in this case, sadness. There lies a problem with this though, as ‘she is not happy’ is not
equivalent to ‘she is sad’. A number of different emotions that are negatively valenced, such
as anger, could be inferred from the original example sentence. Due to this, the use of the

6



hypothesis put forward by Ortony et al. (1988) is key in determining an overall shift in emotion
within a phrase or sentence.

Lexical items such as "very" and not" can be used under a variety of emotional settings, but
their main role is to contribute to the strength of the resulting emotion or emotions that are
conveyed within a sentence.

2.3 Combinatory Categorial Grammar

Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) (Steedman, 2000) is a popular grammar formalism
that builds upon combinatory logic in order to undertake efficient natural language parsing.
The formalism is based upon the notion that in natural language the surface syntax acts as an
interface to the underlying compositional semantics of a language.

CCGs map lexical elements of a sentence, such as nouns and adjectives, to a syntactic category.
In addition to these mappings, the CCG formalism also offers a variety of combinatory rules,
such as coordination and type-raising, that specify how constituent categories can be combined
into larger chunks in order to provide a suitable parse for a sentence, or fragment of a sentence.

The CCG formalism provides two types of syntactic category: primitive and complex. The
primitive category is recursively defined as the set of terms that include basic categories such as
V (verb), VP (verb phrase), S (sentence) and so on. Complex categories act as functions within
the grammar, and are compounds of the primitive categories. They typically take the form
A/B or A\B, where A and B are primitive categories. In this notation, the argument appears
to the right on the slash, and the resulting category appears to the left of the slash. So, in the
previous example, B is the argument given to the function, and A is the resulting category. The
directionality of the slash indicates which side of the functor the argument must appear on. A
forward slash indicates that the argument must appear to the right of the given constituent,
while a backslash indicates that it must appear to the left. The following example shows how
constituents combine in order to give a full parse of the sentence ‘Female astronaut sets new
record ’:

Female astronaut sets new record

N/N N (S\NP)/NP N/N N
> >

N N
NP NP

>
S\NP

<
S

This example exhibits the Subject-Verb-Object construction typical of English. Here we see
the verb acting as a function between the subject and object, and uses the following rule: (S
\NP)/NP. To evaluate this, a given noun phrase should exist to the right of the function (in
this case the verb) to produce the function (S \NP). This then evaluates to give a sentence
when a noun phrase exists to its left. If we take the phrase ’new record’, the adjective new
has the complex type N/N, which merely acts as a recursive function. These compositional
functions enable the valence shifters described in the previous subsection to be integrated into
our approach to emotion classification.

The derivation can be described with the following semantic structure:

7



Female astronaut sets new record

λx.female(x) astronaut λx.λy.sets(x)(y) λx.new(x) record

female(astronaut) new(record)

λy.set(new(record))(y)

sets(new(record))(female(astronaut))

3 The System

Our system integrates four modules to tackle the problem of emotion classification. These are:
an augmented version of WN-A, which takes into account emotion bearing concepts which
may have been present in headlines at the time of the task, a text-normalization unit, a CCG
parser (Clark and Curran, 2004), and a lexical lookup module, dependent on the output of the
contextual valence shifters, which is used to determine whether an emotional term appears
in the valence-classified headline. The valence shifters that we used were adapted versions of
those presented in (Simančík and Lee, 2009) and Polanyi and Zaenen (2006).

3.1 Extension of WordNet-Affect

Emotion Associated Concepts
Anger seize, war, bomb, sanction, attack

Disgust porn, kidnap, desecrate, violence
Fear Iraq, Gaza, cancer, massacre, terror, Al Qaeda
Joy win, fun, pleasure, celebrate

Sadness misfortune, cancel, kill, widow
Surprise realise, discover, shock

Table 2: Some emotion concept words
The version of WordNet-Affect (WN-A) provided by the Affective Task organisers contained a
set of emotion-bearing unigrams associated with the six relevant categories of the headline
corpus. The terms included in this lexicon are general terms for describing an emotion, and
would be useful in cross-domain classification, where the communication of emotion in text is
explicit. Strapparava et al. (2006) would describe these terms in the lexicon as direct affective
words. Nevertheless, the corpus involved contained headlines, which were mostly less than ten
words in length, and contained few of the explicit emotion-bearing terms. Due to the implicit
nature of emotional expression in the headlines, it became clear through a qualitative analysis
of the training set that emotions were being associated with specific concepts and events that
were the subject of the headlines.

We compiled a list of emotion bearing concepts based upon the training set and related ideas,
that we believed would be pertinent within the genre of news story headlines for the period of
time when the corpus was compiled, 2007. Table 2 outlines some of the lexical items that we
initially compiled.

In order to augment these initial concepts we used WordNet 3.0 (Fellbaum, 1998). For the
adjectives we explored and added any unique terms discovered via the similar to links, which
helped maintain the original meaning of our set of seeds. For the nouns and verbs in the seed
set we explored the hyponymic links to extend our seed set.

Table 3: Results from our final system.
Table 3 shows the results from experimentation with our system on the test dataset, consisting
of 1,000 headlines. Over the six emotional categories, our system achieved an average accuracy
of 93.35%, an increase of 3.92% over the previous best system for the task, UPAR7 (Chaumartin,
2007). In the remaining coarse-grained metrics, our system also outperformed the previous
best system. Our system average for precision was 42.68% , an increase of 15.07% , and our
average recall value was 23.70% , also yielding a gain of 18.01% . Our resulting F1 measure
delivered an increase of 20.26% .

If we consider the results on the emotion categories themselves, our system also performed
favourably. In particular, the category of disgust performed well across all metrics, with a
resulting accuracy of 99.11% and an F1 score of 47.70% . This can be attributed to the
relatively small number of headlines labelled with the category of disgust in the test set (1.2%),
which seem to describe similar news stories (such as porn).

Sadness also yields good results. Whilst only achieving a recall value of 32.32% , the precision
sits at 57.15%, which is above the random baseline, even for a polarity based sentiment
classification task. Fear and joy also share high precision values, at 43.75% and 39.13%
respectively.

The classes of emotion that did not yield comparable results to the other emotional classes that
were categorised during experimentation were Anger and Surprise. Anger yielded the lowest
value of recall, at 10.53% and surprise the lowest precision score, at 20.83% .

5 Related Work
This section will highlight some of the systems for Sentiment Analysis that have been developed
specifically for use with the headline corpus.

5.1 Systems Developed for the Emotion Classification Task
Several systems participated in the SemEval Task 14 emotion classification task. UPAR 7,
a system developed by Chaumartin (2007), delivered the best performance on the emotion
classification task. UPAR7 utilised an enriched version of SentiWordNet (Esuli and Sebastiani,
2006) and WordNetAffect as the base lexica for the task. Alongside these resources, the Stanford
parser was used to identify salient head word structures in the headlines, and valence shifting
rules based on the work of Polanyi and Zaenen (2006) were additionally implemented. The
system bears a resemblance to our approach, and their final rule-based system yielded an
average accuracy of 89.43% over the six-emotions of the task.

The SWAT system, developed by Katz et al. (2007), expand their training set to include an
additional 1,000 headlines from the Associated Press. These were duly annotated by non-expert,
untrained annotators. Roget’s New Millennium Thesaurus is used to create an extensive word
to emotion mapping, and this is used as SWAT’s lexicon. The average accuracy achieved by the
system was 88.58%, and is ranked second out of the participating systems.

The final system to take part in the emotion classification task was the UA system, developed
by Kozareva et al. (2007). Their system approaches emotion classification by observing word-
frequency and co-occurrence counts within online documents. They base this on the hypothesis
that words which co-occur across a document-set annotated with a given emotion exhibit a
high probability of expressing a particular emotion. Kozareva et al. (2007) note that they do
not consider the impact of valence shifters in their work, and the shifting roles that adverbs and
adjectives perform, and this may possibly have affected their overall performance. The system
returns an average accuracy of 85.72% over the test set. Full results for the participating system
are shown in Table 4 .

Table 4: System results from the emotion classification task (Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2007)

5.1.1 Other systems utilising the Headline Corpus

A number of other systems developed for emotion classification post-competition also use the
headline corpus as a test set for their algorithms. Mohammad (2012) created six binary classi-
fiers for the emotions present in the headline corpus, and experimented with Logistic Regression

10



and Support Vector Machines approaches. As supervised learning methods require sufficient
data to perform adequately, the experiments deviated from the scope of the SemEval Affective
Task, which was to create an emotion classification system in an unsupervised environment.
The system performs well when the roles of training and test sets are swapped, but the role of
training set size in overall performance should be considered. Kirange and Deshmukh (2012)
also approach the task with a similar Support Vector Machines based system.

6 Discussion

In the following section we will discuss the following points in regards to our results:

• The effects of contextual valence shifters

• The inherent subjectivity associated with annotating emotions

• The role of surprise within the emotion classification spectrum

6.1 Effects of Contextual Valence Shifters

To discuss the effect that contextual valence shifters have on the task of emotion classification
of headlines, it will be worth comparing our system to a basic lexical matching system, with
no rules or stipulations, that uses the WordNet-Affect lexicon. The results of this are shown in
Table 5.

Accuracy Precision Recall F1
Anger 97.70 25.00 10.53 14.81

Disgust 98.67 0 0 0
Fear 91.22 52.00 14.61 22.81
Joy 82.42 11.96 10.37 11.11

Sadness 89.20 26.31 5.05 8.47
Surprise 94.90 13.33 5.00 7.27

Table 5: Results from using WN-A only

If we compare the accuracy scores, improvements are only slight. However, we must remember
that accuracy also takes into account false positives when calculating the overall results. If we
combine this with the fact that when removing annotation scores of lower than 50 to carry
out the coarse-grained evaluation of our system, then we discover that 66.5% of the headlines
are classed as emotionless in the test set, despite their salience in fact being minimal. Neutral
instances in sentiment classification always pose a problem, and we believe that our system
deals with these appropriately, as can be seen from the gains in precision and recall over a basic
lexical matching approach.

The attribute that we believe has given considerable strength to our method is the assumption
that emotions are valenced. We attribute the results in general to the integration of contextual
valence shifters to our system. The work of Simančík and Lee (2009) demonstrated the
effectiveness of contextual valence shifters on the task in hand, and by incorporating this
approach into our system, we believe that this produced the relevant increases in accuracy,
precision and recall.

11



Interestingly enough also, UPAR 7 (Chaumartin, 2007), the previously best performing system
on the emotion classification task, also utilised valence shifters in their work, which produced
favourable results in comparison to the other systems. What their system may have lacked
however, is the combination with a suitable grammar, such as CCG, in order to access the
compositional semantics of the headlines being classified.

6.2 Comparison with Inter-Annotator Agreement

The results from our system may compare favourably to other unsupervised systems proposed
for the task, but irrespective of this, our results are not exceptionally high. While this may make
the system appear weak, the difficulty with recognising emotions amongst humans must be
introduced, so as to give some context to the achievements of our system. Six annotators were
asked to annotate the dataset with the six proposed emotions, and the results of evaluating
these annotations using the Pearson correlation method are shown in Table 6.

As can be seen here, the levels of agreement do not go above 70%, and the emotion with the
highest agreement is Sadness, at an average level of 68.19% agreement. This highlights the
difficulties of annotating emotion, due to their highly subjective nature. This leads to varying
levels of disagreement amongst the annotators. One particular emotion which annotators
struggled to agree on is that of surprise.

Emotion Agreement Score
Anger 49.55

Disgust 44.51
Fear 63.81
Joy 59.91

Sadness 68.19
Surprise 36.07

Table 6: Inter-annotator agreement scores (Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2007)

6.3 The Element of Surprise

The one emotion which both our system and others that participated in the Affective Task
struggle to classify with satisfactory precision and recall is surprise. Despite outperforming
other systems, with ours achieving a precision of 20.83% and recall of 25.00% , these figures
are still relatively low in comparison with the other categories.

The inclusion of surprise as a category label in any corpus of emotion-bearing text is an
interesting choice, and is one which may be attributed to the work of Ekman (1982). This
category of surprise, however, sits in a different zone to the other emotions that are discussed
throughout the task. If we refer to the work of Ortony et al. (1988) once again, they struggle to
class surprise as an emotion, due to the inherently neutral nature which it can adopt. This facet
is mirrored in the headlines which were annotated as containing strong elements of surprise in
the headline corpus. Quite often, seemingly neutral lexical items in headlines such as discovery
flag that a headline conveys a form of surprise. This leads to difficulties in compiling a lexicon
of emotional terms related to surprise, as generally, explicit items will form the majority of this
lexicon. Careful consideration of the domain, and observing token terms that are not necessarily
emotion bearing, is what helped to produce the classification results for this category in our
system. Due to the inherent difficulties outlined with this particular category of emotion, further

12



corpus analysis of this phenomena is required, in particular focussing on the lexical entities
associated with this emotion across domains.

Conclusions

We have developed a system for the classification of emotions held in headlines, which yields
favourable classifications results in comparison with other similar systems. For the headlines in
2007 SemEval Affective Task emotion-labelled test set, our system produced higher accuracy,
precision and recall scores on average than the top performing systems. The integration of
the CCG parser to yield each headline’s underlying compositional semantics in combination
with the contextual valence shifters seems to be a very promising combination for automatic
emotion annotation in headlines. To improve the scores further, an in depth understanding of
the context of the domain could be integrated with the lexicon. The category of surprise also
requires further study, as the available literature seems limited, yet implementing a suitable
system could have positive effects on the study of automatic emotion classification. Supervised
approaches to emotion classification, such as the work of Mohammad (2012) yields fruitful
results, and if contextual valence shifters were integrated with this, it is believed that further
increases in classification precision and recall could be produced.

Our system highlights the importance of contextual valence shifting when approaching emotion
labelling. Through this work, and the successful work of others (Chaumartin, 2007; Polanyi
and Zaenen, 2006) we argue that compositional semantic based valence shifters are a vital
part of any system undertaking semi-supervised sentiment analysis, under the assumption that
emotions are valence-rooted.
