Abstract 

We present the implementation of an au-
tonomous chatbot, SHIHbot, deployed on 
Facebook, which answers a wide variety 
of sexual health questions on HIV/AIDS. 
The chatbot's response database is com-
piled from professional medical and public 
health resources in order to provide relia-
ble information to users. The system's 
backend is NPCEditor, a response selec-
tion platform trained on linked questions 
and answers; to our knowledge this is the 
first retrieval-based chatbot deployed on a 
large public social network. 

1 Introduction 

HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is an in-
curable virus that leads to chronic illness and is 
the precursor for the potentially fatal disease, 
AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). 
Approximately 73% of those infected are aware 
of their HIV-status1. Without diagnosis infor-
mation, HIV-infected people are unable to access 
medication that improves their health, and reduc-
es their risk of passing HIV on to their partners. 
However, stigma and discrimination, particularly 
in the form of homophobia, may prevent people 
from accessing providers for support. 

Of the approximately 20 million per year sex-
ually transmitted infections diagnosed, half occur 
among individuals between the ages of 15 and 
242, thus sexual education for youths is vital. Yet 
youths indicate that sexual education does not 
meet their needs, as many report discomfort dis-
cussing sensitive topics in front of peers and with 
teachers who they feel might inform their parents 
about inquiries (DiCenso et al, 2001). However,

access to medically accurate information or confi-
dential, individual counseling decreases negative 
consequences by increasing condom and contra-
ception use (Kirby et al.,1994). 

In the United States, overall technology usage 
(including Internet and mobile phone use) for 
those age 12 to 29 years was over 90% in 2014, 
and social media use was also high: 12-17 year 
olds: 81%; and 18-29 year olds: 89%3. Technolo-
gy, particularly mobile technologies and social 
media, thus offers a powerful method to not only 
reach, but also engage and retain youth and young 
adults in HIV prevention and care. To inform our 
target group of youths, we implemented a chatbot, 
named SHIHbot, to dispense relevant, profession-
ally vetted, and easy to access HIV/AIDS infor-
mation on Facebook. Continuation of current 
work will strengthen the system before full public 
deployment. SHIHbot will undergo several rounds 
of testing and evaluation by cohorts of participants 
in the target demographic. Evaluation will include 
metrics for satisfying social work goals as well as 
dialogue system goals. 

2 Motivation 

Recent research has investigated the acceptabil-
ity of sharing sexual health information via tech-
nology due to high technology use among youths, 
particularly vulnerable minorities in this demo-
graphic. One online survey distributed to over 
5000 youth age 13 to 18 found that 19% of heter-
osexual youth versus 78% of gay/lesbian/queer 
youth used the Internet to search for sexual health 
information. The sizable difference in usage was 
attributed to sexual minority youth reporting lack 
of credible offline information sources (Mitchell 
et al., 2014).

We are aware of two chat services have been 
developed and evaluated to deliver health infor-
mation to youths via social media. One, named 
MiChat, is a live chat intervention for 18 to 29 
year olds delivered on Facebook and consists of 
eight one-hour motivational interviewing and 
cognitive behavioral skills-based online sessions 
designed to reduce condomless anal sex and sub-
stance use. In a pre-posttest design among 41 par-
ticipants with no control group, investigators 
found that participation in at least one session of 
the intervention (n= 31) was associated with re-
ductions in instances of condomless anal sex (Le-
lutiu-Weinberger et al., 2015). Another chatbot de-
veloped in 2011 was deployed on Windows Live 
Messenger and exclusively answered questions 
dealing with sex, drugs, and alcohol. The chatbot 
was rated highly by adolescent participants and 
demonstrated the potential to reach youths via 
chatbots (Crutzen et al., 2011). As of time of writ-
ing the chatbot is no longer accessible. 

Facebook has over 1.23 billion daily active us-
ers4, providing a platform to reach a large audi-
ence. Facebook also currently hosts over 30,000 
unique automated chatbots, nonetheless users

have reported disappointing experiences5. Our 
system, hence, aims to give a satisfying and in-
formative experience to users by providing relia-
ble information through a service that is always 
available on a ubiquitous social network. 

3 Question-Answer Corpus 

To build a system that answers a variety of per-
sonal and relevant questions about HIV/AIDS 
concerns, we created a corpus containing linked 
questions and answers (QA). Although a lot of in-
formation can be obtained from the web, the in-
formation might contain errors. To counteract this, 
our chatbot only provides information from relia-
ble sources.  

We extracted questions and their respective an-
swers from the Center for Disease Control (CDC), 
New York State Department of Health HIV guide 
(NY), and i-Base, a treatment advocacy group that 
provides information vetted by medical profes-
sionals on an online forum. 

The QA corpus forms the domain knowledge 
for SHIHbot and also provides the training data 
for the response classifier. The three sources pro-

Type Purpose Example dialogue 
Don’t know No relevant response in 

domain above threshold 
User: What is the weather in LA? 
SHIHbot: I am not confident on an answer for that question.   

Personal Questions about the chat-
bot 

User: are you a robot? 
SHIHbot:  I am a computer, but I have lots of human colleagues 
who helped make me so smart.  

Greeting Greetings and pleasantries User: hello 
SHIHbot: Hi there! Do you have any questions about HIV/AIDS? 

Alternative Suggests a new conversa-
tion topic after 3 off topic 
inputs from user 

User: will it rain today? 
SHIHBot: I'm not sure on that. I would be happy to answer any 
questions you have about HIV/AIDS though. 

Say more Gives a random response 
with the same topic as the 
previous response 

User: Should I get tested even if I do not have symptoms? 
SHIHBOT: If you think that you may have been exposed to HIV: 
you should get tested as soon as possible. You may have HIV and 
have no symptoms for many years. 
User: tell me more about this topic. 
SHIHBot: The CDC recommends that everyone between the ages 
of 13 and 64 get tested for HIV at least once as part of routine 
health care. About 1 in 8 people in the United States who have 
HIV don’t know they have it.

provided over 3000 questions; some were curated 
by medical professionals but most submitted di-
rectly by users seeking information. The questions 
cover more than forty categories, encompassing 
questions dealing with transmission of HIV, po-
tential drug interactions, and the history of the 
disease, among others. The inclusion of questions 
from i-Base provided real-world questions from 
users, rounding out the “frequently-asked ques-
tions” nature of the questions from the CDC and 
NY. 

We also pulled all responses linked with their 
original questions from the three sources. All re-
sponses are either provided by medical profes-
sionals directly (CDC and NY) or approved by 
medical professionals (i-Base). Due to the larger 
variety in domain for questions from the forum on 
i-Base, the responses from this source also 
demonstrate a large variety. We reduced the total 
number of responses as more questions were pro-
vided from i-Base than answers. This was due to a 
new question being referred to the answer for a 
similar question previously responded to. In these 
cases, both questions were matched with the same 
answer in the corpus.  In addition, when answers 
repeated the same information, only one answer 
was repeated where appropriate. For example, 
synonymous questions about a cure for HIV were 
all provided with the same response. An expert in 
social work manually annotated answers with top-
ic tags in order to provide topic information to the 
dialogue manager. 

4 Architecture 

The architecture of SHIHbot comprises NPCEdi-
tor, a dialogue manager, and plugins to Facebook.  

4.1 Dialogue Management 
To drive our chatbot responses we used NPCEdi-
tor, a response classifier and dialogue manage-
ment system (Leuski and Traum, 2011). NPCEdi-
tor employs a statistical classifier that is trained on 
linked questions and responses; for each new user 
utterance, the classifier ranks all the available re-
sponses. We train the classifier on our QA corpus, 
which is augmented by questions and responses 
about the chatbot itself and utterances that main-
tain dialogue flow such as greetings and closings 
(Table 1).  

The dialogue manager functionality within 
NPCEditor chooses which response to return back 
to the user. Typically it will choose the response 

that was ranked highest by the classifier, but it 
may choose a lower ranked response in order to 
avoid repetition. If the score of the top ranked re-
sponse is below a predefined threshold (deter-
mined during training), the dialogue manager will 
instead select an off-topic response that indicates 
non-understanding (such as “please repeat that” or 
“I don’t understand”). The classifier also has spe-
cial tokens to recognize when a user asks the 
chatbot to repeat an answer or elaborate on a per-
vious answer, and when such a token is identified, 
the dialogue manager will repeat or elaborate, 
based on the topic annotation of the responses. A 
counter keeps track of the number of consecutive 
times the chatbot has failed to provide a direct an-
swer, and on the 3rd instance, an “alternative” re-
sponse is given to suggest returning to the 
HIV/AIDS domain. The counter restarts after giv-
ing an “alternative” response.   

Previous applications of NPCEditor have been 
used to drive interactive characters in various do-
mains such as interactive museum guides 
(Swartout et al., 2010), entertainment experiences 
(Hartholt et al., 2009), and interviews with Holo-
caust survivors (Artstein et al., 2016). NPCEditor 
was applied to the HIV/AIDS domain in the de-
velopment of a virtual reality application designed 
for HIV positive young men who have sex with 
men (YMSM) to practice disclosing their status to 
intimate partners in an immersive, nonjudgmental 
environment (Knudtson et al., 2016). While 
NPCEditor has been used for custom chat applica-
tions, this is the first deployment of NPCEditor 
with Facebook Messenger. 

4.2 Facebook API 
 Facebook launched the Messenger platform sup-
porting chatbots, as well as sending and receiving 
APIs in 2016.6 SHIHbot is the first deployment of 
a Facebook bot using NPCEditor, and to our 
knowledge, is the first Facebook bot to use infor-
mation retrieval based response selection.  

To create a chatbot on Messenger, the free Fa-
cebook API was used. This API was then connect-
ed with NPCEditor plugins, bridging NPCEditor 
and Facebook. When a message event occurs, it 
notifies our web-hook and calls a predefined func-
tion. Once all the actions of NPCEditor are com-
pleted and a response has been selected, the re-
sponse is then sent to Facebook to deliver to the

5 Demonstration outline 

Participants will engage with SHIHbot via an 
open portal on Facebook Messenger available on 
a laptop at the demonstration. Participants will be 
invited to type input to the chatbot or welcome to 
provide suggestions for input. The live conversa-
tions will exhibit SHIHbot’s ability to understand 
new questions, the chatbot’s ability to cope with 
being asked questions outside of the domain 
knowledge, and the overall flow of dialogue. Par-
ticipants will also be invited to view the real-time 
visualizations (Swartout et al., 2010) of how re-
sponses are selected based on user input.
