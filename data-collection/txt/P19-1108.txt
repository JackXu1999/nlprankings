Abstract

Personal health mention detection deals with
predicting whether or not a given sentence is
a report of a health condition. Past work men-
tions errors in this prediction when symptom
words, i.e., names of symptoms of interest, are
used in a figurative sense. Therefore, we com-
bine a state-of-the-art figurative usage detec-
tion with CNN-based personal health mention
detection. To do so, we present two meth-
ods: a pipeline-based approach and a feature
augmentation-based approach. The introduc-
tion of figurative usage detection results in an
average improvement of 2.21% F-score of per-
sonal health mention detection, in the case
of the feature augmentation-based approach.
This paper demonstrates the promise of using
figurative usage detection to improve personal
health mention detection.

1 Introduction

The World Health Organisation places importance
on gathering intelligence about epidemics to be
able to effectively respond to them (World Health
Organisation, 2019). Natural language process-
ing (NLP) techniques have been applied to social
media datasets for epidemic intelligence (Charles-
Smith et al., 2015). An important classifica-
tion task in this area is personal health men-
tion detection: to detect whether or not a text
contains a personal health mention (PHM). A
PHM is a report that either the author or some-
one they know is experiencing a health condi-
tion or a symptom (Lamb et al., 2013). For ex-
ample, the sentence ‘I have been coughing since
morning’ is a PHM, while ‘Having a cough for
three weeks or more could be a sign of cancer’
is not. The former reports that the author has
a cough while, in the latter, the author provides
information about coughs in general. Past work
in PHM detection uses classification-based ap-
proaches with human-engineered features (Lamb

et al., 2013; Yin et al., 2015) or word embedding-
based features (Karisani and Agichtein, 2018).
However, consider the quote ‘When Paris sneezes,
Europe catches cold’ attributed to Klemens von
Metternich1. The quote contains names of symp-
toms (referred to as ‘symptom words’ hereafter)
‘sneezes’ and ‘cold’. However, it is not a PHM,
since the symptom words are used in a figurative
sense. Since several epidemic intelligence tools
based on social media rely on counts of keyword
occurrences (Charles-Smith et al., 2015), figura-
tive sentences may introduce errors. Figurative us-
age has been quoted as a source of error in past
work (Jimeno Yepes et al., 2015; Karisani and
Agichtein, 2018). In this paper, we deal with the
question:

Does personal health mention detection
benefit from knowing if symptom words
in a text were used in a literal or figura-
tive sense?

To address the question, we use a state-of-
the-art approach that detects idiomatic usage of
words (Liu and Hwa, 2018). Given a word and
a sentence, the approach identifies if the word is
used in a figurative or literal sense in the sentence.
We refer to this module as ‘figurative usage de-
tection’. We experiment with alternative ways to
combine figurative usage detection with PHM de-
tection, and report results on a manually labeled
dataset of tweets.

2 Motivation

As the first step, we ascertain if the volume of
figurative usage of symptom words warrants such
attention. Therefore, we randomly selected 200
tweets (with no duplicates and retweets) posted in
November 2018, each containing either ‘cough’ or
‘breath’. After discarding tweets with garbled text,

two annotators manually annotated each tweet
with the labels ‘figurative’ or ‘literal’ to answer the
question: ‘Has the symptom word been mentioned
in a figurative or literal manner?’. Note that, (a)
in the tweet ‘When it’s raining cats and dogs and
you’re down with a cough!’, the symptom usage is
literal, and (b) Hyperbole (for example, ‘soon I’ll
cough my entire lungs up’) is considered to be lit-
eral. The two annotators agreed on a label 93.96%
of the time. Cohen’s kappa coefficient for inter-
rater agreement is 0.8778, indicating a high agree-
ment. For 52.75% of these tweets, both annotators
assign the label as figurative. This provides only
an estimate of the volume of figurative usage of
symptom words. We also expect that the estimate
would differ for different symptom words.

3 Approach

We now introduce the approaches for figurative
usage and PHM detection. Following that, we
present two alternative approaches to interface fig-
urative usage detection with PHM detection: the
pipeline approach and the feature augmentation
approach.

3.1 Figurative Usage Detection

In the absence of a health-related dataset labeled
with figurative usage of symptom words, we im-
plement the unsupervised approach to detect id-
ioms introduced in Liu and Hwa (2018). This
forms the figurative usage detection module. The
input to the figurative usage detection module is
a target keyword and a sentence, and the output
is whether or not the keyword is used in a fig-
urative sense. The approach can be summarised
in two steps: computation of a literal usage score
for target keyword followed by a LDA-based es-
timator to predict the label. To compute the lit-
eral usage score, Liu and Hwa (2018) first gen-
erate a set of words that are related to the target
keywords (symptom words, in our case). This set
is called the ‘literal usage representation’. The lit-
eral usage score is computed as the average simi-
larity between the words in the sentence and the
words in the literal usage representation. Thus,
this score is a real value between 0 and 1 (where
1 is literal and 0 is figurative). The score is then
concatenated with linguistic features (described
later in this section). The second step is a Latent
Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)-based estimator. The
estimator computes two distributions: the word-

Figure 2: Pipeline approach.

figurative/literal distribution which indicates the
probability of a word to be either figurative or lit-
eral, and a document-figurative/literal distribution
which gives a predictive score for a document to
be literal or figurative. To obtain the literal us-
age score, we generate the literal usage represen-
tation using word2vec similarity learned from the
Sentiment140 tweet dataset (Go et al., 2009). We
use two sets of linguistic features, as reported in
Liu and Hwa (2018): the presence of subordinate
clauses and part-of-speech tags of neighbouring
words, using Stanford CoreNLP (Manning et al.,
2014). We adapt the abstractness feature in their
paper to health-relatedness (i.e., the presence of
health-related words). The intuition is that tweets
which contain more health-related words are more
likely to be using the symptom words in a literal
sense instead of figurative. Therefore, the abstract-
ness feature in the original paper is converted to
domain relatedness and captured using the pres-
ence of health-related words. We consider the
symptom word as the target word. It must be noted
that we do not have or use figurative labels in the
dataset except for the sample used to report the ef-
ficacy of figurative usage detection.

3.2 PHM Detection

We use a CNN-based classifier for PHM detec-
tion, as shown in Figure 1. The tweet is converted



1144

to its sentence representation using a concate-
nation of embeddings of the constituent words,
padded to a maximum sequence length. The em-
beddings are initialised based on pre-trained word
embeddings. We experiment with three alterna-
tives of pre-trained word embeddings, as elabo-
rated in Section 4. These are then passed to three
sets of convolutional layers with max pooling and
dropout layers. A dense layer is finally used to
make the prediction.

3.3 Interfacing Figurative Usage Detection
with PHM Detection

We consider two approaches to interface figurative
usage detection with PHM detection:

1. Pipeline Approach places the two modules
in a pipeline, as illustrated in Figure 2. If the
figurative usage detection module predicts a
usage as figurative, the PHM detection clas-
sifier is bypassed and the tweet is predicted
to not be a PHM. If the figurative usage pre-
diction is literal, then the prediction from the
PHM detection module is returned. We refer
to this approach as ‘+Pipeline’.

2. Feature Augmentation Approach augments
PHM detection with figurative usage fea-
tures. Therefore, the figurative label and
the linguistic features from figurative usage
detection are concatenated as figurative us-
age features ad passed through a convolution
layer. The two are then concatenated in a
dense layer to make the prediction. The ap-
proach is illustrated in Figure 3. This ap-
proach is based on Dasgupta et al. (2018),
where they augment additional features to
word embeddings of words in a document.
We refer to this approach as ‘+FeatAug’.

In +Pipeline, the figurative label guides whether or
not PHM detection will be called. In +FeatAug,
the label becomes one of the features. For both
the approaches, the figurative label is determined
by producing the literal usage score and then ap-
plying an empirically determined threshold. We
experimentally determine if using the literal usage
score performs better than using the LDA-based
estimator (See Section 4.3).

4 Experiment Setup

4.1 Dataset
We report our results on a dataset introduced
and referred to by Karisani and Agichtein (2018)
as the PHM2017 dataset. This dataset consists
of 5837 tweets related to a collection of dis-
eases: Alzheimer’s (1103, 16.7% PHM), heart at-
tack (973, 12.4% PHM), Parkinson’s (868, 9.8%
PHM), cancer (988, 20.6% PHM), depression
(924, 38.5% PHM) and stroke (981, 14.2% PHM).
The imbalance in the class labels of the dataset
must be noted. Some tweets in the original pa-
per could not be downloaded due to deletion or
privacy settings.

4.2 Configuration
For PHM detection (PHMD) and the two com-
bined approaches (+Pipeline and +FeatAug), the
parameters are empirically determined as:

1. PHMD: Filters=100, Kernels=(3, 4, 5), Pool
size=2; Dropout=(0.2, 0.3, 0.5).

2. Figurative Usage Detection: The figurative la-
bel is predicted using a threshold for the literal
usage score. This threshold is set to 0.2. This
holds for both +Pipeline and +FeatAug. In the
case of +Pipeline, a tweet is predicted as fig-
urative, and, as a result, non-PHM, if the lit-
eral usage score is lower than 0.2. In the case
of +FeatAug, the figurative label based on the
score is added along with other features.

3. +FeatAug: Filters=100; Kernel size (left)=(3,
4, 5), Pool size=2; Dropout=(0.3, 0.1, 0.3);
Kernel size (right)=2.

All experiments use the Adam optimiser and
a batch size of 128, and trained for 35 epochs.
CNN experiments use the ReLU activation. We

use seven types of initialisations for the word em-
beddings. The first four are a random initialisa-
tion, and three pre-trained embeddings. The pre-
trained embeddings are: (a) word2vec (Mikolov
et al., 2013); (b) GloVe (trained on Common
Crawl) (Pennington et al., 2014); and, (c) Num-
berbatch (Speer et al., 2017). The next three are
embeddings retrofitted with three ontologies. We

use three ontologies to retrofit GloVe embeddings
using the method by Faruqui et al. (2015). The
ontologies are: (a) MeSH,2 (b) Symptom3, and (c)
WordNet (Miller, 1995). The results are averaged
across 10-fold cross-validation.

4.3 Evaluation of Figurative Usage Detection
To validate the performance of figurative usage de-
tection, we use the dataset of tweets described in
Section 2. The tweets contain symptom words that
have been manually labeled. We obtain an F-score
of (a) 76.46% when only the literal usage score is
used, and (b) 69.72% when the LDA-based esti-
mator is also used. Therefore, we use the literal
usage score along with the figurative usage fea-
tures for our experiments.

5 Results

The effectiveness of PHMD, +Pipeline and
+FeatAug for the four kinds of word embed-
ding initialisations is shown in Table 1. In each
of these cases, +FeatAug performs better than
PHMD, while +Pipeline results in a degradation.
We note that, for both +FeatAug and +Pipeline,
the recall is impacted in comparison with PHMD.
Similar trends are observed for the retrofitted em-
beddings, as shown in Table 2. The improve-
ment when figurative usage detection is used is

higher in the case of retrofitted embeddings than
in the previous case. The highest improvement
(47.55% to 51.15%) is when GloVe embeddings
are retrofitted with WordNet. A minor observation
is that the F-scores are lower than GloVe with-
out the retrofitting, highlighting that retrofitting
may not always result in an improvement. Ta-
ble 3 shows the average performance across the
seven types of word embedding initialisations.
The +Pipeline approach results in a degradation
of 4.78%. This shows that merely discarding
tweets where the symptom word usage was pre-
dicted as figurative may not be useful. This could
be because the figurative usage detection tech-
nique is not free from errors. In contrast though,
for +FeatAug, there is an improvement of 2.21%.
This shows that our technique of augmenting with
the figurative usage-based features is beneficial.
The improvement of 2.21% may seem small as
compared to the prevalence of figurative tweets as
described in Section 2. However, all tweets with
figurative usage may not have been mis-classified
by PHMD. The improvement shows that a fo-
cus on figurative usage detection helps PHMD.
Finally, the F-scores for PHMD with +FeatAug
with GloVe embeddings for the different illnesses,
available as a part of the annotation in the dataset,
is compared in Table 4. Our observation that heart
attack results in the lowest F-score, is similar to
the one reported in the original paper. At the same
time, we observe that, except for heart attack, all
illnesses witness an improvement in the case of
+FeatAug.

6 Error Analysis

Typical errors made by our approach are:

• Indirect reference: Some tweets convey an
infection by implication. For example, ‘don’t
worry I got my face mask Charlotte, you will
not catch the flu from me!’ does not specifi-
cally state that someone has influenza.

• Health words: In the case of stroke or heart
attack, we obtain false negatives because
many tweets do not contain other associated
health words. Similarly, in the case of depres-
sion, some words like ‘addiction’, ‘mental’,
‘anxiety’ appear which were not a part of the
related health words taken into account.

• Sarcasm or humour: Some mis-classified
tweets appear to be sarcastic or joking. For

example, ‘I’m trying to overcome depression
and I need reasons to get out the house lol’.
Here, the person is being humorous (indi-
cated by ‘lol’) but the usage of the symptom
word ‘depression’ is literal.

7 Related Work

Several approaches for PHM detection have been
reported (Joshi et al., 2019). Lamb et al.
(2013) incorporate linguistic features such as word
classes, stylometry and part of speech patterns.
Yin et al. (2015) use similar stylistic features
like hashtags and emojis. Karisani and Agichtein
(2018) implement another approach of partition-
ing and distorting the word embedding space to
better detect PHMs, obtaining a best F-score of
69%. While we use their dataset, they use a statis-
tical classifier while we use a deep learning-based
classifier. For figurative usage detection, super-
vised (Liu and Hwa, 2017) as well as unsuper-
vised (Sporleder and Li, 2009; Liu and Hwa, 2018;
Muzny and Zettlemoyer, 2013; Jurgens and Pile-
hvar, 2015) methods have been reported. We pick
the work by Liu and Hwa (2018) assuming that it
is state-of-the-art.

8 Conclusions

We employed a state-of-the-art method in figura-
tive usage detection to improve the detection of
personal health mentions (PHMs) in tweets. The
output of this method was combined with clas-
sifiers for detecting PHMs in two ways: (1) a
simple pipeline-based approach, where the perfor-
mance of PHM detection degraded; and, (2) a fea-
ture augmentation-based approach where the per-
formance of PHM detection improved. Our ob-
servations demonstrate the promise of using fig-
urative usage detection for PHM detection, while
highlighting that a simple pipeline-based approach
may not work. Other ways of combining the two
modules, more sophisticated classifiers for both
PHM detection and figurative usage detection, are
possible directions of future work. Also, a similar
application to improve disaster mention detection
could be useful (for figurative sentences such as
‘my heart is on fire’).
