Abstract

In this paper, we present a framework
for quantitative characterization of code-
switching patterns in multi-party conver-
sations, which allows us to compare and
contrast the socio-cultural and functional
aspects of code-switching within a set of
cultural contexts. Our method applies
some of the proposed metrics for quan-
tification of code-switching (Gamback and
Das, 2016; Guzman et al., 2017) at the
level of entire conversations, dyads and
participants. We apply this technique to
analyze the conversations from 18 recent
Hindi movies. In the process, we are able
to tease apart the use of code-switching
as a device for establishing identity, socio-
cultural contexts of the characters and the
events in a movie.

1 Introduction

Code-switching (henceforth CS) or code-mixing
refers to the juxtaposition of linguistic units from
more than one language in a single conversation,
or in a single utterance. Linguists have exten-
sively studied the structural (i.e., the grammatical
constraints on CS) and functional (i.e., the moti-
vation and intention behind CS) aspects of CS in
various mediums, contexts, languages and geogra-
phies (Myers-Scotton, 2005; Auer, 1995, 2013).
However, most of these studies are limited to qual-
itative analysis of small datasets, which makes it
hard to make statistically valid quantitative claims
over the nature and distribution of CS.

Recently, due to the availability of large code-
switched datasets, gathered mostly from social
media, there has been some quantitative stud-
ies on socio-linguistic and functional aspects of
CS (Rudra et al., 2016; Rijhwani et al., 2017; Guz-

man et al., 2017). Nevertheless, there are no large-
scale quantitative studies of code-switched conver-
sations, primarily because currently the only avail-
able large-scale datasets come from social media.
These are either micro-blogs without any conver-
sational context or data from Facebook or What-
sApp with very short conversations. On the other
hand, functions of CS are most relevant and dis-
cernible in relatively long multi-party conversa-
tions embedded in a social context. For instance,
it is well documented (Auer, 2013) that CS is mo-
tivated by complex social functions, such as iden-
tity, social power and style accommodation, which
are difficult to elicit and establish from short social
media texts.

In this work, we propose a set of techniques for
analyzing CS styles and functions in conversations
grounded over social networks. Our approach de-
velops on two previously proposed metrics of CS –
the Code-mixing Index (CMI) (Gamback and Das,
2016) and corpus level metrics proposed in (Guz-
man et al., 2017), applied to conversations at the
level of dyads, participants, conversation scenes
and the entire social network of the participants.
We apply this new approach to analyze scripts of
18 recent Hindi movies with various degrees and
styles of Hindi-English CS. Through this analysis
technique, we are able to bring out the social func-
tions of CS at different levels.

The primary contributions of this work are: (a)
development of a set of quantitative conversation
analysis techniques for CS; (b) some visualiza-
tion techniques for CS patterns in conversations
that can help linguists and social scientists to get
a holistic view of the switching styles in interac-
tions; (c) analysis of CS patterns in recent Hindi
movies that adds to the existing rich literature of
similar but small scale qualitative studies of CS in
Indian cinema.

Rest of this paper is organized as follows: Sec75



2 describes related work on functions of CS with
particular emphasis on CS in Indian cinema. Sec
3 introduces our analysis technique, which is later
applied and illustrated in the context of movie
scripts in Sec 5 and 6. Sec 4 introduces the movie
dataset, preprocessing of the scripts and word-
level language labeling of the dialogues. Sec 7
concludes the paper by summarizing the contribu-
tions and discussing potential future work.

2 Related Work

In this section, we will start with a brief review of
the linguistics literature on functional and socio-
linguistic aspects of CS, followed by a discussion
on recent computational models. In order to put
the case-study on Hindi movies in perspective, we
will also review relevant literature on CS in Indian
cinema.

2.1 Functions of Code-Switching

Code-switching is a common phenomenon in all
multilingual communities, though usually it is un-
predictable whether in a given context a speaker
will code-switch or not (Auer, 1995). Neverthe-
less, linguists have observed that there are pre-
ferred languages for communicating certain kinds
of functions. For instance, certain speech activities
might be exclusively or more commonly related
to a certain language choice (e.g. Fishman (1971)
reports use of English for professional purposes
and Spanish for informal chat for English-Spanish
bilinguals from Puerto Rico). Language switch-
ing is also used as a signaling device that serves
specific communicative functions (Barredo, 1997;
Sanchez, 1983; Nishimura, 1995; Maschler, 1991,
1994) such as: (a) reported speech (b) narrative
to evaluative switch (c) reiterations or empha-
sis (d) topic shift (e) puns and language play (f)
topic/comment structuring etc. Attempts of pre-
dicting the preferred language, or even exhaus-
tively listing such functions, have failed. However,
linguists agree that language alteration in multilin-
gual communities is not a random process.

Code-switching is also strongly linked to social
identity and the principle of linguistic style ac-
commodation (Melhim and Rahman, 1991; Auer,
2013). For instance, two Hindi-English bilingual
speakers could code-switch just to establish a con-
nection or in-group identity because CS is the
norm for a large section of urban Indians, and En-
glish is attached to aspirational values by a large

section of the Indian society (see Sec.2.3 for de-
tailed discussion on this).

2.2 Computational and Quantitative Studies
Over the last decade, research in computational
processing of code-switching has gained signifi-
cant interest (Solorio and Liu, 2008, 2010; Vyas
et al., 2014; Peng et al., 2014; Sharma et al., 2016).
In particular, word-level language identification,
which is the first step towards processing of CS
text, has received a lot of attention (see Rijhwani
et al. (2017) for a review). In this work, we use the
word-level language labeler by Gella et al. (2013)
for labeling the Hindi movie dialogues.

Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge,
there has been very little work on automatic iden-
tification of functional aspects of CS or any large-
scale data-driven study of its socio-linguistic as-
pects. Of the few studies that exist, most no-
table are the ones by Rudra et al. (2016) on lan-
guage preference by Hindi-English bilinguals on
Twitter and Rijhwani et al. (2017) on extent and
patterns of CS across European languages from
24 cities. Rudra et al. (2016) analyzed 430K
unique tweets for opinion and sentiment, and con-
cluded that Hindi-English bilinguals prefer to ex-
press negative opinions in Hindi; they further re-
port that a large fraction of the CS tweets exhib-
ited the narrative-evaluative function. Rijhwani et
al. (2017) examined more than 50M tweets from
across the world the study shows that the percent-
age of CS tweets varies from 1 to 11% across
the cities, and more CS is observed in the cities
where English is not the primary language of com-
munication. They also show that English-Spanish
CS patterns in a predominantly Spanish speaking
region (e.g., Barcelona) are different from those
where English is the primary language (e.g., Hous-
ton).

In an excellent survey on computational socio-
linguistics, Nguyen et al. (2016) report a few other
studies on socio-linguistic aspects of multilingual
communities.

2.3 Code-switching in Indian Cinema
Hindi-English CS, commonly called Hinglish, is
extremely widespread in India. There is histor-
ical attestation, as well as recent studies on the
growing use of Hinglish in general conversation,
and in entertainment and media (see Parshad et al.
(2016) and references therein). Several recent
studies (Bali et al., 2014; Barman et al., 2014;76



Sequiera et al., 2015) also provide evidence of
Hinglish and other instances of CS on online so-
cial media, such as Twitter and Facebook.

Hindi movies provide a rich data source for
studying CS in the Indian context. Accord-
ing to the Conversational Analysis approach to
CS (Auer, 2013; Wei, 2002), in any given context
a particular language is preferred or unmarked.
Therefore, “speakers, and in turn script writers,
choose marked or unmarked codes on the ba-
sis of which one will bring them the best out-
comes” (Vaish, 2011). Myers-Scotton (2005) sug-
gested that the matrix or unmarked code for Hindi
movies is Hindi. Therefore, any switch to English
has some communicative purpose. Lösch (2007)
uses this idea to analyze the dialogues of the
movie Monsoon Wedding (2001) and concludes
that English is used as a device for encoding so-
cial distance; lower socio-economic class charac-
ters switch to English for upward social mobility.

Vaish (2011), on the other hand, argues that
Hindi is not necessarily the matrix or the un-
marked code for all characters and scenes in cur-
rent Hindi movies. Instead, the two codes (and
sometimes even more languages and regional va-
rieties) are used to bring out the identity of each
character. In particular, English and Hinglish are
associated with Westernization of culture, and are
often used as the preferred code for depicting NRI
or otherwise strongly westernized characters in
the movies. Yet a third line of study by Kachru
(2006) argues that predominance of English in
Hindi movies crops from the fact that it helps the
screenplay writers to borrow fresh metaphors and
new rhyming words from English; it also adds to
the playfulness, irony, humor and satire.

Chandra et al. (2016) report an acute rise in
use of English words in Hindi song lyrics over the
years. This is the only quantitative study of CS in
Indian cinema that we are aware of.

3 Approach

In this section, we present the techniques that
can be used to study complex multi-party conver-
sations like plays, movies, Facebook/WhatsApp
group conversations, and so on. We propose a do-
main independent modular framework to quanti-
tatively analyze these conversations. For this, we
adopt metrics proposed by Guzman et al. (2017)
and Gamback and Das (2016) to comprehensively
measure various aspects of CS in the corpus.

3.1 Metrics for Quantification of CS
The first corpus level quantification of the extent
and nature of CS was proposed by Gamback and
Das (2016). Referred to as the Code mixing in-
dex, this metric tries to capture the language distri-
bution and the switching, both at the level of utter-
ances and the entire corpus. Let N be the number
of languages, x an utterance; let tLi be the tokens
in language Li, P be the number of code alterna-
tion points in x; also, letwm andwp be the weights
for the two components of the metric. Then, the
Code mixed index per utterance, Cu(x) for x is:

Cu(x) = 100
wm(N(x)−maxLi∈L{tLi}(x)) + wpP (x)

N(x)
(1)

Let U be the number of utterances in the corpus
and S ≤ U be the number of utterances that con-
tains code-switching. Then the Code mixed index
over the entire corpus, Cc is defined as:

Cc =

∑U
x=1 Cu(x) + wpδ(x)

U
+ ws.

S

U
.100 (2)

δ(x) =

{
0, x = 1 ∨ Lx−1 = Lx
1, x 6= 1 ∧ Lx−1 6= Lx

(3)

In another recent study, Guzman et al. (2017)
propose not a single, but rather a set of metrics for
quantification of CS in a corpus. These are:

M-Index captures the inequality of distribution of
languages in the corpus. Let pj be the fraction
of words in language j and k represents the total
number of languages in the corpus, then

M-index =
1−∑ p2j

(k − 1)∑ p2j
(4)

Language Entropy is the number of bits needed
to represent the distribution of languages.

LE = −
k∑

j=1

pjlog2(pj) (5)

I-Index is the switching probability.

I-index =
Total no. of switch points

n− 1 (6)

Burstiness quantifies whether the switching has
periodic character or occurs in bursts. Let στ ,
mτ be the standard deviation and the mean of
language-span (in terms of number of words in a77



contiguous sequence of words in a language) dis-
tributions respectively.

Burstiness =
στ −mτ
στ +mτ

(7)

Span Entropy (SE) is the number of bits needed
to represent the distribution of language spans.
If pl represents sample probability of a span of
length l, then

SE = −
M∑

l=1

pllog2(pl) (8)

Memory captures the tendency of consecutive
language spans to be positively or negatively auto-
correlated. nr is the number of language spans in
the distribution, τi is the language span under con-
sideration, σ1 and m1 are the standard deviation
and the mean of all spans except the last, whereas
σ2 andm2 are the standard deviation and the mean
of all spans except the first,

Memory =
1

nr − 1

nr−1∑

i=1

(τi −m1)(τi+1 −m2)
σ1σ2

(9)
Each of these metrics evaluate a different aspect

of the corpus. For example, M-Index captures the
multilingualism of the corpus whereas CMI can be
used to measure the switching between languages
in and across the utterances. Therefore, an analyt-
ical approach that combines all these metrics and
overlays it on top of the conversation network of
the participants can bring out the various social
and functional aspects of CS.

3.2 The Proposed Approach
Here, we present a systematic approach to analyze
CS conversations. We begin with a set of defini-
tions and notations. Though the concepts defined
below applies to any multi-party conversation, it
might be useful to think of these in the context of
a play or a movie.

Let P = {P1, P2, . . . Pk} represents a set
of participants (akin to characters in a play or
movie). Let us define a conversation scene
Si as a sequence of participant-utterance pairs:
{〈P1,i, U1,i〉, 〈P2,i, U2,i〉, . . . 〈Pmi,i, Umi,i〉}. This
is essentially a multi-party conversation where
each participant Pj,i ∈ P speaks out Uj,i during
the conversation. Finally, a series of such scenes,
{S1, S2, ......., Sn} among the participants in P
along with their social context constitute a socially

grounded multi-party, multi-scene conversational
corpus, which we shall simply refer here as the
corpus1 C. Thus, C is similar to the script of an
entire movie or a play.

Note that while the social context of a scene,
such as the presence of passive participants, the
occassion and location, etc., are extremely impor-
tant for understanding the CS patterns, in the cur-
rent study we will ignore these meta-variables al-
together. Our analysis will solely rely on comput-
ing the CS metrics on the set of utterances present
in the entire corpus, which we shall denote as
π(C). Here, π refers to a projection of all the ut-
terances present in C.

Further, this projection can be limited to scenes,
participants, or dyads, which are defined below.

• πPi(C)→ set of all the utterances of the par-
ticipant Pi ∈ P in C

• πSj (C) → set of all the utterances in the
scene Sj in C

• πDi,j (C) → set of all the utterances of the
dyad (Pi, Pj), Pi, Pj ∈ P in C. A dyad is
defined as two consecutive utterances in any
scene, where the first and the second partic-
ipant are Pi and Pj , not necessarily in that
order.

The metrics described in the earlier subsections
can be applied to any of these projections and they
can be separately analyzed for inferences. We pro-
pose three kinds of analysis,

• Corpus: We can visualize each corpus C
based on these metrics and a cross-corpus
comparison can be made to explain the socio-
cultural setting of each of the corpora (or
movie).

• Participant: We can visualize the metrics for
a participant over the entire corpora and a
cross-participant comparison can reveal pat-
terns relating the social identity of the partic-
ipants.

• Dyad: Similar analysis can be done for each
dyad and this can help us find the functional
reasons for code switching, for example try-
ing to accommodate the other participant in
the conversation.

1Note that a collection of movie scripts, such as the one
analyzed here would usually be referred to as a corpus. How-
ever, here, we will refer to each movie as a conversational
corpus.78



• Conversation Network: We can overlay the
cross-metric comparison plots onto the net-
work graph of the participants and this allows
us to study the variations in the amount and
style of CS by a participant with the other
participants in the network.

Thus, we can see the wide range of insights
this line of analysis could provide, and in the next
three sections we will illustrate these techniques
through a case study on movies.

4 Dataset

Though our methodology can be applied to any
complex multi-party conversation, in this work we
apply our framework to the case of Hindi films.

For our study we chose 18 recent
Hindi film scripts from a blog (https:
//moifightclub.com/category/
scripts/), which has around two dozen
Hindi movie scripts. The movies with their
meta-data and basic corpus statistics are presented
in Table 1.

We processed the scripts from the above blog in
the following way, (i) Converted the scripts pdfs
to text (ii) Using simple regular expressions, we
extracted the characters, dialogues and also seg-
regated the script into scenes (iii) Language la-
beled the dialogue using the tagger developed by
(Gella et al., 2013) into one of Hi (Hindi), En (En-
glish) and Other. The language tagger uses con-
text switch probability and monolingual frequency
factor on the top of maximum entropy classifier to
classify the Hi-En data.

A dialogue snippet from the script of movie
Queen is shown below. All the English words
are italicized and loose literal translations in En-
glish are given within angular brackets. As we can
see both intra-sentential and inter-sentential CS is
present in this snippet.

The distribution of the languages are presented
in Table 1 and we see significant usage of English
in all movies. Overall, we have noticed four kinds
of errors in processing the scripts. First being
the limitations of pdf to text converter, where
formating and justification issues lead to word
splitting, but these are very few in the corpus.
Second, we initially missed out the dialogues that
were capitalized. All the characters in the scripts
are in caps and our cues are built accordingly.
We tried to minimize these errors by manually
identifying the characters after preprocessing.

An example of the third kind of error is, some
characters like ’Vijaylaxmi’ in the movie Queen
are initially represented by generic phrases like
’The French Girl’ before the character introduces
itself. These errors are also few and in general
there are very few dialogues by the character
before his/her introduction. Lastly, the errors
caused by language tagger and we observed the
accuracy to be slightly lower than the results
presented in the original paper.

5 Corpus level Analysis

In this section we present the results of the metrics
discussed in section 3 on the entire corpus. The
results of the metrics are given in table 2 and are
indexed by the Movie ID (as in table 1). The table
presents the metrics detailed in the section 3.1 with
the first half being the ones proposed by (Guzman
et al., 2017) and the later by (Gamback and Das,79

Table 1: List of Movies analyzed with some basic statistics. MID - Movie Id.

2016). Cc represents the CMI values on the over-
all corpus while Cu mix and Cu total denote the
CMI per utterance averaged over the mixed and to-
tal utterances respectively. P mix and P total are
the average number of switch points in the set of
mixed and total utterances respectively. The last
two columns represent the number and percentage
of inter-switches (change of matrix language) in
the corpus. We can see a significant variation of
most of the metrics across the movies. Figure 1
shows the distribution of mixed and non-mixed ut-
terances for the movies and this captures the mix-
ing in dialogues in contrast to the switching in the
entire corpus. On average, 50% of the dialogues
in a movie are code mixed and signifies the use of
multilingualism in the movie corpus.

Figure 2 represents the movies in an M-index vs
CMI scatter plot (π(C)). As shown, the movies
can be visually clustered into three sets: Clus-
ter A has movies with low CS (both low CMI

and M-Index), cluster B has movies with high
CS (both high CMI and M-Index), and cluster C
contains movies that has high M-Index (approxi-
mately equal usage of Hi and En) but low CMI.
Each of these clusters can be explained based on
the socio-cultural setting of the movies. For in-
stance, the movies in cluster B are based in ur-
ban setting and have more CS than the movies
in cluster A, which are typically based in small
towns (e.g., Dum laga ke haisha), rural settings
(e.g., Udaan), or in the past (e.g., Lootera). On
the other hand, the movies in cluster C like Queen
are the ones away from the trend-line (shown as
the dotted line) and it is because they have dif-
ferent matrix languages for different parts of the
movie. This results in an overall high M-Index
value but there is very little code switching in the
scenes with English as matrix language, leading to
lower CMI. We also compared other metrics but
gained very similar insights.80

6 Participant Level Analysis

In this section we analyze character and dyad spe-
cific aspects of CS patterns in the movies. We
compute the metrics, M-Index and CMI for cor-
pus projected on participants and dyads. Fig-
ure 3 shows the standard deviation of CMI and
M-index over all participants and dyads in the
movies. The plots indicate that there are signifi-
cant differences in the patterns across the movies.
For instance, MID-13 Queen shows large variation
in the amount of CS used by the various characters
and dyads; whereas, MID-18 Udaan has very lit-
tle variation in the extent of CS exhibited by the
characters and dyads. MID-15 Shahid shows yet
another different pattern, where all characters have
similar levels of CS, though there is a larger varia-
tion across the dyads. Thus, one can conclude that
in Queen CS is used to establish the identity of the
characters; in Shahid, CS is used for establishing
the social dynamics of the relations (dyads), but
not necessarily the characters; and in Udaan, CS
is neither used to establish characters or the dyadic
relationships; rather in this movie, the CS is used
to bring out the overall socio-cultural setting of the
movie.81

(right).

Figure 4: CMI of the the five characters ranked in
ascending order of the number of dialogues in the
movie, for six movies.

In order to understand and characterize these
differences further, for each movie we ranked the
participants/dyads by their utterance count and
plot the standard deviation for the top 5 partic-
ipants and top 10 dyads. Figure 4 and 5 shows
these plots, respectively for the characters and the
dyads, for the top and bottom three movies in
terms of the variance in CS (by CMI).

In the participant plot, Queen, D-day and Talvar
are the movies with highest variance while Kai po
che, Dedh ishqiya and Shahid are the ones with
lowest variance. In the movie Queen, the char-
acters ’Vijaylaxmi’ and ’Mikhaelo’ exhibit little
CS since they speak only or mainly English owing
their identity. On the other hand, ’Rani’ ,’Vijay’
and ’Mom’ are based in Delhi, India and they ex-
hibit high CS. Similarly in the case of D-day, the
character ’Aslam’ has multiple roles in the movie.
In order to distinguish between the roles, high CS
is used for one of the roles, compared to the other
prominent characters. Thus, we observe that CS is
used as a tool by the scripts writers to depict the
identity of the characters.

Figure 5: CMI for top 10 dyads for 6 movies.

In Figure 6 we see that for the movies Queen
and Talvar dyads exhibit high variation in CS,
whereas in D-day, Udaan, Dedh ishqiya and
Lootera there is very little variation across the top
10 dyads. It is interesting to note that for the movie
D-day, the characters show low but the dyads show
high variation, unlike the movie Queen where the
variation is high for both. In order to further in-
vestigate these variations, we plotted the character
network graphs for these movies on the top of their
CMI-M Index plot, also denoting the average M-
Index and CMI for the entire movie (figure 6 and
7).

The diameter of the circle denoting the par-
ticipant dPi ∝

√
|πPi(C)| and the thickness

and darkness of the edge between two partici-
pants are tPi,Pj ∝ log|πDi,j (C)| and dPi,Pj ∝
log|Cc(πDi,j (C))| respectively.

We observe a clear difference in the networks
for Queen and D-day. In the case of Queen, the
movie revolves around the central character ’Rani’
and all others characters have dialogues primarily
with ’Rani’. These characters are from different
countries (India, France, Japan, Russia) and the82

Figure 7: D-day - Network Plot

CS in dialogues with the central character varies
a lot, as captured by the darkness of edges in the
graph dPi,Pj . The individual amount of CS also
widely varies depending on the country of ori-
gin with higher Hi-En CS for characters based
in India. The overall mean CMI and M-Index
of the movie are closer to the central character
as she have many more dialogues than most oth-
ers. Whereas in D-day the characters are dis-
tributed around the movie’s average metrics and
the graph is well-connected. The CS patterns
across the characters and dyads are more similar
than in Queen. Thus, in Queen, we see CS being
used to represent social identity of the characters
but not so much in D-day. As we have already
illustrated the socio-cultural context of the movies
is also inherently captured by code switching. Due
to paucity of space we have only presented our
analysis for two movies but we observed similar
trends across the movies.

7 Conclusion

In this work, we presented a framework for quan-
titative characterization of CS patterns in multi-

party conversations which goes beyond the exist-
ing techniques of corpus level footprints. We ap-
ply this approach to analyze scripts of 18 Hindi
movies and illustrate its effectiveness in bringing
out certain social aspects of CS, such as establish-
ment of identity. Our study also reveals the widely
different styles and frequency in which CS is em-
ployed as a strategy to establish identity and social
context in the movies.

We would like to emphasize that the approach
presented here can be extended in scope as well
as applied to a wide genre of conversational data,
including but not limited to, social media text, pri-
vate and group chat (e.g., Whatsapp), trascribed
speech corpora and literary work. In terms of
scope, the approach can be used to study linguistic
style accomodation with respect to CS, and prag-
matic functions and structural aspects of code-
switching.
