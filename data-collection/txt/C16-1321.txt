Abstract

Comparable corpora are the main alternative to the use of parallel corpora to extract bilingual
lexicons. Although it is easier to build comparable corpora, specialized comparable corpora are
often of modest size in comparison with corpora issued from the general domain. Consequently,
the observations of word co-occurrences which are the basis of context-based methods are un-
reliable. We propose in this article to improve word co-occurrences of specialized comparable
corpora and thus context representation by using general-domain data. This idea, which has been
already used in machine translation task for more than a decade, is not straightforward for the
task of bilingual lexicon extraction from specific-domain comparable corpora. We go against the
mainstream of this task where many studies support the idea that adding out-of-domain docu-
ments decreases the quality of lexicons. Our empirical evaluation shows the advantages of this
approach which induces a significant gain in the accuracy of extracted lexicons.

1 Introduction

Comparable corpora are the main alternative to the use of parallel corpora for the task of bilingual
lexicon extraction, particularly in specialized and technical domains for which parallel texts are usually
unavailable or difficult to obtain. Although it is easier to build comparable corpora (Talvensaari et al.,
2007), specialized comparable corpora are often of modest size (around 1 million words) in comparison
with general-domain comparable corpora (up to 100 million words) (Morin and Hazem, 2016). The main
reason is related to the difficulty to obtain many specialized documents in a language other than English.
For example, a single query on the Elsevier portal1 of documents containing in their title the term “breast
cancer” returns 40,000 documents in English, where the same query returns 1,500 documents in French,
693 in Spanish and only 7 in German.

The historical context-based approach dedicated to the task of bilingual lexicon extraction from com-
parable corpora, and also known as the standard approach, relies on the simple observation that a word
and its translation tend to appear in the same lexical contexts (Fung, 1995; Rapp, 1999). In this approach,
each word is described by its lexical contexts in both source and target languages, and words in trans-
lation relationship should have similar lexical contexts in both languages. To enhance bilingual lexicon
induction, recent approaches use more sophisticated techniques such as topic models based on bilingual
latent dirichlet allocation (BiLDA) (Vulic and Moens, 2013b; Vulic and Moens, 2013a) or bilingual word
embeddings based on neural networks (Gouws et al., 2014; Chandar et al., 2014; Vulic and Moens, 2015;
Vulic and Moens, 2016) (approaches respectively noted: Gouws, Chandar and BWESG+cos). All these
approaches require at least sentence-aligned/document aligned parallel data (BiLDA, Gouws, Chandar)
or non-parallel document-aligned data at the topic level (BWESG+cos). Since specialized comparable
corpora are of small size, sentence-aligned (document aligned) parallel data are unavailable and non-
parallel document-aligned data at the topic level can’t be provided since specialized comparable corpora
usually deal with one single topic. Based on the recent comparison in (Vulic and Moens, 2015; Vulic
and Moens, 2016) where the standard approach (noted in there article as PPMI+cos) performed better in
most cases while compared to BiLDA, Gouws and Chandar, and due to the unavailability of non parallel

document aligned data at the topic level, we only deal with the standard approach and show at least that
our approach improve drastically bilingual terminology extraction while adding well selected external
data.

The small size of specialized comparable corpora renders unreliable word co-occurrences which are
the basis of the standard approach. In this paper, we propose to improve the reliability of word co-
occurrences in specialized comparable corpora by adding general-domain data. This idea has already
been successfully employed in machine translation task (Moore and Lewis, 2010; Axelrod et al., 2011;
Wang et al., 2014, among others). The approach of using adapted external data, also known as data
selection is often applied in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) to improve the quality of the language
and translation models, and hence, to increase the performance of SMT systems. If data selection has
become a mainstream in SMT, it is still not the case in the task of bilingual lexicon extraction from
specialized comparable corpora. The majority of the studies in this area support the principle that the
quality of the comparable corpus is more important than its size and consequently, increasing the size of
specialized comparable corpora by adding out-of-domain documents decreases the quality of bilingual
lexicons (Li and Gaussier, 2010; Delpech et al., 2012). This statement remains true as long as the used
data is not adapted to the domain. We propose two data selection techniques based on the combination
of a specialized comparable corpus with external resources. Our hypothesis is that word co-occurrences
learned from a general-domain corpus for general words (as opposed to the terms of the domain) improve
the characterization of the specific vocabulary of the corpus (the terms of the domain). By enriching the
general words representation in specialized comparable corpora, we improve their characterization and
therefore improve the characterization of the terms of the domain for better discrimination.

The remainder of this article is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the standard approach to
bilingual lexicon extraction from comparable corpora. Section 3 presents previous works related to the
improvements of the standard approach for specialized comparable corpora. Section 4 describes our
strategies to improve the characterization of lexical contexts. Section 5 presents the different textual
resources used for our experiments: the specialized and general comparable corpora, the bilingual dic-
tionary and the terminology reference lists. Section 6 evaluates the influence of using lexical contexts
built from general comparable corpora on the quality of bilingual terminology extraction. Section 7
presents our conclusions.

2 Standard Approach

Bilingual lexicon extraction from comparable corpora relies on the simple assumption that a word and its
translation tend to appear in the same lexical contexts. Based on this assumption, the standard approach
can be carried out by applying the following steps:

1. Build for each word w of the source and the target languages a context vector (resp. s and t
for source and target languages) by identifying the words that appear in a window of n words
around w normalized according to the measure of association of each word in the context of w.
The association measures studied are Mutual Information (Fano, 1961), Log-likelihood (Dunning,
1993), and the Discounted Odds-Ratio (Evert, 2005).

2. Translate with a bilingual dictionary the context vector of a word to be translated from the source to
the target language (i the translated context vector).

3. Compare the translated context vector i to each context vector of the target language t through a
similarity measure and rank the candidate translations according to this measure. The similarity
measures employed are Cosine (Salton and Lesk, 1968) and weighted Jaccard (Grefenstette, 1994)

3 Related Work

In the past few years, several contributions have been proposed to improve each step of the standard
approach. Prochasson et al. (2009) enhance the representativeness of the context vectors by strength-
ening the context words that happen to be transliterated and scientific compound words in the target

3402



language. Ismail and Manandhar (2010) also suggest that context vectors should be based on the most
important contextually relevant words (in-domain terms), and thus propose a method for filtering the
noise of the context vectors. Bouamor et al. (2013) propose an adaption of the standard approach that
exploits Wikipedia to improve the context vector representation. From the context vector of a word
to be translated, they build a vector of Wikipedia concepts using the ESA inverted index (Explicit Se-
mantic Analysis). This vector of concepts is then translated into the target language. The candidate
translations are found by projecting the translated vector of concepts using the ESA direct index onto the
context vector of the target language. Prochasson and Fung (2011) propose to use a machine learning
approach based both on the context-vector similarity and the co-occurrence features to learn a model
for rare words from one pair of languages and this model can be used to find translations from another
pair of languages. Hazem and Morin (2013) study different word co-occurrence prediction models in
order to make the observed co-occurrence counts in specialized comparable corpus more reliable by re-
estimating their probabilities. Morin and Hazem (2016) show the unfounded assumption of the balance
in terms of quantity of data of the specialized comparable corpora and that the use of unbalanced corpora
significantly improves the results of the standard approach.

Other improvements to the standard approach have been proposed by introducing other paradigms.
For instance, Gaussier et al. (2004) propose to apply Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) which is
a bilingual extension of Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) whereas Hazem and Morin (2012) propose to
use Independent Component Analysis (ICA) which is basically an extension of the Principal Component
Analysis (PCA). Vulić et al. (2011) also propose an extension of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
taking into account bilinguality and called bilingual LDA (BiLDA), improvements of this latter can be
found in (Vulic and Moens, 2013b; Vulic and Moens, 2013a). Gouws et al. (2014) and Chandar et
al. (2014) use multilingual word embeddings based on sentence-aligned parallel data and/or translation
dictionaries whereas Vulić and Moens. (2015; 2016) learn bilingual word embeddings from non-parallel
document aligned data based on skip-gram model. These approaches are beyond the scope of this study
because even if they improve the standard approach they are intended for large comparable corpora
of general language and/or require parallel aligned data or non parallel aligned documents which are
unavailable for specialized corpora. In this paper, we give a particular interest to the massive amount
of general domain data that can be found on the web and discuss ways of taking advantage of these
resources in order to enrich word context representation and improve the standard approach.

4 Adapted Standard Approach

We propose two adaptations of the standard approach. Based on the assumption that general domain
information can benefit the task of bilingual lexicon extraction from specialized corpora, we enhance the
standard approach for that purpose by jointly exploiting data from specialized and general domains.

4.1 Global Standard Approach

The first adaptation of the standard approach can be described as basic. It consists to build the context
vectors from a comparable corpus composed of the specialized and the general comparable corpora. This
adaptation is inspired by the work of Morin et al. (2010) that shows that the discourse categorization
(scientific versus popular scientific documents) of the documents in a specialized comparable corpus
increases the quality of the extracted French/Japanese lexicon composed of single-word terms despite
the data sparsity. For alignment of multi-word terms, the discourse categorisation of documents is not
relevant. This work suggests that increasing the size of the specialized comparable corpora by adding
popular scientific documents is interesting.

4.2 Selective Standard Approach

In the second adaptation, we first build independently word’ context vectors of the two corpora (special-
ized and general) and then, for each word that belongs to the specialized domain corpus, if it appears in
the general domain corpus, we merge its specialized and general context vectors. This allows to filter
general domain words that are not part of the specialized corpus and renders the selective standard ap-

3403



proach much less time consuming than the global standard approach. The merging process carried out
before the normalization of context vectors of the standard approach (see step 1 - Section 2) is done as
follows:

Increasing word co-occurrence counts (Hyp1) if a word wi co-occurs p times with w in the special-
ized domain and q times in the general domain, we simply add the two co-occurrence counts so that
the merged context vector of w will contain wi with a co-occurrence count of p + q.

Reducing the vector space model sparseness (Hyp2) if a word wj co-occurs r times with w in the
general domain but does not co-occur with w in the specialized domain, we add wj to the merged
context vector of w. In that case, wj is considered to be as new information that is added to the
context vector of w to enrich it.

By enhancing word co-occurrence counts, the context vectors of the words become more reliable.
Whereas, by increasing the density of the vector space model, the context vectors of the words be-
come more precise. This twofold strategy enables us to better characterize the words of the specialized
comparable corpus without increasing the number of words to characterize. In this way, the candidate
translations of a word are always selected from the vocabulary of the specialized comparable corpus.

In the same way that Hazem and Morin (2013), we use a general language corpus to make the observed
word co-occurrence counts in a specialized comparable corpus more reliable. Like them, we modify the
initial word co-occurrence counts, but unlike them, we introduce new words learned from the general
corpus in the vector space model.

5 Data and Resources

In this section, we describe the data and resources we used in our experiments which are conducted on
the French/English language pair.

5.1 Comparable Corpora

The specialized comparable corpora were selected in terms of bilingual terminology access of technical
domains. For this purpose, comparable corpora gather texts sharing common features such as domain,
topic, genre, discourse and period without having a source text-target text relationship which guaran-
tees access to the original vocabulary. For our experiments, we used three French/English specialized
comparable corpora:

Breast cancer corpus (BC) is composed of documents collected from the Elsevier website1. We have
selected the documents published between 2001 and 2008 where the title or the keywords contain
cancer du sein in French and breast cancer in English.

Volcanology corpus (VG) was manually built by gathering documents dedicated to volcanology such
as web documents, academic textbooks, popular science books, general newspapers, popular and
semi-popular science magazines, travel magazines, and glossaries.

Wind energy corpus (WE) has been released in the TTC project2. This corpus has been crawled from
the web using Babouk crawler (Groc, 2011) based on several keywords such as vent, énergies,
éolien, renouvelable in French and wind, energy, rotor in English.

In order to evaluate our approach , we explored different types and size of external data. Most of them
are parallel corpora often used in multiple evaluation campaigns such as WMT3. It is to note that we
do not take advantage of the parallel information. Using parallel corpora only insures a good degree of
comparability. We briefly describe each corpus:

Table 1: Characteristics of the specialized corpora and the external data.

News commentary corpus (NC) is a twelve language parallel corpus of news commentaries provided
by the WMT workshop for SMT4.

Europarl corpus (EP7) is a parallel corpus for SMT extracted from the proceedings of the European
Parliament. It contains about 21 languages. We used the French-English version 7 used for the
WMT translation task3

JRC acquis corpus (JRC) is a collection of legislative European union texts4. We used the French-
English aligned version at OPUS provided by JRC (Tiedemann, 2012).

Common crawl corpus (CC) is a petabytes of data collected over 7 years of web crawling set of raw
web page data and text extracts5.

Gigaword corpus (GW) is a set of monolingual newswire corpora provided by LDC6.

United nations corpus (UN) is a six language parallel text of the United Nations originally provided as
translation memory (Rafalovitch and Dale, 2009).

The French/English corpora were then normalized through the following linguistic pre-processing
steps: tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and lemmatization. Finally, the function words were re-
moved and the words occurring less than twice in the French and in the English parts were discarded.
Table 1 shows the size of the comparable corpora and also indicates the comparability degree in percent-
ages (Comp.) between the French and the English parts of each comparable corpus. The comparability
measure (Li and Gaussier, 2010) is based on the expectation of finding the translation for each word
in the corpus and gives a good idea about how two corpora are comparable. We can notice that all the
comparable corpora have a high degree of comparability.

5.2 Bilingual Dictionary

The bilingual dictionary used in our experiments is the French/English dictionary ELRA-M00337. This
resource is a general language dictionary which contains around 244,000 entries.

5.3 Gold Standard

To evaluate the quality of bilingual terminology extraction from comparable corpora, a bilingual termi-
nology reference list that reflects the technical vocabulary of the comparable corpus is required. The

3405



list is usually composed of more or less 100 single words: 95 single words in Chiao and Zweigen-
baum (2002), 100 in Morin et al. (2010), 125 and 79 in Bouamor et al. (2013a). We build a reference list
for each of the three comparable corpora using specialized glossaries available on the Web. For instance,
the list is derived from the UMLS8 for the breast cancer corpus. Concerning wind energy, the list is pro-
vided with the corpus1. In order to focus only on the vocabulary characteristic of the specialized corpus
we remove technical terms that have a common meaning in the general domain such as analysis, factor,
method, result, study, etc. Without this precaution, these terms would be mechanically better identified
in a larger corpus. To discard these terms, we use for French the list of the ScienTexT Project9 and for
English the Academic Keyword List10. Each word of the reference lists appears at least 5 times in the
specialized comparable corpus. The reference lists are composed of 248 terms for breast cancer, 156
terms for volcanology and 139 terms for wind energy.

6 Experiments

Table 2 shows the results of the standard approach (noted SA) using only specialized comparable corpora
(BC, VG and WE) or using only external data (NC, EP7, JRC, CC, GW and UN). It also shows the
two adapted standard approaches (noted GSA and SSA) using the combination of each specialized
comparable corpus with each corpus of the external data. The scores are measured in terms of the Mean
Average Precision (MAP). We also used the three most exploited association and similarity measure
configurations: Mutual Information with Cosine (noted MI-COS), Discounted Odds-Ratio with Cosine
(noted OR-COS) and finally, Log-likelihood with weighted Jaccard (noted LL-JAC).

The first column of Table 2 shows the results of the SA for the three specialized comparable corpora.
We can see that for each corpus the results differ according to a given measure configuration. Overall,
for SA, the best results are obtained using the LL-JAC configuration. The SA for instance obtains a
MAP score of 34.6% using BC corpus and a MAP score of 50.4% using VG corpus.

From the second to the seventh column, Table 2 shows the results of the SA using external data only,
and our two adapted approaches (GSA and SSA). Column four for instance, shows the results of SA
that uses the JRC corpus only. It also shows the results of GSA and SSA that combine the JRC corpus
with each specialized corpus. GSA for instance obtains a MAP score of 63.3% and SSA a MAP score of
66.8% while combining the BC corpus with the JRC corpus (MI-COS configuration). Comparatively,
and for the same configuration, SA using JRC corpus only, obtains a MAP score of 53.2%.

The first comment concerns the SA where surprisingly, using external data only, almost always im-
proves its performance. This is particularly noticed when using external data of large size such as CC,
GW and UN corpora. The good results obtained using these latter corpora can be explained by their
characteristics. The Common crawl corpus (CC) for instance which has been crawled from the web,
contains many scientific and specialized documents that can improve context representation. In addition,
its large size makes co-occurrence counts more reliable. According to Table 3 we can see that more than
90% of the distinct words of the specialized corpora are present in the large general domain corpora.

The second comment concerns GSA and SSA where both always outperform SA for all the config-
urations. For the BC corpus for instance, we can notice that GSA obtains a MAP score of 81.5% and
SSA obtains a MAP score of 83.4% using the GW corpus (LL-JAC configuration) while SA obtains
a MAP score of 34.6% using BC and a MAP score of 78.3% using the GW corpus. Using other ex-
ternal data also improves the results of SA using the BC corpus. For instance, SSA obtains a MAP
score of 65.9% using JRC, 57.5% using EP7 and 57.8% using NC. This means that adding external data
always benefits bilingual lexicon extraction. If both GSA and SSA always improve bilingual lexicon
extraction for the three specialized corpora, the results of Table 2 show that SSA outperforms GSA for
almost all the configurations. This means that enriching the words that belong to the specialized domain
corpus, if they appear in the general domain corpus (by merging context vectors) is more efficient than
using a global combination (GSA). In addition, it should be noted that SSA is much faster than GSA.

Table 3: Number of distinct context vectors that have been augmented (enriched).

SSA translation candidates are those of the specialized domain only (around 6,600 candidates for the
BC corpus) and GSA translation candidates are those of the specialized domain plus those of the gen-
eral domain (around 250,000 candidates for CC corpus - see Table 1) which render the computation of
vector similarity much more time consuming. Overall, we can see that the results differ according to
the configuration measures used. If for SA, the best results are always obtained using LL-JAC, this is
not the case for GSA and SSA. For the BC corpus for instance, SSA obtains the highest MAP score
of 85.6% using GW and the MI-COS configuration while for the VG corpus combined with GW, we
can see that the best MAP score of 78.8% is obtained by SSA using the OR-COS configuration. These
differences are mainly due to the measure properties. If the MI measure shows poor results on small
corpora, it is mainly because it overestimates low counts and underestimates high counts. This disad-
vantage is smoothed when using more data. The differences between MI and OR measures are too low
to conclude which is the most appropriate one to use as we obtain more or less equivalent results for the
used corpora.

Table 3 shows the number of distinct words of each specialized corpus that have been enriched using
each general-domain corpus. Hyp1 corresponds to the first hypothesis of SSA in which we assume
that only the context vectors of the specialized corpora should be enriched. So the Hyp1 column shows
the number of distinct words that appear in both the specialized and the general domain corpora. For
instance, Hyp1 of the BC corpus and the NC corpus noted BC+NC, shows that there are 4,315 words in
common for their English parts and 3,939 in common for their French parts. One can notice that a high
amount of specialized context vectors are enriched thanks to general-domain corpus. Hyp2 corresponds
to the mean of the number of new words that have been added to each context vector of the specialized
domain words. For instance, Hyp2 for BC+NC shows that in average we add 746 new English words
and 721 new French words for each context vector of the BC corpus. Here also we can see that many
new words are added to the specialized context vectors. The experimental results previously shown in
Table 2 confirm the usefulness of Hyp1 and Hyp2.

7 Conclusion

We have shown in this article how the problem of adding external data could be achieved for improving
bilingual lexicon extraction from specialized comparable corpora. We have proposed two approaches that
use external data in an adapted way to preserve the original vocabulary. Even if our selective standard
approach goes against the mainstream which states that adding out-of-domain data decreases the quality
of bilingual lexicons, we never denature the initial specialized comparable corpus. The results obtained

by the selective standard approach show significant improvements for alignment of single-word terms
while using any of the external data and confirm the usefulness of exploiting as much data as we have to
better characterize context vector representation and thus bilingual lexicon extraction.
