Abstract 

Word Ordering Errors (WOEs) are the most frequent type of grammatical errors at sentence 
level for non-native Chinese language learners. Learners taking Chinese as a foreign language 
often place character(s) in the wrong places in sentences, and that results in wrong word(s) or 
ungrammatical sentences. Besides, there are no clear word boundaries in Chinese sentences. 
That makes WOEs detection and correction more challenging. In this paper, we propose 
methods to detect and correct WOEs in Chinese sentences. Conditional random fields (CRFs) 
based WOEs detection models identify the sentence segments containing WOEs. Segment 
point-wise mutual information (PMI), inter-segment PMI difference, language model, tag of 
the previous segment, and CRF bigram template are explored. Words in the segments contain-
ing WOEs are reordered to generate candidates that may have correct word orderings.  Rank-
ing SVM based models rank the candidates and suggests the most proper corrections. Train-
ing and testing sets are selected from HSK dynamic composition corpus created by Beijing 
Language and Culture University. Besides the HSK WOE dataset, Google Chinese Web 5-
gram corpus is used to learn features for WOEs detection and correction. The best model 
achieves an accuracy of 0.834 for detecting WOEs in sentence segments. On the average, the 
correct word orderings are ranked 4.8 among 184.48 candidates. 

1 Introduction 
Detection and correction of grammatical errors are practical for many applications such as document 
editing and language learning. Non-native language learners usually encounter problems in learning a 
new foreign language and are prone to generate ungrammatical sentences. Sentences with various 
types of errors are written by language learners of different backgrounds. In the HSK corpus, which 
contains compositions of students from different countries who study Chinese in Beijing Language 
and Culture University (http://nlp.blcu.edu.cn/online-systems/hsk-language-lib-indexing-system.html), 
there are 35,884 errors at sentence level. The top 10 error types and their occurrences are listed below: 
Word Ordering Errors (WOE) (8,515), Missing Component (Adverb) (3,244), Missing Component 
(Predicate) (3,018), Grammatical Error (“Is … DE”) (2,629), Missing Component (Subject) (2,405), 
Missing Component (Head Noun) (2364), Grammatical Error (“Is” sentence) (1,427), Redundant 
Component (Predicate) (1,130), Uncompleted Sentence (1,052), and Redundant Component (Adverb) 
(1,051). WOEs are the most frequent type of errors (Yu and Chen, 2012). 

The types of WOEs in Chinese are different from those in English. A Chinese character has its own 
meaning in text, while individual characters are meaningless in English. Learners taking Chinese as a 
foreign language often place character(s) in the wrong places in sentences, and that results in wrong 
word(s) or ungrammatical sentences. Besides, there are no clear word boundaries in Chinese sentences.

Word segmentation is fundamental in Chinese language processing (Huang and Zhao, 2007). WOEs 
may result in wrong segmentation. That may make WOEs detection and correction more challenging. 

This paper aims at identifying the positions of WOEs in the text written by non-native Chinese lan-
guage learners, and proposes candidates to correct the errors. It is organized as follows. Section 2 sur-
veys the related work. Section 3 gives an overview of the study. Section 4 introduces the dataset used 
for training and testing. Sections 5 and 6 propose models to detect and correct Chinese WOEs, respec-
tively. Section 7 concludes this study and propose some future work. 

2 Related Work 
There are only a few researches on the topic of detection and correction of WOEs in Chinese language 
until now. We survey the related work from the four aspects: (1) grammatical errors made by non-
native Chinese learners, (2) word ordering errors in Chinese language, (3) computer processing of 
grammatical errors in Chinese language, and (4) grammatical error correction in other languages.  

Leacock et al. (2014) give thorough surveys in automated grammatical error detection for language 
learners. Error types, available corpora, evaluation methods, and approaches for different types of er-
rors are specified. Several shared tasks on grammatical error correction in English have been orga-
nized in recent years, including HOO 2011 (Dale and Kilgarriff, 2011), HOO 2012 (Dale et al., 2012) 
and CoNLL 2013 (Ng et al., 2013). Different types of grammatical errors are focused: (1) HOO 2011: 
article and preposition errors, (2) HOO 2012: determiner and preposition errors, and (3) CoNLL 2013: 
article or determiner errors, preposition errors, noun number errors, verb form errors, and subject-verb 
agreement errors. In Chinese, spelling check evaluation was held at SIGHAN Bake-off 2013 (Wu et 
al., 2013). However, none of the above evaluations deals with word ordering errors. 

Wang (2011) focuses on the Chinese teaching for native English-speaking students. He shows the 
most frequent grammatical errors made by foreigners are missing components, word orderings and 
sentence structures. One major learning problem of foreign learners is the influence of negative trans-
fer of mother tongue. Lin (2011) studies the biased errors of word order in Chinese written by foreign 
students in the HSK corpus. Sun (2011) compares the word orderings between English and Chinese to 
figure out the differences in sentence structures. Yu and Chen (2012) propose classifiers to detect sen-
tences containing WOEs, but they do not deal with where WOEs are and how to correct them. 

Wagner et al. (2007) deal with common grammatical errors in English. They consider frequencies 
of POS n-grams and the outputs of parsers as features. Gamon et al. (2009) identify and correct errors 
made by non-native English writers. They first detect article and preposition errors, and then apply 
different techniques to correct each type of errors. Huang et al. (2010) propose a correction rule ex-
traction model trained from 310,956 sets of erroneous and corrected pairwise sentences. Some studies 
related to word orderings are specific to the topic of pre-processing or post-processing of statistical 
machine translation, such as Galley and Manning (2008), Setiawan et al. (2009), and DeNero and 
Uszkoreit (2011). 

The major contributions of this paper cover the following aspects: (1) application aspect: detecting 
and correcting a common type of Chinese written errors of foreign learners with HSK corpus; (2) lan-
guage aspect: considering the effects of words and segments in Chinese sentences; and (3) resource 
aspect: exploring the feasibility of using a Chinese web n-gram corpus in WOE detection/correction. 

3 Overview of a Chinese Word Ordering Detection and Correction System 
Figure 1 sketches an overview of our Chinese WOE detection and correction system. It is composed of 
three major parts, including dataset preparation, WOE detection, and WOE correction. At first, a cor-
pus is prepared. Sentences containing WOEs are selected from the corpus and corrected by two Chi-
nese native speakers. This corpus will be used for training and testing. Then, a sentence is segmented 
into a sequence of words, and chunked into several segments based on punctuation marks. Regarding 
words and segments as fundamental units reduce the number of reordering and limit the reordering 
scope. The segments containing WOEs are identified by using CRF-based models. Finally, the candi-
dates are generated by reordering and ranked by Ranking SVM-based models. To examine the per-
formance of WOE correction, two datasets, Cans and Csys, consisting of error segments labelled by hu-
man and detected by our system, respectively, are employed.

The example shown below demonstrates the major steps.  This sentence is composed of three seg-

ments.  The second segment contains a WOE, i.e., 今年夏天毕业了大学 (Graduated college this 
summer). The correct sentence should be  今年夏天大学毕业了 (Graduated from college this sum-
mer).  

(1) Reduce the number of reordering units in a sentence by using word segmentation. 

我 叫 王大安 ， 今年 夏天 毕业 了 大学 ， 现在 找 工作 。

( I  / am /Wang Daan/  , /this         /summer  /graduated/le  /college   /,     /now       /look for/job    /.) 

(2) Chunk a sentence into segments by punctuation marks. 

我 叫 王大安 ， 今年 夏天 毕业 了 大学 ， 现在 找 工作 。

(3) Detect the possible segments containing WOEs in a sentence by CRF-based methods. 

我 叫 王大安 ， 今年 夏天 毕业 了 大学 ， 现在 找 工作 。

(4) Reorder words in an erroneous segment and generate candidates. 

我 叫 王大安 ， 今年 夏天 毕业 大学 了 ， 现在 找 工作 。

  … 

我 叫 王大安 ， 今年 夏天 大学 毕业 了 ， 现在 找 工作 。

(5) Rank candidates and suggest correct word ordering by Ranking SVM-based methods.

4 A Word Ordering Errors (WOEs) Corpus 
HSK dynamic composition corpus created by Beijing Language and Culture University is adopted.  It 
contains the Chinese composition articles written by non-native Chinese learners.  There are 11,569 
articles and 4.24 million characters in 29 composition topics.  Composition articles are scanned into 
text and annotated with tags of error types ranging from character level, word level, sentence level, to 
discourse level.  There are 35,884 errors at sentence level, and WOEs are the most frequent type at this 
level.  Total 8,515 sentences are annotated with WOEs.  We filter out sentences with multiple error 
types and remove duplicate sentences. Total 1,150 error sentences with WOEs remain for this study. 

Two Chinese native speakers are asked to correct the 1,150 sentences.  Only reordering operation is 
allowed during correction.  A dataset composed of 1,150 sets of original sentence S and its two correc-
tions A1 and A2 is formed for training and testing in the experiments.  A1 may be different from A2.  
The following shows an example.  Without context, either A1 or A2 is acceptable. 

S:   她我们兄弟姊妹鼓励学音乐和外语。 
      (She we encouraged to study music and foreign languages.) 
A1: 我们兄弟姊妹鼓励她学音乐和外语。 
      (We encouraged her to study music and foreign languages.) 
A2: 她鼓励我们兄弟姊妹学音乐和外语。 
      (She encouraged us to study music and foreign languages.) 

In some cases, A1 and/or A2 may be equal to S.  That is, the annotators may think S is correct.  That 
may happen when context is not available.  Finally, 327 of 1,150 sets contain different corrections.  
Both A1 and A2 are equal to S in 27 sets. Total 47 sentences corrected by one annotator are the same 
as the original sentences, and total 65 sentences corrected by another annotator are the same as the 
original sentences.  This corpus is available at http://nlg.csie.ntu.edu.tw/nlpresource/woe_corpus/. 

Figure 2 shows the Damerau Levenshtein distance between the original sentences S and the correc-
tions A1 and A2.  It counts the minimum number of operations needed to transform a source string 
into a target one.  Here the operation is the transposition of two adjacent characters.  Total 823 sets of 
A1 and A2 have a distance of 0.  It means 71.5% of sentences have the same corrections by the two 
Chinese native speakers.  The distances between S and A1 are similar to those between S and A2. To-
tal 850 sets of original sentences and the corrections have a distance below 10 characters and 1,014 
sets of sentences have a distance below 20.  We can also observe that the number of sentences with 
even distances is larger than that of sentences with odd distances because most of the Chinese words 
are composed of two characters.

5 Detection of Word Ordering Errors 
This section first defines the fundamental units for error detection, then introduces the error detection 
models along with their features, and finally presents and discusses the experimental results. 

5.1 Fundamental Units for Reordering 
Permutation is an intuitive way to find out the correct orderings, but its cost is very high. Unrestrictive 
permutation will generate too many candidates to be acceptable in computation time.  What units to be 
reordered in what range under what condition has be considered. Chinese is different from English in 
that characters are the smallest meaningful units, and there are no clear word boundaries.  Computa-
tion cost and segmentation performance is a trade-off to select character or word as a reordering unit. 
On the one hand, using words as the reordering units will reduce the number of candidates generated. 
On the other hand, word segmentation results will affect the performance of WOE detection and cor-
rection.  The following two examples show that reordering the words cannot generate the correct an-
swers. In these two examples, a word in the original sentence (S) is segmented into two words in the 
correct sentence (A). These words are underlined. Because a word is regarded as a unit for reordering, 
the correct sentence cannot be generated by word reordering only in these two cases. 

S:  他 / 教给 / 学生们 / 英语 /。 
      (He / teach to / students / English / .) 
A: 他 / 给 / 学生们 / 教 / 英语 / 。 
      (He / for / students / teach / English / .) 
S:  最近 / 我 / 开始 / 学 / 中国 / 的 / 做菜。 
      (Recently / I / start to / learn / China / ‘s / cooking cuisine.) 
A: 最近 / 我 / 开始 / 学 / 做 / 中国 / 的 / 菜。 
      (Recently / I / start to / learn / cooking / China / ‘s /cuisine.) 

Total 76 sets of sentences belong to such cases. They occupy 6% of the experimental dataset. Consid-
ering the benefits of words, we still adopt words as reordering units in the following experiments.   

To prevent reordering all the words in the original sentences, we further divide a sentence into seg-
ments based on comma, caesura mark, semi-colon, colon, exclamation mark, question mark, and full 
stop. Sentence segments containing WOEs will be detected and words will be reordered within the 
segments to generate the candidates for correction.  In our dataset, there are only 31 sets of sentences 
(i.e., 2.7%) with WOEs across segments.  The following shows two examples. The underlined words 
are moved to other segments. 

S: 其实，我还是做事情的时候，不怎么老实。 
   (In fact, when I am still working, I am not honest.) 
A: 其实，我做事情的时候，还是不怎么老实。 
   (In fact, when I am working, I am still not honest.) 
S: 所以有绝对的导游工作经验，无须再培训。 
    (Therefore we have absolute guide work experience, we do not need retraining.) 
A: 有绝对的导游工作经验，所以无须再培训。 
    (We have absolute guide work experience, therefore we do not need retraining.) 

In summary, the upper bound of the correction performance would be 91.3%.  That is, 6%+2.7% of 
sentences cannot be resolved. 

5.2 Word Ordering Errors Detection Models 
Conditional random fields (CRFs) (Lafferty, 2001) are used to implement the WOE detection in sen-
tence segments. Segments with WOEs are labelled with answer tags before training. The original sen-
tence S written by non-native Chinese learner is compared with the annotated correct sentence A. 
Characters are compared from the start and the end of sentences, respectively. The positions are 
marked ERRstart and ERRend once the characters are different. All words within ERRstart and ERRend are 
marked ERRrange. The longest common subsequence (LCS) within ERRrange of S and ERRrange of A are 
excluded from ERRrange and the remaining words are marked ERRwords.  Figure 3 shows an example.  
We use BIO encoding (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) to label segments with WOEs. Segments contain-

283



ing words in ERRwords are defined to be segments with WOEs. The leftmost segment with WOEs is 
tagged B, and the following segment with WOEs are tagged I. Those segments without WOEs are 
tagged O. 
 

 
Figure 3: An example for ERRrange and ERRwords. 

 
Table 1 lists the distribution of B, I and O segments. Recall that two Chinese native speakers are 

asked to correct the 1,150 sentences, thus we have two sets of B-I-O tagging.   
 

Tagging B Tag I Tag O Tag Total 
Statistics #Segments Percentage #Segments Percentage #Segments Percentage Segments
Annotator 1 1111 40.6% 53 1.9% 1572 57.5% 2736 
Annotator 2 1097 40.1% 59 2.2% 1580 57.7% 2736 

Table 1: Distribution of B, I, and O segments. 
 
Five features are proposed as follows for CRF training. Google Chinese Web 5-gram corpus (Liu, 

Yang and Lin, 2010) is adopted to get the frequencies of Chinese words for fPMI, fDiff and fLM. 
(1) Segment Pointwise Mutual Information (fPMI) 

PMI(Segi) defined below measures the coherence of a segment Segi by calculating PMI of all 
word bigrams in Segi. To avoid the bias from different lengths, the sum of PMI of all word bi-
grams is divided by n-1 for normalization, where n denotes the segment length. The segment 
PMI values are partitioned into intervals by equal frequency discretization. Feature fPMI of the 
segment Segi reflects the label of the interval to which PMI(Segi) belongs. 

 
(2) Inter-segment PMI Difference (fDiff) 

Feature fDiff captures the PMI difference between two segments Segj-1 and Segj. It aims to meas-
ure the coherence between segments. The feature setting is also based on equal frequency dis-
cretization.  

(3) Language Model (fLM) 
Feature fLM uses bigram language model to measure the log probability of the words in a seg-
ment defined below. Labels of interval are also determined by equal frequency discretization. 

 
(4) Tag of the previous segment (fTag) 

Feature fTag reflects the tag B, I or O of the previous segment. 
(5) CRF bigram template (fB) 

Feature fB is a bigram template given by SGD-CRF tool1.  Bigram template combines the tags of 
the previous segment and current segment, and generates T*T*N feature functions, where T is 
number of tags and N is number of strings expanded with a macro.

5.3 Results and Discussion 
WOE detection models will annotate the segments of a sentence with labels B, I or O. These labels 
will determine which segments may contain WOEs. In the experiments, we use 5-fold cross-validation 
to evaluate the proposed models. Performance for detecting WOEs is measured at the segment and the 
sentence levels, respectively. The metrics at the segment level are defined as follows.  Here set nota-
tion is adopted. The symbol |S| denotes the number of elements in the set S which is derived by the 
logical formula after vertical bar. TAGpred(SEG) and TAGans(SEG) mean the labels of segment SEG 
tagged by WOE detection model and human, respectively.  The symbol m denotes total number of 
segments in the test set. 

 

 

 

 

 
 

The metrics at the sentence level are defined as follows: 
	

 

 
Accuracy and F1-score measure whether the models can find out segments with WOEs. Correcta-

ble Rate of sentences measures whether it is possible that the candidates of the correct word order can 
be generated by the WOE correction models. If a segment without WOEs is misjudged to be erroneous, 
the word order still has a chance to be kept by the WOE correction models. However, if a segment 
with WOEs is misjudged to be correct, words in the misjudged segment will not be reordered in the 
correction part because the error correction module is not triggered.  A sentence is said to be “correct-
able” if no segments in it are misjudged as “correct”. The ratio of the “correctable” sentences is con-
sidered as a metric at the sentence level.  

Table 2 shows the performance of WOE detection. Five models are compared. We regard tagging 
all the segments with the labels B and O respectively as two baselines. Clearly, the recall at the seg-
ment level and the correctable rate at the sentence level are 1 by the all-tag-B baseline.  However, its 
accuracy at the segment and the sentence levels are low. The all-tag-O baseline has better accuracy at 
the segment level than the all-tag-B baseline, but has very bad F1-score, i.e., 0. The proposed models 
are much better than the two baselines. Among the feature combinations, fPMI fDiff fTag fB show the best 
performance. The accuracy at the segment level is 0.834, and the correctable rate is 0.883.  The best 
detection result will be sent for further correction.

6 Correction of Word Ordering Errors 
This section deals with generating and ranking candidates to correct WOEs. Two datasets, Cans and Csys, 
are explored in the experiments. We evaluate the optimal performance of the WOE correction models 
with the Cans dataset, and evaluate WOE detection and correction together with the Csys dataset. 

6.1 Candidate Generation 
Instead of direct permutation, we consider three strategies shown as follows to correct the error sen-
tences. The complexity of generating candidates by permutation is O(n!). The complexity of using 
these three strategies decreases to O(n2). 

(1) Reorder single unit (Rsingle) 
Rsingle strategy reorders only one reordering unit (i.e., a word) to n-1 positions within a 
segment containing n words. Total (n-1)2 candidates can be generated by this strategy. The 
following shows an example. 

S:  今天 / 学校 / 去 
     (Today / school / go to) 

A: 今天 / 去 / 学校 
 (Today / go to / school) 

(2) Reorder bi-word (Rbi-word) 
Rbi-word is similar to Rsingle, but two reordering units are merged into a new word before re-
ordering. Because n-1 bi-words can be generated in a segment and n-2 positions are avail-
able for each merged bi-word, (n-1)(n-2) candidates are generated by Rbi-word. The follow-
ing shows an example. 

  S:  早/就/一家/公司/找/我/工作 
                      (before / already / one / company / employ / me / work) 

A:  一家/公司/早/就/找/我/工作 
          (one / company / before / already / employ / me / work) 

(3) Reorder tri-word (Rtri-word) 
Rtri-word works similarly to Rbi-word, but three reordering units are merged before reordering. 
Total (n-2)(n-3) candidates are generated by Rtri-word. The following shows an example. 

S: 我/需要/工作/的/经验/在/您/的/公司。 
           (I / need / working / (de) / experience / in / your / (de) / company.) 

A: 我/需要/在/您/的/公司/工作/的/经验。 
          (I / need / in / your / (de) / company / working / (de) / experience.) 

Table 3 shows the recall rate of each candidate generation strategy.  With the Cans dataset, correct 
word ordering can be generated for 85.8% of the original sentences by fusing Rsingle, Rbi-word and Rtri-word. 
The candidates generated by using the Csys dataset cover 69.7% of the correct word orderings. The dif-
ference would probably be due to the error propagation of word ordering error detection specified in 
Section 5.3. Furthermore, 6% of correct word orderings are unable to be generated by using the reor-
dering units due to the word segmentation issue as mentioned in Section 5.1. We can also find that 
72.3% of sentences with WOEs can be corrected by the Rsingle strategy using the Cans dataset. It means 
most of the WOEs made by non-native Chinese learners can be corrected by moving only one word. 

 
Strategy\Dataset Cans Csys 

Rsingle  0.723 0.577 
Rbi-word 0.365 0.308 
Rtri-word 0.239 0.217 
Rsingle ∪ Rbi-word ∪ Rtri-word 0.858 0.697 

Table 3: Recall of candidate generation strategies 

6.2 Candidate Ranking 
We use Ranking SVM (Joachims, 2002) for candidates ranking. Because WOEs may produce abnor-
mal POS sequence, POS bigrams and POS trigrams are considered as features for Ranking SVM. We 

286



use a k-tuple feature vector for each candidate sentence, where k is the number of features. In each di-
mension, binary weight is assigned: 1 if the feature exists in a candidate, and 0 otherwise. Score for 
each candidate is assigned by a binary classifier: 1 if the candidate is the same as either of the annotat-
ed corrections, and 0 otherwise. 

6.3 Results and Discussion 
Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) defined below is used for performance evaluation. The reciprocal rank 
is the multiplicative inverse of the rank of the first correct answer. MRR is the mean of reciprocal rank 
for all sentences S, value from 0 to 1. The larger MRR means the correct answer more closes to the top 
ranking. 

 
Percentage of answers having rank 1 is another metric. Five-fold cross-validation is used for training 
and testing. In the Cans and Csys datasets, 182.03 and 184.48 candidates are proposed by the approach 
of fusing the results of Rsingle, Rbi-word, and Rtri-word on the average.  Experimental results are listed in 
Table 4. The proposed candidate ranking method achieves an MRR of 0.270 in the Cans dataset. It 
means the correct candidates are ranked 3.7 on the average. In contrast, the MRR by using the Csys da-
taset is 0.208. It means the correct candidates are ranked 4.8 on the average when error detection and 
correction are performed in pipelining. 
 

Metric\Dataset Cans Csys 
MRR 0.270 0.208 

% of rank 1 0.195 0.144 
Table 4: Performance of candidate ranking 

 
There are some major types of errors shown as follows in WOE correction. 
(1) Word ordering errors across segments 

Section 5.1 mentions there are 31 sets of sentences (i.e., 2.7%) with WOEs across segments.  
Our algorithm cannot capture such kinds of sentences. 

(2) Propagation errors from candidate generation 
Table 3 shows the recall of word ordering error detection using the Cans dataset is 0.858. Be-
sides, 6% of sentences mentioned in Section 5.1 cannot be reordered to correct word ordering 
due to word segmentation issue. 

(3) Limitation of our models 
In the fused n-gram models, only one n-gram can be moved. It reduces the number of candi-
dates to be generated, but some types of reorderings are missed.  An example is shown as fol-
lows.  The 2-gram 出生 / 于 (was born in) and the unigram 于 (on) have to be exchanged. 

S：我 / 出生 / 于 / 1968 年 10 月 25 日 / 在 / 维也纳。 
           (I / was born / in / 25 October 1968 / on / Vienna.) 

A：我 / 在 / 1968 年 10 月 25 日 / 出生 / 于 / 维也纳。 
         (I / on / 25 October 1968 / was born / in / Vienna.) 

7 Conclusion 
In this paper, we consider words as the reordering units in WOE detection and correction. Sentences 
are chunked into segments based on punctuation marks and the CRF technique is used to detect seg-
ments that possibly contain WOEs. The best error detection model achieves an accuracy of 0.834. 
Three reordering strategies are further proposed to generate candidates with correct word ordering and 
reduce the numerous number of candidates generated by permutation. If the segments containing 
WOEs are known, 85.8% of correct sentences can be generated by our approach. Finally, Ranking 
SVM orders the generated candidates based on POS bigrams and POS trigrams features, and achieves 
an MRR of 0.270 when all erroneous segments are given and an MRR of 0.208 when both detection 
and correction modules are considered.

Using words as the reordering unit reduces the cost to generate numerous candidates, but 6% of sen-
tences are unable to reorder due to the word segmentation issue. How to balance the trade-off has to be 
investigated further. In the candidate ranking, selection of proper weights for POS bigram and trigram 
features may improve the ranking performance. Since the corpus of WOEs in Chinese is still in a lim-
ited size, expanding the related corpus for further research is also indispensable.
