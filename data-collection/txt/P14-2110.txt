Abstract

Code-switched documents are common
in social media, providing evidence for
polylingual topic models to infer aligned
topics across languages. We present
Code-Switched LDA (csLDA), which in-
fers language specific topic distributions
based on code-switched documents to fa-
cilitate multi-lingual corpus analysis. We
experiment on two code-switching cor-
pora (English-Spanish Twitter data and
English-Chinese Weibo data) and show
that csLDA improves perplexity over
LDA, and learns semantically coherent
aligned topics as judged by human anno-
tators.

1 Introduction

Topic models (Blei et al., 2003) have become stan-
dard tools for analyzing document collections, and
topic analyses are quite common for social media
(Paul and Dredze, 2011; Zhao et al., 2011; Hong
and Davison, 2010; Ramage et al., 2010; Eisen-
stein et al., 2010). Their popularity owes in part to
their data driven nature, allowing them to adapt to
new corpora and languages. In social media espe-
cially, there is a large diversity in terms of both the
topic and language, necessitating the modeling of
multiple languages simultaneously. A good candi-
date for multi-lingual topic analyses are polylin-
gual topic models (Mimno et al., 2009), which
learn topics for multiple languages, creating tuples
of language specific distributions over monolin-
gual vocabularies for each topic. Polylingual topic
models enable cross language analysis by group-
ing documents by topic regardless of language.

Training of polylingual topic models requires
parallel or comparable corpora: document tuples
from multiple languages that discuss the same
topic. While additional non-aligned documents

glish.

can be folded in during training, the “glue” doc-
uments are required to aid in the alignment across
languages. However, the ever changing vocabu-
lary and topics of social media (Eisenstein, 2013)
make finding suitable comparable corpora diffi-
cult. Standard techniques – such as relying on ma-
chine translation parallel corpora or comparable
documents extracted from Wikipedia in different
languages – fail to capture the specific terminol-
ogy of social media. Alternate methods that rely
on bilingual lexicons (Jagarlamudi and Daumé,
2010) similarly fail to adapt to shifting vocabular-
ies. The result: an inability to train polylingual
models on social media.

In this paper, we offer a solution: utilize code-
switched social media to discover correlations
across languages. Social media is filled with ex-
amples of code-switching, where users switch be-
tween two or more languages, both in a conversa-
tion and even a single message (Ling et al., 2013).
This mixture of languages in the same context sug-
gests alignments between words across languages
through the common topics discussed in the con-
text.

We learn from code-switched social media by
extending the polylingual topic model framework
to infer the language of each token and then auto-
matically processing the learned topics to identify
aligned topics. Our model improves both in terms
of perplexity and a human evaluation, and we pro-
vide some example analyses of social media that
rely on our learned topics.

2 Code-Switching

Code-switched documents has received consider-
able attention in the NLP community. Several
tasks have focused on identification and analysis,
including mining translations in code-switched
documents (Ling et al., 2013), predicting code-
switched points (Solorio and Liu, 2008a), identi-
fying code-switched tokens (Lignos and Marcus,
2013; Yu et al., 2012; Elfardy and Diab, 2012),
adding code-switched support to language mod-
els (Li and Fung, 2012), linguistic processing of
code switched data (Solorio and Liu, 2008b), cor-
pus creation (Li et al., 2012; Diab and Kamboj,
2011), and computational linguistic analyses and
theories of code-switching (Sankofl, 1998; Joshi,
1982).

Code-switching specifically in social media has
also received some recent attention. Lignos and
Marcus (2013) trained a supervised token level
language identification system for Spanish and
English code-switched social media to study code-
switching behaviors. Ling et al. (2013) mined
translation spans for Chinese and English in code-
switched documents to improve a translation sys-
tem, relying on an existing translation model to aid
in the identification and extraction task. In contrast
to this work, we take an unsupervised approach,
relying only on readily available document level
language ID systems to utilize code-switched data.
Additionally, our focus is not on individual mes-
sages, rather we aim to train a model that can be
used to analyze entire corpora.

In this work we consider two types of code-
switched documents: single messages and conver-
sations, and two language pairs: Chinese-English
and Spanish-English. Figure 1 shows an exam-
ple of a code-switched Spanish-English conversa-
tion, in which three users discuss Mexico’s foot-
ball team advancing to the Gold medal game in
the 2012 Summer Olympics. In this conversation,
some tweets are code-switched and some are in a
single language. By collecting the entire conver-
sation into a single document we provide the topic
model with additional content. An example of a
Chinese-English code-switched messages is given
by Ling et al. (2013):

watup Kenny Mayne!! - Kenny Mayne
最近这么样啊!!

Here a user switches between languages in a single
message. We empirically evaluate our model on

both conversations and messages. In the model
presentation we will refer to both as “documents.”

3 csLDA

To train a polylingual topic model on social me-
dia, we make two modifications to the model of
Mimno et al. (2009): add a token specific language
variable, and a process for identifying aligned top-
ics.

First, polylingual topic models require paral-
lel or comparable corpora in which each docu-
ment has an assigned language. In the case of
code-switched social media data, we require a per-
token language variable. However, while docu-
ment level language identification (LID) systems
are common place, very few languages have per-
token LID systems (King and Abney, 2013; Lig-
nos and Marcus, 2013).

To address the lack of available LID systems,
we add a per-token latent language variable to the
polylingual topic model. For documents that are
not code-switched, we observe these variables to
be the output of a document level LID system. In
the case of code-switched documents, these vari-
ables are inferred during model inference.

Second, polylingual topic models assume the
aligned topics are from parallel or comparable cor-
pora, which implicitly assumes that a topics pop-
ularity is balanced across languages. Topics that
show up in one language necessarily show up in
another. However, in the case of social media,
we can make no such assumption. The topics
discussed are influenced by users, time, and lo-
cation, all factors intertwined with choice of lan-
guage. For example, English speakers will more
likely discuss Olympic basketball while Spanish
speakers football. There may be little or no docu-
ments on a given topic in one language, while they
are plentiful in another. In this case, a polylin-
gual topic model, which necessarily infers a topic-
specific word distribution for each topic in each
language, would learn two unrelated word dis-
tributions in two languages for a single topic.
Therefore, naively using the produced topics as
“aligned” across languages is ill-advised.

Our solution is to automatically identify aligned
polylingual topics after learning by examining
a topic’s distribution across code-switched docu-
ments. Our metric relies on distributional proper-
ties of an inferred topic across the entire collec-
tion.

675



To summarize, based on the model of Mimno et
al. (2009) we will learn:

• For each topic, a language specific word distri-
bution.

• For each (code-switched) token, a language.
• For each topic, an identification as to whether

the topic captures an alignment across lan-
guages.

The first two goals are achieved by incorporat-
ing new hidden variables in the traditional polylin-
gual topic model. The third goal requires an auto-
mated post-processing step. We call the resulting
model Code-Switched LDA (csLDA). The gener-
ative process is as follows:
• For each topic z ∈ T

• For each language l ∈ L
• Draw word distribution
φlz∼Dir(βl)

• For each document d ∈ D:
• Draw a topic distribution θd ∼ Dir(α)
• Draw a language distribution
ψd∼Dir(γ)
• For each token i ∈ d:
• Draw a topic zi ∼ θd
• Draw a language li ∼ ψd
• Draw a word wi ∼ φlz

For monolingual documents, we fix li to the LID
tag for all tokens. Additionally, we use a single
background distribution for each language to cap-
ture stopwords; a control variable π, which fol-
lows a Dirichlet distribution with prior parameter-
ized by δ, is introduced to decide the choice be-
tween background words and topic words follow-
ing (Chemudugunta et al., 2006)1. We use asym-
metric Dirichlet priors (Wallach et al., 2009), and
let the optimization process learn the hyperparam-
eters. The graphical model is shown in Figure 2.

3.1 Inference
Inference for csLDA follows directly from LDA.
A Gibbs sampler learns the word distributions φlz
for each language and topic. We use a block Gibbs
sampler to jointly sample topic and language vari-
ables for each token. As is customary, we collapse
out φ, θ and ψ. The sampling posterior is:

P (zi, li|w, z−i, l−i, α, β, γ) ∝
(nl,zwi)−i + β

nl,z−i +Wβ
× m

z,d
−i + α

md−i + T α
× o

l,d
−i + γ

od−i + Lγ

where (nl,zwi)−i is the number of times the type for
word wi assigned to topic z and language l (ex-

−i is the number of

tokens assigned to topic z in document d (exclud-
ing current word wi), o

l,d
−i is the number of tokens

assigned to language l in document d (excluding
current word wi), and these variables with super-
scripts or subscripts omitted are totals across all
values for the variable. W is the number of words
in the corpus. All counts omit words assigned
to the background. During sampling, words are
first assigned to the background/topic distribution
and then topic and language are sampled for non-
background words.

We optimize the hyperparameters α, β, γ and δ
by interleaving sampling iterations with a Newton-
Raphson update to obtain the MLE estimate for
the hyperparameters. Taking α as an example, one
step of the Newton-Raphson update is:

αnew = αold −H−1∂L
∂α

(2)

where H is the Hessian matrix and ∂L∂α is the gra-
dient of the likelihood function with respect to
the optimizing hyperparameter. We interleave 200
sampling iterations with one Newton-Raphson up-
date.

3.2 Selecting Aligned Topics

We next identify learned topics (a set of related
word-distributions) that truly represent an aligned
topic across languages, as opposed to an unrelated
set of distributions for which there is no support-
ing alignment evidence in the corpus. We begin by
measuring how often each topic occurs in code-
switched documents. If a topic never occurs in
a code-switched document, then there can be no
evidence to support alignment across languages.
For the topics that appear at least once in a code-
switched document, we estimate their probability

676



in the code-switched documents by a MAP esti-
mate of θ. Topics appearing in at least one code-
switched document with probability greater than
a threshold p are selected as candidates for true
cross-language topics.

4 Data

We used two datasets: a Sina Weibo Chinese-
English corpus (Ling et al., 2013) and a Spanish-
English Twitter corpus.

Weibo Ling et al. (2013) extracted over 1m
Chinese-English parallel segments from Sina
Weibo, which are code-switched messages. We
randomly sampled 29,705 code-switched mes-
sages along with 42,116 Chinese and 42,116 En-
glish messages from the the same time frame. We
used these data for training. We then sampled
an additional 2475 code-switched messages, 4221
English and 4211 Chinese messages as test data.

Olympics We collected tweets from July 27,
2012 to August 12, 2012, and identified 302,775
tweets about the Olympics based on related hash-
tags and keywords (e.g. olympics, #london2012,
etc.) We identified code-switched tweets using
the Chromium Language Detector2. This system
provides the top three possible languages for a
given document with confidence scores; we iden-
tify a tweet as code-switched if two predicted lan-
guages each have confidence greater than 33%.
We then used the tagger of Lignos and Marcus
(2013) to obtain token level LID tags, and only
tweets with tokens in both Spanish and English are
used as code-switched tweets. In total we iden-
tified 822 Spanish-English code-switched tweets.
We further expanded the mined tweets to full con-
versations, yielding 1055 Spanish-English code-
switched documents (including both tweets and
conversations), along with 4007 English and 4421
Spanish tweets composes our data set. We reserve
10% of the data for testing.

5 Experiments

We evaluated csLDA on the two datasets and eval-
uated each model using perplexity on held out data
and human judgements. While our goal is to learn
polylingual topics, we cannot compare to previous
polylingual models since they require comparable
data, which we lack. Instead, we constructed a
baseline from LDA run on the entire dataset (no

language information.) For each model, we mea-
sured the document completion perplexity (Rosen-
Zvi et al., 2004) on the held out data. We ex-
perimented with different numbers of topics (T ).
Since csLDA duplicates topic distributions (T ×L)
we used twice as many topics for LDA.

Figure 3 shows test perplexity for varying T and
perplexity for the best setting of csLDA (T =60)
and LDA (T =120). The table lists both mono-
lingual and code-switched test data; csLDA im-
proves over LDA in almost every case, and across
all values of T . The background distribution (-bg)
has mixed results for LDA, whereas for csLDA
it shows consistent improvement. Table 4 shows
some csLDA topics. While there are some mis-
takes, overall the topics are coherent and aligned.

We use the available per-token LID system
(Lignos and Marcus, 2013) for Spanish/English
to justify csLDA’s ability to infer the hidden lan-
guage variables. We ran csLDA-bg with li set to
the value provided by the LID system for code-
switched documents (csLDA-bg with LID), which
gives csLDA high quality LID labels. While we
see gains for the code-switched data, overall the
results for csLDA-bg and csLDA-bg with LID are
similar, suggesting that the model can operate ef-
fectively even without a supervised per-token LID
system.

5.1 Human Evaluation

We evaluate topic alignment quality through a hu-
man judgements (Chang et al., 2009). For each
aligned topic, we show an annotator the 20 most
frequent words from the foreign language topic
(Chinese or Spanish) with the 20 most frequent
words from the aligned English topic and two ran-
dom English topics. The annotators are asked to
select the most related English topic among the
three; the one with the most votes is considered
the aligned topic. We count how often the model’s
alignments agree.

LDA may learn comparable topics in different
languages but gives no explicit alignments. We
create alignments by classifying each LDA topic
by language using the KL-divergence between the
topic’s words distribution and a word distribution
for the English/foreign language inferred from the
monolingual documents. Language is assigned to
a topic by taking the minimum KL. For Weibo
data, this was not effective since the vocabularies
of each language are highly unbalanced. Instead,

Figure 4: Examples of aligned topics from Olympics (left) and Weibo (right).

we manually labeled the topics by language. We
then pair topics across languages using the cosine
similarity of their co-occurrence statistics in code-
switched documents. Topic pairs with similarity
above t are considered aligned topics. We also
used a threshold p (§3.2) to select aligned topics
in csLDA. To ensure a fair comparison, we select
the same number of aligned topics for LDA and
csLDA.3. We used the best performing setting:
csLDA T =60, LDA T =120, which produced 12
alignments from Olympics and 28 from Weibo.

Using Mechanical Turk we collected multiple
judgements per alignment. For Spanish, we re-
moved workers who disagreed with the majority
more than 50% of the time (83 deletions), leav-
ing 6.5 annotations for each alignment (85.47%
inter-annotator agreement.) For Chinese, since
quality of general Chinese turkers is low (Pavlick
et al., 2014) we invited specific workers and
obtained 9.3 annotations per alignment (78.72%
inter-annotator agreement.) For Olympics, LDA
alignments matched the judgements 25% of the
time, while csLDA matched 50% of the time.
While csLDA found 12 alignments and LDA 29,
the 12 topics evaluated from both models show
that csLDA’s alignments are higher quality. For
the Weibo data, LDA matched judgements 71.4%,
while csLDA matched 75%. Both obtained high

quality alignments – likely due both to the fact
that the code-switched data is curated to find trans-
lations and we hand labeled topic language – but
csLDA found many more alignments: 60 as com-
pared to 28. These results confirm our automated
results: csLDA finds higher quality topics that
span both languages.
