Abstract
Distributed representations of words which
map each word to a continuous vector have
proven useful in capturing important linguis-
tic information not only in a single language
but also across different languages. Current
unsupervised adversarial approaches show that
it is possible to build a mapping matrix that
aligns two sets of monolingual word embed-
dings without high quality parallel data, such
as a dictionary or a sentence-aligned corpus.
However, without an additional step of refine-
ment, the preliminary mapping learnt by these
methods is unsatisfactory, leading to poor per-
formance for typologically distant languages.

In this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised
adversarial training method to overcome this
limitation, based on the intuition that map-
ping across languages is better done at the
concept level than at the word level. We
propose a concept-based adversarial training
method which improves the performance of
previous unsupervised adversarial methods for
most languages, and especially for typologi-
cally distant language pairs.

1 Introduction

Distributed representations of words which map
each word to a continuous vector have proven use-
ful in capturing important linguistic information.
Vectors of words that are semantically or syntacti-
cally similar have been shown to be close to each
other in the same space (Mikolov et al., 2013a,c;
Pennington et al., 2014), making them widely use-
ful in many natural language processing tasks such
as machine translation and parsing (Bansal et al.,
2014; Mi et al., 2016), both in a single language
and across different languages.

Mikolov et al. (2013b) first observed that the ge-
ometric positions of similar words in different lan-
guages were related by a linear relation. Zou et al.
(2013) showed that a cross-lingually shared word

embedding space is more useful than a monolin-
gual space in an end-to-end machine translation
task. However, traditional methods for mapping
two monolingual word embeddings require high
quality aligned sentences or dictionaries (Faruqui
and Dyer, 2014; Ammar et al., 2016b).

Reducing the need for parallel data, then, has
become the main issue for cross-lingual word em-
bedding mapping. Some recent work aiming at
reducing resources has shown competitive cross-
lingual mappings across similar languages, us-
ing a pseudo-dictionary, such as identical charac-
ter strings between two languages (Smith et al.,
2017), or a simple list of numerals (Artetxe et al.,
2017).

In a more general method, Zhang et al. (2017)
have shown that learning mappings across lan-
guages via adversarial training (Goodfellow et al.,
2014) can avoid using bilingual evidence. This
generality comes at the expense of performance.
To overcome this limitation, Lample et al. (2018)
refine the preliminary mapping matrix trained by
generative adversarial networks (GANs) and ob-
tain a model that is again comparable to super-
vised models for several language pairs. Despite
these big improvements, the performance of these
refined GAN models depends largely on the qual-
ity of the preliminary mappings. It is probably
for this reason that these models still do not show
satisfactory performance for typologically distant
languages.

In this paper, we explore new augmented mod-
els of the adversarial framework that are based on
the intuition that the right level of lexical align-
ment between languages, especially distant lan-
guages, is not the word but the concept. We also
observe that some cross-lingual resources, such
as document-aligned data, are not as expensive as
high-quality dictionaries. For example, Wikipedia
provides thousands of aligned articles in many lan-



4420

guages. Combining these two observations, we
develop a concept-based, weakly supervised ad-
versarial method for learning cross-lingual word
embedding mappings that rely on these readily
available cross-lingual resources.

The main novelty of our method lies in the use
of Wikipedia concept-aligned article pairs in the
discriminator, which encourages the generator to
align words from different languages which are
used to describe the same concept. We lever-
age the power of the adversarial framework and
its ability to align distributions by defining con-
cepts as the distribution of words in their respec-
tive Wikipedia articles.

The results of our experiments on bilingual lexi-
con induction show that the preliminary mappings
(without post-refinement) trained by our proposed
multi-discriminator model are much better than
unsupervised adversarial training methods. When
we include the post-refinement of Lample et al.
(2018), in most cases, our models are compa-
rable or even better than our dictionary-based
supervised baselines, and considerably improve
the performance of the method of Lample et al.
(2018), especially for distant language pairs, such
as Chinese-English and Finnish-English.1 Com-
pared to the previous state-of-the-art, our method
still shows competitive performance.

2 Models

The basic idea of mapping two sets of pre-
trained monolingual word embeddings together
was first proposed by Mikolov et al. (2013b).
They use a small dictionary of n pairs of
words {(ws1 , wt1 ), ..., (wsn , wtn )} obtained from
Google Translate to learn a transformation matrix
W that projects the embeddings vsi of the source
language words wsi onto the embeddings vti of
their translation words wti in the target language,
by optimizing the objective:

min
W

n∑
i=1

‖Wvsi − vti‖
2 (1)

The trained matrix W can then be used for
detecting the translation for any source language
word ws by simply finding the word wt whose
embedding vt is nearest to Wvs. Recent work by
Smith et al. (2017) has shown that forcing the ma-

tion 5.

trix W to be orthogonal can effectively improve
the results of mapping.

2.1 GANs for cross-lingual word embeddings
Since the core of this linear mapping is derived
from a dictionary, the quality and size of the dic-
tionary can considerably affect the result. Recent
attempts by Zhang et al. (2017) and Lample et al.
(2018) have shown that, even without a dictionary
or any other cross-lingual resource, training the
transformation matrix W is still possible using the
GAN framework (Goodfellow et al., 2014). The
standard GAN framework plays a min-max game
between two models: a generative model G and a
discriminative model D. The generator G learns
from the source data distribution and tries to gen-
erate new samples that appear drawn from the dis-
tribution of target data. The discriminator D dis-
criminates the generated samples from the target
data.

If we adapt the standard GAN framework to
the goal of mapping cross-lingual word embed-
dings, the objective of the generator G is to learn
the transformation matrix W that maps the source
language embeddings to the target language em-
bedding space, and the discriminator Dl, usually
a neural network classifier, detects whether the in-
put is from the target language, giving us the ob-
jective:

min
G

max
Dl

Evt∼pvt logDl(vt)

+ Evs∼pvs log(1−Dl(G(vs)))
(2)

whereG(vs) = Wvs andDl(vt) denotes the prob-
ability that vt came from the distribution pvt rather
than the distribution pvs . The inputs of genera-
tor G are the embeddings sampled from the dis-
tribution of source language word embeddings,
pvs , and the inputs of discriminator Dl are sam-
pled from both the distribution pvt of real target
language word embeddings and the distribution
pG(vs) of generated target language word embed-
dings. Both G and Dl are trained simultaneously
by stochastic gradient descent. A good transfor-
mation matrix W can make pG(vs) similar to pvt ,
so thatDl can no longer distinguish between them.
However, this kind of similarity is at the distribu-
tion level. Good monolingual word embeddings
are widely spread in the vector space. Conse-
quently, without any post-processing, the cross-
lingual mappings are usually inaccurate when we
look at specific words (Lample et al., 2018).

2.2 Concept-based GANs for cross-lingual
word embeddings

Under the assumption that words in different lan-
guages are similar when they are used to describe
the same topic or concept (Søgaard et al., 2015), it
seems possible to use concept-aligned documents
to improve the mapping performance and make
the generated embeddings of the source language
words closer to the embeddings of correspond-
ing words in the target language. Unlike dictio-
naries and sentence-aligned corpora, cross-lingual
concept-aligned documents are much more read-
ily available. For example, Wikipedia contains
more than 40-million articles in more than 200
languages.2 Therefore, many articles of different
languages can be linked together because they are
about the same concept.

Given two monolingual word embeddings
V js = {vs1 , ..., vsj } and V

k
t = {vt1 , , ..., vtk}, our

work consists in using a set of Wikipedia concept-
aligned article pairs, such that (Chs , C

h
t ) =

{(cs1 , ct1 )..., (csh , cth )}, to reshape the transfor-
mation matrix W , where csi ∈ C

h
s represents the

article of concept ci in the source language and
cti ∈ C

h
t represents the article of the same con-

cept in the target language.
As shown in Figure 1, the generator uses the

transformation matrix W to map the input embed-
dings vs from the source to the target language.
Differently from the original GANs, the input of
the generator and the input of the discriminator on
conceptDcl are not sampled from the whole distri-
bution of V js or V kt , but from their sub-distribution
conditioned on the concept c, denoted pvs|c and
pvt|c. vc represents the embedding of the shared
concept c. In this paper, we use the embedding
of the title of c in the target language. For titles
consisting of multiple words, we average the em-
beddings of its words.

The input of the discriminator on conceptDcl is
the concatenation of the embedding of the shared
concept vc and the generated target embeddings
G(vs) or the real target embeddings vt. Instead of
determining whether its input follows the whole
target language distribution pvt , the objective of
Dcl now becomes to judge whether its input fol-
lows the distribution pvt|c, and its loss function is
given in equation (3).

logDcl(vt, vc) + log(1−Dcl(G(vs), vc)) (3)
2https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List of Wikipedias

Figure 1: Architecture of our concept-based multi-
discriminator model. Dl word-level discriminator, Dcl
concept-level discriminator.

Because the sub-distribution conditioned on the
concept pvt|c is less spread than pvt and the pro-
portion of similar words in pvt|c is higher than
in pvt , the embeddings of the input source words
have a greater chance of being trained to align with
the embeddings of their similar words in the target
language.

Our multi-discriminator concept-based model
does not completely remove the usual language
discriminator Dl that determines whether its input
follows the real target language distribution pvt or
the generated target language distribution, pG(vs).
The simpler discriminator Dl is useful when the
concept-based discriminator is not stable. The ob-
jective function of the multi-discriminator model,
shown in equation (4), combines all these ele-
ments.

3 Shared Components

Both the GAN and the concept-based GAN mod-
els use a variety of further methods that have been
shown to improve results.

3.1 Orthogonalization
Previous studies (Xing et al., 2015; Smith et al.,
2017) show that enforcing the mapping matrix W
to be orthogonal can improve the performance and



4422

make the adversarial training more stable. In this
work, we perform the same update step proposed
by Cisse et al. (2017) to approximate setting W to
an orthogonal matrix:

W ← (1 + β)W − β
(
WW>

)
W (5)

According to Lample et al. (2018) and Chen and
Cardie (2018), when setting β to less than 0.01, the
orthogonalization usually performs well.

3.2 Post-refinement
Previous work has shown that the core cross-
lingual mapping can be improved by refining
it by bootstrapping from a dictionary extracted
from the learned mapping itself (Lample et al.,
2018). Since this refinement process is not the
focus of this work, we perform the same refine-
ment procedure as Lample et al. (2018). Af-
ter the core mapping matrix is learned, we use
it to translate the ten thousand most frequent
source words (s1, s2, ..., s10000) into the target lan-
guage. We then take these ten thousand trans-
lations (t1, t2, ..., t10000) and translate them back
into the source language. We call these translation
(s′1, s

′
2, ..., s

′
10000). We then consider all the word

pairs (si, ti) where si = s′i as our seed dictionary
and use this dictionary to update our preliminary
mapping matrix using the objective in equation 1.

Moreover, following Xing et al. (2015) and
Artetxe et al. (2016), we force the refined matrix
W ∗ to be orthogonal by using singular value de-
composition (SVD):

W ∗ = ZU>, UΣZ> = SV D(V s
>V t) (6)

3.3 Cross-Domain Similarity Local Scaling
Previous work (Radovanović et al., 2010; Dinu
et al., 2015) has shown that standard nearest neigh-
bour techniques are not effective to retrieve target
similar words in high-dimensional spaces. The
work of Lample et al. (2018) showed that using
cross-domain similarity local scaling (CSLS) to
retrieve target similar words is more accurate than
standard nearest neighbour techniques. Instead of
just considering the similarity between the source
word and its neighbours in the target language,
CSLS also takes into account the similarity be-
tween the target word and its neighbours in the
source language:

CSLS(Wvs, vt) =

2 cos(Wvs, vt)− rt(Wvs)− rs(vt)
(7)

Figure 2: Model selection criteria

where rt(Wvs) represents the mean similarity be-
tween a source embedding and its neighbours in
the target language, and rs(vt) represent the mean
similarity between a target embedding and its
neighbours in the source language. In this work,
we use CSLS to build a dictionary for our post-
refinement.

4 Training

In our weakly-supervised model, the sampling and
model selection procedures are important.

Sampling Procedure As the statistics show in
Table 1, even after filtering, the vocabulary of
concept-aligned articles is still large. But it has
been shown that the embeddings of frequent words
are the most informative and useful (Luong et al.,
2013; Lample et al., 2018), so we only keep the
one-hundred thousand most frequent words for
learning W .

For each training step, then, the input word s
of our generator is randomly sampled from the
vocabulary that is common both to the source
monolingual word embedding S and the source
Wikipedia concept-aligned articles. After the in-
put source word s is sampled, we sample a con-
cept c according to the frequency of s in each
source article of the ensemble of concepts. Then
we uniformly sample a target word t from the sub-
vocabulary of the target article of concept c.3

Model Selection It is not as difficult to select the
best model for weakly-supervised learning as it is

3We use uniform sampling for the target words because
the distribution of the sampled sub-vocabulary is very small.
Sampling t according to its local frequency in the target ar-
ticle would significantly increase the sampling probability of
function words, which have less semantic information.

for unsupervised learning. In our task, the first se-
lection criterion is the average of the cosine simi-
larity between the embeddings of the concept title
in the source and the target languages. Moreover,
we find that another good indicator for selecting
the best model is the average cosine similarity be-
tween the two sets of embeddings consisting of
the average embeddings of the ten most frequent
words in the source and in the target languages for
each aligned article pair. As shown in Figure 2,
both of these two criteria correlate well with the
word translation evaluation task that we describe
in section 5. In this paper, we use the average sim-
ilarity of the cross-lingual title as the criterion for
selecting the best model.

Other Details For our generator, the mapping
matrix W is initialized with a random orthogonal
matrix. Our two discriminators Dl and Dcl are
two multi-layer perceptron classifiers with differ-
ent hidden layer sizes (1024 for Dl and 2048 for
Dcl), and a ReLU function as the activation func-
tion. In this paper, we set the number of hidden
layers to 2 for both Dl and Dcl. In practice, one
hidden layer also performs very well.

5 Experiments

We experimentally evaluate our proposal on the
task of Bilingual Lexicon Induction (BLI). This
task evaluates directly the bilingual mapping abil-
ity of a cross-lingual word embedding model. For
each language pair, we retrieve the best transla-
tions for source words in the test data, and we re-
port the accuracy.

More precisely, for a given source language
word, we map its embedding onto the target lan-
guage and retrieve the closest word. If this closest
word is included in the correct translations in the
evaluation dictionary, we consider that it is a cor-
rect case. In this paper, we report the results that
use CSLS to retrieve translations.

Baselines As the objective of this work is to
improve the performance of unsupervised GANs
by using our weakly-supervised concept-based
model, we choose the model of Lample et al.
(2018) (called MUSE below), as our unsupervised
baseline, since it is a typical standard GAN model.
We evaluate the models both in a setting without
refinement and a setting with refinement. The pro-
cedure of refinement is described in section 3.2
and 3.3. Moreover, it is important to evaluate
whether our model is comparable to previous su-
pervised models. We use two different dictionary-
based systems, VecMap proposed by Artetxe et al.
(2017) and Procrustes, provided by Lample et al.
(2018), as our supervised baselines. Previous ex-
periments have already shown that these two sys-
tems are strong baselines.

5.1 Data

Different previous pieces of work on bilingual lex-
icon induction use different datasets. We choose
two from the publicly available ones, selected to
have a comprehensive evaluation of our method.

BLI-1 The dataset provided by Lample et al.
(2018) contains high quality dictionaries for more
than 150 language pairs. For each language pair,
it has a training dictionary of 5000 words and an
evaluation dictionary of 1500 words. This dataset
allows us to have a better understanding of the per-
formance of our method on many different lan-
guage pairs. We choose nine languages for test-
ing and compare our method to our supervised and
unsupervised baselines described in section 5: En-
glish (en), German (de), Finnish (fi), French (fr),
Spanish (es), Italian (it), Russian (ru), Turkish (tr)
and Chinese (zh). We classify similar and dis-
tant languages based on a combination of struc-
tural properties (directional dependency distance,
as proposed and measured in Chen and Gerdes
(2017)) and lexical properties, as measured by the
clustering of current large-scale multilingual sen-
tence embeddings.4 We consider en � de, en �
fr, en � es, en � it as similar language pairs and
en � fi, en � ru, en � tr, en � zh as distant
language pairs.

BLI-2 Unlike BLI-1, the dataset of Dinu et al.
(2015) and its extensions provided by Artetxe et al.
(2017, 2018b) only consists of dictionaries of 4
language pairs trained on a Europarl parallel cor-

pus. Each dictionary has a training set of 5000
entries and a test set of 1500 entries. Compared
to BLI-1, this dataset is much noisier and the en-
tries are selected from different frequency ranges.
However, BLI-2 has been widely used for test-
ing by previous methods (Faruqui and Dyer, 2014;
Dinu et al., 2015; Xing et al., 2015; Artetxe et al.,
2016; Zhang et al., 2016; Artetxe et al., 2017;
Smith et al., 2017; Lample et al., 2018; Artetxe
et al., 2018a,b).5 Using BLI-2 allows us to have a
direct comparison with the state-of-the-art.

Monolingual Word Embeddings The quality
of monolingual word embeddings has a consider-
able impact on cross-lingual embeddings (Lample
et al., 2018). Compared to CBOW and Skip-gram
embeddings, FastText embeddings (Bojanowski
et al., 2017) capture syntactic information better.
The ideal situation would be to use FastText em-
beddings for both the BLI-1 and BLI-2 datasets.
However, much previous work uses CBOW em-
beddings, so we use different monolingual word
embeddings for BLI-1 and for BLI-2.

For BLI-1, we use FastText6 to train our mono-
lingual word embedding models with 300 dimen-
sions for each language and default settings. The

5Most of these methods have been tested by Artetxe et al.
(2018b) by using their own implementations.

training corpus comes from a Wikipedia dump.7

For European languages, words are lower-cased
and tokenized by the scripts of Moses (Koehn
et al., 2007).8 For Chinese, we first use OpenCC9

to convert traditional characters to simplified char-
acters and then use Jieba10 to perform tokeniza-
tion. For each language, we only keep the words
that appear more than five times.

For BLI-2, following the work of Artetxe et al.
(2018a),11 we use their pretrained CBOW embed-
dings of 300 dimensions. For English, Italian and
German, the models are trained on the WacKy
corpus. The Finnish model is trained from Com-
mon Crawl and the Spanish model is trained from
WMT News Crawl.

Concept Aligned Data For concept-aligned ar-
ticles, we use the Linguatools Wikipedia compara-
ble corpus.12 The statistics of our concept-aligned
data are reported in Table 1.

that with post-refinement, our method achieves the
best performance on eight language pairs. Table
3 illustrates the results of bilingual lexicon induc-
tion on the BLI-2 dataset. Although our method
(with refinement) does not achieve the best results,
the gap between our method and the best state-of-
the-art (Artetxe et al., 2018a) is very small, and
in most cases, our method is better than previous
supervised methods.

Comparison with unsupervised GANs As we
have mentioned before, the preliminary mappings
trained by the method of Lample et al. (2018) per-
form well for some similar language pairs, such
as Spanish to English and French to English. Af-
ter refinement, their unsupervised GANs models
can reach the same level as supervised models for
these similar language pairs. However, the biggest
drawback of standard GANs is that they exhibit
poor performance for distant language pairs. The
results from Table 2 clearly confirm this. For ex-
ample, without refinement, the mapping trained
by the unsupervised GAN method can only cor-
rectly predict 12% of the words from Turkish to
English. Given that the quality of preliminary
mappings can seriously affect the effect of refine-
ment, the low-quality preliminary mappings for
distant language pairs severely limits the improve-
ments brought by post-refinement. Notice that the
method of Lample et al. (2018) scores a null re-
sult for English to Finnish on both BLI-1 and BLI-
2, indicating that totally unsupervised adversarial
training can yields rather unpredictable results.

Compared to the method of Lample et al.
(2018), the improvement brought by our method
is apparent. Our concept-based GAN models per-
form better than their unsupervised models on al-
most every language pair for both datasets, BLI-1
and BLI-2. For those languages where no better
results are achieved, the gaps from the best are
very small. Figure 4 reports the error reduction
rate brought by our method for bilingual lexicon
induction on the BLI-1 dataset. It can be clearly
seen that the improvement brought by our method
is more pronounced on distant language pairs than
on similar language pairs.

Comparison with supervised baselines Our
two dictionary-based supervised baselines are
strong. In most cases, the preliminary mappings
trained by our concept-based model are not as
good, but the gap is small. After post-refinement,
our method becomes comparable with these su-

pervised methods. For some language pairs, such
as French-English and for English to Finnish, our
method performs better.

Comparison with the state-of-the-art From
the results shown in Table 3, we can see that in
most cases, our method works better than previous
supervised and unsupervised approaches. How-
ever, the performance of Artetxe et al. (2018a) is
very strong and their method always works better
than ours. Two potential reasons may cause this
difference: First, their self-learning framework it-
eratively fine-tunes the transformation until con-
vergence, while our refinement just runs for a cer-
tain number of iterations.13 Second, their frame-
work consists of many optimization steps, such as
symmetric re-weighting of vectors, steps that we
do not have.

Mapping examples Table 4 lists some examples
of mapping, randomly selected from our experi-
ment results on the dataset of BLI-1. From this
table, we can see that for these selected English
words, our model performs better than the unsu-
pervised GANs model of Lample et al. (2018),
but when we consider the top 3 translation can-
didates, both models are able to predict the cor-
rect translations well. Interestingly, the word ”bat-
tery” is most commonly translated as Chinese ”电
池(dianchi)”, correctly predicted by our model,
and the top 3 translation candidates provided by

13As optimisation of the refinement is not the objective of
this paper, we follow the work of Lample et al. (2018) and
run only five iterations for post-refinement.

our model are all related to ”electronic device”.
However, the translation candidates provided by
MUSE are all related to ”artillery”, a different
sense of the the word ”battery” both in English and
in Chinese, but not as common.
Impact of number of concepts To understand
whether the number of aligned concepts affects
our method, we trained our concept-based mod-
els on a range of Chinese-English concept-aligned
article pairs, from 550 to 10’000. We test them
on the BLI-1 dataset. Following the trend of per-
formance change shown in Figure 3, we see that,
when the number of shared concepts reaches 2500,
the improvement in accuracy is already very close
to the result of the model trained from the total
number of concepts (reported in Table 1), thus in-
dicating a direction for future optimization.
6 Related Work
Sharing a word embedding space across differ-
ent languages has proven useful for many cross-
lingual tasks, such as machine translation (Zou
et al., 2013) and cross-lingual dependency pars-

ing (Jiang et al., 2015, 2016; Ammar et al.,
2016a). Generally, such spaces can be trained
directly from bilingual sentence aligned or docu-
ment aligned text (Hermann and Blunsom, 2014;
Chandar A P et al., 2014; Søgaard et al., 2015;
Vulić and Moens, 2013). However the perfor-
mance of directly trained models is limited by
their vocabulary size.

Initial work on the topic has shown that two
monolingual spaces can be combined by applying
a linear mapping matrix (Mikolov et al., 2013b).
This simple approach has been improved upon in
several ways: using canonical correlation analysis
to map source and target embeddings (Faruqui and
Dyer, 2014); or by forcing the mapping matrix to
be orthogonal (Xing et al., 2015).

Recently, efforts have concentrated on how to
limit or avoid reliance on dictionaries. Good re-
sults were achieved with some drastically min-
imal techniques. Zhang et al. (2016) achieved
good results at bilingual POS tagging, but not
bilingual lexicon induction, using only ten word
pairs to build a coarse orthonormal mapping be-
tween source and target monolingual embeddings.
The work of Smith et al. (2017) has shown that
a singular value decomposition (SVD) method
can produce a competitive cross-lingual mapping
by using identical character strings across lan-
guages. Artetxe et al. (2017, 2018b) proposed a
self-learning framework, which iteratively trains
its cross-lingual mapping by using dictionaries
trained in previous rounds. The initial dictionary
of the self-learning can be reduced to 25 word
pairs or even only a list of numerals and still have
competitive performance. Furthermore, Artetxe
et al. (2018a) extend their self-learning framework
to unsupervised models, and build the state-of-
the-art for bilingual lexicon induction. Instead
of using a pre-build dictionary for initialization,
they sort the value of the word vectors in both the
source and the target distribution, treat two vectors
that have similar permutations as possible transla-
tions and use them as the initialization dictionary.
Additionally, their unsupervised framework also
includes many optimization augmentations, such
as stochastic dictionary induction and symmetric
re-weighting, among others.

Theoretically, employing GANs for training
cross-lingual word embedding is also a promising
way to avoid the use of bilingual evidence. As far
as we know, Miceli Barone (2016) was the first

attempt at this approach, but the performance of
their model is not competitive. Zhang et al. (2017)
enforce the mapping matrix to be orthogonal dur-
ing the adversarial training and achieve good per-
formance on bilingual lexicon induction. The
main drawback of their approach is that the vo-
cabularies of their training data are small, and the
performance of their models drops significantly
when they use large training data. The recent
model proposed by Lample et al. (2018) is so far
the most successful, becoming competitive with
previous supervised approaches through a strong
CSLS-based refinement to the core mapping ma-
trix trained by GANs. Even in this case, though,
without refinement, the core mappings are not as
good as hoped for some distant language pairs.
More recently, Chen and Cardie (2018) extends
the work of Lample et al. (2018) from the bilin-
gual setting to the multi-lingual setting. Instead
of training crosslingual word embeddings for only
one language pair, their approach allows them to
train crosslingual word embeddings for many lan-
guage pairs at the same time. Another recent piece
of work which is similar to Lample et al. (2018)
comes from Xu et al. (2018). Their approach can
be divided into 2 steps: first, using Wasserstein
GAN (Arjovsky et al., 2017) to train a prelimi-
nary mapping between two monolingual distribu-
tions and then minimizing the Sinkhorn Distance
across distributions. Although their method per-
forms better than Lample et al. (2018) in several

tasks, the improvement mainly comes from the
second step, showing that the problem of how to
train a better preliminary mapping has not been
resolved.

7 Conclusions and Future Work

In this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised ad-
versarial training method for cross-lingual word
embedding mapping. Our approach is based on
the intuition that mapping across distant languages
is better done at the concept level than at the word
level. We propose using the distributions of words
in aligned Wikipedia articles as data for this con-
cept mapping. The method improves the per-
formance over previous unsupervised adversarial
methods in almost all cases, especially for distant
languages.

The monolingual word embeddings that we
have used in this paper represent a word and not its
different senses. These models do not handle poly-
semous words well. This also can have a negative
impact on the performance of cross-lingual map-
ping. Recent work on contextualized word embed-
dings (Peters et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2019) pro-
vides dynamic representations for words and has
been shown to perform better at handling the prob-
lem of polysemy. Extending our concept-based
cross-lingual mapping to contextualized word rep-
resentations will be the focus of our future work.
