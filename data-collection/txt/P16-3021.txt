Abstract

In this research, we build a Wikifica-
tion corpus for advancing Japanese En-
tity Linking. This corpus consists of 340
Japanese newspaper articles with 25,675
entity mentions. All entity mentions are
labeled by a fine-grained semantic classes
(200 classes), and 19,121 mentions were
successfully linked to Japanese Wikipedia
articles. Even with the fine-grained se-
mantic classes, we found it hard to define
the target of entity linking annotations and
to utilize the fine-grained semantic classes
to improve the accuracy of entity linking.

1 Introduction

Entity linking (EL) recognizes mentions in a text
and associates them to their corresponding en-
tries in a knowledge base (KB), for example,
Wikipedia1, Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008), and
DBPedia (Lehmann et al., 2015). In particu-
lar, when linked to Wikipedia articles, the task is
called Wikifiation (Mihalcea and Csomai, 2007).
Let us consider the following sentence.

On the 2nd of June, the team of Japan
will play World Cup (W Cup) qualifica-
tion match against Honduras in the sec-
ond round of Kirin Cup at Kobe Wing
Stadium, the venue for the World Cup.

Wikification is expected to link “Soccer” to the
Wikipedia article titled Soccer, “World Cup” and
“W Cup”2 to FIFA World Cup 2002, “team of
Japan” to Japan Football Team, “Kobe City” to
Kobe, “Kobe Wing Stadium” to Misaki Park Sta-
dium. Since there is no entry for “Second Round
of Kirin Cup”, the mention is labeled as NIL.

1https://www.wikipedia.org/
2“W Cup” is a Japanese-style abbreviation of “World

Cup”.

EL is useful for various NLP tasks, e.g.,
Question-Answering (Khalid et al., 2008), Infor-
mation Retrieval (Blanco et al., 2015), Knowl-
edge Base Population (Dredze et al., 2010), Co-
Reference Resolution (Hajishirzi et al., 2013).
There are about a dozen of datasets target-
ing EL in English, including UIUC datasets
(ACE, MSNBC) (Ratinov et al., 2011), AIDA
datasets (Hoffart et al., 2011), and TAC-KBP
datasets (2009–2012 datasets) (McNamee and
Dang, 2009).

Ling et al. (2015) discussed various challenges
in EL. They argued that the existing datasets are
inconsistent with each other. For instance, TAC-
KBP targets only mentions belonging to PER-
SON, LOCATION, ORGANIZATION classes.
Although these entity classes may be dominant in
articles, other tasks may require information on
natural phenomena, product names, and institu-
tion names. In contrast, the MSNBC corpus does
not limit entity classes, linking mentions to any
Wikipedia article. However, the MSNBC corpus
does not have a NIL label even if a mention be-
longs to an important class such as PERSON or
LOCATION, unlike the TAC-KBP corpus.

There are few studies addressing on Japanese
EL. Furukawa et al. (2014) conducted a study on
recognizing technical terms appearing in academic
articles and linking them to English Wikipedia
articles. Hayashi et al. (2014) proposed an EL
method that simultaneously performs both English
and Japanese Wikification, given parallel texts in
both languages. Nakamura et al. (2015) links
keywords in social media into English Wikipedia,
aiming at a cross-language system that recognizes
topics of social media written in any language. Os-
ada et al. (2015) proposed a method to link men-
tions in news articles for organizing local news of
different prefectures in Japan.

However, these studies do not necessarily ad-

138



vance EL on a Japanese KB. As of January 2016,
Japanese Wikipedia and English Wikipedia in-
clude about 1 million and 5 million, respectively,
articles. However, there are only around 0.56 mil-
lion inter-language links between Japanese and
English. Since most of the existing KBs (e.g.,
Freebase and DBPedia) originate from Wikipedia,
we cannot expect that English KBs cover enti-
ties that are specific to Japanese culture, locals,
and economics. Moreover, a Japanese EL system
is useful for populating English knowledge base
as well, harvesting source documents written in
Japanese.

To make matters worse, we do not have a cor-
pus for Japanese EL, i.e., Japanese mentions as-
sociated with Japanese KB. Although (Murawaki
and Mori, 2016) concern with Japanese EL, the
corpus they have built is not necessarily a cor-
pus for Japanese EL. The motivation behind their
work comes from the difficulty of word segmen-
tation for unsegmented languages, like Chinese or
Japanese. (Murawaki and Mori, 2016) approach
the word segmentation problem from point of view
of Wikification. Their focus is on the word seg-
mentation rather than on the linking.

In this research, we build a Japanese Wikifica-
tion corpus in which mentions in Japanese doc-
uments are associated with Japanese Wikipedia
articles. The corpus consists of 340 newspaper
articles from Balanced Corpus of Contemporary
Written Japanese (BCCWJ) 3 annotated with fine-
grained named entity labels defined by Sekine’s
Extended Named Entity Hierarchy (Sekine et al.,
2002) 4.

2 Dataset Construction

To give a better understanding of our dataset we
briefly compare it with existing English datasets.
The most comparable ones are UIUC (Ratinov
et al., 2011) and TAC-KBP 2009–2012 datasets
(McNamee and Dang, 2009). Although, AIDA
datasets are widely used for Disambiguation of
Entities, AIDA uses YAGO, an unique Knowl-
edge Base derived from Wikipedia, GeoNames
and Wordnet, which makes it difficult to com-
pare. UIUC is similar to our dataset in a sense that
it links to any Wikipedia article without any se-
mantic class restrictions, unlike TAC-KBP which

3http://pj.ninjal.ac.jp/corpus_center/
bccwj/en/

4https://sites.google.com/site/
extendednamedentityhierarchy/

is limited to mentions that belong to PERSON,
LOCATION or ORGANIZATION classes only.
When an article is not present in Wikipedia, UIUC
does not record this information in any way. On
the contrary, TAC-KBP5 and our datasets have NIL
tag used to mark a mention when it does not have
an entry in KB.

2.1 Design Policy

Ling et al. (2015) argued that the task definition
of EL itself is challenging: whether to target only
named entities (NEs) or to include general nouns;
whether to limit semantic classes of target NEs;
how to define NE boundaries; how specific the
links should be; and how to handle metonymy.

The original (Hashimoto et al., 2008) corpus is
also faced with similar challenges: mention abbre-
viations that result in the string representation that
is an exact match to the string representation of
another mention, abbreviated or not (for example,
“Tokyo (City)” and “TV Tokyo”), metonymy and
synecdoche.

As for the mention “World Cup” in the exam-
ple in Section 1, we have three possible candidates
entities, World Cup, FIFA World Cup, and 2002
FIFA World Cup. Although all of them look rea-
sonable, 2002 FIFA World Cup is the most suit-
able, being more specific than others. At the same
time, we cannot expect that Wikipedia includes the
most specific entities. For example, let us suppose
that we have a text discussing a possible venue
for 2034 FIFA World Cup. As of January 2016,
Wikipedia does not include an article about 2034
FIFA World Cup6. Thus, it may be a difficult deci-
sion whether to link it to FIFA World Cup or make
it NIL.

Moreover, the mention “Kobe Wing Stadium”
includes nested NE mentions, “Kobe (City)” and
“Kobe Wing Stadium”. Furthermore, although the
article titled “Kobe Wing Stadium” does exist in
Japanese Wikipedia, the article does not explain
the stadium itself but explains the company run-
ning the stadium. Japanese Wikipedia includes
a separate article Misaki Park Stadium describing
the stadium. In addition, the mention “Honduras”
does not refer to Honduras as a country, but as the
national soccer team of Honduras.

In order to separate these issues raised by NEs
5TAC-KBP 2012 requires NIL to be clustered in accor-

dance to the semantic classes.
6Surprisingly, Wikipedia includes articles for the future

World Cups up to 2030.

139



from the EL task, we decided to build a Wikifica-
tion corpus on top of a portion of BCCWJ cor-
pora with Extended Named Entity labels anno-
tated (Hashimoto et al., 2008). This corpus con-
sists of 340 newspaper articles where NE bound-
aries and semantic classes are annotated. This
design strategy has some advantages. First, we
can omit the discussion on semantic classes and
boundaries of NEs. Second, we can analyze the
impact of semantic classes of NEs to the task of
EL.

2.2 Annotation Procedure
We have used brat rapid annotation tool (Stene-
torp et al., 2012) to effectively link mentions to
Wikipedia articles. Brat has a functionality of im-
porting external KBs (e.g., Freebase or Wikipedia)
for EL. We have prepared a KB for Brat using
a snapshot of Japanese Wikipedia accessed on
November 2015. We associate a mention to a
Wikipedia ID so that we can uniquely locate an ar-
ticle even when the title of the article is changed.
We configure Brat so that it can present a title and
a lead sentence (short description) of each article
during annotation.

Because this is the first attempt to build a
Japanese Wikification dataset on a fine-grained
NE corpus, we did not limit the semantic classes
of target NEs in order to analyze the importance
of different semantic classes. However, based on
preliminary investigation results, we decided to
exclude the following semantic classes from tar-
gets of the annotation: Timex (Temporal Expres-
sion, 12 classes), Numex (Numerical Expression,
34 classes), Address (e.g., postal address and
urls, 1 class), Title Other (e.g., Mr., Mrs.,
1 class), Facility Part (e.g, 9th floor, sec-
ond basement, 1 class). Mentions belonging to
other classes were linked to their corresponding
Wikipedia pages.

We asked three Japanese native speakers to link
mentions into Wikipedia articles using Brat. We
gave the following instructions to obtain consis-
tent annotations:

1. Choose the entity that is the most specific in
possible candidates.

2. Do not link a mention into a disambiguation
page, category page, nor WikiMedia page.

3. Link a mention into a section of an article
only when no suitable article exists for the

mention.

2.3 Annotation Results

Table 1 reports the statistics of the corpus built by
this work. Out of 25,675 mentions satisfying the
conditions explained in Section 2.2, 19,121 men-
tions were linked to Japanese Wikipedia articles.
In total, 7,118 distinct mentions were linked to
6,008 distinct entities. Table 2 shows the high
inter- annotator agreement (the Cohen-Kappa’s
coefficient) of the corpus7.

In order to find important/unimportant seman-
tic classes of NEs for EL, we computed the
link rate for each semantic class. Link rate
of a semantic class is the ratio of the number
of linkable (non-NIL) mentions belonging that
class to the total number of mentions of that
class occurring throughout the corpus. Table 3
presents semantic classes with the highest and
lowest link rates8. Popular NE classes such as
Province and Pro Sports Organization
had high link rates. Semantic classes such as Book
and Occasion Other had low link rates be-
cause these entities are rare and uncommon. How-
ever, we also found it difficult to limit the target of
entity linking based only on semantic classes be-
cause the importance of the semantic classes with

7We cannot compute the inter-annotator agreement be-
tween Annotators 1 and 3, who have no overlap articles for
annotation.

8In this analysis, we removed semantic classes appearing
less than 100 times in the corpus. We concluded that those
minor semantic classes do little help in revealing the nature
of the dataset we have built. Most of them had perfect or near
to zperfect link rates with mentions being rare and uniquely
identifiable.

low link rates depends on the application; for ex-
ample, Occasion Other, which has the lowest
link rate, may be crucial for event extraction from
text.

In the research on word sense disambiguation
(WSD), it is common to assume that the identi-
cal expressions have the same sense throughout
the text. This assumption is called one-sense-per-
discourse. In our corpus, 322 out of 340 (94.7%)
articles satisfy the assumption. A few instances in-
clude: expressions “Bush” referred to both George
H. W. Bush and George W. Bush (the former is of-
ten referred as Bush Senior and the latter as Bush
Junior); and expressions “Tokyo” referred to both
Tokyo Television and Tokyo city.

2.4 Difficult Annotation Cases

We report cases where annotators found difficult
to choose an entity from multiple potential candi-
dates. Mention boundaries from the original cor-
pus are indicated by underline.

Nested entities

It was assumed that the role ini-
tially served as a temporary peace-
maker to persuade Ali al-Sistani,
the spiritual leader of Shia Muslims:
Position Vocation.

Since the mention in the sentence refers to the
highest ranking position of a specific religion, it
is inappropriate to link the mention to the article
Spiritual Leader nor Shia Muslim. Therefore, we
decided to mark this mention as NIL.

Entity changes over time

In his greeting speech, the representative
Ito expressed his opinion on the upcom-
ing gubernatorial election: Event Other
and Sapporo city mayoral election.

This article was about the Hokkaido Prefecture gu-
bernatorial election held in 2003. Since the BC-
CWJ corpus does not provide timestamps of arti-
cles, it is difficult to identify the exact event. How-
ever, this article has a clue in another place, “the
progress of the developmental project from 2001”.
For this reason, the annotators could resolve the
mention to 2003 Hokkaido Prefecture gubernato-
rial election. Generally, it is difficult to identify
events that are held periodically. The similar issue
occurs in mentions regarding position/profession
(e.g., “former president”) and sport events (e.g.,
“World Cup”).

Japanese EL is similar to English El: the same
challenges of mention ambiguity (nested entities,
metonymy) still persist. With the Japanese Wikifi-
cation, a variation of the task that takes advantage
of the cross-lingual nature of Wikipedia is worth
exploring.

3 Wikification Experiment

In this section, we conduct an experiment of Wik-
ification on the corpus built by this work. Wikifi-
cation is decomposed into two steps: recognizing
a mention m in the text, and predicting the cor-
responding entity e for the mention m. Because
the corpus was built on the corpus with NE men-
tions recognized, we omit the step of entity men-
tion recognition.

3.1 Wikification without fine-grained
semantic classes

Our experiment is based on the disambiguation
method that uses the probability distribution of an-
chor texts (Spitkovsky and Chang, 2012). Given a
mention m, the method predicts an entity ê that
yields the highest probability p(e|m),

ê = argmax
e∈E

p(e|m). (1)

Table 3: 10 classes with the highest and the lowest link rates among the classes that occurred more than
100 times

Here, E is the set of all articles in Japanese
Wikipedia. The conditional probability p(e|m)
is estimated by the anchor texts in Japanese
Wikipedia,

p(e|m) = # occurrences of m as anchors to e
#occurrences of m as anchors

.

(2)

If ∀e : p(e|m) = 0 for the mention m, we mark
the mention as NIL. Ignoring contexts of mentions,
this method relies on the popularity of entities in
the anchor texts of the mention m. The accuracy
of this method was 53.31% (13,493 mentions out
of 25,309).

3.2 Wikification with fine-grained semantic
classes

Furthermore, we explore the usefulness of the
fine-grained semantic classes for Wikification.
This method estimates probability distributions
conditioned on a mention m and its semantic class
c. Idealy, we would like to predict an entity ê with,

ê = argmax
e∈E,c∈C

p(e|m, c) (3)

However, it is hard to estimate the probability dis-
tribution p(e|m, c) directly from the Wikipedia
articles. Instead, we decompose p(e|m, c) into
p(e|m)p(e|c) to obtain,

ê = argmax
e∈E,c∈C

p(e|m)p(e|c). (4)

Here, C is the set of all semantic classes included
in Sekine’s Extended Named Entity Hierarchy. In
addition, we apply Bayes’ rule to p(e|c),

ê = argmax
e∈E,c∈C

p(e|m)p(c|e)p(e) (5)

The probability distribution p(c|e) bridges
Wikipedia articles and semantic classes defined in
Sekine’s Extended Named Entity Hierarchy. We
adapt a method to predict a semantic class of a
Wikipedia article (Suzuki et al., 2016) for esti-
mating p(c|e). The accuracy of this method was
53.26% (13,480 mentions out of 25,309), which
is slightly lower than that of the previous method.
The new method improved 627 instances mainly
with LOCATION Category (e.g., country names
and city names). For example,

The venue is Aichi Welfare Pen-
sion Hall in Ikeshita, Nagoya
Semantic Class: City Correct:Nagoya City

Old Method: Nagoya Station

New Method: Nagoya City

Because Nagoya Station is more popular in anchor
texts in Japanese Wikipedia, the old method pre-
dicts Nagoya Station as the entity for the mention
Nagoya. In contrast, the new method could lever-
age the semantic class, City to avoid the mistake.
We could observe similar improvements for distin-
guishing Country – Language, Person – Location,
Location – Sports Team.

142



However, the new method degraded 664 in-
stances mainly because the fine-grained entity
classes tried to map them into too specific enti-
ties. More than half of such instances belonged
to POSITION VOCATION semantic class. For
example, mention “Prime Minister” was mistak-
ingly mapped to Prime Minister of Japan instead
of Prime Minister.

4 Future Work

In our future work, we will incorporate the context
information of the text in the Wikification process
and further investigate the definition of the target
of entity linking annotations. Although incorpo-
rating semantic classes of entities has a potential to
improve Wikification quality, some problems still
remain even with the semantic classes. Here, we
explain some interesting cases.

Name variations

During the summer, a JASRAC Correct:
Japanese Society for Rights of Authors, Composers and Publishers

Predicted: NIL staff came to the shop to
explain it.

This type of mistakes are caused by the lack of
aliases and redirects in Wikipedia. In this exam-
ple, the mention ‘JASRAC’ was predicted as NIL
because Wikipedia did not include JASRAC as an
alias for Japanese Society for Rights of Authors,
Composers and Publishers.

Link bias in Wikipedia

Thousands have participated in the
funeral held at World Trade Center
Correct: World Trade Center (1973-2001)

Predicted: World Trade Center (Tokyo), which
is known as “Ground Zero”.

In this example, the mention “World Trade Cen-
ter” refers to World Trade Center (1973–2001)
with strong clues in the surrounding context
“Ground Zero”. Both of the presented methods
predict it as World Trade Center (Tokyo) because
there is a building with the identical name in
Japan. Using Japanese Wikipedia articles for es-
timating the probability distribution, Japanese en-
tities are more likely to be predicted.

5 Conclusion

In this research, we have build a Wikification cor-
pus for advancing Japanese Entity Linking. We

have conducted Wikification experiment using us-
ing fine grained semantic classes. Although we ex-
pect an effect of the fine-grained semantic classes,
we could no observe an improvement in terms of
the accuracy on the corpus. The definition of the
target of entity linking annotations requires fur-
ther investigation. We are distributing the cor-
pus on the Web site http://www.cl.ecei.
tohoku.ac.jp/jawikify.
