Abstract

We defend that bilingual lexicons automatically extracted from parallel corpora, whose entries
have been meanwhile validated by linguists and classified as correct or incorrect, should consti-
tute a specific parallel corpora. And, in this paper, we propose to use word-to-word translations to
learn morph-units (comprising of bilingual stems and suffixes) from those bilingual lexicons for
two language pairs L1-L2 and L1-L3 to induce a bilingual lexicon for the language pair L2-L3,
apart from also learning morph-units for this other language pair. The applicability of bilingual
morph-units in L1-L2 and L1-L3 is examined from the perspective of pivot-based lexicon induc-
tion for language pair L2-L3 with L1 as bridge. While the lexicon is derived by transitivity, the
correspondences are identified based on previously learnt bilingual stems and suffixes rather than
surface translation forms. The induced pairs are validated using a binary classifier trained on
morphological and similarity-based features using an existing, automatically acquired, manually
validated bilingual translation lexicon for language pair L2-L3. In this paper, we discuss the use
of English (EN)-French (FR) and English (EN)-Portuguese (PT) lexicon of word-to-word trans-
lations in generating word-to-word translations for the language pair FR-PT with EN as pivot
language. Generated translations are filtered out first using an SVM-based FR-PT classifier and
then are manually validated.

1 Introduction

Translation lexicon coverage is one of the crucial factors influencing effective Machine Translation. To
fill in the gap corresponding to certain missing translation pairs and/or to overcome the difficulties in
acquiring translation lexicons for under-resourced language pairs, one can combine the already available
bilingual knowledge bases using a common language referred to as pivot and hence automatically expand
the translation coverage. Although the pivoted approach to lexicon induction is not new, the novelty of
our approach lies in the use of bilingual morph-units rather than the surface translation forms.

We depart from 3 bilingual lexicons (EN-PT, EN-FR and FR-PT) that were automatically acquired
from aligned parallel corpora using various extraction techniques (Brown et al., 1993; Lardilleux and
Lepage, 2009; Aires et al., 2009; Gomes and Lopes, 2011), whose entries were classified as correct or
incorrect by linguists making use of a bilingual concordancer (Costa et al., 2015). These lexicons will
hence and along the paper be named as validated bilingual lexicons. To be specific, we discuss the use
of EN-FR and EN-PT validated bilingual lexicons in inducing bilingual pairs for FR-PT with EN as the
pivot language.

The task of bilingual lexicon augmentation is approached in two phases involving pivoted induction
and binary classification for subsequent validation of the induced pairs, followed by manual validation.
One of the concerns with pivoted translation induction is the generation of wrong translations primarily
due to polysemy and ambiguous words. Hence, prior to human validation, for selecting the induced
translations in FR-PT, an automatic filter in the form of an SVM-based binary classifier trained on the
validated FR-PT bilingual lexicon is used. For every pair of newly induced morph-units/words in the
first phase, the next phase involves determining whether the two are translations of each other or not.

2 Related Work

While the idea of using pivot language(s) for deriving bilingual lexicon is not new, the approaches differ
with respect to the resources employed (Ács, 2014) (Wushouer et al., 2014b), languages dealt (Saralegi
et al., 2012) (Wushouer et al., 2013) and the post-processing operations involved in selecting unam-
biguous and correct translations (Tanaka and Umemura, 1994) (Kaji and Erdenebat, 2008) (Shezaf and
Rappoport, 2010). Earliest reported work on pivoted dictionary induction is credited to Tanaka et al.
(Tanaka and Umemura, 1994), who proposed the Inverse consultation (IC) approach for pruning wrong
translation candidates. Paik et al. (Paik et al., 2004) argued on the importance of directionality in au-
tomating the dictionary building process. His experiments are based on one-time inverse consultation
method earlier proposed by Tanaka et al. (Tanaka and Umemura, 1994), the overlapping constraint
method for improved equivalent pair extraction rate and the POS-based sorting of newly linked pairs to
avoid polysemous entries.

In an exclusive analysis of the techniques used to filter wrong translation candidates induced by piv-
oting, Saralegi et al. (Saralegi et al., 2011) explored two of the common choices, namely the Inverse
consultation (IC) method (Tanaka and Umemura, 1994) and the Distributional Similarity measure (DS)
(Kaji and Erdenebat, 2008). An outcome of their analysis is that, IC relies on large number of lexical
variants in the dictionaries for each sense in the pivot language. Further, given that DS identifies as
translations those words exhibiting similar distributions or contexts across two corpora of different lan-
guages, it is learnt that, richer context representations and the translation quality of contexts contribute
to its improved performance. Union and linear combination of IC and DS outperforms each of these
measures taken individually. The authors (Saralegi et al., 2012) thereon discuss the applicability of these
methods in building a Basque-Chinese dictionary via English. In a heuristic based approach, Wushouer
et al. (Wushouer et al., 2013) explores the use of probability, semantics and spelling similarity heuristics
for inducing one-to-one mapping dictionary of Uyghur and Kazakh languages from Chinese-Uyghur and
Chinese-Kazakh dictionaries.

In a different study, transitive lexicon induction is centred on multilingual lexical databases such as,
lexicon of language-specific word variants, lexemes and collocations, with the validation of new pairs
achieved through parallel corpus consultation (Nerima and Wehrli, 2008). Another research (Ács, 2014)
on augmenting existing dictionaries in multiple languages, relies on Wiktionary for exploring the links
between translations. While exploiting the fact that pairs found via several pivot languages are more
precise than those found via one (Tanaka and Umemura, 1994), Ács (Ács, 2014) proposes to extend
IC (Tanaka and Umemura, 1994) from using single pivot up to 53 pivots (Ács, 2014). Addressing the
task as an optimisation problem, Wushouer et al. (Wushouer et al., 2014a; Wushouer et al., 2014b),
proposed extended constraint optimisation model, formalised on Integer Linear Programming for pivot-
based dictionary induction of closely related languages by employing multiple dictionaries.

In each of the afore-mentioned approaches, new correspondences are induced by exploiting surface
translation forms in two language pairs with one or more language(s) as bridge. In contrast, our approach
deviates from transitive induction scheme discussed above with respect to the resources employed in
learning correspondences. A specific distinction in our approach is that the resources used for pivot-
ing consist of bilingual morph-units learnt using the bilingual learning method (Karimbi Mahesh et al.,
2014a), unlike the traditional surface translation forms. To be specific, for each language pair the knowl-
edge base employed in the experiments consists of bilingual stems, bilingual suffixes as explained in
Section 3 and illustrated in Table 1.

3 Background - Bilingual Segments as Knowledge Base

Fundamental to the pivoted induction strategy are the bilingual resources comprising of bilingual stems
and bilingual suffixes learnt from validated bilingual lexicons for the language pairs EN-FR and EN-PT
extracted from the aligned parallel corpora1 using various extraction techniques (Brown et al., 1993;
Lardilleux and Lepage, 2009; Gomes, 2009; Aires et al., 2009; Gomes and Lopes, 2011). The meth-
ods proposed by Brown et al. (Brown et al., 1993) and Lardilleux and Lepage (Lardilleux and Lepage,

2009) were employed for an initial extraction as they do not require a priori validated lexicons. The
former is based on corpus-wide frequency counts and provides an alignment for every word in the cor-
pus, while the latter is based on random sub-corpus sampling, improving precision for some words
but being omissive with respect to others. The alignment method proposed by Gomes (Gomes, 2009)
projects the validated bilingual lexicons into the parallel corpus, aligning known expressions, and leav-
ing the remainder words unaligned. The extraction method proposed by Aires et al. (Aires et al., 2009)
uses these alignments as anchors to infer alignments of neighbouring unaligned words, based on co-
occurrence statistics. Finally, the method proposed by Gomes and Lopes (Gomes and Lopes, 2011) com-
bines these co-occurrence statistics with a spelling similarity score, SpSim, which is trained to recognize
cognate words by learning regular spelling differences from previously validated bilingual cognates such
as [ph]arm[a]c[y]↔[f]arm[á]c[ia] (EN-PT).

Induction of bilingual stems and suffixes follows the bilingual learning approach (Karimbi Mahesh et
al., 2014a) applied on the bilingual lexicon of word-to-word translations for each of the language pairs
EN-PT and EN-FR. The approach being purely suffixation based induces bilingual stems, suffixes and
bilingual suffix replacement rules that allow one translation form to be obtained from the other (by iden-
tifying clusters of bilingual suffixes that associate with a set of induced bilingual stems). The bilingual
stems and suffixes learnt, when productively combined, enable new translations to be suggested. Col-
lectively, these bilingual stems and suffixes are referred to as bilingual morph-units and are fundamental
to the pivoted translation suggestion task elaborated in the forthcoming sections. A bilingual stem con-
flates various inflected surface forms of a translation. The bilingual suffixes represent morphological
extensions for the bilingual stems. The approach is illustrated below for the language pair EN-FR.

1. Decompose each bilingual pair in the lexicon as bilingual stems and bilingual suffixes by pairing
similar translations.
Example: Split pair of translations ‘ensured’⇔ ‘assuré’ and ‘ensuring’⇔ ‘assurer’ into bilingual
stem (‘ensur’⇔ ‘assur’) with bilingual morphological extensions (‘ed’, ‘é’) and (‘ing’, ‘er’).

2. Group all the bilingual suffixes that associate with each of the bilingual stem identified in Step
1. Hence identify the bilingual suffix transformations (replacement rules). Each such grouping
indicates the possibility of obtaining one surface form from another.
Example:
(‘ensure’, ‘assure’) : (‘’, ‘r’) (‘d’, ‘ée’) (‘d’, ‘és’) (‘d’, ‘ées’) (‘d’, ‘é’)
(‘ensur’, ‘assur’) : (‘e’, ‘er’) (‘ed’, ‘é’) (‘ed’, ‘ée’) (‘ing’, ‘er’) (‘ed’, ‘és’) (‘ed’, ‘ées’)
represent randomly selected groupings learnt from inflected translation forms ‘ensured’⇔ ‘assuré’,
‘ensuring’⇔ ‘assurer’ and so forth.

3. Eliminate redundant groups by retaining those bilingual stems that share higher number of transfor-
mations.
Example: Among the two examples in the step 2, the second group (‘ensur’, ‘assur’) : (‘e’, ‘er’)
(‘ed’, ‘é’) (‘ed’, ‘ée’) (‘ing’, ‘er’) (‘ed’, ‘és’) (‘ed’, ‘ées’) is retained.

4. Generalise the bilingual suffix replacement rules by looking for other bilingual stems sharing iden-
tical transformations. In other words, this involves identification of bilingual suffix clusters (set of
bilingual stems sharing same bilingual suffix transformations).
Example: (‘increas’, ‘augment’): (‘e’, ‘er’) (‘ed’, ‘é’) (‘ed’, ‘ée’) (‘ing’, ‘er’) (‘ed’, ‘és’) (‘ed’,
‘ées’) represents another grouping, where the bilingual stem (‘increas’, ‘augment’) shares same
bilingual morphological extensions as the bilingual stem (‘ensur’, ‘assur’) and hence both bilingual
stems belong to the same cluster.

The partition approach provided in the clustering tool kit CLUTO2 was used to identify the clusters
of bilingual suffixes.

4 Approach Outline

The proposed approach works in two phases. Given the list of bilingual stems learnt from validated bilin-
gual lexicons for the language pairs EN-FR and EN-PT as briefed in the Section 3, we derive a lexicon

63



of bilingual stems for the language pair FR-PT by inducing transitive correspondences between bilingual
stems of EN-FR and EN-PT with the common language EN. Having determined the bilingual stems for
the language pair FR-PT as mentioned, the associated morphological extensions in the form of bilin-
gual suffixes are gathered for each newly induced bilingual stem based on the transitive correspondences
between bilingual suffixes for EN-FR and EN-PT. We impose the constraint that, the bilingual suffixes
representing transitive correspondences should occur substantial number of times in the reference set of
bilingual suffixes learnt from FR-PT validated lexicon. Newly induced correspondences require valida-
tion, as not all of the generated translations are correct. Thus post-generation, prior to manual validation,
we classify the generated pairs into one of the pre-defined correct or incorrect classes.

Table 1 instantiates the use of EN-FR and EN-PT bilingual morph-units in learning new correspon-
dences for FR-PT, with EN as the pivot language. In the second column of the table, the second and
the third rows respectively show the known bilingual stems for each of the language pairs EN-FR and
EN-PT. Similarly, the following columns in the second and third rows show the known bilingual suffixes
attached to the corresponding bilingual stems shown in column 2. The last row shows the newly induced
stem pairs for the target language pair FR-PT and their associated morphological extensions (suffix pairs)
obtained by transitivity.

4.1 Pivoting Stem and Suffix Correspondences
First, using the list of bilingual stems for two language pairs L1-L2 and L1-L3 represented as relational
tables, we perform a relational natural join over common stem in language L13.

10: end if
11: end for
12: end procedure

Let AL1−L2 and AL1−L3 be the lexicons consisting of bilingual stems for the language pairs L1-L2
and L1-L3 respectively. Further, let SL2−L3 be the list of bilingual suffixes learnt from validated lex-
icon for L2-L3. This list of bilingual suffixes is obtained by applying the bilingual learning approach
(Karimbi Mahesh et al., 2014a) on the validated bilingual lexicon for L2-L3. The list serves in identi-
fying valid bilingual suffixes from the set of candidate bilingual suffixes (for L2-L3) induced following

3Alternatively, we may perform search and replace operation on the bilingual stem file for L1-L3 using a two-column table
(consisting of stems in L1 as first column and their corresponding translations in L2 as the second column) for L1-L2.

transitive correspondences between the bilingual suffixes for L1-L2 and L1-L3 over common suffix in
L1 (L1 is the pivot language).

Initially, we perform a natural join on the relational tables for the bilingual lexicons AL1−L2 and
AL1−L3 over common stems of the pivot language L1. Consequently, we obtain a lexicon of candidate
bilingual stems for the language pairs L2-L3.

After the candidate bilingual stems are determined for the language pair L2-L3 as specified, the asso-
ciated bilingual suffixes are predicted for each induced bilingual stem in L2-L3 based on the transitive
correspondences between bilingual suffixes for L1-L2 and L1-L3 over common suffix in L1 (as enumer-
ated in the steps 3 through 9 of the Algorithm 1). However, this results in an exhaustive list of candidate
bilingual suffix correspondences, for each candidate bilingual stem induced in the previous step. Hence,
the selection of valid correspondences from this initial list of candidate bilingual suffix correspondences
is done in consultation with SL2−L3, the list of known bilingual suffixes for L2-L3, i.e., valid correspon-
dences between suffixes in L2 and L3 are determined based on their occurrence frequencies in SL2−L3.
Candidate bilingual suffixes (following transitive correspondences between suffixes in L1-L2 and L1-L3)
with occurrence frequency less than 3 as observed in the bilingual suffix list for L2-L3 are discarded. Set-
ting the occurrence frequency threshold below this value leads to over-generation of surface translation
forms dropping the translation generation precision below 60%.

To illustrate the above outlined procedure, consider the examples in Table 1. The last row in the table
represents the newly induced bilingual correspondences for FR-PT following the transitive correspon-
dences between bilingual stems and suffixes in EN-FR (second row) and EN-PT (third row). For ex-
ample, (‘délivr’, ‘emit’) represents the new bilingual stem induced following transitive correspondences
between the known bilingual stems (‘deliver’, ‘délivr’) in EN-FR and (‘deliver’, ‘emit’) in EN-PT. The
candidate bilingual suffixes that associate with (‘délivr’, ‘emit’) are (‘er’, ‘ir’) following the transitive
correspondences between bilingual suffixes (‘’, ‘er’) in EN-FR and (‘’, ‘ir’) in EN-PT and similarly, (‘é’,
‘ido’), (‘é’, ‘iu’), (‘és’, ‘ido’) and (‘és’, ‘iu’) following correspondences between (‘ed’, ‘é’) in EN-FR
and (‘ed’, ‘ido’), (‘ed’, ‘iu’) in EN-PT and between (‘ed’, ‘és’) in EN-FR and (‘ed’, ‘ido’), (‘ed’, ‘iu’)
in EN-PT. Looking for the occurrence frequencies of each of these correspondences in the FR-PT bilin-
gual suffix list, SFR−PT , learnt from validated FR-PT lexicon, we choose to either retain or discard the
associated suffixes.

4.2 Generation of Surface forms

Surface translation forms can be interpreted as the concatenation of newly induced bilingual stems and
their associated suffixes. For instance, simple concatenation of the bilingual stem (‘délivr’, ‘emit’) with
associated bilingual suffix (‘er’, ‘ir’) yields the surface form (‘délivrer’, ‘emitir’).

4.3 Validation as Binary Classification

We evaluate the newly induced FR-PT pairs by using the validated FR-PT bilingual lexicon for super-
vised learning and combining varied features derived from that lexicon. We train a SVM-based binary
classifier that assigns each of the induced bilingual pairs into one of the previously defined correct or
incorrect classes. Features (Karimbi Mahesh et al., 2014b) characterising correct and incorrect bilingual
pairs are briefed in the Subsection 4.3.1.

4.3.1 Stem and Suffix Coverage
We view a bilingual translation to be composed of two bilingual morphological segments, the bilingual
stem and bilingual suffix. The stem and suffix coverage refers to the content (stem) and inflectional
(suffix) coverage exhibited by the bilingual pair under evaluation. The coverage is determined as the
agreement between morphological units comprising of stem in one language and its translation in another
language and between their morphological extensions, respectively. The features are binary valued, each
representing the stem coverage (MCstm) and suffix coverage (MCsfx), thus characterising the bilingual
pair to be validated. For any bilingual pair, a feature value ‘0’ indicates coverage, while ‘1’ indicates
mis-coverage, with respect to the morph-unit under evaluation (stem or suffix). The two features may be
collectively referred to as the morphological coverage feature (MCstm+sfx).

To check for parallelism with respect to stems, the left hand side term of the stem pair (FR-PT) to be
validated is matched against the set of all stems in first language (FR), learnt from the validated lexicon

65



(training dataset of correct translations) for FR-PT. Similarly, we check if a match is found for the right
hand side of the candidate stem pair in the set of known stems for PT. If matched stems are found with
respect to first and second languages and further happen to be translations of one another (i.e., bilingual
stem pairs), then the candidate translation under test is said to be covered with respect to stem. The
set of stems for FR and PT are represented as separate keyword trees (Gusfield, 1997) and are learnt
by applying the bilingual learning approach (Karimbi Mahesh et al., 2014a) on the FR-PT lexicon of
word-to-word translations. Alternatively, existing stemmer may be employed for the purpose. Aho-
corasick set-matching algorithm (Gusfield, 1997) is applied to allow faster search over the known stems
represented as keyword tree.

As elaborated in Section 4.1, the bilingual suffixes that attach to a bilingual stem are chosen based
on their occurrence frequencies in the bilingual suffix list learnt from FR-PT validated lexicon. Hence,
naturally, the bilingual pair satisfies the suffix agreement requirement and hence is covered with respect
to suffix.

For instance, consider the newly induced correspondences (‘délivr’, ‘emit’) and their associated bilin-
gual suffixes, (‘er’, ‘ir’), (‘é’, ‘ido’) with surface forms (‘délivrer’, ‘emitir’), (‘délivré’, ‘emitido’). We
check if ‘délivr’ matches the set of stems in FR represented as a keyword tree. If so, we check if ‘emit’
matches the set of stems in PT. If a match is found in both the languages, we check if (‘délivr’, ‘emit’)
appears as valid stem pair in the set of bilingual stems learnt from FR-PT validated lexicon. MCstm is
set to 0 if the candidate stem pair is found, else is set to 1. For any induced translation, the feature value
representing the suffix coverage is set to 0. This is because, for each bilingual stem induced via pivoting,
its bilingual extensions are those bilingual suffixes (transitive correspondences) that are observed at least
three times in the bilingual suffix list learnt from training dataset for FR-PT.

5 Experimental Setup

5.1 Datasets for Pivoted Induction

The bilingual segments (stems and suffixes) used for pivoted induction were learnt from validated EN-
FR and EN-PT bilingual lexicons. The statistics of the bilingual resources for EN-PT and EN-FR used
in pivot based lexicon induction is as shown in Table 2. For each of the language pairs listed in first
column, the second column shows the count of manually accepted word-to-word translations used in
acquiring the bilingual resources comprising of stem pairs and suffix pairs. Similarly, the third, fourth
and fifth columns respectively show the statistics of bilingual stems, suffixes and bilingual suffix classes
learnt. A suffix class corresponds to set of bilingual suffixes representing bilingual extensions for a set of
bilingual stems. It may or may not correspond to Part-of-Speech such as noun, verb, adverb or adjective.
However, there are cases where the same suffix class aggregates nouns, adjectives and adverbs.

5.2 Datasets for Classification

In order to train a binary classifier capable of evaluating the newly induced FR-PT bilingual pairs, a
total of 162,790 word-to-word bilingual pairs were used as the training dataset. 116,621 accepted word-
to-word translations were used as positive examples while 46,169 rejected entries formed the negative
examples. The FR-PT training and test datasets used in training and testing the classifier were extracted
using the approaches mentioned in the Section 3.

5.3 SVM-based Binary Classifier
SVM based tool, LIBSVM4 was used to learn the binary classifier. Grid-search was performed on RBF
kernel parameters (C, γ) using cross-validation to enable accurate predictions for the test data.

The SVM-based FR-PT classifier for word-word translations with a micro average f-measure (Equa-
tion 8) approximating 80% (last row of the Table 4) when tested on the test dataset shown in Table 3,
trained with the features elaborated in Section 4.3, was used in classifying the newly induced bilingual
morph-units. The classifier was trained using the string similarity based features (StrSim), apart from the
features regarding stem pairs and suffix pairs. Orthographic similarity measure based on edit distance
(Levenshtein, 1966) was used to quantify the similarity between terms on either sides of the bilingual
pair (surface form).

6 Evaluation

The evaluation metrics for the classifier and the translation suggestion task are elaborated in the Subsec-
tions 6.1 and 6.2 respectively.

6.1 Classification
The classifier results were evaluated with the standard evaluation metrics, Precision (P), Recall (R) and
Accuracy, for accepted (Acc) and rejected (Rej) translation pairs, and are computed as given below:

PRej = tn/(tn + fn) (1)

PAcc = tp/(tp + fp) (2)

RAcc = tp/(tp + fn) (3)

RRej = tn/(tn + fp) (4)

Accuracy = (tp + tn)/(tp + fp + tn + fn) (5)

In the equations 1 through 5, tp is the number of terms correctly classified as accepted, tn is the number
of terms correctly classified as rejected, fp is the number of incorrect terms misclassified as accepted
and fn is the number of correct terms misclassified as rejected. PAcc and RAcc denotes precision and
recall for the accepted class, and PRej and RRej represents precision and recall for the rejected class.

To assess the global performance over both classes, the Micro-average Precision (µP ), Micro-average
Recall (µR) and Micro-average f-measure (µF ) were used, and calculated as shown in equations 6
through 8 below:

µP = (PAcc + PRej)/2 (6)
4A library for support vector machines - Software available at http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/˜cjlin/libsvm

67



µR = (RAcc +RRej)/2 (7)

µF = 2 ∗ µP ∗ µR/(µP + µR) (8)
6.2 Generation
The precision for generated bilingual pairs5 is calculated as the fraction of correctly generated bilingual
pairs to the total number of bilingual pairs generated.

6.2.1 Manual Evaluation
Manual classifications are based on the observations that certain translations are wrong (incomplete or
inadequate) (examples labelled as ‘Reject’ in Table 7). For instance, some of the newly suggested trans-
lations are inadequate as they miss an auxiliary verb form in French or a relative pronoun in Portuguese
or a negation expression “n’...pas” in French that is also missing in Portuguese (‘não’). Despite adjective
gender differences in French and Portuguese, no one will be able to know a priori the chosen translation
for any noun and the adjective number and gender in French (or in Portuguese) will depend on the chosen
French (Portuguese) noun translation.

7 Results and Discussion

As summarised in Table 5, experiments using EN-FR and EN-PT lexicons enabled induction of 28,755
unique transitive bilingual stem correspondences with 1,047 unique bilingual suffix correspondences for
FR-PT, contributing to a total of 272,193 unique word-to-word surface translation candidates.

stem pairs were orthographically similar (cognates). 19,946 bilingual stem correspondences did not exist
in the training data used for classification.

Evaluation of 126 pivoted FR-PT bilingual suffixes-only show that 108 of them were correct and

translations) indicates precision approximating 60%.

Among the 272,193 FR-PT inflected word-to-word translations generated via pivoted induction, it
was observed that 234,000 were new entries that had not been extracted by any other methods. 38,000
entries had already been extracted by other methods. 39,000 of the new translations generated by pivoted
induction (that have not been extracted by any other method) did occur in the parallel corpora, with
13,000 entries co-occurring only once, 7,000 co-occurring twice and 2,000 co-occurring three times.

It is to be noted that the above stated results were achieved using all of the bilingual stems and suffixes
learnt from the EN-PT and EN-FR lexicon. The automatically learnt bilingual resources comprising
of bilingual stems and suffixes that served as knowledge bases for pivoting FR-PT translations were
evaluated indirectly in terms of the generation precision considering new translations (surface forms)
suggested. Generation precision (computed as specified in Subsection 6.2) was respectively 90%6 for
EN-PT and 81.55%7 for EN-FR. As all of the automatically learnt bilingual stems and suffixes were used
in our experiments, restricting the knowledge bases used in pivoting to only correct bilingual segments
would further improve the results.

7.1 Error Analysis

Some of the French suffixes ‘é’, ‘ée’, ‘és’, ‘ées’, ‘u’, ‘ue’ (and others) were wrongly paired with ‘ou’,
‘aram’, ‘eu’, ‘eram’, ‘iu’, ‘iram’ in PT. Generally, these past participle French forms need an auxiliary
verb in French, ‘a’ or ‘ont’, to give rise to a form in Portuguese ending in ‘ou’, ‘aram’, ‘eu’, ‘eram’,
‘iu’, ‘iram’ and these correspond to verb forms in English ending in ‘ed’ that sometimes occur with
auxiliary verb forms ‘has’ or ‘have’. Examples include ‘a soutenu’ (FR) ⇔ ‘supported’ (EN) ⇔ ‘has
supported’ (EN)⇔ ‘apoiou’ (PT) and ‘ont suscité’ (FR)⇔ ‘provoked’ (EN)⇔ ‘have provoked’ (EN)
⇔ ‘provocaram’ (PT). It is the generation of single word form in English that gives rise to those errors.
An infinitive in French (as ‘soutenir’) never translates as a present indicative form, either in subjunctive
mood (as ‘apoiem’) or in indicative mood (as ‘apoiam’) in Portuguese and requires some extensions both
in French (a preposition as ‘à’, ‘de’, etc.) and in Portuguese (a relative pronoun as ‘que’).

Table 7: Manual classifications for newly generated translations using the pivoted induction approach
(FR-PT). The columns ‘Accept’ and ‘Reject’ show correct and wrong translations respectively. The
column ‘Corresponding Correct Forms’ just illustrates some of the correct translations into Portuguese
corresponding to wrong translation inducted from FR-PT

FR-PT Corresponding Correct Forms
Accept Reject

soutenir⇔ apoiarem soutenir⇔ apoiam à soutenir⇔ que apoiam
soutenir⇔ apoiar soutenir⇔ apoiem de soutenir⇔ que apoiem
soutenu⇔ apoiado soutenu⇔ apoiou a soutenu⇔ apoiou
soutenue⇔ apoiado soutenue⇔ apoiou este soutenue⇔ apoiou-se
suscité⇔ provocado suscité⇔ provocaram ont suscité⇔ provocaram
suscitées⇔ provocados suscité⇔ provocou a suscité⇔ provocou
suscitées⇔ provocadas suscitées⇔ provocaram ont été suscitées⇔ provocaram-se
adaptant⇔ adaptarem adaptant⇔ adaptem adaptant⇔ que adaptem
adaptant⇔ adaptando adaptant⇔ adaptem n’adaptant pas⇔ que não adaptem

In what regards suffixes ‘é’, ‘ée’, ‘és’, ‘ées’, when auxiliary verb in French is ‘est’ or ‘sont’ we have a
passive form that generally translates as a passive form in English, while in Portuguese it requires either
an auxiliary verb form, as ‘é’ or ‘são’, or requires a passive clitic ‘se’. Even French may use the clitic ‘se’
or ‘s’ and auxiliary verb ‘être’ (‘ést’ and ‘sont’), or the clitic ‘on’ and auxiliary ‘a’ or ‘ont’ (for singular
and plural). Suffixes ‘é’, ‘ée’, ‘és’, ‘ées’ in French belong to a verbal group ending in ‘er’, as is the case
of ‘susciter’.

6Precision shown corresponds to 2,334 evaluated EN-PT surface forms out of a total of 14,530 pairs generated, where 2,283
were correct and 20 were incorrect

7Among the evaluated 4254 entries, out of a total of 18,095 EN-FR bilingual pairs generated, 3469 were correct and 785
were incorrect.

8 Conclusion

In this paper, we have explored the possibility of inducing a bilingual lexicon for the language pair FR-PT
by learning transitive correspondences between bilingual stems and suffixes for the language pair EN-FR
and EN-PT. Unlike the traditional induction scheme using surface translation forms, we used resources
comprising of bilingual stems and suffixes as basis for the pivoted induction. Our approach relies on
initially learning suffixes and suffixation operations from validated bilingual lexicons of word-to-word
translations using a bilingual learning framework. The bilingual segments thus learnt are then utilised in
suggesting new translations using pivoted induction strategy.

Newly induced pairs were validated using an SVM-based binary classifier trained on morphological
and similarity based features learnt from validated FR-PT bilingual translation lexicon. Manual valida-
tion of the induced surface forms shows precision approximating 60%. The results may be improved by
using only those bilingual segments that have been classified as ‘accepted’. As future work, we intend
to experiment with other language pairs such as EN-PT and EN-HI, EN-LT and EN-PT. Experiments on
pivoted induction with morphologically rich language as pivot needs to examined. The bilingual morph-
units may enable compact representation of bilingual lexicon, apart from their applicability in inducing
surface inflected forms.
