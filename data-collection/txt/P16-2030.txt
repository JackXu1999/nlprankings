Abstract

Here we seek to automatically identify
Hungarian patients suffering from mild
cognitive impairment (MCI) based on
linguistic features collected from their
speech transcripts. Our system uses ma-
chine learning techniques and is based on
several linguistic features like characteris-
tics of spontaneous speech as well as fea-
tures exploiting morphological and syn-
tactic parsing. Our results suggest that
it is primarily morphological and speech-
based features that help distinguish MCI
patients from healthy controls.

1 Background

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a heteroge-
neous set of symptoms that are essential in the
early detection of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) (Ne-
gash et al., 2007). Symptoms such as language
dysfunctions may occur even nine years before the
actual diagnosis (APA, 2000). Thus, the language
use of the patient may often indicate MCI well be-
fore the clinical diagnosis of dementia.

MCI is known to influence the (spontaneous)
speech of the patient via three main aspects. First,
verbal fluency declines, which results in longer
hesitations and a lower speech rate (Roark et al.,
2011). Second, the lexical frequency of words and
part-of-speech tags may also change significantly
as the patient has problems with finding words
(Croot et al., 2000). Third, the emotional respon-
siveness of the patient was also observed to change
in many cases (Lopez-de Ipiña et al., 2015).

For many patients, MCI is never recognized as
in the early stage of the disease it is not trivial
even for experts to detect cognitive impairment:
according to Boise et al. (2004), up to 50% of MCI

patients are never diagnosed with MCI. Although
there are well known tests such as the Mini Men-
tal Test, they are usually not sensitive enough to
reliably filter out MCI in its early stage. Tests on
linguistic memory prove more efficient in detect-
ing MCI, but they tend to yield a relatively high
number of false positive diagnoses (Roark et al.,
2011).

Although language abilities are impaired from
an early stage of the disease, evaluating the lan-
guage capacities of the patients has only received
marginal attention when diagnosing AD (Bayles,
1982). However, if diagnosed early, a proper med-
ical treatment may delay the occurrence of other
(more severe) symptoms of dementia to the latest
extent possible (Kálmán et al., 2013).

Here we seek to automatically identify Hungar-
ian patients suffering from mild cognitive impair-
ment based on their speech transcripts. Our sys-
tem uses machine learning techniques and is based
on several features like linguistic characteristics of
spontaneous speech as well as features exploiting
morphological and syntactic parsing.

Recently, several studies have reported results
on identifying different types of dementia with
NLP and speech recognition techniques. For in-
stance, automatic speech recognition tools were
employed in detecting aphasia (Fraser et al.,
2013b; Fraser et al., 2014; Fraser et al., 2013a)
and mild cognitive impairment (Lehr et al., 2012),
and Alzheimer’s Disease (Baldas et al., 2010; Satt
et al., 2014). Jarrold et al. (2014) distinguished
four types of dementia on the basis of spontaneous
speech samples. Lexical analysis of spontaneous
speech may also indicate different types of demen-
tia (Bucks et al., 2000; Holmes and Singh, 1996)
and may be exploited in the automatic detection
of patients suffering from dementia (Thomas et al.,

181



2005). As for analyzing written language, changes
in the writing style of people may also refer to de-
mentia (Garrard et al., 2005; Hirst and Wei Feng,
2012; Le et al., 2011).

Concerning the automatic detection of MCI in
Hungarian subjects, Tóth et al. (2015) experi-
mented with speech recognition techniques. How-
ever, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first
attempt to identify MCI on the basis of written
texts, i.e. speech transcripts for Hungarian.

In the long run, we would like to develop a sys-
tem that can automatically detect linguistic symp-
toms of MCI in its early stage, so that the per-
son can get medical treatment as early as possible.
It should be noted, however, that our goal cannot
be an official diagnosis as diagnosing patients re-
quires medical experience. All we can do is imple-
ment a test supported by methods used in artificial
intelligence, which indicates whether the patient is
at risk and if so, s/he can turn to medical experts
who will provide the clinical diagnosis.

2 Data

In our experiments1, two short animated films
were presented to the patients at the memory am-
bulance of the University of Szeged. Patients were
asked to talk about the first film then about their
previous day, and lastly, about the second film.
Their speech productions were recorded and tran-
scribed by linguists, who explicitly marked speech
phenomena like hesitations and pauses in the tran-
scripts. These transcripts formed the basis of our
experiments, i.e. we exploited only written infor-
mation.

All of our 84 subjects were native speakers of
Hungarian, a morphologically rich language. For
each person, a clinical diagnosis was at our dis-
posal, i.e. it was clinically proved whether the pa-
tient suffers from MCI or not. On the basis of these
data, subjects were classified as either MCI patient
or healthy control at the university memorial. Ta-
ble 1 shows data on the subjects’ gender and di-
agnosis while Table 2 shows the mean values for
age and education (in terms of years attended at
school).

Speech transcripts reflect several characteristics
of spontaneous speech. On the one hand, they con-
tain several forms of hesitations and silent pauses,

1Our experiments conform to all operative rules and re-
strictions on data collection, anonymization and publication
according to the requirements in the European Union.

which are also marked in the transcripts, on the
other hand, they abound in phenomena typical of
spontaneous Hungarian speech such as phonolog-
ical deletion (mer instead of the standard form
mert “because” or ement instead of the standard
form elment “(he) left”) and lengthening (utánna
instead of the standard form utána “then”). There
are duplications (ez ezt “this this-ACC”) and ne-
ologisms created by the speaker (feltkáva, which
probably means főtt kávé “boiled coffee”).

Fillers also deserve special attention when
studying transcripts. Besides hesitations, we
treated words and phrases referring to some kind
of uncertainty together with indefinite pronouns
as fillers such as ilyen “such”, olyan “such”, izé
“thing, gadget”, és aztán “and then”, valamilyen
“some kind of”, valahogy “somehow”, valamerre
“somewhere”2. Thus, MCI patients often seem to
substitute content words with fillers or indefinite
pronouns, moreover, they also appear to use lots of
paraphrases, which also indicate uncertainty just
like egy ilyen bagolyszerűség a such owl-likeness
“something similar to an owl” or az olyan délelőtt
volt that such morning was “that happened some
time in the morning”.

3 Experiments

In order to determine the status of the subjects, we
experimented with machine learning tools. The
task was regarded as binary classification, i.e. sub-
jects were classified as either an MCI patient or a
healthy control, on the basis of a feature set de-
rived from their transcripts.

At first, transcripts were morphologically and
syntactically analysed with magyarlanc, a linguis-
tic preprocessing toolkit developed for Hungarian

2This words seem to have a lot in common with weasel
and hedge words, which refer to uncertainty (Vincze, 2013).

182



(Zsibrita et al., 2013). For classification, we ex-
ploited morphological, syntactic and semantic fea-
tures extracted from the output of magyarlanc.

Each person was asked to recall three differ-
ent stories. As MCI is strongly related to mem-
ory deficit, we believe that the order of the tasks
might also influence performance, hence we opted
for processing each transcript separately. Thus, for
each person, features to be discussed below were
calculated separately for the three transcripts and
all of them were exploited in the system.

3.1 Feature set

In our experiments, we employed features of spon-
taneous speech and morphological and semantic
features derived from the transcripts and their au-
tomatic linguistic analyses. When defining our
features, we took into account the fact that the
speech of MCI patients may contain more pauses
and hesitations than that of healthy controls (Tóth
et al., 2015) and they are also supposed to have
a restricted vocabulary due to cognitive deficit,
which may affect the choice of words and the fre-
quency of parts of speech (Croot et al., 2000) and
might even yield neologisms. We also made use
of demographic features that were at our disposal.

Our feature set contained the following features:
Spontaneous speech based features:
number of filled and silent pauses; number and

rate of hesitations compared to the number of to-
kens; number of pauses that follow an article and
precede content words as this might reflect that
MCI patients may have difficulties with finding the
appropriate content words; number of lengthened
sounds (which we considered as a special form of
hesitation).

Morphological features:
number of tokens and words; number and rate

of distinct lemmas; number of punctuation marks;
number and rate of nouns, verbs, adjectives, pro-
nouns and conjunctions; number of first person
singular verbs as it might also be indicative how
often the patient reflects to him/herself; number
and rate of unanalyzed words, i.e. those with an
“unknown” POS tag, which might indicate neolo-
gisms created by the speaker on the spot.

Semantic features:
number and rate of fillers and uncertain words

compared to the number of all tokens; number
and rate of words/phrases related to memory ac-
tivity (e.g. nem emlékszem not remember-1SG “I

can’t remember”) as they directly signal prob-
lems with memory and recall; number of nega-
tion words; number and rate of content words and
function words; number of thematic words related
to the content of the films, based on manually con-
structed lists.

Demographic features:
gender; age; education.

The mean values for each feature are reported
in Table 3.

3.2 Statistical analysis of features

In order to reveal which features can most effec-
tively distinguish healthy controls from MCI pa-
tients, we carried out a statistical analysis of the
data (t-tests for each feature and transcript). For
most of the features, significant differences were
found between the two groups – p-values are listed
in Table 3. The age of the patients also indicates
significant differences: people who were at least
71 years old were more probable to suffer from
MCI than those who were younger at the time of
the experiment (p = 0.0124).

According to the data, each group of features
has a significant effect in distinguishing controls
and MCI patients. It is shown that it is mostly the
second transcript (the one including the narratives
about the subjects’ previous days) where signif-
icant differences may be found among MCI pa-
tients and the control group. However, significant
differences exist for the other two types of texts as
well.

3.3 Machine learning experiments

To automatically identify MCI patients, we ex-
ploited machine learning techniques, i.e. sup-
port vector machines (SVM) (Cortes and Vapnik,
1995) with the default settings of Weka (Hall et al.,
2009) and due to the small size of the dataset, we
applied leave-one-out cross validation. As a base-
line, majority labeling was used. For the evalua-
tion, the accuracy, precision, recall and F-measure
metrics were utilized.

In order to examine the effect of certain groups
of features, we carried out an ablation study,
i.e. we retrained the system without making use
of one specific group of features. The results and
differences are shown in Table 4.

4 Results and Discussion

Using all the features, our system managed to
achieve an accuracy score of 69.1%, that is, 58
out of the 84 patients were correctly diagnosed.
12 patients were falsely diagnosed as healthy and
14 controls were falsely labeled as MCI patients.
Our results outperformed the baseline (57.14% in
terms of accuracy). The system got a high recall
value for MCI patients (75.0) but a lower one for
controls (61.1), which is encouraging in the light
of the fact that our main goal is to identify the
widest possible range of potential MCI patients,
who can turn to clinical experts to find out what
their clinical diagnosis is.

We also experimented with using only features
that displayed statistically significant differences
among controls and MCI patients (see Table 3).
Somewhat surprisingly, an accuracy of 75% could
be achieved in this way, which indicates that some
of our original features are superfluous and just
confused the system, and this result needs further
investigation.

An ablation study was also carried out to an-
alyze the added value of each feature group.
Speech-based, demographic and morphological
features unequivocally contributed to perfor-
mance. However, the effect of semantic features
seems less obvious as they harm performance
taken as a whole but some individual semantic fea-
tures are useful for the system, as shown by the re-
sults achieved with just using significant features.

When investigating the errors made by our sys-
tem, we found that MCI patients that spoke only
a few short sentences were often classified as
healthy controls. They had a lower number and
rate of hesitations and pauses, moreover, their
vocabulary contained fewer fillers and uncertain

words, and these features resemble those typical
of healthy controls. What is more, healthy sub-
jects who talked more also hesitated more, which
might be indicative of MCI. Furthermore, their use
of pronouns and conjunctions was also more sim-
ilar to those of MCI patients, hence the system
falsely predicted a positive diagnosis for them.

Due to the specific characteristics of the data
and the complexity of data collection – which
requires clinical experiments – our dataset can
be expanded only step by step. However, we
found statistically significant differences among
MCI patients and healthy controls concerning sev-
eral linguistic and speech-based features even in
our small dataset, which may be beneficial for our
future experiments and might be also exploited by
those who study spontaneous speech.

5 Conclusions

In this study, we introduced our system that au-
tomatically detects Hungarian patients suffering
from mild cognitive impairment on the basis of
their speech transcripts. The system is based on
features derived from morphological and syntactic
analysis as well as characteristics of spontaneous
speech. Both statistical and machine learning re-
sults revealed that morphological and spontaneous
speech-based features have an essential role in dis-
tinguishing MCI patients from healthy controls.

In the future, we would like to extend our
dataset with new transcripts. Also, we intend to
improve our machine learning system and inves-
tigate the role of semantic features. Lastly, we
would like to integrate features from automatic
speech recognition into our system so that tools
from both speech technology and natural language
processing can contribute to the automatic detec-
tion of mild cognitive impairment.
