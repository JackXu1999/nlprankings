Abstract

Human verbal communication includes
affective messages which are conveyed
through use of emotionally colored words.
There has been a lot of research in this
direction but the problem of integrat-
ing state-of-the-art neural language mod-
els with affective information remains
an area ripe for exploration. In this
paper, we propose an extension to an
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) lan-
guage model for generating conversa-
tional text, conditioned on affect cate-
gories. Our proposed model, Affect-LM
enables us to customize the degree of
emotional content in generated sentences
through an additional design parameter.
Perception studies conducted using Ama-
zon Mechanical Turk show that Affect-
LM generates naturally looking emotional
sentences without sacrificing grammatical
correctness. Affect-LM also learns affect-
discriminative word representations, and
perplexity experiments show that addi-
tional affective information in conversa-
tional text can improve language model
prediction.

1 Introduction

Affect is a term that subsumes emotion and longer
term constructs such as mood and personality
and refers to the experience of feeling or emo-
tion (Scherer et al., 2010). Picard (1997) provides
a detailed discussion of the importance of affect
analysis in human communication and interaction.
Within this context the analysis of human affect
from text is an important topic in natural language
understanding, examples of which include senti-
ment analysis from Twitter (Nakov et al., 2016),
affect analysis from poetry (Kao and Jurafsky,

2012) and studies of correlation between function
words and social/psychological processes (Pen-
nebaker, 2011). People exchange verbal messages
which not only contain syntactic information, but
also information conveying their mental and emo-
tional states. Examples include the use of emo-
tionally colored words (such as furious and joy)
and swear words. The automated processing of
affect in human verbal communication is of great
importance to understanding spoken language sys-
tems, particularly for emerging applications such
as dialogue systems and conversational agents.

Statistical language modeling is an integral
component of speech recognition systems, with
other applications such as machine translation and
information retrieval. There has been a resur-
gence of research effort in recurrent neural net-
works for language modeling (Mikolov et al.,
2010), which have yielded performances far supe-
rior to baseline language models based on n-gram
approaches. However, there has not been much
effort in building neural language models of text
that leverage affective information. Current liter-
ature on deep learning for language understand-
ing focuses mainly on representations based on

word semantics (Mikolov et al., 2013), encoder-
decoder models for sentence representations (Cho
et al., 2015), language modeling integrated with
symbolic knowledge (Ahn et al., 2016) and neural
caption generation (Vinyals et al., 2015), but to the
best of our knowledge there has been no work on
augmenting neural language modeling with affec-
tive information, or on data-driven approaches to
generate emotional text.

Motivated by these advances in neural language
modeling and affective analysis of text, in this pa-
per we propose a model for representation and
generation of emotional text, which we call the
Affect-LM. Our model is trained on conversational
speech corpora, common in language modeling
for speech recognition applications (Bulyko et al.,
2007). Figure 1 provides an overview of our
Affect-LM and its ability to generate emotionally
colored conversational text in a number of affect
categories with varying affect strengths. While
these parameters can be manually tuned to gener-
ate conversational text, the affect category can also
be automatically inferred from preceding context
words. Specifically for model training, the affect
category is derived from features generated using
keyword spotting from a dictionary of emotional
words, such as the LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and
Word Count) tool (Pennebaker et al., 2001). Our
primary research questions in this paper are:
Q1:Can Affect-LM be used to generate affective
sentences for a target emotion with varying de-
grees of affect strength through a customizable
model parameter?
Q2:Are these generated sentences rated as emo-
tionally expressive as well as grammatically cor-
rect in an extensive crowd-sourced perception ex-
periment?
Q3:Does the automatic inference of affect cate-
gory from the context words improve language
modeling performance of the proposed Affect-LM
over the baseline as measured by perplexity?

The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows. In Section 2, we discuss prior work in the
fields of neural language modeling, and generation
of affective conversational text. In Section 3 we
describe the baseline LSTM model and our pro-
posed Affect-LM model. Section 4 details the ex-
perimental setup, and in Section 5, we discuss re-
sults for customizable emotional text generation,
perception studies for each affect category, and
perplexity improvements over the baseline model

before concluding the paper in Section 6.

2 Related Work

Language modeling is an integral component of
spoken language systems, and traditionally n-
gram approaches have been used (Stolcke et al.,
2002) with the shortcoming that they are unable to
generalize to word sequences which are not in the
training set, but are encountered in unseen data.
Bengio et al. (2003) proposed neural language
models, which address this shortcoming by gen-
eralizing through word representations. Mikolov
et al. (2010) and Sundermeyer et al. (2012) extend
neural language models to a recurrent architecture,
where a target word wt is predicted from a con-
text of all preceding words w1, w2, ..., wt−1 with
an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural net-
work. There also has been recent effort on build-
ing language models conditioned on other modali-
ties or attributes of the data. For example, Vinyals
et al. (2015) introduced the neural image caption
generator, where representations learnt from an in-
put image by a CNN (Convolutional Neural Net-
work) are fed to an LSTM language model to gen-
erate image captions. Kiros et al. (2014) used
an LBL model (Log-Bilinear language model) for
two applications - image retrieval given sentence
queries, and image captioning. Lower perplexity
was achieved on text conditioned on images rather
than language models trained only on text.

In contrast, previous literature on affective lan-
guage generation has not focused sufficiently on
customizable state-of-the-art neural network tech-
niques to generate emotional text, nor have they
quantitatively evaluated their models on multiple
emotionally colored corpora. Mahamood and Re-
iter (2011) use several NLG (natural language gen-
eration) strategies for producing affective medi-
cal reports for parents of neonatal infants under-
going healthcare. While they study the difference
between affective and non-affective reports, their
work is limited only to heuristic based systems and
do not include conversational text. Mairesse and
Walker (2007) developed PERSONAGE, a sys-
tem for dialogue generation conditioned on ex-
traversion dimensions. They trained regression
models on ground truth judge’s selections to au-
tomatically determine which of the sentences se-
lected by their model exhibit appropriate extrover-
sion attributes. In Keshtkar and Inkpen (2011), the
authors use heuristics and rule-based approaches

635



for emotional sentence generation. Their gener-
ation system is not training on large corpora and
they use additional syntactic knowledge of parts
of speech to create simple affective sentences. In
contrast, our proposed approach builds on state-of-
the-art approaches for neural language modeling,
utilizes no syntactic prior knowledge, and gener-
ates expressive emotional text.

3 Model

3.1 LSTM Language Model

Prior to providing a formulation for our pro-
posed model, we briefly describe a LSTM lan-
guage model. We have chosen this model as
a baseline since it has been reported to achieve
state-of-the-art perplexities compared to other ap-
proaches, such as n-gram models with Kneser-Ney
smoothing (Jozefowicz et al., 2016). Unlike an
ordinary recurrent neural network, an LSTM net-
work does not suffer from the vanishing gradient
problem which is more pronounced for very long
sequences (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997).
Formally, by the chain rule of probability, for a
sequence of M words w1, w2, ..., wM , the joint
probability of all words is given by:

P (w1, w2, ..., wM ) =
t=M∏

t=1

P (wt|w1, w2, ...., wt−1)

(1)
If the vocabulary consists of V words, the condi-
tional probability of word wt as a function of its
context ct−1 = (w1, w2, ...., wt−1) is given by:

P (wt = i|ct−1) =
exp(Ui

T f(ct−1) + bi)∑V
j=1 exp(Uj

T f(ct−1) + bj)
(2)

f(.) is the output of an LSTM network which
takes in the context words w1, w2, ..., wt−1 as in-
puts through one-hot representations, U is a ma-
trix of word representations which on visualiza-
tion we have found to correspond to POS (Part of
Speech) information, while bi is a bias term cap-
turing the unigram occurrence of word i. Equa-
tion 2 expresses the word wt as a function of its
context for a LSTM language model which does
not utilize any additional affective information.

3.2 Proposed Model: Affect-LM

The proposed model Affect-LM has an additional
energy term in the word prediction, and can be de-

scribed by the following equation:

P (wt = i|ct−1, et−1) =
exp (Ui

T f(ct−1) + βViTg(et−1) + bi)∑V
j=1 exp(Uj

T f(ct−1) + βVjTg(et−1) + bj)
(3)

et−1 is an input vector which consists of affect
category information obtained from the words in
the context during training, and g(.) is the output
of a network operating on et−1.Vi is an embed-
ding learnt by the model for the i-th word in the
vocabulary and is expected to be discriminative of
the affective information conveyed by each word.
In Figure 4 we present a visualization of these af-
fective representations.
The parameter β defined in Equation 3, which
we call the affect strength defines the influence
of the affect category information (frequency of
emotionally colored words) on the overall predic-
tion of the target word wt given its context. We
can consider the formulation as an energy based
model (EBM), where the additional energy term
captures the degree of correlation between the pre-
dicted word and the affective input (Bengio et al.,
2003).

3.3 Descriptors for Affect Category
Information

Our proposed model learns a generative model of
the next word wt conditioned not only on the pre-
vious words w1, w2, ..., wt−1 but also on the af-
fect category et−1 which is additional informa-
tion about emotional content. During model train-
ing, the affect category is inferred from the con-
text data itself. Thus we define a suitable feature
extractor which can utilize an affective lexicon to
infer emotion in the context. For our experiments,
we have utilized the Linguistic Inquiry and Word
Count (LIWC) text analysis program for feature
extraction through keyword spotting. Introduced
by Pennebaker et al. (2001), LIWC is based on a
dictionary, where each word is assigned to a pre-
defined LIWC category. The categories are cho-
sen based on their association with social, affec-
tive, and cognitive processes. For example, the
dictionary word worry is assigned to LIWC cat-
egory anxiety. In our work, we have utilized all
word categories of LIWC corresponding to affec-
tive processes: positive emotion, angry, sad, anx-
ious, and negative emotion. Thus the descriptor
et−1 has five features with each feature denoting

636



Corpus Name Conversations Words % Colored Words Content
Fisher 11700 21167581 3.79 Conversations
DAIC 688 677389 5.13 Conversations
SEMAINE 959 23706 6.55 Conversations
CMU-MOSI 93 26121 6.54 Monologues

Table 1: Summary of corpora used in this paper. CMU-MOSI and SEMAINE are observed to have
higher emotional content than Fisher and DAIC corpora.

presence or absence of a specific emotion, which
is obtained by binary thresholding of the features
extracted from LIWC. For example, the affective
representation of the sentence i will fight in the war
is et−1 ={“sad”:0, “angry”:1, “anxiety”:0, “neg-
ative emotion”:1, “positive emotion”:0}.

3.4 Affect-LM for Emotional Text Generation

Affect-LM can be used to generate sentences con-
ditioned on the input affect category, the affect
strength β, and the context words. For our exper-
iments, we have chosen the following affect cate-
gories - positive emotion, anger, sad, anxiety, and
negative emotion (which is a superclass of anger,
sad and anxiety). As described in Section 3.2, the
affect strength β defines the degree of dominance
of the affect-dependent energy term on the word
prediction in the language model, consequently af-
ter model training we can change β to control the
degree of how “emotionally colored” a generated
utterance is, varying from β = 0 (neutral; base-
line model) to β = ∞ (the generated sentences
only consist of emotionally colored words, with
no grammatical structure).

When Affect-LM is used for generation, the af-
fect categories could be either (1) inferred from
the context using LIWC (this occurs when we
provide sentence beginnings which are emotion-
ally colored themselves), or (2) set to an input
emotion descriptor e (this is obtained by setting
e to a binary vector encoding the desired emo-
tion and works even for neutral sentence begin-
nings). Given an initial starting set of M words
w1, w2, ..., wM to complete, affect strength β,
and the number of words N to generate each i-
th generated word is obtained by sampling from
P (wi|w1, w2, ..., wi−1, e;β) for i ∈ {M+1,M+
2, ...,M +N}.

4 Experimental Setup

In Section 1, we have introduced three primary
research questions related to the ability of the
proposed Affect-LM model to generate emotion-
ally colored conversational text without sacrific-

ing grammatical correctness, and to obtain lower
perplexity than a baseline LSTM language model
when evaluated on emotionally colored corpora.
In this section, we discuss our experimental setup
to address these questions, with a description of
Affect-LM’s architecture and the corpora used for
training and evaluating the language models.

4.1 Speech Corpora

The Fisher English Training Speech Corpus is the
main corpus used for training the proposed model,
in addition to which we have chosen three emo-
tionally colored conversational corpora. A brief
description of each corpus is given below, and in
Table 1, we report relevant statistics, such as the
total number of words, along with the fraction of
emotionally colored words (those belonging to the
LIWC affective word categories) in each corpus.
Fisher English Training Speech Parts 1 & 2:
The Fisher dataset (Cieri et al., 2004) consists of
speech from telephonic conversations of 10 min-
utes each, along with their associated transcripts.
Each conversation is between two strangers who
are requested to speak on a randomly selected
topic from a set. Examples of conversation top-
ics are Minimum Wage, Time Travel and Comedy.
Distress Assessment Interview Corpus (DAIC):
The DAIC corpus introduced by Gratch (2014)
consists of 70+ hours of dyadic interviews be-
tween a human subject and a virtual human, where
the virtual human asks questions designed to di-
agnose symptoms of psychological distress in the
subject such as depression or PTSD (Post Trau-
matic Stress Disorder).
SEMAINE dataset: SEMAINE (McKeown et al.,
2012) is a large audiovisual corpus consisting
of interactions between subjects and an operator
simulating a SAL (Sensitive Artificial Listener).
There are a total of 959 conversations which are
approximately 5 minutes each, and are transcribed
and annotated with affective dimensions.
Multimodal Opinion-level Sentiment Intensity
Dataset (CMU-MOSI): (Zadeh et al., 2016) This
is a multimodal annotated corpus of opinion

637



videos where in each video a speaker expresses
his opinion on a commercial product. The cor-
pus consist of speech from 93 videos from 89 dis-
tinct speakers (41 male and 48 female speakers).
This corpus differs from the others since it con-
tains monologues rather than conversations.

While we find that all corpora contain spoken
language, they have the following characteristics
different from the Fisher corpus: (1) More emo-
tional content as observed in Table 1, since they
have been generated through a human subject’s
spontaneous replies to questions designed to gen-
erate an emotional response, or from conversa-
tions on emotion-inducing topics (2) Domain mis-
match due to recording environment (for example,
the DAIC corpus was created in a mental health
setting, while the CMU-MOSI corpus consisted of
opinion videos uploaded online). (3) Significantly
smaller than the Fisher corpus, which is 25 times
the size of the other corpora combined. Thus, we
perform training in two separate stages - training
of the baseline and Affect-LM models on the Fisher
corpus, and subsequent adaptation and fine-tuning
on each of the emotionally colored corpora.

4.2 Affect-LM Neural Architecture
For our experiments, we have implemented
a baseline LSTM language model in Ten-
sorflow (Abadi et al., 2016), which follows
the non-regularized implementation as described
in Zaremba et al. (2014) and to which we have
added a separate energy term for the affect cate-
gory in implementing Affect-LM. We have used a
vocabulary of 10000 words and an LSTM network
with 2 hidden layers and 200 neurons per hidden
layer. The network is unrolled for 20 time steps,
and the size of each minibatch is 20. The affect
category et−1 is processed by a multi-layer per-
ceptron with a single hidden layer of 100 neurons
and sigmoid activation function to yield g(et−1).
We have set the output layer size to 200 for both
f(ct−1) and g(et−1). We have kept the network
architecture constant throughout for ease of com-
parison between the baseline and Affect-LM.

4.3 Language Modeling Experiments
Affect-LM can also be used as a language model
where the next predicted word is estimated from
the words in the context, along with an affect cate-
gory extracted from the context words themselves
(instead of being encoded externally as in gener-
ation). To evaluate whether additional emotional

information could improve the prediction perfor-
mance, we train the corpora detailed in Section 4.1
in two stages as described below:
(1) Training and validation of the language
models on Fisher dataset- The Fisher corpus is
split in a 75:15:10 ratio corresponding to the train-
ing, validation and evaluation subsets respectively,
and following the implementation in Zaremba
et al. (2014), we train the language models (both
the baseline and Affect-LM) on the training split
for 13 epochs, with a learning rate of 1.0 for the
first four epochs, and the rate decreasing by a fac-
tor of 2 after every subsequent epoch. The learn-
ing rate and neural architecture are the same for
all models. We validate the model over the affect
strength β ∈ [1.0, 1.5, 1.75, 2.0, 2.25, 2.5, 3.0].
The best performing model on the Fisher valida-
tion set is chosen and used as a seed for subsequent
adaptation on the emotionally colored corpora.
(2) Fine-tuning the seed model on other cor-
pora- Each of the three corpora - CMU-MOSI,
DAIC and SEMAINE are split in a 75:15:10 ratio
to create individual training, validation and eval-
uation subsets. For both the baseline and Affect-
LM, the best performing model from Stage 1 (the
seed model) is fine-tuned on each of the train-
ing corpora, with a learning rate of 0.25 which
is constant throughout, and a validation grid of
β ∈ [1.0, 1.5, 1.75, 2.0]. For each model adapted
on a corpus, we compare the perplexities obtained
by Affect-LM and the baseline model when evalu-
ated on that corpus.

4.4 Sentence Generation Perception Study

We assess Affect-LM’s ability to generate emo-
tionally colored text of varying degrees without
severely deteriorating grammatical correctness, by
conducting an extensive perception study on Ama-
zon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) platform. The
MTurk platform has been successfully used in
the past for a wide range of perception experi-
ments and has been shown to be an excellent re-
source to collect human ratings for large stud-
ies (Buhrmester et al., 2011). Specifically, we
generated more than 200 sentences for four sen-
tence beginnings (namely the three sentence be-
ginnings listed in Table 2 as well as an end of
sentence token indicating that the model should
generate a new sentence) in five affect categories
happy(positive emotion), angry, sad, anxiety, and
negative emotion. The Affect-LM model trained

638



Beginning Affect Category Completed sentence
I feel so Happy good because i think that it’s important to have a relationship with a friend

Angry bad that i hate it and i hate that because they they kill themselves and then they fight
Sad sad to miss because i i miss the feelings of family members who i lost feelings with
Anxious horrible i mean i think when we’re going to you know war and alert alert and we’re actually gonna die
Neutral bad if i didn’t know that the decision was going on

I told him to Happy be honest and i said well i hope that i ’m going to be a better person
Angry see why he was fighting with my son
Sad leave the house because i hurt one and i lost his leg and hurt him
Anxious be afraid of him and he he just he just didn’t care about the death penalty
Neutral do this position i think he is he’s got a lot of money he has to pay himself a lot of money

Why did you Happy have a best friend
Angry say it was only a criminal being killed at a war or something
Sad miss your feelings
Anxious worry about fear factor
Neutral believe in divorce

Table 2: Example sentences generated by the model conditioned on different affect categories

on the Fisher corpus was used for sentence gen-
eration. Each sentence was evaluated by two hu-
man raters that have a minimum approval rating
of 98% and are located in the United States. The
human raters were instructed that the sentences
should be considered to be taken from a conver-
sational rather than a written context: repetitions
and pause fillers (e.g., um, uh) are common and
no punctuation is provided. The human raters
evaluated each sentence on a seven-point Likert
scale for the five affect categories, overall affec-
tive valence as well as the sentence’s grammati-
cal correctness and were paid 0.05USD per sen-
tence. We measured inter-rater agreement using
Krippendorffs α and observed considerable agree-
ment between raters across all categories (e.g., for
valence α = 0.510 and grammatical correctness
α = 0.505).

For each target emotion (i.e., intended emo-
tion of generated sentences) we conducted an ini-
tial MANOVA, with human ratings of affect cat-
egories the DVs (dependent variables) and the
affect strength parameter β the IV (independent
variable). We then conducted follow-up univariate
ANOVAs to identify which DV changes signifi-
cantly with β. In total we conducted 5 MANOVAs
and 30 follow-up ANOVAs, which required us to
update the significance level to p<0.001 following
a Bonferroni correction.

5 Results

5.1 Generation of Emotional Text

In Section 3.4 we have described the process of
sampling text from the model conditioned on in-
put affective information (research question Q1).
Table 2 shows three sentences generated by the
model for input sentence beginnings I feel so ...,
Why did you ... and I told him to ... for each of five

affect categories - happy(positive emotion), angry,
sad anxiety, and neutral(no emotion). They have
been selected from a pool of 20 generated sen-
tences for each category and sentence beginning.

5.2 MTurk Perception Experiments

In the following we address research question Q2
by reporting the main statistical findings of our
MTurk study, which are visualized in Figures 2
and 3.

Positive Emotion Sentences. The multi-
variate result was significant for positive emo-
tion generated sentences (Pillai’s Trace=.327,
F(4,437)=6.44, p<.0001). Follow up ANOVAs
revealed significant results for all DVs except an-
gry with p<.0001, indicating that both affective
valence and happy DVs were successfully manip-
ulated with β, as seen in Figure 2(a). Grammat-
ical correctness was also significantly influenced
by the affect strength parameter β and results show
that the correctness deteriorates with increasing β
(see Figure 3). However, a post-hoc Tukey test
revealed that only the highest β value shows a sig-
nificant drop in grammatical correctness at p<.05.

Negative Emotion Sentences. The multi-
variate result was significant for negative emo-
tion generated sentences (Pillai’s Trace=.130,
F(4,413)=2.30, p<.0005). Follow up ANOVAs
revealed significant results for affective valence
and happy DVs with p<.0005, indicating that the
affective valence DV was successfully manipu-
lated with β, as seen in Figure 2(b). Further,
as intended there were no significant differences
for DVs angry, sad and anxious, indicating that
the negative emotion DV refers to a more gen-
eral affect related concept rather than a specific
negative emotion. This finding is in concordance
with the intended LIWC category of negative af-
fect that forms a parent category above the more

specific emotions, such as angry, sad, and anxious
(Pennebaker et al., 2001). Grammatical correct-
ness was also significantly influenced by the affect
strength β and results show that the correctness de-
teriorates with increasing β (see Figure 3). As for
positive emotion, a post-hoc Tukey test revealed
that only the highest β value shows a significant
drop in grammatical correctness at p<.05.
Angry Sentences. The multivariate result was
significant for angry generated sentences (Pillai’s
Trace=.199, F(4,433)=3.76, p<.0001). Follow
up ANOVAs revealed significant results for affec-
tive valence, happy, and angry DVs with p<.0001,
indicating that both affective valence and angry
DVs were successfully manipulated with β, as
seen in Figure 2(c). Grammatical correctness was
not significantly influenced by the affect strength
parameter β, which indicates that angry sentences
are highly stable across a wide range of β (see Fig-
ure 3). However, it seems that human raters could
not successfully distinguish between angry, sad,
and anxious affect categories, indicating that the
generated sentences likely follow a general nega-
tive affect dimension.

Sad Sentences. The multivariate result was
significant for sad generated sentences (Pillai’s
Trace=.377, F(4,425)=7.33, p<.0001). Follow
up ANOVAs revealed significant results only for
the sad DV with p<.0001, indicating that while
the sad DV can be successfully manipulated with
β, as seen in Figure 2(d). The grammatical cor-
rectness deteriorates significantly with β. Specifi-
cally, a post-hoc Tukey test revealed that only the
two highest β values show a significant drop in
grammatical correctness at p<.05 (see Figure 3).

Figure 3: Mechanical Turk study results for
grammatical correctness for all generated target
emotions. Perceived grammatical correctness for

each affect categories are color-coded.

A post-hoc Tukey test for sad reveals that β = 3 is
optimal for this DV, since it leads to a significant
jump in the perceived sadness scores at p<.005 for
β ∈ {0, 1, 2}.

Anxious Sentences. The multivariate result
was significant for anxious generated sentences
(Pillai’s Trace=.289, F(4,421)=6.44, p<.0001).
Follow up ANOVAs revealed significant results
for affective valence, happy and anxious DVs with
p<.0001, indicating that both affective valence
and anxiety DVs were successfully manipulated
with β, as seen in Figure 2(e). Grammatical
correctness was also significantly influenced by
the affect strength parameter β and results show
that the correctness deteriorates with increasing β.
Similarly for sad, a post-hoc Tukey test revealed
that only the two highest β values show a signif-
icant drop in grammatical correctness at p<.05
(see Figure 3). Again, a post-hoc Tukey test for
anxious reveals that β = 3 is optimal for this DV,
since it leads to a significant jump in the perceived

5.3 Language Modeling Results

In Table 3, we address research question Q3 by
presenting the perplexity scores obtained by the
baseline model and Affect-LM, when trained on the
Fisher corpus and subsequently adapted on three
emotional corpora (each adapted model is indi-
vidually trained on CMU-MOSI, DAIC and SE-
MAINE). The models trained on Fisher are eval-
uated on all corpora while each adapted model is
evaluated only on it’s respective corpus. For all
corpora, we find that Affect-LM achieves lower
perplexity on average than the baseline model, im-
plying that affect category information obtained
from the context words improves language model
prediction. The average perplexity improvement is
1.44 (relative improvement 1.94%) for the model
trained on Fisher, while it is 0.79 (1.31%) for the
adapted models. We note that larger improve-
ments in perplexity are observed for corpora with
higher content of emotional words. This is sup-
ported by the results in Table 3, where Affect-
LM obtains a larger reduction in perplexity for the
CMU-MOSI and SEMAINE corpora, which re-
spectively consist of 2.76% and 2.75% more emo-
tional words than the Fisher corpus.

5.4 Word Representations

In Equation 3, Affect-LM learns a weight ma-
trix V which captures the correlation between the
predicted word wt, and the affect category et−1.
Thus, each row of the matrix Vi is an emotion-
ally meaningful embedding of the i-th word in the
vocabulary. In Figure 4, we present a t-SNE vi-
sualization of these embeddings, where each data
point is a separate word, and words which ap-
pear in the LIWC dictionary are colored based on
which affect category they belong to (we have la-
beled only words in categories positive emotion,
negative emotion, anger, sad and anxiety since

Figure 4: Embeddings learnt by Affect-LM

these categories contain the most frequent words).
Words colored grey are those not in the LIWC
dictionary. In Figure 4, we observe that the em-
beddings contain affective information, where the
positive emotion is highly separated from the neg-
ative emotions (sad, angry, anxiety) which are
clustered together.
6 Conclusions and Future Work
In this paper, we have introduced a novel language
model Affect-LM for generating affective conver-
sational text conditioned on context words, an af-
fective category and an affective strength parame-
ter. MTurk perception studies show that the model
can generate expressive text at varying degrees of
emotional strength without affecting grammatical
correctness. We also evaluate Affect-LM as a lan-
guage model and show that it achieves lower per-
plexity than a baseline LSTM model when the af-
fect category is obtained from the words in the
context. For future work, we wish to extend this
model by investigating language generation con-
ditioned on other modalities such as facial images
and speech, and to applications such as dialogue
generation for virtual agents.
