Abstract

Generating diverse sequences is important
in many NLP applications such as question
generation or summarization that exhibit se-
mantically one-to-many relationships between
source and the target sequences. We present
a method to explicitly separate diversification
from generation using a general plug-and-play
module (called SELECTOR) that wraps around
and guides an existing encoder-decoder model.
The diversification stage uses a mixture of
experts to sample different binary masks on
the source sequence for diverse content se-
lection. The generation stage uses a stan-
dard encoder-decoder model given each se-
lected content from the source sequence. Due
to the non-differentiable nature of discrete
sampling and the lack of ground truth la-
bels for binary mask, we leverage a proxy
for ground-truth mask and adopt stochastic
hard-EM for training. In question genera-
tion (SQuAD) and abstractive summarization
(CNN-DM), our method demonstrates signifi-
cant improvements in accuracy, diversity and
training efficiency, including state-of-the-art
top-1 accuracy in both datasets, 6% gain in
top-5 accuracy, and 3.7 times faster training
over a state-of-the-art model. Our code is pub-
licly available at https://github.com/

1 Introduction

Generating target sequences given a source se-
quence has applications in a wide range of prob-
lems in NLP with different types of relationships
between the source and target sequences. For in-
stance, paraphrasing or machine translation ex-
hibit a one-to-one relationship because the source
and the target should carry the same meaning. On
the other hand, summarization or question gen-
eration exhibit one-to-many relationships because

Our method generates diverse questions, by selecting
different tokens to focus (colored) in contrast to 3-
mixture decoder (Shen et al., 2019) that generates 3
identical questions: “what did tesla do to hide the fact
that he dropped out of school?”.

a single source often results in diverse target se-
quences with different semantics. Fig. 1 shows
different questions that can be generated from a
given passage.

Encoder-decoder models (Cho et al., 2014) are
widely used for sequence generation, most no-
tably in machine translation where neural models
are now often almost as good as human transla-
tors in some language pairs. However, a stan-
dard encoder-decoder often shows a poor perfor-
mance when it attempts to produce multiple, di-
verse outputs. Most recent methods for diverse se-
quence generation leverage diversifying decoding
steps through alternative search algorithms (Fan
et al., 2018; Vijayakumar et al., 2018) or mixture
of decoders (He et al., 2018; Shen et al., 2019).
These methods promote diversity at the decoding

step, while a more focused selection of the source
sequence can lead to diversifying the semantics of
the generated target sequences.

In this paper, we present a method for diverse
generation that separates diversification and gen-
eration stages. The diversification stage leverages
content selection to map the source to multiple
sequences, where each mapping is modeled by
focusing on different tokens in the source (one-
to-many mapping). The generation stage uses
a standard encoder-decoder model to generate a
target sequence given each selected content from
the source (one-to-one mapping). We present a
generic module called SELECTOR that is special-
ized for diversification. This module can be used
as a plug-and-play to an arbitrary encoder-decoder
model for generation without architecture change.

The SELECTOR module leverages a mixture of
experts (Jacobs et al., 1991; Eigen et al., 2014) to
identify diverse key contents to focus on during
generation. Each mixture samples a sequential la-
tent variable modeled as a binary mask on every
source sequence token. Then an encoder-decoder
model generates multiple target sequences given
these binary masks along with the original source
tokens. Due to the non-differentiable nature of
discrete sampling, we adopt stochastic hard-EM
for training SELECTOR. To mitigate the lack of
ground truth annotation for the mask (content se-
lection), we use the overlap between the source
and target sequences as a simple proxy for the
ground-truth mask.

We experiment on question generation and ab-
stractive summarization tasks and show that our
method achieves the best trade-off between ac-
curacy and diversity over previous models on
SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) and CNN-DM
(Hermann et al., 2015; Nallapati et al., 2016; See
et al., 2017) datasets. In particular, compared
to the recently-introduced mixture decoder (Shen
et al., 2019) that also aims to diversify outputs by
creating multiple decoders, our modular method
not only demonstrates better accuracy and diver-
sity, but also trains 3.7 times faster.

2 Related Work

Diverse Search Algorithms Beam search, the
most commonly used search algorithm for decod-
ing, is known to produce samples that are short,
contain repetitive phrases, and share majority of
their tokens. Hence several methods are intro-

duced to diversify search algorithms for decoding.
Graves (2013); Chorowski and Jaitly (2017) tune
temperature hyperparameter in softmax function.
Vijayakumar et al. (2018); Li et al. (2016b) pe-
nalize similar samples during beam search in or-
der to obtain diverse set of samples. Cho (2016)
adds random noise to RNN decoder hidden states.
Fan et al. (2018) sample tokens from top-k to-
kens at each decoding step. Our method is or-
thogonal to these search-based strategies, in that
they diversify decoding while our method diversi-
fies which content to be focused during encoding.
Moreover, our empirical results show diversifica-
tion with stochastic sampling hurts accuracy sig-
nificantly.

Deep Mixture of Experts Several methods
adopt a deep mixture of experts (MoE) (Jacobs
et al., 1991; Eigen et al., 2014) to diversify de-
coding steps. Yang et al. (2018) introduce soft
mixture of softmax on top of the output layer of
RNN language model. He et al. (2018); Shen
et al. (2019) introduce mixture of decoders with
uniform mixing coefficient to improve diversity in
machine translation. Among these, the closest to
ours is the mixture decoder (Shen et al., 2019)
that also adopts hard-EM for training, where a
minimum-loss predictor is assigned to each data
point, which is also known as multiple choice
learning (Guzman-Rivera et al., 2012; Lee et al.,
2016). While Shen et al. (2019) makes RNN de-
coder as a MoE, we make SELECTOR as a MoE
to diversify content selection and let the encoder-
decoder models one-to-one generation. As shown
in our empirical results, our method achieves a
better accuracy-diversity trade-off while reducing
training time significantly.

Variational Autoencoders Variational Autoen-
coders (VAE) (Kingma and Welling, 2013) are
used for diverse generation in several tasks, such
as language modeling (Bowman et al., 2016), ma-
chine translation (Zhang et al., 2016; Su et al.,
2018; Deng et al., 2018; Shankar and Sarawagi,
2019), and conversation modeling (Serban et al.,
2017; Wen et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2017; Park
et al., 2018; Wen and Luong, 2018; Gu et al.,
2019). These methods sample diverse latent vari-
ables from an approximate posterior distribution,
but often suffer from a posterior collapse where
the sampled latent variables are ignored (Bowman
et al., 2016; Park et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2018b;

Dieng et al., 2018; Xu and Durrett, 2018; He et al.,
2019; Razavi et al., 2019). This is also observed
in our initial experiments and Shen et al. (2019),
where MoE-based methods significantly outper-
forms VAE-based methods because of the poste-
rior collapse. Moreover, we observe that sampling
mixtures makes training more stable compared to
stochastic sampling of latent variables. Further-
more, our latent structure as a sequence of binary
variables is different from most VAEs which use a
fixed-size continuous latent variable. This gives a
finer-grained control and interpretability on where
to focus, especially when source sequence is long.

Diversity-Promoting Regularization Adding
regularization to objective functions is used to
diversify generation. Li et al. (2016a) introduce
a term maximizing mutual information between
source and target sentences. Chorowski and
Jaitly (2017); Kalyan et al. (2018) introduce
terms enforcing knowledge transfer among
similar annotations. Our work is orthogonal to
these methods and can potentially benefit from
adding these regularization terms to our objective
function.

Content Selection in NLP Selecting important
parts of the context has been an important step in
NLP applications (Reiter and Dale, 2000). Most
recently, Ke et al. (2018); Min et al. (2018) con-
duct soft-/ hard-selection of key parts from source
passages for question answering. Zhou et al.
(2017b) use soft gating on the source document
encoder for abstractive summarization. Li et al.

(2018) guide abstractive summarization models
with off-the-shelf keyword extractors. The most
relevant work to ours are Subramanian et al.
(2018) and Gehrmann et al. (2018). Subramanian
et al. (2018) use a pointer network (Vinyals et al.,
2015) for extracting key phrases for question gen-
eration and Gehrmann et al. (2018) use content se-
lector to limit copying probability for abstractive
summarization. The main purpose of these ap-
proaches is to enhance accuracy, while our method
uses diverse content selection to enhance both ac-
curacy and diversity (refer to our empirical re-
sults). Additionally, our method allows models to
learn how to utilize information from the selected
content, whereas Gehrmann et al. (2018) manually
limit the copying mechanism on non-selected con-
tents.

3 Method

In this paper, we focus on sequence generation
tasks such as question generation and summariza-
tion that have one-to-many relationship. More for-
mally, given a source sequence x = (x1 . . . xS) ∈
X , our goal is to model a conditional multimodal
distribution for the target sequence p(y|x) that as-
signs high values on p(y1|x) . . . p(yK |x) for K
valid mappings x → y1 . . . x → yK . For in-
stance, Fig. 1 illustrates K = 3 different valid
questions generated for a given passage.

For learning a multimodal distribution, it is not
appropriate to use a generic encoder-decoder (Cho
et al., 2014) that minimizes for the expected value
of the log probability of all the valid mappings.



3124

This can lead to a suboptimal mapping that is in
the middle of the targets but not near any of them.
As a solution, we propose to (1) introduce a la-
tent variable called focus that factorizes the distri-
bution into two stages, select and generate (Sec-
tion 3.1), and (2) independently train the factor-
ized distributions (Section 3.2).

3.1 Select and Generate

In order to factorize the multimodal distribution
into the two stages (select and generate), we intro-
duce a latent variable called focus. The intuition
is that in the select stage we sample several mean-
ingful focus, each of which indicates which part
of the source sequence should be considered im-
portant. Then in the generate stage, each sampled
focus biases the generation process towards being
conditioned on the focused content.

Formally, we model focus with a sequence of
binary variable, each of which corresponds to
each token in the input sequence, i.e. m =
{m1 . . .mS} ∈ {0, 1}S . The intuition is that
mt = 1 indicates t-th source token xt should be
focused during sequence generation. For instance,
in Fig. 1, colored tokens (green, red, or blue) show
that different tokens are focused (i.e. values are 1)
for different focus samples (out of 3). We first use
the latent variable m to factorize p(y|x),

p(y|x) = Em∼pφ(m|x)[pθ(y|m,x)] (1)

where pφ(m|x) is selector and pθ(y|x,m) is gen-
erator. The factorization separates focus selection
from generation so that modeling multimodality
(diverse outputs) can be solely handled in the se-
lect stage and generate stage can solely concen-
trate on the generation task itself. We now de-
scribe each component in more details.

Selector In order to directly control the diver-
sity of the SELECTOR’s outputs, we model it as a
hard mixture of experts (hard-MoE) (Jacobs et al.,
1991; Eigen et al., 2014), where each expert spe-
cializes in focusing on different parts of the source
sequences. In Fig. 1 and 2, focus produced by
each SELECTOR expert is colored differently. We
introduce a multinomial latent variable z ∈ Z,
where Z = {1 . . .K}, and let each focus m be
assigned to one of K experts with uniform prior
p(z|x) = 1K . With this mixture setting, p(m|x) is

recovered as follows.

p(m|x) = Ez∼p(z|x)[pφ(m|x, z)]

(2)

We model SELECTOR with a single-layer Bi-
directional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) (Cho
et al., 2014) followed by two fully-connected lay-
ers and a Sigmoid activation. We feed (current
hidden state ht, first and last hidden state h1,hS ,
and expert embedding ez) to a fully-connected
layers (FC). Expert embedding ez is unique for
each expert and is trained from a random initial-
ization. From our initial experiments, we found
this parallel focus inference to be more effective
than auto-regressive pointing mechanism (Vinyals
et al., 2015; Subramanian et al., 2018). The distri-
bution of the focus conditioned on the input x and
the expert id z is the Bernoulli distribution of the
resulting values,

(h1 . . .hS) = Bi-GRU(x)

ozt = σ(FC([ht;h1;hS ; ez]))

pφ(mt|x, z) = Bernoulli(ozt )
(3)

To prevent low quality experts from dying dur-
ing training, we let experts share all parameters,
except for the individual expert embedding ez . We
also reuse the word embedding of the generator in
the word embedding of SELECTOR to promote co-
operative knowledge sharing between SELECTOR
and generator. With these parameter sharing tech-
niques, adding a mixture of SELECTOR experts in-
creases only a slight amount of parameters (GRU,
FC, and ez) to sequence-to-sequence models.

Generator For maximum diversity, we sample
one focus from each SELECTOR expert to approx-
imate pφ(m|x). For a deterministic behavior, we
threshold ozt with a hyperparameter th instead of
sampling from the Bernoulli distribution. This
gives us a list of focus m1 . . .mK coming from
K experts. Each focus mz = (mz1 . . .m

z
S) is en-

coded as embeddings and concatenated with the
input embeddings of the source sequence x =
(x1 . . . xS). An off-the-shelf generation function
such as encoder-decoder can be used for modeling
p(y|m,x), as long as it accepts a stream of input
embeddings. We use an identical generation func-
tion with K different focus samples to produce K
different diverse outputs.

3.2 Training

Marginalizing the Bernoulli distribution in Eq. 3
by enumerating all possible focus is intractable
since the cardinality of focus space 2S grows ex-
ponentially with source sequence length S. Pol-
icy gradient (Williams, 1992; Yu et al., 2017)
or Gumbel-softmax (Jang et al., 2017; Maddison
et al., 2017) are often used to propagate gradients
through a stochastic process, but we empirically
found that these do not work well. We instead cre-
ate focus guide and use it to independently and di-
rectly train the SELECTOR and the generator. For-
mally, a focus guide mguide = (mguide1 . . .m

guide
S )

is a simple proxy of whether a source token is fo-
cused during generation. We set t-th focus guide
m

guide
t to 1 if t-th source token xt is focused in

target sequence y and 0 otherwise. During train-
ing, mguide acts as a target for SELECTOR and is
a given input for generator (teacher forcing). Dur-
ing inference, m̂ is sampled from SELECTOR and
fed to the generator.

In question generation, we set mguidet to 1 if
there is a target question token which shares the
same word stem with passage token xt. Then we
set mguidet to 0 if xt is a stop word or is inside
the answer phrase. In abstractive summarization,
we generate focus guide using copy target gener-
ation by Gehrmann et al. (2018), where they set
source document token xt is copied if it is part
of the longest possible subsequence that overlaps
with the target summary.

Alg. 1 describes the overall training process,
which first uses stochastic hard-EM (Neal and

Hinton, 1998; Lee et al., 2016) for training the SE-
LECTOR and then the canonical MLE for training
the generator.

E-step (line 2-5 in Alg. 1) we sample fo-
cus from all experts and compute their losses
− log pφ(mguide|x, z). Then we choose an expert
zbest with minimum loss.

zbest = argmin
z
− log pφ(mguide|x, z) (4)

M-step (line 6 in Alg. 1) we only update the
parameters of the chosen expert zbest.

Training Generator (line 7-8 in Alg. 1)
The generator is independently trained using
conventional teacher forcing, which minimizes
− log pθ(y|x,mguide).

4 Experimental Setup

We describe our experimental setup for question
generation (Section 4.1) and abstractive summa-
rization (Section 4.2). For both tasks, we use an
off-the-shelf, task-specific encoder-decoder-based
model for the generator and show how adding SE-
LECTOR can help to diversify the output of an ar-
bitrary generator. To evaluate the contribution of
SELECTOR we additionally compare our method
with previous diversity-promoting methods as the
baseline (Section 4.3).

4.1 Question Generation
Question generation is the task of generating a
question from a passage-answer pair. Answers are
given as a span in the passage (See Fig.1).

Dataset We conduct experiments on SQuAD
(Rajpurkar et al., 2016) and use the same dataset
split of Zhou et al. (2017a), resulting in 86,635,
8,965, and 8,964 source-target pairs for training,
validation, and test, respectively. Both source pas-
sages and target questions are single sentences.
The average length of source passage and target
question are 32 and 11 tokens.

Generator We use NQG++ (Zhou et al., 2017a)
as the generator, which is an RNN-based encoder-
decoder architecture with copying mechanism
(Gulcehre et al., 2016).

4.2 Abstractive Summarization
Abstractive summarization is the task of generat-
ing a summary sentence from a source document
that consists of multiple sentences.



3126

Dataset We conduct experiments on the non-
anonymized version of CNN-DM dataset (Her-
mann et al., 2015; Nallapati et al., 2016; See et al.,
2017), whose training, validation, test splits have
size of 287,113, 13,368, and 11,490 source-target
pairs, respectively. The average length of the
source documents and target summaries are 386
and 55 tokens. Following See et al. (2017), we
truncate source and target sentences to 400 and
100 tokens during training.

Generator We use Pointer Generator (PG) (See
et al., 2017) as the generator for summarization,
which also leverages RNN-based encoder-decoder
architecture and copying mechanism, and uses
coverage loss to avoid repetitive phrases.

4.3 Baselines

For each task, we compare our method with other
techniques which promote diversity at the decod-
ing step. In particular, we compare with recent di-
verse search algorithms including Truncated Sam-
pling (Fan et al., 2018), Diverse Beam Search
(Vijayakumar et al., 2018), and Mixture Decoder
(Shen et al., 2019). We implement these meth-
ods with NQG++ and PG. For each method, we
generate K = (3 and 5) hypotheses from each
source sequence. For search-based baselines (Fan
et al., 2018; Vijayakumar et al., 2018), we select
the top-k candidates after generation. For mix-
ture models (Shen et al. (2019) and ours), we con-
duct greedy decoding from each mixture for fair
comparison with search-based methods in terms of
speed/memory usage.

Beam Search This baseline keeps K hypotheses
with highest log-probability scores at each decod-
ing step.

Diverse Beam Search This baseline adds a di-
versity promoting term to log-probability when
scoring hypotheses in beam search, Following Vi-
jayakumar et al. (2018), we use hamming diversity
and diversity strength λ = 0.5.

Truncated Sampling This baseline randomly
samples words from top-10 candidates of the dis-
tribution at the decoding step (Fan et al., 2018).

Mixture Decoder This baseline constructs a hard-
MoE of K decoders with uniform mixing coeffi-
cient (referred as hMup in Shen et al. (2019)) and
conducts parallel greedy decoding. All decoders
share all parameters but use different embeddings
for start-of-sequence token.

Mixture Selector (Ours) We construct a hard-
MoE of K SELECTORs with uniform mixing co-
efficient that infers K different focus from source
sequence. Guided by K focus, generator conducts
parallel greedy decoding.

4.4 Metrics: Accuracy and Diversity

We use metrics introduced by previous works
(Ott et al., 2018; Vijayakumar et al., 2018; Zhu
et al., 2018) to evaluate the diversity promoting
approaches. These metrics are extensions over
BLEU-4 (Papineni et al., 2002) and ROUGE-2 F1-
score (Lin, 2004) and aim to evaluate the trade-off
between accuracy and diversity.

Top-1 metric (⇑) This measures the Top-1 accu-
racy among the generated K-best hypotheses. The
accuracy is measured using a corpus-level metric,
i.e., BLEU-4 or ROUGE-2.

Oracle metric (⇑) This measures the quality of
the target distribution coverage among the Top-K
generated target sequences (Ott et al., 2018; Vi-
jayakumar et al., 2018). Given an optimal ranking
method (oracle), this metric measures the upper
bound of Top-1 accuracy by comparing the best
hypothesis with the target. Concretely, we gen-
erate hypotheses {ŷ1 . . . ŷK} from each source
x and keep the hypothesis ŷbest that achieves
the best sentence-level metric with the target y.
Then we calculate a corpus-level metric with the
greedily-selected hypotheses {ŷ(i),best}Ni=1 and
references {y(i)}Ni=1.

Pairwise metric (⇓) Referred as self- (Zhu
et al., 2018) or pairwise- (Ott et al., 2018) met-
ric, this measures the within-distribution similar-
ity. This metric computes the average of sentence-
level metrics between all pairwise combinations
of hypotheses {ŷ1 . . . ŷK} generated from each
source sequence x. Low pairwise metric indicates
high diversity between generated hypotheses.

4.5 Human Evaluation Setup

We ask Amazon Mechanical Turkers (AMT) to
compare our method with the baselines. For each
method, we generate three questions / summaries
from 100 passages sampled from SQuAD / CNN-
DM test set. For every pair of methods, annota-
tors are instructed to pick a set of questions / sum-
maries that are more diverse. To evaluate accu-
racy, they see one question / summary selected



3127

out of 3 questions / summaries with highest log-
probability from each method. They are instructed
to select a question / summary that is more coher-
ent with the source passage / document. Each an-
notator is asked to choose either a better method
(resulting in “win” or “lose”) or “tie” if their qual-
ity is indistinguishable. Diversity and accuracy
evaluations are conducted separately, and every
pair of methods are presented to 10 annotators1.

4.6 Implementation details
For all experiments, we tie the weights (Press and
Wolf, 2017) of the encoder embedding, the de-
coder embedding, and the decoder output layers.
This significantly reduces the number of parame-
ters and training time until convergence. We train
up to 20 epochs and select the checkpoint with the
best oracle metric. We use Adam (Kingma and
Ba, 2015) optimizer with learning rate 0.001 and
momentum parmeters β1 = 0.9 and β2 = 0.999.
Minibatch size is 64 and 32 for question gener-
ation and abstractive summarization. All models
are implemented in PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2017)
and trained on single Tesla P40 GPU, based on
NAVER Smart Machine Learning (NSML) plat-
form (Kim et al., 2018a).

Question Generation Following Zhou et al.
(2017a), we use 256-dim hidden states for each di-
rection of Bi-GRU encoder, 512-dim hidden states
for GRU decoder, 300-dim word embedding ini-
tialized from GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014),
vocabulary of 20,000 most frequent words, 16-
dim embeddings for three linguistic features (POS,
NER and word case) respectively.

Abstractive Summarization Following See
et al. (2017), we use 256-dim hidden states for
each direction of Bi-LSTM encoder and LSTM
decoder, 128-dim word embedding trained from
scratch, and vocabulary of 50,000 most frequent
words. Following See et al. (2017), we train
our model to generate concatenation of target
summaries and split it with periods.

SELECTOR The GRU has the same size as the
generator encoder, and the dimension of expert
embedding ez is 300 for NQG++, and 128 for PG.
From simple grid search over [0.1, 0.5], we obtain
focus binarization threshold th 0.15. The size of
focus embedding for the generator is 16.

1We conducted 12 human evaluations in total: 2 tasks x 3
baselines x 2 criteria. See Table 3a and 3b.

5 Results

Diversity vs. Accuracy Trade-off Tables 1 and
2 compare our method with different diversity-
promoting techniques in question generation and
abstractive summarization. The tables show that
our mixture SELECTOR method outperforms all
baselines in Top-1 and oracle metrics and achieves
the best trade-off between diversity and accuracy.
Moreover, both mixture models are superior to all
search-based methods in the trade-off between di-
versity and accuracy. Standard and diverse beam
search methods score low both in terms of ac-
curacy and diversity. Truncated sampling shows
the lowest self-similarity (high diversity), but it
achieves the lowest score on Top-1 accuracy. No-
tably, our method scores state-of-the-art BLEU-4
in question generation on SQuAD and ROUGE
comparable to state-of-the-art methods in abstrac-
tive summarization in CNN-DM (See also Table 4
for state-of-the-art results in CNN-DM).

Diversity vs. Number of Mixtures Here we
compare the effect of number of mixtures in our
SELECTOR and Mixture Decoder (Shen et al.,
2019). Tables 1 and 2 show that pairwise simi-
larity increases (diversity ⇓) when the number of
mixtures increases for Mixture Decoder. While we
observe a similar trend for SELECTOR in the ques-
tion generation task, Table 2 shows the opposite

effect in the summarization task i.e., pairwise sim-
ilarity decreases (diversity ⇑) for SELECTOR.

The abstractive summarization task on CNN-
DM has a target distribution with more modal-
ities than question generation task on SQuAD,
which is more difficult to model. We speculate that
our SELECTOR improves accuracy by focusing on
more modes of the output distribution (diversity
⇑), whereas Mixture Decoder tries to improve the
accuracy by concentrating on fewer modalities of
the output distribution (diversity ⇓).

Upper Bound Performance The bottom rows
of Tables 1 and 2 show the upper bound perfor-
mance of SELECTOR by feeding focus guide to
generator during test time. In particular, we as-
sume that the mask is the ground truth overlap be-
tween input and target sequences at test time. The
gap between the oracle metric (top-k accuracy)
and the upper bound is very small for question
generation. This indicates that the top-k masks for
question generation include the ground truth mask.
Future work involves improving the content selec-
tion stage for the summarization task.

human evaluation in two tasks of questions gen-
eration and summarization, comparing sequences
generated by SELECTOR with the diversity-

Comparison with State-of-the-art Table 4
compares the performance of SELECTOR with
the state-of-the-art bottom-up content selection
of Gehrmann et al. (2018) in abstractive summa-
rization. SELECTOR passes focus embeddings at
the decoding step, whereas the bottom-up selec-
tion method only uses the masked words for the
copy mechanism. We set K, the number of mix-
tures of SELECTOR, to 1 to directly compare it
with the previous work (Bottom-Up (Gehrmann
et al., 2018)). We observe that SELECTOR not
only outperforms Bottom-Up in every metric, but
also achieves a new state-of-the-art ROUGE-1 and
ROUGE-L on CNN-DM. Moreover, our method
scores state-of-the-art BLEU-4 in question gener-
ation on SQuAD (Table 1).

Efficient Training Table 5 shows that SELEC-
TOR trains up to 3.7 times faster than mixture de-
coder (Shen et al., 2019). Training time of mixture
decoder linearly increases with the number of de-
coders, while parallel focus inference of SELEC-
TOR makes additional training time negligible.

Qualitative Analysis To analyze how the gen-
erator uses the selected content, we visualize at-
tention heatmap of NQG++ in Fig.3 for question
generation. The figure shows different attention

6 Conclusion

We introduce a novel diverse sequence generation
method via proposing a content selection module,
SELECTOR. Built upon mixture of experts and
hard-EM training, SELECTOR identifies different
key parts on source sequence to guide generator to
output a diverse set of sequences.

SELECTOR is a generic plug-and-play module
that can be added to an existing encoder-decoder
model to enforce diversity with a negligible addi-
tional computational cost. We empirically demon-
strate that our method improves both accuracy
and diversity and reduces training time signifi-
cantly compared to baselines in question genera-
tion and abstractive summarization. Future work
involves incorporating SELECTOR for other gen-
eration tasks such as diverse image captioning.
