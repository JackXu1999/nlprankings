Abstract

Restrictive and repetitive behavior (RRB) is
a core symptom of autism spectrum disorder
(ASD) and are manifest in language. Based
on this, we expect children with autism to talk
about fewer topics, and more repeatedly, dur-
ing their conversations. We thus hypothesize
a higher semantic overlap ratio between dia-
logue turns in children with ASD compared to
those with typical development (TD). Partic-
ipants of this study include children ages 4-
8, 44 with TD and 25 with ASD without lan-
guage impairment. We apply several seman-
tic similarity metrics to the children’s dialogue
turns in semi-structured conversations with
examiners. We find that children with ASD
have significantly more semantically overlap-
ping turns than children with TD, across dif-
ferent turn intervals. These results support our
hypothesis, and could provide a convenient
and robust ASD-specific behavioral marker.

1 Introduction

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurode-
velopmental disorder characterized by two broad
groups of symptoms: impaired social communica-
tion and presence of restrictive and repetitive behav-
ior (RRB) (American Psychiatric Association, 2000;
American Psychiatric Association, 2013). RRB
comprises both lower-order behaviors such as mo-
tor movements and higher-order cognitive behav-
iors such as circumscribed interests and insistence
on sameness. Both of these are manifest in lan-
guage as well. (Boyd et al., 2012; Szatmari et

al., 2006; Turner, 1999; Kanner, 1943). All ma-
jor ASD diagnostic instruments require the evalua-
tion of RRB (Rutter et al., 2003; Lord et al., 2002;
Lord et al., 1994). Individuals with ASD have sig-
nificantly more RRB, stereotyped phrases, and id-
iosyncratic utterances in their conversations (Nadig
et al., 2010; Capps et al., 1998; Volden and Lord,
1991).

However, such assessments are mostly qualita-
tive, relying on clinical impressions or parental re-
ports. There has been little work on quantitative
or automated assessment methods for these behav-
iors in ASD, possibly due to the significant ef-
fort of detailed annotation of conversations that this
would entail. Previous research in our group an-
alyzed automatic detection of poor topic mainte-
nance and use of off-topic words (Rouhizadeh et
al., 2013; Prud’hommeaux and Rouhizadeh, 2012).
We have also explored the different directions of de-
parture from the target topic in ASD (rou, 2014;
Prud’hommeaux et al., 2014).

In this paper, we attempt to automatically assess
the presence of RRB in language, specifically at
the semantic level, in children’s conversation with
an adult examiner during a semi-structured dia-
logue. We expect children with ASD to talk about
fewer topics more repeatedly during their conversa-
tions. Specifically, we hypothesize a significantly
higher semantic overlap ratio (SOR) between dia-
logue turns in children with ASD compared to those
with typical development (TD). In order to calcu-
late the SOR at different turn intervals for each
child, we apply multiple semantic similarity metrics
(weighted by child specificity scores) on every turn

117



pair in four distance windows. We then compute the
SOR for each child by averaging the similarity of ev-
ery turn pair in the four distance windows. Our anal-
ysis indicates that, based on different similarity met-
rics, the ASD group had a significantly higher SOR
than the TD group in most of the distance windows.
These results support our hypothesis. Thus, patterns
of semantic similarity between child’s turns could
provide an automated and robust ASD-specific be-
havioral marker.

In a previous study, van Santen and colleagues
(van Santen et al., 2013) reported an automated
method for identifying and quantifying two types of
repetitive speech in ASD: repetitions of what child
him or herself said (intra-speaker repetitions) and
of what the conversation partner said (inter-speaker
repetitions, or echolalia). The focus of this study
was on verbatim repeats of word n-grams at short
turn distances. The present study differs in several
ways. (1) We focus on intra-child repetitions only.
(2) We do so using bag-of-words similarity mea-
sures and lexical semantic expansion. (3) We con-
sider short and long turn distance windows. (4) We
use frequency weighting, assigning lower weights to
frequent words.

2 Participants and data

Participants in this study include 44 children with
TD and 25 children with ASD. ASD was diagnosed
via clinical consensus according to the DSM-IV-TR
criteria (American Psychiatric Association, 2000)
and established threshold scores on two diagnos-
tic instruments: the Autism Diagnostic Observation
Schedule (ADOS) (Lord et al., 2002); and the Social
Communication Questionnaire (Rutter et al., 2003).
None of the ASD children in this study met crite-
ria for a language impairment, defined as having a
Core Language Score (CLS) on the CELF (Semel et
al., 2003) of more than one standard deviation be-
low the mean. The groups were well matched in age
(6.41 vs. 5.91 years for the ASD and TD groups,
respectively; p>0.2), and Nonverbal IQ (114.0 and
118.4; p>0.25), but not for nonverbal IQ (108 and
119; p<0.0025).

Each participant’s ADOS session was recorded
and the recordings were transcribed. The examiner
and transcribers were unaware of the child’s diag-

nostic status, the study hypothesis, and the compu-
tational methods. The automated methods in this pa-
per are applied to these un-annotated raw transcripts.

The ADOS is a widely-used instrument for ASD
diagnosis. It consists of a semi-structured series of
spontaneous conversations and interactions between
a child and a examiner (usually 30 to 60 minutes
long) in which the examiner asks questions and pro-
vides prompts that serve to bring out verbal and non-
verbal behaviors indicative of ASD. The ADOS cov-
ers a broad range of conversational topics and activ-
ities, including Picture Description, Play, and Word-
less Picture Book Description activities. Our expec-
tation is that even though the activities, conversation
topics, and actual questions are standardized, ASD
children will tend to stick with their own topics of
interest to a larger degree than children with TD.

3 Measuring the semantic overlap ratio
(SOR)

For each child, we compute the semantic similarity
score between every turn pair I and J in the follow-
ing exponentially increasing distance windows, D:

a) 0<D≤3: J is between 1 to 3 turns after I ,
b) 3<D≤9,
c) 9<D≤27,
d) 27<D≤81.

Then we compute the child’s SOR for a given
window D by averaging the similarity scores of turn
pairs in D. We explored four semantic similarly
measures which we describe in this section.

3.1 Semantic Similarity Measures

We expect ASD children to use more specific terms,
relevant to their particular and often idiosyncratic in-
terest due to their restrictive behavior. Therefore,
we want our measures to be sensitive to how com-
mon or uncommon the words used by an individual
child are. To assign lower weights to words used
frequently by a large number of children, we apply
an inverse document frequency (IDF) term weight
using the standard definition of IDF in Information
Retrieval (IR) (Manning et al., 2008):

idfw=log
( N

dfw

)
(1)

118



where N is the total number of participants and dfw
is the number of children who used the word w.
We also lemmatize our corpus to reduce the sparsity
(hence higher IDF weights) caused by inflectional
variations of the same lexeme.

3.1.1 Weighted Jaccard Similarity Coefficient
The weighted Jaccard similarity coefficient (Jac)

(Jaccard, 1912) is a word overlap measure between
a pair of turns I and J defined as the sum of the
minimum term frequency of each overlapping word
w in I and J weighted by idfw, and then normalized
by the sum of the maximum term frequency of each
word in either turn:

Jac(I, J)=

∑
w∈I∩J

min(tfw,I , tfw,J)× idfw∑
w∈I∪J

max(tfw,I , tfw,J)
(2)

where tfw,I is the term frequency of word w in turn
I (number of times w occurs in I), and tfw,J is the
term frequency of w in J .

3.1.2 Cosine Similarity Score
The cosine similarity score (Cos) is a popular

metric in IR to measure the similarity between the
two turns I and J via the cosine of the angle be-
tween their vectors. We assign IDF weights to term
frequencies, and then normalize the turn vectors by
their length and the term weights:

Cos(I, J)=∑
w∈I∩J

tfw,I × tfw,J × (idfw)2√ ∑
wi∈I

(tfwi,I × idfwi)2 ×
√ ∑

wj∈j
(tfwj ,J × idfwj )2

(3)

3.1.3 Relative Frequency Measure
The relative frequency measure (RF ) (Hoad and

Zobel, 2003) is introduced as an author identity mea-
sure for detecting plagiarism at the document level.
However, it has been shown to be applicable to the
sentence level as well (Metzler et al., 2005). For
this measure, we first normalize the differences in
the turn lengths, and, second, we measures the simi-
larity of the two turns I and J by the weighted rela-

tive frequency of their common words:

RF (I, J)=
1

1 + ||I| − |J ||
×
∑

w∈I∩J

idfw
1 + |tfw,I − tfw,J | (4)

3.1.4 Knowledge-Based Similarity Measure
We now generalize our measures that are based on

verbatim overlap to non-verbatim overlap. Toward
this end, we use a knowledge-based turn similarity
measure KBS that integrates verbatim word overlap
with lexical relatedness (Mihalcea et al., 2006).

We begin with finding the maximum lexical simi-
larity score S(wi, J) for each word wi in turn I with
words in turn J using the following formulation:

S(wi, J)=

{
1× idfwi if wi∈J
max
wj∈J

LS(wi, wj)× idfwi otherwise
(5)

where LS is Lin’s universal similarity (Lin, 1998).
In other words, if the word wi is present in J ,

S(wi, J) will be 1 multiplied by idfwi . If not, the
most similar word to wi will be chosen from words
in J using Lin’s universal similarity and S(wi, J)
will be that maximum score multiplied by idfwi . The
same procedure is applied to the words in J , and fi-
nally the similarity between I and J is calculated :

KBS(I, J)=
1
2

( ∑
wi∈I

S(wi, J)∑
wi∈I

idfwi
+

∑
wj∈J

S(wj , I)∑
wj∈J

idfwj

)
(6)

Lin’s universal similarity can only be applied to
word pairs with the same part-of-speech (POS).
For automatic POS tagging of the ADOS corpus,
we trained a multi-class classifier (Yarmohammadi,
2014) from labeled training data from the CHILDES
corpus of transcripts of children’s conversational
speech (MacWhinney, 2000). The classifier uses
a discriminative linear model, learning the model
parameters with the averaged perceptron algorithm
(Collins, 2002). The feature set includes bigrams of
surrounding words, a window of size 2 of the next

119



and previous words, and the POS-tag of the previ-
ous word. An additional orthographical feature set
is used to tag rare and unknown words. This feature
set includes prefixes and suffixes of the words (up to
4 characters), and presence of a hyphen, digit, or an
uppercase character.

4 Results

As described in Section 3, we use our measures to
calculate the similarity scores of all turn pairs for
each distance window. Table 1 shows examples
of similar turn pairs in the four distance windows
based on the Weighted Jaccard Similarity Coeffi-
cient score.

We then calculate the SOR of each child in each
given distance window by averaging the similarity
scores of turn pairs in that window. Finally, we per-
form a two-tailed Mann-Whitney’s U test, which is a
non-parametric test of significance that does not as-
sume that scores have a normal distribution. It eval-
uates the statistical difference between the SOR in
ASD and TD children by comparing the medians of
the two groups. For each similarity measure we re-
port the medians of SOR in ASD and TD groups
(with the group mean rank) as well as the signif-
icance test results: Mann-Whitney’s U-Value (re-
ported as W ), P-Value (p), and the effect size (R).

Table 2 shows that both ASD and TD groups have
a greater SOR in shorter distances with more sig-
nificant difference and higher effect size. We see a
decreasing trend in SOR by exponentially increas-
ing the window size and distance. For each analysis,
ASD group has a higher SOR than TD and the differ-
ence is statistically significant (p<0.05) in all short
distances (up to 9<D≤27) and marginally missed
the standard significance levels for the longest win-
dow (p<0.1 in 27<D≤81). We also investigated
the effect of distance window on SOR in a different
window set. The results are shown in Figure 1 us-
ing the KBS measure. We observe the exact same
trend in these new windows as our main distance
windows. All the differences between SOR in ASD
and TD are statistically significant as well (p<0.05).

The comparison between various semantic sim-
ilarity measures also indicates that KBS measure
which takes into account lexical similarity in addi-
tion to word overlap, have more statistical power

Figure 1: Semantic Overlap Ratio in ASD and TD at
different turn distance windows using the KBS measure

to distinguish between ASD and TD groups in the
longer windows (9<D≤27 and 27<D≤81). This
observation is reasonably consistent with our expec-
tations that children may use synonyms and seman-
tically similar words (rather than the exact set of
words) within the same topic space especially in the
longer distances.

To address the possible confounding effect of ver-
bal IQ, where a small but significant difference be-
tween the groups was found, we conducted two ad-
ditional analyses. In one, we used analysis of covari-
ance, with age, VIQ, and NVIQ as covariates; unlike
W, there is no non-parametric equivalent of the anal-
ysis of covariance. In the other, we applied an algo-
rithm that iteratively removes data until no signifi-
cant group difference remains (at p>0.15) on age,
VIQ, or NVIQ. Both analyses provided results that,
while quantitatively different, were qualitatively the
same.

5 Conclusions and future work

The results obtained with the methods presented
here for measuring the semantic overlap between
conversational turns in children with and without
ASD in a spontaneous conversation indicate the util-
ity of natural language processing for capturing di-
agnostically relevant information. The higher ra-
tio of semantic overlap in children with ASD com-
pared with TD children suggests that children with
ASD are returning to specific topics more repeat-
edly. Thus, the findings support our hypothesis.

We are proposing a method of enabling measure-
ment of a characteristic of language use in ASD that
is currently “known" to be aberrant but is now as-
certained only by impressionistic judgments rather
than by quantification; and this is performed auto-
matically on easy-to-obtain raw transcriptions of a
clinical behavioral observation session (the ADOS)
as opposed to requiring labor-intensive expert cod-
ing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
time that verbal repetitiveness in natural language
samples has been successfully measured — quan-
titatively, and automatically.

A major focus of our future work will be to au-
tomatically detect the topics introduced by the ex-
aminer to the child. The main assumption of this
work is that children with ASD return to a set of
topics during their conversation, no matter if they or
the examiner initiated the topic. Given the high se-
mantic overlap ratio seen here, we expect that chil-
dren with autism contribute in conversations related
to their particular topic of interest, rather than col-
laborating with the examiner in a dialogue.

A second area to investigate in the future is deter-
mining the children’s conversation topics, especially
the ones that are repeated. We could combine the
child specificity scores such as IDF with the highly
overlapping lexical items across different turns. We
could also use manual annotation and clinical im-
pression to determine if a child has a particular (id-
iosyncratic) topic of interest . We could then com-
pare these annotations with the findings from our au-
tomated measures.

Third, we are also interested in trying additional
similarity measures including BLEU (Papineni et
al., 2002), ROUGE, (Lin, 2004), and Latent Seman-
tic Analysis (Deerwester et al., 1990) to verify the
robustness of our findings even further.

Finally, we plan to apply our methods to the out-
put of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) sys-
tems to eliminate the transcription process. Measur-
ing semantic similarity on ASR output will be an in-
teresting challenge since it will likely contain word
errors especially in children’s spontaneous speech.
