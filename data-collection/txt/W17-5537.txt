Abstract

Effective models of social dialog must un-
derstand a broad range of rhetorical and
figurative devices. Rhetorical questions
(RQs) are a type of figurative language
whose aim is to achieve a pragmatic goal,
such as structuring an argument, being
persuasive, emphasizing a point, or be-
ing ironic. While there are computa-
tional models for other forms of figura-
tive language, rhetorical questions have re-
ceived little attention to date. We expand
a small dataset from previous work, pre-
senting a corpus of 10,270 RQs from de-
bate forums and Twitter that represent dif-
ferent discourse functions. We show that
we can clearly distinguish between RQs
and sincere questions (0.76 F1). We then
show that RQs can be used both sarcasti-
cally and non-sarcastically, observing that
non-sarcastic (other) uses of RQs are fre-
quently argumentative in forums, and per-
suasive in tweets. We present experiments
to distinguish between these uses of RQs
using SVM and LSTM models that repre-
sent linguistic features and post-level con-
text, achieving results as high as 0.76 F1
for SARCASTIC and 0.77 F1 for OTHER in
forums, and 0.83 F1 for both SARCASTIC
and OTHER in tweets. We supplement our
quantitative experiments with an in-depth
characterization of the linguistic variation
in RQs.

1 Introduction

Theoretical frameworks for figurative language
posit eight standard forms: indirect questions, id-
iom, irony and sarcasm, metaphor, simile, hy-
perbole, understatement, and rhetorical questions

sures liberal OH yes, it’s because you’re a republican

Table 1: RQs and Following Statements in Forums
and Twitter Dialog

(Roberts and Kreuz, 1994). While computational
models have been developed for many of these
forms, rhetorical questions (RQs) have received
little attention to date. Table 1 shows examples
of RQs from social media in debate forums and
Twitter, where their use is prevalent.

RQs are defined as utterances that have the
structure of a question, but which are not intended
to seek information or elicit an answer (Rohde,
2006; Frank, 1990; Ilie, 1994; Sadock, 1971). RQs
are often used in arguments and expressions of
opinion, advertisements and other persuasive do-
mains (Petty et al., 1981), and are frequent in so-
cial media and other types of informal language.

some forms of figurative language have been fa-
cilitated by the use of hashtags in Twitter, e.g. the
#sarcasm hashtag (Bamman and Smith, 2015;
Riloff et al., 2013; Liebrecht et al., 2013). Other
figurative forms, such as similes, can be identified
via lexico-syntactic patterns (Qadir et al., 2016,
2015; Veale and Hao, 2007). RQs are not marked
by a hashtag, and their syntactic form is indis-
tinguishable from standard questions (Han, 2002;
Sadock, 1971).

Previous theoretical work examines the dis-
course functions of RQs and compares the over-
lap in discourse functions across all forms of fig-
urative language (Roberts and Kreuz, 1994). For
RQs, 72% of subjects assign to clarify as a func-
tion, 39% assign discourse management, 28%
mention to emphasize, 56% percent of subjects
assign negative emotion, and another 28% men-
tion positive emotion.1 The discourse functions of
clarification, discourse management and empha-
sis are clearly related to argumentation. One of
the other largest overlaps in discourse function be-
tween RQs and other figurative forms is between
RQs and irony/sarcasm (62% overlap), and there
are many studies describing how RQs are used sar-
castically (Gibbs, 2000; Ilie, 1994).

To better understand the relationship between
RQs and irony/sarcasm, we expand on a small ex-
isting dataset of RQs in debate forums from our
previous work (Oraby et al., 2016), ending up with
a corpus of 2,496 RQs and the self-answers or
statements that follow them. We use the heuris-
tic described in that work to collect a completely
novel corpus of 7,774 RQs from Twitter. Exam-
ples from our final dataset of 10,270 RQs and
their following self-answers/statements are shown
in Table 1. We observe great diversity in the use of
RQs, ranging from sarcastic and mocking (such as
the forum post in Row 2), to offering advice based
on some anticipated answer (such as the tweet in
Row 6).

In this study, we first show that RQs can clearly
be distinguished from sincere, information-
seeking questions (0.76 F1). Because we are inter-
ested in how RQs are used sarcastically, we define
our task as distinguishing sarcastic uses from other
uses RQs, observing that non-sarcastic RQs are of-
ten used argumentatively in forums (as opposed
to the more mocking sarcastic uses), and persua-

1Subjects could provide multiple discourse functions for
RQs, thus the frequencies do not add to 1.

sively in Twitter (as frequent advertisements and
calls-to-action). To distinguish between sarcas-
tic and other uses, we perform classification ex-
periments using SVM and LSTM models, explor-
ing different levels of context, and showing that
adding linguistic features improves classification
results in both domains.

This paper provides the first in-depth investiga-
tion of the use of RQs in different forms of social
media dialog. We present a novel task, dataset2,
and results aimed at understanding how RQs can
be recognized, and how sarcastic and other uses of
RQs can be distinguished.

2 Related Work

Much of the previous work on RQs has focused
on RQs as a form of figurative language, and
on describing their discourse functions (Schaf-
fer, 2005; Gibbs, 2000; Roberts and Kreuz, 1994;
Frank, 1990; Petty et al., 1981). Related work
in linguistics has primarily focused on the differ-
ences between RQs and standard questions (Han,
2002; Ilie, 1994; Han, 1997). For example Sadock
(1971) shows that RQs can be followed by a yet
clause, and that the discourse cue after all at the
beginning of the question leads to its interpreta-
tion as an RQ. Phrases such as by any chance are
primarily used on information seeking questions,
while negative polarity items such as lift a finger
or budge an inch can only be used with RQs, e.g.
Did John help with the party? vs. Did John lift a
finger to help with the party?

RQs were introduced into the DAMSL coding
scheme when it was applied to the Switchboard
corpus (Jurafsky et al., 1997). To our knowledge,
the only computational work utilizing that data is
by Battasali et al. (2015), who used n-gram lan-
guage models with pre- and post-context to dis-
tinguish RQs from regular questions in SWBD-
DAMSL. Using context improved their results to
0.83 F1 on a balanced dataset of 958 instances,
demonstrating that context information could be
very useful for this task.

Although it has been observed in the literature
that RQs are often used sarcastically (Gibbs, 2000;
Ilie, 1994), previous work on sarcasm classifica-
tion has not focused on RQs (Bamman and Smith,
2015; Riloff et al., 2013; Liebrecht et al., 2013; Fi-
latova, 2012; González-Ibáñez et al., 2011; Davi-

dov et al., 2010; Tsur et al., 2010). Riloff et al.
(2013) investigated the utility of sequential fea-
tures in tweets, emphasizing a subtype of sar-
casm that consists of an expression of positive
emotion contrasted with a negative situation, and
showed that sequential features performed much
better than features that did not capture sequen-
tial information. More recent work on sarcasm
has focused specifically on sarcasm identification
on Twitter using neural network approaches (Poria
et al, 2016; Ghosh and Veale, 2016; Zhang et al.,
2016; Amir et al., 2016).

Other work emphasizes features of semantic
incongruity in recognizing sarcasm (Joshi et al.,
2015; Reyes et al., 2012). Sarcastic RQs clearly
feature semantic incongruity, in some cases by
expressing the certainty of particular facts in the
frame of a question, and in other cases by asking
questions like “Can you read?” (Row 2 in Ta-
ble 1), a competence which a speaker must have,
prima facie, to participate in online discussion.

To our knowledge, our previous work is the
first to consider the task of distinguishing sarcas-
tic vs. not-sarcastic RQs, where we construct a
corpus of sarcasm in three types: generic, RQ,
and hyperbole, and provide simple baseline exper-
iments using ngrams (0.70 F1 for SARC and 0.71
F1 for NOT-SARC) (Oraby et al., 2016). Here, we
adopt the same heuristic for gathering RQs and ex-
pand the corpus in debate forums, also collecting
a novel Twitter corpus. We show that we can dis-
tinguish between SARCASTIC and OTHER uses of
RQs that we observe, such as argumentation and
persuasion in forums and Twitter, respectively. We
show that linguistic features aid in the classifica-
tion task, and explore the effects of context, using
traditional and neural models.

3 Corpus Creation

Sarcasm is a prevalent discourse function of RQs.
In previous work, we observe both sarcastic and
not-sarcastic uses of RQs in forums, and collect a
set of sarcastic and not-sarcastic RQs in debate by
using a heuristic stating that an RQ is a question
that occurs in the middle of a turn, and which is
answered immediately by the speaker themselves
(Oraby et al., 2016). RQs are thus defined inten-
tionally: the speaker indicates that their intention
is not to elicit an answer by not ceding the turn.3

3We acknowledge that this method may miss RQs that do
not follow this heuristic, but opt to use this conservative pat-

Table 2: Sarcastic vs. Other Uses of RQs

In this work, we are interested in doing a closer
analysis of RQs in social media. We use the same
RQ-collection heuristic from previous work to
expand our corpus of SARCASTIC vs. OTHER
uses RQs in debate forums, and create another
completely novel corpus of RQs in Twitter. We
observe that the other uses of RQs in forums
are often argumentative, aimed at structuring an
argument more emphatically, clearly, or concisely,
whereas in Twitter they are frequently persuasive
in nature, aimed at advertising or grabbing atten-
tion. Table 2 shows examples of sarcastic and
other uses of RQs in our corpus, and we describe
our data collection methods for both domains
below.

Debate Forums: The Internet Argument Corpus
(IAC 2.0) (Abbott et al., 2016) contains a large
number of discussions about politics and social is-
sues, making it a good source of RQs. Following
our previous work (2016), we first extract RQs in

tern for expanding the data to avoid introducing extra noise.

312



posts whose length varies from 10-150 words, and
collect five annotations for each of the RQs paired
with the context of their following statements.

We ask Turkers to specify whether or not
the RQ-response pair is sarcastic, as a binary
question. We count a post as “sarcastic” if the
majority of annotators (at least 3 of the 5) labeled
the post as sarcastic. Including the 851 posts per
class from previous work (Oraby et al., 2016),
this resulted in 1,248 sarcastic posts out of 4,840
(25.8%), a significantly larger percentage than the
estimated 12% sarcasm ratio in debate forums
(Swanson et al., 2014). We then balance the 1,248
sarcastic RQs with an equal number of RQs that
0 or 1 annotators voted as sarcastic, giving us a
total of 2,496 RQ pairs. For our experiments, all
annotators had above 80% agreement with the
majority vote.

Twitter: We also extract RQs defined as above
from a set of 80,000 tweets with a #sarcasm,
#sarcastic, or #sarcastictweet hashtag.
We use the hashtags as “labels”, as in other work
(Riloff et al., 2013; Reyes et al., 2012). This yields
3,887 sarcastic RQ tweets, again balanced with
3,887 RQ pairs from a set of random tweets (not
containing any sarcasm-related hashtags). We re-
move all sarcasm-related hashtags and username
mentions (prefixed with an “@”) from the posts,
for a total of 7,774 total RQ tweets.

4 Experimental Results

In this section, we present experiments classifying
rhetorical vs. information-seeking questions, then
sarcastic vs. other uses of RQs.

4.1 RQs vs. Information-Seeking Qs

By definition, fact-seeking questions are not RQs.
We take advantage of the annotations provided
for subsets of the IAC, in particular the sub-
corpus that distinguishes FACTUAL posts from
EMOTIONAL posts (Abbott et al., 2016; Oraby
et al., 2015).4 Table 3 shows examples of
FACTUAL/INFO-SEEKING questions.

To test whether RQ and FACTUAL/INFO-
SEEKING questions are easily distinguishable, we
randomly select a sample of 1,020 questions from
our forums RQ corpus, and balance them with
the same number of questions from FACT corpus.
We divide the question data into 80% train and

grid-search on our training set using 3-fold cross-
validation for parameter tuning, and report results
on our test set. Table 4 shows the precision (P), re-
call (R) and F1 scores we achieve, showing good
classification performance for distinguishing both
classes, at 0.76 F1 for the RQ class, and 0.74 F1
for the FACTUAL/INFO-SEEKING class.

Fact/Info-Seeking Questions in Debate Forums

4.2 Sarcastic vs. Other Uses of RQs

Next, we focus on distinguishing SARCASTIC
from OTHER uses of RQs in forums and Twit-
ter. We divide the full RQ data from each domain
(2,496 forums and 7,774 tweets, balanced between
the two classes) into 80% train and 20% test data.
We experiment with two models, an SVM clas-
sifier from Scikit Learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011),
and a bidirectional LSTM model (Chollet, 2015)
with a TensorFlow backend (Abadi et al., 2016).
We perform a grid-search using cross-validation
on our training set for parameter tuning, and re-
port results on our test set.

For each of the models, we establish a base-
line with W2V features (Google News-trained
Word2Vec size 300 (Mikolov et al., 2013) for the
debate forums, and Twitter-trained Word2Vec size
400 (Godin et al., 2015), for the tweets). We
experiment with different embedding representa-
tions, finding that we achieve best results by aver-
aging the word embeddings for each input when
using SVM, and creating an embedding matrix
(number of words by embedding size for each in-

put) as input to an embedding layer when using
LSTM.5

For our LSTM model, we experiment with var-
ious different layer architectures from previous
work (Poria et al, 2016; Ghosh and Veale, 2016;
Zhang et al., 2016; Amir et al., 2016). For our fi-
nal model (shown in Figure 1), we use a sequential
embedding layer, 1D convolutional layer, max-
pooling, a bidirectional LSTM, dropout layer, and
a sequence of dense and dropout layers with a final
sigmoid activation layer for the output.

For additional features, we experiment with us-
ing post-level scores (frequency of each category
in the input, normalized by word count) from the
Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) tool
(Pennebaker et al., 2001). We experiment with
which LIWC categories to include as features on
our training data, and end up with a set of 20 cat-
egories for each domain6, as shown in Table 5.
When adding features to the LSTM model, we in-
clude a dense and merge layer to concatenate fea-
tures, followed by the dense and dropout layers
and sigmoid output.

We experiment with different levels of textual
context in training for both the forums and Twit-
ter data (keeping our test set constant, always test-
ing on only the RQ and self-answer portion of the
text). We are motivated by the intuition that train-
ing on larger context will help us identify more
informative segments of RQs in test. Specifically,

5In future work, we plan to further explore the effects of
different embedding representations on model performance.

6We discuss some of the highly-informative LIWC cate-
gories by domain in Sec. 5.

Table 6 presents our results on the classification

task by model for each domain, showing P, R, and
F1 scores for each class (forums in Table 6a and
Twitter in Table 6b). For each domain, we present
the same experiments for both models (SVM and
LSTM), first showing a W2V baseline (Rows 1
and 6 in both tables), then adding in LIWC (Rows
2 and 7), and finally presenting results for W2V
and LIWC features on different context levels
(Rows 2-5 for SVM and Rows 7-10 for LSTM).

Debate Forums: From Table 6a, for both mod-
els, we observe that the addition of LIWC features
gives us a large improvement over the baseline of
just W2V features, particularly for the SARC class
(from 0.72 F1 to 0.76 F1 SARC and 0.73 F1 to 0.77
F1 OTHER for SVM in Rows 1-2, and from 0.68 F1
to 0.72 F1 SARC and 0.74 F1 to 0.75 F1 OTHER
for LSTM in Rows 6-7). Our best results come
from the SVM model, with best scores of 0.76 F1
for SARC and 0.77 OTHER in Row 2 from using

only the RQ and self-response in training (with the
same F1 for SARC when training on the full text).

We observe that while the SVM results with
LIWC features do not change significantly de-
pending on the training context (Rows 3-5),
the LSTM model is highly sensitive to context
changes for the SARC class (Rows 8-10). Some
interesting findings emerge when training on dif-
ferent context granularities for LSTM: our best
LSTM results for the SARC class come from train-
ing on the RQ+Post context (0.75 F1 in Row 9),
and for the Pre+RQ context for the OTHER class
(0.76 F1 in Row 8). We note that this increase
in the SARC class from plain word embeddings to
word embeddings combined with LIWC and con-
text is larger than the increase in the OTHER class,
indicating that post-level context for SARC cap-
tures more diverse instances in training. We also

note that these results beat our previous baselines
using only ngram features on the smaller original
dataset of 851 posts per class (0.70 F1 for SARC,
0.71 F1 for NOT-SARC) (Oraby et al., 2016).

We investigate why certain context features
benefit each class differently for LSTM. Table 7
shows examples of single posts, divided into Pre,
RQ, and Post. Looking at Row 1, it is clear that
while the RQ and self-answer portion may not ap-
pear to be sarcastic, the Post context makes the
sarcasm much more pronounced. This is frequent
in the case of sarcastic debate posts, where the
speaker often ends with a sharp remark or an inter-
jection (like “gasp!!!”), or emoticons (like wink-
ing ;) or roll-eyes 8-)). In the case of the OTHER
forums posts, the RQ is often nestled within se-
quences of questions, or other RQ and self-answer
pairs (Row 2).

(b) SARC vs. OTHER RQs in Context on Twitter

Table 7: Sarcastic vs. Other Uses RQs in Context

Twitter: From Table 6b, we observe that the best
result of 0.83 F1 for the SARC class come from
the SVM model (for all context levels), while the
best result of 0.83 F1 for the OTHER class comes
from the LSTM model. We observe a strong per-
formance increase from adding in LIWC features
for both models, even more pronounced than for
forums (0.80 F1 to 0.83 F1 SARC and 0.78 F1 to
0.82 F1 OTHER for SVM in Rows 1-2, and 0.73 F1
to 0.81 F1 SARC and 0.75 F1 to 0.80 F1 OTHER for
LSTM in Rows 6-7).

Again, while the SVM results do not vary based
on changes in context, there is a large improve-
ment in the OTHER class for LSTM when us-
ing RQ + Post level context, giving us our best

OTHER class results. From Table 9 Row 4, we see
an example of a “call-to-action” that are frequent
and distinctive in non-sarcastic Twitter RQs, ask-
ing users to visit a link at the end of a tweet (Post
RQ). In the case of the SARC tweet in Row 3,
the extra tweet-level context (such as initial excla-
mations/interjections) aids in highlighting the sar-
casm, but is limited in length compared to the fo-
rums posts, explaining the smaller gain from con-
text in the Twitter domain for SARC.

Comparing both domains, we observe that the
results for tweets in Table 6b are much higher than
the results for forums in Table 6a, noting that this
could be a result of less lexical diversity and a
larger amount of data, making them more distin-
guishable than the more varied forums posts. We
plan to explore these differences more extensively
in future work.

5 Linguistic Characteristics of RQs by
Class and Domain

In this section, we discuss linguistic characteris-
tics we observe in our SARCASTIC vs OTHER uses
of RQs using the most informative LIWC features.

Previous work has observed that FACTUAL ut-
terances are often very heavy on technical jargon
(Oraby et al., 2015): this is also true of factual
questions. When analyzing differences in LIWC
categories in our factual vs. RQ data, we find that
our factual questions are slightly longer on average
than the RQs (14 words on average compared to
12). We also find significant differences in “func-
tion” word categories (p < 0.05, unpaired t-test)
in LIWC, marking use of personal references, and
“affective processes” (p < 0.005). Both cate-
gories are more prevalent in the RQS than in the
FACT questions, indicating more emotional lan-
guage that is targeted towards the second party.

A qualitative analysis of our SARCASTIC vs.
OTHER data shows that sarcastic RQs in forums
are often followed by short statements that serve
to point attention or mock, whereas the other RQ-
self-response pairs often serve as a technique to
concisely structure an argument. RQs in Twitter
are frequently advertisements (persuasive commu-
nication) (Petty et al., 1981), making them more
distinguishable from the more diverse sarcastic in-
stances. Tables 8 and 9 show examples of LIWC
features that are most characteristic of each do-
main and class based on our experiments. For
ranking, we show the learned feature weight (FW)

for each class, found by performing 10-fold cross-
validation on each training set using an SVM
model with only LIWC features.

In Table 8, Row 1, we observe that 2nd person
mentions are frequent in the sarcastic debate fo-
rums posts (referring to the other person in the de-
bate), while in the Twitter domain, they come up
as significant features in the non-sarcastic tweets,
where they are used as methods to persuade read-
ers to interact: click a link, like, comment, share
(Table 9, Row 6). Likewise, “informal” words and
more “verbal speech style” non-fluencies, includ-
ing exclamations and social media slang (“nets-
peak”), also appear in sarcastic debate (Table 8,
Rows 2 and 4). Features of sarcastic forums in-
clude exclamations (Table 8, Rows 3), often used
in a hyperbolic or figurative manner (McCarthy
and Carter, 2004; Roberts and Kreuz, 1994). We
find that sarcastic tweets frequently include sets
of exclamations/interjections strung together with
commas (Table 9, Row 1), and are often shorter
than the tweets in the non-sarcastic class (Table 9,
Row 3).

Table 8 shows that “interrogatives” are a strong
feature of argumentative forums (Row 7), as well
as the use of technical jargon (including quanti-
fiers health words with some domain-specific top-

ics, such as abortion) (Row 8). Table 9 indicates
that OTHER tweets frequently contain forms of ad-
vertisement and calls-to-action involving 2nd per-
son references (Row 7). Similarly, RQ tweets
are sometimes used to express frustration (“swear
words” in Row 5), or increase engagement with
references to “friends” and followers (Row 8).

6 Conclusions

In this study, we expand on a small corpus from
previous work to create a large corpus of RQs in
two domains where RQs are prevalent: debate fo-
rums and Twitter. To our knowledge, this is the
first in-depth study dedicated to sarcasm and other
uses of RQs in social media. We present super-
vised learning experiments using traditional and
neural models to classify sarcasm in each domain,
providing analysis of unique features across do-
mains and classes, and exploring the effects of
training of different levels of context.

We first show that we can distinguish between
information-seeking and rhetorical questions (0.76
F1). We then focus on classifying sarcasm in only
the RQs, showing that there are distinct linguis-
tic differences between the methods of expression
used in RQs across forums and Twitter. For fo-
rums, we show that we are able to distinguish be-

317



tween the sarcastic and other uses (noting they
are often argumentative) in forums with 0.76 F1
for SARC and 0.77 F1 for NOT-SARC, improving
on our baselines from previous work on a smaller
dataset (Oraby et al., 2016).

We also explore sarcastic and other uses of RQs
on Twitter, noting that other non-sarcastic uses of
RQs are often advertisements, a form of persua-
sive communication not represented in debate di-
alog. We show that we can distinguish between
sarcastic and other uses of RQ in Twitter with
scores of 0.83 F1 for both the SARC and OTHER
classes. We observe that tweets are generally
more easily distinguished than the more diverse
forums, and that the addition of linguistic cate-
gories from LIWC greatly improves classification
performance. We also note that the LSTM model
is more sensitive to context changes than the SVM
model, and plan to explore the differences between
the models in greater detail in future work.

Other future work also includes expanding our
dataset to capture more instances of what may
characterize RQs across these domains to improve
performance, and also to analyze other interesting
domains, such as Reddit. We believe that it will
be possible to improve our results by using more
robust models, and also by developing features to
represent the sequential properties of RQs by fur-
ther utilizing the larger context of the surrounding
dialog in our analysis.
