Abstract

We present an analysis of 16 state-of-the-art
MT systems on German-English based on a
linguistically-motivated test suite. The test sui-
te has been devised manually by a team of lan-
guage professionals in order to cover a broad
variety of linguistic phenomena that MT of-
ten fails to translate properly. It contains 5,000
test sentences covering 106 linguistic pheno-
mena in 14 categories, with an increased focus
on verb tenses, aspects and moods. The MT
outputs are evaluated in a semi-automatic way
through regular expressions that focus only on
the part of the sentence that is relevant to each
phenomenon. Through our analysis, we are ab-
le to compare systems based on their perfor-
mance on these categories. Additionally, we
reveal strengths and weaknesses of particular
systems and we identify grammatical pheno-
mena where the overall performance of MT is
relatively low.

1 Introduction

The evaluation of Machine Translation (MT) has
mostly relied on methods that produce a numeri-
cal judgment on the correctness of a test set. These
methods are either based on the human percepti-
on of the correctness of the MT output (Callison-
Burch et al., 2007), or on automatic metrics that
compare the MT output with the reference transla-
tion (Papineni et al., 2002; Snover et al., 2006). In
both cases, the evaluation is performed on a test-
set containing articles or small documents that are
assumed to be a random representative sample of
texts in this domain. Moreover, this kind of evalua-
tion aims at producing average scores that express
a generic sense of correctness for the entire test
set and compare the performance of several MT
systems.

Although this approach has been proven valua-
ble for the MT development and the assessment of

new methods and configurations, it has been sug-
gested that a more fine-grained evaluation, asso-
ciated with linguistic phenomena, may lead in a
better understanding of the errors, but also of the
efforts required to improve the systems (Burchardt
et al., 2016). This is done through the use of test
suites, which are carefully devised corpora, whose
test sentences include the phenomena that need to
be tested. In this paper we present the fine-grained
evaluation results of 16 state-of-the-art MT sy-
stems on German-English, based on a test suite
focusing on 106 German grammatical phenomena
with a focus on verb-related phenomena.

2 Related Work

The use of test suites in the evaluation of NLP ap-
plications (Balkan et al., 1995) and MT systems in
particular (King and Falkedal, 1990; Way, 1991)
has been proposed already in the 1990’s. For in-
stance, test suites were employed to evaluate state-
of-the-art rule-based systems (Heid and Hilden-
brand, 1991). The idea of using test suites for
MT evaluation was revived recently with the emer-
gence of Neural MT (NMT) as the produced trans-
lations reached significantly better levels of quali-
ty, leading to a need for more fine-grained qualita-
tive observations. Recent works include test suites
that focus on the evaluation of particular lingui-
stic phenomena (e.g. pronoun translation; Guillou
and Hardmeier, 2016) or more generic test sui-
tes that aim at comparing different MT technolo-
gies (Isabelle et al., 2017; Burchardt et al., 2017)
and Quality Estimation methods (Avramidis et al.,
2018). The previously presented papers differ in
the amount of phenomena and the language pairs
they cover.

This paper extends the work presented in
Burchardt et al. (2017) by including more test sen-
tences and better coverage of phenomena. In con-

578

trast to that work, which applied the test suite in
order to compare 3 different types of MT systems
(rule-based, phrase-based and NMT), the evaluati-
on in the publication at hand has been applied on
16 state-of-the-art systems whose majority follows
the NMT methods.

3 Method

This test suite is a manually devised test set, ai-
ming to investigate the MT performance against a
wide range of linguistic phenomena or other qua-
litative requirements (e.g. punctuation).

It contains a set of sentences in the source lan-
guage, written or chosen by a team of linguists
and professional translators with the aim to co-
ver as many linguistic phenomena as possible, and
particularly the ones that MT often fails to trans-
late properly. Each sentence of the test suite ser-
ves as a paradigm for investigating only one par-
ticular phenomenon. Given the test sentences, the
evaluation tests the ability of the MT systems to
properly translate the associated phenomena. The
phenomena are organized in categories (e.g. alt-
hough each verb tense is tested separately with the
respective test sentences, the results for all tenses
are aggregated in the broader category of verb ten-
se/aspect/mood).

Our test suite contains about 5,000 test sen-
tences, covering 106 phenomena organized in 14
categories. For each phenomenon at least 20 test
sentences were devised to allow better generali-
zations about the capabilities of the MT systems.
With 88%, the majority of the test suite covers
verb phenomena, but other categories, such as
negation, long distance dependencies, valency or
multi-word expressions are included as well. A
full list of the phenomena and their categories can
be seen in Table 1. An example list of test sen-
tences with correct and incorrect translations is
available on GitHub1.

3.1 Construction of the Test Suite

The test suite was constructed in a way that al-
lows a semi-automatic evaluation method, in order
to assist the efficient evaluation of many transla-
tion systems. A simplified sketch of the test sui-
te construction is shown in Figure 1. First (Figu-
re 1, stage a), the linguist choses or writes the test
sentences in the source language with the help of

1https://github.com/DFKI-NLP/TQ_
AutoTest

translators. The test sentences are manually writ-
ten or chosen, based on whether their translation
has demonstrated or is suspected to demonstrate
MT errors of the respective error categories. Test
sentences are selected from various parallel cor-
pora or drawn from existing resources, such as
the TSNLP Grammar Test Suite (Lehmann et al.,
1996) and online lists of typical translation errors.
Then (stage b) the test sentences are passed as an
input to the some sample MT systems and their
translations are fetched.

Based on the output of the sample MT systems
and the types of the errors, the linguist devises a
set of hand-crafted regular expressions (stage c)
while the translator ensures the correctness of the
expressions. The regular expressions are used to
automatically check if the output correctly trans-
lates the part of the sentence that is related to the
phenomenon under inspection. There are regular
expressions that match correct translations (posi-
tive) as well as regular expressions that match in-
correct translations (negative).

3.2 Application of the Test Suite
During the evaluation phase, the test sentences are
given to several translation systems and their out-
puts are acquired (stage d). The regular expressi-
ons are applied to the MT outputs (stage e) to auto-
matically check whether the MT outputs translate
the particular phenomenon properly. An MT out-
put is marked as correct (pass), if it matches a po-
sitive regular expression. Similarly, it is marked as
incorrect (fail), if it matches a negative regular ex-
pression. In cases where the MT output does not
match either a positive or a negative regular ex-
pression, the automatic evaluation flags an uncer-
tain decision (warning). Then, the results of the
automatic annotation are given to a linguist or a
translator who manually checks the warnings (sta-
ge f) and optionally refines the regular expressi-
ons in order to cover similar future cases. It is also
possible to add full sentences as valid translations,
instead of regular expressions. In this way, the test
suite grows constantly, whereas the required ma-
nual effort is reduced over time.

Finally, for every system we calculate the
phenomenon-specific translation accuracy:

accuracy =
correct translations

sum of test sentences
The translation accuracy per phenomenon is given
by the number of the test sentences for the pheno-

579



Figure 1: Example of the preparation and application of the test suite for one test sentence

menon which were translated properly, divided by
the number of all test sentences for this phenome-
non.

This allows us also to perform comparisons
among the systems, focusing on particular pheno-
mena. The significance of every comparison bet-
ween two systems is confirmed with a two-tailed
Z-test with α = 0.95, testing the null hypothesis
that the difference between the two respective per-
centages is zero.

3.3 Experiment setup

The evaluation of the MT outputs was performed
with TQ-AutoTest (Macketanz et al., 2018), a tool
that organizes the test items in a database, allowing
the application of the regular expressions on new
MT outputs. For the purpose of this study, we have
compared the 16 systems submitted to the test sui-
te task of the EMNLP2018 Conference of Machi-
ne Translation (WMT18) for German→English.
At the time that this paper is written, the creators
of 11 of these systems have made their develop-
ment characteristics available, 10 of them stating
that they follow a NMT method and one of them a
method combining phrase-based SMT and NMT.

After the application of the existing regular ex-
pressions to the outputs of these 16 systems, there
was a considerable amount of warnings (i.e. un-
certain judgments) that varied between 10% and
45% per system. A manual inspection of the out-
puts was consequently performed (Figure 1, sta-
ge f) by a linguist, who invested approximately 80
hours of manual annotation. A small-scale manual
inspection of the automatically assigned pass and
fail labels indicated that the percentage of the er-

roneously assigned labels is negligible. The ma-
nual inspection therefore focused on warnings and
reduced their amount to less than 10% warnings
per system2. In particular, 32.1% of the original
system outputs ended in warnings, after the ap-
plication of the regular expressions, whereas the
manual inspection and the refining of the regular
expressions additionally validated 14,000 of the-
se system outputs, i.e. 15.7% of the original test
suite.

In order to analyze the results with respect to the
existence of warnings, we performed two different
types of analysis:

1. Remove all sentences from the overall com-
parison that have even one warning for one
system and the translation accuracy on the re-
maining segments. The unsupervised systems
are completely excluded from this analysis in
order to keep the sample big enough. This
way, all systems are compared on the same
set of segments.

2. Remove the sentences with warnings per sy-
stem and calculate the translation accuracy
on the remaining segments. The unsupervi-
sed systems can be included in this analysis.
In this way, the systems are not compared on
the same set of segments, but more segments
can be included altogether.

4 Results

The final results of the evaluation can be seen in
Table 2, based on Analysis 1 and Table 3, based

systems for the reasons explained in Section 4.1.

on Analysis 2. Results for verb-related phenomena
based on Analysis 1 are detailed in Tables 4 and 5
and other indicative phenomena in Table 6. The
filtering prior to Analysis 1 left a small number of
test sentences per category, which limits the pos-
sibility to identify significant differences between
the systems. Analysis 2 allows better testing of
each system’s performance, but observations need
to be treated with caution, since the systems are te-
sted against different test sentences and therefore
the comparisons between them are not as expressi-
ve as in Analysis 1. Moreover, the interpretability
of the overall averages of these tables is limited,
as the distribution of the test sentences and the lin-
guistic phenomena does not represent an objective
notion of quality.

We have calculated the mean values per system
as non-weighted average and as weighted avera-
ge. The non-weighted average was calculated by
dividing the sum off all correct translations by the
sum of all test sentences. The weighted average
for a system was computed by taking a mean of
the averages per category. We have not calculated
statistical significances for the weighted averages
as these are less meaningful due to the dominance
of the verb tense/aspect/mood category.

4.1 Comparison between systems

The following results are based on Analysis 1.
The system that achieves the highest accuracy in
most linguistic phenomena, as compared to the
rest of the systems, is UCAM, which is in the
first significance cluster for 11 out of the 12 de-
cisive error categories in Analysis 1 and achieves
a 86.0% non-weighted average accuracy over all
test sentences. UCAM obtains a significantly bet-
ter performance than all other systems concerning
verb tense/aspect/mood, reaching a 86.9% accura-
cy, 1.5% better than MLLP and NTT which are
following in this category. The different perfor-
mance may be explained by the fact that UCAM
differs from others, since it combines several diffe-
rence neural models together with a phrase-based
SMT system in an syntactic MBR-based scheme
(Stahlberg et al., 2016). Despite its good perfor-
mance in grammatical phenomena, UCAM has a
very low accuracy regarding punctuation (52.9%).

The system with the highest weighted average
score is RWTH. Even though it reaches higher ac-
curacies for some categories than UCAM, the dif-
ferences are not statistically significant.

Another system that achieves the best accura-
cies at the 11 out of the 12 categories is Online-A.
This system performs close to the average of all
systems concerning verb tense/aspect/mood, but it
shows a significantly better performance on the ca-
tegory of punctuation (96.1%). Then, 6 systems
(JHU, NTT, Online-B, Online-Y, RWTH, Ubiqus)
have the best performance at the same amount of
categories (10 out of 12), having lost the first po-
sition in punctuation and verb tense/aspect/mood.

Two systems that have the lowest accuracies
in several categories are Online-F and Online-
G. Online-F has severe problems with the punc-
tuation (3.9%) since it failed producing proper
quotation marks in the output and mistranslated
other phenomena, such as commas and the punc-
tuation in direct speech (see Table 6). Online-G
has the worst performance concerning verb ten-
se/aspect/mood (45.8%). Additionally, these two
systems together demonstrate the worst perfor-
mance on coordination/ellipsis and negation.

The unsupervised systems form a special ca-
tegory of systems trained only on monolingual
corpora. Their outputs suffer from adequacy pro-
blems, often being very “creative” or very far from
a correct translation. Thus, the automatic evalua-
tion failed to check a vast amount of test sen-
tences on these systems. Therefore, we conduc-
ted Analysis 2. As seen in Table 3, unsupervised
systems suffer mostly on MWE (11.1% - 17.4%
accuracy), function words (15.7% - 21.7%), ambi-
guity (26.9% - 29.1%) and non-verbal agreement
(38.3% - 39.6%).

4.2 Linguistic categories

Despite the significant progress in the MT quali-
ty, we managed to devise test sentences that indi-
cate that the submitted systems have a mediocre
performance for several linguistic categories. On
average, all current state-of-the-art systems suf-
fer mostly on punctuation (and particularly quo-
tation marks), MWE, ambiguity and false friends
with an average accuracy of less than 64% (ba-
sed on Analysis 1). Verb tense/aspect/mood, non-
verbal agreement, function words and coordinati-
on/ellipsis are also far from good, with average ac-
curacies around 75%.

The two categories verb valency and named en-
tities/terminology cannot lead to comparisons on
the performance of individual systems, since all
systems achieve equal or insignificantly different

581



performance on them. The former has an average
accuracy of 81.4%, while the latter has an average
accuracy of 83.4%.

We would like to present a few examples in or-
der to provide a better understanding of the lingui-
stic categories and the evaluation. Example (1) is
taken from the category of punctuation. Among
others, we test the punctuation in the context of
direct speech. While in German it is introduced by
a colon, in English it is introduced by a comma. In
this example, the NTT system produces a correct
output (therefore highlighted in boldface), where-
as the other two systems depict incorrect translati-
ons with a colon.

(1) Punctuation
source: Er rief: ”Ich gewinne!“
NTT: He shouted, “I win!”
Online-F: He called: “I win!”
Ubiqus: He cried: “I win!”

We may assume that these errors are attributed to
the fact that punctuation is often manipulated by
hand-written pre- and post-processing tools, whe-
reas the ability of the neural architecture to proper-
ly convey the punctuation sequence has attracted
little attention and is rarely evaluated properly.
Negation is one of the most important catego-
ries for meaning preservation. Two commercial
systems (Online-F and Online-G) show the lowest
accuracy for this category and it is disappointing
that they miss 4 out of 10 negations. In Example
(2), the German negation particle “nie” should be
translated as “never”, but Online-G omits the who-
le negation. In other cases it negates the wrong ele-
ment in the sentence.

(2) Negation
source: Tim wäscht seine Kleidung nie

selber.
Online-B: Tim never washes his clothes

himself.
Online-G: Tim is washing his clothes my-

self.

MWE, such as idioms or collocations, are prone
to errors in MT as they cannot be translated in
their separate elements. Instead, the meaning of
the expression has to be translated as a whole. Ex-
ample (3) focuses on the German idiom “auf dem
Holzweg sein” which can be translated as “being
on the wrong track”. However, a literal transla-

tion of “Holzweg” would be “wood(en) way”,
“wood(en) track” or “wood(en) patch”. As can be
seen in the example, MLLP and UCAM provide a
literal translation of the separate segments of the
MWE rather than translating the whole meaning
of it, resulting in a translation error.

(3) MWE
source: Du bist auf dem Holzweg.
MLLP: You’re on the wood track.
RWTH: You’re on the wrong track.
UCAM: You’re on the wooden path.

4.3 Linguistic phenomena

As mentioned above, a large part of the test suite
is made up of verb-related phenomena. Therefo-
re, we have conducted a more fine-grained ana-
lysis of the category “Verb tense/aspect/mood”.
In Table 4 we have grouped the phenomena by
verb tenses. Table 5 shows the results for the verb-
related phenomena grouped by verb type. Regar-
ding the verb tenses, future II and future II sub-
junctive show the lowest accuracy with a maxi-
mum accuracy of about 30%. The highest accura-
cy value on average (weighted and non-weighted)
is achieved by UCAM with 63.5%, respectively
61.5%. UCAM is the only system that is one of
the best-performing systems for all the verb tenses
as well as for all the verb types. The second-best
system on average for verb tenses and verb types
is NTT.

While the accuracy scores among the phenome-
na range between 33.4% and 63.5% for the verb
tenses, the scores for the verb types are higher with
45.7% - 86.9%.

Table 6 shows interesting individual phenome-
na with at least 15 valid test sentences. The accu-
racy for compounds and location is generally quite
high. There are other phenomena that exhibit a lar-
ger range of accuracy scores, as for example quo-
tation marks, with an accuracy ranging from 0%
to 94.7% among the systems. The system Online-
F fails on all test sentences with quotation marks.
The failure results from the system generating the
quotation marks analogously to the German punc-
tuation, e.g., introducing direct speech with a co-
lon, as seen in Example (1). Online-F furthermo-
re also fails on all test sentences with question
tags, as does NJUNMT. For the phenomenon lo-
cation, on the other hand, none of the systems is
significantly better than any other system. They all

582



perform similarly good, with an accuracy ranging
from 86.7% to 100%. RWTH is the only system
that reaches an accuracy of 100% twice in these
selected phenomena.

5 Conclusion and Further Work

We used a test suite in order to perform fine-
grained evaluation in the output of the state-of-
the-art systems, submitted at the shared task of
WMT18. One system (UCAM), that uses a syn-
tactic MBR combination of several NMT and
phrase-based SMT components, stands out regar-
ding to verb-related phenomena. Additionally, two
systems fail to translate 4 out of 10 negations. Ge-
nerally, submitted systems suffer on punctuation
(and particularly quotation marks, with the excep-
tion of Online-A), MWE, ambiguity and false fri-
ends, and also on translating the German future
tense II. 6 systems have approximately the same
performance in a big number of linguistic catego-
ries.

Fine-grained evaluation would ideally provide
the potential to identify particular flaws at the de-
velopment of the translation systems and suggest
specific modifications. Unfortunately, at the time
that this paper was written, few details about the
development characteristics of the respective sy-
stems were available, so we could provide only
few assumptions based on our findings. The dif-
ferences observed may be attributed to the design
of the models, to pre- and post-processing tools,
to the amount, the type and the filtering of the cor-
pora and other development decisions. We believe
that the findings are still useful for the original de-
velopers of the systems, since they are aware of all
their technical decisions and they have the techni-
cal possibility to better inspect the causes of spe-
cific errors.
