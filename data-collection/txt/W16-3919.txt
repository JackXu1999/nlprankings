Abstract

This paper presents the results of the Twitter Named Entity Recognition shared task associated
with W-NUT 2016: a named entity tagging task with 10 teams participating. We outline the
shared task, annotation process and dataset statistics, and provide a high-level overview of the
participating systems for each shared task.

1 Introduction

The increasing flood of user-generated text on social media has created an enormous opportunity for new
data analysis techniques to extract and aggregate information about breaking news (Ritter et al., 2012),
disease outbreaks (Paul and Dredze, 2011), natural disasters (Neubig et al., 2011), cyber-attacks (Ritter
et al., 2015) and more. Named entity recognition is an important first step in most information extraction
pipelines. However, performance of state-of-the-art NER on social media still lags behind well edited
text genres. This motivates the need for continued research, in addition to new datasets and tools adapted
to this noisy text genre.

In this paper, we present the development and evaluation of a shared task on named entity recognition
in Twitter, which was held at the 2nd Workshop on Noisy User-generated Text (W-NUT 2016) and
attracted 10 participating teams, 7 of which described their approach in peer-reviewed papers. This is
a re-run of the NER task from W-NUT 2015, with an updated test set. The new test set consists of
tweets annotated with named entities from a later time period than the data from 2015. The new test set
developed for the 2016 iteration of the task consists of 3,856 tweets; this roughly doubles the amount
of annotated data available for Twitter named entity recognition. We hope this new data will help to
advance research on named entity recognition in noisy text.

A major development as compared to 2015 is the increased use of neural network methods by partic-
ipants. Several teams, including the winning team, CambridgeLTL, used bidirectional LSTMs. Other
teams achieved competitive performance by integrating a broad range of linguistic and knowledge-based
features using conditional random fields (e.g., NTNU) or learning to search methods (Talos).

Another new development for 2016 was the inclusion of small amounts of domain-specific data into
the test set. The motivation was to test whether Twitter named entity taggers targeting general-domain
suffer a drop in performance when applied to tweets on specific types of events. For this purpose we
annotated 350 tweets related to cyber-attacks and 500 related to mass shooting events. Note that no data
from these domains was specifically included in the training or development data.

In the following sections, we describe details of the task including training and development datasets
in addition to the newly annotated test data for 2016. We briefly summarize the systems developed by
selected teams, and conclude with results.

2 Named Entity Recognition over Twitter

Named entity recognition is a crucial component in many information extraction pipelines. However,
the majority of available NER tools were developed for newswire text and these tools perform poorly
on informal text genres such as Twitter. While performance on named entity recognition in newswire is

138



quite high1 (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003), state-of-the-art performance on Twitter data lags
far behind.

The diverse and noisy style of user-generated content presents serious challenges. For instance tweets,
unlike edited newswire text, contain numerous nonstandard spellings, abbreviations, unreliable capital-
ization, etc. Because of these issues, off-the-shelf named entity recognition tools tuned for newswire
suffer a severe performance degradation when applied to noisy Twitter data. But tweets often contain
more up-to-date information than news, in addition the increased volume of text offers opportunities to
exploit redundancy of information which is very beneficial for information extraction (Downey et al.,
2005). To exploit the opportunities for information extraction on top of social media, there is a crucial
need for in-domain annotated data to train and evaluate named entity recognition systems on this noisy
style of text.

Twitter processing has the additional challenge that the language people use on Twitter changes over
time (Dredze et al., 2010; Fromreide et al., 2014). The previous edition of this task (Baldwin et al., 2015)
addressed this issue by evaluating on a test set collected from a later time period then the training and
development data. This year we take a similar approach, providing a new test dataset of tweets gathered
from 2016. In addition to enabling research on adapting named entity recognition to new language
over time, we hope this new dataset will be useful for adapting future Twitter named entity recognition
systems, improving their performance on up-to-date data.

Additionally, this year we address the issue of topic distribution by including evaluation data from
two specific domains (cybersecurity events and mass shootings) along with general domain data. Both
the time period and topic selection of the evaluation data were not announced to participants until the
(unannotated) test data was released at the beginning of the evaluation period. Teams had 7 days to
submit their results on the test data, which were subsequently scored and gold annotations were released
to participants. Evaluating the NER systems on these domains specific Twitter data provides information
about possible system weakness.

2.1 Training and Development Data
The training and development data for our task was taken from prior work on Twitter NER (Ritter et al.,
2011; Baldwin et al., 2015), which distinguishes 10 different named entity types (see Table 1 for the set
of types). The training data was created from the union of the training and development data from the
2015 task (Baldwin et al., 2015).

The data was split into 2,394 annotated tweets for training and 1,000 as a development set. We also
provided an additional 425 annotated tweets from the 2015 development data set (Baldwin et al., 2015).

2.2 Test Data Annotation
The data set we created for testing is new for this shared task. We collected general Twitter data and
domain specific Twitter data. In real world situations people want to run taggers on a specific subset
of the twitter stream. To simulate these situations we collected and tested on two example domains.
The domain specific data sets are mass shooting events and cybersecurity events. General domain test
data was randomly sampled from December 2014 through February 2015. Shooting domain data was
collected by searching for tweets that are referring to a shooting event. To collect tweets from the
mass shooting domain used www.gunviolencearchive.org’s mass shooting event database for information
about shooting events; including date, location, victim, and perpetrators of shooting events. Using this
information, we searched for tweets that occur on the same day as a mass shooting and include the key
word “shooting” and the location of the shooting event. The shooting domain contains 8,963 tokens
with 751 phrases. Computer hacking events were found by searching for tweets including the keyword
“breach”. The breach domain contains 5,537 tokens with 603 phrases.

The additional data annotated this year was completed by a single annotator instructed to follow the
annotation guidelines of the prior annotations. The annotator was presented with a set of simple guide-
lines2 that cover common ambiguous cases and was also instructed to refer to the September 2010 data

1For example, the Stanford named entity tagger (Finkel et al., 2005) achieves an F1 score of 0.86 on the CoNLL data set.

for reference (Ritter et al., 2011). The BRAT tool3 was used for annotation. Figure 1 is a screenshot of
the interface presented to the annotators. To ensure that the new annotations were consistent with the
earlier annotations, 100 tweets were annotated in both tasks to calculate agreement. The new annotator
proved a high agreement with the old data set with a F1 score of 67.67.

Table 1 presents the count of each of the 10 named entity types labeled by the annotators in the training,
development and test sets created for this shared task.

2.3 System Descriptions

This section briefly describes the approach taken by each team. Overall we noticed different trends be-
tween the types of systems submitted this year and last year. The most notable change is the use of
LSTM-based systems. Four of the seven submissions were LSTM-based as opposed to zero submis-
sions last year. The previous year Conditional Random Fields was the most popular ML technique for
extracting named entities.

CambridgeLTL (Limsopatham and Collier, 2016) The system uses bidirectional LSTM to automati-
cally induce and leverage orthographic features for performing Named Entity Recognition in Twitter
messages.

akora (Kurt Junshean Espinosa and Ananiadou, 2016) This system uses bidirectional LSTM net-
works and exploits weakly annotated data to bootstrap sparse entity types.

NTNU (Sikdar and Gambäck, 2016) This system is based on classification using Conditional Random
Fields, a supervised machine learning approach. The system utilizes a large feature set developed
specifically for the task, with eight types of features based on actual characters and token internal
data, five types of features built through context and chunk information, and five types of features
based on lexicon-type information such as stop word matching, word frequencies, and entries in the
shared task lexicon and Babelfy (Moro et al., 2014).

Talos (Ioannis Partalas and Kalitvianski, 2016) The system uses three types of features: lexical and
morpho-syntactic features, contextual enrichment features using Linked Open Data, and features
based on distributed representation of words. The system also exploits words clustering to enhance
performance. The learning algorithm was solved by using Learning to search (L2S) that resembles
a reinforcement learning algorithm.

DeepNNNER (Dugas and Nichols, 2016) The system uses a bidirectional LSTM-CNN model with
word embedding trained on a large scale Web corpus. Additionally, the system uses automati-
cally constructed lexicons with a partial matching algorithm and text normalization to handle the
large vocabulary problem in Web texts.

ASU (Michel Naim Gerguis and Gerguis, 2016) The system shows an experimental study on using
word embeddings, Brown clusters, part-of-speech tags, shape features, gazetteers, and local con-
text to create a feature representation along with a set of experiments for the network design. A
Wikipedia-based classifier framework was adopted to extract lists of fine-grained entities out of
few input examples to be used as gazetteers. The model uses the LSTM algorithm to learn a NE
classifier from the feature representation.

UQAM-NTL (Ngoc Tan LE and Sadat, 2016) The system is based on supervised machine learning
and trained with a sequential labeling algorithm, using Conditional Random Fields to learn a clas-
sifier for Twitter NE extraction. The model uses 6 different categories of features including (1)
orthographic, (2) lexical and (3) syntactic features as well as (4) part-of-speech tags, (5) polysemy
count and (6) longest n-gram length in order to create a feature representation.

3 Summary

In this paper, we presented a shared task for Named Entity Recognition in Twitter data. We detailed the
task setup and datasets used in the respective shared tasks, and also outlined the approach taken by the
participating systems. The shared task included larger data sets than prior shared task (Baldwin et al.,
2015). The evaluation data included new tweets collected from 2016. First, we are able to draw stronger
conclusions about the true potential of different approaches in the latest Twitter data. Second, through
analyzing the results of the participating systems, we are able to suggest potential research directions for
both future shared tasks and noisy text processing in general.
