Abstract
Multilingual Word Embeddings (MWEs) rep-
resent words from multiple languages in a sin-
gle distributional vector space. Unsupervised
MWE (UMWE) methods acquire multilin-
gual embeddings without cross-lingual super-
vision, which is a significant advantage over
traditional supervised approaches and opens
many new possibilities for low-resource lan-
guages. Prior art for learning UMWEs, how-
ever, merely relies on a number of indepen-
dently trained Unsupervised Bilingual Word
Embeddings (UBWEs) to obtain multilingual
embeddings. These methods fail to leverage
the interdependencies that exist among many
languages. To address this shortcoming, we
propose a fully unsupervised framework for
learning MWEs1 that directly exploits the re-
lations between all language pairs. Our model
substantially outperforms previous approaches
in the experiments on multilingual word trans-
lation and cross-lingual word similarity. In ad-
dition, our model even beats supervised ap-
proaches trained with cross-lingual resources.

1 Introduction

Continuous distributional word representa-
tions (Turian et al., 2010) have become a common
technique across a wide variety of NLP tasks.
Recent research, moreover, proposes cross-lingual
word representations (Klementiev et al., 2012;
Mikolov et al., 2013a) that create a shared em-
bedding space for words across two (Bilingual
Word Embeddings, BWE) or more languages
(Multilingual Word Embeddings, MWE). Words
from different languages with similar meanings
will be close to one another in this cross-lingual
embedding space. These embeddings have been
found beneficial for a number of cross-lingual and
even monolingual NLP tasks (Faruqui and Dyer,
2014; Ammar et al., 2016).

The most common form of cross-lingual word
representations is the BWE, which connects the
lexical semantics of two languages. Traditionally
for training BWEs, cross-lingual supervision is re-
quired, either in the form of parallel corpora (Kle-
mentiev et al., 2012; Zou et al., 2013), or in the
form of bilingual lexica (Mikolov et al., 2013a;
Xing et al., 2015). This makes learning BWEs
for low-resource language pairs much more dif-
ficult. Fortunately, there are attempts to reduce
the dependence on bilingual supervision by requir-
ing a very small parallel lexicon such as identi-
cal character strings (Smith et al., 2017), or nu-
merals (Artetxe et al., 2017). Furthermore, re-
cent work proposes approaches to obtain unsuper-
vised BWEs without relying on any bilingual re-
sources (Zhang et al., 2017; Lample et al., 2018b).

In contrast to BWEs that only focus on a pair
of languages, MWEs instead strive to leverage the
interdependencies among multiple languages to
learn a multilingual embedding space. MWEs are
desirable when dealing with multiple languages
simultaneously and have also been shown to im-
prove the performance on some bilingual tasks
thanks to its ability to acquire knowledge from
other languages (Ammar et al., 2016; Duong et al.,
2017). Similar to training BWEs, cross-lingual su-
pervision is typically needed for training MWEs,
and the prior art for obtaining fully unsupervised
MWEs simply maps all the languages indepen-
dently to the embedding space of a chosen tar-
get language2 (usually English) (Lample et al.,
2018b). There are downsides, however, when us-
ing a single fixed target language with no interac-
tion between any of the two source languages. For
instance, French and Italian are very similar, and
the fact that each of them is individually converted
to a less similar language, English for example, in

2Henceforth, we refer to this method as BWE-Pivot as the
target language serves as a pivot to connect other languages.

order to produce a shared embedding space will
inevitably degrade the quality of the MWEs.

For certain multilingual tasks such as translat-
ing between any pair of N given languages, an-
other option for obtaining UMWEs exists. One
can directly train UBWEs for each of such lan-
guage pairs (referred to as BWE-Direct). This is
seldom used in practice, since it requires training
O(N2) BWE models as opposed to only O(N)
in BWE-Pivot, and is too expensive for most use
cases. Moreover, this method still does not fully
exploit the language interdependence. For exam-
ple, when learning embeddings between French
and Italian, BWE-Direct only utilizes information
from the pair itself, but other Romance languages
such as Spanish may also provide valuable infor-
mation that could improve performance.

In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised
algorithm to train MWEs using only monolingual
corpora (or equivalently, monolingual word em-
beddings). Our method exploits the interdepen-
dencies between any two languages and maps all
monolingual embeddings into a shared multilin-
gual embedding space via a two-stage algorithm
consisting of (i) Multilingual Adversarial Training
(MAT) and (ii) Multilingual Pseudo-Supervised
Refinement (MPSR). As shown by experimental
results on multilingual word translation and cross-
lingual word similarity, our model is as efficient
as BWE-Pivot yet outperforms both BWE-Pivot
and BWE-Direct despite the latter being much
more expensive. In addition, our model achieves
a higher overall performance than state-of-the-art
supervised methods in these experiments.

2 Related Work

There is a plethora of literature on learning cross-
lingual word representations, focusing either on
a pair of languages, or multiple languages at the
same time (Klementiev et al., 2012; Zou et al.,
2013; Mikolov et al., 2013a; Gouws et al., 2015;
Coulmance et al., 2015; Ammar et al., 2016;
Duong et al., 2017, inter alia). One shortcom-
ing of these methods is the dependence on cross-
lingual supervision such as parallel corpora or
bilingual lexica. Abundant research efforts have
been made to alleviate such dependence (Vulić and
Moens, 2015; Artetxe et al., 2017; Smith et al.,
2017), but consider only the case of a single pair
of languages (BWEs). Furthermore, fully unsu-
pervised methods exist for learning BWEs (Zhang

et al., 2017; Lample et al., 2018b; Artetxe et al.,
2018a). For unsupervised MWEs, however, pre-
vious methods merely rely on a number of inde-
pendent BWEs to separately map each language
into the embedding space of a chosen target lan-
guage (Smith et al., 2017; Lample et al., 2018b).

Adversarial Neural Networks have been suc-
cessfully applied to various cross-lingual NLP
tasks where annotated data is not available, such as
cross-lingual text classification (Chen et al., 2016),
unsupervised BWE induction (Zhang et al., 2017;
Lample et al., 2018b) and unsupervised machine
translation (Lample et al., 2018a; Artetxe et al.,
2018b). These works, however, only consider the
case of two languages, and our MAT method (§3.1)
is a generalization to multiple languages.

Mikolov et al. (2013a) first propose to learn
cross-lingual word representations by learning a
linear mapping between the monolingual embed-
ding spaces of a pair of languages. It has then
been observed that enforcing the linear mapping
to be orthogonal could significantly improve per-
formance (Xing et al., 2015; Artetxe et al., 2016;
Smith et al., 2017). These methods solve a linear
equation called the orthogonal Procrustes prob-
lem for the optimal orthogonal linear mapping be-
tween two languages, given a set of word pairs as
supervision. Artetxe et al. (2017) find that when
using weak supervision (e.g. digits in both lan-
guages), applying this Procrustes process itera-
tively achieves higher performance. Lample et al.
(2018b) adopt the iterative Procrustes method with
pseudo-supervision in a fully unsupervised setting
and also obtain good results. In the MWE task,
however, the multilingual mappings no longer
have a closed-form solution, and we hence pro-
pose the MPSR algorithm (§3.2) for learning mul-
tilingual embeddings using gradient-based opti-
mization methods.

3 Model

In this work, our goal is to learn a single multi-
lingual embedding space for N languages, with-
out relying on any cross-lingual supervision. We
assume that we have access to monolingual em-
beddings for each of the N languages, which
can be obtained using unlabeled monolingual cor-
pora (Mikolov et al., 2013b; Bojanowski et al.,
2017). We now present our unsupervised MWE
(UMWE) model that jointly maps the monolin-
gual embeddings of all N languages into a single



263

space by explicitly leveraging the interdependen-
cies between arbitrary language pairs, but is com-
putationally as efficient as learning O(N) BWEs
(instead of O(N2)).

Denote the set of languages as L with |L | =
N . Suppose for each language l ∈ L with vocab-
ulary Vl, we have a set of d-dimensional mono-
lingual word embeddings El of size |Vl| × d. Let
Sl denote the monolingual embedding space for
l, namely the distribution of the monolingual em-
beddings of l. If a set of embeddings E are in
an embedding space S, we write E ` S (e.g.
∀l : El ` Sl). Our models learns a set of encoders
Ml, one for each language l, and the correspond-
ing decodersM−1l . The encoders map all El to a
single target space T : Ml(El) ` T . On the other
hand, a decoder M−1l maps an embedding in T
back to Sl.

Previous research (Mikolov et al., 2013a) shows
that there is a strong linear correlation between
the vector spaces of two languages, and that learn-
ing a complex non-linear neural mapping does not
yield better results. Xing et al. (2015) further show
that enforcing the linear mappings to be orthogo-
nal matrices achieves higher performance. There-
fore, we let our encodersMl be orthogonal linear
matrices, and the corresponding decoders can be
obtained by simply taking the transpose: M−1l =
M>l . Thus, applying the encoder or decoder to an
embedding vector is accomplished by multiplying
the vector with the encoder/decoder matrix.

Another benefit of using linear encoders and de-
coders (also referred to as mappings) is that we can
learn N − 1 mappings instead of N by choosing
the target space T to be the embedding space of a
specific language (denoted as the target language)
without losing any expressiveness of the model.
Given a MWE with an arbitrary T , we can con-
struct an equivalent one with onlyN−1 mappings
by multiplying the encoders of each languageMl
to the decoder of the chosen target languageM>t :

M′t =M>t Mt = I
M′lEl = (M>t Ml)El ` St

where I is the identity matrix. The new MWE is
isomorphic to the original one.

We now present the two major components of
our approach, Multilingual Adversarial Training
(§3.1) and Multilingual Pseudo-Supervised Re-
finement (§3.2).

3.1 Multilingual Adversarial Training
In this section, we introduce an adversarial train-
ing approach for learning multilingual embed-
dings without cross-lingual supervision. Adver-
sarial Training is a powerful technique for min-
imizing the divergence between complex distri-
butions that are otherwise difficult to directly
model (Goodfellow et al., 2014). In the cross-
lingual setting, it has been successfully ap-
plied to unsupervised cross-lingual text classifica-
tion (Chen et al., 2016) and unsupervised bilin-
gual word embedding learning (Zhang et al., 2017;
Lample et al., 2018b). However, these methods
only consider one pair of languages at a time, and
do not fully exploit the cross-lingual relations in
the multilingual setting.

Figure 1 shows our Multilingual Adversarial
Training (MAT) model and the training procedure
is described in Algorithm 1. Note that as ex-
plained in §3, the encoders and decoders adopted
in practice are orthogonal linear mappings while
the shared embedding space is chosen to be the
same space as a selected target language.

In order to learn a multilingual embedding
space without supervision, we employ a series
of language discriminators Dl, one for each lan-
guage l ∈ L . Each Dl is a binary classifier with
a sigmoid layer on top, and is trained to identify
how likely a given vector is from Sl, the embed-
ding space of language l. On the other hand, to
train the mappings, we convert a vector from a ran-
dom language langi to another random language
langj (via the target space T first). The objective
of the mappings is to confuseDj , the language dis-
criminator for langj , so the mappings are updated
in a way thatDj cannot differentiate the converted
vectors from the real vectors in Sj . This multilin-
gual objective enables us to explicitly exploit the
relations between all language pairs during train-
ing, leading to improved performance.

Formally, for any language langj , the objective
that Dj is minimizing is:

JDj = E
i∼L

E
xi∼Si
xj∼Sj

r
Ld (1,Dj(xj))+

Ld

(
0,Dj(M>jMixi)

)z (1)
where Ld(y, ŷ) is the loss function of D, which
is chosen as the cross entropy loss in practice. y
is the language label with y = 1 indicates a real

embedding from that language.
Furthermore, the objective ofMi for langi is:

JMi = E
j∼L

E
xi∼Si
xj∼Sj

Ld

(
1,Dj(M>jMixi)

)
(2)

whereMi strives to make Dj believe that a con-
verted vector to langj is instead real. This adver-
sarial relation between M and D stimulates M
to learn a shared multilingual embedding space by
making the converted vectors look as authentic as
possible so that D cannot predict whether a vector
is a genuine embedding from a certain language or
converted from another language viaM.

In addition, we allow langi and langj to be
the same language in (1) and (2). In this case,
we are encoding a language to T and back to
itself, essentially forming an adversarial autoen-
coder (Makhzani et al., 2015), which is reported
to improve the model performance (Zhang et al.,
2017). Finally, on Line 5 and 17 in Algorithm 1, a
for loop is used instead of random sampling. This
is to ensure that in each step, every discrimina-
tor (or mapping) is getting updated at least once,
so that we do not need to increase the number of
training iterations when adding more languages.
Computationally, when compared to the BWE-
Pivot and BWE-Direct baselines, one step of MAT
training costs similarly to N BWE training steps,
and in practice we train MAT for the same num-
ber of iterations as training the baselines. There-
fore, MAT training scales linearly with the num-
ber of languages similar to BWE-Pivot (instead of
quadratically as in BWE-Direct).

3.2 Multilingual Pseudo-Supervised
Refinement

Using MAT, we are able to obtain UMWEs with
reasonable quality, but they do not yet achieve
state-of-the-art performance. Previous research
on learning unsupervised BWEs (Lample et al.,
2018b) observes that the embeddings obtained
from adversarial training do a good job aligning
the frequent words between two languages, but
performance degrades when considering the full
vocabulary. They hence propose to use an iter-
ative refinement method (Artetxe et al., 2017) to
repeatedly refine the embeddings obtained from
the adversarial training. The idea is that we can
anchor on the more accurately predicted relations
between frequent words to improve the mappings
learned by adversarial training.

11: until convergence

When learning MWEs, however, it is desirable
to go beyond aligning each language with the tar-
get space individually, and instead utilize the re-
lations between all languages as we did in MAT.
Therefore, we in this section propose a general-
ization of the existing refinement methods to in-
corporate a multilingual objective.

In particular, MAT can produce an approxi-
mately aligned embedding space. As mentioned
earlier, however, the training signals from D for
rare words are noisier and may lead to worse
performance. Thus, the idea of Multilingual
Pseudo-Supervised Refinement (MPSR) is to in-
duce a dictionary of highly confident word pairs
for every language pair, used as pseudo supervi-
sion to improve the embeddings learned by MAT.
For a specific language pair (langi, langj), the
pseudo-supervised lexicon Lex(langi, langj) is
constructed from mutual nearest neighbors be-
tweenMiEi andMjEj , among the most frequent
15k words of both languages.

With the constructed lexica, the MPSR objective
is:

Jr = E
(i,j)∼L 2

E
(xi,xj)∼Lex(i,j)

Lr(Mixi,Mjxj)
(3)

where Lr(x, x̂) is the loss function for MPSR, for
which we use the mean square loss. The MPSR
training is depicted in Algorithm 2.

Cross-Lingual Similarity Scaling (CSLS)
When constructing the pseudo-supervised lexica,
a distance metric between embeddings is needed
to compute nearest neighbors. Standard distance
metrics such as the Euclidean distance or cosine
similarity, however, can lead to the hubness
problem in high-dimensional spaces when used
to calculate nearest neighbors (Radovanović

et al., 2010; Dinu and Baroni, 2015). Namely,
some words are very likely to be the nearest
neighbors of many others (hubs), while others
are not the nearest neighbor of any word. This
problem is addressed in the literature by designing
alternative distance metrics, such as the inverted
softmax (Smith et al., 2017) or the CSLS (Lample
et al., 2018b). In this work, we adopt the CSLS
similarity as a drop-in replacement for cosine
similarity whenever a distance metric is needed.
The CSLS similarity (whose negation is a distance
metric) is calculated as follows:

CSLS(x, y) = 2 cos(x, y)

− 1
n

∑
y′∈NY (x)

cos(x, y′)

− 1
n

∑
x′∈NX(y)

cos(x′, y)

(4)

where NY (x) is the set of n nearest neighbors of
x in the vector space that y comes from: Y =
{y1, ..., y|Y |}, and vice versa for NX(y). In prac-
tice, we use n = 10.

3.3 Orthogonalization
As mentioned in §3, orthogonal linear mappings
are the preferred choice when learning transforma-
tions between the embedding spaces of different
languages (Xing et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2017).
Therefore, we perform an orthogonalization up-
date (Cisse et al., 2017) after each training step to
ensure that our mappingsM are (approximately)
orthogonal:

∀l :Ml = (1 + β)Ml − βMlM>l Ml

where β is set to 0.001.

3.4 Unsupervised Multilingual Validation
In order to do model selection in the unsupervised
setting, where no validation set can be used, a sur-
rogate validation criterion is required that does not
depend on bilingual data. Previous work shows
promising results using such surrogate criteria for
model validation in the bilingual case (Lample
et al., 2018b), and we in this work adopt a vari-
ant adapted to our multilingual setting:

V (M, E) = E
(i,j)∼Pij

mean csls(M>jMiEi, Ej)

=
∑
i 6=j

pij · mean csls(M>jMiEi, Ej)



266

where pij forms a probability simplex. In this
work, we let all pij = 1N(N−1) so that V (M, E)
reduces to the macro average over all language
pairs. Using different pij values can place varying
weights on different language pairs, which might
be desirable in certain scenarios.

The mean csls function is an unsupervised
bilingual validation criterion proposed by Lample
et al. (2018b), which is the mean CSLS similari-
ties between the most frequent 10k words and their
translations (nearest neighbors).

4 Experiments

In this section, we present experimental results to
demonstrate the effectiveness of our unsupervised
MWE method on two benchmark tasks, the mul-
tilingual word translation task, and the SemEval-
2017 cross-lingual word similarity task. We com-
pare our MAT+MPSR method with state-of-the-
art unsupervised and supervised approaches, and
show that ours outperforms previous methods, su-
pervised or not, on both tasks.

Pre-trained 300d fastText (monolingual) em-
beddings (Bojanowski et al., 2017) trained on the
Wikipedia corpus are used for all systems that re-
quire monolingual word embeddings for learning
cross-lingual embeddings.

4.1 Multilingual Word Translation

In this section, we consider the task of word trans-
lation between arbitrary pairs of a set of N lan-
guages. To this end, we use the recently released
multilingual word translation dataset on six lan-
guages: English, French, German, Italian, Por-
tuguese and Spanish (Lample et al., 2018b). For
any pair of the six languages, a ground-truth bilin-
gual dictionary is provided with a train-test split
of 5000 and 1500 unique source words, respec-
tively. The 5k training pairs are used in training
supervised baseline methods, while all unsuper-
vised methods do not rely on any cross-lingual re-
sources. All systems are tested on the 1500 test
word pairs for each pair of languages.

For comparison, we adopted a state-of-the-art
unsupervised BWE method (Lample et al., 2018b)
and generalize it for the multilingual setting us-
ing the two aforementioned approaches, namely
BWE-Pivot and BWE-Direct, to produce unsuper-
vised baseline MWE systems. English is cho-
sen as the pivot language in BWE-Pivot. We fur-
ther incorporate the supervised BWE-Direct (Sup-

BWE-Direct) method as a baseline, where each
BWE is trained on the 5k gold-standard word pairs
via the orthogonal Procrustes process (Artetxe
et al., 2017; Lample et al., 2018b).

Table 1 presents the evaluation results, wherein
the numbers represent precision@1, namely how
many times one of the correct translations of a
source word is retrieved as the top candidate. All
systems retrieve word translations using the CSLS
similarity in the learned embedding space. Ta-
ble 1a shows the detailed results for all 30 lan-
guage pairs, while Table 1b summarizes the re-
sults in a number of ways. We first observe the
training cost of all systems summarized in Ta-
ble 1b. #BWEs indicates the training cost of a cer-
tain method measured by how many BWE mod-
els it is equivalent to train. BWE-Pivot needs
to train 2(N−1) BWEs since a separate BWE is
trained for each direction in a language pair for
increased performance. BWE-Direct on the other
hand, trains an individual BWE for all (again, di-
rected) pairs, resulting a total of N(N−1) BWEs.
The supervised Sup-BWE-Direct method trains
the same number of BWEs as BWE-Direct but is
much faster in practice, for it does not require the
unsupervised adversarial training stage. Finally,
while our MAT+MPSR method does not train in-
dependent BWEs, as argued in §3.1, the training
cost is roughly equivalent to trainingN−1 BWEs,
which is corroborated by the real training time
shown in Table 1b.

We can see in Table 1a that our MAT+MPSR
method achieves the highest performance on all
but 3 language pairs, compared against both the
unsupervised and supervised approaches. When
looking at the overall performance across all lan-
guage pairs, BWE-Direct achieves a +0.6% per-
formance gain over BWE-Pivot at the cost of be-
ing much slower to train. When supervision is
available, Sup-BWE-Direct further improves an-
other 0.4% over BWE-Direct. Our MAT+MPSR
method, however, attains an impressive 1.3% im-
provement against Sup-BWE-Direct, despite the
lack of cross-lingual supervision.

To provide a more in-depth examination of the
results, we first consider the Romance language
pairs, such as fr-es, fr-it, fr-pt, es-it, it-pt and their
reverse directions. BWE-Pivot performs notably
worse than BWE-Direct on these pairs, which vali-
dates our hypothesis that going through a less sim-
ilar language (English) when translating between

similar languages will result in reduced accuracy.
Our MAT+MPSR method, however, overcomes this
disadvantage of BWE-Pivot and achieves the best
performance on all these pairs through an explicit
multilingual learning mechanism without increas-
ing the computational cost.

Furthermore, our method also beats the BWE-
Direct approach, which supports our second hy-
pothesis that utilizing knowledge from languages
beyond the pair itself could improve performance.
For instance, there are a few pairs where BWE-
Pivot outperforms BWE-Direct, such as de-it, it-
de and pt-de, even though it goes through a third
language (English) in BWE-Pivot. This might
suggest that for some less similar language pairs,
leveraging a third language as a bridge could in
some cases work better than only relying on the
language pair itself. German is involved in all

these language pairs where BWE-Pivot outper-
forms than BWE-Direct, which is potentially due
to the similarity between German and the pivot
language English. We speculate that if choosing
a different pivot language, there might be other
pairs that could benefit. This observation serves
as a possible explanation of the superior perfor-
mance of our multilingual method over BWE-
Direct, since our method utilizes knowledge from
all languages during training.

4.2 Cross-Lingual Word Similarity
In this section, we evaluate the quality of
our MWEs on the cross-lingual word similarity
(CLWS) task, which assesses how well the sim-
ilarity in the cross-lingual embedding space cor-
responds to a human-annotated semantic similar-
ity score. The high-quality CLWS dataset from
SemEval-2017 (Camacho-Collados et al., 2017) is

used for evaluation. The dataset contains word
pairs from any two of the five languages: English,
German, Spanish, Italian, and Farsi (Persian), an-
notated with semantic similarity scores.

In addition to the BWE-Pivot and BWE-
Direct baseline methods, we also include the
two best-performing systems on SemEval-2017,
Luminoso (Speer and Lowry-Duda, 2017) and
NASARI (Camacho-Collados et al., 2016) for
comparison. Note that these two methods are su-
pervised, and have access to the Europarl3 (for all
languages but Farsi) and the OpenSubtitles20164

parallel corpora.
Table 2 shows the results, where the perfor-

mance of each model is measured by the Spear-
man correlation. When compared to the BWE-
Pivot and the BWE-Direct baselines, MAT+MPSR
continues to perform the best on all language pairs.
The qualitative findings stay the same as in the
word translation task, except the margin is less sig-
nificant. This might be because the CLWS task is
much more lenient compared to the word transla-
tion task, where in the latter one needs to correctly
identify the translation of a word out of hundreds
of thousands of words in the vocabulary. In CLWS
though, one can still achieve relatively high corre-
lation in spite of minor inaccuracies.

On the other hand, an encouraging result is
that when compared to the state-of-the-art super-
vised results, our MAT+MPSRmethod outperforms
NASARI by a very large margin, and achieves
top-notch overall performance similar to the com-
petition winner, Luminoso, without using any bi-
texts. A closer examination reveals that our unsu-
pervised method lags a few points behind Lumi-

noso on the European languages wherein the su-
pervised methods have access to the large-scale
high-quality Europarl parallel corpora. It is the
low-resource language, Farsi, that makes our un-
supervised method stand out. All of the unsuper-
vised methods outperform the supervised systems
from SemEval-2017 on language pairs involving
Farsi, which is not covered by the Europarl bitexts.
This suggests the advantage of learning unsuper-
vised embeddings for lower-resourced languages,
where the supervision might be noisy or absent.
Furthermore, within the unsupervised methods,
MAT+MPSR again performs the best, and attains
a higher margin over the baseline approaches on
the low-resource language pairs, vindicating our
claim of better multilingual performance.

5 Conclusion

In this work, we propose a fully unsupervised
model for learning multilingual word embeddings
(MWEs). Although methods exist for learning
high-quality unsupervised BWEs (Lample et al.,
2018b), little work has been done in the unsuper-
vised multilingual setting. Previous work relies
solely on a number of unsupervised BWE models
to generate MWEs (e.g. BWE-Pivot and BWE-
Direct), which does not fully leverage the interde-
pendencies among all the languages. Therefore,
we propose the MAT+MPSR method that explicitly
exploits the relations between all language pairs
without increasing the computational cost. In our
experiments on multilingual word translation and
cross-lingual word similarity (SemEval-2017), we
show that MAT+MPSR outperforms existing unsu-
pervised and even supervised models, achieving
new state-of-the-art performance.

For future work, we plan to investigate how our

method can be extended to work with other BWE
frameworks, in order to overcome the instability
issue of Lample et al. (2018b). As pointed out by
recent work (Søgaard et al., 2018; Artetxe et al.,
2018a), the method by Lample et al. (2018b) per-
forms much worse on certain languages such as
Finnish, etc. More reliable multilingual embed-
dings might be obtained on these languages if we
adapt our multilingual training framework to work
with the more robust methods proposed recently.
