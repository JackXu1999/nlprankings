Abstract

This paper summarises the experimental
setup and results of the first shared task
on end-to-end (E2E) natural language gen-
eration (NLG) in spoken dialogue sys-
tems. Recent end-to-end generation sys-
tems are promising since they reduce the
need for data annotation. However, they
are currently limited to small, delexi-
calised datasets. The E2E NLG shared
task aims to assess whether these novel ap-
proaches can generate better-quality out-
put by learning from a dataset contain-
ing higher lexical richness, syntactic com-
plexity and diverse discourse phenom-
ena. We compare 62 systems submitted
by 17 institutions, covering a wide range
of approaches, including machine learn-
ing architectures – with the majority im-
plementing sequence-to-sequence models
(seq2seq) – as well as systems based on
grammatical rules and templates.

1 Introduction

This paper summarises the first shared task
on end-to-end (E2E) natural language genera-
tion (NLG) in spoken dialogue systems (SDSs).
Shared tasks have become an established way of
pushing research boundaries in the field of nat-
ural language processing, with NLG benchmark-
ing tasks running since 2007 (Belz and Gatt,
2007). This task is novel in that it poses new
challenges for recent end-to-end, data-driven NLG
systems for SDSs which jointly learn sentence
planning and surface realisation and do not re-
quire costly semantic alignment between mean-
ing representations (MRs) and the corresponding
natural language reference texts, e.g. (Dušek and
Jurčı́ček, 2015; Wen et al., 2015b; Mei et al.,

2016; Wen et al., 2016; Sharma et al., 2016; Dušek
and Jurčı́ček, 2016a; Lampouras and Vlachos,
2016).1 So far, end-to-end approaches to NLG
are limited to small, delexicalised datasets, e.g.
BAGEL (Mairesse et al., 2010), SF Hotels/Restau-
rants (Wen et al., 2015b), or RoboCup (Chen and
Mooney, 2008), whereas the E2E shared task is
based on a new crowdsourced dataset of 50k in-
stances in the restaurant domain, which is about
10 times larger and also more complex than pre-
vious datasets. For the shared challenge, we re-
ceived 62 system submissions by 17 institutions
from 11 countries, with about 1/3 of these sub-
missions coming from industry. We assess the
submitted systems by comparing them to a chal-
lenging baseline using automatic as well as human
evaluation. We consider this level of participa-
tion an unexpected success, which underlines the
timeliness of this task.2 While there are previous
studies comparing a limited number of end-to-end
NLG approaches (Novikova et al., 2017a; Wise-
man et al., 2017; Gardent et al., 2017), this is the
first research to evaluate novel end-to-end genera-
tion at scale and using human assessment.

2 The E2E NLG dataset

2.1 Data Collection Procedure

In order to maximise the chances for data-driven
end-to-end systems to produce high quality out-
put, we aim to provide training data in high quality
and large quantity. To collect data in large enough
quantity, we use crowdsourcing with automatic

1Note that as opposed to the “classical” definition of NLG
(Reiter and Dale, 2000; Gatt and Krahmer, 2018), generation
for dialogue systems does not involve content selection and
its sentence planning stage may be less complex.

2In comparison, the well established Conference in Ma-
chine Translation WMT’17 (running since 2006) received
submissions from 31 institutions to a total of 8 tasks (Bojar
et al., 2017a).

quality checks. We use MRs consisting of an un-
ordered set of attributes and their values and col-
lect multiple corresponding natural language texts
(references) – utterances consisting of one or sev-
eral sentences. An example MR-reference pair is
shown in Figure 1, Table 1 lists all the attributes in
our domain.

In contrast to previous work (Mairesse et al.,
2010; Wen et al., 2015a; Dušek and Jurčı́ček,
2016), we use different modalities of meaning rep-
resentation for data collection: textual/logical and
pictorial MRs. The textual/logical MRs (see Fig-
ure 1) take the form of a sequence with attribute-
value pairs provided in a random order. The pic-
torial MRs (see Figure 2) are semi-automatically
generated pictures with a combination of icons
corresponding to the appropriate attributes. The
icons are located on a background showing a map
of a city, thus allowing to represent the meaning of
attributes area and near (cf. Table 1).

In a pre-study (Novikova et al., 2016), we
showed that pictorial MRs provide similar col-
lection speed and utterance length, but are less
likely to prime the crowd workers in their lexi-
cal choices. Utterances produced using pictorial
MRs were considered to be more informative, nat-
ural and better phrased. However, while pictorial
MRs provide more variety in the utterances, this
also introduces noise. Therefore, we decided to
use pictorial MRs to collect 20% of the dataset.

Our crowd workers were asked to verbalise all
information from the MR; however, they were not

penalised for skipping an attribute. This makes the
dataset more challenging, as NLG systems need to
account for noise in training data. On the other
hand, the systems are helped by having multiple
human references per MR at their disposal.

2.2 Data Statistics

The resulting dataset (Novikova et al., 2017b) con-
tains over 50k references for 6k distinct MRs (cf.
Table 2), which is 10 times bigger than previ-
ous sets in comparable domains (BAGEL, SF Ho-
tels/Restaurants, RoboCup). The dataset contains
more human references per MR (8.27 on average),
which should make it more suitable for data-driven
approaches. However, it is also more challenging
as it uses a larger number of sentences in refer-
ences (up to 6 compared to 1–2 in other sets) and
more attributes in MRs.

For the E2E challenge, we split the data into
training, development and test sets (in a roughly
82-9-9 ratio). MRs in the test set are all previously
unseen, i.e. none of them overlaps with train-
ing/development sets, even if restaurant names are
removed. MRs for the test set were only released
to participants two weeks before the challenge
submission deadline on October 31, 2017. Par-
ticipants had no access to test reference texts. The
whole dataset is now freely available at the E2E
NLG Challenge website at:

System architectures are coded with colours and symbols: ♥seq2seq, ♦other data-driven, ♣rule-based, ♠template-based. Un-
less noted otherwise, all data-driven systems use partial delexicalisation (with name and near attributes replaced by placeholders
during generation), template- and rule-based systems delexicalise all attributes. In addition to word-overlap metrics (see Sec-
tion 4.1), we show the average of all metrics’ values normalised into the 0-1 range, and use this to sort the list. Any values
higher than the baseline are marked in bold.

3 Systems in the Competition

The interest in the E2E Challenge has by far ex-
ceeded our expectations. We received a total of
62 submitted systems by 17 institutions (about 1/3
from industry). In accordance with ethical con-
siderations for NLP shared tasks (Parra Escartı́n
et al., 2017), we allowed researchers to withdraw
or anonymise their results if their system performs
in the lower 50% of submissions. Two groups
from industry withdrew their submissions and one
group asked to be anonymised after obtaining au-
tomatic evaluation results.

We asked each of the remaining teams to iden-
tify 1-2 primary systems, which resulted in 20 sys-
tems by 14 groups. Each primary system is de-
scribed in a short technical paper (available on
the challenge website) and was evaluated both by
automatic metrics and human judges (see Sec-

tion 4). We compare the primary systems to a
baseline based on the TGEN generator (Dušek and
Jurčı́ček, 2016a). An overview of all primary sys-
tems is given in Table 3, including the main fea-
tures of their architectures. A more detailed de-
scription and comparison of systems will be given
in (Dušek et al., 2018).

4 Evaluation Results

4.1 Word-overlap Metrics
Following previous shared tasks in related fields
(Bojar et al., 2017b; Chen et al., 2015), we se-
lected a range of metrics measuring word-overlap
between system output and references, including
BLEU, NIST, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and CIDEr.
Table 3 summarises the primary system scores.
The TGEN baseline is very strong in terms of
word-overlap metrics: No primary system is able

comes very close. Several other systems beat
TGEN in one of the metrics but not in others.3

Overall, seq2seq-based systems show the best
word-based metric values, followed by SHEFF1,
a data-driven system based on imitation learning.
Template-based and rule-based systems mostly
score at the bottom of the list.

4.2 Results of Human Evaluation

However, the human evaluation study provides a
different picture. Rank-based Magnitude Estima-
tion (RankME) (Novikova et al., 2018) was used
for evaluation, where crowd workers compared
outputs of 5 systems for the same MR and as-
signed scores on a continuous scale. We evaluated
output naturalness and overall quality in separate
tasks; for naturalness evaluation, the source MR
was not shown to workers. We collected 4,239 5-
way rankings for naturalness and 2,979 for quality,
comparing 9.5 systems per MR on average.

The final evaluation results were produced us-
ing the TrueSkill algorithm (Herbrich et al., 2006;
Sakaguchi et al., 2014), with partial ordering into
significance clusters computed using bootstrap re-
sampling (Bojar et al., 2013, 2014; Sakaguchi
et al., 2014). For both criteria, this resulted in 5

sions perform better than the primary ones (and the baseline)
with respect to word-overlap metrics.

clusters of systems with significantly different per-
formance and showed a clear winner: SHEFF2 for
naturalness and SLUG for quality. The 2nd clus-
ters are quite large for both criteria – they contain
13 and 11 systems, respectively, and both include
the baseline TGEN system.

The results indicate that seq2seq systems domi-
nate in terms of naturalness of their outputs, while
most systems of other architectures score lower.
The bottom cluster is filled with template-based
systems. The results for quality are, however,
more mixed in terms of architectures, with none
of them clearly prevailing. Here, seq2seq systems
with reranking based on checking output correct-
ness score high while seq2seq systems with no
such mechanism occupy the bottom two clusters.

5 Conclusion

This paper presents the first shared task on end-to-
end NLG. The aim of this challenge was to assess
the capabilities of recent end-to-end, fully data-
driven NLG systems, which can be trained from
pairs of input MRs and texts, without the need for
fine-grained semantic alignments. We created a
novel dataset for the challenge, which is an order-
of-magnitude bigger than any previous publicly
available dataset for task-oriented NLG. We re-
ceived 62 system submissions by 17 participating
institutions, with a wide range of architectures,
from seq2seq-based models to simple templates.



326

We evaluated all the entries in terms of five differ-
ent automatic metrics; 20 primary submissions (as
identified by the 14 remaining participants) under-
went crowdsourced human evaluation of natural-
ness and overall quality of their outputs.

We consider the SLUG system (Juraska et al.,
2018), a seq2seq-based ensemble system with a
reranker, as the overall winner of the E2E NLG
challenge. SLUG scores best in human evalua-
tions of quality, it is placed in the 2nd-best clus-
ter of systems in terms of naturalness and reaches
high automatic scores. While the SHEFF2 sys-
tem (Chen et al., 2018), a vanilla seq2seq setup,
won in terms of naturalness, it scores poorly on
overall quality – it placed in the last cluster. The
TGEN baseline system turned out hard to beat: It
ranked highest on average in word-overlap-based
automatic metrics and placed in the 2nd cluster in
both quality and naturalness.

The results in general show the seq2seq archi-
tecture as very capable, but requiring reranking
to reach high-quality results. On the other hand,
while rule-based approaches are not able to beat
data-driven systems in terms of automatic metrics,
they often perform comparably or better in human
evaluations.

We are preparing a detailed analysis of the re-
sults (Dušek et al., 2018) and a release of all sys-
tem outputs with user ratings on the challenge
website.4 We plan to use this data for experiments
in automatic NLG output quality estimation (Spe-
cia et al., 2010; Dušek et al., 2017), where the
large amount of data obtained in this challenge al-
lows a wider range of experiments than previously
possible.
