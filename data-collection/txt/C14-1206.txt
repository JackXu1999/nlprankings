Abstract
This paper presents a knowledge base containing triples involving pairs of verbs associated with
semantic or discourse relations. The relations in these triples are marked by discourse connectors
between two adjacent instances of the verbs in the triple in the large French corpus, frWaC.
We detail several measures that evaluate the relevance of the triples and the strength of their
association. We use manual annotations to evaluate our method, and also study the coverage of
our resource with respect to the discourse annotated corpus Annodis. Our positive results show
the potential impact of our resource for discourse analysis tasks as well as other semantically
oriented tasks like temporal and causal information extraction.

1 Introduction

Relational lexical resources, which describe semantic relations between lexical items, have tradition-
ally focused on relations like synonymy or similarity in thesauri, perhaps including some hierarchical
semantic relations like hyperonymy or hyponomy or part-whole relations as in the resource Wordnet (Fel-
baum, 1998). Some distributional thesauri contain more varied relations, see e.g. (Grefenstette, 1994),
however these relations are not typed. The lexical semantics given by FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) does
include causal and temporal relations, as does Verbocean (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004), but coverage is
limited and empirical validation of these resources is partial and still largely remains to be done.

Lexical relations, in particular between verbs, are nevertheless crucial for understanding natural lan-
guage and for many information processing tasks. They are needed for textual inference, in which one
has to infer certain relations between eventualities (Hashimoto et al., 2009; Tremper and Frank, 2013),
for information extraction tasks, like finding temporal relations between eventualities mentioned in a text
(UzZaman et al., 2013), for automatic summarization (Liu et al., 2007), and for discourse parsing in the
absence of explicit discourse markers (Sporleder and Lascarides, 2008).

In this paper we report on our efforts to extract semantic relations essential to the analysis of discourse
and its interpretation, in which links are made between units of text or rather their semantic representa-
tions as in (1) in virtue of semantic information about the two main verbs of those clauses.

We follow similar work on the extraction of causal, temporal, entailment and presuppositional relations
from corpora (Do et al., 2011; Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008; Hashimoto et al., 2009; Tremper and Frank,
2013), though our goals and validation methods are different. While one of our goals is to use this
information to improve performance in predicting discourse relations between clauses, we believe that
such a lexical resource will have other uses in other tasks in which semantic information is needed.

Discourse analysis is a difficult task. Rhetorical relations are frequently implicit and require for their
identification inference using diverse sources of lexical and compositional semantic information. In the
Penn Discourse Treebank corpus for example, 52% of the discourse relations are unmarked (Prasad et

al., 2008). Accordingly, annotation with discourse structure is a slow and error prone task, and relatively
little annotated data is currently available ; and so machine learning approaches have had limited suc-
cess in this area. Our approach addresses this problem, using non annotated data with features that can
be automatically detected to find typical contexts (pairs of discourse units) in which various discourse
relations occur. We suppose with (Sporleder and Lascarides, 2008; Braud and Denis, 2013) that such
contexts display regular lexical associations, in particular with verbs in those discourse units. An ex-
plicit, manually compiled list of all possible associations between two verbs and the semantic relations
they suggest is infeasible, so we present here an automatic method for compiling such a list, inspired by
the Verbocean project (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004).

Our hypothesis, supported by existing corpora, is that adjacent clauses are often arguments of discourse
relations. When these clauses contain certain adverbs or other discourse connectors, we can recover
automatically one or more discourse relations that we associate with the main verbs of those clauses. We
extract triples consisting of the two verbs and a semantic relation from a large corpus with the aim of
inferring that such a pair of verbs can suggest the semantic relation even in the absence of an explicit
discourse marker. We thus also suppose, with (Sporleder and Lascarides, 2008; Braud and Denis, 2013),
that such discourse markers are at least partially redundant ; inferring a discourse relation between two
clauses relies not only the marker but on the two verbs in the related clauses as well. All of our work has
been done on French data.

Our paper is organized as follows. We describe first the knowledge base of verb semantic relation
triples that we have constructed (section 2) ; we then present our methods for isolating verb pairs impli-
cating discourse or temporal information (section 3). A third section describes our methods of evaluation
(section 4) and a fourth discusses related work (section 5).

2 Exploring relations between verbs in a corpus

We built a knowledge base (V2R) 1 using the frWaC corpus(Baroni et al., 2009). frWaC contains about
1.6 billion words and was collected on the Web on the .fr domain. We first parsed the documents in our
corpus using BONSAI 2, which first produced a morpho-syntactic labeling using MElt (Denis and Sagot,
2012) and then a syntactic analysis in the form of dependency trees via a French version of the MaltParser
(Nivre et al., 2007).

Our goal is to find pairs of verbs linked by a relation explicitly marked by a discourse connector
in the corpus, as an indication of a regular semantic relation between the two verbs. The relations we
have considered are common to most theories of discourse analysis, and they can be grouped into four
classes (Prasad et al., 2008) : causal (contingency) relations, temporal relations, comparison relations
(mainly contrast type relations), and expansion relations (e.g. elaboration or continuation).

To find explicitly marked relations, we used a lexicon of discourse connectors for French, the man-
ually constructed LEXCONN resource (Roze et al., 2012) 3. LEXCONN includes 358 connectors and
gives their syntactic category as well as associated discourse relations inspired from (Asher and Las-
carides, 2003). Some connectors are ambiguous in that they are associated with several relations. We
used only the unambiguous connectors (263 in all) in LEXCONN, as a first step. We regrouped the
LEXCONN relations into classes 4 : explanation relations (parce que/because) and result (ainsi/thus)
form the causal class ; temporal relations (puis, après que/then,after that) form the narration group. We
also considered other relations like contrast (mais/but), continuation (et, encore/and,again), background
(alors que/while), temporal location (quand, pendant que/when), detachment (de toutes façons/anyway),
elaboration (en particulier/in particular), alternation (ou/or), commentary (au fait/by the way), rephras-
ing (du moins/at least), and evidence (effectivement/indeed).

We searched our syntactically parsed corpus for connectors. When a connector is found and its syn-
tactic category verified, if it is close enough to the root of the sentence (at most one dependency link
from the root), we look for an inter-sentential link. The first verb of our pair corresponds in this case

to the last verb of the previous sentence in the case of connectors for narration, or to its main verb for
all the other relations. We search for the second verb in the pair within a window of two dependency
links after the connector. If the connector is not close enough to the root of the sentence, we look for
a intra-sentential link. In this case, we look for the two verbs of the pair in the same sentence within a
forward and backward window of two dependency links.

If two verbs are found, we examine their local context to better characterize their usage and to improve
our results. If one of the verbs is a modal or support verb, we look for the verb dependent on the modal
or support verb and use that as the verb in our pair (if it exists), while keeping the presence of the
support verb in memory. Unlike support verbs, we use the presence of a negation or a reflexive particle
in the local context to distinguish verbs with different meanings ; e.g., comprendre/understand vs. ne pas
comprendre/not understand, agir/act vs. s’agir/concern are all distinct entries. To get at different verb
senses, we search for idiomatic usage of prepositions using the Dicovalence resource (Van Den Eynde
and Mertens, 2010), which contains valency frames for more than 3700 simple French verbs. We also
use the Lefff resource (Sagot, 2010) to find idiomatic verbal locutions. We also encode other information
that do not lead to distinct lexical entries : tense, and voice.

a connector, we aggregate this data to get a list of triple types
(verb1, verb2, relation). Given that we have used only unam-
biguous connectors (so classified by LEXCONN), the associ-
ation of a relation with a connector is immediate. We asso-
ciate to each triple type the number of intra-sentential, inter-
sentential and total number of occurrences. The other features
mentioned above are stored in a separate table.

Our method has isolated more than 1 million distinct types
of triples for V2R and 2 million occurrences, of which 95% are
intra-sentential 5. Among these triples, 6.2% have 5 or more
occurrences.

Table 1 summarizes the distribution of triples by relation
in V2R. Note that triples with contrast and causal relations
comprise the majority. This does not mean that these are the
most frequent relations in the corpus but only that they are the
most frequently marked by the connectors we considered. This

makes for a very different distribution than that of the French manually annotated discourse corpus Ann-
odis (Afantenos et al., 2012).

3 Measuring the association of a pair of verbs with a relation

In the last section we presented our extraction method. We now present the measures we have used to
rank verb pairs with respect to the strength of their association with a particular discourse relation. We
adapted versions of standard lexical association measures like PMI (pointwise mutual information) and
their variants, as well as some measures specific to the association of a causal relation between items (Do
et al., 2011). We also experimented with a new measure specifically designed for our knowledge base.

Measures of lexical association used in research on co-occurrences in distributional semantics pick
out significant associations, taking into account the frequency of the related items. We examined over
10 measures ; we discuss the ones with the best results (see section 4). One simple measure, PMI, and
its variants, normalized, local (Evert, 2005), discounted (Lin and Pantel, 2002), which are designed
to reduce biases in the original measure, work well. The idea behind PMI is to estimate whether the
probability of the co-occurrence of two items is greater than the a priori probability of the two items
appearing independently. In distributional semantics, the measure is also used to estimate the significance
of two items co-occurring with a particular grammatical dependency relation like the subject or object
relation between an NP and a verb. This use of PMI measures over triples in distributional semantics
fits perfectly with our task of measuring the significance of triples consisting of a pair of verbs and

5. The low proportion of inter-sentential occurrences comes from our conservative scheme for finding these occurrences,
which uses only those connectors at the beginning of the second sentence. Other schemes are possible but would, we fear,
introduce too much noise into the data.

a particular semantic or discourse relation ; our PMI measures estimate whether the co-occurrence of
two items with a particular discourse relation is higher than the a priori probability of the three items
occurring independently. Our measures consider co-occurrences of two lexical items in a certain relation
denoted by an explicit discourse marker. PMI and normalized PMI are defined as :

PMI = log(
P (V1, V2, R)

P (V1)× P (V2)× P (R))
PMI _normalized =

PMI
−2 log(P (V1, V2, R))

Indeed, when we have a complete co-occurrence of the three items, we have : P (V1) = P (V2) =
P (R) = P (V1, V2, R), and PMI = −2 log(P (V1, V2, R)). The values of normalized PMI lie between
−1 and 1, approaching −1 when the items never appear together, taking the value 0 in the case of
independence, and the value 1 when they always appear together. We also considered a weighted PMI
measure (Lin and Pantel, 2002) that corrects the bias of PMI for rare triples.

A specificity measure (Mirroshandel et al., 2013), originally used to measure the precision of subcat-
egorization frames, also performed well :

specificity =
1
3
× ( P (V1, V2, R)∑

i
P (V1, Vi, R)

+
P (V1, V2, R)∑
i
P (Vi, V2, R)

+
P (V1, V2, R)∑

i
P (V1, V2, Ri)

)

A version of Do et al. (2011)’s measure for triples involving causal relations did not fare so well on
other types of relation. The definition of the measure can be found in (Do et al., 2011). 6

Finally, we investigated a measure that evaluates the contribution of each element in the triple to the
significance measure (this measure is similar to specificity).

1

(wV1 + wV2 + wR)

4 Evaluating extracted relations

We evaluated V 2R in several ways ; we provided : (i) an intrinsic evaluation of the relations between
verbs (section 4.1) and (ii) an extrinsic evaluation where we evaluated the coverage of the resource on a
discourse annotated corpus and its potential to help in predicting discourse relations in contexts with no
explicit marking (section 4.2).

4.1 Intrinsic evaluation

Our intrinsic evaluation first evaluates the feasibility of assigning an “inherent” semantic link to a verb
pair, independently of any linguistic context. For example, is it possible to judge that there is a typical
causality link between push and fall, in scenarios where they share some arguments (subject, object, ...),
these scenarios being left to the annotator’s imagination (section 4.1.1). In a second stage, we selected
several verb pairs linked with different relations in V 2R, and 40 contexts in which these verbs occur
together in the original corpus, to judge the semantic link in context (section 4.1.2).

In both cases we restricted the study to three relation groups : causal, contrastive, and narrative. These
are the most often marked relations and correspond to different types of links with a meaningful semantic
aspect (as opposed to the “continuation” relation for instance, which is often marked too).

4.1.1 Out of context evaluation
For out of context judgments, we adopted the following protocol : one of the authors chose for each

relation 100 verbs with equivalent proportions of good and bad normalized PMI scores. Then the other

measure applies to our task.

three authors judged the validity of associating each of the 300 pairs with the corresponding relation,
without any knowledge of the source of these pairs.

We measured the inter-annotator agreements with Cohen’s Kappa (Carletta, 1996), which resulted in :
0.17 for cause, 0.42 for narration and 0.56 for contrast as mean values. If a 0.6 kappa serves a measure for
a feasible semantic judgment task, out of context judgments appear very difficult, with only contrastive
pairs as a relative exception. We decided to only consider judgments about contrast, after an adjudication
phase, and we evaluated the measures presented in section 3 to see if they could discriminate between
the two verb groups, those judged positively or negatively according to human annotations. A Mann-
Whitney U statistical test showed all of our measures to be discriminative, with the exception of raw
co-occurrence counts for which p>0.05.

4.1.2 In context evaluation

We also judged associations in context.

TABLE 2 – For each relation, the list of verb pairs manu-
ally evaluated in context (and an approximate translation),
and the association percentage resulting from the adjudi-
cated human annotation.

This task was easier and also gave more
fine-grained results, because with it we can
quantify the degree of association, and the
typicality of the link, as a proportion of con-
texts where the two verbs appear together
in a given semantic relation. We can then
observe if this proportion is correlated with
the association measures we already pre-
sented. Nevertheless, this is a costly way of
evaluating a verb pair, as we require a num-
ber of judgments on each pair. It is also not
easy to sample the possible pairs with dif-
ferent values to be able to observe signif-
icant correlations, because we cannot pre-
dict in advance how they will be judged by
the annotators.

We selected 40 contexts for each of the
15 pairs of verbs we chose, 5 for each of the
target relation (cause, narration, contrast).
Selected pairs range over different values of
normalized PMI, again chosen by one of the
authors independently of the others, who
annotated the 600 contexts. Prior to adjudi-
cation, raw agreement was 78% on average,
for an average kappa of 0.46 (and a max-
imum of 0.49). These values seem moder-
ately good, as the task is also rather diffi-
cult.

Table 2 shows the results after adjudication : for each pair, the proportion of contexts in which the
considered relation is judged to appear.

We computed two correlation values between the association ratio in contexts manually annotated
and each association measure considered : one based on all annotated contexts, and one on the subset
of contexts devoid of explicit markers of a semantic relation (implicit contexts). The latter is important
to quantify the actual impact of the method, since explicit marking is already used as the basis of verb
association in the same corpus. Implicit contexts, however, never appeared in the computation of the verb
pair associations.

Table 3 shows that mutual information measures are well correlated with human annotations, and
that our W_combined seems useful too. We also observed results on each relation separately, although
one should be careful drawing conclusions from these results since the correlations are then computed
on 5 points only. These results (not shown here) show a lot of variation between relations. The U_do
measure, designed for causal relations, does indeed produce good results for these relations, but does not
generalize well to our other chosen relations.

Also, local PMI seems to work very well on narration and causal relations. This needs to be confirmed
with more verb pairs.

We conclude that the best three measures are : normalized PMI, specificity, and W_combined. The last
two assign their maximal value to several pairs, so we used them in a lexicographical ordering to sort all
associated pairs, using normalized PMI to break ties.

4.2 Extrinsic evaluation
In order to evaluate the performance of our resource relative to its main intended application—

predicting rhetorical relations in text, we intend to use our association measures as additional features
to an inductive prediction model. Whether this evaluation produces results depends on the proportion
of cases in which this information could help and on the coverage of our resource with respect to these
cases. We used the Annodis corpus (Afantenos et al., 2012), a set of French texts annotated with rhetori-
cal relations, for our study.

To improve existing models, a significant number of the predictions to be made must involve a verb
pair for which we have information in the resource. A first indication of its usefulness is also that the
verb pair appears most frequently with the relation group to which the annotation belongs, for instance
the fact that two verbs are related with a causal relation whenever we want to predict an explanation. This
is interesting only in the absence of an explicit marking of the target relation, i.e for implicit relations.

2189



Beyond that, it should be interesting to use all the available information about other semantic relations
too : for instance a potential causal link between two events could indicate the relevance of a temporal link
for the prediction of a relation. We relied again on the Lexconn marker database. As an approximation
we considered that a relation between two discourse units is explicit when a Lexconn marker is present
in any of the two segments, and one of the potential senses of the marker is the annotated relation.
This may overestimate the number of explicit instances but ensures that all implicit instances are indeed
implicit (assuming a good enough coverage of the marker resource). The Annodis corpus lists rhetorical
relations between elementary discourse units (EDUs), typically clauses, and complex discourse units
(sets of EDUs) ; as a simplification we only consider EDUs, since the question of what is a main verb of
a complex unit is difficult to answer. This is a relatively small corpus, as it includes about 2000 instances
of relations between elementary discourse units.

Table 5 present results for coverage, for the main relations in the annotated corpus. Note that only a
small part of the set of relations between EDUs is considered when we restrict instances to both EDUs
with verbs (about 20% of the whole). It turns out that a lot of EDUs in Annodis are short segments
(incises, detached segments, ...).

cont.=continuation, elab.=elaboration.

Our table includes : the proportion of verb pairs found in Annodis EDUs that appear in V 2R, the
proportion of triples from Annodis that appear in V 2R (with the correct relation), and the restriction
of these proportions to implicit contexts in Annodis. Except for a few exceptions due to lemmatisation
errors, all verbs in Annodis are in V 2R in at least one pair, and we can see that the pairs in V 2R cover
most of the pairs appearing in Annodis (almost 70% globally and between 60 and 80% depending on the
relation), and a little less of implicit cases (around 55% on average). We note that a high proportion of the
implicit cases contains verb pairs that have been collected in a marked context, even for rarely marked
relations like elaboration or continuation—contexts with these relations are the majority in Annodis.
Furthermore more than half of these contexts are associated with the right relation in V 2R. Thus the
hypothesis of the partial redundancy of connectors appears useful when isolating verbal associations
relevant for discourse from a large corpus. We also looked at semantic neighbors of the verbs in V2R but
this did not increase coverage significantly.

A good test of the predictive power of the semantic information we gathered is also to include the
association measures as additional features to a predictive model, to improve classically low results
on implicit discourse relations. The only available discursive corpus in French, Annodis, is small, and
as shown above only about 400 instances have a verb in both related EDUs. We trained and tested
a maximum entropy model with and without the association measures as features, on top of features
presented in Muller et al. (2012), who trained a relation model on the same corpus. We did a 10-fold
cross-validation on the 400 instance subset as evaluation, and did not find a significant difference between
the two set-ups (F1 score was in the range .40–.42, similar to the cited paper), which is unsurprising

2190



given the size of the subset. We plan to evaluate our method relative to discourse parsing by building an
English resource like V2R ; we will then be able to use the much larger PDTB corpus (10 times as large
as Annodis) as a source of implicit discourse relations. This should prove a much more telling evaluation
of the usefulness of association measures in predicting implicit discourse relations.

5 Related work

There are two different groups of related work. The first group aims to alleviate the lack of annotated
data for discourse parsing by using a weakly supervised approach, exploiting the presence of discourse
connectors in a large non-annotated corpus. Each pair of elementary discourse units is automatically
annotated with the discourse relation triggered by the presence of the connector (connectors are often
filtered for non-discursive uses). Those connectors are afterwards eliminated from the corpus so that the
model trained on this dataset will not be informed by the presence of those connectors. The pioneering
article in this group is Marcu and Echihabi (2002). Such learning methods with such “artificial data”
obtain low scores, barely above chance as shown in Sporleder and Lascarides (2008). Braud and Denis
(2013) observe that the performance of a classifier for the prediction of implicit relations is much lower
when using “artificial” data than on “natural” data (implicit relations annotated by a human being). They
propose a method which exploits these two different kinds of datasets together in various mixtures and
on the level of the prediction algorithm, obtaining thus a significant improvement on the Annodis corpus.
Our approach is different and complementary ; we isolate the semantic relations between pairs of verbs.
We can use that as a feature on discourse units for discourse parsing but it has other uses as well.

A second group aims at identifying discourse relations (implicit or not) by focusing on the use of fine-
grained lexical relations as another feature during the training phase. Most of this work focuses mainly
on the use of lexical relations between two verbs. Chklovski and Pantel (2004), for example, rely on
specific patterns constructed manually for each semantic relation between (similarity, strength, antonymy,
enablement and temporal happens-before). They use the web as a corpus in order to estimate the PMI
between a pattern and a pair of verbs (a precise measurement cannot be achieved over the web since the
probability of a pattern is not precisely known over all the web). A threshold on the value of the PMI
(manually fixed) permits thus to determine the pairs of verbs that are related to the relation denoted by the
pattern. In the same spirit, Kozareva (2012) is using a weakly supervised approach for the extraction of
pairs of verbs that are potentially implied in a cause-effect relation. Her method consists in using patterns
applied to the web in order to extract pairs and generate new seeds. Do et al. (2011) focus on causal
relations and take into account not only verbs but also event denoting nouns. According to this paper,
an event is denoted by a predicate with a specific number of arguments and thus the association of the
events is the sum of the association between predicates, between predicates and arguments and between
arguments. Their association measures are based on PMI and are quite complex. Our results show that
their measures do not generalize well to association with all discourse relations. Using Gigaword as a
corpus and a reimplementation of Lin et al. (2014) they have extracted discourse relations. An inductive
logic programming approach is finally used exploiting the interaction between causal pairs and discourse
relations in order to extract causal links. Those papers focus on specific relations with the exception of
Chklovski and Pantel (2004) who do not present a systematic evaluation of their results. An important
difference of our approach is also to consider predicates and their negation as separate entries.

Finally, we mention the approaches which while focusing on the learning of discourse structures,
nonetheless enrich their systems with lexical information. Feng and Hirst (2012) have used HILDA (Her-
nault et al., 2010) adding more features. A specific family of features represents lexical similarity based
on the hierarchical distance in VERBNET and WORDNET. In a similar fashion, Wellner et al. (2006) fo-
cus on intra-sentential discourse relations adding lexical information on the features based on measures
proposed by Lin (1998) calculated on the British National Corpus. Those approaches use thus only infor-
mation on lexical similarity without semantically typing this link. The impact of this information seems
limited. As far as evaluation is concerned, our method is similar to that followed in Tremper and Frank
(2013) for implication relations combining in and out of context evaluation for verbal associations. Their
inter-annotator agreement is similar to ours (0.42-0.44 of Kappa) with very different choices : the anno-

tators were supposed to discriminate verbal links between the different possible sub-cases. The pairs of
verbs were identified by the system of Lin and Pantel. These authors also present a classification model
among the different types of relationships, assuming that two verbs are semantically related.

6 Conclusions

We have presented a knowledge base of triples involving pairs of verbs associated with semantic or
discourse relations. We extracted these triples from the large French corpus, frWaC, using discourse con-
nectors as markers of relations between two adjacent clauses containing verbs. We investigated several
measures to give the strength of association of a pair of verbs with a relation. We used manual annotations
to evaluate our method and select the best measures, and we also studied the coverage of our resource on
the discourse annotated corpus Annodis. Our positive results show our resource has the potential to help
discourse analysis as well as other semantically oriented tasks.
