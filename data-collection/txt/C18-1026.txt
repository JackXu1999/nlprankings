Abstract

We analyze two novel data sets of German educational media texts targeting adults and children.
The analysis is based on 400 automatically extracted measures of linguistic complexity from a
wide range of linguistic domains. We show that both data sets exhibit broad linguistic adaptation
to the target audience, which generalizes across both data sets. Our most successful binary
classification model for German readability robustly shows high accuracy between 89.4%–98.9%
for both data sets. To our knowledge, this comprehensive German readability model is the first for
which robust cross-corpus performance has been shown. The research also contributes resources
for German readability assessment that are externally validated as successful for different target
audiences: we compiled a new corpus of German news broadcast subtitles, the Tagesschau/Logo
corpus, and crawled a GEO/GEOlino corpus substantially enlarging the data compiled by Hancke
et al. (2012).

1 Introduction

Readability assessment refers to the task of (automatically) linking a text to the appropriate target audi-
ence based on its complexity. A diverse spectrum of potential application domains has been identified for
this task in the literature, ranging from the design and evaluation of education materials, to information
retrieval, and text simplification. Given the increasing need for learning material adapted to different
audiences and the barrier-free access to information required for political and social participation, auto-
matic readability assessment is of immediate social relevance. Accordingly, it has attracted considerable

research interest over the last decades, particularly for the assessment of English (Crossley et al., 2011;
Chen and Meurers, 2017; Feng et al., 2010).

For German readability assessment, however, little progress has been made in recent years, despite a
series of promising results published around the turn of the decade (Vor der Brück et al., 2008; Hancke
et al., 2012). In particular, German readability research has suffered from the lack of a shared reference
corpus and sufficiently comparable corpora for cross-corpus testing of readability models: While for
English research, the Common Core corpus consisting of examples from the English Language Arts
Standards of the Common Core State Standards, and the WeeklyReader corpus of online news articles
have been widely used in studies on English readability and text simplification (Vajjala and Meurers,
2014; Petersen and Ostendorf, 2009; Feng et al., 2010), there are no comparable resources for German.
This is particularly problematic, as over-fitting is a potential issue for classification algorithms, especially
given the limited size of the typical data sets.

To address these issues, we first present two new data sets for German readability assessment in Sec-
tion 3: a set of German news broadcast subtitles based on the primary German TV news outlet Tagess-
chau and the children’s counterpart Logo!, and a GEO/GEOlino corpus crawled from the educational
GEO magazine’s web site, a source first identified by Hancke et al. (2012), but double in size.1 The
longstanding success of these outlets with their target audiences provides some external validity to the
nature of the implicit linguistic adaptation of the language used. As Bryant et al. (2017) showed for
German secondary school textbooks, this is not necessarily the case across all linguistic dimensions
and adjustments may even be limited to only the surface level of text, sentence, and word length. We
conducted a series of analyses on these two data sets to accomplish the following objectives:

1. Investigate how instances of German educational news language differ in terms of language com-
plexity across adult and child target audiences.

2. Build a binary readability model for German educational language targeting adults and children that
shows high, robust classification performance across corpora.

For the purposes of our studies, we operationalize child target audience of German educational news
language as children aged between 8 and 14. This is the typical audience age range of the child-targeting
news media we analyzed.2 Adult target audience then is defined as over 14 years of age.

To address our first research question, after introducing a broad set of complexity measures in Sec-
tion 4, we compare their informativeness for distinguishing adult and child level in the two data sets in
Section 5. In Section 6, we define a series of readability models for German, including one showing high
classification accuracy between 89.4% and 98.9% on both data sets. The paper closes with a discussion
of the implications of our results for the current research discussion and an outlook on future work.

2 Related Work

For over a century, text readability has been assessed using surface measure-based readability formula
such as the Flesch-Kincaid formula (Kincaid et al., 1975) or the Dale-Chall readability formula (Chall
and Dale, 1995), see for an overview DuBay (2004). While these formula are still used in some non-
linguistic studies (Woodmansey, 2010; Grootens-Wiegers et al., 2015; Esfahani et al., 2016), a decade
ago research shifted towards using more elaborate statistical modeling approaches based on larger sets
of linguistically more informed features. Automatic readability assessment has benefited from the use of
Natural Language Processing tools for the assessment of syntactic, lexical, and discourse measures and
from adapting complexity measures employed in Second Language Acquisition research (Vajjala and
Meurers, 2012; Feng et al., 2010). There has also been extensive research on the relevance of cohesion

1We are currently negotiating with the broadcasters of Tagesschau and Logo! and the publishers of GEO/GEOlino to make
the data freely available to other researchers and will make it available from http://www.icall-research.de in that
case.

2The GEOlino magazine is advertised as targeting children between 8 and 14 years (cf. http://www.geo.de/
magazine/geolino-magazin, accessed 11.06.18, 15:49). Logo! does not specify the age of its target audience, but
has been reported to be particularly popular with children from age 8 to 12 (vom Orde, 2015).

and discourse measures for readability assessment that have successfully been employed for proficiency
assessment in the CohMetrix project (Crossley et al., 2008; Crossley et al., 2011). Another example is
the work by Feng et al. (2010), who evaluate which of the typically proposed measures of text readability
are most promising by studying their relevance on primary school students reading material. They find
language model features and cohesion in terms of entity density to be particularly useful, as well as
measures of nouns. Interestingly, they also observe overall sentence length to be more informative than
more elaborate syntactic features. While Feng et al. (2010) do not elaborate further on other lexical
measures than POS features, Chen and Meurers (2017) conduct an elaborate cross-corpus study on the
use of word frequency features for readability assessment. They show, that the typical aggregation of
word frequencies across documents are less informative than richer representations including frequency
standard deviations.

In contrast to English, research on readability assessment for other languages, such as German, is
more limited. There was a series of articles on this issue from the late 2000s to the early 2010s that
demonstrated the benefits of broad linguistic modeling, in particular the use of morphological complexity
measures for languages with rich morphological systems like German (Vor der Brück et al., 2008; Hancke
et al., 2012), but also Russian (Reynolds, 2016) or French (François and Fairon, 2012). The readability
checker DeLite of Vor der Brück et al. (2008) is one of the first more sophisticated approaches that
went beyond using simple readability formulas for German. The tool employs morphological, lexical,
syntactical, semantic, and discourse measures, which they trained on municipal administration texts rated
for their readability by humans in an online readability study involving 500 texts and 300 participant,
resulting in overall 3,000 ratings. However, due to the specific nature of the data, the robustness of the
approach across genres is unclear. Municipal administration language is so particular that results are
unlikely to generalize to educational or literary materials, which are more attractive in first and second
language acquisition contexts.

Later work by Hancke et al. (2012) also combines traditional readability formula measures, such as
text or word length, with more sophisticated lexical, syntactic, and language model, and morphological
features to assess German readability, but they employ an overall broader and more diverse feature set
than DeLite. They investigate readability of educational magazines on the GEO/GEOlino data set, which
they compiled from online articles freely available at the GEO magazine’s web page. Their work illus-
trates the relevance of rich linguistic modeling for readability assessment and in particular the value of
morphological complexity features for German.

The latest large scale research endeavor for the assessment of German text readability has focused
more on identifying linguistic differences between texts targeting different audiences than on build-
ing readability models: In the Reading Demands project, complexity differences in German secondary
school book texts across grade levels and school types were investigated. Berendes et al. (2017) and
Bryant et al. (2017) analyze to which extent publishers successfully adapt their reading material to their
target audiences. They find a lack of consistent adaptation for passive constructions, concessive and ad-
versative connectives, and relative clauses, and only some limited adaptation in terms of lexical variation,
noun complexity, and dependency length measures.

3 Data Sets

3.1 GEO/GEOlino
The GEO/GEOlino data set consists of online articles from one of the leading German monthly educa-
tional magazines, GEO, and the counterpart for children, GEOlino.3 They are comparable to the National
Geographic magazine and cover a variety of topics ranging from culture and history to technology and
nature. Hancke et al. (2012) first compiled and analyzed a data set from this web resource. We followed
their lead and crawled 8,263 articles from the GEO/GEOlino online archive, almost doubling the size of
the original corpus. We removed all material flagged as non-article contents by GEO as well as all articles
that contained less than 15 words. We further cleaned our data from crawling artifacts and performed
near-duplicate detection with the Simhash algorithm. We then grouped all texts into topic categories

306

based on the subdomains they were published under, following the web page topic structure.4 Table 1
shows the composition of the corpus in terms of the topic groups. Since the number of documents in
the different topic groups differ between GEO and the smaller GEOlino set, we created a more balanced
subset (GEO/GEOlinoS). For this, we included only topic categories existing in both GEO and GEOlino,
included all GEOlino texts in those categories and sampled from the GEO texts in those categories until
we reached the same overall size of 2480 texts each.

3.2 Tagesschau/Logo

The Tagesschau/Logo data set is compiled from subtitles of German daily news broadcasts of Tagesschau
and its children’s counterpart Logo!. Tagesschau is the dominant national television news service of Ger-
many, produced by the German public-service television network ARD. It broadcasts multiple updated
editions of daily news throughout the day. Logo! is a television news service for children produced by the
German public-service television broadcaster ZDF airing once a day. The data set consists of subtitles
for all editions of both news outlets that have been broadcasted from December 2015 to January 2017.
For this paper, we limited the Tagesschau data to the main edition broadcasted at 8pm. This amounts to
overall 421 editions for Tagesschau and 415 editions for Logo!, with the small difference arising from a
lack of Logo! broadcasts on some public holidays or due to special broadcasts. We cleaned the subtitles
by removing non-spoken comments (e.g., * music playing * or * cheering *).

3.3 Characteristics of the two data sets

Table 2 compares the profiles of the GEO/GEOlinoS and the Tagesschau/Logo data sets that we used.

Num. Sentences (median) 23 25 167 125

Table 2: Corpus profile for sampled GEO/GEOlino data set and the Tagesschau/Logo data set.

While GEO/GEOlino contains more documents than Tagesschau/Logo, they are considerably shorter
in terms of the number of words and sentences they contain. Another difference arises in terms of
the medium: GEO/GEOlino articles are self-contained reading material and Tagesschau/Logo subtitles

4Subdomains were mapped to topic groups in the following way based on the URL components following http://
www.geo.de and http://www.geo.de/geolino: building (“basteln”), learning (“lernen”), children’s recipes (“kinder-
rezepte”), and competitions (“wettbewerbe”) were categorized as DO IT YOURSELF. Jobs (“berufe”), extras (“extras”), pho-
tography (“fotografie”), creativity (“kreativ”), info (“info”), love (“liebe”), magazines (“magazine”), human (“mensch”), id-
ioms (“redewendungen”), and knowledge (“wissen”) were categorized as HUMANITY. Nature (“natur”), nature and environ-
ment (“natur-und-umwelt”), and animal encyclopedia (“tierlexikon”) were labeled as NATURE. Book reviews (“buechertipps”),
movie reviews (“filmtipps”), game reviews (“spieletest”), and GEO television (“geo-tv”) were labeled as REVIEWS. Research
and technology (“forschung-und-technik”) was labeled as TECHNOLOGY. Travel (“reisen”) was labeled as TRAVEL.

complement video material. At the same time, they consist of German educational media language
and share the functional goal of conveying information to the reader, so that we consider them to be
sufficiently similar to support a cross-corpus analysis.

4 Complexity Analysis

For the assessment of German language complexity, we extract 400 complexity measures using state of
the art NLP techniques. All features are theoretically grounded in the contemporary research in linguistic
subdisciplines, in particular Second Language Acquisition research, where Complexity is one of three
dimensions of language proficiency, together with Accuracy and Fluency (Housen et al., 2012). SLA
research has a rich tradition of analyzing the complexity development of learner language, see Lu (2010;
2012) for an overview. Vajjala and Meurers (2012) show that these measures can be successfully applied
to readability research. Building on these findings, we follow the SLA definition of complexity as the
elaborateness and variability of language (Ellis and Barkhuizen, 2005). Our measures can be grouped
into seven categories: i) lexical complexity, ii) clausal complexity, iii) phrasal complexity, iv) morpho-
logical complexity, v) discourse complexity, vi) cognitive complexity, and vii) language use. While the
former five groups are rooted in the linguistic system, the latter two categories were derived from psy-
cholinguistic research. The resulting complexity assessment covers a broad variety of measures. To the
best of our knowledge, this is currently the most extensive feature collection for German complexity
assessment.5 Table 3 gives an overview of the feature categories and how much they contribute to our
assessment.6

Category # Description

Descriptive 2 Total number of sentences and words.
Lexical 73 Lexical diversity measures such as general and POS-specific type-token ratios

as well as semantic relatedness measures.
Sentential 119 Ratios measuring sentential elaboration and variation, such as clauses per

sentence.
Phrasal 41 Ratios measuring phrasal elaboration and variation, such as modifiers per

noun phrase.
Morphological 39 Ratios of inflection, derivation, and composition measures.
Cohesion 48 Subsequent (local) or across text (global) use of implicit or explicit cohesion

markers such as connectives, pronouns, or grammatical transitions.
Cognitive 23 Dependency lengths, verb-argument distances, and ratios of cognitive

integration costs assessing cognitive processing load based on Gibson’s (2000)
Dependency Locality Theory.

Language Use 54 Word frequency ratios based on Subtlex-DE (Brysbaert et al., 2011), dlexDB
(Heister et al., 2011), Karlsruhe Children’s Texts (Lavalley et al., 2015)
Approximation of age of active use based on Karlsruhe Children’s Texts.

Table 3: Overview over complexity measures grouped by feature categories.

In order to extract these measures, we employ an elaborate analysis pipeline which relies on a number
of NLP tools and external linguistic resources. We use OpenNLP 1.6.0 for tokenization and sentence
segmentation.7 This serves as input for the Mate tools 3.6.0 (Bohnet and Nivre, 2012), which perform a
morphological analysis, lemmatization, POS tagging, and dependency parsing. We then use the JWord-

5Our feature collection draws from varying perspectives on language complexity including SLA and human language pro-
cessing research. While the confirmation or refutation of specific theories underlying these measures is an interesting research
endeavor, our empirical questions focus on which of these features support the distinction of texts targeting different audiences.

6We are working on integrating our German complexity analysis pipeline into CTAP (Chen and Meurers, 2016) to make it
generally available and will include an online documentation for each feature.

Splitter 3.4.0 for compound analysis.8 The Mate POS tags are further used to inform the Stanford PCFG
parser 3.6.0 (Rafferty and Manning, 2008) and the Berkeley parser 1.7.0 (Petrov and Klein, 2007), which
we use for constituency and topological field parsing. For all tools, we use the German default models
that were provided with them, except for the Berkeley parser, for which we use the topological field
model by Ziai and Meurers (2018). With these annotations, we extract all instances of the linguistic
constructs that we need to calculate the final 400 complexity ratios.9

5 Study 1: Which complexity measures are informative?

5.1 Set-Up

We first want to determine the informativeness of each measure for distinguishing between adult and
child target audience. For this, we calculate the information gain of each measure on both data sets
using 10-folds cross-validation for training and testing. We then compare across both data sets i) the
number of features that are informative, and ii) the 20 most informative measures that show a Pearson
correlation smaller than±0.8 with each other.10 This allows us to gain insights into the range of linguistic
properties of the documents targeting adults and children. We used WEKA (Hall et al., 2009) to calculate
information gain and R for the correlation analysis.

5.2 Results and Discussion

Table 4 shows the percentage of measures that exhibited an average information gain above zero.

Data Set Percentage Informative to Total

GEO/GEOlino 79.00% 316/400
Tagesschau/Logo 88.25% 353/400

Table 4: Percentage of informative measures based on 10-folds cross-validated information gain.

Overall, 79.00% of the measures are informative for the GEO/GEOlino data and 88.25% for the Tagess-
chau/Logo data. This shows, that the documents are adjusted to their different target audiences in terms
of a broad range of dimensions of linguistic complexity.

Table 5 provides a deeper look into the linguistic design of the documents by showing the 20 most
informative measures distinguishing adult from child targeted documents, including only measures with
a correlation less than ±0.8. The table shows the original rank of each measure before removal of
correlated measures, the average merit of each measure for the distinction of the target audience, the
type of complexity measures it belongs to, and the feature name.

The results for both data sets show a diverse collection of features, some of which are similar for
both data sets, but also some interesting differences. In total the measures seem to be more informative
for Tagesschau/Logo, as indicated by the higher average merit, and more correlated, as can be seen
from the wider range of original ranks. Language use as captured by frequency measures is particularly
relevant for both data sets. The table includes seven measures of word frequency for GEO/GEOlino
and five for Tagesschau/Logo. For both data sets, the most informative measure is one of language use:
For GEO/GEOlino it is the average minimal age of active use of lexical types found in the Karlsruhe
Children’s Corpus (KCT) of Lavalley et al. (2015). For Tagesschau/Logo it is the average log lexical
type frequency based on Google Books 2000. The other language-use measures are very similar across
data sets: Lexical types unknown to the Subtlex-DE data base (Brysbaert et al., 2011), for example, rank
4th and 2nd on both data sets and while on Tagesschau/Logo the lemma frequency per lexical type found
in KCT is the 12th most informative measure, its log counterpart ranks 8th on GEO/GEOlino.

9To support transparent comparison with other complexity studies, we include a description of the operationalization of all

linguistic units that allow for varying definitions in Appendix A, as has been suggested by Bulté and Housen (2014).
10We set the Pearson correlation threshold relatively high since we primarily are interested in qualitatively inspecting the

types of measures that are informative, not in removing all correlations.

Cohesion measures are highly informative, too, although more so for Tagesschau/Logo. In particular
the use of certain personal or possessive pronouns is highly informative for GEO/GEOlino. The use of
second person pronouns ranks highly for both data sets, which may easily be explained by it being used
for the informal German address appropriate when speaking to children. This is further corroborated by
the ratio of second person verb inflections being ranked as the 13th most important measure. For Tagess-
chau/Logo, other implicit measures of textual cohesion based on content overlap are also informative as
well as the use of causal connectives. Overall 55% of the most informative 20 measures for both data set
are captured by these two categories.

The other feature groups are less frequently represented, but provide some interpretable insights into
the data. First, both data sets show indications of differences in the degree of nominalization used in
language targeting adults and children: For GEO/GEOlino, complex noun phrases per t-unit and finite
clause are highly informative as well as the use of the nominalization suffix -ion. On Tagesschau/Logo,
genitive case, determiners per noun phrase, and the percentage of compound nouns indicate a similar
relevance of differences regarding the organisation of the nominal domain. Lexical and sentential com-
plexity seems to be less homogeneous for the distinction of adult and child targeted language across data
sets: There are two measures of lexical complexity assessing word length in syllables and the semantic
inter-relatedness of words ranked high for GEO/GEOlino, while on Tagesschau/Logo, lexical diversity
and verb variation are particularly informative. For sentential complexity, constituency tree complexity,
the average length of the middle field, and the use of prepositional phrases per t-unit are particularly in-
formative on GEO/GEOlino. On Tagesschau/Logo, parse tree height and the use of conjunctional clauses
are relevant. Cognitive measures do not seem to play an important role on either data set, except for the
sum of longest dependencies per clause on Tagesschau/Logo.

Overall, these results clearly show that for both data sets the distinction between target audiences is
not just made based on surface modifications such as sentence or word length. In fact, these measures do
not occur among the most informative measures at all. Rather, measures of language use and cohesion
are predominantly informative for the distinction of adult and child targeting texts, but also measures
of phrasal, sentential, lexical, and morphological complexity. The adjustment of the data to their audi-
ence observed here thus seems to be more linguistically refined than that found in the ReadingDemands
textbook data, where Berendes et al. (2017) found only few adjustment across dimensions.

6 Study 2: Can we successfully model readability for German, also across data sets?

6.1 Set-Up
Our second objective is the design of a robust model of educational media language that distinguishes
robustly between language targeting adults and children across corpora and genres. For this, we train two
binary Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) support vector classifier (Platt, 1998) with linear kernels
using the WEKA machine learning toolkit (Hall et al., 2009). Each model is tested i) on the same corpus
it is trained on, using 10-folds cross-validation, and afterwards ii) on the other data set for cross-corpus
testing after training on the full data set. For model performance evaluation, we report classification
accuracy and the classification confusion matrices, and random baselines as reference point.

6.2 Results and Discussion
Table 6 shows the accuracy of our SMO models on both data sets and compares them with a random
baseline. Both models clearly outperform the baseline of 50.0%. On GEO/GEOlinoS , the performance
is comparable to the performance observed by Hancke et al. (2012) on the original GEO/GEOlino data.11

As Table 7a shows, erroneous classifications are roughly balanced across both classes, showing that the
model does not prefer one class over the other. When training a model using only the 20 most informative
measures identified in Study 1, we reach an accuracy of 85.1%, i.e., the additional measures only account
only for 3.3%.12 When testing the models on the Tagesschau/Logo corpus, accuracy increases to 98.8%
for both models. The confusion matrix for the model using 400 measures in Table 7b seems to indicate

11After observing these results, we obtained the original GEO/GEOlino data set from Hancke et al. (2012) and trained and
tested a model with 10-folds cross-validation on it. When using the same data, our model outperforms their best performing

a minor tendency towards classifying Logo! texts as Tagesschau texts, but due to the low number of
incorrect classifications this is not conclusive.

Overall, performance of both models trained on GEO/GEOlinoS on the Tagesschau/Logo data is com-
parable to the performance of both models trained and tested on Tagesschau/Logo with 10-folds cross-
validation, although the confusion matrix for the cross-validated Tagesschau/Logo model using 400 mea-
sures does not exhibit any tendency towards predicting one class preferred over the other, as may be seen

Table 8: Confusion matrices for testing models with 400 features trained on Tagesschau/Logo

The model trained and tested on Tagesschau/Logo reaches an unexpectedly high accuracy of 99.9% for
using 400 measures and 99.8% when using only the 20 most informative measures reported in Study 1.
Since the performance remains high when using only 20 measures and the standard deviation across
folds is very low, the results seem not to be due to over-fitting. The model learns linguistic properties
of the data set that generalize across. It is important to stress here than none of our measures include
n-gram language models or any other lexical content features but only complexity measures aggregated
over each document.13

model with 91.1%, confirming that our approach is in fact competitive with the state of the art.
12We do not show the confusion matrices for the models with 20 features, because they are equivalent to the matrices in

Table 7. The same holds for the models tested on Tagesschau/Logo and their matrices in Table 8.
13Content features are problematic since they can pick up recurring phrases that are characteristic of particular media outlets

rather than generalizable linguistic complexity characteristics. E.g., the Tagesschau always starts with the greeting “Hier ist das
Erste Deutsche Fernsehen mit der Tagesschau.” (Here is the first public German TV channel with the daily news.).



312

When testing the models trained on the Tagesschau/Logo data set on the GEO/GEOlinoS data, it be-
comes apparent that the characteristics learned from the Tagesschau/Logo data set do not generalize,
with the model based on 400 measures performing only marginally above chance, and the model us-
ing the 20 measures performing slightly better with 56.2%. When considering the confusion matrix for
this model in Table 8b, we see that most texts are classified as GEOlino texts, irrespective of whether
they belong to GEO or GEOlino. The Tagesschau/Logo trained models do not generalize well to the
other adult/child corpus. Since the model trained on GEO/GEOlinoS is highly successful when tested
on Tagesschau/Logo, this cannot be due to an actual lack of generalizable differences in the linguistic
characteristics of the adult and child targeting texts contained in both data sets. One possible reason for
these results may be that, as Study 1 showed, the measures are considerably more informative on Tagess-
chau/Logo than on GEO/GEOlinoS . It could be, that the differences between the news subtitles designed
for different target audiences are more extreme than those observable for the GEO magazines. This
would explain the surprisingly good performance of the GEO/GEOlinoS model on the Tagesschau/Logo
data, which would then be easier to distinguish, while also accounting for the poor performance in the
opposite case.

7 Summary and Outlook

We presented a study of the difference between German targeting adults and children, as far as we know
the most broadly based linguistic complexity analysis to date. We created and analyzed a novel data set
compiled from German news subtitles that consists of news broadcasts for adults and children from the
same days, ensuring a relatively parallel selection of topics. We compared this with a newly compiled
GEO/GEOlino corpus consisting of online articles of two magazines for adults and children by the same
publisher discussing the similar topics. Based on these two data sets, we presented within-corpus (10-fold
CV) and cross-corpus experiments and built binary classification models of German educational media
text readability that perform with very high accuracy across both data sets. The model is based on a broad
range of features that are highly informative for both data sets. This model is a valuable contribution since
i) it is based on a considerably broader data basis than previous approaches to German readability, and ii)
it successfully generalizes across the data sets, illustrating surprising robustness across rather different
text types. The approach presented thus extends the state-of-the-art in Hancke et al. (2012) in terms of
the breadth of features integrated and the accuracy and generalizability of the model – and provides two
new data sources for this line of research.

The paper also contributes some new insights into the linguistic characteristics of German media lan-
guage targeting adults and children. Since all the language is produced by adults, it is not necessarily
clear how well it is in fact adjusted to the target audience. As demonstrated by Berendes et al. (2017),
German textbook publishers indeed do not seem to be adjusting the complexity of the language used ac-
cording to school type and grade level in any systematic way. Our results for educational media language
indicate, that i) both data sets are successfully and broadly adapted towards their target audiences; and ii)
that they form two distinct, cross-corpus generalizable constructs of German educational media language
for children and adults. In a next step, we plan to test to which extent this linguistically diverse and gen-
eralized construct matches the language competence of the intended children target group by comparing
it with the Karlsruhe Children’s Text corpus (Lavalley et al., 2015). We also plan to further investigate
the linguistic properties of our two data sets. In particular, the Tagesschau/Logo data set requires further
statistical and qualitative analyses to investigate why its linguistic characteristics generalize well across
all folds of the data set itself but not across GEO/GEOlino. We also plan to conduct more analyses of the
informativeness of the different complexity feature groups for the target audience distinction.

Appendix A. Definitions of Linguistic Units

Clauses are all maximal projections of finite verbs and elliptical constructions with sentential status (i.e.
all sub-trees tagged with S), as well as to infinitives that have a sentential status (satzwertige zu
Infinitive).

Complex t-units are t-units that include subordinate clauses.

Conjunctional clauses are all dependent clauses that are introduced by a subordinating conjunction
such as dass, weil, or wenn.

Dependent clauses with conjunction are all conjunctional clauses, but also interrogative and relative
clauses. Dependent clauses without conjunction are mostly dependent main clauses, such as Ich
weiß, es ist spät.

(Graphematic) sentences are strings of at least one token that are ended by sentence ending punctuation
marks: !, ., ?. There is a broad discussion on alternative sentence definitions, see for example
Schmidt (2016) for a more elaborate theoretical account. However, since sentences are identified
by sentence segmentation tools, which are primarily based on punctuation, sentences are always
defined as graphematic sentences.

Half modals are haben, sein, scheinen, drohen, versprechen, if they govern an infinitive with zu (Duden,
2009, §101), e.g. ist zu machen, droht zu schneien.

Lexical words are all nouns, adjectives, adverbs, foreign words, numbers, main verbs, and modal verbs.
Note that there is an ongoing discussion on whether modals actually qualify as lexical words (Reis,
2001), hence there is also a subset of lexical words excluding modals employed throughout the
system.

Parts-of-Speech are operationalized following the Tiger POS tags (Albert et al., 2003, 121).

Quasi passives are bekommen, erhalten or kriegen if they govern a past participle (Duden, 2009, §179),
e.g. bekommt gemacht, kriegt eröffnet.

T-units are “one main clause plus any subordinate clause or non clausal structure that is attached to or
embedded in it” (Hunt, 1970, 4).

sich niemand. Das Attentat ereignete sich im europäischen Teil Istanbuls. Dort liegt direkt
am Bosporus der Club ”Reina”, der bei Prominenten beliebt ist. Nur eine Stunde währte in
der Türkei die Hoffnung, 2017 könnte ruhiger werden als 2016, das von Bombenanschlägen
geprägt war. Doch um 1.15 Uhr Ortszeit macht im Istanbuler Nachtclub ”Reina” ein Attentäter
mit einem Gewehr Jagd auf Gäste einer Silvesterparty. Zuvor wurde vorm Club ein Polizist
erschossen. Der Täter konnte fliehen, eine Großfahndung läuft. Bis zu 800 Personen sollen
sich in der Diskothek aufgehalten haben. Gäste berichten, Panik sei ausgebrochen. Einige Be-
sucher sollen in den Bosporus gesprungen sein. Unter den Toten und Verletzten sind Ausländer.
Bekannt hat sich niemand zu der Tat. Türkische Medien vermuten den IS hinter dem Terrorakt.
Die Regierung verhängte eine Nachrichtensperre. Wir lassen uns vom Terror nicht beirren.
Was hier passierte, kann morgen an einem anderem Ort geschehen. Es gibt keine Garantien.
Der Nachtclub ”Reina” liegt am Bosporus, im Stadtteil Ortaköy. Er ist der berühmteste der
Türkei, teuer und bei Touristen beliebt. Die Sicherheitsvorkehrungen waren landesweit erhöht
worden. In Istanbul waren 17.000 Polizisten im Einsatz. Trotz Großaufgebot der Polizei,
hochaktiver Geheimdienste, Ausnahmezustand und markiger Politikerworte: Die Sicherheit-
slage in der Türkei spitzt sich zu. Beängstigende Aussichten für Wirtschaft und Menschen.

In der türkischen Großstadt Istanbul hat es an Silvester einen Anschlag in einer Disco
gegeben. Ein Mann stürmte mit einem Gewehr in den Club und hat 39 Menschen getötet,
darunter auch zwei Männer, die in Deutschland gelebt haben. Die türkische Polizei sucht jetzt
nach dem Täter. Er ist seit dem Anschlag auf der Flucht. Auch am zweiten Tag nach dem An-
schlag kamen viele Menschen an die Polizeiabsperrung, um Blumen für die Opfer niederzule-
gen. Der Terrorist stürmte dort in der Silvesternacht mit einem Gewehr in die Disco. Ich war
völlig geschockt, konnte mich nicht bewegen. Der Täter schoss erst auf einen Polizisten und
dann auf die Gäste. Wir hörten plötzlich Schüsse, da sind wir raus aus dem Ballsaal auf die
Terrasse und haben uns dort versteckt. Im Internet behauptet die Terrorgruppe IS, Islamischer
Staat, dass sie hinter dem Anschlag stecke. Die Kämpfer dieser Terrorgruppe wollen, dass alle
Menschen nach ihren strengen religiösen Regeln leben. Wer sich nicht daran hält, wird sogar
umgebracht. Besonders aktiv ist der IS in Teilen von Syrien und dem Irak. Beide Länder gren-
zen an die Türkei. Dort haben die Kämpfer in letzter Zeit schon öfter Anschläge verübt. In
der ganzen Türkei sucht die Polizei jetzt nach dem Attentäter. Acht Verdächtige wurden schon
festgenommen. Auf logo.de könnt ihr mehr zur Terrorgruppe Islamischer Staat lesen und da

Appendix C. Example Articles from GEO and GEOlino

GEO article titled “Was ist ein Planet?” (What is a Planet?).14 It discusses criteria celestial bodies need
to fulfill to be considered a planet.

Lange bezeichneten Menschen alle Lichtpunkte, die über den Nachthimmel wanderten, als
Planeten (griech. planáomai = umherirren) – gleich, ob es sich um Venus, Mars, Mond oder
Asteroiden handelte. In der Neuzeit durften den Titel nur noch die großen Himmelskörper
tragen, die um die Sonne kreisten, aber keine Monde waren – also nicht ihrerseits einen anderen
Planeten umrundeten. Als Astronomen von 1992 an in den Randbezirken des Sonnensystems
immer neue Objekte entdeckten, manche ähnlich groß wie Pluto (bis dahin der neunte Planet),
sah sich die Internationale Astronomische Union genötigt, erstmals zu definieren, was ein
Planet genau ist. Nach heftigen Diskussionen beschlossen die Astronomen 2006 die Resolution
B5. Demnach muss ein Planet drei Kriterien erfüllen: Er muss um die Sonne kreisen. Er
muss ausreichend Masse aufweisen, sodass er unter seiner eigenen Schwerkraft eine nahezu
runde Form angenommen hat. Und er muss die Umgebung seiner Umlaufbahn freigeräumt
haben. Objekte, die ihm auf seiner Bahn nahekommen, “schluckt” er in einer Kollision oder
schleudert sie in einen anderen Orbit. Pluto, Eris und andere große Himmelskörper zählen nun
zu den Zwergplaneten, da sie es nicht schaffen, ihre Bahn zu bereinigen, sondern sie sich mit
anderen Objekten teilen. Damit kreisen nach derzeitigem Stand acht Planeten um die Sonne.
Die Astronomen unterteilen sie in die vier terrestrischen Planeten Merkur, Venus, Erde, Mars
(sie werden wegen ihrer festen Oberfläche häufig steinige Planeten genannt) und in die vier
jovianischen – jupiterähnlichen – Planeten Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptun (aufgrund ihrer
Zusammensetzung oft als Gasplaneten oder Gasriesen bezeichnet). Wobei Uranus und Neptun
manchmal auch als “Eisriesen” beschrieben werden, da sie weniger Wasserstoff als Jupiter und
Saturn enthalten, dafür mehr gefrorenes Methan, Wasser und Ammoniak.

GEOlino article titled “Sieben erdähnliche Planeten entdeckt” (Seven Earth-Like Planets Discovered).15

It reports on the discovery of seven new planets that orbit Trappist-1.

Dass neue Planeten entdeckt werden, ist erstmal nichts ungewöhnliches. Doch der Fund
dieser sieben sogenannten Exoplaneten (Planeten wie Kepler-452b , die sich um einen Stern
- außerhalb des Einflusses unserer Sonne - bewegen) ist etwas ganz Besonderes: Denn sechs
der neu entdeckten Planeten liegen in einer Temperaturzone, in der Leben möglich ist. Auf
den meisten Planeten ist es entweder kochend heiß oder eiskalt - schwierige Bedingungen
für die Entwicklung von Leben. Die Sonne der Exoplaneten, der Zwergstern Trappist-1 ,
ist viel kleiner als die Sonne unseres Sonnensystems : Trappist-1 besitzt nur acht Prozent
der Masse unserer Sonne und zwölf Prozent ihres Durchmessers. Auf drei der entdeckten
Exoplaneten könnte sogar Wasser existieren, denn ihr Abstand zur Zwergsonne liegt in einem
Temperaturbereich, in dem Wasser weder gefrieren noch verdampfen würde. Hier wäre also
eine Art von Leben möglich, wie wir es auf unserer Erde kennen.

Die sieben Planeten haben in etwa die Größe unserer Erde und sind wahrscheinlich
Gesteinsplaneten. Sie alle umkreisen ihre Sonne, den Stern Trappist-1, der knappe 40 Licht-
jahre (ein Lichtjahr ist die Strecke, die Licht in einem Jahr zurücklegt) von uns entfernt im
Sternenbild Wassermann liegt. Weil die Sonne des Trappist-1-Systems so klein ist, können die
Planeten diese wesentlich schneller umkreisen als wie es in unserem Sonnensystem möglich
ist. Die sechs Planeten, die dem Zwergstern am nächsten sind, umrunden ihn in eineinhalb bis
zwölf Tagen. Sie haben damit einen engeren Orbit als der Merkur um die Sonne .
