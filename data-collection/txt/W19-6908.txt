Abstract

Irish and Scottish Gaelic are similar but
distinct languages from the Celtic lan-
guage family. Both languages are under-
resourced in terms of machine transla-
tion (MT), with Irish being the better re-
sourced. In this paper, we show how back-
translation can be used to harness the re-
sources of these similar low-resourced lan-
guages and build a Scottish-Gaelic to En-
glish MT system with little or no high-
quality bilingual data.

1 Introduction

Irish (GA) and Scottish Gaelic (GD) are recog-
nised minority languages, both in their native
countries and in the EU. Both languages are minor-
ity languages, with English (EN) as the dominant
language. Irish is also the first official language
of Ireland and an official EU language. This ben-
efits the Irish language in terms of MT resources
because a certain amount of public information is
required by law to be available in Irish, both at
a national and European level1. Although Scot-
tish Gaelic is recognised in the UK by the Gaelic
Language Act (2005)2, neither the UK government
nor the EU are legally obliged to publish Scottish
Gaelic texts. This has led to a shortage in avail-
able corpora suitable for training statistical ma-
chine translation (SMT) and neural machine trans-
lation (NMT) systems. Without the support of laws

that require the output of Scottish Gaelic content,
there is the risk that GD MT will not be able to
reach the same status as other major languages.

As with other low-resourced and inflected lan-
guages, Gaelic languages suffer from data sparsity.
While other language pairs can achieve high trans-
lation accuracy using state-of-the-art data-hungry
methods, language pairs with fewer resources of-
ten have to employ creative methods to improve
MT quality. One such approach is to create arti-
ficial data to boost the amount of corpora avail-
able for training. The premise of this method is
that even if the data is not of a high quality, the
MT system can still draw benefits from the extra
data. Backtranslation is one such method for in-
creasing the amount of creating artificial data. This
paper describes our efforts to, through backtrans-
lation, leverage the greater number of language re-
sources available to Irish to improve MT systems
for GD↔GA and GD↔EN.

This paper is laid out as follows: Section 2 and
Section 3 give some background in terms of MT
and linguistics. The data used in these experi-
ments is detailed in Section 4. Section 5 describes
the methodology employed in these experiments,
the results of which are presented and discussed in
Section 6. Finally, some avenues for future work
are described in Section 7.

2 MT background

Data sparsity in low-resourced languages is exac-
erbated by the advent of NMT (Sutskever et al.,
2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015), a data-hungry MT
paradigm that requires huge amounts of parallel
text to train a system of sufficient quality.3 We be-
3A marker of sufficient quality could be taken from Escartı́n
and Arcedillo (2015) who indicate that a BLEU score of 45+
can increase translator productivity for EN-ES.

lieve that language technology resources are vital
for the preservation and growth of every language
and that it is necessary to develop methods of cre-
ating MT systems for languages without an exten-
sive amount of language data available.

Previous experiments have shown backtransla-
tion to be a viable method of artificial data creation
(Sennrich et al., 2015; Burlot and Yvon, 2018;
Poncelas et al., 2018). One possible benefit of
backtranslation is that it allows the use of more
than one MT paradigm (e.g. rule-based, statisti-
cal, neural) to create a MT model. In this way,
the resulting model could gain benefits from each
paradigm used.

Apertium (Forcada et al., 2011) is an open
source machine translation platform which uses
rule-based machine translation (RBMT) as the un-
derlying MT technology. One of the benefits of
RBMT is that it requires no parallel data, apart
from a dictionary. There have been some efforts
towards creating a RBMT system for GA↔GD.
However, the GA↔GD Apertium module is listed
as being in the incubator stage, which indicates
that more work is needed before the MT system
can be classed as being reliable.

There has been some previous work to create a
GA→GD MT system with little or no data (Scan-
nell, 2006). In this approach, the author builds
a pipeline-style MT system which uses stages
of standardisation, part-of-speech tagging, word
sense disambiguation, syntactic transfer, lexical
transfer and post-processing. There is also some
literature surrounding the development of a SMT
system for the GA–GD pair (Scannell, 2014). This
approach involves training a word-based model,
similar to the IBM model 1.

Research has been carried out on GD-EN NMT
(Chen, 2018), in which the author uses linguistic
features such as glosses to improve the system.

3 Linguistic overview

Translating between sentences with differing sen-
tence structures can be a challenge for MT systems
and can lead to poor quality MT output, partic-
ularly for longer sentences (Koehn and Knowles,
2017). Gaelic languages employ a verb-subject-
object (VSO) sentence structure, different to the
sentence-verb-object (SVO) structure more com-
monly seen in Indo-European languages. Figure 1
illustrates the similar word order of Scottish Gaelic
and Irish, and how it diverges with that of English.

Figure 1: An example sentence highlighting the divergent
word order between English and both Irish and Gaelic

Irish and Scottish Gaelic both display richer
morphology than English. Example sentence 1
shows the inflection of the feminine nouns ‘creag’
(GD) and ‘carraig’ (GA), both meaning ‘rock’ or
‘cliff’4. Inflection can have an impact on data spar-
sity (inflected words seen less frequently in train-
ing data) and also on automatic evaluation met-
rics such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), which
considers inflected words as being wholly different
from their uninflected counterparts, and can some-
times penalise translation output too harshly as a
result (Callison-Burch et al., 2006).

4 Data

SMT and NMT, currently the two most prominent
MT paradigms, require large amounts of bilingual
data. Therefore, the availability of data plays a
huge part in the quality of MT output. In this sec-
tion we describe the GD and GA language data re-
sources used in our experiments.

4.1 Scottish Gaelic

Wikipedia Scottish Gaelic language Wikipedia
(Uicipeid5) contains 14,801 articles at the time of
download 6. Pre-processing including sentence to-
kenising, removal of wiki-text, tags and blank lines
was performed, providing us with a resulting cor-
pus of 87,788 sentences of monolingual Scottish
Gaelic. This corpus can be described as being of
mixed domain, with clear, formal sentences.

OPUS OPUS (Tiedemann, 2012) is a repository
of language resources available for download from

the web7. OPUS provides us with bilingual GA–
GD and EN-GD corpora from a number of sources.
Two bilingual GA–GD corpora that OPUS pro-
vides us with are the Ubuntu (655 parallel sen-
tences) and GNOME (5,317 sentences) manuals.
These are strictly within the technical domain, and
often contain ‘sentences’ that are in fact 1-3 word
phrases rich in technical jargon. Tatoeba, another
OPUS source, is a corpus of short, simplified sen-
tences for language learning purposes. While there
was not a GD–GA Tatoeba corpus available, we
downloaded the monolingual corpora for each lan-
guage and manually aligned any matching sen-
tences (referred to as Tatoeba-ga). OPUS also
provides us with EN-GD parallel corpora from
Tatoeba (Tatoeba-en), Ubuntu and GNOME.

4.2 Irish

In this work, we use the datasets described by
Dowling et al. (2018). This consists of 108,000
parallel sentences from sources such as the Depart-
ment of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and
the Citizens Information website8.

5 Method

In these experiments we take an approach to build-
ing an MT system using backtranslation illustrated
by Figure 2. In step (1) monolingual data in lan-
guage X (e.g. GA) is translated to language Y (e.g.
GD) using the Apertium RBMT system. This cre-
ates an artificial parallel dataset. In step (2) this ar-
tificial dataset is then used to train a SMT system
in the opposite language direction (e.g. GD→GA).
(3) The resulting system can be used to translate
new documents from language Y to language X.

to build SMT systems in these experiments

We carry out four sets of experiments (1, 2, 3
and 4) based on each language pair.

Experiment 1: GD→GA In these experiments
(1A–C in Table 2), the Ubuntu and GNOME data
sets are used as the authentic training data and the
Uicipeid dataset is used as the basis of the artificial
bilingual dataset (see Section 4).

Experiment 2: GA→GD To maintain consis-
tency, the authentic dataset used in Exp. 1 is
also used in these experiments (2A–C in Table 2).
The bilingual artificial dataset is generated through
backtranslation of the GA dataset used in previous
EN-GA research, as described in Section 4.2.

Experiment 3: GD→EN With a relatively large
EN-GA parallel dataset at our disposal, we chose
to take this backtranslation method a step further.
In these experiments (3A–C in Table 2), the GA
side of the EN-GA dataset is translated to Scottish
Gaelic using Apertium, as in 5. However, rather
than pairing the machine translated Scottish Gaelic
text with the authentic Irish text, we instead choose
to train a system using the EN portion of the au-
thentic EN-GA dataset. This results in a GD→EN
SMT system.

Experiment 4: EN→GD The method of gener-
ating artificial corpora is identical to that of Exp.
3, with the exception of the change in language di-
rection. The results for these experiments are pre-
sented as experiments 4A–C in Table 2.

5.1 Building and adding to the baseline
Each experiment contains three parts (referred to
in Table 2). Part A involves creating a base-
line by training a SMT system using only au-
thentic data. Part B trains a SMT system using
the artificial dataset created through backtransla-
tion. This experiment most closely resembles Fig-
ure 2. Finally, in part C, the authentic and arti-
ficial datasets are combined to train a SMT sys-
tem. Systems are trained using Moses (Koehn et
al., 2007) with default parameters, with the excep-
tion of the GD↔EN systems which use a 6-gram
language model and hierarchical reordering tables
to partly address the divergent word order between
the two languages.

6 Results and Conclusions

We report on BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), an au-
tomatic metric of evaluating MT, to provide an in-
dication of quality for the MT systems trained. For
consistency in domain, the test data for all systems
comes from the Tatoeba source. It should be noted
that while the source is the same, Tateoba-ga and
Tatoeba-en differ in both content and size (see Sec-
tion 4).

Table 2: BLEU scores for each experiment (Exp.), with the
number of authentic (Auth.) and artificial (Artif.) sentences
used to train each system. Scores are also given for the Aper-
tium (Apert.) system used to generate the artificial data.

The results presented in Table 2 and Fig. 3 show
a marked improvement in BLEU score over the
baseline when backtranslated data is included as
training data. We also include BLEU scores for
the Apertium GA-GD module, generated through

the translation of the test corpus Tatoeba-ga. De-
spite the low BLEU score of the Apertium GA-GD
module, SMT systems trained using solely artifi-
cial data also show an increase in BLEU over the
baseline. This indicates that even if the quality of
the MT system used to backtranslate is poor, it may
still be possible to gain benefits from the back-
translated data. The highest automatic scores from
all 4 experiment series are produced when the au-
thentic corpus is paired with the artificial data. It is
interesting to note that while BLEU scores for the
EN↔GD experiments (3A-4C) are substantially
lower the same trend can still be seen. This could
indicate that backtranslation is a usable method of
artificial data creation, even with linguistically dif-
ferent language pairs such as EN–GD.

7 Future Work

In terms of future work, human analysis will be
necessary to determine if there is an actual in-
crease in quality (in terms of usabiltiy, fluency,
etc.), rather than relying on automatic metrics.

Another possible avenue for future work is to
use a system similar to that of Scannell (2006)
to assess whether backtranslated data of a higher
quality could be produced, presumably resulting
in a more accurate MT output. Furthermore, while
GA and GD are generally similar in sentence struc-
ture, there are a few cases where the two differ.
It would be interesting to observe the standard of
MT within these divergent situations and, if the
standard is lower, investigate whether the inclusion
of linguistic rules such as those used in Scannell
(2006) could lead to an increase in quality.

We also note that Tatoeba is a corpus of sim-

ple, short sentences. It would be pertinent to repeat
these experiments with test data from different do-
mains to investigate if the same increase in BLEU
is witnessed with other types of input.

Other monolingual data sources, such as Cor-
pas na Gàidhlig9 or Irish Wikipedia10 could be
used as sources for the creation of more backtrans-
lated data. It would be interesting to view the ef-
fect of additional artificial data on the MT output.
Moreover, if a large enough artificial corpus could
be generated, these experiments could be repeated
with NMT instead of SMT and compared to the
research of Chen (2018).

It is our hope that this work could form a ba-
sis on which to extend to other Celtic languages
and investigate whether it is useful for improving
resources for similarly resourced languages.
