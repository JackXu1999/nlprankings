Abstract

We present a study on two key character-
istics of human syntactic annotations: an-
choring and agreement. Anchoring is a well
known cognitive bias in human decision mak-
ing, where judgments are drawn towards pre-
existing values. We study the influence of
anchoring on a standard approach to creation
of syntactic resources where syntactic annota-
tions are obtained via human editing of tagger
and parser output. Our experiments demon-
strate a clear anchoring effect and reveal un-
wanted consequences, including overestima-
tion of parsing performance and lower qual-
ity of annotations in comparison with human-
based annotations. Using sentences from the
Penn Treebank WSJ, we also report systemat-
ically obtained inter-annotator agreement es-
timates for English dependency parsing. Our
agreement results control for parser bias, and
are consequential in that they are on par with
state of the art parsing performance for En-
glish newswire. We discuss the impact of our
findings on strategies for future annotation ef-
forts and parser evaluations.1

1 Introduction

Research in NLP relies heavily on the availability of
human annotations for various linguistic prediction
tasks. Such resources are commonly treated as de
facto “gold standards” and are used for both training

available.

and evaluation of algorithms for automatic annota-
tion. At the same time, human agreement on these
annotations provides an indicator for the difficulty
of the task, and can be instrumental for estimating
upper limits for the performance obtainable by com-
putational methods.

Linguistic gold standards are often constructed
using pre-existing annotations, generated by auto-
matic tools. The output of such tools is then man-
ually corrected by human annotators to produce the
gold standard. The justification for this annotation
methodology was first introduced in a set of exper-
iments on POS tag annotation conducted as part of
the Penn Treebank project (Marcus et al., 1993). In
this study, the authors concluded that tagger-based
annotations are not only much faster to obtain, but
also more consistent and of higher quality compared
to annotations from scratch. Following the Penn
Treebank, syntactic annotation projects for various
languages, including German (Brants et al., 2002),
French (Abeillé et al., 2003), Arabic (Maamouri
et al., 2004) and many others, were annotated us-
ing automatic tools as a starting point. Despite the
widespread use of this annotation pipeline, there is,
to our knowledge, little prior work on syntactic an-
notation quality and on the reliability of system eval-
uations on such data.

In this work, we present a systematic study of the
influence of automatic tool output on characteristics
of annotations created for NLP purposes. Our in-
vestigation is motivated by the hypothesis that anno-
tations obtained using such methodologies may be

subject to the problem of anchoring, a well estab-
lished and robust cognitive bias in which human de-
cisions are affected by pre-existing values (Tversky
and Kahneman, 1974). In the presence of anchors,
participants reason relative to the existing values,
and as a result may provide different solutions from
those they would have reported otherwise. Most
commonly, anchoring is manifested as an alignment
towards the given values.

Focusing on the key NLP tasks of POS tagging
and dependency parsing, we demonstrate that the
standard approach of obtaining annotations via hu-
man correction of automatically generated POS tags
and dependencies exhibits a clear anchoring effect –
a phenomenon we refer to as parser bias. Given this
evidence, we examine two potential adverse impli-
cations of this effect on parser-based gold standards.

First, we show that parser bias entails substantial
overestimation of parser performance. In particu-
lar, we demonstrate that bias towards the output of
a specific tagger-parser pair leads to over-estimation
of the performance of these tools relative to other
tools. Moreover, we observe general performance
gains for automatic tools relative to their perfor-
mance on human-based gold standards. Second, we
study whether parser bias affects the quality of the
resulting gold standards. Extending the experimen-
tal setup of Marcus et al. (1993), we demonstrate
that parser bias may lead to lower annotation qual-
ity for parser-based annotations compared to human-
based annotations.

Furthermore, we conduct an experiment on inter-
annotator agreement for POS tagging and depen-
dency parsing which controls for parser bias. Our
experiment on a subset of section 23 of the WSJ
Penn Treebank yields agreement rates of 95.65 for
POS tagging and 94.17 for dependency parsing.
This result is significant in light of the state of the
art tagging and parsing performance for English
newswire. With parsing reaching the level of human
agreement, and tagging surpassing it, a more thor-
ough examination of evaluation resources and eval-
uation methodologies for these tasks is called for.

To summarize, we present the first study to mea-
sure and analyze anchoring in the standard parser-
based approach to creation of gold standards for
POS tagging and dependency parsing in NLP. We
conclude that gold standard annotations that are

based on editing output of automatic tools can lead
to inaccurate figures in system evaluations and lower
annotation quality. Our human agreement experi-
ment, which controls for parser bias, yields agree-
ment rates that are comparable to state of the art
automatic tagging and dependency parsing perfor-
mance, highlighting the need for a more extensive
investigation of tagger and parser evaluation in NLP.

2 Experimental Setup

2.1 Annotation Tasks

We examine two standard annotation tasks in NLP,
POS tagging and dependency parsing. In the POS
tagging task, each word in a sentence has to be cate-
gorized with a Penn Treebank POS tag (Santorini,
1990) (henceforth POS). The dependency parsing
task consists of providing a sentence with a labeled
dependency tree using the Universal Dependencies
(UD) formalism (De Marneffe et al., 2014), accord-
ing to version 1 of the UD English guidelines2. To
perform this task, the annotator is required to specify
the head word index (henceforth HIND) and relation
label (henceforth REL) of each word in the sentence.

We distinguish between three variants of these
tasks, annotation, reviewing and ranking. In the an-
notation variant, participants are asked to conduct
annotation from scratch. In the reviewing variant,
they are asked to provide alternative annotations for
all annotation tokens with which they disagree. The
participants are not informed about the source of the
given annotation, which, depending on the experi-
mental condition can be either parser output or hu-
man annotation. In the ranking task, the participants
rank several annotation options with respect to their
quality. Similarly to the review task, the participants
are not given the sources of the different annotation
options. Participants performing the annotation, re-
viewing and ranking tasks are referred to as annota-
tors, reviewers and judges, respectively.

2.2 Annotation Format

All annotation tasks are performed using a CoNLL
style text-based template, in which each word ap-
pears in a separate line. The first two columns of
each line contain the word index and the word, re-

2http://universaldependencies.org/#en

spectively. The next three columns are designated
for annotation of POS, HIND and REL.

In the annotation task, these values have to be
specified by the annotator from scratch. In the
review task, participants are required to edit pre-
annotated values for a given sentence. The sixth col-
umn in the review template contains an additional
# sign, whose goal is to prevent reviewers from
overlooking and passively approving existing anno-
tations. Corrections are specified following this sign
in a space separated format, where each of the exist-
ing three annotation tokens is either corrected with
an alternative annotation value or approved using a
* sign. Approval of all three annotation tokens is
marked by removing the # sign. The example be-
low presents a fragment from a sentence used for the
reviewing task, in which the reviewer approves the
annotations of all the words, with the exception of
“help”, where the POS is corrected from VB to NN
and the relation label xcomp is replaced with dobj.

...
5 you PRP 6 nsubj
6 need VBP 3 ccomp
7 help VB 6 xcomp # NN * dobj
...

The format of the ranking task is exemplified be-
low. The annotation options are presented to the par-
ticipants in a random order. Participants specify the
rank of each annotation token following the vertical
bar. In this sentence, the label cop is preferred over
aux for the word “be” and xcomp is preferred over
advcl for the word “Common”.

...
8 it PRP 10 nsubjpass
9 is VBZ 10 auxpass
10 planed VBN 0 root
11 to TO 15 mark
12 be VB 15 aux-cop | 2-1
13 in IN 15 case
14 Wimbledon NNP 15 compound
15 Common NNP 10 advcl-xcomp | 2-1
...

The participants used basic validation scripts
which checked for typos and proper formatting of
the annotations, reviews and rankings.

2.3 Evaluation Metrics

We measure both parsing performance and inter-
annotator agreement using tagging and parsing eval-
uation metrics. This choice allows for a direct com-
parison between parsing and agreement results. In
this context, POS refers to tagging accuracy. We
utilize the standard metrics Unlabeled Attachment
Score (UAS) and Label Accuracy (LA) to measure
accuracy of head attachment and dependency labels.
We also utilize the standard parsing metric Labeled
Attachment Score (LAS), which takes into account
both dependency arcs and dependency labels. In all
our parsing and agreement experiments, we exclude
punctuation tokens from the evaluation.

2.4 Corpora

We use sentences from two publicly available
datasets, covering two different genres. The first
corpus, used in the experiments in sections 3 and
4, is the First Certificate in English (FCE) Cam-
bridge Learner Corpus (Yannakoudakis et al., 2011).
This dataset contains essays authored by upper-
intermediate level English learners3.

The second corpus is the WSJ part of the Penn
Treebank (WSJ PTB) (Marcus et al., 1993). Since
its release, this dataset has been the most commonly
used resource for training and evaluation of English
parsers. Our experiment on inter-annotator agree-
ment in section 5 uses a random subset of the sen-
tences in section 23 of the WSJ PTB, which is tradi-
tionally reserved for tagging and parsing evaluation.

2.5 Annotators

We recruited five students at MIT as annotators.
Three of the students are linguistics majors and
two are engineering majors with linguistics minors.
Prior to participating in this study, the annotators
completed two months of training. During training,
the students attended tutorials, and learned the an-
notation guidelines for PTB POS tags, UD guide-
lines, as well as guidelines for annotating challeng-
ing syntactic structures arising from grammatical er-
rors. The students also annotated individually six

matical errors. These results were replicated on the error cor-
rected versions of the sentences.

practice batches of 20-30 sentences from the En-
glish Web Treebank (EWT) (Silveira et al., 2014)
and FCE corpora, and resolved annotation disagree-
ments during group meetings.

Following the training period, the students anno-
tated a treebank of learner English (Berzak et al.,
2016) over a period of five months, three of which
as a full time job. During this time, the students
continued attending weekly meetings in which fur-
ther annotation challenges were discussed and re-
solved. The annotation was carried out for sentences
from the FCE dataset, where both the original and
error corrected versions of each sentence were an-
notated and reviewed. In the course of the anno-
tation project, each annotator completed approxi-
mately 800 sentence annotations, and a similar num-
ber of sentence reviews. The annotations and re-
views were done in the same format used in this
study. With respect to our experiments, the exten-
sive experience of our participants and their prior
work as a group strengthen our results, as these char-
acteristics reduce the effect of anchoring biases and
increase inter-annotator agreement.

3 Parser Bias

Our first experiment is designed to test whether ex-
pert human annotators are biased towards POS tags
and dependencies generated by automatic tools. We
examine the common out-of-domain annotation sce-
nario, where automatic tools are often trained on an
existing treebank in one domain, and used to gener-
ate initial annotations to speed-up the creation of a
gold standard for a new domain. We use the EWT
UD corpus as the existing gold standard, and a sam-
ple of the FCE dataset as the new corpus.

Procedure
Our experimental procedure, illustrated in figure

1(a) contains a set of 360 sentences (6,979 tokens)
from the FCE, for which we generate three gold
standards: one based on human annotations and two
based on parser outputs. To this end, for each sen-
tence, we assign at random four of the participants to
the following annotation and review tasks. The fifth
participant is left out to perform the quality ranking
task described in section 4.

The first participant annotates the sentence from
scratch, and a second participant reviews this an-

each sentence, five human annotators are assigned at random

to one of three roles: annotation, review or quality assessment.

In the bias experiment, presented in section 3, every sentence

is annotated by a human, Turbo parser (based on Turbo tag-

ger output) and RBG parser (based on Stanford tagger output).

Each annotation is reviewed by a different human participant to

produce three gold standards of each sentence: “Human Gold”,

“Turbo Gold” and “RBG Gold”. The fifth annotator performs

a quality assessment task described in section 4, which requires

to rank the three gold standards in cases of disagreement.

notation. The overall agreement of the reviewers
with the annotators is 98.24 POS, 97.16 UAS, 96.3
LA and 94.81 LAS. The next two participants re-
view parser outputs. One participant reviews an an-
notation generated by the Turbo tagger and parser
(Martins et al., 2013). The other participant reviews
the output of the Stanford tagger (Toutanova et al.,
2003) and RBG parser (Lei et al., 2014). The taggers
and parsers were trained on the gold annotations of
the EWT UD treebank, version 1.1. Both parsers use
predicted POS tags for the FCE sentences.

Assigning the reviews to the human annotations
yields a human based gold standard for each sen-
tence called “Human Gold”. Assigning the reviews
to the tagger and parser outputs yields two parser-
based gold standards, “Turbo Gold” and “RBG
Gold”. We chose the Turbo-Turbo and Stanford-
RBG tagger-parser pairs as these tools obtain com-
parable performance on standard evaluation bench-

marks, while yielding substantially different anno-
tations due to different training algorithms and fea-
ture sets. For our sentences, the agreement be-
tween the Turbo tagger and Stanford tagger is 96.97
POS. The agreement between the Turbo parser and
RBG parser based on the respective tagger outputs
is 90.76 UAS, 91.6 LA and 87.34 LAS.

Parser Specific and Parser Shared Bias
In order to test for parser bias, in table 1 we

compare the performance of the Turbo-Turbo and
Stanford-RBG tagger-parser pairs on our three gold
standards. First, we observe that while these tools
perform equally well on Human Gold, each tagger-
parser pair performs better than the other on its own
reviews. These parser specific performance gaps are
substantial, with an average of 1.15 POS, 2.63 UAS,
2.34 LA and 3.88 LAS between the two conditions.
This result suggests the presence of a bias towards
the output of specific tagger-parser combinations.
The practical implication of this outcome is that a
gold standard created by editing an output of a parser
is likely to boost the performance of that parser in
evaluations and over-estimate its performance rela-
tive to other parsers.

Second, we note that the performance of each of
the parsers on the gold standard of the other parser is
still higher than its performance on the human gold
standard. The average performance gap between
these conditions is 1.08 POS, 1.66 UAS, 1.66 LA
and 2.47 LAS. This difference suggests an annota-
tion bias towards shared aspects in the predictions

of taggers and parsers, which differ from the human
based annotations. The consequence of this obser-
vation is that irrespective of the specific tool that
was used to pre-annotate the data, parser-based gold
standards are likely to result in higher parsing per-
formance relative to human-based gold standards.

Taken together, the parser specific and parser
shared effects lead to a dramatic overall average er-
ror reduction of 49.18% POS, 33.71% UAS, 34.9%
LA and 35.61% LAS on the parser-based gold stan-
dards compared to the human-based gold standard.
To the best of our knowledge, these results are the
first systematic demonstration of the tendency of the
common approach of parser-based creation of gold
standards to yield biased annotations and lead to
overestimation of tagging and parsing performance.

4 Annotation Quality

In this section we extend our investigation to ex-
amine the impact of parser bias on the quality of
parser-based gold standards. To this end, we per-
form a manual comparison between human-based
and parser-based gold standards.

Our quality assessment experiment, depicted
schematically in figure 1(b), is a ranking task. For
each sentence, a randomly chosen judge, who did
not annotate or review the given sentence, ranks dis-
agreements between the three gold standards Human
Gold, Turbo Gold and RBG Gold, generated in the
parser bias experiment in section 3.

Table 2 presents the preference rates of judges

for the human-based gold standard over each of the
two parser-based gold standards. In all three eval-
uation categories, human judges tend to prefer the
human-based gold standard over both parser-based
gold standards. This result demonstrates that the ini-
tial reduced quality of the parser outputs compared
to human annotations indeed percolates via anchor-
ing to the resulting gold standards.

The analysis of the quality assessment experi-
ment thus far did not distinguish between cases
where the two parsers agree and where they dis-
agree. In order to gain further insight into the rela-
tion between parser bias and annotation quality, we
break down the results reported in table 2 into two
cases which relate directly to the parser specific and
parser shared components of the tagging and pars-
ing performance gaps observed in the parser bias re-
sults reported in section 3. In the first case, called
“parser specific approval”, a reviewer approves a
parser annotation which disagrees both with the out-
put of the other parser and the Human Gold anno-
tation. In the second case, called “parser shared ap-
proval”, a reviewer approves a parser output which
is shared by both parsers but differs with respect to
Human Gold.

Table 3 presents the judge preference rates for the
Human-Gold annotations in these two scenarios. We
observe that cases in which the parsers disagree are
of substantially worse quality compared to human-
based annotations. However, in cases of agreement
between the parsers, the resulting gold standards do
not exhibit a clear disadvantage relative to the Hu-
man Gold annotations.

This result highlights the crucial role of parser

tween the two parsers. Parser specific approval are cases in

which a parser output approved by the reviewer differs from

both the output of the other parser and the Human Gold anno-

tation. Parser shared approval denotes cases where an approved

parser output is identical to the output of the other parser but dif-

fers from the Human Gold annotation. Statistically significant

values for a two-tailed Z test with p < 0.01 are marked with

specific approval in the overall preference of judges
towards human-based annotations in table 2. Fur-
thermore, it suggests that annotations on which mul-
tiple state of the art parsers agree are of sufficiently
high accuracy to be used to save annotation time
without substantial impact on the quality of the re-
sulting resource. In section 7 we propose an annota-
tion scheme which leverages this insight.

5 Inter-annotator Agreement

Agreement estimates in NLP are often obtained in
annotation setups where both annotators edit the
same automatically generated input. However, in
such experimental conditions, anchoring can intro-
duce cases of spurious disagreement as well as spu-
rious agreement between annotators due to align-
ment of one or both participants towards the given
input. The initial quality of the provided annotations
in combination with the parser bias effect observed
in section 3 may influence the resulting agreement
estimates. For example, in Marcus et al. (1993) an-
notators were shown to produce POS tagging agree-
ment of 92.8 on annotation from scratch, compared
to 96.5 on reviews of tagger output.

Our goal in this section is to obtain estimates for
inter-annotator agreement on POS tagging and de-
pendency parsing that control for parser bias, and

2220



as a result, reflect more accurately human agree-
ment on these tasks. We thus introduce a novel
pipeline based on human annotation only, which
eliminates parser bias from the agreement measure-
ments. Our experiment extends the human-based an-
notation study of Marcus et al. (1993) to include
also syntactic trees. Importantly, we include an ad-
ditional review step for the initial annotations, de-
signed to increase the precision of the agreement
measurements by reducing the number of errors in
the original annotations.

Figure 2: Experimental setup for the inter-annotator agreement
experiment. 300 sentences (7,227 tokens) from section 23 of

the PTB-WSJ are annotated and reviewed by four participants.

The participants are assigned to the following tasks at random

for each sentence. Two participants annotate the sentence from

scratch, and the remaining two participants review one of these

annotations each. Agreement is measured on the annotations

(“scratch”) as well after assigning the review edits (“scratch re-

viewed”).

For this experiment, we use 300 sentences (7,227
tokens) from section 23 of the PTB-WSJ, the stan-
dard test set for English parsing in NLP. The exper-
imental setup, depicted graphically in figure 2, in-
cludes four participants randomly assigned for each
sentence to annotation and review tasks. Two of the
participants provide the sentence with annotations
from scratch, while the remaining two participants
provide reviews. Each reviewer edits one of the
annotations independently, allowing for correction
of annotation errors while maintaining the indepen-
dence of the annotation sources. We measure agree-
ment between the initial annotations (“scratch”), as
well as the agreement between the reviewed versions
of our sentences (“scratch reviewed”).

The agreement results for the annotations and the
reviews are presented in table 4. The initial agree-

ment rate on POS annotation from scratch is higher
than in (Marcus et al., 1993). This difference is
likely to arise, at least in part, due to the fact that
their experiment was conducted at the beginning
of the annotation project, when the annotators had
a more limited annotation experience compared to
our participants. Overall, we note that the agree-
ment rates from scratch are relatively low. The re-
view round raises the agreement on all the evalua-
tion categories due to elimination of annotation er-
rors present the original annotations.

kens) from the PTB-WSJ section 23. “scratch” is agreement

on independent annotations from scratch. “scratch reviewed” is

agreement on the same sentences after an additional indepen-

dent review round of the annotations.

Our post-review agreement results are consequen-
tial in light of the current state of the art performance
on tagging and parsing in NLP. For more than a
decade, POS taggers have been achieving over 97%
accuracy with the PTB POS tag set on the PTB-WSJ
test set. For example, the best model of the Stanford
tagger reported in Toutanova et al. (2003) produces
an accuracy of 97.24 POS on sections 22-24 of the
PTB-WSJ. These accuracies are above the human
agreement in our experiment.

With respect to dependency parsing, recent
parsers obtain results which are on par or higher than
our inter-annotator agreement estimates. For exam-
ple, Weiss et al. (2015) report 94.26 UAS and An-
dor et al. (2016) report 94.61 UAS on section 23
of the PTB-WSJ using an automatic conversion of
the PTB phrase structure trees to Stanford depen-
dencies (De Marneffe et al., 2006). These results
are not fully comparable to ours due to differences
in the utilized dependency formalism and the auto-
matic conversion of the annotations. Nonetheless,
we believe that the similarities in the tasks and eval-
uation data are sufficiently strong to indicate that
dependency parsing for standard English newswire
may be reaching human agreement levels.

6 Related Work

The term “anchoring” was coined in a seminal paper
by Tversky and Kahneman (1974), which demon-
strated that numerical estimation can be biased by
uninformative prior information. Subsequent work
across various domains of decision making con-
firmed the robustness of anchoring using both in-
formative and uninformative anchors (Furnham and
Boo, 2011). Pertinent to our study, anchoring bi-
ases were also demonstrated when the participants
were domain experts, although to a lesser degree
than in the early anchoring experiments (Wilson et
al., 1996; Mussweiler and Strack, 2000).

Prior work in NLP examined the influence of
pre-tagging (Fort and Sagot, 2010) and pre-parsing
(Skjærholt, 2013) on human annotations. Our work
introduces a systematic study of this topic using a
novel experimental framework as well as substan-
tially more sentences and annotators. Differently
from these studies, our methodology enables charac-
terizing annotation bias as anchoring and measuring
its effect on tagger and parser evaluations.

Our study also extends the POS tagging exper-
iments of Marcus et al. (1993), which compared
inter-annotator agreement and annotation quality on
manual POS tagging in annotation from scratch and
tagger-based review conditions. The first result re-
ported in that study was that tagger-based editing in-
creases inter-annotator agreement compared to an-
notation from scratch. Our work provides a novel
agreement benchmark for POS tagging which re-
duces annotation errors through a review process
while controlling for tagger bias, and obtains agree-
ment measurements for dependency parsing. The
second result reported in Marcus et al. (1993) was
that tagger-based edits are of higher quality com-
pared to annotations from scratch when evaluated
against an additional independent annotation. We
modify this experiment by introducing ranking as an
alternative mechanism for quality assessment, and
adding a review round for human annotations from
scratch. Our experiment demonstrates that in this
configuration, parser-based annotations are of lower
quality compared to human-based annotations.

Several estimates of expert inter-annotator agree-
ment for English parsing were previously reported.
However, most such evaluations were conducted us-

ing annotation setups that can be affected by an
anchoring bias (Carroll et al., 1999; Rambow et
al., 2002; Silveira et al., 2014). A notable excep-
tion is the study of Sampson and Babarczy (2008)
who measure agreement on annotation from scratch
for English parsing in the SUSANNE framework
(Sampson, 1995). The reported results, however,
are not directly comparable to ours, due to the use
of a substantially different syntactic representation,
as well as a different agreement metric. Their study
further suggests that despite the high expertise of the
annotators, the main source of annotation disagree-
ments was annotation errors. Our work alleviates
this issue by using annotation reviews, which reduce
the number of erroneous annotations while main-
taining the independence of the annotation sources.
Experiments on non-expert dependency annotation
from scratch were previously reported for French,
suggesting low agreement rates (79%) with an ex-
pert annotation benchmark (Gerdes, 2013).

7 Discussion

We present a systematic study of the impact of an-
choring on POS and dependency annotations used
in NLP, demonstrating that annotators exhibit an an-
choring bias effect towards the output of automatic
annotation tools. This bias leads to an artificial boost
of performance figures for the parsers in question
and results in lower annotation quality as compared
with human-based annotations.

Our analysis demonstrates that despite the adverse
effects of parser bias, predictions that are shared
across different parsers do not significantly lower the
quality of the annotations. This finding gives rise
to the following hybrid annotation strategy as a po-
tential future alternative to human-based as well as
parser-based annotation pipelines. In a hybrid anno-
tation setup, human annotators review annotations
on which several parsers agree, and complete the re-
maining annotations from scratch. Such a strategy
would largely maintain the annotation speed-ups of
parser-based annotation schemes. At the same time,
it is expected to achieve annotation quality compa-
rable to human-based annotation by avoiding parser
specific bias, which plays a pivotal role in the re-
duced quality of single-parser reviewing pipelines.

Further on, we obtain, to the best of our knowl-

edge for the first time, syntactic inter-annotator
agreement measurements on WSJ-PTB sentences.
Our experimental procedure reduces annotation er-
rors and controls for parser bias. Despite the de-
tailed annotation guidelines, the extensive experi-
ence of our annotators, and their prior work as a
group, our experiment indicates rather low agree-
ment rates, which are below state of the art tagging
performance and on par with state of the art parsing
results on this dataset. We note that our results do
not necessarily reflect an upper bound on the achiev-
able syntactic inter-annotator agreement for English
newswire. Higher agreement rates could in princi-
ple be obtained through further annotator training,
refinement and revision of annotation guidelines, as
well as additional automatic validation tests for the
annotations. Nonetheless, we believe that our esti-
mates reliably reflect a realistic scenario of expert
syntactic annotation.

The obtained agreement rates call for a more ex-
tensive examination of annotator disagreements on
parsing and tagging. Recent work in this area has
already proposed an analysis of expert annotator dis-
agreements for POS tagging in the absence of anno-
tation guidelines (Plank et al., 2014). Our annota-
tions will enable conducting such studies for annota-
tion with guidelines, and support extending this line
of investigation to annotations of syntactic depen-
dencies. As a first step towards this goal, we plan
to carry out an in-depth analysis of disagreement
in the collected data, characterize the main sources
of inconsistent annotation and subsequently formu-
late further strategies for improving annotation ac-
curacy. We believe that better understanding of hu-
man disagreements and their relation to disagree-
ments between humans and parsers will also con-
tribute to advancing evaluation methodologies for
POS tagging and syntactic parsing in NLP, an im-
portant topic that has received only limited attention
thus far (Schwartz et al., 2011; Plank et al., 2015).

Finally, since the release of the Penn Treebank in
1992, it has been serving as the standard benchmark
for English parsing evaluation. Over the past few
years, improvements in parsing performance on this
dataset were obtained in small increments, and are
commonly reported without a linguistic analysis of
the improved predictions. As dependency parsing
performance on English newswire may be reaching

human expert agreement, not only new evaluation
practices, but also more attention to noisier domains
and other languages may be in place.
