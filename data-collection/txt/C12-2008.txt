ABSTRACT
Cross-Lingual Sentiment Analysis (CLSA) is the task of predicting the polarity of the opinion
expressed in a text in a language Ltest using a classifier trained on the corpus of another language
Lt rain. Popular approaches use Machine Translation (MT) to convert the test document in Ltest
to Lt rain and use the classifier of Lt rain. However, MT systems do not exist for most pairs of
languages and even if they do, their translation accuracy is low. So we present an alternative
approach to CLSA using WordNet senses as features for supervised sentiment classification. A
document in Ltest is tested for polarity through a classifier trained on sense marked and polarity
labeled corpora of Lt rain. The crux of the idea is to use the linked WordNets of two languages to
bridge the language gap. We report our results on two widely spoken Indian languages, Hindi
(450 million speakers) and Marathi (72 million speakers), which do not have an MT system
between them. The sense-based approach gives a CLSA accuracy of 72% and 84% for Hindi
and Marathi sentiment classification respectively. This is an improvement of 14%-15% over an
approach that uses a bilingual dictionary.

1 Introduction

Sentiment Analysis (SA) is the task of inferring polarity of an opinion in a text. Though the
majority of the work in SA is for English, there has been work in other languages as well such
as Chinese, Japanese, German and Spanish (Seki et al., 2007; Nakagawa et al., 2010; Schulz
et al., 2010). To perform SA on these languages, cross-lingual approaches are often used due to
the lack of annotated content in these languages. In Cross-Lingual Sentiment Analysis (CLSA),
the training corpus in one language (call it Lt rain) is used to predict the sentiment of documents
in another language (call it Ltest). Machine Translation is often employed for CLSA (Wan,
2009; Wei and Pal, 2010). A document in Ltest is translated into Lt rain and is checked for
polarity using the classifier trained on the polarity marked documents of Lt rain. However, MT is
resource-intensive and does not exist for most pairs of languages.

WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) is a widely used lexical resource in the NLP community and is
present in many languages.1 Most of the WordNets are developed using the expansion based
approach (Vossen, 1998; Bhattacharyya, 2010) wherein a new WordNet for a target language
(Lt) is created by adding words which represent the corresponding synsets in the source
language (Ls) WordNet. As a consequence, corresponding concepts in Ls and Lt have the same
synset (concept) identifier. Our work leverages this fact, and uses WordNet senses as features
for building a classifier in Lt rain. The document to be tested for polarity is preprocessed by
replacing words in this document with the corresponding synset identifiers. This step eliminates
the distinction between Lt rain and Ltest as far as the document is concerned. The document
vector created from the sense-based features could belong to any language. The preprocessed
document is then given to the classifier coming from Lt rain for polarity detection.

This work is an extension our sense-based SA work on English (Balamurali et al., 2011) where
we showed that WordNet synset-based features perform better than word-based features for
sentiment analysis. Here, we carry out our study on two widely spoken Indian languages:
Hindi and Marathi. These languages belong to the Indo-Aryan subgroup of the Indo-European
language family. For these two languages, we first verify the superiority of sense-based features
over word-based features for SA. Thereafter we proceed to verify the efficacy of the sense-based
approach for cross-lingual sentiment analysis for these two languages. This work differs from
existing works(Brooke et al., 2009; Wan, 2009; Wei and Pal, 2010; Banea et al., 2008) on
CLSA in two aspects: (i) our focus is not necessarily to use a resource-rich language to help a
resource-scarce language but can be applied to any two languages which share a common sense
space (by using WordNets with matching synset identifiers); (ii) our work is an alternative
to MT-based cross-lingual sentiment analysis for languages which do not have an MT system
between them.

2 Background Study: Word Senses for SA

In our previous work (Balamurali et al., 2011), we showed that word senses act as better
features than lexeme-based features for document level SA. We termed this feature space as
synset space or sense space. In the sense space, the semantics of document is represented in a
compact way using synset identifiers.

Different variants of a travel review domain corpus are generated by using automatic/manual
sense disambiguation techniques. Thereafter, classification accuracy of classifiers based on

74



different sense-based and word-based features were compared. The experimental results show
that WordNet senses act as better features compared to words alone.

The following subsection validates this hypothesis for Hindi and Marathi. Since the documents
for training and testing belong to the same language, we refer to this set of classification
experiments as in-language sentiment classification.

2.1 WordNet Senses as Better Features: Approach

A classifier is trained for each of the following feature representations: Words (W), Manually
annotated word senses (M), Automatically annotated word senses (I), Words and manually an-
notated word senses (W+S(M)) and Words and automatically annotated word senses (W+S(I)).
At present, the development of Hindi and Marathi WordNets is not complete. Thus, a number
of words belonging to open POS categories ( e.g. nouns) do not have corresponding synsets
created. We used W+S(M) and W+S(I) representations in order to alleviate problems that can
arise due to these missing synsets.

We perform our experiments on the above feature representations for in-language sentiment
classification and compare their performance. The results are discussed in section 6.1.

3 Word Senses for Cross-Lingual SA

We now describe our approach to cross-lingual SA, which is the focus of this work. This
approach harnesses word senses to build a supervised sentiment classifier in a cross-lingual
setting (i.e., when the Lt rain and Ltest are different).

Our baseline as well as sense-based approach center around the WordNets of the two languages
viz., Hindi and Marathi. WordNets of Hindi and Marathi have been developed using an
expansion approach. This approach involves expanding the Marathi WordNet by adding concept
definition for concepts from Hindi WordNet. Subsequently, corresponding related terms are
added and mapped. Thus, corresponding concepts/synsets in WordNets of both languages have
the same synset identifier. Once this mapping is completed, concepts found only in the target
language are added.

An instance of WordNets which are collectively developed for multiple languages is referred to
as Multidict (Mohanty et al., 2008). In a Multidict, each row constitutes a concept, identified
by a synset identifier.

Figure 1: An example entry (concept: holiday) in Multidict for Hindi and Marathi

Each column contains synonymous terms representing these concepts in different languages.
Further, a manual cross link is provided between words in one language to another based on
their lexical preference.

The words in the corresponding synsets are thus translations of each other in specific contexts.
For example, an entry pertaining to Marathi and Hindi can be explained as follows ( Figure 1):

75



13104 (Synset identifier) pertains to the concept of holiday and its related terms are suTTee and
ruh-jaa in Marathi and chuTTee and avkasha in Hindi. The cross links shown in the above entry
indicates that when the Marathi word suTTee is used in the sense represented by the synset
identifier 13104, its exact Hindi translation is chuTTee (i.e., this translation is more preferred
over the other related Hindi words of the same synset).

3.1 Our Approach: Sense-based Representation
Following the fact that the Hindi and Marathi WordNet have the same synset identifier for the
same concept, we represent words in the two languages by corresponding synset identifiers.

Thus, in a cross-lingual setting for a given target language, we map the words of the training as
well as the test corpus to their WordNet synset identifiers. A classification model is learnt on
the training corpus and tested on the test corpus. Both corpora consists of synset identifiers.
This experiment is performed for two variants of the corpora: one with manually annotated
senses and another with automatically annotated senses. Thus, in the context of using senses as
features for cross-lingual sentiment analysis, we evaluate the following approaches: 1. A group
of word senses that have been manually annotated (M), 2. A group of word senses that have
been annotated by an automatic Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) engine (I).

The replacement of a word by its synset identifier is carried out for all documents in the training
corpus and the test corpus. The representation of the new corpora is in a common feature space,
i.e., the sense space.

3.2 Baseline: Naïve Translation Using Lexeme Replacement
MT-based techniques have been the main way of performing cross-lingual SA (Wan, 2009;
Wei and Pal, 2010). The obvious choice for a baseline to compare our approach would have
been a MT based CLSA approach. However, at present, there exists no Hindi-Marathi MT
system. Hence we develop a strategy for obtaining a naïve translation of the corpus-based on
lexical transfer which forms the baseline for comparing sentiment classification accuracy of the
proposed cross-lingual SA based on synset representation.

Our approach consists of converting a document from the Ltest to the Lt rain so that a classifier
modeled on documents from the training language can be used. The words in the test documents
are mapped to the corresponding words in the training language to obtain a naïve translation.
No semantic/syntactic transfer is maintained. We use Multidict to translate synonymous terms
in different languages, namely Hindi and Marathi (Mohanty et al., 2008). We offer two versions
which differ from each other based on the replacement lexeme chosen.

Exact word replacement (E): Based on the disambiguated sense identifier, the exact cross-
linked word from the source language is used for the replacement. Hence, for the word suTTee,
the translation chuTTee will be selected ( Figure 1).

Random word replacement (R): Based on the disambiguated sense identifier, the cross linked
word from the source language is used for the replacement. This word in Figure 1 is not
necessarily the exact (preferred) translation as mentioned above. For example, for the word
suTTee, some random translation from the same synset will be selected, for example ruh-jaa,
instead of the preferred translation chuTTee (Figure 1) will be selected.

The replacement is carried out for all documents in the test corpus (originally in Ltest) to
generate a new test corpus (containing words in Lt rain). We understand this naïve translation

76



may not give as strong a baseline as a statistical MT-based approach, but given the state of these
languages, we believe the results obtained are fairly comparable.

4 Datasets

The dataset we created for Hindi and Marathi consists of user-written travel destination reviews.
We collected them from various blogs and Sunday travel editorials. A review consists of
approximately 4-5 sentences of 10-15 words each. The Hindi corpus consists of approximately
100 positive and 100 negative reviews while the Marathi corpus consists of approximately 75
positive and 75 negative reviews. The documents are labeled with polarity (positive/negative)
by a native speaker.

To create the manual sense-annotated corpus, the words were manually annotated by a native
speaker. Based on the word and POS category, the annotation tool shows all possible sense
entries for that word in the WordNet. The lexicographer then chooses the right sense based
on the context. Hindi corpora contains 11038 words whereas Marathi corpora contains 12566
words. To generate automatic sense-annotated corpus, we use the engine based on the IWSD
algorithm, which is trained on the tourism domain and can operate on Hindi, Marathi and
English. We chose the travel review domain for our analysis because the IWSD engine was
trained on this domain.

Tables 1 and 2 show the evaluation of sense disambiguation statistics for IWSD for Hindi and

5 Experimental Setup

The experiments are performed using C-SVM (linear kernel with default parameters; C=0.0,
ε=0.0010) available as a part of LibSVM package.2 We chose SVM as its known to be a good
learner for sentiment classification (Pang and Lee, 2002).

To conduct experiments on words as features, we perform stop-word removal and word
stemming. For synset-based experiments, words in the corpus are substituted with synset
identifiers along with POS categories, which are used as features. To create automatically
sense-annotated corpora, we use the state-of-the-art domain specific word sense disambiguation
(IWSD) algorithm by Khapra et al. (2010) for sense disambiguating our datasets in the two
languages.

The results are evaluated using commonly used classification metrics: classification accuracy,
Fscore, recall and precision. Recall and precision for each polarity label is also calculated for
analysis.

For our background study experiments pertaining to the in-language sentiment classification, a
two-fold validation of five repeats is carried out. Each repeat consists of a random configuration

77



of test/train documents maintained across different representations for a given run. Such a
cross-fold validation is taken to minimize the variance between the classification results of
different folds since the sizes of the corpus are not that large (Dietterich, 1998).

6 Results and Discussions

Our results are divided into two parts. Section 6.1 shows the results related to our background
study pertaining to in-language sentiment classification. In section 6.2, we compare the
approaches for cross-lingual sentiment analysis.

6.1 In-language Classification

The results of in-language classification for Marathi and Hindi are shown in Table 33. We
consider unigram words as the baseline (Words) for comparison. Note that since cross-lingual
SA using ‘perfect’ translation from target to source language is identical to in-language sentiment
classification, these results act as an upper bound/skyline to the performance of cross-lingual SA.
While using sense-based features, we also use the POS information and hence to have a fair
comparison, we use an additional baseline which include the POS information in addition to
unigram features (represented as Words + POS).

mance for Marathi and Hindi; PF-Positive F-score, NF-Negative F-score, PP-Positive Precision(%),

Overall Sentiment Classification:

All sense-based features give a higher overall accuracy than the baseline for both Marathi and
Hindi. The baseline for Hindi is lower than that for Marathi. However, manually annotated
sense-based features perform better than the baseline by 11.3% for Marathi and 6.7% for Hindi.
The classification accuracy of the combination of manually annotated synsets and words is
comparable to that of manually annotated synsets for both the languages.

As expected, automatic sense disambiguation-based features perform better than the baseline
but lower than manually annotated features. For Marathi, the classification accuracy for

Sense (M) and Words + Sense (M) results are not significant. Same is the case for Sense (I) and Words + Sense (I) for
Hindi.

78



automatic sense disambiguation-based representation degrades by 4% below the manually
annotated counterpart. This degradation is less significant in case of Hindi as the overall
accuracy of Hindi sense disambiguation engine is only 66% (refer to Table 1). This suggests
that even a low accuracy sense disambiguation may be sufficient to obtain better results than
word based features.

Positive Recall (%), NR-Negative Recall (%)

Sense based CLSA accuracy along with the baseline accuracy is shown in Table 44.

Ltest - Marathi: In-language classification accuracy for Marathi using words as features is only
86.53% (refer to Table 3). In a way, this forms the upper bound for a perfectly translated
document. In the case of the naïve translation-based approach, an accuracy of 71.64% and
70.15% for Words (E) and Words (R) is obtained respectively. Both the manually and the
automatically annotated sense-based features show an improvement of 12% (approximately)
over both the baselines.

Ltest - Hindi: When Hindi is the target language, the baseline using lexeme replacement is lower
than the baseline for Marathi. An approximate 15% improvement over the baseline is observed
for manually annotated sense-based features (which has an accuracy of 72%). Sense-based
features developed using automatic sense disambiguation work with a lower accuracy with
respect to manually annotated synsets.

A considerable improvement in the positive recall can be seen for Hindi as the target language.
The same can be said about the negative precision. These results highlight the effectiveness of
synsets as features for negative sentiment detection in a cross-lingual setup.

As most of the Indian languages do not have MT systems between them, we believe this
approach can be an alternative to MT based CLSA approaches. Our approach is at par with MT
based CLSA approach as our results are not far behind the in-language classification results.
Hence MT based CLSA approaches are comparable with our approach as they too fall behind
in-language classification results (based on the results of an independent study).

4 All results are statistically significant with respect to the baseline. However, baseline 1 and baseline 2 are not
statistically significant and so is the case for Sense (M) and Sense(I) accuracy figures for Marathi (as Ltest )

79



Effect of Automatic WSD on Classification Accuracy

Sense annotation accuracy (Fscore) of the WSD engine used for annotating the words with
their respective sense is 65% and 76% (Tables 1 and 2) for Hindi and Marathi respectively.
Annotation accuracy is less for Hindi as there are more finer senses in Hindi WordNet than in
Marathi WordNet. Thus, there is a higher chance of assigning an incorrect sense for a word in
Hindi than compared to a word in Marathi. However, the fall in classification accuracy due to
this reason is not reflected on the in-language sentiment classification accuracy of Hindi and
Marathi respectively. Nevertheless, there is a drop in the cross lingual accuracy when Ltest is
Hindi, which may be due to relatively small training corpora size of Marathi when compared to
Hindi. Marathi corpus is half the size of Hindi corpus and hence contain less training samples
where Ltest is Hindi. As both the manually and the automatically assigned sense based features
give almost similar cross lingual accuracy for the case when Ltest is Hindi, we strongly believe
that classification accuracy can be improved by adding more Marathi documents.

7 Error Analysis

Two possible reasons for errors in the existing approach that we found are:

1. Missing Concepts: As the Marathi WordNet is created using the expansion approach from
the Hindi WordNet, almost all concepts present in the Marathi WordNet are derived from the
Hindi WordNet. In contrast, there are many concepts present in the Hindi WordNet but not
yet included in the Marathi WordNet. This leads to a low cross-lingual sentiment classification
accuracy using sense-based features with target language as Hindi.

2. Hindi Morph Analyzer Defect: The accuracy of sense-based in-language classification
for Hindi is comparatively lower than that for Marathi. We traced the problem to the sense
annotation tool used by the manual annotator. The morphological analyzer used to find the
root word (for verbs) did not match Hindi WordNet entries for verb synsets in many cases, thus
reducing the coverage of the annotation.

8 Conclusion and Future Work

We presented an approach to cross-lingual SA that uses WordNet synset identifiers as features of
a supervised classifier. Our sense-based approach provides a cross-lingual classification accuracy
of 72% and 84% for Hindi and Marathi respectively, which is an improvement of 14% - 15%
over the baseline based on a cross-lingual approach using a naïve translation of the training
and test corpus. We also performed experiments based on a sense marked corpora using an
automatic WSD engine. Results suggest that even a low quality word sense disambiguation
leads to an improvement in the performance of sentiment classification. In summary, we have
shown that WordNet synsets can act as good features for cross-lingual SA.

In future, we would like to perform sentiment analysis in a multilingual setup. Training
data belonging to multiple languages can be leveraged to perform SA for some specific target
language. Additionally, we would like to compare our CLSA approach with a MT based approach.
For this, we plan to perform same set of experiments for languages (like English and Romanian)
which have a linked wordnet as well a MT system between them.
