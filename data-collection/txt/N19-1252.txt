Abstract

Unsupervised part of speech (POS) tagging is
often framed as a clustering problem, but prac-
tical taggers need to ground their clusters as
well. Grounding generally requires reference
labeled data, a luxury a low-resource language
might not have. In this work, we describe an
approach for low-resource unsupervised POS
tagging that yields fully grounded output and
requires no labeled training data. We find
the classic method of Brown et al. (1992)
clusters well in our use case and employ a
decipherment-based approach to grounding.
This approach presumes a sequence of cluster
IDs is a ‘ciphertext’ and seeks a POS tag-to-
cluster ID mapping that will reveal the POS
sequence. We show intrinsically that, despite
the difficulty of the task, we obtain reasonable
performance across a variety of languages. We
also show extrinsically that incorporating our
POS tagger into a name tagger leads to state-
of-the-art tagging performance in Sinhalese
and Kinyarwanda, two languages with nearly
no labeled POS data available. We further
demonstrate our tagger’s utility by incorporat-
ing it into a true ‘zero-resource’ variant of the
MALOPA (Ammar et al., 2016) dependency
parser model that removes the current reliance
on multilingual resources and gold POS tags
for new languages. Experiments show that in-
cluding our tagger makes up much of the accu-
racy lost when gold POS tags are unavailable.

1 Introduction

While cellular, satellite, and hardware advances
have ensured that sophisticated NLP technology
can reach all corners of the earth, the language bar-
rier upon reaching remote locales still remains. As
an example, when international aid organizations
respond to new disasters, they are often unable to
deploy technology to understand local reports de-
tailing specific events (Munro and Manning, 2012;
Lewis et al., 2011). An inability to communicate

tagging. We use an unsupervised clustering method

ing a decipherment approach informed by POS tag se-
quence data from many languages (Section 3.3).

with partner governments or civilian populations
in a timely manner leads to preventable casualties.

The lack of adequate labeled training data has
been the major obstacle to expanding NLP’s out-
reach more multilingually. Developments in un-
supervised techniques that require only monolin-
gual corpora (Lample et al., 2018a; Artetxe et al.,
2018) and the ability to leverage labeled resources
in other languages have been proposed to address
this issue (Das and Petrov, 2011; Duong et al.,
2014; Ammar et al., 2016). Unfortunately, these



2429

methods either do not work in practice on true low-
resource cases or unrealistically assume the avail-
ability of some amount of supervision.

Consider syntactic parsing as a prime example.
Past editions of the CoNLL Shared Task on Multi-
lingual Parsing (Zeman et al., 2017, 2018) fea-
tured a category of target languages for which ei-
ther little or no training data was provided. How-
ever, even in the ‘no-resource’ scenario that most
closely matches our use case, gold part-of-speech
(POS) tags for test data were provided for the
participants to use. Prior to these shared tasks,
Ammar et al. (2016) proposed a variant of their
main model, MALOPA, that was meant to pro-
duce reasonable parses for languages under “zero-
resource” conditions. In order to function, how-
ever, the model requires users to provide gold POS
tags and word mappings from these languages into
a common semantic space, using approaches that
require parallel data (Guo et al., 2015).

Indeed, the compulsion to use POS tag-labeled
data in zero-resource circumstances extends to the
vast, varied lines of research in unsupervised POS
tagging itself! Every approach explored so far ul-
timately requires POS-annotated resources for the
language being studied in order to produce a fi-
nal, grounded output. Even the most conservative
strategies (Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007; Berg-
Kirkpatrick et al., 2010; Stratos et al., 2016) that
do not require any supervised signal during train-
ing still ultimately produce only ungrounded clus-
ters, and require a reference annotated corpus to
map the inferred clusters or states to actual POS
tags.

Making matters worse, evaluation is generally
offered in terms of the ‘many-to-one’ or ‘one-to-
one’ analyses Johnson (2007). These metrics use
a reference corpus to determine the optimal map-
ping of clusters to tags. While this evaluation ap-
proach is intuitively sensible for measuring clus-
ter purity, to actually use such an output, an entire
annotated training corpus is required.1 It is not
enough to simply rely on ungrounded clusters in
real-world systems; grounded labels offer a sort
of universal API between other resources such as
rule-based modules that operate on certain word
types or between resources built from other anno-
tated high-resource language data.

Since POS tag and parallel data resources for

these metrics are not indicative of downstream performance.

new languages are often unavailable or unreliable,
we make the following contributions to ensure the
surprise of a new language does not immobilize
us:

• We introduce a decipherment-based ap-
proach to POS grounding, which yields fully
grounded output and does not require any an-
notated data or parallel corpora in the lan-
guage to be analyzed. The approach uses pre-
existing human-labeled POS tag sequences
from high-resource parent languages (PL)
but no labeled data or sequences for the tar-
get, or child language (CL). An overview of
the approach is shown in Figure 1.

• We demonstrate our approach by evaluat-
ing over a variety of languages spanning 4
families and 8 genera (Germanic, Romance,
Slavic, Japanese, Semitic, Iranian, Indic, and
Bantoid), and show across-the-board reason-
able intrinsic performance, given the diffi-
culty of the task and the stringency (straight-
forward accuracy) in comparison to other un-
supervised evaluation strategies.

• We test the utility of our grounded tags in a
name tagging task, obtaining state-of-the-art
performance for Sinhalese and Kiryarwanda,
two languages with nearly no labeled POS or
named entity resources.

• We further pare down the annotated resources
required in an existing ‘zero-resource’ depen-
dency parser model and show that our un-
supervised and grounded tags are helpful at
closing the gap between a nihilistic tag-free
setting and an unrealistic gold tag setting.

• We release our code so that others may cre-
ate zero-resource syntactic analysis and in-
formation extraction systems at the onset of
the next new emergency.2

2 POS Grounding as Decipherment

We consider the task of POS induction as a two-
step pipeline: from word sequence w to POS tag
sequence p via cluster sequence c. Formally, our
conditional probability model is

where C is the cluster vocabulary and θ param-

deterministic pipelined clustering of words and a
tag labeling model that does not depend on words,
then for chosen ĉ, this becomes

We call this model the cipher grounder. As
presented it requires an estimate for Pθ(p) for
the CL, which requires POS training data. Un-
der the zero-resource scenario, we instead ap-
proximate Pθ(p) by the tag distribution of a PL.
Then, the cipher table Pθ(ĉ|p) can be trained using
a noisy-channel, expectation-maximization (EM)-
based approach as in Ravi and Knight (2011).

3 POS Tagger construction

We approach the search for optimal components
in the two-step pipeline outlined in Section 2 in
a cascaded manner. First, an optimal word clus-
tering is determined by means of the many-to-one
evaluation method. This method is explained well
by Johnson (2007):

“ ...deterministically map each hidden
state to the POS tag it co-occurs most
frequently with, and return the propor-
tion of the resulting POS tags that are
the same as the POS tags of the gold-
standard corpus.”

While unrealistic for POS tagger performance
purposes, many-to-one is a good choice for de-
termining cluster ‘purity’ and provides a reason-
able grounding upper bound. As the calcula-
tion of many-to-one does require labeled data, we
constrain the use of these labels for development
and will evaluate extrinsically using languages for

which we do not have any training data; see Sec-
tion 5.2.

Secondly, we search for the best approach to
ground the chosen clusters, given several possible
PL options.

After the optimal components and parameters
are determined, we validate POS tag quality intrin-
sically via tag accuracy on reference data where it
exists, and then extrinsically on two downstream
tasks. We investigate a simulated no-resource sce-
narios in the task of dependency parsing, and a real
low-resource scenario in name tagging.

3.1 Datasets

For intrinsic evaluation and optimization of the
tagging pipeline, including all preliminary exper-
iments, we use annotated corpora from Univer-
sal Dependencies (UD) v2.23 for the following
languages: English (en), German (de), French
(fr), Italian (it), Spanish (es), Japanese (ja), Czech
(cs), Russian (ru), Arabic (ar), and Farsi (fa).
For Swahili (sw), we use the Helsinki Corpus of
Swahili 2.0.4 Overall in these experiments we
cover 11 languages and 4 language families.

In our dependency parsing experiments, we use
the Universal Treebank v2.0 (McDonald et al.,
2013) for en, de, fr, es, it, Portuguese (pt), and
Swedish (sv). This set of treebanks is chosen in-
stead of UD in order to obtain results compara-
ble to those of previous work on simulated zero-
resource parsing scenarios (Ammar et al., 2016;
Zhang and Barzilay, 2015; Rasooli and Collins,
2015).

In our name tagging experiments, we use mono-
lingual texts for Sinhalese (si) and Kinyarwanda
(rw) provided by DARPA’s Low Resource Lan-
guages for Emergent Incidents (LORELEI) Pro-
gram during the 2018 Low Resource Human Lan-
guages Technologies (LoReHLT) evaluation.

3.2 Unsupervised Clustering

In this step we compare two approaches to unsu-
pervised ungrounded labeling. The first strategy is
to cluster by word types and thus label each token
with its cluster ID independently of its context.5

We consider Brown’s hierarchical clustering algo-

though not all methods induce a clustering.

rithm, (Brown et al., 1992)6 BROWN; Brown’s ex-
change algorithm,7 (Martin et al., 1998) MARLIN;
and k-means clustering of monolingual word em-
beddings of dimension size 100, trained using fast-
Text (Joulin et al., 2016), E-KMEANS. The second
labeling strategy is context-sensitive; it uses the
Bayesian HMM tagger proposed by Stratos et al.
(2016), which we call A-HMM. As noted previ-
ously, we evaluate unsupervised labeling extrinsi-
cally, via the many-to-one approach, and use the
best performing labeling in the complete two-step
grounded tagging pipeline.

In preliminary experiments, we vary the num-
ber of clusters and hidden states (|C|) between 17
and 500. We initially sought to create one cluster
per UD POS tag and then choose the proper 1:1 as-
signment of cluster to tag, following the approach
of Stratos et al. (2016). However, cluster purity is
low when only 17 clusters are allowed (i.e. each
cluster has words with a variety of POS tags). Nat-
urally, as the number of clusters is raised, the pu-
rity of each cluster improves. We ultimately fix
the cluster limit at 500, which gives a good trade-
off between overall cluster quality for all the un-
grounded tagging methods, and size small enough
to allow EM-based decipherment to be tractable.

Given this setting, we evaluate our four label-
ing strategies using the many-to-one approach, as
presented in Table 1. Due to the larger number
of clusters, the results presented here are higher
than and not comparable to the original literature
describing the methods.8 We can, nevertheless,
make relative judgements. In all cases, clustering
by type with Brown-based algorithms works better
than using a sophisticated tagger such as A-HMM.
Since BROWN and MARLIN obtain similar results,
with no consistently dominant model, in all subse-
quent experiments we use the BROWN labeler with
500 clusters.

3.3 Grounding via Decipherment

We now seek an appropriate method for grounding
the clusters generated in Section 3.2. We experi-

8As noted by Clark (2003) and Johnson (2007), in the
limit, keeping each type (or, in the case of A-HMM, TOKEN
in its own cluster will result in the maximum possible many-
to-one (polysemic types prevent perfect accuracy when type
clustering).

ment with en, fr, fa, and sw as CLs. For each CL t,
we instantiate our model following Equation 1, us-
ing the Carmel toolkit (Graehl, 1997) and forming
the cipher table as a one-state transducer. We train
these models using EM for 500 iterations or un-
til convergence, and we select the model with the
lowest perplexity from among 70 random restarts.

Yet unspecified is the nature of the POS lan-
guage model Pθ(p). We begin by training bi-
gram models of POS tag sequences with addi-
tive smoothing using the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke,
2002) for each PL s ∈ S = {en, de, fr, it, es, ja,
ar, cs, ru, sw}. But which PL’s POS tag data to
use for each CL? We explore two initial criteria
for choosing a single suitable PL s: confidence
of the model during decoding (perplexity, PPL),
and typological similarity. For the first criterion,
the PL whose cipher grounder s-t yields the bet-
ter performance is chosen. For the second crite-
rion, the most similar language to CL t is chosen
according to the cosine similarity between typo-
logical features vectors. We employ 102 features
obtained from WALS9 related to word order and
morphosyntactic alignment, further reduced to 50
dimensions using PCA. However, none these cri-
teria correlates significantly to tagging accuracy,
as we elaborate in Section 5.1. We instead try a
combined approach.

The likelihood of cluster ID replacement,
Pθ(ĉi|pj),∀ĉi ∈ C,∀pj in the tagset, is replaced
by

Pavg(ĉi|pj) ∼
∑

s∈S,s 6=t Pθ(ĉi|psj)
|S| − 1

where Pθ(ĉi|psj) is the likelihood of POS tag pj be-
ing represented by cluster ĉi after training with the
language s tag distribution. Note that the CL is ex-
cluded from S for the combination. The combined
cipher grounder is then defined by

argmax
p

Pall(p)Pavg(ĉ|p) (2)

where Pall(p) is a language model trained over the
concatenation of POS sequences of all parent lan-
guages in S. We call this approach CIPHER-AVG.

4.2 Multilingual Dependency Parsing
We base our experiments on the no-treebank setup
of MALOPA (Ammar et al., 2016), but change the
underlying transition-based parser to the graph-
based parser proposed by Dozat and Manning
(2017) for implementation convenience. Follow-
ing this setup, for each CL except en, we train
the parser on the concatenation of treebanks of the
other 6 languages as PLs.

The original MALOPA work enriches the input
representation by concatenating pretrained multi-
lingual word embeddings (Guo et al., 2016), mul-
tilingual Brown cluster IDs, and POS tag informa-
tion. However, these representations are obtained
using parallel corpora and gold POS tags are re-
quired for parsing at test time.

In contrast, we are interested in the realistic
scenario in which no resource is available in the
child language but raw text. It is important to
note, however, that our objective is not to beat the
state-of-the-art on this benchmark but to investi-

gate parsing performance fluctuation when cross-
lingual components (gold POS annotations and su-
pervised multilingual embeddings) are replaced by
those obtained in an unsupervised manner.

We investigate the following variations to each
component of the input representation.

• Multilingual word and cluster embed-
dings. The original work of Ammar et al.
(2016) uses ‘robustly projected’ pre-trained
embeddings (Guo et al., 2015) for word em-
beddings and embeddings learned from En-
glish Brown cluster IDs projected through
word alignments (Guo et al., 2016) for clus-
ter embeddings; both of these rely on par-
allel data and we refer to them collectively
as GUO. We replace these with monolin-
gual fastText embeddings (Bojanowski et al.,
2017) projected to a common space using
MUSE, the unsupervised method of Lample
et al. (2018b). For cluster embeddings we
start with fastText monolingual embeddings
trained over Brown cluster ID sequences in-
stead of word tokens (|C| = 256, the same
as in Guo et al. (2016)). Then, unsuper-
vised multilingual embeddings are derived,
again using MUSE.10 Note that this approach,
which we refer to collectively as MUSE, re-
quires no parallel data. We compare both
MUSE and GUO approaches in Section 5.2
and Table 5.

• POS tag scheme. The original work uses
gold POS tag data at both train and test
time. While realistic to have gold POS info
from PLs for training, it is unrealistic to
have this data available for new CLs at test
time. We thus compare the original GOLD
scenario with the realistic CIPHER scenario,
where the training data is still gold, but the
test POS tags use the method presented in this
work. Another realistic scenario dispenses

with POS disambiguation except for the triv-
ial distinction of punctuation; for compatibil-
ity purposes this is done in both train and test
data and is labeled NONE.

We investigate all combinations of {GUO,
MUSE}-{GOLD, CIPHER, NONE}.

5 Results and Discussion

5.1 Labeling and Cipher Grounding

The results in Table 1 are somewhat at odds with
those presented in Stratos et al. (2016), but these
are done at different operating points; we use
different data, the UD-17 tag set instead of the
Universal Treebank 12 tag set, and, perhaps most
importantly, generate more clusters. We further
note that to some degree, choosing Brown clusters
based on the results in Table 1 compromises
claims of our approach being fully ‘unsupervised’
for those six languages, however our subsequent
experiments on additional languages are truly
unsupervised.

Table 2 presents the intrinsic performance of the
cipher grounder over all PL-CL pairs considered.
The difference between the best and the worst
performing PL for each CL ranges from 24.62
percentage points for Swahili to 48.34 points for
French, and an average difference of 34.5 points
among all languages. The case when PL=CL is
also presented in Table 2 as a reference and pro-
vides a reliable upper-bound under zero-resource
conditions. It is worth noting the difference in
accuracy when comparing the best performing
PL for each CL with its corresponding PL=CL
upper-bound. Among all CLs, the best cipher
grounder for French (es-fr) gets the closest to
its upper-bound with just 4.81 percentage points
of difference, followed by the English grounder
(fr-en) with 13.53 points of difference. On the
other hand, the best Swahili grounder (ar-sw) is
the most distant from its upper-bound with 30.45
points of difference.

Given such wide performance gaps in the CL
set, the choice of a suitable PL becomes crucial for
performance; therein the cipher model confidence
and typological similarity are explored as possible
choice criteria. With regards to model confidence,
the Pearson correlation between accuracy scores
and PPL, expected to be negative, ranges from

−0.71 for English to 0.40 for Farsi. Since the PPL
values for different PLs are not comparable, we
first z-normalize PPL per CL and then concatenate
the results for all CLs. The Pearson correlation
of the resulting PPL-accuracy values is -0.13.
This last result indicates that the most confident
model might not be the most accurate, hence this
criterion is not suitable for choosing a suitable PL.

With regards to typological similarity, we find
that the Pearson correlation between accuracy
scores and cosine similarity of typological feature
vectors, expected to be positive, ranges from 0.44
for English to -0.14 for Farsi. The total correlation
is found to be 0.18. Again, we find that the most
typologically similar s might not be the the most
accurate, hence this criterion is not suitable either.

Hence, it becomes obvious that choosing a sin-
gle PL is an inefficient strategy that does not lever-
age the contribution that other PLs could bring. In
this situation, the combination of cipher grounders
for several PLs represents a sound strategy when
no prior linguistic information of a certain CL
is available. As shown in Table 2, this model,
CIPHER-AVG, obtains accuracy scores of 56.4,
58.6, 37.4, and 37.8 % for en, fr, fa, and sw, re-
spectively. When compared to the best performing
PL for each CL (see bold cells in Table 2), it can be
noticed that the performance gap ranges from just
1.2 percentage points for Swahili to 13.3 points
for French, with an average of 6.1 points among
all target languages.

Let us now compare the performance of
CIPHER-AVG with that of a vanilla supervised
neural model.11 Table 3 shows precision, recall,
and F1 scores for the NOUN tag. Even though
CIPHER-AVG achieved mixed results (mid to low
accuracy), the model robustly achieves mid-range
performance according to F1-score for all CLs.
The results are even more optimistic in terms of
recall for English and French, and in terms of pre-
cision for Farsi and Swahili. This gives us hope
that CIPHER-AVG can provide a useful, if noisy,
signal to downstream tasks that depend on non-
trivial performance over specific POS tags, such
as name tagging, as exposed in the next section.

11We use UDPipe v1.2.0 (Straka and Straková, 2017) to
train the models.

5.2 Extrinsic evaluation

In the name tagging task, our LSTM-CNN base-
line obtains 78.76% and 70.76% F1 score for
Kinyarwanda and Sinhalese, respectively. When
enriching the input representation with CIPHER-
AVG tags, the performance goes up to 80.16%
and 71.71% respectively. These results sug-
gest that the signal provided by the combined
cipher grounder is significant enough for rele-
vant tags such as common, proper nouns and
noun modifiers. As an example, consider
the sentence Kwizera Peace Ndaruhutse
, wari wambaye nomero 11. The base-
line model fails to recognize Kwizera Peace
Ndaruhutse as a person name. In contrast,
with the PROPN tag assigned by CIPHER-AVG
to Kwizera, Peace, and Ndaruhutse, our
model is able to identify this name.

Likewise, the utility of CIPHER-AVG tags for de-
pendency parsing under zero-resource scenarios is
summarized in Table 4 and Table 5. It is important
to point out that, even though the MALOPA setup
follows the no-treebank setup of Ammar et al.
(2016), parsing scores in the first row of Table
4 differ from those reported by them (Table 8 in
Ammar et al. (2016)). Such difference is to be
expected since the underlying parser used in our
experiments is a graph-based neural parser (Dozat
and Manning, 2017) instead of a transition-based

one (Dyer et al., 2015).12 As mentioned earlier,
our objective is to analyze the effect of our tagger’s
signal on parsing performance under no-resource
scenarios, instead of pushing the state-of-the-art
for the task.

We first analyze the effect of POS tag infor-
mation at test time for the MALOPA setup in Ta-
ble 4. First we remove all POS signal except triv-
ial punctuation information (NONE row), and, pre-
dictably, the scores drop significantly across all
target languages. Then, we use our cipher tags
(CIPHER row) and see improvements for all lan-
guages in LAS and for all but one language in UAS
(de). This demonstrates the value of our cipher ap-
proach.

We then take the next logical step and remove
the parallel data-grounded embeddings, replacing
them with fully unsupervised MUSE embeddings.
Table 5 summarizes these results. Let us com-
pare MUSE-NONE setup (no POS signal at train or
test time) with MUSE-GOLD (gold POS signal at
train and test time). It can be observed that POS
signal improves performance greatly for all lan-
guages when using MUSE embeddings. However,
consider GUO-GOLD and MUSE-NONE. Here we
note a mixed result: whilst de, sv, and it do benefit
from POS information, the other languages do not,
obtaining great improvements from MUSE embed-

longer training regimes possibly needed given the high block
dropout rates in Dozat and Manning (2017).

dings instead. Finally, consider MUSE-CIPHER
(gold POS tags during training, cipher tags during
testing). When compared to MUSE-NONE setup, it
can be observed that, unfortunately, the heuristic
POS tagger is too noisy and gets in MUSE’s way.

6 Related Work

Our proposed tagging pipeline can be interpreted
as first reducing the vocabulary size to a fixed
number of clusters, and then finding a cluster–
POS tag mapping table that best explains the data
without any path constraint (a cluster ID could be
mapped to any POS tag). In this sense, our ap-
proach applies EM to simplify the task (e.g. when
using Brown clustering (Brown et al., 1992)), fol-
lowed by another EM run to optimize cipher table
parameters.

Under this lens, the methods closest to our ap-
proach are those which attempt to reduce or con-
strain the parameter search space prior to running
EM. For instance, Ravi and Knight (2009) explic-
itly search for the smallest model that explains
the data using Integer Programming, and then use
EM to set parameter values. In a different ap-
proach, Goldberg et al. (2008) obtain competitive
performance with a classic HMM model by ini-
tializing the emission probability distribution with
a mixture of language-specific, linguistically con-
strained distributions. However, both of these ap-
proaches are framed around the task of unsuper-
vised POS disambiguation with a full dictionary
(Merialdo, 1994). Previous work relaxes the full
dictionary constraint by leveraging monolingual
lexicons (Haghighi and Klein, 2006; Smith and
Eisner, 2005; Merialdo, 1994; Ravi and Knight,
2009), multilingual tagged dictionaries (Li et al.,
2012; Fang and Cohn, 2017), and parallel corpora
(Duong et al., 2014; Täckström et al., 2013; Das
and Petrov, 2011).

In addition, previous work includes sequence
models that do not rely on any resource besides
raw text during training, namely unsupervised
POS induction models. These models are based,
with few exceptions, on extensions to the standard
HMM; most, in the form of appropriate priors over
the HMM multinomial parameters (Goldwater and
Griffiths, 2007; Johnson, 2007; Ganchev et al.,
2009); others, by using logistic distributions in-
stead of multinomial ones (Berg-Kirkpatrick et al.,
2010; Stratos et al., 2016). However, these models
still need to ground or map hidden states to actual

POS tags to evaluate, and they inevitably resort
to many-to-one or one-to-one accuracy scoring.
Some previous work has been cautious in pointing
out this ill-defined setting (Ravi and Knight, 2009;
Christodoulopoulos et al., 2010), and we argue its
inappropriateness for scenarios in which the test
set is extremely small or even when no annotated
reference corpus exists.

Therefore, the problem of grounding the se-
quence of states or cluster IDs to POS tags without
using any linguistic resource remains unsolved.
We formulate this task as a decipherment problem.
Decipherment aims to find a substitution table be-
tween alphabets or tokens of an encrypted code
and a known language without the need of parallel
corpora. The task has been successfully applied
in alphabet mapping for lost languages (Snyder
et al., 2010), and machine translation at the char-
acter (Pourdamghani and Knight, 2017) and token
level (Ravi and Knight, 2011; Dou et al., 2015).
For the task of POS tag grounding, the sequence
of states or cluster IDs is modeled as an encrypted
code to be deciphered back to a POS sequence.
Furthermore, we tackle the problem from a ‘uni-
versal’ perspective by allowing the cipher learn
from POS sequences from a varied pool of lan-
guages.

Other recent work has declared a ‘radically uni-
versal’ mantra to language inclusivity. Herm-
jakob et al. (2018) presents a Romanizer that cov-
ers all writing systems known to Unicode. Pan
et al. (2017) extends name tagging and linking
capability to hundreds of languages by leverag-
ing Wikipedia. Kirov et al. (2016) has semi-
automatically built inflectional paradigms for hun-
dreds of languages.

7 Conclusion

We present a POS tag grounding strategy based on
decipherment that does not require human-labeled
data to map states or clusters to actual POS tags
and thus can be used in real-world situations re-
quiring grounded POS tags. The decipherment
model considers state or word cluster IDs of a CL
as a cipher text to be deciphered back to a POS
sequence.

The model operates on top of Brown cluster IDs
and requires a POS language model trained on an-
notated corpora of one or more PLs. Experimental
results over a large and linguistically varied set of
PLs show that the choice of which PL to decipher

(bold entries), in many cases doing so even without any POS tag information (italic entries), however noisy
decipherment-based POS tags are no longer helpful.

POS tags from is crucial for performance. We ex-
plore model confidence, as measured by perplex-
ity and typological similarities, as intuitive criteria
for PL choice. However, both criteria prove to be
not correlated with tagging accuracy scores. Thus,
we propose a cipher model combination strategy
in order to leverage the word-order patterns in sev-
eral PLs, at the cost of an accuracy drop ranging
from just 1.15 percentage points to 13.33 points.

The resulting combined grounder is completely
language agnostic, making it attractive for the
analysis of languages new to the academic com-
munity. Furthermore, analysis over the tasks of
name tagging and dependency parsing demon-
strate that the tags induced by the combined
grounder provide a non-trivial signal for improve-
ment of the downstream task. We obtain state-of-
the-art results for name tagging in Kinyarwanda
and Sinhalese, languages for which POS anno-
tated corpora is nearly non-existent.
