Abstract

Despite the recent advances in parsing,
significant efforts are needed to improve
the current parsers performance, such as
the enhancement of the argument/adjunct
recognition. There is evidence that verb
subcategorization frames can contribute to
parser accuracy, but a number of issues re-
main open. The main aim of this paper is
to show how subcategorization frames ac-
quired from a syntactically annotated cor-
pus and organized into fine-grained classes
can improve the performance of two rule-
based dependency grammars.

1 Introduction

Statistical parsers and rule-based parsers have ad-
vanced over recent years. However, significant ef-
forts are required to increase the performance of
current parsers (Klein and Manning, 2003; Nivre
et al., 2006; Ballesteros and Nivre, 2012; Marimon
et al., 2014).

One of the linguistic phenomena which parsers
often fail to handle correctly is the argu-
ment/adjunct distinction (Carroll et al., 1998). For
this reason, the main goal of this paper is to
test empirically the accuracy of rule-based depen-
dency grammars working exclusively with syntac-
tic rules or adding subcategorization frames to the
rules.

A number of studies shows that subcategoriza-
tion frames can contribute to improve parser per-
formance (Carroll et al., 1998; Zeman, 2002; Mir-
roshandel et al., 2013). Particularly, these studies
are mainly concerned with the integration of sub-
categorization information into statistical parsers.

The list of studies about rule-based parsers in-
tegrating subcategorization information is also ex-
tensive (Lin, 1998; Alsina et al., 2002; Bick, 2006;
Calvo and Gelbukh, 2011). However, they do not

explicitly relate the improvements in parser per-
formance to the addition of subcategorization.

This paper analyses in detail how subcatego-
rization frames acquired from an annotated cor-
pus and distributed among fine-grained classes in-
crease accuracy in rule-based dependency gram-
mars.

The framework used is that of the FreeLing
Dependency Grammars (FDGs) for Spanish and
Catalan, using enriched lexical-syntactic informa-
tion about the argument structure of the verb.
FreeLing (Padró and Stanilovsky, 2012) is an
open-source library of multilingual Natural Lan-
guage Processing (NLP) tools that provide linguis-
tic analysis for written texts. The FDGs are the
core of the FreeLing dependency parser, the Txala
Parser (Atserias et al., 2005).

The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows. Section 2 contains an overview of previous
work related to this research. Section 3 presents
the rule-based dependency parser used and the
Spanish and Catalan grammars. Section 4 de-
scribes the strategy followed initially to integrate
subcategorization into the grammars and how this
information has been redesigned. Section 5 fo-
cuses on the evaluation and the analysis of sev-
eral experiments testing versions of the grammars
including or discarding subcategorization frames.
Finally, the main conclusions and the further re-
search goals arisen from the results of the experi-
ments are exposed in Section 6.

2 Related Work

There has been an extensive research on parser de-
velopment, and most approaches can be classified
as statistical or rule-based. In the former, a statis-
tical model learnt from annotated or unannotated
texts is applied to build the syntactic tree (Klein
and Manning, 2003; Collins and Koo, 2005; Nivre
et al., 2006; Ballesteros and Nivre, 2012), whereas
the latter uses hand-built grammars to guide the

201



parser in the construction of the tree (Sleator and
Temperley, 1991; Järvinen and Tapanainen, 1998;
Lin, 1998).

Concerning the languages this study is based
on, some research on Spanish has been performed
from the perspective of Constraint Grammar
(Bick, 2006), Unification Grammar (Ferrández
and Moreno, 2000), Head-Driven Phrase Structure
Grammar (Marimon et al., 2014), and Dependency
Grammar for statistical parsing, both supervised
(Carreras et al., 2006) and semi-supervised (Calvo
and Gelbukh, 2011). For Catalan, a rule-based
parser based on Constraint Grammar (Alsina et
al., 2002) and a statistical dependency parser (Car-
reras, 2007) are available.

Despite the huge achievements in the area of
parsing, argument/adjunct recognition is still a lin-
guistic problem in which parsers still show low ac-
curacy and in which there is still no generalized
consensus in Theoretical Linguistics (Tesnière,
1959; Chomsky, 1965). This phenomenon refers
to the subcategorization notion, which corre-
sponds to the definition of the type and the number
of arguments of a syntactic head.

The acquisition of subcategorization frames
from corpora is one of the strategies for integrat-
ing information about the argument structure into
a parser. Depending on the level of language anal-
ysis of the annotated corpus, two main strategies
are used in automatic acquisition.

If the acquisition is performed over a mor-
phosyntactically annotated text, the subcatego-
rization frames are inferred by applying statisti-
cal techniques on morphosyntactically annotated
data (Brent, 1993; Manning, 1993; Korhonen et
al., 2003).

Alternatively, acquisition can be performed
with syntactically annotated texts (Sarkar and Ze-
man, 2000; O’Donovan et al., 2005; Aparicio et
al., 2008). Subcategorization acquisition can be
performed straightforwardly because the informa-
tion about the argument structure is available in
the corpus. Therefore, this approach generally fo-
cuses on the methods for subcategorization frames
classification.

The final classification in a lexicon of frames
is a computational resource for several NLP tools.
In the framework which this research focuses on,
the integration of the acquired subcategorization is
orientated to the contribution towards building the
syntactic tree when the parser has incomplete in-

formation to make a decision (Carroll et al., 1998).
Depending on the characteristics of the parser,

subcategorization assists in this task in a different
way. Subcategorization information can be used
to assign a probability to every possible syntactic
tree and to rank them in parsers that perform the
whole set of possible syntactic analysis of a partic-
ular sentence (Carroll et al., 1998; Zeman, 2002;
Mirroshandel et al., 2013).

In contrast, subcategorization may help to re-
strict the application of certain rules. Then, when
the parser detects the subcategorization frame in
the input sentence, it labels the syntactic tree ac-
cording to the frame discarding any other possible
analysis (Lin, 1998; Calvo and Gelbukh, 2011).

3 Dependency Parsing in FreeLing

The rule-based dependency grammars presented
in this article are the core of the Txala Parser (At-
serias et al., 2005), the NLP module in charge
of Dependency Parsing in the FreeLing library
(Padró and Stanilovsky, 2012).1

FreeLing is an open-source project that has been
developed for more than ten years. It is a com-
plete NLP pipeline built on a chain of modules
that provide a general and robust linguistic anal-
ysis. Among the available tools, FreeLing offers
sentence recognition, tokenization, named entity
recognition, tagging, chunking, dependency pars-
ing, word sense disambiguation, and coreference
resolution.

3.1 Txala Parser

The Txala Parser is one of the dependency pars-
ing modules available in FreeLing. It is a rule-
based, non-projective and multilingual depen-
dency parser that provides robust syntactic anal-
ysis in three steps.

Txala receives the partial syntactic trees pro-
duced by the chunker (Civit, 2003) as input.
Firstly, the head-child relations are identified us-
ing a set of heuristic rules that iteratively decide
whether two adjacent trees must be merged, and
in which way, until there is only one tree left. Sec-
ondly, it is converted into syntactic dependencies
according to Mel’čuk (1988). Finally, each depen-
dency arch of the tree is labelled with a syntactic
function tag.

3.2 FreeLing Dependency Grammars

The current version of FreeLing includes rule-
based dependency grammars for English, Span-
ish, Catalan, Galician and Asturian (see Table 1
for a brief overview of their sizes). In this pa-
per, the Spanish and Catalan dependency gram-
mars are described.

The FDGs follow the linguistic basis of syn-
tactic dependencies (Tesnière, 1959; Mel’čuk,
1988). However, we propose a different analy-
sis for prepositional phrases (preposition-headed),
subordinate clauses (conjunction-headed) and co-
ordinating structures (conjunction-headed).

A FDG is structured as a set of manually de-
fined rules which link two adjacent syntactic par-
tial trees (linking rules) and assign a syntactic
function to every link of the tree (labelling rules),
according to certain conditions and priority. They
are applied based on this priority: at every step,
two adjacent partial trees will be attached or will
be labelled with a syntactic function tag if their
rule is the highest ranked for which all the condi-
tions are met.

Linking rules can contain four kind of con-
ditions, regarding morphological (part-of-speech
tag), lexical (word form, lemma), syntactic (syn-
tactic context, syntactic features of lemmas) and
semantic features (semantic properties predefined
by the user).

For instance, the rule shown in Figure 1 has pri-
ority 911, and states that a sub-tree marked as a
subordinate clause (subord) whose head is a rel-
ative pronoun (PR) attached as a child to the noun
phrase (sn) to its left (top left) when these two
consecutive sub-trees are not located to the right of
a verb phrase (!grup-verb $$).

Concerning the labelling rules, the set of condi-
tions that the parent or the child of the dependency
must meet may refer to morphological (part-of-
speech tag), lexical (word form, lemma), syntac-
tic (lower/upper sub-tree nodes, syntactic features
of lemmas) and semantic properties (EuroWord-
Net Top Concept Ontology -TCO- features, Word-

911 !grup-verb $$ - (sn,subord{ˆPR})

Figure 2: Labelling rule for human direct objects

Net Semantic File, WordNet Synonyms and Hy-
pernyms and other semantic features predefined

In the rule illustrated in Figure 2, the direct ob-
ject label (dobj) is assigned to the link between
a verbal head (grup-verb) and a prepositional
phrase (grup-sp) child when the head belongs
to the transitive verbs class (trans) and the child
is post-verbal (right), the preposition is a (or the
contraction al), and the nominal head inside the
prepositional phrase has the TCO feature Human
but not (!=) the features Building or Place
(to prevent organizations from being identified as
a direct object).

4 CompLex-VS lexicon for Parsing

Following the hypothesis that subcategorization
frames improve the parsing performance (Carroll
et al., 1998), the first version of FDGs included
verbal and nominal frames in order to improve ar-
gument/adjunct recognition and prepositional at-
tachment (Lloberes et al., 2010). In this paper,
only the verbal lexicon is presented because it is
the resource used for the argument/adjunct recog-
nition task in the grammars.

4.1 Initial CompLex-VS lexicon in FDGs

The initial Computational Lexicon of Verb Sub-
categorization (CompLex-VS) was automatically
extracted from the subcategorization frames of the
SenSem Corpus (Fernández and Vàzquez, 2014),
which contains 30231 syntactically and seman-
tically annotated sentences per language, and of
the Volem Multilingual Lexicon (Fernández et al.,
2002), which has 1700 syntactically and semanti-
cally annotated verbal lemmas per language. The
patterns extracted from both resources are orga-

203



nized according to the linguistic-motivated classi-
fication proposed by Alonso et al. (2007).

The final lexicon applied to the FDGs has 11
subcategorization classes containing a total of
1314 Spanish verbal lemmas and 847 Catalan
verbal lemmas with a different subcategorization
frame.

A first experimental evaluation of the Spanish
Grammar with the initial subcategorization lexi-
con (Lloberes et al., 2010) showed that incorpo-
rating subcategorization information is promising.

4.2 Redesign of the CompLex-VS lexicon

According to the evaluation results of the gram-
mars with the initial CompLex-VS included, the
lexicon has been redesigned, proposing a set of
more fine-grained subcategorization frame classes
in order to represent verb subcategorization in the
dependency rules in a controlled and detailed way.

New syntactic-semantic patterns have been ex-
tracted automatically from the SenSem Corpus ac-
cording to the idea that every verbal lemma with a
different subcategorization frame expresses a dif-
ferent meaning. Therefore, a new lexicon entry is
created every time an annotated verbal lemma with
a different frame is detected.

The CompLex-VS contains 3102 syntactic pat-
terns in the Spanish lexicon and 2630 patterns in
the Catalan lexicon (see Section 4.3 for detailed
numbers). They are organized into 15 subcate-
gorization frames as well as into 4 subcategoriz-
tion classes. The lexicon is distributed in XML
format under the Creative Commons Attribution-
ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.2

Certain patterns have been discarded because
they are non-prototypical in the corpus (e.g. clitic
left dislocations), they alter the sentence order
(e.g. relative clauses), or they involve controver-
sial argument classes (e.g. prepositional phrases
seen as arguments or adjuncts depending on the
context).

As Figure 3 shows, the extracted patterns
(<verb>) have been classified into <frame>
classes according to the whole set of argument
structures occurring in the corpus (subj for in-
transitive verbs, subj,dobj for transitive verbs,
etc.). Simultaneously, frames have been organized
in <subcategorization> classes (monoar-
gumental, biargumental, triargumental and quatri-
argumental).

</subcategorization>

Figure 3: Example of the CompLex-VS

Every lexicon entry contains the syntactic func-
tion of every argument (fs), the grammatical cat-
egory of the head of the argument (cat) and the
thematic role (rs). The type of construction
(e.g. active, passive, impersonal, etc.) has been
inferred from the predicate and aspect annotations
available in the SenSem Corpus.

Two non-annotated lexical items of the sentence
have also been inserted into the subcategorization
frame because the information that they provide
is crucial for the argument structure configuration
(e.g. the particle ‘se’ and the lexical value of the
prepositional phrase head).

In addition, meta-linguistic information has
been added to every entry: a unique id and the
relative frequency of the pattern in the corpus
(freq). A threshold frequency has been estab-
lished at 7 ·10−5 (Spanish) and at 8.5 ·10−5 (Cata-
lan). Patterns below this threshold have been con-
sidered marginal in the corpus and they have been
discarded.

Every pattern contains a link to the frame and
subcategorization class that they belong to (ref).
For example, if an entry has the reference 1:1, it
means that the pattern corresponds to a monoargu-
mental verb whose unique argument is a subject.

4.3 Integration of CompLex-VS in the FDGs

From the CompLex-VS, two derived lexicons per
language containing the verbal lemmas for every
recorded pattern have been created to be integrated
into the FDGs. The CompLex-SynF lexicon con-

Table 2: CompLex-SynF lexicon in numbers

tains the subcategorization patterns generalized by
the syntactic function (Table 2). The CompLex-
SynF+Cat lexicon collects the syntactic patterns
combining syntactic function and grammatical
category (adjective/noun/prepositional phrase, in-
finitive/interrogative/completive clause).

The addition of grammatical categories makes it
possible to restrict the grammar rules. For exam-
ple, a class of verbs containing the verb quedarse
(‘to get’) whose argument is a predicative and a
prepositional phrase allows the rules to identify
that the prepositional phrase of the sentence Se
ha quedado de piedra (‘[He/She] got shocked’)
is a predicative argument. Furthermore, it allows
for discarding the prepositional phrase of the sen-
tence Aparece de madrugada (‘[He/She] shows up
at late night’) being a predicative argument, al-
though aparecer belongs to the class of predicative
verbs but conveying a noun phrase as argument.

While in the CompLex-SynF lexicon the infor-
mation is more compacted (1054 syntactic pat-
terns classified in 15 frames), in the CompLex-
SynF+Cat lexicon the classes are more granular
(1356 syntactic patterns organized in 77 frames).

Only subcategorization patterns corresponding
to lexicon entries referring to the active voice
have been integrated in the FDGs, since they in-
volve non-marked word order. Both lexicons also
exclude information about the thematic role, al-
though they take into account the value of the head
(if the frame contains a prepositional argument)
and the pronominal verbs (lexical entries that ac-
cept ‘se’ particle whose value neither is reflexive
nor reciprocal).

mar and two versions of the Catalan dependency

grammar have been created. One version contains
the CompLex-SynF lexicon and the other one the
CompLex-Synf+Cat.

The old CompLex-VS lexicon classes have
been replaced with the new ones. Specifically, this
information has been inserted in the part of the la-
belling rules about the syntactic properties of the
parent node (observe p.class in Figure 2).

Finally, new rules have been added for frames
of CompLex-SynF and CompLex-SynF+Cat that
are not present in the old CompLex-VS lexicon.
Furthermore, some rules have been disabled for
frames of the old CompLex-VS lexicon that do
not exist in the CompLex-SynF and CompLex-
SynF+Cat lexicons (see Table 3 for the detailed
size of the grammars).

5 Evaluation

An evaluation task has been carried out to test
empirically how the FDGs performance changes
when subcategorization information is added or
subtracted. Several versions of the grammars have
been tested using a controlled annotated linguistic
data set.

This evaluation specifically focuses on
analysing the results of the experiments qualita-
tively. This kind of analysis makes it possible to
track the decisions that the parser has made, so
that it is possible to provide an explanation about
the accuracy of the FDGs running with different
linguistic information.

5.1 Experiments
Four versions of both Spanish and Catalan gram-
mars are tested in order to assess the differences of
the performance depending on the linguistic infor-
mation added.

• Bare FDG. A version of the FDGs running
without subcategorization frames.

• Baseline FDG. A version of the FDGs run-
ning with the old CompLex-VS lexicon.

• SynF FDG. A version of the FDGs running
with the CompLex-SynF lexicon.

Since this research is focused on the implemen-
tation of subcategorization information for argu-
ment/adjunct recognition, only the labelling rules
are discussed in this paper (Table 3). However,
metrics related to linking rules are also mentioned
to provide a general description of the FDGs.

5.2 Evaluation data

To perform a qualitative evaluation, the ParTes test
suite has been used (Lloberes et al., 2014). This
resource is a multilingual hierarchical test suite
of a representative and controlled set of syntactic
phenomena which has been developed for evalu-
ating the parsing performance as regards syntactic
structure and word order.

It contains 161 syntactic phenomena in Span-
ish (99 referring to structure and 62 to word order)
and 147 syntactic phenomena in Catalan (101 cor-
responding to structure phenomena and 46 to word
order).

The current version of ParTes is distributed with
an annotated data set in the CoNLL format. Al-
though this data set is not initially developed for
evaluating the argument/adjunct recognition, the
number of arguments and adjuncts contained in
ParTes is proportional to the number of arguments
and adjuncts of the SenSem Corpus (Table 4).
Therefore, the ParTes data set is a reduced sam-
ple of the linguistic phenomena that occur in a
larger corpus, which makes ParTes an appropriate
resource for this task.

5.3 Evaluation metrics

The metrics have been computed using the
CoNLL-X Shared Task 2007 script (Nivre et al.,
2007). The output of the FDGs (system output)
has been compared to the ParTes annotated data
set (gold standard).

Table 5: Tagset of syntactic functions related to

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of
the several FDGs versions are the following ones:

Accuracy3

LAS = correct attachments and labellingstotal tokens

UAS = correct attachmentstotal tokens

LAS2 = correct labellingstotal tokens

Precision

P = system correct tokenssystem tokens

Recall

R = system correct tokensgold tokens

Both quantitative and qualitative analysis de-
tailed in Section 5.4 pay special attention to the
metric LAS2, which informs about the number of
heads with the correct syntactic function tag.

Precision and recall metrics of the labelling
rules provide information about how the addi-
tion of verbal subcategorization information con-
tributes to the grammar performance. For this rea-
son, in the qualitative analysis, only labelling syn-
tactic function tags directly related to verbal sub-
categorization are considered (Table 5).

5.4 Accuracy results
The global results of the FDGs evaluation (LAS)
show that the whole set of evaluated grammars
score over 80% accuracy in Spanish (Table 6) and
around 80% in Catalan (Table 7).

In the four Spanish grammar versions (Table 6),
the correct head (UAS) has been identified in
90.01% of the cases. On the other hand, the
tendency changes in syntactic function labelling
(LAS2). The Baseline establishes that 85.54%
of tokens have the correct syntactic function tag.

Table 7: Accuracy scores (%) in Catalan

However, Bare drops 2.68 scores and SynF and
SynF+Cat improve 0.75 scores with respect to the
baseline.

A parallel behaviour is observed in Catalan, al-
though the scores are slightly lower than in Span-
ish (Table 7). The four Catalan grammars score
86.84% in attachment (UAS). The Baseline scores
82.85% in syntactic function assignment (LAS2).
Once again FDGs perform worse without subcat-
egorization information (0.94 points less in Bare
grammar) and better with subcategorization infor-
mation (2.39 points more in SynF and SynF+Cat).

From a general point of view, accuracy met-
rics show a medium-high accuracy performance of
all versions of FDGs in both languages. Specif-
ically, these first results highlight that subcatego-
rization information helps with the syntactic func-
tion labelling. However, qualitative results will re-
veal how subcategorization influences the gram-
mar performance (Sections 5.5 and 5.6).

5.5 Precision results

As observed in the quantitative analysis (Sec-
tion 5.4), in both languages most of the syntac-
tic function assignments drop in precision when
subcategorization classes are blocked in the gram-
mar (Tables 8 and 9), whereas syntactic function
labelling tends to improve when subcategorization
is available.

For example, the precision of the prepositional
object (pobj) in both languages drops drastically
when subcategorization is disabled (Bare). On
the contrary, the precision improves significantly
when the rules include subcategorization infor-
mation (Baseline). Furthermore, the introduc-
tion of more fine-grained frames helps the gram-
mars reach a precision of 94.74% in Spanish and
94.12% in Catalan (SynF and SynF+Cat). Fig-

Table 8: Labelling precision scores (%) in Spanish

ure 4 shows this dichotomy.
Despite these improvements, some items differ

from the general tendency.
In Spanish, the improvement of the copulative

verbs (attr) is due to lexical information in the
Bare FDG, while they keep stable in SynF and
SynF+Cat. Precision remains the same in the indi-
rect object (iobj) because morphological informa-
tion is enough to detect dative clitics in singular.

The performance of predicative (pred) in all the
grammars is related to the lack or addition of sub-
categorization. The Baseline FDG subcategoriza-
tion classes do not include the same set of verbs as
in the evaluation data. For this reason, a generic
rule for capturing predicatives (Bare FDG) covers
the lack of verbs in a few cases. The improve-
ment of the coverage with new verbs (SynF and
SynF+Cat) shows an increment of the precision.

Adjunct (adjt) recognition drops for misla-
bellings with predicative because of the ambiguity
between the participle clause expressing time and
a true predicative complement.

Table 9: Labelling precision scores (%) in Catalan

FDGs in Catalan show a parallel behaviour to
that in Spanish, but they follow the general ten-
dency in more cases. SynF and SynF+Cat in-
crease the precision in all the cases, except for
the direct object (dobj) in SynF+Cat. Once more
the prepositional object (pobj) performance raises
when subcategorization frames are available.

Although a drop in all the cases in the Bare FDG
is expected, the attribute (attr) and the predicative
(pred) increase the precision because of the same
reasons as the Spanish grammars.

The results of SynF and SynF+Cat are almost
identical. The analysis of their outputs shows
that more fine-grained subcategorization classes
including grammatical categories do not have a
contribution to the precision improvement.

5.6 Recall results

The addition of subcategorization information in
the FDGs also contributes to the improvement, al-
most in all the cases, in Spanish as well as in Cata-
lan (Tables 10 and 11). The use of FDGs without
subcategorization involves a decrease in the recall
most of times.

In Spanish, the Baseline grammar contains very
generic rules to capture adjuncts and more fine-
grained subcategorization classes restrict these
rules. For this reason, the recall slightly drops in
SynF and SynF+Cat. As observed in the preci-
sion metric (Section 5.5), small populated classes
related to predicative arguments make recall drop
in the baseline. Consequently, generic rules for
predicative labelling in the Bare grammar and
better populated predicative classes in SynF and
SynF+Cat allows a recovery in recall.

FDGs in Catalan show a similar tendency. In
the Bare grammar, prepositional objects and pred-
icatives are better captured than in the baseline be-
cause the lack of subcategorization information al-
lows rules to apply in a more irrestrictive way. On
the other hand, the addition of subcategorization
information does not seem to help with capturing

more direct objects. Lower results are due to some
verbs missing.

Once again there are no significant differences
between SynF and SynF+Cat, which reinforces
the idea that grammatical categories do not pro-
vide new information for capturing new argument
and adjuncts.

5.7 Analysis of the results

The whole set of experiments demonstrate that
subcategorization improves significantly the per-
formance of the rule-based FDGs.

However, some arguments, such as the prepo-
sitional object and the predicative, are difficult
to capture without subcategorization information.
Meanwhile, there are others, such as the attribute,
that do not need to be handled with subcategoriza-
tion classes.

Proper subcategorization information also con-
tributes to capture more arguments and adjuncts.
The recall scores are stable among the grammars
that use subcategorization information. Secondly,
most of these scores are medium-high precision.

Overall, the results show that the new
CompLex-VS is a suitable resource to improve the
performance of rule-based dependency grammars.

The classification of frames proposed is coher-
ent with the methodology. Furhtermore, it is an
essential resource for the grammars tested since it
ensures medium-high precision results (compared
to medium precision results in the FDGs using the
old CompLex-VS). It is important to consider the
kind of information to define the subcategorization

208



classes because it can be redundant, such as the
combination of syntactic function and grammati-
cal category.

The CompLex-VS lexicon still needs the inclu-
sion of new verbs, since some arguments for verbs
missing in the lexicon are not captured properly.

6 Conclusions

This paper presented two rule-based dependency
grammars in Spanish and Catalan for the FreeLing
NLP library.

Besides the grammars, a new subcategoriza-
tion lexicon, CompLex-VS, has been designed us-
ing frames acquired from the SenSem Corpus.
The new frames have been integrated in the argu-
ment/adjunct recognition rules of the FDGs.

A set of experiments has been carried out to test
how the subcategorization information improves
the performance of these grammars.

The results show that subcategorization frames
ensure a high accuracy performance. In most
cases, the old CompLex-VS frames and the new
CompLex-VS frames show an improvement.

However, the increment is more evident in some
arguments –such as the prepositional object and
the predicative– than others, like the complement
in attributive verbs. These results indicate that
some arguments necessarily need subcategoriza-
tion information to be disambiguated, while others
can be disambiguated just with syntactic informa-
tion.

Furthermore, the new frames of CompLex-
VS provide better results than the initial ones.
Therefore, more fine-grained frames (CompLex-
SynF) contribute to raise the accuracy. Despite
this evidence, fine-grained classes do not neces-
sarily mean improvement of the parser perfor-
mance. The most fine-grained lexicon (CompLex-
SynF+Cat), which combines syntactic function
and grammatical category information, neither im-
proves nor worsens the results of the FDGs.

These conclusions are built on a small set of test
data. Although it is a controlled and representative
evaluation data set, these results need to be con-
trasted with a larger evaluation data set.

It would be interesting to evaluate how the pars-
ing performance improves while subcategoriza-
tion information is added incrementally.
