Abstract

We have created an open-source mapping
between the SIL’s semantic domains (used
for rapid lexicon building and organiza-
tion for under-resourced languages) and
WordNet, the standard resource for lexical
semantics in natural language processing.
We show that the resources complement
each other, and suggest ways in which the
mapping can be improved even further.
The semantic domains give more general
domain and associative links, which word-
net still has few of, while wordnet gives
explicit semantic relations between senses,
which the domains lack.

1 Introduction

In this paper we compare, and semi-automatically
link using Python with NLTK (Bird et al., 2009),
two very different approaches to organizing lex-
ical knowledge. The first is the Semantic Do-
mains (SD) from SIL International.1 SD is a
tool designed to aid in the rapid construction and
subsequent organization of lexicons for languages
which may have no dictionary at all. The second
is the linked concepts from the wordnet (WN)
lexical databases, largely based on the Princeton
WordNet of English (Fellbaum, 1998). This lex-
ical database was designed to be consistent with
models of how human beings process language
and is now widely used in natural language pro-
cessing.

SD is a standard tool in development of dictio-
naries for under-resourced languages. Wordnets
on the other hand, are primarily built for languages
that already have many lexical resources, such as

1“SIL International is a [Christian] faith-based nonprofit
organization committed to serving language communities
worldwide as they build capacity for sustainable language de-
velopment.” http://sil.org

English, Japanese and Finnish (Bond and Paik,
2012).

SD is designed for rapid construction and in-
tuitive organization of lexicons, not primarily for
the analysis of the resulting data. As a result,
many potentially interesting relationships are only
implicitly realized. By linking SD to WN we
can take advantage of the relationships modeled in
WN to make more of these explicit. For example,
the semantic relations in WN would be a useful
input into SD while the domains hierarchy would
enforce the existing WN relations. This will al-
low more quantitative computational modeling of
under-resourced languages.

It is currently an exciting time for field lexicog-
raphy with better tools and hardware allowing for
rapid digitization of lexical resources. Typically,
linguists tag text soon after they collect it. As se-
mantic tags are integrated into the workflow, the
new words are instantly linked to structured data.
We will make it possible to then link them to lan-
guages with fuller descriptions and formal ontolo-
gies.

In the following sections we introduce the re-
sources in more detail (Section 2), then describe
the automatic mapping (Section 3). The results
of the mapping are presented (Section 4) and dis-
cussed (Section 5). Both SD and WN are freely
available under open licenses, and we release our
mapping in the same way (licensed with the Cre-
ative Commons Attribution License (CC-BY).2

2 Resources

In this section we introduce the resources. As
WordNet is more established in the field of com-
putational linguistics, we will mainly describe the
semantic domains.

2.1 Semantic Domains (SD)

SD is a standard tool in descriptive linguistics aid-
ing in dictionary building and organization. It
comprises of nine major headings where similar
domains are placed close to each other. We show
the two upper levels in Figure 2.3 There are sev-
eral versions in circulation for various regional
languages, the latest version is DDP.v4, on which
SD is built. SD draws on a number of thesauri
developed as tools for historical linguists (en-
abling them to track words despite sound change
or meaning shift). An excellent example of such
approach is Buck (1949), which is a dictionary of
synonyms in principal Indo-European languages.
It contains more than 1,100 clusters of synonyms
grouped into 172 domains, listing related words
and reviewing their etymology and semantic his-
tory. It allows to detect changes in meaning and
replacement of older forms by newer forms, of
colloquial or foreign origin. SD are also informed
by English lexicographic resources, including the
20,000 most frequent words from the Corpus of
Contemporary American English (450m words).

Multilingual versions of SD are available, cov-
ering currently besides English also Chinese,
French, Hindi, Indonesian, Khmer, Nepali, Rus-
sian, Spanish, Telugu, Thai, and Urdu.

SD has been built into several standard software
tools for language documentation and description
such as SIL Toolbox, SIL FieldWorks, and WeSay
(Moe, 2013).4

Each domain includes:

• a number for sorting purposes

• a domain label (consisting of a word or short
phrase that captures the basic idea of the do-
main)

• a short description of the domain

• a series of questions designed to help people
think of the words that belong to the domain

• a short list of words under each question that
belong to the domain.

We show examples of the domains in Figure 1.
The semantic domains are released under an open

3The list of domains was developed by Ron Moe, a lin-
guist working with SIL International, and originally called
The Dictionary Development Process (DDP).

There are no explicit relational links between
the domains, although the most common tool
used with it (FLEX5) allows for the addition
of hypernym/hyponym, meronym/holonym,
antonym/synonym and calendar relations. We
show more detailed of a group of domains in Fig-
ure 1. The relations between super and sub do-
mains is generally random. Within each domain
questions are designed to elicit words associated
with the domain, and these can be related in al-
most any way.

2.1.1 Users

We took a survey among the users of SIL Tool-
box and SIL Fieldworks on the respective on-
line fora. Among the 12 respondents, DDP is
mainly used to build dictionaries (72%), organize
them (63%), and let native speakers enrich them
(54%). The option to produce language materi-
als is also valued. Most respondents would ap-
preciate an increased compatibility with other sys-
tems such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) and were
planning to make their dictionaries available on-
line in the future. The DDP tool has been used
in several projects aimed to crowd-source the vo-
cabulary documentation. The RapidWords project
explores rapid vocabulary building where within
2 weeks a substantial dictionary can be compiled,
counting up to 15,000 entries 6.

In our recent experience with Abui7 we were
able to triple the size of the corpus-based lexicon
(about 2,500 entries which took around 10 years
to compile) in just four days, during a workshop
with just 15 Abui speakers. We expect to easily
go over 15,000 words, when we continue for an-
other ten days next year. The structured intuitive
interface of SD is extremely easy to grasp even for
native speakers of under-resourced languages who
only have a basic literacy and received limited or
no formal training. It is a great resource to sub-
stantially increase the amount of information on
the lexicons of under-resourced languages.

The SD method opens up new possibilities for
refining linguistic analysis. As an example of such

Use this domain for general words refer-
ring to the physical universe. Some lan-
guages may not have a single word for the
universe and may have to use a phrase such

such as ’everything you can see’ or ’every-
thing that exists’.

new step is the study of verbal semantics. Abui is
a language with a complex alignment system de-
scribed most recently in Kratochvı́l (2011). There
are multiple parameters determining the realiza-
tion of arguments. SD method enables us to map
the verbal inventory in great detail, map the SD
for Abui onto WN and use computational tools to

test the predictions outlined in Kratochvı́l (2011).
Linguistic description and the accuracy of linguis-
tic analysis will be improved by the compatibility
with WN, a standard resource in natural language
processing.

2.1.2 Access to Lexical Resources

The structure of the SD further opens a possibility
to create useful and refined lexical resources for
the language community, such as dictionaries and
language teaching materials.

Dictionaries using DDP have already been
made available online in projects such as We-
bonary8 or E-kamus2.org for languages of Eastern
Indonesia.9 There are many dictionaries in infor-
mal circulation, because there is no easy way to
publish them online. By linking SD and WN, we
open a possibility for small dictionaries to be pub-
lished in the multilingual WN environment, which
is better established and supported.

2.2 Wordnet (WN)

A wordnet is a semantic lexicon modeled on the
Princeton WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998). Groups of
similar words10 are grouped together into syn-
onym sets (or synsets) which are roughly equiv-
alent to concepts. A combination of a word and
synset defines a sense. Synsets are linked to-
gether by semantic relations, predominantly hy-
peronymy and meronymy, but including many
others. Relations can also link senses to senses
or synsets. Wordnets have been built for many
languages, in this research we use the Prince-
ton WordNet and the Wordnet Bahasa: a word-
net with Malay and Indonesian words linked to
the Princeton WordNet structure (Nurril Hirfana at
al., 2011). Over twenty wordnets have been linked
together as the Open Multilingual Wordnet11 and
there is data for many, many more (Bond and Fos-
ter, 2013). Almost all wordnets have been built for
established languages: building a wordnet from
scratch is a considerable undertaking. The Prince-
ton WordNet is released under an open source li-
cense that allows reuse with attribution , and most
new wordnets (including the Wordnet Bahasa we
use here) are released under a similar license.

The Princeton WordNet has been linked to

many other useful resources, including corpora
(Landes et al., 1998), images (Bond et al., 2008;
Deng et al., 2009), geographical locations, verb
frames (Baker et al., 1998), Wiktionary and
Wikipedia (de Melo and Weikum, 2010; Bond and
Foster, 2013), many NLP tools (Bird et al., 2009)
and ontologies (Niles and Pease, 2001; Gangemi
et al., 2003). Allowing under-resourced languages
to access these is an important goal for this project.

2.3 Comparison

As can be seen from Figures 1 and 2, the rela-
tions between domains are not as strongly typed
as in WordNet, or at all uniform: for example
bodily functions are related to person, but not
as synonyms, hyponyms or meronyms. These
somewhat looser relations are not captured well by
WordNet: the so-called tennis problem (Wordnet
does not link clearly related words such as racket,
ball, net: Fellbaum, 1998). The general associa-
tions of the SDs can go some way to providing
these kinds of links.

3 Mapping

The objective of this task is to map the SD files
to the WN files. Both the Indonesian and English
versions of SD and WN were used. For Wordnet
Bahasa, only the words tagged under Indonesian

were taken. As such, mapping was done for the
same language file (i.e. English SD to English
WN) while across the two languages these two
mappings were merged. As both files are in dif-
ferent formats, they were normalized first. This is
to ensure that words from both the SD and WN file
will be able to match each other during mapping.

To make the mappings more specific, we treat
each question as a class: so we build for exam-
ple: 1.1.s1 “What words are used to refer to the
sky?” which contains the words: sky, firmament,
canopy, vault. We remove any meta informa-
tion in brackets, part of speech information and so
forth. We thus try to link both domains and classes
(we will use the terms interchangeably from here
on).

For both the English and Indonesian WN words,
the underscore character was replaced with a space
to harmonize with the SD words: outer space be-
comes outer space.

3.1 Initial Mapping

For each class in SD, the class name and each
word was looked up in WN, and any matching
synsets recorded (examples are given in Table 1).
It was possible for SD classes to match to WN
synsets through multiple paths: through more than
one word (in either English or Indonesian). Of



SD ID (class) WN Synset Word
6.5.2.4.s3 01202651-v bolt
8.3.1.5.1.s2 00124854-v scroll
7.4.1 05021151-n give
2.1.2.s2 05578911-n girdle
1.6.4.2.s1 01181166-v feed

Table 1: SD-WN ID mapping

course, many of these mappings would be inappro-
priate, due to the ambiguity of the word used as a
pivot, so we need to further constrain the mapping.

We give some examples of words that did not
match in Table 2. Typically the SD title is more
informal than the WN synset entries. For example
SD’s something used to see should map to WN’s
optical instrument “an instrument designed to aid
vision”. The automatic mapping is very much a
lower bound on the number of possible mappings.

3.2 Confirming the mappings

We looked at a variety of sources of information
to improve confidence in the mappings: the struc-
ture of the domains and WordNet, the degree of
polysemy, and the cross-lingual reliability.

3.2.1 Extracting Relations

We compared classes that were in a hierar-
chical relation to see if we could identify
it with one of the relations used in Word-
Net. We used the following semantic relations
from WordNet (hypernym, part meronym,
member meronym, substance meronym ,
part holonym, member holonym, substance
holonym, entailment, attribute, cause, also
see, verb group, similar to). As the objective
of WN and SD is to map semantic relationships
of languages, we did not used formal relationships
such as derivational links.

Some examples of classes linked in this way are
given in Table 3. In general, if we could find a link,
it was good evidence that the synset used in the
link was the correct mapping to the domain. For
example, in Wordnet, dry (SD ID:1.3.3.1) is a hy-
ponym of sear (SD ID:1.3.3.1.s4). As the relations
exist in Wordnet and these two words occurs under
the same ID (1.3.3.1). We consider the Wordnet
mapping to be applicable to Semantic Domains.

Table 4 shows another good example of map-
ping for the SD labels using the WordNet se-
mantic relations. 75% of the related SD words
were mapped to the main words (8.4.1: period of

SD ID Word
1.3.3.1: dry
Hypernym of:
1.3.3.1.s5: sear
1.3.3.1.s4: wither

1.3.3.1.s1: dehydrated, desiccated, dried
1.3.3.1.s4: wither
Similar to:
1.3.3.1.s2: thirsty
1.3.3.1.s1: dehydrated, desiccated, dried
1.3.3.1.s5: sear

time/ janka waktu). For SD word 8.4.1.8 (Special
days/hari-hari khusus), it was unable to be mapped
under 8.4.1 as the expression, for both English and
Indonesian, does not exist in WordNet. While for
8.4.1.1 (Calendar/Kalender), there is no direct se-
mantic relation between the words available Word-
Net synsets and the main word 8.4.1. As such,
8.4.1.8 could not be mapped using WordNet re-
lations (2nd level mapping) even though the word
was mapped with WordNet synsets (1st level map-
ping).

3.2.2 Monosemous Words

If a word is monosemous (that is it only appears in
one synset) then we can assume it links a class to
a synset unambiguously. We give some examples
of such mappings in Table 5. In this case, there is
no ambiguity, so the mapping is good.

3.2.3 Translation

Lexical ambiguity is often language specific and
multiple languages can thus be used to disam-
biguate meanings (Bond and Ogura, 2007). If we
can find matching synsets through pivots in two
languages (in our case English and Indonesian)
then we consider it a good mapping. We give an
example in Table 6.

4 Results

We produced three kinds of mappings:

• class↔ synset: classified as related; monose-
mous; translated. (monosemous, e.g.
1.3.1.3↔ 09411430-n river)

• class↔ class: classified with the WordNet re-
lation. (hypernym↔ hyponym,

• sense↔ sense: this is the direct word
level, sense disambiguated mapping
(class+lemma↔ synset+lemma,
e.g. 7.4.1+give↔ 05021151-n+give ).

The results of the mapping in terms of class↔
synset are summarized in Table 7 (which also
shows the numbers of class↔ class mappings
found). Potential mappings were found for 75%
the domains, but confirmations were only found
for around 21%.

The results for class+lemma↔ synset+lemma
are shown in Table 8: about 69% of the En-
glish and 60% of the Indonesian SD words were
mapped to entries in their respective wordnets.
Out of the mapped SD label names, 27.92% and
31.92%, for English and Indonesian respectively,
were confirmed using the WN semantic relations.
Overall, about 20% of the SD label names were
mapped to the second level.

Thus, the class↔ synset mapping improved as
we go towards the lower levels as there is an in-
crease in monosemous terms. However, the op-

posite occured for the SD-WN Main mapping be-
cause of the difference in word usage and struc-
tures in the two dictionaries. These weaknesses
will be discussed in the following section

5 Discussion and Further Work

This is only the first step in the SD-WN mapping.
The work that was done focuses on linking the SD
words to the WN words before the WN seman-
tic relationship is used to connect the words. As
WN categorizes its words differently than SD, we
expect some relations not to be mapped by the pro-
gram: the cover should not be 100%, and is rarely
one-to-one. In most cases, a single SD class links
to multiple WN synsets.

When we started this process, full SD files were
only available for English and Indonesian. There
are now versions for Chinese and French which we
intend to map to Chinese and French WordNets in
the same way (Xu et al., 2008; Huang et al., 2010;
Wang and Bond, 2013; Sagot and Fišer, 2012).
This should increase the number of monosemous
and translated mappings.

Table 6: Classes that are Matched through Multiple Languages

Most of the SD words that were not mapped to
WN synsets were not lemmas in WN. As shown
in Table 2, these are mainly informal multi-word
expressions, consisting of 4 or more words while
the multi-words expression in wordnet are rarely
of more than 3 words. As that mapping was done
by matching both SD and WN expressions as a
whole, these SD expressions were unable to be
matched with WN. Having formal and informal
names for the concepts (domains/synsets) could be
useful for both resources.

Error analysis found some matches due to in-
consistent structures, which suggest the resources
themselves may need to be revised. For exam-
ple, contact lens is under SD “something used to
see” which we hand-mapped to WN’s optical in-
strument “an instrument designed to aid vision”.
However in WN it is a hyponym of optical device
“a device for producing or controlling light” which
puts it in the same grouping as camera lenses, not
spectacles. It is possible it should inherit from
both, but it should definitely inherit from optical
instrument, as it is an aid to vision. In this case
SD reveals a missing link in WN. The opposite
case was also common.

We intend to use the mapping to generate a
wordnet for the under-resourced language Abui
(Kratochvı́l, 2007). As a part of this process,
we will correct and refine the mapping. We
can then compare, for example, verb classes in
Abui with those in wordnets for English and other
well described languages. Linking descriptions
of under-studied languages to well-studied lan-
guages makes it easier to leverage existing linguis-
tic knowledge.

Even though most classes do not map one-to-
one to WN synsets, the combination of class and
lemma/gloss is generally enough to disambiguate.
For example, consider the class 1.1.1.s2 “What
words refer to how the sun moves”. This links to

at least four WordNet classes risev:16 “come up, of
celestial bodies”, sinkv:6 “appear to move down-
ward”, crossv:1 “travel across or pass over” and
setv:10 “disappear beyond the horizon”. Linking to
these suggests several other possible entries for the
class: go under [the horizon], traverse [the sky].
When we want to build a wordnet for, e.g., Abui,
we would look at the Abui word with the gloss
“go down” sei in the class 1.1.1.s2 and we know
that this links to the synset sinkv:6. Even though
the mapping is not one-to-one, the combination of
mapping and gloss will generally lead to a specific
synset. In addition, WN gives the information that
risev:16 and setv:10 are antonyms and this is true for
the Abui equivalents marang and sei.

The mapping can also be used to help translate
the semantic domains into new languages (assum-
ing there is a wordnet for the language) and to add
new instances of the classes from the wordnets.

Finally, there has been a recent movement
within the wordnet community to make the lex-
ical resources more open (Bond and Paik, 2012;
Bond and Foster, 2013). We hope to show the ad-
vantages of openness (more usable and accessible
data) with the under-resourced language commu-
nity and make the data open in the same way. The
Wordnet-Semantic Domain Mappings themselves
are available for download at the Open Multilin-
gual Wordnet,12 and linked in the search interface.

6 Conclusion

A simple SD-WN mapping was done using the
WN semantic relationships. Even though the pro-
gram was unable to cover all the semantic relation-
ships that exist in both the English and Indonesian
SD data, it provided a basis for further work in
mapping the semantic relationships that are avail-
able in the SD file. The mapping is freely avail-

between wordnet and the semantic domains.
