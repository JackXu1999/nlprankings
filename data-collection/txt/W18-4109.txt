Abstract

ssssss Older adults tend to suffer a decline in some of their cognitive capabilities, being language
one of least affected processes. Word association norms (WAN) also known as free word asso-
ciations reflect word-word relations, the participant reads or hears a word and is asked to write
or say the first word that comes to mind. Free word associations show how the organization of
semantic memory remains almost unchanged with age. We have performed a WAN task with
very small samples of older adults with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD) and
mixed dementia (MxD), and also with a control group of typical aging adults, matched by age,
sex and education. All of them are native speakers of Mexican Spanish. The results show, as
expected, that Alzheimer disease has a very important impact in lexical retrieval, unlike vascular
and mixed dementia. This suggests that linguistic tests elaborated from WAN can be also used
for detecting AD at early stages.

1 Introduction

According to the World Health Organization (2015), aging is a process associated with molecular and
cellular damage, which leads to a general decline of the person and, eventually, its death. Among the
changes caused by age, some degree of cognitive decline is commonly observed in older adults, and
the proportion of elderly people who suffer this decline increases (Rog and Fink, 2013). This decline
has been measured through neuropsychological evaluations, which have shown two common profiles
in elderly people, those who present successful aging, meaning a proper execution in cognitive tasks,
as well as in daily life, and those who present cognitive impairment (Ardila and Rosselli, 2007) or
neurocognitive disorders according to the DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).

As mentioned before, aging causes a general decline in elderly people, which can be observed at
anatomical and physiological levels and it is intimately linked to cognitive and emotional changes (Cum-
mings and Benson, 1992). During senescence, a decrease in memory capacity and learning is represen-
tative of the cognitive profile exhibited, showing a pattern in which forgetfulness rate increases within
the fifth decade of life, while their learning ability is decreased, characteristics that will progress slowly
through time and will give us cues of pathology, especially in people with dementia, where this process
will be particularly accelerated (Ardila and Rosselli, 2007).

Elderly people show more alterations in episodic memory than semantic memory, especially when the
memories need more effort to be remembered (consciousness) than those performed automatically and
based in familiarity. In addition, it is also known that age affects the process of codification, especially
when strategic thinking is needed, and the recovery process, where the use of cues is required to recall
information. Finally, it is common that elderly people show problems in context memories, meaning
the context in which an event was developed, rather than content memory, meaning the memory of the
event, while prospective memory, meaning the ability to remember future events (e.g., remember to do
something or going somewhere), also is affected due to a lack of accessibility to internal cues and auto
initiated processes (Jurado et al., 2013).

On the contrary, the least affected cognitive process by aging is language, a process that has shown
improvement throughout life, especially in items such as vocabulary. Nonetheless, this process can be



86

affected by other elements of cognition, such as memory, which can cause phonologic recovery of words,
provoking anomia commonly known as “tip of the tongue phenomenon” (Jurado et al., 2013).

The problem is very relevant for linguists, because approaching the different types of anomias caused
by illness can help to describe how words are connected in the lexicon. Moreover, there is a lack of
description of the specific language difficulties associated with different illnesses and their stages. To
do that, we propose a Word Association Norms (WAN, from here) approach, that understands lexicon
as linked data, being the change in the of the links the best way to explain the cognitive deterioration.
Having more information about this would help linguists and cognitive scientists to model a theory of
memory.

The present research aims to investigate the type of semantic relationships generated by seven patients
with dementia and their typically aging peers, matched by sex, age and years of education.

From here, our paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces a psychological description of the
types of dementia that we are approaching. Section 3 some basic ideas on Word Association Norms are
provided, as well as their relevance for linguistics, psychology and computer science. In 4, we explain
the experiment, whose results are presented at 5. We finish the paper with the discussion and future work
perspectives at 6.

2 Alzheimer’s Disease, Vascular Dementia and Mixed Dementia

The information obtained about the cognition and lifestyle in elderly people has shown great importance
in the establishment of criteria to diagnose neurocognitive disorders such as dementias- and their origin,
as cognition has specific variations according to the origin of each disorder. In pathological aging the
severity of an impairment, both physical and cognitive, can interfere in various ways in the family, so-
cial and occupational functioning of the subject. The most serious level of pathological aging is known
as dementia (Portellano, 2005). Dementia is a syndrome due to a brain disease, usually of chronic or
progressive nature, which can alter multiple superior cortical functions, also, all alterations in cognitive
function are accompanied by a deterioration of emotional or social control, as well as behavior or moti-
vation (Jurado et al., 2013). All types of dementia involve mental decline that (Alzheimer’s Association,
2006):

• occurred from a higher level (for example, the person didn’t always have a poor memory)

• is severe enough to interfere with usual activities and daily life

• affects more than one of the following four core mental abilities

– recent memory (the ability to learn and recall new information)
– language (the ability to write or speak, or to understand written or spoken words)
– visuospatial function (the ability to understand and use symbols, maps, etc., and the brains

ability to translate visual signals into a correct impression of where objects are in space)
– executive function (the ability to plan, reason, solve problems and focus on a task)

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) are the two most common forms of dementia
(Formiga et al., 2008). AD is characterized by the formation of plaques of the amyloid beta protein
which produces neuronal death (Quiroz Baez, 2010). In VaD, various cognitive alterations are caused
by cerebrovascular diseases (Portellano, 2005). Mixed dementia (MxD), for example, is believed to be
caused by Alzheimer’s disease in combination with some cerebral vascular disease; it represents between
13 and 17% of cases worldwide (Cervantes et al., 2017).

At present, our society experiences an increase in the numbers of years that people live. Although
many benefits, this increase also implies an increase in physical illnesses and cognitive deterioration.
Dementia is one of the illnesses that increases its presence as people get older. One of the areas that
is frequently affected is language. Language problems in dementia tend to be detected when they are
notorious. By that time, there is very little that can be studied or even ameliorated. Thus, it is essential
to evaluate language skills at the early stages of dementia or at least as early as it is diagnosed.

3 Word Association Norms

Word association (WA) tests are an experimental technique for discovering the way that human minds
structure knowledge (De Deyne et al., 2013). In a free word association experiment, the participant reads
or hears a word (stimulus) and is asked to write or say the first word that comes to mind (response)
(Hirsh and Tree, 2001). Free WA tests are able to produce rich types of associations that can reflect both
semantic and episodic memory contents (Borge-Holthoefer and Arenas, 2009).

Word Association Norms (WAN) are collections of WA taken in different populations. From these
collections some measures can be studied. The most frequent word provided as the output of a given
input word is considered as being the first associate (FA). The strength of association of the first associate,
that in the paper is referred as AS, represents the proportion of participants who responded with the same
first associate. This, among other measures, such as total of associates (number of different answers
given), idiosyncratic answers (answers given by only one participant in the whole sample), blank answers
(words to which the participant didn’t give any answer in the established period of time) are calculated
to understand how connected a lexical network is for a group of participants with similar background
(Callejas et al., 2003; Salles et al., 2008).

From the many experiments performed in many languages, it has been concluded that there is unifor-
mity in the organization of associations and people shared stable networks of connections among words
(Istifci, 2010).

We performed a Word Association Norms (WANs) task, also known as free word association task.
WANs are generally taken in young healthy adults, generally, university students. Comparisons between
young and old adults have increased our understanding about the potential effects of aging on deficits in
the lexical network. Generally speaking, comparisons between WANs produced by young and old adults
allow us to conclude that there is very little change in the organisation of semantic memory with age, at
least in word associations (Burke and Peters, 1986; Tresselt and Maizner, 1964). It has been found that in
old adults, the connections in the semantic network are abundant and resistant to deficits (D.G. MacKay,
2001). For example, an overlap of 60.5% in the three most frequent responses between young and old
adults was reported by Burke and Peters (1986). Moreover, these authors retested 2 to 3 months later
part of their study with a subsample from the original and found that both, young and old adults were
consistent in providing the same first associate for word pairs with a high strength of association than
with low strength of association, arguing that old adults do not seem to have a retrieval problem as they
were generating in an automatic fashion their responses which were stored in semantic memory. Hirsh
and Tree (2001) also reported an overlap of 60% between the top three responses of a group of British
young and old adults.

In contrast, research has reported changes in the semantic network exhibited by adults with neurologi-
cal diseases. Kent and Rosanoff (1910) tested 100 words with the participation of 1000 normal subjects as
well as 247 participants with a mental disease dementia praecox, paranoic conditions, manic-depressive
states, epilepsy, among others finding some tendencies about a gradual, but not an abrupt change from a
normal mental state to a pathological one.

Borge-Holthoefer and Arenas (2009) established a relation between cognitive illness and the capability
to walk the graph or our semantic relations. This difficulty could come from the degradation of the graph,
this is the weakening of the links between the words. Following this hypothesis, it is a key aspect of the
research to establish the weight of the regular connections in contrast with the ones showed by patients
with dementia.

According to Clark (1970), the rules of relationship words from free association are based on syntag-
matic and paradigmatic relations. Through this traditional classification, paradigmatic responses belong
to the same grammatical class of the stimulus words and they are generally similar words in conceptual
terms because they share some semantic features (e. g., dog-cat, white-black, eat-drink). While syntag-
matic responses belong to a different grammatical category of the stimulus words, which might appear
next in the same sentence (e. g., house-large, high-giraffe, walk-slowly). Thus, older adult speakers
of English show greater variability in word association unlike young adults, also it has been found that
they tend to provide a greater amount of paradigmatic responses (Burke and Peters, 1986; Lovelance and



88

Cooley, 1982). In contrast to these findings, research with German has reported a decrease in the emer-
gence of paradigmatic responses (K. Riegel and R. M. Riegel, 1964). Most researches focused on this
population concluded that a dominant emergence of paradigmatic responses in word association tasks
exists.

Changes in the predominance of paradigmatic or syntagmatic responses are observed in dementia.
Gewirth et al. (1984) reported that participants with dementia or aphasics tended to provide paradigmatic
responses for nouns and adjectives and syntagmatic for verbs and adverbs. Although the mechanism
producing syntagmatic responses were similar to normal patients, paradigmatic responses were less ef-
ficient in dementia and more random producing then more idiosyncratic responses. Also, dementia
patients tended, more than aphasic or normal adults, to perseverate responses. Eustache et al. (1990)
showed that as the severity of dementia increased, AD patients were less likely to give a frequent re-
sponse. Recently, Preethi and Goswani (2016) showed reduced levels in the first association strength in
a word association task of participants either with dementia or aphasia, but not in neuro-typical partici-
pants. Interestingly, paradigmatic responses were significantly more affected than the syntagmatic ones.
Gollan et al. (2006), as in Gewirth et al.s study, also reported a semantic deficit in AD patients depending
on the type of word. Differences between controls and AD patients were found for strong associated
stimuli (e.g., bride-groom), but not for weak stimuli (e.g., bride-pretty): AD participants generated less
common responses for the strong, but not the weak stimuli. Gollan et al. argued that weak associations
are less semantic, and thus less dependent on meaning.

At present, little is known regarding the potential differences in a semantic deficit that may be encoun-
tered in AD patients as opposed to other dementias. The current work aimed to compare Alzheimer,
mixed and vascular dementia.

4 Method

4.1 Participants

In this study 14 elder adults participated. Half of the participants had dementia and the other half was the
control or healthy- aging group. Dementia group included participants with Alzheimer’s disease (n = 2)
phase one and two, Vascular (n = 3) and Mixed Dementia (n = 2). All of them had previously received
the diagnosis from their physicians. The group consisted in 3 men and 4 women, its mean age was 78.29
years age span was 67 to 85 years old, and the education average 9.28 years. The healthy-aging group
no neurological diseases was formed equivalent as possible in sex, age and years of education to the
Dementia group. Its mean age was 78.14 years (age span 67 to 85 years old) and the average years of
schooling was 9.33 years.

It is important to emphasize that participants selected for the sample were only those whose dementia
progression did not show impairment in most of their daily life basic skills (e.g. toileting or feeding)
according to their physicians and caregivers. It was also taken into consideration their ability or willing-
ness to finish the word association task, causing a significant reduction of the sample. However, as they
were paired with controls through age, gender and educational degree criteria and exclusively compared
with the group that constituted their paired controls, this work can be taken into account as a case-control
study, until more participants can be included to generalize results.

Although our sample does not permit the generalization of the results, it allows researchers to have an
insight about the language changes that take place as a result of each type of dementia and effect of other
variables. However, in the case of vascular dementia results (such as lack of FA) can be determined by
the cause or the region affected by the cerebrovascular accident, having a different effect on cognition
that should be taken into account in future studies with a sample that can allow dividing participants in
subgroups.

4.2 Procedure

Participants performed a free-word association task in which 120 familiar and frequent words in Spanish
were orally presented, one-by-one, by an experimenter who manipulated the laptop in which an appli-
cation presented the input words in a previously set-up order. The experimenter wrote in a computer



89

the participants answers. If after 30 seconds, the participant remained in silence, the experimenter who
received an automatic visual notification after 30 seconds repeated orally once more the input word.
If after another 30 seconds, the patient did not produce an answer, the system automatically exhibited
the following word. If the participant did not produce an answer for three consecutive input words, the
experimenter repeated the instructions and continue with the task.

4.3 Data analysis

The application stored the answers written by the experimenter for further analyses. Initially, two experi-
menters edited the data so that there were no language errors in the answers, for example, orthographical
mistakes. The experimenters also unified the responses using a lemmatization process. In Spanish a
contrast between masculine and feminine exists, where some words in feminine tend to end in a and in
masculine in o. Thus, the answers were unified to the masculine ending (niño, niña was unified to niño).
In the same way, every verbal form has been unified to the infinitive.

Later, an analysis of the lexical relation between every stimulus and its FA was carried out. Every pair
was labelled as a paradigmatic or syntagmatic relation, following the definition given by (Clark, 1970).

5 Results

An analysis with some of the conventional measures reported in word association norms was performed,
including the association strength of the first associate (AS), number of blank answers (BA), and mean
response time (RT) taken to provide the first associate.

For every stimulus the values AF and RF are calculated. AF, absolute frequency refers to the absolute
frequency of syntagmatic and paradigmatic responses. RF, relative frequency, retrieves the percentage
relation between syntagmatic and paradigmatic responses.

The AS, association strength of the FA, first associate, to every stimulus has also been obtained, with
the following formula: being N the total number of answers in the sample for a stimulus word, and F the
frequency of a given response

AS =
F ∗ 100
N

With the aim of evaluating if the means AS (association strength of the first associate), BA (blank
responses), and RT (response time) provided by each of the three experimental groups (AD, MxD and
VaD) were significantly different to their control groups, we performed a series of comparisons.

With the aim of evaluating if the means AS (association strength of first associate), BA (blank re-
sponses), and RT (response time) provided by each of the three experimental groups (AD, MxD and
Vad) were significantly different to their control groups, we performed a series of mean comparisons.

5.1 Statistical Results

Each type of dementia was compared with their control group through t-tests for independent measures.
In the comparison between the group diagnosed with AD and their respective controls for AS significant
differences were observed between both groups (t(234) = −4.17; p < 0.005), where the group with
AD presented less strength in their FA (0.08 ± 0.4) than the control group (0.44 ± 0.83). Also, the
comparison between MxD and their control group for the AS of the FA showed significant differences
between both groups (t(234) = −3.34; p = 0.001), where the control group presented a higher associate
strength (0.76 ± 1.05) than the group with MxD (0.35 ± 0.8). Finally, the group diagnosed with VaD
did not provide a common FA because the responses as FA were different, thus their association strength
was null. This lack of associate strength is significantly different when compared with their control
group (t(234) = −4.589118; p < 0.005), where the control group did present common first associates
(0.3±0.72). For blank answers (BA), significant differences between the AD and the control group were
encountered (t(234) = 14.02; p < 0.005), where the AD group presented blank answers (0.62±0.48) but
the control group didn’t. Non-significant differences were found between MxD and controls (t(234) =
0.85; p = 0.39), where MxD presented a slightly higher number of BA (0.06 ± 0.25) than the control
group (0.04±0.20). Both, the VaD and controls showed a lack of BA. Finally, in the case of reaction times

(RT), significant differences between the AD group and their controls were observed (t(234) = 7.05;
p < 0.005), where the AD group took more time to give an answer (11.57±8.22) than the control group
(5.92 ± 2.79). Similar results were found between MxD and controls (t(234) = −3.08; p = 0.0023),
where the group with MxD took more time to elicit a response (4.675706 ± 2.271421) than the control
group (5.57 ± 2.23). Conversely, non-significant differences were encountered between the VaD and
control groups (t(234) = 1.77; p = 0.07), RT for the VaD group (4.96 ± 2.1) and their control group
(4.51± 1.69). Tables 1 and 2 can help to visualize the results.

To determine differences between dementia groups, an univariate ANOVA was done with groups AD,
MxD and VaD as factors. This ANOVA determined statistically significant differences for AS between
groups (F (2) = 15.199, p < 0.05). Post-hoc tests using Bonferroni corrections showed that the MxD
group AS was higher (M = 0.35, SD = 0.8) than that for the AD group (M=0.0847, SD=0.40459) and
VaD group (no AS generated). Meanwhile for BA, the univariate ANOVA showed significant differences
(F (2) = 139.970, p < 0.05) between AD and the other groups, where AD had more BA (M = 0.62,
SD = 0.48) than MxD (M = 0.06, SD = 0.25) and VaD (no BA were provided). Finally, the
ANOVA for RT showed statistically significant differences (F (2) = 69.737, p < 0.05) where Bonferroni
correction showed that AD group had a slower reaction time (M = 11.57, SD = 8.22) than MxD
(M = 4.67, SD = 2.27) and VaD (M = 4.96, SD = 2.1).

5.2 Syntagmatic and Paradigmatic relations

With the responses provided by the participants (94.8%) a classification according to the type of rela-
tionship between the stimulus and its response was carried out. The classification took into account
syntagmatic and paradigmatic relations (Clark, 1970), as well as unclassifiable responses (e. g., idiosyn-
cratic responses or onomatopoeias). Overall, the participants showed a higher proportion of paradigmatic
responses (51.63%), followed by the syntagmatic responses and unclassifiable responses (47.42% and
0.94%, respectively). Table 5.2 presents the Absolute frequency (AF) and Relative frequency (RF) for
both paradigmatic and syntagmatic responses. AF refers to the total number of responses and RF to the
proportion (calculated by dividing the AF by the total number of cases) from participants with AD, MxD,
VaD, and their respective control groups.

The AD group and control group differed in the proportion of paradigmatic and syntagmatic responses

generated. Most responses of the AD participants were syntagmatic (64.85%), followed by paradigmatic
(30.91%), whereas those in the control group had a higher amount of paradigmatic responses (61.67%),
followed by syntagmatic (37.08%). The results showed significant difference between the type of re-
sponses for both groups χ2 (2, N = 4) = 37.95, p = 0.00000001. With respect to older adults with
MxD, they showed a discrete higher proportion of paradigmatic responses (55.81%) as the control group
(50.99%), syntagmatic responses in both groups were 44.19% and 48.73%, respectively. Non-significant
differences were encountered χ2 (2, N = 6) = 2.55, p = 0.28. Finally, the VaD group and the control group
had similar percentages of paradigmatic (49.79% and 52.50%, respectively) and syntagmatic responses.
Non-significant differences in paradigmatic responses were found between the two groups (χ2 (2, N =
4) = 1.26, p = 0.53). As it can be seen, groups of participants with MxD and VaD dementia do not differ
from their controls in the type of response provided. However, there are significant differences between
groups -AD, VaD, and MxD- in the relationships they established χ2 (4, N = 7) = 39.50, p = 0.0000001.
Those differences are mainly due to contrasts between the AD group and the other two groups MxD and
VaD.

6 Discussion

Quantitative results suggest the existence of difficulties to access the lexical semantic memory in partic-
ipants with dementia, illustrated by the higher quantity of first associates produced by the control group
(typically aging group). The difficulties in processes that access lexical memory have been previously
studied in typically aging people (Rabadán et al., 1998) and participants with dementia, showing in both
groups progressive language problems which onset is present at an early aging-stage (Jaramillo, 2010).
We also found differences in the participants’ responses according to the type of dementia. The number
of AS was higher in MxD compared to AD, while the VaD group showed a lack of associate strength
consistent with evidence of greater deficits on semantic memory in this group (Graham et al., 2004).

Similarly, deficits were found when blank answers were analyzed, especially in the groups diagnosed
with AD and MxD. This kind of deficits have been previously observed in tasks such as category fluency,
confrontational naming task and similarity judgments tasks; therefore, some authors affirm that they are
the result of the alteration of semantic memory, which affects the meaning of words, concepts and facts
(Jurado et al., 2013).

Furthermore, the increase of reaction times was higher in the groups diagnosed with AD and VaD,
which can be related to a decrease in processing speed. Salthouse (1996) and Salthouse et al. (2002)
propose that the variance of times observed in almost all cognitive tasks can be explained through the
generalized decrease of processing speed. A consequence of the initial decrease in processing speed in
complex tasks is to prevent the person to rely on the necessary information to complete the next phase of
the task, which could be related to the performance in the task, especially to the number of blank answers
produced by the AD and the MxD groups.

Regarding the type of lexical relationships, a greater proportion of paradigmatic responses was ob-



92

served in both groups of participants with MxD and VaD and their typically-aging peers. Our results
follow the same dynamics reported in previous research with neuro-typical older adults. Also, the data
of this research agree with the findings about the preference for paradigmatic associations in the popula-
tion of older adults with typical aging (Lovelance and Cooley, 1982; Burke and Peters, 1986). In contrast
to other research (Gewirth et al., 1984; Preethi and Goswani, 2016), the paradigmatic responses of the
participants with MxD or VaD were not affected. In this sense, it can be inferred that mixed and vascular
dementia do not affect the type of lexical relationships that often predominate in older adults. However,
in the case of participants with AD a different phenomenon was observed. Syntagmatic responses were
generated in greater proportion, similar to the types of responses provided by young children children
younger than 8 years (Ervin, 1961; McNeill, 1970).

The current results indicate that AD causes a change (or regression) in the type of lexical relationships
provided by participants. Changes in lexical associations might be taken as a predictor of AD. It seems
that, according to this results, a new way for detection of Alzheimer could be developed, based on the
types of associations that the patients retrieve. Usually, the strength in the FA is considered to be a good
indicator for Alzheimer, but this feature is difficult to test when only one user is compared to a large
sample. However, the tendency to provide more syntagmatic than paradigmatic word associations can be
a first clue to determine AD. This should be an important line of research to be developed in the future.
On the other hand, it would be very interesting to understand how other types of dementia affect word
retrieval and the organization of memory. It would be worthwhile to expand the sample to confirm that
the presence of these specific conditions does not change the pattern of response.
