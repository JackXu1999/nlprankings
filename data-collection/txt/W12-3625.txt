Abstract 

We present a novel scheme for annotating the 

realization and ellipsis of Korean particles. 

Annotated data include 100,128 Ecel (a space-

based word unit) in spoken and written corpo-

ra composed of four different genres in order 

to evaluate how register variation contributes 

to Korean particle ellipsis. Identifying the 

grammatical functions of particles and zero 

particles is critical for deriving a valid linguis-

tic analysis of argument realization, semantic 

and discourse analysis, and computational 

processes of parsing. The primary challenge is 

to design a reliable scheme for classifying par-

ticles while making a clear distinction be-

tween ellipsis and non-occurrences. We 

determine in detail issues involving particle 

annotation and present solutions. In addition 

to providing a statistical analysis and out-

comes, we briefly discuss linguistic factors 

involving particle ellipsis. 

1 Introduction 

In Korean, the grammatical function of a nominal 

is represented by a morphologically-attached post-

positional particle. Particles involve a wide range 

of linguistic information such as grammatical rela-

tions (subject, object), semantic roles (Agent, Pa-

tient, Location, Instrument, etc.), 

discourse/pragmatic properties, such as topic 

markers, delimiters and auxiliary particles, as well 

as conjunctions. Due to their complex linguistic 

functions, particles are one of the most rigorously 

investigated topics in Korean linguistics.   

   In example (1), the particle ka indicates subjecthood 

and ul refers to objecthood.

     today-TOP M-SUBJ classroom-in lunch-OBJ   eat-ENG 

      ‘Mina eats lunch in the classroom.’ 

 

The subject particle ka also marks Agent (semantic 

role); the locative particle eyse combines with a 

nominal referring to Location; un marks topichood 

in the given discourse, etc. 

   In spite of their linguistic function (representing 

the grammatical relations of subject and object), 

these particles frequently disappear, particularly in 

spoken Korean (Hong et al., 1998; Kim and Kwon, 

2004; Lee and Thompson, 1985; Lee 2006, 2008). 

Previous studies have mainly focused on case par-

ticles and suggested that register variation is the 

key factor in particle ellipsis. However, few studies 

have comprehensively examined both spoken and 

written data with specific annotation features and 

guidelines. By using balanced spoken and written 

data, this paper explores the realization of all parti-

cles and ellipsis of case particles including subject 

and object case. In order to test the effect of regis-

ter variation on particle realization, we designed a 

balanced corpora to include four different styles. 

The spoken corpora include everyday conversa-

tions, informal monologues (story-telling), TV de-

bates, and lectures/speeches; the written corpora 

include personal essays, novels, news articles, and 

academic papers.  

    Categorizing particles requires a well-articulated 

classification. Particles have complex grammatical

functions, and it is difficult to determine if a miss-

ing particle is a case of ellipsis or non-occurrence. 

We discuss these challenges in the context of de-

veloping a novel annotation scheme and guidelines. 

We examine particle ellipsis patterns across regis-

ters, as well as semantic and pragmatic factors 

triggering particle ellipsis. 

2 Relevant Background 

Within theoretical linguistics, Korean particles 

have been classified according to three distinct lin-

guistic functions: case particles, auxiliary particles, 

and conjunctive particles (Nam, 2000; Lee, 2006)
2
. 

A case particle combines with an argument or ad-

junct nominal and specifies the grammatical rela-

tion and semantic role of the nominal within the 

argument structure of a predicate. In contrast to 

case particles, auxiliary particles are not based on 

the grammatical relation of a nominal and a predi-

cate; they introduce extra semantic and discourse 

interpretations. This category includes topic mark-

ers and delimiters, as well as other particles with 

diverse lexical meanings. In addition, there are 

conjunctive particles that attach to nominals and 

connect them to the following ones. 

   Identifying the diverse functions of particles is 

important for syntactic, semantic, and discourse 

analyses in Korean. When a particle is elided, re-

covering the information behind a missing particle 

is essential for determining accurate grammatical 

relations, which is a prerequisite for computational 

processes of parsing, discourse analysis, machine 

translation, etc. However, the recovery process for 

missing particles does not include auxiliary parti-

cles as candidates due to their unpredictable distri-

butions; auxiliary particles have their own 

discourse and pragmatic meanings, and their dis-

tributions over nominals are not restricted by 

grammatical relations with predicates.  

    On the one hand, the validity of recovering a 

missing particle into its original form itself can be 

questionable; it has been argued in the literature 

that zero marking is the unmarked option and there 

is no ellipsis or deletion of particles (Lee and 

                                                           
2 Although particles combine with nominals, they sometimes 

follow a verbal phrase or a sentence adding semantic and 

pragmatic meanings of honorification, focus, etc. Some re-

searchers assign these particles to a special category (Nam, 

2000). In this study, we only examine particles combining 

with nominals and not with phrasal or sentential categories.  

Thompson, 1989; Fujii and Ono, 2000 inter alia). 

However, whether a particle is deleted or origi-

nates as a zero form, it is important that a missing 

particle corresponds to a particular case particle 

and identification of it is crucial for determining 

the grammatical and semantic function of the bare 

nominal.   

    With respect to particle ellipsis in Korean and 

also Japanese, most previous research has focused 

on subject and object particles. There have been 

contradictory reports on the dropping rates of these 

particles. Whereas Kwon (1989) and Hong et al. 

(1998) report a higher dropping rate for subject 

particles, Kim and Kwon (2004) and Lee (2006) 

argue for a higher dropping rate for object case 

markers in colloquial Korean. Among these studies, 

Hong et al. (1998) analyzes different radio shows 

with a total time span of 60 minutes and Lee 

(2006) analyzes the Call Friend Korean (CFK) 

corpus of telephone speech. Even disregarding the 

small data size (the former with fewer than 2000 

noun phrases and the latter with 1956 overtly ex-

pressed subject and object NPs), the statistical re-

sults are less than convincing given the lack of a 

specific annotation scheme and guidelines. For 

example, Hong et al. (1998) include nominals with 

some topic markers or delimiters as tokens of case 

marker ellipsis. However, as mentioned in Lee (2008), 

these cases need to be excluded from the list of case 

ellipsis because the subject or object particles are mor-

phologically restricted from co-occurring with auxiliary 

particles in Korean. Although Lee (2008) excludes op-

tional occurrences of object particles in light verb con-

structions, it is not quite clear how non-occurrences of 

particles are separated from ellipsis of particles in the 

corpus study without specific guidelines. In order to 

develop a more comprehensive analysis of case ellipsis, 

it is necessary to employ large data sets with different 

registers across spoken and written Korean and a well-

established annotation scheme and guidelines.   

 

3 The Data and Annotation Scheme  

3.1    Data 

 

 We extracted 100,128 Ecel with morphological 

tagging from the Sejong Corpora to create spoken 

and written balanced corpora composed of four 

different registers with different degrees of 

formality. Approximately 2000 Ecel were each 

176



selected from 49 files to build balanced corpora.

3.2   Annotation Scheme  

In agglutinative languages like Korean, particles 

are attached to preceding nominals without spaces, 

and identifying the position of a particle requires 

accurate segmentation. Although we extracted data 

with morphological tags, the tags sometimes re-

flected errors in spacing, morpheme identification, 

segmentation, etc. Therefore, we manually correct-

ed relevant errors in segmentation and morpheme 

tags before performing annotation. Using mor-

pheme tags, we identified all the nominal catego-

ries in the corpora that can combine with particles, 

including all the nominals with and without parti-

cles. We annotated realized particles and deter-

mined their categories using the tag set in Figure 1. 

In addition, we selected four annotation features to 

mark up particle realization and ellipsis.  The given 

tag set has been used to annotate both realized par-

ticles and missing particles. However, annotating 

missing particles presents challenges and requires a 

new annotation scheme. Elided particles are recov-

ered using the  case particles based upon grammat-

ical relations between a nominal and a predicate. 

The details are presented in the next section.

3.3. Ellipsis vs. Non-Occurrence of Particles 

 

As defined in Fry (2001), ellipsis is the phenome-

non whereby a speaker omits an obligatory ele-

ment of syntactic structure. However, there are at 

least three morpho-syntactic constructions in Ko-

rean where a particle does not need to be recovered 

because it is not obligatory in the given position. 

Our annotation distinguishes these optional non-

occurrences from the particle ellipsis phenomenon 

and marks them separately.  

    First, the occurrence of the genitive case uy is 

optional depending on various syntactic and se-

mantic relation between two nominals in Korean. 

For example, the genitive uy tends to disappear 

after a complement nominal of a verbal noun, e.g., 

yenghwa-uy/Ø chwalyeng (movie-GEN + filming) 

'filming of a movie', whereas it appears after a sub-

ject nominal of a verbal noun, e.g., John-uy/*
?
Ø 

wusung (John-GEN + winning) 'John's winning'. 

Due to complex linguistic factors, there is still con-

troversy regarding how to predict occurrences of 

the genitive case in Korean (Lee, 2005; Hong, 

177



2009), and native speakers' intuitions on the posi-

tions of the dropped genitive particle and its recov-

erability vary.
4
 Therefore, we chose not to annotate 

the genitive particle uy when it does not occur and 

we do not count particle ellipsis within a nominal 

phrase. 

    Second, particles are optional in light verb con-

structions, as mentioned in previous research (e.g., 

Lee and Thompson, 1989; Lee and Park, 2008). In 

Korean, the morphological formation of a Sino-

Korean (or foreign-borrowed) verbal noun  and the 

light verbs (LV) hata 'do', toyta 'become', and 

sikhita 'make' is very frequent, e.g., silhyen (ac-

complishment)+hata/toyta/sikhitato 'accomplish 

/to be accomplished/to make it accomplish', stheti 

(study) +hata, 'to study' etc. In these light verb 

constructions, the subject particle i/ka or the object 

particle ul/lul can appear after the verbal nouns as 

in silhyen-ul hata (accomplishment-OBJ do), 

silhyen-i toyta (accomplishment-SBJ become), 

silhyen-ul sikhita (accomplishment-OBJ make),  

stheti-lul hata (study-OBJ do), etc. Realization of 

these case particles, however, is not mandatory and 

even unnatural when the argument of a verbal noun 

appears in the same sentence, as in the following 

example. 

 
(3) ?*John-i  kkum-ul     silhyen-ul                    hayssta.   

         J-nom  dream-OBJ  accomplishment-OBJ did 

         'John accomplished his dream.' 

  

In considering the morpho-syntactic unity of 

N+LV combinations as single predicates and the 

awkwardness of a realized particle after a verbal 

noun, we conclude that N + LV combinations do 

not involve case ellipsis.
5
 However, when these 

LV combinations include negation, the negative 

                                                           
4 Although semantic change and lexical insertion can be used 

for identifying morphological compounds, it is still very diffi-

cult to distinguish nominal compounds and syntactic nominal 

complexes. Therefore, school grammars present some incon-

sistent distinctions. For example, wuli nala (we country) 'our 

country' is considered a single lexical word, a compound nom-

inal, whereas the similar combination, wuli kacok (we family) 

'our family' is a complex NP composed of two separate nouns. 
5 It is also arguable whether the realization of a particle after a 

verbal noun is based on the subcategorization feature of the 

light verb hata or toyta.  Through personal conversations, 

some scholars suggest that the realization of a particle after a 

verbal noun may be a case of insertion. When adopting this 

argument, particle omission is not even possible for the LV 

constructions. This needs to be more thoroughly investigated 

through examining historical corpus data.  

adverb intervenes between a verbal noun and the 

LV, and the particle i/ka or ul/lul follows the ver-

bal noun. In those constructions, we exceptionally 

assume particle ellipsis. This decision affects the 

result of our corpus analysis due to the high fre-

quency of LV combinations, particularly with re-

spect to object particle ellipsis. In contrast, Lee and 

Thompson (1989) assume particle ellipsis in N+LV 

combinations unless there is another nominal with 

an object particle licensed in front of the verbal 

noun. Although we exclude particle ellipsis in light 

verb constructions, we separately mark up possible 

case realizations of LV combinations in order to 

measure the extent to which they affect the statisti-

cal results.       

    Third, optional particles frequently appear with 

bound nouns (or defective nouns) in Korean. 

Bound nouns refer to nominals that do not occur 

without being preceded by a demonstrative, an ad-

noun clause, or another noun, which includes tey 

'place', ttay 'time' swu 'way', ke(s) 'thing', cwul 

'way', check  'pretense', etc. 

 
(4) hakkyo-eyse kongpwuha-l swu(-ka)       issta. 

      school-at       study-REL       way (-NOM)   exist 

      'It is possible to go to study at school.' 

 

Bound nouns are functionally limited with respect 

to neighboring constituents. For instance, a bound 

noun ttay 'time' only combines with a clause end-

ing with the adnominal ending -(u)l, whereas hwu 

'after' combines with a clause ending with -(u)n.
6
 

In addition to morpho-syntactic reliance on the 

preceding clause, many bound nouns form formu-

laic expressions with the following predicates (i.e., 

the bound noun swu 'way' only combines with ex-

istential predicates, issta 'exist' and epsta 'do not 

exist'). Considering that particles in bound nouns 

are frequently dropped and do not represent gram-

matical relations of bound nouns with respect to 

the predicate, we also exclude them as cases of 

ellipsis.

6 For bound nouns in Korean, refer to Sohn (1999).  
7
 Classifiers belonging to bound nouns show interesting  pat-

terns of case particle realization in Korean; classifiers form 

morphosyntactic combinations such as [Noun + Number + 

Classifier], e.g., sakwa han kay (apple one thing) 'one apple'. 

Normally, a case particle appears on the initial content noun or 

the final classifier (e.g. [sakwa-ka/lul han kay][ [sakwa han 

kay-ka/lul]) or there is a copy of the case particle from the 

content noun (e.g.[sakwa-ka/lul han kay-ka/lul]). In this study, 

178



    In addition to optional particles, we also note 

that some constructions mandatorily require non-

occurrence of particles. We have already seen that 

the genitive particle is not allowed within nominal 

compounds, e.g. [palcen+Ø(*-uy) keyhwoyk+Ø(*-

uy)  pokose] 'development plan report'. In addition, 

some bound nouns form formulaic (or idiomatic) 

expressions with their neighboring words and do 

not combine with particles, e.g., kes-(*kwa)+ 

kathta (thing-(*with) + similar) 'seem', ke-Ø + 

aniya (thing + isn't) 'isn't it?', N-Ø + ttaymwun (N 

+ reason), etc.  

     Also, particle omission is required by the lexi-

cal properties of nominals. For example, numbers 

belonging to the nominal category combine with 

subject or object particles as well as with other 

auxiliary and discourse particles (e.g., tases-un/-i/-

ul 'five-TOP/SBJ/OBJ'). However, they cannot take 

any particle when followed by count bound nouns, 

e.g., tases-Ø + kay/salam/pen/kaci/... (five + 

items/people/sorts, etc.). Similarly, time nominals 

such as onul 'today', ecey 'yesterday', nayil 

'tomorrow' stand alone without particles as adver-

bial phrases even though they combine with other 

particles in different syntactic positions. In contrast, 

time nominals such as onul achim 'this morning' 

and 2000 nyen 'year 2000' can stand alone but also 

combine with the time particle ey. These temporal 

eys are considered to be optional.  

      In summary, optional and mandatory non-

occurrence of particles restricted by morpho-

syntactic and lexical constraints needs to be distin-

                                                                                           
as long as there is one particle realized in either the content 

noun or the classifier, we do not count it as case ellipsis.   

guished from the omission of obligatory particles. 

Therefore, we include the following features to 

annotate bare nominals that do not mandate recov-

ery of particles.  

E    -  Non-occurrence of a particle based upon 

 lexical or morpho-syntactic constraints. 

N   -  Non-occurrence of a particle after a 

 nominal that forms a compound with the 

 following nominal 

L -  Non-occurrence of a particle in light verb 

 constructions 

 

In addition, nominals can be combined with copula 

ita or appear at the end of a phrase or a sentence 

without the copula in Korean. These predicate 

nominals have been annotated separately from oth-

er nominals. When a nominal is repeated by mis-

take with or without a particle, these erroneous 

nominals are separately marked and excluded from 

counts of particle realization and ellipsis. Separate 

features are given to handle these cases.    

 
P-  Predicate nominals combining with 

 copula ita. It also marks a nominal  standing   

 alone without ita, as answering utterance.   

ER - Errors including a repeated nominal by 

 mistake or an incomplete utterance

3.4   Principles of Annotating Particle Omission 

and Inter-Annotator Agreement  

 

Our annotation principles of missing particles are 

presented as follows: 

 

 With respect to missing particles, we annotate 
only obligatory case particles and conjunctive 

particles while excluding discourse/modal par-

ticles. This captures the minimum needed for a 

particle prediction system.  

 In the process of recovering elided forms, there 
are cases in which more than one particle 

could be correct. Instead of selecting a single 

best particle, we present a set of multiple can-

didates without preference ranking.  

 Particle stacking is allowed in Korean. We an-
notate stacked particles as single units without 

separating them into smaller particles. Howev-

er, their segmentation is specified under the 

annotation feature of realized particle type. 

Missing particles, however, exclude stacked 

particles. Most particle stacking includes a dis-

course/modal particle that adds its specific 

meaning to the attached nominals.  

 

Based on our annotation scheme and guidelines, 

two experienced annotators manually annotated 

realized particles, missing particles, and their types 

on the spoken and written corpora separately and 

cross-examined each other's annotation. Difficult 

cases were picked out and discussed with each oth-

er to reach an agreement. In order not to overly 

inflate the values with words that do not take parti-

cles, we removed words that do not belong to the 

nominal categories (nouns, pronouns, bound nouns, 

and numbers). The realized particles were provided 

to the annotators with the morphological analysis. 

Thus, we decided to compute the inter-annotator 

agreement on only 466 nominals with no particles 

within 5000 Ecels (before cross-examination). The 

kappa statistic on the case ellipsis by the two anno-

tators is 91.23% for the specific particles. The 

agreement rate is much higher than we expected, 

but can be attributed to the annotation guidelines, 

which were clear and limited recovery of particles 

to case particles not including auxiliary and dis-

course particles. The two annotators were highly 

trained, having over two years of experience with 

particle annotation tasks.   

 

4   Corpus Analysis 
 

Table 2 summarizes the results of particle annota-

tion of all the nominals, and Table 3 focuses on 

particle realization and ellipsis. Table 2 shows all 

nominal realizations with particles and without. 

Zero particles include both bare particle ellipsis 

and bare nominals including nominals that do not 

require particles as a component of compound 

nominals (N) and nominals that appear without 

particles in the corpora although they may option-

ally (E). In addition, the spoken corpora include 

bare nominals used as vocative phrases without 

particles. These cases have been counted separate-

ly. Erroneous usage of nominals only appears in 

the spoken corpora. Light verb combinations here 

only include cases that may allow realization of 

subject or object case particles, whose numbers are 

significantly high both in the spoken corpora and 

the written corpora.    

      As we see in Table 3, the overall case ellipsis 

rates are not that high across the two registers, but 

the difference between the spoken and the written 

corpora is significant (χ
2
=851.78, p <.001).

Furthermore, genre plays an even more significant 

role within the spoken corpora. Particle ellipsis in 

everyday conversations is significantly more fre-

quent than in monologues, debates, or lectures us-

ing a Bonferroni adjusted alpha level of .008 per 

comparison (.05/6). (χ

χ

ticle ellipsis in monologues is significantly more 

frequent with debates or lectures ( χ

p<.001; χ
2
(1)=126.59, p<.001). In contrast, particle 

ellipsis between debates and lectures shows a low-

er chi-square value than the other cases, although 

the value is still significant. (χ

(1)==11.72, p<.001).

Overall dropping rates of subject particles and ob-

ject particles show a difference between the spoken 

and the written corpora. Object particle dropping is 

significantly more frequent in the spoken corpora 

than in the written corpora (χ
2 

=797.03, p<.001). 

Within the spoken corpora, there is also some vari-

ation according to genre. Both subject and object 

dropping rates increase as the genres become less 

formal. In everyday conversations, the dropping 

rate of object particles reaches 49% and the drop-

ping rate of subject particles is  37%. While the 

dropping rates of both particles decrease in the 

formal registers of the spoken corpora, the drop-

ping rate of the object particles is consistently 

higher than the dropping rate of the subject parti-

cles at each register. In parallel, conjunctive parti-

cles and other case particles are more frequently 

dropped in the spoken corpora than in the written 

corpora.

    Our findings can be summarized as follows: 

 In Korean, particle ellipsis is not very frequent. 
The particle dropping rate for subjects is 12% in 

the spoken corpora and 2% in the written corpora.  

 The effect of register variation on particle ellip-

sis (everyday conversations vs. debates & lec-

tures) demonstrates that particle dropping is less 

preferred in formal contexts. However, formality 

                                                           
9 Unexpectedly, conjunctive particles drop more frequently in 

monologues than in everyday conversations.  

per se is not the deciding factor, but a partially 

related factor.
10

  
 Across the spoken corpora, object particles drop more 

frequently than subject particles. (χ
2 
=115.17, p <.001)  

 Other case and connective particles are also more 
frequently elided in the spoken corpora.       

 

5   Linguistic Properties in Particle Ellipsis 
 

The frequent case particle ellipsis in the spoken 

corpora suggests that discourse need to be further 

investigated. This implies that discourse factors 

contribute to particle ellipsis, as suggested in Lee 

and Thompson (1989). Using the corpus annota-

tion, we can explore linguistic properties involving 

in particle ellipsis.   

 

 5.1  Definiteness and Specificity 

 

A case particle is likely to be dropped when the 

preceding noun is definite or specific (Kim, 1991). 

The definite NP ku haksayng 'that student' can drop  

subject case. This contrasts with the fact that the 

indefinite expression etten haksayng ‘some stu-

dent’ cannot appear without the subject particle.  

   

 

 

                                                           
10 This can be supported by the fact that register variation does 

not affect particle dropping in the written corpus.

             that s tudent-SBJ/Ø   I-OBJ   visit-PAST-END 

             ‘That student visited me.’ 

       b.  etten haksayng-i/*Ø    na-lul chacawa-ss-e.  

             some student-SBJ /Ø I-OBJ    visit-PAST-END 

            ‘Some student visited me.’ 

In our annotated corpus, the particles that are at-

tached to personal pronouns and wh-pronouns are 

frequently dropped. This implies that definiteness 

is a crucial factor for licensing particle dropping.
11

   

 

5.2  Familiarity and Salience in Discourse 

 

Particle ellipsis is also based on discourse proper-

ties of familiarity (background).
12

  In the following 

example, it is more natural to drop the object parti-

cle from tampay 'cigarette' when speaking in a 

convenience store. This is because selling ciga-

rettes is already familiar knowledge shared among 

the discourse participants.  

 
(6)   tampay-

?
lul/-Ø      cwu-seyyo. 

       cigarette-OBJ-Ø     give-IMPERATIVE 

       ‘Please give me cigarette.’ 

 

However, when the object particle is used in (6), 

the object cigarette is exclusively designated or 

highlighted. This contrasts with the fact that the 

speaker commonly uses a nominal referring to dis-

course participants such as you and I, proper names, 

or titles without a particle in order to catch the at-

tention of the listener(s). Also, when a subject or 

object nominal is scrambled out of its original po-

sition and appears at the sentence initial or final 

position, the particle disappears to emphasize the 

salience of the nominal element, as in (7).   

 
(7)    a. philyohan-n        kel     hanato     mos tule, na-Ø.  

             necessary- REL   thing  anything not   take   I-Ø    

            'I cannot take anything that is necessary.' 

                                                           
11 Lee (2006, 2010) argues that case ellipsis of subjects and 

objects interacts with the definiteness of nominals. The rate of 

case ellipsis for strongly definite subject NPs is significantly 

higher than the rate for weakly definite NPs. However, object 

case ellipsis works in the opposite direction. It is difficult to 

identify definiteness of a nominal in Korean, where definite 

and indefinite articles do not exist. We have not annotated 

definiteness features in our corpora, but intend to as part of 

future work.   
12 Similarly, Lee and Thompson (1989) propose that 

"sharedness between communicators" is the pragmatic factor 

determining object particle ellipsis in discourse. 

           b. saylo   o-n            sensayng-Ø (ul),  ne    alla? 

               newly  come-REL  teacher-Ø (OBJ)   you  know 

              'Do you know the new teacher?' 

 

Examination of our annotated corpora strongly 

suggests that particle ellipsis is associated with two 

contrastive discourse properties, familiarity and 

salience, and also that it interacts with other 

grammatical mechanisms such as word order, lexi-

cal category, and possibly prosody.
13

  

6 Final Remarks 

In this study, we presented our annotation work on 

particle realization and ellipsis using spoken and 

written corpora in Korean. A new annotation 

scheme and principles were presented, along with 

challenging issues and solutions, such as the re-

covery of missing particles and the distinction be-

tween ellipsis and non-occurrence of particles.   In 

order to evaluate the effect of register variation on 

particle ellipsis, we incorporated four different 

genres. Our major finding is that the rate of particle 

ellipsis in Korean is not as high as generally as-

sumed and register variation is a significant factor 

only in spoken corpora. The more informal dialogs 

are, the more often particles are elided. Our corpus 

annotation suggests that particle ellipsis is related 

to activated semantic/pragmatic constraints among 

discourse participants, which include definiteness, 

specificity, familiarity and salience.       

   The implication of these findings is significant 

not only for linguistic theory, but also for language 

processing, Korean language teaching, and transla-

tion. Particle ellipsis will be a more serious issue 

for computational modeling that incorporates in-

formal spoken dialogs than for computational pro-

cessing on written texts. In language teaching, 

particles need to be emphasized more for formal 

writing and formal speaking based on their fre-

quency in the given register (Lee et al., this vol-

ume). Next, we plan to run error detection software 

on our corpus to verify the consistency of our an-

notation (Dickinson and Meurers, 2003), to prepare 

for releasing the data with guidelines, to further 

analyze the results of the annotation, and to ad-

dress more elaborate linguistic implications in the 

annotated data. 

                                                           
13 Case ellipsis and realization have been also examined within 

information structure-based analyses such as Lee (2006, 2010) 

and Kwon and Zribi-Hertz (2008)
