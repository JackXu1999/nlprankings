Abstract

The paper proposes an LTAG semantic
analysis to derive semantic representations
for different focus constructions in a uni-
form way. The proposal is shown via ex-
amples of different narrow focus construc-
tions, multiple foci and focus in questions.

1 Introduction

This paper proposes an analysis in Lexicalized
Tree-Adjoining Grammar (LTAG) (Joshi and Sch-
abes, 1997), that calculates the semantic rep-
resentations of various focused sentences based
on their syntactic structure and intonation pat-
tern. The paper presents a proposal of extend-
ing the focus analysis of Balogh (2009) with the
LTAG syntax-semantic interface from Kallmeyer
& Romero (2008). Balogh (2009) provides a
context-based approach of focusing, that gives a
logical-semantic analysis of (narrow) focus con-
structions within the framework of Inquisitive Se-
mantics (Groenendijk, 2009). One of the cen-
tral claims of the analysis is that focusing leads
to a special theme/rheme division of the utter-
ance, that further relates it to the underlying con-
text, and as such it regulates the coherent dialogue
flow. This approach investigates the interpretation
of focus from a semantic/pragmatic perspective,
providing an analysis of phenomena as question-
answer congruence and the exhaustive interpre-
tation of answers. However, the analysis lacks
an important part – the syntax-semantics inter-
face –, that builds the semantic representations as
theme-rheme structures of natural language sen-
tences driven by their syntactic structure.

1.1 Aims
The main aim of the current paper is twofold. It
wants to broaden the coverage of linguistics anal-
yses in LTAG and as a primary aim it wants to fill
this gap of Balogh (2009) by proposing an analy-
sis of the syntax-semantics interface that provides
the semantic representations of the different kinds
of focus constructions. These representations can
further be interpreted according to the desired se-
mantic/pragmatic framework: Inquisitive Seman-
tics (InqS) (Groenendijk, 2009). The choice for
the logical-semantic system of InqS as opposed
to, e.g., Alternative Semantics (Rooth, 1992)1 has
several motivations. One of the main aims in fa-
vor of InqS is, that its semantics and dialogue
management system offers an elegant way to ana-
lyze various discourse-related phenomena involv-
ing focus such as: focusing in answers, question-
answer relations, contrast in denial and specifica-
tion by focusing. The analysis in this paper con-
centrates on narrow focus constructions, however
a proposal of extending it to broad focus construc-
tions and focus projection is also given.

2 Frameworks

The analysis proposed in this paper offers a com-
positional way to calculate the semantic represen-
tations for different (narrow) focus constructions
in a uniform way. The analysis of the syntax-
semantics interface as introduced here is pro-
vided within the framework of Lexicalized Tree-
Adjoining Grammar, LTAG (Joshi and Schabes,
1997) with a semantic component as developed
by Kallmeyer & Joshi (2003) and Kallmeyer &
Romero (2008).

1As in the proposal from Babko-Malaya (2004), that in-
tegrates LTAG with Alternative Semantics.

2.1 LTAG Semantics

For the semantic representation I adapt the LTAG
semantics based on unification as introduced
by Kallmeyer & Romero (2008). In this ap-
proach each elementary tree comes with a feature-
structure and a (flat) semantic representation, each
of them consisting of a set of labelled propositions
and a set of scope constraints. These propositions
and constraints contain meta-variables of individ-
uals, propositions or situations, all of them given
by boxed numbers. The feature structures are all
linked to a semantic representation and by substi-
tution and adjunction of the trees, feature struc-
tures get unified and the meta-variables get val-
ues. Also the semantic representation of the re-
sulting tree is calculated by taking the union of the
representations of the participating trees. For an
illustration of LTAG semantics see Example 2.1,
the derivation of the question Who walks? assign-
ing the semantic representation as ?∃x.walk(x).
Example 2.1 Who walks?

S

NP↓I= 1 ,whmax= 4
whmin= 3

SP= 8

VPP= 8P=l1

walks

l0 : ? 4 , l1 : walk( 1 )
4 ≥ 3 , 3 ≥ 8

NPI=x,whmax= 6
whmin= 7

who

l2 : ∃x 5
6 ≥ l2, 5 ≥ 7

The S-tree of ‘walks’ comes with a seman-
tic representation consisting of two propositions:
l0 contributes the question-operator applied to a
proposition given here as the meta-variable 4 .
The proposition l1 says, that the predicate walk
is applied to the individual variable 1 that is con-
tributed by the NP-tree substituted to the given po-
sition: given by I = 1 on the feature structure
of the substitution node. Here, two special fea-
tures are introduced: WHMAX and WHMIN. These
features are inspired by the idea of a wh-scope
window from Romero & Kallmeyer & Babko-
Malaya (2004) and by the MAXS and MINS fea-

tures from Kallmeyer & Romero (2008) that indi-
cate the scope window of a given quantificational
phrase. The features MAXS and MINS determine
the maximum and minimum scope of quantifica-
tional NPs such as ‘someone’ or ‘everyone’, while
WHMAX and WHMIN indicate the scope window
for (wh-)questions and for focus. Separating these
two different scope windows has the advantage
to account for, e.g., quantifying into questions.
Next to the propositions l0 and l1, the scope con-
strains 4 ≥ 3 , 3 ≥ 8 are defined that deter-
mine the scope relations between the given propo-
sitions. The scope constrains are defined between
the propositional meta-variables and the proposi-
tional labels.

The NP-tree of the wh-phrase gets substituted
into the S-tree of ‘walks’ resulting in the equa-
tions 1 = x, 4 = 6 , 3 = 7 and since nothing is
adjoined at the VP node2, we have 8 = l1. After
these equations the combination of the semantic
representations results in:

l0 : ? 4 , l1 : walk(x), l2 : ∃x 5
4 ≥ 3 , 3 ≥ l1, 4 ≥ l2, 5 ≥ 3

Following these scope constraints, the possible
plugging is: 4 7→ l2, 5 7→ l1, 3 7→ l1, resulting
in the semantic representation as ?∃x.walks(x).

2.2 Inquisitive Semantics

In the semantic representation I follow the
language of Inquisitive Semantics, serving the
broader purpose to integrate the current analysis
with a component of semantic-pragmatic inter-
pretation and discourse modeling (e.g. modeling
question-answer relations). The semantic repre-
sentation ?∃x.walks(x) is the translation of the
wh-question Who walks? according to the logical
system of InqS.

As already introduced before, in my analysis I
adapt several ideas of the system of Inquisitive Se-
mantics (Groenendijk, 2009). The main aim be-
hind this framework is to create a logical system
that models the flow of a coherent dialogue. The
principal goal is to provide a model of information
exchange as a cooperative process of raising and
resolving issues. In the semantic interpretation of
utterances, the main source of inquisitiveness is
disjunction. The disjunction of two propositions

2To keep the examples easier, none of the following ex-
amples contain adjunction at the VP node, so in later exam-
ples I will skip the P features at the VP and S nodes.

74



is naturally interpreted as providing the informa-
tion that one of the two propositions is true and
also raising the issue which one of them is true.
Hence the disjunction p ∨ q provides two possi-
bilites: either p is true or q is true, while eliminat-
ing the option that both of them are false.

Consider now the meaning of a question. Ac-
cording to the classical theories3, the meaning of a
question is the set of its (true/complete) answers.
Hence the meaning of the polar question Is it rain-
ing? (?p) is identified by the set of two proposi-
tions it is raining (p) and it is not raining (¬p)
and the questioner wants to know which one of
the two holds. Since the questioner is interested
whether p or ¬p is the case, the question ?p can
be defined as the disjunction of its two possibil-
ities: p ∨ ¬p, hence in general questions can be
defined in terms of disjunction: ?φ = φ ∨ ¬φ.
The main conclusion that can be drawn here is
that like questions, disjunctions have the charac-
teristic of introducing possibilities, and they both
get an alternative interpretation.

The system of InqS is developed in such a way
that sentences can provide data (informativeness)
and raise issues (inquisitiveness). In terms of
these two notions three meaningful sentence types
can be defined: (i) assertions: informative and not
inquisitive, (ii) questions: inquisitive and not in-
formative, and (iii) hybrids: informative and in-
quisitive. Such a hybrid type is the proposition
p ∨ q, that provides the information that ¬p ∧ ¬q
is not the case, while it raises the issue which
one of p or q is true, thus it gives two possibili-
ties. The question ?(p ∨ q) is not informative, it
does not exclude anything, it only raises the is-
sue whether p or q or ¬p ∧ ¬q is the case (three
possibilities).4 Similarly to p ∨ q the predicate
logical expression ∃x.φ also provides the infor-
mation that ¬∃x.φ is not the case and addition-
ally it raises the issue which individuals are φ.
It leads to several possibilities depending on the
number of individuals in the domain. Take, for
example, the proposition ∃x.P (x) and a small do-
main of three individuals D = {a, b, c}. The
existential expression ∃x.P (x) then excludes the
option that none of a, b, c is P , and raises the is-
sue which one is P . Relative to the given domain

3e.g. (Hamblin, 1973; Karttunen, 1977)
4Note, that ?φ is not a separate category in the syntax of

the logical language, but it is defined in terms of disjunction
as given above.

D, this expression leads to the set of three possi-
bilities: P (a), P (b), P (c). Following this line, I
assume the standard logical translation of a con-
stituent question to be of the form ?∃x.φ. A con-
stituent question is interpreted as a set of possi-
bilities, corresponding to its possible answers. I
give a Hamblin-style interpretation of questions
as sets of propositions, however with the crucial
difference that in my analysis the set contains the
proposition nobody is P as well. The wh-question
Who walks? is translated as ?∃x.walk(x) which
is the same as the disjunction of the proposi-
tions (possibilities) walk(d1) ∨ walk(d2) ∨ ... ∨
walk(dn)∨¬∃x.came(x) relative to the given do-
main of individuals.

In the logical language of Inquisitive Seman-
tics all utterances are claimed to be divided into a
theme and a rheme, where the rheme corresponds
to the information content of the given utterance
and the theme to the issue that the utterance ad-
dresses. Balogh (2009) proposes an analysis of
focused sentences claiming that focusing leads to
a special theme-rheme division. Next to the paral-
lelisms with the distinction of new and old infor-
mation in the generative view, an important differ-
ence is that in this analysis the sentences itself are
not split into two parts, but the way is defined how
to signal the inherent issue (theme) of the utter-
ance and the data it provides (rheme). The theme
of an utterance is a question, and as such it is in-
quisitive, introducing two or more possibilities. In
order to derive the special theme and rheme of a
focused sentence Balogh (2009) defines the Rule
of Division by focusing.

Definition 2.2 Rule of Division
Let α be an utterance in natural language, α′ the
translation of α in the language of InqS and \ the
operation: ϕ\ = ψ if ϕ =?ψ, otherwise ϕ\ = ϕ.

Every utterance α is divided into a theme and
rheme: TH(α);RH(α) where
TH(α) = ?∃~x(α′[ ~aF ′/~x])\; and
RH(α) = α′

This definition correctly derives the theme-
rheme division of various narrow focus construc-
tions, that further get interpreted in the sys-
tem of InqS. This proposal provides a context-
based analysis of focusing with special atten-
tion to question-answer congruence, exhaustivity,
contrast in denials, and specification. However,
the system of Balogh (2009) lacks the syntax-

75



semantics interface. As it can be seen in Defini-
tion 2.2, focus marking of constituents get directly
translated in the logical language as φF not refer-
ring to the syntactic structure and the contribution
of the focused constituent.

The analysis proposed in this paper wants to
fill this gap defining the syntax-semantics inter-
face, that provide the correct semantic representa-
tion (theme-rheme pair) on basis of the syntactic
structure of the utterance.

3 Proposal

As a starting point, the current analysis suggests
the semantic representations of utterances consist-
ing of two components: one that represents the
theme and one that represents the rheme. Accord-
ing to this, each S-tree comes with a semantic rep-
resentation as the following:

〈 l0 : ? i , l1 : R
n( t1 , ..., tn )

{ i ≥ j , j ≥ l1, ...}
l1 : R

n( t1 , ..., tn )
{constraints}

〉

In this two-component representation the above
part is the representation of the theme, while the
below one is the representation of the rheme. De-
fined in this way all S-trees come with a seman-
tic representation, where the theme will lead to a
question: the issue behind, and the rheme leads to
a proposition: the semantic content.

3.1 Narrow focus constructions

The representation of focusing first of all has to
provide different structures for the different (nar-
row) focus constructions. Consider first the basic
cases of a sentence with a transitive verb: (i) none
of the arguments is focused, (ii) the subject is fo-
cused or (iii) the object is focused. All these sen-
tences lead to different theme-rheme divisions:

(1) Pim likes Sam.
; TH: ?like(p, s) + RH: like(p, s)
PIMF likes Sam.
; TH: ?∃x.like(x, s) + RH: like(p, s)
Pim likes SAMF .
; TH: ?∃y.like(p, y) + RH: like(p, s)

Take first the sentence Pim likes Sam that is
built of three elementary trees, the S-tree of the
verb and two NP-trees of the two arguments.

Example 3.1 Pim likes Sam

S

NP↓I= 1 ,whmax= 4
whmin= 3

VP

VP=l1

likes

NP↓I= 2 ,whmax= 4
whmin= 3

〈 l0 : ? 4 , l1 : like( 1 , 2 )
4 ≥ 3 , 3 ≥ l1
l1 : like( 1 , 2 )

〉

NPI=x,whmax= 8
whmin= 7

Pim

〈
l2 : pim(x)

l2 : pim(x)

〉

NPI=y,whmax= 10
whmin= 9

Sam

〈
l3 : sam(y)

l3 : sam(y)

〉

By substituting the NP-tree in the S-tree the
features on the nodes get unified (thus 1 =
x, 2 = y) and the corresponding semantic repre-
sentations are combined, resulting in the semantic
representation of the sentence as:

〈 l0 : ? 4 , l1 : like(x, y), l2 : pim(x),
l3 : sam(y), 4 ≥ 3 , 3 ≥ l1
l1 : like(x, y), l2 : pim(x),l3 : sam(y)

〉

There is one way of plugging possible here:
4 7→ l1, 3 7→ l1 , that derives the semantics rep-
resentation of the given sentence as the following,
where the theme corresponds to the polar question
Does Pim like Sam? and the rheme corresponds
to the proposition Pim likes Sam.

〈
?like(x, y), pim(x), sam(y)

like(x, y), pim(x), sam(y)

〉

3.1.1 Subject / object in focus
Sentences consisting of a transitive verb have

the possibilities of narrow focus: either the sub-
ject or the object (or both) can be focused. First,
look at the sentences in (1) with single focus. The
analysis derives the rheme as the proposition Pim
likes Sam for both, while the different focus struc-
tures lead to two different themes corresponding

76



to the inherent questions: Who likes Sam? and
Whom does Pim like? respectively.

In the analysis of PIMF likes Sam with narrow
focus on the subject, we take the S-tree of ‘likes’
as above and substitute two NP-trees: for the non-
focused object the tree for ‘Sam’ as in Example
3.1, while for the focused subject we take the tree
for ‘Pim’ with its special semantics:

NPI=x,whmax= 8 ,foc=+
whmin= 7

Pim

〈 l2 : ∃x 11 ,
8 ≥ l2, 11 ≥ 7
l2 : pim(x)

〉

The semantic representation of the focused NP
contributes a special theme as an existential ex-
pression. The substitutions of the two NPs car-
ried out and the respective meta-variables unified:
1 = x, 2 = y, 8 = 4 , 7 = 3 , that leads to the
semantics:

〈 l0 :? 4 , l1 : like(x, y), l2 : ∃x 11 ,
l3 : sam(y), 4 ≥ 3 , 3 ≥ l1,
4 ≥ l2, 11 ≥ 3
l1 : like(x, y), l2 : pim(x), l3 : sam(y)

〉

Again, one way of plugging is possible here:
4 7→ l2, 11 7→ l1, 3 7→ l1 providing the
twofold semantic representation corresponding to
the question Who likes Sam? as the theme and
the proposition Pim likes Sam as the rheme of the
utterance.

〈
?∃x.like(x, y), sam(y)
like(x, y), pim(x), sam(y)

〉

The analysis of Pim likes SAMF is similar, we
take the sam S-tree for the non-focused subject we
substitute the tree for ‘Pim’ as before and for the
focused object we substitute the tree for ‘Sam’ as:

NPI=y,whmax= 10 ,foc=+
whmin= 9

Sam

〈 l3 : ∃y 12
10 ≥ l3, 12 ≥ 9
l3 : sam(y)

〉

The two substitutions here lead to the semantic
representations before and after plugging:

〈 l0 :? 4 , l1 : like(x, y), l2 : pim(x),
l3 : ∃y 12 , 4 ≥ 3 , 3 ≥ l1,
4 ≥ l3, 12 ≥ 3
l1 : like(x, y), l2 : pim(x), l3 : sam(y)

〉

〈
?∃y.like(x, y), pim(x)
like(x, y), pim(x), sam(y)

〉

Similarly to the previous example, this repre-
sentation corresponds to the question Whom does
Pim like? as the theme and to the proposition Pim
likes Sam as the rheme.

3.2 Multiple focus
After showing the basic cases, let us now turn to
more complex examples such as multiple focus.
In sentences formed of a transitive verb, not only
single focusing is possible, but also both argu-
ments can be focused in the same time: PIMF
likes SAMF . The rheme or information con-
tent of this sentence is again the proposition Pim
likes Sam, while the theme or underlying issue is
the multiple wh-question Who likes whom? The
analysis derives the correct theme-rheme division
straightforwardly, by substituting the NP-trees of
the focused arguments (see in the previous sec-
tion) into the S-tree of ‘likes’ (see Example 3.1).
The substitutions of the focused subject and ob-
ject lead to the semantic representation:

〈 l0 :? 4 , l1 : like(x, y), l2 : ∃x 11 ,
l3 : ∃y 12 , 4 ≥ 3 , 3 ≥ l1, 4 ≥ l2,
11 ≥ 3 , 4 ≥ l3, 12 ≥ 3
l1 : like(x, y), l2 : pim(x), l3 : sam(y)

〉

Here, two different pluggings are possible: (i)
4 7→ l2, 11 7→ l3, 12 7→ l1, 3 7→ l1 and (ii) 4 7→
l3, 12 7→ l2, 11 7→ l1, 3 7→ l1, yielding two se-
mantic representations, where the representations
of the theme are slightly different: at plugging
(i) ?∃x∃y.like(x, y) and at (ii) ?∃y∃x.like(x, y).
Since we have existential expressions, these two
representations are equivalent, both correspond-
ing to the question Who likes whom?

3.3 Focus in questions
The analysis proposed above gives also a straight-
forward derivation of a special construction, when

77



an argument is focused within a wh-question as,
e.g. ‘Who likes SAMF ?’ Such examples appear
in, e.g., answering strategies , where the goal is
to resolve a question, which can be reached via
answering all of its (easier) sub-questions. As
Roberts (1996) shows, the question ‘Who likes
whom?’ can be resolved by the strategy of replac-
ing the original question with its sub-questions,
where the sub-question is only felicitous if it is
appropriately focused. For an illustration, con-
sider the answering strategy of the multiple wh-
question ‘Who likes whom?’:

(2) Who likes whom?
Who likes SAMF ?

Does Sam like Sam?
Does Tom like Sam?
. . .

In the derivation of ‘Who likes SAMF ?’ we
take the S-tree of ‘likes’ (example 3.2) and substi-
tute the elementary trees of the wh-phrase ‘who’
and the focused object ‘Sam’ (example 3.3):

Example 3.2 S

NP↓I= 1 ,whmax= 4
whmin= 3

S

NP

�

VP

VP=l1

likes

NP↓I= 2 ,whmax= 4
whmin= 3

〈 l0 : ? 4 , l1 : like( 1 , 2 )
4 ≥ 3 , 3 ≥ l1
l0 : ? 4 , l1 : like( 1 , 2 )
4 ≥ 3 , 3 ≥ l1

〉

Example 3.3 ‘who’ and ‘SAMF ’
NPI=x,whmax= 6

whmin= 7

who

NPI=y,whmax= 10
whmin= 9 ,foc=+

Sam

〈 l2 : ∃x 5
6 ≥ l2, 5 ≥ 7

l2 : ∃x 5
6 ≥ l2, 5 ≥ 7

〉〈 l3 : ∃y 12
10 ≥ l3, 12 ≥ 9

l3 : sam(y)

〉

By substitution of the two NP-trees we get the
equations 1 = x, 2 = y, 4 = 6 = 10 , 3 =
7 = 9 on the theme side and 1 = x, 2 = y, 4 =

6 , 3 = 7 on the rheme side. This gives us the
still underspecified semantic representation:

〈
l0 : ? 4 , l1 : like(x, y), l2 : ∃x 5 , l3 : ∃y 12
4 ≥ 3 , 3 ≥ l0, 4 ≥ l2, 5 ≥ 3 ,
4 ≥ l3, 12 ≥ 3

l0 : ? 4 , l1 : like(x, y), l2 : ∃x 5 , l3 : sam(y)
4 ≥ 3 , 3 ≥ l0, 4 ≥ l2, 5 ≥ 3

〉

Similarily to the example with multiple foci,
at the theme side of this example two plug-
gings are possible, that derive the representations
?∃x∃y.like(x, y) and ?∃y∃x.like(x, y) that are
equivalent. On the rheme side only one plug-
ging is possible, that derives the representation
?∃x.like(x, y), pim(y). Hence, the analysis cor-
rectly derives the theme and the rheme of ‘Who
likes PIMF ?’ as the multiple wh-question ‘Who
likes whom?’ and the single wh-question ‘Who
likes Pim?’ respectively.

4 Conclusion and further issues

The approach introduced here is a proposal to-
wards an analysis of focus constructions using
LTAG with a unification based semantics. The
analysis derives the theme/rheme divisions of
different (narrow) focus constructions including
multiple foci and focusing in questions.

(3) Pim likes Sam.
; TH: ?like(x, y), pim(x), sam(y)
; RH: like(x, y), pim(x), sam(y)

PIMF likes Sam.
; TH: ?∃x.like(x, y), sam(y)
; RH: like(x, y), pim(x), sam(y)

Pim likes SAMF .
; TH: ?∃y.like(x, y), pim(x)
; RH: like(x, y), pim(x), sam(y)

PIMF likes SAMF .
; TH: ?∃x∃y.like(x, y)
; RH: like(x, y), pim(x), sam(y)

The advantage of this analysis is that all four
sentences bear the same propositional content
(rheme), while the different focus structures lead
to different inherent issues (theme) indicating that
these sentences are felicitous in different contexts.
Consequently, they relate to four different wh-
questions, which offers a straightforward way to
deal with the basic cases of question-answer con-
gruence. This analysis follows the core ideas of

78



the context-based approach of Balogh (2009), that
concentrates merely on the interpretation of dif-
ferent focus structures. The above analysis pro-
vides an extension to the syntax-semantics inter-
face of Kallmeyer & Romero (2008). It deter-
mines the semantic representations as assumed in
Balogh (2009) on basis of the syntactic structures
of the sentences in a straightforward, intuitive and
compositional way.

Since this paper is a report of a work in
progress, several loose ends can be pointed out.
First of all an analysis of the relation of accent
placement and focus has to be given to deal with,
among others, the phenomenon of Focus Projec-
tion (Selkirk, 1996). The second important issue
to investigate is the relation of focusing and quan-
tifier scope as one of the main reasons of choosing
LTAG as the framework of the syntax-semantics
interface. The semantic component of LTAG as
introduced by Kallmeyer & Romero (2008) of-
fers an analysis of scope ambiguities. In their
analysis scope windows are introduced for quan-
tificational NPs by the features MAXS and MINS
signalling the maximal and minimal scope sides.
Focus and questions also bear scope properties,
different from the scope properties of quantifica-
tional NPs. To offer a uniform analysis of the sim-
ilarities and differences of these scope sides, this
paper introduces the features WHMAX and WH-
MIN as the scope window for focus and questions
(inspired by Romero & Kallmeyer & Babako-
Malaya (2004)). The distinction of the two dif-
ferent scope windows gives the possibility to deal
with the relation of focusing and quantifiers as
well as quantifying into questions.

4.1 Focus marking and accenting

In section 2, the proposal of the analysis of narrow
focus constructions was introduced, deriving a
two-fold semantics of utterances representing the
theme (underlying issue) and the rheme (proposi-
tional content). Focused constituents contribute
a special semantics to the theme of the sen-
tence meaning, yielding the corresponding wh-
question. Each elementary tree of a focused con-
stituent came with a different semantic represen-
tation as their non-focused counterpart. Focus
marking can be signaled within the feature struc-
ture of the given elementary tree, introducing the
feature FOC with possible values + and - for fo-
cused and non-focused occurences.

In the previous examples all NP arguments are
proper names with an elementary tree of a noun
phrase without further inner structure and the fo-
cus feature can appear at the maximal projection.
However, for an elegant account for focusing we
need to be able to give an analysis of the place-
ment of the pitch accent and the focus marking.
Hence, we have to account for Focus Projection as
well as focus marking within a complex NP. Fol-
lowing Selkirk’s (1996) Focus Projection princi-
ple, the same accenting can receive different focus
marking, hence different focus interpretation. As
her focus marking principles suggest, pitch accent
on the noun can lead to a narrow focus interpreta-
tion or to a broadad (VP) focus interpretation:

(4) a. John rented [a BICYCLE]F .

b. John [rented a BICYCLE]F .

An important issue for the current approach is,
how to analyze the relation between the placement
of the pitch accent and the marking of the focused
constituent. For this we need to introduce two fea-
tures FOC and PITCH that stand for focus marking
and accenting respectively. The placement of the
pitch accent is given by the feature pitch = +
coming from the lexicon together with the lexi-
cal anchor. The value of the pitch accent is then
passed to the FOC feature that appears on some
nodes of the elementary tree of the noun phrase.

NP
foc= 1

N3foc= 1
foc= 1 ,pitch= 1

As for the focus projection, the + value of the
FOC feature can be optionally passed up from the
rightmost NP argument to the higher VP node
marking the possible focus projection (FPP). This
is not possible from the subject position (or from
the not right-most argument), the focused NP in
that position gets narrow focus intrepretation.

S

NP↓ VPFPP= 1

V� NP↓ NP↓foc= 1
However, the picture is more complex, since

by focusing we have to deal with (at least two)
different issues: (i) the information structure of
the sentence: which part of the content is the

79



Focus / Topic / Background as defined in for-
mal pragmatic terms; (ii) the coherent discourse:
what is “given / retrievable” and “non-given / no-
retrievable” information.

Towards an account of these issues, first of all,
we take focus as a pragmatic notion, defined as
the part of the answer that corresponds to the wh-
part of a question. Following this definition, the
FOC feature is passed to the maximal projection
of the noun phrase, marking the whole NP as the
focus of the sentence. This raises the issue how
we can deal with complex NPs like ‘a green bi-
cycle’ where either the noun or the adjective gets
the accent. In case the noun is accented ‘a green
BICYCLEF ’, it passes the focus marking to its
maximal projection, and the whole noun phrase
will be in focus. In case, that the adjective is ac-
cented ‘a GREENF bicycle’ we can still mark the
whole NP as focus, however we have to deal with
the notion of giveness as well. Consider the fol-
lowing examples:

(5) context1: John attended a conference
where the participants rented vehicles to
move around.
What did John rent?

a. John rented [a BICYCLE]F .

b. John rented [a green BICYCLE]F .

(6) context2: John attended a conference
where all participants rented different
kinds of bicycles to move around.
What did John rent?

a. #John rented [a BICYCLE]F .

b. #John rented [a green BICYCLE]F .

c. John rented [a GREEN bicycle]F .

d. John rented [a TANDEM]F .

In context 2, the wh-question is approporiate
although the information that the rented vehicles
are all bicycles is given. The answer in (6c) is
felicitous with the focus marking of the whole
NP as the corresponding to the wh-phrase of the
question. Focus marking of the whole NP is thus
possible even if some part of the NP is already
given. Consequently, we need to distinguish the
notions of focus and given information. This ex-
ample supports the notion of focus in pragmatic
terms and the proposed analysis of focus marking.

4.2 Focus and quantifier scope

The paper introduces the special scope window
for focus and questions by the new features WH-
MAX and WHMIN. These features follow the idea
of MAXS and MINS from Kallmeyer & Romero
(2008), however, in the previous examples we
only discussed cases having only the focus win-
dow. In case we have both a quantificational NP
and a focused constituent in the sentence, the dis-
tinction of the two scope windows get relevant
and important. Consider, for example, the sen-
tence SOMEONEF walks. as an answer of the
wh-question Who walks? In this example a quan-
tificational NP is in focus, and its theme (issue)
refers to the focus/question-window by the fea-
tures WHMAX/WHIMN, while its rheme (content)
makes use of the scope window by MAXS/MINS.

Example 4.1

SP= 5

NP↓I= 1 ,whmax= 2 ,maxs= 4
whmin= 3 ,mins= 6

VPP= 5P=l1

walks

〈 l0 : ? 2 , l1 : walk( 1 )
2 ≥ 3 , 3 ≥ l1, 4 ≥ 5 , 3 ≥ 4 , 6 ≥ 5
l1 : walk( 1 )
4 ≥ 5

〉

NPI=x,whmax= 7 ,maxs= 9
foc=+,whmin= 8 ,mins= 10

someone

〈 l2 : ∃x. 17
7 ≥ l2, 17 ≥ 8
l2 : ∃x. 15 ∧ 16 , l3 : person(x)
15 ≥ l3, 9 ≥ 16 , 16 ≥ 10

〉

By substitution of the NP-tree of ‘someone’
(with focus) into the S-tree of ‘walk’, we de-
rive the semantic representation of the sentence
SOMEONEF walks as the following.

〈
l0 :? 2 , l1 : walk(x), l2 : ∃x 17
2 ≥ 3 , 3 ≥ l1, 4 ≥ l1, 3 ≥ 4 , 6 ≥ l1,
2 ≥ l2, 17 ≥ 3
l1 : walk(x), l2 : ∃x 15 ∧ 16 , l3 : person(x)
15 ≥ l3, 4 ≥ 16 , 16 ≥ l1

〉

80



That correctly derives – after plugging – the
theme of the sentence as the wh-question Who
walks? while the rheme as the proposition
someone walks.

〈
?∃x.walk(x)
∃x.person(x) ∧ walk(x)

〉
