Abstract

While contextualized word representations
have improved state-of-the-art benchmarks in
many NLP tasks, their potential usefulness
for social-oriented tasks remains largely un-
explored. We show how contextualized word
embeddings can be used to capture affect di-
mensions in portrayals of people. We evaluate
our methodology quantitatively, on held-out
affect lexicons, and qualitatively, through case
examples. We find that contextualized word
representations do encode meaningful affect
information, but they are heavily biased to-
wards their training data, which limits their
usefulness to in-domain analyses. We ulti-
mately use our method to examine differences
in portrayals of men and women.

1 Introduction

Pre-trained contextualized word embeddings (Pe-
ters et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2019; Radford et al.,
2018) have become increasingly common in natu-
ral language processing (NLP), improving state-
of-the-art results in many standard NLP tasks.
However, beyond standard tasks, NLP tools are
also vital to more open-ended exploratory tasks,
particularly in social science. How these types of
tasks can benefit from pre-trained contextualized
embeddings has not yet been explored.

In this work, we show how to leverage these em-
beddings to conduct entity-centric analyses, which
broadly seek to address how entities are portrayed
in narrative text (Bamman et al., 2013; Card et al.,
2016). For instance, in the sentence “Batman ap-
prehends the Joker”, a reader might infer that Bat-
man is good, the Joker is evil, and Batman is more
powerful than the Joker. Analyzing how people
are portrayed in narratives is a key starting point
to identifying stereotypes and bias (Joseph et al.,
2017; Fast et al., 2016; Field et al., 2019).

Existing methods for analyzing people portray-
als take either an unsupervised approach (Bam-
man et al., 2013), which requires large amounts
of data and can be difficult to interpret, or rely
on domain-specific knowledge (Fast et al., 2016;
Wagner et al., 2015), which does not general-
ize well to other hypotheses and data domains.
Furthermore, most models are limited to discrete
word-level features, whereas continuous-valued
embeddings are typically more expressive. We in-
troduce a novel approach to analyzing entities that
maps contextualized embeddings to interpretable
dimensions.

Specifically, we propose using pre-trained em-
beddings to extract affect information about tar-
get entities. Social psychology research has
identified 3 primary affect dimensions: Potency
(strength/weakness of an identity), Valence (good-
ness/badness of an identity), and Activity (active-
ness/passiveness of an identity) (Osgood et al.,
1957; Russell, 1980, 2003). We refer to these di-
mensions as power, sentiment, and agency for
consistency with prior work in NLP (Sap et al.,
2017; Rashkin et al., 2016; Field et al., 2019).
Thus, in the previous example, “Batman appre-
hends the Joker”, we might associate Batman with
high power, high sentiment, and high agency.

While much literature in NLP has examined
sentiment, analyses of power have largely been
limited to a dialog setting (Prabhakaran, 2015),
and almost no work has examined agency. We
propose that mapping entities into these 3 dimen-
sions provides a framework for examining narra-
tives that is more holistic than sentiment analyses
and more generalizable than task-specific frame-
works. The idea that these 3 dimensions are suffi-
cient for capturing affect has also formed the basis
of social psychological models (Heise, 2007; Al-
hothali and Hoey, 2015).

Drawing from this theory, we combine con-



2551

textualized word embeddings with affect lexicons
(Mohammad, 2018) to obtain power, sentiment,
and agency scores for entities in narrative text. Af-
ter describing our methodology (§2), we evaluate
how well these contextualized embeddings cap-
ture affect information on held-out lexicons (§4.1).
We then evaluate how well our method scores en-
tities on manually curated benchmarks (§4.2) and
through qualitative examples (§4.3). Finally, we
use our method to examine different portrayals of
men and women (§5), focusing on the same do-
mains as prior work (Wagner et al., 2015; Fu et al.,
2016). Ultimately, our work suggests that contex-
ualized embeddings have the potential to improve
analyses of entity portrayals. However, we find
that these representations are biased towards por-
trayals in the training data, which limits their use-
fulness to analyzing in-domain data.

Our contributions in this work include: (1) a
novel method for analyzing entities in a narrative
that is both interpretable and generalizable, (2) an
assessment of how well contextualized word em-
beddings capture affect information, and (3) an
analysis of entity portrayals in various domains.

2 Methodology

Given an entity, such as “Batman”, mentioned in
a narrative, our goal is to obtain power, senti-
ment, and agency scores for the entity. We take
two approaches: supervised regression and semi-
supervised embedding projection. For both ap-
proaches, we use pre-trained contextualized em-
beddings as features and we use the NRC Valence,
Arousal, and Dominance (VAD) Lexicon as train-
ing and test data (Mohammad, 2018). While we
use this lexicon because its annotations contain
our target dimensions of power, sentiment, and
agency, our methodology readily generalizes to
other lexicons.

2.1 Regression Model

In the regression model, we take a supervised ap-
proach, using annotations from the NRC VAD
Lexicon as training data.

Given a training word w and a large train-
ing corpus, we extract a contextual embedding
e for every instance of w in the corpus. We
use off-the-shelf pre-trained language models to
extract sentence-level embeddings with no addi-
tional fine-tuning. Then, we average over all e
embeddings for each instance w to obtain a sin-

Low High
timid resourceful
weakly powerfully

Power cowardly courageous
inferior superior

negative positive
pessimistic optimistic

Sentiment annoyed amused

disappointed pleased

meek lusty

Agency homely sexy
bored flustered
quietly frantically

gle feature vector for each training point. We then
train a Kernel Ridge Regression model using these
embeddings as features.1

To extract affect scores for an entity in a narra-
tive, we use the same pre-trained language model
to extract a contextual embedding for the entity.
Then, we feed this embedding through the regres-
sion model to obtain power, sentiment, and agency
scores. When an entity occurs multiple times in
the narrative, we average over the contextual em-
beddings for each occurrence of the entity and
score the averaged embedding.

2.2 Affect Subspace Projection (ASP)
The main disadvantage of the regression approach
is that we are unable to control for confounds and
prevent overfitting to the training data. For ex-
ample, many low-agency nouns tend to be inani-
mate objects (i.e. table), while high-agency nouns
are people-oriented words (i.e. dictator). Thus,
we can expect that the model learns to predict the
difference between classes of nouns, rather than
solely learning the affect dimension of interest.
While other variations of regression allow for the
inclusion of covariates and confounds, we have no
systematic way to quantify or even identify these
confounds. Instead, we devise a method to iso-
late dimensions of power, agency, and sentiment
by first identifying corresponding subspaces in the
embedding space and then projecting entities onto

Regression, but found that Kernel Ridge Regression per-
formed the best.

these dimensions. We refer to this method as affect
subspace projection (ASP).

We describe this process for obtaining power
scores; the agency and sentiment dimensions are
analogous. In order to isolate the power subspace,
we draw inspiration from (Bolukbasi et al., 2016).
First, we need to identify pairs of words whose
meanings differ only in that one word connotes
high power and the second word connotes low
power. We define a set H, which consists of the
|H| highest-powered words from the VAD lexi-
con and a set L, which consists of the |L| lowest
powered words from the VAD Lexicon. For ev-
ery word wh ∈ H, we use cosine similarity over
contextual embedding representations to identify
wl ∈ L, the low-powered word that is most sim-
ilar to wh. We allow each wl to match to at most
onewh. Thus, we identify pairs of words (wh, wl),
where wh and wl are very similar words but with
polar opposite power scores. Finally, we keep only
the N pairs with the greatest cosine similarity. We
tune hyperparameters |H|, |L|, and N over a val-
idation set. We show examples of extracted pairs
for each dimension in Table 1.

Next, we use these paired words to construct
a set of vectors whose direction of greatest vari-
ance is along the power subspace. For each pair
of high and low power words (wh, wl), we take
their embedding representations eh and el in the
same way as in the regression model. We then de-
fine µ = (eh + el)/2, and construct a matrix M,
where each row is el − µ or eh − µ. Thus, M is a
d×2N dimensional matrix, where d is the dimen-
sion of the embeddings. We then run PCA over M
to extract its principle components. For all 3 affect
dimensions, the first principle component captures
the highest percentage of variance (Appendix A),
followed by a sharp drop off. Thus, we keep the
first principle component as the target subspace.

Finally, to score an entity in a narrative, we take
the entity’s contextual embedding representation
and project it onto the identified subspace. Be-
cause we keep only the first principle component
as the target subspace, the projection results in a
single-dimensional vector, i.e., a power score. We
repeat the process for agency and sentiment, con-
structing 3 separate M matrices in order to obtain
power, sentiment, and agency scores.

3 Experimental Setup

The NRC VAD Lexicon contains valence (senti-
ment), arousal (agency), and dominance (power)
annotations for more than 20,000 English words.
It was created through manual annotations using
Best–Worst scaling. The final annotations are on
a scale from 0 (i.e. lower power) to 1 (i.e. high
power) (Mohammad, 2018). We randomly divide
the lexicon into training (16,007), dev (2,000), and
test (2,000) sets.

We extract embeddings to train our models from
a corpus of 42,306 Wikipedia movie plot sum-
maries (Bamman et al., 2013).2 We use two pre-
trained language models to extract embeddings:
ELMo (Peters et al., 2018) and BERT (Devlin
et al., 2019). It is important to note that the
movie plots corpus we used for extraction is dis-
tinct from the corpora used to train ELMo (5.5B
tokens from Wikipedia and WMT news crawl) and
BERT (800M-word BooksCorpus and 2,500M-
word Wikipedia).

We use two variants of BERT to extract embed-
dings. In the first, referred to as “BERT-masked”,
we mask out the target word before extracting em-
beddings from an input sentence. Masking out tar-
get words is a part of the BERT training objective
(Devlin et al., 2019). By using masks in our em-
bedding extractions, we force the model to pro-
duce an embedding solely from the context sur-
rounding the word, rather than relying on informa-
tion from the word itself. In the second variant, re-
ferred to as “BERT”, we extract embeddings over
each sentence containing a target without modifi-
cation. We report further details including hyper-
paramter settings in Appendix B.

4 Results and Analysis

4.1 Lexicon Correlations

Table 2 shows the Pearson correlations between
gold annotations and the scores predicted by our
models over the held-out VAD test set. The high
correlations demonstrate that both the regression
and ASP models successfully capture information
about power, sentiment, and agency from contex-
tualized embeddings. The ELMo embeddings and
unmasked BERT embeddings perform approxi-
mately the same. However, the masked BERT

as newspaper articles, we found the choice of training corpus

embeddings perform markedly worse than the un-
masked embeddings.3 The poorer performance of
the masked embeddings demonstrates the extent
to which the BERT model biases representations
towards the actual observed word, which is ex-
plicitly one of the motivations of the BERT train-
ing objective (Devlin et al., 2019). More specif-
ically, when we mask out the target before ex-
tracting embeddings, we force the extracted em-
bedding to only encode information from the sur-
rounding context. Then any improvements in per-
formance when we do not mask out the target are
presumably obtained from the word-form for the
target itself. For example, we may score “king” as
high-powered because “king” often occurred as a
high-powered entity in the data used to train the
BERT model, regardless of whether or not it ap-
peared to be high-powered in the corpus we ul-
timately extract embeddings from. Nevertheless,
training with BERT-masked embeddings still re-
sults in statistically significant correlations, which
suggests that some affect information is derived
from surrounding context.

The regression model generally outperforms
ASP on this task. The regression model has an ad-
vantage over ASP in that it is directly trained over

3One of the drawbacks of context-based word embed-
dings is that antonyms like “positive” and “negative” tend
to have similar embeddings, because they tend to be used in
similar contexts. However, given the breadth of words in the
VAD lexicon, we do expect context to differ for oppositely
scored words. For instance we would expect “pauper” and
“king” to be used in different contexts, as well as “pauper”
and “powerful”.

the full lexicon, whereas ASP chooses a subset of
extreme words to guide the model. However, as
discussed in §2, it is difficult to determine what ef-
fect other confounds have on the regression model,
while the ASP approach provides more concrete
evidence that these contextualized word embed-
dings encode affect information.

4.2 Quantitative Analysis of Entity Scores

Next, we evaluate how well our models capture
affect information in entities, rather than words,
by assessing power scores through two metrics.
We compare our models against the entity-scoring
metric proposed by Field et al. (2019) and against
a frequency baseline, where we consider an en-
tity’s power score to be the number of times the
entity is mentioned in the text.

First, we consider an in-domain task, where we
compare our metrics for scoring power with a stan-
dard benchmark that we expect to be reflected in
both the data we use to extract embeddings and the
data used to train ELMo and BERT. More specif-
ically, we use the power scores obtained from our
model to rank the 20 most powerful people in 2016
according to Forbes Magazine.4

This is a particularly difficult task: unlike prior
work, which seeks to identify the most power-
ful people in a corpus (Field et al., 2019), we
seek to rank these people according to their power,
which requires more precise scores. Furthermore,
the frequency metric supplies a particularly strong
baseline. The metrics that Forbes Magazine uses
to compose the list of powerful people include a
person’s influence as well as how actively they

use their power.5 Under these conditions, Forbes
Magazine may consider a person to be powerful
simply because they are mentioned frequently in
the media. Additionally, we can surmise that peo-
ple who actively use their power are mentioned
frequently in the media.

Table 3 presents Spearman correlations between
our scores and rank on the Forbes list for each
model. For all metrics, we construct embeddings
from every instance of each person’s full name in
U.S. articles from 2016 in the NOW news corpus.6

In addition to the proposed methods, we
used our best performing model (regression with
ELMo) to augment the frequency baseline, by nor-
malizing and summing the frequency scores with
the scores from this model. This combined model
achieves the strongest correlation (raw scores from
this model are shown in Figure 5). Furthermore,
the regression with ELMo model alone achieves
a statistically significant correlation even without
the incorporation of frequency scores. The un-
masked BERT embeddings also achieve positively
correlated scores, though these correlations are not
statistically significant. The BERT-masked em-
beddings perform particularly poorly, as does the
method for scoring power proposed in Field et al.
(2019). While Field et al. (2019) may be capable
of identifying powerful entities, we suspect it is
not fine-grained enough to rank them.

While frequency serves as a strong baseline for
power, we would not expect frequency to be a
good measure of sentiment or agency. None of
our metrics for these traits are significantly cor-
related with the Forbes’ ranking. Also, we would
not expect frequency to be a good measure in other
contexts, such as how powerfully an entity is por-
trayed in a single document rather than across a
large media corpus.

Next, we further explore performance on an out-
of-domain task: specifically how powerfully enti-
ties are portrayed in a specific set of articles, which
we do not expect to align with portrayals in the
data used to train ELMo and BERT.

For this task, we use the same evaluation met-
rics as Field et al. (2019); we compare our scores
with hand-annotated power rankings over a set of
newspaper articles related to a specific event in
the #MeToo movement, namely allegations of sex-
ual harassment against the comedian Aziz Ansari.

Table 4: Accuracy for scoring how powerful entities
are as compared with annotations over articles related
to the #MeToo movement. Our metrics do not consis-
tently outperform the baselines, suggesting ELMo and
BERT embeddings fail to transfer across domains.

Following Field et al. (2019), we interpret the
hand-annotations, in which human annotators rank
entities according to how powerful they seem, as a
pairwise task (is entity A more powerful than en-
tity B?) and compute accuracy over pairs of en-
tities. We discard annotations where annotators
strongly disagreed about the power of the entity
(i.e. annotations differ by more than 2 ranks).

Field et al. (2019) compare results with off-the-
shelf connotation frame lexicons, which restricts
analysis to a limited set of pairs, since only enti-
ties used with verbs from the lexicon are included.
In contrast, we simply use string matching to iden-
tify entities in the text, without requiring that the
entities be linked to specific verbs, allowing for the
identification of more entities.

Table 4 shows results over the same set of pairs
used for evaluation in Field et al. (2019) as well as
an expanded set, when we do not restrict to entities
used with lexicon verbs. Our metrics fail to con-
sistently outperform even the frequency baseline
for this task, likely because the ELMo and BERT
embeddings are biased towards their training data.

The #MeToo movement is widely known for
subverting traditional power roles: allegations
made by traditionally unpowerful women have
brought down traditionally powerful men. For ex-
ample, Harvey Weinstein, an influential film pro-
ducer, has traditionally been a powerful figure in
society, but numerous allegations of sexual harass-

ment have resulted in his effective removal from
the industry. While articles about the #MeToo
movement portray men like Weinstein as unpow-
erful, we can speculate that the corpora used to
train ELMo and BERT portray them as powerful.

Thus, in a corpus where traditional power roles
have been inverted, the embeddings extracted
from ELMo and BERT perform worse than ran-
dom, as they are biased towards the power struc-
tures in the data they are trained on. Further ev-
idence of this exists in the performance of the
BERT-masked embeddings - whereas these em-
beddings generally capture power poorly as com-
pared to the unmasked embeddings (Table 2),
they outperform the unmasked embeddings on this
task, and even outperform the frequency baseline
in one setting. Nevertheless, they do not outper-
form Field et al. (2019), likely because they do not
capture affect information as well as the unmasked
embeddings (Table 2).

4.3 Qualitative Document-level Analysis

Finally, we qualitatively analyze how well our
method captures affect dimensions by analyzing
single documents in detail. We conduct this anal-
ysis in a domain where we expect entities to fulfill
traditional power roles and where entity portray-
als are known. Following Bamman et al. (2013),
we analyze the Wikipedia plot summary of the
movie The Dark Knight,7 focusing on Batman
(protagonist),8 the Joker (antagonist), Jim Gordan
(law enforcement officer, ally to Batman), Har-

vey Dent (ally to Batman who turns evil) and
Rachel Dawes (primary love interest). To facil-
itate extracting example sentences, we score each
instance of these entities in the narrative separately
and average across instances to obtain an entity
score for the document.9 To maximize our data
by capturing every mention of an entity, we per-
form co-reference resolution by hand. Addition-
ally, based on our results from Table 3 as well as
the use of Wikipedia data in training the ELMo
model (Peters et al., 2018), we use ELMo embed-
dings for our analysis.

Figures 1 and 2 show results. For refer-
ence, we show the entity scores as compared to
one polar opposite pair identified by ASP. Both
the regression model and ASP show similar pat-
terns. Batman has high power, while Rachel has
low power. Additionally, the Joker is associated
with the most negative sentiment, but the high-
est agency. Throughout the plot summary, the
movie progresses by the Joker taking an aggres-
sive action and the other characters responding.
We can see this dynamic reflected in the Joker’s
profile score, as a high-powered, high-agency,
low-sentiment character, who is the primary plot-
driver. In general, ASP shows a greater separation
between characters than the regression model. We
hypothesize that this occurs because ASP isolates
the dimensions of interest, while the regression ap-
proach captures other confounds, such as that hu-

9When we used this averaging metric in other evaluations,
we found no significant change in results. Thus, in other sce-
narios, we compute scores over averaged embeddings, rather
than averaging scores separately computed for each embed-
ding to reduce computationally complexity.

mans tend to be high agency entities.
Furthermore, because we score each instance

separately, we can pinpoint particularly represen-
tative sentences. The sentence indicating the most
positive sentiment for Batman is also the sentence
that indicates the lowest sentiment for the Joker:
“Both the civilians and the prisoners refuse to kill
each other, while Batman apprehends the Joker af-
ter a brief fight.”

An example sentence where the Joker is scored
with particularly high power is: “After announc-
ing that Gotham City will be subject to his rule by
nightfall, the Joker rigs two evacuating ferries with
explosives.” In contrast, a moment where Rachel
is portrayed as particularly low-powered is: “Both
buildings explode, killing Rachel and disfiguring
half of Dent’s face.”

One of the advantages of the persona model
in Bamman et al. (2013) is the ability to clus-
ter characters across stories, identifying roles like
hero and villain more generally. We can simi-
larly use our model to analyze characters across
story lines. We show results using the regression
model; the ASP results (omitted) reveal the same
patterns. In Figure 3, we compare characters from
the plot summary of Raiders of the Lost Ark to
the characters of The Dark Night, specifically Indi-
ana Jones (protagonist), Rene Belloq (antagonist)
and Marion Ravenwood (love interest).10 We can
see a clear separation between the female love in-
terests and the male protagonists and antagonists,
thus identifying similar roles in the same way as

10http://bit.ly/30ZMhhj

a persona model. However, whereas the output
of a persona model is distributions over personas
and vocabulary, our system outputs scores along
known dimensions of power, agency, and senti-
ment, which are easy to interpret and visualize.
Furthermore, our approach is meaningful at the
level of an individual document or sentence.

The affect scores in Indiana Jones reveal some
of the limitations of our approach. Figure 4 shows
the sentiment scores for these characters. While
Indiana Jones and Marion have similar sentiment
scores, Belloq is portrayed surprisingly positively.
In reading the plot summary, Belloq’s role in the
narrative is often not obvious through immediate
context. While the Joker “burns” and “rigs explo-
sives”, Belloq “arrives” and “performs a ceremo-
nial opening”. The reader understands Belloq’s
role in the story through context in the broader
story line, rather than context immediately sur-
rounding mentions of Belloq. The sentence-level
embeddings produced by ELMo do not capture the
broader role of characters in narratives.

Finally, our model (as well as the persona
model) does not specifically account for perspec-
tive. For example, character deaths are often
scored as a negative portrayal. Death may be a
negative event, and often villains (i.e Belloq) die,
allowing us to capture their role as negative char-
acters. However, “good” characters also often die
in stories, and in these cases, the reader tends to
view the character positively (i.e. with sympathy).
Our approach does not explicitly control for per-
spective, separating how an event may be nega-
tive from the perspective of a character but gen-
erate positive sentiment from the reader. The in-
corporation of connotations frames (Rashkin et al.,
2016), in which annotations are along clearly de-
fined perspectives, may offer a way to improve our
approach.

5 Usage Example: Analysis of Gender
Bias in Media

In this section, we use our proposed methods to
analyze how men and women are portrayed in
the media, focusing on domains of interest in
prior NLP work (Wagner et al., 2015; Fu et al.,
2016). We use the NOW corpus and regression
with ELMo embeddings for analysis.12

First, we return to the example from §4.2, the
list of most powerful people from Forbes Maga-

12ASP results are nearly identical.

Figure 5: Power scores for people on the 2016 Forbes
Magazine power list as learned through regression with
ELMo embeddings, and through combined regression
and frequency scores. Women are generally scored
lower than similarly ranked men.11

zine in 2016. Figure 5 shows the power scores
ordered from least powerful to most powerful ac-
cording to the Forbes list. We show both the raw
power scores computed by our model, as well as
the regression power scores combined with fre-
quency metric (as in Table 3). In the raw scores,
stand-out powerful people include businessman
Warren Buffet and Pope Francis. In contrast, the
only 3 women, Theresa May, Janet Yellen, and
Angela Merkel, are underscored as compared to
similarly ranked men. However, when we incor-
porate frequency, we do not see the same under-
scoring. This result suggests that although these
women are portrayed frequently in the media, they
are typically described as less powerful than their
actual role in society.13 This finding is consistent
with prior work on portrayals of women (Wagner
et al., 2015). The most striking difference after the
incorporation of frequency scores is the boosted
power score for Donald Trump, who is mentioned
much more frequently than other entities.

In Figure 6, we show the sentiment and power
(combined regression + frequency) scores for the

Figure 6: Sentiment and power scores for the top-
ranked male (left) and female (right) tennis players
in 2016 through regression with ELMo embeddings
(power scores combine regression scores with fre-
quency counts). Women are generally portrayed with
lower power and higher sentiment.

top-ranked male and female tennis players in
2016. Prior work has shown bias in news cov-
erage of male and female tennis players, specifi-
cally, that male players are typically asked ques-
tions more focused on the game than female play-
ers (Fu et al., 2016). Our analysis focuses on
a different data set and coverage type—we ex-
amine general articles rather than post-match in-
terviews. As expected, popular players Serena
Williams and Andy Murray have the highest sen-
timent scores and very high power scores. In con-
trast, Novak Djokovic, who has notoriously been
less popular than his peers, has the lowest senti-
ment score, but the second highest power score
(after Williams). Additionally, female players are
typically portrayed with more positive sentiment
(female average score = 0.58; male average score
= 0.54), whereas male players are portrayed with
higher power (female average score = 0.52; male
average score = 0.57). However, the difference
in power disappears when we remove frequency
from the metric and use only the regression scores,
suggesting that the difference occurs because male
players are mentioned more frequently.

6 Related Work

The most similar prior work to ours uses contex-
tualized embeddings to map connotation frames
(verb annotations) into power, agency, and senti-
ment scores for entities (Field et al., 2019). In

contrast, our method scores entities directly, al-
lowing it to incorporate more information than just
verb features and eliminating the need for depen-
dency parsing. Furthermore, unlike the connota-
tion frame annotations (Rashkin et al., 2016; Sap
et al., 2017), the VAD lexicons used in this work
were specifically motivated by social psychology
literature on this topic, which influenced the an-
notation scheme (Mohammad, 2018). Our analy-
sis in §4.2 suggests that while Field et al. (2019)
works better for out-of-domain data, our proposed
methods are able to obtain finer-grained and more
accurate scores for in-domain data.

Prior to the proposed power, agency, and sen-
timent framework, initial approaches to person-
centric analyses used graphical models to iden-
tify personas in narratives (Bamman et al., 2013;
Card et al., 2016; Iyyer et al., 2016; Chaturvedi
et al., 2017), where personas are distributions over
nouns, adjectives and verbs. These models allow
for identifying roles in stories, such as Batman and
Iron Man are both characters who “shoot”, “aim”,
and “overpower”. While this approach is use-
ful for processing unstructured texts, personas are
limited to distributions over a discrete vocabulary,
and rely only on nouns, adjectives and verbs modi-
fiers. In contrast, contextualized word embeddings
have the power to capture all context in a sen-
tence and provide more nuanced representations,
especially considering non-contextualized embed-
dings have been shown to reflect biases in society
(Garg et al., 2018). Furthermore, persona models
can be difficult to interpret, whereas our analysis
is grounded in concrete affect dimensions.

Other approaches that broadly address how peo-
ple are portrayed use domain-specific features to
target particular hypotheses. Fast et al. (2016) an-
alyze characters in fiction through crowd-sourced
lexicons that target gender stereotypes. While use-
ful for identifying bias, this method is limited to
discrete modifiers and targeted lexicons do not
necessarily generalize to other domains. Wagner
et al. (2015) similarly use domain-specific knowl-
edge to analyze coverage of men and women on
Wikipedia, incorporating metadata like links be-
tween pages. Most affective NLP analyses of nar-
ratives focus on sentiment or specific stereotypes.
Studies of power have largely been limited to a di-
alog setting (e.g. Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al.
(2012), see Prabhakaran (2015) for an overview),
and almost no work has examined agency, with the

exception of connotation frames.
Several recent works have evaluated the useful-

ness of pre-trained contextualized word embed-
dings in existing NLP tasks as well as through new
benchmarks, designed to distill what type of infor-
mation these models encode (Tenney et al., 2019;
Goldberg, 2019; Liu et al., 2019). These investiga-
tions focus on syntactic tasks, with semantic eval-
uations primarily limited to semantic role label-
ing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
work to target affective dimensions in pre-trained
contextualized word embeddings. Our findings are
consistent with prior work suggesting that contex-
tualized embeddings capture biases from training
data (Zhao et al., 2019; Kurita et al., 2019) and
that these models perform best when trained on
in-domain data (Alsentzer et al., 2019).

7 Conclusions and Future Work

We propose a method for incorporating contextu-
alized word embeddings into entity-centric anal-
yses, which has direct applications to numerous
social science tasks. Our results are easy to inter-
pret and readily generalize to a variety of research
questions. However, we further expose several
limitations to this method, specifically that contex-
tualized word embeddings are biased towards rep-
resentations from their training data, which limits
their usefulness in new domains. While we ex-
plore masking target words as a possible solution
to this problem, we find that masking significantly
decreases performance. We leave alternative so-
lutions for future work, including training embed-
dings from scratch or fine-tuning on the target cor-
pus (however, these ideas are only feasible with a
large target corpus, and the need for fine-tuning re-
duces the usefulness of pre-trained embeddings).
Despite this limitation, we find that these models
are expressive enough to analyze entity portrayals
in in-domain data, allowing us to examine differ-
ent portrayals of men and women.

B Appendix

When using ELMo embeddings, we keep only the
middle (second) ELMo layer, due to our prelimi-
nary investigations as well as prior work suggest-
ing that this layer captures the most semantic in-
formation (Peters et al., 2018). When constructing
embeddings for multi-word entities we keep the
embedding for the first word.

The BERT model uses WordPiece embeddings
(Wu et al., 2016), which can result in subword-
level embeddings rather than word-level embed-
dings. In the case that a word is tokenized into sub-
words, we keep only the embedding for the first to-
ken in the word. We use the BERT Base Uncased
model, and we use mean pooling to combine the
12 embedding layers into a single embedding with
768 dimensions.

We train hyper-parameters over the dev set,
maximizing for Pearson correlation between the
gold VAD annotations and the scores predicted by
our models. We fix hyperparamters |L|, |H|, and
N as (400, 300, 200) for power, (900, 200, 100)
for sentiment, and (400, 300, 200) for agency. In
the regression model, we use an RBF kernel and
fix α = 0.6 and γ = 1. All embeddings are nor-
malized to unit length.
