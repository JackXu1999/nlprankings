Abstract

Every fiscal quarter, companies hold earnings
calls in which company executives respond
to questions from analysts. After these calls,
analysts often change their price target rec-
ommendations, which are used in equity re-
search reports to help investors make deci-
sions. In this paper, we examine analysts’ de-
cision making behavior as it pertains to the
language content of earnings calls. We iden-
tify a set of 20 pragmatic features of ana-
lysts’ questions which we correlate with ana-
lysts’ pre-call investor recommendations. We
also analyze the degree to which semantic and
pragmatic features from an earnings call com-
plement market data in predicting analysts’
post-call changes in price targets. Our re-
sults show that earnings calls are moderately
predictive of analysts’ decisions even though
these decisions are influenced by a number of
other factors including private communication
with company executives and market condi-
tions. A breakdown of model errors indicates
disparate performance on calls from different
market sectors.

1 Introduction

Financial analysts are key sell-side players in fi-
nance who are employed to analyze, interpret, and
disseminate financial information (Brown et al.,
2015). For the firms they cover, financial analysts
regularly release recommendations to buy, hold,
or sell the company’s stock, and stock price tar-
gets. Financial analysts’ forecasts are of value to
investors (Givoly and Lakonishok, 1980) and may
be better surrogates for market expectations than
forecasts generated by time-series models (Fried
and Givoly, 1982).

Analysts’ decisions are influenced by market
conditions and private communications1, so it is

1Brown et al. (2015) find over half of the 365 analysts

impossible to exactly reconstruct their decision
making process. However, signals of analysts’
decision making may be obtained by analyzing
earnings calls—quarterly live conference calls in
which company executives present prepared re-
marks (the presentation section) and then selected
financial analysts ask questions (the question-
answer section). Previous work has shown that
earnings calls disclose more information than
company filings alone (Frankel et al., 1999) and
influence investor sentiment in the short term
(Bowen et al., 2002). However, recently com-
pany executives and investors have questioned
their value (Koller and Darr, 2017; Melloy, 2018).

Earnings calls are extremely complex,
naturally-occurring examples of discourse
that are interesting to study from the perspective
of computational linguistics (see Figure 1). In this
work, we examine analysts’ decision making in
the context of earnings calls in two ways:

• Correlating analysts’ question pragmatics
with their pre-call judgements: With domain
experts, we select a set of 20 pragmatic and
discourse features which we extract from the
questions of earnings calls. Then we correlate
these with analysts’ pre-call judgments and find
bullish analysts tend to be called on earlier in
calls, and ask questions that are more positive,
more concrete, and less about the past (§4).
• Predicting changes in analysts’ post-call fore-

casts: We use the pragmatic features, along
with representations of the semantic content of
earnings calls, to predict changes in analysts’
post-call price targets. Since analysts have a
deep understanding of market factors influenc-
ing a company’s performance and have access
to private information, our null hypothesis is

they surveyed have five or more direct contacts per year with
the CEO or CFO of companies they follow.

Brian Nowak, Analyst: Thanks for taking my questions. One on YouTube, I guess. Could you just talk to some of
the qualitative drivers that are really bringing more advertising dollars on to YouTube? And then I think last quarter
you had mentioned the top 100 advertiser spending was up 60% year-on-year on YouTube, wondering, if you could
update us on that? And the second one on search, it sounds like mobile is accelerating. Where are you now in the
mobile versus desktop monetization gap? And, Sundar, how do you think about that long-term? Do you see mobile
being higher, reaching equilibrium? How do you see that trending?

Sundar Pichai, CEO: On the YouTube one. Look, I mean, the shift to video is a profound medium shift and
especially in the context of mobile, you know and obviously users are following that. You’re seeing it in YouTube as
well as elsewhere in mobile. And so, advertisers are being increasingly conscious. They’re being very, very responsive.
So, we’re seeing great traction there and we’ll continue to see that. They are moving more off their traditional budgets to
YouTube and that’s where we are getting traction. On mobile search, to me, increasingly we see we already announced
that over 50% of our searches are on mobile. Mobile gives us very unique opportunities in terms of better understanding
users and over time, as we use things like machine learning, I think we can make great strides. So, my long-term
view on this is, it is as-compelling or in fact even better than desktop, but it will take us time to get there. We’re going
to be focused till we get there.

Figure 1: Earnings calls are extremely complex examples of naturally-occurring discourse. In this example
question-answer pair from a Google earnings call on October 27, 2016, the analyst asks six distinct questions in a
single turn. Because the interaction originates as speech, there are discourse markers and hedging. The analyst
and executive discuss concrete entities and performance statistics and past, present and future performance.

that earnings calls are not predictive of forecast
changes. However, our best model gives a re-
duction of 25% in relative accuracy error over
a majority class baseline (twice the reduction
of a model using market data alone), suggest-
ing there is signal in the noise. We also conduct
pairwise comparisons of modeling features in-
cluding: semantic vs. pragmatic features, Q&A-
only vs. whole-call data, and whole-document
vs. turn-level models (§5).

2 Related work

NLP is used extensively for financial applications
(Tetlock et al., 2008; Kogan et al., 2009; Leid-
ner and Schilder, 2010; Loughran and McDon-
ald, 2011; Wang et al., 2013; Ding et al., 2014;
Peng and Jiang, 2016; Li and Shah, 2017; Rek-
absaz et al., 2017). Earnings calls, in particu-
lar, are shown to be predictive of investor sen-
timent in the short-term, including of increased
stock volatility and trading volume levels (Frankel
et al., 1999), decreased forecast error and forecast
dispersion (Bowen et al., 2002), and increased ab-
solute returns for intra-day trading (Cohen et al.,
2012). Although most prior work on earnings calls
treat each call as a single document, Matsumoto
et al. (2011) find that the question-answer portion
of the earnings call is more informative (in terms
of intra-day absolute returns) than the presenta-
tion portion, and Cohen et al. (2012) show firms
“cast” earnings calls by disproportionately calling
on bullish analysts.

Most prior applications of NLP to earnings calls
use only shallow linguistic features and correlation

analyses, specifically correlations between polit-
ical bigrams and stock return volatility (Hassan
et al., 2016); contrastive words and share prices
(Palmon et al., 2016); and euphemisms and earn-
ings surprise (Suslava, 2017). Other work an-
alyzes earnings calls from a sociolinguistic per-
spective, including in terms of discourse connec-
tives (Camiciottoli, 2010), indirect requests (Cam-
iciottoli, 2009), unanswered questions (Hollan-
der et al., 2010), persuasion (Crawford Camiciot-
toli, 2018) and deception (Larcker and Zakolyuk-
ina, 2011). Focusing on only the audio of earn-
ings calls, Mayew and Venkatachalam (2012) ex-
tract managers’ affective states using commercial
speech software. In the work most similar to ours,
Wang and Hua (2014) use named entities, part-of-
speech tags, and probabilistic frame-semantic fea-
tures in addition to unigrams and bigrams to corre-
late earnings calls with financial risk, which they
defined as the volatility of stock prices in the week
following the earnings call.

NLP-based corpus analyses of decision making
are rare. Beňuš et al. (2014) analyze the impact
of entrainment on Supreme Court justices’ sub-
sequent decisions. Multiple groups have exam-
ined the impact of various semantic and pragmatic
features on modeling opinion change using red-
dit ChangeMyView discussions (e.g. (Hidey et al.,
2017; Jo et al., 2018; Musi, 2018)), and there has
been other work on opinion change using other
web discussion data (e.g. (Tan et al., 2016; Haber-
nal and Gurevych, 2016; Lukin et al., 2017)). Be-
cause many factors influence decision making be-
havior, the fact that any signal can be obtained

tifacts is scientifically interesting.

3 Data and pre-processing

Our data2 consists of transcripts of 12,285 earn-
ings calls held between January 1, 2010 and De-
cember 31, 2017. In order to control for analyst
coverage effects (larger companies with a greater
market share will typically be covered by more an-
alysts), we include only calls from S&P 500 com-
panies. We split the data by year into training, val-
idation and testing sets (see Table 1).

The transcripts are XML files with metadata
specifying speaker turn boundaries and the name
of the speaker (or “Operator” for the call operator).
In order to identify speaker type (analyst or com-
pany representative) we use the following heuris-
tic: if the transcript explicitly includes the speaker
type with the speaker name (e.g. “John Doe, Ana-
lyst”), we do exact string matching for “, Analyst”;
else, we assume the names of speakers between
the first and second operator turns (i.e. in the pre-
sentation section) are those of company represen-
tatives and all other speakers are analysts. We
manually checked this heuristic on a few dozen
documents and found it to have high precision.

We remove turns spoken by the operator as
well as turns that have fewer than 10 tokens since
manual analysis revealed the latter were largely
acknowledgment and greeting turns (e.g. “Thank
you for your time” and “You’re welcome”). We
also lexicalized named entities and represented
them as a single token. We obtained tokenization,

part of speech tagging, and dependency parsing
via a proprietary NLP library3.

4 Pragmatic correlations with analysts’
pre-call judgments

We are interested in whether and how the forms of
analysts’ questions reflect their pre-call judgments
about companies they cover. Analysts’ questions
are complex: a single turn may contain several
questions (or answers). An example question-
answer pair is shown in Figure 1.

We compute Pearson correlations between lin-
guistic features indicating certainty, deception,
emotion and outlook (§4.1) and the type of analyst
(bullish, bearish, or neutral) asking the question.
We use a mapping of analysts’ recommendations
to a 1-5 scale4 where a 1 denotes “strong sell” and
a 5 denotes “strong buy.” We label each analyst ac-
cording to their recommendation of the company
before the earnings call:

• bearish if analysts give a company a 1 or 2,
• neutral if they give a 3, and
• bullish if they give a 4-5.

We have analyst recommendations for 160,816 to-
tal question turns and the distribution over analyst
labels is 4.5% bearish, 35.7% neutral, and 59.7%
bullish. Following other correlation work in NLP
(Preoţiuc-Pietro et al., 2015; Holgate et al., 2018),
we use Bonferroni correction to address the multi-
ple comparisons problem.

4.1 Pragmatic lexical features

We extract 20 pragmatic features from each turn
by gathering existing hand-crafted, linguistic lexi-
cons for these concepts5. See Table 2 for statistics
about the lexicons and Table 3 for examples.

Named entity counts and concreteness ratio.
For each turn, we calculate the number of named
entities in five coarse-grained groups constructed
from the fine-grained entity types of OntoNotes6

3Bloomberg’s libnlp
4Qualitative analyst rating labels vary from firm to firm.

For example, some firms use the standard “buy, hold, sell”
labels while others might use different labels such as “out-
perform, peer perform, underperform.” We use ratings from
a proprietary financial database that have been manually nor-
malized to 1-5 scale.

the sources of our lexicons.

Predicate-based temporal orientation. Tem-
poral orientation is the emphasis individuals place
on the past, present, or future. Previous work
has shown correlations between “future intent” ex-
tracted from query logs and financial market vol-
ume volatility (Hasanuzzaman et al., 2016). We
determine the temporal orientation of every pred-
icate in a turn. We extract OpenIE predicates
via a re-implementation of PredPatt (White et al.,
2016). For each predicate, we look at its Penn
Treebank part-of-speech tag and use a heuristic7

7If the part-of-speech tag for the predicate is VBD or
VBN the temporal orientation is “past”; otherwise if it is VB,
VBG, VBP, or VBZ it is “present” unless the predicate has
a dependent of the form will, ’ll, shall or wo indicating “fu-
ture”, are is, am, or are indicating “present”, or was or were
indicating “past”.

: We calculate the number of (7) “past” oriented
predicates, (8) “present” oriented predicates and
(9) “future” oriented predicates in each turn.

Sentiment. We calculate the ratio of (10) pos-
itive sentiment terms and (11) negative sentiment
terms to the number of tokens in each turn. We
use the financial sentiment lexicons developed
by Loughran and McDonald (2011) from four-
teen years of 10-Ks. We supplement these with
a general-purpose sentiment dictionary (Taboada
et al., 2011), to account for the relative informal-
ity of earnings calls.

Hedging. We calculate (12) the ratio of hedges
to tokens in each turn. Hedges are lexical choices
by which a speaker indicates a lack of commitment
to the content of their speech (Prince et al., 1982).
We use the single- and multi-word hedge lexicons
from (Prokofieva and Hirschberg, 2014).

4.2 Interpretation of correlation results.

Full results for the pragmatic correlation analysis
are given in Table 4. For a number of features the
correlations are not statistically significant. How-
ever, we expand upon the statistically significant
results for negative (−) and positive (+) correla-
tions with the bullishness of an analyst:

• (+) Bullishness and turn order. This suggests
bullish analysts tend to be called on earlier in
the call and bearish and neutral analysts tend to
be called on later in the call which confirms the
conclusion of Cohen et al. (2012).

• (+) Bullishness and positive sentiment. Bullish
analysts tend to ask more positive (less nega-
tive) questions and the reverse is true for neu-
tral/bearish analysts. Intuitively, this makes
sense since bullish analysts are more favorable

towards the firm and thus probably cast the firm
in a positive light.

• (+) Bullishness and entities. Here we find that
bullish analysts are slightly more concrete in
their questions towards the company and tend
to ask more about organizations and people.

• (−) Bullishness and past predicates. This sug-
gests bearish and neutral analysts tend to talk
about the past more.

These correlations could be used by journalists
and investors to flag questions that follow atypical
patterns for a particular analyst.

5 Predicting changes in analysts’
post-call forecasts

We are interested in what earnings-call related in-
formation is indicative of analysts’ subsequent de-
cisions to change (or not change) their price target
after an earnings call. A price target is a projected
future price level of asset; for example, an analyst
may give a stock that is currently trading at $50
a six-month price-target of $90 if they believe the
stock will perform better in the future.

We design experiments to answer the follow-
ing research questions: (1) Is the text of earnings
calls predictive of analysts’ changes in price tar-
gets from before to after the call? This is an open
research question since analysts may change their
price targets at any time and consider external in-
formation (e.g. current events or private conversa-
tions with company executives); (2) If the text is
predictive, is the text more predictive than market-
based features such as the company’s stock price,
volatility, and earnings? (3) If the text is predic-
tive, what linguistic aspects (e.g. pragmatic vs. se-
mantic) are more predictive and with which fea-
ture representations? (4) Is the question-answer
portion of the call more predictive than the presen-
tation portion? (5) Does a turn-based model of the
call provide more signal than “single document”
representations?

5.1 Representing analysts’ forecast changes
We model analysts’ changes in forecasts as both
a regression task and a 3-class classification task
because different formulations may be of interest
to various stakeholders8.

8For instance, investors may care more about small
changes in forecast price targets whereas journalists may care
more about relative changes (e.g. whether an earnings call
will move analysts’ price targets up or down).

Regression. For each earnings call in our cor-
pus, i ∈ D, and each analyst in the set of analysts
covering that call, j ∈ Ji, let bj be the price tar-
get of analyst j before the call and let aj be the
price target after the call9. Then the average per-
cent change in analysts’ price targets is

yi =
1

|Ji|
∑
j∈Ji

. (1)

See Figure 1 for the distribution of yi.
Since analysts can report price targets at any time,
we set cut-off points for aj and bj to be 3 months
before and 14 days after the earnings call date re-
spectively (a majority of analysts who change their
price targets do so within two weeks after a call).

Classification. We create three (roughly equal)
classes (negative, neutral, and positive change)
by binning the yi values calculated in the equa-
tion above into thirds. For each earnings call i,
ci = −1 if yi < −0.0167, ci = 0 if −0.0167 ≤
yi ≤ 0.0, and ci = 1 if 0 < yi. Table 5 shows the
class breakdown for each split of the data.

9Because the company holding the earnings call chooses
which analysts to call on for questions, our data includes an-
alyst ratings and recommendations from analysts who do not
ask a question in a call. Also, because individual analysts’
recommendations may be sold to different vendors, we do
not have analyst ratings and recommendations for all analysts
who ask questions in our data.

5.2 Features

We compare models with market-based, prag-
matic, and semantic features.

5.2.1 Market features

For each company and call in our dataset, we ob-
tain 10 market features for the trading day prior
to the call date: open price, high price, low price,
volume of shares, 30-day volatility, 10-day volatil-
ity, price/earnings ratio, relative price/earnings ra-
tio, EBIT yield, and earnings yield10. We impute
missing values for these features using the mean
value of features in the training data11. We scale
features to have zero mean and unit variance.

5.2.2 Semantic features

Doc2Vec. We use the paragraph vector algorithm
proposed by (Le and Mikolov, 2014) to obtain
300-dimensional document embeddings. Depend-
ing on the model, we train doc2vec embeddings
over whole calls, question-answer sections only,
and individual turns. Using the Gensim12 im-
plementation (Řehůřek and Sojka, 2010), we train
doc2vec models for 50 epochs and ignore words
that occur less than 10 times in the respective train-
ing corpus.

Bag-of-words. We lowercase tokens, augment
them with their parts of speech, and then limit the
vocabulary to the top 100K content words13 in the
training data. Depending on the model, we calcu-
late bag-of-words feature vectors over the whole
document, over the Q&A section, and over each
turn separately.

5.2.3 Pragmatic features

We combine the 20 pragmatic features described
in Section 4.1 into a single feature vector. These
features are only used in our turn-level models.

5.3 Models

We use several models to predict changes in ana-
lysts’ forecasts.

10See Appendix B in supplemental material for detailed
definitions of these finance terms.

11There are missing values for less than 1% of the data.
The missing values are mainly due to company acquisitions
and changing of company names.

Table 6: Test-set regression and classification results. Models are ridge regression (RR), long short-term memory
networks (LSTM), logistic regression (LR), and ensemble (Ens.). WD denotes whole-document models, while
Q&A denotes Q&A-only models. Evaluation metrics are mean squared error (MSE), the coefficient of determina-
tion (R2), accuracy (Acc.), and macro-level F1. For regression, percent error reduction (% err.) is from the MSE
of the baseline of predicting the training mean; for classification, it is from the accuracy of predicting the majority
class.

5.3.1 Whole-document models

Ridge regression14. For regression, we use ridge
regression15 which has a loss function that is the
linear least squares function and is regularized
with an L2-norm. To tune hyperparameters, we
perform a five-fold cross-validation grid search
over the regularization strength16. We evaluate on
mean squared error (MSE) and the coefficient of
determination (R2) scores.

Logistic regression17. For classification, we
train logistic regression with a L2 penalty18 and
we tune C, the inverse regularization constant, via
a grid search and 5-fold cross validation on the
training set. We evaluate validation and test sets
using accuracy and macro F1 scores.

5.3.2 Q&A-only models

In order to compare the relative influence of the
presentation versus question-answer sections of
the earnings calls, we remove the presentation por-
tion of each call and only predict on the Q&A por-

14We also tried Kernel ridge regression with a Gaussian
(RBF) kernel, which gave similar results. See Appendix C
for more details.

tion19. Except for this difference, Q&A-only mod-
els are identical to whole-document models.

5.3.3 Turn-by-turn models
LSTM for regression. We model transcripts as a
sequence of turns using long-short term memory
networks (LSTMs) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber,
1997). Let xt ∈ Rk be the input vector at time
t for embedding dimension k, and let L be the
total length of the sequence. Each xt is fed into
the LSTM in order and produces a corresponding
output vector ht. Then the final output vector is
passed through a linear layer y = wyhL + by for
output y ∈ R with wy ∈ Rk. For a given mini-
batch b, Lb is fixed as the maximum number of
turns among all documents and the sequences for
the other documents in the mini-batch are padded.
The network is trained with mean squared error
(MSE) loss.

LSTM for classification. The LSTM architec-
ture for classification is similar to that used for re-
gression except that there is an additional softmax
layer after the final linear layer. This network is
trained with cross-entropy loss.

Both LSTMs are trained via a grid search over
the following hyperparameters: learning rate, hid-

19Of the 12,285 documents, there were 246 that only con-
tained the presentation section and did not have the question-
and-answer section. In the Q&A modeling we completely
remove these documents.

den dimension, batch size, number of layers, and
L2-penalty (a.k.a. weight decay). The networks
are written in Pytorch20 and optimized with Adam
(Kingma and Ba, 2014) .

5.3.4 Fusion and ensembling
Early fusion. We use early fusion (Atrey et al.,
2010) to combine semantic and pragmatic feature
vectors at every turn and feed these into a LSTM.

Ensembling via stacking. We use “stacked
generalization” (Wolpert, 1992) (a.k.a. “stacking”)
to combine fusion and market-based models. For
regression, we take the output values from the
fusion and market-based models as features into
a ridge regression model. For classification, we
take the three-dimensional probability vector out-
put from the fusion and market-based models and
concatenate these as features into a logistic regres-
sion model. In both cases, hyperparameters are
tuned on validation data.

5.3.5 Baselines.
We compare against several baselines: (1) ran-
dom, drawing a random variable from a Gaussian
centered at the mean of the training data, (2) pre-
dicting the mean change in forecast across all doc-
uments in the training set (regression), and (3) pre-
dicting 0, the majority class (classification).

5.4 Results.
See Table 6 for full results. We address our origi-
nal research questions from the beginning of §5.

(1) Predictiveness. We find earnings calls are
moderately predictive of changes in analysts’ fore-
casts, with an almost 25% relative error reduction

20https://pytorch.org/

in classification accuracy from the baseline of pre-
dicting the majority class. While the accuracy of
our best model may seem modest, for this task, an-
alysts’ decisions can be influenced by many exter-
nal factors outside of the text itself and our ability
to find any signal among the noise may be inter-
esting to financial experts.

(2) Text vs. market. Semantic features are
more predictive of changes in analysts’ price tar-
gets than market features (a 24.8% error reduction
over baseline for bag-of-words and a 23.8% reduc-
tion for doc2vec, vs. a 12.4% error reduction for
market features).

(3) Semantic vs. pragmatic. Semantic features
(doc2vec and bag-of-words) are more predictive
than pragmatic features. This suggests the seman-
tic content of the earnings call is important in how
analysts make decisions to change their price tar-
gets.

(4) Q&A-only vs. whole-doc. Contrary to Mat-
sumoto et al. (2011) who find the question-answer
portions of earnings calls to be most informative,
we find the Q&A-only models are much less pre-
dictive for doc2vec (accuracy 0.479 vs. 0.385) and
bag-of-words (accuracy 0.482 vs. 0.388) models.

(5) Whole-doc vs turn-level. Whole-document
models are more predictive than turn-level mod-
els (the best LSTM model achieves 19.1% error
reduction over baseline, vs. 24.8% for the best
whole-doc model). We hypothesize that turn-level
models might capture more signal if they incorpo-
rate speaker metadata, e.g. the role of the speaker
or the analysts’ pre-calls judgment for the com-
pany. Although whole-document models are more
predictive, turn-level analyses of analysts’ behav-
ior may be more useful to alerting stakeholders to
predictive signals in real-time (e.g. an important
analyst analyst question mid-way through a live
earnings call) since financial markets can vary sig-
nificantly in short time periods.

Breakdown of results by industry. We ana-
lyze errors on the validation data by segmenting
earnings calls by each company’s Global Industry
Classification Standard (GICS) sector21. See Fig-
ure 2 for the breakdown results. Notably, the bag-
of-words model performs almost 2.5 times worse
on earnings calls from the Materials sector versus
the Utilities and Telecommunication Services sec-
tors. This suggests industry-specific models may

broad industry sectors.

be important in future work.

6 Conclusions and future work

In this work we (a) correlate pragmatic features of
analysts’ questions with the pre-call judgment of
the questioner, (b) explore the influence of mar-
ket, semantic and pragmatic features of earnings
calls on analysts’ subsequent decisions. We show
that bullish analysts are more likely to ask slightly
more positive and concrete questions, talk less
about the past, and be called on earlier in a call.
We also demonstrate earnings calls are moderately
predictive of changes in analysts’ forecasts.

Promising directions for future research include
examining additional features and feature repre-
sentations: pragmatic features such as formal-
ity (Pavlick and Tetreault, 2016) or politeness
(Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2013); acoustic-
prosodic features from earnings call audio; more
sophisticated semantic representations such as
claims (Lim et al., 2016), automatically induced
entity-relation graphs (Bansal et al., 2017) or
question-answer motifs (Zhang et al., 2017) (these
representations are non-trivial to construct be-
cause a single turn may contain many questions
or answers); or even discourse structures. The
models used in this work aim to be just complex
enough to determine whether useful signals exist
for this task; future modeling work could include
training a complete end-to-end system such as a
hierarchical attention network (Yang et al., 2016),
or building industry-specific models.
