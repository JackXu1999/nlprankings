Abstract

This paper describes the system used
in Task-7 (Analysis of Clinical Text) of
SemEval-2014 for detecting disorder men-
tions and associating them with their re-
lated CUI of UMLS1. For Task-A, a CRF
based sequencing algorithm was used to
find different medical entities and a binary
SVM classifier was used to find relation-
ship between entities. For Task-B, a dic-
tionary look-up algorithm on a customized
UMLS-2012 dictionary was used to find
relative CUI for a given disorder mention.
The system achieved F-score of 0.714 for
Task A & accuracy of 0.599 for Task B
when trained only on training data set, and
it achieved F-score of 0.755 for Task A &
accuracy of 0.646 for Task B when trained
on both training as well as development
data set. Our system was placed 3rd for
both task A and B.

1 Introduction

A clinical document contains plethora of informa-
tion regarding patient’s medical condition in un-
structured format. So a sophisticated NLP sys-
tem built specifically for clinical domain can be
very useful in many different clinical applications.
In recent years, clinical NLP has gained a lot
of significance in research community because it
contains challenging tasks such as medical entity
recognition, abbreviation disambiguation, inter-
conceptual relationship detection, anaphora res-
olution, and text summarization. Clinical NLP
has also gained a significant attraction among the

health care industry because it promises to de-
liver applications like computer assisted coding,
automated data abstraction, core/quality measure
monitoring, fraud detection, revenue loss preven-
tion system, clinical document improvement sys-
tem and so on.

Task-7 of SemEval-2014 was in continuation
of the 2013 ShaRe/CLEF Task-1 (Sameer Prad-
han, et al., 2013). This task was about finding
disorder mentions from the clinical text and as-
sociating them with their related CUIs (concept
unique identifiers) as given in the UMLS (Unified
Medical Language System). UMLS is the largest
available medical knowledge resource. It contains
2,885,877 different CUIs having 6,497,937 differ-
ent medical terms from over 100 different medi-
cal vocabularies. Finding accurate CUIs from free
clinical text can be very helpful in many healthcare
applications. Our aim for participating in this task
was to explore new techniques of finding CUIs
from clinical document.

Over the last few years many different Clin-
ical NLP systems like cTAKES (Savova, Guer-
gana K., et al., 2010), MetaMap (A. Aronson,
2001), MedLEE (C. Friedman et al., 1994) have
been developed to extract medical concepts from
a clinical document. Most of these systems focus
on rule based, medical knowledge driven dictio-
nary look-up approaches. In very recent past, a
few attempts have been made to use supervised or
semi-supervised learning models. In 2009, Yefang
Wang (Wang et al., 2009) used cascading clas-
sifiers on manually annotated data which fetched
F-score of 0.832. In 2010, i2b2 shared task chal-
lenge focused on finding test, treatment and prob-
lem mentions from clinical document.

In 2013, ShARe/CLEF task focused on finding
disorder mentions from clinical document and as-
signing relevant CUI code to it. In both i2b2 task
and ShaRe/CLEF task most of the systems used
either supervised or semi-supervised learning ap-

proaches.
In this paper we have proposed a hybrid super-

vised learning approach based on CRF and SVM
to find out disorder mentions from clinical doc-
uments and a dictionary look-up approach on a
customized UMLS meta-thesaurus to find corre-
sponding CUI.

2 Data

The SemEval-2014 corpus comprises of de-
identified plain text from MIMIC2 version 2.5
database. A disorder mention was defined as any
span of text which can be mapped to a concept
in UMLS and which belongs to the Disorder se-
mantic group. There were 431 notes extracted
from intensive care unit having various clinical
report types (like radiology, discharge summary,
echocardiogram and ECG), out of which 99 notes
were used in development data set, 199 notes were
used in training data set and 133 notes were used
in testing data set.

Preliminary analysis on this data showed that
number of sentences in training documents were
comparatively smaller than the development or
test data set (Table 1). Number of disorder men-
tions were also significantly lower in training data
set than in development data set (Table 1).

3 System Design

Analysis of Task-A showed that disorder men-
tions also contain other UMLS semantic types like
findings, anatomical sites and modifiers (Table 2).
So we divided the task of finding disorder men-
tion in to two subtasks. First a CRF based se-
quencing model was used to find different disorder
mentions, modifiers, anatomical sites and findings.

releases/70-version-25.html

Then a binary SVM classifier was used to check
if relationship exists between a disorder and other
types of entities or not.

Table 2: Entity Types co-relation and examples

For Task-B, we have used a simple dictionary
look up algorithm on a customized UMLS dictio-
nary. A preliminary analysis of UMLS entities in
general show that a single disorder mention may
consist of various types of linguistic phrases. It is
not necesarry that the system to detect these enti-
ties as a single phrase. The entities and their re-
lations may also occur in disjoint phrases as well.
Our analysis of the disorder entities inside UMLS
reveals that out of a total 278,859 disorders (based
on SNOMED-CT library), 96,069 are such that
can be broken down into more than one phrase,
which is roughly 1/3 of total number of disorders
in the UMLS.

3.1 System Workflow

The Work-flow of the system is as follow:

279



Figure 1: System Workflow

3.1.1 Pre-processing

All the clinical documents used in this task
were de-identified. So information related to
hospital name, patient demographics, physician
names/signatures, dates, places, and certain lab-
data were converted into predefined patterns.
These patterns were hindering the flow of natu-
ral language. As a result of it, we were unable to
get accurate results for PoS tagging and chunking
of the sentences. So we replaced all of these de-
identified patterns with some text that appear more
as natural language. There were also some head-
ers and footers associated with all the documents,
which were actually irrelevant to this task. There-
fore all headers and footers were also removed at
the pre-processing level.

3.1.2 openNLP
We have used openNLP3 to perform basic NLP
tasks like sentence detection, tokenizing, PoS tag-
ging, chunking, parsing and stemming.

3.1.3 Dictionary Lookup
UMLS 2012AA dictionary with Lexical Variant
Generator (LVG)4 was used to perform dictionary
lookup task. Even though the task was only about
finding disorder mentions, we also identified en-
tities like procedures, finding, lab data, medicine,
anatomical site and medical devices to be used as
features in our CRF model. This was helpful in
decreasing the number of false positive. UMLS
TUI (Type Unique Identifier) used for different
entity type is described in Table 3. A rule-based
approach on the output of the OpenNLP syntac-
tic parser was used to detect possible modifiers for
disorder mentions.

3.1.4 CRF Feature Generation
The feature sets were divided into three categories.
1) Clinical Features

i) Section Headers: A clinical note is often di-
vided into relevant segments called Section Head-
ers. These section headers provide very useful
information at the discourse level. Same section
header can have multiple variants. For example
History of Present Illness can also be written as
HPI, HPIS, Brief History etc. We have created a
dictionary of more than 550 different section head-
ers and classified them into more than 40 hierar-
chical categories. But using only section header
dictionary for classification can fetch many false

280



positives. Section header always appears in a pre-
defined similar sequences. So to remove these
false positives, we have used a Hidden Markov
Model(HMM) (Parth Pathak, et al, 2013). For this
task, we have used unigram section header id as a
feature for all the tokens in CRF.

ii) Dictionary Lookup: A binary feature was
used for all the different entity types detected from
UMLS dictionary from last pipeline.

iii) Abbreviations: Abbreviations Disambigua-
tion is one of the most challenging tasks in clinical
NLP. The primary reason for the same is a lack of
dictionary which contains most of the valid list of
abbreviations. For this task, we have used LRABR
as base dictionary to find out all the possible ab-
breviations and on top of that, a binary SVM clas-
sifier was used to check if the given abbreviation
has medical sense or not.
2) Textual Feature:

Snowball stemmer5 was used to find out stem
value of all the word tokens. Prefix and suffix of
length 2 to 5 were also used as features. Different
orthographic features like whole word capital, first
char capital, numeric values, dates, words contain-
ing hyphen or slash, medical units (mg/gram/ltr
etc.) were used as features.
3) Syntactic Features:

Different linguistic features like PoS tags and
chunks for each token were used. We have also
used head of the noun phrase as one of the feature
which can be very helpful in detecting the type of
an entity.

3.1.5 CRF toolkit
All the annotated data was converted into BIO
sequencing format. CRF++6 toolkit was used to
train and predict the model.

3.1.6 SVM
SVM was used to check whether a relationship ex-
ists between two entities or not. For this purpose
all the tokens between these two entities, their part
of speech tags and chunks were used as features.
Rules based on output of a syntactic parser were
also used as a binary feature. Some orthographic
features like all letter capital, contains colon (:),
contains semi colon (;), were also used as features.
LibSVM7 was used to train as well as predict the

model.

3.1.7 Dictionary Look-up for CUI detection
For a better mapping of the entities detected by
NLP inside the given input text, we found it to
be a better approach to divide the UMLS enti-
ties into various phrases. This was done semi-
automatically by splitting the strings based on
function words such as prepositions, particles and
non-nominal word classes such as verbs, adjec-
tives and adverbs. While most of the disorder enti-
ties in UMLS can be contained into a single noun
phrase (NP) there are also quite a few that contain
multiple NPs related with prepositional phrases
(PPs), verb phrases (VPs) and adjectival phrases
(ADJPs).

This task gave us a modified version of the
UMLS disorder entities along with their CUIs.
The following table (Table 4) gives a snapshot
of what this customized UMLS dictionary looked
like.

4 Results & Error Analysis

4.1 Evaluation Calculations
The evaluation measures for Task A are Precision,
Recall and F-Meas, defined as:

Precision = TPFP+TP

Recall = TPTP+FN

281



F-measure = 2∗Precision∗RecallPrecision+Recall

where
TP = Disorder mention span matches with gold
standard
FP = Disorder mention span detected by the
system was not present in the gold standard;
FN = Disorder mention span was present in the
gold standard but system was not able detect it

In Task B, the Accuracy was defined as the
number of pre-annotated spans with correctly
generated code divided by the total number of
pre-annotated spans.

Strict Accuracy = Total correct CUIsTotal annotation in gold standard

Relaxed Accuracy = Total correct CUIsTotal span detected by system

4.2 System Accuracy
The system results were calculated on two dif-
ferent runs. For the first evaluation, only training
data was used for the training purpose while for
the second evaluation, both the training as well as
the development data sets were used for training
purpose. The results for Task A and B are as
follows:

Precision Recall F-Meas
Strict
(T)

0.750 0.682 0.714

Relaxed
(T)

0.915 0.827 0.869

0.770 0.740 0.755

Relaxed
(T+D)

0.911 0.887 0.899

where T= Training Data set
D= Development Data set

4.3 Error Analysis
Error Analysis on training data revealed that for
Task-A our system got poor results in detecting
non-contiguous disjoint entities. Our system also
performed very poorly in identifying abbrevia-
tions and misspelled entities. We also observed

that the accuracy of the part of speech tagger and
the chunker also contributes a lot towards the final
outcome. For Task-B, we got many false positives.
Many CUIs which we identified from the UMLS
were not actually annotated.

5 Conclusion

In this paper we have proposed a CRF and SVM
based hybrid approach to find Disorder mentions
from a given clinical text and a novel dictio-
nary look-up approach for discovering CUIs from
UMLS meta-thesaurus. Our system did produce
competitive results and was third best among the
participants of this task. In future, we would like
to explore semi-supervised learning approaches to
take advantage of large amount of available un-
annotated free clinical text.
