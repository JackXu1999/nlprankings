ABSTRACT 

Written documents contain information in a language specific syntax form. Computational 

processing of such information demands representation in a structured form suitable for handling, 

processing, and analyzing. Such structured representation of documents enables extraction of 

knowledge through computational means. Once the textual data are represented in structured 

form, logical representation also becomes easier. This paper discusses our work on analyzing 

texts in Assamese language and processing those texts in terms of converting into structured and 

logical representations. Our emphasis is on the Structured Representation of texts and current 

study focuses on providing the architecture and processing workflow of the system to output 

structured form of Assamese text. It also includes system design discussions on how these 

representations of texts in Assamese language will contribute towards building a Question-

Answering system.

1. Introduction: 

Written documents such as text documents, web pages and books contain information in 
a language specific syntactic form, not suitable for automatic processing through 
computers. Therefore, this textual information must be represented in such a manner so 
that analyzing and processing of these texts becomes easier [5][6]. This representation 
also makes automatic knowledge extraction possible. Assamese is a new language for 
which NLP research works have recently started analyzing and building various 
automated computational models. Many research works are going on for other naturally 
occurring languages like English, Bodo etc. Various automated tools and techniques 
have also been developed for these languages. The proposed research work is a new 
domain of research in Assamese language for getting an insight into how sentences in 
Assamese can be analyzed, parsed and interpreted. The structured text representation 
shows the relationship among the constituents of a sentence. It will provide the basis for 
doing higher level projects such as building Question-answering systems [1]. The 
information gained from this kind of representation will also pave the way for further 
research works related to cross-lingual information system, automatic text extraction, 
mining information etc [3]. This research work is expected to give syntactic and 
semantic characteristics of Assamese language in the perspective of computational 
linguistics [1][5]. We are also expecting to get a POS tagged Assamese corpus as well as 
computational modules for building structured and logical representations of Assamese 
text corpus. 

Development of regional languages has been a great concern now a days.  This is due to 
the fact that these languages are getting more demands for putting them as a medium of 
communication of the digital world. Researchers and government agencies have started 
their effort to design and develop different technologies for putting those regional 
languages into the digital world. Research and development of various language 
technologies have also started for Assamese language, which is recognized as a 
scheduled language of Indian constitution. Technologies like UNICODE compliant fonts 
and keyboards, automated spell checker have already been developed for this language 
[9]. Research works are also going on for developing various technologies for Assamese 
language as part of the efforts on technology development of Indian languages.  

Assamese is a new language to digital revolution. This language is also used as a medium 
of communication within the states of North-East India, especially in Arunachal Pradesh 
and Nagaland.  A huge population of India speaks Assamese in different parts of the 
nation who originally belong to Assam.  Assamese speaking people can also be found in 
some nations like, Bhutan and Bangladesh. Tentatively, about 14 million people speak 
Assamese in the state of Assam and its neighbouring states and about 14.3 million 
Assamese speaking people can be found in all over India [9]. 

The origin of Assamese language can be derived from its relation with Indo-Aryan group 
of languages and a little bit with Sino-Tibetan group of languages.  Apart from Assamese, 
languages like Bangla, Oriya, Hindi etc. also fall into the category of Indo-Aryan 
group[9]. These languages have similarity with Assamese language. However, 
differences may also exist among these languages; still, the technologies developed for 
Assamese are expected to be able to provide an insight into the development of similar 

28



 

kind of technologies for these languages. In this paper, we are focusing on the 
representations of Assamese text in terms of the structured and logical formalisms. The 
technologies built in this regard will hopefully be able to represent knowledge in 
structured and logical forms for other Indo-Aryan languages. This will happen due to the 
fact that these languages have similarity with Assamese language. Therefore, we expect 
to design and develop an automated model which will also be used for developing 
technologies for other similar languages. 

In order to analyze a corpus based text in terms of computational linguistics, it must 
pass through different phases like- morphological, syntactical, semantics, pragmatic etc. 
The morphological analysis analyzes individual word and non-word tokens such as 
punctuation markers. These non-word special markers must be separated in this phase. 
In the syntax analysis part, the tokens generated from the morphological analysis are 
transformed into structures showing the relationship among the tokens [1][4]. This 
relationship must follow the grammatical rules of the language. If a combination does 
not follow any rule, that sequence must be rejected. The structures created by the 
syntactic analyzer are assigned meanings at the semantic level. The ambiguity of 
sentences must be resolved in this phase [1][4][3]. We are basically concentrating on 
syntactic level analysis and partially on semantics. The extracted knowledge using these 
two representations provides information in terms of grammatical structures of the 
language. They also provide the scope of doing analysis in semantic levels so that the 
meaning of the sentences can be interpreted. This paper is organized in the following 
way- section 2 gives an idea of related topics which outlines the idea of structured and 
logical representations. Section 3 describes the overall planning of the project work. 
Section 4 provides an outline of analysis of sentences written in Assamese. Section 5 
describes the proposed model for question-answering system which also outlines an idea 
of Assamese question pattern and section 6 is the proposed conclusion.  

2. Related topics:  

2.1 Structured Text:  

The context of the input text must be represented in structured text format. Structured 
text describes the individual objects occurring in the sentences. It attempts to capture 
the knowledge contained in the text essential for doing various kinds of operations. 
Things that are not mentioned explicitly in the given text such as references to pronouns 
are made explicit here. As a whole, it can be said that the context of the sentences are 
represented using structured text [1]. To show this, Let us consider the following English 
sentence- 
                I got the red ball that I wanted. 

This sentence can be represented in structured form in the following manner- 
Event-1 
Instance - Get 
Tense-  Past 
Agent-  I 
Object-  Thing 
 

29



 

Thing 
Instance- Ball 
Color-  Red 
Event-2 
Instance - want 
Tense-  Past 

One of the key ideas of such kind of representation is to find out the meanings of the 
objects with reference to their connections to other objects. Such kind of representation 
can also be termed as slot-and-filler structure [1]. The information gained from such 
kind of structure represents knowledge in terms of syntactic level. It operates as a 
mechanism to see whether these structures conform to the rules or syntax of Assamese 
language.  

2.2 Logical Representation: 

The structured information forms the basic building block for knowledge acquisition 
formalism. The information acquired in structured text representation can be used to 
represent knowledge in logical formalism also. Logical representation can also be 
implemented to acquire new knowledge from old. It guarantees that a new statement can 
be proved to be true because the statement follows from some already proved statements 
[1]. Such kind of representation can be gained through First Order Predicate Calculus 
(FOPC) [2]. Basically the facts and rules in logical representation can be expressed in 
FOPC using PROLOG. The well formed formulas representing the facts and rules should 
be written in Clause form only. The clausal notations can be implemented in question 
answering systems also. Such representation can be used to answer not only yes-no 
questions but also fill-in-the blank questions [1]. To show this, let us consider a sentence 
in English – “Rina eats mango” can be represented in PROLOG as –  

eat (Rina,mango).  
 

Now, if we have a query like –  
 

?eat (Rina,X)  gives the answer   X=mango. 

The proof procedure of PROLOG follows Resolution principle where the proof is 
generated through backward chaining process [1][2]. Actually, the process of deriving 
answers to questions using logic is based on Matching technique. Matching takes two 
terms as input and checks to see whether they match. If they match, the process 
produces a success signal. Using matching process, variables can also be bound to values 
if necessary [2]. For e.g. the terms date(1, may, 2005) and date(D,M,Y) match. The 
results of this matching process is – 

D=1 
M=may 
Y=2005 

Both structured text and logical representations for Assamese language have been 
discussed later in this paper.

3. Proposed System: 

The proposed research work is just the preprocessing phase of doing NLP research in 
Assamese language. We have planned to divide the whole project work into two primary 
modules- The Preprocessor module and the Structured Text Generator module. These 
two modules are again subdivided into some sub modules. The following diagram is a 
structural representation of the proposed system- 

 
 
  
    
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 

FIGURE: Structural / Diagrammatic representation of the proposed system 

As shown in the diagram, an Assamese text based corpus will be taken as the input to the 
system. The Preprocessor module begins with the Sentence Separator module which 
separates the sentences basic to the text corpus. After that the Token Generator module 
begins which extracts individual tokens from the sentences. Next step is to remove the 
stop words such as the punctuation markers or conjunctives from the tokens generated 
so far using the Stop Word Removal module. At this stage, we get the tokens which are 
actually taking part in that particular context. Then we pass these tokens through an 
automated stemmer which generates the root morphemes behind every token. This is 
done by the Root Word Generator module [7]. After this, the root morphemes are 
annotated in terms of Parts-of-Speech (POS) tagging. Using a POS tagger, each 
morpheme will be tagged and these annotated morphemes will be used in the later 
processing of the text. These whole set of operations may be regarded as the 
morphological analysis in terms of computational linguistics. 

Next module is the Structured Text Generator module which generates structured text 
from the outputs of the Preprocessor module. The annotated lexicons provide the 
information about subject(s), verb(s), instance(s) and object(s) in the sentences. 
Structured text representation will be generated based on this information. This same 
information can be used in generating logical representation also. 

Automated validators may be required for testing these representations in terms of 
linguistics.

4. Analysis of Sentences Written in Assamese: 

Sentences in Assamese are the well-organized sequence of parts-of-speech and 
inflections. Therefore, the syntax of a sentence can be termed as the rule-based 
implementation of inflections to the parts-of-speech of the sentence. The structure of 
sentences can also be termed as the structure of the language [8]. 

Sentences in Assamese basically follow the Subject+Object+Verb form. Actually this is 
the structure of a simple sentence. For e.g.   

  �� ����� �	
���� ����� �	
���� ����� �	
���� ����� �	
�� (I read book) 

Sentences may be compound or complex also. Verbs play an important role in such 
sentences because they help in achieving the idea about the meaning of the sentences. 
They have direct relationship with all the cases except case 6, that is, genitive case. The 
association between subject and verb make an Assamese sentence complete. Verb along 
with all cases except the subjective case occur in predicate part of an Assamese sentence 
[8]. The inflections should be incorporated into the words in a proper manner so that the 
actual interpretation of the sentences can be gained. 

In order to analyze sentences written in Assamese, one must possess the knowledge of 
parts-of-speech of this language. In this section, we are producing a sentence level 
analysis in Assamese which has relevance with our work model.  

Let us consider the same sentence- ����� �� ��� ��� �������� �� ��� ��� �������� �� ��� ��� �������� �� ��� ��� ���   

The dataflow model for parsing this sentence is as follows- 

  Sentence in Assamese 
    
 
       

 

  Generated Tokens {��������������������, ��������, ������������, ������������, ������������ , ‘ ‘}   

    
  

  Actual tokens {��������������������, ��������, ������������, ������������, ������������ } 

 
 
    Root Morphemes {����������������, ��������, ��������, ������������, �������� } 
    
 
 

         POS tagged morpheme {����������������(PN), ��������(CN), ��������(AuxV), ������������(Adj), ��������(V)} 

 

The outputs of POS tagging phase are the tagged morphemes of the root words [7].

The tagged morphemes of the assumed sentence are as follows- 

        ����������������                 ��������        ��������                ������������              ��������  
 
 
 
Noun           Noun       Aux. Verb    Adjective        Verb 

The POS tagged morphemes are passed through the syntax analysis phase where a 
graphical representation or a parse tree will be constructed on these morphemes. The 
hierarchical structure must obey the grammatical rule of the language. The output of the 
syntax analysis phase i.e. the parse tree for the particular sentence is as follows- 

    S 
 
   

NP  VP 
 
 
 
  PN NP  VP 
 
    
             

CN    AUXV          VP 
  ���� 
 
       ADJ             V 
   ��             ��� 
       
         
         ���  ��� 
 

FIGURE : Parse tree for the Assamese sentence “����� �� ��� ��� �������� �� ��� ��� �������� �� ��� ��� �������� �� ��� ��� ���” 

In this way, the sentences in Assamese will be analyzed and parsed to examine whether 
they follow the correct syntactic structure of the language. Any sentence structure which 
does not follow any syntax of the language should never be accepted. 

5. Model for Question-Answering System: 

5.1 Assamese Question Pattern: 

Interrogative sentence or question pattern is one of the types of sentences in Assamese 
language. There are two factors playing important role in Assamese question patterns- 
parts-of-speech and rhythm in which the question is being asked. The rhythm of the 
question defines the kind and manner of the response being sought [8]. Some questions 

33



 

may be asked using do-verb in different forms. An example of a simple interrogative 
sentence using do-verb in present tense, second person singular number is given below- 

  �� ���� ���� ���� ��    ���� �
� ������ �
� ������ �
� ������ �
� ��???? (Do you read always?) 
Questions may be formed using �� (What), ��� (Why), �’� (Where), ������ (When), ��� 
(Whose), ��	��� (How), ����� (How Much) etc. Examples of simple question pattern of 
such kind may be- 
  ������ ��� �� ������ ��� �� ������ ��� �� ������ ��� �� ???? (What is your name?) 

  ���� ����� ����� ����� �’� ��	� � ��	� � ��	� � ��	� ???? (Where does he live?) 
Questions patterns may be complex also. These types of interrogative sentences may be 
split up into more than one simple questions or sentences. For e.g. 

�� �� ��� ����	� ��� �� ����	��� ।�� �� ��� ����	� ��� �� ����	��� ।�� �� ��� ����	� ��� �� ����	��� ।�� �� ��� ����	� ��� �� ����	��� । (I do not know  
whether you have eaten rice or not) 

This sentence can be split up into- 
  �� ����	��� ।�� ����	��� ।�� ����	��� ।�� ����	��� । (I do not know) 
  �� �� ��� ����	� �� �� ��� ����	� �� �� ��� ����	� �� �� ��� ����	� ???? (Have you eaten rice?) 

In Assamese, the same question pattern may be asked in different forms. The pattern 
may be different, but the meaning of the question remains same. Let us consider the 
following two examples to understand this. 

   ����� �� ��� ��� �������� �� ��� ��� �������� �� ��� ��� �������� �� ��� ��� ��� ? 
      �� ��� ��� ����� ��� ��� ����� ��� ��� ����� ��� ��� ��� �������������������� ? 
In this way, different question patterns generate the same semantic structure as well as 
same answer set. 

We can also cite the example of rhetorical question where the answer is implicit in the 
question itself. Although asked in the form of a question, but the semantic structure 
generates the implicit answer. Such question patterns are basically used in Assamese to 
enhance the literary quality of Assamese language. 

5.2 Proposed Model: 

The proposed model for question-answering based on structured representation works 
in the following way.  

Suppose we have the following Assamese sentence - 
����� �� ��� ��� �������� �� ��� ��� �������� �� ��� ��� �������� �� ��� ��� ���  (In English, Rina likes to eat mango)   

This sentence can be represented in terms of structured text as given below- 
Event-1 
Instance - ��   (To eat) 
Tense-  !�" ���  (Present) 
Agent-  ����  (Rina) 

Object-  ��  (Mango) 
Event-2 
Instance - ��   (To get) 
Tense-  !�" ���  (Present) 
Modifier- ���   (Like) 

34



 

Again suppose, we want a response to the question-     
����� �� ��� ��� �������� �� ��� ��� �������� �� ��� ��� �������� �� ��� ��� ��� ? (What does Rina like to eat?) 

The answer should be -  �������� (Mango) 
To get the answer, we again have to convert the question into structured form [1]. The 
structured text for the question is represented as follows- 
 

Event-1 
Instance - ��  (To eat) 
Tense-  !�" ���  (Present) 
Agent-  ����  (Rina)  
* Object- ��  (What) 

Event-2 
Instance - ��   (To get) 
Tense-  !�" ���  (Present) 
Modifier- ���  (Like) 

The part of the structure serving as the answer should be marked. Often these markers 
correspond to the question words “who” or “what” in the sentence [1]. This structured 
text for the question will be matched against the structured text generated above. The 
response is generated based on the segments of the structured text that match the 
segments of the structured question being asked. 

Similarly, the same sentence (as above) can be considered to represent knowledge using 
logical formalism also. For this, we have to take into consideration the parse tree 
generated (as in P7) for that sentence. Using this tree structure, logical rules can be 
derived. These rules of inference can then be used perceive answers to questions. 
Basically, the representation of rules can be done using First Order Predicate Logic. 
According to the parse tree, the logical rules of the sentence would be- 

S -> NP VP 

NP -> PN | CN 

VP -> NP VP | AUXV VP | ADJ V 

PN -> ����� 

CN -> �� 

AUXV -> ��� 

ADJ -> ��� 
V -> ��� 

As PROLOG structure, the tree can be represented as follows- 

S (NP(PN(�����)), VP(NP(CN(��)), VP(AUXV(���), VP(ADJ(���), V(���))))) 

Similarly, if the same question (as above) is asked, then the question may also be 
transformed into a similar logical representation as shown above. It would be like as 
follows- 

35



 

?-  S (NP(PN(�����)), VP(NP(X), VP(AUXV(���), VP(ADJ(���), V(���))))) 
Then the answer to the question representing the value of X is returned as - �� (Mango) 
In this way, we can generate answers to questions from a given set of predicate logic 
statements using matching process [2]. 

The structures generated using these two representations may pave the way for doing 
similar kind of research in other languages also. Languages like Bangali, Oriya or Hindi 
fall into the category of Indo-Aryan group of languages to which Assamese language also 
belongs. Therefore, tools developed for one language may help in generating similar kind 
of tools for other related languages also. 

6. Conclusion: 

Natural Language Processing has been a significant area of research in recent years. 
Digital revolution is penetrating in the grassroots level facilitating social development in 
a faster way.  Assamese is a new language for digital revolution. Research works have 
started for design and development of tools and technologies for this language. Our 
proposed work will facilitate the preprocessing phase of NLP research in Assamese 
language. Basically, we have planned to work on syntactic level analysis which will help 
in automatic knowledge acquisition in terms of linguistics. Our project is the first ever 
intended work for giving structured and logical representations in Assamese language. 
As the language is becoming richer for digital revolution, newer applications are 
becoming possibilities for future understanding of the unexplored areas as well as 
intricacies of Assamese language. I visualize this work will also pave the way for Artificial 
Intelligence research works in this language.
