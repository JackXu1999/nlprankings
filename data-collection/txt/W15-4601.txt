Educational discourse is an important area for impact, which is especially timely given

recent attention given to online education. In this talk I will first present a theoretical

account of the complex interplay between written or oral discourse, individual cognitive

processes, and external guidance in Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL)

environments. Based on the Script Theory of Guidance I will analyze how cognitive configu-

rations shape discussions, and how participation in discussions may lead to re-configuration

of the participating individual student’s cognition. Second, I will give an overview of studies

demonstrating the instructional value of specific types of discussion contributions, namely

transactive contributions. I will finally elaborate on ways in which transactive contributions

to discourse can be facilitated through external guidance, and how technologies may play

an important role both in research and in instruction.
