Abstract

Previous studies of alignment have
focused on two-party conversations. We
study multi-party conversation in online
health communities, which have shown
benefits for their members from forum
conversations. So far, our understanding
of the relationship between alignment in
such multi-party conversations and its
possible connection to member benefits
has been limited. This paper quantifies
linguistic alignment in the oldest and the
largest cancer online forum. Alignment
at lexical and syntactic levels, as well as
decay of alignment was observed in forum
threads, although the decay was slower
than commonly found in psycholinguistic
studies. The different pattern of adaptation
to the initial post on a thread suggests that
specific roles in the online forum (e.g.,
seeking support from the community) can
potentially be revealed through alignment
theory and its extensions.

1 Introduction

Linguistic alignment leads conversation partners
to adapt their language patterns to match their
conversation partners. Such patterns comprise of
word choice, sentence structure, and more. For
example, if one conversation partner uses passive
voice in the conversation, other conversation
participants tend to use passive voice at a later
point in time. The mechanism of adaptation are
better understood now (Bock and Griffin, 2000;
Pickering and Ferreira, 2008; Kaschak et al.,
2011a; Reitter et al., 2011). The Interactive
Alignment Model (IAM) (Pickering and Garrod,
2004) attributes dialogic function to the priming
effect; it suggests that adaptation helps people
reach mutual understanding. Some recent studies

(Reitter and Moore, 2007; Fusaroli et al., 2012)
lend empirical confirmation to this thesis.

Repetition effects are not purely mechanistic.
They are sometimes moderated in response to
situational requirements or framing. For example,
they can vary in strength when humans (believe
to) communicate with computers (Branigan et al.,
2010). Repetition intensifies when the purpose of
conversation is to collaborate on a common task
(Reitter et al., 2006). Of course, communication
between individuals is more than a linguistic
event; it is also social. For example, it can be
found as a cue to social relationships in film scripts
(Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil and Lee, 2011). A
more specific aspect of language-based interaction
is pragmatic convention in multi-party dialogue,
which determines turn-taking, shifts in topic, and
more.

One would expect alignment to also occur in
social situations involving multiple speakers. The
social moderators and functions of adaptation
effects, however, are largely unclear. The question
we ask in this paper is whether alignment is
moderated by the role of a speaker’s contribution
to the conversation. In this paper, we deal with
written interaction only; our data are internet
forum conversations.

The first question is whether linguistic
adaptation exists in online communities and
online groups. Dialogues in threads of online
communities are different from previous types of
dialogues. Unlike some spontaneous, free-form
dialogues, threaded conversations have specific
topic. In addition, thread conversations do not
have specific tasks. Therefore, we investigate
whether dialogues in the threads also exhibit
linguistic adaptation, be it as an artifact of
mechanistic language processing or because
adaptation acts as a social or conversational signal.
Adaptation tends to decay over time, although this
decay has not been studied in the context of such

55



slow, asychronuous communication. Therefore,
we will characterize the time-scale of dacay.
More generally, if alignment exists in forums, is it
correlated with the communicative role of a text
or the social role of its author?

The contributions of this paper are: (1)
an exploratory analysis of linguistic adaptation
based on 3,000 conversations threads and 23,045
posts in an online cancer survivor community
(http://csn.cancer.org). Specifically,
we find reliable linguistic adaptation effects in
this corpus. (2) We show that properties of
conversation threads that are different from regular
conversations.

In the following sections, we first survey related
work on linguistic adaptation. Then, we describe
our data and make preliminary definitions. We
then introduce measures of linguistic adaptation.
Last, we discuss a set of properties in online
thread conversations which are unlike other types
of dialogues.

2 Related Work

Linguistic alignment phenomenon in social
interaction has been well explored in previous
literature. It happens because of multiple reasons.
Firstly, it could be due to unconscious linguistic
adaptation. Pickering and Garrod (2004) suggests
that conversations have linguistic coordination
at lexical level. Branigan et al. (2000) and Gries
(2005) show that priming effects exist at the
syntactic level. However, linguistic alignment
could happen consciously by conversation
participants. Some literature suggest that people
flexibly adapt their linguistic patterns to each
other’s in order to improve collective performance
and social coordination (Healey and Mills, 2006;
Garrod and Pickering, 2009).

Linguistic alignment has been found in written
communication as well, which is close to our
work. Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al. (2011)
examines conversations in a Twitter corpus,
showing convergence of Linguistic Inquiry and
Word Count (LIWC) measures. This result
confirms that linguistic alignment exists in written
online social media. Furthermore, in Huffaker
et al. (2006); Scissors et al. (2008); Backstrom
et al. (2013) also show that people adjust their
linguistic style, such as linguistic features, in the
online written chatroom and online community.
Also, priming effects at syntactic level (Gries,

2005; Branigan et al., 2000) have been explored
in several written dataset settings (Pickering and
Ferreira, 2008).

In order to quantify the linguistic alignment
phenomenon, researchers have introduced several
quantitative measures. Several methods evaluate
repetition of linguistic events, such as the use of
words, syntactic rules or a small set of expressions
(Church, 2000; Reitter et al., 2006; Fusaroli et al.,
2012). These approaches typically test whether
linguistic alignment is due to linguistic adaptation
or intrinsic repetition. Moreover, linguistic
feature similarity (Stenchikova and Stent, 2007;
Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2011) is also
widely used to measure linguistic adaptation
precisely.

3 Online Health Communities

Online health communities (OHC) typically
include features such as discussion boards where
cancer survivors and their caregivers can interact
with each other. Support and information
from people with similar cancers or problems
is very valuable because cancer experiences are
unique. Therefore, an online community for
cancer survivors and caregivers enables them to
share experiences related to cancer, seek solutions
to daily living issues, and in general support
one another (Bambina, 2007) in ways that is not
often possible with other close family, friends
or even health care providers. Benefits to
cancer survivors who have participated in an
OHC are reported in the literature. Studies
of cancer OHC have indicated that participation
increases social support (Dunkel-Schetter, 1984;
Rodgers and Chen, 2005), reduces levels of
stress, depression, and psychological trauma
(Beaudoin and Tao, 2008; Winzelberg et al.,
2003), and helps participants be more optimistic
about the course of their life with cancer (Rodgers
and Chen, 2005). The support received from
other OHC members help cancer patients better
cope with their disease and improve their lives
both physically and mentally (Dunkel-Schetter,
1984). Further understanding about these
benefits has been provided by computational text
analysis and machine learning methods, which
enable fine-grained analysis of the sentiments of
individual posts in the discussion forum of cancer
OHC Qiu et al. (2011). It has been shown that
those who started a thread in a cancer OHC often

56



show a more positive sentiment in their posts
later in the thread, after other OHC members
provided replies Qiu et al. (2011); Portier et al.
(2013). However, the potential relationship
between alignment theory and these benefits of
cancer OHC has not been explored. This motivates
us to study the alignment of posts on a thread to the
initial post that starts the thread.

4 Data Description and Preliminary
Definitions

The data used in this study stem from the
Cancer Survivor’s Network (CSN) (http://
csn.cancer.org). The CSN is the oldest and
the largest cancer online community for cancer
survivors, which includes cancer patients, and
their friends and families. CSN has more than
166,000 members (Portier et al., 2013). Members
in CSN present their concerns, ask questions,
share their personal experience and provide social
support to each other through discussion threads.
Similar to other online communities, CSN threads
consist of an initial post followed by a sequence
of reply posts ordered by time. A thread
could be represented as a sequence of post, <
P1, P2, · · · , Pi, · · · , Pn >. In order to better
explain the problem, we show some properties of
a post in the thread.
Absolute Position: Given a post Pi in a thread, the
absolute position of post Pi is i
Relative Position: Given a post Pi in a thread with
n posts, the relative position of Pi is i/n

We construct the CSN corpus by randomly
sampling 3,000 threads from CSN between 2000
and 2010. Using Stanford’s CoreNLP tool (Klein
and Manning, 2003), we generate the syntactic
structure of the text in each post. In order
to calculate linguistic adaptation, we convert
every syntactic tree into structure rules in phrases
(Reitter et al., 2006). The data distribution of CSN
corpus is shown in Figure 1.

5 Measures of Linguistic Adaptation

Following previous work, we implement
Indiscriminate Local Linguistic Alignment
(Fusaroli et al., 2012) at the levels of syntax and
lexicon. In general, indiscriminate local linguistic
alignment measures the repetition of language use
in the target post repeating prime posts. LILA, as
defined, is a normalized measure of the number of
words that occur in both the prime and the target.

The normalization factor is the product of the

Alignment has been demonstrated for
syntax and lexicon, ranging from controlled
experimentation to broad-coverage naturalistic
text (e.g., Bock, 1986; Gries, 2005; Ferreira
and Bock, 2006; Reitter et al., 2006). In this
paper, we present primarily exploratory analyses
that emphasize minimal filtering and data
processing. While some priming effects discussed
in the literature indeed require careful post-hoc
control using many explanatory variables,
the phenomena we discuss are evident with
exploratory, early-stage methods.

5.1 Indiscriminate local linguistic alignment
at the lexical level

Lexical Indiscriminate Local Linguistic Alignment
(LILLA) measures word repetition between one
or more prime post and a target post. The
prime always precedes the target. LILLA, in our
implementation, can be seen as the probability
of a word occurring in a single location, given it
occurred in a prime period. Formally,

LILLA(target, prime) =
p(target|prime)

p(target)
(1)

=

∑
wordi�target

δ(wordi)
length(prime) ∗ length(target) (2)

57



δ(wordi) =
{

1 if wordi � prime
0 otherwise

(3)

where length(X) is the number of words in post
X , and target post is any post following the
prime post. The distance between the two posts
is measured in posts. In different experiment
settings, we focus on certain prime posts, such as
the first post of a thread, or all posts written by a
certain author.

To sum up, LILLA is measured as word
repetition conditioned on the word having been
primed in a previous post. A high value of
LILLA indicates an increased level of linguistic
alignment. Alignment at the lexical level can
have a number of underlying causes, including
lexical priming, but also simply topicality of the
posts. Therefore, it is important to also inspect
indiscriminate local linguistic alignment at the
syntactic level.

5.2 Indiscriminate local linguistic alignment
at the syntactic level

Here, we consider a priming effect of syntactic
structure, which shows users’ implicit linguistic
adaptation. Similar to Reitter et al. (2006), our
cancer survivor network corpus was annotated
with phrase structure trees; unlike in previous
work, we do so using a parser (from the Stanford
CoreNLP package (Klein and Manning, 2003)).
Each post is encoded as a series of syntactic rules.
Indiscriminate local linguistic alignment at the
syntactic level (SILLA) measures the repetition of
syntactic rules in the target post. Similar to our
experiments in lexical repetition, prime posts will
vary in different experimental settings.

5.3 Alignment and Adaptation

In this paper, we distinguish alignment and
adaptation. Alignment is the general adoption
of words, phrases, syntax, and any linguistic
representation that was heard, read, spoken or
written previously. Adaptation is a special case
of alignment: here, speakers permanently adjust
their linguistic preferences, or they learn from
their linguistic experiences. Alignment can be
due to a memory effect (e.g., priming), while
adaptation may alternatively be the result of
speakers discussing a topic. When they do, they
are more likely to use the same words. Both
alignment and adaptation may decay over time.

6 Linguistic properties of conversation
threads

In this section, we will set up four experiments
to show the alignment properties of conversation
threads. For simplification, we will only consider
replies whose post distance is less than 100 (data
distribution shown in Figure 1).

6.1 Linguistic alignment

We assume that there is a constant level of random
indiscriminate local linguistic repetition in human
language, both lexically and syntactically.

We designed a post-hoc experiment to test
whether linguistic alignment effect is due to
linguistic adaptation or intrinsic repetition in
human language, following methodology to
measure long-term adaptation developed in Reitter
and Moore (2007). We split each of 3,000 threads
into two equal-size (by posts) halves. Out of the
resulting 6,000 thread halves, we produce pairs
combining any two sampled thread halves.

We define the binary OneThread variable,
indicating whether a pair consists of material from
the same thread, or if it consists of a first half
from one thread, but a second half from another
thread. This allows us to contrast repetition within
and between threads. If linguistic adaptation exist,
linguistic repetition at the lexical and syntactic
levels between the two halves of a pair will be

more common if OneThread is true.
Figures 2 and 3 show that linguistic

repetition in the same thread is greater than
the control (repetition between different
threads) (Wilcoxon-test pLILLA < 0.001,
pSILLA < 0.001). However, despite the statistical
difference, it is obvious that there is a strong
lexical alignment effect, but much less syntactic
alignment. As a result, we conclude that at
least some linguistic repetition in the online
conversation is due to linguistic adaptation.
Again, at the lexical level, we would expect
some of this repetition to be due to the preferred
repetition of topical words; at the syntactic level,
this is unlikely to be the case.

6.2 Linguistic Adaptation Decays

Strong syntactic repetition has been shown
to diminish within seconds (Reitter et al.,
2006). Precisely, given an use of a syntactic
construction at one point in time, the probability
of this construction being used again is strongly
increased for the first seconds, but decays rapidly
towards its prior probability. In our experiment,
we replicate the decay of linguistic repetition
at the larger scale of forum threads. From a
psycholinguistic perspective, one would expect
only a relatively weak effect, given that syntactic
short-term priming is often short-lived (Branigan

et al., 1999). However, there is also weaker, slow,
long-term persistence (Bock and Griffin, 2000),
which can even be cumulative (Jaeger and Snider,
2007; Kaschak et al., 2011b). The messages in
such forums are written at a much larger timescale
than the priming models and short-term priming
lab experiments investigate.

In the experiment, we split a thread into a
sequence of posts. Given a target post Pj , the
prime post is one post in the subsequence of posts
< P1, · · · , Pi, · · · , Pj−1 >. We calculate LILLA
and SILLA of posts for prime-target distances
below 100. We will use the same method in this
and following experiments.

Figures 4 and 5 show that LILLA and SILLA
drop as the post-distance between a target post and
a prime post in the thread increases. Comparing
syntactic and lexical decay, we note that the
slope of LILLA’s decay is stronger than that of
SILLA’s decay. Both two measurements imply
that linguistic alignment decays over time, by
“utterance“ (for some definition of utterance), or
by post. These results parallel standard results
from the priming literature. Surprisingly, for
forum threads we find this effect at a much larger
scale than in one-on-one spoken dialogue.

6.3 Linguistic adaptation to the initial post

So far, we have largely replicated a known
alignment effect for the case of written
communication in the online forum. There
are some properties of the forum communication
that allow us to investigate a number of open
questions pertaining to alignment in multi-party
dialogue. The main question concerns the
function of alignment. Is it more than an artifact
of low-level memory effects (priming)? Does
it, as Pickering and Garrod (2004) have argued,
contribute to mutual understanding? Or is it,
beyond that, a mechanism to express or establish
social relationships? If alignment is not just a
purely functional phenomenon, but also carries
pragmatic weight or social functions, we would
not expect it to be blind to the role of the author
of the source (prime) post.

In a self-help online discussion forum, the
role of the initial post differs from that of
other messages. The initial post raises an issue
generally, or it poses a concrete question. In
this experiment, we test whether initial posts in
the thread are more important than other replies

in online conversations. That is, given an initial
post, does linguistic alignment still decline with
increasing post distance between the initial post
and the reply post in the online discussion thread?
Also, is linguistic alignment to the initial post
higher than that to any post?

Figure 4 plots lexical alignment (LILLA). We
can see that lexical alignment is present for the
initial post as well, but not more so than in general.
In fact, the absolute level as well as the decay of
LILLA to the initial post is weaker than that of
LILLA to any post in the thread.

To distinguish linguistic adaptation from more
general alignment effects, we also test syntactic
alignment, SILLA. Figure 5 plots this measure.
SILLA shows a different story compared to
LILLA. It shows that syntactic adaptation takes
place (and decays) for all posts, but that there
is less, if even initial anti-alignment with the
posts from the initial author. The results may be
supported by properties of conversation in internet
threads. In an online community, initial posts
generally raise questions. Different sentence types
(e.g., questions) may be used by someone seeking
help. So, alignment with the initial post may
seem to decay after post 25, but also shows more
variance (due to fewer data-points).

In sum, both measurements suggest that
linguistic alignment takes place with general
material presented before the target text, and
that repetition probability does decrease over
time or linguistic material (posts) as theoretically
predicted. We do not see evidence for a strong
social role of alignment.

6.4 Linguistic adaptation to the author of the
first post

As the previous experiment showed, lexical
alignment to the initial post decays over time.
There is no evidence that alignment with the initial
post is related to its informational role in the
thread. However, is alignment affected by the
social role taken on by the author that asks the
initial question? In other words, do writers align
more with posts from the initial author than with
others?

Figure 4 shows that LILLA drops gradually
when prime posts are restricted to the initial
author. Lexical alignment to the initial author
behaves similarly to alignment with the initial
post. At the lexical level, repetition of material

60



provided by the initial author or initial post
does not drop as rapidly as it does for general
material, and it starts at a lower level. Further
investigations will be needed to better understand
the alignment effects and the slow decay with
the thread-initiating post. For example, further
analysis is needed to investigate whether the
slow decay is related to the support function
the community provides to the thread initiators.
Syntactic alignment (SILLA, Figure 5) suggests
weaker alignment effects for the initial author
and the initial post. Further investigations will
also be needed to study the syntactic alignment
of replying posts to early reply posts. If such
alignment exists, it provides further insights about
the leadership role in the community (Zhao et al.,
2014).

This finding result may be supported by
properties of online support communities.
Specifically, the author of the initial post is the
person that would like to receive support from
other community members. People who reply
provide support to that initial author. Therefore,
replies in the thread are likely to have expressions
different from those used in the initial post and by
the initial author.

7 Conclusion

Motivated by analyzing linguistic adaptation
behavior in online communities, we provide
a descriptive analysis that qualifies linguistic
alignment at both the lexical and syntactic levels.
A novel observation is that we find reliable
linguistic adaptation in online communities. We
replicate the temporal, logarithmic decay, but we
found it at a much slower pace or larger scale than
psycholinguistic work has done in experiment or
corpus studies.

The distinction we make between syntactic and
lexical alignment has implications for the possible
mechanisms behind the adaptation effect. A
writer’s lexical choices are influenced by topic,
while syntactic composition happens implicitly,
i.e., without (conscious) attention. Topics do
not remain the same during a conversation: they
shift throughout the thread. This clustering of
topics can create alignment and decay but as far
as permanent adaptation is concerned there is
nothing but the illusion of it.

Our study provides some insight into properties
of linguistic alignment particularly in thread-based

discussions. Different from regular dialogues,
the initial post and the author of the initial
post may have a special role in such dialogues.
We see differences in lexical and syntactic
alignment. We assume that these are likely due
to conversational properties rather than underlying
cognitive processes.

This phenomenon provides an interesting
angle to study online communities as well as
linguistic alignment from the perspectives of
communication and psycholinguistics.

Following these exploratory studies, we plan
to measure discriminate alignment next. Here,
priming spans across semantic relationships rather
than only word identity (Swinney et al., 1979).
Also, a next step would be to build a model that
can quantify alignment (or even adaptation) and
relate it to the factors pertinent to the discussion
and the community, such as network measures and
an individual propensity to align.
