Abstract

Representation and learning of commonsense
knowledge is one of the foundational prob-
lems in the quest to enable deep language un-
derstanding. This issue is particularly chal-
lenging for understanding casual and corre-
lational relationships between events. While
this topic has received a lot of interest in the
NLP community, research has been hindered
by the lack of a proper evaluation framework.
This paper attempts to address this problem
with a new framework for evaluating story
understanding and script learning: the ‘Story
Cloze Test’. This test requires a system to
choose the correct ending to a four-sentence
story. We created a new corpus of 50k
five-sentence commonsense stories, ROCSto-
ries, to enable this evaluation. This corpus is
unique in two ways: (1) it captures a rich set of
causal and temporal commonsense relations
between daily events, and (2) it is a high qual-
ity collection of everyday life stories that can
also be used for story generation. Experimen-
tal evaluation shows that a host of baselines
and state-of-the-art models based on shallow
language understanding struggle to achieve a
high score on the Story Cloze Test. We discuss
these implications for script and story learn-
ing, and offer suggestions for deeper language
understanding.

1 Introduction

Story understanding is an extremely challenging
task in natural language understanding with a long-
running history in AI (Charniak, 1972; Winograd,
1972; Turner, 1994; Schubert and Hwang, 2000).

Recently, there has been a renewed interest in story
and narrative understanding based on progress made
in core NLP tasks. This ranges from generic story
telling models to building systems which can com-
pose meaningful stories in collaboration with hu-
mans (Swanson and Gordon, 2008). Perhaps the
biggest challenge of story understanding (and story
generation) is having commonsense knowledge for
the interpretation of narrative events. The question
is how to provide commonsense knowledge regard-
ing daily events to machines.

A large body of work in story understanding
has focused on learning scripts (Schank and Abel-
son, 1977). Scripts represent structured knowledge
about stereotypical event sequences together with
their participants. It is evident that various NLP
applications (text summarization, co-reference res-
olution, question answering, etc.) can hugely ben-
efit from the rich inferential capabilities that struc-
tured knowledge about events can provide. Given
that developing hand-built scripts is extremely time-
consuming, there is a serious need for automati-
cally induced scripts. Most relevant to this issue is
work on unsupervised learning of ‘narrative chains’
(Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008) and event schemas
(Chambers and Jurafsky, 2009; Balasubramanian et
al., 2013; Cheung et al., 2013; Nguyen et al., 2015).
The first requirement of any learner is to decide on
a corpus to drive the learning process. We are fore-
most interested in a resource that is full of temporal
and causal relations between events because causal-
ity is a central component of coherency. Personal
stories from daily weblogs are good sources of com-
monsense causal information (Gordon and Swan-

839



son, 2009; Manshadi et al., 2008), but teasing out
useful information from noisy blog entries is a prob-
lem of its own. Consider the following snippet from
ICWSM 2011 Spinn3r Dataset of Weblog entries
(Burton et al., 2009):

“I had an interesting day in the studio today. It was so in-
teresting that I took pictures along the way to describe it to
you. Sometimes I like to read an autobiography/biography
to discover how someone got from there to here.....how they
started, how they traveled in mind and spirit, what made
them who they are now. Well, today, my work was a little
like that.”

This text is full of discourse complexities. A host
of challenging language understanding tasks are re-
quired to get at the commonsense knowledge em-
bedded within such text snippets. What is needed
is a simplified version of these narratives. This pa-
per introduces a new corpus of such short common-
sense stories. With careful prompt design and mul-
tiple phases of quality control, we collected 50k
high quality five-sentence stories that are full of
stereotypical causal and temporal relations between
events. The corpus not only serves as a resource for
learning commonsense narrative schemas, but is also
suitable for training story generation models. We de-
scribe this corpus in detail in Section 3.

This new corpus also addresses a problem facing
script learning over the past few years. Despite the
attention scripts have received, progress has been in-
hibited by the lack of a systematic evaluation frame-
work. A commonly used evaluation is the ‘Narra-
tive Cloze Test’ (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008) in
which a system predicts a held-out event (a verb
and its arguments) given a set of observed events.
For example, the following is one such test with a
missing event: {X threw, pulled X, told X, ???, X
completed}1. As is often the case, several works
now optimize to this specific test, achieving higher
scores with shallow techniques. This is problematic
because the models often are not learning common-
sense knowledge, but rather how to beat the shallow
test.

This paper thus introduces a new evaluation
framework called the Story Cloze Test. Instead of
predicting an event, the system is tasked with choos-
ing an entire sentence to complete the given story.

1Narrative cloze tests were not meant to be human solvable.

We collected 3,742 doubly verified Story Cloze Test
cases. The test is described in detail in Section 4.

Finally, this paper proposes several models, in-
cluding the most recent state-of-the-art approaches
for the narrative cloze test, for tackling the Story
Cloze Test. The results strongly suggest that achiev-
ing better than random or constant-choose perfor-
mance requires richer semantic representation of
events together with deeper levels of modeling the
semantic space of stories. We believe that switching
to the Story Cloze Test as the empirical evaluation
framework for story understanding and script learn-
ing can help direct the field to a new direction of
deeper language understanding.

2 Related Work

Several lines of research have recently focused on
learning narrative/event representations. Chambers
and Jurafsky first proposed narrative chains (Cham-
bers and Jurafsky, 2008) as a partially ordered set
of narrative events that share a common actor called
the ‘protagonist’. A narrative event is a tuple of
an event (a verb) and its participants represented as
typed dependencies. Several expansions have since
been proposed, including narrative schemas (Cham-
bers and Jurafsky, 2009), script sequences (Regneri
et al., 2010), and relgrams (Balasubramanian et al.,
2013). Formal probabilistic models have also been
proposed to learn event schemas and frames (Che-
ung et al., 2013; Bamman et al., 2013; Chambers,
2013; Nguyen et al., 2015). These are trained on
smaller corpora and focus less on large-scale learn-
ing. A major shortcoming so far is that these models
are mainly trained on news articles. Little knowl-
edge about everyday life events are learned.

Several groups have directly addressed script
learning by focusing exclusively on the narrative
cloze test. Jans et al. (Jans et al., 2012) redefined
the test to be a text ordered sequence of events,
whereas the original did not rely on text order
(Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008). Since then, oth-
ers have shown language-modeling techniques per-
form well (Pichotta and Mooney, 2014a; Rudinger et
al., 2015). This paper shows that these approaches
struggle on the richer Story Cloze evaluation.

There has also been renewed attention toward
natural language comprehension and commonsense

840



reasoning (Levesque, 2011; Roemmele et al., 2011;
Bowman et al., 2015). There are a few recent frame-
works for evaluating language comprehension (Her-
mann et al., 2015; Weston et al., 2015), including
the MCTest (Richardson et al., 2013) as a notable
one. Their framework also involves story compre-
hension, however, their stories are mostly fictional,
on average 212 words, and geared toward children in
grades 1-4. Some progress has been made in story
understanding by limiting the task to the specific do-
mains and question types. This includes research on
understanding newswire involving terrorism scripts
(Mueller, 2002), stories about people in a restau-
rant where a reasonable number of questions about
time and space can be answered (Mueller, 2007),
and generating stories from fairy tales (McIntyre and
Lapata, 2009). Finally, there is a rich body of work
on story plot generation and creative or artistic story
telling (Méndez et al., 2014; Riedl and León, 2008).
This paper is unique to these in its corpus of short,
simple stories with a wide variety of commonsense
events. We show these to be useful for learning,
but also for enabling a rich evaluation framework for
narrative understanding.

3 A Corpus of Short Commonsense Stories

We aimed to build a corpus with two goals in mind:

1. The corpus contains a variety of commonsense
causal and temporal relations between every-
day events. This enables learning narrative
structure across a range of events, as opposed
to a single domain or genre.

2. The corpus is a high quality collection of non-
fictional daily short life stories, which can be
used for training rich coherent story-telling
models.

In order to narrow down our focus, we carefully
define a narrative or story as follows: ‘A narrative
or story is anything which is told in the form of
a causally (logically) linked set of events involv-
ing some shared characters’. The classic definition
of a story requires having a plot, (e.g., a charac-
ter following a goal and facing obstacles), however,
here we are not concerned with how entertaining
or dramatic the stories are. Instead, we are con-
cerned with the essence of actually being a logi-

cally meaningful story. We follow the notion of
‘storiness’ (Forster, 1927; Bailey, 1999), which is
described as “the expectations and questions that
a reader may have as the story develops”, where
expectations are ‘common-sense logical inferences’
made by the imagined reader of the story.

We propose to satisfy our two goals by asking
hundreds of workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk
(AMT) to write novel five-sentence stories. The five-
sentence length gives enough context to the story
without allowing room for sidetracks about less im-
portant or irrelevant information in the story. In this
Section we describe the details about how we col-
lected this corpus, and provide statistical analysis.

3.1 Data Collection Methodology
Crowdsourcing this corpus makes the data collec-
tion scalable and adds to the diversity of stories. We
tested numerous pilots with varying prompts and in-
structions. We manually checked the submitted sto-
ries in each pilot and counted the number of sub-
missions which did not have our desired level of co-
herency or were specifically fictional or offensive.
Three people participated in this task and they iter-
ated over the ratings until everyone agreed with the
next pilot’s prompt design. We achieved the best re-
sults when we let the workers write about anything
they have in mind, as opposed to mandating a pre-
specified topic. The final crowdsourcing prompt can
be found in supplementary material.

The key property that we had enforced in our
final prompt was the following: the story should
read like a coherent story, with a specific begin-
ning and ending, where something happens in be-
tween. This constraint resulted in many causal and
temporal links between events. Table 1 shows the
examples we provided to the workers for instruct-
ing them about the constraints. We set a limit of
70 characters to the length of each sentence. This
prevented multi-part sentences that include unnec-
essary details. The workers were also asked to pro-
vide a title that best describes their story. Last but
not least, we instructed the workers not to use quo-
tations in their sentences and avoid using slang or
informal language.

Collecting high quality stories with these con-
straints gives us a rich collection of commonsense
stories which are full of stereotypical inter-event re-

one of the three properties that each story should satisfy: (1) being realistic, (2) having clear beginning and
ending, and (3) not stating anything irrelevant to the story.

lations. For example, from the good story in first
row of Table 1, one can extract the narrative chain
represented in Figure 1. Developing a better se-
mantic representation for narrative chains which can
capture rich inter-event relations in these stories is a
topic of future work.

Quality Control: One issue with crowdsourcing
is how to instruct non-expert workers. This task is a
type of creative writing, and is trickier than classifi-
cation and tagging tasks. In order to ensure we get
qualified workers, we designed a qualification test
on AMT in which the workers had to judge whether
or not a given story (total five stories) is an accept-
able one. We used five carefully selected stories to
be a part of the qualification test. This not only elim-
inates any potential spammers on AMT, but also pro-
vides us with a pool of creative story writers. Fur-
thermore, we qualitatively browsed through the sub-
missions and gave the workers detailed feedback be-
fore approving their submissions. We often bonused
our top workers, encouraging them to write new sto-
ries on a daily basis.

Statistics: Figure 2 shows the distribution of
number of tokens of different sentence positions.
The first sentence tends to be shorter, as it usually
introduces characters or sets the scene, and the fifth

sentence is longer, providing more detailed conclu-
sions to the story. Table 2 summarizes the statistics
of our crowdsourcing effort. Figure 3 shows the dis-
tribution of the most frequent 50 events in the cor-
pus. Here we count event as any hyponym of ‘event’
or ‘process’ in WordNet (Miller., 1995). The top two
events, ‘go’ and ‘get’, each comprise less than 2% of
all the events, which illustrates the rich diversity of
the corpus.

gram sequence. For this analysis we set n=5, where
the mean number of tokens in titles is 9.8 and me-
dian is 10. The ‘end’ token distinguishes the actual
ending of a title from five-gram cut-off. This fig-
ure demonstrates the range of topics that our workers
have written about. The full circle reflects on 100%
of the title n-grams and the n-gram paths in the faded
3/4 of the circle comprise less than 0.1% of the n-
grams. This further demonstrates that the range of
topics covered by our corpus is quite diverse. A full
dynamic visualization of these n-grams can be found

3.2 Corpus Release

The corpus is publicly available to the com-
munity and can be accessed through http:
//cs.rochester.edu/nlp/rocstories,
which will be grown even further over the coming
years. Given the quality control pipeline and the
creativity required from workers, data collection
goes slowly.

We are also making available semantic parses of
these stories. Since these stories are not newswire,
off-the-shelf syntactic and shallow semantic parsers
for event extraction often fail on the language. To
address this issue, we customized search param-
eters and added a few lexical entries2 to TRIPS
broad-coverage semantic parser3, optimizing its per-
formance on our corpus. TRIPS parser (Allen et
al., 2008) produces state-of-the-art logical forms for
input stories, providing sense disambiguated and
ontology-typed rich deep structures which enables
event extraction together with semantic roles and
coreference chains throughout the five sentences.

3.3 Temporal Analysis

Being able to temporally order events in the stories
is a pre-requisite for complete narrative understand-
ing. Temporal analysis of the events in our short
commonsensical stories is an important topic of fur-
ther research on its own. In this Section, we sum-
marize two of our analyses regarding the nature of
temporal ordering of events in our corpus.

Shuffling Experiment: An open question in any
text genre is how text order is related to tempo-
ral order. Do the sentences follow the real-world
temporal order of events? This experiment shuf-
fles the stories and asks AMT workers to arrange
them back to a coherent story. This can shed light
on the correlation between the original position of
the sentences and the position when another human
rearranges them in a commonsensically meaningful
way. We set up this experiment as follows: we sam-
pled two sets of 50 stories from our corpus: Good-
Stories50 and Random-Stories50. Good-Stories504 is
sampled from a set of stories written by top workers

2For example, new informal verbs such as ‘vape’ or ‘vlog’
have been added to the lexicon of this semantic parser.

who have shown shown consistent quality through-
out their submissions. Random-Stories505 is a ran-
dom sampling from all the stories in the corpus.
Then we randomly shuffled the sentences in each
story and asked five crowd workers on AMT to rear-
range the sentences.

Table 3 summarizes the results of this experiment.
The first row shows the result of ordering if we
take the absolute majority ordering of the five crowd
workers as the final ordering. The second row shows
the result of ordering if we consider each of the 250
(50 stories x 5 workers ordering each one) ordering
cases independently. As shown, the good stories are
perfectly ordered with very high accuracy. It is im-
portant to note that this specific set rarely had any
linguistic adverbials such as ‘first’, ‘then’, etc. to
help human infer the ordering, so the main factors
at play are the following: (1) the commonsensical
temporal and causal relation between events (narra-
tive schemas), e.g., human knows that first some-
one loses a phone then starts searching; (2) the nat-
ural way of narrating a story which starts with intro-
ducing the characters and concludes the story at the
end. The role of the latter factor is quantified in the
misplacement rate of each position reported in Table
3, where the first and last sentences are more often
correctly placed than others. The high precision of
ordering in sentences 2 up to 4 further verifies the
richness of our corpus in terms of logical relation
between events.

TimeML Annotation: TimeML-driven analysis
of these stories can give us finer-grained insight
about temporal aspect of the events in this corpus.
We performed a simplified TimeML-driven (Puste-
jovsky et al., 2003) expert annotation of a sample of
20 stories6. Among all the temporal links (TLINK)
annotated, 62% were ‘before’ and 10% were ‘simul-
taneous’. We were interested to know if the actual
text order mirrors real-world order of events. We

5This set can be found here: https://goo.gl/pgm2KR
6The annotation is available: http://goo.gl/7qdNsb

found that sentence order matches TimeML order
55% of the time. A more comprehensive study of
temporal and causal aspects of these stories requires
defining a specific semantic annotation framework
which covers not only temporal but also causal re-
lations between commonsense events. This is cap-
tured in a recent work which introduces a Causal and
Temporal Relation Scheme (CaTeRS) for semantic
annotation of event structures (Mostafazadeh et al.,
2016).

4 A New Evaluation Framework
As described earlier in the introduction, the common
evaluation framework for script learning is the ‘Nar-
rative Cloze Test’ (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008),
where a system generates a ranked list of guesses for
a missing event, given some observed events. The
original goal of this test was to provide a compara-
tive measure to evaluate narrative knowledge. How-
ever, gradually, the community started optimizing
towards the performance on the test itself, achiev-
ing higher scores without demonstrating narrative
knowledge learning. For instance, generating the
ranked list according to the event’s corpus frequency
(e.g., always predicting ‘X said’) was shown to be
an extremely strong baseline (Pichotta and Mooney,
2014b). Originally, narrative cloze test chains were
extracted by hand and verified as gold chains. How-
ever, the cloze test chains used in all of the most
recent works are not human verified as gold.

It is evident that there is a need for a more system-
atic automatic evaluation framework which is more
in line with the original deeper script/story under-
standing goals. It is important to note that reorder-
ing of temporally shuffled stories (Section 3.3) can
serve as a framework to evaluate a system’s story un-
derstanding. However, reordering can be achieved
to a degree by using various surface features such as
adverbials, so this cannot be a foolproof story un-
derstanding evaluation framework. Our ROCStories
corpus enables a brand new framework for evalu-
ating story understanding, called the ‘Story Cloze

844



Test’.

4.1 Story Cloze Test

The cloze task (Taylor, 1953) is used to evaluate
a human (or a system) for language understanding
by deleting a random word from a sentence and
having a human fill in the blank. We introduce
‘Story Cloze Test’, in which a system is given a
four-sentence ‘context’ and two alternative endings
to the story, called ‘right ending’ and ‘wrong end-
ing’. Hence, in this test the fifth sentence is blank.
Then the system’s task is to choose the right end-
ing. The ‘right ending’ can be viewed as ‘entailing’
hypothesis in a classic Recognizing Textual Entail-
ment (RTE) framework (Giampiccolo et al., 2007),
and ‘wrong’ ending can be seen as the ’contradict-
ing’ hypothesis. Table 4 shows three example Story
Cloze Test cases.

Story Cloze Test will serve as a generic story
understanding evaluation framework, also applica-
ble to evaluation of story generation models (for
instance by computing the log-likelihoods assigned
to the two ending alternatives by the story genera-
tion model), which does not necessarily imply re-
quirement for explicit narrative knowledge learning.
However, it is safe to say that any model that per-
forms well on Story Cloze Test is demonstrating
some level of deeper story understanding.

4.2 Data Collection Methodology

We randomly sampled 13,500 stories from ROCSto-
ries Corpus and presented only the first four sen-
tences of each to AMT workers. For each story,
a worker was asked to write a ‘right ending’ and a
‘wrong ending’. The workers were prompted to sat-
isfy two conditions: (1) the sentence should follow
up the story by sharing at least one of the characters
of the story, and (2) the sentence should be entirely
realistic and sensible when read in isolation. These
conditions make sure that the Story Cloze Test cases
are not trivial. More details on this setup is described
in the supplementary material.

Quality Control: The accuracy of the Story
Cloze Test can play a crucial role in directing the
research community in the right trajectory. We im-
plemented the following two-step quality control:

1. Qualification Test: We designed a qualification

test for this task, where the workers had to choose
whether or not a given ‘right ending’ and ‘wrong
ending’ satisfy our constraints. At this stage we
collected 13,500 cloze test cases.

2. Human Verification: In order to further validate
the cloze test cases, we compiled the 13,500
Story Cloze Test cases into 2×13, 500 = 27, 000
full five-sentence stories. Then for each story we
asked three crowd workers to verify whether or
not the given sequence of five sentences makes
sense as a meaningful and coherent story, rating
within {-1, 0, 1}. Then we filtered cloze test
cases which had ‘right ending’ with all ratings 1
and ‘wrong ending’ with all ratings 0. This pro-
cess ensures that there are no boundary cases of
‘right ending’ and ‘wrong ending’. This resulted
in final 3,742 test cases, which was randomly di-
vided into validation and test Story Cloze Test
sets. We also made sure to remove the original
stories used in the validation and test set from our
ROCStories Corpus.

Statistics: Table 5 summarizes the statistics of
our crowdsourcing effort. The Story Cloze Test sets
can also be accessed through our website.

5 Story Cloze Test Models

In this Section we demonstrate that Story Cloze
Test cannot be easily tackled by using shallow tech-
niques, without actually understanding the underly-
ing narrative. Following other natural language in-
ference frameworks such as RTE, we evaluate sys-
tem performance according to basic accuracy mea-
sure, which is defined as #correct#test cases . We present the
following baselines and models for tackling Story
Cloze Test. All of the models are tested on the vali-
dation and test Story Cloze sets, where only the val-
idation set could be used for any tuning purposes.
1. Frequency: Ideally, the Story Cloze Test cases
should not be answerable without the context. For
example, if for some context the two alternatives
are ‘He was mad after he won’7 and ‘He was
cheerful after he won’, the first alternative is sim-
ply less probable in real world than the other one.
This baseline chooses the alternative with higher

7Given our prompt that the ‘wrong ending’ sentences should
make sense in isolation, such cases should be rare in our dataset.

al., 2013) embedding to the average word2vec em-
bedding of the context. This is basically an en-
hanced word overlap baseline, which accounts for
semantic similarity.
4. Sentiment-Full: Choose the hypothesis that
matches the average sentiment of the context. We
use the state-of-the-art sentiment analysis model
(Manning et al., 2014) which assigns a numerical
value from 1 to 5 to a sentence.
5. Sentiment-Last: Choose the hypothesis that
matches the sentiment of the last context sentence.

6. Skip-thoughts Model: This model uses Skip-
thoughts’ Sentence2Vec embedding (Kiros et al.,
2015) which models the semantic space of novels.
This model is trained on the ‘BookCorpus’ (Zhu et
al., 2015) (containing 16 different genres) of over
11,000 books. We use the skip-thoughts embedding
of the alternatives and contexts for making decision
the same way as with GenSim model.

7. Narrative Chains-AP: Implements the standard
approach to learning chains of narrative events based
on Chambers and Jurafsky (2008). An event is rep-
resented as a verb and a typed dependency (e.g., the
subject of runs). We computed the PMI between all
event pairs in the Associate Press (AP) portion of
the English Gigaword Corpus that occur at least 2
times. We run coreference over the given story, and
choose the hypothesis whose coreferring entity has
the highest average PMI score with the entity’s chain
in the story. If no entity corefers in both hypotheses,
it randomly chooses one of the hypotheses.

8. Narrative Chains-Stories: The same model as
above, but trained on ROCStories.

9. Deep Structured Semantic Model (DSSM):
This model (Huang et al., 2013) is trained to project
the four-sentences context and the fifth sentence into
the same vector space. It consists of two separate
deep neural networks for learning jointly the em-
bedding of the four-sentences context and the fifth
sentence, respectively. As suggested in Huang et al.
(2013), the input of the DSSM is based on context-
dependent characters, e.g., the distribution count of
letter-trigrams in the context and in the fifth sen-
tence, respectively. The hyper parameters of the
DSSM is determined on the validation set, while the

model’s parameters are trained on the ROCStories
corpus. In our experiment, each of the two neural
networks in the DSSM has two layers: the dimen-
sion of the hidden layer is 1000, and the dimension
of the embedding vector is 300. At runtime, this
model picks the candidate with the largest cosine
similarity between its vector representation and the
context’s vector representation.

The results of evaluating these models on the
Story Cloze validation and test sets are shown in Ta-
ble 6. The constant-choose-first (51%) and human
performance (100%) is also provided for compari-
son. Note that these sets were doubly verified by
human, hence it does not have any boundary cases,
resulting in 100% human performance. The DSSM
model achieves the highest accuracy, but only 7.2
points higher than constant-choose-first. Error anal-
ysis on the narrative chains model shows why this
and other event-based language models are not suf-
ficient for the task: often, the final sentences of
our stories contain complex events beyond the main
verb, such as ‘Bill was highly unprepared’ or ‘He
had to go to a homeless shelter’. Event language
models only look at the verb and syntactic relation
like ‘was-object’ and ‘go-to’. In that sense, going to
a homeless shelter is the same as going to the beach.
This suggests the requirement of having richer se-
mantic representation for events in narratives. Our
proposed Story Cloze Test offers a new challenge to
the community.

6 Discussion

There are three core contributions in this paper: (1)
a new corpus of commonsense stories, called ROC-
Stories, (2) a new evaluation framework to evalu-
ate script/story learners, called Story Cloze Test, and
(3) a host of first approaches to tackle this new test

framework. ROCStories Corpus is the first crowd-
sourced corpus of its kind for the community. We
have released about 50k stories, as well as valida-
tion and test sets for Story Cloze Test. This dataset
will eventually grow to 100k stories, which will be
released through our website. In order to continue
making meaningful progress on this task, although it
is possible to keep increasing the size of the training
data, we expect the community to develop models
that will learn to generalize to unseen commonsense
concepts and situations.

The Story Cloze Test proved to be a challenge to
all of the models we tested. We believe it will serve
as an effective evaluation for both story understand-
ing and script knowledge learners. We encourage
the community to benchmark their progress by re-
porting their results on Story Cloze test set. Com-
pared to the previous Narrative Cloze Test, we found
that one of the early models for that task actually
performs worse than random guessing. We can con-
clude that Narrative Cloze test spurred interest in
script learning, however, it ultimately does not eval-
uate deeper knowledge and language understanding.
