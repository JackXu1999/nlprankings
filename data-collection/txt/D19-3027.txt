Abstract

MY-AKKHARA is a method used to input
Burmese texts encoded in the Unicode
standard, based on commonly accepted Latin
transcription. By using this method, arbitrary
Burmese strings can be accurately inputted
with 26 lowercase Latin letters. Meanwhile,
the 26 uppercase Latin letters are designed
as shortcuts of lowercase letter sequences.
The frequency of Burmese characters is
considered in MY-AKKHARA to realize an
efficient keystroke distribution on a QWERTY
keyboard. Given that the Unicode standard
has not been extensively used in digitization
of Burmese, we hope that MY-AKKHARA can
contribute to the widespread use of Unicode
in Myanmar and can provide a platform
for smart input methods for Burmese in the
future. An implementation of MY-AKKHARA
running in Windows is released at http:

1 Introduction

Burmese (Myanmar) script is an abugida system,
wherein basic characters can be modified using di-
acritics at all directions or can be combined verti-
cally, rather than a simple left-to-right horizontal
writing (Ding et al., 2016). Details of the Burmese
language can be referred to in Okell and Allott
(2001), Okell (2010a,b), and Okano (2007).

Although its use is encouraged in the govern-
ment and universities, the use of Unicode for
Burmese script1 is not currently widespread. Tra-
ditional shape-based typefaces such as Zawgyi2

are preferred for daily use. The issue can be
regarded as path dependence due to traditional
typewriters, wherein the input is exactly based

tion, size and position of 102F by 103C, and the posi-
tion of 1037 by 102F.

on character shape, rather than the phonetic val-
ues of characters (Fig. 1). Zawgyi separately en-
codes all possible variants of characters and dia-
critics, and allows users to select correct variants
manually. Hence, a redundant character set be-
comes incompatible with the Unicode standard,
and extra effort is required for users to utilize
typeface in detail. To provide a better interface
and promote Unicode for Burmese digitization,
we design a Burmese input method referred to
as MY-AKKHARA by Romanization based on the
Unicode standard. MY-AKKHARA is generally
based on the mnemonics used in Unicode and
the Myanmar Language Committee Transcription
System (Department of the Myanmar Language
Commission, 2014). The efficiency of the key dis-
tribution on the QWERTY keyboard layout is also
considered in the design of MY-AKKHARA.

The implementation of MY-AKKHARA running
in Windows has been released. In this paper,
we first review the default layouts of Burmese
provided in Windows (Win) and Macintosh
(Mac) and subsequently provide detailed descrip-
tions of MY-AKKHARA. In addition, the keystroke
distribution of different methods is compared.

2 Win and Mac Burmese Keyboards

The keyboard layouts used to input Burmese in
Unicode have been provided in Win and Mac
operating systems. Figure 2 illustrates the de-
fault layouts of the Burmese Unicode keyboard
in these two mainstream operating systems. Both
of the layouts are a simple mapping from char-
acters to keys. Excluding special punctuation
marks and native number digits, 63 Unicode char-
acters are required to represent modern standard
Burmese textual data, from Unicode 1000 to
104F.3 Therefore, 26 keys with shift are not suf-
ficient to cover the character set. In both of the
layouts, extra punctuation (or digit), or alternative
keys are necessary in typing.

The Win layout is adjusted from the traditional
layout of a typewriter, by removing redundant
character varieties and re-arranging the characters
inputted using the Shift-key. Considering that
this layout has a large portion of the traditional one
but with a certain difference, many Win users are
not interested in switching to this layout. Hence
non-Unicode fonts are still inputted using the tra-
ditional keyboard in practice. Moreover, the Mac
layout is completely redesigned based on Roman-
ization manner, wherein the Burmese characters
are arranged on the basis of their pronunciations
as represented by the letters on a QWERTY key-
board. However, the design is inflexible, without
considering the practical use of Burmese charac-
ters. Thus, the positioning of fingers when typing
is tricky. The comparison of the keystroke distri-
bution will be presented in Section 4.

3 MY-AKKHARA: Proposed Input Method

The proposed MY-AKKHARA is inspired by the
Mac layout and deemed highly natural and ef-
ficient. Rather than a simple mapping between
the Unicode characters and keys, we also fa-
cilitate character alternation processing by using
the inputted Latin letters. Specifically, double
keystrokes of e, f, h, i, j, r, u, v, w, and y,
and the h- and g-keys at the middle of a QWERTY
keyboard are used to alternate characters. This de-
sign naturally integrates the Romanization into the
character alternation processing. The q-key is re-
served to disambiguate in obscure cases through
which the input method can precisely input any

3Within this range, from 1040 to 104B are Burmese dig-
its and punctuation marks; 1022, 1028, 1033, 1034, and
1035 are not used for standard Burmese.

strings with the Unicode Burmese characters.4

Lowercase a, o, x, and 26 uppercase Latin let-
ters are assigned as optional shortcuts. Figure 3
shows an example on the technique of inputting
a Burmese string with rare and stacked characters
using the proposed method.

The instruction of the proposed input method
can be printed by users on an A4 paper (Fig. 4).
The proposed method can be formulated primarily
through a finite-state automaton (Hopcroft et al.,
2013), receiving strings comprising 23 lowercase
Latin letters (excluding a, o, and x) and transit-
ing among different states that represent Burmese
characters. The Appendix provides the descrip-
tion of the automaton.

The shortcuts can be grouped in the following
four categories:

• three lowercase letters for common combina-
tions: a=qevq, o=qiuq, and x=qngfq;

• uppercase letters to save double keystrokes:
E=qee, F=qff, H=qhh, I=qii, J=qjj,
R=qrr, U=quu, V=qvv, W=qww, and Y=qyy;

• uppercase letters to save h/g: B=qbh, C=qch,
D=qdh, G=qgh, K=qkh, L=qlg, M=qmg,
P=qph, Q=qg, T=qth, and Z=qzh; and

• uppercase letters for other cases: A=qegg,
N=qny, O=qsr, S=quug, and X=qng.

Lowercase letters a, o, and x can consider-
ably save keystrokes. Note that the shortcuts
have a preceding q in the implementation through
which disambiguation can be realized. The recom-
mended uppercase letters are Y, H, and Q, which
can resolve almost all ambiguous cases when typ-
ing orthographically correct Burmese texts.

Two issues related to normalizing the encoding
of the Burmese script in Unicode are addressed:

• 102B is a variant of 102C, exclusively used
for narrow characters of 1001, 1002, 1004,
1012, 1015, and 101D. This alternation is ex-
ecuted automatically when typing v or a (i.e.,
shortcut for ev). However, qv and qvg can ex-
actly input 102C and 102B, respectively.

• 1037 and 103A can appear successively; how-
ever, their order is not precisely identified.
103A 1037 will always be normalized in Uni-
code into the recommended order 1037 103A.
4It is possible to intentionally input orthographically in-

correct Burmese strings; however, orthographically correct
strings can be inputted more naturally than incorrect ones.

Figure 2: Default Burmese layout in Win (left) and Mac (right). Only the final two digits of Unicode are shown
for a compact presentation. The places of f- and j- keys on a QWERTY keyboard are marked by bold frame. For
each key, the lower character is inputted using simple keystroke, whereas the upper character requires pressing the
Shift-key. On the Mac keyboard, some character combinations are mapped on one key, which is underlined in
the figure. Meanwhile several rare characters require Alt-key, which is in gray color. Note that 103A and 1036
marked with gray background appear two times on the Mac keyboard.

Figure 3: Example of the proposed input method. The top row is the typed Latin letters; the inputted Burmese
string after each keystroke is presented in an increasing manner. Latin letters with frame are the shortcuts and
those with dark background are special design that should be remembered by users. Burmese strings with gray
background have a character alternation from their previous status. Although g and h are regarded as alternation
operators, they are also part of the Romanization, i.e., the first g after n and h after t. The shortcuts mainly save
the extra alternation by g, h and double keystroke (i.e., X, T, and F). Lowercase a is a shortcut for an extremely
common character combination that can be inputted using ev.

4 Keystroke Distribution

The Burmese language has two different styles:
literary and colloquial. For the literary style data,
the publicly accessible Burmese dataset in the
Asian Language Treebank (ALT) project (Riza
et al., 2016) is used, containing approximately
20, 000 long sentences from news articles.5 For
the colloquial style data, we use an in-house trans-
lated Burmese version of the Basic Travel Ex-
pression Corpus (BTEC) (Kikui et al., 2003),
comprising approximately 400, 000 daily expres-
sions. Figures 5 and 6 show the comparison of the
keystroke distribution in Win and Mac keyboards
and by MY-AKKHARA, respectively.

The middle area of the Mac keyboard has not
been efficiently used. Although the uppercase F
can be used instead of lowercase q, the frequency
of the Shift-key will increase considerably. The
keystroke is more focused at the middle of the key-
board by MY-AKKHARA than that on the Win and
Mac keyboards. The use of the Shift-key is op-
tional in MY-AKKHARA, depending on the users’

5http://www2.nict.go.jp/astrec-att/
member/mutiyama/ALT/my-nova-170405.zip

preference. When the Shift-key is completely
applied, the frequency is less than two times that
of used in Win keyboard, and it is approximately
equal to the lower bound used in Mac keyboard.
Generally, index fingers are mostly utilized and lit-
tle fingers have fewer burdens in MY-AKKHARA.

5 Conclusion and Future Work

In this study, a Romanization-based Burmese in-
put method called MY-AKKHARA is proposed to
promote the Unicode standard for Burmese digi-
tization. MY-AKKHARA can also be regarded as
a Burmese-specified, lossless coding version of
Ding et al. (2018), providing a platform to develop
a further fuzzy and smart Burmese input method.

(h, 3E, 1D). All σ1 are natural Romanization. When
σ2 is h, it is also a part of the Romanization.

Figure 9: Two-step alternation. When (σ1, σ2) is
(l, g), (q1, q2, q3) is (1C, 20, 4E). Here, l is a natural
Romanization for 101C and 1020, whereas 104E is
a special abbreviated mark with l as onset. When
(σ1, σ2) is (r, r), (q1, q2, q3) is (3C, 1B, 4D),
respectively. Here, r is a natural Romanization for
103C and 101B, whereas 104D is a special
abbreviated mark with r as onset.

Figure 10: Alternation variant of Fig. 9. (q1, q2, q3) is
(2C, 21, 2B). Considering that 102C and 1021 are
frequently used, the convenient v-key is assigned
instead the natural Romanization by a.
