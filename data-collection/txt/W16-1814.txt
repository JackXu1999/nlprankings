Abstract

In this paper we present a study on the pro-
duction of collocations by students of Eu-
ropean Portuguese as a foreign language.
We start by gathering several corpora writ-
ten by students, and identify the correct
and incorrect collocations. We annotate
the latter considering several different as-
pects, such as the error location, descrip-
tion and explanation. Then, taking these
elements into consideration, we compare
the performance of students considering
their levels of proficiency, their mother
tongue and, also, other languages they
know. Finally, we correct all the students
productions and contribute with a corpus
of everyday language collocations that can
be helpful in Portuguese classes.

1 Introduction

Collocations are stable and mostly non-idiomatic
combinations that fall under the category of mul-
tiword expressions. They are usually constituted
by two or more words, in which one (the base)
determines the other (the collocate) (Hausmann,
2004). For instance, in the collocation strong cof-
fee, coffee is the base and strong is the collocate.
Collocations can be seen as pre-fabricated blocks
(Corpas Pastor, 1996), available as units on the
minds of the speakers of a language, and used in
oral and written production in the same way single
words are. They are highly frequent in languages,
and, thus, assume an important role in the teach-
ing/learning process of a foreign language. How-
ever, if most non-native speakers of a given lan-
guage are able to understand the meaning of a col-
location, as these are relatively transparent struc-
tures, their production can be challenging, as the
relation between their elements is, in most of the

cases, arbitrary (Cruse, 2000). As an example, and
considering the study of English as a foreign lan-
guage, there is no way to know a priori, that a
coffee with too much water is a weak coffee and
not a *faint coffee (Mackin, 1978).

In their study concerning the production of mul-
tiword expressions by European Portuguese learn-
ers, Antunes and Mendes (2015) concluded that
collocations are the type of multiword expressions
that had the largest number of inaccuracies, inde-
pendently of the mother tongue. According to the
authors, “collocations are particularly difficult for
learners of Portuguese L2, because they pose de-
grees of restrictions that are not easily acquired”.
Considering that there is little information avail-
able in Portuguese dictionaries, compared with re-
sources for English (Antunes and Mendes, 2015),
lists of everyday language collocations can be a
useful tool for these students. By the same to-
ken, documenting their errors when producing col-
locations, like done by Ramos et al. (2010) and
Konecny et al. (2015), can help to identify specific
difficulties students may have.

In this paper, we study the collocational per-
formance of students of European Portuguese as
a foreign language. We start by gathering a cor-
pus with texts written by Spanish, French, En-
glish and German students learning European Por-
tuguese (Section 3). Then (Section 4), we iden-
tify their production of collocations, and annotate
the incorrect ones with information such as the
location of the error, its description and a possi-
ble explanation. For the latter cases, we follow
an adapted version of the taxonomy suggested in
(Ramos et al., 2010). We analyse the attained data
(Section 5) and identify the main difficulties. Al-
though most of the results are in line with what
can be found in the literature, some are, some-
how, unexpected. Our last contribution is a cor-
pus of 549 everyday language collocations, which

resulted from correcting the whole set of colloca-
tions provided by the students.

2 Related work

As a linguistic phenomenon, collocations have
been the subject of numerous studies (Sinclair,
1991; Tutin, 2004; Hausmann, 2004); also, they
have proven to be an extremely fruitful thematic of
research in language technology (Smadja, 1993;
Seretan, 2011; Wehrli, 2014).

Considering the Portuguese language, we de-
tach the work of Leiria (2006), and Antunes and
Mendes (2015). The former concerns lexical ac-
quisition by students learning Portuguese as For-
eign Language (L2). The author analysed a corpus
of written material produced by French, German,
Swedish and Chinese students, where she found
“privileged co-occurrences” with a certain degree
of fixedness, like velhos amigos “old friends” or
gastar dinheiro “spend money”, which matches
our definition of collocation. However, each one
of these elements was evaluated based mostly on
the criteria of whether a native speaker would have
used it or not (similarly to the work described in
(Konecny et al., 2015)), which is different from
the evaluation that we will conduct in this work.

Concerning the work of Antunes and
Mendes (2015), it focuses on the multiword
expressions found on a subset of a learner corpus
of Portuguese1. The authors identify different
types of multiword expressions (including col-
locations) produced by foreign students, and
characterise the errors found according with a
taxonomy they propose. In this work, we opted
to follow (and extend) the taxonomy proposed by
Ramos et al. (2010), as it was specifically tailored
to collocations. In fact, having noticed that no
theoretically-motivated collocation error tag set
was available, and, in many corpora, collocation
errors were simply tagged as “lexical errors”, the
aforementioned authors created a fine-grained
three-dimensional typology of collocation errors.
The first dimension captures if the error concerns
the collocation as a whole or one of its elements
(error location); the second dimension captures
the language-oriented error analysis (error de-
scription); the third dimension exemplifies the
interpretative error analysis (error explanation).
Ramos and her team annotated the collocational

547

errors on a learner corpus composed by texts
produced by foreign students of Spanish that had
English as their mother tongue. In this paper,
we annotate erroneous productions of Portuguese
collocations by using the lexical level of this
taxonomy, to which we felt the need to add some
categories.

3 Corpora

We gathered a corpus with students productions
of collocations in European Portuguese, by con-
sidering four corpora, namely: a) Corpus de
Produções Escritas de Aprendentes de PL2 from
Centro de Estudos de Linguı́stica Geral e Apli-
cada (CELGA) (Pereira, 2014); b) Recolha de
Dados de Aprendizagem de Português Lı́ngua Es-
trangeira collected by Centro de Linguı́stica da
Universidade de Lisboa (CLUL)2; c) two other
corpora collected by the authors while teaching at
Ciberescola da Lı́ngua Portuguesa3, and at Facul-
dade de Ciências Sociais e Humanas (FCSH)4.

CELGA and FCSH corpus were collected in the
classroom, and the Ciberescola corpus in online
classes. Data from CLUL was collected in Por-
tuguese courses given in 18 universities from dif-
ferent countries (Austria, Bulgaria, South Korea,
Spain, USA, etc.). Students that participated in
CELGA and CLUL corpus were presented with
the same stimuli, divided in three main topics: the
individual, the society and the environment. Stu-
dents from FCSH and Ciberescola had more di-
versified topics, such as description of their house,
their last holidays, their city or their hobbies,
among others. From these corpora we selected
all texts from students that had Spanish, French,
English and German as their native language, and
organize them in three levels: Level 1 for A1 and
A2 students, Level 2 for B1 and B2 students, and
Level 3 for C1 and C2 students.

4 Annotation process

We manually annotated all the correct and incor-
rect productions of collocations in the collected
corpus. We followed Tutin and Grossman (2002)
definition of collocation: a “privileged lexical co-
occurrence of two (or more) linguistic elements
that together establish a syntactic relationship”.

Each incorrect collocation was associated with
its correct production and the respective syntac-
tic form, as well as with information concerning
the student mother tongue and other foreign lan-
guages that the student may know. Then, we an-
notated the incorrect collocations considering: a)
its location (base, collocate, or whole collocation);
b) its description and c) its explanation, based on
an adapted version of the lexical level of Ramos et
al. (2010) taxonomy, as previously mentioned.

In what concerns the description of the error,
two new error types were added: preposition and
better choice. The first is used when the learner
selects the wrong preposition, adds or elides it5

(apanhar do avião for apanhar o avião (“take the
plane”)). Better choice is used when the colloca-
tion is not wrong, but there is a better choice (co-
zinhar uma receita for fazer uma receita (“make a
recipe”)). The remaining types are a subset of the
ones described in (Ramos et al., 2010): a) Substi-
tution captures the incorrect replacement of a col-
locate or a base by another existing word (cabelos
vermelhos for cabelos ruivos (“red hair”)); b) Cre-
ation is used when a student creates a word that
does not exist, in this case, in the Portuguese lex-
icon, which is the case of the word tiempo in pas-
sar o tiempo for passar tempo (“spend time”); c)
Synthesis is applied when a language unit is used
instead of a collocation (descripção for fazer uma
descrição (“to make a description”)); d) Analysis
covers the case in which the learner creates a new
expression with the structure of a collocation in-
stead of using a single word (tomei o almoço for
almoçar (“to have lunch”)); e) Different sense is
used when the learner uses a correct collocation,
but with a different meaning from the intended one
(ter uma escolha for fazer uma escolha (“make a
choice”)).

Regarding the explanation of the error, we add
an extra type to Ramos’ taxonomy, in order to
cover the situation in which the student mixes Eu-
ropean and Brazilian Portuguese (fazer regime for
fazer dieta (“to be on a diet”)). The remaining
types are the following ones: a) Importation deals
with the case in which a collocation is created
from an expression in another language known by
the student (fazia a merenda for lanchar (“have a
snack”)), which shows an importation from Italian
(“fare merenda”); b) Extension is used when the

5This type of mistake could have been considered a sub-
type of Substitution, but in that case additions and elisions
would not have been taken into account.

learner extends the meaning of an existing word in
Portuguese (faz chuva for chover (“to rain”)). A
more specific case of this type, that we also use
in this work is extension – spelling, which should
be used when spelling is influenced by the pro-
nunciation of the misspelled word, as in loungar
um carro for alugar um carro (“rent a car”); c)
Erroneous derivation addresses the case when the
leaner produces an inexistent form in L2 as a re-
sult of a process of erroneous derivation, in many
cases by analogy with another form in L2 (mod-
elos teoréticos for modelos teóricos (“theoretical
models’)’); d) Overgeneralization handles the sce-
nario in which the learner selects a vaguer or more
generic word than required (fazer sms for man-
dar um sms (“send a message”)); e) Erroneous
choice is used when the student selects a wrong
word without a clear reason and without interven-
tion of the L1 or another L2 (memória de pula for
memória de peixe (“short memory”)).

5 Data analysis

Studies like the one presented by Nessel-
hauf (2005) state that: a) a higher proficiency level
in a language is usually characterised by a higher
rate in the use of collocations; b) this quantita-
tive gain does not mean a qualitative improvement.
Our results, shown in Table 1, do not corrobo-
rate the first statement as students from higher lev-
els did not produce collocations in a higher rate.
However, the second statement is in line with our
results, as only for English students collocational
knowledge seems to improve with higher levels of
proficiency (that is, considering the total number
of produced collocations, the percentage of incor-
rect collocations decreases with the level).

In our study, 16.53% of the errors concern the
base, 74.25% the collocate, and 9.21% the whole
collocation (this tendency is observed in all levels
and all mother tongues), which is in accordance
with Ramos et al. (2010).

Among the deviant collocations, the syntactic
form most used by the students was V + N. In fact,
that is the most studied sequence in learner corpus
research, as students have difficulties selecting the
correct verb not only inside a collocation, but also
in free sequences of V + N. In Nesselhauf (2005)
study with German students of English, one third
of the V + N combinations analysed were not ac-
ceptable, mainly due to a wrong choice of the verb,
which is also in accordance with what we have ob-

served. Collocations that include adjectives and
adverbs seem to be less frequent. A possible ex-
planation is that learners master nouns and verbs
before they get to master adjectives and adverbs
whose presence augments at higher proficiency
levels (Palapanidi and Llach, 2014).

In what concerns description and explanation of
the errors, on Table 2 and 3, substitution was the
most common error in all the three levels and for
all mother tongues (música forte for música alta
(“loud music”) or cabello largo for cabelo com-
prido (“long hair”)). Creation is the second most
common error type also for the three levels and
four languages. In the following example, coger
um táxi for apanhar um táxi (“take a taxi”), the
word coger was created, as it does not exist in Por-
tuguese.

In addition, we verify that Level 1 students
mostly use importation from L1 or another L2 (Ta-
ble 4). In Level 2, importation and extension have
similar proportions, and represent 40% of the er-
rors. Level 3 errors have their origin mostly in ex-
tensions. This may show that lower level students
tend to rely more on other languages, while higher
level students use more sophisticated mechanisms,
like extending the meaning of a known word. An
example is the extension of the delexical verb
fazer in fazer uma photo for tirar uma foto (“take a
picture”). In line with Leiria (2006), who observed
that, regarding combinations of words, the major-
ity of the students use their mother tongue when
they are lacking the correct expression, we also
conclude that students use their mother tongue as

their first support, being the Spanish students the
ones that do it the most (46.47%), and English stu-
dents the ones that do it the least (25.97%). Span-
ish and French students also use Italian and En-
glish, and German students rely in Spanish. Other
than German, no other students use German as
support language. From this we can conclude that
the closest the students native language is to Por-
tuguese, more the language will be used as sup-
port, and students clearly are aware of this dis-
tance.

6 Conclusions and future work

In this paper we presented a study on the produc-
tion of collocations by foreign students of Euro-
pean Portuguese. This corpus was annotated, anal-
ysed and then corrected, resulting in a corpus of

our corpus, especially with Level 3 students, but
also with texts produced by students with other na-
tive languages, like Italian. We also intend to study
the production of collocations by native speakers
of Portuguese. Finally, we want to ask a second
annotator to use the same error categories so that
we are able to calculate an inter-annotator agree-
ment.
