Abstract

In this paper we consider the issue of answering a query with a query. Although these are com-
mon, with the exception of Clarification Requests, they have not been studied empirically. After
briefly reviewing different theoretical approaches on this subject, we present a corpus study of query
responses in the British National Corpus and develop a taxonomy for query responses. We sketch a
formal analysis of the response categories in the framework of KoS.

1 Introduction

Responding to a query with a query is a common occurrence, representing on a rough estimate more than
20% of all responses to queries found in the British National Corpus.1 Research on dialogue has long
recognized the existence of such responses. However, with the exception of one of its subclasses—albeit
a highly substantial one—the class of query responses has not been characterized empirically in previous
work. The class that has been studied in some detail are Clarification Requests (CRs) (Rodriguez and
Schlangen, 2004; Rieser and Moore, 2005). However, CRs can be triggered by any utterance, interrog-
ative or otherwise. Researchers on the semantics and pragmatics of questions (see e.g. Carlson, 1983;
Wiśniewski, 2003) have been aware for many years of the existence of one class of query responses—
responses that express questions dependent on the question they respond to, as in (1a,b). This lead
Carlson to propose (1c) as a sufficient condition for a query response, which can be formalized using
(1d), assuming notions of resolvedness and aboutness (for which see e.g. Ginzburg and Sag, 2000).

(1) a. A: Who murdered Smith? B: Who was in town?

b. A: Who is going to win the race? B: Who is going to participate?

c. Who killed Smith depends on who was in town at the time.

d. q2 can be used to respond to q1 if q1 depends on q2.

e. q1 depends on q2 iff any proposition p such that p Resolves q2, also satisfies p entails r such that r is About q1.

Larsson (2002) and Asher and Lascarides (2003) argue that the proper characterization of question
responses is pragmatically based. Asher and Lascarides (2003) propose to characterize non-CR query
responses by means of the rhetorical relation question elaboration (Q-Elab) with stress on the plan-
oriented relation between the initial question and the question expressed by the response. Q-Elab might
be informally summarized as follows:

(2) If Q-Elab(α, β) holds between an utterance α uttered by A, where g is a goal associated by convention with
utterances of the type α, and the question β uttered by B, then any answer to β must elaborate a plan to achieve g.

1In the spoken part of the BNC, using SCoRE (Purver, 2001), we found 11312 ?/? cross-turn sequences, whereas 41041

?/. cross-turn sequences, so the ?/? pairs constitute 21.6%. (For the SCoRE syntax see http://www.dcs.qmul.ac.uk/

MOTIV questions about the underlying motivations behind asking q1
NO ANSW questions aimed at avoiding answering q1
QA questions providing an answer to q1
IGNORE questions ignoring q1
IND questions with a presupposed answer

The relation of Q-Elab, motivated by interaction in cooperative settings, is vulnerable to examples
such as those in (3). (3a) has one understanding that might be characterized using dependence (What I
like depends on what YOU like), but can also be used simply as a coherent retort. (3b) could possibly
be used in political debate without it necessarily involving an attempt to discover an answer to the first
question asked.

(3) a. A: What do you like? B: What do you like?

b. A: What is Sarkozy going to do about it? B: What is Papandreou?

In order to better understand the nature of question responses, we ran a corpus study on the British
National Corpus (BNC). The results we obtained show that, apart from CRs, dependent questions are
indeed by far the largest class of question responses. However, they reveal also the existence of a number
of response categories, characterizable neither as dependent questions nor as plan supporting responses.
They include (a) a class akin to what Conversation Analysts refer to as counters (Schegloff, 2007)—
responses that attempt to foist on the conversation a distinct issue from the current discourse topic and
(b) responses that ignore the current topic but address the situation it concerns.

Attaining completeness in characterizing the response space of a query is of fundamental importance
for dialogue management and the design of user interfaces. Beyond that general goal, a better under-
standing of e.g. counters and situation–relevant responses, which we believe are rare in task–oriented di-
alogue, is important for adversarial interaction (courtroom, interrogation, argumentation, certain games).
Characterizing their coherence is challenging for all approaches that ground dialogue on cooperativity
principles (e.g. Asher and Lascarides, 2003; Roberts, 2011).

The rest of the paper is structured as follows: in section 2 we present the taxonomy underlying our
corpus study; section 3 describes the results; in section 4 we sketch a formal analysis of one of the
response categories in the framework of KoS (Ginzburg and Fernández, 2010). We conclude with a
summary and future work.

2 A corpus-based taxonomy of answering by means of questions

The study sample The taxonomy of query responses was designed after an analysis of 1051 examples
of query-query response pairs obtained from the BNC. The sample was obtained from blocks D, F, G, H,
J, K of the BNC (so it covers a wide range of dialogue domains, like interviews, radio and TV broadcasts,
tutorials, meetings, training sessions or medical consultations). Initially, examples were obtained with
the search engine SCoRE (Purver, 2001) (the search string was ?$ | ?$). Subsequently, cross talk and
tag questions were eliminated manually. The sample was classified and annotated by the first author with
tags presented in Table 1 (we discuss the reliability of this annotation in section 3).

In what follows we describe and exemplify each class of the resulting taxonomy. To make the de-
scription clear we will use q1 for the initial question posed and q2 for a question given as a response to
q1. The taxonomy was built with attention paid to the function of q2 in the dialogue.

Clarification requests (CR) Clarification requests are all question-responses that concern the content
or form of q1 that was not completely understood. This class contains intended content queries (4a),



repetition requests (4b) and relevance clarifications (4c).

(4) a. A: What’s Hamlet about? B: Hamlet? [KPW, 945–946]2

b. A: Why are you in? B: What? A: Why are you in? [KPT, 469–471]

c. A: Is he knocked out? B: What do you mean? [KDN, 3170–3171]

In this paper we will not consider this class in detail, mainly because of existing, detailed work on
this subject such as (Purver, 2006).

Dependent questions (DP) By a dependent question we understand q2 where a dependency statement
as in (1c) could be assumed to be true. The following examples illustrate this:

(5) a. A: Do you want me to <pause> push it round? B: Is it really disturbing you? [FM1, 679–680]
(cf. Whether I want you to push it depends on whether it really disturbs you

b. A: Any other questions? B: Are you accepting questions on the statement of faith at this point? [F85, 70–71]
(cf. Whether more questions exist depends on whether you are accepting questions on the statement of faith at this
point.)

‘How should I answer this?’ questions (FORM) This class consists of question-responses addressing
the issue of the way the answer to q1 should be given. It is the case where the form of answer to q1
depends on the answer given to q2. This relation between q1 and q2 might be noticed in following
examples. Consider (6a). The way B answers A’s question in this case will be dictated by A’s answer to
q2—whether or not, A wants to know details point by point.

(6) a. A: Okay then, Hannah, what, what happened in your group?
B: Right, do you want me to go through every point? [K75, 220–221]

b. A: Where’s that one then?
B: Erm, you know Albert Square? [KBC, 506–507]

Requests for underlying motivation (MOTIV) In the case of requests for underlying motivation q2
addresses the issue of motivation behind asking q1. What is important here is that the fact of answering
q1 depends on the answer to q2 (i.e. providing proper reasons for asking q1). In this aspect this class
differs form the previous ones, where we may assume that an agent wishes to provide answer to q1. Most
of question-responses of this kind are of the form “Why?” (32 out of 41 gathered examples, cf. (7a)),
but also other formulations were observed (8 out of 41, cf. (7b)). Most direct questions of this kind are:
What’s it got to do with you?; what’s it to you?; Is that any of your business?; what’s that gotta do with
anything?.

(7) a. A: What’s the matter? B: Why? [HDM, 470–471]

b. A: Out, how much money have you got in the building society? B: What’s it got to do with you? [KBM, 2086–
2087]

I don’t want to answer your question (NO ANSW) The role of query responses of this class is to give
a clear signal that an agent does not want to provide an answer to q1. Instead of answering q1 the agent
provides q2 and attempts to ‘turn the table’ on the original querier.

(8) a. A: Yeah what was your answer? B: What was yours? [KP3, 636–637]

b. A: Why is it recording me? B: Well why not? [KSS, 43–44]

category’s percentage of the sample that excludes CRs.

Category Frequency % of the Total

CR 832 79.16
DP 108 10.28 (49)
MOTIV 41 3.90 (18)
NO ANSW 26 2.47 (12)
FORM 16 1.52 (7)
QA 13 1.24 (6)
IND 9 0.85 (4)

IGNORE 6 0.57 (3)
Total 1051 (219) 100

Indirect answers/responses (IND/QA) This class consists of query responses, which provide (indi-
rectly) an answer to q1. Interestingly, answering q2 is not necessary in this case. Consider (9a). B by
asking the question Do you know how old this sweater is? clearly suggests that the answer to A’s ques-
tion is negative. Moreover, B does not expect to obtain an answer to his/her question. This might also be
observed in (9b) (‘of course I am Gemini’).

(9) a. A: Is that an early Christmas present, that sweater? B: Do you know how old this sweater is? [HM4, 7–8]

b. A: Are you Gemini? B: Well if I’m two days away from your, what do you think? [KPA, 3603–3604]

Another means of providing indirect answers can be observed in the corpus data. It is the case that by
asking q2 an agent already presupposes the answer to q1. If we take a look on (10) we note that positive
answer to q1 is presupposed in B’s question (I will help you).

(10) A: Will you help with the <pause> the paint tonight? B: What can I do? [KE4, 3263–3264]

I ignore your question (IGNORE) The last observed class is somewhat harder to grasp. This is the
case where q2 is related to the situation, but ignores q1. This is evident in (11). A and B are playing
Monopoly. A asks a question, which is ignored by B. It is not that B does not want to answer A’s question
and that’s why he/she asks q2. Rather, B ignores q1 and asks a question related to the situation (in this
case the board game).

(11) A: I’ve got Mayfair <pause> Piccadilly, Fleet Street and Regent Street, but I never got a set did I?
B: Mum, how much, how much do you want for Fleet Street? [KCH, 1503–1504]

3 Results and annotation reliability

The results of the performed classification are presented in Table 2. Putting aside CRs, the majoritarian
class is indeed DP. What is striking is the relatively large frequency of adversarial responses (the classes
MOTIV, NO ANSW, IGNORE). FORM, as we discuss below, is the sole class whose coherence clearly
requires reasoning about the querier’s intentions. It is relatively infrequent.

In order to check the reliability of the classification process, the decision tree was tested by three
other annotators. Annotators obtained the sample of 90 (randomly chosen) question-question pairs3

and decision tree. The instruction was to annotate question-reply to the first question in each example.
Some of the examples were enriched with additional context (after q2). Two annotators reported that the
annotation task would be easier if the context would be present for all examples.

The reliability of the annotation was evaluated using κ (Carletta, 1996). The agreement on the coding
of the control sample by four annotators was moderate (Fleiss κ = 0.44, SE = 0.0206, 95%CI =

3The distribution of the classes was in line with the distribution observed by the primary annotator: CR: 39 examples; DP: 18
examples; MOTIV: 10 examples; NO ANSW: 10 examples; FORM: 4 examples; QA: 4 examples; IGNORE: 3 examples; OTHER:
2 examples.



0.3963 to 0.4770)4. One of the control sample annotators is an experienced linguist with extensive
past work with dialogue transcripts. In this case agreement on the coding was strong (71% agreement
with Cohen’s κ = 0.62, SE = 0.0637, 95%CI = 0.4902 to 0.7398). Two other control sample
annotators are logicians, but with little experience in corpus annotation. For them agreement on the
coding was somewhat lower, i.e. moderate (66% agreement with Cohen’s κ = 0.56, SE = 0.0649,
95%CI = 0.4266 to 0.6810; and 54% agreement with Cohen’s κ = 0.42, SE = 0.0674, 95%CI =
0.2829 to 0.5472). The most unproblematic cases were CR, MOTIV and IGNORE (the largest groups
of examples with at least 3 annotators’ agreement). Also DP, NO ANSW and QA had high agreement
between annotators. The main problem was with FORM. We assume that this is caused by the unclarity
in the question introducing this class in the decision tree (‘The way the answer to q1 will be given
depends on the answer to q2’, while for DP it was ‘Is it the case that the answer to q1 depends on the
answer to q2?’). Feedback from two of three control sample annotators reported this as a confusing case.
There were two cases in the control sample on which annotators completely disagreed. These were the
following:

(12) a. A: You know the one you just took out? B: You want it back? [F77, 86–87]

b. A: You want a drink dear? B: Have your sweets for what? [KD1, 5132–5133]

4 Modeling Query Response Categories in KoS

In this section we show how to explicate the coherence relation that underlies the DP query responses
within the framework of KoS. It is worth mentioning that this framework allows to model also the other
query responses types described in this article, as we will show in an extended version of this paper. KoS
is a framework for dialogue whose logical underpinning is Type Theory with Records (TTR) (Cooper,
2005) and which underlies dialogue systems such as GoDiS and CLARIE (Larsson, 2002; Purver, 2006).
On the approach developed in KoS, there is actually no single context—instead of a single context,
analysis is formulated at a level of information states, one per conversational participant. The type of
such information states is given in (13a). We leave the structure of the private part unanalyzed here, as
with one exception all our characterizations do not make reference to this; for one approach to private,
see e.g. (Larsson, 2002). The dialogue gameboard represents information that arises from publicized
interactions. Its structure is given in (13b)—the spkr,addr fields allow one to track turn ownership, Facts
represents conversationally shared assumptions, Pending and Moves represent respectively moves that
are in the process of/have been grounded, QUD tracks the questions currently under discussion:

The basic units of change are mappings between dialogue gameboards that specify how one game-
board configuration can be modified into another on the basis of dialogue moves. We call a mapping
between DGB types a conversational rule. The types specifying its domain and its range we dub, respec-
tively, the preconditions and the effects, both of which are supertypes of DGBType.

We start by characterizing the moves that typically involve accepting q1 into the DGB. The potential
for DP responses is explicated on the basis of the two conversational rules in (14a,b): (14a) says that given
a question q and ASK(A,B,q) being the LatestMove, one can update QUD with q as QUD–maximal.

QSPEC is what characterizes the contextual background of reactive queries and assertions. (14b) says
that if q is QUD–maximal, then subsequent to this either conversational participant may make a move
constrained to be q–specific (14c):

5 Summary and Future Work

The paper provides the first empirically-based study of query responses to queries. The most interesting
finding here is the existence of a number of classes of adversarial responses, that involve the rejec-
tion/ignoring of the original query. Indeed, in such cases the original query is rarely responded to in
subsequent interaction.

We conducted our study in the BNC since it is a general corpus with a variety of domains and
genres. It is of course important to extend this study to more detailed consideration of specific genres
and domains. A significant challenge for future work is automatic classification of query responses into
a taxonomy like the one provided here. We intend to address this in future work.
