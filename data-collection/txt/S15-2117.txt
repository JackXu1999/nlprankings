Abstract

This paper describes the system used by the
ValenTo team in the Task 11, Sentiment Anal-
ysis of Figurative Language in Twitter, at Se-
mEval 2015. Our system used a regression
model and additional external resources to as-
sign polarity values. A distinctive feature of
our approach is that we used not only word-
sentiment lexicons providing polarity anno-
tations, but also novel resources for dealing
with emotions and psycholinguistic informa-
tion. These are important aspects to tackle
in figurative language such as irony and sar-
casm, which were represented in the dataset.
The system also exploited novel and stan-
dard structural features of tweets. Considering
the different kinds of figurative language in
the dataset our submission obtained good re-
sults in recognizing sentiment polarity in both
ironic and sarcastic tweets.

1 Introduction

Figurative language, which is extensively exploited
in social media texts, is very challenging for both
traditional NLP techniques and sentiment analysis,
which has been defined as “the computational study
of opinions, sentiments and emotions expressed in
text” (Liu, 2010). There is a considerable amount
of works related to sentiment analysis and opinion
mining (Pang and Lee, 2008; Liu, 2010; Cambria
et al., 2013). In particular, the linguistic analysis

of social media (microblogging like Twitter espe-
cially) has become a relevant topic of research in
different languages (Rosenthal et al., 2014; Basile
et al., 2014) and several frameworks for detecting
sentiments and opinions in social media have been
developed for different application purposes.

In a sentiment analysis setting, the presence in a
text of figurative language devices, such as for in-
stance irony, can work as an unexpected polarity re-
verser, by undermining the accuracy of the systems
(Bosco et al., 2013). Therefore, several efforts have
been recently devoted to detect and tackle figura-
tive language phenomena in social media, follow-
ing a variety of computational approaches, mostly
focussing on irony detection and sarcasm recogni-
tion (Davidov et al., 2010; González-Ibáñez et al.,
2011; Riloff et al., 2013) as classification tasks.
Buschmeier et al. present an analysis of fea-
tures, previously applied in irony detection, in a
dataset from a product reviews corpus from Amazon
(Buschmeier et al., 2014). Veale and Hao present
a linguistic approach to separate ironic from non-
ironic expressions in figurative comparisons over a
corpus of web-harvested similes (Veale and Hao,
2010). Concerning Twitter, the problem of irony de-
tection is addressed in (Reyes et al., 2013), where
a set of textual features is used to recognize irony
at a linguistic level. In (Riloff et al., 2013) the fo-
cus is on identifying sarcastic tweets that express a
positive sentiment towards a negative situation. A
model to classify sarcastic tweets using a set of lex-
ical features is presented in (Barbieri et al., 2014).
Moreover, a recent analysis on the interplay between
sarcasm detection and sentiment analysis is in (May-

694



nard and Greenwood, 2014), where a set of rules has
been proposed to improve the performance of the
sentiment analysis in presence of sarcastic tweets.

In this paper we describe our participation to the
SemEval-2015 Task 11: Sentiment Analysis of Figu-
rative Language in Twitter (Ghosh et al., 2015). The
task concerned with classification of tweets contain-
ing different kinds of figurative language, in partic-
ular irony, sarcasm and metaphors. ValenTo system
used a linear regression model, exploiting novel and
standard structural and lexical features of tweets.
Considering the different kinds of figurative lan-
guage in the Semeval dataset - sarcasm, irony and
metaphors - our submission had good results in rec-
ognizing sentiment polarity in both ironic and sar-
castic tweets, than in the other cases.

2 Our System

We propose a supervised approach that consists in
assigning a polarity value to tweets by using a lin-
ear regression model constructed from an annotated
dataset. In order to catch characteristics that allow
us to measure the polarity value in each tweet, we
considered a set of features described below.

2.1 Feature Description

2.1.1 Structural Features
Among the several structural characteristics of

tweets, in our study we consider: the length of
tweets in amount of words (lengthWords); the length
of a tweet as the number of characters that composes
the textual message (lengthChar); the frequency of
commas, semicolons, colons, exclamation and ques-
tion marks (punctuation marks); the frequency of
some Part of Speech categories as nouns, adverbs,
verbs and adjectives (POS); the frequency of upper-
case letters in each tweet upperFreq; the frequency
or presence of URL urlFreq; and the amount of
emoticons used in order to express some kind of
emotion, we consider both positive (emotPosFreq)
and negative ones (emotNegFreq).

We also consider some features that belongs to
tweets, like: the presence or absence of hashtags
(hashtagBinary) and mentions (mentionsBinary);
the amount of hashtags (hashtagFreq) and mentions
(mentionsFreq) in each tweet; and if the tweet is a
retweet (isRetweet). Finally, we decide to take into

account a feature (polReversal) in order to reverse
the polarity (positive to negative, and vice versa) if a
tweet includes the hashtag #sarcasm or #not.

2.1.2 Lexical Resources

In order to take into account sentiments, emotions
and psycholinguistic features, and to count their fre-
quency, we use the following lexical resources:

AFINN: it is a dictionary of 2, 477 English man-
ually labeled words collected by Nielsen (Nielsen,
2011). Polarity values varies from −5 up to +5 1.

ANEW: the Affective Norms for English Words
provides a set of emotional ratings for a large num-
ber of English words (Bradley and Lang, 1999).
Each word in is rated from 1 to 9 in terms of the three
dimensions of Valence, Arousal and Dominance.

DAL: the Dictionary of Affective Language devel-
oped by Whissell (Whissell, 2009) contains 8, 742
English words rated in a three-point scale2. Each
word is rated into the dimensions of Pleasantness,
Activation and Imagery.

HL: Hu–Liu’s lexicon (Hu and Liu, 2004) in-
cludes about 6, 800 positive and negative words3.

GI: General Inquirer (Stone and Hunt, 1963) con-
tains categories and subcategories for content analy-
sis with dictionaries based on the Lasswell and Har-
vard IV-4 4.

SWN: SentiWordNet (Baccianella et al., 2010) is
a lexical resource for opinion mining and consists in
three sentiment scores: positive, negative and objec-
tive5. We take into account the first two categories.

SN: SenticNet is a semantic resource for concept-
level sentiment analysis (Cambria et al., 2012).
We take into account the values of each one of the
five dimensions (senticnetDimensions) provided by
the lexical resource: Pleasantness (Pl), Attention
(At), Sensitivity (Sn) and Aptitude (Ap) and Polar-
ity (Pol); and also the polarity value p obtained by
using the formula (senticnetFormula) below based

on a combination of the first four dimensions:

p =
n∑

i=1

Pl(ci) + |At(ci)| − |Sn(ci)|+ Ap(ci)
3N

where ci is an input concept, N the total number of
concepts which compose the tweet, and 3 a normal-
isation factor.

LIWC: Linguistic Inquiry and Word Counts dic-
tionary6 contains 127,149 words distributed in cate-
gories that can further be used to analyze psycho-
linguistic features in texts. We select two cate-
gories for positive and negative emotions: PosEmo
(12,878) entries and NegEmo (15,115 entries).

NRC: in the NRC word-emotion association lexi-
con (Mohammad and Turney, 2013) each word is la-
beled according to the Plutchik’s primary emotions.

3 Results

3.1 Task Description and Dataset
The goal of the Task 11 at SemEval 2015, is the fol-
lowing: given a set of tweets rich w.r.t. the pres-
ence of such figurative devices, to determine for each
message whether the user expressed positive, neg-
ative or neutral sentiment, and the sentiment de-
gree. To have a measure of the sentiment intensity
expressed in the message, it was proposed a fine-
grained 11-point sentiment polarity scale.

tensity.

ticipant systems predictions to the manually anno-
tated gold standard: Cosine Similarity (CS) and

Mean Squared Error (MSE). The corpus available
for training and trial consists of around 9, 000 figu-
rative tweets with sentiment scores ranging from−5
to +5. Because of the perishability of Twitter data,
some of them cannot be recovered by the published
list of tweet identifiers; finally, we could rely on a
corpus of 7, 390 messages considering both training
and trial datasets. With respect to the polarity, the
whole distribution is positively skewed (Fig. 1). The
median value is very negative (−2.3) and the aver-
age of the tweets polarity is −2.
3.2 ValenTo System

As a first step, we decided to address the problem
as a classification task. We experimented three ap-
proaches, each featured by a different amount of
considered classes; in the first one (3c-approach)
we used just three classes: positive (pos), nega-
tive (neg) and neutral (neu); in the second one (4c-
approach) we used four classes: positive, nega-
tive, not so negative (nsn) and very negative (vn);
and in the third one (11c-approach) we used the
original values included in the corpus, i.e. eleven
classes from −5 to +5. For the first two approaches
we changed the polarity values (pv) in each one of
the tweets contained in the dataset according to the
criteria summarized in Table 1. Based on polarity
value distribution shown in Fig. 1, we separated the
classes in different ranges that cover all the possi-
ble values. A small set of widely classification al-
gorithms was used: Naive Bayes (NB), Decision
Tree (DT) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)7. We
performed classification experiments using only the
training set (i.e. 6,928 tweets); a ten fold-cross-
validation criterium was applied. Table 2 presents
results obtained in F-measure terms.

7We used Weka toolkit’s version available at
http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/
downloading.html

4c-approach 0.458 0.440 0.462
11c-approach 0.324 0.311 0.302

As expected, from our classification results, the
performance in terms of F-Measure drops while the
number of classes increase. We decided to apply a
different approach: Regression.

In order to build a regression model able to as-
sign polarity values, we decided to merge both train-
ing and trial datasets (fullTrainingSet composed by
7,390 tweets). We used the Linear Regression Algo-
rithm in Weka.
First, from the whole fullTrainingSet corpus we ran-
domly extracted a set for training, containing the
70% of the tweets, and a set for the test, with the re-
maining 30%, obtaining Subset-1. We repeated the
procedure two times more and we obtained Subset-2
and Subset-3.Second, we made up 11 different com-
binations of features ft-conf[1-11]. Each one con-
tains a subset of the features described in Sec. 2.1.
We built the features combination according to a
preliminary analysis with respect to frequency dis-
tribution. Then, we applied our regression model
for each Subset and ft-conf . In order to evaluate the
performance of our model, we used the script to ob-
tain the cosine similarity measure provided by the
organizers. Table 3 shows the results of these exper-
iments for what concerns ft-conf2 configuration, the
one we selected for constructing the final model sub-
mitted to SemEval-Task 11 (due to lack of space, not
have been included all results obtained). ft-conf2
contains the following features:

lengthChar, punctuation marks, POS, upperFreq,
urlFreq, emotPosFreq, emotNegFreq,
hashtagBinary, mentionsBinary, hashtagFreq,
mentionsFreq, isRetweet, polReversal, AFINN,
ANEW, DAL, HL,GI, SWN, senticnetDimensions,
senticnetFormula, LIWC, NRC

Table 3: Regression experiments: results.
Features Subset-1 Subset-2 Subset-3
ft-conf2 0.8218 0.8161 0.8199

In order to measure the relevance of each fea-
ture used in our model, we applied the RELIEF al-
gorithm8. The best ranked features are those re-
lated to emotional words (NRC) and polarity lexi-
cons (AFINN and HL).

3.3 Official Results
We ranked 6th out of 15 teams in the SemEval-2015
Task 11 (Ghosh et al., 2015)9. ValenTo achieved the
score of 0.634 using the CS measure, and a score of
2.999 using the MSE measure, while the best team
achieved the score of 0.758 for CS, and a score of
2.117 for MSE.

Our results in terms of irony and sarcasm seem to
be close to the best ones in each category (See Table
4).

gory of figurative type.

4 Conclusions

We described our participation at SemEval-2015
Task 11. A distinctive feature of our approach is
that we used not only word-sentiment lexicons but
also novel resources for dealing with emotions and
psycholinguistic information. Based on both fea-
tures analysis and evaluation results, we can draw
a first insight about the importance of using such
high-level information about affective value of the
words in a tweet to tackle with figurative language
such irony and sarcasm. As future work, the use
of additional features for addressing figurative lan-
guage under other perspectives (e.g. metaphor) will
be explored.
