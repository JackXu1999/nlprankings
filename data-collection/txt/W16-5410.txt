Abstract

This paper describes a Japanese political corpus created for interdisciplinary political research.
The corpus contains the local assembly minutes of 47 prefectures from April 2011 to March
2015. This four-year period coincides with the term of office for assembly members in most
autonomies. We analyze statistical data, such as the number of speakers, characters, and words, to
clarify the characteristics of local assembly minutes. In addition, we identify problems associated
with the different web services used by the autonomies to make the minutes available to the
public.

1 Introduction

Many local autonomies in Japan provide access to various political documents on their websites. Such
documents include basic urban development plans, local assembly minutes, and ordinances. The infor-
mation obtained through the Internet can be used to compare the autonomies and identify the charac-
teristics of individual autonomies. Local assembly minutes are an especially important source of such
characteristics because they include various representatives’ positions on policies enforced by the au-
tonomy. Some studies that compare local assembly minutes have been conducted by political scientists
(Tadashi Masuda, 2012). However, some issues arise with the analysis of local assembly minutes that
should be addressed. One such issue is the different ways used to release the minutes to the public.
There are 47 prefectures and several cities, towns, and villages in Japan, and local assembly minutes
are made available in a variety of ways. Therefore, collecting local assembly minutes and unifying the
format of the collected data for analysis on a national level is cost inefficient. In this paper, we attempt
to create a corpus of local assembly minutes in Japan. This corpus realizes some research findings from
NLP and sociolinguistics. Our objective is to develop a corpus that can be used for a broader range of
interdisciplinary research.

We collected opinions from political scientists and economists to identify their research requirements
with regard to local assembly minutes. It became clear that the scope of minutes must be controlled
to conduct a strict comparative analysis. Specifically, the following requirements were identified as
important: i) the periods must be identical and ii) autonomies must be classified as prefectures and other
small regions such as cities, towns, and villages. For the first requirement, we collected minutes from
assemblies held between April 2011 and March 2015. This four-year period is consistent with the term

78



of office for assembly members’ in most autonomies. To satisfy the second requirement, we collected
assembly minutes from all 47 prefectures.

The objectives of this study are as follows: i) collect local assembly minutes (each of which have
different formats) from all 47 prefectural assemblies, ii) obtain fundamental statistical data from the
collected text data, and iii) extract political keywords using term frequency-inverse document frequency
(tf-idf) weighting for a preliminary comparative analysis.

2 Collecting local assembly minutes

2.1 Outline

In this study, our primary purpose was to collect minutes of assemblies between April 2011 and March
2015 from all 47 prefectures. In the assembly minutes, all utterances are transcribed and recorded. Thus
the assembly minutes will reveal policy planning and consensus building processes. As a result, assembly
minutes are valuable documents for political analysis.

Local autonomies are independent, and the methods used to release assembly minutes differ, thus
making the collection of assembly minutes. For example, a customized web crawler will be required for
each autonomy.

The variety of text formats presents another difficulty. We need to extract assembly members’ utter-
ance from crawled web documents. Utterance attribute information, such as the speaker’s name and the
meeting’s name and date must also be extracted. Thus, the format must be considered for each autonomy.

In the next section, we describe the procedure used to extract assembly minutes and create the corpus.

2.2 Procedure

As shown in Table 1, there are four types of primary web services used to release assembly minutes, and
42 of the 47 prefectures adopt one of these four primary web services. We prepare a web crawler for the
primary four web services. However, many local autonomies have partially customized these services.
We use semi-automated crawling depending on how the local autonomies release such documents. The
remaining five prefectures have developed unique services, and assemblies that use such unique systems
are downloaded using semi-automated crawling.

Table 2 lists the database items for the corpus. We automatically divided the raw into database items.

Below, we illustrate the method used to input text into the database after collecting the local assembly
minutes. First, we designed a web crawler to automatically extract each value, such as “Year,” “Month,”
“Day,” and “Name of meeting,” from a document. The following figure illustrates the extraction of
“Name of meeting”.

3 Year Year the meeting was held.
4 Month Month the meeting was held.
5 Day The day of the meeting.
6 Name of meeting The name that includes the meeting type, volume and number.
7 Name of speaker The name often includes a title such as “Mr.”, “Pres.” and “Chair.”
8 Utterance The utterance is split by either “period” or “new line mark”.
9 Other Other means outside the field of the utterance.

Second, we extract speakers’ names and their utterances from the body text of the minutes using a

post-processing program. Then, the extracted values are registered to the database.

The body text of the assembly minutes does not intend to process by the program. The delimiters

between speaker name and utterance differ among autonomies, with some of them having no delimiter.
Some vary their delimiters arbitrarily. In such cases, we split the text manually.

3 Collecting minutes

In this section, we first clarify the characteristics of each prefecture by counting the words of the local as-
sembly minutes. Then, we extract political keywords using the tf idf weighting method for a preliminary
study of comparative analysis.

3.1 Fundamental statistical data

Here, we show fundamental statistical data of the collected text data. Table 3 shows an overview of
the minutes from the 47 prefectures. We explain two main categories in Table 3, i.e. “Prefectures”
and “Speakers.” The “Prefectures” column includes the web service name, the numbers of speakers,
characters, words, and different words. The “Speakers” column includes the maximum number of words,
minimum number of words, and the average number of words for words and characters. Hence, we
explain the definition of “words” for counting. The Japanese language does not use spaces to divide

80



sentences into words. Therefore, we must write a Japanese sentence with some space between words or
grammatical units prior to counting words. If we count either the number of words or different words,
the result changes according to the word division method. The results of a word division method differ
depending on the employed morphological analysis tool and dictionary. In Table 3, we use MeCab(Kudo
et al., 2004) in combination with the IPAdic dictionary 1.

First, we focus on the minimum and maximum number of “speakers.” Speakers includes local assem-
bly members, a governor, and someone acting on behalf of the governor. In Table 3, the minimum and
maximum number of “speakers” is 61 (Akita) and 1,091 (Saitama), respectively. In contrast, according to
the “Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications” website published in March 20122, the minimum
and maximum number of “local assembly members” is 35 (Fukui and Tottori) and 125 (Tokyo), respec-
tively. Although speakers include a governor and someone acting on behalf of the governor, the number
of “speakers” was larger than that of assembly members because speaker’s names were spelled in several
different ways. For example, for the “Toda” local assembly member, four different representations of the
name were found.

Second, we focus on minimum and maximum number of characters. In Table 3, the minimum and
maximum number of characters is 2,191,589 (Yamagata) and 19,389,614 (Nagano), respectively. In pre-
fectures having too many characters, the collected text includes non-utterances such as “symbols,” “table
of contents,” “description of circumstance,” and “supporting data.” In particular, the size of “supporting
data” is the largest one among non-utterances, and it is difficult to determine whether a sentence is an
utterance.

Finally, we summarize the problems associated with creating a Japanese political corpus from local
assembly minutes. Using the fundamental statistical data, we could not completely extract both “Name of
speakers” and “Utterances.” We faced two problems: i) a speaker’s name was spelled in several different
ways and ii) it was difficult to determine whether a sentence is an utterance.

3.2 Extracting political keywords using tf-idf

In this section, we attempt to detect specific political keywords from each prefecture. This is a pilot
political comparative analysis study.

First, utterances in the minutes are divided into words by morphological analysis. We use MeCab
(ipadic-NEologd) for this analysis. The target part of speech is a noun. We exclude “noun-dependent,”
“noun-number,” “noun-pronoun,” “noun-suffix” and “noun-proper noun-person’s name” forms.

Then specific political words are calculated by applying tf-idf weighting. The TF is a term’s occurrence
within the minutes of each prefecture divided by the number of words in the minutes. The TF of term
t for document d, where d denotes minutes, is expressed as follows. The minutes contain a significant
number of words; therefore, we use a logarithmic value for tf .

tf(t, d) = log
count(t), t ∈ d

|d|
A term’s DF is the number of documents (i.e., prefecture minutes) containing that term divided by

the total number of documents. The DF of t in N documents is expressed as follows. In this case, N
becomes 47.

df(t,N) = |{di : t ∈ di, i = 1..N}|
The multiplied value of TF and IDF is the score of the word.

Table 4 shows the top three words obtained using tf-idf weighting. We find many political keywords
spoken in the assembly. For example “HAC,” the first-ranked word in Hokkaido Prefecture, is a regional
airline company whose largest shareholder is the prefecture. “Daisetsu Ribaa-netto,” the third word in
Iwate Prefecture, is an NPO that is known to commit crimes using subsidized money. “Shimane Japanese
beef cattle,” the second word in Shimane prefecture, is a bland of Japanese beef cattle which is promoted
by this prefecture.

There are many compound words in Japanese political words. For example “zaisei-kaikaku (fiscal
reform)” comprises two nouns, i.e., “zaisei (fiscal)” and “kaikaku(reform).” Therefore, we combine con-
tinuous nouns and attempt to handle them as a single compound word. Table 5 shows the top three
compound words obtained by tf-idf weighting. We find many titles of the officer, i.e. “Mr.” and “Pre-
fectural Assembly”. The title of an officer is typically derived from political agendas. For example,
the third words in Aomori Prefecture are “Director-General of the Tourism and International Strategy
Bureau.” The first words in Gunma Prefecture are “Director-General of the Transportation Infrastruc-
ture Department.” The first words in Shizuoka Prefecture are “Director-General of the Transportation
Infrastructure Department.” From these examples, we can identify the primary political subjects in each
prefecture at that time.

However, this methods has some drawbacks such as incorrect compounding. We can perform prelim-
inary comparative analysis of political keywords using a simple tf-idf-weighting method. Further study
will be required, e.g. statistical analysis such as corresponding analysis and machine learning methods.

used various documents as political corpora. In this section, we describe corpora that include political
information.

Political document analysis has employed various document collections on the web, such as blogs
(Yano et al., 2009). Probabilistic models have been proposed to generate blog posts and comments
jointly within a blog site. Hassanali et al. (2010) proposed a technique to automatically tag political
blog posts using support vector machines and named entity recognition. They used blog documents as a
corpus. Chambers et al. (2015) modeled sentiment analysis for social sciences. They used Twitter data
(over two billion tweets) as a corpus.Lerman et al. (2008) automatically predicted the impact of news on
public perception of political candidates. They used daily newspaper articles as a corpus. Cano-Basave
et al. (2016) used semantic frames to model argumentation in speaker discourse. Their presidential
political debates corpus comprises 20 debates that took place between May 2011 and February 2012.
Iyyer et al. (2014) applied a recursive neural network framework to detect political positions. They
performed experiments using a dataset of Congressional debates and an original political dataset as a
corpus. As mentioned above, political corpora typically comprise blogs, Twitter data, newspaper articles,
and original political datasets. Therefore, a political corpus constructed from local assembly minutes is
a novel and valuable source of political information.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we described a Japanese political corpus constructed from the local assembly minutes of 47
prefectures collected over four years (April 2011 to March 2015), which represents a full term of office
for assembly members in most autonomies. We collected local assembly minutes from all 47 prefectural
assemblies, obtained fundamental statistical data from the collected text data, and extracted political
keywords using a tf-idf weighting method.

As a result, we confirmed the following. First, we could collect 47 local assembly minutes for four
years. Second, we could not completely divide the body text into “Name of speakers” and “Utterance”
because the delimiter differs depending on the various autonomies. Finally, we demonstrated that the
system can automatically extract political keyword using a tf-idf weighting method. We believe that this
new corpus will be useful for comparative studies of local politics.
